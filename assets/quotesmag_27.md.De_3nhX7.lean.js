A rally involving Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians was held in Gaza Strip and various celebrations were conducted all over the Palestinian Authority. Thousands of jubilant Hamas supporters openly raised green flags in the West Bank, to celebrate the Islamic organisation's 25th anniversary. The guest of honor at the ceremony was Hamas leader in-exile Khaled Mashal, who arrived in Gaza Strip for the first time in his life, after entering the Gaza strip through Egypt. In his speech, which Mashal gave at a mass rally attended by hundreds of thousands of supporters, he stated explicitly that the Palestinian people would never compromise with Israel's existence and that the organization will act decisively to gradually conquer and achieve full control over the whole region, which encompass both Israel and the Palestinian territories in order to establish one Islamic state in that region.  Background  Hamas formed in late 1987, during the first Intifada, as an outgrowth of the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. Co-founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin stated in 1987, and the Hamas Charter affirmed in 1988, that Hamas was founded to liberate the historic region of Palestine from Israeli occupation and to establish an Islamic state in the area that is now Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip.Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement), www.ict.org.il Various Hamas elements have used both political and violent means, including terrorism, to pursue the goal of establishing an Islamic Palestinian state in place of the state of Israel. Since June 2007 Hamas has governed the Gaza portion of the Palestinian Authority, after it won a majority of seats in the Palestinian Parliament in the January 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections and then defeated the Fatah political organization in a series of violent clashes. Although Arab nations, Iran, Russia, and Turkey have recognized the Hamas, Israel, the United States,\\"Country reports on terrorism 2005\\", United States Department of State. Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism. US Dept. of State Publication 11324. April 2006. p 196 Canada, the European Union, Japan, and many other western countries classify Hamas as a terrorist organization.If HAMAS is a Terrorist Organization, What Does That Make Israel? Intifada: The Voice of Palestine. July 11, 2010  Gaza rally  Palestinian men, women and children flocked to Al-Katiba square despite the rains in the morning and gathered before a huge stage, wearing headbands and waving green flags in support of Hamas which has been controlling Gaza since 2007. At least 200,000 people attended Saturday's open-air rally, though Hamas said there were 500,000, including 2,500 members of Islamic delegations from Indonesia, Mauritania, Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, Turkey, Libya and Jordan ‚Äî the biggest turnout for an event since their founding, according to Bloomberg. Hamas officials said that at least 3,000 figures from Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Egypt, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Turkey and Algeria had arrived in the Gaza Strip especially for the event. At the main stage in Gaza City, a roaring crowd greeted Khaled Mashaal and Gaza Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, who emerged from a door built into a large model of a rocket fired at Israeli cities during the recent fighting.  Ismail Haniyeh's speech  Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, delivered a speech at the rally in which he stated that Hamas was working toward establishing an Arab and Islamic strategy to liberate ‚Äúall our occupied Palestinian territories.‚Äù He added that the group's ‚Äúvictory‚Äù in the eight-day conflict with Israel (In November 2012) marked the beginning of the collapse of Israel. Hamas has painted itself as the winners of the battle 'Pillar of Cloud', because Israel agreed to a ceasefire brokered by Egypt instead of launching a ground invasion. Hamas' green dominated the gathering, where some children wore military uniforms and others carried guns.  Khaled Mashal's speech  Hamas leader Khaled Mashal arrived in the Gaza Strip for the first time ever for the 25th anniversary of Hamas. Five hours after the start of the event, Khaled Mashal stood on a platform, behind a bank of white flowers. He gave a fiery speech to his supporters, stating among other that: ‚ÄùPalestine is ours from the river to the sea and from the south to the north. There will be no concession on an inch of the land. We will never recognize the legitimacy of the Israeli occupation and therefore there is no legitimacy for Israel, no matter how long it will take.‚Ä≥ Behind Mashaal was an emblem of an M75 missile and a large portrait of Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin. As he spoke, the crowd chanted slogans calling on Hamas‚Äôs armed wing, Izzadin Kassam, to fire rockets next time at Haifa.  Reactions   Palestinian Authority's reaction  Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas announced Sunday, 9 December 2012, that he planned to head to Cairo soon to resume reconciliation talks with Hamas but did not condemn the statements by Hamas. ‚ÄúReconciliation [with Hamas] is dear to us and the unity of our people,‚Äù Abbas told the Arab League in Doha, Qatar. Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal agreed. He told an audience at Gaza‚Äôs Islamic University that ‚Äúresponsibility for Palestine is bigger than one faction alone... Hamas cannot do without Fatah and Fatah cannot do without Hamas.‚Äù The two Palestinian groups have been rivals since Hamas threw Fatah out of Gaza in a bloody coup in 2007. Hamas is also opposed to Fatah‚Äôs recognition of Israel along the pre-1967 lines.  Israel's reaction  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated Sunday, 9 December 2012 that ‚ÄúKhaled Mashaal has revealed Hamas‚Äô real face, while Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas hides behind him by not condemning remarks to destroy Israel.‚Äù Prime Minister Netanyahu told the Cabinet meeting Sunday morning, ‚ÄúYesterday we were re-exposed to our enemies' true face. They have no intention of compromising with us; they want to destroy the state. They will fail, of course; in the annals of the history of our people, we ‚Äì the Jewish People ‚Äì have overcome such enemies.‚Äù Netanyahu noted that Abbas, who has fostered an image of a ‚Äúpeace partner‚Äù while recently declaring unity with Hamas, ‚Äúhas issued no condemnation, not of the remarks about the destruction of Israel, just as previously he did not condemn the missiles that were fired at Israel.‚Äù ‚ÄúTo my regret, he strives for unity with the same Hamas that is supported by Iran,\\" the Prime Minister added. ‚ÄúWe in the government have no illusions. We want a true peace with our neighbors. But we will not close our eyes and stick our heads in the sand. We are not prepared to repeat the same mistake of a unilateral withdrawal and withdrawals that, in effect, led Hamas to take control of Gaza.‚Äù ‚ÄúI have always been astonished at the delusions of others who are prepared to continue this process and call it peace. You would hand over more territory, in this case in Judea and Samaria that controls Israel's cities, to the same people and the result, of course, will be a Gaza on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, Hadera and Kfar Saba.‚Äù Netanyahu vowed to withstand international pressure that objected to the new building projects for Jewish homes in Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria. President Shimon Peres shared Netanyahu‚Äôs views of Hamas but still maintained that Abbas is a ‚Äúpeace partner‚Äù.  The European Union's reaction  The European Union on Monday, 10 December 2012, denounced as \\"unacceptable\\" the statements by Hamas leaders in Gaza \\"that deny Israel‚Äôs right to exist,\\" while also condemning Israel for its plans to link Jerusalem with Ma'ale Adumim. Days earlier, the United Nations passed a resolution, recognizing Palestine as a non-member observer state.

The most significant architect of the early twentieth century was Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who mixed elements of traditional Scottish architecture with contemporary movements. Estate house design declined in importance in the twentieth century. In the early decades of the century, traditional materials began to give way to cheaper modern ones. After the First World War, Modernism and the office block began to dominate building in the major cities and attempts began to improve the quality of urban housing for the poor, resulted in a massive programme of council house building. The Neo-Gothic style continued in to the twentieth century but the most common forms in this period were plain and massive Neo-Romanesque buildings. After the Second World War, brutalist tower blocks were adopted as a solution and this period saw the building of new towns, including Glenrothes and Cumbernauld, but the social and building problems of these constructions soon became apparent. The creation of new towns and council house estates necessitated the rapid supply of new churches. From the 1980s Scottish architecture began to recover its reputation, with new buildings like that created to house the Burrell Collection in Glasgow and more recently the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh. There has also been urban regeneration, involving the replacement and renovation of existing buildings and landscapes. The 1980s saw the growth of speculative house building by developers and the introduction of English brick and half-timbered vernacular styles to Scotland. As the production of state sponsored housing subsided in the 1970s there was a return to conservatism in church design, but there were some original and post-modern designs from the 1980s. Glasgow style and the early twentieth century The Glasgow School of Art, considered one of the greatest designs of Charles Rennie Mackintosh The most significant Scottish architect of the early twentieth century, having a considerable influence on European architecture, was Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868‚Äì1928). He mixed elements of the Scottish baronial architecture, Arts and Crafts Movement and the Art Nouveau to produce elegant modern buildings. His major work included The Willow Tearooms in Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow (1903), Glasgow School of Art (1897‚Äì1909) and Hill House, Helensburgh (1902‚Äì04).A. L. Palmer, The A to Z of Architecture (Scarecrow Press, 2009), , p. 34. The influence of Mackintosh's Glasgow style can be seen in the work of architects like James Salmon (1873‚Äì1924), whose designs included the heavily glass-fronted, Art Nouveau \\"Hatrack\\" (1899‚Äì1902) on Vincent Street and the Lion Chambers, Hope Street (1904‚Äì05), an early example of reinforced concrete construction.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , p. 368. Estate house design declined in importance in the twentieth century. An exception was the work undertaken by John Kinross (1855‚Äì1955). Beginning with the reconstruction of Thurston House, Dunbar, from 1890, he undertook a series of major country house designs.\\"John Kinross\\", Dictionary of Scottish Architect, retrieved 9 February 2012. The most important was Manderston House (1901‚Äì03), built for James Miller in the Adam style.H. Montgomery-Massingberd and C. S. Sykes, Great Houses of Scotland (Laurence King Publishing, 1997), , p. 9. Skibo Castle was rebuilt for industrialist Andrew Carnegie (1899‚Äì1903) by Ross and Macbeth. English architect C. H. B. Quennell designed a neo-Georgian mansion at Altmore (1912‚Äì14) for the owner of a Moscow department store. There was a lull in building after the First World War and social change undermined the construction of rural country houses.D. Mays, \\"Country seat 1600‚ÄìPresent\\", in M. Lynch, ed., Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), , pp. 326‚Äì8. In the twentieth century the distinctive Scottish use of stone architecture declined as it was replaced by cheaper alternatives such as Portland cement, concrete, and mass-production brick. Stone would however be retained as a material for some housing stock in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dumfries, and would undergo revivals.I. Maxwell, \\"A History of Scotland's Masonry Construction\\" in P. Wilson, ed., Building with Scottish Stone (Edinburgh: Arcamedia, 2005), , p. 29. In the twentieth century private architecture was increasingly client driven. James Robert Rhind (1854‚Äì1918), the son of David Rhind, was successful in the competition for new libraries to be constructed in Glasgow following Andrew Carnegie's gift of ¬£100,000 to the city in 1901. His designs were selected for seven libraries, allowing him to demonstrate his individual interpretation of Edwardian Baroque architecture. Rhind's libraries were all built with locally quarried sandstone, which blended in with the existing tenement neighbourhoods. His landmark buildings were greatly enhanced by his liberal use of columns, domes and sculpted features.\\"Baroque libraries in Glasgow\\", Carnegie Libraries of Scotland, retrieved 11 May 2012. James Miller (1860‚Äì1947) is noted for his Scottish railway stations, such as his 1901‚Äì05 extensions to Glasgow Central railway station,E. Williamson, A. Riches and M. Higgs, Glasgow (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1990), , p. 97. and the spectacular Wemyss Bay railway station on the Firth of Clyde.F. A. Walker, The South Clyde Estuary: An Illustrated Architectural Guide to Inverclyde and Renfrew (Edinburgh: Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland, 2006), , p. 146. Early modernism The north facade of St Andrew's House, from Nelson's Monument After the First World War, Miller and his chief designer Richard Gunn (1889‚Äì1933) along with others, adapted to the growing needs of the office block. In Glasgow, with its central gridiron plan, this followed the practice in the United States of filling up entire blocks and building steel framed buildings as high as the fire marshal would allow, as in the heavily American-influenced Union Bank building (1924) at St Vincent Street.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , p. 395. From the mid-twentieth century, public architecture became more utilitarian, as part of the impulse to produce a comprehensive welfare state. Thomas S. Tait (1882‚Äì1954) was among the most important modernist architects of the era, using pyramidal stepped designs for buildings like the St Andrew's House, Edinburgh (1935‚Äì39) built for the Scottish Office, and the 1939 \\"Tower of Empire\\" for the Empire Exhibition, Scotland 1938, held in Bellahouston Park, Glasgow.M. Gardiner, Modern Scottish Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , p. 173. There was a lull in building after the First World War and social change undermined the construction of rural country houses. Isolated examples included the houses that combined modern and traditional elements, designed by Basil Spence and built at Broughton Place (1936) and Gribloch (1937‚Äì9). After World War Two a shortage of building materials further reduced the number of large luxury houses. Isolated examples included Logan House, designed by David Style in the 1950s. In the 1960s there was Basil Hughes's design at Snaigow for Earl Cadogan and the remodelling of Gask House by Claude Phillimore. This period also saw considerable restoration of existing houses. During the First World War the government became increasingly aware of Scotland's housing problems, particularly after the Glasgow rent strike of 1915. A royal commission of 1917 reported on the \\"unspeakably filthy privy-middens in many of the mining areas, badly constructed incurably damp labourers' cottages on farms, whole townships unfit for human occupation in the crofting counties and islands ... groups of lightless and unventilated houses in the older burghs, clotted masses of slums in the great cities\\".A. McIntosh Gray and W. Moffat, A History of Scotland: Modern Times (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), , pp. 70‚Äì1. The result was a massive programme of council house building. Many early council houses were built on greenfield sites away from the pollution of the city, often constructed of semi-detached homes or terraced cottages. Knightswood, north-west of Glasgow, was built as a show piece from 1923‚Äì29, with a library, social centre and seven shopping \\"parades\\". In the 1930s schemes tended to be more cheaply built, like Blackhill, Glasgow, with a thousand houses built as two and three story tenements. These building schemes were designed to rehouse those displaced by urban slum clearance, by which thousands of tenements were demolished. However, often crammed into poor land near railways or gasworks, they soon became notorious. A survey of 1936 found that almost half of Scotland's houses were still inadequate. St. Patrick's Church, Orangefield in (1934‚Äì35) Greenock, one of Gillespie, Kidd & Coia pre-war brick-style architecture The Neo-Gothic style that had become almost universal for church building in the late nineteenth century continued in to the twentieth, with examples including L. G. Thomson's Reid Memorial Church, Edinburgh (1929‚Äì33). However, the most common forms in this period were plain and massive Neo-Romanesque buildings. Protestant examples included H. O. Tarbolton's Bangour Village Church (1924‚Äì30) and Roman Catholic examples included Reginald Fairlie's Immaculate Conception Church, Fort William (1933‚Äì34).M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), , p. 418. The reunification of the Church of Scotland in 1929 removed much of the need for new Presbyterian church-building, which was replaced by a tendency towards renovating nineteenth-century churches. The main tendency in church design in the 1930s was a move towards classicism. There were isolated large classical Protestant commissions, such as Bristo Baptist Church, Edinburgh (1933‚Äì35), but the major buildings in this form were in the Catholic Church where there was a movement towards worshipper-centred basilican plans, after the pontificate of Pius X (1903‚Äì14). This movement reached its peak in the 1960s after the Second Vatican Council. The leading figure in pursuing this style was Giacomo Antonio (Jack) Coia of Gillespie, Kidd & Coia. From the later 1920s he pursued a brick style of Catholic architecture. Coia's first church, St Anne's, Dennistoun (1931), utilised the engineering techniques of Beaux- Arts architecture, resulting in a broad, centralised space, with narrow arcades rather than aisles, with a monumental facade of red-brick. He used a more linear plan in subsequent designs, including St Patrick, Greenock (1934‚Äì35). Coia's partner T. Warnett Kennedy's temporary, open-roofed Catholic chapel at the Empire Exhibition (1938) was fronted by a Mackintosh-like grid of metalwork, and with his St Peter in Chains Church, Ardrossan (1938), with austere walls and towers, showed the influence of the \\"abstract compositions\\" of contemporary Swedish architecture and pointed to the future influence of modernism.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), , p. 417. Post-war brutalism Red Road Flats, Glasgow In the post-war period Scotland continued to produce important architects, including James Stirling (1926‚Äì92), who, with James Gowan (1923‚Äì) designed the Flats at Ham Common, London (1955‚Äì58), considered a landmark in the development of modernist, brutalist residential planning, a style which would have a profound impact in Scotland.H. F. Mallgrave, Modern Architectural Theory: A Historical Survey, 1673‚Äì1968 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , p. 353. Their later work, almost all of it outside Scotland, would be highly influential on an international scale.G. H. Baker, The Architecture of James Stirling and His Partners James Gowan and Michael Wilford: A Study of Architectural Creativity in the Twentieth Century (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2011), . The main thrust of post-war planning would be one of clearance and rebuilding, beginning in Paisley, where from 1955 the populations of districts were decanted, the buildings demolished and rebuilding began, resulting, in the first district, George Street/ Canal Street, in low flats in render and reused rubble around landscaped courtyards, with a 15-storey tower at one end.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , pp. 450 and 451. As the post-war desire for urban regeneration gained momentum it would focus on the tower block, championed in Glasgow by David Gibson, convener of the city housing committee. Projects like the brutalist Red Road Flats originally offered hope of a new beginning and an escape from the overcrowded nineteenth-century tenements of the city, but lacked a sufficient infrastructure and soon deteriorated. They also made extensive use of asbestos as a fire retardant, leading to long term health problems for builders and residents.R. Johnston and A. Mcivor, Lethal Work: A History of the Asbestos Tragedy in Scotland (East Linton, Tuckwell Press, 2000), pp. 103‚Äì4. Robert Matthew (1906‚Äì75) and Basil Spence (1907‚Äì76) were responsible for redeveloping the Gorbals in Glasgow, for demolitions at the University of Edinburgh and the stark rebuilding typified by the David Hume Tower (1960‚Äì63). The new confidence of this period can also be seen in infrastructure projects, of which the Forth Road Bridge (opened 1962) was a key example.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , p. 450. St. Paul's R.C. Church, Glenrothes, one of the first modernist churches produced by Gillespie, Kidd & Coia Another solution adopted in Scotland was the building of new towns like Glenrothes (1948) and Cumbernauld (1956), designed to take excess population from the cities.P. Fry, P. S. Fry and F. S. Fry, The History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 1990), , pp. 203‚Äì4. These used a new low, dense pattern of community design, with terraced cottages and low flats.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , p. 457. Cumbernauld was praised for its architecture when first built, but the uncompleted centre and the layout of the town in general, were receiving heavy criticism by the twenty-first century: its modernist architecture described by one resident as \\"the lego fantasy of an unhappy child\\".A. Alexander, Britain's New Towns: Garden Cities to Sustainable Communities (London: Taylor & Francis, 2009), , p. 117. The brutalist tendency in comprehensive Scottish urban planning would be derided by critics for its \\"tabula rasa planning\\" and \\"architect's arrogance\\".M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , p. 453. The creation of new towns and council house estates necessitated the rapid supply of new churches.C. G. Brown, Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 1997), , p. 164. The austerity, shortage of materials and need for rapid building, discouraged the development of innovative design. This was accompanied by the rejection by most architects of traditional forms in favour of International Style, characterised by simple outlines, uncluttered internal spaces, absence of colour, and flat roofs.J. R. Hume, \\"Post-War Churches In Scotland: Breaking The Mould\\", Scotland's Churches Trust, retrieved 29 December 2012. The Catholic Church, whose traditional membership was most affected by the changes in housing, was the first to react to this situation, creating 76 new parishes between 1845 and 1960 in the west of the country alone. The Baptist and Episcopalian churches followed close behind, particularly in the new towns. Within the Church of Scotland, the closeness of congregation and clergy was expressed in the domestic plainness of 1950s dual-use hall churches, as at Reiach's Kildrum Parish Church, Cumbernauld (completed 1962), a steel framed building, clad in timber and brick with a flat roof.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), , pp. 471‚Äì2. Of 129 buildings erected by the Church of Scotland between 1948 and 1959, 108 were on this basic pattern. Postmodernism: 1980s to the present Glasgow Tower, Scotland's tallest tower, and the IMAX Cinema at the Glasgow Science Centre From the 1980s there was a backlash against the statism and compressive nature of modernist architecture. Instead there was a move towards a form of post-modernism that looked to a clash of styles with a renewed emphasis on visual aesthetics that invoked classicism. There was also a combination of the private and the public. This movement against modernism also included renewed influence by the Scots baronial and Mackintosh-inspired designs; these can be seen respectively in the Scandic Crown Hotel (1988‚Äì89) in the Old Town in Edinburgh and the National Library Causewayside Building (1985‚Äì87, extended 1993‚Äì94).M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , pp. 486‚Äì7. The most significant figure in the development of architecture in Scotland from the 1980s was the academic Charles McKean. He was secretary and treasurer of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS) from 1979 to 1995. He argued against motorway expansion and the production of grey, colourless monoliths. Early private works influenced by these ideas included the D. & D. Warehouse, Centre Street and the Bank of Pakistan in Sauchiehall Street, both in Glasgow.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , p. 483. Public structures included the building to house the Burrell Collection in Glasgow (1981) and the Glasgow Sheriff Court (1980‚Äì86). Since the 1990s there has been a return to some elements of modernism, particularly in major public building projects.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , pp. 496‚Äì7. Recent major public buildings include the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, Glasgow (1997), designed by Norman Foster (1935‚Äì) and known for its segmented, curving roof as \\"the Armadillo\\",A. Murphy and R. Ford, Footprint Glasgow Handbook: The Travel Guide (Bath: Footprint Travel Guides, 2002), , p. 118. and the many striking modern buildings along the side of the River Clyde,N. Wilson and A. Murphy, Scotland (London: Lonely Planet, 5th edn., 2008), , p. 51. such as the Glasgow Science Centre, IMAX Cinema and Glasgow Tower (2001), which is the highest in Scotland.A. C. Theokas, Grounds for Review: The Garden Festival in Urban Planning and Design (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2004), , p. 173. The most important public building of the early twenty-first century is the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh, designed by Enric Miralles (1955‚Äì2000) and opened in 2004, with a design that recalls upturned fishing boats.J. Myerson and P. Ross, Space to Work: New Office Design (London: Laurence King, 2006), , p. 94. There have been increasing attempts to preserve much of what survives from Scotland's architectural heritage, including the great buildings and monuments, but also the classically influenced houses of towns like Edinburgh and GlasgowP. Wilson, \\"A modern material\\", in P. Wilson, ed., Building with Scottish Stone (Edinburgh: Arcamedia, 2005), , p. 5. and the surviving tenements, many of which have been renovated, restored from the black fronts created by pollution to their original pink and honeyed sandstone,D. Howard, ed., William Adam, Volume 1, Volume 17 of The Journal of the Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1990), , p. 112. and brought up to modern standards of accommodation.R. W. Brunskill, Houses and Cottages of Britain (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2nd edn., 2000), , pp. 234‚Äì5. Urban regeneration has also been attempted in areas of post-industrial decline, like the Merchant City in Glasgow, which was returned to housing from the 1980s, with warehouse loft conversions,M. Cowen and C. Lindsey, \\"City centre regeneration in an urban context: the Glasgow experience in the 1980s\\" in J. Berry, S. McGreal, and W. Deddis, eds, Urban Regeneration: Property Investment and Development (London: Taylor & Francis, 1993), , pp. 175‚Äì92. and, more recently, the waterfront in Edinburgh, resulting in a return of resident populations to major urban centres.P. Jones and J. Evans, Urban Regeneration in the UK (Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2008), , pp. 149‚Äì51. Modern housing at Woodend, Aberdeen, built in brick, half timbering can be seen in the distance The 1980s saw the growth of speculative house building by developers. These introduced English brick and half-timbered vernacular styles to Scotland, which had been largely unknown before this period. Many were small and built to minimum standards with little regard to energy or environmental issues. Sales of council houses were popular in Scotland and until the mid-1990s as, unlike in England, local authorities could use the whole of their capital receipts for development.I. Colquhoun, The Riba Book of British Housing Design: 1900 to the Present Day (London: Routledge, 2nd edn., 2008), , p. 319. Under the Scottish Assembly, Scottish Homes was abolished and replaced by Communities Scotland in 2001, which had a responsibility to provide affordable housing and environmental improvement.I. Colquhoun, The Riba Book of British Housing Design: 1900 to the Present Day (London: Routledge, 2nd edn., 2008), , p. 321. In 2011 it was in turn replaced by the Scottish Housing Regulator, whose remit includes Scottish local authority landlords.P. Robson, \\"Housing\\" in E. Sutherland and K. E. Goodall, eds, Law Making and the Scottish Parliament: The Early Years Volume 9 of Edinburgh Studies in Law Series (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2011), , p. 150. As the production of state sponsored housing subsided in the 1970s, there was a return to conservatism in church design, which may have reflected a loss of confidence in the churches as attendances rapidly declined. M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie have identified a \\"post-Coia\\" style emerging in this period.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), , p. 487. The limited number of new buildings, some replacing existing churches, tended to be produced by building companies using laminated timber beams, exposed brickwork and pyramidal roofs to produce utilitarian, if aesthetically unadventurous, constructions. From the late 1980s there were some original designs, including St Mary the Virgin, in Port Glasgow (1984) by Frank Burnet, Bell and Partners; St Anthony's Catholic church in Kirriemuir (1987), by James F. Stephen Architects; and the replacement church at St Joseph's Catholic Church, Faifley (1997) by Jacobsen and French. There was also the postmodern design of St John Ogilvie Catholic Church, Irvine (1982) by Douglas Goodwin Malcolm Niven , and the nearby Girdle Toll parish church (1992), which was converted from a farmhouse.

From 1816 to 1819, he was a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives, serving as speaker from 1817 to 1819. In 1820, he was appointed Kentucky Secretary of State by Governor John Adair. A member of the Breckinridge political family, he was the son of U.S. Attorney General John Breckinridge and the father of Vice President John C. Breckinridge. Born in Albemarle County, Virginia to John Breckinridge (1760-1806) and Mary Hopkins Cabell Breckinridge (1769-1858), Breckinridge moved to Kentucky with his parents in 1793. When John Breckinridge was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1801, Cabell traveled with him to Washington, D.C., and completed preparatory studies at New London Academy (now Colby‚ÄìSawyer College). In 1806, he enrolled in the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). His studies were interrupted in 1807 when he participated in a student protest against the strict rules and rigorous curriculum at the institution, but after a year-long break, he returned and completed his bachelor's degree in 1810. After graduation, he married Mary Clay Smith, daughter of Samuel Stanhope Smith, the university's president. Breckinridge intended to begin practicing law in Lexington, Kentucky, but he enlisted for service in the War of 1812 instead. After the war, he opened his practice and was elected to the Kentucky House, where he led an unsuccessful attempt to oust Gabriel Slaughter after he ascended to the governorship upon the death of George Madison. He served as Speaker of the House from 1817 to 1819, and was appointed as Adair's Secretary of State in 1820. He moved to Frankfort, the state capital, so that he could attend to the duties of his office, but fell ill with a fever in August 1823 and died in office on September 1, 1823. Early life and family Joseph Cabell Breckinridge was born in Albemarle County, Virginia, on July 14, 1788.\\"Secretary of State Joseph Cabell Breckinridge\\". Kentucky Secretary of State He was the second child and first son of John and Mary Hopkins \\"Polly\\" (n√©e Cabell) Breckinridge.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 11 He was named for his maternal grandfather, Joseph Cabell, of Virginia's Cabell political family but was known as \\"Cabell\\" throughout his life.Heck, p. 2 In 1793, the family moved to Lexington, Kentucky. Late in the year, a smallpox epidemic struck the city.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 32 Inoculations came too late, and Breckinridge, his mother, and three of his siblings were infected. Breckinridge, his mother, and his sister Letitia survived, but his sister Mary and brother Robert died. Other than this, historian Lowell H. Harrison wrote that \\"little is known of his boyhood\\", although he speculates that he probably attended some local schools and read from his father's extensive library.Harrison, p. 286 In 1801, when Breckinridge was 12 years old, his father was elected to the U.S. Senate. The family moved to Bedford County, Virginia, where they lived with relatives in order to be closer to the elder Breckinridge during the congressional session at Washington, D.C.. While there, Cabell Breckinridge attended New London Academy (now Colby‚ÄìSawyer College). A case of measles prevented him from attending William and Mary College (now College of William & Mary), his father's alma mater, where his cousin, future Congressman James Breckinridge, was enrolled.Harrison, p. 287 In 1803, he accompanied his father to the capital where he witnessed the debates over the Louisiana Purchase before returning to college in October. After Congress adjourned in March, John Breckinridge met his son in Virginia, and they arrived back at Cabell's Dale, the family estate near Lexington, on April 18, 1804.Harrison, p. 288 He did not return to Virginia with his father in late 1804, instead pursuing preparatory studies under Colonel Samuel Wilson in advance of his enrollment at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). Studies at Princeton University Breckinridge's father, John, died in 1806 while he was away at college. Breckinridge arrived in Princeton, New Jersey, in late December 1805.Harrison, p. 289 He had completed his final exams by April 5, but he declined his father's offer to come to Washington because he needed to catch up on his studies in arithmetic.Harrison, p. 293 When the next term began in May, he joined the American Whig‚ÄìCliosophic Society, a debating society founded by James Madison, Philip Freneau, Aaron Burr, and Henry Lee in 1769.Harrison, p. 296 In mid-1806, Cabell learned that his father was sick.Harrison, p. 297 Not long after, however, he received word that his father was improving and expected to meet him in Virginia en route to the capital. Although a rendezvous location had not been set, he assumed it would be in Lynchburg, where the Breckinridges had relatives. In October, he traveled to his uncle Lewis Breckinridge's home to wait for his father, but he never came.Harrison, p. 298 Disappointed, he returned to Princeton for the beginning of the new term, unaware that his father's recovery had been short- lived. Later he learned that his father had attempted to leave Cabell's Dale on October 22 but collapsed off his horse and returned to his sick bed; he died December 14, 1806. In January 1807, travelers from Kentucky finally brought news of John Breckinridge's death.Harrison, p. 299 Despite Cabell's declaration to a relative that, \\"I consider my life dedicated to my mother's ease\\", Breckinridge continued his studies.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 95 John Breckinridge died intestate, complicating the settlement of his estate and creating financial difficulties for Cabell, who had been receiving support from his father.Harrison, p. 300 Desperate, he appealed to Alfred Grayson, his sister Letitia's husband and son of Senator William Grayson, for assistance.Harrison, p. 301 In March 1807, about 125 students organized a protest against the college's strict conduct policies and rigorous study requirements.Harrison, p. 302 The protest included signing a formal petition of protest; college administrators subsequently suspended everyone who refused to withdraw his name from the petition. Breckinridge was required to apologize for his part in the protest in order to return to school, but he refused to do so. In May, he left Princeton for Cabell's Dale, but in Philadelphia he found that there were no available stages heading west for two weeks.Harrison, p. 306 Unable to afford room and board for that long, he went to Fincastle, Virginia, to stay with relatives. He considered enrolling at the College of William and Mary for the fall term in 1807, believing he could complete his studies in nine months but ultimately decided against it.Harrison, p. 307 Harrison surmises that the lack of correspondence between Breckinridge and his family in Kentucky between July 1807 to July 1808 indicated that he was at Cabell's Dale during most or all of that period. By July 1808, Breckinridge had decided to return to Princeton in October to finish his studies. His roommate, James G. Birney, and the university president, Samuel Stanhope Smith, were both ardent abolitionists, and through their influence, he became convinced that slavery must be ended, but only by voluntary emancipation, not by government interference.Davis, p. 8 He completed his bachelor's degree in 1810.Harrison, p. 311 Marriage and law practice While completing his degree, Breckinridge began courting Mary Clay Smith, the daughter the university president and granddaughter of John Witherspoon, a signer of the Declaration of Independence.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 96 After graduation, he journeyed home, but returned to Princeton where he and Smith were married on May 11, 1811.Heck, p. 3 The couple had five children - Frances (b. 1812), Caroline (b. 1813), Mary Cabell (b. 1815), John Cabell (b. 1821), and Laetitia (b. 1822).Davis, p. 9 John Cabell Breckinridge went on to represent Kentucky in both houses of Congress, was elected Vice President of the United States in 1856, and was the fifth and final Confederate States Secretary of War.Klotter in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, pp. 117-118 After attending wedding celebrations with friends and relatives in Princeton, Philadelphia, and New York City, the couple moved in with Breckinridge's widowed mother at Cabell's Dale. Before Breckinridge could commence practice, the U.S. entered the War of 1812.Collins, p. 198 He was commissioned a major and served as aide-de-camp under Samuel Hopkins. He would later refer to the war as \\"a foolish and ineffectual brace of campaigns on the Illinois and Wabash\\". After the war, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky, was admitted to the bar in 1814, and opened a practice in Lexington. Concurrent with his practice, he served as a professor of religion.Collins, p. 199 He also helped found the Second Presbyterian Church in Lexington and became one of its ruling elders. In 1815, he purchased Thorn Hill, a home in Lexington, from John W. Hunt. Political career John Adair appointed Breckinridge Secretary of State in 1820. In 1816, Breckinridge was elected as a Democratic-Republican to represent Fayette Countyin the Kentucky House of Representatives, gaining the largest majority given to a candidate for office in that county to that point. Historian Lewis Collins notes that Breckinridge's legislative career began during the national \\"Era of Good Feelings\\", largely congruent with the presidency of James Monroe, when political disagreements were relatively few. Nevertheless, dissension erupted in Kentucky in October 1816 after the death of Governor George Madison just three weeks into his term.Powell, p. 24 Lieutenant Governor Gabriel Slaughter, as acting governor, rescinded Madison's appointment of Charles Stewart Todd as Secretary of State, replacing him with former Senator John Pope, who was unpopular because of his vote against declaring the War of 1812. Slaughter followed this up by appointing Martin D. Hardin, widely regarded as a Federalist despite his nominal identification with the Democratic-Republicans, to fill the Senate vacancy caused by the resignation of William T. Barry.Dorman, p. 345 Both appointments were unpopular in the state, and on January 27, 1817, Breckinridge formed a coalition of legislators in the House that sponsored a bill to elect \\"a governor to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of\\" Madison, essentially an attempt to oust Slaughter from the governorship.Hopkins, p. 23 The bill passed the House by a vote of 56‚Äì30, but the Senate refused to concur. Madison's death was the first time the lieutenant governor succeeded permanently to the governorship, establishing the precedent for future instances. Nevertheless, several anti-Slaughter candidates were elected in the 1817 legislative elections. Breckinridge was re-elected in both 1817 and 1818 and was chosen Speaker of the House both years. In 1820, Breckinridge's friend, newly elected Governor John Adair, appointed him as Kentucky Secretary of State.Davis, p. 10 Of this appointment, historian William C. Davis wrote, \\"It was a prestigious, albeit not too influential, position and would require his full-time presence at the capital.\\" He remained in Lexington until the birth of his son in January 1821; in February, the family moved to the Governor's Mansion in Frankfort to live with Adair. Although his mother opposed the move to Frankfort, he intended for it to be permanent; an acquaintance wrote that \\"his plans were extensive and his hopes high\\" for his family's life in the state capital. In addition to his duties as secretary of state, he continued to practice law. Death Throughout his term, Breckinridge's health became increasingly fragile. When an illness described in contemporary accounts as \\"the prevailing fever\\" struck Lexington in 1823, he took the children to Cabell's Dale to prevent them from becoming ill. When he returned in late August, he contracted the fever. Despite the care of his brother, John, and the local doctors, he died on September 1, 1823, just over a week after falling ill.Davis, p. 11 Originally buried on the grounds at Cabell's Dale, he and several family members were re- interred at Lexington Cemetery near the grave of his brother Robert Jefferson Breckinridge.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 303 Breckinridge left behind $15,000 in debts, and with the nation still in the throes of the Panic of 1819, his assets were not enough to pay off the obligations. His wife, who also fell ill and was pregnant with the couple's sixth child, was so depressed because of his death and her subsequent financial straits that she suffered a miscarriage. She and the children moved in with Cabell's widowed mother at Cabell's Dale.Heck, p. 5 For several years, she was dependent upon her in-laws for survival; Breckinridge's brother, Robert, assumed Cabell's debts, which he paid in full in 1832.Heck, p. 4 References Bibliography  * * * Category:1788 births Category:1823 deaths Category:American army personnel of the War of 1812 Category:American Presbyterians Category:American religion academics Category:Breckinridge family Category:Fathers of Vice Presidents of the United States Category:Infectious disease deaths in Kentucky Category:Kentucky Democratic- Republicans Category:Kentucky lawyers Category:People from Albemarle County, Virginia Category:People from Kentucky in the War of 1812 Category:Princeton University alumni Category:Secretaries of State of Kentucky Category:Speakers of the Kentucky House of Representatives Category:Colby‚ÄìSawyer College alumni Category:19th-century American politicians Category:United States Army officers ","title":"Cabell Breckinridge"},{"id":"37880816","text":"Lilliu may refer to: *Giovanni Lilliu (1914‚Äì2012), Italian archeologist, academician, publicist and politician *Nyco Lilliu (born 1987), French singer *Pierrick Lilliu (born 1986), French singer ","title":"Lilliu"},{"id":"37880817","text":"Antoine de Bosc de la Calmette G√©rard Pierre Antoine de Bosc de la Calmette, often referred to as Antoine de la Calmette, (21 September 1752 - 7 April 1803) was a Danish County Governor, geheimrat, and landowner.

His mother was Antoinette Elisabeth de Godin.\\"Bosc de la Calmette\\", Roskildes Historie. Retrieved 10 December 2012. During the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, he was with his brother, Charles Louis de Bosc de la Calmette; they were saved by their governess who rescued them from a burning building. He came with his parents to Denmark in 1759 when his father was transferred to Copenhagen. About 1770, the Calmette family acquired the 15th century royal farm of S√∏markeg√•rd, a swampy area at the northeastern end of M√∏ns Klint. The father also acquired Marienborg Manor on M√∏n which he left to Antoine when he died in 1781. In 1777, Calmette married Anna Catharina Elisabeth (Lisa) Baroness Iselin (1759-1805), the daughter of Reinhard Iselin, a highly successful Swiss merchant employed by the Danish State. In 1781, she inherited Rosenfeldt Manor, just west of Vordingborg. Career In 1769, Calmette held the rank of Cornet. In 1772, he served as captain of a cavalry regiment. In 1774, he was appointed chamberlain, and in 1777, he was naturalized as a Danish nobleman. In 1783, he became governor of M√∏n (M√∏n Amt) and in 1794, also of Nyk√∏bing. In 1793 (or 1801), he received the Order of the Dannebrog. Calmette also took an interest in prehistoric monuments, excavating M√∏n's Neolithic burial mound, Klekkende H√∏j, in 1797 while he was governor. In 1803, he was elevated to the position of Geheimrat. Contribution to art Calmette's wife, Lisa Calmette was a figure of his time, inspired by the Age of Enlightenment and by philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He had also taken a specific interest in the gardens and parks of England and France. While he was a competent draftsman and painter, his masterpiece was the layout and landscaping of S√∏markeg√•rd, renamed Liselund after his wife. In 1783, together with his wife, he developed a Romantic garden with winding paths, lakes and canals, and buildings of various styles, fully in accordance with the ideals of the times. While travelling widely across Europe in 1790, he had been attracted by the style of the romantic English landscape garden, a favourite with the nobility of the day.

He is amongst the most popular characters in English literature. Pip narrates his story many years after the events of the novel take place. The novel follows Pip's process from childhood innocence to adulthood. The financial and social rise of the protagonist is accompanied by an emotional and moral deterioration, which forces Pip to recognize his negative expectations in a new self-awareness. Characterization When the novel begins in the early 1800s, Philip is a seven-year-old orphan raised by his uncaring sister, \\"Mrs. Joe\\", who beats him regularly, and her husband Joe Gargery, a blacksmith and Pip's best friend. He lives in the marsh area of Kent, England, twenty miles from the sea. Pip has no recollection of either of his parents; he is more than twenty years younger than his sister. Five brothers died in infancy between them: Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias and Roger. He is known to himself and to the world as Pip, because his \\"infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip\\". The opening scene of the novel shows Pip in a graveyard paying his respects to the graves of his parents and brothers. He says he is small for his age when he encounters the convicts at age seven, but when he is apprenticed to Joe, he is taller and becomes very strong to master the work of a blacksmith. Pip is destined for, and wants, a career as a blacksmith like his brother-in-law, until an unexpected chain of events thrusts him into a different social class. Pip goes through many changes in his personality as he is influenced by various characters. As the novel begins, he is an innocent young boy who does not mind his low rank in society. At around the age of eight, he meets a beautiful but proud girl named Estella who is of the upper class. Pip falls in love with her and becomes very ashamed of his humble background and his coarse-seeming relatives. When he is old enough he is bound apprentice to Joe. But he longs to be a gentleman, in a social class inaccessible to a village blacksmith. He suffers guilt for his ungrateful feelings toward Joe, who is a kind friend to him throughout his life. When, four years into his apprenticeship, a mysterious benefactor enables him to escape the working class, Pip moves to London as a teenager to become a gentleman. In his youth, he believes that his patron is Estella's guardian Miss Havisham, who wants to make him a suitable contender for her ward's hand. Once he moves to London, though his benefactor is not named, Pip persists in believing that Miss Havisham means him to marry Estella. He is not wise in spending the money he gets before he comes of age at 21, running up debts. His legal guardian is Mr Jaggers, a lawyer, who points out the difficulties Pip creates, but leaves it to Pip to guide his own life. He does not entirely lose his good character, which is expressed mainly in his relationship with his friend Herbert Pocket. Two years after Pip comes of age his benefactor appears in person, and it is Abel Magwitch, the convict he met as a boy. This deflates his hope that he is meant for Estella and at first disgusts him. He knows nothing about what sort of criminal the man is. Despite his disgust and disappointment, the sense of duty that compels Pip to help the convict is a mark of his inner goodness, just as it was when Pip first met him at age seven. After Abel Magwitch dies and the Crown confiscates his fortune, Pip, aged 23, understands that good clothes, genteel speech and a generous allowance do not make one a gentleman. At one point he was on the verge of being sent to debtor's prison, but the law granted him a reprieve due to his succumbing to an illness. Joe learns of this and comes to London to look after Pip until Pip is able to walk on his own. While recuperating, he finds a receipt stating that his outstanding debt was amortized by Joe and Biddy. A few days after Joe leaves, Pip goes home to find that Biddy has married Joe that very day (Pip's sister having died from being hurt in a burglary, then succumbing to her injuries years later). Without income or training for any profession, he is at loose ends. Herbert Pocket suggests Pip join the firm where he works, in an office in Cairo. Pip starts as a clerk. Herbert marries his fiancee Clara Pocket, and Pip lives with them. There is irony in this, as Pip used his gift at age 21 of 500 pounds to engage Herbert with the new firm, despite the fact he was being dogged by creditors. Working for a merchant named Clarriker, Pip finally learns discipline and financial responsibility, and is now more careful. Eleven years later, Pip returns to England to see Joe, Biddy and their children, a daughter and a son named after him, or a \\"little Pip\\". He walks to the land where Miss Havisham's house once stood and meets Estella there. Both have changed much from their experience of life. After they reconcile, they hold hands, and Pip sees no shadow to part them again. Role in adaptations The novel has been adapted into films often.

He played college football at the University of Michigan from 1967 to 1969. Early years Cecil Pryor was born in Nueces County, Texas, in 1947, the son of Cecil L. Pryor, Sr., and Fannie McCuller. He was the eldest of four children including his brother, Rundy Pryor and his two sisters, Leah Pryor and Barbara Pryor (Tatum). Birth record for Cecil Lemuel Pryor, born October 7, 1947 in Nueces County. Ancestry.com. Texas Birth Index, 1903-1997 [database on-line]. He was raised in Corpus Christi, Texas, and attended King High School. The major schools in Texas did not recruit African-American players at the time, and Pryor opted instead to play football at the University of Michigan, where a former coach Y C McNease had become an assistant coach under Bump Elliott. Michigan He played for the Michigan Wolverines football team from 1967 to 1969. He was recruited as a quarterback, but began his collegiate career as a linebacker for the 1967 Michigan Wolverines football team. As a junior, he started eight games at defensive right end and one at offensive right end for the last Michigan football team coached by Bump Elliott. Bo Schembechler took over as Michigan's head coach for Pryor's senior season. Pryor started all 11 games at right defensive end for the 1969 Michigan Wolverines football team and also started two games at the end position on offense. He played in the 1969 Michigan vs. Ohio State football game, considered one of the biggest upsets in college football history. The unranked Wolverines defeated the No. 1 Buckeyes by a 24-12 score. The day before the game, a fight broke out between players from the two teams as they passed each other in the tunnel at Michigan Stadium. Schembechler and Woody Hayes separated the players, and Schembechler later wrote that he knew his players no longer feared the Buckeyes when he heard Cecil Pryor yell, \\"And we're gonna kick your ass tomorrow, too!\\" Pryor proved to be one of the defensive standouts of the game. Sports Illustrated noted at the time: \\"The Wolverines' ends, [Mike] Keller and Cecil Pryor, kept [Rex] Kern so well contained that he gained only 28 yards in 11 runs after his initial 25-yard effort.\\" Pryor also recovered an Ohio State fumble in the final minute to seal the victory. Interviewed in 1993, Pryor recalled, \\"That was probably the greatest game I ever participated in my life, and I had been playing since the fourth grade.\\" With the victory over Ohio State, Michigan won the Big Ten Conference's spot in the 1970 Rose Bowl. Pryor showed his sense of humor in the pregame introductions for the Rose Bowl. Teammate Jim Brandstatter recalled, \\"When it was Cecil's time for his intro, he looked directly into the camera, and with a serious, professorial scowl said, 'Cecil Pryor, defensive end, Corpus Christi, Texas, senior, majoring in nuclear physics.'\\" According to Brandstatter, \\"Cecil hadn't been anywhere near the physics building in his four years at Michigan.\\" On the field, the team learned shortly before the game that coach Schembechler had suffered a heart attack the night before the game and was in the hospital. The team was reported to be \\"an emotional wreck\\", with Pryor crying at the news. Playing in his final game for Michigan, Pryor led the team with 15 tackles, but the Wolverines's offense was unable to get on track, and Michigan lost by a score of 10-3.(To retrieve Marsh's statistics, enter \\"pryor\\" in the space for \\"Enter last name\\" and \\"cecil\\" in the space for \\"Enter first name.\\") After the game, a writer in The Michigan Daily wrote that the Pryor had been accused of \\"dogging it\\" in the past, but not against USC: \\"His detractors should have seen him in the Rose Bowl. Putting his awesome physical talents to use Pryor was a demon on defense.\\" Pryor was selected in 1969 as a second-team All-Big Ten Conference player. He was also selected to play in the 10th annual Coaches All-American football game in June 1970. During his collegiate career at Michigan, Pryor totaled 106 tackles, nine tackles for loss, three pass breakups and four fumble recoveries. Professional football Pryor was drafted in the fifth round of the 1970 NFL Draft by the Green Bay Packers. He was cut by the Packers in early September 1970 prior to the opening of the 1970 NFL season. He also tried out with, and was cut by, the Philadelphia Eagles. In 1971, Pryor attended pre-season camp with the New York Giants, but he was cut by the team in August. He joined the Chicago Bears in 1972 and remained with the team through the pre-season. However, he was cut in early September 1972. In May 1973, he signed to play for the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League. He played for the Alouettes under head coach Marv Levy as part of the team's starting front four during the 1973 CFL season. He sustained a cheek injury in a game against Ottawa and was waived through the league and dropped in early September 1973. Pryor played with the Memphis Grizzlies of the World Football League during the 1974 and 1975 seasons. Later years After retiring from football, Pryor returned to Ann Arbor to complete his degree.

He chaired the panel of three judges that presided over the Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal until his resignation on 11 December 2012. Personal history Nizamul Huq is the son of Nurul Huq, his father, and Asia Khatun, his mother. He attended the Patuakhali Government Jubilee High School in the Patuakhali District. Career Nizamul Huq was a treasurer and lawyer for the Bangladesh human rights organisation Odhikar (Anglicized also as Adhikar) before joining the High Court. Huq was first appointed judge of the High Court by President Shahabuddin Ahmed, a former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Huq was reappointed to the High Court by President Zillur Rahman, on 24 March 2009. Huq was a member of the Secretariat of the People's Commission, which prepared evidence in 1994 before the tribunal about the defendants, over whom Huq would later preside, and he later deliberated on the report as evidence during the war crimes trials. Afterward, he was appointed as the head of the International Crimes Tribunal on 25 March 2010, and he resigned amid a controversy on 11 December 2012 after his Skype calls with Ahmed Ziauddin were revealed by Amar Desh and The Economist. He was replaced by Fazle Kabir. Afterward he rejoined the High Court and hears civil cases. The Skype controversy Nizamul Huq resigned his position for \\"personal reasons\\" and shortly after the release of the full 17 hours of Skype conversations and 230 emails between himself and Ziauddin to news sources. From December 2012 until March 2013, it was unknown who had obtained access to the Skype conversations and emails or how those materials were obtained, although the publishers of the content were first suspected. In 2013, journalist David Bergman reported that he had learned that Huq had transferred his entire computer drive over multiple computers and a US-based security firm said people with legal access to those drives gave its agents the files. In the New Age article, Bergman quotes James Mulvaney, who is from Guardian Consulting LLC and the private security firm that was given the materials by an unnamed source, says: The company said it had been paid $100,000 by a client who questioned the neutrality of Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal. The war crimes court accused The Economist and Amar Desh of \\"hacking\\" Huq's computers. The Economist said in its article \\"The trial of the birth of a nation\\" (12 December 2012) that it would not normally publish private correspondence, denied that it had paid for the materials and acknowledged issues of press ethics, but it cited \\"public interest\\" behind its decision. The magazine wrote, \\"These emails, if genuine, would indeed raise questions about the working of the court and we are bound to investigate them as fully as we can.\\" It further wrote about its coverage of the cache,\\"There is a risk not only of a miscarriage of justice affecting the individual defendants, but also that the wrongs which Bangladesh has already suffered will be aggravated by the flawed process of the tribunal. That would not heal the country's wounds, but deepen them.\\" The court called the UK magazine's article on the Skype conversation \\"interference\\" and a \\"violation\\" of privacy and ordered its representatives to appear before the court in Bangladesh to answer for contempt of court. The further publication of verbatim quotes from the Skype conversations between Nizamul Huq and Ahmed Ziauddin by the Bangladesh newspaper Amar Desh revealed government intervention into the judiciary and Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal, which Huq led. Huq said in the widely available video (as quoted from Foreign Policy magazine, 21 December 2012) that the Awami League-led government is \\"absolutely crazy for a judgment. The government has gone totally mad. They have gone completely mad, I am telling you. They want a judgment by 16th December... It's as simple as that.\\" Later in the video, he admits that he publicly met with an appointed minister from the government and was pressured by that minister for quick verdicts. Huq said, the minister \\"came to visit me this evening. He asked me to pass this verdict fast. I told him 'how can I do that?'... He said, 'Try as quick as you can.'\\" The newspaper Amar Desh also published emails from Huq to Ziauddin. A sedition charge was filed on 14 December 2012 against Amar Desh editor Mahmudur Rahman. The government arrested Mahmudur Rahman, editor of the Amar Desh on 11 April 2013 for sedition and cyber crimes involving the Skype videos and their publication in his newspaper. In December 2012, the court by order suppressed the media from publishing materials or accounts of those Skype conversations.

Career Hoshino was appointed professor at Tokyo Imperial University in 1888. Historical work had previously been carried out in a government department dedicated to writing the official history of Japan, but it was decided in 1888 to move this work to the university. Hoshino, Kume Kunitake, and Shigeno Yasutsugu were the first three history professors appointed. Hoshino and Kume took opposite views on the historical treatment of Japanese mythology: Hoshino held that the Age of the Gods was a historical age, in which actual historical events took place and had been recorded, whereas Kume argued the founding myths were allegorical, and promoted a more skeptical, scientific approach to history. Hoshino, Kume, and Shigeno nonetheless all shared a general belief in taking a more scholarly, scientific approach to history, and Hoshino joined the others in criticizing the emphasis on heroic myths in Japanese history. After Kume attacked state Shinto in an 1892 article deemed offensive by the government, Kume was expelled from the university, and the Department of Japanese History was closed. The latter may have also been due in part to the government's decreased interest in the project of writing a grand history of Japan, especially one written in kanbun. The government recreated a history institute at Tokyo Imperial University in 1895, and brought Hoshino back as its first head. This new department, which would become the Historiographical Institute, had a narrower mission devoted to compiling historical documents, and no longer included the project of writing an overall history of Japan. Hoshino disapproved of the reduction in scope, since he remained one of the few supporters of a grand history in kanbun. He nonetheless served as the Institute's first head, from 1895 to 1899.

Co. v. Dunlevy, 241 U.S. 518 (1916), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court held that a court can exert personal jurisdiction over a nonresident party in an interpleader if that party is served with process while physically present within the state.N.Y. Life Ins. Co. v. Dunlevy, . Factual and procedural background Joseph W. Gould, obtained a life insurance policy on his life from New York Life Insurance Company which his daughter, Effie J. Gould Dunlevy, claimed had been assigned to her in 1893. At that time both Mr Gould and his daughter were citizens and domiciliaries of Pennsylvania. In 1907, Boggs & Buhl, a law firm, recovered a valid default judgment against Mrs. Dunlevy, in the Common Pleas Court at Pittsburgh here she then resided, after obtaining personal jurisdiction domiciliary service, During 1909, \\"the tontine dividend period\\" of the life insurance policy having expired, the insurance company became liable for $2,479.70, and this sum was claimed both by Gould, and his daughter, Mrs. Dunlevy, who had moved to California and became a domiciliary there. In November, 1909, Boggs & Buhl caused issue of an execution attachment on their judgment in Court of Common Pleas at Pittsburgh and both the insurance company and Gould were summoned as garnishees. He appeared, denied assignment of the policy, and claimed the full amount due thereon. On January 14, 1910 Mrs. Dunlevy instituted this suit in the Superior Court, Marin County, California, against the insurance company and to recover $2,479.70, the surrender value of a policy on his life which she claimed had been assigned to her, and both were duly served with process while in that state. On February 5, 1910, after this suit was begun in California, the company answered, admitted its indebtedness, set up the conflicting claims to the fund, and prayed to be advised as to its rights. At the same time it filed a petition asking for an interpleader, and thereby ascertain who was lawfully entitled to the proceeds, and, further, that it might be allowed to pay amount due into court for benefit of proper party.on March 21, 1910 an order granted the requested, and directed that notice be given to Mrs. Dunlevy in California. This was done, but she made no answer and did not appear. Later, the insurance company filed a second petition, and, upon leave obtained thereunder, paid $2,479.70 into court, . All parties except Mrs. Dunlevy having appeared, the suit was tried on a feigned issue to determine validity of alleged transfer of the policy. The jury found, October 1, 1910, there was no valid assignment, and thereupon, under a court order the fund was paid over to Gould. The California suit was removed to the United States district court, February 16, 1910, and tried there by the judge in May, 1912, a jury having been expressly waived. The judgment for Mrs. Dunlevy in amount claimed was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.N.Y. Life Ins. Co. v. Dunlevy, In 1909 under Pennsylvania law, a judgment debtor is not a party to a garnishment proceeding to condemn a claim due the judgment debtor from a third person, nor is the judgment debtor bound by a judgment discharging the garnishee. Issue and result The Supreme Court was asked to determine whether the Pennsylvania proceeding was a bar to the action in California. The Supreme Court found for Dunlevy; holding A party to an action does not, after final judgment, still remain in court and subject, without further personal service, to whatsoever orders may be entered under the title of that cause. Interpleader proceedings brought by a garnishee are not essential concomitants of the original action in which the judgment was rendered on which the garnishment is based, but are collateral, and require personal service on the judgment debtor. Smith v. Woolfolk, ; Reynolds v. Stockton, ; Owens v. Henry, ; Hovey v. Elliott, ; Freeman on Judgments, 4th ed., ¬ß 143. Any personal judgment which a state court may render against one not voluntarily submitting to its jurisdiction, nor a domiciliary of the state nor served with process within its border, no matter what the mode of service, is void because the court has no personal jurisdiction. Pennoyer v. Neff, . Subsequent history The Federal Interpleader Act of 1917 was enacted by the 64th United States Congress approved February 22, 1917 to over come this problem in this case for insurance companies to bring an interpleader against beneficiaries in different states. Federal Interpleader Act of 1917 allowed an insurance company, or fraternal benefit society subject to multiple claims on the same policy to file a suit in equity by a bill of interpleader in United States District Courts and providing nationwide service of process, minimal diversity jurisdiction of two or more of the beneficiaries must live in different states and a lower amount in controversy of at least $500.

Initially developed as a fan game, Street Fighter X Mega Man later received support from Capcom, who assisted in the production of the game. Street Fighter X Mega Man was released as a free download from Capcom Unity on December 17, 2012. It celebrates the 25th anniversary of both Capcom's Mega Man and Street Fighter franchises. Gameplay mimicks the design of classic Mega Man games with Street Fighter characters substituting as important enemies encountered in the game. The game received mixed to positive reviews by critics, with some common complaints relating to technical issues and a lack of a save feature. In response to the complaints, an update was released on January 28, 2013 titled Street Fighter X Mega Man V2, which added a password save feature and other fixes. Premise and gameplay Mega Man battling Dhalsim Street Fighter X Mega Man mimics the appearance and gameplay style of Mega Man games released on the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game's premise and plot center around its status as a crossover video game and the respective anniversaries of both franchises. Having fought countless Robot Masters over the years, Mega Man is ready to lie back, relax and enjoy his 25th anniversary. Getting wind of this, Ryu and his fellow Street Fighters want one last battle before they let their own anniversary finish. In terms of gameplay, Mega Man uses the same set of moves (the slide and the charge shot) featured in Mega Man 4. Instead of using stages based on Mega Man and using Robot Masters as level bosses, the stages share influences from the Street Fighter franchise stages and characters such as Blanka, Chun-Li, and Ryu take the place of the Robot Masters as the end of level bosses. The Street Fighter characters use their signature moves as attacks; in addition, they have their own Super Meters that build up when they take damage during the boss fights and allow them to launch a powerful attack at Mega Man once filled. Like other Mega Man games, defeating each boss earns Mega Man a new weapon based on the characters' attacks, such as Ryu's Hadouken and Chun-Li's Hyakuretsu Kyaku. After clearing the eight main levels, the player then moves on to face the final set of bosses. Clearing certain conditions allows players to fight hidden bosses Sagat and Akuma at the end of the game. Development The game began as the private development of Seow Zong Hui who presented an early build to Christian Svensson, Capcom's Senior VP of consumer software, at EVO 2012. Svensson showed the build to several staff members in the Capcom office (including senior community manager Brett Elston), and Capcom later decided to assist in the development of the game. While Zong Hui continued to develop the game based on his original design, Capcom took over tasks such as funding, marketing, and quality assurance. Capcom decided to distribute the game on PC instead of gaming consoles because Zong Hui did not have a license for console development. Svensson has noted that Capcom will consider console releases in the future, but chose to initially distribute the game on PC to keep the game free for fans and meet its December 17 target release date. Zong Hui noted several concepts that were scrapped during development. Yang was originally planned as a boss character but was ultimately replaced by Chun-Li. His special weapon is still included in the game via cheat codes. Zong Hui also wanted to include alternate costumes for boss characters and a second playable character from the Street Fighter franchise. Following release, there were several complaints about the game crashing, having a vague user interface, and lacking any save system. In response to these complaints, Svensson noted that a patch was being discussed with the development team to address these issues in a future update. An updated version was released on January 28, 2013 under the name, Street Fighter X Mega Man V2. The update boasts an improved user interface, better controller compatibility, bug fixes, a password save system reminiscent of the original Mega Man games on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and an additional boss character. Music Chiptune artist Luke Esquivel (\\"A_Rival\\") composed the music for the game. Esquivel became involved when he approached Zong Hui via YouTube and requested to being full-time musician for the game in 2009/2010 after comparing his music with Zong Hui's previous musician. When composing the music for Street Fighter X Mega Man, Esquivel combined Mega Man themes with Street Fighter themes on certain songs. In other songs, he would use elements from various Mega Man songs in order not to break the cohesion of the original soundtrack. Esquivel based most of the sounds on the first two Mega Man games, but had also used sounds from Mega Man 3, 4, and 5. Esquivel also added original compositions within several songs including two completely original compositions: \\"Willy Map Theme\\" and the beginning of the \\"Ending\\" theme. The soundtrack blends popular themes from both franchises together (such as mixing Snake Man's theme from Mega Man 3 with Dhalsim's theme from Street Fighter II). The official soundtrack titled Street Fighter X Mega Man OST was released for free on Esquivel's website on December 18, 2012. An EP with a total of four tracks titled Street Fighter X Mega Man X-tended Vol. 1 was released on February 8, 2013. Reception Two days after release, Capcom Senior VP Christian Svensson commented on the official Capcom website, Capcom-Unity, that the game has exceeded his personal expectations in terms of downloads, but no exact numbers have been released. Capcom's Senior Community Manager, Brett Elston, noted that the number of downloads during release was enough to cause significant strain on their servers. By March 3, 2013, the game had been downloaded one million times. Street Fighter X Mega Man has been met with mostly mixed to positive reviews. Cheat Code Central gave the game a 4.1 out of 5, praising the nostalgic feel the game has, but criticized the lack of a save feature. Game Informer gave the game an 8 out of 10, summarizing that \\"Street Fighter X Mega Man pales in comparison to the rest of the classic entries, but it‚Äôs still a wonderful test of the waters for newcomers and a charming experiment for lifelong fans.\\" Inside Gaming Daily gave the game an 8 out of 10, stating, \\"Though it‚Äôs short and strays away a bit from traditional Mega Man games, Street Fighter X Mega Man is a great play that you honestly have little reason not to experience.\\" IGN gave the game a 7 out of 10, noting that \\"The end result is a fine game that Mega Man fans will enjoy once or twice, but one without that special something that would allow it to rise to the greatness Mega Man so regularly reached in its heyday.\\" Destructoid echoed similar opinions stating, \\"Street Fighter X Mega Man is not the best or most polished Mega Man game around, but it's a solid effort by a very dedicated fan.\\" Game Industry News gave it a 3.5 out of 5 with mixed review stating, \\"It combines two of Capcom's greatest games in history into one nostalgic mash up that is sure to take fans on a trip down memory lane while still feeling fresh. Unfortunately though, the lack of challenge or the ability to continue progress after shutting down the game only hinders Street Fighter X Mega Man from being the perfect jewel it could have been.\\" Edge however gave the game a 5 out of 10, noting \\"inconsistent level design and limited functionality\\" as the game's biggest flaws.

The MAS is highly intelligent and biddable. The breed is often trained for dog sports such as herding, agility, obedience, canine freestyle, flyball, and others. In September 2019, the FCI officially accepted the breed.Miniature American Shepherd. Federation Cynologique Internationale.  History  The Miniature American Shepherd was developed in California during the late 1960s with the breeding of small, unregistered dogs that were thought to be Australian Shepherds. These dogs were bred with a goal of maintaining their small size, active character, and intelligence. The breed was first registered with the National Stock Dog Registry in 1983 and was originally called the Miniature Australian Shepherd. By the early 1990s, the breed had attained nationwide popularity. Several clubs promoted these small dogs, as they were registered and shown with various rare-breed organizations. The first parent breed club and registry, MASCUSA, was formed in 1990 and incorporated in 1993. The breed entered the AKC Foundation Stock Service as the Miniature American Shepherd in May 2011. The Miniature American Shepherd Club of the USA (MASCUSA) is the designated national parent club of the American Kennel Club. In the U.K., the official daughter club of MASCUSA is known as UKMASC. UKMASC was founded in 2011 and, although the breed is not yet recognised by the U.K. Kennel Club, UKMASC is dedicated to sound and responsible breeding practices and the promotion of the breed in the U.K. The breed has been used for herding smaller stock such as sheep and goats, although they have the heart to tackle larger livestock as well. Their small size was looked upon with favor, as they could more easily double as a household pet. They became especially popular with equestrians traveling to horse shows, as their intelligence, loyalty, and size made them an excellent travel companion. In this way their popularity spread across the country. Today, the Miniature American Shepherd is established across the U.S. and internationally. It is a breed with a unique identity‚Äîan eye catching, versatile little herding dog, equally at home on a ranch or in the city. The Miniature American Shepherd is a herding dog to be designated to the Herding Group in the American Kennel Club.  Breed characteristics   Body structure  The Miniature American Shepherd is a small dog, with the breed standard specifying a height of 14-18 inches (36‚Äì46 cm) for males and 13-17 inches (33‚Äì43 cm) for females. Body structure suggests strength, but not bulkiness, with a clean-cut head and neck proportional to the body. The topline is level from withers to hip joint. The tail may be undocked, a natural bobtail, or may be docked to a length not exceeding three inches.  Coat  The coat is of medium length and may be straight or wavy, with moderate feathering present on the backs of the legs. Both sexes have a moderate mane and frill, though it is generally more pronounced in males than in females. The undercoat varies according to the climate in which the dog dwells. Recognized coat colors in the breed are black, blue merle, red merle, and red (liver). There are no specified quantities of marbling, flecking, or blotching for merle coats. Tan markings are permissible anywhere around the eyes and face, as well as on the feet, legs, chest, muzzle, underside of the neck and body, under the tail and on the undersides of the ears. White markings are permissible, but limited to the muzzle, cheeks, crown of the head, in a blaze on the head, in a partial or full collar on the neck and on the belly, chest, front legs and hind legs to the hock. White markings should not cover more than 25% of the ear and white body markings outside of the above permitted areas may disqualify the dog from competition.  Temperament  The Miniature American Shepherd is described as an intelligent working breed with strong instincts for herding and flock guarding. It is easy to train, enthusiastic and persistent toward its work, and is protective, devoted and loyal to its family. The Miniature American Shepherd is neither shy nor aggressive; any aggressive behavior is a disqualifying characteristic per the AKC. Health  The MAS has an expected lifespan of 12‚Äì15 years. Several chronic diseases and detrimental genetic traits are known to exist within the MAS gene pool, including progressive retinal atrophy (PRA-prcd), hereditary cataracts, iris coloboma, micropthalmia, multi-drug resistance gene (MDR1), hip dysplasia, and degenerative myelopathy.

It was among the largest and the most prestigious synagogues in Croatia. Ha-Kol (Glasilo ≈Ωidovske zajednice u Hrvatskoj); Druga vinkovaƒçka sinagoga; stranica 35, 36, 37, 38, 39; broj 97, studeni / prosinac 2006. The Jewish community Vinkovci was established with the arrival of the first Jews in 1873, and the first synagogue was built in 1880. The growth of the Jewish community in Vinkovci, as well as its tangible affirmation in the society, made the first synagogue insufficient. The first initiative to build a new synagogue appeared in 1911. Construction was scheduled to begin as soon as the financial structure was completed and appropriate place was found. World War I postponed the construction. After the war the main problem was financing. Due to the inflation of the Yugoslav krone, community could not finance the construction solely from the contribution of its members. In 1920, the fundraising started, and at that time the Jewish community of Vinkovci had about 200 members, of which 150 lived in Vinkovci and another 50 in the surrounding villages. In the mid-1922, thanks to the persistence and organizational capabilities of rabbi Mavro Frankfurter, the construction of the synagogue started. Jakob Schlesinger, a wealthy wholesaler and the owner of the steam mill in Vinkovci, gave the largest financial contribution to the construction. The Second Vinkovci Synagogue was built under the architect Frank Funtak in the Aleksandar street (today the Zvonimir street 18-20). The total cost of construction was 4,5 million krones. Funtak turned to classicism when choosing styles for the Vinkovci Synagogue. Although this style dominated, the building also had elements of the 19th-century synagogue architecture and of art deco. The synagogue dome was built in Mud√©jar style, while double windows and the trefoil upper row of windows were built in rundbogenstil. Vinkovci Synagogue had a longitudinal construction with a rectangular shape. Funtak took the dome style from the Vukovar Synagogue. In addition to the dome, a tripartite front was a traditional element of the synagogue architecture from the 20th century. The central part of the facade was slightly withdrawn in relation to the side. The sides of the synagogue were visually highlighted with an art deco set of gables above the cornice of the building. Vinkovci Synagogue was destroyed during World War II in 1941-42 by the regime of the Independent State of Croatia. Rabbi Mavro Frankfurter and president of the community Ignjat Lang were both killed in the Jasenovac concentration camp.(1992-06-21). Globus.

The goal of the project was to automate and streamline the USAF's logistics operations by, in part, consolidating and replacing over 200 separate legacy systems. The project was undertaken to develop a single integrated enterprise resource planning system built using commercial off-the-shelf software, aimed at tracking all of its physical assets and making efficiency savings. The purpose of the system was to enable the organisation to track all of its physical assets including airplanes, fuel, and even spare parts. The ECSS program was established through two main contracts. The first contract was with the database software company Oracle, to supply the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software. The second contract was with the Computer Science Corporation (CSC), to amalgamate the COTS software into the existing Air Force infrastructure. After spending $1.1 billion on its development, the USAF concluded in 2012 that the system, \\"has not yielded any significant military capability\\" and estimated that, \\"it would require an additional $1.1B for about a quarter of the original scope to continue and fielding would not be until 2020.\\" Based on that conclusion, the USAF canceled the program in November 2012.

History The Nagpur-Asansol main line of Bengal Nagpur Railway came up in 1891 and the cross-country Howrah-Nagpur-Mumbai line started functioning in 1900. After independence of India, this area saw a lot of activity. In the 1950s when Rourkela Steel Plant was being constructed, a marshalling yard was set up at Bondamunda to cater to the requirements of bulk transportation. New lines were added. A line was constructed to establish a direct link with Ranchi. Bondamunda was connected to Barsuan iron ore mines in 1960 and the line was extended to Kiriburu in 1964. The marshalling yard is the second largest in India. Bondamunda was electrified in 1961-62. http://elocos.railnet.gov.in/Holding/holding_01_19.pdf Loco Shed Two locomotive sheds, one for steam locomotives and the other for diesel locomotives, was set up at Bondamunda in the 1950s. The steam locomotive shed was closed in the late 1980s. An electric locomotive shed was started in 1983 for accommodating six WAM 4 locomotives. It increased to 50 within a short period. As of 2019, it accommodates 242 electric locomotives and is being expanded. A new electric locomotive shed is under construction having capacity of 200 WAG 9 locomotives. Bimlagarh-Talcher project The long line connecting Bimlagarh on the Bondamunda-Barsuan branch line and Talcher on the Sambalpur-Talcher-Barang branch line, was sanctioned in 2004-05 and construction is in progress.

A mercury relay (mercury displacement relay, mercury contactor) is a relay that uses mercury as the switching element. They are used as high- current switches or contactors, where contact erosion from constant cycling would be a problem for conventional relay contacts. Owing to environmental considerations about the toxicity of mercury, mercury relays are mostly obsolete though modern encapsulated units still have applications. They are generally being replaced by solid state relays.  Operation  Mercury relays consist of a vertical (usually glass) tube containing liquid mercury. They have isolated contacts at the bottom of the tube and partway up, usually in a side arm of the glass. The relay works by displacement. A pool of mercury fills the lower portion of the tube, but is insufficient to bridge the contacts. A magnetic slug of iron or steel is placed in the tube, where it sinks by gravity so as to displace the mercury. The displaced mercury rises in the tube, sufficiently to bridge the contacts and complete the circuit between them. Around the top part of the tube is placed the coil. When energised, this coil attracts the slug, lifting it upwards and out of the mercury pool. The mercury is no longer displaced, and thus flows downwards, away from the upper contact, and so the circuit opens. This allows for normally closed operation. Normally open mercury relay, with coil around bottom of tube For the more traditional normally open relay operation, the side contact is arranged somewhat higher up (or the volume of mercury is reduced) ,so that contact is not made when the iron slug is freely floating on the pool of mercury. The control coil is mounted below the rest level of the slug, and when energised draws down the slug deeper into the pool, thereby displacing additional mercury and thus raising the level to the previously uncovered side contact and closing the circuit. Vladimir Gurevich , Electric Relays: Principles and Applications CRC Press, 2005 Section 3.12 \\"Mercury displacement relays\\" The mercury relay thus allows for switching of higher currents with a small control current, for a large number of cycles. They are often installed into automatic controllers that required extended periods of unattended continuous switching operation. The mercury surface is self-restoring after an arc, and the contact resistance is low and stable. The glass tube of a mercury relay must be mounted near-vertically. The sensitivity of these relays can be altered by adjusting their angle relative to vertical. As sensitivity depends upon angle, they are unsuitable for use on mobile equipment or with conditions of high vibration.  Impulse relays  Mercury relays have also been produced as latching or impulse relays. The Lenning design uses a horizontal glass tube with two axially isolated pools of mercury. A conductive stirrup can bridge these to make the connection. The relay is controlled by the stirrup being rotated in and out of the pool along the horizontal axis of the tube. A weight on the stirrup's armature gives an over-centre action that provides the latching behaviour. A magnetic slug on the armature allows it to be rotated and controlled by an external electromagnet.  High-speed operation  Owing to the mass of mercury moved during switching, compared to that of the armature and spring leaves of a conventional relay, the mercury relay is not a high-speed device. Despite this, the mercury relay does have a very low contact bounce time, in the sub-millisecond range. For some applications, particularly inductive loads, this alone may be a reason for their use ‚Äì the timing of contact closure is not rapid, but the avoidance of bounce is valuable. For high-speed use, the mercury-wetted relay is used instead. This combines the speed of a low-mass relay, together with the fast wetting of mercury contacts. A relay, usually a reed relay, has its contacts coated with a small quantity of mercury. This gives the low bounce advantage of mercury, although the current capacity is still limited to broadly that of the original reed relay.

During this period, global average temperature was about higher and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were approximately 1000 parts per million (ppm), 2.5 times the current concentration in Earth's atmosphere. The abundance of atmospheric carbon dioxide had a very significant impact on global climate and Earth's natural systems as its concentration is considered one of the main factors in the development of a pronounced greenhouse Earth during the Cretaceous with a very low average global temperature gradient. As a consequence, high paleolatitudes in both hemispheres were much warmer than at present. This temperature gradient was partly responsible for the lack of continental ice sheets in polar regions. As a response to elevated global temperatures, the Earth's hydrologic cycle was significantly enhanced due to greater volume of moisture evaporation from the surface of the ocean. In turn, the absolute sea level during this time period stood at elevations much higher than the present level. Continental encroachment of seawater formed widespread shallow seas, including expanses of epeiric seas. An increase in surface area between shallow, warm epeiric seawater and the atmosphere permits higher evaporation rates and more precipitation at various latitudes, producing a more temperate global climate. A widespread temperate climate also had significant effects on high latitude ecosystems. Cretaceous polar forests During the Cretaceous, temperate forests thrived at polar latitudes, as there was a notable difference from current conditions at high latitudes during the Cretaceous polar seasons. The duration of summer sunlight and winter darkness lasted for approximately 5 months each. This variation in light is thought to have played a critical role in the composition and evolution of polar forests. Fossilized flora evidence suggests the presence of paleoforests up to latitudes of 85¬∞ in both Northern and Southern hemispheres. The dominant forms of vegetation at these high latitudes during the previous 100 million years were rapidly evolving and ultimately being replaced during a time known as the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution. During the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution, conifers, cycads and ferns were selectively replaced by angiosperms and gymnosperms, becoming the main species dominating the high paleolatitudes. In this Cretaceous greenhouse world, Arctic conifer forests were considered predominantly deciduous, while those that grew on Antarctica contained a significantly greater proportion of evergreens. A 2019 study revealed that the first angiosperm blooms made it to Australia 126 million years ago, which also revised the date of southern Australia's polar vertebrates to 126-110 million years ago. Forest diversification In the early Cretaceous, approximately 130 million years ago, there was a major diversification of angiosperms that set in motion a large evolutionary change in high paleolatitude forest composition. The diversification of angiosperms is in close connection with pollen and nectar collecting insects. It is thought that the diversification of these insects would have a substantial impact on the rate of angiosperm speciation. Whatever the mechanism for the diversification, the early Cretaceous angiosperm \\"takeover\\" denotes an important transition of the ecosystem. By the end of the Cretaceous, the composition of polar forest regions had diversified by approximately 50-80%. This transition from conifers, cycads and ferns to predominantly angiosperms reflects an interesting evolutionary adaptation to the regional polar climate and quite possibly numerous other factors like sea-floor spreading rates, eustatic sea level and high global temperatures. Ecological productivity Poleward displacement of the temperate zone during the Cretaceous significantly elevated terrestrial forest primary productivity. At high to mid paleolatitudes, forest productivity was estimated to be twice as much relative to lower paleolatitudes. Terrestrial productivity in the high paleolatitudes is strongly linked to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Results from the experiments on deciduous and evergreen tree growth under various carbon dioxide concentrations show differing impacts. There are four main factors that contribute to net forest productivity: carbon dioxide concentration, root respiration rates, temperature and photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide alone tends to decrease leaf and root respiration by lowering the light compensation point of photosynthesis, allowing for a net positive gain in carbon intake during the course of a day. The reduction of root respiration tends to initiate root growth and ultimately results in an improvement in nutrient and water uptake efficiency. When photosynthesis is added to the effects of carbon dioxide, depending on regional temperature, forest productivity is drastically increased. The combination of all four physiological factors results in a significant net increase in forest productivity. According to experimental results, tree species with long lived evergreen foliage tend to benefit the greatest in a carbon dioxide rich environment because of their longer growing season and adaptations like canopy development that allow them to thrive in the temperate polar paleolatitudes of the Cretaceous. Fossilized forest The composition and structure of high latitude Cretaceous forests was composed primarily of deciduous conifers, ferns, angiosperms and gymnosperms. The most abundant and globally widespread plant taxa were the araucarioid and podocarpoid conifers, extending approximately 80¬∞ into both hemispheres and composing more than 90% of the canopy generating evergreen vegetation. Other types of conifers, although abundant in occurrence, were restricted to mid and low latitudes in both hemispheres, confined mainly by regional climates. As global climate evolved, the rise of angiosperms began to put pressure on conifers at higher latitudes by growing taller and ultimately winning the battle for sunlight. The rapid evolution of diverse angiosperm species 25 million years later eventually became the dominant tree type by the mid-Cretaceous. By the Late Cretaceous, a temperate climate in both the Northern and Southern hemisphere was ideal for the rapid diversification and distribution of various angiosperms and to a lesser extent, conifers. Studies on the mid-Cretaceous paleorecord conclude that forest compositions in Northern hemisphere high paleolatitudes were mainly populated by mixed evergreen and deciduous tree types. In contrast, the Southern hemisphere was composed primarily of evergreens. Paleoclimate proxies A paleoclimate indicator, also known as a paleoclimate proxy, can reveal important information about what global climate may have been like in the past. Paleoclimate studies on tree growth rings, deep sea cores, ice cores and paleosols are just a few of the many common proxies used to evaluate the major forcings on paleoclimates. Paleothermometry One of the most important and valuable tools for paleothermometry reconstruction is the analysis of isotope-ratio mass spectrometry data on stable isotopes like those of hydrogen and oxygen. Studies on marine (planktonic/benthic) foraminifera and bulk carbonate isotope ratios during the mid-Cretaceous suggest a continual warming period from ~100 Ma to 66 Ma. During this period, the southern high latitudes were as cool as and as warm as . Paleotemperatures of Cretaceous northern high latitudes were deduced from oxygen isotope analysis of well-preserved brachiopod and molluscan shells. Results from studies show temperature fluctuations that correspond to seasonal variation ranging from . Dendrochronology on Cretaceous wood Fossilized tree growth rings Growth ring measurements during the Cretaceous can also provide details of what the climate might have been like in various geographic locations on Earth. Pattern analysis of tree rings or growth rings from Cretaceous fossil woods are mainly used to make inferences into paleoclimate and forest productivity. One very useful scientific method used for tree growth ring dating is dendrochronology. However, most of the studies conducted on fossilized wood rely on the idea that processes related to tree growth rates that operated in the past are identical to the processes that operate in the present, uniformitarianism. On this basis, forest productivity can be inferred from the analysis of growth rings in Cretaceous trees. Analysis of forest productivity from the Cretaceous shows that annual tree growth rates at low paleolatitudes were significantly elevated relative to the present. In the polar paleolatitudes, growth rate analysis also indicates elevated productivity, but even more significantly improved relative to today. Dendrochronology of fossilized wood growth rings from high paleolatitudes suggests the presence of greenhouse-like climatic conditions on a global scale during this time period.Beerling et al., 1999 References Further reading  Category:Cretaceous life Category:History of climate variability and change Category:Geological history of Earth ","title":"Polar forests of the Cretaceous"},{"id":"37882017","text":"Johannes Marcellus Maria \\"Han\\" Polman (born 16 January 1963) is a Dutch politician of the Democrats 66 (D66) party.

In December 2011, Wright signed to rapper Hopsin's independent record label, Funk Volume. After signing, he released his debut studio album SmokeOut Conversations in April 2012. He followed that with The First Agreement in December of that year, and then a mixtape The Golden Age in August 2013. Following touring with Hopsin in early 2014, Dizzy Wright released State of Mind, an EP that would peak at number 54 on the Billboard 200. On May 22, 2015, he released his second studio album The Growing Process which peaked at number 47 on the Billboard 200. Early life Wright looked up to Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, of which his uncles Layzie Bone and Flesh-N-Bone are members. At the age of four he moved with his mom and siblings to Las Vegas, Nevada. He began rapping at just 8 years old with the group DaFuture which included his brother and a very close friend. His mother wrote his raps at the time and was a concert promoter so he was exposed to the music industry early even doing youth reporting at major awards shows like the BET Awards and interviewing Tyrese, St. Lunatics and Boyz II Men. He credits this for being the reason he wants to stay away from major record labels and stick to independent labels. In seventh grade Wright lived in a homeless shelter with his family for five months. Throughout the rest of high school he lived in Georgia and California before moving back to Las Vegas when he was in twelfth grade. In 2010, Wright took part in and won the Sheikh Music Rip the Mic competition, which impressed record label Funk Volume. In 2010, he also appeared on 106 & Park Wild Out Wednesday, as Dizzy D Flashy. Musical career 2010‚Äì2012: Signing to Funk Volume and Smokeout Conversations In 2011, Dizzy Wright released his mixtape, titled Soul Searchin' Next Level, which would be a final release under Bluestar Records. In 2012, Wright signed to rapper Hopsin's independent record label Funk Volume. Wright's debut studio album, Smokeout Conversations, was released on April 20, 2012, in honor of the annual marijuana type-of \\"holiday\\" under Funk Volume. The album included the single \\"Can't Trust Em\\", and peaked at number 42 on the US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums and number eight on the US Heatseekers Albums charts. Months later, Wright released a reloaded version of a mixtape, titled Free SmokeOut Conversations, which has been downloaded over 170,000 times. This mixtape features guest appearances from a fellow rapper and his label-mate Hopsin, and SwizZz. It also contains his single \\"Independent Living\\". Not withstanding the original plan to release the mixtape prior to the album, but then instead Dizzy released the album. The album's success allowed him to perform on a national 30-day headlining tour following its release. He capped off the year performing on the Funk Volume Tour 2012 with Hopsin, SwizZz and Jarren Benton. On December 3, 2012, Dizzy released his debut extended play, titled The First Agreement.

The colony lasted four years during the Revolution, and eight months during the War of 1812. At the end of each war the British ceded the land back to the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Paris and the Treaty of Ghent, respectively.  American Revolution  Francis McLean Plaque, St. Paul's Church (Halifax), Nova Scotia Fort George (Castine, Maine) - British fort built to protect New Ireland In 1779 the British adopted a strategy to capture parts of Maine, especially around Penobscot Bay, and transform it into a new colony to be called \\"New Ireland\\".

Bellot (1732‚Äì1810). It was intended to be a permanent colony for Loyalists and a base for military action during the war.Robert W. Sloan, \\"New Ireland: Men in Pursuit of a Forlorn Hope, 1779-1784,\\" Maine Historical Society Quarterly, 1979, Vol. 19 Issue 2, pp 73-90 On 30 May 1779, eight British ships of war left from Halifax with 640 troops.Yankee Colonies across America: Cities upon the Hills By Chaim M. Rosenberg, p. 7 Under the command of General Francis McLean, the ships entered Castine's harbor, landed troops, and captured the village. They began erecting Fort George on one of the highest points of the peninsula. Alarmed by this incursion, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts sent the Penobscot Expedition led by Massachusetts general Solomon Lovell and Continental Navy captain Dudley Saltonstall (seconded by Gen. Peleg Wadsworth. Col. Paul Revere was given charge of the ordnance). The military expedition consisted of a fleet of 19 warships and 25 support ships, carrying 344 guns in total. Although badly outnumbered, McLean and his British forces (the 74th Regiment and the 82nd Regiment) withstood the 21-day siege and the Americans were routed by the arrival of British reinforcements under the command of Collier. The Patriots, having been blocked from escaping by sea by the Royal Navy, burned their ships near present-day Bangor and walked home.Woodard, Colin. The Lobster Coast . New York. Viking/Penguin, , 2004, pp. 139-140 New England was unable to dislodge the British despite a reorganized defense and the imposition of martial law in parts of Maine. Some of the most easterly towns declared themselves neutral and remained uninvolved in the war.James S. Leamon, \\"The Search for Security: Maine after Penobscot,\\" Maine Historical Society Quarterly, 1982, Vol. 21 Issue 3, pp 119-153 The battle was one of the greatest British victories of the war. The failed Penobscot Expedition, which cost the revolutionaries eight million dollars and 43 ships, proved to be the greatest American naval defeat until Pearl Harbor in 1941. The British 74th Regiment held Majabagaduce until the end of the war. The British established a fort, under the command of Campbell, protecting about 30 houses occupied by Loyalists attracted to the area. The fort housed captured American privateers and received trade from Halifax and New York. The guide who led the loyalists to the fort was discovered, tried by a court-martial under Major Burton, condemned and executed under the direction of Major General James Wadsworth. A party of 25 Loyalists subsequently went to Wadsworth's quarters and took him prisoner. He eventually escaped on 15 June 1781.p. 613p. 184 New Ireland was ceded to the Americans as part of the Paris peace settlement. Saltonstall and Revere were later court-martialed, charged with cowardice and insubordination; the boards found Saltonsall guilty, but acquitted Revere. At the end of the Revolutionary War, many American Loyalists in the area migrated eastward to the Canadian Maritimes, some towing their houses behind their boats. Subsequently known as United Empire Loyalists, they crossed the newly established international boundary line of the St. Croix River and established St. Andrews, one of the oldest towns in New Brunswick. In addition, many soldiers of the 74th chose to be disbanded in St. Andrews (last muster May 24, 1784), and took up land grants there along with the Loyalists, rather than return to Britain. After the peace was signed in 1783, the New Ireland proposal was abandoned. In 1784 the decision was made to split New Brunswick off from Nova Scotia and made it into the desired Loyalist colony. It was planned to be named \\"New Ireland\\", but these plans fell through and it was instead named New Brunswick.Ann Gorman Condon, The Envy of the American States: The Loyalist Dream for New Brunswick (1984) The Treaty of Paris that ended the war was ambiguous in defining the boundary between Maine and the neighbouring British provinces of New Brunswick (Sunbury County, Nova Scotia) and Quebec. The New Ireland colony and the Penobscot expedition was fictionalised in the 2010 novel The Fort by British author Bernard Cornwell.  War of 1812  Lt Gov of Nova Scotia John Coape Sherbrooke conquered Maine and re-established New Ireland During the War of 1812, from his base in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in August and September 1814, Lt Governor of Nova Scotia John Coape Sherbrooke sent a naval force and 500 British troops under the command of Vice Admiral Colpoys to conquer Maine and re-establish the colony of New Ireland. In 26 days, they succeeded in taking possession of Hampden, Bangor, and Machias, destroying or capturing 17 American ships. They won the Battle of Hampden and occupied the village of Castine for the rest of the war, rebuilding Fort George, occupying a former American fort, and building three new forts there. Like the Revolutionary War, the goal was to incorporate Maine into Canada; George F.W. Young, a retired Saint Mary‚Äôs University history professor, said that the British ‚Äúwanted to extend the border back down to what they thought was the historic frontier.‚Äù The Treaty of Ghent returned this territory to the United States. The British left in April 1815, at which time they collected ¬£10,750 obtained from tariff duties at Castine. The brief life of the colony yielded customs revenues, called the \\"Castine Fund\\", which were subsequently used to finance a military library in Halifax and found Dalhousie College. Dalhousie University has a street named \\"Castine Way\\".D.C. Harvey, \\"The Halifax‚ÄìCastine expedition,\\" Dalhousie Review, 18 (1938‚Äì39): 207‚Äì13. Interestingly, the British army captured Belfast, Maine in 1779 and then held it again for five days in September 1814 during the War of 1812.

The Lollards were a fourteenth and fifteenth century group of people who followed the teachings of John Wycliffe, an English scholar and theologian who saw corruption in the all-powerful Catholic Church organization and sought after reform. Lollards' works A few of Wycliffe and his followers' main points of interest were translating the Bible into English for the common man to read, cleansing religion of corruption and excessive wealth, and bringing all Christians in to more direct contact with the God. Ultimately, the Lollards laid the groundwork for the future of Protestantism in England which would flourish in the following centuries. But at the time, all of these ideas were extremely controversial and politically dangerous moves to make as the English monarchy and powerful Catholic church were closely knit together. Teachings Influenced by the revolutionary work of John Wycliffe and by her own personal radical thoughts, Baxter taught a variety of even more controversial Lollard doctrines. She was very critical of regimented church life and spoke out against multiple church practices from Sunday worship traditions to infant baptism to the image of the crucifix. As were many Lollards, Baxter was tried for heresy in 1429 as part of the Norwich Heresy Trials (1428-1431). Accusations and Trial Johanna Clifland testified against her, claiming that Baxter had expressed a variety of unorthodox sentiments, speaking out against the traditions of sanctioned marriage, fasting for religious days, and the swearing of religious oaths. Echoing foundational Lollard beliefs, Baxter also opposed the wealth of Catholic clergymen and the practice of confession to church officials. Six months after Johanna Clifland made her accusations, Margery Baxter confessed in October, 1429, and was sentenced to four Sunday floggings as she walked barefoot around her parish church.

For much of his career he was a professor of social and political theory at the University of Buckingham. Career Barry taught for a year at Queen's University Belfast in Northern Ireland, which he later described as \\"about the worst place in the world outside sub-Saharan Africa\\". He then returned to England to work at Birmingham Polytechnic, where he began to study the ideas of classical liberalism and libertarianism, including works by Friedrich Hayek and John Jewkes. He subsequently studied the ideas of the Austrian School of economics, including authors such as Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard, and the writings of Ayn Rand, although he disliked the latter. His first book, published in 1979, addressed Hayek's philosophy. His second book, in 1981, was a textbook on political theory with a \\"definite libertarian stance\\". In 1982, he became a Reader in Politics at the University of Buckingham, which was at that time the only private university in Britain. In 1984, he was promoted to the position of Chair in Social and Political Theory. His work took increasingly explicit libertarian positions, defending free-market business activity and criticizing welfare programs. Barry was an expert on the United States Constitution, and worked with several US-based organizations, including the Center for Social Philosophy and Policy at Bowling Green State University, the Liberty Fund, and the Ludwig von Mises Institute. He visited the country so frequently that at one point he was barred from entry due to overuse of his visa. He served on the advisory council of the Institute of Economic Affairs. He also worked with the Institute for the Study of Civil Society and the David Hume Institute. Personal life Barry was born in Northampton to Doreen and Tim Barry. His mother died when he was nine, after which he was raised by his father and an aunt. He attended the Northampton Grammar School, and then the University of Exeter. Barry was married, but divorced in 1985. In the 1990s, multiple sclerosis began to interfere with his activities, but he continued to work. He died of complications from the disease on 21 October 2008. Awards and honours In 2005, he received the 'Liberty in Theory' Lifetime Award from the Libertarian Alliance.

Plot After Elena and Damon wake up and continue where they left off the night before, Stefan arrives to the Salvatore house and approaches Damon with the suspicion that Elena is sired to him. Stefan tells Damon to ask Elena to try to drink from a blood bag again and see if she can keep it down, since he believes the only reason she can only drink straight from the vein is because Damon told her to. Damon then asks Elena and sees that she can now keep the blood down. Damon decides to help Stefan investigate the sire bond in New Orleans, hoping to find a former flame of Damon's who was also sired to him. Damon and Stefan visit a witch who refuses to tell them anything and claims she is not a practitioner. While the Salvatore brothers are out of town, Elena, Caroline and Bonnie share a girls‚Äô night, but an argument quickly ensues when Caroline starts criticizing Damon. When Caroline gets angry at Elena's stubbornness and how she is so smitten with Damon, Elena reveals that she and Damon slept together, which leads to Caroline telling Elena that she is sired to Damon. Meanwhile, at Hayley‚Äôs urging, Tyler confronts one of Klaus‚Äô hybrids, Kimberly, and the situation quickly escalates into violence when the hybrids start fighting over who takes the pack-leader role. Kimberly then captures Caroline to try to show Tyler that she is the leader, but Tyler and Elena end up saving Caroline, and the other hybrids (including Kimberly) accept Tyler as their leader. While in New Orleans, Damon recalls some information from the past which figured out the witch was lying to them and went back for a second visit. The witch tells Damon that the only way to try and break a sire bond is by telling the sired vampire to forget he about him/her and move on with his/her life. She also tells them that there is no way to officially break the sire bond. The witch also reveals that a sire bond only happens when the vampire who is sired has feelings for their maker before they turn into a vampire. Damon realizes he has to do the right thing with Elena and decides to tell her to move on. When he goes to talk to her, Elena realizes that he wants to break things off and tries to convince him that her feelings are real, as she believes they are, and that the sire bond only affects the way she acts. Also in the episode, we find out that Professor Shane is teaching Bonnie a type of magic called \\"expression,\\" which the witch in New Orleans called a thing that is even more evil than dark magic, and other witches don't even call it magic at all. Reception  Ratings  When the episode aired on December 6, 2012, the episode was viewed by 2.42 million American viewers.

The park contains 354 acres of southern California wildlife, including costal sage shrub, riparian, freshwater marsh, and grasslands, and is located within the boundaries of both Orange, California and Tustin, California. Peters Canyon was given to this city in 1992 by the Irvine Company who had used it previously for cattle grazing. The canyon is lined with a residential area on one side and open hills on the other. This canyon is commonly used by hikers, mountain bikers, and equestrians because of the trails that circumvent the 50 acre man-made lake, which was constructed by the Irvine Company in 1931, on the interior of the plot. The regional park is open from 7:00 AM to sunset every day of the week, save for the chance of rain or hazardous conditions, in which case the park will be closed for three days following the particular occurrence. The park has garnered local popularity in part for its convenient location (the canyon is in the middle of a suburban neighborhood), as well as its cleanliness and varied trail options. The management asks that visitors see protecting the park's wildlife, as well as any construction or park improvement efforts, as a shared responsibility. History Upper Peters Canyon Reservoir at the headwaters of Peters Canyon Wash in 1966. Little Peters Canyon Lake, photo taken in March 1966. This reservoir is currently dry. Peters Canyon Regional Park was originally part of the Spanish Land Grant known as \\"Rancho Lomas de Santiago\\" which was a 47,000-acre piece of land given by governor Pico Pico to Teodosio Yorba in 1846. The section that was to become Peter's Canyon was known as \\"Canon de Las Ranas\\" which translates to \\"Canyon of the Frogs\\". The name came from the fact that it drained into the \\"Cienega de Las Ranas\\", which is Spanish for \\"Marsh of the Frogs\\" which is now known as Upper Newport Bay. In 1897 James Irvine purchased the land from Yorba and leased the land to several farmers one of which was James Peters. Peters built a ranch house and planted a eucalyptus grove near Little Peter Lake which was located in the lower part of the Canyon of the Frogs. In 1899 golf was introduced by some sportsmen from Orange and Santa Ana. The Santiago Golf Club was built in Peters Canyon on land leased from the Irvine Company. The greens were made from oil soaked sand and the fairways consisted of native soil. A red club house was built on the ridge that now extends into Upper Peters Canyon reservoir. The Upper Peters Canyon reservoir was built in 1931, and the lower reservoir (Little Peters Canyon Lake, which is now a flood control basin) in 1940 to conserve water. With this availability of water, agriculture which included orange groves thrived in the canyon. The reservoirs nowadays are known as Peters Canyon Wash. The wash is part of the San Diego Creek which is a 26-mile waterway that flows into Upper Newport Bay. Camp Myford, Tustin, 1952 During World War II the U.S. Army established a training area called Camp Commander in the eucalyptus grove near Little Peters Lake. The men that were stationed here would fight mock battles against soldiers from Camp Rathke, and Army Post, about two miles away in Irvine Region park. From 1952 to 1988 the Boy Scouts took care of Camp Myford for all sorts of weekend scouting events. Today a gated community called Tustin Ranch Estates occupies the site. The Irvine Co. dedicated 354 acres of Peters Canyon to the County of Orange on March 3, 1992. This is now preserved as an open space for the public. Recreation Peters Canyon is commonly used by hikers, mountain bikers, and equestrians because of its lengthy trails, which include Newport Boulevard Trail, Meadowlark Trail, Skypark Trail, Lake View Loop Trail, Lower Peters Canyon Trail, Peters Canyon Creek Trail, Gnatcatcher Trail, Sage Trail, Opossum Trail, and East View Ridge Trail. The longest trail is approximately 5.5 miles long, roundtrip. The Mountains to Sea Trail, a 22-mile-long trail that stretches from Weir Canyon to Upper Newport Bay, passes through Peters Canyon as well, connecting it to other wild parks in the local area. The trails are well maintained by rangers and local citizens who volunteer their time to the park. Another common activity to take part in when tourists visit the canyon is birdwatching, as there are more than one hundred different bird species, including various waterfowl and riparian species. The park is open to equestrians and is also dog friendly. Wildlife The canyon is home to varied wildlife, including, but not limited to, mule deer, raccoons, opossums, bobcats, coyotes, and rattlesnakes. Numerous mountain lion sightings have been reported, though attacks are rare. In addition to larger animals, the canyon is home to many smaller amphibians, reptiles and insects, some of them poisonous. Over 100 species of various migratory waterfowl and wading birds are drawn to the canyon's reservoir throughout the year. Cactus wrens, gnatcatchers, tri-colored blackbirds and rufous-crowned sparrows are some of the species that can be seen amongst the varying habitats contained in the park year-round. A variety of trees and plants can be found in the canyon, both indigenous and non-native. Rare black cottonwood trees, willows and oaks, sycamore, and varying cacti, brush and grasses can be seen from the trails. Additionally, a small eucalyptus forest (originally planted by farmer James Peters) can be found in the southern region of the canyon. Habitats found in the canyon include freshwater marsh, coastal sage, scrub, grasslands, and the riparian sections connecting them. A small creek runs through the canyon seasonally. The park maintains the idea that its visitors share the duty of protecting its wildlife. Therefore, any fires, or swimming in the creeks or reservoir is prohibited, as is fishing in the reservoir. The park also asks that minors stay under adult supervision and dogs stay on leashes. In recent news In January 2012, a 52-year-old bicyclist named Reynaldo Canlas fell while riding one of the trails in Peters Canyon. Canlas had suffered a heart attack and was airlifted to Western Medical Center in nearby Santa Ana. However, shortly after arriving at the hospital, Canlas died. The Orange County Police Department decided not to investigate his death further.

Both the source and method of obtaining the organ to transplant are major ethical issues to consider, as well as the notion of distributive justice.  Sources  Organ harvesting from live people is one of the most frequently discussed debate topic in organ transplantation. The World Health Organization argues that transplantation promote health, but the notion of ‚Äútransplantation tourism‚Äù has the potential to violate human rights or exploit the poor, to have unintended health consequences, and to provide unequal access to services, all of which ultimately may cause harm. Thus WHO called to ban compensated organ transplanting and asked member states to protect the most vulnerable from transplant tourism and organ trade.Bulletin of the World Health Organization, World Health Organization, Volume 85, Number 1, January 2007, 1-84 However, as disincentives becomes a must, adding incentives back, such as improving life condition for organ donors after donation, becomes difficult.Organ trafficking and transplantation pose new challenges, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, Volume 82, Number 9, September 2004, 639-718 Regardless of the ‚Äúgift of life‚Äù, in the context of developing countries, this might be coercive. The practice of coercion could be considered exploitative of the poor population, violating basic human rights according to Articles 3 and 4 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For example, in the history of major transplant countries, organs from executed prisoners are used to develop their techniques. This practice was condemned by bioethicists Hillman H. Harvesting organs from recently executed prisoners: Practice must be stopped. British Medical Journal, 2001; 323(7323):1254. and was gradually abandoned and replaced by donation systemsNew era for organ donation and transplant in China, by World Health Organization, Volume 90, Number 11, November 2012, 793-868 A powerfully-argued opposing view, that properly and effectively regulated trade (markets) in organs could ensure that the seller is fully informed of all the consequences of donation, is a mutually beneficial transaction between two consenting adults, and that prohibiting it could itself be interpreted as violating Articles 3 and 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Even within developed countries there is concern that enthusiasm for increasing the supply of organs may trample on respect for the right to life. The question is made even more complicated by the fact that the \\"irreversibly\\" criterion for legal death cannot be adequately defined and can easily change with changing technology. As controversies on the boundary of life and death grow, the debate on when to terminate end-of-life care and start organ harvesting ensues. Controversies also raise on how to assume consent of organ donation for dead people. In practice most countries, have legislation allowing for implied consent, asking people to opt out of organ donation instead of opt in, but allow family refusals.Keeping kidneys, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, Volume 90, Number 10, October 2012, 713-792 There are fewer debates on animal sources, as historically laboratory animals have been used to develop organ transplantation technologies for prolonging human life, such as using animal organs in xenotransplantation on human. Nevertheless, animal rights activists have objections on what they see as trading off the rights of animals to live their own lives (deontology) for rationalized ends of replacing an organ or a dialysis machine in a sufferer, where many organ donations fail. Further, organ harvesting in bear farms abuses animals. Religious groups and ethical vegetarians may object on purity grounds to transplantation as violating natural boundaries found in nature. Researchers currently explore prospects of using 3D printing or stem cells to produce organs, but some such research projects have been crictised for their use of human embryos taken through abortions, as in controversies about Planned Parenthood's selling of fetal organs and tissues for research.  Distribution  Scarcity of replacement organs, currently only from living or dead organ donors rather than factories, and insufficient for demand, results in a growing waiting list of patients and ethical issues in allocation.

Kluge objects to the equal access principle based on his argument that people whose need are uncontrollable should be preferred over people who choose a poor lifestyle.Drawing the ethical line between organ transplantation and lifestyle abuse.

The work discusses his views on the concept of free will as it pertains the Catholic Church's opinion on predestination at the time. The concept of predestination, in the opinion of the Catholic Church, deals with the fact that God has predetermined our lives, and that he knows how we will act. Many philosophers of the time argued that if humans' lives are in fact predetermined by God, than in reality the concept of free will is simply an illusion. Essentially the argument is that if God has created us already knowing the decisions we will make, than those decisions are not actually ours. Valla, through a fictional dialogue amongst the work's characters, defends the idea that the concepts of predetermination and free will can coexist. In the work, Valla states that he is attempting to directly refute the works of the 6th century philosopher Boethius. Background Lorenzo Valla was an Italian humanist who lived during the 15th century. Valla was born in Rome in 1406. Valla's family had close ties to the papal curia, putting him in close contact with many established Church figures at an early age. Many of these figures were also thinkers who abided by humanist ideologies. One such humanist was Melchior Scrivani, who served as a papal secretary. Scrivani was also Valla's uncle. Lorenzo Valla hoped to one day succeed his uncle, and from early on in his career, he had a desire to leave his impact on the papacy and the Catholic Church. Valla faced criticisms from his peers within Rome which eventually forced him to leave for Pavia in 1431. Valla taught for three years in Pavia, eventually leaving to serves as a member of Alfonso of Aragon's court. Disputes between the Aragones and the papacy, in which Valla played a central role, left Valla with a renewed desire to leave his mark in Rome, even after the Aragonese settled their differences with the papacy.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/622198/Lorenzo-Valla Valla as a humanist As a humanist, Valla spent much of his early career writing on the importance of the Latin language to scholarly society. Renaissance humanism concentrates itself around the importance of Latin as the international language of scholars. Most Renaissance humanists, and Valla in particular, recognized and stressed the importance of rhetoric and language. Valla was known for his critiques of classical scholastic thought, and his ideas on the reformation of Aristotelian logic. Valla's dialogue on free will As mentioned, Valla wrote his dialogue on free will (de libero arbitrio) with the intent of proving that the ideas of predetermination and free will could co-exist within the Catholic Church. Lorenzo Valla argued, not only in his dialogue on free will, that free will was essential to the make up of human morality. This is belief is central to his theologies, and is one of the main reasons for his strong attempts to defend the concept. Valla chronicles a fictional dialogue between two protagonists and through their conversation, expresses his own ideas on the issue. The first of the two main characters is Antonio Glarea, an educated man who Valla identifies as being from San Lorenzo. The second is a man named Lorenzo, and it is safe to assume that Lorenzo's comments throughout the dialogue are meant to represent those of Lorenzo Valla. The two engage in an intensely theoretical debate. Eventually, Valla's conclusions become evident to the reader. Many critics argue that although Valla argues his points passionately, many of his conclusions are inconclusive. After a brief introduction by Valla, in which he outlines his reasons for writing the piece, he begins the dialogue with a statement by Antonio. The general point of Antonio's first statement is to express his utter confusion in regards to grasping the concept of free will. Antonio's initial comments are not as forceful as they become later in the dialogue. At this point in the work Antonio is simply expressing his frustrations with his inability to understand free will as the Church defines it. Valla's character Lorenzo addresses Antonio's questions about free will by explaining that the free will of humans' lies in their decision to live good or bad lives morally. He argues that God has given each person certain characteristics, and that we are free to decide how we use those attributes. Lorenzo speaks about how the differences amongst our characteristics are things that God knows, and that we can not know about all of the things we don't have, and that we are best to just do all that we can to make the best of what we know we do have. The heart of Lorenzo's initial argument is that although God does know who we are and what we are going to do, we still have the ability to decide to live within God's grace and make the most of what we have.http://www.sophia.org/lorenzo-valla-an-interpretation-of-the-dialogue-on- tutorial Antonio and Lorenzo go on to agree on the terms of the concepts of free will and predestination. It is important to note that both Antonio and Lorenzo consider themselves to be devout Roman Catholics. The two agree that in terms of the Catholic Church's view of predestination, that God does indeed know how we will act. The two also agree that the term free will can be defined as the ability for humans to make decisions about their actions. Antonio's main argument is that if God knows what we are going to do and he has created us, that God can not hold us accountable for our sins. Valla attempts to counter Antonio through numerous historical examples where he argues that God's foreknowledge of our action does not affect the morality of the decision at hand. He uses the example of the betrayal of Jesus by Judas. Initially Antonio claims that Lorenzo is simply bringing him back to his initial confusion on the issue of free will. After further discussion however Antonio admits that Lorenzo's arguments have persuaded him to recognize the compatibility of predestination and free will. Criticisms Many critics of Valla argue that although he makes strong arguments, he bases many of them on the inability of humans to grasp God's ability to know everything. Many of Valla's arguments demand the human concession that many aspects of God and faith are never going to be able to be understood. Oftentimes Valla resorts to making that claim that many of the counter arguments he is presented with are in fact heretical.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lorenzo-valla/ References Category:Free will Category:Christian philosophy Category:Dialogues Category:Medieval philosophical literature ","title":"Lorenzo Valla's Dialogue on Free Will"},{"id":"37883511","text":"Madala Ooru or Madala Village is a small village in Dudda hobli, Mandya District, in Karnataka state in India.

Its name has led to a folk etymology that its consumption caused hair loss. Distribution This sea hare occurs in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. It can be found mostly in shallow water of about 1.5 to 10 m. It avoids the intertidal zone because the animals cannot absorb atmospheric oxygen and so die after stranding relatively quickly. Occasionally some are trapped in tide pools at low tide. The adults feed primarily on algae of the genus Ulva, especially sea lettuce Ulva lactuca. During the planktonic phase of life they eat single-celled phytoplankton. Description Individuals can grow up to 40 cm long and weighs up to 380 g. Their skin is dark brown to reddish brown, with white to light brown blotches. It has a yellow inner shell that is thinner, flatter and more poorly calcified than other sea hares and measures about 1.5 cm long. Behavior When threatened they emit a white or purple ink. Aplysia depilans are one of the seven species of the genus which are known to swim occasionally rather than crawl. Although hermaphrodites, they cannot self-fertilize and require a partner. Classical reference The Greek Sophist Philostratus writes that the Roman Emperor Titus (died 81 AD) was poisoned by his brother Domitian with a sea hare and that his death had been foretold to him by Apollonius of Tyana. However, other classical sources such as Suetonius and Cassius Dio maintain he died of natural causes.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on December 9, 2012, and is written by Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and directed by Jerry Langford. In the episode, Meg is saddened when she learns a boy she has a crush on is gay. Plot While at the cafeteria with her friends Patty, Esther, and Ruth, at school, Meg confides her infatuation with a popular boy at school, Kent Lastname (Chris Cox). Esther suggests that she ask Kent out, yet Meg admits that she fears certain rejection. Meanwhile, the next morning, Brian and Stewie read Meg's diary, which confirms her long-term obsession with the boy. As Meg walks down the street, daydreaming about Kent, she causes Mayor Adam West to drive into a tree. Mayor Adam West is alright as he had arrived at a nest when he traded jobs with a bird. She realizes that she can't go on without Kent, and successfully asks him out. When he turns up at the Griffins' house, Kent shows himself to be particularly friendly to Chris. After the date, Meg tries to kiss him. Kent however had no idea that Meg thought they were on a date and then reveals to Meg that he is gay. To add insult to injury, he admits that he has feelings for her brother, Chris. In a small side plot, Stewie mishears Kent mentioning Meg's \\"brother\\" and believes Kent is interested in himself rather than Chris. The next day, Meg is in tears, and Brian is not able to avoid her by keeping silent as Peter and Lois are, so he reluctantly listens to her story about Kent. Questioning him further, she admits to Brian that Kent has feelings for Chris. Brian suggests Kent may be confused about his sexuality. However, at school the next day, Kent confirms that he's not confused and knows that he is gay. Meg later tries to make herself Kent's beard, but he refuses and states that if she's going to be like this then they can't be friends. As Kent pursues an oblivious Chris, Meg decides that if she can't have Kent, then Chris being with him is the next best thing. She asks Chris to sleep with Kent and naturally he refuses the request. Refusing to take \\"no\\" for an answer, Meg attempts to drug Chris into having sex with Kent. She tells Kent that Chris is gay and to come to Chris' room, with Chris \\"pretending\\" to be asleep, as he isn't \\"open about his sexuality\\". After Chris shows Meg a photo he has been keeping of the two of them for years, she decides not to drug Chris and instead pours the drug into a plant which falls over and is subsequently raped by another plant. However, she forgets to tell Kent and later that night, Kent shows up at Chris' room expecting a submissive Chris, but instead discovers Chris is straight. Chris confronts Meg, now forced to reveal her plan. Both boys are outraged and Kent, deeming Meg a complete psycho, angrily leaves and a seductive Stewie is left very mad, however he accidentally eats the drug after he mistakes it for candy and is raped by the plant as a result. Meg is unhappy as Kent hates her now and Brian talks to her about it, reassuring her that all it will take is one drunk man getting her pregnant and her refusing to have an abortion, and she'll have trapped her mate for life. Stewie comes in stating that his bottom was affected by poison ivy not knowing he was raped. Reception The episode received a 2.9 rating and was watched by a total of 5.64 million people, this made it the second most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating The Cleveland Show and Bob's Burgers but losing to The Simpsons with 7.44 million. The episode was met with mixed reviews from critics. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, saying \\"Maybe it‚Äôs the high from 'The Simpsons' referencing this little web site tonight, or maybe it‚Äôs how great that episode of 'Bob‚Äôs Burgers' was‚Äîbut the phrase of the night for the Fox animated lineup is 'a rising tide raises all ships.' Meg-centric episodes have been reliably disastrous in the post-revival seasons of 'Family Guy', and of last season‚Äôs crop, only 'Leggo My Meg-O' worked for me, and mostly because it devoted much of the time to Brian and Stewie. (The other two, 'Seahorse Seashell Party' and 'Quagmire and Meg' were complete misses.) But 'Friends Without Benefits' is the funniest Meg-centric episode in years, surrounding a typically cruel plot with some great cutaways, one-liners, and running gags, temporarily masking the long-standing problems with the show.\\" Carter Dotson of TV Fanatic gave the episode two and a half stars out of five, saying \\"Maybe the series is making intentional strides towards occasionally being a disturbing display of the lack of humanity that can be seen from Quahog‚Äôs residents. But it often just falls flat because the show is generally so misanthropic that even more ‚Äòserious‚Äô affairs just come off as not being funny, rather than poignant in any way. There were some funny moments in this one, as collected on our Family Guy quotes page, but overall, the less said about it, the better.\\" References  External links  * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Family Guy (season 11) episodes Category:American LGBT-related television episodes ","title":"Friends Without Benefits"},{"id":"37883870","text":"Barbara Jacak () is a nuclear physicist who uses heavy ion collisions for fundamental studies of hot, dense nuclear matter.

Also known as: the \\"John D. Adams Artillery,\\" or usually just \\"Adams Artillery\\"; Gaines' Battery; McNally's Battery. The battery made the crossing of the Mississippi River in April 1862 with Major General Earl Van Dorn's Army of the West. After being surrendered at the conclusion of the Vicksburg Campaign, the battery was reorganized in the Department of the Trans-Mississippi and served there for the remainder of the war.  Organization  The battery was organized as the \\"John D. Adams Artillery,\\" and mustered into state service in April, 1861. It was later re- enlisted for Confederate service, effective December 1, 1861.Sikakis, Stewart, Compendium of the Confederate Armies, Florida and Arkansas, Facts on File, Inc., 1992, , page 32. The unit was named in honor of an Arkansas Veteran of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. John D. Adams had served as a private in Colonel Yell's 1st Regiment of Arkansas Mounted Gunmen and suffered a wound at the Battle of Buena Vista. Following the war he became a successful merchant, planter and steamboat operation in Little Rock. John D. Adams did not serve with the battery that bore his name. He did later obtain a commission as a Major in the Quartermaster Department under General Thomas C. Hindman.GOODSPEED'S HISTORY OF PULASKI COUNTY, ARKANSAS, 1889, Page 415, as transcribed by Charlotte Curlee Ramsey and Pat Stacks Ramsey 2006, accessed 13 February 2013, http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~cramsey/Goodspeeds.Pulaski.Co.AR.by.CRamsey.html#Maj.

Pea Ridge, Civil War Campaign in the West, University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, 1992: 331‚Äì339. The battery participated in the retreat to camp near Van Buren, Arkansas after Pea Ridge, and then moved with the Army of the West to Corinth, Mississippi in April, 1862. The battery reorganized at Corinth on May 16, 1862, as a result of the Confederate Conscription Act, and assigned to support of John Selden Roane's (later Charles W. Phifer's) brigade of Dabney H. Maury's division, Army of the West, serving in northeast Mississippi. Capt. Francis M. McNally assumed command, and it was thereafter known as McNally's Arkansas Battery. The battery fought at the Second Battle of Corinth on October 3‚Äì4, 1862, and at the Battle of Hatchie's Bridge on October 7. The unit served as an unattached battery of Maury's (later John Horace Forney's) division in north central Mississippi from November, 1862, to April 1863, fighting in an engagement at Oakland, Mississippi, on December 3.United States.

When McNally's Battery was subsequently reformed back in Arkansas, Moore's section was stranded east of the Mississippi. It was subsequently attached to King's 2nd Missouri Battery and served east of the Mississippi to the end of the war. This section served with Cosby's brigade, Jackson's division, Lee's cavalry corps. General Ulysses S. Grant initially demanded the conditional surrender of the Vicksburg garrison, but faced with the necessity of feeding 30,000 starving Confederates and having the idea that these soldiers might do more harm to the Confederate cause by being released to return home rather than being exchanged as whole units, he relented and allowed for the immediate parole of the unit. According to the Confederate War Department, the Union leader encouraged the surrendered Confederates to simply return home, rather than being officially paroled and exchanged. The able bodied Confederate soldiers who were released on parole walked out of Vicksburg (they were not allowed to proceed in any military formations) on July 11, 1863. Paroling of these able bodied men was completed in their respective camps inside Vicksburg prior to July 11. Those who were wounded or sick in the various hospitals in Vicksburg were paroled, and were released, as soon as they could leave on their own. July 15/16 is the most common date of these Vicksburg hospital paroles. Some of the most seriously wounded and sick were sent by steamship down the Mississippi River and over to Mobile, Alabama, where they were delivered on parole to Confederate authorities.Simmons, Hugh \\"Re: 46th AL Co.

Most of the Arkansas units, including many survivors of McNally's Battery, appear to have bypassed the established parole camps, and possibly with the support, or at least by the compliancy, of their Union captors, simply crossed the river and returned home. Because so many of the Vicksburg parolees, especially from Arkansas, simply went home, Major General Pemberton requested Confederate President Davis grant the men a thirty- to sixty-day furlough.Martin.

The furloughs were not strictly adhered to so long as the soldier eventually showed up at a parole camp to be declared exchanged and returned to duty. Those who went directly home were treated as if they had been home on furlough if they eventually reported into one of these two parole centers. The exchange declaration reports issued by Colonel Robert Ould in Richmond for various units in the Vicksburg and Port Hudson surrenders began in September 1863 based upon men who actually reported to one of the two parole camps. Pemberton eventually coordinated with the Confederate War Department and Confederate General Kirby Smith, commanding the Department of the Trans-Mississippi, to have the Arkansas Vicksburg parolee's rendezvous point established at Camden, Arkansas.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"Re: Paroled\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 14 July 2009, Accessed 11 June 2012, http://history- sites.com/cgi-bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=20383 The battery was reorganized in Arkansas using four 6-pounder smoothbores.Edward G.

One of the last reports of the unit comes from the report of Union Scout C. S. Bell, who was attempting to pass through southern Arkansas when he was recognized and imprisoned. He wonn release, only to be conscripted into Confederate Service and assigned to McNally's Battery. Bell was sent, in leg irons, to join McNally's Battery on April 19, 1865, at Rocky Mountain, La., northeast of Shreveport. A few days after reaching is new command, he witnessed the reading of an order from General Kirby Smith dated the 23 April 1865 in which Smith recounted the disasters to Lee's army and bade his army to be hopeful; to not abandon their colors; that the eyes of the world were upon them; that their resources were inexhaustible, and that on them depended the fate of the Confederacy.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"Spy's report (long, but worth it)\\" Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 8/15/2007, Accessed 3 April 2013, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs62x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?md=read;id=16360 The battery was involved in the following engagements: *Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, March 6‚Äì8, 1862.

Although Doap Nixon only appeared on \\"7th Ghost\\" due to personal issues and work on Sour Diesel 2, he said that he would be more of a presence on the November LP. King Syze released his fourth studio album, Union Terminology, a month before In Death Reborn release. Apathy pushed back the release date of his album, Connecticut Casual, from April to June in favor of In Death Reborn. Former Pharaoh Jus Allah did not appear on the album, due to personal issues and was working on his second studio album, Meanest Man Alive . A week before the release of In Death Reborn, Zilla announced that he was working on Martyr Musick, his fourth album, which was pushed back to a 2015 release. Album art The first update the group released about In Death Reborn was the album art, which was leaked on the Jedi Mind Tricks website on February 11, 2014. The album art was designed by graphic designer and photographer Dan Bradley. Bradley (who had worked on the art since October 2013) also designed the cover of Heavy Lies the Crown, and had designed album art for AOTP members for nine years. The album art differs from the group's other releases; instead of a pharaoh, there is a soldier wearing a gas mask. It was later said that the cover looked oddly familiar; it was drawn from the same stock photography bank as Punch's Frozen Memory mixtape cover, which was released in November 2013 and was considered to have inspired the album art. On September 28, 2018, Vinnie Paz released his album The Pain Collector, which featured the single \\"Gas Mask\\". Paz stated that the single was partially inspired by the album art of In Death Reborn. Singles Doap Nixon, Esoteric, Celph Titled & Paz have made an appearance on all AOTP studio albums. The group released their first single with a music video from the album on March 11, 2014; God Particle featured members Vinnie Paz, Planetary, Esoteric, Apathy and Celph Titled, and was produced by Stu Bangas with cuts by DJ Kwestion. The music video had appearances by other members, including Reef the Lost Cauze, Blacastan, Doap Nixon and Crypt the Warchild. The video was directed by Jimmy Giambrone and co-directed by Steve Perrong. On March 31, 2014, Paz uploaded Army of the Pharaohs: Behind the Scenes to YouTube. The episode showed Army of the Pharaohs members behind the scenes as they filmed the video for \\"God Particle\\" and prepare to perform together in Philadelphia for the first time in years. On the launch of the album, the group released a remixed version of the single which was entirely remixed by Mr. Green and was available only on iTunes as a bonus track. The music video was directed by Sam-Lipman Stern. Paz released the album's second single, \\"Curse of the Pharaohs\\", on April 7, 2014. The single featured Paz, Apathy, Celph Titled, Esoteric and Reef the Lost Cauze, and was produced by Blastah Beatz. The group released their third single, The Demon's Blade\\", and a music video on June 4, 2014. The music video contained scenes of Army of the Pharaohs performing worldwide onstage and scenes from Army of the Pharaohs: Behind the Scenes. The single featured Paz, Celph Titled, Apathy, Blacastan, Planetary and Esoteric, and was produced by Leaf Dog. Production Celph Titled and Apathy provided vocals on 11 of the 14 tracks, and Apathy produced a track for the album. In March 2014, producers Stu Bangas, C-Lance, Leaf Dog, and Panik were confirmed to produce the album. Bangas was affiliated with Army of the Pharaoh members since 2006, produced Doap Nixon's The Wait Is Over, and released a collaboration album with Blacastan and Machete Mode with Esoteric; he produced \\"God Particle\\". C-Lance, a long time affiliate with Jedi Mind Tricks, was one of two producers to produce more than one track: \\"Midnight Burial\\" and \\"See You in Hell\\". Vanderslice, another long-time affiliate with Army of the Pharaohs, produced \\"Broken Safeties\\". French production duo Crown and Supervillain produced \\"7th Ghost\\". It was their first collaboration with Army of the Pharaohs, although they had made a remixed version of Jedi Mind Tricks' \\"Street Lights\\". The album was noted for its different beats, due to the number of producers. Frank Grimes produced the album's second single, \\"Curse of the Pharaohs\\", and its final song: \\"Sumerians\\". British producer Leaf Dog, former DJ of The Three Amigos, made his debut on the American hip-hop scene by producing the album's third single: \\"The Demon's Blade\\". Panik, one-fourth of the hip hop production team Molemen, collaborated for the first time with Army of the Pharaohs on \\"Ninkyo Dantai (Yakuza)\\". Other producers included Paul Nice, Juan Muteniac and Lecs Beats, none of whom who had previously collaborated with Army of the Pharaohs. Critical reception In Death Reborn received generally positive reviews from music critics. Mark Bozzer of Exclaim! gave the album a 7/10 rating, calling it \\"a hard-hitting slab of jacked-up fight music that combines aggressive beats with aggressive yet intricate wordplay.\\" He gave praise to the producers of the album including the likes of underground and, as he described, \\"highly slept-on\\" producers Stu Bangas and Vanderslice. Both of whom crafted classics in Blaq Poet's 2011 Blaq Poet Society, amongst others. The mag described the group as dropping knowledge on songs that resemble a B Movie horrorfest in terms of track title and subject matters. Omar Burgess of HipHopDX rated the album 3.5/5, saying that it had sufficient experimentation and raw talent to entice in casual listeners whilst still providing to its loyal fan base. According to Burgess, \\"Hardcore material representative of Hip Hop made in the mid-to-late '90s has been taking a beating in some circles.\\" He critiqued the groups use of phrases like Rappity-Rap and Boom-Bap and how it epitomizes aggressive rap, infused with similes and metaphors stressed with sample-based production.\\" Army of the Pharaoh's individual and collective careers originated from that era and the group rarely give off the impression of being threatened by this stigma. He went on to say that 16 years later, AOTP divides their time between concurrently conserving Hip Hop's Golden Era and affirming their current importance by competitively out-rhyming each other despite various lineup changes and over a decade of seeing rap change. RapReviews' Grant Jones gave the album a score of 5.5/10, with a music vibe of 5/10 and a lyrical vibe of 6/10: Jones described his review as \\"harsh\\" but felt that this album summarises what Army of the Pharaohs has become, whilst still crediting the group as underground's most prominent supergroup and a modern example of underground hip hop. Even though the group has declared authenticity in their previous and individual albums, Jones described In Death Reborn as one that feels the \\"most manufactured\\" compared to all their releases. He added that the \\"production is provided by different producers on each song, and the vocals lack any real cohesion, almost as if each one was recorded on its own, emailed and pieced together.\\" However, he embraced the groups' collaboration with Leaf Dog, whom he describes as one of the best British producers, for his work on \\"The Demon's Blade\\" as an explosive track that hits the listener after 15 minutes of \\"predictable, water-treading hip hop.\\" Noting its resemblance to previous singles \\"Seven\\" and \\"Battle Cry\\" from earlier LPs. \\"Visual Camouflage\\" produced by Juan Muteniac was another noteworthy performance by Army of the Pharaohs according to RapReviews, as it appealed character and ultimately binding the rappers with a track \\"worth rewinding\\" whilst concluding that the rest of the album is decidedly average. AllMusic's David Jeffries rated In Death Reborn 4/5. He praised the album as one that immediately feels old school due to significant participation from original member Esoteric. \\"That unapologetic, brutal dude attitude is in full force as \\"Midnight Burial\\" barks the lyrics 'I'm out to make a million/Kinda hard to do without pussies catchin' feelings' whilst the 13th track of the album \\"7th Ghost\\" threatens 'me peeling your grill off the front of our Hummer truck' because that's what gas guzzlers were made to do.\\" In terms of production, Jeffries reviewed lead single \\"God Particle\\" as one that is a \\"new kind of stomping electro hulk\\" by Stu Bangas, whilst rapper and producer Apathy \\"puts a funky, harpsichord-driven ghost dance\\" below \\"Headless Ritual\\". He concluded by describing the album as \\"the flying death ball from Phantasm, driven by the hunger for blood and focused on looking for a forehead to lodge itself into\\".

Also known as: Dallas Artillery and Hart's Arkansas Battery.Note that the records of Hart's Dallas (Arkansas) Artillery are sometimes confused with those of Good's Dallas (Texas) Light Artillery. The battery was re-organized on two occasions. Following a charge of cowardice during Battle of Pea Ridge, the battery was ordered to disband. After being cleared of that charge the battery was reorganized and served until it was captured at the Battle of Arkansas Post. After being exchanged and re-organized for the second time, it served until the final surrender of Confederate forces in May 1865.  Organization  The Dallas Artillery was organized at Dallas, Polk County, Arkansas, in the late spring of 1861, and enlisted in Confederate service at Fayetteville on August 1, 1861, with 75 officers and men on the rolls. The original officers included Captain William Hart, First Lieutenant J. W. Thomas, and Second Lieutenant Charles Ringer. The battery was equipped with four 6-pounder guns.Shea, William & Hess, Earl.

General Earl Van Dorn ordered Hart's Battery and Clark's Missouri Battery from reserve into the front line. Hart's Battery arrived first and unlimbered but came under converging fire from twenty-one Federal guns.William Shea and Earl Hess in \\"Pea Ridge: Civil War Campaign in the West,\\" Hart's men, who were green and untried, became unnerved by the enemy fire and within minutes limbered to the rear. On reaching Elkhorn Tavern, Hart complained to Van Dorn that the fire had been too hot for them. In anger Van Dorn placed him under arrest for cowardice, redistributed his ammunition to Clark's Battery and ordered Hart's guns to the rear.United States. War Dept..

John A. McClernand totaling over 33,000 along with a Naval Taskforce under the command of Admiral David D. Porter. On the morning of January 11 McClernand's forces were deployed in an arc facing Fort Hindman and its rifle-pits. Churchill's defenses were manned by Colonel James Deshler's brigade on the left and Colonel Robert Garland's brigade on the right. One section of 6 pound guns from Hart's Battery, under the command of Lieutenant E.A. DuBose was stationed, on the right flank of the 10th Texas Cavalry (dismounted). McClernand's infantry attacked around 1:00pm and made little progress at first. At the same time Porter's gunboats moved in to attack aided by Colonel Lindsey's brigade across the river. Within an hour the fort's east face was reduced to rubble and its artillery silenced.Huffstot, 1969, p. 9 Captain Hart's battery, owing to its initial effectiveness in creating casualties and stopping repeated Union assaults, was singled out for special attention from Union fire, including sharpshooters. Colonel James Desher observed that the fire was so hot that it became impossible for any of Hart's men to show themselves with out being struck. At 4:30pm McClernand was planning to order one massive assault against the defenders when white flags of surrender began to appear. The battle ended with some confusion.Christ, 2010 Porter's gunboats picked up infantry from Lindsey's brigade and ferried them across the river who climbed into the crumbling remains of Fort Hindman. General Steele entered the rifle-pits under a flag of truce to discuss surrender with Colonel Deshler. As the two conferred, Deshler noticed Steele's men continually moving closer and demanded they be ordered to stop or he'd open fire again. General Sherman arrived on the scene to personally seek out Churchill. However, Sherman stood by as Churchill and Colonel Garland became involved in an argument over surrendering. Garland claimed he had been ordered to surrender while Churchill denied giving such an order. Colonel Deshler rode up from his front and declared to the group he had not surrendered at all and insisted on renewing the fight. Sherman ended the argument by pointing out the Union forces had all but occupied the Confederate's works. Some Union soldiers had even began disarming the Confederates.Smith, 2013 From all accounts, Hart's Battery served their guns professionally and courageously during the siege. Col. Robert R. Garland's report stated: Another Texas commander describing the service of Hart's Battery at Arkansas Post stated: All but two of the 83 horses assigned to Hart's battery were killed and one of his guns was disabled. The battery with 83 officers and men and six guns was captured with the rest of the garrison when Confederate forces surrendered on January 11, 1863. The battery suffered three killed, thirteen wounded and twenty two missing during the Battle of Arkansas Post.United States. War Dept..

Prisoners of War Captain Hart and other members of the battery were taken as Prisoners of War via steamship first to St. Louis, Missouri, a few of the sick and wounded were left there at the Gratiot Street Military Prison. The enlisted prisoners were moved via rail to Camp Butler, at Springfield Illinois. Upon arriving at Camp Butler, the prisoners were divided into companies of 80 to 120 men each for housing. The enlisted men of Hart's Battery were assigned quarters with Captain Dennison's and Captain Nutt's Louisiana Cavalry companies and the \\"W. P. Lane Rangers of Texas. Many prisoners died in prison camp, a few others took the oath of allegiance to the Union and were released, most simply waited to be exchanged. The officers were moved to Camp Chase, Ohio, arrived there on Jan 29, 1863. Lieutenant William T.

By the spring of 1863, when the Arkansas and Texas prisoners from Arkansas Post were due to be exchanged, General U.S. Grant wanted to avoid these exchanged prisoners becoming additional replacements for the garrison at Vicksburg, which was the object of his operations at that time. Grant arranged for the Arkansas Post prisoners to be exchanged at City Point Virginia instead of Vicksburg.Odom, Danny, \\"Re: Attn: Bob Meeks, re Artillery Transfers\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 12/13/2013, Accessed 13 December 2013, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs62x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?page=1;md=read;id=28921 Approximately 2500 prisoners from Arkansas Post were released at City Point, Virginia, on April 10, 1862, but many were sick and not available for duty.

The call for more troops had become universal from every theater of war by now. Considerable discussions were underway with Lee and the War Department regarding the necessity to reinforce Bragg's army in Tennessee or the garrison at Vicksburg, on the Mississippi. Subsequently, General Bragg was ordered to detach troops from his army to reinforce the Vicksburg garrison. On to Richmond! On April 15, 1863, Gen Cooper wrote to Gen French, commanding at Petersburg, where the Arkansas Post Prisoners were being housed, \\"It is impossible to send officers from here to take charge of prisoners to go West. I will let you know tomorrow what disposition is to be made of the Arkansas prisoners.\\" On April 30, 1863, the following messages was sent to Capt D Meyers AAG Petersburg, \\"‚Ä¶. In respect to the 2500 exchanged prisoners at Model Farm Barracks [Petersburg] reported by you it is desirable that those captured at Ark Post should be immediately organized into their original Co's and the NCO's assigned to their respective Co's.

With very few troops available to counter a raid on the capital by Union Major General George Stoneman's 10,000-strong cavalry force, the Confederate War Department called on the returned Arkansas Post prisoners, then being housed in Petersburg awaiting the release of their officers, to help defend the capitol. On May 1, 1863, \\"at 3 o'clock in the morning we are ordered to fall-in, are marched to the armory and every able man was issued full equipage for the field‚Ä¶.\\" William Williston Heartsill journal, 1861-1866, MS 035, Woodson Research Center, Fondren Library, Rice University., Page 125, Accessed 13 December 2013, http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015027744542?urlappend=%3Bseq=185 That evening, the Arkansas Post Prisoners were marched from \\"Moddle Farm\\" into the northern suburbs of Richmond and to man the fortifications of the city's defensive works. By May 5, 1863, the officers of the Arkansas units had apparently been received. \\"Richmond AG to Capt Chas D Meyers AAG Petersburg- Send here the exchanged officers referred to in Petersburg Dispatch, especially those belonging to the Texas troops sent here yesterday.\\" On that afternoon, an ad hoc battalion composed of the released prisoners of the 19th and 24th Arkansas Infantry Regiments, along with several Texas Cavaly companies and the remnants of Hart's Arkansas Battery, were sent outside of Richmond on the Chancellorsville Road to protect against another possible raid by Union Forces. That same day Confederate Secretary of War Seddon directed Confederate General Joe Johnston to \\"Proceed at once to Ms and take chief command of the force's, as far as practical---Arrange to take with you -- 3000 good troops, who will be substituted in Gen Bragg's army by a large number of prisoners recently returned from Arkansas Post, captured and reorganized, now on their way to Gen Pemberton. Stop them at the point most convenient to Gen Bragg.\\" On May 6, 1863, the Texas Troops from Arkansas Post, along with Hart's Battery were allowed to make their quarters in the Confederate Capitol building in Richmond. The consolidated 19th/24th Arkansas and Harts battery left Richmond, on May 11, 1863, ordered to report to the Army of the Tennessee at Tullahoma, Tennessee. The Arkansas Post units were consolidated after they reported for duty with Bragg's army at Tullahoma Tennessee. Exactly how the surviving enlisted personnel from Hart's second battery were utilized during the Chickamauga and Chattanooga campaigns is unclear as the Compiled Service Records for most members of the unit end with the prisoners being exchanged at City Point Virginia. One member of the Battery, Private S. B. Wilson was captured on September 11, 1863, at Chattanooga Tenn. The consolidated 19th/24th Arkansas Infantry Regiment participated in the Battle of Chickamauga, September 19‚Äì20, 1863 in northern Georgia as part of Dresher's Brigade, which was composed of the Released Arkansas Post Prisoners.Official Records, Series I, Volume XXX, Part 2, pages 11-20 On March 21, 1864, Brigadier General W.N. Pendleton provided a report of his inspection of the various artillery battalions belonging to the Army of Tennessee. Attachment No. 4 to that inspection report was the statistical report of the battalion of artillery, of Hood's Corps, commanded by Captain Robert Cobb. Captain Cobb's report has includes a footnote that referrers to the disposition of Hart's Arkansas Battery. Cobb's Kentucky Battery would serve during the Atlanta Campaign. The Battery was surrendered by Lieutenant General Richard Taylor, Commanding the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana, at Citronelle, Alabama, on May 4, 1865.Hutchinson, Dennis: \\"Cobb's Kentucky Battery\\", Accessed 4 November 2011, Third Organization The consolidation of Arkansas Post units when they reached the Army of Tennessee at Tullahoma Tennessee created supernumerary (excess officers without official assignment) officers who returned to the Department of the Trans-Mississippi. It seems that Captain Hart fell into this category and this explains his eventual return to the Department of the Trans-Mississippi. After being exchanged in May 1863, Hart likely moved from Virginia to Tullahoma with the remnants of the battery and then made his way back across country and across the Mississippi River to rejoin confederate forces in the Department of the Trans-Mississippi. Exactly when the third organization of Hart's battery occurred is unclear. There are few references to Hart's Battery during the last year of the war and there are no surviving muster rolls from the third organization. On February 25, 1864, Hart and another former battery officer, Lieutenant William T. Tiller were in Houston Texas. Lieutenant Tiller had made application to become a Cadet, (a type of officer in training) in the Confederate Army, and Captain Hart provided a letter of recommendation. This may indicated that Lieutenant Tiller and Captain Hart were still considered supernumary (excess) officers. Lieutenant Tiller eventually joined Captain O. G. Jones Company of Texas Light Artillery as a second lieutenant.The National Archives, Publication Number: M322, Publication Title: Compiled Service Records of Confederate Soldiers Who Served in Organizations from the State of Missouri, Content Source: NARA, National Archives Catalog ID: 586957, National Archives Catalog Title: Carded Records Showing Military Service of Soldiers Who Fought in Confederate Organizations , compiled 1903 - 1927, documenting the period 1861 ‚Äì 1865, Record Group: 109, State: Missouri, Short Description: NARA M322.

It enclosed a large and popular public garden in the ancient city of Rome. The porticus was finished in 62 BC. and has a history spanning hundreds of years. The colonnades contained arcades and gallaries that displayed sculptures and paintings collected from years of war campaigns of its patron and builder, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus. Over time the site became rows of shops that occupied what were the galleries and arcades. As the ground level rose from constant flooding from the Tiber River, much of the original architectural elements were re-used by shop owners to adhorn their structures at higher levels. Today, many of these shops still exist and fragments of the old theatre and porticus can be seen embedded in the ancient walls of many of the buildings. History The ancient city of Rome was designed with covered walkways, public gardens as well as large pools and fountains that were common by the 1st century AD. Citizens would stroll throughout the city under these colonnades, shaded from the sun and rain. The first and most popular of these gardens was located in the quadriporticus that Pompey built to adjoin the theatre that also bore his name. Pompey, impressed or inspired by what he saw during his years of travel and campaigning for Rome, returned with a desire to build a monument to himself larger than any other before. A theatre, porticus and curia were built in a huge complex that became a symbol of Roman culture for centuries and was emulated across the Republic and empire. Architecture The entrance to the theatre complex was tightly controlled at either side of the Curia of Pompey. This was to guide the visitor's sight directly along the inner garden area to the main doorway (regia) to the stage of the theatre and up to the temple of Venus Victrix. This sightline was permanently disprupted in 32 BC when Augustus had a stone scaena built.

R. Nagesh was an English teacher and lecturer in the two coastal districts of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada of Karnataka, South India. His passion was theater; and is known best for his off beat plays that he had directed in Udupi, Mulki, Kundapur, Mangalore, Kasargodu, Chikmagaluru and other places in the area. His plays, often subtle, intense and throwing up various possibilities for interpretations, brought a new wave of freshness to the theater scene of the area that he catered to; in the 1970s and 1980s. He has also written novels, short stories, humorous essays and critical and historical accounts in subjects pertaining to theater. He wrote under the pen name of Nachiketa. Birth and death Nagesh was born on 10 November 1931 at Mangalore and died on 10 March 2007 in his own flat at Dombivli west Thane district Mumbai, where he was residing with his wife Mrs Ramabai, along with his younger daughter's family. Professional career Nagesh taught in schools and colleges in the towns of Kundapur and Mulky; and he finally settled down in as an English lecturer in Poorna Prajna College in Udupi. The nature of his theater work Although Nagesh created his plays in an era that can now be called the B V Karanth era in Karnataka and although he could not but be impacted by the man, he tread a separate path for himself. Unlike the productions of many of his contemporaries of his era, his theatrical productions never bore the stamp of Karanth nor that of the NSD style of production that Karanth brought with him. Based out of a small place like Udupi, Nagesh kept track of what was happening in the field of theater; the world over. His ideas, like that of his contemporary Udyavara Madhava Acharya, were original. But like Acharya, Nagesh did not extensively use dance forms as a mode of expression in his stage narratives; although he tried his hand in directing some musical plays of K Shivarama Karanth in an early stage of his life. Nagesh often thought out-of-the-box. In the production of 'Vibrame' (Delusion), a translation of a Badal Sarkar play, he is said to have tried to stimulate the smell of the dead body by burning some raw vegetables. Subtle humor to comment on a situation was his forte. He took great care in the stage setting, properties, costumes, lighting, visual look, colour patterns and stage movements ‚Äì so much so that the designs that he created through his theatrical tools often told a story by themselves. Though he weaned towards a somber minimalist approach, he insisted that the settings and costumes be prepared afresh and so, his productions cost a lot. He valued theater discipline and was often said to cancel rehearsals when anyone came late. In the 1990s, his productions became rarities. After retirement, he shifted first to Bengaluru and then to Mumbai, where he died due to old age related illness. Awards Nagesh was the recipient of the Karnataka Theater Academy.

Konrad Hahn started his career at the European championship in 1996, achieving three podium positions and a fifth rank on the overall standings by 1999. That same year he survived a major crash unharmed. During the race at the Circuit Zolder, his truck crashed into a wall at 156 km/h (97 mi/h).

Today used by Norfolk Southern, it consists of two rail lines: the Morrisville Line, which runs between Morrisville and Earnest (near Norristown), and the Dale Secondary between Earnest and Glenloch. The corridor was opened by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1892 to allow main line freight traffic to run between New York City and Harrisburg without passing through Philadelphia. The Trenton Cutoff goes through the suburbs north and west of the city. The second track (the original westbound track) was removed by Conrail around 1992. Compare with A low-grade line, the Trenton Cutoff runs from Morrisville Yard on the Northeast Corridor to GLEN interlocking where it joins the Amtrak-owned Keystone Corridor (Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line). Between Morrisville and Earnest, the Trenton Cutoff has active freight service. At Earnest, the Trenton Cutoff connects with the SEPTA Manayunk/Norristown Line (former Reading Railroad), with a connection to Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line via a bridge over the Schuylkill River west of the Norristown Transportation Center. From Earnest west to GLEN interlocking, the Trenton Cutoff is a single track in dark (unsignaled) territory. As of 2014, it sees one freight per day, carrying ArcelorMittal steel from Coatesville to Conshohocken. Originally a two-tracked electrified rail line, the catenary wire over the tracks was dismantled by NS to provide greater overhead clearance for double-stack container trains. The high voltage transmission lines running along the Trenton Cutoff from Norristown, where the Trenton Cutoff crosses over the abandoned Pennsylvania Railroad Schuylkill Branch, to Glenloch are part of Amtrak's 25 Hz traction power system, used to power trains on the Northeast Corridor and the Keystone Corridor.

The goal of this unrealized project was to create an inland sea that would cover the substantial areas of the Sahara Desert which lie below sea level, bringing humid air, rain, and agriculture deep into the desert. The possibility of such a project was raised several times by different scientists and engineers during the late 19th century and early 20th century, primarily from European colonial powers in Africa. The concept of a flooded Sahara was also featured in novels of the time. History 19th century In 1877 the Scottish entrepreneur and abolitionist Donald Mackenzie was the first to propose the creation of a Sahara Sea. Mackenzie's idea was to cut a channel from one of the sand-barred lagoons north of Cape Juby, south to a large plain which Arab traders had identified to him as El Djouf. Mackenzie believed this vast region was up to below sea level and that flooding it would create an inland sea of suited to commercial navigation and even agriculture. He further believed that geological evidence suggested this basin had once been connected to the Atlantic via a channel near the Saguia el-Hamra. He proposed that this inland sea, if augmented with a canal, could provide access to the Niger River and the markets and rich resources of West Africa. There are several small depressions in the vicinity of Cape Juby; at 55 m below sea level, the Sebkha Tah is the lowest and largest. But it covers less than 250 km¬≤ and is 500 km north of the geographical area identified as El Djouf (also known as the Majabat al-Koubra) which has an average elevation of 320m. Mackenzie never travelled in this area but had read of other sub-sea level desert basins in present-day Tunisia, Algeria, and Egypt similar to those found near Cape Juby. These basins contain seasonally dry salt lakes, known as chotts or sebkhas. Rourdaire's proposed Sahara Sea Fran√ßois Elie Roudaire, a French geographer, and Ferdinand de Lesseps, a diplomat influential in the creation of the Suez Canal, proposed this area for the creation of an inland sea in 1878. Roudaire and de Lesseps proposed that a channel be cut from the Gulf of Gab√®s in the Mediterranean to the Chott el Fejej which would allow the sea to drain into these basins. They were not specific in the area such a sea would cover (although subsequent analyses suggested that it would be considerably smaller than Mackenzie's proposal at only in area), but argued that the new inland sea would improve the quality of weather on the European continent. The estimated cost of the Roudaire project was $30,000,000 at the time. While Roudaire and de Lesseps were optimistic about the weather effects that such an inland sea would produce in Europe, others were not as hopeful. Alexander William Mitchinson argued that flooding substantial areas would create disease-ridden swamps. Others were critical of the feasibility of the project or the proposal to join the sea at El Djouf with the sea in what is now Tunisia and Algeria. The project was ultimately rejected by the French Government and funding was withdrawn when surveys revealed that many areas were not below sea level as had been believed. 20th century The proposal to create a Sahara Sea was revived in the early 1900s by French professor Edmund Etchegoyen. Around 1910, Etchegoyen proposed that a longer and deeper channel could be constructed. He argued that such a sea could be a boon for colonization and could potentially produce an inland sea half the size of the Mediterranean. This proposal was considered by the French government but also rejected. Critics noted that, while some parts of the Sahara Desert were indeed below sea level, much of the Sahara Desert was above sea level. This, they said, would produce an irregular sea of bays and coves; it would also be considerably smaller than estimates by Etchegoyen suggested. Map of the Qattara Depression illustrating the proposed routes of canals or tunnels linking it to the Mediterranean A proposal similar to that of Roudaire and de Lesseps was raised by members of Operation Plowshare, an American idea to use nuclear explosives in civil engineering projects such as the Qattara Depression Project. It was also suggested that nuclear explosives might be detonated to create a channel from the Mediterranean to the chotts of Tunisia. This proposal was abandoned, however, with the signing of various treaties prohibiting peaceful nuclear explosions. 21st century The project regained steam in the mid 2010s with the creation of the association Cooperation Roadhttps://www.medinsahara.org/copia- di-home which in 2018 obtained the approval of the Tunisian government.https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fantonio.demartini.589%2Fposts%2F1374115362734251&width;=500\\" Appearances in literature The notion of a Sahara Sea has been featured several times in literature, most notably in Jules Verne's last novel, Invasion of the Sea, which directly referred to the plan of Roudaire and de Lesseps. The idea of a flooded Sahara Desert also occurs in The Secret People by John Wyndham. Other desert flooding projects Since the late 19th century there have been proposals to connect Lake Eyre in the South Australian desert to the ocean via canal. In 1905, engineers working on an irrigation canal in southern California accidentally released the waters of the Colorado River into a formerly dry basin, creating a large saline lake known as the Salton Sea. Although the lake has shrunk considerably since its creation, it remains the largest lake in the state of California.

Carl William Lesch (1924‚Äì1983) was an American Roman Catholic educator, director, and musical conductor and instructor associated with many institutions in the New York Metropolitan area. Lesch started his career as a young man in the 1940s when he took over the position of choral director at St. Margaret Mary's Church in Midland Beach, Staten Island. There he organized a new boys choir and eventually led this group, serving as conductor, to the a first-place gold cup victory in a Town Hall music competition. In 1949 he became organist and choirmaster of St. Henry's Church in Bayonne, New Jersey and quickly organized a choir of 60 men and boys who would go on to local fame when their performances began to be broadcast live on The Catholic Hour in 1954 and 1955, as well as concertized throughout the metropolitan area. For 10 years in this era they put on an annual Easter Sunday Concert at the famous Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan. From his work at St. Henry's the Archdiocese of Newark promoted Lesch to assistant director of music. In that position he conducted massed choirs inclusive of all of the high schools in the diocese, with performances at Seton Hall University. Lesch is perhaps most remembered for his work in his home community of Staten Island. He served as director of music, and led the men's and boys' choir, of Sacred Heart Parish on Staten Island from the 1960s until his death. A graduate of St. Peter's Boys High School, he went on to teach there and organized their musical performances for twenty-five years, as well as lent his talents to other island institutions including Monsignor Farrell High School, Moore Catholic High School, and Troubadors of Song Chorus, amongst others, til his death in 1983. His tributes as director from this period include revivals of ‚ÄúOklahoma!‚Äù ‚ÄúAnnie Get Your Gun‚Äù ‚ÄúSouth Pacific,‚Äù ‚ÄúHello Dolly,‚Äù ‚ÄúBrigadoon,‚Äù ‚ÄúOn The Town‚Äù and ‚ÄúCarousel‚Äù, amongst many. Organized in 2009, the St. Peter's High School Glee Club and Seton Chorale Alumni association, made up of graduates of St. Peter's Boys and St. Peter's Girls High Schools, operates a scholarship fund in honor of Lesch.

Also known as: the Washington Artillery and Etter's Battery. The Washington Artillery spent its entire existence in the Department of the Trans-Mississippi, serving in Arkansas and Louisiana. Organization After the Battle of Pea Ridge, General Earl Van Dorn was ordered to move his Army of the West across the Mississippi River and cooperate with Confederate forces in Northern Mississippi. Van Dorn stripped the state of military hardware of all types, including almost all the serviceable artillery. When General Thomas C. Hindman arrived on May 31, 1862, to assume command of the new Trans-Mississippi District, he found almost no organized troops to command. He quickly began organizing new regiments, but his most pressing need was for arms for the new forces he was organizing, including the artillery. With Hindman's first order, dated May 31, 1862, at Little Rock, he announced his staff, including the appointment of Major Francis A.

Chambers had previously served in the Hempstead Rifles, a volunteer militia company from the 8th Regiment of Arkansas Militia which became Company B, 3rd Regiment, Arkansas State Troops. Apparently some effort was made to provide the battery with conscripts from Hempstead County, but these men had already been assigned to Colonel Grinstead's 33rd Arkansas Infantry Regiment.

An examination of the CSR's for the men of Etter's Battery shows a company return for December 1862. Cards for various members of the battery indicate that they were at Little Rock from October to December 1862 (and probably into January 1863). Of the approximately seventy men listed in the battery, the December return shows twelve were either sick or had died, another five had deserted and four were assigned to wagon driving duties. During the same period of time the battery had received only two new enlistments. Additionally, a card for Lt. John C. Arnett states that he left the company on the December 4, 1862, on recruiting duty. Take together, these circumstances may indicate that the unit was struggling to have enough men to man the guns and that this was the reason the battery was left behind for the Prairie Grove campaign.Osborne, Phil, \\"Re: Etter's Arkansas Battery\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 3/11/2013, Accessed 7 June 2013, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs62x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?md=read;id=27983 When General Holmes reported on the organization of the Army of the Trans-Mississippi on December 12, 1862, five days after the Battle of Prairie Grove, he listed Etter's Battery as belonging to Bradfute's Brigade of dismounted Texas Cavalry, of Brigadier General Roan's Division of Major General Hindman's First Corps.United States.

November 1916 The Elgin automobile was manufactured by Elgin Motor Car Corporation in Argo, Illinois, from 1916 to 1923, and by Elgin Motors, Inc., in Indianapolis from 1923 to 1924. Elgin Motor Car Corporation was formed in 1916 by several executives from the Elgin Watch Company. The company was based on the former New Era Motor Car Company of Joliet. Upon being taken over, the erstwhile company was moved in its entirety to Elgin, where the new company had a 210,000 square foot factory waiting on 13 acres.Kimes, Beverly Rae.

The Elgin achieved success in the Midwest endurance races in which it was entered. Advertising slogans included \\"The Car of the Hour\\" and \\"Built Like A Watch\\", alluding to the roots of the founders.Kimes, p.526. Dividends of 10% paid in stock in July 1916 and cash dividends of 5% in July 1920 proved so popular with stockholders that stockholder meetings had to be held in a tent. Sales of over $7 million in 1920 made that year the company's best ever. The recession of the early 1920s damaged the company, as it did so many other U.S. auto firms of the time. The company issued $500,000 in bonds to pay off loans and for working capital. Elgin Motors, Inc., was formed by stockholders in June 1923. J.H. McDuffee, formerly of Willys-Overland and Cole, was chosen as president and general manager. It was at this time that the firm was relocated to Indianapolis. The company moved into the former home of Federal Motor Works. By June of the next year, the company was already bankrupt, ending the marque as a whole.

An expert on prisoners of war, Sampson was one of only three Canadian nationals assigned to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) upon preparations for Project Overlord: D-Day, with direct responsibility for repatriating first military, then later civilian POWs. During this period, Sampson lobbied General Eisenhower extensively, and ultimately, successfully, to extend SHAEF command authority to include civilian repatriation, thereby making the liberation of concentration camps a military responsibility. Sampson was awarded the Legion of Merit by Dwight D. Eisenhower at Camp Griffis on 12 December 1944 for his efforts.Air Force Association of Canada. http://airforce.ca/awards.php?search=1&keyword;=&page;=658&mem;=&type;=rcaf The medal is the highest military honor that can be awarded to a foreign national by the U.S. government.

First broadcast on ITV on 15 August 1973, the series ran for 39 episodes over six series until 7 April 1976. Written by Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, the series follows the lives of three flatmates and the couple who sublet the church commissioned property. The series, which was made by Thames Television and recorded at their Teddington Studios, was considered rather risque when it was first broadcast as it focused on a young single man sharing a flat with two young single women. Man About the House led to two spin-off series, George and Mildred and Robin's Nest.

Life Ficher was born in Odessa, Russia, to Alexander Ficher, a trombonist in the Odessa Philharmonic Orchestra, and his wife Iente Mirl (Elena) Gotz . He began to study the violin at the age of five, but his lessons were interrupted when his mother died. In 1903 he was able to resume his violin studies with Pyotr Stolyarsky, and later with M. T. Hait. From 1912 to 1917 he was enrolled at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, where he continued his violin studies with Sergei Korguyev and Leopold Auer. His other teachers included Vasily Kalafati, Maximilian Steinberg, Nikolai Tcherepnin, and Nikolay Sokolov. On 3 June (Gregorian 16 June) 1920 he married Ana Aronberg, then a piano student at the Odessa Conservatory. The Revolution of 1917 was followed by deteriorating conditions in Odessa and so, in order to escape famine and persecution, the family‚Äîincluding his father with his second wife, his youngest brother Rachmiel (who was a cellist) and a sister-in-law‚Äîfled the city, traveling at first to Poland. In 1923 they moved to Argentina, arriving on 10 February, and eventually became citizens of that country. Jacobo and Ana had two children: a son, Miguel, born on 24 June 1923, shortly after their arrival in Buenos Aires, and a daughter, Myra, born 7 February 1928. Ana Aronberg Ficher died on 27 July 1976 . Ficher settled in Buenos Aires, where he was one of the founders in 1929 of the Grupo renovaci√≥n. Later, in 1947, he was also among the founders of the Argentinian Composers' League (; . As an educator, his career began with an appointment in 1943 as professor of Harmony at the Asociaci√≥n General de M√∫sicos de la Argentina. In 1956 he gained a position teaching composition at the National University of La Plata, where he eventually became professor, and in 1958 he became Professor of Composition at Buenos Aires National Conservatory and Musical Advisor to the Fondo Nacional de las Artes. In 1966 he was appointed Professor of Composition at Buenos Aires Conservatorio Municipal Manuel de Falla, and 1968 he became Professor of Instrumentation at the Teatro Col√≥n's Conservatorio e Instituto (; ). His notable pupils include Emilio Kauderer, Marcelo Koc, Alejandro Vi√±ao, and Ezequiel Vi√±ao. Musical style Over the course of a long and prolific career, Ficher employed a variety of styles and techniques, including neoromanticism, neoclassicism, polytonality, twelve-tone technique, serialism, and free atonality, without ever restricting himself to a single methodology . His Jewish heritage is reflected especially in his early works, though the Second Symphony, written in 1933, also uses emotional and rhapsodic Hebrew thematic material, in reaction to news of the Nazi campaign against the Jews in Europe (Slonimsky 1945, 89). This aspect also appears in some later works, especially the cantata Kadish, op. 112 (1969), while the Russian tradition is plain in the two Anton Chekhov operas . French Impressionism and the influence of Paul Hindemith are present in the music from the 1920s and 30s, and as late as the slow movement of the Piano Sonata No. 1 of 1941, which is also reminiscent of Charles Koechlin and Darius Milhaud . Later, he turned to Argentine nationalism, stimulated by gauchesco literature in the overture Don Segundo Sombra (1954) (after the novel by Ricardo G√ºiraldes), popular urban music in Tangos y milongas for piano (1948‚Äì59), rural folk music in Tres danzas populares, and historical themes in the Seventh Symphony, commemorating the Argentine Independence Revolution . Honours According to one source, Ficher's Heroic Poem, op. 7, won first prize in a 1928 contest sponsored by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra . More recent research, however, reveals that no first prize was awarded, but his work shared the second prize with Dmitri Shostakovich . He won the Municipality of Buenos Aires Prize three times, first in 1929 for his First String Quartet, then in 1931 for Sulamita, poema de amor, for orchestra, and finally in 1941, for his First Piano Sonata . His Second String Quartet was awarded a Coolidge Prize of $500 in 1937, at the Festival de M√∫sica de C√°mara Panamericana in Mexico City, and his Third Symphony won first prize of the National Culture Committee in Buenos Aires in 1940 . In 1969 Ficher was elected to the National Fine Arts Academy of Argentina . Other prizes include : *1929 the Asociaci√≥n del Profesorado Orquestal Prize for Obertura pat√©tica, op. 11 *1932 the Asociaci√≥n del Profesorado Orquestal Prize for Tres bocetos sinf√≥nicos inspirados en el Talmud, op. 17 *1936 second prize in a contest sponsored by the Idelssohn Association of Johannesburg, South Africa for La rosa muerta, poema para coro mixto y piano, op. 34 *1942 the E.A.

Consisting of troops who originated from the region of Farghana in Transoxiana, the Faraghina participated in several military campaigns and played a significant role in the politics of the central government, especially during the Anarchy at Samarra. Background Map of Farghana in the early Muslim period Farghana was a frontier province bordering the lands of Islam during the Umayyad and early Abbasid caliphates. Occupying the entire valley to the east of Khujand, it was surrounded to the north, east and south by mountains, with the Syr Darya running through it. The capital of the region was for some time at Kasan in the north; by the Islamic period, however, it had moved to the city of Akhsikath on the bank of the Syr Darya.Barthold, pp. 790-91 Prior to the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana, control of Farghana is described variously in the sources as having been exercised by an Iranian dynasty whose rulers used the title of ikhshid, or by the local Turks in the region.Marshak, p. 274; Barthold, p. 790 Farghana was occupied in 712-3 by Qutayba ibn Muslim, but a firm Muslim presence was not established and the local rulers maintained their hold over the country. Over the course of the eighth century the Muslims repeatedly conducted raids into the valley, but its conquest remained incomplete. It was only during the governorship of Nuh ibn Asad in c. 820-1 that Farghana was more fully incorporated into the Islamic state,Bosworth, p. 253; Barthold, pp. 790-91 and it may have been around this same time that the Faraghina regiment began to be formed.Kennedy, p. 125 Foundation According to the historian al-Mas'udi, the Faraghina regiment was created by al-Mu'tasim (r. 833‚Äì842);Al-Mas'udi, v. 7: p. 118. See also Ibn al-Athir, v. 6: p. 452 it seems likely, however, that the process of recruiting soldiers from Farghana was begun during the reign of al-Ma'mun (r. 813-833). Al-Baladhuri, writing in the late ninth century, recorded that al-Ma'mun sent envoys to recruit men from the people of Transoxiana; after his death, his successor al-Mu'tasim continued this policy to such an extent that Transoxianans soon achieved a dominant role in the caliph's army.Al-Baladhuri, p. 205 The Faraghina were firmly established by the time that al-Mu'tasim decided to construct the new capital of Samarra, and they were given land grants in the city after its completion in 836. According to al-Ya'qubi, the Faraghina were granted allotments adjacent to, but separate from, the quarters of the Turkish soldiers, and that both the Turks and Faraghina were segregated from the general population.Kennedy, p. 119; Gordon, p. 59; al-Ya'qubi, pp. 258-59 The residences of the Faraghina were principally located along the avenues called Shari' al-Barghamish al-Turki and Shari' al- Askar, although some of the regiment officers had allotments along the Shari' al-Hayr al-Jadid.Northedge, p. 170; al-Ya'qubi, pp. 262-63 The Faraghina were only one of several new regiments in al-Mu'tasim's army, serving alongside others such as the Turks, Ushrusaniyya and Maghariba. Of the non-Turkish units, they appear to have been among the largest, and are mentioned relatively frequently in the sources.Gordon, p. 37; Kennedy, p. 127 Al-Ya'qubi referred to at least some of the Faraghina as 'ajam,Al-Ya'qubi, p. 258 a term which has been variously interpreted to mean that may have been non- Muslims,Kennedy, pp. 124-25 non-Arabic speakingNorthedge, p. 99 or uncivilized.Gordon, p. 195 n. 71 In any case, it seems that they were considered as outsiders by the mainstream elements of Muslim society.Gordon, p. 60 History The Faraghina served under al-Mu'tasim and several of his successors The Faraghina are mentioned by al-Tabari as having participated in some of the military campaigns undertaken during al-Mu'tasim's caliphate. They served, for example, under the prominent general al-Afshin in the war against the rebel Babak al-Khurrami in Adharbayjan; during the attack against Babak's fortress of al-Badhdh in 837, they distinguished themselves in battle and played a major part in the capture of the stronghold.Al-Tabari, v. 33: pp. 68-69, 71 In the following year, during al-Mu'tasim's expedition against Amorium, the Farghanan commander Amr al-Farghani was a leading officer in the caliph's army.Al-Tabari, v. 33: pp. 96, 109, 112 While the campaign was underway, however, several Faraghina officers became involved in a plot to kill al-Mu'tasim and replace him with al-'Abbas ibn al-Ma'mun; when the plan was discovered by the caliph, the conspirators, including 'Amr, were rounded up and executed.Al-Tabari, v. 33: pp. 130, 133 Following the assassination of the caliph al-Mutawakkil in December 861, the Faraghina played an important role during the period known as the Anarchy at Samarra (861‚Äì870). In the chaotic years following al-Mutawakkil's death, they frequently participated in the riots that broke out in the capital, and they were said to have been involved in the deaths of the wazir UtamishAl-Tabari, v. 35: pp. 12-13 and the Turkish commanders Wasif al-TurkiAl-Mas'udi, v. 7: p. 396; al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 146 and Salih ibn Wasif.Al-Tabari, v. 36: p. 70 Like the other regiments in Samarra, their main concern during this period was to ensure that they received their pay, as the government was often incapable of providing their salaries in a timely manner.Al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 146; v. 36: p. 107 When civil war broke out between the rival caliphs al-Musta'in and al-Mu'tazz in 865, the Faraghina largely supported the latter.Al-Mas'udi, v. 7: pp. 364-65 Five thousand Turks and Faraghina were part of the initial force sent from Samarra to besiege al-Musta'in in Baghdad,Al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 43 and over the course of the war additional Farghanan soldiers were sent to join the fight.Al- Tabari, v. 35: p. 48 Some of the Faraghina did initially fight for al- Musta'in, such as those under Muzahim ibn Khaqan, but they later joined Muzahim when he decided to defect to al-Mu'tazz's side.Al-Tabari, v. 35: pp. 89-90 After the end of the war, from which al-Mu'tazz emerged victorious, the Faraghina returned to Samarra. As the government continued to suffer from a worsening fiscal crisis, the caliph attempted to favor the Faraghina and Maghariba and use them against the Turks;Al-Mas'udi, v. 7: p 397 in spite of this, however, all three groups united to overthrow al-Mu'tazz in July 869.Al- Tabari, v. 35: p. 164 The next caliph, al-Muhtadi, likewise promised to bestow favors upon the Faraghina and the other non-Turkish regiments of the army. When the Turks under Musa ibn Bugha al-Kabir revolted against the caliph in June 870, the Faraghina defended al-Muhtadi and comprised the bulk of his cavalry; in the resulting battle, they were defeated and suffered heavy losses.Al-Mas'udi, v. 8: pp. 8-9; al-Tabari, v. 36: pp. 91 ff. It is likely that the Faraghina's importance declined after the death of al-Muhtadi and the accession of al-Mu'tamid (r. 870-892). Al-Mu'tamid's brother Abu Ahmad al- Muwaffaq, who became the commander-in-chief of the army, enjoyed strong relations with the Turkish commanders, and he may have preferred the Turks to the exclusion of the Faraghina and other non-Turkish units. After this point, individual Farghanans continued to serve in the army, but the regiment itself largely disappears in the sources.Kennedy, p. 150; al-Tabari, v. 37: pp. 17, 71, 81 Notes References *Al-Baladhuri, Ahmad ibn Jabir.

Vakri in Sanskrit means twisted or crooked; it also means indirect, evasive and ambiguous. A Vakri graha is also known as the Saktha graha. Vakragati confers exceptional i.e. Cheshtabala, to Vakra grahas whose strong influence is expressed by the manner they affect the Natal Chart and by their transits. The two Lunar Nodes have perpetual retrograde motion. Vakragati Vakragati means retrograde motion. As the Earth passes by a planet that particular planet appears to move backwards i.e. westward, amid the stars, this phenomenon is called retrograde motion, which motion invariably occurs at a time when that planet is visible for a relatively longer period. the approximate midpoint of which period in respect of the superior planets coincides with opposition and the Earth is between the Sun and that planet. However, retrograde motion of a planet is merely an illusion, the planet only appears to retrograde, actually it does not and in which event if the faster planet is retrograde it can approach the slower planet from a later degree by backward motion which phenomenon is known as - \\"the applying aspect\\" in the Western astrology and the \\"Tajika System\\". The Sun and the Moon, the two luminaries, do not have Vakra state, they do not acquire retrograde motion, the other five planets (Tara grahas) have Vakra state, they acquire retrograde motion from time to time when they transit from 5th to the 8th house from the Sun. Rahu and Ketu, which are not planets in true sense, have perpetual retrograde motion. Suryasiddhanta refers to eight varieties of motion of which Vakra, Ativakra and Kutila refer to Vakragati i.e. retrograde motion, when they are believed to be moving away from light, and the remaining five verities viz; manda, manda tara, sama, sighra and atisighra refer to Rujugati i.e. direct motion, when planets are freed from vakragati and are known as Margi grahas that are believed to be moving towards light. A planet hemmed between two Vakri grahas behaves as a Vakri graha, this applies to the Moon. Whereas Mars, Jupiter and Saturn appear to retrograde in the signs opposite to the one occupied by the Sun, Mercury and Venus appear to retrograde when they are farthest away from the Sun. Mercury and Venus can never be in the 5th to the 8th house from the Sun. According to Sanketa Nidhi of Ramadayalu when it is retrograde Mars gives the results of the 3rd house from the house of its occupation, Mercury gives the results of the 4th, Jupiter of the 5th, Venus of the 7th and Saturn of the 8th house. Vakri grahas and Paramuchcha grahas no doubt gain superior strength but do not produce identical results and even become over-powered in Grahayuddhas. If the Sun is Arohi a Vakri graha although very strong but because of the variations in its motion does not produce results uniformly. Situated in their debilitation sign if owning good houses Vakri grahas produce good results, if owning bad houses they give bad results. Phaladeepika holds the view that a retrograde planet in its sign of debilitation is equal to its occupation of exaltation sign, and that exalted retrograde planets act as though they are debilitated. And, excepting the retrograde ones, those planets which occupy unfriendly signs take away 1/3rd of their allotted term of life. Vakra also means Kuja (Mars). Vakri grahas having gained exceptional strength give thrice the term of life allotted to them. Vakri grahas and their implications Vakri grahas or retrograde planets do not always produce bad results, they impel reconsideration of functions associated with them. When planets are retrograde their power to do good or bad is enhanced, then benefic planets become more benevolent and malefic planets more malevolent. However, Phaladeepika makes no such distinction. Saravali holding the view that exalted planets when retrograde have no strength, tells us that whereas retrograde benefics confer kingship, retrograde malefics give misery and aimless wandering. Uttara Kalamrita agrees with the view that Vakragati is equal to exaltation, if a planet joins a Vakri graha its strength is reduced by half, if retrogression is in own sign of exaltation then the Vakri graha acts as though debilitated, if it is debilitated and also retrograde it acts as though it is exalted. A retrograde planet at the time of birth affects a person immensely by its qualities. If more than one planet is retrograde then the planet most advanced in a sign affects the most. An exalted planet when retrograde certainly loses its power to help but a debilitated planet which is retrograde becomes more helpful in many possible ways; in fact the debilitated and retrograde planet situated in its exaltation navamsa becomes very helpful. Natural benefics i.e. Mercury, Venus and Jupiter, if owning the 4th, the 7th or the 10th house and retrograde become more adverse and spoil the house they own, occupy and aspect. On the other hand natural malefics such as the Mars and Saturn, become more helpful. Retrograde Jupiter gives results of the bhava it occupied at birth, rest give the results of the bhava in which they began retrograding. Immediately prior to assuming retrograde motion and direct motion planets seem to be stationary. Thus, Saturn remains retrograde for 140 days and stationary 5 days before and after; Jupiter for 120 days, stationary for 3 or 4 days; Venus for 42 days and stationary for two days and Mercury remains retrograde for 24 days and stationary for one day before and after. Retrograde planets influence the primary structure of the human consciousness and its relationship with human life. Vakri grahas confer unexpected results. Thus, Saturn, the friendly and functionally benefic yogakaraka for Taurus Lagna situated in Taurus lagna as the lord of 10th when retrograde in transit it delayed the appointment in service of a native who was at that time experiencing the good effects of Jupiter dasa. Vakri grahas give the effect of the house previous to the one they are positioned in. For example, if Saturn is in Aquarius sign it will also give results of its occupation of Capricorn sign and therefore, it will then cast its 7th house-aspect on both the opposite signs, Leo and Cancer. Accordingly, during their vakra gati Saturn, Mars and Jupiter, all three, in addition to their respective three special aspects gain a fourth aspect. Mars retrogrades within the arc-distance of 164 - 196 degrees away from the Sun, Venus retrogrades within the arc-distance of 163 - 197 degrees away from the Sun, Mercury does so within the arc-distance of 144 - 216 degrees, Jupiter does so within the arc-distance of 130 - 230 degrees and Saturn, within the arc-distance of 115 - 245 degrees away from the Sun. Agastaya states that Vakragati (retrograde motion), in general, intensifies the effects of planets for good or evil, according to their functional attributes and overall disposition at the time of birth or query, and a malefic planet, exalted and retrograde, and otherwise invested with yogas, can confer both Raja yoga during its Dasha or in the Dasha of a planet which happens to occupy the nakshatra of the malefic concerned, and also throw him out of power or inflict very adverse effects.

The division began assigned to the 20th Army at the beginning of the war and was destroyed and rebuilt twice before the war ended. According to research in the Soviet archives published by Michael Avanzini and Craig Crofoot, the division was formed five times from 1930 to the late 1940s.Michael Avanzini and Craig Crofoot, 'Armies of the Bear,' Vol I, Part 3. Its first formation was established at Omsk in the Siberian Military District in 1930, and reformed a second time in September 1939 after serving as the cadre for the 109th Rifle Division and the 194th Rifle Division. Disbanded for unknown reasons in October 1939. Third Formation Established Omsk in Jul 1940. Assigned to the newly formed 20th Army formed in June 1941 in the Orel Military District, under the command of Colonel Alexander Akimov. Wiped out in October 1941 near Vyazma during the opening stages of the Battle of Moscow. Fourth Formation Rebuilt in February 1942 at Ordzhonikidze, Ukraine. Destroyed sometime prior to October 1942. Fifth Formation Formed on 15 October 1942 from the 122nd Rifle Brigade in the city of Livny, Orel Oblast. In January‚ÄìFebruary 1943 the division participated in the Voronezh-Kastornoye and Maloarkhangelsk Offensive operations. In early April 1943 the division took up defensive positions on the right flank of the 48th Army. On 20 July 1943 the division participated in the counteroffensive after the Battle of Kursk. The division participated in the Liberation of Novozybkov. By October 1943 the division was located southwest of Gomel. On 11 November 1943 the division participated in the Gomel-Rechitsa Offensive and by the end of the month was in defensive position 10 km south of Zhlobin. By the end of December 1943 the division had advanced to the right bank of the Berezina River south of Parichi and repelled enemy counterattacks. The division spent the next several months in defensive positions south of Parichi. On 23 June 1944 as part of Operation Bagration the division deployed to the western bank of the Berezina River and reached the approaches of Babruysk and later participated in the capture of the city. The division then advanced in the general direction of Warsaw. In September 1944 the division was in the 2nd echelon of the 48th Army protecting the army's right flank during its advance. The division entered battle between the 217th Rifle Division and 399th Rifle Division, 42nd Rifle Corps and captured a bridgehead over the Narew River. The bridgehead was gradually expanded through October 1944. From January 1945 until the end of the war, the division participated in the Mlawa-Elbing Offensive and ended the war on the Baltic Coast at Frisches Haff. Gained the honorifics 'Novozybkov Order of Lenin Red Banner Order of Suvorov'. Postwar, the 73rd Rifle Division was relocated to the Kuban Military District with the 29th Rifle Corps and was based at Novorossiysk.Feskov et al 2013, p. 516 It became the 39th Rifle Brigade and was redesignated the 73rd Mountain Rifle Division on 23 July 1949.Feskov et al 2013, p. 149 In 1954 it became a rifle division again.Feskov et al 2013, p. 518 On 10 June 1957 it became the 73rd Motor Rifle Division.Feskov et al 2013, p. 151 In June 1968 the division transferred to Komsomolsk-on-Amur and became part of the 15th Army.

He was a candidate for the Odododiodoo constituency of the Accra Metropolis District in the 2012 Ghanaian parliamentary election. Military career Okaikoi first came to public attention as a member of the Pre-Trial Investigative Team (PIT), the main investigative organ of the Jerry Rawlings-led Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) in 1979. This investigative organ allegedly carried out acts of torture against former military, government officials and business owners as part of the AFRC's \\"housecleaning\\" exercise. None of these allegations were investigated. Colonel Kofi Abaka Jackson, a witness who appeared before Ghana's National Reconciliation Commission in 2003, testified that when he appeared before the PIT \\"Captain Okaikoi mounted the table and used a needle to punch holes in his chest, but he did not bleed. Okaikoi then asked him why he was not bleeding and followed it up with more slaps. He then brought out a pistol, and used it to hammer his skull.\\" Colonel Jackson's allegations were neither substantiated nor proven Capt.Okaikoi was removed from his AFRC functions when he was accused, together with some of his colleagues, of taking undue advantage of the PIT to benefit financially from PIT suspects. Although the A.F.R.C's claims were dismissed by its own dreaded People's Court, the accused were convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment. On 12 November 1979 Okaikoi and his co-accused escaped from the Ussher Fort Prison in Accra, and managed to flee to the United Kingdom where they were granted political asylum. Capt. Okaikoi attended Achimota School, and is a graduate from the Military Academy and Training School, where he won the 'Academic Cane' of his graduating class, Intake XII. He also holds a B.A (Hons) Government from Essex University, U.K, 1984 and Diploma Law from London's City University, U.K. Early political campaign Because of Okaikoi's political background, some protested against his candidature on the NPP ticket, notable among them being Samuel Odoi-Sykes and Nyaho Nyaho-Tamakloe, two of the NPP's founding members. Nevertheless, he emerged victorious in the NPP primaries for Odododiodoo in April 2011; the two defeated NPP candidates Shiehk Ahmed Nii Annan Tackie and former Odododiodoo MP Reginald Nii Bi Ayibonte threw their support behind him and offered their resources to him to aid his campaign. In July 2011, as his campaign was still in its early days, Okaikoi was taken to court by a Ghanaian living in the United Kingdom over a GH¬¢15,000 property deal gone bad. Okaikoi had offered to sell his plot of land at Kwashiman to the complainant, but the complainant alleged that Okaikoi had taken his money and then sold the land to another person. At trial it came out that the deal had been cancelled by Capt. Okaikoi and the buyer's deposit refunded to him because he had failed to keep the agreed schedule of payments for the balance: the judge found for the accused. Capt. Okaikoi ran on a platform of the improvement of the quality of life for his consistuents. Among his campaign promises, he stated that he would work for the rebuilding and expansion of the Makola, Kantamanto and Salaga markets, the biggest markets in the country, and the reduction of taxes on people doing business in the markets. He noted that the constituency which included the only designated business district in the capital city, was home to the biggest financial institutions, including the Central Bank of Ghana and the country's highest Courts needed to be represented effectively in order to fully benefit from central administration. Election In preparation for Nomination Day, Okaikoi relinquished U.S. citizenship in August 2012. Okaikoi faced off against Edwin Nii Lante Vanderpuye of the ruling National Democratic Congress; in November 2012, Vanderpuye claimed that if he got less than 65% of the vote, he would concede the seat to Okaikoi. In the end, Vanderpuye won by a smaller landslide than expected, with 45,967 votes (63%) against 26,269 (36%) for Okaikoi and 745 (1%) for Emmanuel Odoi of the Convention People's Party.

It inhabits the arid areas of Angola, Namibia, and South Africa, and was first described in 1908 by Swedish zoologist Lars Gabriel Andersson, who named it after its finder, German geologist Dr. Paul Range.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Palmatogecko rangei, p. 217). Description Pachydactylus rangei grows to a length of about including a tail. The head is quite distinct from the slender body and both are flattened dorsally. The eyes are large, dark-coloured and protuberant and have vertical pupils. The web-footed gecko is very pale, nearly translucent. It has a salmon-colored undertone and some have light brown stripes or patterns. The coloring of their skin allows for very good camouflage among the sand of the Namib Desert. The skin is covered in fine, smooth scales and is translucent, and some of the internal organs can be seen through it. The legs are thin but the feet are broad, with fully webbed toes, enabling this gecko to burrow easily and to run on loose sand. The gecko developed the webbed feet as an adaptation to help them stay on top of the Namib Desert sand or bury underneath the sand. They have developed this adaptation due to being nocturnal and needing to spend the days in burrows which are self dug and then spend the night on top of the sand feeding. Their feet also have adhesive pads on the bottom to help them climb. The males have thicker tails than the females. The female's mass can reach around 10 grams and the male is about 6 grams. The head and dorsal surface are pinkish-brown with darker markings, particularly in two intermittent lateral lines, and the ventral surface is off-white. There is often a bluish band between the eyes. This species is rather similar in appearance to Ptenopus garrulus, another species of gecko found within its range. Distribution and habitat Pachydactylus rangei is endemic to the Namibia Desert where it is found near the coast and up to 130 kilometres (80 miles) inland at altitudes of up to 300 metres (1,000 feet). The Namibia Desert is located in the Southern part of Africa. The type locality is L√ºderitz in Namibia. Its habitat is among rocks and stunted vegetation and on the dry loose sand of sand dunes. The geckos prefer the sandy desert regions and are only found on the coastal part of Namibia and the Richtersveld in the extreme north of Namaqualand in the Cape. Food In the wild the geckos eat crickets, grasshoppers and small spiders. They also will eat beetles, and other small insects they can find among the sand. In captivity they will eat crickets and worms. It is suggested to feed them crickets in captivity to keep the geckos active. The gecko's large eyes allows it to see its prey while hunting at night. Adaptations The web- footed gecko has developed many adaptations for living in the harsh desert climate. It has webbed feet, which allow it to burrow in the sand or walk on top of the sand. It also has adhesive pads on the bottom of its feet which allow it to be an extremely good climber. \\"The adhesive pads on their toes have rows of plates called lamellae, which are covered with thousands of microscopic hook like projections called villosities. These villosities catch any minor surface irregularity in order to aid the gecko in climbing.\\"http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Pachydactylus_rangei/. Another adaptation that the web-foot gecko has developed is its eyes. The gecko has oversize eyes which help it to detect prey. \\"The geckos like most other geckos do not have eyelids, instead their eyes are covered with a transparent scale, called a spectacle. They clean their eyes by periodic licking.\\" Biology Pachydactylus rangei is nocturnal, spending the day in a burrow up to a metre (yard) deep. It emerges at night to feed on arthropods such as termites, ants, beetles, grasshoppers and spiders. Its main source of water is the drops of dew found on vegetation. It can also absorb moisture through its skin. They communicate using a wide range of vocalizations, including squeaks, clicks and even croaks. Each individual normally lives a solitary life. It may emit certain squeaks and grunts when disturbed or when trying to find a mate. Reproduction takes place in April and May. During copulation, the male grasps the female tightly while gripping her neck with his teeth and bends his tail round under hers. The female lays one or two oval, hard-shelled eggs and buries them in moist sand where they need to incubate at a temperature of about . The young geckos hatch out after about eight weeks and are already long. They start eating after about four days. Conservation status and threats The main threats to the geckos are human activities. People hunt them for food and destroy their habitats. The gecko is considered important for human economics because it is used in the pet trade. Some people keep these geckos in glass terrariums as pets even though they move very fast and do not like to be held. The geckos mouths are also too small to be able to bite humans. They can live up to five years in the wild. Some laws have been passed to help the geckos, but they are not on any protected species lists, they are considered to be a non vulnerable population.

Personal Moran was born in the Queensland town of Beaudesert on 27 February 1925, the sixth of eight children of Tom and Johanna Moran. He grew up on the family farm during the Great Depression, and had a busy and active young life which included farm duties, schooling and playing tennis and cricket. At age 14, he left school to work full-time on the farm to help support his family during the difficult economic times. While playing a representative cricket match in February 1945, he experienced serious physical symptoms - a sudden but lasting dizziness, loss of balance and inability to focus - that forced him to retire from the match. Within a couple of days, he was diagnosed with polio and spent the next two years in a polio ward at the Royal Brisbane Hospital. When he was finally discharged, he spent a year with an uncle in Brisbane, managing his own rehabilitation and transition to life in a wheelchair before returning to Beaudesert. He studied accounting by correspondence and worked in the field, and began a lifelong involvement in community work. Sport Moran took up table tennis and lawn bowls to keep active, playing against and alongside able-bodied players.

After being expanded in 2008, the nature park is now the largest in Germany, covering an area of 2,700 km2.Naturpark Teutoburger Wald/Eggegebirge The park comprise the southern Teutoburg Forest and Egge Hills. The Teutoburg Forest / Egge Hills Nature Park won the state competition for nature parks, \\"Naturpark.2009.NRW\\", with its concept \\"Natural Health\\" (Nat√ºrlich Gesund).  Geography  Preu√üischer Velmerstot, the highest point in the nature park The northern part of the nature park begins immediately southeast of Bielefeld and then runs over the southern Teutoburg Forest in a southeasterly direction via Oerlinghausen and Detmold to Horn-Bad Meinberg. The southern part of the area is contiguous to it and runs along the Egge Hills southwards via Bad Driburg and Willebadessen almost as far as Marsberg. In the east, the nature park reaches as far as the River Weser near H√∂xter; to the east it extends up to the city boundary of Paderborn. It is adjoined by the Northern Teutoburg Forest-Wiehen Hills Nature Park northwest of Bielefeld. In addition to the two Central Upland ranges that give the park its name, there are elements of the Weser Uplands, the Oberw√§lder Land and the Lippe Uplands in the park as well as parts of the karst landscape of the Paderborn Plateau and the Senne. The highest point of the park, at , is the K√∂terberg near H√∂xter. The second highest elevation is the Preu√üische Velmerstot at . the volcano of Sandebeck in Steinheim-Sandebeck is the northernmost volcano in Germany.http://www.naturpark- teutoburgerwald.de/documents/Flyer_Vulkan.pdf (accessed on 5 February 2008) The regional climate has average annual temperatures of 7 to 8 ¬∞C and average annual precipitation between 625 mm (Warburg) and 1,132 mm (Feldrom).http://www.naturpark-teutoburgerwald.de/der_naturpark- kurzundknapp.php (accessed on 5 February 2008) The region of the nature park is also called the Health Garden of Germany (Heilgarten Deutschland). The reason for this sobriquet is its unique plethora of natural spa resources, such as brine, bogs, cold and hot springs. There are spas like Bad Salzuflen, Bad Lippspringe, Bad Meinberg and Bad Driburg, as well as numerous climatic and Kneipp spas, on the edge of the Teutoburg Forest.  Name  The name of the nature park is written ‚Äì contrary to typographical conventions ‚Äì with spaces either side of the forward slash. This was agreed by the park authority on 6 December 2007.http://www.naturpark- teutoburgerwald.de/documents/ZukunftNaturparkklein.pdf The German language authority, Duden, gives freedom to firms and associations to do this. Strictly, the typographically or orthographically correct way of writing the name would be \\"Teutoburg Forest/Egge Hills Nature Park\\" (\\"Naturpark Teutoburger Wald/Eggegebirge\\").  Conservation  The natural monument of Rieseneiche near Borlinghausen Some 60% of the area of the nature park is forested. As a large, contiguous forest, the landscape unit fulfils an ecological balancing function. The Egge Hills and the Teutoburg Forest are thus important components of the state-wide wildlife corridor. A good 85% of the area is protected landscape, some 10% is nature reserve and around 14% is Special Areas of Conservation. In addition, there are about 1,000 designated natural monuments (e. g. trees, rock formations, biotopes). The mascot of the nature park is the wildcat, whose presence in the region is one of the oldest to have survived to the present day in the state of North Rhine- Westphalia.http://www.naturpark-teutoburgerwald.de/die_wildkatze.php (accessed on 5 February 2008)  Sights  Externsteine *Externsteine *Hermannsdenkmal *Blue zinc violets in the Bleikuhlen at Blankenrode *Eggeweg and Hermannsweg *Preu√üischer and Lippischer Velmerstot *K√∂terberg *Desenberg *Altenbeken Viaduct *F√ºrstenallee *Rheder Castle near Brakel *Berlebeck Eagle Observatory *Iburg near Bad Driburg *Sparrenberg Castle in Bielefeld *Dalheim Abbey *Hardehausen Abbey *Corvey Abbey *Detmold Open-air Museum  Literature  *Naturpark Teutoburger Wald / Eggegebirge (pub.): Ihr Guide to the nature park.

Fragrant flowers appear after fire or rain, and are blue or mauve, or rarely white. The small capsules are covered in rough hairs and are loculicidally dehiscent, releasing numerous small, black angled seeds about 2 mm long. The species is tolerant of extreme conditions such as drought, fire, and low temperatures. The old leaf bases are arranged so that rainwater is funnelled down and to the core, where it is absorbed by densely packed roots that run the entire length of the stem. Strap-shaped leaves occur in tufts along stems. The species is widespread throughout seasonally high rainfall regions, occurring in grasslands on rocky outcrops, and sheetrock with a covering of shallow soil. It may be found through KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, Limpopo, North West Province, Botswana and Swaziland. There are some 50 species in this genus, nine occurring in South Africa. The generic name is from the Greek 'xeros' = 'arid', and 'phytos' = 'plant' an allusion to its being drought-tolerant, while the specific name is Latin for 'vein network'. Plants collected by Burke & Zeyher in the Magaliesberg were described by Baker in 1875. Synonyms have included Barbacenia retinervis (Baker) Burtt Davy, Hypoxis vellosioides Harv. ex Baker, Vellozia clavata (Baker) Baker Vellozia retinervis (Baker) Baker and Xerophyta clavata Baker. Tips on starting this plant from seed First, get the following: plastic container with a lid (round type about 8‚Äù across with a lid, the type that cookies come in from the super market), soil (I did half cacti soil and half playbox sand), some rocks if you like, bottled water, and lastly your seeds. # Clean and sterilize everything. This means remove labels from the plastic container and wash with antibacterial soap, rinse set aside to dry. Bake as much soil as you think you‚Äôll need for the project. Bake at 350F for 45minutes. I usually add 1 1/2 cups of water and cover with foil. Don‚Äôt want the soil bone dry. Rocks, mine were collected from the yard, boil in water for 15 minutes. All the above is designed to kill anything living in the soil, water or attached to the plastic container or rocks. The goal is to create an enclosed greenhouse free from any living matter except the seeds. # Once all the above is done, close any windows in your workspace, wash and scrub your hands and set up all your materials. # Take your container and place your rocks in and then the soil. You don‚Äôt need much for these guys, about .5‚Äù or so. I suggest arranging the rocks in such a way that they create a crevice or crack arrangement for the seedlings to grow into. #Surface sew your seeds on top of the soil in between the cracks. The seeds are extremely small and hard to manage. I suggest putting a little sand in the bag that they came in to break up the static cling to aid in spreading them. Cover with a thin layer of coarse sand, about 1/16‚Äù or so. # Soil some of the bottled water and after cooling place into a sterilized spray bottle. Water in the seeds with continuous misting until you see the slightest of puddling on the surface of the soil. # Place seeds on a north facing window. The following day come back and evaluate the water level, you still want a little puddling on the surface. If there is none, mist again until you get the desired puddling and then cover. Leave the container sitting on the north facing window for several months. Resist the urge to open the container or water the soil. If you see condensation on the walls or roof of the container, then there is adequate moisture in the container. Good seeds can sprout in 45-60 days. Some can take as long as 6 months. Be patient, get a magnifying glass and really look. If your lucky you will see small seedlings with about four leaflets each, a little bigger than a coarse piece of sand. They are very easy to miss and overlook. Reported growth rates are at 5mm in the wild. I have experienced growth rates as much as .5‚Äù in a year. A rarely cultivated species that will reward the patient grower.

It includes the latest printing devices and a range of original, compatible and remanufactured supplies. It is usually held in Zhuhai, China each October. The event began in 2007 as a result of a joint venture between the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) and Recycling Times Media Corporation (RT Media). Centered in Zhuhai (Guangdong, China), widely recognized as being the print consumables capital of the world, the exhibition currently takes place in the Zhuhai International Convention & Exhibition Center. RemaxWorld Expo is the largest trade show for the print consumables and printer industry, 6being a key exhibition of the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China. In 2019, the show accommodated 476 exhibitors and 14,938 visitors from 104 countries.  History  Tony Lee, founder of RT Media  RemaxWorld Expo  RemaxWorld Expo is the flagship event founded by Tony Lee and Sabrina Lo, the directors of Recycling Times Media Corporation (commonly known as RT Media) which was established in 2006. After enlisting the services of industry veteran, David Gibbons from Australia, the company ran a small, three-day annual exhibition called RemaxAsia Expo which was held at the Zhuhai International Hotel in 2007. The event grew to more than 5,000 attendees in 2008 and 8,626 in 2010 after moving to the China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition Center at Jinwan Airport. left Three years after its formation, RT Media became independent from its UK-based partner and the event was renamed CIFEX. By 2011, the show became the largest print consumables trade show in the world, and the first annual exhibition to be held at the Airshow Center in Zhuhai, famous for hosting the biannual China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition, the largest airshow in mainland China. Once again, attendance records were broken with 9,893 visitors searching for printers and supplies. Since 2013, RT Media has held the annual expo at the Zhuhai International Convention & Exhibition Center with up to 15,000 attendees year on year. In 2015, RT Media acquired the USA based Recharger Magazine along with its World Expo which was run in Las Vegas for almost 30 years. Subsequently, the event changed its name again and combined the former Remax brand with the newly acquired World Expo brand. The exhibition was renamed RemaxWorld Expo to reflect its global audience. left In 2019, RemaxWorld Expo attracted 461 exhibitors and more than 15,243 visitors from 109 countries. Hundreds of small to medium size companies joined the expo alongside industry giants including Ninestar, Epson, Sinopec, Apex Microelectronics, Static Control, UniNet, Mito, Dinglong, SGT, Zhono, Jadi and Cartridge Web. With 30,000 square meters of exhibition space, the expo showcased diversiÔ¨Åed products including printers and consumables, copiers and consumables, Ô¨Ånished products and spare parts, imaging services and solutions and intelligent ofÔ¨Åce solutions. Buyers holding the Arabic editions of RT ImagingWorld at RT Imaging Expo 2018‚ÄîEMEA in Cairo, Egypt.  Recycling Times Media  Following the launch of its first event in 2007, Recycling Times Media commenced the publication of a monthly print consumables magazine in Chinese called Zai Sheng Shi Dai (ÂÜçÁîüÊó∂‰ª£). A monthly English edition, Recycling Times was launched in 2009 with a Spanish language edition in 2014. In 2018, a partnership with the Moscow-based information agency, Business Inform, resulted in a Russian language quarterly edition. In 2019 a quarterly Arabic edition was begun in partnership with Cairo-based Arab Print Media. In 2018, the name of the magazine was changed to RT ImagingWorld to better reflect the changing nature of the consumables and supplies industry and the inclusion of a wider range of specialty printing devices. A partnership in 2019 with the Buenos Aires-based Spanish magazine Guia del Reciclador (The Recycler‚Äôs Guide) brought the two brands together to better service the industry in Latin America. RT Imaging VIP Expo‚ÄîAmericas 2019 in Bogota, Colombia InTouch TV News broadcasts began in 2011 as the industry‚Äôs first news service to focus on the global printing consumables industry estimated to be US$80 billion. A series of two-day regional RT Imaging Expos were run in Barcelona (Spain) in 2015 and 2016, in Las Vegas (USA) in 2014 and 2015, in Cairo (Egypt) in 2017 and 2018, in Cancun (Mexico) in 2016, 2017 and 2018, and in Accra (Ghana) in 2019. Commencing in 2019, strategic partnerships were commenced with industry leaders in Latin America, Africa, Asia and Western Europe to hold intense, one-day expos for targeted buyers and suppliers. These were successfully trialled in Cairo (Egypt) Mexico City (Mexico), Bogota (Colombia) and Lahore (Pakistan). Nine events scheduled in 2020 for Manchester (UK), Paris (France), Amsterdam (the Netherlands), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Sao Paulo (Brazil), Lima (Peru), Lagos (Nigeria), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) and Tunis (Tunisia) were postponed to 2021, due to the COVID-19 coronavirus.  Comexposium Recycling Times Media  In December 2019, RemaxWorld Expo along with its related regional events and publications, was strategically acquired by Comexposium, one of the world‚Äôs leading event organizers, headquartered in Paris, France. Comexposium welcomes more than 3.5 million visitors and 48,000 exhibitors every year at more than 135 events in various sectors in more than 30 countries. The newly named company, Comexposium Recycling Times Exhibition Services, continues to encourage discussion and engagement among and between the third-party supplies (aftermarket) and the OEM imaging sectors.  Participating industries   Aftermarket printer cartridges  The third-party supplies industry includes printer cartridge remanufacturing which is the process of refilling a used printer cartridge with new toner and replacing worn out component parts. The modern term also implies the refurbishment of a used or empty cartridge, with damaged parts having been replaced. left Since 2010, due to the shortage, costs and logistical access to empty cartridges, the compatible new-build industry became prominent and commercially competitive with the remanufactured or refurbished product. Initially all compatible new-build cartridges were manufactured in China, with some other countries including Russia and India also manufacturing new-builds to a far lesser extent after 2019. The emergence of higher quality aftermarket cartridges has spurred a reaction from the OEMs in two regards: legal and technical. Legally speaking, the protection of intellectual property rights has become an utmost priority, with lawsuits being filed by the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for patent infringements in many countries. The development of more complex components, especially microchip, toner and OPC (drum) technologies have required the aftermarket to invest more in order to provide a consistent, quality and non- infringing alternative. The OEMs are constantly seeking to exceed the aftermarket to ensure consumers perceive the favorable, and more expensive products, are their own. There are also some risks associated with both remanufactured and compatible new-build products. Poor quality, in terms of construction as well as replaced components in both toner and ink cartridges may result in leaks, malfunctions, low page yield or poor-quality printed pages. Furthermore, many OEMs allege the aftermarket infringes their intellectual property rights. Various lawsuits, predominantly in the USA and Europe, illustrate the contentious battle between these two sectors. On May 30, 2017, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in favor of the aftermarket in a landmark decision over intellectual property rights. The Court held that after the sale of a patented item, the patent holder cannot sue for patent infringement relating to further use of that item, even when in violation of a contract with a customer or imported from outside the United States.  Original Printer Manufacturers  The first dot-matrix printers were invented in Japan. In 1968, Japanese manufacturer Epson released the EP-101, the world's first dot-matrix printer. Dot-matrix printers became very popular during the 1970s and 1980s and despite being replaced by laser printers (that use toner) and inkjet printers (that use ink) in the late 1980s, are still used in various industries including point-of-sale in many retail outlets and stores. For this reason, many visitors to RemaxWorld Expo come looking for suppliers of ribbons as well as printing devices.  Laser Printers  The laser printer, based on a modified xerographic copier, was invented at Xerox in 1969 by researcher Gary Starkweather. The first laser printer intended for a mass market was the HP LaserJet 8ppm, released in 1984, using a Canon engine controlled by HP software. Printer cartridges containing toners, OPC drums and chips continue to dominate the home, office and desktop market in terms of volume and value of sales.  Inkjet printers  Inkjet printing is a type of computer printing that recreates a digital image by propelling droplets of ink onto paper, plastic, or other substances. They are the most commonly used type of printer in terms of shipments but not in the consumption of printer cartridges. They vary in terms of quality, size, and price. Inkjet printing originated in the late 1950s but was not marketed and sold until the 1980s. The four OEMs that account for the lion‚Äôs share of inkjet printer sales are Canon, Hewlett-Packard (HP) Epson and Brother. HP led the way, releasing the first HP Deskjet inkjet printer, priced at $1000 in 1988.  Printer Cartridge Components  Component parts, such as inks, toners, wiper blades and tools, dominated the exhibits in the early years of the expo. The visitors were mainly remanufacturers looking for technical work around solutions, components and parts to use in the remanufacturing process. There were also many companies displaying their remanufactured, compatible supplies for sale to dealers, distributors, wholesalers and stationery stores. Since 2010, some companies in China started to make compatible new-built cartridges using injection molding technology to replicate the appearance and functions of the OEM products. Initially known as ‚Äúclone‚Äù cartridges because they were exact copies of the OEM original cartridges, the compatible new- built cartridge sector expanded in China became sought after by international and domestic visitors. These ‚Äúfinished-goods‚Äù could often be manufactured more cheaply than it would cost to collect and remanufacture or refurbish a used, empty OEM cartridge. right Patent litigation between OEMs and Aftermarket manufacturers has led to many aftermarket cartridge manufacturers to develop their own technologies and work around solutions to avoid costly lawsuits and loss of market share. In recent years, there has been a shift towards the exhibition of finished goods, whether remanufactured or new-built at RemaxWorld Expo. Many components and tools continue to be on show, including inks, toners, chips, Optical Photo Conductor (OPC) drums, magnetic rollers, and doctor blades; production and testing equipment; inkjet papers, copy papers, thermal transfer papers & other specialty papers; and printer & copier parts. Finished aftermarket goods are becoming more and more abundant at the show including ribbons, ink and toner cartridges. An additional development is the increasing volume of service providers in technology, information services, software, IT systems, training, media and document solutions related to the printer consumables industry who attend the show. right  3D printing  3D printing or additive manufacturing first became visible in the late 1980s, at which time they were called Rapid Prototyping (RP) technologies. The original commercial 3D system was introduced in 1987, and ever since, the market has been booming with 3D technologies, becoming one of the most lucrative printing industries. The 3D sector of the exhibition is one of the newest and fastest growing sections of the show. The iPrint Expo is an exhibition that was previously run by Recycling Times Media, Asia-Pacific 3D Printing Application Propelling Alliance, and CCPIT Zhuhai. It was, initially, a wholly dedicated event that showcased 3D printing applications and was one of the first 3D printing expos in China. It is now run concurrently with RemaxWorld Expo and incorporates many other emerging print technologies. The 3D sector of the exhibition focuses upon industrial 3D printers, desktop 3D printers; 3D printer accessories; 3D scanning & software including scanners, laser engraving machines, and motion capture systems; materials & technology such as photosensitive resins, plastic power materials and metallic powder materials; and 3D printing services. left  Other Printing Devices  While desktop and office printing that use inks and toners has slowed in the biggest markets of North America and Western Europe, it continues to grow in other places including Latin America, India, Central Europe, Russia, Africa and China. At the same time, there have been emerging print technologies develop in China and these printers form part of the iPrint Expo held in the same venue at the same time as RemaxWorld Expo each October. Newly emerging printer technologies on show include handheld, label, dot matrix, thermal, blueprint, braille, fingernail and digital printers.  Zhuhai   World flagpoint for print consumables  In 2010, the China Computer Industry Association (CCIA) awarded the city of Zhuhai as the ‚ÄúPrint Consumables Capital of the World‚Äù. Statistics reveal that 78.6% of ribbons in the world are manufactured in Zhuhai. Additionally, Zhuhai produces 68.4% of the aftermarket inkjet cartridges, and 40.1% of the aftermarket toner cartridges. Within 50 kilometers of the center of Zhuhai, there are 680 print consumable manufacturers, and related marketing enterprises, which export products valued at over $7 billion annually to more than 100 countries across the world and employ more than 50,000 employees, accounting for one third of the employees within the global print consumables industry. The main companies in the Zhuhai printing consumables industry include Ninestar Corporation and its subsidiaries Apex Microelectronics, G&G; and Pantum. Others include Top Print Technology, Mito (part of the Hubei Dinglong Group) and Print-Rite (known as the ‚Äúfather of remanufactured print consumables in China.‚Äù. The 55-kilometre (34 mile) Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge which came into operation in 2018 is helping to bolster Zhuhai‚Äôs status as a manufacturing hub through enhancing integration with Hong Kong, Macao and greater Guangdong.

Plot Robin wants Barney to ask her father, Robin Sr, for his blessing on their wedding. They are surprised to find that her formerly strict father has taken a turn for the cool, wearing Hawaiian shirts, offering hugs instead of a formal handshake, and keeping himself up-to-date on Facebook. Despite his brighter demeanor, Robin Sr. nonetheless turns down Barney's request to marry Robin. While Barney attempts to win over Robin Sr., Robin notes her father's repeated insistence to add him on her Facebook friends list and finally accepts the friend request. She is bitterly disappointed to learn that her father got remarried to his girlfriend Carol without telling her (despite proudly proclaiming it on his page). Because of the elder Scherbatsky's lack of involvement in her life, Robin declares that she will marry Barney without his permission and will not invite him to the wedding. Barney later helps the two reconcile and Robin Sr agrees to her request to share a dance with her at the reception. Meanwhile, Ted and Lily fight over whether to hire a band or a DJ for the wedding‚ÄîTed is determined to hire a DJ and blocks all of Lily's attempts to hire a band requested by Robin. With Marshall taking care of a constipated baby Marvin, Lily forces Ted to admit his unhappiness towards Robin and Barney being engaged by revealing a terrible secret of her own: sometimes she wishes she never became a mother. Although she loves Marvin and being his mother, she feels exhausted and unhappy that she was unable to fulfill her dreams as an artist. Ted finally admits hating the idea of Robin marrying Barney and feels extremely hurt, even though he's happy for both of them. Lily thinks that both she and Ted need to accept the pain in their lives and move on; Ted agrees to hire a wedding band. Future Ted recollects meeting his ex-girlfriend Cindy and her wife, Casey, a week before the wedding and he revealed how the band Robin picked cancelled at the last minute. Upon hearing the news, Cindy immediately suggests a replacement: her ex-roommate's band is available for the wedding since they were dropped from their gig. Future Ted goes on to tell his children that if Robin and Barney had let him hire a DJ, he would have never met their mother. Critical reception Donna Bowman of the A.V. Club gave the episode a B+. She says that \\"Marshall and Lily‚Äôs storylines tend to be off in their own separate world‚Äîdistractingly so\\" but then remarks that in this episode Ted and Lily's predicaments are united by the theme of \\"longing for the roads we did not take, no matter how rewarding the one we did take turns out to be\\".

While he finds her really attractive, their age difference means he has trouble connecting with her. When he is about to end things with her, Barney convinces him to give it a shot, which will allow Barney to live vicariously through Ted now that Barney is engaged to Robin. Ted is about to end it with her upon realizing she has a really strong fetish for old people (Her believing him to be a senior citizen despite him only being in his 30s), but finally gives in when he realizes she likes Star Wars. After they sleep together, however, Barney finds out that she is actually Carly, his half-sister, and is furious at this betrayal. Later, Barney attempts to marry Ted and Carly, and mentions that he finds the idea of a one-night stand \\"cheap, meaningless and disgusting\\". Both Ted and Barney then realise that Barney is done with his detox from one-night stands. Though happy with this freedom, Barney urges Ted and Carly not to sleep with each other again. While Barney struggles with his detox, Robin is going through her own struggles as well‚Äîshe has difficulty getting used to being engaged.

Born and dead in Bologna, he painted many religious panel paintings, and also frescoes in the churches of Santo Stefano and San Michele in Bosco, both at Bologna. Life Simone dei Crocifissi was born in Bologna. He was son of the shoemaker Filippo di Benvenuto. In the 17th century he was renamed \\"of the Crucifixes\\" (dei Crocifissi) for his \\"ability to paint great images of the Redeemer, for our sake nailed to the cross\\" (Malvasia). He trained with Franco Bolognese. He was active as a painter at Bologna from 1354 to 1399 in the wake of Vitale da Bologna's previous experience, which he engaged in a robustly more popular style of painting. Coronation of the Virgin The initial artistic phase of Simone Di Fillipo can be seen via the frescoes of the life of Christ that come from the church of Santa Maria di Mezzaratta (mid-1350s century), now preserved in the National Art Gallery of Bologna (Pinacoteca di Bologna), where the interest for Giotto's space and plastic solutions is interpreted with a sharp expressivity. The influence on Simone of Vitale's painting style can be caught in works such as the polyptych 474, also preserved at the Pinacoteca. On the other hand, works like the Piet√† by (1368), and the Crucifix of St. James (1370), on display in the same museum, highlight the influence of Jacopo Avanzi and his solemn style, even if re-interpreted stressing the devotional goal, as in the Madonna by Giovanni da Piacenza (1382). These are the characteristics that enabled Simone dei Crocifisso to reach a leading position in Bologna soon afterwards, gaining pre-eminence as the author of wooden altarpieces for local churches and for individual customers such as Nativity.

He was murdered in 1994. Tan was elected president and chairman of the Maritime Law Association of the Philippines, President Philippine Bar Association from 1987 to 1988 and national president of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines from 1990 to 1991. Tan was lead representative advocate in many key landmark cases including the abolition of boarding fees levied on air and sea travel passengers in 1989; an increase in death benefits to Filipino seamen in 1989 and successful in his bid to win a hike in the basic stipend of policemen in 1970. He questioned the authority of the 1971 Constitutional Convention to adopt the parliamentary form of government, actively represented the challenge of the legality of Marcos‚Äô Presidential Commitment Order (PCO) in 1983. Alongside Justice J.B.L. Reyes and others he assailed the legality of the Snap Elections called by Pres. Marcos in 1985, and panel member of the fact-finding committee appointed by the Philippine government in 1995 who investigated the Escalante Massacres. By 1990, Tan was elected national president of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP). Over subsequent years, and until his sudden death, Tan went on to be conferred with several awards in the field of Maritime law, Human Rights and Social Justice Advocacy. He remained a champion of legal advocacy and a social rights activist in the Philippine community, and was recognised by conferment of a royal title and appointments to various boards and committees of interest nationwide and internationally.  Childhood  Tan was born during the Japanese occupation in the town of Sapi-an, Capiz, to a Chinese immigrant, Tan Chun, and a local woman, Fidelina Alvarez. Tan was blinded in one eye as a child, after an accident.  Education  Tan graduated Law with top honors as valedictorian and was admitted to the Philippine Bar in 1968. Qualifications Valedictorian, LL.B. College of Law, Ateneo de Manila University, Philippines.  Career  Tan was the first president and the founder of the Fraternal Order of Utopia, a Law School Fraternity established in the Ateneo de Manila University Law School in 1964 and began his career in 1968 as a junior lawyer at Ross, Selph, Salcedo, Del Rosario, Bito and Misa in Metro Manila after his call to bar. In 1983 he received an Outstanding Young Persons of the World Meritorious Award in the field of Law in the Philippines (TOYP). By 1976, Tan set up practice in partnership specialising in intellectual property, admiralty and maritime practice with Ignacio S. Sapalo establishing Tan & Sapalo Law Offices. In 1977, the firm became Tan, Sapalo, Manzano & Velez Law Offices and is today known as Sapalo Velez Bundang and Bulilan. Tan was a member of the board of trustees in 1982, vice-president for legal from 1982 to 1983, executive vice- president from 1983 to 1986; president from 1986 to 1987 and chairman, 1987‚Äì1988 of the Maritime Law Association of the Philippines (MARLAW) Tan was appointed director in 1982, vice-president from 1986 to 1987 and president, 1987‚Äì1988 of the Philippine Bar Association (PBA) and was elected president of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines in 1989. During Tan's tenure in November 1990, Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) staff filed a complaint alleging favouritism and discrimination with Tan's employment practices which amounted to nothing. The adjudication of this matter set precedent in jurisprudence and was cited in 1999 In The Matter Of The Petition To Remove Atty. Jose A. Grapilon As President, Integrated Bar Of The Philippines in 1999. During Tan's career, he was a professor of law, College of Law, Ateneo de Manila University and appointed by the Philippine government as member of the Escalante Massacre Fact Finding Committee (EFPC) to investigate the civilians by the military (1984)., he was also member of the advisory board of International and Comparative Law Centre Of The South- western Legal Foundation (now The Center for American and International Law) of the University of Texas Dallas (1987‚Äì1991). .  Career highlights  Within the legal community in the Philippines and in many other legal quarters, Tan urged, fought and pushed for changes to the Philippine judicial system. Notably, Tan's election to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines set precedent in that it broke a stronghold trend of almost two decades at the commission where he was the first small-time lawyer in many years from the Capiz chapter to be President Elect but it was also an opportunity for him to speak out and act to implement changes many of which later came to form part of the framework of the Commission on Bar Investigation and Discipline. Through the CBID retired justices were able to investigate charges against erring lawyers and protect them from harassment independently. Tan successfully supported the transition to independence of the IBP asserting the role of IBP as an independent union of lawyers mandated by the Constitution and the law enabling the IBP to provide a complementary institution supporting the courts in checking and maintaining a balance to judicial abuses.  Publications  The Philippine Law On Agency, 1979 Edition. Primer On Industrial and Intellectual Property Laws of the Philippines, 1987 Edition Death On the night of November 14, 1994, Tan and his driver, Eduardo Constantino, were kidnapped by several men in Metro Manila near Tan's home in Alabang, Muntinlupa, Metro Manila. On November 18, 1994, after three days during which details of the kidnap were held from the public in hopes of aiding their return, Tan and his driver were found dead in Dasmari√±as, Cavite. Following the incident on November 22, 1994, the International Commission of Jurists made a demand for a thorough investigation and swift prosecution of the perpetrators, and there have been references since Tan's death to the 'sloppy' investigation of the kidnap and murders and since Tan's death there have been several lawsuits, appeals, counter suits and much judicial haranguing following few arrests after an order was given to Philippine police by the then President Fidel Ramos to deliver the perpetrators to the justice system.

Leitch was born in New Zealand and moved to Japan as a teenager. Early life Leitch was born in Burwood, Christchurch, New Zealand, to a European New Zealander father and a Fijian mother. He was raised in Christchurch where he attended St Bede's College. In 2004, at the age of 15, he went to Sapporo Yamanote High School in Sapporo, Japan, as part of St Bede's school exchange program. After finishing school he attended Tokai University and in 2008 captained the Japan U20 team at the Junior World Championship. He became a Japanese citizen in 2013 and officially inverted his name in Japanese from Michael Leitch to Leitch Michael. Professional career He made his test match debut for Japan in 2008 against the USA in Nagoya aged 20, receiving a yellow card in that game for a dangerous tackle. He quickly established himself as a regular member of the national side. His first try came against Kazakhstan in April 2009. He impressed in the 2011 Rugby World Cup and was praised as one of Japan's best forwards, winning 'man of the match' in the loss to Tonga, where he scored a try and made a try- saving tackle on Siale Piutau. After the World Cup he joined the Toshiba Brave Lupus in the Top League. In his first season he was named in the league's team of the season and given the award of \\"revelation of the season\\" at the end of the season awards. He followed this up by being named in the team of the season for a second season in 2012/2013. He moved back to New Zealand after being named in the Hamilton-based wider training squad for 2013, but was denied the chance to play after breaking an arm. In his first match back from injury, playing for Japan against Fiji in June, he broke a leg. He got a second chance with the Chiefs, signing a contract with the side for the 2015 Super Rugby season. He was appointed Japan captain by coach Eddie Jones in April 2014, becoming the second New Zealand-born player to lead the Brave Blossoms after Andrew McCormick in the 1990s. For the 2018 season, Leitch moved to the Sunwolves, the Japanese Super Rugby team. He is the current captain of the Japan national team and led them to \\"the biggest shock in Rugby World Cup history\\" as part of the team that defeated South Africa in 2015. Japan achieved a similar feat under Leitch's leadership in the 2019 World Cup as hosts, when they beat Ireland, ranked second in the world at that time, 19-12. Also in the 2019 World Cup Japan defeated Scotland to qualify for the knockout stages for the first time ever. There is a statue of Leitch in one of the communal parks in Tokyo. During the 2019 World Cup it has been a popular place for fans to have their photos taken.

CHT aims to improve upon the accuracy of predictions made by standard analytic methods (including backwards induction and iterated elimination of dominated strategies), which can deviate considerably from actual experimental outcomes.  The Level-k Framework  Level-k theory is a competing theory to Cognitive Hierarchy TheoryStahl, D. O. (1993). Evolution of Smartn Players. Games and Economic Behavior, 5(4), 604-617. but is similar to Cognitive Hierarchy Theory in the sense that player types are drawn from a hierarchy of levels of iterated rationalizability. The hierarchy begins with some very naive type. This completely non-strategic \\"level-zero\\" player will choose actions without regard to the actions of other players. Such a player is said to have zero-order beliefs. A one level higher sophisticated type believe the population consists of all naive types. This slightly more sophisticated (the level one) player believes that the other players will act non-strategically; his or her action will be the best response consistent with those first-order beliefs. The next level believes the population consists of the first level. This more sophisticated (level two) player acts on the belief that the other players are level one. This pattern continues for higher-level players, but each player has only a finite depth of reasoning, meaning that individual players have a limit to the depth to which they can reason strategically. Econometrically,Stahl II, D. O., & Wilson, P. W. (1994). Experimental evidence on players' models of other players. Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 25(3), 309-327. a Mixture Model is typically used to identify subpopulations. Level-k theory assumes that players in strategic games base their decisions on their predictions about the likely actions of other players. According to level-k, players in strategic games can be categorized by the \\"depth\\" of their strategic thought.Nagel, Rosemarie. \\"Unraveling in Guessing Games: An Experimental Study\\". The American Economic Review, Vol. 85, Issue 5. December 1995 It is thus heavily focused on bounded rationality. In its basic form, level-k theory implies that each player believes that he or she is the most sophisticated person in the game. Players at some level k will neglect the fact that other players could also be level-k, or even higher. This has been attributed to many factors, such as \\"maintenance costs\\" or simply overconfidence.Stahl, Dale and Wilson, Paul. \\"On Players' Models of Other Players: Theory and Experimental Evidence\\". Games and Economic Behavior. 10, 1995  The Cognitive Hierarchy Framework  Some theoristsCamerer, Colin F., Teck-Hua Ho and Juin-Kuan Chong. \\"A Cognitive Hierarchy Model of Games\\". The Quarterly Journal of Economics, August 2004 have noted that players do not necessarily fall under the archetypes above. Instead, a player can act under the assumption that some percentage of the population fits each archetype, and act accordingly to find the best response. For example, in the Keynesian Beauty Contest described below, a player might believe that half the players are level-zero, and half are level-one. This player would select a number about halfway between the guesses of the archetypal level-one and level-two players.  Example: The Keynesian beauty contest  In the Keynesian beauty contest, participants are asked to choose a number that will be as close as possible to some fraction of the average of all participants' guesses. Suppose there are many players, each attempting to guess ¬Ω of the average from the range 1-100. A level zero player will select a number non-strategically. That number might be selected at random, or may have special significance to the player (in which case it is indistinguishable from a random number by other players). A level one player will choose the number consistent with the belief that all other players are level zero. If all other players in the game are level zero, the average of those guesses would be about 50. Therefore, a level one player will choose 25. A level two player will choose the number consistent with the belief that all other players are level one. Since a level one player will choose 25, a level two player should choose 13. This process repeats for higher-level players.  Example: The centipede game  In the centipede game, two players take turns choosing either to expand a slowly increasing pot, or to end the game and keep a larger fraction of the pot. In this example, the players are Alice and Bob. Alice chooses first, and also has the highest reward if Bob chooses to expand the pot on the final round. If Alice is non-strategic (level zero), she will compare the payoffs at each possible endpoint of the game and note that her highest reward results from Bob expanding the pot on the final round. Alice will thus choose to expand the pot at every turn. If Alice is level one, she will correctly identify her optimal outcome. However, she will also note that this outcome is not feasible because Bob's optimal outcome results from him ending the game on his last turn, rather than expanding the pot. As a result, she will choose to end the game on her last round rather than expanding the pot. If Alice is level two, she will predict that Bob expects her to end the game on her last round, and will try to end the game just before she does. As a result, Alice will choose to end the game on her second to last round.  Comparison to standard theory and experimental evidence  Theories of behavior often assume that players think strategically, meaning that players will base their actions on the probable decisions of other players in a way that will serve their objectives. However, many games, both real and contrived, do not result in the equilibrium predicted by standard analytic methods. The standard solution to the Keynesian Beauty Contest is determined by iterated elimination of dominated strategies. Using the example above, a fully rational player will observe that the most the number could be is 50. This player will also predict that the other players know that as well and will behave accordingly, so the maximum feasible number becomes 25. But, again, other players should know that, too. This process repeats indefinitely, and concludes with all players selecting 0, the Nash equilibrium for this game. This solution is inconsistent with experimental evidence, which finds that most players choose numbers around either 25 or 13. These guesses are consistent with first- and second-order depth of reasoning, supporting CHT. A small proportion of players exhibit depths of reasoning greater than second order. The standard solution to the centipede game is determined by backward induction. According to this method, if Bob reaches his final decision, he will prefer to keep a larger share of a smaller pot to the smaller share of a larger pot, so he will end the game instead of expanding the pot. Alice knows that Bob will end the game on his last move, so she decides to end the game one step before then. However, Bob knows that Alice will end early, so he decides to end just before she does. This process repeats until Alice is confronted with her decision on the first round; knowing that Bob will end the game at the first opportunity, Alice ends the game on the first round, and they walk home with the smallest possible total payoff. Thus, standard analytic methods predict that all players will defect as soon as they have the opportunity, despite the higher payoffs that would accrue to more cooperative play. In actual experimental settings, however, cooperative behavior is observed, but only for a limited number of rounds. While the benefits to cooperation persist (and in fact grow), most games end prematurely, with the defection of a player who had previously been cooperative.  Comparison to alternative models  Many alternative models have been proposed to explain the discrepancies between standard theory and experimental results. For example, the temporary cooperation in the centipede game has been ascribed to altruism and either error or the anticipation of errors by players. In the case of altruism, a player opposed by an altruist will cooperate temporarily to increase the size of the payoff, with the intention of defecting later. In the case of error, a player does not appreciate the vulnerabilities created by cooperative play. If a player anticipates that the opponent is prone to making such errors, it will be in that player's interest to cooperate until just before the opponent recognizes the error. While these alternative explanations are descriptive and plausible, they are also non-predictive and non-falsifiable, which limits their usefulness as behavioral models. They are also speculative: given an observation that deviates from a prediction, economists are unable to distinguish between errors, social preferences, intentional strategies, or other causes. Cognitive Hierarchy Theory explains the observed pattern of opportunistic cooperation found in many games, without being susceptible to speculation about players' traits, such as intelligence or motivations. In the centipede game, the eventual defection of most players signifies that most players are strategic and non-altruistic. This suggests that players cooperate on a temporary basis because they are seeking their own self-interest, and only cooperate as long as they expect it to serve them, suggesting that CHT describes human behavior better than these alternatives. Furthermore, because researchers are able to preserve the common assumption that players are self- interested, CHT can be incorporated into existing models rather than replacing them outright. CHT can offer reasonably accurate predictions about human behavior while acknowledging stronger forms of bounded rationality and opportunism than standard theory. Unlike methods such as backwards induction, it does not assume that players possess an unrealistically developed ability to process information, especially under conditions of uncertainty, dependence on other players, and time constraints. Furthermore, by incorporating stronger assumptions of opportunism, it is able to explain why a player will cooperate and then defect, instead of consistent cooperation or defection.

Production of the film began in 2011, with the principal photography taking place in Cape Town, Goa and Mumbai on a budget of . Premiered on 26 April 2013, Aashiqui 2 became a commercial success at the box-office despite featuring newcomers, and was one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of 2013, earning worldwide within the first four weeks. Aashiqui 2 is the highest-grossing film ever produced by Vishesh Films. The soundtrack to the film became very popular after its release; the songs \\"Tum Hi Ho\\" and \\"Sunn Raha Hai\\" topped the charts across various platforms in India, as did the songs \\"Chahun Main Ya Naa\\" and \\"Milne Hai Mujhse Aayi\\". Both the 1954 and 1976 versions of A Star Is Born have been cites as sources of the film. It was later remade in Telugu as Nee Jathaga Nenundali.  Plot  The film opens by showing a large crowd waiting for Rahul Jaykara successful singer and musician whose career is waning because of his alcohol addictionto perform at a stage show in Goa. After nearly completing a song, he is unexpectedly interrupted by an artist, Aryan, who was losing his career due to Rahul's, during his performance. Rahul fights him, stops his performance, and drives to a local bar. He meets Aarohi Keshav Shirke, a bar singer who idolises Rahul. After noticing Aarohi looking at a photograph of Lata Mangeshkar in the bar, he assumes that she wants to become a singer. Impressed by her simplicity and voice, Rahul promises to transform her into a singing sensation and asks her to never perform again in bars. Due to his assurance, Aarohi leaves her job and returns to Mumbai with Rahul, who convinces record producer Saigal to meet her. When Aarohi calls Rahul, he is attacked and injured by some thugs, and is unable to receive her call. His friend and manager Vivek decides that news of the assault on Rahul should not be leaked to the media, and instead publicises a false story that Rahul has left the country to participate in stage shows. When Aarohi attempts to contact Rahul again, Vivek ignores the calls. After two months of futilely attempting to contact Rahul, a broken Aarohi is forced to sing in bars again because of her family problems. Meanwhile, Rahul recovers from his injuries and again starts the search for Aarohi. He learns that Aarohi is working in a bar again and that Vivek had ignored her calls without informing him. Rahul apologises to Aarohi and fires Vivek, and they meet with Saigal for the recording agreement. Rahul begins to train Aarohi, who signs a music contract to sing in films and becomes a successful playback singer. Her family and Rahul are happy, but when people begin to gossip that Rahul is using her as a servant, he relapses into alcohol addiction. Aarohi, who loves Rahul more than her career, comforts him and they end up making love. Despite Aarohi's mother's disapproval, Aarohi moves in with Rahul and things go well until Rahul's addiction worsens, causing him to become aggressive and violent. To help Rahul fight his alcoholism, Aarohi attempts to rehabilitate Rahul, sacrificing her singing career in doing so. After Saigal reminds them about their dream of Aarohi becoming a successful singer, Rahul orders her to focus on her work. During Aarohi's stage show, Rahul meets a journalist backstage, who accuses him of using Aarohi for pleasure and money. Furious, Rahul beats up the journalist and starts drinking. He ends up in jail, and Aarohi comes to bail him out. Rahul overhears Aarohi telling Saigal that she is going to leave her career for him and is ready to give up her celebrity status because Rahul is more important to her. Rahul understands that he has become a burden in her life, and that leaving her is his only option to save her. The next day, he bids her farewell by assuring her that he will change his lifestyle and commits suicide by jumping from a bridge. Distraught by Rahul's death, Aarohi decides to leave her career but Vivek persuades her to stay. He reminds her that Rahul wanted her to become a successful singer and killed himself as he did not want to be a burden on her and remain an obstacle in the path of her success. Aarohi agrees, and returns to singing. Later, she signs her name as \\"Aarohi Rahul Jaykar\\" in a fan's handbook as a tribute to Rahul and her unfulfilled desire to marry him. As rain starts falling, she watches the couple who took her autograph sharing a romantic moment under a jacket as she and Rahul had done.

Production   Development  In September 2011, the Indian media reported that Mahesh Bhatt and Bhushan Kumar were keen to remake the 1990 musical blockbuster Aashiqui. Kumar approached Bhatt for a possible sequel, although it was Shagufta Rafique's melodramatic romantic script which persuaded him that the film had potential as a sequel and decided to proceed with the project. Given Aashiqui 's status in Hindi cinematic history as one of the finest Indian musicals of all time, many expressed concerns towards the decision to remake the film, dubious that the producers could come up with a soundtrack on par with the quality of the 1990 film. Bhatt stated that they completely resisted the temptation to use the soundtrack of the earlier film, and promised that Aashiqui 2 would revive the era of melodious film music, as Aashiqui had done 22 years ago. It was reported that Madhur Bhandarkar had been approached to direct the film, but later turned down the offer because of other working commitments. It was confirmed in November 2011 that Vishal Mahadkar, director of Blood Money, was to direct the picture, but the following month it was announced that Mohit Suri had replaced Mahadkar as director at the last minute. Bhatt confirmed the development, saying \\"Earlier we had finalised Vishal for the project. But now we have scrapped that idea and found a fresh one. We got Mohit to direct the film\\". Several media outlets falsely reported that the film was a remake of the Vishesh films 1990 love triangle Awaargi. However, Mahesh Bhatt denied the rumours and said \\"Aashiqui 2 is not a remake of any of our films. It's an original script. A very contemporary love story dealing with mature emotions.\\"  Casting  Aditya Roy Kapur and Shraddha Kapoor (from left). The film's producers launched a nationwide talent hunt to discover new faces for the film, initially refusing to employ established actors. However, the actors who came to audition were not promising enough for the roles, and the idea was scrapped. Mahesh Bhatt said, \\"It was a disastrous talent hunt. We discovered that people lacked the courage to audition. Those who are amateurs went for audition ...and people with certain talent were like why should we risk public rejection.\\" When Suri saw some pictures of Aditya Roy Kapur and met him, he found Kapur perfect for the role and cast him to play the male lead. In June 2012, Shraddha Kapoor was signed to play the female lead. Bhatt said, \\"Yes, Shraddha Kapoor is playing the lead with the two boys Aditya Roy Kapur and Shaad Randhawa. We found her to be very talented. All three actors have extremely challenging dramatic roles.\\" When asked about replacing new actors with known ones, Suri said \\"People said I couldn't make a film with new actors and expect an audience to come in. But I was pretty sure I wanted Aditya and Shraddha to play my protagonists. My writer Shagufta Rafique and I saw them as the protagonists. See, Aditya and Shraddha may have had unsuccessful films before. But that never took away from their talent.\\"  Filming  Principal photography for the film began in late 2012 with film's lead cast. The film was shot in Goa, Mumbai and Cape Town. During the filming in South Africa, Shraddha Kapoor needed medical attention after kneeling on broken glass fragments during the scene in which she had to kneel on the floor and talk to her co-star Aditya Roy Kapoor. Aditya Roy Kapur also received burns to his hand during the filming of the scene in which they light some Chinese lanterns in Cape Town.  Soundtrack   Marketing and release  The first look was released on 22 March 2013, and was well received by critics and audiences. Unlike other films whose theatrical trailers are released first, the makers of the film chose to release the songs before the trailer. The first song, \\"Tum Hi Ho\\", was released on 16 March 2013 to unanimous critical reception from critics and became very popular among the audiences. The song became an instant hit with approximately 2 million views on YouTube within 10 days of release, which helped in the marketing of the film. It has been trending on Twitter and YouTube since its launch. The film's preview poster showing Aditya and Shraddha under a jacket in a rain-drenched street with the streetlight casting a glow was released along with music on 3 April 2013. At the music release event, Aditya and Shraddha recreated the scene from Aashiqui from under a jacket (much like the poster) on the stage. The theatrical trailer was released in mid-April 2013, two weeks before the film's release, and was well received by critics and audiences. Unlike most Bollywood films which indulge in months of promotion before the release, Aashiqui 2 had less than three weeks for promotion before its release. A music concert where singers (who sang songs in the soundtrack album) performed to their respective songs was organised to promote the film. The makers of the film launched the Aashiqui 2 jackets, as seen in the film's poster. Statues resembling the signature image of the couple hiding under the jacket were placed inside various theatres. Due to the romantic theme of the film, it was originally planned for a Valentine's day release on 14 February 2013, but this was postponed because of production delays. The film was released on 26 April 2013 in over 2800 screens across India. The film was not released in key markets such as UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  Critical reception  Critics praised the performances, chemistry between the lead pair, and the music. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated the film 4 out of 5 stars, stating that it \\"brings romance back on the Hindi screenintense, pure, selfless and heart wrenching. A stirring account with brilliant moments, bravura performances, strong emotional quotient and addictive music, this one's an absolute must watch for the romantics.\\" He praised the lead cast's performances, writing that \\" ...Aditya Roy Kapur's depiction of the intense character is outstanding... [which] clearly demonstrates his potency as an artist of caliber and competence. Shraddha also gets to sink her challenging character and the attractive youngster is simply amazing, more so towards the demanding moments in the second hour. Furthermore, the chemistry between Aditya and Shraddha is incredible.\\" Indiatimes gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5 and said, \\"Suri pitches the story with old-world romance, high-drama and well-crafted heart- breaking moments.\\" Indo-Asian News Service rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, \\"Director Mohit Suri traverses the angst-soaked territory with a sincere and deep understanding of the dynamics that destroy love and trust between couples in the glamorous and competitive profession\\", and that, \\"Aashiqui 2 makes us grateful for the movement of the love story away from the standard Romeo & Juliet format into the dark destructive domain of A Star Is Born.\\" The film also received some mixed reactions from critics. Writing for Hindustan Times, Anupama Chopra rated the film 2.5 out of 5 and believed that the film didn't fulfill its potential, but said, \\"It's an interesting scenario and Suri and his actors set it up well. Aditya gives Rahul's angst a certain charm. He is earnest and broken. And the real triumph here is Shraddha, whose porcelain face has a haunting vulnerability. She's very good as the woman in the throes of a grand passion who believes that love will show the way.\\"  Box office  On its opening day, Aashiqui 2 collected about and collected during its first weekend.

Etymology and origins  The asana is dedicated to the sage BharadvƒÅja who was one of the Seven Great Sages or Rishi.Inhabitants of the Worlds Mahanirvana Tantra, translated by Arthur Avalon, (Sir John Woodroffe), 1913, Introduction and Preface He was the father of Drona, a master of military arts and the royal guru to Kauravas, Pandavas and the Devastras, the princes who fought the great war of the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata. A different asana is illustrated under the name Bharadvajasana in the 19th century Sritattvanidhi; it somewhat resembles Mayurasana with the legs in Padmasana, but as drawn it would be impossible to perform. The pose currently known by the name Bharadvajasana is a modern one, first seen in the 20th century. It is described in the works of two of Krishnamacharya's pupils, B. K. S. Iyengar's 1966 Light on Yoga and Pattabhi Jois's Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga.  Description  BharadvƒÅjƒÅsana II BharadvƒÅjƒÅsana is a seated spinal twist. It has three main forms: *BharadvƒÅjƒÅsana I is the basic form in which the legs articulated as in Vƒ´rƒÅsana dropped to one side one foot on the floor and the other's ankle cradled in the arch of the foot below. * BharadvƒÅjƒÅsana II is the advanced form requiring high hip mobility in which one leg articulated as in Padmasana (lotus position), while the other leg is articulated as in Vƒ´rƒÅsana (hero pose). *BharadvƒÅjƒÅsana on chair is a variant performed sitting sideways on an armless chair. This does not require hip mobility; the arms grasp the back of the chair to assist with the twist.

All instruction is given completely in the Japanese language using the same text books as those used by children in Japan. At the lower elementary level mainly the Japanese language and math are taught. Social studies is added from 4th grade, and science is added from the 7th. At the high school level, Math, English, History, Modern Japanese as well as Classic Japanese are offered. School events that are unique to schools in Japan are emphasized, such as Sports Festival, Ceremonies of the first day and the last day of school, and the Graduation ceremonies.

This discovery remained unrecorded until 1787, when a paper describing the case was read on his behalf before the Medical Society of London. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1770, when he was described as a Professor of Anatomy at Surgeon's Hall; and many years Lecturer in that Science and the Operations of Surgery. He was created MD by Frederick Cornwallis, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1782. Later disbarred as a surgeon, he was admitted a Licentiate of the College of Physicians in 1787.

It was one of the many dozens of fortifications within the medieval Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. The fort of Sinap is located approximately six kilometers northeast of Lampron on the gentle slope of a partially forested agricultural valley. The name Sinap means \\"corner\\" in old Turkish. Building This three- story high structure has a simple rectangular plan with solid cylindrical towers an each corner. It was built between the 12th and 14th centuries with the typical rusticated ashlar masonry of the Armenians. The lower floor, which is covered by a partially collapsed pointed vault, has no openings except for one door in the west wall. A now missing staircase once led to the second level which also has a partially preserved vault. Its walls are opened by nine beautifully designed casemates with embrasured loopholes, two windows, and an apse (?) in the east wall.

It is thought to be the oldest surviving European construction in the city area. The pool was hewn from a sandstone/conglomerate rock shelf at the base of cliffs near Shepherds Hill. Lieutenant-Colonel James Thomas Morisset, the Commandant of Newcastle (1818‚Äì23), ordered the construction of the pool by convict labour in about 1820 for his own use. The word \\"Bogie\\" or \\"Bogey\\" purportedly comes from the Dharawal language meaning \\"to bathe\\" or \\"a place to bathe\\" It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 21 November 2003.  History  The Bogey Hole is located beneath a pseudo headland or prominence and gets battered in heavy seas. Local dare-devils often tempt fate by climbing the cliff and jumping into the Bogey Hole. It is only about 1.5 m. deep. Another local thrill is to grab the barrier chains on the seaward side of the baths in a moderate swell and hang on tight when a wave breaks over you. Audrey Reay remembers that \\"The Bogey Hole was the best place for a dip, but dangerous in bad weather. When the tide was very high and weather rough it was a most delightful place if you could get safely in and out - to a moderate or indifferent swimmer it was hard to get out without a few scratches.\\".Memories of the Hunter and Newcastle in the 1880s by Audley Reay, p. 8 The Bogey Hole was constructed by order of Commandant Morisset in about 1820 for personal use. Whether this work represented the enlargement of a naturally occurring rock pool used by Aboriginal people is unknown. There is no exact date for the commencement of construction nor is there a record of how long it took. Morisset was Commandant of Newcastle from December 1818 until November 1823. He was the longest serving Commandant of Newcastle. It was known, originally as the \\"Commandant's Baths\\". The name \\"Bogey Hole\\" was applied afterwards and is said to come from the Dharawal word meaning \\"to bathe\\". The Bogey Hole is situated at the foot of Shepherds Hill, or as it was known in the 1820s \\"sheep pasturage hill\\". Geologically, the rock in the area is sandstone/conglomerate typical of the coastal areas of the Hawkesbury Sandstone deposit on which Newcastle was built. The rock is considered reasonably hard. In 1863, control of the bath passed to Newcastle Borough Council for public use. The bath were enlarged by Council and catered mainly for male swimmers, with women being permitted only at set times. Since that time a collection of changing sheds and other facilities have come and gone. The Bogey hole was originally much smaller than it is now and was substantially enlarged in 1884 to its present size. The most significant changes to the original Bogey Hole rock pool were in 1884. The pool was enlarged to seven times its original size and deepened, an iron safety rail was constructed along the access track and two bridges, stairs and ledges cut into the rock face.EJE, 2016, 6 These works were undertaken by Newcastle City Council.Steinbeck, pers.comm., 17 December 2016 > \\"The time to see the pool in all its glory was in the morning, when the sun > stood high over the sea. Boys gathered there as if by magic, playing naked > the whole forenoon. The rocks were warm, and slippery with salt spray. By > that time the chill was burned out of the water; crowds of young urchins > ducked and ran screaming before the onslaught of each wave from the heart of > the Pacific. Great games were carried on among the breakers; certain daring > boys climbed out along the sea-wall, hanging there by the chain-rail, and > holding their breath as the crests of rollers passed over them in a smother > of foam.

Despite improvements, the rock pool was not considered safe or respectable enough bathing site for the good citizens of Newcastle. The \\"Newcastle Morning Herald\\" commented that the \\"Bogey Hole has become the aquatic hunting ground of the Newcastle larrikin\\".NMH, 9/12/1884, in EJE, 2016, 7 There have been minor modifications to the Bogey Hole Baths since. These affected mainly the area above the baths, including post-war construction of the caretaker's cottage, removal of the original timber change sheds, removal of a timber picket fence, and alterations to access steps and ordinance fencing.EJE, 2016, 7 A brick changing shed was built in 1953.EJE, 2016, 8 The Bogey Hole remains a popular spot, particularly for inner city dwellers who don't like getting sand in their shoes, and still becomes very crowded on warm summer days.https://www.ncc.gov.au/library/locals/ histweb/bogey.htm The Bogey Hole was temporarily closed in September 2003 after Council noticed a number of boulders had crashed 20m from the cliff into the swimming hole, which had damaged fencing and created instability in the cliff face above the Bogey Hole. In 2004 the Newcastle Morning Herald reported that the Bogey Hole \\"had reopened following completion of stabilisation work above the popular swimming spot\\". The baths are currently managed by the New South Wales government who undertook a project in 2012 to restore safe access through the provision of a new platform and stairs. The Bogey Hole was closed in 2003 over rock falls and again in 2014 after damage by heavy swells. It reopened in 2016 after a $490,000 rock-bolting project had been completed. Local Greek Orthodox Churches have used the Bogey Hole for a traditional Blessing of the Waters since the 1950s. On the first Sunday after the Greek Epiphany, members of church offer prayers \\"for the safety of all people working at the sea\\". The priest blesses the waters below, from the cliff face, before local young people jump in the water to try and collect a metallic cross that has been submerged in the Bogey Hole. File:Swimmers at the Bogey Hole, Newcastle, New South Wales.jpgSwimmer at the Bogey Hole, Newcastle, New South Wales. n.d. File:Bogey Hole, Newcastle, New South Wales.jpgBogey Hole, Newcastle, New South Wales  Description  The Bogey Hole is a public baths hewn out of rock on a wave cut platform below the cliffs at Shepherd Hill. The dimensions of the baths are length (maximum) 10 metres x width (maximum) 6.5 metres, with an average depth of 1.5 metres. It was reported to be in good physical condition as at 2003. It retains its 1884 form. Various weatherboard sheds and a brick toilet block were added over time, but all have since been demolished. The seaward side is fenced with stanchion and chain, date unknown. The Bogey Hole is currently incorporated into a public walk called \\"Bathers' Way\\", for which a Bathers' Way Masterplan has been prepared by Council and some interpretative signage installed. There is a proposal to commission and install some piece of commemorative public art in the cliff top picnic area overlooking the pool. Incidents The Welsh poet and lecturer at the University of Newcastle T. Harri Jones drowned in the pool while swimming in January 1965. On 2 January 1881, a young woman named Annie Leonard nearly drowned in the pool; \\"...she was wading in the water barefooted, and fell into an excavation known as Bogey Hole...\\" She was then rescued, with difficulty, by a local man named James Dimond. In 2003, a 41-year-old man drowned after being washed off the rocks. On 26 January 2010, 26-year-old Nathan Luke of Gateshead died at the Bogey Hole after he hit his head on a submerged rock.  Heritage listing  One of the two remaining constructed features from the days of the earliest European settlement in Newcastle, probably the earliest European-built work extant, it is a convict constructed baths hewn out of a rock face for Major James Morisset, a notable military figure from the early period of European settlement in Australia. The Bogey Hole is the first recorded European purpose-built ocean pool on the NSW coast. It forms a picturesque and interesting feature in the coastal landscape of King Edward Park and is of considerable social significance to the people of Newcastle. Bogey Hole was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 21 November 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Bogey Hole is one of the two remaining European-made structures from the days of the earliest European settlement in Newcastle, probably the earliest European-built structure extant, it is a rare item, being a convict constructed baths, dating from between 1819 and 1891. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Bogey Hole is associated with Commander James Morisset who ordered it dug for his private use, and with the earliest period of convict labour at the settlement. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Bogey Hole and its natural setting are distinctive and pleasing features of the King Edward Park foreshore and a popular subject for contemporary artists and photographers. The pool itself is an interesting example of early convict workmanship, as modified by subsequent enlargement. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Bogey Hole recalls the early period of military privilege and convict servitude. In the 1850s it was a venue of segregated bathing. (The Ladies' Bathing Place was at the south end of Newcastle Beach.) Swimming at the Bogey Hole features in Audley Reay's \\"Memories of the Hunter and Newcastle in the 1880s\\". Today, the Bogey Hole and its steep cliff-face form a noted local landmark. It is said to be of particular significance to \\"local daredevils\\" who \\"often tempt fate by climbing the cliff and jumping into the Bogey Hole.\\" The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Bogey Hole has the potential to demonstrate early convict excavation techniques as well as subsequent Council modifications. The social significance of the Bogey Hole to identifiable groups merits further investigation. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Bogey Hole is rare by virtue of its early date (1819). There are no known swimming venues in NSW constructed earlier. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Geologically, the rock in the area is sandstone/conglomerate typical of the coastal areas of the Hawkesbury Sandstone deposit on which Newcastle was built. The Bogey Hole is the first Australian representative of the tradition of associating particular bathing facilities as being for users of a special class.

Statuti dell'Arte della Seta, 1380 ca, Bologna, Archivio di Stato Jacopo di Paolo (1345 approx. - 1430 approx.) was an Italian painter and miniaturist active in Bologna in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Biography Jacopo di Paolo. L'Annunciazione, 1390-1400, tempera e oro su tavola ‚Äì Bologna, Collezioni Comunali d'Arte Jacopo di Paolo at the beginning of his career was active at Mezzaratta Church, where he frescoed two Stories of Moses. These pieces were probably based on ideas of Jacopo Avanzi and have a clear influence of the new-giottism and late Gothic of Giovanni da Modena. The strong sense of plasticity in the figures and the rationality of the space system, evident in some works exposed such as the St. John the Baptist, are the result of a different and new reflexion on Giotto's experience. Even though there is a generational gap between Simone and Jacopo and they both were capable of obtaining important recognition in Bologna, it was Jacopo that also received prestige within the public arena.Text published by the curators of Bologna Medieval Museum The activity of Jacopo was very versatile, as he was engaged at various levels within the fervent political and cultural life of the city. He worked in several prestigious decorative undertakings of the city, sometimes in collaboration with sculptors, such as in the ‚Äúyard‚Äù of San Petronio, launched in 1390. For this he provided the drawings for the sculptures of the base of the fa√ßade, the project for the windows, and the wooden altarpiece in the chapel of the Magi by Bartolomeo Bolognini.Text published by the curators of Bologna Medieval Museum.

The diocese, which comprise the civil province of La Union, was created on January 19, 1970 and canonically erected on April 11, 1970 with Saint William the Hermit as the titular saint. It is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Lingayen-Dagupan. Prior to the creation of the diocese, the church was formerly under the Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia.

The Cathedral's patron saint is William the Hermit (or William the Great) (died 10 February 1157), the founder of the Catholic congregation of Williamites, a branch of the Hermits of St. Augustine. The town feast is celebrated every February 10. History With the founding of San Fernando as a town in 1587, the mission of San Guillermo de Duladulang in 1590 was also decreed. In the barrio of San Vicente, Fr. Francisco Romero (OSA) and Fr. Santiago Olarte (OSA) initiated the building of a chapel (visita) in 1764. The friars moved the visita to Tanque and then to Kabaroan due to Mindanao‚Äôs moros and Visayan pintados raids. In 1768, Fr. Juan Sorolla (OSA), Fr. Simon Guillermo (OSA), and Fr. Pedro Fernando (OSA) relocated the Church to its present site in the City of San Fernando. Later in 1817, Fr. Simon Torrado (OSA) erected another church and a convent. St. William the Hermit Church was originally situated at Pindangan, now known as Barrio San Vicente. In 1759, Augustinian friar Padre Jose Torres convinced the two settlements to fuse into Pindangan (dry fish). He and the natives built a church under the patronage of Saint William the Hermit. In 1765, under its parish priest, Friar Fernando Rey, Pindangan was renamed San Fernando after the Catholic King of Spain. It was in May 1786, that the Ministerio de San Fernando was created. But due to the shortage of priests during the period of 1792 to 1831, San Fernando became a ‚ÄúVisita‚Äù of Bauang and San Juan, La Union. In 1831, Father Juan Sorolla, the parish priest of Bauang in 1829, was assigned in San Fernando. It was only in 1817 when Father Simon Torrado and Father Sorolla, its first parish priest, constructed the Church. The church was damaged by earthquakes in 1860 and 1892 (List of earthquakes in the Philippines). In 1873, Fr. Luis Perez (OSA) destroyed the abandoned walls due to the 1860 earthquake. Fr. Jose Rodriguez Cabezas (OSA) renovated the convent and the church after the 1892 earthquake damages and added the bell tower. Katipuneros under Col. Blas Villamor and his Katipuneros sequestered the Church in 1898. It was attacked by rebels in 1898 and the Japanese destroyed it on February 25, 1945. Rebuilt in 1873, it was again reconstructed from 1947 to 1949 under Bishop Santiago C. Sancho. (May 23, 1880 ‚Äì October 23, 1966). He was the Bishop of Nueva Segovia, Philippines and was appointed Archbishop of Nueva Segovia on June 29, 1951. The humble chapel, and later church, was ecclesiastically proclaimed a Cathedral in April 1970 during the canonical erection of the diocese of San Fernando and the appointment on February 6, 1970 of its first bishop, Reverend Victorino Cristobal Ligot (March 10, 1924 ‚Äì September 18, 1980).

Biography In 1989, Isaacs attended Musicians Institute in Hollywood, California, where he studied guitar. After, he co-owned the Mad Hatter's Espresso Bar in Los Angeles, where he performed and hosted a weekly open mike show that featured singer/songwriters, comedians and performance artists. In late 1990, he left the Mad Hatter's Espresso Bar to host the open mike at Highland Grounds Caf√© in Hollywood. While hosting at Highland Grounds, he was discovered by an MTV talent scout. He became an MTV VJ in September 1991, which required relocating from Los Angeles to New York City. While at MTV, he hosted daily segments and shows, including \\"The Top 20 Countdown\\", \\"MTV's Daily Most Wanted\\", and a daily live show \\"Hangin with MTV.\\" Isaacs left MTV in April 1993. After auditioning for the Broadway Touring Company of The Who's Tommy the rock opera's composer, Pete Townshend selected him to perform the lead role. Isaacs toured with the show from 1993 to January 1995, performing over 500 shows in 32 cities in the U.S., including a show for President Bill Clinton at the Kennedy Center, and receiving a 1995 Helen Hayes Awards Outstanding Lead Actor nomination for his performance at that Washington DC venue. Isaacs relocated in 1995 to Los Angeles to focus on music. In the fall of 1995, he formed the band Skycycle, which consisted of bassist Kelly Castro, guitarist Sven Shenar, and drummer Rob Brown. Named for the rocket-powered vehicle with which Evel Knievel famously attempted to jump the Snake River Canyon. On October 31, 1997 Skycycle was offered a recording contract by MCA records. The band released an EP, \\"Breathing Water\\" produced by Failure's Ken Andrews, and recorded the album \\"Ones and Zeros\\" but was dropped from the label just before the scheduled release. Their song \\"Terror Time\\" was featured in the animated movie Scooby Doo on Zombie Island. While in Skycycle, Isaacs acted as band art director and webmaster. Skycycle broke up in the Summer of 2000. Thirteen years after the scheduled release of Ones and Zeros the band's catalog transferred to Geffen Records, and was digitally released on iTunes and Spotify. Isaacs then worked as a web designer and Flash animator, producing film and television websites. While working as a designer, he often played solo material at various clubs in L.A. It was at one of these acoustic shows that a common friend of his and Dave Navarro's attended. She brought Isaacs' music to Navarro, Stephen Perkins and Chris Chaney's attention, the three having recently broken up with alternative rock pioneers Jane's Addiction. The foursome's early writing sessions took place in Stephen Perkins' garage and ultimately gave birth to a new band, The Panic Channel. The band signed to Capitol Records in 2005 and released their debut album One on August 15, 2006. After the band's 2007 tour in support of (ONe), Isaacs moved back to New York City. From 2007‚Äì2010, Isaacs acted as Creative Director at Deep Focus NYC, an interactive marketing and advertising agency specializing in social media. His 2009 campaign for HBO's Flight of the Conchords won two Webby Awards and creative directed the Mad Men viral microsite, Mad Men Yourself. Isaacs then moved back to Los Angeles to work at entertainment marketing agency BLT Communications where his projects included the digital advertising campaigns for Disney/Pixar's Brave and Disney's The Muppets. In June 2013, Isaacs launched the web series Sweet Ride USA, acting as host, executive producer and creative director. In the show, Isaacs hosts exploratory bicycle rides searching for desserts on routes designed to burn off all the calories consumed. The show was featured in an 8-page story in the March 2014 issue of Bicycling Magazine.

In current applications, the method is highly mechanised and uses pre-stressed concrete. History The first bridge to have been incrementally launched appears to have been the Waldshut‚ÄìKoblenz Rhine Bridge, a wrought iron lattice truss railway bridge, completed in 1859. The second incrementally launched bridge was the Rhine Bridge, a railway bridge that spanned the Upper Rhine between Kehl, Germany and Strasbourg, France, completed in 1861 and subsequently destroyed and rebuilt on several occasions. The first incrementally launched concrete bridge was the span box girder bridge over the Caron√≠ River, completed in 1964. The second incrementally launched concrete bridge was over the Inn River, Kufstein in Austria, completed in 1965. The structural engineers for both bridges were Professor Dr Fritz Leonhardt and his partner, Willi Baur. The usual method of building concrete bridges is the segmental method, one span at a time. Method The bridges are mostly of the box girder design and work with straight or constant curve shapes, with a constant radius. box girder sections of the bridge deck are fabricated at one end of the bridge in factory conditions. Each section is manufactured in around one week. The first section of the launch, the launching nose, is not made of concrete, but is a stiffened steel plate girder and is around 60% of the length of a bridge span, and reduces the cantilever moment. The sections of bridge deck slide over sliding bearings, which are concrete blocks covered with stainless steel and reinforced elastomeric pads.

The basement consists of Cretaceous island arc and back-arc basin sequences that formed above a subduction zone. The cover is of mainly Eocene to Miocene shallow water limestones, that have been uplifted due to the presence of a restraining bend along the major strike-slip faults that bound the southern edge of the Gon√¢ve Microplate to the north of the island. Cretaceous Rocks of this age occur as a series of inliers within the younger limestones. Rift basins Rifting during the Paleogene led to the formation of rift basins in which thick sequences of clastic rocks were deposited that are exposed at the eastern end of the island in the John Crow and Wagwater belts. Limestones During the Eocene, limestone deposition started across the whole of the Nicaraguan Rise. In Jamaica the main limestone unit is the White Limestone Group, which dominates the surface exposure of the island, particularly its central parts and consists of pure limestones and dolomites. Locally the lowermost limestone is the Yellow Limestone Group, which consists of interbedded limestones and other clastic rocks.

This caused the formation of a two new strike-slip fault zones between the island of Hispaniola and the Mid-Cayman Spreading Center west of Jamaica, the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone and the Walton fault zone. These fault zones now form part of the southern boundary of the Gon√¢ve Microplate. The major right-stepping offset between the fault zones formed a restraining bend and led to transpression and uplift that is still active today and is the reason that the island of Jamaica is now well above sea level.

In finance, the notion of traditional investments refers to putting money into well-known assets (such as bonds, cash, real estate, and equity shares) with the expectation of capital appreciation, dividends, and interest earnings. Traditional investments are to be contrasted with alternative investments. Bonds Here the investor purchases debt issued by companies or governments which promises to pay an annual return until the debt is repaid. The value of the investment changes as the level of general interest rates fluctuates, causing the bond to become more or less valuable. Cash In cash investing, money is typically invested in short-term, low-risk investment vehicles like certificates of deposit, money market funds, and high yield bank accounts. Real estate In real estate, money is used to purchase property for the purpose of holding, reselling or leasing for income and there is an element of capital risk. Residential real estate Investment in residential real estate is the most common form of real estate investment measured by number of participants because it includes property purchased as a primary residence. In many cases the buyer does not have the full purchase price for a property and must borrow additional money from a bank, finance company or private lender. Commercial real estate Commercial real estate consists of apartments, office buildings, retail space, hotels, warehouses, and other commercial properties. Investors may purchase commercial property outright, with the help of a loan, or collectively through a real estate fund. Real estate investment trusts Investment in real estate investment trusts (REITs) is like investing in a pool of real estate that the company manages.

The phases are edit time, compile time, link time, distribution time, installation time, load time, and run time. Lifecycle phases do not necessarily happen in a linear order, and they can be intertwined in various ways. For example, when modifying a program, software developers may need to repeatedly edit, compile, install, and execute it on their own computers to ensure sufficient quality before it can be distributed to users; copies of the modified program are then downloaded, installed, and executed by users on their computers. Phases Edit time is when the source code of the program is being edited. This spans initial creation to any bug fix, refactoring, or addition of new features. Editing is typically performed by a person, but automated design tools and metaprogramming systems may also be used. Compile time is when source code is translated into machine code by a compiler. Part of this involves language checking, such as ensuring proper use of the type system. The result of successful compilation is an executable. Link time connects all of the necessary machine code components of a program, including externals. It is very common for programs to use functions implemented by external libraries, all of which must be properly linked together. There are two types of linking. Static linking is when the connection is made by the compiler, which is always prior to execution. Dynamic linking, however, is performed by the operating system (OS) just before, or even during, execution. Distribution time is the process of transferring a copy of a program to a user. The distribution format is typically an executable, but may also be source code, especially for a program written in an interpreted language. The means of distribution can be physical media such as a USB flash drive or a remote download via the Internet. Installation time gets the distributed program ready for execution on the user's computer, which often includes storing the executable for future loading by the OS. Load time is when the OS takes the program's executable from storage, such as a hard drive, and places it into active memory, in order to begin execution. Run time is the execution phase, when the central processing unit executes the program's machine code instructions. Programs may run indefinitely. If execution terminates it will either be normal, expected behavior or an abnormality such as a crash.

It is one of the local associations that are part of the national body, the Australian College of Operating Room Nurses (ACORN).ACORN Membership Mission The NSW OTA mission is \\"leading perioperative nurses to achieve excellence in patient care\\". This mission led to the development of activities to advance perioperative nursing profession, which included: * Offering perioperative nurses professional educational and research opportunities * Creating awareness and sharing of perioperative nursing innovations, advancements, achievements, networking and best practices * Establishing the high quality standards of care for patients from perioperative nurses * Supporting research and promoting evidence-based perioperative nursing practice * Offering advice to government, industry and regulatory bodiesNSW Ministry of Health \\"Surgery News\\" Newsletter[www.archi.net.au/documents/resources/hsd/surgery/predictable_surgery/surgery- news-jan-feb-2012.pdf] * Empowering perioperative nurses to engage in perioperative nursing issues History Formation During 1956 three operating room supervisors ‚Äì Miss Spense (from Royal North Shore Hospital), Miss Sturtridge (from the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children), and Sister Mary Garbriel (from St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney) ‚Äì with the help of the Registered Nurse representative of Johnson & Johnson Pty. Ltd. realised the need for these supervisors to meet, share ideas, provide support for each other, and allow for progress in this field of nursing. Through their insight, the Theatre Supervisors' Group of NSW was inaugurated in July 1957, with Sister Mary Gabriel as the first President. Contact with metropolitan Sydney hospitals' room supervisors brought new members into the Theatre Supervisors' Group of NSW. The Theatre Supervisors' Group of NSW supplied answers to many problems that were discussed at the time, with Saturday lectures held at St. Vincent's Hospital. This followed with the meetings being held at different metropolitan hospitals, where networking among members from different hospitals and conducting tours of their operating rooms. Name change, membership and expansion It was decided that the Theatre Supervisors' Group of NSW was too restricted and so the name of the Group was altered to the New South Wales Operating Theatre Association in 1962. This allowed all registered nurses employed in operating suites to join and collaboratively work on issues. Membership gradually grew to encompass the Sydney, Newcastle, New South Wales & Wollongong metropolitan areas, the NSW country areas and the ACT. From the initial membership of three people in 1957, there was a rapid increase in membership due to the widening of the membership criteria and since that time, membership has increased: by 1985 to over 500 and in recent times to around 1200. Incorporation of the NSW OTA occurred in 1991.

The earliest communities were formed in Cape Town and surrounding areas in the late nineties and early 2000s. A number of Somali-South African residents have risen to prominence locally and internationally. Overview A Somali convenience store in Mayfair, Johannesburg. Following the civil war in Somalia that broke out in 1991, a number of Somalis emigrated to South Africa. They soon established themselves in the commercial sector, creating employment opportunities for themselves and opening their own stores. Somali businesses have offered goods to customers at lower prices than their local competitors, cornering the market in many areas. By 2010, Somali entrepreneurs provided most of the retail trade in informal settlements around the Western Cape province, among other places. Somali-owned convenience shops selling products like snacks, soft drinks and clothing have been especially successful. In 2008, xenophobic riots against immigrants broke out in the Western Cape province, displacing some 20,000 foreign nationals. The Somali community's insular nature reportedly helped protect it from the worst of the violence. However, many Somali-owned stores and supermarkets were destroyed and looted. Concurrently, Somali traders and establishments have become increasingly targeted for violence and robbery. The willingness of many Somali merchants to work anywhere, including run-down townships, has facilitated the attacks. Although South African business people envious of the Somalis' entrepreneurial success have been blamed for fomenting the hostilities, most of the incidents have been linked to criminals and \\"tsotsis\\" (gangsters) working on behalf of local community leaders. Culture Somalis in South Africa have formed a unified ethnic network, largely keeping to themselves. A Muslim population, they marry within their own community and seek to preserve their culture. Their customs, physical appearance and religious background distinguish them from other residents. Community organizations The Somali community in South Africa is represented by the Somali Association of South Africa (SASA), chaired by Hanad Mohamed. According to the organization, following a greatly ameliorated political situation in Somalia in 2012, some Somali immigrants have started again repatriating back to their native country for the first time in ten years. Somalis in South Africa are diplomatically represented by the embassy of Somalia in Pretoria. The office is intended to protect the interests and rights of Somali expatriates in the country, to tap into new commercial opportunities for Somali businesspeople, and to strengthen diplomatic representation in the region. Due to the conservative nature of the Somali community, tribalism is still very much prevalent, being the most common representative of the community. However, there seems to be a decline in tribal interest amongst first generation Somali South Africans‚Äî who consider themselves South Africans.

Cultural cognitive evolution proposes that humans‚Äô unique cognitive capacities are not solely due to biological inheritance, but are in fact due in large part to cultural transmission and evolution (Tomasello, 1999). Modern humans and great apes are separated evolutionarily by about six million years. Proponents of cultural evolution argue that this would not have been enough time for humans to develop the advanced cognitive capabilities required to create tools, language, and build societies through biological evolution. Biological evolution could not have individually produced each of these cognitive capabilities within that period of time. Instead, humans must have evolved the capacity to learn through cultural transmission (Tomasello, 1999). This provides a more plausible explanation that would fit within the given time frame. Instead of having to biologically account for each cognitive mechanism that distinguishes modern humans from previous relatives, one would only have to account for one significant biological adaptation for cultural learning. According to this view, the ability to learn through cultural transmission is what distinguishes humans from other primates (Tomasello, 1999). Cultural learning allows humans to build on existing knowledge and make collective advancements, also known as the ‚Äúratchet effect‚Äù. The ratchet effect simply refers to the way in which humans continuously add on to existing knowledge through modifications and improvements. This unique ability distinguishes humans from related primates, who do not seem to build collaborative knowledge over time. Instead, primates seem to build individual knowledge, in which the expertise of one animal is not built on by others, and does not progress across time. Cultural learning Human cultural learning involves: * Imitation- the ability to learn by observing others * Instruction- the ability to learn through direct instruction * Collaboration- the ability to learn in cooperation with other individuals Cultural learning is made possible by a deep understanding of social cognition. Humans have the unique capacity to identify and relate to others and view them as intentional beings. Humans are able to understand that others have intentions, goals, desires, and beliefs. It is this deep understanding, this cognitive adaptation, that allows humans to learn from and with others through cultural transmission (Tomasello, 1999). Social Cognition in Mammals and Primates Primates show distinct characteristics of social cognition in comparison to mammals. Mammals are able to identify members of their species, understand basic kinships and basic social hierarchies, make predictions about others‚Äô behavior based on emotion and movement, and engage in social learning (Tomasello, 1999). Primates, however, show a more extensive understanding of these concepts. Primates not only understand kinship and social hierarchies, but they also have an understanding of relational categories. That is, primates are able to understand social relations that extend beyond their individual interaction with others. Mammals are able to form direct relationships based on social hierarchies, but primates have an understanding of social hierarchies and relationships that extend beyond them personally. Researchers believe that this understanding of relational categories might have been the evolutionary precursor to humans‚Äô deeper understanding of desires, beliefs, and goals underlying causal relationships, and thereby allowing humans to relate to and understand other individuals, making way for cultural evolution (Tomasello, 1999). Although it is now believed that non-human primates such as chimpanzees have some limited understanding of others as intentional beings, it is clear that these understanding are not as deep as human understanding of others as intentional agents. Chimpanzees, for example, demonstrated an ability to think about what others see, and predict behavior based on these beliefs in several studies conducted by Tomasello and Hare (2003). For example, subordinate chimpanzees in one experiment avoided food that they knew the dominant chimpanzee could see, but sought food that the dominant chimpanzee could not see due to a physical barrier. In another experiment, subordinate chimpanzees made decisions about approaching food based on whether or not the dominant chimpanzee had seen the human researcher place the food behind the barrier. Chimpanzees were also found to react differently to humans who were unwilling versus unable to provide food (teasing the chimpanzee with food, or pretending to have an accident with it), thereby showing some ability to discriminate intentionality. Dogs have also shown some interesting but limited abilities at social cognition in a series of studies by Hare and Tomasello (2005). Dogs have the ability to read human social cues, even to a greater extent than chimpanzees. Dogs are able to respond to human pointing, the human gaze, and subtle human nods without training. Researchers now believe that these abilities are the result of convergent evolution between humans and dogs through domestication. Research with domesticated foxes has shown that the likely mechanism for this convergent evolution was the selection of tame behavior in dogs. This finding suggests that perhaps humans had to evolve a propensity to cooperate before cultural evolution was able to take place (Hare & Tomasello, 2005). Sociogenesis & Human Ontogeny Sociogenesis refers to collaborative inventiveness. It is the process by which two or more humans collectively interact and invent something new which could not have been developed by one individual alone, such as language and mathematics (Tomasello, 1999). Sociogenesis can occur across time, or simultaneously (Tomasello, 1999). Socigenesis across times occurs through the ratchet effect, when one individual modifies something they had previously learned through others. Over time, ideas, tools, and language advance. Simultaneous sociogenesis occurs when two or more individuals work together at the same time and develop something new. In response to the nature versus nurture and learned versus innate debate, proponents of cultural evolution argue that cognitive psychology must take into account historical processes when studying and discussion cognition (Tomasello, 1999). For example, the similarities between languages have led many researchers to decry that language or aspects of language must be innate. The extreme variability in math and counting systems across cultures has prevented similar conclusions for math. However, Tomasello argues that if you look at these concepts with historical processes in mind, another plausible explanation could be that language, but not math, developed before people split into different populations. Math developed only after such split, and because the cultural needs of these people differed, differential counting and mathematical systems resulted. The critique is that categorizing concepts as innate or learned does not tell us anything about the process by which they originally developed.  References  1 Hare, B., & Tomasello, M. (2005).

Ramos represented South Africa at Miss World 2013 and Miss Universe 2013, failing to place in both competitions. She entered the pageant twice before she emerged the winner. She also held the title for the longest in SA pageant history- 16 months until she has crowned Roline Strauss on 30 March 2014 as her successor. Early life Marilyn's home town is Klerksdorp. Marilyn is a student of Interior Architecture at Inscape Design College in Pretoria. She is the daughter of Victor and Yolandi Ramos. She is of South African and Portuguese descent.Marilyn Ramos: what‚Äôs in a Miss South Africa name? Miss South Africa 2012 In light of the fact that the outgoing Miss South Africa was in attendance at the Miss Universe pageant where she had placed in the top 10. Marilyn Ramos from Klerksdorp has been crowned Miss South Africa 2012 by Remona Moodley (The First Runner-up Miss South Africa 2011) at the Sun City Super Bowl on Sunday night, 9 December 2012. However, Melinda Bam did pay homage to her country and the title that she held in the form of a video montage that was aired on the night of the finale. Beyond 2012  In 2013 a now-defunct major media publication (Heat magazine) accused her of being ‚Äòthe worst Miss SA ever'. However, she responded to it, by indicating that: \\"There was no PR in place for Miss SA 2012. The events, charities and other initiatives I had done went unseen to the public. No one was sending out Press Releases of my doings, creating the warped perception that I wasn‚Äôt fulfilling my duties as Miss SA. A PR team was only put in place when the Miss SA 2014 search started, and clearly focused on the 2014 pageant. The events I attended were a combination of what the Miss SA Offices arranged and invitations I received in my own personal capacity. But despite all this I tirelessly focused all my energy on the various charities I was responsible for. Contrary to popular belief, as Miss South Africa I did not even have a clothing sponsor, but was always expected to look my best and that of a Miss South Africa. This dilemma reached a critical climax when it came to the Miss World (hosted in Bali) and Miss Universe (hosted in Moscow) pageants. With minimal support once again, it came down to my parents and family drives (to raise money) to pay for almost everything, including 90 outfits (gowns, national costumes etc), national gifts, contestant gifts and R23000 excess luggage, just to name a few. My family and I had only 4 weeks in between the two international competitions to prepare for Miss Universe, a time frame any industry expert will tell you is almost impossible to achieve. To make everything worse, no one from the Organization even made an effort to come see me off at OR Tambo. I did not let this hinder me. I still went ahead and represented my country to the best of my abilities. The fact that I didn‚Äôt place at either pageant wasn‚Äôt because of anything I did or didn‚Äôt do. I tried my utmost best, poured my heart and soul into it, and firmly believe that it just wasn‚Äôt my time. I think it is also fair to mention that I was not the only Miss South Africa, that did not place at Internationals; in fact, there were three other Miss South Africa‚Äôs that did not place in previous years. Perhaps the absence of a South African Director played a role while 99% of all contestants had someone from the national organization present for meetings, events and the final show.\\" She got married to Louwrens Mahoney,a six-time national champion in 2018. Mahoney has successfully represented KTM (motorcycling) South Africa in both the National Cross Country and Enduro Championship.

From 1895 to 1898 he obtained several podium finishes in long distance road races, the most emblematic of which is his 3rd place in the 1898 Bordeaux - Paris. In motor-paced racing he won five European titles (1901‚Äì1904, 1907) and the world championships in 1901 and 1902, he finished in third place in 1903.

Evolving from a recording project spearheaded by Violet, who was working as the house engineer for Dawnbreaker studio in San Fernando, CA (previously owned by Seals and Crofts), the band recorded what would be the first two Jesters songs during the project,which was instigated in order to come up with commercial jingles. The songs were \\"Diggin' That Grave\\" and \\"End of Time.\\" The band presented the songs to Metal Blade Records, who included \\"End of Time\\" on Metal Massacre V collection. It closed the LP, which include early tracks by Overkill, Fates Warning, Voi Vod and Metal Church. The band then signed to Metal Blade, but due to the band not being strictly heavy metal, the label created a subsidiary, Dimension Records, which released the band's debut album, Fun at the Funeral, in 1986, and an EP, In a Nostalgic Mood, in 1987, during their first tenure. Following \\",,,Mood,\\" Metal Blade dropped the band. They demo-ed a number of songs for a planned third LP to be titled, No Laughing Matter, but we're unable to land a new recording contract. They broke up in 1988. During their run, a number of lead guitarists and drummers were part of the band, including on drums, David Buzzelli (Doktor Stixx), Louie Schilling, Walin' Jennings Morgan, Dave Kuzma, Blaze; and on guitar, Sickie Wifebeater, Michael Montano and Brian Butler. in 2001, Ektro Records in Finland reissued Fun at the Funeral, supplemented with bonus tracks which combined live recordings with most of the demos for No Laughing Matter. Ektro owner and Circle bassist Jussi Lehtisalo asked Duff to guest on a Circle EP, Earthworm (2006), and later a full LP Hollywood (2009). In 2011, Duff joined Circle for an artist residency at the Roadburn festival in Tilburg, Netherlands, fronting the band and singing a combination of Circle and Jesters songs. Circle then issued a single of Jesters songs \\"End of TIme\\" and \\"God Told Me To\\" with both Duff and Violet joining on the recording. Duff and Violet reformed the Jesters in 2014 after their debut album was re-released on vinyl by Full Contact, Ektro's vinyl subsidiary. Ektro/Full Contact released their second album, The Sorrows That Refuse to Drown, on April 7, 2017. Musical style The band combined heavy metal, pop and psychedelic rock. Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic described the band's sound as \\"upbeat\\" and wrote \\"CA's Jesters of Destiny confused way too many people to make much of a name for themselves during their brief run through the mid-'80s. If only they'd emerged a decade later, when the convenient label of \\"alternative metal\\" was generously bandied about to everyone from Jane's Addiction to Faith No More, the band might have had better luck.\\" Discography ;Studio albums *Fun at the Funeral (1986) *The Sorrows That Refuse to Drown (2017) ;EPs *In a Nostalgic Mood (1987) References Further reading * \\"Underground\\".

Joensen was the son of Daniel Jacob Joensen from H√∏rg, Sumba and Anna Sofia, born Langaard, both came from the village Sumba. Later he married Julia Mortensen from Fro√∞ba. When Poul F. was 14-year-old he tried to by a seaman as did many of his friends. He was a fisherman for one year. He wished to continue with life at sea and had plans to go fishing with the fishing vessel Robert Miller, but his parents wouldn't permit him to do so. Instead they sent him to T√≥rshavn, to study to become a teacher in public schools. Later it turned out that if he had gone fishing with Robert Miller on that trip, it would have been the last thing that he had done, and no one would have known about his poetry ever. Robert Miller never returned from that trip in March 1914, all men onboard lost their lives.Porkeri.info (A list of deceased from the village Porkeri, people who died in the period 1807 to 1949.

Among many other initiatives and discoveries, she was among the first to find evidence indicating that the infectious agent in Scrapie does not contain nucleic acid: a finding that was instrumental in understanding the development of the Prion theory.Highfield, Roger, \\"The End of BSE\\". The Telegram. 11 February 2011 She was director of the MRC Experimental Radiopathology Unit, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK, 1962‚Äì1974. She married Max Sterne but never adopted his name.  Early life and career  Tikvah Alper was born in South Africa, the youngest of four daughters in a family of Jewish refugees from Russia. As a schoolgirl at Durban Girls' High School, she was described as \\"the most intellectually distinguished girl ever to attend the school\\", and matriculated with distinction a year early. She graduated with distinction in physics from University of Cape Town in 1929, and then studied in Berlin with the nuclear physicist Lise Meitner in 1930‚Äì32, publishing a prize-winning paper on delta rays produced by alpha particles in 1933. In 1932, she returned to South Africa to marry the (later) renowned bacteriologist Max Sterne, the inventor of the most effective livestock vaccine for anthrax. Because married women were not then permitted to work at University, Tikvah and Max established a home laboratory where they worked together. Their sons, Jonathan and Michael, were born in 1935 and 1936. From then on, Tikvah Alper combined demands of motherhood (Jonathan was born profoundly deaf), marriage and career. These included pre- and post-war spells in England, where she worked with the pioneer radiobiologist, Douglas Lea.Lecture by Douglas Lea Over ten years from 1937, Tikvah retrained and then also worked as a teacher of the deaf. Her physics training and technical skills were evident in her published research on making speech articulation visible, for use in speech training for deaf children She became head of the Biophysics section of the South African National Physics Laboratory in 1948.  Later career  Despite their growing scientific renown, in 1951, Max Sterne and Tikvah Alper were forced to leave South Africa because of their outspoken opposition to apartheid. Tikvah found an (unpaid) research post at the MRC Radiobiology Laboratories at the Hammersmith Hospital, London, directed by Hal Gray, whom she had met on earlier visits. Here, work focussed on the mechanisms of the effects of radiation on cell biology. The complexities of the effects of radiation on different cell types, and their interaction with other physiological and chemical processes began to be mapped out at this time, and continued through the 1950s and 60s. She was Director of the Radiobiology Unit from 1962 until her retirement in 1974. Her classic text Cellular RadiobiologyAlper, Tikvah, Cellular Radiobiology. CUP Archive, 1979. was published in 1979. Tikvah Alper continued an active professional life in retirement, culminating in a \\"brilliant lecture to the Radiation Research Society in Dallas, USA at the age of 83..\\".Alper, T (1993) The Scrapie Enigma: insights from radiation experiments Radiation Research 135, 283‚Äì92 She died in Sarisbury, Hampshire, England, in 1995, and was survived by her husband Max, sons Jonathan and Michael, six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.  Alper's role in identifying the infectious agent in Scrapie  Scrapie is a fatal infectious disease of the neural system of sheep; one of a class of brain diseases that can affect cattle (BSE) and humans (Kuru, nCJD). Scrapie had been thought to be caused by a 'slow virus' ‚Äì one that could take years to show as a change in behaviour or movement. By the mid 1960s, it was established that cells could only replicate via DNA. Radioactivity stops cell replication by 'killing' DNA. Alper found that radiation did not kill the infective agent in scrapie, suggesting that a virus was unlikely to be the infective agent. The infective agent had to be smaller and simpler than (viral) DNA. Alper also found that the agent remained active under ultraviolet light. DNA is inactive under UV light. Instead, the agent was killed by light at 237 nm, a wavelength specific to polysaccharide inactivation. Alper and colleagues reported these properties of the scrapie agent ‚Äì a finding that was greeted with astonishment in many quarters, for it appeared to contravene the central dogma that holds that replication (and hence the growth of the disease and its infectious properties) can only proceed via DNA. However, once these empirical findings were accepted, several theories developed to accommodate the peculiar properties of the scrapie agent. The most widely accepted theory today is the prion theory, which posits a 'rogue' protein as the infectious source. However, Alper could not accept that a protein 'mutation' was the agent. Firstly, her UV radiation studies did not indicate a protein agent and, secondly, isolated prions did not induce scrapie. Her own theories concerning the agent were developed in the last years of her life and suggested a more dynamic and complex story.

It is thought to be the earliest of Hartmann's narrative works and dates from around 1185. An adaptation of Chr√©tien de Troyes' Erec et Enide, it is the first Arthurian Romance in German. Erec tells the story of how Erec, a knight at King Arthur's court, wins the hand of the beautiful Enite, but then through excessive devotion to his wife, neglects his duties as a knight and lord. Realising his error, he sets out from the court on a series of increasingly challenging adventures in which he tests Enite's loyalty and gains insight into the purpose of knighthood. Unlike Hartmann's later romance Iwein, which survives in 16 complete manuscripts, Erec is preserved in only a single, much later manuscript, the Ambraser Heldenbuch, and a few small fragments. In spite of this limited manuscript tradition, contemporary and later references show that the work was influential. The text Establishing a text for Erec is problematic. The main manuscript, the Ambraser Heldenbuch (MS A), has no text matching the first 80 lines of Chr√©tien's poem, and indeed starts in mid-sentence. In addition, the text of the Wolfenb√ºttel fragments (MS W) indicates that MS A has a gap of 78 lines later in the poem, while non- rhyming lines indicate several individual incomplete couplets. The MS was written some 330 years after the work was created and, even though the scribe, Hans Ried, seems to have based his text on a good source, its language shows many features which could not have been part of a 12th century version. Conversely, syntactical features that were common in MHG but would have been archaic in the 16th century have been more or less consistently modernised. Der Mantel In MS A the text which corresponds to Chr√©tien's poem is preceded without a break by a separate (and incomplete) Arthurian episode, now called Der Mantel (\\"The Cloak\\"), which involves a chastity test with a magic cloak ‚Äî of all the ladies in the court, Enite comes closest to winning. This episode is introduced in the manuscript by a single heading which treats Der Mantel and Erec as constituting a single work. Der Mantel has its source not in Chr√©tien but in the Old French fabliau Du manteau mautailli√©. In the 19th century Der Mantel was ascribed to Heinrich von dem T√ºrlin, whose Diu Cr√¥ne (\\"The Crown\\") was thought to contain a reference to a lost Lancelot romance of his which included this motif of the chastity-testing cloak. This attribution is now discounted and the work regarded as anonymous. The most recent editors of the Ambraser text make a case for accepting the manuscript compiler's view that Der Mantel is part of Erec, a preface, with the main story showing how Enite came to be deserving winner of the cloak. However, even if the dating of the German version is uncertain, the dating of the Old French original to the last decade of the 12th century or later (i.e. after the composition of Erec) appears to disqualify the German adaptation as an original part of Hartmann's work. Nonetheless one specific change made to the French tale by the author of the Der Mantel links it with Erec: in the original the cloak is won by Briebriz, the wife of Caradoc, while the German author awards it to Enite, wife of Erec. Whether this change was undertaken specifically in order to make it a suitable preface to Erec, or whether it was made independently and is the reason for two texts becoming associated, is impossible to determine, as is the likely date of their combination into the single work that Hans Ried used as a source. The Central German Erec The \\"new\\" Wolfenb√ºttel fragments and the Zwettl fragments adhere much more closely to Chr√©tien's original than the text of Erec represented in the other manuscripts (including the \\"old\\" Wolfenb√ºttel fragments). A number of characteristics set these most recently discovered fragments apart from the established text of Erec: more accurate, sometimes word-for-word translation of the Old French, a much greater prevalence of French loanwords in the German text (some not found elsewhere in MHG), and a number of triplet rhymes. For these reasons, the fragments are taken to provide evidence of a distinct German version of Chr√©tien's poem, called, on the basis of their dialect, the \\"Central German Erec\\" (German: Der mitteldeutsche \\"Erec\\"), or simply the \\"Second Erec\\" With the \\"old\\" Wolfenb√ºttel fragments matching Hartmann's text and the \\"new\\" representing a different version, it is unclear why the scribe of this manuscript switched source in the middle of the text, and the relation between this version of Erec and Hartmann's remains a matter of debate. Synopsis  The Cloak  After a prologue, the narrative opens with a Pentecost celebration at the court of King Arthur, where a large number of noble guests have gathered. On the third day of the feast, everyone is waiting after morning Mass to start the meal. However, Arthur refuses his guests food because he is hungry for an adventure. Finally, on behalf of his anonymous mistress from the fairy kingdom, who hates all the ladies of the Arthurian Court, a young messenger brings a magical cloak to the court, which will fit only a woman who is absolutely faithful to her man. All the ladies of the court fail the virtue test miserably, to the consternation of the men. Finally, Erec's wife Enite puts on the cloak and it fits her except for a few missing inches on the lower hem, which shows that Enite is almost perfectly virtuous. (Here the episode breaks off, incomplete.) Two Beauty Contests King Arthur hunting the White Stag. From a 13th century MS of Chr√©tien's Erec et Enide. (From Chr√©tien: The Arthurian court is celebrating Easter. Arthur wishes to revive the tradition of hunting the white stag: whoever kills the stag must kiss the most beautiful maiden. The knights set off on the hunt. The Queen follows, with a maidservant, and Erec comes after them.) Riding with the two ladies, the young, untried knight Erec, son of King Lac, is dishonoured by the dwarf of a wandering knight (Iders) before the eyes of Queen Guinevere. Being without armour, Erec cannot immediately challenge the knight, but he chases the group and arrives at the castle of Tulmein. Searching for accommodation, Erec comes across the impoverished nobleman Coralus, who offers him accommodation, and Erec is looked after by Coralus's beautiful daughter Enite. From Coralus Erec learns of the upcoming sparrowhawk challenge: the sparrowhawk is the prize for the most beautiful lady, whose claim must be defended by her knight. Erec then discovers from Coralus, that the knight he had been chasing was called Iders and had come to defend his lady's claim to the sparrowhawk. Erec decides to participate in the tournament if Coralus can lend him armour, promising to marry Enite in case of victory. In the tournament the next day, Erec defeats Iders. Erec returns to the Arthurian court with Enite ‚Äî on the journey the couple fall in love. At court, the white stag having been killed in the hunt, Enite is declared the most beautiful maiden and receives the kiss from Arthur. Erec and Enite are married, and Arthur announces a tournament in Erec's honour, at which he defeats all opponents. The couple return to Karnant, the castle of Erec's father, who renounces rule in favour of his son. Erec's Adventures Erec now devotes himself to a life of ease, spending the days in bed with Enite, and neglects his duties as ruler. However, he overhears Enite lamenting the fact that he has become the laughingstock of the court, and decides to leave in secret in order to seek adventure. He takes Enite with him, forbidding her to speak on pain of death. He has a series of encounters and in each case it is Enite who, contrary to Erec's command, warns him of the approaching danger. #The couple are attacked first by three and then by five robber knights. Erec defeats them all, berates Enite for breaking her silence and makes her lead the captured horses. #A count attempts to seduce Enite away from Erec, but she tricks the count and alerts Erec, who defeats him. #Erec is attacked by the dwarf king Guivrez and wounded, but defeats him and accepts him as a vassal. (There is probably a gap in the text here, since a warning from Enite, later referred to and present in Chr√©tien's text, is absent.) Erec encounters the Arthurian court, which is engaged in a hunt. They pressure him to remain with them but he refuses, feeling still unworthy. #Erec hears the cries of a lady, whose husband Cadoc, on his way to Arthur's court, has been taken by two giants. Erec kills the giants and frees Cadoc, asking him to commend Erec to Guinevere when he arrives at court. #Severely wounded in his battle with the giants, Erec loses consciousness. After a lengthy lament, believing Erec dead, Enite is about to kill herself with his sword, when Count Oringles is attracted by her cries. When Enite refuses Oringles's entreaties to marry him, he starts to beat her, but her cries rouse Erec, who kills Oringles. Erec and Enite are reconciled and Erec apologises for testing her. #A squire escaping from Oringles's castle goes to tell Guivrez in the neighbouring kingdom how his lord has been slain by a dead man. Guivrez, understanding that this must be Erec, rides with his retainers to assist him. Not recognizing each other, Erec and Guivrez fight. Erec, already weak from his wounds, is defeated, but when Enite begs for his life Guivrez recognizes her. Erec and Enite are invited to stay at Guivrez's castle, Penefric. Guivrez's sisters give Enite a horse, which is described in great detail.  Joie de la Curt The couple, accompanied by Guivrez, set off in search of Arthur's court but take a wrong turning and arrive at Castle Brandigan. There Erec will undertake a final adventure called Joie de la Curt (\\"Joy of the Court\\"): by the castle is an orchard, guarded by the knight Mabonagrin. He has been forced to defend the orchard against all-comers by a reckless vow to a lady, from which he will only be released if he is defeated. So far he has killed 80 challengers, whose heads are displayed on stakes and whose widows are housed in the castle. Erec ignores all the warnings against embarking on this adventure, and fights and defeats Mabonagrin. He is grateful for his defeat, and his lady is revealed as a cousin of Enite's. They leave the orchard together, and Erec and Enite console the widows and offer to take them to Arthur's court, where they are received with acclaim. Homecoming From Arthur's court Erec and Enite return to Karnant, where they are greeted with joyous celebration. Erec gives thanks to God for his lasting fame. Both live with honour to a great age and are rewarded with eternal life. The Manuscripts The Wolfenb√ºttel Manuscript of Hartmann von Aue's Erec. Fragment IV recto. The only more or less complete manuscript of Erec is: * MS A, the Ambraser Heldenbuch (Austrian National Library, Cod. ser. nova 2663), commissioned by the Emperor Maximilian I and written between 1504 and 1516 by Hans Ried. It is missing the start of Erec, two sections of the narrative, and a number of individual lines. The text has been conscientiously copied from a much earlier manuscript (probably early 13th century), but the scribe has introduced many changes in spelling and wording in an attempt to make it comprehensible to a 16th century reader. The dialect is South Bavarian. Erec is the last of a collection of poems attributed to Hartmann in this MS. There are four sets of fragments: *MS K (Koblenz, Landeshauptarchiv, Best. 701 Nr. 759,14b), a double folio from the first half of the 13th century. The dialect is Rhine Franconian from an Upper German original. This MS is closest to Hartmann in date and language. It contains lines 7522‚Äì7705 (part of the description of Enite's horse) and lines 8436‚Äì8604 (Erec's conversation with Ivrein at Castle Brandigan). *MS V (St. P√∂lten, Landesarchiv, St√§ndisches Archiv, Hs. 821), a single sheet in Bavarian dialect dating from the third quarter of the 14th century. It comprises the last 31 lines of the poem. *MS W (Wolfenb√ºttel, Herzog August Bibl., zu Cod. Guelf 19.26.9 Aug. 4¬∞), Dating from the third quarter of the 13th century, the language has been characterised as \\"Thuringian-Hessian from a Low German scribe\\". **The \\"old fragments\\", first published in 1898: two double sheets with 317 lines matching lines 4549‚Äì4832 of A (the aftermath of Erec's first combat against Guivrez) and which include 57 lines missing from A. **The \\"new fragments\\", first published in 1978: nine narrow horizontal strips cut from a double sheet. with 157 lines. The text is independent of A and closer to Chr√©tien's original. *MS Z (Zwettl Abbey, Stiftsbibliothek, Fragm. Z 8-18), 10 small pieces in poor condition discovered in 2002 and a further piece discovered in 2013.They have been dated to the second or third quarter of the 13th century. The dialect is the same as that of the Wolfenb√ºttel fragments and all share the same closeness to Chr√©tien's original. Sources Hartmann's Erec is a free adaptation of Chr√©tien de Troyes' Erec et Enide, though Hartmann's poem is considerably longer and differs in many details. In some cases, Erec is closer to the Welsh Geraint ac Enid, which suggests that Hartmann may also have drawn on an oral tradition independent of Chr√©tien. Chr√©tien himself mentions this tradition and distances himself from it: \\"This is the tale of Erec, son of Lac, which those who try to live by storytelling customarily mangle and corrupt before kings and counts.\\" (ll. 19‚Äì22) The use of another written source is discounted. Reception Hartmann's Erec was highly influential. All the early German Arthurian romances drew on it ‚Äî Wirnt von Grafenberg's Wigalois, Heinrich von dem T√ºrlin's Diu Cr√¥ne, and Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's Lanzelet. The anonymous Friedrich von Schwaben took five passages directly from Erec with minor changes. Not only were Hartmann's works influential, he had a personal reputation, recognized as the founder and first master of the genre of Arthurian Romance in German. As Jackson puts it, \\"The reception of Hartmann‚Äôs Arthurian romances shows a strong profiling precisely of the author.\\" Erec also provided the inspiration for the \\"earliest known setting of any medieval romance in applied art\\" in the form of the gold processional cross now held in the treasury of the Wawel Cathedral in Krak√≥w. The cross is constituted by two crowns, with that forming the horizontal arm depicting scenes from Hartmann's Erec. The Erec crown was probably made in the Upper Rhineland in the period 1225‚Äì1250 and may be connected with the court of the Emperor Frederick II. Rushing remarks that \\"the convoluted structure of the crown‚Äôs visual narrative would be hard to follow without fairly extensive prior knowledge of the story\\".

He was a brother of Sali Aga, a mutesellim of Rudnik Ottoman nahiyah at the beginning of 19th century. Biography Alija was born in the Rudnik nahiyah and belonged to the ƒêevrliƒá family. He advanced in Ottoman service from regular janissary to the position of mutesellim of Kragujevac. Recruited from the local Muslim population, he was a Yamak. Together with other renegade janissaries, Alija captured Had≈æi Mustafa Pasha, the Vizier of Belgrade, in October 1801 and killed him on 15 December 1801 in the Belgrade Fortress. After the murder, Alija became one of four leaders, known as dahije, who ruled the Sanjak of Smederevo (also known as the Belgrade Pashalik), alongside Aganlija, Mula Jusuf and Mehmed-aga Foƒçiƒá. His wife was the sister of one of his military commanders. In early March 1804, at the beginning of the First Serbian Uprising, rebels besieged Rudnik which was under control of Sali Aga, Kuchuk's brother. When four dahiyahs were informed about the rebellion they agreed that Kuchuk Ali should go from Belgrade to Rudnik with 600 janissaries to release Rudnik from siege and to advance with his forces to ≈†abac through Valjevo, while Belgrade was left under protection of three remaining dahiyahs. According to some sources Kuchuk Ali had intention to first go to Kragujevac to gather more forces then to Jagodina to hire Halil Gu≈°anac and his Arnauts and then to attack rebels. Gu≈°anac with 1,600 Arnauts and Krd≈æalijas were sent by Osman Pazvantoƒülu to help dahiyah in suppressing the rebellion. When Kuchuk Ali advanced toward south he did not have information that rebels already captured Rudnik on 11 March. He attacked Karaƒëorƒëe who was with Janko Katiƒá and around hundred rebels in Vrbica, waiting for other rebels to join them. Kuchuk Ali was informed about Karaƒëorƒëe's position by knez Maksim from Guberevac who was later killed by the rebels because of his treason. Karaƒëorƒëe and his forces fled from the battle. After battle in Vrbica Kuchuk Ali and his horsemen continued their journey through ≈†umadija and reached ƒÜuprija and Jagodina via Kragujevac on 15 March 1804. The rebels followed him and captured Kragujevac on 4 April 1804 after Kuchuk Ali already left it, taking 200 janissaries from Kragujevac with him. The rebels attacked Kuchuk's forces near Avala and inflicted significant casualties to them. Kuƒçuk Alija and other dahiyas fled from Belgrade abandoning their followers and went by boats to Ada Kaleh island on the Danube.

Black Ivory Coffee is a brand of coffee produced by the Black Ivory Coffee Company Ltd in northern Thailand from Arabica coffee beans consumed by elephants and collected from their waste. The taste of Black Ivory coffee is influenced by elephants' digestive enzymes, which breaks down the coffee's protein. The taste is influenced also by the natural fermentation process of the elephants. The coffee beans are digested within 15 to 70 hours, and are present with various other ingredients in the elephants' stomachs, which imparts specific flavors to the product.  Availability  Black Ivory coffee has been described as \\"very smooth without the bitterness of regular coffee\\" and is among the world's most expensive coffees, at US$2,000 per kilogram. It has limited availability at a few luxury hotels it is available at the price of US$50 a cup and via the internet website. An average of 150 kilograms of the coffee produced every year. The supply of Black Ivory coffee depends on the availability of coffee cherries, the appetite of the elephants, the number of beans destroyed through chewing of the beans and the ability of the mahouts and their wives to recover intact beans. The high price of the product is largely due to the large number of coffee cherries needed to produce the finished product: 33 kilograms (72 pounds) of raw coffee cherries results in one kilogram (two pounds) of the finished product. Most of the beans are not recoverable because they are chewed by the elephants, become fragmented, or after being excreted are lost in the bush. Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation This coffee was first produced by Black Ivory Coffee Co. Ltd. at the Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation in Chiang Saen, an elephant refuge that cares for rescued elephants. Now, Black Ivory Coffee no longer produces in the Golden Triangle but in Surin province in north east Thailand. Approximately 20 elephants at the foundation produce the coffee. Eight percent of Black Ivory Coffee Company sales are donated to the Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation, which is used to fund the elephants' health care. The consumption of the coffee cherries does not adversely affect the elephants, and veterinary tests concluded that caffeine is not absorbed from the coffee cherries they consume.

Described as new to science in 2012, it is named after John W. Allen, who provided the type collection. It is found in the northwestern North America from Los Angeles, California to British Columbia, Canada, most commonly within of the Pacific coast. The fruitbodies (mushrooms) grow on rotting wood, especially wood chips used in garden landscaping. The caps of the mushrooms are brown to buff, broadly convex to flattened and have a diameter up to , while the white stipes are up to long and thick. As a bluing species in the genus Psilocybe, P. allenii contains the psychoactive compounds psilocin and psilocybin, and it is consumed recreationally for its hallucinogenic properties. It is closely related to Psilocybe cyanescens, from which it differs macroscopically by the lack of a wavy cap margin. Taxonomy Psilocybe allenii was described as new to science in 2012 by Jan Boroviƒçka, Alan Rockefeller, and Peter G. Werner. Boroviƒçka received material collected from Seattle, Washington, which he noted was microscopically similar to Psilocybe cyanescens, but lacked the wavy cap margins characteristic of that species. In previous publications, Boroviƒçka had noted that both macro- and microscopic characters of certain Psilocybe species were highly variable, which could also account for the differences observed in the Seattle material. However, DNA sequencing revealed a 5-base pair change in the internal transcribed spacer regions (a segment of RNA often used in molecular phylogenetics to identify or distinguish fungal species) between P. cyanescens and the Seattle collections. This difference, in addition to the readily observable macroscopic differences, was deemed sufficient to warrant describing the taxon as a new species. Additional molecular studies published by Boroviƒçka and colleagues in 2015 identified P. azurescens, P. cyanescens, P. weraroa, P. cubensis, and P. serbica as closely related to P. allenii. For several years before its official description, the taxon was known in the San Francisco Bay Area, and suspected of being an undescribed species. The authors suggest that a color photograph of \\"P. cyanescens\\" in David Arora's popular 1986 guidebook Mushrooms Demystified may actually depict P. allenii. Mycologist Paul Stamets suggested in 2005 that it \\"probably is new, or least a newly imported species\\". It is commonly called \\"Psilocybe cyanofriscosa\\" in the online mycological community, but this name is grammatically incorrect Latin and has never been validly published in scientific literature. The specific epithet allenii honors John W. Allen, who collected the original material and provided the impetus for the study. Allen collected the type material from the University of Washington Campus in November 2009. He first collected the fungus in Capitol Hill in 1982, and several times later from Seattle. Some of these collections he sent to Mexican Psilocybe specialist Gast√≥n Guzm√°n, who initially thought them to be P. cyanescens because of their overlapping spore size ranges. Description Gills are adnate to sinuate, and become darker as the spores mature. Fruitbodies of P. allenii are variable in size, depending on the substrate in which they grow. The caps are in diameter, and range from broadly convex to flattened, sometimes with a slight depression in the center. The cap margin is either straight and slightly curved inward, rarely slightly wavy, and sometimes has radial grooves in moist specimens. The surface is smooth, sticky when moist, with a gelatinous cap cuticle that can be peeled. Wet fruitbodies are so slippery that they are difficult to collect. Caps are hygrophanous, and so will change color depending on how moist they are. They are pale orange brown to caramel brown when moist, but dry to yellowish-buff. Gills have an adnate to sinuate attachment to the stipe, and are initially cream to pale gray brown, but become dark purple as the spores mature. The cylindrical, hollow stipe typically measures long by thick, with the base slightly thicker. The top of the stipe is pruinose (covered with white powdery granules), while the base is connected to thick white rhizomorphs. The stipe surface is smooth to silky fibrillose (as if made of silky, slender fibers), and its color initially white before yellowing slightly in age. Mycelium at the base of the stipe is white or stained blue. All parts of the fruitbody stain blue if bruised or handled. Young specimens have a white partial veil that later disappears, or remains as a zone on the stipe that can be colored purplish brown by spores. The odor and taste of the mushroom is farinaceous‚Äîsimilar to freshly ground flour. Spore prints are dark brown, sometimes with violet shades. Spores are thick-walled with an apical pore, and elongated ellipsoid to equilateral in face view, and somewhat inequilateral in side view, typically measuring 12.0‚Äì12.6‚Äì13.1 by 6.8‚Äì7.1‚Äì7.4 Œºm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical, four-spored with sterigmata up to 5.5 Œºm long, and have dimensions of 27‚Äì37 by 9‚Äì11 Œºm. Clamp connections are present in hyphae. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are abundant. They are hyaline (translucent), thin-walled, and variably shaped, and range from narrow clubs to narrow flasks with a neck no longer than 8 Œºm; their dimensions are typically 20‚Äì30 by 6‚Äì8 Œºm. The pleurocystidia (found on the gill face) are common; they are broadly club-shaped but taper to a point (sometimes with a rounded tip at the end), and measure 25‚Äì35 by 9‚Äì14 Œºm. Caulocystidia (found on the stipe) are also present, with variable shapes similar to the cheilo- and pleurocystidia. The mushrooms are consumed for their psychoactive properties, and have a potency roughly similar to P. cyanescens. Boroviƒçka and colleagues say they are \\"commonly sought out by some mushroom hunters\\". According to Rockefeller, \\"If you go to Golden Gate Park in December you will see hundreds of hippies looking at the wood chip landscaping for Psilocybe cyanescens and Psilocybe allenii.\\" Similar species Several Psilocybe species have an appearance roughly similar to P. allenii, but these can usually be distinguished by differences in morphology or distribution. The European species P. serbica var. moravica has a similar cap and stipe, but is generally more slender than P. allenii. The closely related P. cyanescens is indistinguishable by microscopic characteristics, but features a wavy cap in maturity, a longer fruiting season (from late September through April), and lacks a ring zone on the stipe often seen in P. allenii. P. azurescens has a broader cap, an umbo that may be broad or acute, a longer stipe up to , and a growing season similar to that of P. cyanescens. The authors also note that the Australian P. subaeruginosa is similar (including three taxa that have since been synonymized: P. australiana, P. eucalypta, and P. tasmaniana) but suggest that further research is required to better understand the delimitation of this species complex. Habitat and distribution Psilocybe allenii is found in the northwestern North America, with a range extending from British Columbia south to Los Angeles, California. It is most common in areas up to from the Pacific coast, although it has been collected inland. Fruitbodies grow scattered, in groups, or (more rarely) in clusters, on woody debris, such as wood chips often used in landscaping. Favored substrates include hardwood mulches made of oak, eucalyptus, Douglas fir, and alder. Fruiting occurs in cold weather, generally from late September to January. The species can be readily cultivated on agar, grain spawn, and cellulosic material, including wood chips and sawdust.

The son of Ludovicus De Deken and Maria-Theresia Van Dyck, he studied theology at the major seminary of Mechelen, then he made his novitiate in Scheut Fathers in 1877. There became ordained priest in June 1879 and took his final vows in March 1881 to be called to go to China to evangelize the population. He is sent to the Apostolic Vicariate of Kan-Su-Koukounor (now Gansu) in Chinese Turkestan. Scheutistes are present in China since 1865 and want to expand their ministry to the northwest. There follows a short study period Lanchow to improve his Chinese and evangelizing the region of Sichuan from April 1882, he toured from the parish of Kuldja. He remained there until 1889. In 1889 he joined a scientific expedition of Bonvalot Gabriel (accompanied by Prince Henri d'Orl√©ans, as botanist and photographer) in Turkestan with his Chinese servant Bartholomeus. De Deken speaks Chinese and serves as interpreter. The goal was to reach Shanghai across the Central Asia, Tibetan and the Tonkin, which was completed in September 1890. De Deken then separates from the explorers and heads on a boat to Haiphong to eventually return to France. These were the first modern European explorations penetrating the high Tibetan plateau, away from the roads which had been done before the Father Huc and later Nikolai Przewalski. This expedition was unprecedented, having traveled six thousand kilometers and recovering botanical collections that were subsequently studied at the Natural History Museum of Paris. A year later Father De Deken left China and returned to the Scheutist fathers in Brussels for a year. He published a description of his journey in a book published in French entitled Across Asia (1891). Congo De Deken left Belgium in June 1892, this time to king Leopold's domain, Congo Free State, where Scheutists had been present since 1889. There he was appointed to Boma. From autumn 1894 to autumn 1895, he returned to Brussels. His health began failing. Subsequently, he returned to the Congo, where he arrived in November 1895 and died 3 March 1896 a few days before celebrating his forty-four years. His controversial statue is visible in Wilrijk (it depicts him standing with one of his knee on top of the back of a begging Congo native). He also has another statue in Antwerp.

A few species are annuals, but most are perennials. Common names are not well established, but often refer to more familiar plants, as in \\"wild violet\\" for Monopsis unidentata, \\"yellow lobelia\\" for Monopsis lutea or \\"pansy lobelia\\" for Monopsis debilis. Description Their stems are variously but irregularly branched and in many species are prostrate and creeping, rooting at nodes. Such species are horticulturally useful components of flat ground cover. The leaf placement or phyllotaxis of the various species also varies, being either opposite or alternate, depending on the species. The leaves are fairly small and generally lightly to markedly toothed. In shape the leaves are simple, and those of various species vary from elliptic, through lanceolate, to short linear. The flowers may be borne in terminal racemes or spikes, but most species bear numerous solitary flowers on pedicels in leaf axils. The pedicels generally twist in such a manner as to present the three- petalled lip uppermost, though in some species such as Monopsis decipiens the two-petalled lip is usually on top. Consistency on this respect is most likely an adaptation to favour preferred pollinators, as it permits them to perform their functions most efficiently, both for the plant and for their own reproductive success. Most species have flowers of either yellow or purple; the colours being vibrant and intense, much like those of many of the Lobelia species. A few have flowers of various intermediate colours such as salmon. Flowers of some species, such as Monopsis decipiens are colourfully patterned. Some species have white flowers. The calyx has five lobes, its tube being fused to the ovary. The corolla has five petals, the corolla tube of most species being split nearly to its base, forming two lips or lobes. The upper lip has three of the petals, the lower lip the remaining two. In some species the petals of the two-part lip are nearly fully fused, but in others they are nearly completely split. There are five stamens; in some species they are free from the tube of the corolla, but in others they grow from near the base of the tube. The anthers, and in some species the upper parts of the filaments of the stamens, are joined into a ring around the style. The tips of the anthers are bearded with little brushes of white hair. The ovary is inferior and more or less fused to the calyx; it has two locules, each containing many small ovules. The style is thread-like, bent, and divides into slender, elongated flat stigmas that are hairy at their bases and protrude from the ring of anthers. The seed capsule has two valves and splits loculicidally. Distribution The genus is native to the continent of Africa, all but two of the described species occurring mainly within Southern Africa, and one species being present also on the Comoro Islands. Most are those are endemic to Southern Africa, about half of them being fynbos species.

Bushier species such as Monopsis unidentata do well as deeper ground covers in damp spots or in beds and pots as well as fillers in nooks and crannies in gardens where many other more formal plants either are troublesome or refuse to grow satisfactorily. Both types are rewarding in walls and hanging baskets. In some regions at least, Monopsis species are recognised as desirable in bird-friendly gardens.Hes, Lex and Tredler, Roy.

(JSC)) is situated on the northern Croatian Adriatic coast, 3 km from the largest Croatian port It was founded in 1896, and was among the first in the world to deal with ship lengthenings. It is quoted on the Zagreb Stock Exchange with ticker VLEN-R-B. Today it has three floating dry docks, one accommodating vessels up to 160,000 dwt, more than 1,000 metres of berthing space, a large offshore construction site and it specializes in ship conversions and gas platform construction.  History  In 1896 a ship repair facility for the merchant, naval and fishing vessel fleets of the Austro-Hungarian Empire was founded in Rijeka, the largest Adriatic port, under the name Lazarus. After the end of the Second World War, in 1948, the yard was nationalised and renamed Viktor Lenac, after a communist who worked at the shipyard and was honoured by it. In the late 1960s the shipyard was moved 3 kilometres to the south to its present location at Martin≈°ƒáica Bay (Kostrena), which has an adequate water depth to accommodate vessels with deep draughts. The shipyard purchased two floating drydocks and cranes and put them in the bay. After this move, the yard rapidly developed its repair, conversion, and offshore capabilities. After a managerial reorganization in 1990, the shipyard was registered as a joint-stock company in 1993 and is today the only privately owned major shipyard in Croatia. After being rescued several times by government guarantees, the company filed for bankruptcy in November 2003 with debts of ‚Ç¨102 million, after the government refused to guarantee a loan of US$12 million. The bankruptcy process was completed in 2008 and Tankerska plovidba Co., Croatia's largest shipping company, became the largest shareholder, followed by the Uljanik Shipyard, Croatia's major builder of car carriers and dredgers. The yacht Galeb, used by communist dictator Marshal Tito, has been berthed at the shipyard since before 2008. The city of Rijeka and its communist mayor Obersnel, plans to convert it into a communist museum. In 2009 Floating Dock No. 11, that can accommodate vessels up to Suezmax size, was put into full operation after refurbishment. In 2011, the shipyard won a competitive bidding process for a 60-day maintenance program on the American ship USS Mount Whitney, during which the shipyard was visited by the United States Ambassador to Croatia, and Frank Pandolfe, commander, U.S. 6th Fleet. The visit was said to have served to strengthen the bonds between the two countries. Viktor Lenac has successfully completed extensive ship repair and dry-docking of US Navy's 6th Fleet flagship USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20). This highly complex project marked the year as one of the most important ship repair projects. It occupied a large part of the shipyard resources most of 2015. The works commenced in January 2015 and were completed in August 2015. They included complete overhaul and docking of the ship, class surveys, renovation of accommodations and galleys, shell plating and deckhouse steel renewal. Especially interesting was the modification of the existing vessel‚Äôs electrical power supply system and the installation of new generators, switch boards and control mechanisms, and refurbishment of the fuel system, reverse osmosis system, black and gray discharge water system, fire alarm and similar. UHP water blasting of hull, Ballast tanks blasting with steel shots and application of full coating system, cleaning and gas freeing of all fuel tanks, modification of existing spaces into the new auxiliary engine room including installation of 3 new CAT generators, switch boards and control room was carried out. This is the second time that Viktor Lenac has been awarded a USS Mount Whitney contract. In 2011 the ship underwent extensive docking and class surveys.

It was written by Bridget Bedard, Andre Jacquemetton, Maria Jacquemetton and series creator Matthew Weiner. The episode was directed by Tim Hunter. The episode originally aired on the AMC channel in the United States on September 27, 2007. Plot Betty's father Gene comes to visit for Labor Day. Since the recent death of Betty's mother, Gene has found a new companion named Gloria, whom Betty dislikes. The three of them leave for their Labor Day weekend trip, with Don promising to join them the following day. At Sterling Cooper, Don and the other ad men discuss the Richard Nixon campaign and meet with Rachel and her father about their plan to remodel her department store. Roger tries to convince Joan to spend the evening with him, but she rejects him in favor of going out on the town with her roommate, Carol. Joan's roommate is distressed because she was fired from her publishing job when she was made the scapegoat for her boss's mistake. Joan and her roommate bond over their anger at being used by men. Pete informs Don that one of his accounts, Dr. Scholl's, is leaving for another agency because of their dissatisfaction with creative. Roger, still looking for companionship, offers to help take Don's mind off the lost client. They meet a pair of young twins at an ad audition, and invite them upstairs for drinks. In the now-empty office, Roger propositions both girls, while Don seems uninterested in doing anything but going home. Meanwhile, as they prepare to go out, Carol unexpectedly makes a heartfelt confession of love to Joan. Shocked, Joan deflects, tells Carol she has had a long day, and suggests they head out. The two of them pick up a pair of men to bring home. Carol, clearly heartbroken, resigns herself to spending the night with a strange man instead of Joan. At the office, Roger suffers a major heart attack while attempting to have sex with one of the girls for a second time. He survives, but is hospitalized. Don watches sadly from the doorway of the hospital room as Mona and Margaret arrive and the family tearfully embraces. Don phones Betty and tells her he will be unable to join her and the rest of the family on their vacation. Betty expresses concern over Roger's condition, then shares her disappointment about her father's newfound relationship after her mother's still-recent death. Joan is notified of Roger's heart attack by Bert. She meets him at the office late at night to write a telegram informing their clients of what has happened and assuring them there will be no interruption in their services. Noticing Joan's tears, Bert tells her that she can do better, imploring her not to \\"waste her youth on age.\\" Pete arrives at the hospital just in time for Don and him to watch a highly persuasive TV ad for John F. Kennedy, which paints Nixon as inexperienced and out-of-touch. Feeling desperate for a connection, Don knocks on Rachel's door. Seeing him in distress, she lets him enter. Don tells her how uncertain he is feeling in the wake of Roger's heart attack, and makes several attempts at seducing Rachel before she finally agrees. Post-coitus, Don confesses secret details of his life to her. He tells her he was born to a prostitute who died in childbirth and was raised by his drunk father and abusive stepmother. After his father died from a horse kick when he was 10, Don was raised by his stepmother and her new husband, whom Don refers to as \\"those two sorry people.\\" Cultural references A dynamic, substance-free Kennedy ad is watched by Sterling Cooper, followed by a dull but serious Nixon ad. Roger and Joan discuss the film The Apartment. Joan compares her situation with Roger to that of Shirley MacLaine's character in the film. Joan also compares herself to Doris Day in the films Pillow Talk and Midnight Lace, but then confesses she would rather be Kim Novak in \\"just about anything.\\" Roger also mentions the Alfred Hitchcock film Psycho. Roger flippantly calls Don, \\"Rochester\\" when asking him to bring ice cubes, in reference to how the radio and TV comedian Jack Benny addressed his butler Eddie \\"Rochester\\" Anderson. Reception The episode was received positively by critics at the time. Alan Sepinwall, writing for New Jersey's The Star-Ledger, praised the episode, saying that it and the show itself were \\"dense and layered\\" and \\"deserving of deeper analysis\\". Emily VanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club in 2014, was more critical of the episode, writing that the episode was \\"one of Mad Men's clunkier episodes\\" but she praised other aspects of the episode, including John Slattery's performance as Roger.

It enjoyed a wide audience in the various French-speaking countries of Europe during the 19th century. The initial form of the journal was the Biblioth√®que Britannique, which began publication in 1796, and focused on British science, techniques, literature and agriculture.

After Pictet's death (1825), the periodical was taken over by Georges Maurice (1799‚Äì1839) and Pictet de Rochemont's two sons, soon joined by a group of Genevan scholars including Etienne Dumont, Pellegrino Rossi, Jacob Frederic Lullin de Ch√¢teauvieux, as well as Augustin Pyramus de Candolle and Auguste De la Rive for the scientific part. In 1836, the two main series, science and literature, were merged for a period of ten years under the leadership of Auguste De la Rive and given the name of Biblioth√®que universelle de Gen√®ve. In 1846, the periodical was divided again between a series on literature, which kept the name of \\"Biblioth√®que Universelle\\" and a series on science, which took the name of \\"Archives des Sciences Physiques et Naturelles\\". The \\"Biblioth√®que Universelle\\" went through many changes, which did not prevent its encyclopedic formula to become gradually obsolete.

BII support start-up companies financially and with business development, and operates an incubator that is open for early stage start-up companies in life science.  Research  Nielsen has been studying and engineering metabolism for almost 30 years. His work has produced, among other, natural rare molecules, antibiotics and biofuels. The scope of this work is to be able to produce valuable compounds in an environmentally friendly and sustainable way that does not depend on petrol processing or extraction from endangered plant species. He is also using his unique approach and methods to study metabolism in humans, with specific interest in metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and various cancers.  Industrial microbiology  Nielsen has worked on studying and improving many different industrial biotechnological processes. Initially he worked on physiological characterization of the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum that is used for penicillin production. This resulted in continued work, together with the Dutch company DSM, on development of a novel process for production of adipoyl-7-ADCA, a precursor for cephalexin. He also worked on characterization of many other fermentation processes used for antibiotics production, and through the use of his experimental and modelling techniques he assisted several companies with improving their production process. Nielsen also worked on improving fermentation processed used for production of industrial enzymes, both using fungi and bacteria.  Metabolic engineering  In connection with his work on improving many classical and new fermentation processed Nielsen developed a number of experimental and computational tools that today is the foundation for metabolic engineering, the directed genetic modification of cells with the objective of improving the phenotype. He was the first to use gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC- MS) as an experimental tool for measurement of C13-labelled metabolites with the objective to perform flux analysis. Through metabolic engineering Nielsen has developed and improved a number of biotechnological processes, e.g. 1) improved ethanol production by yeast and reduced glycerol formation as a by- product, 2) improved the temperature tolerance of yeast which has enabled ethanol production at elevated temperatures and thereby reduced costs, 3) production of a range of different chemicals using engineered yeast such as resveratrol, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, human haemoglobin, fatty acid ethyl esters, short chain fatty acids, alkanes, fatty alcohols, santalene, farnesene, coumaric acid and ornithine.  Systems biology of industrial microorganisms  Nielsen has pioneered the development of systems biology tools for industrial microorganisms. He has developed genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) for many important industrial microorganisms, including yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), Lactococcus lactis, Streptomyces coelicolor, Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus niger, Penicilium chrysogenum and Pichia pastoris. Nielsen has also developed a number of tools for performing integrative omics analysis, and he was the first to demonstrate how transcriptome data could be integrated in the context of GEMs in order to gain insight into co-regulation. He has also developed methods for performing quantitative metabolome analysis of many microorganisms as well as he has been involved in genome-sequencing of several key industrial microorganisms.  Human metabolism  Using his systems biology toolbox developed for microorganisms, Nielsen initiated work on human metabolism. In connection with this he developed a comprehensive genome-scale metabolic model for human cells and he was the first to use a human GEM to illustrate the metabolic heterogeneity of cancer metabolism. His work on human metabolism has involved studies of different diseases such as obesity, NAFLD and NASH, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Nielsen further used human GEMs to identify that combined measurements of several glycosaminoglycans can be used as a very strong biomarker for clear cell renal cell carcinoma, probably the first systems biomarker.  Gut microbiota  Nielsen has also used his systems biology competence to study the metabolism of the gut microbiota. He was involved in early studies on using metagenome sequencing for characterization of the gut microbiota and demonstrate that variations are associated with cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. He also used his advanced metabolic modelling skills to gain further functional insight into how the gut microbiota impacts changes in plasma metabolomics in response to dietary changes.

Leatherwood, Nine From Aberdeen is an academic history book dedicated to the U.S. Army Ordnance Bomb Disposal service branch in World War II, which served across the globe. These elite Army Ordnance soldiers, which included some members of the Army Air Forces, were among the forerunners of today's Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) branch. First published in June 2012, this 380-page book includes an afterword from retired EOD Command Sergeant Major James H. Clifford, the chief military consultant for The Hurt Locker, the Motion Picture Academy's Best Film of 2010. The product of nearly ten years, Nine from Aberdeen began in 2003 as the author's original master's thesis at Western Carolina University's Hunter Library. This expanded and revised book relies chiefly on veteran interviews and unit histories to present a cross-section of the whole World War II bomb disposal experience. Nine From Aberdeen also includes many rare photos from private and government collections, as well as charts and diagrams. The hardcover edition features a dust-jacket cover modeled on the U.S. Army Bomb Disposal School's distinctive unit insignia, approved by the Department of the U.S. Army. Shortly after Pearl Harbor, Major Thomas J. Kane and eight other American soldiers traveled to wartime England in order to study methods pioneered by the Royal Engineers. At the time, the U.S. lacked any bomb disposal organization, while the British had the most advanced program at that time. Graduating from the Royal Engineer Bomb Disposal training course, the Americans were honored with honorary membership in the British service. Kane and his cadre returned in early 1942 to supervise the U.S. Army‚Äôs very first explosive ordnance disposal school at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Originally conceived to defend the American homeland from aerial attacks on both coasts, Kane's bomb disposal branch realized its fullest potential in overseas battlefronts, from the Aleutian Islands to the Italian Alps. Kane's school was directly responsible for training eight companies and over 200 squads for field service with the U.S. Army and Air Forces. Three of Kane‚Äôs original cadre members from the British training mission volunteered to lead bomb disposal squads across the Mediterranean, European, and Pacific Theaters, where they repeatedly distinguished themselves for heroism and leadership. Capt. Ronald Felton's 12th BD Squad weathered the Italian mud. Capt. Joe Pilcher‚Äôs 17th BD Squad crossed over during the Normandy campaign and liberated Paris. Capt. Richard Metress died on Mindanao in June 1945 along with three 209th BD Squad technicians while liberating the Philippines. They are memorialized at Manila American Cemetery. Promoted to colonel, Kane carried out two significant missions for the War Department and Office of Civilian Defense, and later capped off his wartime career as Director of Bomb Disposal for Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower in Western Europe. After the war, Col. Kane remained on active duty with the Army, supervising bomb removal operations with occupation forces in Japan, and overseeing the newly constituted U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal branch during the Korean War. Kane died in 1965 and is buried in the Arlington National Cemetery. He was inducted to the Ordnance Hall of Fame in 1969. Ultimately, the Army (and Air Force) Bomb Disposal service took part in nearly all landings and ground operations in World War II, suffering ten percent casualties in the European Theater alone. After the Axis surrender in 1945, bomb disposal technicians aided with post-war reconstruction efforts across the globe. However, Army bomb disposal's small unit increments and wartime secrecy kept them in relative obscurity for most of the duration of World War II. Matters were further complicated when some missions performed by Ordnance were credited to the Army Corps of Engineers, whose battlefield jurisdiction occasionally overlapped with that of Bomb Disposal. In 2004, the 52nd Ordnance Group (EOD) dedicated Kane Hall at Ft. Gillem, GA. In the wake of Fort Gillem's closure in 2006, the 52nd Ordnance Group (EOD) relocated its headquarters to Ft. Campbell, KY in 2009. Dedication for a new Kane Hall took place on 29 March 2013, presided over by Col. Marue \\"Mo\\" Quick, the 52d EOD Group commander. Jeffrey Leatherwood, author of Nine From Aberdeen, delivered the keynote address in honor of Col. Thomas J. Kane.

After the Civil War, Oberlin turned much of its attention to the spread of the Christian gospel of salvation around the world. \\"Let us arise ‚Ä¶\\" said one theologian, \\"to grapple ‚Ä¶ with the stupendous work of supplanting the ‚Ä¶ empire of Satan\\".Thompson, Larry Clinton William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2009, p. 12 Christianity and civilization were believed to be synonymous by many in the Christian world. \\"We contend that a true Civilization cannot exist apart from Christianity,\\" said a missionary journal.Thompson, p. 13 Thus, a missionary could foster the blessings of both Christianity and civilization in the non-Christian countries, the largest of which was China, ruled by the Qing dynasty. \\"Three hundred to four hundred millions of souls are here crowded together [and] nine-tenths of these multitudes are still unreached by the gospel.\\" Underlying the enthusiasm for missionary endeavor was the theory that it was essential to convert the world to Christianity to anticipate the coming of the millennium, the thousand-year reign of Christ foretold in the Bible.Brandt, Nat Massacre in Shansi Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1994, pp. 22-23 The idealism and social and religion activism of Oberlin made it a major contributor to the missionary enterprise around the world. Oberlin graduates such as William Scott Ament had joined the ABCFM and were living and working in China in the 1870s as part of the effort to bring the gospel of Christianity to all peoples. Protestant missionaries were not resident in Shanxi province in inland northern China until the Northern Chinese Famine of 1876-1879. During the famine, caused by a drought, missionaries distributed food in the province to an estimated 3.4 million persons. Even so, according to some estimates five million people, one third of the population in Shanxi, died in the famine.China Famine Relief Fund Shanghai Committee, pp. 1, 88, 128, 157 https://archive.org/details/cu31924023248796, \\"Epidemic Chinese Famine\\" http://www.faculty.kirkwood.edu/ry/ost/Famine.htm, accessed 6 Dec 2012 Roman Catholics had long been resident in Shanxi and a few Chinese had become Catholic, but Protestants and Catholics customarily did not interact even though their respective missions and churches might be in close proximity to each other.Brandt, 1994, pp. 29-30 The Oberlin Band in Shanxi On January 5, 1881, a student at the Oberlin Theological Seminary, Martin Luther Stimson, wrote the American Board and offered the services of 12 graduates of Oberlin as missionaries to China. The American Board accepted the offer and suggested Shanxi, where only a few missionaries of the British China Inland Mission and Baptist Missionary Society were working, as a mission field. Stimson and his wife Emily Brooks (Hall) Stimson became the first of the Oberlin Band to arrive in Shanxi in 1882. They were soon joined by others. A total of 30 missionaries, including male missionaries, their wives, and single female missionaries worked in Shanxi with the Oberlin Band between 1882 and 1900. However, the number on station was always much smaller as turnover was high. Most of the missionaries resigned and departed Shanxi and China after only a few years. The Oberlin Band established missionary stations in the cities of Taigu and Fenzhou, respectively 36 (60 km) and 60 (100 km) miles south and southwest of the capital city of Taiyuan.Brandt, Massacre in Shansi pp. 24-33 From the beginning the Oberlin Band encountered serious problems. None of the missionaries received any training, orientation, or studied Chinese before departing for China, although the American Board gave each family 500 dollars to buy and transport food and other necessities to their station in China. The Chinese language proved immensely difficult for most missionaries to learn. Living conditions in Taigu and Fenzhou were crowded and unsanitary. Disease was rampant. Ten of the thirty adult missionaries died in Shanxi, and many others suffered serious illnesses.Brandt, 1994, p. 34-38 Twelve of 25 children born to Oberlin missionaries in Shanxi died.\\"Woman's Work of Woman in the Lord's Name\\" , accessed 8 Dec 2012 Doctrinal disputes quickly broke out among the missionaries. Charles D. Tenney moved away from conventional Christian beliefs to Unitarianism and favored attempting to evangelize only among the elite. Stimson, on the other hand, favored hiring Chinese preachers and assistants and spreading Christianity from the bottom up. The Oberlin Band sided with Tenney, but eventually adopted the methods of Stimson. Both Tenney and Stimson soon resigned. The missionaries understood little of Chinese culture‚Äîand deplored most of what they understood.Brandt, 1994, pp. 37-61 At Taigu, in 1899, after nearly two decades of work, the missionaries had converted only 76 Chinese. They had also opened a boy's boarding school with 24 pupils, a girl's boarding school with 16 pupils, and had treated 1,313 patients that year at the missionary hospital and dispensary. The missionaries had also housed and treated more than 150 opium addicts during the year.\\"Annual Report of Taiku Station\\" , accessed 9 Dec 2012 The Boxers The Oberlin Band's Annual Report for 1899 mentions rumors among the Chinese that the Christian missionaries were poisoning wells. This was perhaps the first harbinger in Shanxi of the Boxers‚Äîan anti-Christian, anti-foreign peasant movement that began in Shandong province in 1898 and spread north and west. The Boxers were a millenarian movement which believed that by observing the proper rituals they could become invulnerable to Christian bullets and kill or expel the hated foreigners from China. A drought exacerbated the growing unrest in the countryside.Thompson, pp 7-9 In March 1900, a pro-Boxer official named Yuxian was appointed governor of Shanxi. In June 1900, Boxer emissaries arrived in Taigu and Fenzhou and the missionaries began to experience threats and taunts as they moved around the city and the countryside. Menacing mobs gathered outside missionary stations. News came of Boxer attacks on railroads and foreigners near Beijing and of Chinese government support for the Boxers. The missionaries heard the rumor that June 27 was the date set by the Boxers for the extermination of the missionaries in Shanxi. That day passed without incident for the Oberlin Band in Taigu and Fenzhou but two young Englishwomen, missionaries of the China Inland Mission, were killed in an outlying villageBrandt, 1994, pp. 148, 192-198 On July 9, 45 foreign missionaries, Protestant and Catholic, and Chinese Christian leaders were executed by beheading in the government courtyard in Taiyuan.Thompson, Roger R. \\"Reporting the Taiyuan Massacre\\" in Bickers, et al The Boxers, China, and the World Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2007, p. 65 (See Taiyuan Massacre). Most of them were English members of the Baptist Missionary Society. Two of those killed were Ernestine and Mary Atwater, 10 and eight years old, daughters of Oberlin Band members Ernest and Elizabeth Atwater, resident in Fenzhou.Brandt, pp. 214-232 Taigu massacre In July 1900, the Oberlin Band missionaries in Taigu were virtually under siege in the missionary compound. There were six Americans: Rev. Dwight Howard Clapp and his wife Mary Jane; Rev. George Louis Williams and Rev. Francis Ward Davis, both of whose wives were in the United States; and two single female missionaries, Susan Rowena Bird and Mary Louise Partridge. With them were some 50 Chinese Christians, including 22 men. On July 31, a mob of Boxers broke into the compound. The missionaries and a few Chinese hid in an empty shed where they were discovered by a Boxer. Clapp, a pacifist, opposed any resistance, but Davis, armed with a pistol, shot and wounded a Boxer. The Boxers then killed all the Christians, reportedly by burning the shed and stoning the Christians when they attempted to escape. The Boxers then roamed the city and the countryside near Taigu killing 70 to 100 Chinese Christians and members of their families.Brandt, 1994, pp. 234-256 Fenzhou massacre The Memorial Arch at Oberlin College is dedicated to the memory of the 15 missionaries of the Oberlin Band killed in China in 1900. Seven members of the Oberlin Band were in Fenzhou: Charles and Eva Price and their daughter, Florence, about six years old; and Ernest and Elizabeth Atwater and their two younger daughters, Celia and Bertha, about five and three years old. With them were three missionaries of the China Inland Mission. On August 14, the missionaries were ordered to leave the city. The ten missionaries, three Chinese Christians, and two cart drivers departed through the streets while 10,000 people silently watched them depart. The soldiers escorting the missionaries had orders to kill them along the road, One of the Chinese Christians, warned of what was coming, bribed the soldiers with his possessions and was permitted to depart. As he was fleeing he heard shots. All the missionaries were killed. The soldiers robbed the bodies and local villagers buried them.Brandt, 1994, pp. 265-267 Aftermath A multinational army, the Eight-Nation Alliance, rescued foreigners besieged by the Boxers and Chinese Army in Tianjin and Beijing. (See Battle of Tientsin and Siege of the International Legations), but not until January 1901 did German soldiers reach Shanxi and learn the fate of the Oberlin Band and other missionaries in the province. A memorial service was held for the slain in Taiyuan on July 9, one year after the Taiyuan massacre.Brandt, 1994, p. 273 In 1903, a memorial arch to the Oberlin Band was erected on the campus of Oberlin College. The Oberlin Shansi Memorial Association was founded in 1908 and Oberlin graduate Kung Hsiang-hsi opened the Ming Hsien school in Taigu on land given to the ABCFM in restitution for the killing of the missionaries. The school, with help from Oberlin college, continued to function until 1945, when the school was forced to relocate to the southwest China, a small town in Sichuan after the Sino-Japanese War. After Communist China won the civil war in 1949, Ming-Hsiah became Shanxi Agricultural University.Oberlin College Archives\\" accessed 9 Dec 2012 In 1951, Oberlin College and Shanxi Agriculture University lost contact with each other following the outbreak of the Korean War. Then, in 1982, the two schools resumed contact after \\"Reform and Opening.\\" Oberlin begana to send Shansi Reps every year to Shanxi Agricultural University teaching English under the auspices of the Oberlin Shansi Memorial Association, a practice which has continued to this very day.

Lost crops of the Incas. Little known Plants of the Andes with Promise for Worldwide Cultivation. National Academy Press, Washington, p. 37-46 The first mention of ahipa was in connection with the Indian cultures in the Andes, more precisely in the Salta and Jujuy provinces of Argentina.√òrting, B., Gr√ºneberg, J., S√∏rensen, M., 1996. Ahipa (Pachyrhizus ahipa (Wedd.) Parodi) in Bolivia. Genetic Ressources and Crop Evolution, 43, p. 435-446 Indications of the Pachyrhizus species in general were also made at the southern coast of Peru, in the Nasca culture. The origin of the ahipa plants is most likely in the ceja de monta√±as Andean region. Today, it is still in use in small native communities in Bolivia and northern Argentina. The crop was never widely distributed which could have to do with the very specific climatic adaptions it exhibits. Another reason could be the acquisition of Latin America by the Spanish and Portuguese conquest, which had the general policy to destroy the traditional Andean agricultural systems. The local marketing of the Andean bean during the religious festival Corpus Christi indicates a relationship with ancient religious uses. Today, the production is restricted to a few local villages and farmers.  Description  Pachyrhizus ahipa is member of the Fabaceae and predominantly self-pollinating.Leonel, M., Bortolucci Ferrari, T., Bruder, S., Sarmento, S., Alvares de Oliveira, M., 2005. Planting time, developmental stages and characteristics of roots and starch of Pachyrhizus ahipa. Scienta Agricola, 62 The Andean bean is a perennial plant and can grow in erect, semierect or twining forms. The erect species can grow to 15‚Äì40 cm tall, the semierect one about 30‚Äì60 cm, and the twining forms 60‚Äì200 cm long. These plants are herbaceous and lignified depending on the genotype. They do not show a lateral axis. The leaves are trifoliate with stipules or pinnately arranged leaflets with caduceus stipels. The flowers, which grow on short stalks, are white blossoms or of a pale lavender colour. They show a tubular calyx and a papilionaceous corolla. Generally, the flowers exhibit an internally curved stigma in close contact with the anthers. This habitus is very unfavourable in connection with the pollination behaviour of insects, as they are not able to pollinate the flowers very effectively. Additionally, the pollen fertility is often not very high. It varies between 45 and 100%. The flowering pattern is not consistent. Each season, 100 ‚Äì 800 flowers per plant can be produced. P. ahipa is a short-day plant, so flowering takes place under decreasing day length. The pods are 13‚Äì17 cm long and up to 16 mm wide. The seeds are black, lilac, maroon, or black and white mottled. They are round, kidney-shaped, and about 0.8‚Äì1 cm long. Seed production differs from plant to plant and lies between 20 and 100 per plant. The thousand grain weight is around 300 g. Every plant shows a single swollen root, which thins out toward both ends. The roots are about 15 cm long and usually weight about 500-800 g. The yellow skin of the root encloses a white pulp, which is interwoven with a soft fiber. Culture  Sowing  Before sowing, the soil must be loosened to a depth of 15‚Äì25 cm. Further, the soil has to be thoroughly cleaned from weeds and stones. In Bolivia, P. ahipa is normally sown between August and October, depending on the rainy season. The seeding rate is between 40 and 65 kg/ha. In determining the rate, preferred traits such as tuber size play an important role. Further, soil fertility and seed weight must be taken into account. The planting distance is 20‚Äì60 cm between rows and 6‚Äì25 cm between plants in the same row. Therefore, about six to 83 plants/m2 are possible. It is planted on ridges, when it is flood irrigated, which is mostly the case in the Andean region.  Cultivation  The cultivation period is between five and 10 months. The first flowers appear 87‚Äì140 days after sowing. Those flowers are removed manually, a process called reproductive pruning. This means the flowers, as well as the young pods, are removed. The tuberous roots remain the main sink for photosynthates and nutrients. The yield improves drastically. Reproductive pruning is very labour-intensive and must be done once or twice a season.Leidi, E.O., Rodr√≠guez-Navarro, D.N., Fern√°ndez, M., Sarmiento, R., Semedo, J., Marques, N., Matos, A., Machado, A.P., √òrting, B, S√∏rensen, M., Matos, M.C., 2004. Factors affecting root and seed yield in ahipa (Pachyrhizus ahipa (Wedd.) Parodi), a multipurpose legume crop. European Journal of Agronomy, 20, p. 395-403 Mature pods normally appear from April through June. At about nine months, the roots are tuberized and the aerial part is completely dry. P. ahipa is normally sown in a pure culture, but can be intercropped with maize. In a crop rotation, it is sown prior to maize/potato, maize/tomato, maize/oca, groundnut or manioc.  Environmental conditions  Pachyrhizus ahipa can mainly be found in cool tropical and subtropical valleys, on sun-facing slopes, on the border between the warm and cold tropics. The average temperature in this region is 16-18 ¬∞C, although the climatic conditions are extremely dependent on the time of day. The precipitation is between 400 and 700 mm, occurring within 4‚Äì6 months, with the rest being the dry season. Therefore, the climate is semiarid. P. ahipa grows to an elevation of 1800 ‚Äì 3000 m above sea level. Cultivation is mainly carried out along loamy riverbanks. It can also be grown on loamy hillsides. It favours soil pH levels of 6-8 and well-drained soil types. Pachyrhizus ahipa plants can tolerate long dry spells. Anyway, to increase tuber yield, an additional water supply is essential.  Nutrient needs  At the time of harvest, seeds show high nitrogen contents, but some remains in leaves, providing a nitrogen-rich straw which can be used for animal feeding or as fertilizer, if the plant material is incorporated into the soil. In one season, 67 kg N/ha were taken up by roots and seeds. This nitrogen is mainly provided by the inoculation with efficient bacterial strains. The P. ahipa plant is therefore able to form an efficient symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium, and is able to fix 58‚Äì80 kg nitrogen per hectare. No further supply of nitrogen fertilizer is needed. If the vegetative aboveground parts are left in the field, a substantial amount of the fixed nitrogen is returned to the soil, about 12‚Äì80 kg N/ha. The enrichment is very important if a sustainable land-use system is desired. During nodulation, an increased phosphorus supply is advantageous, because nodulation can be improved. Further, it promotes the root and seed yield in P. ahipa plants. The final recipients of P are the pod shells, as well as the seeds. In total, about 7-9.6 kg P/ha were extracted from the soil. At harvest, the highest potassium contents can be found in pod shells and the roots. The removal of K at harvest was about 20.2 kg K/ha.Leidi, E.O., Vidueira, J.M., Cobo, J., de Castro, A., Rodr√≠guez-Navarro, D.N., 2004. Nutrient Requirements of Ahipa, Tuberous-Root Crop. Journal of Plant Nutrition, 27, p. 931-945  Disease  Pachyrhizus ahipa plants are not very susceptible to pests. Nematodes such as Meloidogyne sp. can pose a serious problem. Further, some of the bean weevil species can be harmful. The most serious viral disease is the bean common mosaic virus (BCMV). Yields can be reduced up to 30% if infected by this virus. If a general irrigation management is lacking, rot is also likely to appear.  Harvest  The tubers of P. ahipa are harvested as soon as the tubers show a marketable weight, depending on consumer‚Äôs preferences. Mostly the preferred weight is minimally about 0.4 kg. Harvest duration lasts between 10 and 30 days. The vegetative top is often left on the field to later incorporate it into the fields. If the tubers are not needed at the moment, they can even be left in the soil until needed. Only the plant tops have to be cut off. The yields of the different organs are about 28-53 tonnes/ha for the tuberous roots, 18-36 tonnes/ha for the fruits, and 1.3-2.7 tonnes/ha for the dry seeds.  After harvest  The optimal storage temperature for tubers is 12.5 to 17.5 ¬∞C. Storage, though, changes the ratio of starch and sugar in the direction of sweeter tubers. This characteristic is valued by most consumers. Some farmers leave their tubers in a sunny place before marketing them. Due to a high moisture content, the tubers may shrivel and lose condition during storage and transportation. Another solution to shrivelling could be a thicker epidermis. It is important to avoid a damage to the tubers while harvesting. If damaged, they are susceptible to attacks by fungi, mainly by Rhizobus stolonifer, Cladosporium sp., and Penicillium sp. An attack of one of those fungi leads to textural changes, decay, and internal browning when stored at low temperatures and high relative humidity (>80%). Seed storage is problematic. Under humid conditions, germination rapidly decreases. This is challenging, because the climate in tropics is very humid in the rainy season.  Commercial aspects  Its sometimes dwarf-like habit makes P. ahipa well suited for large-scale commercial cultivation. No international trade in P. ahipa occurs.  Nutrition   Roots  The carbohydrate-rich roots can be eaten raw and provide calories and vitamin K and vitamin C, as well as potassium.Leidi, E.O., Sarmiento, R., Rodr√≠guez-Navarro, D.N., 2003. Ahipa (Pachyrhizus ahipa [Wedd.] Parodi): an alternative legume crop for sustainable production of starch, oil and protein. Industrial crops and products, an international journal, 17, p. 27-37 Normally, it is eaten fresh, almost like a fruit. In some raw cases, it is also prepared as a juice. The roots taste sweet and are crisp like an apple and are an attractive addition to green salads. They can be boiled and even after cooking, they retain their crunchy texture. Ahipa tubers are even considered to have a cleansing effect on the body. It is supposed to cure infections of the throat and the air passage. Its dry matter ranges from 15-30%. Further, the tuber contains 48-54% starch, which consists of 96-99.9% amylopectin. This is a very high value and especially interesting for food processing, where low solubilisation and retrogradation are important. Because of the high starch and amylopectin content, ahipa is a good material for the starch industry. Further, the suitability of the Andean bean depends on other factors such as extractability of the starch, the diameter of the starch granules or particles and their distribution. After nine months, the starch granules are very homogenously distributed in the tuber. There is a high percentage of granules, which show the same size of about 12-18 Œºm diameter. This indicates that the tuber growth is completed. P. ahipa can produce 19-28% sugars in its root. The protein content lies between 8 and 18%. The European market is economically highly interested in the protein content, mostly as feed for cattle. Protein content also may be interesting for the food industry, because about 80% of the protein is water-soluble and not extractable within a pH range of 2-10. The lipid content is very low, below 1%. Altogether, the tuber shows a very good nutritional composition. However, because the tuber contains a lot of water, the protein and energy concentration may be rated as being medium.  Seeds  The seeds of the Andean bean contain high protein concentrations. As an adaption to insect predators, ahipa plants accumulate canavanine in its seeds. This is highly toxic to some insects and can pose a big problem in livestock foraging, especially if the ahipa plants escaped into the wild vegetation. The oil of the seeds has special properties such as high palmitic acid and Œ≥-tocopherol concentrations, as well as few linolenic acids. These aspects are of interest in the food industry.  Breeding  Several breeding goals are important in P. ahipa, apart from it being used as a vegetable crop, a basic food crop, or a possible industrial crop. Those traits are mainly the reduction of the growth period and a reduced pod formation. This is especially important, if reproductive pruning could be avoided, saving time and money could be saved. Pachyrhizus ahipa plants must be propagated sexually, because the reproductive rate by cloning from tubers is very low. Propagation by seed is very advantageous, because transmission of viruses can be avoided and the storage of the propagation material is inexpensive. Several interspecific hybridization experiments have been conducted among all the Pachyrhizus species. The traits of the Andean bean, of most interest are tuber quality, growth habit, and early maturity. The results of the breeding between the different species showed especially good performing hybrid lines with regard to high tuber yield as well as wide adaptability. Nevertheless, negative secondary effects, such as reduced seed set and reduced germination rates, have been observed.  Prospects  Pachyrhizus ahipa should be used by a wider range of farmers for several reasons: * It shows a very good adaptability to climatic and edaphic ranges * The nutrients protein and starch are very well balanced, additionally, the taste is good * It shows good postharvest and storage characteristics * Nitrogen fixation, demand as fuel wood, and food production are favourable for the environment  References  Category:Phaseoleae Category:Root vegetables ","title":"Pachyrhizus ahipa"},{"id":"37888079","text":"Scopula haematophaga is a moth of the family Geometridae.

Parallel to this structure there are traditional courts dealing with minor matters and applying customary law. Lower Courts The Lower Courts are established by an act of Parliament and are bound by the four corners of legislation. There are several lower courts in Namibia. They are the magistrates' courts, the (labour) arbitration tribunals and the customary courts. Magistrates' courts deal with the most cases in the entire legal system. They are manned by magistrates who are employed by the Ministry of Justice. The decisions of magistrates' courts are written down; however, they are not recorded in any law report. The decisions have to be written in case either party to the proceedings feel prejudiced by the outcome and wants to go on appeal or review to the High Court. They are created by the Magistrates' Court Act no. 32 of 1944. The magistrates are governed by the Magistrates Act 3 of 2003.http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/namibia.htm#_The_Judiciary Arbitration tribunals are established by section 85 of the Labour Act No. 11 of 2007. Arbitration tribunals operate under the auspices of the Labour Commissioner. They deal with labour disputes, mainly arising from alleged contraventions of the Labour Act. The regional courts are the least used lower courts, and are slowly becoming obsolete. High Court The High Court is situated in the capital Windhoek but may, at the discretion of the Judge President, hold its sessions elsewhere in the country. The High Court building in downtown Windhoek was inaugurated in 1960 and is undergoing renovations and expansions. The High Court exercises original jurisdiction. It can act both as a court of appeal and a court of first instance over civil and criminal prosecutions and in cases concerning the interpretation, implementation and preservation of the Constitution. The High Court is presided over by the Judge-President. A full sitting of the High Court consists of the Judge- President and 6 other judges. Its jurisdiction with regard to appeals shall be determined by Acts of Parliament. Decisions of the High Court, which bind lower courts, are recorded both in Namibian and South African law reports. The decisions are recorded and summarized in the same way as Supreme Court decisions. The Labour Court is a division of the High Court. The Judge- President must assign suitable judges to the Labour Court, each of whom must be a judge or an acting judge of the High Court. Supreme Court The Supreme Court is the highest national forum of appeal. It has inherent jurisdiction over all legal matters in Namibia. It adjudicates, according to art 79 of the Constitution, appeals emanating from the High Court, including appeals which involve the interpretation, implementation and upholding of the Constitution and the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed therein. It also hears matters referred to it by the Attorney General or authorized by an Act of Parliament. As Namibia has a system of stare decisis, all decisions emanating from the Supreme Court are binding on all other courts unless they are reversed by an Act of Parliament or the Supreme Court itself. Decisions of the Supreme Court of Namibia are all recorded in the Namibian law reports and some in South African law reports. Traditional courts Community courts, which apply customary law, were created by the Community Courts Act 10 of 2003. Matters are decided by traditional leaders in the presence of the community. This road of dispute resolution has been formalised in acknowledgment of custom and culture, and to allow official access to some legal procedure for people who cannot afford to access the mainstream courts. Community courts may only adjudicate civil cases, and all parties must agree to be subject to it. Prior to the official recognition of traditional law in Namibia, these courts operated informally without recognition as part of the legal system. These developments are an extension of art 66 of the Constitution which holds that both the customary law and the common law of Namibia in force on the date of Independence shall remain valid to the extent to which such customary or common law does not conflict with this Constitution or any other statutory law. The courts have no reporting system, as the laws that they apply are very dynamic and may not be applied the same in any number of cases heard before them.

Helix Energy Solutions Group designed the Helix fast-response system based on techniques used to contain the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. On February 28, 2011 the drilling moratorium imposed as a result of the spill ended when the United States Department of the Interior approved the first drilling permit based on the availability of the HFRS to offshore oil companies. The HFRS relies on the deployment of Helix ESG's Q4000 multipurpose semisubmersible platform and the Helix Producer 1 floating production unit. Both vessels are based in the Gulf of Mexico and played significant roles in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill response. At full production capacity, the HFRS can handle up to 55,000 barrels of oil per day (70,000 barrels of liquid or 95 million standard cubic feet per day) at 10,000 psi in water depths to 10,000 feet.  Overview  When deployed, the HFRS is assembled in stages following an ROV inspection of the damaged subsea well head. ROVs then lower a custom-designed well cap onto the blowout preventer (BOP) stack; if the flow of escaping hydrocarbons is not too extreme, the vents inside the well cap can be manually closed one by one to shut in the well. If the pressure is too extreme to shut in the well, ROVs will lower an intervention riser system (IRS) onto the top of the well cap. The hydrocarbons will then be transferred through a marine riser to the Q4000, which will use its gas flare to burn off much of the oil and gas while transferring the rest through a flexible riser to the Helix Producer 1. The Helix Producer 1 will activate its flare to burn off the gas while it processes the oil and transfers it to a nearby oil tanker through another flexible riser. As the oil and gas is successfully captured, processed or burned and then transferred onto a tanker, drillships will be required to drill a relief well to permanently kill the damaged subsea well.  Developments  In January 2011 Helix ESG signed an agreement with Clean Gulf Associates, a non-profit industry group, to make the HFRS available for a two-year period to CGA member companies in the event of a future subsea well incident in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2012 Helix ESG said it was working develop an additional consortium for the Caribbean and would likely base the system out of Port of Spain Trinidad.

He lives and works in Valencia. His studies took place at the Polytechnic University of Valencia, UPV between 1991 and 1995, and at the School of Visual Arts in New York City during 2003. David Lopez Ribes is the winner of the Pontifical Academies Prize 2012 by Pope Benedict XVI, for his contribution to Christian Humanism on the contemporary.http://www.sydneycatholic.org/news/latest_news/2012/20121218_41.shtmlhttp://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/artist- praises-family-as-he-receives-vatican- award/http://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory.asp?number=122650http://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory.asp?number=122666  Overview  David Lopez¬¥s work is mainly pictorial, partly heir of informalism. However, as of the year 2000 he develops New Media (video, sculpture and installation). They are spiritual and transcendental works, which are clearly influenced by his personal life. Through painting, sculpture and video art projected onto real objects, he addresses issues such as: father, sacrifice, gift, transit and kingdom, in the content of his work and also has a constant preoccupation for using media as a means to dialogue with the secular man. Creating connections between Contemporary Culture and Faith. David Lopez Ribes video installations are designed to cause reflection on perception while at the same time reconsidering video as a medium in itself. They are images that want to be here with us out of the boundaries of the 'frame' and into real life images projected on real objects on the same action performed. They are multimedia installations that blur the boundary between the tangible and the transcendental. The nostalgia of harmony, the rejection of subjectivism, and liturgies of everyday life as an expression of moral integrity, are his cross-cutting themes. His work is present in public and private collections nationally and internationally. Bath 2012, Caceres David Lopez is awarded with the Young Art Prize 96 from IVAJ (Valencian Youth Institute) in 1997, and has held art exhibits in the Palau de la Musica (The Music Palace) in Valencia, in the House of Culture of Castell√≥n and Alicante¬¥s 14 Center, among others.

Originally published as a serial in Hamka's newspaper Pedoman Masjarakat, it follows a man from Banjarmasin who goes to Surabaya, becomes rich, but ultimately is driven to insanity. The novel has been seen as a critique of materialism, arrogance, and superstition. Plot Tuan Direktur presents a chronological plot, divided into twelve chapters. It follows Jazuli, who leaves his hometown of Banjarmasin to go to Surabaya in Java and become a gold merchant. He is quickly able to earn great wealth. However, this causes the once devout and humble Jazuli to become arrogant and materialistic. He calls himself \\"Tuan Direktur\\" and surrounds himself with sycophants Kadri, Margono, and Hajji Salmi. He tries to buy Jasin's land to build a factory, but is refused. Kadri uses Jazuli's belief in spirits to control him, manipulating his boss to fire numerous employees ‚Äì including Fauzi, who is able to become a successful businessman with Jasin's help. In an effort to eliminate Jasin, Kadri calls the police to the latter's house, claiming that Jasin is holding clandestine, anti-government meetings. When the police come, Jazuli, who has come to Jasin's house to try and buy the land, is arrested with a number of other people. After two days in holding, Jazuli is released but unable to enjoy his former arrogance, having been counselled by Jasin while in jail. When he sees Fauzi become a rich yet humble man, Jazuli is sent into a depression. He falls ill and does not recover, while Jasin and Fauzi live happily. Writing Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah, better known as simply Hamka, was the Sumatran- born son of a devout Muslim who viewed local traditions as hindering the progress of religion ‚Äì his father's opinions influenced his. After becoming a scholar of Islam, he travelled often, including to Java. Tuan Direktur reflected Hamka's Islamic worldview and was likely derived in part from his experiences while travelling. At the time Tuan Direktur was written, Surabaya was one of the richer cities in the Dutch East Indies, serving as both a port into the colony and as a stopping point for trade traffic headed to Australia. The city's wealth was decisively contrasted with the fate of the lower classes, who were not benefited by this trade. Writing for the Indonesian Department of Education and Culture, Putri Minerva Mutiara, Erli Yetti, and Veni Mulyani wrote that this may have influenced Hamka to set his story in the city. Themes Mutiara, Yetti, and Mulyani found that Tuan Direktur contrasted the arrogant Jazuli, referred to in the title as \\"Mr Director\\", with the more humble Jasin. Jasin spends more time praying as he becomes richer, and is willing to aid another man in entering business. His access to wealth, in their opinion, brings him closer to Allah. Thus, they surmise that the novel's moral is that an arrogant person will find sorrow, but one who is humble and prays to God will find happiness. Abdul Rahman Abdul Aziz, writing in 2009 on Hamka's Islamic interpretations, notes several aspects of Islamic teaching which are reflected in Tuan Direktur. He wrote that the novel reflected Islamic values of simplicity as a way to overcome lust, warning that, although hard work is necessary, one should not become focused on collecting wealth. Aziz, citing a passage where Jasin tells another man to sell an expensive shirt and use the money to buy shirts for less wealthy persons, further found that the novel reflected a concept of brotherhood; humans are meant to work together to overcome difficulty and not focus on their own needs. Likewise, material wealth should not be considered as important as a wealth of friends and acquaintances. A final point he identifies in the novel is that one living in the modern era should not hold superstitions. Release Tuan Direktur was first published as a serial (roman picisan) in Hamka's newspaper Pedoman Masjarakat before being picked up by the colony's state publisher, Balai Pustaka, in 1939. By 1998 it had seen four printings in Indonesia and a Malaysian translation. The Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw wrote that Tuan Direktur was an interesting book, but Hamka could not be considered a serious writer owing to the weak and overly moralistic psychology presented in his books.

It was transmitted in the form of 15-minute episodes on weekday afternoons with a repeat the following weekday morning. The programme came to a sudden end in May 1980 as part of a number of economies made by the BBC. History Waggoners' Walk was introduced as a successor to the long-running The Dales (1948-1969) which had been cancelled due to the illness of the lead actress Jessie Matthews. The programme was created by writers Jill Hyem and Alan Downer and has its origins in their Saturday Night Theatre production of The Ropewalk broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in January 1969. This play featured some of the same characters, actors and theme tune of Waggoners' Walk with the story centring on three women who share a flat in Hampstead. Waggoners' Walk was designed to move away from the \\"cosy\\" world of The Dales and feature \\"fast-moving stories\\" and have \\"few taboo subjects\\". During its run the storylines tackled issues such as illegitimacy, homosexuality, abortion, child custody and murder. The first edition was broadcast on the afternoon of 28 April 1969 with a repeat the following morning. Early editions were given a title, the first edition billed as Moving Pictures for instance, but this was dropped after just three weeks. Initially the programme had an audience of two million listeners but by 1974 was achieving four million. Most of the storylines involved the various tenants of No. 1 Waggoners' Walk, a large townhouse divided into several flats. Other settings included the local pub The Waggoners, the offices of the Hampstead Herald, Minden Road and the nearby Belsize Park. Hyem and Downer continued to produce scripts for the programme throughout its run and were joined by other writers including Peter Ling,http://www.bafta.org/heritage/in-memory- of/ling,171,BO.html Barbara Clegg and Terry James. The directors included Piers Plowright, who later became the programme's executive producer, David Spenser, Glyn Dearman, Anton Gill, David Johnston and Kay Patrick. In 1974 listeners were invited to submit their own plots in a Write Your Own Storyline Competition with the winning story submitted by Albert Kenyon broadcast in November 1974. In January 1980 a Sunday afternoon omnibus edition was added to the schedule, heard only on Radio 2's medium wave transmitters. As part of a series of cost-cutting initiatives by the BBC in 1980 Waggoners' Walk came to an abrupt end on 30 May 1980 with a cliffhanger ending in which George Underdown proposes marriage to Sophie Richmond and assures her that \\"you have all the time in the world\\" before the closing theme comes in. The Corporation received over 1,000 letters of protest about the ending of the programme, It rejected a request from Capital Radio to take it over. Cameo appearances A number of famous people made cameo appearances on the programme: * Jack de Manio in an edition in October 1969 * Pete Murray in the live 500th edition in April 1971 * Wilfrid Brambell and Harry H.

They are primarily known for writing screenplays for animated films, including Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who, Despicable Me, Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, Despicable Me 2, The Secret Life of Pets and Despicable Me 3. Life and career Paul was named after Cinco de Mayo, a celebration held on his birthday. After graduating from Yale University, Paul served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Tokyo. Shortly after returning from his mission he married his wife whom he had met at Yale and to whom he was engaged just before leaving on his mission. He then won a short film competition and received a fellowship at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, where he graduated in 1993 from the Graduate Screenwriting Program. Next year, he sold his first screenplay to Columbia Pictures. Daurio started making films with a Super 8 camera at age 9. After high school, he began directing music videos and directed more than 100 videos. Paul and Daurio have been collaborating since 1999. They met when Paul wrote a musical for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' 150-year celebration of the pioneers' arrival in Utah, in which Daurio had one of the leads. Hitting it off, having similar senses of humor, they formed a band called the Otter Pops, playing at local outdoor malls. Within a year they sold their first script, and a year later their second script, Bubble Boy, was made into a film, which was a critical and commercial failure. To get noticed, they used to sing story pitches to film producers. Although not always successful, this strategy resulted in several produced films, including Bubble Boy (2001) and College Road Trip (2008). They were personally chosen by Audrey Geisel, the widow of Dr. Seuss, to write a computer-animated feature film adaptation of Horton Hears a Who! for Blue Sky Studios via 20th Century Fox Animation, led by Chris Meledandri. In 2007, when Meledandri founded a film production company named Illumination Entertainment, Paul and Daurio followed him. At Illumination, they wrote screenplays for the highly-successful animated film Despicable Me and its sequel, Despicable Me 2. They also wrote for Illumination's other films, the live action/animated Easter-themed Hop and adapted another Dr. Seuss book into a computer-animated film, The Lorax. Although Paul and Daurio are screenwriting partners, they prefer to work independently. They divide up scenes and read pages to each other, trying to make each other laugh. Cinco, having an education in screenwriting, generally works on scenes that contain emotion and require the three-act structure, while Daurio, being more visually oriented person, usually does scenes with action, sight gags and physical comedy. Both being members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, their beliefs have had significant impact on their careers. They prefer \\"to write movies that are uplifting, optimistic and for everybody,\\" while avoiding being \\"preachy.\\" The pair adapted Bubble Boy into a stage musical featuring original songs, for which an original cast recording was released on Sh-K-Boom Records in 2017 produced by Paul, Justin Goldner & Kurt Deutsch. Paul and Daurio are also developing an original musical A.D. 16 centered around the relationship between teenage Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene.

Overview PHENIX is an exploratory experiment for the investigation of high energy collisions of heavy ions and protons, and is designed specifically to measure direct probes of the collisions such as electrons, muons, and photons. The primary goal of PHENIX is to discover and study a new state of matter called the quark‚Äìgluon plasma (QGP). Detecting and understanding the QGP allows us to understand better the universe in the moments after the Big Bang. The PHENIX Experiment consists of a collection of detectors, each of which perform a specific role in the measurement of the results of a heavy ion collision. The detectors are grouped into two central arms, which are capable of measuring a variety of particles including pions, protons, kaons, deuterons, photons, and electrons, and two muon arms which focus on the measurement of muon particles. There are also additional event characterization detectors that provide additional information about a collision, and a set of three huge magnets that bend the trajectories of the charged particles. These detectors work together in an advanced high-speed data acquisition system to collect information about the event and subsequently investigate properties of the QGP. The experiment consists of a collaboration of more than 400 scientists and engineers from across the world. The collaboration is led by a spokesperson, elected by members every three years, along with a team of deputies and other appointed members who oversee various aspects of operating the detector and managing the large group of scientist and institutions affiliated with it. Past and present spokespeople include Shoji Nagamiya (1992‚Äì1998), William Allen Zajc (1998‚Äì2006), and Barbara Jacak (2007‚Äì2012). The physics of PHENIX The PHENIX collaboration performs basic research with high energy collisions of heavy ions and protons. The primary mission of PHENIX is the following: *Search for a new state of matter called the quark‚Äìgluon plasma, which is believed to be the state of matter existing in the universe shortly after the Big Bang. PHENIX data suggest that a new form of matter has indeed been discovered, and that it behaves like a perfect fluid. PHENIX scientists are now working to study its properties. *Study matter under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure. *Learn where the proton gets its spin. *Study the most basic building blocks of nature and the forces that govern them. *Create a map of the Quantum Chromodynamics phase diagram.

Widespread in the Western Atlantic from North Carolina, United States, and northern Gulf of Mexico to southeastern Brazil. Absent from The Bahamas. Marine reef-associated tropical demersal fish, up to long. Its range under water can be between , but usually there are found deeper than 18m below the surface. This species was first seen in the Key West area near Florida, USA in 1874 and described by Frederic Ward Putnam. Description Cusk eels are not true eels. Unlike true eels, they have forked ventral fins: organs attached to the pectoral muscles just below the mouth. They do however, like eels, have an attenuate body and tend to have mouths in the terminal position with cardiform teeth.Froese, Rainer and Pauly, Daniel, eds. (2012). \\"Ophidion holbrookii\\" in FishBase. December 2012 version Though fairly small, the band cusk-eel has a complicated skeletal system. There are 20 ribs to allow for flexibility and 66-69 vertebrae along the spinal cord. This specific variation is a dull tan and lacks scales on the top of the head. The dorsal and anal fins are continuous with the caudal and lined in black. The body is fairly deep and number of rays, used to identify species, varies. The typical range is 117-132 dorsal rays, 97-109 anal, and 19-21 pectoral.The Band-dusk Eel, Animalia Life 2016-2017 http://animalia-life.club/fishes/band-cusk-eel.html Morphology In many species the swim bladder is hardened and used for an echo chamber to make sounds.

Both have a hardened swim bladder (suggesting that perhaps females use it for sound too) but males alone have a structure called a 'rocker'. All individuals possess a modified first vertebrae that makes a wing-like shape just above the swim bladder. However, in males there is a free floating bone that curves along a modification of the third through sixth vertebrae and attaches to the swim bladder. This is called a rocker but has not been seen in action so the function is unknown. In females this area is not modified and has two hollow protuberances coming directly off of the vertebrae.Anatomy and Sexual Dimorphism of the Swim Bladder and Vertebral Column in Ophidion Holbrooki (Pisces: Ophidiidae) Author: Rose, Jo Ann Source: Bulletin of Marine Science, Volume 11, Number 1, 1961, pp. 280-308(29)Publisher: University of Miami - Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science Habitat Cask eels tend to live in the bottom of shallow areas of water and take shelter in anything from caves to other invertebrates.

This burrowing has been caught on video in multiple species and occurs tail first, the fish backing up and down into soft sand or mud until covered.Video of cusk eel burrowing, https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL9SLkANZIEtWjLFbRbQtIfFLrW_FoZvcz&v;=KEEOrOp0C4M In soniferous species, a loud jackhammer-like sound is emitted by males for the attraction of a mate. They are thought to feed on small invertebrates such as shrimp or worms. Reproduction Male band cusk eels lack copulatory organs. As a result, eggs are externally fertilized and kept together in gel- like clumps. Which float near the surface. The juveniles are rarely seen except in two studies of multiple different dusk-eels variations. One study found larvae near the surface and traveling without sibling companionship.Development and Distribution of Cusk Eel Eggs and Larvae in the Middle Atlantic Bight with a Description of Ophidion robinsi n. sp.

It is found in the northwest Atlantic.  Description  The striped cusk-eel is named as such due to its lateral line, which stops before the base of the tail and has a noticeably different shade than the rest of its body, which is a gray-green shade. This species has an elongated, laterally compressed body with the profile of the head being almost straight from the tip of the moderately pointed snout to behind its eye. The snout just points beyond the mouth and has a spine projecting down near its tip. The male has a prominent crest on the nape. The dorsal and anal fins are joined to the caudal fin. the dorsal fin has 147-158rays, the anal fin 118-124 rays and the pelvic fins each have 2 rays of unequal length and inserted under eye. The scales are smooth and elongated, they do not overlap and there are none on the head. It is grey-green above, golden on the flanks and white below; there are 2-3 dark stripes along the entire length of the body with one along the lateral line. The side of head has brown spots, the dorsal is fin pale green with a black margin and the anal fin also has a black margin. It can grow up to long.  Distribution and habitat  The striped cusk eel occurs from the northern Atlantic waters off the United States, ranging from New England to northeastern Florida. Larvae occupy the continental shelf of the United States, while a mixture of larvae and juveniles have been reported to occur in estuaries from Barnegat to Chesapeake Bay. Biology The stripe cusk-eel is a benthic species which burrows tail first into soft substrates such as sand or mud. They remain hidden during the day and come out of their burrows at night to hunt. They occur in inshore waters in Spring and Fall but their wintering habits are little known, they may move offshore or they may be inactive and remain buried in the substrate. They feed on small crustaceans and fishes smaller than themselves. The swim bladder, anterior vertebrae and the dorsal cranial muscles have been modified to form a drum like sound generator, this is sexually dimorphic with the apparatus being different in each sex. Older juvenile and adult males show a lump on the head caused by hypertrophy of the muscles used to make the drumming sounds they use in courtship. Spawning for the striped cusk eel begins in the summer. Courting and spawning rituals include the creation of sound and close, synchronized movements from a breeding pair. Females can release small containers of eggs nightly for up to two months after the breeding process has finished.

As a son-in-law of its founding emperor Zhu Wen and as someone instrumental in the succession of its last emperor Zhu Zhen (Zhu Youzhen), he was influential during Zhu Zhen's reign and was traditionally blamed for corruption and misleading the emperor into making critical mistakes that caused Later Liang's fall at the hands of its rival Later Tang.  Background  It is not known when exactly Zhao Lin was born, but as he was described as being capable to command soldiers as of the time of his father Zhao Chou's resistance of the agrarian rebel army under Huang Chao while Zhao Chou was serving as the prefect of Chen Prefecture (Èô≥Â∑û, in modern Zhumadian, Henan) during Tang DynastyHistory of the Five Dynasties, vol. 14. in 883, he must have been born a number of years prior to 883.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255. He was Zhao Chou's second son, and during the resistance against Huang, he served under his father alongside his uncles Zhao Chang () and Zhao Xu (), and his older brother Zhao Lu (). As Zhu Quanzhong the military governor (Jiedushi) of nearby Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) aided Zhao Chou during both the resistance against Huang and later against another major rebel, Qin Zongquan, whose capital was nearby Cai Prefecture (Ëî°Â∑û, also in modern Zhumadian),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. Zhao became a vassal of Zhu's as Zhu's power grew, and they entered into a marriage alliance where Zhao Lin, who changed his name to Zhao Yan at some point, married Zhu's daughter (the later Princess Changle). Shortly after Qin was captured and executed by Tang in 889, Zhao Chou, who was by that point the military governor of Fengguo Circuit (Â•âÂúã, headquartered at Cai Prefecture), also died, and by his recommendation Zhao Chang succeeded him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. Nothing was recorded in history about Zhao Yan from this point on for more than a decade.  During Emperor Taizu's and Zhu Yougui's reigns  After Zhu Quanzhong seized the Tang throne in 907, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. Zhao Yan was given the ceremonial titles as minister of the guards (Ë°õÂ∞âÂçø, Weiwei Qing) and Fuma Duwei (ÈßôÈ¶¨ÈÉΩÂ∞â, a title reserved for princesses' husbands). In 908, he was briefly put in charge of Ming Prefecture (Ê¥∫Â∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei) before being recalled to serve in various command posts in the Later Liang imperial guard army. In 909, he was made the military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi) of Su Prefecture (ÂÆøÂ∑û, in modern Suzhou, Anhui), before being recalled to again serve in the imperial guard army. In 912, Emperor Taizu was assassinated at the capital Luoyang by his son Zhu Yougui the Prince of Ying, who then took the throne himself after blaming the assassination on his adoptive brother Zhu Youwen the Prince of Bo and putting Zhu Youwen to death. However, many officials suspected Zhu Yougui of being responsible, and shortly after Zhu Yougui's ascension, Zhao Yan entered into a plot with Emperor Taizu's nephew Yuan Xiangxian (a fellow commander in the imperial guards) and the major general Yang Shihou, as well as another son of Emperor Taizu's, Zhu Youzhen the Prince of Jun, to overthrow Zhu Yougui and support Zhu Youzhen as emperor. In spring 913, Yuan sent his soldiers into the palace and had Zhu Yougui surrounded, and Zhu Yougui committed suicide. Yuan and Zhao sent the imperial seal to the eastern capital Daliang, where Zhu Youzhen was at the time. Zhu Youzhen accepted and took the throne at Daliang, making it the capital.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268.  During Zhu Zhen's reign  Because of Zhao Yan's contribution to the succession of Zhu Youzhen (who later changed his name to Zhu Zhen), Zhu made him the director of material pricing (ÁßüÂ∫∏‰Ωø, Zuyongshi), as well as acting minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Hubu Shangshu). Because of his contributions and familial relationship to the emperor, Zhao Yan became arrogant and publicly received bribes and gifts, making him very wealthy. Admiring the example of the Tang Dynasty chancellor Du Cong, who was also the husband of a princess, he lived luxuriously. It was said that Zhu distrusted imperial officials and trusted only Zhao, as well as four men related to Zhu Zhen's wife Consort Zhang ‚Äî Consort Zhang's brothers Zhang Handing () and Zhang Hanjie () and cousins Zhang Hanlun () and Zhang Hanrong () ‚Äî and that their advice led him astray. For example, it was said that in 915, it was at the suggestion of Zhao and Shao Zan () that led Zhu Zhen to try to divide the powerful army of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan) in two, which led, disastrously for Later Liang, to the Tianxiong army revolting and surrendering the circuit to Later Liang's archrival Jin.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. In 917, it was at Zhao's suggestion that Zhu Zhen planned a grand ceremony near Luoyang to offer sacrifices to heaven and earth ‚Äî a traditional ceremony for emperors ‚Äî despite contrary advice by the chancellor Jing Xiang, who pointed out that the state could not afford the expenses of the ceremony and the required stipends to be paid to the soldiers attending the ceremony. (However, the ceremony was ultimately cancelled when (false) rumors came that Daliang had fallen to Jin forces, causing Zhu Zhen to cancel the ceremony and return to Daliang to quell the rumors.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. Other acts of Zhu Zhen's that Zhao was blamed for included the commission of the corrupt Li Qi as chancellor, as well as the commission of bandit-turned-general Wen Zhaotu () as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Kuangguo Circuit (Âå°Âúã, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan), whom he considered a friend.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. In 923, Later Liang and Later Tang ‚Äî i.e., Jin, as in 923 Li Cunxu the Prince of Jin declared himself emperor of Tang and his state was thereafter known as Later Tang ‚Äî forces were engaged in intense battles on and near the two states' borders on the Yellow River. After a devastating loss of Yun Prefecture (ÈÑÜÂ∑û, in modern Tai'an, Shandong) to a Later Tang surprise attack led by the Later Tang emperor's adoptive brother Li Siyuan, Zhu, at Jing's recommendation, commissioned the capable general Wang Yanzhang as the supreme commander of the Later Liang forces, and Wang was able to achieve some victories over Later Tang forces. However, as Wang was known to have despised Zhao and the Zhangs for their wrong advice to the emperor, Zhao and the Zhangs repeatedly defamed him and credited the victories to his deputy commander, Duan Ning. As a result, Zhu removed Wang and made Duan the supreme commander.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. Duan formulated an ambitious four-prong counterattack against Later Tang, with the main forces being put under the command of Duan himself and Du Yanqiu, to confront the Later Tang emperor himself in Tianxiong territory. The Later Tang emperor took the advice of the former Later Liang officer Kang Yanxiao and his chief of staff Guo Chongtao, crossed the Yellow River to rendezvous with Li Siyuan, and then engaged one of the weaker prongs of Duan's four-prong attack, which was under the command of Wang and Zhang Hanjie. He crushed Wang's and Zhang's army and captured then, and then directly headed for Daliang, which was left defenseless in Duan's attack plan. Zhu considered fleeing to Luoyang, but Zhao pointed out if he tried to flee, the imperial guards might mutiny, so he did not do so, but stayed at Daliang, futilely waiting for Duan to return to save him, but Duan was not able to. Meanwhile, despite his advice to the emperor, Zhao himself planned to flee. Believing that his friendship with Wen meant that Wen would shelter him, he fled to Kuangguo's capital Xu Prefecture (). (Shortly after Zhao fled, Zhu Zhen, with the Later Tang army approaching, committed suicide, ending Later Liang.) Wen initially welcomed Zhao warmly and hid him in the mansion, and then killed him, presenting his head to the Later Tang emperor.

His biographers consider him one of the most important heroes of Patagonia. Piedrabuena reached the naval rank of Naval Lieutenant Colonel, equivalent to Commander. Today he is commonly called Commander Piedrabuena.  Childhood  Luis Piedrabuena was born in the port of Carmen de Patagones, Buenos Aires Province, on 24 August 1833. He was born in a large colonial house with large bricks, window grilles and a Spanish-style tile roof. It was located at the foot of the ravine that was crowned by a fort in those days, and today by the parish church. From a very early age he was attracted by the sea. His childhood relationship with three seamen helped him to follow a life at sea. The first was Captain Lemon, an American whaler who sailed, while very young, between Patagones and Buenos Aires. The second was an old friend of his father, the captain and former privateer James Harris who put Luis up at his home in Buenos Aires, where he enrolled in a primary school and later attend a high school specializing in nautical subjects. Returning to Patagones, five years later, he continued to pilot boats and managed to build his own cutter. In 1847 another American whaler, John E. Davison, touched at Patagones. He was under Captain W. Smiley, who was leading an expedition in the South Atlantic. Luis's father entrusted him at the age of 15 to this sailor for seafaring instruction. He sailed with the whaler from Patagones on 23 July 1847, heading for the Antarctic. On that voyage he reached the latitude of 68¬∞ South, so Piedrabuena can be considered the first Argentine to have entered the Antarctic. The hardship of ocean voyaging in the cold and rough seas prepared him for the large enterprises in which he would participate in the future.  Chronology of his life at sea  Piedrabuena accompanied Captain W. Smiley's whaling and sealing expedition in 1848, picking up knowledge of sealing, and learning the geography of the straits and how to navigate in them. In 1848, with his own schooner, Piedrabuena touched at the Falkland Islands to load groceries and then continued to Cape Horn, reaching the Antarctic continent whaling grounds, and then returned to his hometown Carmen de Patagones. In 1849 Piedrabuena sailed from the port of Montevideo to Tierra del Fuego as an officer to supply the English missionaries. Offshore from Isla de los Estados (Staten Island) he rescued fourteen shipwrecked sailors. Piedrabuena displayed characteristic solidarity and courage as a seaman in the rescue. In 1850 he was first officer of the schooner \\"Zerabia\\", taking sheep and cattle to the Falkland Islands. He reached Antarctica again. He explored the Fuegian channels where he met Tehuelche people, in whom he tried to instill a sense of the Fatherland. In 1854 Piedrabuena again helped 24 sailors shipwrecked by a storm. In 1855, in command of the schooner \\"Manuelita\\" provided by Smiley, in Punta Ninfas he rescued the crew of the American whaling boat \\"Dolphin\\" from death. In 1859 he explored the Santa Cruz River and reached an island that he called Isla Pav√≥n, where he was assigned by the government to install a trading post. He also set up a post in Puerto Cook, Isla de los Estados, offshore from Tierra del Fuego. In 1860 he armed his own ship, the schooner \\"Nancy\\", to defend the territory and the southern coasts of Patagonia, while still saving lives. In 1862 he established a small shelter, San Juan de Salvamento, on the Isla de los Estados, as a refuge for shipwrecked sailors and to establish Argentine sovereignty. In 1863 he arrived in the Bay of San Gregorio in the Strait of Magellan, and befriended chief Bigu√°. He took him to Buenos Aires and got the authorities to designate him \\"Chief of San Gregorio\\". On 2 December 1864 the National Government gave him the title of \\"unpaid honorary captain\\" to defend Argentine sovereignty in Patagonia. Over the years Piedrabuena continued his work, sometimes abandoning his business to help castaways, and teaching the Aboriginals that they are children of Argentina whose sovereignty they must defend. He made many voyages on the coasts of Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego and Falklands. In 1868 the government awarded the first grants of land in the South, giving Pav√≥n and Los Estados Islands to Piedrabuena. That year he married Julia Dufour, who was to accompany him on several of his voyages. In 1873 a 650-ton Chilean corvette, the Abtao, arrived at the tiny settlement on Pav√≥n and tried to intimidate the settlers into leaving. Piedrabuena refused to yield. In March 1873, traveling with the schooner \\"Spore\\" to Isla de los Estados he was surprised by a terrible storm that drove the ship onto the rocks and wrecked it. From the remains of the ship with much difficulty he built the small cutter \\"Luisito\\", sailing it to Punta Arenas. From here he returned to Staten Island, saving the shipwrecked vessels \\"Eagle\\" and \\"Dr. Hanson\\". Germany recognized the act of courage and sent a magnificent telescope to Piedrabuena in a case whose plaque read: \\"We, William, by the Grace of God Emperor of Germany and King of Prussia: We consider this case a memento of gratitude to Captain D. Luis Piedrabuena of the Argentine ship \\"Luisito\\", for services rendered in the rescue of the crew of Dr. Hanson wrecked in October 1874.\\" On 17 April 1878 the government gives him the title of sergeant with the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1882, he participated with the \\"Cape Horn\\" in the scientific expedition to southern Patagonia of the Italian sailor Giacomo Bove. The journey lasted eight months, and used the isla de los Estados, which the government had granted to Piedrabuena, as the main observation center. On 8 November 1882 Julio Argentino Roca, President of Argentine, gave him the effective rank of lieutenant colonel in the Navy. Personal life On 2 August 1868 he married Julia Dufour, who accompanied him on several of his voyages. She was the daughter of a Frenchman who served in the Rio de la Plata. That same year, in October, they both departed on a long voyage to the Patagonian seas, during which they visited Isla de los Estados where they landed in the shelter that the Commander had built in 1862 for those who were shipwrecked in those lonely shores. A few days later they arrived at the Pav√≥n island, at the time owned by Piedrabuena. The couple had five children: Luis, Ana, Maria Celestina and Julia Elvira and another son also named Luis, born after the death of his brother of the same name and of Julia Elvira. Julia Dufour died on 6 August 1878 in Buenos Aires, while her husband was at sea. She had helped him and shared his ideals, and was the first white woman to land in Santa Cruz Province. The settlement of Julia Dufour in Santa Cruz province is named in her honor. Commander Luis Piedrabuena died on 10 August 1883 at 2045 hours in 50 Tucum√°n Street in Buenos Aires. According to Admiral Laurio Destefani \\"wordless pain hit the men of the Navy: the greatest sailor of all sailors was gone.\\" Bartolom√© Mitre writing in La Naci√≥n said: \\"The passion of his life was to guarantee the country's vast territories of southern Argentina ... for a long time it was defended only by his small ship.\\" Luis Piedrabuena is buried in La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires. The town of Comandante Luis Piedrabuena is named in his honor. An avenue and a housing complex in the impoverished neighborhood of Villa Lugano in the Capital District of Buenos Aires were also named after him. Some of the streets within the housing complex were named after the ships he commanded. As an ambassador 'sui generis' he was given only verbal instructions, and was paid by honors and awards that cost nothing. His name appears in only four official decrees. He wrote several reports submitted to the National Government, and established friendly relations with the tribes of Patagonia, in whom he tried in various ways to instill the feeling of nationality. In many forays into the South Seas he saved hundreds of shipwrecks for which he was the subject of honors and awards by the European Government. The Government of his country prized his meritorious services, awarded him the rank of Captain and later Honorary Lieutenant Colonel of the Navy, and put him in command of the Corvette \\"Cabo de Hornos\\".

When he first ran for district judge in 1994, Devine was unopposed in the Republican primary, and narrowly won the general election, unseating Democratic incumbent, Eileen F. O'Neill, 289,943 (50.5 percent) to 284,246 (49.5 percent). Devine was re-elected to a second term on the district court bench in 1998, with 261,514 votes (52.8 percent), defeating Democrat Jane Fraser, who polled 233,597 (47.2 percent).

The American Institute of Architects' guide to Atlanta architecture states that they are one of the best examples of garden apartment in Atlanta: > Two structures perpendicular to North Highland Avenue, frame a hansomely > landscaped courtyard with Mediterranean-style shrubbery. An Italianate > flavor is further enhanced by the tiles of the boldly projecting decorative > roofs and the stucco of the attic, pierced with smaller openings than the > two floors below Furthermore, the AIA notes the complex's eponymous overscaled white columns which contrast prominently against the red brick background. It characterizes some elements as prescient of postmodern architecture, such as the broken pediments enhancing the raised doorways and the brick and terra-cotta frame of the square openings.

It is considered to be of architectural importance and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The school was originally built as a charitable orphanage and school, known as the Ripley Hospital, and was intended particularly for children whose fathers had been lost at sea. It was paid for from the legacy of Thomas Ripley, a merchant who died in 1852, to build such a school along the lines of the Bluecoat School in Liverpool. The building was commissioned by Ripley's widow, Julia. The foundation stone was laid on 14 July 1856, and the building was completed eight years later, being opened on 3 November 1864 by the Rt Revd James Prince Lee, Bishop of Manchester. Julia Ripley died in 1881, having set up a trust to pay for extensions to the school, which included a chapel. The chapel was designed by the local architects Paley and Austin in 1884‚Äì85, and built in 1886‚Äì88. It was opened and dedicated by the Bishop of Liverpool on 3 November 1888. Architecture Exterior The chapel stands to the east of the school buildings, and is approached by an arcaded walkway. It is constructed in sandstone. On the exterior this is formed into polygonal blocks to match the other school buildings. The stone on the exterior is said to be local, while that on the interior is said to be from Storeton, (then in Cheshire). The chapel is roofed with Westmorland slate, and is in Gothic Revival style. Its plan consists of a nave and chancel under a continuous roof, a south aisle, a north vestry and organ chamber at the east end acting as a transept, and a northwest porch. At the junction of the nave and the chancel is an octagonal fl√®che. This has an open timber bell stage with a balcony, and contains a single bell; it is surmounted by a weathervane. On the north side of the church, between the nave and the chancel, is a projecting stair turret. This has a flat top, and a parapet decorated with chequerwork. The tracery in the windows is in a fusion of Decorated and Perpendicular styles. Interior The chapel is the size of a parish church, seating 400 people. At the west end is a narthex, divided from the body of the church by an oak screen. The interior is asymmetrical, with a three-bay south arcade between the nave and the aisle. In the transept, the vestry is at the lower level, with the organ above. The furnishings were designed by C. Blades, and carved by John Jackson. The choir stalls are particularly elaborate, with traceried canopies, and the seats have finials in the shape of lollipops. The oak pulpit stands on a sandstone base, and the pews are also in oak. The east and west windows contain stained glass by Shrigley and Hunt. In the narthex are white marble busts of Thomas and Julia Ripley, and brasses to their memory. The three-manual pipe organ was built in 1888 by Wilkinson and Sons of Kendal, and was overhauled in 1988 by Corkhill of Keighley.

An Israeli Border Guard with a M201-Z PTU officer with a M201-Z The Federal Riot Gun (FRG) is a firearm made by Federal Laboratories Inc., designed to fire non-lethal munitions. Its ammunition includes 37 and 38mm baton and tear gas rounds. The baton rounds were cylindrical, rubber projectiles. The most popular model, 37-mm M201-Z, has a distinctive ringed barrel. History Introduced in the 1930s by Federal Laboratories Inc., of Pennsylvania, the FRG became the standard riot gun used by the British Army throughout The Troubles in Northern Ireland. A single-shot weapon, which breaks open by unlocking a catch at the top, it has since been replaced in British use by the multiple-shot ARWEN 37 revolver. It was also issued by the Canadian Army, subsequently the Canadian Armed Forces.Canadian Military Police Virtual Museum. The Canadian Provost Corps, 1946 - 1968. Weapons: Federal Tear Gas Riot Gun Non-lethal design Fired at a relatively low velocity, the baton rounds are intended to knock rioters down, or momentarily stun them, but not to cause serious injury or death. Field experience Safe operating procedures in the British Army eventually ruled out firing the gun directly at rioters, as it was found that the rounds could cause serious and permanent injuries. In 1993, a constable of the Bermuda Police Service, acting the role of enemy for a rifle company of the Bermuda Regiment, being exercised at Camp Lejeune USMC Base, was seriously injured by a baton round fired from a soldier's FRG, shattering his jaw, which required extensive surgery to reconstruct. Subsequently, orders were given that the weapons were to be fired into the ground ahead of rioters. The baton rounds would deflect upwards into the rioters, but would lose kinetic energy in the process.

In the early days, his passport occupation read \\"purveyor of good times\\" and he went on to be nicknamed by music Mixmag as the \\"King Of Clubs\\". With his Leeds based club night Back To Basics, Beer features as one of the youngest men in Leeds City Museum‚Äôs exhibition chronicling the popular culture of Leeds. Early life Dave Beer was born in Pontefract, West Yorkshire and grew up in a single parent family on a council estate in Pontefract. He attended Carlton High School as a teenager but left at the age of 16 looking for a new challenge. He found solace in art and went on to study at Wakefield Arts College where he met his best friend and, later, fellow Back To Basics promoter, Alistair Cooke. The pair wanted to make films and be in a band and went on to study multi-media, film and TV at Sheffield University. As a youth, Beer was a rebellious punk; he dyed his hair red, wore a kilt and listened to punk anthems like \\"White Riot\\" and \\"God Save the Queen\\". He followed bands like The Clash and The Cure across the country and once got into a gig, climbing in through a dressing room window, too young to get past the bouncers on the door. Career Roadie and tour manager Beer's obsession with the punk- music scene saw him become a groupie, hitching up with punk band The Clash. As a keen photographer, he captured many exclusive shots of the bands he followed incorporating them into art projects at college. His persistence on the tour circuit led to his first proper role as a roadie and later as tour manager for bands including That Petrol Emotion, The Ramones, Ghost Dance, The Utah Saints, and The Sisters of Mercy who he lived with at the time. During a spell with Stourbridge noisemeisters, Pop Will Eat Itself, Beer found himself working on the 1987 Def Jam tour that included Public Enemy, LL Cool J and Run-D.M.C., but life as a tour manager would soon takes its toll. Beer travelled the world several times over with numerous bands before he became fed up with life on the road. It was the birth of acid house in 1988 that sent Beer on a new tangent entirely. He visited the Ha√ßienda and the famed illegal warehouse parties in Blackburn getting his first taste of acid house, but when the Criminal Justice Act hit in 1991, outlawing parties in disused libraries and warehouses; Beer drew inspiration in the new music scene that was taking over and wanted to be part of it. Back to Basics promoter Beer faced the post-warehouse party world with the DIY ethos of a punk and Back To Basics was born on 23 November 1991, named literally to represent what the club set out to do. Beer and Alistair grew tired of the acid house scene and wanted to put on parties> where alternative music to the rave scene was played. Through Back To Basics, they made clubbing fashionable, and throughout the 1990s it was one of the most desirable places to go, causing road blocks in Leeds city centre. At the time, Back to Basics had a strict, sometimes controversial and inconsistent door policy which made it one of the hardest clubs to get into. Beer personally greeted all 80 clubbers on the opening night and those who were refused entry due to their dummy sucking or poor choice of trainers were encouraged to try harder next time. Its opening night was held on the top floor of The Chocolate Factory, which was later renamed, The Music Factory. Weeks two and three of Back To Basics saw the crowds double in size until it was attracting 1,000 clubbers every week. By Nov 1992 at the end of its first year, Dave and Alistair found themselves on stage at the Royal Albert Hall, looking out to a packed auditorium as they picked up the DMC and Mixmag Award for Best Club. Over the next 20 years from 1991 to the present day, Beer toured Back To Basics all over the world from Australia to the USA and held club residencies at Home London, and Space Ibiza. He was responsible for nurturing the talent of Daft Punk, Basement Jaxx and Groove Armada giving them some of their first gigs as unknown artists. Beer was also responsible for bringing international talent into the UK for the first time including Danny Tenaglia, Josh Wink and Frankie Knuckles. Back To Basics holds numerous awards from the music and events industry and has gained worldwide recognition thanks to its forward thinking music policy and loyal following. Today it is considered a \\"household name\\" in UK clubbing and Beer continues to be \\"the life and soul\\" of the Basics party. In 2017, Beer was approached by Leeds City Council to host a special Back To Basics classical event in Leeds' Millennium Square on 27 July, in conjunction with Opera North. The event, named The Symphonic Sounds of Back To Basics was held in celebration of the brands cultural and economical contributions to the city and Beer was also honoured as a son of Leeds. The event that was held annually for three consecutive years saw the likes of Corinne Bailey Rae, Basement Jaxx, Groove Armada, Robert Owens, Adamski, Robin S, Alison Limerick and Saffron from Republica join Beer on stage with Opera North's 50 piece orchestra. The event was covered by several local news channels including BBC Look North and The Yorkshire Evening Post DJ Over the years, Beer has DJ‚Äôed to millions of people all over the world at the Berlin Love Parade alongside Radio 1 DJs Sara Cox and Pete Tong; at Creamfields, Glastonbury, Bestival and at Homelands where in 1999 he was flown in by helicopter to play to 40,000 people. Today he remains resident DJ at Back To Basics. On the UK club scene, he has been a regular at the Chuff Chuff parties, his own big beat night, Backbeat; Renaissance, Gatecrasher, and at London superclub's Ministry Of Sound, The Cross, Turnmills, Heaven, and at The Elbow Rooms in Leeds where he was a resident DJ and musical consultant for several years. In Ibiza, his first gig was on the sunset strip at Caf√© del Mar, and he has gone on to play at many more clubs on the island including Caf√© Mambo, Manumission, Privilege, Pacha and Space. Producer Beer's career as a music producer began when he teamed up with his Basics‚Äô partner Alistair Cooke for their debut single Keep The Faith, which was released under the alias The God Squad in 1993 on Junk Rock Records. Many releases followed for Beer including I am Miami (You‚Äôre Looking At Him), produced under the alias Out of Order with Kriss Needs, released in July 1998 on Creation Records offshoot, Eruption Records. It gained interest from the music press including the NME and Muzik Magazine. Featuring the vocals from Stefan Frank and engineered by Dave Hedger, Beer described it as, \\"Just an off the wall track. I was always into that early electro Hip Hop sound. So it was a chance to get away from house music and mix things up a bit\\". The music video featured a cameo of one of the biggest producers around at the time, Arthur Baker who drove an open top Cadillac in one of the scenes. Beer's remixing history includes re-rubs for David Bowie, The Rolling Stones, Afrika Bambaataa and Intastella. Throughout time, his production has been a varied reflection of his diverse musical influences. Musician Further developments in Beer's career have come in the formation of The Blessed - an eclectic live musical collaboration between him and techno producer Gareth Whitehead, head of Bulletdodge Records. The Blessed draws influences from Beer's punk ethos and from a collection of house, funk, new wave and electro. The band - which features guest musicians up to as many as eight musicians on stage at one time including singers, guitarists, percussionists and brass players - debuted at the o2 Academy Leeds on Thursday 1 April 2010 as the support act for Fatboy Slim. With the incorporation of live visuals, the gig showcased young break-dancers connected with the Mums Against Guns campaign. House music producer Robert Owens also played with The Blessed that night. The name The Blessed derives from the idea that one must count one's blessings in life, and that life is for the living and must be lived to the full by everybody regardless of creed, colour or social status before it is too late. This idealism, regardless of one's relativist position, is the lifeblood of The Blessed's music and is their political message to bring people together. Label boss Beer turned his hand to label management in 1995 and set up Back To Basics Recordings with co-promoter and producer, Ralph Lawson, and Michael Hirst. The label issued some of the biggest selling compilations of the 1990s including Cut The Crap in 1996 ‚Äì a three disc box set mixed by Ralph Lawson, Derrick Carter and the only commercially available DJ mix by Andrew Weatherall. It was listed by DJ Magazine at number 38 in a list of 100 Best Dance Compilations Ever, and to this day is still considered to be \\"the DJs‚Äô DJ\\" compilation. Published in 2002 as part of the Back To Basics 10 year celebrations, the label released Back To Basics Presents Danny Tenaglia on React Records, the labels‚Äô biggest selling compilation of the time. Designer During the 1990s and in light of his expressive fashion sense, Beer launched his own fashion label named Damage. The collection featured men and women's T-shirts made in quality fabrics, all boasting provocative motifs and slogans, which some say pioneered the way for the T-shirt slogan boom that followed in the late nineties. Fashion title Drapers caught onto the label and featured it as a One To Watch as did men's style magazine GQ. The range was later seen on the backs of celebrities such as Sienna Miller, Jude Law and Lily Allen. Artist =Back To Basics' flyers= Beer has been the creative mind behind the Back To Basics club flyers since the night first began. Over the years, they have featured tongue-in-cheek, controversial imagery, many of which were heavily influenced by the punk explosion of the 1970s. The most famous of all Basics‚Äô flyers is a piece of customised iconography of the Sex Pistols God Save The Queen album cover embossed with the Back To Basics punk slogan: Two Steps Further Than Any Other Fucker. The artist behind the original images, Jamie Reid gave Beer his blessing to adopt his work. He grew a close relationship with Beer and went on to showcase some of his own art at Back To Basics in late 1992. The Back To Basics adaption has gone on to become an iconic example of club art and its culture. Back To Basics changed the way clubs flyered their nights, adding edge and personality through the use of controversial slogans and random imagery. The Back To Basics‚Äô flyers made their way into a number of books including Highflyers ‚Äì Club Rave Party Art, Fly ‚Äì The Art Of The Club Flyer, Once In A Lifetime ‚Äì The Crazy Days Of Acid House & Afterwards, Jam: Style + Music + Media and Adventures In Wonderland: Decade of Club Culture. The flyers were hung as artwork in Selfridges in London, at the Barbican Art Gallery, and a lot went under the hammer at \\"Sotheby's\\". In 2012, a selection of limited prints based on the flyer artwork were exhibited at the Leeds Art Gallery and at Harvey Nichols in Leeds' city centre. =Popular culture= Beer has regularly used his influence and the popularity of Back To Basics to get involved in work outside of clubland, giving talks on popular culture to college and university students. At the MiNT Club in Leeds on 16 June 1999, he delivered a speech at an event called Arthrob in conjunction with The Arts Council of England alongside readings from novelist Irvine Welsh, Miranda Sawyer, and Biyi Bandele. Over the years, Beer and Welsh grew close, and Irvine became a regular at Back To Basics, regularly sleeping on Beer's sofa. Beer also staged a Back To Basics and Northern Talent Production in association with Yorkshire Arts called Millennium or Bust. The night was an audience with Irvine Welsh, Howard Marks, Wayne Hemingway, and Beer himself, held at the Leeds University conference auditorium on 9 December 1999. Beer also became close friends with author and filmmaker Howard Marks, who DJed at the Back To Basics 20th Birthday in November 2011. More recently, alongside him, Marks has narrated a documentary exploring the life and tales of Back To Basics, titled Tales Of Glamour & Excess. The pair teamed up in the showcase of Howard's life stories ‚Äì a series of stand-up shows - that included a bizarre PowerPoint presentation featuring demonic images to the backing track of Sympathy For The Devil, remixed by Beer. The event was staged to promote Howard's new book and first fictional tale, which shares its name with The Rolling Stones‚Äô song. Marks mentions Beer in his second autobiography Se√±ior Nice. Furthering his involvement in events outside of clubland, Beer DJ'ed at the Royal Ballet in Covent Garden where he was booked to create a music programme for a pre-choreographed performance. VJ Charles Kriel provided the visuals for this same event. Media At the height of Back To Basics‚Äô success, the UK media cottoned onto Beer's larger than life personality. His hedonistic tales became regular content in the likes of DJ Mag, NME, The Face and Mixmag, the latter of which included Beer in its Royal Family feature in 1998 - a double page spread profiling the greatest and most influential people in dance music of the time. The feature ran in celebration of the magazine's 200th issue. A few years earlier in 1993, Beer appeared on the cover of NME's November/December issue with the Manic Street Preachers. Television In June 1999, Beer took to the Channel 4 airwaves to take part in Nightlife Legends, a six-part series of late-night chat shows looking at the clubbing scene. Even the BBC could not ignore the impact that Beer and Back To Basics were having on clubland, and not just in the UK, but on a global scale. On Basics‚Äô 18th Birthday in November 2009, BBC Look North headed down to Stinky's Peephouse in Leeds to interview him about the success of his club night. On 1 March that following year, the BBC went into more depth looking at the history of Back To Basics in a documentary featured on Inside Out in which Basics was referred to as a \\"national treasure\\" and \\"the stuff of legends\\".

He also had his own Back To Basics radio show on Galaxy FM (now Capital) and made regular appearances on Kiss FM London and Kiss FM Leeds. Literature Beer's party lifestyle, influence on the music scene and as an iconic figure in Leeds has been well documented throughout music literature. He speaks candidly about his Ha√ßienda days in Superstar DJs Here We Go!, offers opinion to Mick McCann's encyclopedic book of Leeds and its achievements in How Leeds Changed The World, and appears as himself in the music industry fictional tale Kill Your Friends. In October 2003, a unique biography of Primal Scream was published ‚Äì The Scream: The Music, Myths and Misbehaviour of Primal Scream written by the band's tour DJ, Kris Needs. In this book, Needs draws comparisons between the bands‚Äô front man Bobby Gillespie and Beer. Needs wrote, \\"Some of my closest friends in the clubbing community are Dave Beer and the city‚Äôs notorious Back To Basics Crew. If Clubland has a Primal Scream equivalent, it‚Äôs Dave Beer\\". At Primal Scream's Screamadelica Live Tour event on 14 March 2011 at the o2 Leeds Academy, Bobby Gillespie dedicated the show to his pal who was there in the crowd. Charity work Throughout Beer's life, his social conscience has always played part in the activities he has supported. In March 2002, he orchestrated Back To Basics‚Äô involvement in World DJ Day ‚Äì the largest global fundraising activity the dance music industry had been involved in. A week of activities was held to raise funds for the Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy charity for needy children across the world. He held an event with DJ Jo Mills on 9 March 2002 to raise money for the charity. Also in March 2002, Beer threw his weight behind the Greenpeace Ancient Forest Campaign. The Save or Delete initiative invited clubbers to show their concern about the destruction of the world's oldest forests by filling in vote-cards handed out at clubs across the UK. On 23 March as part of this weekend of conscious clubbing, he turned Back To Basics into a polling booth in support of the campaign. He continues his charity work lending his support to Strummerville ‚Äì a charity set up by the family and friends of Joe Strummer in the year after his death; giving support to aspiring musicians and aid to projects that help change the world through music. He also took part in a sky dive to raise money for child disability charity PhysCap, with his friend Adam Warner who suffers with cerebral palsy. Adam is a regular attendee at Back To Basics. Personal life On 12 March 1993, an accident nearly took Beer's life. Whilst travelling to a Basics gig in Glasgow, he was involved in a road collision with an articulated lorry on the A66 outside Carlisle where tragically, his best friend and fellow Basics promoter Alistair Cooke was killed. Almost two decades on, he had another near-death experience, one which served as something of an epiphany when he contracted pneumonia.

A counterclockwise movement of water in the Northern hemispheres is cyclonic, but the same counterclockwise movement is anticyclonic in the Southern hemisphere (Yasuda, 2000). Although eddies have large amounts of kinetic energy, their rotation is relatively quick to diminish in relation to the amount of viscous friction in water. They typically last for a few weeks to a year. The nature of eddies are such that the center of the eddy, the outer swirling ring, and the surrounding waters are well stratified and all maintain their distinct properties throughout the eddy‚Äôs short time-scale.The Ring Group. 1981. Gulf Stream cold-core rings: their physics, chemistry and biology. Science, Vol. 212;1091-1100.  Formation  The governing forces of an eddy are very dependent on its size. Small eddies are largely governed by viscosity and direction of a water body. However larger eddies are formed from a balance between the horizontal pressure gradient force, arising from differences in densities of the meeting water masses, and the Coriolis force.Mittelstaedt, E. 1987. Cyclonic cold-core eddy in the eastern North Atlantic. I. Physical description. Marine Ecology Process Series, Vol. 39; 145-152. Due to the turbulent nature of the earth‚Äôs oceans, eddies can be found almost everywhere. Mesoscale eddies are usually seen in areas of intense, winding currents such as the Gulf Stream and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current that feeds into the South Pacific and Indian oceans, but in general can be caused by a combination of factors such as cooling of sea surface temperature, convection, direct generation from wind, or water flow past an irregular coastline. Cycolic cold-core eddies are frequently formed at the polar front by the Gulf Stream and Labrador Current. The cold, nutrient-rich waters from the Labrador Sea flow south and get caught in the eastward meandering of the Gulf Stream, traveling east across the Atlantic Ocean.  Physics, Chemistry, and Biology  All eddies are capable of transporting energy, momentum, heat, physical and chemical water properties, and even small organisms across very large distances. Since eddies mix waters with different properties, they act as an exchange of nutrients from the continental shelf to the deeper ocean as they travel. This makes them ideal hot spots for primary productivity, especially in areas of low nutrients, such as the center of open ocean gyres. The importance of these swirling masses lies in the incredible amount of kinetic energy they are able to transport both horizontally and vertically, their participation in air-sea interaction, and the irreversible mixing of water masses. These processes all contribute to the transfer of nutrients, oxygen, and trace chemicals, ocean stratification and density fields, and patterns of warmth that drive atmospheric and oceanic circulation.  Permanent and Semi-permanent Cold-core Rings  Semi-permanent and permanent eddies are also recognized in relative abundance throughout the world. These are eddies that form in the same location on a regular seasonal or systematic basis, and typically have the same trajectory.Crawford, W. and P. Greisman. 1987. Investigation of permanent eddies in Dixon Entrance, British Columbia, Continental Shelf Research, Vol. 7; 851-870t. Some permanent eddies are regular enough to be given names within the ocean current system such as the warm-core Kuroshio Ring off Japan and the cold-core Agulhas Ring off the tip of South Africa. Western boundary currents like the Agulhas, Brazil, and East Australian Currents are known for shedding eddies downward off their end points.Pichevin, T., D. Nof, and J. Lutjeharms. 1999. Why Are There Agulhas Rings? Journal of Physical Oceanography; 693-707. A semi-permanent cold-core eddy is periodically formed by the Loop Current in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, where warm water from the South Equatorial Current travels upwards through the south Caribbean ocean and flows into the Loop Current off the coast of Cancun.Biggs, D. C., and R. A. Zimmerman. 1997. Note on plankton and cold-core rings in the Gulf of Mexico. Fisheries Bulletin. Vol. 95, No. 2.

Canadian Journal of Archaeology, No. 3, pp. 211-228. Canadian Archaeological Association. Background Hidden Falls is located an elevation of 39 meters or 128 feet, south of Kelp Bay on Baranof Island, opposite Sitka, in Alaska. The site was first discovered by the U.S. Forest Service personnel with initial excavations occurring in 1979. Radiocarbon dating was conducted and demonstrated that people were living in Hidden Falls 10,000 years ago.Butler, V. L., and Campbell, S. K., (2004). Resource Intensification and Resource Depression in the Pacific Northwest of North America: A Zooarchaeological Review. Vol. 18, No. 4, pp. 341-342. Journal of World Prehistory. There is evidence that the occupants of Hidden Falls produced stone tools that were associated with marine resources; the occupants relied on the ocean for their subsistence and transportation [6].Yesner, D. R., (1998). Origins and Development of Maritime Adaptations in the Northwest Pacific Region of North America: a Zooarchaeological Perspective. Arctic Anthropology, Vol. 35, No. 1, North Pacific and Bering Sea Maritime Societies: the Archaeology of Prehistoric and Early Historic Coastal Peoples (1998), pp. 204-222. University of Wisconsin. This site also produced evidence of different types of stone tools, which were categorized into three components, some of these included microblades and cobble stone tools Excavation and key findings The Hidden Falls site was excavated by Stanley D. Davis in 1979 after the discovery of the site by the U.S. Forest Service. Artifacts found in the site strata included: shell and faunal remains, slate knives, points, labrets, jade tools, bone tools, chipped stone, and drilled tooth pendants. The site consisted of three components. The first was characterized by microblades, unifacial tools and microcores dating to about 9,500 years ago.Moss, M.L., Erlandson, J.M., Stuckenrath, R. (1989). The Antiquity of Tlingit Settlement on Admiralty Island, Southeast Alaska. American Antiquity, Vol. 54, No. 3, pp. 534. Society for American Archaeology. The second component was dated between 4600‚Äì3200 years ago and the third to ca. 3000‚Äì1300 years ago. The latter two components consisted of ground and slate tools The deposits included shell midden and fire cracked debris. The upper levels did not appear to be true shell middens, since they only contained roughly 15-20% shell midden volume. The rainwater and groundwater at this site has been sufficient to create a uniform midden level, which aids in preservation of artifacts such as bone. Artifacts and technology The artifacts discovered in the deepest levels are associated with the Archaic period (ca. 10,500-4,400 B.C.); these consisted of microblade techniques and cobble stone tools, including gravers and scrapers The origins of these stone tools are believed to have come from Siberia Cook, J.P., (1995). Characterization and Distribution of Obsidian in Alaska. Arctic Anthropology, Vol. 32, No. 1, pp. 92-100. University of Wisconsin Press. and became popular throughout Alaska. Dating was conducted on different strata deposits and it suggested that the stone tools were found to date approximately 9500 B.C. The excavation yielded different artifacts which contained utilized and non-utilized flakes, scrapers, microcores and pebble choppers. These artifacts were radiocarbon dated at 9860 ¬± 75. Many of these tools were primarily used for cutting, serrating, or hunting, such as the pebble chopper. The pebble chopper consisted of a rounded stone that was repeatedly hit with another stone to create a serrated crest that was used to chop subsistence resources or used as a crude hunting tool. The microblade was a tradition used by people that were likely specialized in fishing and sea hunting. Microblades eventually disappear and a new set of tools began to emerge in the upper levels. These tools consisted of grounding stones and along with these tools came decorative artifacts, such as pendants, shells, beads, and labrets. Life at Hidden Falls Hunting Due to the fact that Hidden Falls is located on an island, the only way to proceed onto this location is from a boat. Also, due to its location, it is assumed that the inhabitants of the island relied heavily on the ocean and it production of marine resources. Artifact assemblages at this site are interpreted as resulting from the exploitation of marine resources. Although hunting terrestrial game most likely did occur, it was not the main food source. Subsistence The location of Hidden Falls suggests that many of its inhabitants relied on marine resources. Parts of toggling harpoons and some barbed bone points were found and are suggestive that sea mammal hunting occurred. Shellfish and traces of whale remains were found, although whale hunting was probably not as reliable and not practiced as often. However, there is not enough evidence to provide an accurate record of the daily or regular consumption of the site's occupants. Only minimal fish bones have been recovered at the site, and it is uncertain how much of the site occupants depended on them.

There were signs of a struggle in which Gilford had been stabbed thirteen times, though the ultimate cause of her death was ascertained to have been asphyxiation by her own bed pillow. Within the next week, Parry and McLauchlan were arrested on suspicion of murder after allegedly using Gilford's bank card to make a series of withdrawals totalling approximately $1,000.  Trial and sentencing  Several days after their arrest, Parry eventually confessed to having been in a relationship with Gilford, and that she had attacked her (albeit without intent to kill) following an argument. McLauchlan agreed that her account of events was true, though by the time of the trial both had unsuccessfully attempted to withdraw the confession, claiming that they had been intimidated, deprived of sleep and subjected to threats of sexual violence in order to coerce them into signing it.BBC News Prior to the trial, the lawyers for the two nurses discovered similarities between Gilford's death and the 1994 murder of Liberty de Guzman, another nurse at the same complex, but that case was judged to not be relevant to the trial.The Independent The actual trial was relatively swift, in large part due to the confession that the two nurses had signed. There was no cross-examination of the two witnesses, nor any witnesses or forensic evidence. McLauchlan was found guilty of manslaughter and was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment and 500 lashes. Parry's sentencing was more complicated, as she was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death, but could be commuted to a life sentence if the closest surviving relative of the victim were to accept a \\"blood money\\" payment as allowed under the Islamic law of Diyya. Gilford's closest surviving relative was her brother Frank, who initially refused the notion of accepting any such payment, though eventually accepted a payment worth around ¬£750,000, which was funded primarily by British Aerospace and philanthropist/publisher Felix Dennis. Frank subsequently donated the entire payment to a children's charity. While Parry had been saved from the death penalty, there were still many questions about the overall fairness of the trial, and in March 1998, Prime Minister Tony Blair personally appealed to King Fahd during a state visit to resolve the situation. Finally, on 20 May 1998, Fahd commuted the sentences of both women to 17 months in prison - the time that they had already served - with the only conditions being that both were to write him a letter personally thanking him for his clemency, and then accept deportation back to the United Kingdom.BBC News  Aftermath  Following her return to the UK, McLauchlan married her fianc√© Grant Ferrie. She subsequently asked to meet Frank to personally apologise for calling him a \\"greedy, selfish bastard\\" for accepting the blood money, but Frank refused the offer and said that he did not ever want to meet either of the two nurses.BBC News She was subsequently struck off the nursing register for her actions in using false references to obtain her job in Saudi Arabia. In 2011 she was convicted of credit card fraud for a second time,Daily Record before being convicted of theft in May 2012. On both occasions, her solicitor said she had been \\"mentally scarred\\" by her experience in the Saudi prison. McLauchlan died on 7 January 2014, aged 48, at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, Scotland after suffering a brain haemorrhage at her house two days previously.Daily Record: Saudi murder case nurse Lucille McLauchlan dies after suffering brain haemorrhage at her home Parry resumed her nursing career upon her return to the UK, being re-employed at one of her former jobs at Holy Cross Hospital in Haslemere, despite an attempt by MP George Galloway to have her struck off.The Telegraph She continued to maintain that she was not a lesbian and had not been in a relationship with Yvonne Gilford and had no involvement whatsoever with the murder, and in 2012 called for Gilford's body to be exhumed and subjected to forensic techniques that were not available at the time of her death. The case attracted much attention in the UK and Australia owing to the fact it would have been the first execution of a western woman by Saudi Arabia. Other factors were the British media's reporting over the case and the political pressures that prompted Fahd to release the nurses.The Independent The case was mentioned in Desert Royal, a memoir of a Saudi princess written by Jean Sasson.

Self-taught in the art of fly tying, Stevens invented the Grey Ghost Streamer, an imitation of the Smelt, Osmerus mordax. Stevens' flies received national and international acclaim, and she was honored after her death with the naming of August 15, 1970 as \\"Carrie Gertrude Stevens Day\\" by the Governor of Maine.Hilyard (2000) Life Carrie Gertrude Wills was born to Albert and Nellie Wills on February 22, 1882 in Vienna, Maine. She was the youngest of six.Hilyard (2000), pp.3-5 Leaving Vienna, Carrie met Wallace Clinton Stevens in Mexico, Maine, and the two married on May 1, 1905 in West Farmington. By 1919 they had moved to Upper Dam, where Wallace established himself as a fishing guide. Carrie worked as a milliner. There, through contact with her husband's clientele, Stevens was introduced to flies tied in the English style and began to experiment herself. On July 1, 1924 Stevens landed a 6-pound 13 ounce brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis, that won her recognition in the Field & Stream magazine.Field & Stream (Feb 1992), p.56 Her patterns were recognized and promoted by fly tying contests throughout New England, and two issues of Field & Stream focusing on her fly tie patterns and skill as a fisherman promoted her patterns nationally.Hilyard (2000), pp.6-7 Stevens began to receive orders for her flies from throughout the United States, \\"and soon I was in the fly business.\\"Hilyard (2000), pp.20-21 Stevens' patterns were later, sometimes incorrectly, attributed to Charles Edward \\"Shang\\" Wheeler (1872-1949), a Connecticut state representative and senator, or to Connecticut Judge Charles H. Welles; both men recognized and promoted her patterns, and tied flies themselves. Stevens attributed her initial interest in flies to Wheeler and named some after him, writing to friend Joseph D. Bates, \\"It is doubtful if I would ever have made a fly if Mr. Wheeler had not sent us one to try out in the pool in 1920.\\" Responding to claims that he and not Stevens had been responsible for the famous fly patterns, Wheeler later described how Stevens had skillfully developed his ties with materials such as \\"rooster's hackle, deer hair, tinsel, or blue heron's feathers,\\" remarkably improving their performance. Stevens became not only an astute fly tier, but also entrepreneur and saleswoman. According to Pamela Bates, \\"Carrie had the ability to know exactly what the sports would bite for - regardless of the preferences of the fish.\\"Hilyard (2000), p.xii Her fly tying business peaked after the Second World War, but due to poor health, Stevens became less active and officially retired in 1963. Stevens died on August 3, 1970.Hilyard (2000), p.29 After her death, Maine Governor Kenneth M. Curtis declared August 15, 1970 to be \\"Carrie Gertrude Stevens Day.\\" Stevens remains the only fly tier to have been recognized by the state in Maine.Hilyard (2000), p.xi Fly ties Stevens innovated fly tying design by shortening streamers to extend only slightly beyond hooks, and by using longer hook shanks.Hilyard (2000), pp.95-100 She furthermore brought fly profiles closer to those of baitfish by tying materials parallel to the hook, and used fly shoulders to imitate bait fish gill plates. While patterns similar to the Grey Ghost existed prior to Stevens' work, she pioneered the streamer by using new colors, structure, and less exotic materials, making it more effective and accessible.Hilyard (2000), pp.xiii-xiv Her hooks were principally supplied by S. Allcock & Company Ltd. of Redditch, England, and her feathers supplied by George Fletcher of Rangeley, Maine. Brook trout chasing an artificial fly.Gill (1903) Stevens' fly early fly ties were numbered rather than named, a practice common in the 19th Century. But as her popularity grew, Stevens began to name her patterns as well. Early patterns from the late 1920s and early 1930s included the Rangeley Favorite, the Stevens Favorite, the Pirate, the Green Beauty, and the Wizard. Patterns from the later 1930s include the Shang's special, the Golden Witch, the Blue Devil, the Gray Ghost, the Witch, the Greyhound, the Happy Garrison, the White Devil, and the Don's Delight. During the 1930s, 49% of all record fish taken from the Upper Dam were caught with Stevens' flies. During the 1940s and 1950s, most American fly tiers making streamers attempted to imitate proportions invented by Stevens.Hellekson (2005), pp.383-384 Other flies created by Stevens include the Colonel Bates, named after her friend Robert D. Bates Jr., the Will Ketch, and the General MacArthur. Stevens' popular Colonel Bates fly was originally named the Captain Bates, its name changing as Bates was promoted in rank during his career in the United States Army.Hilyard (2000), p.71 Following the success of her husband while using her flies for trolling, a rare or unheard- of practice at the time, Stevens' flies became used for trolling throughout North America. Her flies were purchased by fishermen in Alaska, Oregon, Newfoundland and New Brunswick, New Zealand and Patagonia.Hilyard, p.22 Legacy In his series on American streamer Patterns, Colonel Robert Bates included 14 patterns tied by Carrie Stevens; other sources suggest she may have invented as many as one hundred.Hilyard (2000), p.xv The Gray Ghost remains one of the most popular fly ties used in trout and salmon fishing, and has been modified into many forms.Walberg (2003), p.158 Carrie Stevens is the subject of a book written by Graydon R.

In addition to documentary sequences, the film also uses CGI animation, models and performers to stage real and imagined moments in the history of fruit. Film subjects Subjects in the film include actor Bill Pullman, who was not featured in Gollner's book. The filmmakers became aware of his interest in fruit thanks to a 2009 New York Times profile. The film follows Pullman's efforts to develop a communal orchard near his Hollywood Hills residence. Two staff members of Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden are shown exploring jungles in Asia and South America in search of plants to graft and preserve. The Fruit Hunters also features a Honduran scientist trying to find an alternative to the Cavendish banana, an Italian cultivator who studies Renaissance paintings to identify new varieties, and an indigenous guide in Borneo. Development and production The idea for The Fruit Hunters was first pitched at a forum at Hot Docs, utilizing footage with Bill Pullman.

On 29 July 1833, in Westmoreland Street, Dublin, Nathaniel Sneyd was shot in the head by a madman, John Mason, who had a grudge against the firm of wine merchants Sneyd, French and Barton, where Sneyd was senior partner. Sneyd died of his wounds two days later.The Manchester Guardian, \\"Domestic\\", 3 August 1833.

Discoveries as early as 1904 provide evidence that native peoples settled here [6], burials, structural remains, and artifacts such as points, tools, and bones of discarded food [3].  Geography  Port au Choix is located on the northwestern coast of the island of Newfoundland, the farthest eastern border of Canada. It protrudes from the island as a peninsula with another peninsula extending northeast from that. This unique geography provides a large amount of coastline for a small area making it excellent as a port city.  History  The island of Newfoundland has an abundance of resources for hunter-gatherer peoples [10]. For thousands of years it was occupied by a variety of native people. Maritime Archaic Indians were the first people to occupy the island of Newfoundland. A Maritime Archaic Indian cemetery dates as far back as 4400 B.P. [4] was found in 1967 by James Tuck, of Memorial University of Newfoundland, who excavated 56 graves, determined to be between 4400 and 3300 years old [3]. This discovery prompted Port au Choix to be designated a National Historic Site in 1970 [6]. No structural remains were found near the burial sites, leading archaeologists to assume the natives buried their dead far from their settlements [3]. In fact, there are no Maritime Archaic Indian dwelling sites yet discovered on Newfoundland [9]. Due to post-glacial sea level rise, there are potentially many Maritime Archaic Indian dwelling sites submerged in the ocean[9]. Sea level has risen approximately thirteen feet in the last 4400 years since the Port au Choix burial site was first used [13]. In contrast, there have been many discoveries of Dorset Paleo-Eskimo dwellings on Newfoundland, which have been radiocarbon dated to between 1990 and 1180 years B.P. [4]. After the Maritime Archaic Indians left the region, the Paleo-Eskimos began to expand their settlements further south into Newfoundland. The Dorset Paleo-Eskimo people relied heavily on maritime resources, especially seals, for subsistence [11]. The Dorset people occupied Port au Choix for approximately seven hundred years, constructing many dwellings. At the site of Phillip's Garden, one of the richest archaeological sites on Port au Choix, there are 50 documented structural remains. It is thought these were wooden peaked roofed structures with hides over the top [8]. Today, these ruins are characterized by depressions in the ground as well as architectural elements of low walls, a central cooking area, and a platform to the rear of the house [8]. Excavation of these remains became known as the Port au Choix Archaeological Project, which began in 1984 and continues today [8]. It is believed that the Dorset Paleo-Eskimos abandoned Port au Choix due to global warming of that time period, approximately 1200 B.P. [11]. This was a result of changing temperatures pushing the harp seals away from Port au Choix. This was due to the changing food resources for harp seals. They were a crucial part of the Dorset diet [11]. After the departure of the Dorset Paleo-Eskimos, a group of people known as the Recent Indians moved into Port au Choix [14]. Little is known about this group. The Beothuk people had contact with European settlers as early as 1713. They, unfortunately, became extinct as a population by 1829. That ended the nearly five thousand years of native inhabitation of Port au Choix [10].  Phillip‚Äôs Garden One significant site of Dorset Paleo-Eskimo remains are located on the Port au Choix peninsula in the region known as Phillip's Garden. This archaeological dig has been divided into three sites, Phillip's Garden, Phillip's Garden East, and Phillip's Garden West. The Phillip's Garden sites are regarded as the most important discoveries in the Port au Choix area since the remains of structures were preserved from rising sea levels [8]. There have been discoveries of dwellings by Dorset Paleo- Eskimos dating back to approximately 2140 B.P. [8]. The first excavation of Phillip's Garden was William Wintemberg of the National Museum of Canada in 1929. At this time he discovered numerous sites of Newfoundland's Great North Peninsula, including Port au Choix. Phillip's Garden was the largest site found during the survey [6]. Phillip's Garden remained unexamined after its initial discovery by Wintemberg until 1949, when Elmer Harp Jr. began to excavate at Port au Choix and made many discoveries through the early 1960s. Harp, a distinguished archaeologist who specialized in the Arctic and Paleo- Eskimos, was the first to determine that some remains and artifacts discovered at Port au Choix were those of Paleo-Eskimos, not Indians [12].  Artifacts  A variety of tools, pottery, and other artifacts have been discovered at Port au Choix. Along with human remains, artifacts were discovered in the burial sites. Tools such as woodworking implements were found in the graves. It is believed these were designed for building structures and watercraft [3]. Phillip's Garden produced a wealth of ancient tools used by its former inhabitants. Along with 50 house dwelling sites, thousands of individual artifacts have been discovered by excavators in the last half century [14]. Since both the Maritime Archaic Indians and Dorset Paleo-Eskimos were very dependent on the sea for sustenance [1], there is a lot of evidence showing evidence of seal hunting at this location [5]. Archaeologists M.A.P. Renouf and Trevor Bell studied the hunting and harvesting of harp seals by the Dorset Paleo-Eskimos at Phillip's Garden. They concluded that the Dorset people utilized the animals fully. Their meat was used for food, their fat for fuel, and their skin for making clothes and boots by the Dorset people [4].  Management  Port au Choix is a National Historic Site of Canada. The site is managed by a combination of native descendants, land owners, and Canada Parks staff as well as local community members [14].  References  # Renouf, M. A.

He is primarily a vocalist and pianist, and is often credited by the Francis and the Lights name for his solo work. He is a frequent collaborator of multiple artists and producers, including Kanye West, Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, Benny Blanco, Cashmere Cat, Chance the Rapper, Nico Segal, Frank Ocean and Banks. Biography Early life and education Starlite was born Abe Morre Katz-Milder on 14 June 1981 in Oakland, California. He was raised in Berkeley, California, and attended Berkeley High School, where he befriended future collaborators and Francis and the Lights members Rene Solomon and Jake Schreier. In 1999, Starlite enrolled at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. Starlite befriended future Francis and the Lights collaborator Jake Rabinbach while a student at Wesleyan. Starlite attended Wesleyan from 1999 before ultimately dropping out in 2002. While there, Starlite and Rabinach were schoolmates of MGMT's members Andrew VanWyngarden and Benjamin Goldwasser, whom they have since toured with. Francis and the Lights Starlite began traveling across the United States by train in an effort to find what direction he was going to take his life. While on a train traveling from Elkhart, Indiana to New Orleans, Starlite came to the decision that he was going to pursue his passion for music as a career path. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 2010, he said, \\"I had played music and loved it my entire life, but hadn‚Äôt fully committed to it. And there was a moment when I wrote down the different things I could do. And then I wrote down, 'I think I‚Äôll give the band a go.'\\" Shortly afterwards, Starlite returned to his birthplace of Oakland, California, where he lived and worked in a rehearsal space at Soundwave Studios and wrote songs for close to a year. He subsequently drove across the U.S. in a decommissioned postal truck to New York City, where he then formed Francis and the Lights. The band rehearsed for an entire year before starting to perform through a series of invitation-only shows at a white fabric-draped warehouse space. On 3 November 2008, Starlite incorporated Francis and the Lights, LLC, as a limited liability company, as an alternative to signing a record deal. This was followed by an investment of $100,000 from the Normative Music Company, giving Francis and the Lights, LLC a valuation of $1 million. Normative's president, Jake Lodwick, a friend of Starlite and a co-founder of Vimeo, said, \\"Francis Starlite is an uncompromising musician and a strong leader. I believe he will bring Francis and the Lights to international stardom. The spectacular live shows, beautiful recordings, and his relentless character back me up.\\" In late 2009, Normative Music Company shut down. The duo have since collaborated on the music app Keezy.https://vimeo.com/80036953 Francis and the Lights have released four EPs and two albums, including Farewell, Starlite! (2016) and Just for Us (2017). They provided the soundtrack for the film Robot & Frank (2012), directed by friend and collaborator Jake Schreier. Schreier has performed as part of Francis and the Lights, producing some of their work and directing a majority of their music videos. Starlite works closely with Muxtape founder Justin Ouellette, who has designed several websites and HTML5 music players for Francis and the Lights releases.https://jstn.tumblr.com/post/150959998236 Ouellette previously worked as engineer for Vimeo alongside Lodwick. He also met Schreier through Starlite and served as a designer for Robot & Frank.https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/one-on-one-justin-ouellette- designer-of-interfaces-for-robot-frank/ Production career Starlite rose to prominence after producing and co-writing the song \\"Karaoke\\" for Canadian rapper Drake from his 2010 debut album Thank Me Later. His recent production work is primarily through credits with other producers such as Benny Blanco, Cashmere Cat, Rostam Batmanglij, Ariel Rechtshaid, and Ryan Tedder. He is the inventor of a layered vocal effect he refers to as the 'Prismizer.' It features prominently on many of his productions, including \\"Close to You\\" by Frank Ocean and throughout Coloring Book by Chance the Rapper. Justin Vernon sought to create a real-time solution capable of implementing the effect without latency for use in live performance and on his Bon Iver album 22, A Million. The result was a combination of hardware and software nicknamed 'The Messina' after audio engineer Chris Messina.https://www.wmagazine.com/story/the-engineer-behind-bon- ivers-22-a-million-clears-up-any-confusion-about-its-high-tech-sound Starlite worked with Kanye West on his 2018 albums ye and Kids See Ghosts. Starlite is credited as a writer and producer on ye's \\"I Thought About Killing You,\\" and as a producer on \\"All Mine,\\" and \\"Ghost Town\\". On Kids See Ghosts, Starlite is credited as a producer on \\"Feel the Love.\\" Personal life Starlite legally changed his name to Francis Farewell Starlite in 2004. When asked in an interview with Entertainment Weekly why he had changed his name, he answered: > Let me think about how I want to answer that question. Let me think for a > moment. [One minute passes] It‚Äôs very difficult because I‚Äôm very proud of > the fact that I changed my name. It has meaning to me.

The first Russian forces arrived in Abkhazia on June 23 the same year and numbered about 1,600 people at the time of the shooting. Perpetrator Artur Vaganov () was an ethnic Russian from Bashkiria. He did two years of compulsory service in a reconnaissance battalion of the Totskoye Division, rising to the rank of staff sergeant and becoming second-in-command of a platoon. After a year back in civilian life he voluntarily enlisted to join the peacekeeping forces in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. The Volga Military District's 27th Peacekeeping Division, the platoon of which Vaganov was deputy leader, arrived in Abkhazia on April 15, 1997 and entered upon their peacekeeping duties at post 203 two days later. Vaganov was generally given positive references regarding his service and was described by a UN military observer and a spokesman of the Russian peacekeeping forces as a very demanding and efficient soldier with high standards, who neither drank, nor smoked, though also as someone who was \\"psychologically not suited to the job.\\"The Current Digest of the Post-Soviet Press, Vol. 49, Iss. 14-30; American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies, 1997.

During this period, the country underwent an economic and social transformation as a result of industrialisation, which was reflected in new architectural forms, techniques and scale of building. In the second half of the eighteenth century, Edinburgh was the focus of a classically inspired building boom that reflected the growing wealth and confidence of the capital. Housing often took the form of horizontally divided tenement flats. Some of the leading European architects during this period were Scottish, including Robert Adam and William Chambers. While urban centres were rebuilt in local materials, including Aberdeen in granite and Glasgow in red sandstone, the homes of the rural poor remained basic, particularly in the Highlands. In the cities they were confined to the sprawl of suburban tenements like those of the Gorbals in Glasgow. One response to growing population was the creation of planned new towns, like those at Inverary and New Lanark. The nineteenth century also was the revival of the Scots Baronial style, pioneered at Walter Scott's Abbotsford House and confirmed in popularity by Queen Victoria's residence at Balmoral Castle. There was also a revival of Gothic styles in church architecture. Neo-classicism continued to be a major movement in the works of architects including William Henry Playfair and Alexander \\"Greek\\" Thomson. The later part of the century also saw some of the most important architectural products of new engineering, including the iconic Forth Bridge. Late eighteenth century Neo- classicism Plan for the New Town, Edinburgh by James Craig (1768) During the Industrial Revolution, Scotland became one of the commercial and industrial centres of the British Empire.T. A. Lee, Seekers of Truth: the Scottish Founders of Modern Public Accountancy (Bingley: Emerald Group, 2006), , pp. 23‚Äì4. From the mid-eighteenth century this growing wealth and confidence was reflected in a classically inspired building boom focused on Edinburgh's New Town. It was laid out according to a plan of rectangular blocks with open squares, drawn up by James Craig (1739‚Äì95) and built in strong Craigleith sandstone which could be precisely cut by masons.P. Wilson, \\"A modern material\\", in P. Wilson, ed., Building with Scottish Stone (Edinburgh: Arcamedia, 2005), , p. 5. Most residences were built as tenement flats, divided horizontally, with different occupants sharing a common staircase, in contrast to the houses used in contemporaneous building in England. The smallest might have only one room; the largest, several bedrooms and drawing rooms.R. W. Brunskill, Houses and Cottages of Britain (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2nd edn., 2000), , pp. 234‚Äì5. Common features of neo- classical building included columns, temple fronts, rounded arches, flanking wings and domes.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , p. 153.C. Strickland and A. Handy, The Annotated Arch: A Crash Course in the History of Architecture (Andrews McMeel, 2001), p. 100. This classicism, together with its reputation as a major centre of the Enlightenment, resulted in the city being nicknamed \\"The Athens of the North\\". The gridiron plan, building forms and the architectural detailing would be copied by many smaller towns, although rendered in locally quarried materials.I. Maxwell, A History of Scotland‚Äôs Masonry Construction in P. Wilson, ed., Building with Scottish Stone (Edinburgh: Arcamedia, 2005), , p. 27. Despite this building boom, the centralisation of much of the government administration, including the king's works, in London, meant that a number of Scottish architects spent most of their careers in England, where they had a major impact on Georgian architecture.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , p. 73. Robert Adam (1728‚Äì92) emerged as leader of the first phase of the neo-classical revival in England and Scotland from around 1760 until his death.N. Pevsner, An Outline of European Architecture (London: Pelican, 2nd Edition, 1951), p. 237. He rejected the elaborate Palladian style that had dominated building as \\"ponderous\\" and \\"disgustful\\".M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , p. 106. However, he continued their tradition of drawing inspiration directly from classical antiquity, influenced by his four-year stay in Europe, where he saw the excavations at Pompeii and Herculaneum, which for the first time allowed modern Europeans to see classical buildings first hand, rather than work from literary descriptions. Neo-classicism strived for greater simplicity, often more influenced by Greek rather than Roman models. Adam's major works in Edinburgh included the General Register House (1774‚Äì92), the University Building (1789) and Charlotte Square (1791).S. Bietoletti, Neoclassicism and Romanticism (Sterling, 2009), , p. 36. He also designed 36 country houses in Scotland. An interior designer as well as an architect, together with his brothers John (1721‚Äì92) and James (1732‚Äì94) developing the Adam style, he influenced the development of architecture, not just in Britain, but in Western Europe, North America and in Russia, where his patterns were taken by Scottish architect Charles Cameron (1745‚Äì1812).Adam Silver (HMSO/Victoria & Albert Museum, London, 1953), p. 1. Adam's main rival was William Chambers (1723‚Äì96), another Scot, but born in Sweden.J. Harris and M. Snodin, Sir William Chambers Architect to George III (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1996), , p. 11. He did most of his work in London, with a small number of houses in Scotland. He was appointed architectural tutor to the Prince of Wales, later George III, and in 1766, with Robert Adam, as Architect to the King.D. Watkin, The Architect King: George III and the Culture of the Enlightenment (Royal Collection Publications, 2004), p. 15. More international in outlook than Adam, he combined Neo-classicism and Palladian conventions and his influence was mediated through his large number of pupils.P. Rogers, The Eighteenth Century (London: Taylor and Francis, 1978), , p. 217. The classical influence also reached church architecture. Scots-born architect James Gibbs (1682‚Äì1754) introduced a consciously antique style in his rebuilding of St Martin-in-the- Fields, London, with a massive, steepled portico and rectangular, side-aisled plan. Similar patterns in Scotland can be seen at St Andrew's in the Square, Glasgow (1737‚Äì59), designed by Allan Dreghorn (1706‚Äì64) and built by the master mason Mungo Nasmyth. Gibbs' own design for St. Nicholas West, Aberdeen (1752‚Äì55), had the same rectangular plan, with a nave-and-aisles, barrel- vaulted layout with superimposed pedimented front.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), , p. 143.

Whatley, ed., A History of Everyday Life in Scotland, 1600 to 1800 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), , pp. 55‚Äì6. Often built by groups of friends and family, the homes of the rural poor were usually of very simple construction. Contemporaries noted that cottages in the Highlands and Islands tended to be cruder, with single rooms, slit windows and earthen floors, often shared by a large family. In contrast many Lowland cottages had distinct rooms and chambers, were clad with plaster or paint and even had glazed windows. In the early 1800s urban settings also included traditional thatched houses, beside the larger, stone and slate roofed town houses of merchants and urban gentry. The Industrial Revolution transformed the scale of Scottish towns, making Glasgow the \\"second city of the Empire\\",J. F.

Clark, The Struggle for the Breeches: Gender and the Making of the British Working Class (University of California Press, 1997), , p. 18. Between 1780 and 1830 three middle class \\"new towns\\" were laid out on grid-iron plans, similar to those in Edinburgh, to the south and west of the old town.A. Middleton, \\"Glasgow's East End\\", in D. V. Donnison and A. Middleton, Regenerating the Inner City: Glasgow's Experience (London: Routledge, 1987), , pp. 19‚Äì20. The other side of increasing wealth and planned architecture for the aristocracy and middle classes was the growth of urban sprawl. In Glasgow the growing workforce was left to the mercy of market forces as suburban tenements were thrown up, particularly to the east of the city, like those of the Gorbals to the south, where overcrowding, lack of sanitation and general poverty contributed to disease, crime, and very low life expediency.P. Fry, P. S. Fry and F. S. Fry, The History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 1990), , pp. 203‚Äì4. Urban centres increasing made use of locally mined stone. While Edinburgh made extensive use of yellow sandstone, the commercial centre and tenements of Glasgow were built in distinctive red sandstone. After a major fire in the largely wooden Aberdeen in the 1740s, the city fathers decreed that major buildings should be in the locally abundant granite. This began a new phase in large-scale quarrying and led to the \\"granite city\\" becoming the centre of a major industry, which supplied Scotland and England with faced stone, pavement slabs and pillars.G. Coyle, The Riches Beneath Our Feet: How Mining Shaped Britain (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), . New towns New Lanark, cotton mills and housing for workers, founded in 1786 and developed by Robert Owen from 1800 The sometimes utopian concept of the new town, aimed at improving society through the foundation of architecturally designed communities, was an important part of Scottish thinking from the mid-eighteenth to the twentieth century. In addition to the New Town of Edinburgh these included the complete rebuilding of Inverary for John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll by John Adam (1721‚Äì92) and Robert Mylne (1733‚Äì1811), between 1772 and 1800.M. Gardiner, Modern Scottish Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , p. 164. Helensburgh near Glasgow was laid out in 1776 on a grid-iron plan.R. Taylor, M. Cox and I. Dickins, eds, Britain's Planning Heritage: A Regional Guide (London:Routledge, 1975), , p. 200. Small new towns on a gridiron plan in the period 1770‚Äì1830 included Cuminestown, New Pitsligo, Tomintoul and Aberchirder.C.

Whatley, A History of Everyday Life in Scotland, 1600 to 1800 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), , p. 72. At Fochabers, from 1776 John Baxter redesigned the village on a grid plan, with a central square focused on Bellie Church (1795‚Äì97), still following in the tradition of Gibbs, with a tetrastyle portico and steeple.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), , p. 181. From 1800, Robert Owen's New Lanark, designed as a self-contained community, combining industry with ordered and improved living conditions, was an important milestone in the historical development of urban planning.A. Alexander, Britain's New Towns: Garden Cities to Sustainable Communities (London: Taylor & Francis, 2009), , p. 55. Housing was combined with generous communal and living spaces, a children's school and community education centre. It also introduced a village store that supplied good at lower prices and became the model for the co- operative movement.P. Sanders, S. Satherley and K. Shibata, \\"Built environment, design and ethics: the social responsibility of educational institutions\\" in E. Felton, O. Zelenko and S. Vaughan, eds, Design and Ethics: Reflections on Practice (London: Routledge, 2013), , p. 146. Scotland also produced one of the major figures in urban planning in sociologist Patrick Geddes (1854‚Äì1932), who developed the concept of conurbation, and discarded the idea of \\"sweeping clearances\\" to remove existing housing and the imposition of the gridiron plan, in favour of \\"conservative surgery\\": retaining the best buildings in an area and removing the worst. He put this into practice in Edinburgh, purchasing and improving slum tenements at James Court, and in new developments at Ramsay Garden.H. Meller, Patrick Geddes: Social Evolutionist and City Planner (London: Routledge, 1994), , pp. 54‚Äì5, 133 and 135. Neo-Classical decline The Gracco-Baroque St Stephen's, Edinburgh In the early nineteenth century the Gibbs-influenced steepled tradition continued in church architecture, as can be seen in Robert Nisbet's Inveresk Church (1803‚Äì10). A Grecian form was developed at William Burn's North Leith Church (1813) and St John's Episcopal Church, Edinburgh (1816). The controversy over the style of the Scottish National Monument in 1816 led to the labelling of Greek temple motifs as \\"pagan\\" and relatively few columnar Greek churches were built after that in the capital. An exception was Archibald Elliot's Broughton Church (1820‚Äì21), which had a Doric temple front. More common in Edinburgh were churches that combined classical elements with other features, like the domed St George's, Charlotte Square (1811‚Äì14), executed by Robert Reid, or the Gracco-Baroque of William Playfair's St Stephen's (1827‚Äì28).M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), , p. 234. In Glasgow there was a tradition of grafting porticoes on to existing meeting-houses, which continued in Gillespie Graham's West George Street Independent Church (1818), which was criticised as \\"popish\\", and John Baird I's Greyfriars United Secession Church (1821), which was fronted by a Roman Doric portico. Classical designs for the established Church included the redevelopment by William Stark of St George's-Tron Church (1807‚Äì08), David Hamilton's (1768‚Äì1843) St Enoch's Parish Church (1827) and St Paul's Parish Church (1835). Late nineteenth century Gothic revival Some of the earliest evidence of a revival in Gothic architecture is from Scotland.I. D. Whyte and K. A. Whyte, The Changing Scottish Landscape, 1500‚Äì1800 (London: Taylor & Francis, 1991), , p. 100. Inveraray Castle, constructed from 1746 with design input from William Adam, displays the incorporation of turrets. These were largely conventional Palladian style houses that incorporated some external features of the Scots Baronial style. Robert Adam's houses in this style include Mellerstain and Wedderburn in Berwickshire and Seton House in East Lothian, but it is most clearly seen at Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, remodelled by Adam from 1777. Common features borrowed from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century houses included battlemented gateways, crow-stepped gables, pointed turrets and machicolations.L. Hull, Britain's Medieval Castles (London: Greenwood, 2006), , p. 154. Abbotsford House, re-built for Walter Scott, helping to launch the Scots Baronial revival. Important for the adoption of the style in the early nineteenth century was Abbotsford House, the residence the novelist and poet, Sir Walter Scott. Rebuilt for him from 1816, it became a model for the modern revival of the Baronial style. Edward Blore (1787‚Äì1879), Edward Calvert (c. 1847‚Äì1914) and Robert Stodart Lorimer (1864‚Äì1929) and in urban contexts, including the building of Cockburn Street in Edinburgh (from the 1850s) as well as the National Wallace Monument at Stirling (1859‚Äì69).M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , pp. 276‚Äì85. Important for the dissemination of the style was Robert Billings' (1813-74) multi-volume Baronial and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of Scotland (1848-52).T. M. Devine, \\"In bed with an elephant: almost three hundred years of the Anglo-Scottish Union\\", Scottish Affairs, 57, Autumn 2006, p. 11. The rebuilding of Balmoral Castle as a baronial palace and its adoption as a royal retreat from 1855 to 1858 confirmed the popularity of the style.H.-R. Hitchcock, Architecture: Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 4th edn., 1989), , p. 146. In ecclesiastical architecture, a style with more in common to that in England was adopted, based on late Medieval models, often using arched windows, stained glass and carvings.J.S. Curl, A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), , p. 325. Important figures included Frederick Thomas Pilkington (1832‚Äì98), who developed a new style of church building which accorded with the fashionable High Gothic. He adapted it for the worship needs of the Free Church of Scotland, as at Barclay Viewforth Church, Edinburgh (1862‚Äì64).G. Stamp, \\"The Victorian kirk: Presbyterian architecture in nineteenth century Scotland\\", in C. Brooks, ed., The Victorian Church: Architecture and Society (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1995), , pp. 108‚Äì10. Robert Rowand Anderson (1834‚Äì1921), who trained in the office of George Gilbert Scott in London before returning to Edinburgh, worked mainly on small churches in the 'First Pointed' (or Early English) style that is characteristic of Scott's former assistants. By 1880 his practice was designing some of the most prestigious public and private buildings in Scotland, such as the Scottish National Portrait Gallery; the Dome of Old College, Medical Faculty and McEwan Hall, University of Edinburgh; the Central Hotel at Glasgow Central station, the Catholic Apostolic Church in Edinburgh and Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), , p. 552. Classical revival Alexander Thomson's Caledonia Road Church, Glasgow Although eclipsed by Scots Baronial and Gothic forms, Neo-classicism continued to be a major style into the nineteenth century. William Henry Playfair (1790‚Äì1857) was the designer of many of Edinburgh's neoclassical landmarks in the New Town. Two of his finest works are the National Gallery of Scotland and the Royal Scottish Academy, which are situated in the centre of Edinburgh. However, the figure most associated with the classical style was Alexander \\"Greek\\" Thomson (1817‚Äì75). Working mainly in Glasgow, he turned away from the Gothic style toward that of the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, as can be seen in the temple and columns that were part of the Caledonia Road Church (1856). David Rhind (1808‚Äì83) employed both neoclassical and Baronial styles and his work included many branches of the Commercial Bank of Scotland, among them their headquarters in Edinburgh. He also designed a number of churches, local government buildings, and houses. One of his grandest schemes was Daniel Stewart's Hospital, now Stewart's Melville College, Edinburgh. In 1849, he was commissioned to design the lay-out of the Pollokshields area of Glasgow, in what until then had been farmland south of the city centre.\\"David Rhind: Biography\\", Dictionary of Scottish Architects from 1903, retrieved 11 May 2012. Rhind formed a partnership with Robert Hamilton Paterson (1843‚Äì1911) who executed major works for brewers, malters and warehouse-men (for which Edinburgh was a centre), including design of the Abbey, James Calder & Co., Castle, Holyrood, Drybrough's, Caledonian and Clydesdale Breweries; and also work for McVitie and Price.\\"Robert Hamilton Paterson: Biography\\", Dictionary of Scottish Architects from 1903, retrieved 20 July 2011. The partnership was to execute important projects such as the Queen Victoria Memorial at Liverpool\\"Building and Design Report ‚Äì Queen Victoria Memorial, Liverpool\\", Dictionary of Scottish Architects from 1903, retrieved 20 July 2011. and the Royal Scots War Memorial in St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh.

New engineering The nineteenth century saw some major engineering projects including Thomas Telford's (1757‚Äì1834) stone Dean Bridge (1829‚Äì31) and iron Craigellachie Bridge (1812‚Äì14).C. Harvie, Scotland: A Short History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), , p. 133. In the 1850s the possibilities of new wrought- and cast-iron construction were explored in the building of commercial warehouses in Glasgow. This adopted a round-arched Venetian style first used by Alexander Kirkland (1824‚Äì92) at the heavily ornamented 37‚Äì51 Miller Street (1854) and translated into iron in John Baird I's Gardner's Warehouse (1855‚Äì6), with an exposed iron frame and almost uninterrupted glazing. Most industrial buildings avoided this cast-iron aesthetic, like William Spence's (1806?‚Äì83) Elgin Engine Works built in 1856-8, using massive rubble blocks.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , p. 254. The most important engineering project was the Forth Bridge, a cantilever railway bridge over the Firth of Forth in the east of Scotland, west of central Edinburgh. Construction of a suspension bridge designed by Thomas Bouch (1822‚Äì80), was stopped after the collapse of another of his works, the Tay Bridge.I. B. Whyte, A. J. MacDonald and C. Baxter, John Fowler, Benjamin Baker, Forth Bridge (Axel Menges, 2nd edn., 1997), , p. 7. The project was taken over by John Fowler (1817‚Äì98) and Benjamin Baker (1840‚Äì1907), who designed a structure that was built by Glasgow-based company Sir William Arrol & Co. from 1883. It was opened on 4 March 1890, and spans a total length of . It was the first major structure in Britain to be constructed of steel;A. Blanc, M. McEvoy and R.

Upper leaves are short-stalked, the stalks up to long or longer. The flowers are in green to white in panicled spikes roughly long. Some flowers are pistillate and fertile while others are perfect but sterile. The flowers bloom from August‚ÄìOctober. The individual flower heads droop at the end of a long or longer stalk. The whorl of bracts at the base of the flower head (involucre) is long. The disk is composed of 8 to 20, usually no more than 10, male (staminate) florets in the center and usually 5 female (pistillate) florets around the margin. The flowers bloom from August‚ÄìOctober. The staminate florets have stamens with the filaments fused into a tube and the anthers free but closely arranged in a ring. The corolla is about long and white to pale yellow.

The album was recorded at the Great Hall at Wits University in September 1962. It was commissioned by the university as part of an arts festival. With a limited pressing at the time, the album has become a revered foundation of modern South African jazz music, even though it is a rare album to find. Archivist Rob Allingham found an original at Gallo Music, and re-released a limited edition in 1991. The album is only a half-hour long work split into three acts. The acts are prefaced by the tracks Isinto, Chopi Chopsticks and Split Soul respectively.

Repair of the gap can lead to crossover (CO) or non-crossover (NCO) of the flanking regions. CO recombination is thought to occur by the Double Holliday Junction (DHJ) model, illustrated on the right, above. NCO recombinants are thought to occur primarily by the Synthesis Dependent Strand Annealing (SDSA) model, illustrated on the left, above. Most recombination events appear to be the SDSA type. In genetics, the initial processes involved in repair of a double- strand break by synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) are identical to those in the double Holliday junction model, and have been most extensively studied in yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Following a double-stranded break, a protein complex (MRX) binds to either end of the break, working with DNA nucleases to carry out resection, resulting in 5' end digest to produce 3' overhangs of single-stranded DNA (see Figure). These overhangs are then bound to form a nucleoprotein filament, which can then locate DNA sequences similar to one of the 3' overhangs, initiating a single-stranded strand invasion into the DNA duplex containing these sequences. Once strand invasion has occurred, a displacement loop, or D-loop, is formed, at which point either SDSA or a double Holliday junction occurs. Homologous recombination via the SDSA pathway occurs in both mitotic and meiotic cells as an important mechanism of non- crossover recombination, and was first suggested as a model in 1976, acquiring its current name in 1994. As the double Holliday junction model was the first posited in order to explain this phenomenon, various versions of the SDSA model were later proposed to explain heteroduplex DNA configurations that did not match predictions of the double Holliday junction model. Studies in S. cerevisiae found that non-crossover products appear earlier than double Holliday junctions or crossover products, which challenged the previous notion that both crossover and non-crossover products are produced by double Holliday junctions. In the SDSA model, repair of double-stranded breaks occurs without the formation of a double Holliday junction, so that the two processes of homologous recombination are identical until just after D-loop formation. In yeast, the D-loop is formed by strand invasion with the help of proteins Rad51 and Rad52, and is then acted on by DNA helicase Srs2 to prevent formation of the double Holliday junction in order for the SDSA pathway to occur. The invading 3' strand is thus extended along the recipient homologous DNA duplex by DNA polymerase in the 5' to 3' direction, so that the D-loop physically translocates ‚Äì a process referred to as bubble migration DNA synthesis. The resulting single Holliday junction then slides down the DNA duplex in the same direction in a process called branch migration, displacing the extended strand from the template strand. This displaced strand pops up to form a 3' overhang in the original double-stranded break duplex, which can then anneal to the opposite end of the original break through complementary base pairing. Thus DNA synthesis fills in gaps left over from annealing, and extends both ends of the still present single stranded DNA break, ligating all remaining gaps to produce recombinant non-crossover DNA. SDSA is unique in that D-loop translocation results in conservative rather than semiconservative replication, as the first extended strand is displaced from its template strand, leaving the homologous duplex intact. Therefore, although SDSA produces non-crossover products because flanking markers of heteroduplex DNA are not exchanged, gene conversion does occur, wherein nonreciprocal genetic transfer takes place between two homologous sequences. Enzymes employed in SDSA during meiosis Assembly of a nucleoprotein filament comprising single- stranded DNA (ssDNA) and the RecA homolog, Rad51, is a key step necessary for homology search during recombination. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Srs2 translocase dismantles Rad51 filaments during meiosis. By directly interacting with Rad51, Srs2 dislodges Rad51 from nucleoprotein filaments thereby inhibiting Rad51-dependent formation of joint molecules and D-loop structures. This dismantling activity is specific for Rad51 since Srs2 does not dismantle DMC1 (a meiosis-specific Rad51 homolog), Rad52 (a Rad 51 mediator) or replication protein A (RPA, a single-stranded DNA binding protein). Srs2 promotes the non-crossover SDSA pathway, apparently by regulating RAD51 binding during strand exchange. The Sgs1(BLM) helicase is an ortholog of the human Bloom syndrome protein. It appears to be a central regulator of most of the recombination events that occur during S. cerevisiae meiosis. Sgs1(BLM) may disassemble D-loop structures analogous to early strand invasion intermediates and thus promote NCO formation by SDSA. The Sgs1 helicase forms a conserved complex with the topoisomerase III (Top3)-RMI1 heterodimer (that catalyzes DNA single strand passage). This complex, called STR (for its three components), promotes early formation of NCO recombinants by SDSA during meiosis. As reviewed by Uringa et al. the RTEL1 helicase is required to regulate recombination during meiosis in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans. RTEL1 is a key protein in repair of DSBs. It disrupts D-loops and promotes NCO outcomes through SDSA. The number of DSBs created during meiosis can substantially exceed the number of final CO events. In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, only about 4% of DSBs are repaired by CO recombination, suggesting that most DSBs are repaired by NCO recombination. Data based on tetrad analysis from several species of fungi show that only a minority (on average about 34%) of recombination events during meiosis are COs (see Whitehouse,Whitehouse, HLK (1982). Genetic Recombination: understanding the mechanisms. Wiley. p. 321 & Table 38. . Tables 19 and 38 for summaries of data from S. cerevisiae, Podospora anserina, Sordaria fimicola and Sordaria brevicollis). In the fruit fly D. melanogaster during meiosis in females there is at least a 3:1 ratio of NCOs to COs. These observations indicate that the majority of recombination events during meiosis are NCOs, and suggest that SDSA is the principal pathway for recombination during meiosis. The major function of SDSA during meiosis presumably is to repair DNA damages, particularly DSBs, in the genomes to be passed on to gametes (see Genetic recombination).
