The village was already established as early as 1300. The area is hampered by poor, sandy soil, which is why the primary crops are rye, hay and potatoes. In 1800 there was a church, saw-mill, bakery and flour mill which defined the Village. In 1835-36 farmers were liberated from Serfdom under Prussian Law and a few farms were established. The area is the home of Farmers and Artisans. The museum of Zaborland lies here, displaying area folk art and contemporary Kashubian artistry.

It touches on its north-west corner the M25 motorway and remains a small part in Watford. The estate is situated within three different settlements; most of the land and all of the mansion itself are in the civil parish of Sarratt, and also in the ecclesiastical parish of Langleybury, while the estate lies within the post town of Rickmansworth. Originally built as an English country house on the site of a medieval manor house, The Grove served as the family seat of the Earls of Clarendon (second creation), the Villiers family, from 1776‚Äìc.1920. Since its Georgian construction, The Grove has been altered and extended four times by a number of noted architects, including Surveyor of the King's Works, Robert Taylor. Following the increase in estate duty in 1914, the Villiers Family sold off the house and estate. Today it is in use as a luxury hotel and golf course. The Grove often hosts major international events, such as the WGC-American Express Championship in 2006, the 2009 G20 London summit, the 2013 Bilderberg Conference and the 2019 NATO Leaders' Meeting. Local geography The majority of the estate, including the mansion is in the post town of Rickmansworth, having postal prefix WD3. However the east including the former mill is in Watford's first subdivision of post town (WD17). Watford was the estate's parish in all forms of local geography from 1086 until 1878. A similar minority is in the ecclesiastical parish of Watford (St Luke), although most of the land and all of the mansion has been in Langleybury ecclesiastically since 1878, when that parish was founded. Secularly the mansion is in Sarratt civil parish.Map of Sarratt Civil Parish The Office for National Statistics Retrieved 9 December 2014. The hotel's publicity material makes reference to Chandlers Cross, the nearest settlement, formerly part of another parish and which has a nucleus to the west. It has now become the smaller of two settlements in the neighbouring ecclesiastical parish of Chipperfield but is in the same parish in terms of local government.Parish of Langleybury The Church of England. Retrieved 9 December 2014.  History Archaeology= Excavations on the estate in 2002 revealed evidence from all periods of human cultural development. The earliest evidence of human activity is a Neolithic polished stone axe that was discovered in a small pit with the remains of a pot that appears to be of Middle Bronze Age. The first evidence of settlement consists of traces of oval and circular dwelling structures from the Early Bronze Age (around 4,000 years old). The Iron Age gives some pottery evidence but none of settlement. Two burials have been found dating to the Roman period, although they seem to be in the native rather than Roman tradition. Traces of Saxon settlement, rare in Hertfordshire, have been found. There are remains of at least eight grubenhause, sunken-floored buildings that are typical of this period. Medieval pottery contemporary with the building of the first manor house have been found in ditches.Preliminary investigations AOC Archaeology Group, 2002 =First references to The Grove= In 1294‚Äì5 John de Brittewell and Sarah his wife conveyed land and a third part of a mill written as 'La Grava' to Albreda de Brittewell and her two sisters Alice and Ellen. In 1324‚Äì5 Thomas de Harpesfield and Joan his wife held land in the demesne of St Albans at La Grava in the vill of Cassio, and the abbot released them from rent due for it. There is a monumental inscription in Watford church to John Heydon of the Grove, who died in 1400. John Rayner and Joan his wife conveyed the manor in 1481‚Äì1482 to John Fortescue, John Sturgeon, John Forster, and Henry Heydon, for the use of John Fortescue. Upon its administration in the Court of Chancery the estate passed to John Melksham or Melsam, who died in 1487, leaving John his son and heir, who, in 1503 with his wife Elizabeth, granted it to Reginald Pegge reserving a rent of ¬£10. It passed to his son William, who, with Margaret his wife and the late wife of Pegge snr. (and her new husband Geoffrey Oxley), conveyed the manor in 1518 to William (d.1545) and John Heydon. William's son was Henry (d. 1559) who inherited and left the Grove to his son Francis, who sold the manor in 1602 to Clement Scudamore. He sold it in 1631 and two water-mills under one roof, called the Grove Mills, to Sir William Ashton who left it to his second son Robert. His son died without issue in 1703 so it passed to Sir William Buck who died in 1717, great-grandson of Sir William Ashton. It passed to son Charles Buck, who had it totally rebuilt (see below) and in 1728 sold it to the trustees of Fulke Greville, born 1717. He in 1743 sold it to Arthur M. St Leger, 3rd Viscount Doneraile, who conveyed it in 1748 in legal title not equity to Charles Unwin (as his trustee) -- so on death in 1750 without issue, Doneraile's will confirmed his wish it pass to cousin Elizabeth St Leger 'until marriage' -- she then married Major Ralph Burton. On her marriage the estate re-vested in trustees, who sold it in 1753 to the Thomas Villiers, successful diplomat and second son of William Villiers, 2nd Earl of Jersey. Thomas Villiers married the heiress to the wealthiest branch of the Hyde family whose 1st Earl was a minister under Charles, Charles II and grandfather of Anne and Mary. =Seat for the new Earls of Clarendon= Thomas was soon created Lord Hyde (Baron Hyde of Hindon) for his diplomatic services in 1756 and in 1776 the Crown revived the old Earldom and raised him to 1st Earl of Clarendon (second creation). The fourth earl was a statesman, diplomat (architect of the Quadruple Alliance of 1834), Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Privy Seal, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, President of the Board of Trade, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and gained non-occupational titles KG and GCB. Consequently, regular guests in the mid and late nineteenth century included Queen Victoria, Prime Minister Lord Palmerston and Edward VII. =Since 1900= Since 1996, The Grove Hotel has been used as a luxury hotel US President Donald Trump at a lunch during the 2019 NATO summit in the Mansion Room at The Grove In the early 20th century, death duties, a form of taxation introduced in 1894 by the Liberal Government, was placing an increasing financial burden on landed gentry and was responsible for the breaking up of many large estates across Britain. In the 1920s, in order to reduce their tax liabilities, the Villiers family decided to sell The Grove, downsizing their holdings to their estate at Swanmore, Hampshire. Also at around this time, nearby Cassiobury House was sold off by the widow of George Capell, 7th Earl of Essex in 1922 due to prohibitive death duties. After the sale, The Grove was then used as a gardening school, a health centre (National Institute of Nutrition and College of Dietetics), a riding school, and a girls' boarding school. It was the wartime headquarters of one of the Big Four consolidated railway companies. It became a management training centre for the British Transport Commission and later British Rail. In 1996, the estate was acquired by Ralph Trustees Ltd, at which time the mansion was extended and converted into an hotel. Jeremy Blake, an architect with listed buildings and sustainability expertise, was appointed to undertake these works. The Grove is a former AA Hotel of the Year and was voted the UK's Favourite Leisure Hotel by Cond√© Nast Traveler readers in 2008. The formal gardens were designed by the Chelsea Flower Show Gold Medallist and judge, Michael Balston. Other features include an 18-hole championship golf course designed by the Californian Kyle Phillips. The golf course is laid out to the south and east of the house (which is on a low hill above the valley of the river Gade) with its eastern border reaching to the western bank of the Grand Union Canal (that incoroprates the Gade in this part of the valley) and its southern border adjacent to the golf course of the West Hert Golf Club. In 2006, it was the venue of the WGC-American Express Championship golf tournament. It was the venue for the April 2009 G20 London summit. The 2013 Bilderberg Conference took place in the hotel\\"The week ahead: Bilderberg 2013 comes to ‚Ä¶ the Grove hotel, Watford\\" The Guardian and in 2016 it hosted the British Masters golf tournament. It also hosted the 2019 NATO Leaders' Meeting, chaired by the NATO Secretary General, on 4 December 2019. Architecture The main house is a red brick structure with stone quoins, mostly in the Palladian style. The south-facing front of the house is flanked by large neoclassical Doric pilasters. The architecture developed as follows: *The Grove was built about 1720 Charles Buck; its foundations and its internal structure dates to that year. *Altered 1754-61 by architect Matthew Brettingham for the 1st Earl (see above and below). **He produced a seven-bay south front with two wings, facing south, between 1754 and 1761. Its south facing main entrance front features a \\"2:3:2, main range articulated by Giant Roman Doric pilasters...To [the] centre a larger round-headed sash with apron panel and key blocked surround in an aedicular frame with pediment rising above 20th century stone coped parapet. Cross axial stacks.\\" The Grove - Grade II* architectural (mid- category) listing. *Extended and altered c.1780 by architect Sir Robert Taylor for the 1st Earl. **Demolished the Brettingham wing with the family chapel and created a Palladian two-storey mansion with Venetian windows and, internally, Italian plasterwork. The eastern front was designed in response to the new Repton-inspired drive, winding through the Gade Valley over a bridge and between lakes, which have all been restored. He was also responsible for four fireplaces, one of which was destroyed to make way for a secretary's desk when the mansion was used as railway offices. A replica of the fireplace was created during the restoration of the mansion. *Level added, altered and extended c.1870‚Äì5 by architect Edward Blore for the 4th Earl. **Under the 4th Earl of Clarendon (1800‚Äì1875), the family's political prominence meant that they entertained regularly. Third storey added to the house. Grander ground floor and main staircase created to make space to display the Earl's large collection of Old Masters. *Altered and extended mid-20th century. *Altered and extended 1996‚Äì2000.

It is part of the National Register of Historic Places listed Central Whidbey Island Historic District. History The Captain Whidbey Inn was built in the fall and winter of 1907 from Madrona logs and stone found on-site by Chris Fisher and his son Edward. The post and beam construction, with the log infill, sits intact as originally built. Larry Fisher, Chris Fisher's great-grandson, still works occasionally on the inn. It was opened in May 1907 as part of a large recreation retreat then-called Still Park. The inn and park were developed by Judge Lester Still. The park also had camping, cabins, horse trails, tennis courts and a warm salt water swimming pool. A collection of pictures from that period remain in a history collection at the inn. The inn originally contained 15 sleeping rooms upstairs and a large gathering room downstairs with a two-sided fireplace. The fireplace was faced with native stone; it still forms the central meeting place for the inn. Daily steamers from both Seattle and Everett were the original links to the outside world bringing passengers, supplies and mail to the dock located at the eastward-facing front of the inn. Parts of the original dock and stone stairway can still be seen while walking the current pier. Automobile access was available via ferry before Deception Pass Bridge was completed in 1935; Judge Still is credited with bringing the first automobile to Whidbey Island. The vehicle can still be seen at the Island County Historical Society Museum. Over time, the Inn has served as a general store, a girls' school, and a post office. The property returned to offering accommodations open to the public in 1946. Present Today, the inn appears very similar to the way it was when it was built. The original wood floors are still visible in both the lobby and the bar. The large gathering room has become the dining room, kitchen, and Judge Still's Tavern. Over the years, electricity as well as Wi-Fi have been installed and upgraded throughout the building. The original inn now houses two suites and 10 regular rooms upstairs overlooking Penn cove and the gardens. The original cabins are now gone and have been replaced by four waterside cabins with private decks, views of Penn Cove and kitchens. The Lagoon Building houses 13 rooms that overlook the lagoon lawn and lagoon. Each of these room has a unique style filled with rustic charm. Guests can arrive either by car or, during the summer, at the inns dock by boat or float plane.

Having taught at Worcester College, Oxford, he was Brunner Professor of Egyptology at the University of Liverpool from 1934 to 1948. He was additionally a special lecturer at the University of Manchester, and was involved in or led a number of excavations with the Egypt Exploration Society. Early life and education Blackman was born in Dawlish, Devon, the eldest son of Rev. James Henry Blackman and Mary Anne Blackman (n√©e Jacob). He was educated at home and his interest in archaeology was inspired by his father, a keen amateur archaeologist who created archaeological digs by burying home made 'tablets' for his children to discover. Aylward's oldest sister, Winifred Susan Blackman, (1872‚Äì1950), also became an Egyptologist. He joined St Paul's School at the age of sixteen and gained a scholarship to study at Queen's College, Oxford. At Oxford, Blackman was a pupil of Francis Llewellyn Griffith, and graduated with a First Class degree in Oriental Studies in 1906. Academic career After graduation, Blackman worked in Nubia as an assistant on Reisner's Archaeological Survey of Nubia, 1907‚Äì1908, and the excavation of Buhen by the University of Pennsylvania. Blackman also carried out a survey of the temples of Nubia, including the temples at Biga, Dendur, and Derr. He was unable to complete the survey after he suffered a major attack of Typhoid fever at Gerf Hussein, which affected his health for the rest of his life. Due to his research, Blackman was appointed the Oxford Nubian Research Fellow and assisted Griffith in his excavation of Farras. Blackman was the Laycock Fellow of Egyptology at Worcester College, Oxford from 1912 to 1934. During this period he became closely associated with the Egypt Exploration Society and was a member of the Society's committee for many years. On behalf of the Society, he directed the excavation of Meir, (1912‚Äì1914, 1921, 1949‚Äì1950) and the excavation of Sesebi, Sudan, (1936‚Äì1937). From 1934 to 1948, he was the Brunner Professor of Egyptology at the University of Liverpool, and taught in the Liverpool Institute of Archaeology. His research during this period was affected by a serious accident in Germany in 1936 which left him hospitalised and a bombing raid in 1941 which destroyed his home and his work place. Despite the set backs, Blackman was able to introduced important changes to the teaching of Egyptology at Liverpool and lead the conversion of the Institute of Archaeology into a properly constituted school of the University. Blackman was also a special lecturer in Egyptology at the University of Manchester, (1936‚Äì1948), and the tutor of the Crown Prince of Ethiopia, (1937‚Äì1939). After his retirement in 1948, Blackman returned to Meir for one final season and published his research on the site in 1953. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1953. He died in 1956 in Abergele. Selected works  * *English translation, from the German Literatur der Aegypter (1923): Adolf Erman, The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians, London, Methuen & Co., 1927.

Pamela McCorduck calls it an \\"odd paradox\\" that \\"practical AI successes, computational programs that actually achieved intelligent behavior, were soon assimilated into whatever application domain they were found to be useful in, and became silent partners alongside other problem-solving approaches, which left AI researchers to deal only with the \\"failures\\", the tough nuts that couldn't yet be cracked.\\" When IBM's chess playing computer Deep Blue succeeded in defeating Garry Kasparov in 1997, people complained that it had only used \\"brute force methods\\" and it wasn't real intelligence.

When problems have not yet been formalised, they can still be characterised by a model of computation that includes human computation. The computational burden of a problem is split between a computer and a human: one part is solved by computer and the other part solved by human. This formalisation is referred to as human-assisted Turing machine.Dafna Shahaf and Eyal Amir (2007) Towards a theory of AI completeness. Commonsense 2007, 8th International Symposium on Logical Formalizations of Commonsense Reasoning.  AI applications become mainstream  Software and algorithms developed by AI researchers are now integrated into many applications throughout the world, without really being called AI. Michael Swaine reports \\"AI advances are not trumpeted as artificial intelligence so much these days, but are often seen as advances in some other field\\". \\"AI has become more important as it has become less conspicuous\\", Patrick Winston says. \\"These days, it is hard to find a big system that does not work, in part, because of ideas developed or matured in the AI world.\\" According to Stottler Henke, \\"The great practical benefits of AI applications and even the existence of AI in many software products go largely unnoticed by many despite the already widespread use of AI techniques in software. This is the AI effect. Many marketing people don't use the term 'artificial intelligence' even when their company's products rely on some AI techniques. Why not?\\" Marvin Minsky writes \\"This paradox resulted from the fact that whenever an AI research project made a useful new discovery, that product usually quickly spun off to form a new scientific or commercial specialty with its own distinctive name. These changes in name led outsiders to ask, Why do we see so little progress in the central field of artificial intelligence?\\" Nick Bostrom observes that \\"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labelled AI anymore.\\"Quoted in  Legacy of the AI winter  Many AI researchers find that they can procure more funding and sell more software if they avoid the tarnished name of \\"artificial intelligence\\" and instead pretend their work has nothing to do with intelligence at all. This was especially true in the early 1990s, during the second \\"AI winter\\".

Kearns argues that the change in perception known as the AI effect can be traced to the mystery being removed from the system. In being able to trace the cause of events implies that it's a form of automation rather than intelligence. A related effect has been noted in the history of animal cognition and in consciousness studies, where every time a capacity formerly thought as uniquely human is discovered in animals, (e.g. the ability to make tools, or passing the mirror test), the overall importance of that capacity is deprecated. Herbert A. Simon, when asked about the lack of AI's press coverage at the time, said, \\"What made AI different was that the very idea of it arouses a real fear and hostility in some human breasts.

It is built by choosing some constant time hypersurface as an origin, such that has in every point a normal along the time line (lies inside the light cone with an apex in that point); all interval elements on this hypersurface are space-like. A family of geodesics normal to this hypersurface are drawn and defined as the time coordinates with a beginning at the hypersurface. Such a construct, and hence, choice of synchronous frame, is always possible though it is not unique. It allows any transformation of space coordinates that does not depend on time and, additionally, a transformation brought about by the arbitrary choice of hypersurface used for this geometric construct.  Synchronization over a curved space  Synchronization of clocks located at different space points means that events happening at different places can be measured as simultaneous if those clocks show the same times. In special relativity, the space distance element dl is defined as the intervals between two very close events that occur at the same moment of time. In general relativity this cannot be done, that is, one cannot define dl by just substituting dt ‚â° dx0 = 0 in the metric. The reason for this is the different dependence between proper time and time coordinate x0 ‚â° t in different points of space. Figure 1. Synchronization of clocks in curved space through light signals. To find dl in this case, time can be synchronized over some space span in the following way (Fig. 1): Bob sends a light signal from some space point B with coordinates x^{\\\\alpha} + dx^{\\\\alpha} to Alice who is at a very close point A with coordinates xŒ± and then Alice immediately reflects (ds_A^2 = 0 for photon) the signal back to Bob. The time necessary for this operation (measured by Bob), multiplied by c is, obviously, the doubled distance between Alice and Bob. The squared interval, with separated space and time coordinates, is: where a repeated Greek index within a term means summation by values 1, 2, 3. The interval between the events of signal arrival and its immediate reflection back at point A is zero (two events, arrival and reflection is happening at the same point in space and time). Equation ds_A^2 = 0 solved for dx0 gives two roots: : dx^{0(1)} = \\\\frac{1}{g_{00}} \\\\left ( -g_{0\\\\alpha}\\\\, dx^\\\\alpha - \\\\sqrt{\\\\left ( g_{0\\\\alpha}g_{0\\\\beta} - g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}g_{00} \\\\right )\\\\, dx^\\\\alpha \\\\,dx^\\\\beta} \\\\right ), \\\\left ( -g_{0\\\\alpha}\\\\, dx^\\\\alpha + \\\\sqrt{\\\\left ( g_{0\\\\alpha}g_{0\\\\beta} - g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}g_{00} \\\\right ) \\\\,dx^\\\\alpha \\\\,dx^\\\\beta} \\\\right ),}} which correspond to the propagation of the signal in both directions between Alice and Bob. If x0 is the moment of arrival/reflection of the signal to/from Alice in Bob's clock then, the moments of signal departure from Bob and its arrival back to Bob correspond, respectively, to x0 \\\\+ dx0 (1) and x0 \\\\+ dx0 (2). The thick lines on Fig. 1 are the world lines of Alice and Bob with coordinates xŒ± and xŒ± \\\\+ dxŒ±, respectively, while the red lines are the world lines of the signals. Fig. 1 supposes that dx0 (2) is positive and dx0 (1) is negative, which, however, is not necessarily the case: dx0 (1) and dx0 (2) may have the same sign. The fact that in the latter case the value x0 (Alice) in the moment of signal arrival at Alice's position may be less than the value x0 (Bob) in the moment of signal departure from Bob does not contain a contradiction because clocks in different points of space are not supposed to be synchronized. It is clear that the full \\"time\\" interval between departure and arrival of the signal in Bob's place is : dx^{0(2)} - dx^{0(1)} = \\\\frac{2}{g_{00}} \\\\sqrt{\\\\left ( g_{0\\\\alpha}g_{0\\\\beta} - g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}g_{00} \\\\right ) \\\\,dx^\\\\alpha \\\\,dx^\\\\beta}. The respective proper time interval is obtained from the above relationship by multiplication by \\\\sqrt{g_{00}}/c, and the distance dl between the two points ‚Äì by additional multiplication by c/2. As a result: {g_{00}} \\\\right )\\\\, dx^\\\\alpha \\\\,dx^\\\\beta.}} This is the required relationship that defines distance through the space coordinate elements. It is obvious that such synchronization should be done by exchange of light signals between points. Consider again propagation of signals between infinitesimally close points A and B in Fig. 1. The clock reading in B which is simultaneous with the moment of reflection in A lies in the middle between the moments of sending and receiving the signal in B; in this moment if Alice's clock reads y0 and Bob's clock reads x0 then via Einstein Synchronization condition, :y^0 = \\\\frac{(x^0 + dx^{0(1)}) + (x^0 + dx^{0(2)}) }{2} = x^0 + \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\left ( dx^{0(2)} + dx^{0(1)} \\\\right ) = x^0 + \\\\Delta x^0 . Substitute here to find the difference in \\"time\\" x0 between two simultaneous events occurring in infinitesimally close points as \\\\equiv g_\\\\alpha \\\\,dx^\\\\alpha.}} This relationship allows clock synchronization in any infinitesimally small space volume. By continuing such synchronization further from point A, one can synchronize clocks, that is, determine simultaneity of events along any open line. The synchronization condition can be written in another form by multiplying by g00 and bringing terms to the left hand side or, the \\"covariant differential\\" dx0 between two infinitesimally close points should be zero. However, it is impossible, in general, to synchronize clocks along a closed contour: starting out along the contour and returning to the starting point one would obtain a Œîx0 value different from zero. Thus, unambiguous synchronization of clocks over the whole space is impossible. An exception are reference frames in which all components g0Œ± are zeros. The inability to synchronize all clocks is a property of the reference frame and not of the spacetime itself. It is always possible in infinitely many ways in any gravitational field to choose the reference frame so that the three g0Œ± become zeros and thus enable a complete synchronization of clocks. To this class are assigned cases where g0Œ± can be made zeros by a simple change in the time coordinate which does not involve a choice of a system of objects that define the space coordinates. In the special relativity theory, too, proper time elapses differently for clocks moving relatively to each other. In general relativity, proper time is different even in the same reference frame at different points of space. This means that the interval of proper time between two events occurring at some space point and the time interval between the events simultaneous with those at another space point are, in general, different.  Space metric tensor  can be rewritten in the form where {g_{00}}}} is the three-dimensional metric tensor that determines the metric, that is, the geometrical properties of space. Equations give the relationships between the metric of the three-dimensional space \\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} and the metric of the four-dimensional spacetime g_{ik}. In general, however, g_{ik} depends on x0 so that \\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} changes with time. Therefore, it doesn't make sense to integrate dl: this integral depends on the choice of world line between the two points on which it is taken. It follows that in general relativity the distance between two bodies cannot be determined in general; this distance is determined only for infinitesimally close points. Distance can be determined also for finite space regions only in such reference frames in which gik does not depend on time and therefore the integral \\\\int{dl} along the space curve acquires some definite sense. The tensor -\\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} is inverse to the contravariant 3-dimensional tensor g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}. Indeed, writing equation g^{ik}g_{kl} = \\\\delta_l^i in components, one has: : g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}g_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} + g^{\\\\alpha 0}g_{0 \\\\gamma} = \\\\delta_\\\\gamma^\\\\alpha, : g^{0 \\\\beta}g_{\\\\beta 0} + g^{00}g_{00} = 1. Determining g^{\\\\alpha 0} from the second equation and substituting it in the first proves that This result can be presented otherwise by saying that g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} are components of a contravariant 3-dimensional tensor corresponding to metric \\\\gamma^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}: The determinants g and Œ≥ composed of elements g_{ik} and \\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}, respectively, are related to each other by the simple relationship: In many applications, it is convenient to define a 3-dimensional vector g with covariant components {g_{00}}.}} Considering g as a vector in space with metric \\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}, its contravariant components can be written as g^{\\\\alpha} = \\\\gamma^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} g_{\\\\beta}. Using and the second of , it is easy to see that From the third of , it follows \\\\- g_\\\\alpha g^\\\\alpha.}} Synchronous coordinates As concluded from , the condition that allows clock synchronization in different space points is that metric tensor components g0Œ± are zeros. If, in addition, g00 = 1, then the time coordinate x0 = t is the proper time in each space point (with c = 1). A reference frame that satisfies the conditions is called synchronous frame. The interval element in this system is given by the expression with the spatial metric tensor components identical (with opposite sign) to the components gŒ±Œ≤: Figure 2. A synchronous frame built with the choice of the timelike hypersurface t = const (teal color). Only one spatial coordinate x1 = x is shown. The four observers have the same proper times x0 = t which are normal to the hypersurface in their locally flat spacetimes (shown by the light cones). The unit vector n0 = u0 = 1 is shown in yellow. There are no spatial velocity components (uŒ± = 0) so the common proper time is a geodesic line with a beginning at the hypersurface and a positive direction (red arrows). In synchronous frame time, time lines are normal to the hypersurfaces t = const. Indeed, the unit four-vector normal to such a hypersurface ni = ‚àÇt/‚àÇxi has covariant components nŒ± = 0, n0 = 1. The respective contravariant components with the conditions are again nŒ± = 0, n0 = 1. The components of the unit normal coincide with those of the four-vector u i = dxi/ds which is tangent to the world line x1, x2, x3 = const. The u i with components uŒ± = 0, u0 = 1 automatically satisfies the geodesic equations: :\\\\frac{du^i}{ds} + \\\\Gamma_{kl}^i u^k u^l = \\\\Gamma_{00}^i = 0, since, from the conditions , the Christoffel symbols \\\\Gamma_{00}^{\\\\alpha} and \\\\Gamma_{00}^0 vanish identically. Therefore, in the synchronous frame the time lines are geodesics in the spacetime. These properties can be used to construct synchronous frame in any spacetime (Fig. 2). To this end, choose some spacelike hypersurface as an origin, such that has in every point a normal along the time line (lies inside the light cone with an apex in that point); all interval elements on this hypersurface are space-like. Then draw a family of geodesics normal to this hypersurface. Choose these lines as time coordinate lines and define the time coordinate t as the length s of the geodesic measured with a beginning at the hypersurface; the result is a synchronous frame. An analytic transformation to synchronous frame can be done with the use of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The principle of this method is based on the fact that particle trajectories in gravitational fields are geodesics. The Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a particle (whose mass is set equal to unity) in a gravitational field is where S is the action. Its complete integral has the form: where f is a function of the four coordinates xi and the three parameters ŒæŒ±; the constant A is treated as an arbitrary function of the three ŒæŒ±. With such a representation for S the equations for the trajectory of the particle can be obtained by equating the derivatives ‚àÇS/‚àÇŒæŒ± to zero, i.e. = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial \\\\xi^{\\\\alpha}}.}} For each set of assigned values of the parameters ŒæŒ±, the right sides of equations have definite constant values, and the world line determined by these equations is one of the possible trajectories of the particle. Choosing the quantities ŒæŒ±, which are constant along the trajectory, as new space coordinates, and the quantity S as the new time coordinate, one obtains a synchronous frame; the transformation from the old coordinates to the new ones is given by equations . In fact, it is guaranteed that for such a transformation the time lines will be geodesics and will be normal to the hypersurfaces S = const. The latter point is obvious from the mechanical analogy: the four-vector ‚àÇS/‚àÇxi which is normal to the hypersurface coincides in mechanics with the four-momentum of the particle, and therefore coincides in direction with its four-velocity u i i.e. with the four-vector tangent to the trajectory. Finally the condition g00 = 1 is obviously satisfied, since the derivative ‚àídS/ds of the action along the trajectory is the mass of the particle, which was set equal to 1; therefore dS/ds = 1. The gauge conditions do not fix the coordinate system completely and therefore are not a fixed gauge, as the spacelike hypersurface at t=0 can be chosen arbitrarily. One still have the freedom of performing some coordinate transformations containing four arbitrary functions depending on the three spatial variables xŒ±, which are easily worked out in infinitesimal form: Here, the collections of the four old coordinates (t, xŒ±) and four new coordinates (\\\\tilde{t}, \\\\tilde{x}^{\\\\alpha}) are denoted by the symbols x and \\\\tilde{x}, respectively. The functions \\\\xi^i(\\\\tilde{x}) together with their first derivatives are infinitesimally small quantities. After such a transformation, the four-dimensional interval takes the form: where In the last formula, the g_{ik}(\\\\tilde{x}) are the same functions gik(x) in which x should simply be replaced by \\\\tilde{x}. If one wishes to preserve the gauge also for the new metric tensor g^{(new)}_{ik} (\\\\tilde{x}) in the new coordinates \\\\tilde{x}, it is necessary to impose the following restrictions on the functions \\\\xi^i (\\\\acute{x}): = 0, \\\\quad g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} (\\\\tilde{x}) \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\xi^{\\\\beta} (\\\\tilde{x})}{\\\\partial \\\\tilde{t}} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\xi^0 (\\\\tilde{x})}{\\\\partial \\\\tilde{x}^{\\\\alpha}} = 0.}} The solutions of these equations are: d \\\\tilde{x}^0 } + f^{\\\\alpha} \\\\left (\\\\tilde{x}^1, \\\\tilde{x}^2, \\\\tilde{x}^3 \\\\right ),}} where f0 and fŒ± are four arbitrary functions depending only on the spatial coordinates \\\\tilde{x}^{\\\\alpha}. For a more elementary geometrical explanation, consider Fig. 2. First, the synchronous time line Œæ0 = t can be chosen arbitrarily (Bob's, Carol's, Dana's or any of an infinitely many observers). This makes one arbitrarily chosen function: \\\\xi^0 = f^0 \\\\left (\\\\tilde{x}^1, \\\\tilde{x}^2, \\\\tilde{x}^3 \\\\right ). Second, the initial hypersurface can be chosen in infinitely many ways. Each of these choices changes three functions: one function for each of the three spatial coordinates \\\\xi^{\\\\alpha} = f^{\\\\alpha} \\\\left (\\\\tilde{x}^1, \\\\tilde{x}^2, \\\\tilde{x}^3 \\\\right ). Altogether, four (= 1 + 3) functions are arbitrary. When discussing general solutions gŒ±Œ≤ of the field equations in synchronous gauges, it is necessary to keep in mind that the gravitational potentials gŒ±Œ≤ contain, among all possible arbitrary functional parameters present in them, four arbitrary functions of 3-space just representing the gauge freedom and therefore of no direct physical significance. Another problem with the synchronous frame is that caustics can occur which cause the gauge choice to break down. These problems have caused some difficulties doing cosmological perturbation theory in synchronous frame, but the problems are now well understood. Synchronous coordinates are generally considered the most efficient reference system for doing calculations, and are used in many modern cosmology codes, such as CMBFAST. They are also useful for solving theoretical problems in which a spacelike hypersurface needs to be fixed, as with spacelike singularities. Einstein equations in synchronous frame Introduction of a synchronous frame allows one to separate the operations of space and time differentiation in the Einstein field equations. To make them more concise, the notation {\\\\partial t}}} is introduced for the time derivatives of the three-dimensional metric tensor; these quantities also form a three-dimensional tensor. In the synchronous frame \\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} is proportional to the second fundamental form (shape tensor). All operations of shifting indices and covariant differentiation of the tensor \\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} are done in three-dimensional space with the metric Œ≥Œ±Œ≤. This does not apply to operations of shifting indices in the space components of the four-tensors Rik, Tik. Thus TŒ±Œ≤ must be understood to be gŒ≤Œ≥TŒ≥Œ± \\\\+ gŒ≤0T0Œ±, which reduces to gŒ≤Œ≥TŒ≥Œ± and differs in sign from Œ≥Œ≤Œ≥TŒ≥Œ±. The sum \\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\alpha} is the logarithmic derivative of the determinant Œ≥ ‚â° Œ≥Œ±Œ≤ = ‚àí g: {\\\\partial t} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\ln{(\\\\gamma)}.}} Then for the complete set of Christoffel symbols \\\\Gamma_{kl}^i one obtains: where \\\\lambda_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}^{\\\\gamma} are the three-dimensional Christoffel symbols constructed from Œ≥Œ±Œ≤: where the comma denotes partial derivative by the respective coordinate. With the Christoffel symbols , the components Rik = gilRlk of the Ricci tensor can be written in the form: \\\\dot{\\\\left (\\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma} \\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta} \\\\right )} - P_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta}.}} Dots on top denote time differentiation, semicolons (\\";\\") denote covariant differentiation which in this case is performed with respect to the three-dimensional metric Œ≥Œ±Œ≤ with three-dimensional Christoffel symbols \\\\lambda_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}^{\\\\gamma}, \\\\varkappa \\\\equiv \\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\alpha}, and PŒ±Œ≤ is a three-dimensional Ricci tensor constructed from \\\\lambda_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}^{\\\\gamma}: It follows from that the Einstein equations R_i^k = 8 \\\\pi k \\\\left ( T_i^k - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\delta_i^k T \\\\right ) (with the components of the energy-momentum tensor T00 = ‚àíT00, TŒ±0 = ‚àíT0Œ±, TŒ±Œ≤ = Œ≥Œ≤Œ≥TŒ≥Œ±) become in a synchronous frame: \\\\dot{\\\\left (\\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma} \\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta} \\\\right )} - P_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta} = 8 \\\\pi k \\\\left ( T_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\delta_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta} T \\\\right ).}} A characteristic feature of synchronous frame is that they are not stationary: the gravitational field cannot be constant in such frame. In a constant field \\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} would become zero. But in the presence of matter the disappearance of all \\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} would contradict (which has a right side different from zero). In empty space from follows that all PŒ±Œ≤, and with them all the components of the three-dimensional curvature tensor PŒ±Œ≤Œ≥Œ¥ (Riemann tensor) vanish, i.e. the field vanishes entirely (in a synchronous frame with a Euclidean spatial metric the space-time is flat). At the same time the matter filling the space cannot in general be at rest relative to the synchronous frame. This is obvious from the fact that particles of matter within which there are pressures generally move along lines that are not geodesics; the world line of a particle at rest is a time line, and thus is a geodesic in the synchronous frame. An exception is the case of dust (p = 0). Here the particles interacting with one another will move along geodesic lines; consequently, in this case the condition for a synchronous frame does not contradict the condition that it be comoving with the matter. Even in this case, in order to be able to choose a synchronously comoving frame, it is still necessary that the matter move without rotation. In the comoving frame the contravariant components of the velocity are u0 = 1, uŒ± = 0. If the frame is also synchronous, the covariant components must satisfy u0 = 1, uŒ± = 0, so that its four-dimensional curl must vanish: :u_{i;k} - u_{k;i} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_i}{\\\\partial x^k} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_k}{\\\\partial x^i} = 0. But this tensor equation must then also be valid in any other reference frame. Thus, in a synchronous but not comoving frame the condition curl v = 0 for the three-dimensional velocity v is additionally needed. For other equations of state a similar situation can occur only in special cases when the pressure gradient vanishes in all or in certain directions. Singularity in synchronous frame Use of the synchronous frame in cosmological problems requires thorough examination of its asymptotic behaviour. In particular, it must be known if the synchronous frame can be extended to infinite time and infinite space maintaining always the unambiguous labelling of every point in terms of coordinates in this frame. It was shown that unambiguous synchronization of clocks over the whole space is impossible because of the impossibility to synchronize clocks along a closed contour. As concerns synchronization over infinite time, let's first remind that the time lines of all observers are normal to the chosen hypersurface and in this sense are \\"parallel\\". Traditionally, the concept of parallelism is defined in Euclidean geometry to mean straight lines that are everywhere equidistant from each other but in arbitrary geometries this concept can be extended to mean lines that are geodesics. It was shown that time lines are geodesics in synchronous frame. Another, more convenient for the present purpose definition of parallel lines are those that have all or none of their points in common. Excluding the case of all points in common (obviously, the same line) one arrives to the definition of parallelism where no two time lines have a common point. Since the time lines in a synchronous frame are geodesics, these lines are straight (the path of light) for all observers in the generating hypersurface. The spatial metric is :dl^2 = \\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} dx^{\\\\alpha} dx^{\\\\beta}. The determinant \\\\gamma of the metric tensor is the absolute value of the triple product of the row vectors in the matrix \\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} which is also the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the vectors {\\\\vec \\\\gamma}_1, {\\\\vec \\\\gamma}_2, and {\\\\vec \\\\gamma}_3 (i.e., the parallelepiped whose adjacent sides are the vectors {\\\\vec \\\\gamma}_1, {\\\\vec \\\\gamma}_2, and {\\\\vec \\\\gamma}_3). : \\\\gamma = {\\\\vec \\\\gamma}_1 \\\\cdot({\\\\vec \\\\gamma}_2 \\\\times {\\\\vec \\\\gamma}_3) = \\\\left \\\\begin{array}{ccc} \\\\gamma _{11} & \\\\gamma _{12} & \\\\gamma _{13}  \\\\gamma _{21} & \\\\gamma _{22} & \\\\gamma _{23}  \\\\gamma _{31} & \\\\gamma _{32} & \\\\gamma _{33} \\\\end{array} \\\\right = V_\\\\text{parallelepiped} If \\\\gamma turns into zero then the volume of this parallelepiped is zero. This can happen when one of the vectors lies in the plane of the other two vectors so that the parallelepiped volume transforms to the area of the base (height becomes zero), or more formally, when two of the vectors are linearly dependent. But then multiple points (the points of intersection) can be labelled in the same way, that is, the metric has a singularity. The Landau group have found that the synchronous frame necessarily forms a time singularity, that is, the time lines intersect (and, respectively, the metric tensor determinant turns to zero) in a finite time. This is proven in the following way. The right-hand of the , containing the stress-energy tensors of matter and electromagnetic field, :T_i^k = \\\\left(p + \\\\varepsilon \\\\right) \\\\times u_i u^k + p \\\\delta_i^k is a positive number because of the strong energy condition. This can be easily seen when written in components. :for matter :T_0^0 - \\\\frac{1}{2} T = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\varepsilon + 3p \\\\right) + \\\\frac{\\\\left( p + \\\\varepsilon \\\\right) v^2}{1 - v^2} > 0 :for electromagnetic field : T = 0, \\\\quad T_0^0 = {1 \\\\over 2}\\\\left(\\\\epsilon_0 E^2 + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu_0} B^2 \\\\right) > 0 With the above in mind, the is then re-written as an inequality with the equality pertaining to empty space. Using the algebraic inequality :\\\\varkappa_{\\\\beta}^{\\\\alpha}\\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta} \\\\geq \\\\frac{1} {3}\\\\left(\\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\alpha}\\\\right)^2 becomes :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\alpha}+\\\\frac{1}{6} \\\\left( \\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\alpha} \\\\right)^2 \\\\leq 0. Dividing both sides to \\\\left( \\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\alpha} \\\\right)^2 and using the equality :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\left( \\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\alpha} \\\\right)^2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\alpha} = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\alpha}} one arrives to the inequality \\\\geq {1 \\\\over 6}.}} Let, for example, \\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\alpha} > 0 at some moment of time. Because the derivative is positive, then the ratio \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\alpha}} decreases with decreasing time, always having a finite non-zero derivative and, therefore, it should become zero, coming from the positive side, during a finite time. In other words, \\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\alpha} becomes \\\\+ \\\\infty, and because \\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\alpha} = \\\\partial \\\\ln \\\\gamma / \\\\partial t, this means that the determinant \\\\gamma becomes zero (according to not faster than t^6). If, on the other hand, \\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\alpha} < 0 initially, the same is true for increasing time. An idea about the space at the singularity can be obtained by considering the diagonalized metric tensor. Diagonalization makes the elements of the \\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} matrix everywhere zero except the main diagonal whose elements are the three eigenvalues \\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2 and \\\\lambda_3; these are three real values when the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial is greater or equal to zero or one real and two complex conjugate values when the discriminant is less than zero. Then the determinant \\\\gamma is just the product of the three eigenvalues. If only one of these eigenvalues becomes zero, then the whole determinant is zero. Let, for example, the real eigenvalue becomes zero (\\\\lambda_1 = 0). Then the diagonalized matrix \\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} becomes a 2 √ó 2 matrix with the (generally complex conjugate) eigenvalues \\\\lambda_2, \\\\lambda_3 on the main diagonal. But this matrix is the diagonalized metric tensor of the space where \\\\gamma = 0; therefore, the above suggests that at the singularity (\\\\gamma = 0) the space is 2-dimensional when only one eigenvalue turns to zero. Geometrically, diagonalization is a rotation of the basis for the vectors comprising the matrix in such a way that the direction of basis vectors coincide with the direction of the eigenvectors. If \\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} is a real symmetric matrix, the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis so that the principal axes are edges of a rectangular parallelepiped. The magnitudes of these edges are, in fact, the three eigenvalues which are called length, width, and height. This example is especially demonstrative in that the determinant \\\\gamma which is also the volume of the parallelepiped is equal to length √ó width √ó height, i.e., the product of the eigenvalues. Making the volume of the parallelepiped equal to zero, for example by equating the height to zero, leaves only one face of the parallelepiped, a 2-dimensional space, whose area is length √ó width. Continuing with the obliteration and equating the width to zero, one is left with a line of size length, a 1-dimensional space. Further equating the length to zero leaves only a point, a 0-dimensional space, which marks the place where the parallelepiped has been. Figure 3. An analogy from geometrical optics is comparison of the singularity with caustics (e.g., Landau and Lifshitz ), such as the bright pattern in Fig. 3, which shows caustics formed by a glass of water illuminated from the right side. The light rays coming from the right are an analogue of the time lines of the free-falling observers localized on the synchronized hypersurface. Judging by the approximately parallel sides of the shadow contour cast by the glass, one can surmise that the light source is at a practically infinite distance from the glass (such as the sun) but this is not certain as the light source is not shown on the photo. So one can suppose that the light rays (time lines) are parallel without this being proven with certainty. The glass of water is an analogue of the Einstein equations or the agent(s) behind them that bend the light rays to form the caustics pattern (the singularity). The latter is not so simple as the face of a parallelepiped but is a complicated mix of various kinds of intersections. One can distinguish an overlap of two-, one-, or zero-dimensional spaces, i.e., intermingling of surfaces and lines, some converging to a point (cusp) such as the arrowhead formation in the centre of the caustics pattern. The conclusion that timelike geodesic vector fields must inevitably reach a singularity after a finite time has been reached independently by Raychaudhuri by another method that led to the Raychaudhuri equation, which is also called Landau‚ÄìRaychaudhuri equation to honour both researchers. See also *Normal coordinates *Congruence (general relativity), for a derivation of the kinematical decomposition and of Raychaudhuri's equation.

By 2008, the channel had regularly been one of the twenty most watched channels in Sweden for a few years. From 2007, the channel is also broadcast terrestrially in Norway via the RiksTV package. For its first ten years in existence, the channel used a logo with a globe and an elephant which was also used by its sister channels. On 1 October 2008 the channel switched a new logo, which had previously been adopted by Animal Planet in the United States. A high-definition version of the channel, called Animal Planet HD, was launched on 3 February 2009. That made the Nordic region the first region to get a high-definition version of Animal Planet after the United States. The high-definition channel used to have a separate schedule in order to broadcast only high-definition programmes. Animal Planet Nordic has been replaced by the pan-European feed. The commercials on Animal Planet Europe show three air times depending on the country you live in. The Eastern European time zone is marked with \\"Suomi\\" for Finnish viewers.

Description  The codex contains the text of the Gospel of John on 808 parchment leaves (). The text is written in 1 column per page, 30 lines per page. The text of the Gospel of John is surrounded by a commentary (catena) of Nicetas's authorship. The Greek text of the codex is a mixture of the text types. Aland did not list it to any Category. In John 14:14 it has textual variant ŒµŒ±ŒΩ œÑŒπ Œ±ŒπœÑŒ∑œÉŒ∑œÑŒµ œÑŒøŒΩ œÄŒ±œÑŒµœÅŒ± instead of ŒµŒ±ŒΩ œÑŒπ Œ±ŒπœÑŒ∑œÉŒ∑œÑŒµ ŒºŒµ. The same variant appears in minuscule 397.UBS3, p. 390. It is difficult to date on palaeographical grounds.  History  According to F. H. A. Scrivener and Hermann von Soden the manuscript was written in the 11th century. Currently it is dated by the INTF to the 12th century. Formerly the manuscript was held at the Pantokrator monastery at Athos peninsula (as codex 74). It was brought to Moscow, by the monk Arsenius, on the suggestion of the Patriarch Nikon, in the reign of Alexei Mikhailovich Romanov (1645-1676). It was examined by Matthaei and Treu.

Life He studied in London's St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral School, and at a young age entered the household of John Colet. He learned classics from William Lilye, and then went to Pembroke Hall, Cambridge.Peter G. Bietenholz, Thomas Brian Deutscher, Contemporaries of Erasmus: A Biographical Register of the Renaissance and Reformation (2003), p. 357-9. In Cambridge Lupset worked closely with Desiderius Erasmus, on New Testament and patristic texts. He may then have travelled to Italy with Richard Pace. From 1519 he was supported by Cardinal Wolsey at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, as a reader in humanities, as successor to John Clement. He then was given church livings and lectured in Greek. He was tutor to Thomas Wynter, Wolsey's son. Works A friend of Thomas More, Erasmus, Thomas Linacre, Budaeus, Reginald Pole, and John Leland, he did editorial work and saw books through the press for them. He was the supervisor of Linacre's editions of Galen's treatises, and of the second edition of More's Utopia. His own works, mainly letters, translation and moral treatises, were collected for publication in 1545. A dialogue between Reginald Pole and Thomas Lupset is an imagined work of political theory by Thomas Starkey. It is set at Bisham Abbey, and may be based on an actual visit of Lupset to Pole there in 1529. It is in the tradition of Utopia, and of Thomas Elyot's almost contemporary The Boke named the Governour.Roy Porter, Mikul√°≈° Teich (editors), The Renaissance in National Context (1992), p. 156.

The sparsely settled region of the Southern Alps shook for four minutes. Tremors continued almost continuously until midnight and sporadic strong aftershocks were felt for several days. The earthquake was measured at 7.1 on the Richter magnitude scale and the intensity of shaking in the epicentral region has been assessed from historical records as VIII (Severe) on the Modified Mercalli Scale. Intensities of VI (Strong) were observed in Christchurch and Westport. The earthquake occurred on the Poulter Fault, which was not identified and mapped until 2001. Tectonic setting New Zealand lies along the boundary between the Australian and Pacific plates. In the South Island most of the relative displacement between these plates is taken up along a single dextral (right lateral) strike-slip fault with a major reverse component, the Alpine Fault. In the North Island the displacement is mainly taken up along the Kermadec- Tonga subduction zone, although the remaining dextral strike-slip component is accommodated by the North Island Fault System.Mouslopoulou,V., Nicol,A., Little, T.A. & Walsh, J.J. 2007. Terminations of large strike-slip faults: an alternative model from New Zealand. In: Cunningham, W. D. & Mann, P (eds).Tectonics of Strike-Slip Restraining and Releasing Bends. Geological Society of London, Special Publication, 290; p. 387‚Äì415. The Poulter Fault runs for approximately 50 km Northeast from the junction of the Bealey and Mahinga rivers to the valley of the Hurunui River. Between 16 km and 36 km of the fault ruptured, with dextral displacement of up to 4 metres and dip-slip displacement of 1‚Äì2 metres (North side up). Effects Numerous landslides were triggered, damaging the Midland Railway and blocking roads. The highway connecting Canterbury and the West Coast via Arthur's Pass was closed for several months. Many water tanks and chimneys were damaged or toppled. Two years after the earthquake, trampers in the Otahake Valley discovered that a 900m high section of the side of a mountain had collapsed, blocking the valley and sending debris 5 km downstream. Although () this is one of the ten largest land-based earthquakes to strike New Zealand since European settlement, it was overshadowed by the more deadly 1929 Murchison earthquake a few months later.

Of the 3,637 species found worldwide, some 35 species in 10 families are native to the British Isles. One of these species, Acaeroplastes melanurus, had been considered extinct in the British Isles but was rediscovered in 2002 at its only site (Howth, County Dublin, Ireland), and a further ten species have become naturalised in greenhouses, presumably transported with exotic plants. accessed through the NERC Open Access Research Archive (NORA) Five species are especially common throughout the British Isles, and are known as the \\"famous five species\\". They are Oniscus asellus (the common shiny woodlouse), Porcellio scaber (the common rough woodlouse), Philoscia muscorum (the common striped woodlouse), Trichoniscus pusillus (the common pygmy woodlouse) and Armadillidium vulgare (the common pill bug). One species, Metatrichoniscoides celticus, is endemic to Glamorgan, and is listed as a vulnerable species in the IUCN Red List. ArmadillidaeReductoniscus costulatus Kessely√°k, 1930= ;Not native to the British Isles Reductoniscus costulatus occurs naturally in the Seychelles, on Mauritius, in Malaysia and in the Hawaiian Islands, but has been introduced to several parts of Europe, where it survives in greenhouses. Armadillidiidae Armadillidium vulgare Armadillidium vulgare in the rolled-up defensive posture characteristic of pill bugs \\"Pill bugs\\" of the family Armadillidiidae are often confused with pill millipedes such as Glomeris marginata, which is also widespread and common in Britain and Ireland, but pill millipedes have two pairs of legs per body segment, while woodlice have only seven pairs of legs. Six certainly native species occur in the British Isles; some doubt exists as to the status of Eluma caelatum. =Armadillidium album Dollfus, 1887= Armadillidium album is a pale-coloured species, and does not roll itself into a ball when disturbed. Rather, it remains stationary, but with its body slightly arched. It is only found at coastal sites, chiefly in sand dunes, having been first discovered in Britain at the Taw and Torridge estuaries in Devon in 1906. It is found from the Netherlands along the Atlantic coast of Europe to the Mediterranean, where it reaches as far east as Greece. =Armadillidium depressum Brandt, 1833= Armadillidium depressum is a large pill bug, up to long. Females are somewhat variable in colour, but males are uniformly slate grey. It cannot roll up into a perfect ball, but leaves its antennae and telson exposed. In the British Isles, it is only found in South West England and South Wales, but is also found in Belgium, France and Italy. =Armadillidium nasatum Budde-Lund, 1885= Like the previous species, Armadillidium nasatum cannot roll up into a perfect ball; it too leaves its antennae and telson exposed. As well as being introduced to North America, it is found natively from Italy and northern Spain to the Netherlands and Britain, where it is widely distributed across the southern half of the country. Armadillidium pictum =Armadillidium pictum Brandt, 1833= Armadillidium pictum occurs over most of Europe, where it is chiefly a forest species. In the British Isles, it is only known from a few sites, all remote from human habitation, in Cumbria and Powys. It closely resembles A. pulchellum, but it is darker in colour, with less distinct mottling, which is arranged in lines along the length of the body. It is also, at up to long, slightly larger than A. pulchellum. =Armadillidium pulchellum (Zenker, 1798)= Armadillidium pulchellum may reach in length, and is covered with mosaic patterns of black, white, orange and red. The British Isles hold the greatest concentration of sites for this species, which also extends across Northern and Western Europe. In Great Britain, it is found on coastal cliffs and in upland areas, being particularly associated with Thymus spp.; in Ireland, its ecological tendencies are different, often being found in calcareous glacial sites, particularly eskers. =Armadillidium vulgare (Latreille, 1804)= Armadillidium vulgare is the most common and thus the most well known of the pill bugs. It grows up to long, and is a uniform grey colour. Its abundance tails off to the north and west, and is not known to occur north of a line between the estuaries of the River Clyde and the River Tay in Scotland, or north-west of a line between Galway and Lough Foyle in Ireland. It is associated with sand dunes in the more north-westerly parts of its range, but is often replaced on Carboniferous limestone by the related species Armadillidium pulchellum. Beyond Britain, it is found throughout Europe and parts of Asia, and has been introduced to North America, Australia, South Africa and some islands in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. =Eluma caelatum (Miers, 1877)= Eluma caelatum (previously Eluma purpurascens) is typically , but exceptionally up to long. The body is purplish brown, with a pair of single large, black ocelli and a triangular telson. It is abundant on cliffs on Ireland's east coast, although it is also found beside railway lines away from the sea, suggesting it was introduced with railway ballast. In 1975, the species was discovered for the first time in Great Britain, and was originally known from two sites: Overstrand, Norfolk and near Herne Bay, Kent, both sites being coastal cliffs of soft rock. It is now known to occur at numerous locations in south-east England (mainly Kent and Essex) including several non-coastal, man-made habitats.National Biodiversity Network (NBN Gateway) web-site It is found outside the British Isles on Atlantic coasts south to north-western Africa, as well as the Canary Islands, Azores and Madeira. It has been introduced to Tasmania and to French Guiana, from where the type specimen hails. CylisticidaeCylisticus convexus (De Geer, 1778)= Cylisticus convexus, the \\"curly woodlouse\\", has a scattered distribution across the British Isles. It seems to occur either in coastal sites, or synanthropically in anthropogenic habitats. It has been introduced to sites across the New World, from Canada to Argentina. Halophilosciidae Haplophilosciidae is a family of woodlice lacking pleopodal lungs. Its members are therefore restricted to coastal habitats. =Halophiloscia couchii (Kinahan, 1858)= Haplophiloscia couchii is a coastal species which is almost never seen in daylight. It was originally described from Talland Bay, Cornwall, but is found as far south as Dakar (Senegal) and has also been introduced to North America, South America and Australia. =Stenophiloscia glarearum Verhoeff, 1908= Stenophiloscia glarearum (formerly S. zosterae) is less than long and white, with a distinctly spiny dorsal surface. In the British Isles, it is only known from three sites: Slapton Ley, Scolt Head Island and Goldhanger, Essex. Outside Britain, the species is only known from the Canary Islands and Mediterranean coasts from Spain to Malta and Greece. Ligiidae Ligia oceanica at Portishead, Somerset =Ligia oceanica (Linnaeus, 1767)= Ligia oceanica, the sea slater, is the largest of the British woodlice, reaching a length of up to . It is found on rocky shores throughout the British Isles. Its wider range extends from Norway to Morocco, and has since been introduced to North America. =Ligidium hypnorum (Cuvier, 1792)= In the British Isles, Ligidium hypnorum is restricted to the south and east of England, being particularly frequent in Kent and Surrey, but with further populations in East Anglia, western Gloucestershire and North Somerset. It grows up to and is dark and shiny in appearance. It is found mainly in deciduous woodland, especially ancient woodland, and in fens. Outside Britain, it is distributed across Central Europe as far east as the Black Sea. Oniscidae Oniscus asellus =Oniscus asellus Linnaeus, 1758= Oniscus asellus, the \\"common shiny woodlouse\\", is the most widespread species of woodlouse in the British Isles, both geographically and ecologically. It is not known from the Mediterranean Basin, but is widespread in Northern and Western Europe, as far east as the Ukraine, as well as in the Azores and Madeira; it has also been widely introduced in the Americas. It is one of the largest native woodlice in Britain, at up to long. It is relatively flat, and is a shiny patchy grey in colour. Philosciidae Philoscia muscorum =Burmoniscus meeusei (Holthuis, 1947)= ;Not native to the British Isles Originally described under the name Chaetophiloscia meeusei from greenhouses at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Burmoniscus meeusei is now known to occur in the wild in Brazil, Hawaii and Taiwan. =Philoscia muscorum (Scopoli, 1763)= Philoscia muscorum, the \\"common striped woodlouse\\" or \\"fast woodlouse\\", is up to long, with a greyish-brown, mottled, shiny body, and long legs, which allow it to move quickly. It is more common in the south of the British Isles, but can be found up to the north coast of Scotland. =Setaphora patiencei (Bagnall, 1908)= ;Not native to the British Isles Although the generic placement of this species is uncertain, it is known to occur in the wild in Mauritius and R√©union, and is now established in greenhouses in England. Porcellionidae Porcellio scaber =Acaeroplastes melanurus (Budde-Lund, 1885)= Acaeroplastes melanurus is known from much of southern Europe, from Croatia to Spain and the Azores, and including Algeria. In the British Isles, it is only known from cliffs at Howth, County Dublin, where it was found several times between 1909 and 1934. The species was rediscovered in 2002, and further study showed that a substantial population still exists. =Agabiformius lentus (Budde-Lund, 1885)= ;Not native to the British Isles Agabiformius lentus is native to the Mediterranean region, but has been widely introduced outside that range. Porcellio dilatatus =Porcellio dilatatus Brandt, 1833= Porcellio dilatatus is a widespread species, although only abundant at a few restricted sites. It is large and wide, with a rounded tip to the telson in adults. =Porcellio laevis Latreille, 1804= Porcellio laevis is, when fully grown, the largest of the Porcellio species in the British Isles, at up to long. It may be in decline due to the reduced availability of its preferred habitat; it was formerly common around horse dung. It is more common in warmer climates, and is found across Europe and North Africa, as well as having been introduced to many other parts of the world. =Porcellio scaber Latreille, 1804= Porcellio scaber, the \\"common rough woodlouse\\", is one of the most frequent woodlice in the British Isles. It is also one of the best colonisers, having become established from Iceland to South America and South Africa. Adults may reach long. =Porcellio spinicornis Say, 1818= Porcellio spinicornis Porcellio spinicornis is confined to stone walls and buildings, with a tendency to avoid areas with a strong Atlantic climatic influence. It is distinctively marked, with two rows of yellow marks along the body against a brown background with a darker median stripe and a blackish head. Its wider distribution covers much of Europe, but little of the Mediterranean region, eastwards to Ukraine; it has also been introduced to Canada and the United States. =Porcellionides cingendus (Kinahan, 1857)= Porcellionides cingendus has an Atlantic, or Lusitanian distribution, stretching from Portugal to the British Isles, and reaching its northernmost location at St. John's Point, (near Killough) County Down. It partly replaces Philoscia muscorum where it occurs, and the two are easily confused in the field; Porcellionides cingendus, however, is narrower, and has a matt, not shiny, body. =Porcellionides pruinosus (Brandt, 1833)= Porcellionides pruinosus is quite different from P. cingendus and the two are unlikely to be confused in the field. P. pruinosus has a characteristic dusty bloom and very pale legs. Although there is some doubt as to its native status in Britain, P. pruinosus has been found in Roman remains in London, indicating that if it was introduced, it was not introduced recently. The species is predominantly Mediterranean in its distribution, but has taken on a cosmopolitan distribution through the actions of man. PlatyarthridaePlatyarthrus hoffmannseggi Brandt, 1833= Platyarthrus hoffmannseggi Platyarthrus hoffmannseggi is closely associated with ants' nests, particularly those of Lasius flavus, Lasius niger and species of Myrmica. It has a distinctive oval shape and short antennae. Its distribution appears to follow those of the ants with which it lives, and the British Isles are the north-westerly limit of its range. Elsewhere, P. hoffmannseggi extends south to the Mediterranean. It is found outside Europe in North Africa and Turkey, and has been introduced to North America. =Trichorhina tomentosa (Budde- Lund, 1893)= ;Not native to the British Isles Trichorhina tomentosa is the only species of woodlouse originating in the Americas to have become established in the British Isles, where it survives in greenhouses. StyloniscidaeCordioniscus stebbingi (Patience, 1907)= ;Not native to the British Isles The native range of Cordioniscus stebbingi is restricted to eastern Spain. It has, however, been introduced to greenhouses worldwide. =Styloniscus spinosus (Patience, 1907)= ;Not native to the British Isles Styloniscus spinosus is native to Mauritius, R√©union, Madagascar and Hawaii, but is found in some greenhouses in Great Britain. TrachelipodidaeNagurus cristatus (Dollfus, 1881)= ;Not native to the British Isles Nagurus cristatus has a pantropical distribution, and is found in greenhouses in temperate climates, including in the British Isles. =Nagurus nanus Budde- Lund, 1908= ;Not native to the British Isles Nagurus nanus is found throughout the tropics in anthropogenic habitats. Trachelipus rathkii =Trachelipus rathkii (Brandt, 1833)= Trachelipus rathkei is sometimes confused with the more frequent Porcellio scaber, although its markings, with a regular longitudinal pattern of a light colour on a grey-brown background, are distinctive. They can be distinguished by examining the number of pleopodal lungs on the animal's underside with a hand lens ‚Äì species of Porcellio have only two pairs, while T. rathkei has five pairs. Trichoniscidae Androniscus dentiger =Androniscus dentiger Verhoeff, 1908= Androniscus dentiger is readily recognisable by its distinctive pink colour, with a widening yellow stripe towards the rear. Adults are up to long. It is found at cliff sites, in scree and in caves, as well as in anthropogenic habitats. It is found as far south as North Africa and east to Croatia, and has been introduced to North America. =Buddelundiella cataractae Verhoeff, 1930= Buddelundiella cataractae is an inconspicuous woodlouse, up to long and similar in appearance to a grain of sand when rolled up. Within Britain, it is only known from Cardiff, Barry and a site near Snettisham, Norfolk, although it has a wide distribution in Europe, possibly reaching as far east as Georgia. =Haplophthalmus danicus Budde-Lund, 1880= Haplophthalmus danicus is reasonably widely distributed in the British Isles, but is rare outside South East England. It is a pale animal, up to long, with longitudinal ridges along its body. It is found throughout Europe, in Turkey, North America, Japan and several islands in the Atlantic Ocean. =Haplophthalmus mengii (Zaddach, 1844)= Haplophthalmus mengei has a narrower body than H. danicus, but is a similar size and colour. It is found mostly in coastal or limestone-rich sites. Outside Britain, the species is thought to occur as far east as Austria and Poland. =Metatrichoniscoides celticus Oliver & Trew, 1981= ;Endemic to the British Isles Metatrichoniscoides celticus is the smallest of the British woodlice, at only long. It is white in appearance and is only known to occur along a stretch of the Glamorgan coast. It was discovered perhaps as late as 1979, and is listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List because of its small population size. =Miktoniscus linearis (Patience, 1908)= ;Not native to the British Isles Miktoniscus linearis is not believed to be a native British species, although so far it is only known from greenhouses in England and Germany. =Miktoniscus patiencei Vandel, 1946= Miktoniscus patiencei is found in soils and shingles just above the strand line of salt marshes and sea cliffs. It is small, at in length, and white. It has been found quite widely along the south coasts of England and Ireland, and also at a site in Kincardineshire. Elsewhere in Europe, it is known from the English Channel coasts of Brittany and from the Channel Islands. =Oritoniscus flavus (Budde-Lund, 1906)= Oritoniscus flavus is, despite the implication in its name, a dark purple or maroon colour, and can thus be told apart from the paler Trichoniscus pusillus. It is also, at long, slightly larger. It has a wide head and a tapering body, producing a shape reminiscent of a trilobite. It is rare in Great Britain, being found only in south Wales and in Midlothian in Scotland, but is widespread in Ireland, and is found further afield in the Pyrenees, leading to speculation that the species may be part of the \\"Lusitanian fauna\\". =Trichoniscoides albidus (Budde-Lund, 1880)= As with the previous species, Trichoniscoides albidus has a misleading specific epithet, since in life it is reddish-purple. It is similar to Trichoniscus pusillus, but its exoskeleton is dull, unlike the shiny surface in Trichoniscus pusillus. It is found in areas with an Atlantic climate from France to southern Sweden. =Trichoniscoides saeroeensis Lohmander, 1923= Trichoniscoides saeroeensis is distinctively coloured, with a pink pleon, but a white pereon, and with red or pink ocelli. It is widely distributed around British and Irish coasts, and is also known from Brittany, Denmark and Sweden. =Trichoniscoides sarsi Patience, 1908= Trichoniscoides sarsi resembles the previous species, but has noticeable orange or pink patches on either side of its rear; unlike T. saeroeensis, however, T. sarsi is found inland. It seems to tolerate cold especially well, and has been recorded outside the British Isles from France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, and has also been introduced to Newfoundland. Trichoniscus pusillus =Trichoniscus pusillus Brandt, 1833= Trichoniscus pusillus, the \\"common pygmy woodlouse\\", is widespread in Europe north of the Alps, and has been introduced to Madeira, the Azores and North America. In the south of its range, T. pusillus reproduces sexually, but towards the north of its range, parthenogenesis predominates. It is the most abundant woodlouse species in Britain, and extremely widespread, occurring as far north as the northernmost tip of Shetland. It is shiny in appearance and reddish-brown in colour, with white patches visible on close inspection, where muscles attach to the exoskeleton. It reaches a maximum size of long. =Trichoniscus pygmaeus Sars, 1899= Trichoniscus pygmaeus is perhaps the most under-recorded British woodlouse species, since it lives deeply buried in the soil, and adults resemble immature individuals of the very abundant Trichoniscus pusillus. It is found from Morocco, across Europe, to south-western Russia (Krasnodar Krai).

Mestwin's son, the Pomerelian duke Ratibor (Racibor Bia≈Çogardzki), made Bia≈Çogarda his residence between 1233 and 1262. After Ratibor had invaded the adjacent Stolpe Land, then held by his elder brother Duke Swietopelk II, his castle was devastated in the following fratricidal war within the ruling Samborides dynasty.

Advertising Solutions Help, Accessed July 15, 2013 (called Quality Index), and BingQuality score: What it is and why it matters Bing Ads Help, Retrieved September 19, 2018. that influences ad rank and cost per click (CPC) of ads. To determine the position of the ad on a search engine, each ad is allocated using a process which takes into account the bid and the Quality Score. Ads are then listed in descending order based on the result of that equation. The exact weight of Quality Score versus bid has not been revealed by any of the major search engines, and each company has stated that they reserve the right to continually adjust their ranking methodologies. In late 2008, Google revealed that Quality Score was used to determine which ads it would show above organic results, and that a high quality score could actually cause ads to jump over ads with lower quality scores that would otherwise not merit that prominent placement. Purpose The major search engines have each independently implemented efforts to maintain and improve the quality of ads listed on their sites. The primary reason for this is to improve the experience of users who click on paid advertising links. It is reasonable to assume that users who have a great experience when clicking on ads will click on them more frequently, thus increasing advertising revenues for the search engine. In addition, Google chose to introduce variable minimum bids at the same time as it introduced Quality-Based Bidding. On the surface, this new feature allowed advertisers to bid as little as $0.01 to have their ad shown. However, in some cases advertisers found their minimum bids for some ads were raised to as high as $5.00 or $10.00. By implementing variable minimum bids Google created a mechanism whereby the company could set different minimums for different advertisers for the same keyword, and potentially increase the average minimum bid without the advertising community as a whole being made aware. Furthermore, by raising minimums bids, Google could test each advertiser's ability to pay these increases, thus increasing competitiveness within the auctions and extracting maximum revenue from each advertiser. Factors in determining Quality Score There are a number of factors that determine the Quality Score of a given ad. While each search engine has released directional information on the factors most important to them, presumably in an effort to guide their advertisers towards making better ads, none has revealed their formulas in detail. Below is a summary of what has been released: =Click- through rate= All three search engines have revealed that a major factor - the most important factor to Google \\\\- in their respective Quality Score formulas is the historical click-through rate (CTR) of the keyword and matched ad. In fact, prior to its introduction of Quality Score in July 2005, Google determined ad rank by running the following formula against each ad and sorting them in descending order: bid * CTR. In addition to the CTR of the keyword and matched ad itself, Google takes into account the overall historic CTR of the entire AdWords account as well as the historic CTR of the display URLs in the ad group. =Ad copy relevance= All three search engines have revealed that the relevance of the ad copy to the keyword is a factor in determining Quality Score. Therefore, it can be assumed that ads with ad copy that contains the keyword will have a higher Quality Score than ads with ad copy that does not contain the keyword. =Landing page quality= All three search engines have revealed that landing page quality is a factor in determining Quality Score. Landing page quality generally refers to whether or not the page contains relevant and original content and the navigability of the site.How do I create a high quality landing page? AdWords Help, Accessed February 23, 2009 In the case of MSN, they have revealed that ads with landing pages that don't contain the keyword may be declined altogether. =Landing page load time= In June 2008 Google revealed that landing page load time impacts Quality Score.Inside AdWords: Landing page load time now affects keywords' Quality Scores Official AdWords Blog, Accessed February 23, 2009 =Geographical considerations= Google has revealed that the accounts performance in the geographical region where the ad will be shown impacts Quality Score. =Other factors= All three search engines have revealed that other factors are taken into consideration when calculating Quality Score.
