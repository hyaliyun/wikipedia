He was also a banker, and employed by the English government, as well as being an agent for the Italians appointed as Bishop of Worcester.Alistair Fox, Thomas More: History and Providence (1982), note p. 134. He was on good terms with the English humanists of the time, and a close friend of Thomas More. Life His family was settled in England before his time, and he perhaps was born there, as his denization does not appear to be on the patent rolls. In 1513 he was already a thriving merchant, and laying the foundation of the great wealth for which he was famous. In that year he received from the king, Henry VIII, a remission of customs for five years in repayment of a loan to the crown. He dealt largely in wool, and also imported jewels and other foreign articles, for which Cardinal Wolsey was one of his principal customers. He acted as banker for the government, transmitting money and letters to ambassadors in France, Italy, and elsewhere, and sometimes through his correspondents obtaining earlier news of foreign events than the government did. He was a patron and friend of learned men, more especially of those who had visited and studied in Italy. Thomas Starkey, Thomas Wynter, Florence Volusenus, and others express their obligations to him. Sir Thomas More, in one of his last letters from the Tower of London, speaks of himself as having been for nearly forty years 'not a guest, but a continual nursling of the house of Bonvisi,' and styles Antonio the most faithful of his friends. Reginald Pole also spoke highly of him; when Mary came to the throne, Bonvisi acted as intermediary with Pole.Thomas S. Freeman, Thomas Frederick Mayer, Martyrs and Martyrdom in England, C.1400-1700 (2007), note p. 14. He helped William Peto, who had fled to the Low Countries after preaching a sermon against King Henry VIII. He resided at London, in Crosby Hall, Bishopsgate Street (Crosbyes Place it was then called).http://www.gardenvisit.com/book/london_and_its_environs_1927/13_chelsea/crosby_hall He at first leased it from the priory of St. Helen's, a lease he bought from More. After the dissolution of the priory, he purchased it from the king, together with a house in St. Mary Axe and the site of a friary in Moulsham, near Chelmsford. This was in the period 1538 to 1542. The house in St. Mary Axe he sold to Balthazar Guercy, a distinguished fellow of the College of Physicians, and formerly medical attendant to Queen Catherine of Aragon. At the beginning of the reign of Edward VI he settled his affairs, and later left for the continent; the lease of Crosby House he made over to his tenants William Roper and William Rastell, and he also conveyed the ownership; but almost all involved were Catholics who went into exile before he did.Philip Norman and William Douglas Car√∂e, Crosby Place (1908), pp. 21-4. The house, with those of Dr John Clement and Guercy, was seized by the sheriffs of London, on 7 February 1550, and came into the hands of Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy of Temple Hurst. Bonvisi soon recovered it, during the reign of Queen Mary. In the general pardon which concluded the acts of the parliament of 7 Edward VI (1553) he was specially excepted, together with Cardinal Pole, the two doctors above mentioned, John Story, and a few others. He died on 7 December 1558, and was buried at Leuven, leaving a nephew Benedict Bonvisi, son of his brother Martin, to inherit his English property.

The newer part, the hamlet of Sap, stands along the main road from Vrhnika to Ljubljana. Name Sinja Gorica was first mentioned in written sources in 1414 under the German name Sweinpuhel (literally, 'pig hill'), and as Sweinp≈Øhel in 1418, Singa goriza in 1474, and Sweinpuhl in 1496. Based on the oldest transcriptions of the name, it is likely that the Slovene name is derived from the adjective *svin—å(j—å) 'pig' and that the name may have referred to a hill where pigs foraged.

After the First World War Ocypel found itself again in Poland. During World War II the village was called Reu√überg. In 1944, soldiers of the underground shot the deputy chief of the secret German state police Gestapo from Tczew in Ocypel. In the German retaliation (by the order of the then chief of the Gestapo in Gdansk), more than twenty Poles were shot publicly (residents of Ocypel and surrounding areas, as well as members of the AK (Armia Krajowa = Home Army) intelligence network from Pomerania, brought from the Stutthof concentration camp). During the German occupation in 1944 in the forests surrounding the Ocypel there was a clash of Pomeranian M4 troops with German troops. After World War II, the forest areas of the Tucholskie Forests around the Ocypla became the operational area of the anti-communist guerillas.

Formed in 1857, the Fenians' plan was to attack British colonies in North America, thereby forcing Britain to send troops, weakening her defenses in Ireland.The Fenian Raids, by Matthew Farfan, Quebec Anglo Heritage Network, http://townshipsheritage.com/article/fenian-raids Fenian raids into Canada occurred in 1866 (New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec), 1870 (Quebec) and 1871 (Manitoba). The Fenian threat helped forge a sense of unity among the British North American colonies, and added impetus to the move toward Canadian confederation, which occurred July 1, 1867, a year after the initial raid. Opposed to the Fenian raids into Canada, although not unsympathetic to their cause of freedom for Ireland, Devlin was for fifteen years (1851-1866) closely identified with the active volunteer militia force.The Canadian Parliamentary Companion and Annual Register; Mackintosh, 1878, www.canadiana.org The militia also functioned as a further point of social activity and provided a platform for his political aspirations.George Rex Crowley Keep, \\"The Irish Migration to Montreal, 1847-67\\" (M.A. dissertation, McGill University, 1948); Sherry Olson and Patricia Thornton, \\"The Challenge of the Irish Catholic Community in Nineteenth-Century Montreal,\\" Histoire sociale/Social History, forthcoming; Rosalyn Trigger, \\"The Geopolitics of the Irish-Catholic Parish in Nineteenth- Century Montreal,\\" Journal of Historical Geography 27:4 (2001), 553-72 Devlin organized an Irish Company for the 1st, or Prince of Wales Rifle Regiment, serving initially as a captain, later as Lieutenant-Colonel, of the unit. In this capacity he commanded the regiment during the Fenian raids of 1866, assigned to guard the border from Huntingdon to Hemmingford, Quebec, opposite New York State. For his services Devlin was publicly commended by Charles Stanley, Lord Monck, then Governor-General of Canada.

Ultimately, Devlin went on to serve as President of the St. Patrick's Society for over ten years, the longest term of office held by any president of that association, which is still active (2013). He was elected in 1860, 1865, 1870 and finally in 1874.The Irish in Quebec, An Introduction to the Historiography, by Robert Grace,1993 It was in his capacity as a firmly entrenched leader maintaining a broad base of Irish nationalist support in the Montreal Irish community,The Fenians in Montreal, 1862-68: invasion, intrigue, and assassination, 2003, by Wilson, David A., University of Toronto that Devlin played a key role in the introduction of Thomas D'Arcy McGee to the St. Patrick's Society following his emigration to Canada from the United States in 1857, securing for McGee the support of Irish voters, and arranging his alliance with the so-called \\"anglo- rouges\\" in the election of 1857‚Äì58,Dr. Tumblety, the Indian Herb Doctor, by Michael McCulloch, Department of Philosophy, History and Politics, University College of the Cariboo, Kamloops, British Columbia, CBMH/BCHM/Volume 10:1993 / p. 53-54 an election that McGee went on to win. McGee, the ex \\"Young Irelander\\" rebel of 1848, had left the United States after becoming disillusioned with American republicanism and the position of the Irish there.Library and Archives Canada, Thomas D'Arcy McGee, Following this promising start, the relationship between McGee and Devlin, and the broader mass of immigrant Irish voters in Montreal, deteriorated. In a speech given at Wexford, Ireland, in 1865, McGee came down heavily against Irish nationalism, describing the Young Irelanders with whom he had once shared common cause as a \\"pack of fools,\\" castigating the Fenians as \\"Punch-and-Judy Jacobins,\\" and arguing that the Irish in Canada possessed greater personal freedom, economic advantage, and religious equality within the British empire, than in the United States at the time. The Wexford speech enraged Irish republican- nationalists, especially in Canada, and by 1866 McGee's standing with his Irish constituents in Montreal, if not the conservative establishment sectors of society, had eroded significantly. The Fenians moved to take advantage of the situation, making inroads into the St. Patrick's Society, gathering support, and challenging their conservative opponents.Dublin Evening Mail, 16 May 1865; David A. Wilson, \\"Thomas D'Arcy McGee's Wexford Speech of 1865: Reflections on Revolutionary Nationalism and the Irish in North America,\\" Canadian Journal of Irish Studies 26:2/27:1 (Fall 2000/Spring 2001), 9-24  Devlin-McGee confrontation  Bernard Devlin, Esq., QC, MP, by J. Walker, 1880 Book Review by Patrick Barthe, Nuacht, November 1993, of: The Irish in Quebec: An Introduction to the Historiography, by Robert J. Grace As the federal general election of 1867 approached, Devlin, the incumbent president of the St. Patrick's Society, declared that he would oppose McGee in the riding of Montreal West, running for the Liberals against McGee's Liberal-Conservatives. For their part the Fenians believed a Devlin victory would remove their now greatest enemy from the political scene and advance their cause. Devlin was not a Fenian. He was vocal in his praise for the new Dominion of Canada, wrapped up his speeches with three cheers for Queen Victoria, and had demonstrated his commitment to his new country by helping lead the defence of the Quebec border against Fenian invasion. Nonetheless he was an Irish nationalist and sympathized with its more radical republican elements. Seeing an opportunity to make common cause, he invited Montreal's Fenians to join his campaign. Fenians such as Henry Murphy and Francis Bernard McNamee served on Devlin's election committee, while W.B. Linehan and Daniel Lyons were among Devlin's most active backers.Montreal Herald, 12, 24 July, 9, 22 Aug. 1867; McGee, \\"Account of Attempts,\\" Montreal Gazette, 22 Aug. 1867; Canadian Freeman, 21 May 1868 The stakes were high, and the campaign that followed was brutal. Physical intimidation was used by Devlin's supporters to stop McGee men (women did not have the vote) from entering polling stations. In turn, McGee's people used economic intimidation to stop voters turning out for Devlin. McGee cited secret documents concerning Fenian organization, development and tactics employed to establish itself in Montreal, the details of which were given broad distribution by the establishment press, and later demonstrated to be largely accurate. Devlin countered by condemning McGee as a \\"foul informer, a corrupt witness, a knave, and a hypocrite\\", and denounced him as a modern-day Titus Oates. Claims, counter-claims, accusations and condemnations flew back and forth in the press.McGee, \\"Account of Attempts,\\" Montreal Gazette, 17, 20, 22 Aug. 1867; Montreal Herald, 24 July, 9, 19, 22 Aug., 7 Sept. 1867, 27, 28, 29 Sept. 1882 In the end, drawing on establishment support, McGee managed to squeak out a win on election day, but only by 197 votes (2,675 to 2,478). In the heavily Irish St. Ann's and St. Lawrence's wards, Devlin had edged out McGee by 70 votes. The Montreal Herald, summing up the matter, reported that \\"the persons who voted against McGee were not of those who are usually called the respectable classes\\". Physical intimidation by Devlin men of McGee supporters and even police during the polling included outright beatings and the near-death of a police officer. When the results came through, Devlin's supporters rioted outside McGee's campaign headquarters, and shots were fired on both sides. Several weeks later, Devlin spat in McGee's face when the two encountered each other in the street.Trial of Patrick J. Whelan (Ottawa, 1868), 31-32; Montreal Herald, 7, 9 Sept., 7 Oct. 1867; Clerk, \\"Diary Excerpts,\\" 2 Oct. 1867 (Thomas D'Arcy McGee Collection, PO 30, Concordia University Archives); Montreal Gazette, 2 Oct. 1867 Nonetheless, McGee went on to become a Father of Confederation (July 1, 1867). Were it not for the non-Irish support for McGee, the course of Canadian history might have been remarkably different.Patrick Barthe writing in Nuacht, the magazine of the St. Patrick's Society, November 1993. The election of 1867 had generated strong passions. McGee had received death threats and been assigned police protection. The Fenians, although not constituting the majority of Devlin's supporters, had nonetheless played a significant role during the election and fallen not far short of achieving their goal of defeating McGee. Denied that outcome, the Fenian members of the St. Patrick's Society instead moved a motion to expel McGee from the Society, and stopped its subscription to the pro-McGee Canadian Freeman.St. Patrick's Society Minute Book, entries for 7 Oct.1867, 27 Jan. 1868 Among the militant Devlin supporters during the 1867 election campaign was an Ottawa tailor by the name of Patrick James Whelan, who had previously declared that McGee was a traitor, that he should be shot, and that if no one else would do the job, he would do it himself.Trial of Patrick J. Whelan (Ottawa, 1868), 31-32; Montreal Herald, 7, 9 Sept., 7 Oct. 1867; Clerk, \\"Diary Excerpts,\\" 2 Oct. 1867 (Thomas D'Arcy McGee Collection, PO 30, Concordia University Archives); Montreal Gazette, 2 Oct. 1867 On April 7, 1868, McGee was shot dead on Sparks Street in Ottawa, a crime for which Whelan was later convicted, and hung. Following McGee's assassination, support for Fenianism declined, although the movement retained enough sway among Irish Americans to attempt another invasion of Canada in 1870 from Vermont into the eastern townships of Quebec, where it was decisively defeated at the battle of Eccles Hill (May 25, 1870). Nonetheless its strategy of working within a broad Irish nationalist coalition began to come apart. In Montreal, attempts by the Fenians to hold rallies in the months following the assassination were not well received. The assassination had alienated some members of the movement, and many of the movement's broader- minded allies, among them Bernard Devlin who, significantly, deprecated a meeting proposed for September 1868 as \\"a most mischievous and objectionable undertaking\\" which would damage the position of Irish Catholics in Montreal, whereupon his former Fenian supporters condemned him as a traitor and turncoat.The Fenians in Montreal, 1862-68: invasion, intrigue, and assassination, 2003, by Wilson, David A., University of TorontoBernard Devlin, MP, Speaking at Liberal Party Headquarters, rue St. Joseph, Montreal, on the Night of His Election, January 12, 1875  Service in the House of Commons  1867:Records of the Parliament of Canada, http://www.parl.gc.ca/The Canadian Parliamentary Companion and Annual Register; Mackintosh, 1878, www.canadiana.org Ran as a Liberal against D'Arcy McGee (Liberal-Conservative) in the riding of Montreal West.

Speeches: Devlin's first speech was delivered on February 12, 1875 in support of amnesty for Louis Riel and Ambroise-Dydime L√©pine. On March 8, 1875 he took an important part in the debate on a motion by John Costigan in favour of separate schools in New Brunswick. One of Devlin's most famous speeches was given on 19 March 1877, in which he proposed a study be made of the feasibility of giving better representation to minorities through a transformation of the electoral system.Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online, by J.C. Bonenfant, www.biographi.ca  Community  Outside his profession, Bernard Devlin's interests were wide and varied, although the Irish community remained central to his concerns. In 1856, for example, he attended an Irish Convention held in Buffalo for the welfare of the Irish people. Years later, in the press of September 20, 1876, we find Devlin \\"arranging with the Government for the proper disposal of the remains of the unfortunate immigrants who died from ship fever in 1847 and were buried near the Wellington Bridge and vicinity\\".The Montreal Beacon, Friday March 16, 1934, page 43, A Champion of Many Causes (A cemetery for the victims of the 'ship fever' (typhus) epidemic of 1847 had to be removed to make way for the enlargement of the Lachine Canal. The coffins dug up were moved to the Catholic cemetery at Notre-Dame- des-Neiges on Mount Royal.)  Establishment of Mount Royal Park  From 1863 to 1870, Devlin sat as a member of the Montreal City Council and as alderman for St. Lawrence Ward.

He fought long and ardently and finally succeeded in having his scheme adopted (1876), thus securing for Montreal one of the most beautiful public parks on the continent. His concurrent efforts as city attorney subsequently saved thousands of dollars for the city in park-related expropriation cases.Obituary for 1880-81 section of the Dominion Annual Register and Review, by Henry J.

The Nancy affair (), commonly referred to in English as the Nancy Mutiny, was the crushing of a military mutiny in France on 31 August 1790, two years before the final overthrow of the French monarchy. The mutiny was of particular significance in that it illustrated the degree to which the discipline and reliability of the Royal Army had been undermined by thirteen months of revolutionary turmoil. Background The Nancy Mutiny occurred at a time when unrest was spreading amongst the regular regiments of the French Army, following the Storming of the Bastille, the mutiny of the gardes-francaises (French Guards) and the forced relocation of the royal family from Versailles to Paris in 1789. While the officers of the army were still predominantly royalist, the rank and file were becoming increasingly influenced by the revolutionary turmoil around them. During the first half of 1790 a number of acts of disobedience and small scale mutinies occurred in various units and political associations were created with links to Jacobin and other parties outside the army. Specific military grievances were widespread amongst the soldiers, relating mainly to harsh discipline and conditions of service. Particularly resented was a measure taken in 1781 to reserve officer commissions to members of the nobility. This restriction had alienated many non-commissioned officers who now had no chance of promotion beyond their existing rank. Mutiny in Nancy In August 1790 the garrison of Nancy in northeastern France comprised three regiments of what was still the Royal Army. These were the R√©giment du Roi (King's Regiment), the R√©giment de Ch√¢teauvieux (one of the twelve regiments of Swiss mercenaries in the French infantry) and the Mestre-de-camp cavalry. The soldiers' committee of the Regiment du Roi demanded to audit the regimental accounts, arrested the quartermaster, confined the colonel and other officers to barracks and seized the unit's pay chest. The Chateauvieux followed suit - a particularly disturbing development from the perspective of the royal court since the Swiss regiments were assumed to be the most reliable element within the army. The officers of the Chateauvieux were able to temporarily restore order and punish members of the soldiers' committee according to the Swiss military code - in this case by running the gauntlet. This action led to renewed disturbances, now involving all three regiments of the garrison. Suppression Fearing that the outbreak in Nancy would spread to the other garrisons located along the frontier, the National Constituent Assembly in Paris ordered suppression of the mutiny. The Assembly concerned at the increasing indiscipline had already voted to abolish political associations within the army. General Fran√ßois Claude de Bouill√©, army commander at Metz, accordingly led 4,500 regular soldiers and national guardsmen to Nancy on 18 August. De Bouill√©, a committed royalist, was later to be a leading force in Louis XVI's attempted flight to Varennes. Upon arrival at the city on 31 August, de Bouille issued an ultimatum to a delegation from the mutinous soldiers demanding the release of their officers and the handing over of four ring-leaders. These terms appeared acceptable to the majority of the soldiers but before they could be implemented a clash occurred at the Stainville Gate where the advance ranks of de Bouille's force were halted before an artillery piece manned by soldiers of the Regiment du Roi. Antoine-Joseph-Marc D√©silles, a junior officer of the Regiment du Roi stepped in front of a 24-pounder cannon loaded with canister in an attempt to dissuade the mutineers from firing on the government troops. He was shot down and in the confusion the cannon was fired killing about 60 of the loyal troops drawn up in close formation a few paces away. A general engagement then broke out and after three hours of fighting de Bouille's troops put down the mutiny with heavy casualties amongst soldiers and civilians. Total deaths were estimated at 500. Aftermath While the French regiments involved escaped serious repercussions, the Swiss mutineers faced severe punishment after court-martial by their own officers. One identified as the prime ringleader was broken on the wheel, 22 were hanged, 41 sentenced to 30 years as galley slaves (in effect hard labour for life since galleys were no longer in service) and a further 74 imprisoned. The National Constituent Assembly approved of de Bouill√©'s actions, but radicals protested its severity. The effect on popular opinion of these draconian measures was to create widespread sympathy for the mutineers, who were subsequently released in the midst of a large-scale celebration; and to further weaken the discipline and morale of the regular army where disturbances continued until the final overthrow of the monarchy in August 1792.

They are analogous to human shoes and are most common in sled dog races. Many races require booties as a basic element of dog care. The Yukon Quest Sled Dog Race, for example, requires mushers to carry no fewer than eight booties per dog.Saari, Matias. \\"Yukon Quest rules range from the practical to the peculiar\\" , Fairbanks Daily News-Miner.

It particularly distinguished itself during the American Revolutionary War. * 1 September 1778: Creation of the Navy's foreign volunteer corps, mainly composed of eight mixed legions to participate in the war against Great Britain.Royal order made on 1 September 1778 It was created by the naval minister Gabriel de Sartine, and 'propri√©taire' status had been granted to Armand Louis de Gontaut, duc de Lauzun. The corps comprised three legions, each consisting of four companies of grenadiers, chasseurs and fusiliers, plus artillery, cavalry and pioneer detachments. As with other 18th century \\"legions\\" the intention was to create a miniature army which could campaign as a single entity. As indicated by the title, the corps was recruited primarily from German, Polish and Irish mercenaries. As the Volontaires Etrangers de la Marine, the new corps saw active service in Senegal in December 1778 as well as in the West Indies. * 5 March 1780: The 2e L√©gion des Volontaires √âtrangers de la Marine changed its name to be the 2e L√©gion des Volontaires √âtrangers de Lauzun, or the L√©gion de Lauzun. This unit was present in the United States of America from July 1780 to May 1783. * When in early 1781 the Exp√©dition Particuli√®re was being organized, most of the 1778 organization had been deployed to overseas posts.

After being posted to Senegal and the West Indies, Lauzun's Legion served in the American War for Independence. The corps' principal engagements were at White Plains in 1781, and at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781.Chartrand, Rene (1992) The French Army in the American War of Independence. (Osprey). =The American War Of Independence= When the Legion arrived in America, they recruited from foreigners, mainly Hessian deserters; there were complaints about their conduct. Rochambeau sent Brigadier General Marquis de Choisy with Lauzun's Legion in July 1780, as they marched from Rhode Island to Head of Elk, Maryland, traveled by water to Alexandria, Virginia, and marched to Glouster Courthouse.Robert E.

The L√©gion de Lauzun became famous during the Siege of Yorktown, mainly before Gloucester on 3 October 1781, where they chased down the champion of the battle, a British cavalry led by Colonel Banastre Tarleton. The legion stayed in the United States of America, first in Hampton, Virginia, then in February 1782 in Charlotte Court House, Virginia, before they were moved in July 1782 to New York. The legion left the United States in May 1783. In Connecticut In December 1780, two dozen Hussar horsemen deserted and discharged themselves from their winter quarters in Lebanon and fled into the woods to the south.Rochambeau's Cavalry: Lauzun's Legion in Connecticut 1780-1781, Robert Selig and Mary Donohue, Connecticut Historical Commission, 2000, p. 33 The Legion itself may have wintered in Trumbull, Connecticut, according to Huldah Hawley, who said she cooked for the French for fear they would kill her because her husband was a known Tory.History of Trumbull Dodrasquicentennial 1797-1972 p. 18 Lauzun's Legion or \\"Hussars\\" encamped in present-day Abraham Nichols Park in Trumbull from June 28 to June 30, 1781.The Magazine of American History with Notes and Queries, Vol. IV, A.S.

On 18 March 1783, in Delaware, their cash payroll was stolen but recovered. On 9‚Äì11 May 1783 the Legion embarked from Wilmington on five vessels, la Goire, la Dana√´, l\\"Astree, l'Active, and Le St. James, arriving at Brest, France, about 11 June. On 5 October 1783, the Legion's two artillery companies left Baltimore on the Duc de Lauzun, and the Pintade. The ships, guarded by two French frigates, arrived in Brest on 10 November. However, many soldiers mustered out in America, or deserted. West Indies When the Legion transferred to America, it left behind its two fusilier companies. These companies transferred to the West Indies. In January‚ÄìFebruary 1782 they accompanied French naval Captain Armand Guy Simon de Co√´tnempren, Comte de Kersaint, with his 32-gun flagship Iphig√©nie and four lesser ships to Demerara, where they met with little opposition. The detachments from the Regiment Armagnac and the Legion launched an assault against the British garrison compelling Governor Robert Kinston and his army detachment from the 28th Regiment of Foot to surrender. As a result, Essequebo and Berbice also surrendered to the French on 1 and 5 February.Chartrand (1992), p.5.

Genomatix is involved in several projects and international conferences e.g. 5th Santorini Conference - \\"Functional Genomics towards personalized health care\\" Conference about personalized health care. Since 2008 Genomatix has strongly focused on Next Generation Sequencing data analysis. Because of the large amount of data and the need for high-end computing power, Genomatix deploys its solutions as in-house installations (hardware software bundle) Two systems are available: 1\\\\. The Genomatix Mining Station (GMS) is based on a proprietary genomic pattern recognition paradigm, or GenomeThesaurus, which allows for input of raw sequence reads plus optional quality files from any deep sequencing hardware. It provides ultra fast mapping of sequences of any length (starting from 8bp) with no practical limits on the number of point mutations and/or insertions and deletions that can be taken into account during the mapping process. Depending on the nature of the experiment, the GMS can provide SNP detection and genotyping, copy number analysis, and small RNA analysis. For ChIPseq data, the GMS delivers clustering and peak finding, and performs automated binding pattern identification. For RNAseq experiments, normalized expression values are calculated at the exon and transcript level. A special GenomeThesaurus is also provided for potential splice junctions, which allows for splice junction analysis and identification of new transcriptional units. For genomic re-sequencing and newly sequenced genomes, a de-novo assembly will be provided. 2\\\\. The Genomatix Genome Analyzer (GGA) delivers downstream software tools and databases for the deep biological analysis of data coming from the GMS. It allows for easy integration and visualization in the terabytes of background annotation of the ElDorado genome database. GGA extensively annotates genomic coordinates and surrounding areas derived by the GMS or any other mapping procedure. Clustering and peak finding, analysis for phylogenetic conservation, large scale correlation analysis with annotated genomic elements, meta-analysis of data correlation between different experiments, pathway mining for groups of identified genes, transcription factor binding site (TFBS) analysis ( identification, over- representation, binding partner analysis, framework identification, phylogenetic conservation, regulatory SNP effects) and much more are all processes carried out on the GGA. With the GGA and GMS Genomatix delivers the worldwide first integrative data analysis platform for Next Generation Sequencing analysis with custom workflows tailored towards specific needs. Further developments will be the link-up of data from clinical sources and medical applications. Pilot projects were already started within Genomatix‚Äô consulting platform linking genotype and phenotype information.

He commanded French divisions at several notable battles of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. He rose to senator on 5 April 1813, then Pair de France on 4 June 1814 and chevalier de Saint-Louis on 27 June 1814. He organised the defence of Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne in 1814 and died in Paris in 1815 of wounds received beside the River Berezina.  Life Revolution and Republic= His military career started when he enlisted in 1777. During the French Revolution he rose rapidly in rank to lieutenant colonel. He received promotion to g√©n√©ral de brigade in 1793 and fought at the Battle of Fleurus (1794). As part of the Army of the Danube, he also fought at the Battle of Ostrach and the Battle of Stockach (1799). As a g√©n√©ral de division he fought under Jean Victor Marie Moreau at the Battle of Hohenlinden (1800), successfully holding the left flank. =Empire= Under Emperor Napoleon, he commanded a division in Marshal Nicolas Soult's IV Corps in the 1805 campaign. At the Battle of Austerlitz, his division helped to fend off the massive Austro-Russian left wing long enough for Soult's other two divisions to break through the Russian center. Still in the corps of Soult, Legrand fought at the battles of Jena in 1806 and Eylau in 1807. During the 1809 campaign, he led a division under Marshal Andre Massena in the battles of Ebelsberg, Aspern-Essling and Wagram. In Napoleon's 1812 invasion of Russia, he fought in Marshal Oudinot's II Corps at Polotsk. He was badly wounded during the crossing of the Berezina River but survived the disastrous winter retreat. Legrand was employed in minor commands during the 1814 campaign in France. He died from the effects of his Russian wound on 9 January 1815.  Bibliography  * Arnold, James, Marengo & Hohenlinden.

A MicroProse action-strategy game titled Knights of the Sky (actually a Sega Genesis port of 1992's The Ancient Art of War in the Skies) was also completed in 1994 but never released. In 2007, it was also a working title for the never-finished World War I flight simulator that was supposed to be a debut title by the now-closed developer Gennadich Team.SimHQ Interview - Knights Of The Sky Tommo purchased the rights to this game and digitally publishes it through its Retroism brand in 2015. Gameplay Knights of the Sky came with multiple gameplay options including full World War 1 campaign, single dogfight, head to head and flight training. The World War 1 campaign mode involved moving through a series of missions. Each mission contained an objective (ex: bomb a specific German airport behind enemy lines) as well as a number of dogfights that would naturally arise in the course of attempting to complete the primary objective. The game would track the number of enemy planes you shot down in total and would rank your character as compared to other famous World War I aces. Iconic World War 1 flying aces like the Red Baron as well as other well-known historic figures were included in the game and would occasionally be encountered in dogfights. As you progressed through the game your mechanic would provide you intel on where you might encounter these aces. The single Dogfight mode allowed the player to select from a number of historical World War 1 aces with which to engage in a dogfight. Head to head mode allowed the player to challenge another player, via modem connection, to a dogfight. Development The game's working title was Red Baron, until this name was \\"stolen\\" by Dynamix for Red Baron when the latter had been publicly announced first.Computer Gaming World 79 (February 1991) Following its original PC release, the game underwent two subsequent patch-style revisions that would add a more realistic plane damage system (source of much of the early controversy, as just one well placed bullet could cause a critical damage and taking non-critical hits were not communicated to the player whatsoever), and active NPC allied planes undergoing their own patrols (in a way similar to enemy patrols), available for free after sending a blank floppy disk to MicroProse. Reception Knights of the Sky was a critical success. Computer Gaming World liked the game replay and other external views, and the challenging computer opponents. The magazine concluded that \\"this game is a must for WWI fans and flight simulation fans\\". In a 1991 survey of World War I flight simulations, Computer Gaming World called Knights in the Sky \\"the most realistic\\", superior to Dynamix's Red Baron for \\"the advanced air combat simulation jocks\\"; a survey of strategy and war games that year and in 1993 gave it three and a half stars out of five, preferring Red Baron. Amiga Power awarded 87% on its initial port for the Amiga, praising the feel of the gameplay, vivid graphics and quality presentation. Criticisms included a low framerate compared to the DOS version, poor handling of analogue joystick or mouse control, and having to use the keyboard to glance around during a dogfight. On the game's budget re-release in 1993, Amiga Power revised their score to 92%, emphasising the exciting dogfights and scenery appreciation that comes with simulating the low-speed World War I aircraft. In 1996, the latter ranked it as the 10th best Amiga game of all time.Amiga Power issue 64, Future Publishing, August 1996 ReferencesExternal links * Category:1990 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Atari ST games Category:Cancelled Sega Genesis games Category:Combat flight simulators Category:World War I flight simulation video games Category:DOS games Category:MicroProse games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:World War I video games Category:Video games set in the British Empire ","title":"Knights of the Sky"},{"id":"21669650","text":"Jeziorno () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Dzierzgo≈Ñ, within Sztum County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland.

The blog was reviewed by Building (magazine) in 2006 after it had already attracted a global readership. He has since stopped recording his professional life in this way focusing instead in the promotion of building control (building regulation) issues in countries where climate change and the consequential rise in sea levels is predicted to have devastating economic and life safety consequences within the next 100 years. Concurrently between 2004 and 2007 he contributed to regular newspaper columns belonging to the Trinity Mirror newspaper group as their \\"Property Doctor\\" writing articles covering mainly property development and investment issues. The first ever building control seminar by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors attracted much media interest in Mauritius during late 2008.

History of the channel AB Cartoons was launched in 1996 as a youth channel on the AB Sat package. It showed Japanese animation (anime) already shown on Club Doroth√©e on TF1. Due to the popularity of the genre with young adults and teens as well as criticism of the violence shown in the programmes, the channel was renamed Mangas, on 1 September 1998 using the logo of the magazine D.MANGAS (the former Doroth√©e Magazine, although the show on TF1 had ended in 1997). On February 15, 2011, the channel switched to 16:9 format. During the first few weeks after this change, programs in 4:3 format remain in their original format, before being quickly displayed in 14:9 format. Since October 2013, the channel has been broadcasting anime the day after its diffusion in Japan to compete with the newly created channel J-One.La cha√Æne MANGAS va diffuser des simulcast OrganisationManagers= President : *Jean-Michel Fava Vice- President : *Claude Berda Director of programmes : *Richard Maroko Director of Marketing and Business Development : *Gregg Bywalski Editor : *Pierre Faviez =Budged= Mangas is owned by AB Sat SA with a budget of ‚Ç¨24 million, provided 100% by AB Groupe. Programmes The programming is mostly classic reruns bought from the Club Doroth√©e era, such as Fist of the North Star, Ranma ¬Ω, Moero! Top Striker and Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. However, the channel also shows original programming such as One Piece and Wolf's Rain shown in the original version...etc. Eventually, Mangas showed several new programmes which are now cancelled, such as Galaxie Mangas (animated by Olivier Lign√© and Olivier Fallaix) from 2000 to 2003, D√©fi Mangas a showcase for short films by young directors, and Mangas √† la carte, a programme where viewers could vote for the way they wished the series to develop. Today, the channel is the only French channel with a bimonthly news magazine entirely dedicated to the world of manga, (paper manga, anime, video games, etc.), which has been broadcast since September 2004 : Actu Mangas. The magazine is co-written by Myl√®ne Patou (for manga) and C√©dric Derancourt (for video games) who is also in charge of programming for the channel. The show is also shown in a shortened version on NT1.

The solvency ratio of an insurance company is the size of its capital relative to all risks it has taken. The solvency ratio is most often defined as: :net.assets \\\\div net.premium.written The solvency ratio is a measure of the risk an insurer faces of claims that it cannot absorb. The amount of premium written is a better measure than the total amount insured because the level of premiums is linked to the likelihood of claims. Different countries use different methodologies to calculate the solvency ratio, and have different requirements. For example, in India insurers are required to maintain a minimum ratio of 1.5.http://www.irdaindia.org/Finance_And_Analysis/Annexure221107.xls For pension plans, the solvency ratio is the ratio of pension plan assets to liabilities (the pensions to be paid). Another measure of the pension plan's ability to pay all pensions in perpetuity is the going concern ratio, which measures the cost of pensions if the pension plan continues to operate. For the solvency ratio, the pension liabilities are measured using stringent rules including the assumption that the plan will be close immediately so must purchase of annuities to transfer responsibility of the pensions to another party. This is more expensive so the solvency ratio is usually lower than the going concern ratio, which measures the pension plan's ability to pay pensions if it continues to operate.

This article details the events as they occurred on Bloody Sunday (1972).  March organisers' intentions and response of the authorities  The organisers' original intention was that the march would form up on the Creggan Estate behind a coal delivery lorry carrying the main speakers and bearing a Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) banner. The march would then make its way down to William Street on the edge of the Bogside, and on to the Guildhall in the city centre, where a rally would be held. In response, the head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in Derry, Chief Superintendent Frank Lagan, suggested that no action should be taken against the marchers, save photographing the organisers with a view to prosecuting them later. His views were passed on to RUC Chief Constable Graham Shillington, and to Brigadier Patrick MacLellan, commander of the 8th Infantry Brigade (8 Brigade), who in turn passed them on to Major General Robert Ford, Commander of Land Forces in Northern Ireland. The final decision was taken by a \\"higher authority\\",Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 17 after consultation with Ford and Shillington, to the effect that the march would be allowed to go ahead, but should be \\"(contained) within the general area of the Bogside and the Creggan Estate so as to prevent rioting in the City centre and damage to commercial premises and shops.\\" MacLellan's tactical plan saw this containment being achieved by 26 sequentially numbered barriers cutting off all streets leading from the march route to the Guildhall. These would be erected in the early afternoon, before the march began, and consist of, \\"wooden 'knife rests' reinforced with barbed wire and concrete slabs,\\" backed by an army armoured personnel carrier (APC) on either side of the road.Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 18 Each barrier would be manned by locally garrisoned troops of 8 Bridgade and RUC officers. British Army reinforcements were: * 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment (1 Para) * 1st Battalion, King's Own Royal Border Regiment (1 KORB) * 2nd Company, 3rd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (3 RRF) * Two water cannons Although the plan envisaged no action being taken if the march stayed within the prescribed areas, if there was any attempt to breach the barriers or to attack the security services, the latter could respond with baton rounds (\\"rubber bullets\\"), water cannon, and ‚Äì as a \\"last resort\\" when in danger of being overrun ‚Äì CS gas.Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 10 It was further stated: The scoop-up operation was only to be launched on MacLellan's orders, when \\"the rioters and the marchers were clearly separated\\".Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 34 1 Para would also, \\"act as the second Brigade mobile reserve\\".  Events of the march and shootings  The march formed up on the Creggan in \\"carnival mood\\",Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 24 on the sunny afternoon of 30 January. Led by the coal lorry, it made its way down to the Bogside, its numbers swelling as more people joined en route. Moving down William Street, when the lorry reached the junction with Little James Street and Rossville Street, it swung right (south) down the latter, and headed towards Free Derry Corner. Despite the efforts of stewards to guide the marchers to follow the lorry, a large number carried on along William Street towards Barrier 14, just past the junction with Chamberlain Street. At least one man attempted to pull aside one of the knife rests, but was restrained by a steward as the crowd jeered the soldiers and RUC. Eventually the crowd in front of the barrier began to thin, and youths started to stone the troops, who responded with baton rounds. When the youths used sheets of corrugated iron as shields, the water cannon was brought up to drench them ‚Äì and at least one television camera crew ‚Äì with purple-dyed water. A canister of CS gas thrown from the crowd exploded in front of the water cannon, obstructing the vision of its crew, who were not wearing gas masks, so it had to be withdrawn until the gas dispersed.Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 25 After an earlier reconnaissance of the march route to determine the various points where 1 Para might launch their arrest operation, depending on which barrier was threatened, it had been thought that in the case of Barrier 14 it could be done over a wall on one side of William Street, just to the east of Little James Street, on the other side of which was the Presbyterian Church. This would have allowed the paratroopers to out- flank the rioters in a pincer movement, with other troops coming directly through Barrier 14 itself. In full daylight it was discovered that the top of the wall was covered in barbed wire, so a party of paratroopers was sent forward to cut it, while others covered them from various floors of some adjacent derelict buildings. Shortly before 16:00, these paratroopers were spotted by youths in William Street, who began to pelt them with stones and bottles. Later testifying before Widgery that nail bombs had been thrown, the paratroopers opened fire, injuring 15-year-old Damien Donaghy, who had been throwing stones, and 59-year-old John Johnston, a passerby not involved with either the march or the stone-throwing.Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 36 Johnston ‚Äì who was hit twice ‚Äì died 4¬Ω months later from his injuries. Shortly afterwards, a single high-velocity (i.e. rifle) shot narrowly missed the wire-cutting party, striking a drainpipe on the Presbyterian Church.Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 35 At 15:55 Colonel Derek Wilford, commanding 1 Para, requested permission to \\"deploy sub- unit through barricade 14 to pick up yobbos in William Street/Little James Street.\\"Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 29 MacLellan's reply was received at 16:09 and read: > Orders given to 1 Para at 1607 hours for one sub-unit of 1 Para to do scoop- > up op through barrier 14. Not to conduct running battle down Rossville > Street. By this stage, although some rioters remained at Barrier 14, most had drifted away, while Rossville Street and the waste ground to the north of the Rossville Flats was still filled with scattered stragglers from the march, as well as curious onlookers. At 16:10, while C Company of 1 Para moved through Barrier 14 on foot along William Street, a convoy of ten army vehicles carrying the battalion's Support Company (reinforced with a Composite Platoon ‚Äì a.k.a. \\"Guinness Force\\" ‚Äì from Administrative Company) moved through Barrier 12 and down Little James Street. This was led by two APCs carrying the 18-man Mortar Platoon, commanded by \\"Lieutenant N\\"; the Company's Command APC, supported by a Ferret armoured car; two empty APCs of Machine Gun Platoon (which had been deployed elsewhere and did not otherwise take part); two soft- skinned 4-ton lorries carrying the 36-man Composite Platoon, commanded by \\"Captain SA8\\" (a.k.a. \\"Captain 200\\"); and finally two APCs carrying the 17-man Anti-Tank Platoon, commanded by \\"Lieutenant 119\\".Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 41 Lieutenant N's APC halted on the waste ground near Eden Place, while the second Mortar Platoon APC passed the first and stopped in the courtyard of the Rossville Flats.Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 43 The vehicles having come much further into the Bogside than was usual or expected caused some panic amongst the crowd. Many civilians fled down Rossville Street towards Free Derry Corner, whilst others were caught in the courtyard of the Rossville flats. Lieutenant N himself moved north towards Chamberlain Street, where he fired three warning shots to disperse a \\"hostile crowd\\".Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 51, subsection ii The rest of Mortar Platoon began to make arrests, but according to Widgery they came under fire, and in the next ten minutes fired 42 rounds of live 7.62 mm ammunition, leaving 17-year-old John Duddy dead in the courtyard,Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 47 having been shot in the back by a bullet Widgery suggested had been fired by \\"Soldier V\\" and \\"intended for someone else.\\"Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 69 The remaining army vehicles stopped in Rossville Street, although the Command APC ‚Äì with the Ferret ‚Äì was moved to the north end of Rossville Flats Block 1 when it came under fire.Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 44 Some men from Anti- Tank Platoon moved east to Kells Walk, so Captain SA8 deployed half of his men to support them, and the rest to support Mortar Platoon. At Kells Walk, the paratroopers found themselves facing a number of people standing defiantly on the rubble barricade some 100 metres away, while others around them either sought cover or fled. Testifying to Widgery that they identified gunmen or nail bombers on the barricade, the paratroopers opened fire. By the time a ceasefire order was given, seven men had been shot dead or fatally wounded. John Young (17), Michael McDaid (20), and William Nash (19) fell almost simultaneously. Widgery decided that Nash may have been shot by \\"Soldier P\\",Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 78 but that Young and McDaid could have been shot by any of the paratroopers at Kells Walk.Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 75Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 77 Michael Kelly (17) was also shot dead, the recovered bullet showing it had been fired by \\"Soldier F\\". Hugh Gilmore (17) was hit as he ran towards the barricade, but managed to stumble over it and carry on a little further before he collapsed and died. Widgery again could not identify who had fired the shot, beyond it being one of the paratroopers at Kells Walk.Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 71 Two men were shot from behind as they attempted to crawl away: Kevin McElhinney (17) died on the pavement between the barricade and Rossville Flats Block 1, probably shot by \\"Sergeant K\\", while Patrick Doherty (31) died between Block 2 and Joseph Place, possibly having crawled there after being hit. Widgery decided that the evidence of \\"Soldier F\\" suggested that he had shot Doherty.Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 70 Amongst those wounded at the rubble barricade was William Nash's father, Alexander, who was hit as he went to his son's aid. Widgery decided that the medical evidence suggested that the father had been shot with a low- velocity shot from a gunman, rather than a high-velocity one from a paratrooper. Widgery's deduction from the medical evidence was that the wound was most probably \\"inflicted by a civilian firing haphazardly in the general direction of the soldiers without exposing himself enough to take proper aim\\".Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 79 At this point a large group of civilians sheltering behind the gable end of the Glanfada Park flats by the rubble barricade moved en masse through the south-east gap between the blocks of Glenfada Park North and into its central courtyard, heading for the south-west entrance leading to Abbey Park. Two of the paratroops ‚Äì Soldiers \\"D\\" and \\"F\\" ‚Äì at Kells Walk made their way into the courtyard via the north- east gap, closely followed by two more ‚Äì \\"G\\" and \\"H\\". A number of civilians were shot, either in the courtyard or between it and Abbey Park, four of them fatally: James Wray (22), Gerald McKinney (35), Gerald Donaghy (17), and William McKinney (26). The bullet recovered from Donaghy ‚Äì who did not die immediately ‚Äì was traced to the rifle of \\"Soldier G\\".Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 84 Wray was hit twice, the second time from close range while he was lying face down on the ground. The bullet which killed William McKinney may also have injured Joe Mahon, who survived. Widgery said the firing in Glenfada Park, \\"bordered on the reckless.\\"Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 8 Across at the Rossville Flats, a group of civilians sheltering in the gap between Blocks 1 and 2 heard an injured man calling out for help, and 41-year-old Bernard McGuigan determined to go to his aid, despite the pleas of the others to remain under cover. Moving into the open and holding up a white handkerchief, McGuigan was almost immediately fatally shot in the head, possibly by \\"Soldier F\\", who was still in Glenfada Park, and testified to having fired in the direction of where McGuigan died.Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 73 Aftermath The wounded Gerald Donaghy had been taken from Glenfada Park into a nearby house, where he was treated by a civilian doctor, while others present searched him for any identification, before being driven by car to hospital. En route the car was stopped at an army checkpoint, the driver and other civilian passenger arrested and taken away. The car was driven to an army first aid post, where Donaghy was examined by a Royal Army Medical Corps doctor and pronounced dead. Some time later, an RUC officer reported that four bulky nail bombs had been found in the pockets of Donaghy's denim jacket and jeans. Although acknowledging the suggestion that the bombs had been planted on Donaghy's body, Widgery decided that although he had been searched or examined by at least four people, \\"I think that on a balance of probabilities the bombs were in Donaghy's pockets throughout.\\"Widgery ‚Äì Report of the Tribunal, paragraph 88 References Category:1972 in Northern Ireland Category:The Troubles in Derry (city) Category:The Troubles (Northern Ireland) Category:Massacres in Northern Ireland Category:Massacres committed by the United Kingdom Category:1972 in British politics ","title":"Narrative of events of Bloody Sunday (1972)"},{"id":"21669846","text":"Charles Gaspard √âlisabeth Joseph de Bailly, marquis de Bailly (6 January 1765, Le Bourgneuf-la-For√™t, Mayenne - 14 January 1850, Le Bourgneuf-la-For√™t) was a French army officer. Life He was the son of Jean-Baptiste Joseph de Bailly (1732-1811), deputy to the estates general of 1789, and of Edm√©e or Aim√©e Anne Charlotte Lescalopier, the daughter of Gaspard C√©sar Charles Lescalopier, the intendant g√©n√©ral of Tours. He entered the army as sub-lieutenant in the King's Infantry Regiment (r√©giment d'infanterie du roi) in 1780 and on 28 August 1790 found himself caught up in the Nancy affair (he was one of the 16 officers to defend General Malseigne against the mutineers), in which he was wounded. He joined the √©migr√© party and commanded the Salm-Kirburg hussar regiment in the Army of Cond√© and served alongside Charles Fran√ßois de Virot de Sombreuil, who promoted him to command the 2nd Division of the force sent to land at Quiberon. He planned to marry Anne-Marie d'Allonville, daughter of Armand Jean d'Allonville, but this did not take place. In 1800, at Altona, he married Mademoiselle de Pardaillan, another √©migr√©. They then went to Portugal together, where he became a field officer with the rank of brigadier. He stayed there until his father's death in 1811, which made him return to France. He refused all Napoleon I's offers of a job in his army, he became the king's most devoted and trusted servant on the Bourbon Restoration, as president of the Conseil g√©n√©ral de la Mayenne, mar√©chal de camp (from 18 April 1816) and inspector of the department's national guards (Gardes nationales), and as deputy in 1815 and 1824. In 1824 his name was put forward for the presidency. A fervent royalist, he was elected to the Chambre introuvable by the college of the Mayenne department on 22 August 1815 - he was part of the majority party in it. Later, re-elected in the 6 March 1824 legislative elections, he continued to support the government - even so, he supported the proposal of Jan Kowitz. On 5 November 1827 he was on the list of 76 new peers intended \\"to break the national majority in the upper chamber\\".¬´ Bailly (Charles Gaspard Elisabeth Joseph, marquis de Fresnay) ¬ª , dans Robert et Cougny, Dictionnaire des parlementaires fran√ßais, 1889 His unselfishness always put him at a distance from the court and even made him refuse the 19,000 franc pension he was entitled to as a peer of France. Not even the king could get Bailly's inflexible conscience to bend to policy and ended by telling him \\"My friend, you are right\\". His public career ended in 1830, but he stayed active for 20 years more in his services to agriculture and philanthropy. He became a commander of the order of Saint Louis on 23 May 1825 and died at the ch√¢teau de Fresnay in Mayenne on 14 January 1850. All parties paid tribute to his character and convictions.

He is currently the head coach for Robert Morris, a position he has held since 2004. Career Hailing from St. Louis, Schooley was unheralded coming out of high school and spent a year with the Omaha Lancers under Frank Serratore. Schooley led the USHL in scoring by a defenseman for his lone season in the league, helping Omaha capture both the regular season and Championship titles, a first for Lancers. After being named to the USHL All-Star second team Schooley joined the program at Western Michigan. Schooley played for the Broncos for four seasons, improving his point total each season, but remained a relatively unknown player outside of Kalamazoo. The Broncos had a fair amount of success while schooley was there, making two conference semifinals as well as only their second tournament appearance in 1994. After graduating with a degree in Communications Schooley embarked on a brief professional career, spending the 1994‚Äì95 season with the Huntington Blizzard before bouncing between four teams the following year. Schooley retires after four games in 1996-97 and joined the Chicago Freeze as both an assistant coach and scouting director. Schooley returned to the college ranks in 1997 as an assistant for Cornell but left after a season to join his former junior coach Serratore at Air Force in a similar role. Schooley was assigned to coach the team's defense and twice set the program record for lowest goals against per game during his time there. After serving as an assistant on the USA under-18 team at the junior world cup and a year later found himself promoted to associate head coach of the Falcons. In the summer of 2004 Robert Morris University announced that they were adding several new sports as fully funded programs, including men's ice hockey. Two days after the press conference Schooley was signed on as the team's new head coach. Robert Morris joined the CHA straight away due to the conference having just lost Findlay after their program was demoted to club status. The Colonials finished in last place their first season, but only one point behind Air Force in the conference standings. Over the next four seasons Schooley led to the team to an increasing win total, topping out at 15 in 2007‚Äì08 with his first graduating class of seniors. The Colonials dipped a bit in the two years following but while Schooley was building his program, his conference was collapsing. The CHA had lost Air Force to Atlantic Hockey in 2006 while Wayne State shuttered their program two years later. With only four teams left the conference was on its last legs (NCAA bylaws stipulated that conferences needed to have a minimum of six teams to qualify for an automatic tournament bid). When Bemidji State left for the WCHA in 2010 two of the remaining three schools joined Atlantic Hockey and the CHA was disbanded. The Colonials found a new level of success in their new home, posting their first winning season in 2010‚Äì11 and continued the upwards swing by taking their first conference tournament title in 2014. Robert Morris' first appearance in the NCAA tournament saw them pitted against #1 seed Minnesota where they predictable lost. Schooley's team followed up their surprising season by capturing the Atlantic Hockey regular season crown in 2015, going 24-8-5 and a second the following year. Unfortunately Robert Morris was unable to win the conference tournament in either of those years and was left out of the NCAA championship. Schooley's teams have finished as conference runner-ups in each of the last three seasons (as of 2018).

Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 1. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije, p. 449. Geography Brezovica is a clustered village at the southeast end of the Borovnica Valley. It lies along Pru≈°nica Creek and its tributaries: ≈†umik Creek, which flows from below Krim≈°ƒçek Hill (941 m), and Izber Creek. The soil is sandy and partially loamy. Name The name of the settlement was changed from Brezovica to Brezovica pri Borovnici (literally, 'Brezovica near Borovnica') in 1955.Spremembe naselij 1948‚Äì95. 1996. Database. Ljubljana: Geografski in≈°titut ZRC SAZU, DZS. The name Brezovica and names like it are relatively common in Slovenia and in other Slavic countries (e.g., B≈ôezovice in the Czech Republic, Brezovica in Serbia, etc.). The name Brezovica is derived from the word breza 'birch'. Like similar toponyms in Slovenia (e.g., Brezova, Brezovec, Brezovci), it originally referred to the local vegetation.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 80. In the past the German name was Bresowitz. History In 1884, Brezovica had a population of 180 people living in 29 houses.Special.Orts-Reportorium von Krain. 1884. Vienna: Alfred H√∂lder, p. 66. The population remained relatively stable for decades, with 173 people in 32 houses in 1900, and 181 people in 28 houses in 1961.

Life Victor Fran√ßois de Montchenu came from one of the oldest families in the Dauphin√©, and one long devoted to military service. He was admitted to the Ecole des chevaux-l√©gers as a child and in 1775 became sous-lieutenant of the r√©giment d'infanterie du Roi (King's Infantry Regiment), at a time when officer ranks were reserved for sons of the noble families. He was a captain in this corps during the Nancy affair, finding himself beside Andr√© D√©silles when the latter died by throwing himself in front of a cannon in a vain hope of stopping the battle between the mutineers and the troops of de Bouill√©. Consistently monarchist, Montchenu quickly decided in 1792 that the royalist cause was irrevocably separated from the nation's cause and left France to join the arm√©e des Princes, serving in it as aide-de-camp to g√©n√©ral Livarot. In March 1793 he assisted in the defence of Maestricht against Charles Fran√ßois Dumouriez's force and served as an aide-major in the 1794-95 campaigns in the r√©giment de Broglie in the pay of England. Returning to France on the peace of 1814, Montchenu was made a croix de Saint-Louis on 13 August that year and was made brevet mar√©chal de camp on 30 December. His elder brother was sent to Saint Helena in 1815 as commissioner of the French government to keep an eye on the behaviour of Napoleon. Under the Bourbon Restoration the younger Montchenu worked as inspector general of the infantry. He became a Knight (18 May 1820) then an Officer (1 May 1821) of the L√©gion d'honneur. His active career ceased after the July Revolution and he was allowed to retire in February 1835.
