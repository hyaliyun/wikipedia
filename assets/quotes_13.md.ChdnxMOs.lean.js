Preparation and serving Abalones are first prepared by cleaning with a brush in water, and the flesh is taken out from the flat and middle of the shells with a small kitchen knife. The internal organs are removed separately from the flesh (taking care not to damage them). The flesh is slightly parboiled in a pot of boiling water and then thinly sliced. Rice is soaked in a bowl of water 3 to 4 hours before cooking. The abalone flesh is stir-fried on a pot over a mid-flame with sesame oil, with the soaked rice then added. After stir frying for a while, water is poured into the pot and the dish is cooked at a higher temperature. Constant stirring prevents the ingredients from sticking to the bottom of the pot. After the dish has come to a boil, the heat is lowered and let to simmer. The dish is seasoned with salt or ganjang (Korean soy sauce).

As release from ecclesiastical obedience One was the release of a pupil of a cathedral school, a domicellaris, from subjection to the authority of the scholasticus, or head of the school. This emancipation took place with certain well-defined ceremonies, known in the old German cathedral schools as Kappengang. The term emancipation is also applied to the release of a secular ecclesiastic from his diocese, or of a regular cleric from obedience and submission to his former superior, because of election to the episcopate. The petition requesting release from the former condition of service or submission, which the collegiate electoral body, or the newly elected person, must present to the former superior, is called postulatio simplex, in contradistinction to the postulatio sollemnis, or petition to be laid before the pope, in case some canonical impediment prevents the elected person from assuming the episcopal office. The document granting the dismissal from the former relations is called litterae dimissoriae or emancipatoriae. It is not customary to use the term emancipation for that form of dismissal by which a church is released from parochial jurisdiction, a bishop from subordination to his metropolitan, a monastery or order from the jurisdiction of the bishop, for the purpose of placing such person or body under the ecclesiastical authority next higher in rank, or under the pope himself. This act is universally known as exemption. In relation to slavery and Roman law In ancient Rome emancipation was a process of law by which a slave released from the control of his master, or a son liberated from the authority of his father (patria potestas), was declared legally independent. The earliest ecclesiastical employment of this process was in the freeing of slaves. The Church introduced in place of the elaborate formalities of the emancipatio the simpler form of the manumissio in ecclesiâ,Cod., De his, qui in ecclesiâ manumittuntur, i, 13. in which a simple statement to that effect by the master before the bishop and the congregation sufficed. The emancipation of a slave was especially necessary as a preliminary to his ordination.c. i (Synod of Poitiers, 1078, can, viii), X, De filiis presbyterorum ordinandis vel non, I, xvii; c. iii (Fourth Synod of Toledo, 633, can. lxxiv), X, De servis non ordinandis et eorum manumissione, I, xviii. Similarly, the entrance of a son into a religious order, i.e. the taking of solemn vows, or the professio religiosa, carries with it in canon law his emancipation from the legal authority (patria potestas) of the father. No positive law, however, can be quoted on this point, nor does modern civil legislation recognize this consequence of religious profession.

Goodwin, then director of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration. It was initially proposed as a large-scale program of research into inner-city violence, with the intent of identifying children and youth believed to be biologically or genetically pre-disposed to violence. Goodwin further suggested that future research possibilities might include interventions and targeted treatments in order to divert these youth from possible future violence. The proposal drew public controversy after portions of Goodwin's speech which compared inner-city youth to primates in the jungle were leaked publicly. The remarks were initially publicized by Peter Breggin, an outspoken opponent of psychiatric medication and biological explanations of crime. Goodwin first apologized for the primate remarks in an interview on February 21, calling them \\"insensitive and careless.\\" He resigned from his position on February 27, 1992. Further controversy arose when Breggin drew a connection between the Violence Initiative and Goodwin's earlier research into the use of psychiatric drugs as a means of controlling violent behavior, ultimately suggesting that the Violence Initiative would result in widespread use of psychiatric drugs to control the behavior of inner-city minority youth. Critics denounced the proposal as racist and called for it to be cancelled. Supporters of the proposal countered that the proposal had been a legitimate research topic, and had become a victim of \\"political correctness.\\"  Primate comparison  Goodwin's controversial remarks drew a direct comparison between inner-city youth and male monkeys in the wild: These remarks were described as \\"rambling\\" by the Washington Post during the initial controversy. In a 1995 article, the New Yorker characterized his logic as \\"obscure\\" and \\"not entirely clear\\"; the same article reported Goodwin stating that he had made the remarks \\"impromptu - and after a wholly sleepless night\\". The comparison of inner-city youth to primates, accompanied by the use of the word \\"jungle\\", was widely viewed as racist. Writer Tom Wolfe, though sympathetic to Goodwin's argument, stated in his 1996 essay \\"Sorry, But Your Soul Just Died\\", that this \\"may have been the stupidest single word uttered by an American public official in the year 1992\\".

His period of government lasted barely one day between August 31 and September 1, 1870, but was important for the political situation and development of the country at the time. Early life Facundo Machaín Recalde was a lawyer and politician. He was born in Asunción on November 26, 1845. His parents were José Serapio Machaín y Zavala and Clara Recalde y Machaín. He had several siblings: Esteban, León, Raymundo (who later married his widow), Josefa (married Federico Zorraquín), Francisca (married Alberto Robinson), Emilia and Serapio Machaín. He was married to Clara Recalde, but had no children. After attending school in Asuncion he studied in Chiles Universidad Central where he graduated from Law School. His professor was the Argentine Andrés Bello. Politics At the end of Paraguayan War in early 1869 he returned to the recently occupied Asuncion and got involved in politics. He quickly became president of the political Gran Club del Pueblo and was elected to the National Assembly. Facundo was one of the first Paraguayan politicians who spoke in public to the people and managed to captivate the audience with his strong personality, his youth and culture. According to the biography written by José Segundo Decoud, Facundo was a good speaker but had difficulties with writing. As a lawyer he was member of the commission that created the Constitution of 1870. Presidency The Paraguayan Provisional government of 1869 consisted of Colonel Carlos Loizaga, Cirilo Antonio Rivarola and Jose Diaz de Bedoya.The Statesman's Year Book In May 1870 José Díaz de Bedoya resigned and on August 31, 1870 Carlos Loizaga also resigned. The remaining member Antonio Rivarola was then relieved of his duties by the National Assembly which established a provisional Presidency to which he was elected and assumed post on August 31, 1870. Machaín was elected by 37 votes against 5. He swore the following oath: “I swear before the God and the Country, to fulfill truthfully my duties as President and all the dispositions of the Sovereign Constituent Convention”. But only 12 hours after, in a plot planned by Cirilo Antonio Rivarola, Candido Bareiro and with the help of some Allied forces, he was overthrown on September 1, 1870 in the first coup after the war. Later career He was appointed to be a member of the Supreme Court of Justice in 1872. Despite them being political opponents, President Juan Bautista Gill appointed him as the Foreign minister in June, 1874.Historical Dictionary of Paraguay In 1876 he negotiated and signed with the Argentine Minister Bernardo de Irigoyen the Machaín-Irigoyen Treaty on February 3, 1876 under which Paraguay officially ceded Misiones Province and part of Gran Chaco territory. It also made possible the removal of Allied occupation forces from Paraguay by July 3, 1876.Historical Dictionary of Paraguay Arrest and murder He worked as a journalist and was professor and the first director of the Colegio Nacional de Asunción (Asunción's National School). From that building he saw the assassination of President Juan Bautista Gill in April 1877. When hearing the first shots he went out to one of the balconies that opened to the Libertad Street (nowadays called Eligio Ayala) shouting: “The President is being killed”. He agreed to defend those accused for the murder of President Gill. However, the political situation made him a victim of political passions. He was imprisoned and placed in the same cell as his defendants, among whom were José Dolores Molas. Under orders from Candido Bareiro and Bernardino Caballero he was murdered by prison guards in his prison cell on 29 October 1877 at the age of 32. His death caused great sadness in Paraguayan society. It was said that with him Paraguayan writing lost a great professor. A street in Asuncion, in the neighborhood of Mariscal Estigarribia is named in his honor. References * Los presidentes del Paraguay. Raúl Amaral * Manuel Franco. Un gobernante ejemplar y austero.

He is best known as the co-founder of Clarke Chapman in Gateshead, once one of the largest employers on Tyneside. Educated locally, Clarke undertook his apprenticeship with Longbridge's Iron Works in Bedlington and at Armstrong, Mitchell & Co. in Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1864, he set up a small engineering business on the South Shore in the same area as Hawks and Abbots iron foundries. Within a year, he had taken a partner, Abel Chapman and later the two were joined by Charles Parsons to create Clarke Chapman. The firm relocated to St James' Road and within 20 years, was world-famous.Gateshead Blue Plaques: William Clarke, Gateshead Council. Available online at http://www.localhistorygateshead.com/gatesheads-history/gateshead-blue- plaques/william-clarke-1831---1890 (retrieved 14 March 2011) William Clarke played an active part in the affairs of Gateshead and was a JP and a Council member for some years as well as an organiser for the local Volunteer Corps, treasurer of the Children's Hospital and a supporter of the Northern Counties Institute for the Deaf. Clarke was a staunch Methodist and the first Treasurer of the 'New Durham Road Wesleyan Mission Committee' in 1885. He also introduced a number of reading rooms and science classes for Gateshead people. It was said of William that he seldom 'strayed from the banks of the Tyne'. He died unexpectedly at the age of 59.

Story Šimon was the son of Afrikan (ON: Alfrekr), a king in the land of the Varangians. Afrikan was the brother of Jakun (ON: Hákon) who took part in the Battle of Listven. When Afrikan died Jakun expelled Šimon and his brother Friand (ON: Friandi).Androshchuk 2004:44 Šimon would live in Kievan Rus' for the rest of his life, and he first served Yaroslav I the Wise and later his son. In 1068, he joined Yaroslav's three sons in the Battle of the Alta River against the Polovtsians. It is reported that before the battle, saint Anthony of Kiev, predicted a dire outcome for the battle, but he also predicted that Šimon would be saved through a miracle. Šimon survived the battle, but he was severely wounded. Anthony took care of Šimon and healed his wounds. In recognition, when Anthony founded the cave monastery, Šimon donated a belt and a wreath of gold that his father Afrikan had used to adorn a crucifix. The gifts were worth 50 gold grivnas. The Varangian was probably one of the first to be buried in the monastery and he was the first one to receive a written remission from the monastery that both he and his descendants were pardoned for all their sins. His son Georgi also showed affection for the cave monastery and sent gold and silver from Suzdal to the decoration of the grave of Saint Theodosius of Kiev. When Gregori died, he left a letter to his family asking them to help the monastery financially. Šimon's great-grandchildren were buried in the Dmitri church in Suzdal, which was built by its bishop Jefrem who had been ordained in the cave monastery. Scandinavian sources Based on Vilhelm Thomsen's identification between the names Alfrekr and Alrikr, Stender-Petersen connected Afrikan to the Alrekr who appears on the runestones Sö 101 and Sö 106 in Sweden.Pritsak 1981:417 Omeljan Pritsak, however, opposes this idenfication as he considers Jakun to have been Jarl Hákon Eiríksson who died in 1029, while Alrekr would not yet have been born.Pritsak 1981:418 The first scholar who undertook to identify the people mentioned in the Patericon was Fyodor Braun, and he suggested that Afrikan was based on an archaic pronunciation of the Old Norse dialect of Södermanland. The form would have been an oblique case of *afreki, i.e. *afriką (son) < *afrikan. The name Friand would not have been the name of a person, since the name is otherwise not attested among the Old Norse names, and Braun suggested that it was the appellative form of frjá (\\"to love\\"), frjándi, and which meant \\"nephew\\" in some Old Norse sources. Likewise, he did not consider Šimon to be derived from Sigmundr because ši reflected the Södermanland pronunciation of si, and thus Šimon referred to a Varangian having the Christian name Simon. According to Braun, the Patronicon was based on the account of a Varangian who would have reported that \\"Jakun had expelled his nephew (*frjándi) Simon Afrekąson\\". Basing himself on Braun's analysis, Pritsak suggests that Jarl Hákon Eiríksson had a brother named *Afreki who is unattested in Old Norse sources. This brother would have died and then Hákon banished his nephew Simon which may have been due to Afreki having cooperated with Olaf II of Norway. Simon would have been only c. 12 years old.Pritsak 1981:419  See also  * Vorontsov - one of several Russian noble families who claimed male-line descent from Šimon Notes Bibliography * Pritsak, O.

He is a specialist in bipolar disorder (also known as manic- depressive illness) and recurrent depression.http://drgoodwin.com/index.php?page=bio Accessed on March 2, 2011 Life and career Goodwin was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. He received a B.S. from Georgetown University in 1958 and his M.D. from St. Louis University in 1963, and was a psychiatric resident at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. In 1965, Goodwin joined the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and served as NIMH Scientific Director and Chief of Intramural Research from 1981 to 1988. He was the first to report a controlled study on the effects of lithium in bipolar disorder. In July 1988, he was appointed by President Reagan's VP, George H. W. Bush to head ADAMHA, the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration, from which he resigned following controversy over his \\"Violence Initiative\\" where he used the word \\"monkey\\" in the text of one of his slides relating to his comments about inner-city youth and, by making the analogous comparison to primate behavioral studies, how they were prone to similar atavistic behavior due to the prevailing environmental conditions. Even though the term was grossly misinterpreted by the press, the immediate aftermath created a storm of controversy and attacks by other scientists within NIMH, the press and congress which eventually forced Goodwin out as director of ADMHA. After a short time period following the perceived misstep, he was reprimanded in the form of being appointed by then DHHS Secretary Sullivan, to head NIMH, a small step down, from 1992 until resigning in 1994. Goodwin had been on a consistent upward trajectory and had he avoided the controversy, its very possible he could have ascended to director of NIH which was one of his ambitions or even possibly secretary of HHS. He is a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Scienceshttp://www.iom.edu/Global/DIrector/Detail.aspx?id=0000045478 and a fellow of the ACNP. He is a founder of the journal Psychiatry Research, and on the editorial boards of a number of other journals. He was president of the Psychiatric Research Society, elected in 1998. Goodwin is a recipient of the major research awards in his field including the Hofheimer Prize from the American Psychiatric Association, the International Anna-Monika Prize for Research in Depression, the Edward A. Strecker Award, the Nola Maddox Falcone Prize from NARSAD (now known as the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation), the McAlpin Research Award from the National Mental Health Association, the Distinguished Service Award from the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), and the Research Award from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. He was the first recipient of the Psychiatrist of the Year from Psychiatric Times, and the Fawcett Humanitarian Award of the NDMDA (now the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance. Goodwin was one of only five psychiatrists on the Current Contents list of the most frequently cited scientists in the world and one of 12 listed in The Best Doctors in the U.S. Another focus of Goodwins' research was in SAD (seasonal affective disorder) where he enthusiastically endorsed the used of light therapy to assist with combating the debilitating effects of SAD a form of depression. Goodwin published 'Manic Depressive Illness' in 1990 with Kay Redfield Jamison, republished in 2007, which is considered a classic in the field. Goodwin hosted the award-winning radio show The Infinite Mind. Started in 1997, the show (which at its height aired on over 300 public radio stations throughout the country), won more than 30 journalism awards over 10 years and was considered “public radio’s most honored and listened to health and science program.\\" Since retiring from government, Goodwin has been actively involved in educating other psychiatrists through continuing medical education (CME) programs and pharmaceutical speakers' bureaus. Pharmaceutical company links The acknowledgements to Goodwin's 'Manic Depressive Illness' states that: \\"During the time that this book was in preparation, Dr. Goodwin received research support from George Washington University Medical Center, the Foundation for Education and Research on Mental Illness, the Dalio Family Foundation, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, and Solvay. He has received honoraria from GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Solvay, and Eli Lilly and unrestricted educational grants to support the production of this book from Abbott Laboratories, AstraZeneca, Bristol Meyers Squibb, Forest Laboratories, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, and Sanofi\\". The Infinite Mind An article in The New York Times (Nov. 21, 2008) said that Goodwin had hosted programs that recommended the use of drugs, without disclosing that he had received over a million dollars from their manufacturers. Goodwin was also on the board of directors of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, an \\"industry-funded front, or \\"Astroturf\\" group, which receives a majority of its funding from drug companies.\\" and the radio show was also directly part- funded by pharmaceutical companies which was also not disclosed. Bill Lichtenstein, the senior executive producer of the show, said that Goodwin had not disclosed payments from pharmaceutical companies, in violation of a strict conflict of interest contract. Goodwin said that Lichtenstein was aware of his educational speaking and consulting activities for pharmaceutical companies, and that in 2005 Goodwin had switched to guest host and let Peter D. Kramer host other shows, including those discussing psychopharmacological treatment, for that reason. An assistant producer of The Infinite Mind independently supported Goodwin's claim. However, 'On The Media' later issued an apology for not contacting Lichtenstein, who reports that when he himself contacted the source she said \\"she had no knowledge or evidence to support Goodwin's claim...that Lichtenstein or \\"The Infinite Mind\\" was aware that Goodwin was being paid to give marketing talks on behalf of pharmaceutical companies\\". In addition, Lichtenstein points out that Goodwin has told the BMJ (formerly the British Medical Journal) that he didn't believe there had been a conflict of interest, and told George Washington University student newspaper that \\"I frankly do not see these things as a conflict of interest . . . I've always thought that if you have multiple relationships they sort of cancel each other out\\". In 2008, Sen. Charles Grassley (IA-R) conducted investigations regarding possible conflicts of interest between various academic psychiatrists and pharmaceutical companies. Goodwin issued a statement that The New York Times article and the follow-up editorial were filled with misstatements of fact and false implications. Grassley said in regard to a 2008 show in which Goodwin took part: \\"“After listening to a recording of the show, it appeared to me that the real effect of this particular episode was to undercut any criticism that antidepressants might be linked to an increased risk of suicide.\\" The Infinite Mind program, which was independently produced and distributed, was slated to end its production at the end of 2008 due to a lack of funding. Nevertheless, following the controversy, NPR cancelled the broadcast of reruns of the show on its Sirius Satellite Radio channel.

Sarah Vaughan with Clifford Brown inkblotmagazine.com Retrieved on 2008-05-31. In its review, All Music states that \\"Vaughan is arguably in the best voice of her career here\\" and praises Brown for \\"displaying his incredible bop virtuosity\\", indicating that \\"[i]n whichever incarnation it's reissued, Sarah Vaughan With Clifford Brown is one of the most important jazz-meets-vocal sessions ever recorded,\\" although All Music is incorrect in suggesting that the album was retitled; Brown's name has been highlighted on some reissues of the album since 1990 although most reissues duplicate the original album cover. The Blackwell Guide to Recorded Jazz, also praising Brown's \\"brilliant\\" trumpeting, delves into Vaughan's vocal stylings in detail, encouraging listeners of the album to note how \\"sometimes she stretches out a song so deliberately and so reconfigures its melody, that the lyrics lose sense, linguistic phrasing having been replaced by musical phrasing\\". Blackwell author Barry Dean Kernfeld opines that \\"[i]t is perhaps this pure devotion to the exploration of sound that has made her such a favourite of jazz listeners\\". In Jazz: A Critic's Guide to the 100 Most Important Recordings, New York Times jazz commentator Ben Ratliff placed the album as among Vaughan's best, indicating that the recording session seemed among those blessed sessions where \\"even middle-level musicians can sound like gods\\". The Penguin Guide to Jazz selected this album as part of its suggested \\"Core Collection,\\" stating \\"it is very difficult to find any flaw in what should be recognized as one of the great jazz vocal records,\\" and awarded it \\"crown\\" status. But even while praising the album, some critics found elements of fault. Ratliff expresses distaste for the album's \\"shizy moments, when...[Vaughan] rockets between hoity-toity...and so blues-singer earthy, in certain low-register moments, that she approaches vulgarity\\".Ratliff, 91. A contemporaneous review in the music magazine Metronome lamented that \\"Sarah sounds like an imitation of herself, sloppy, affected and so concerned with sound that she forgets that she is a singer, forgets the lyric of the song itself to indulge in sounds that are meaningless.\\" Kernfeld suggests that Herbie Mann is a weak element amongst the otherwise strong ensemble, \\"completely overmatched\\".

The British units remained in France, and the Indian elements were sent to Egypt to help form the 1st Mounted Division. History Lt. Gen.

D. Fanshawe. The division was re-designated the 4th Cavalry Division in November 1916. During the war, they served in the trenches as infantry. The large number of early officer casualties affected the division's later performance. British officers who understood the language, customs, and psychology of their men could not be quickly replaced, and the alien environment of the Western Front affected the soldiers. The division served in France and Flanders, held in reserve for the expected breakthrough. It provided dismounted parties for trench duty, but its only battle was the Battle of Cambrai during the German counterattacks of 30 November – 3 December. In March 1918, the division was broken up and the Indian regiments were combined in Egypt with the Yeomanry Mounted Division to form the 1st Mounted Division (later the 4th Cavalry Division).

Biography  After his Abitur, Pispers moved to Bonn and later Münster where he studied English, theology and pedagogy. From 1979 to 1980 he worked as a foreign language assistant in England, where he developed a liking for black comedy. After returning to Germany, he worked as a member of several children's theatre and cabaret arrangements. His first solo programme, Kabarette sich, wer kann (a pun on \\"rette sich, wer kann\\" - \\"save yourself if you can\\"), first opened in 1983. In the same year he finished his education and started working as an English teacher. In 1990, he became a member of the ensemble of the Kom(m)ödchen in Düsseldorf and later on its artistic director. However, in 1991, he gave up this position to tour Germany with his solo programmes. Over the 1990s he received a number of awards and became a well-known figure in German political cabaret. In 2002 he first went on tour with his programme ...bis neulich (\\"...until recently\\"), which was originally conceived as a Best of his twenty years in cabaret. It was extremely successful and made him a lot more popular, especially due to his harsh criticism of the George W. Bush administration and the Iraq War. Due to its huge success, Pispers continued to tour Germany with the programme, which he frequently updated according to recent developments, until 2015. He has also become a staunch critic of unregulated capitalism. He currently lives in Düsseldorf-Oberkassel in the German state of North Rhine- Westphalia.

Early life Warner was born near Lawrence, Kansas, in 1891. His parents divorced during his early childhood. His mother cared for his two sisters but their father took James and his two brothers to an orphanage in Wichita and left them there. At the age of five, he was adopted by a German family named Oswald and spent most of the rest of his childhood living and working on their farm. He also spent about a year in Germany with his adopted family. James attended both local German and English language schools in Lawrence through eighth grade and reportedly made friends easily. At age fourteen he left home and went to Wichita where he found work in a butcher shop, refusing his adopted father's pleas to return home. After learning from someone how to make harness dressing with lard and lamp black, the teenaged Warner saved enough to buy a donkey and cart, from which he sold the dressing, meanwhile making his way to Denver, where he worked in a bowling alley setting pins. He later went to Boulder, Colorado, and worked driving a team of horses with a road-grader. At about the age of eighteen, he got a job on a dairy farm where he reportedly milked 50 cows twice a day and developed the large forearms he kept for the rest of his life. He bought a dairy route from the farmer, making daily deliveries. However, this ended when he and the dairy farmer had a dispute and Warner lost his substantial investment. Following this he may have spent time as a hobo during his late teens, which was fairly common in early 20th-century North America, riding the rails and living in hobo encampments. Naval service In 1911 at about age twenty Warner went to Denver and enlisted in the US Navy. He spent boot camp at Goat Island (later called Yerba Buena Island) in San Francisco Bay. Warner was then sent to the western Pacific and on to China where he served on gunboats patrolling the Yangtze River. He advanced to Quartermaster first class and in 1916 trained in the then-new rating of Electricians Mate, Radio. By 1919 he was one of the first chief radiomen in the US Navy. During World War I Warner served on the USS Parker, which patrolled the coasts of Ireland. He was then assigned to the USS St. Louis. Warner may have also sometimes served as a German–English interpreter for naval officers after the war. He was later assigned as a radio instructor in San Diego and commanded the compass station at Point Reyes in Northern California. On 30 March 1928 Warner left the navy in San Francisco. Southern Cross RAAF base near Canberra in 1943, 15 years after its historic flight across the Pacific. By this time Warner was serving as a naval radio instructor at Texas A&M; University. Through friends he learned Harry Lyon was thinking of going with Charles Kingsford Smith on a planned long-distance flight from California, across the Pacific Ocean. He tried to talk his friend Lyon out of the flight, but wound up on the crew. On 31 May 1928, the four- person crew took off from Oakland, California, in the Southern Cross. After a stop for rest and refueling in Hawaii, they flew to Fiji, enduring over 34 hours of flight across open sea before touching down at Albert Park in Suva, where a large and enthusiastic crowd greeted the first aircraft ever to land in Fiji.30 May 2003 – 75th Anniversary of Smithy's Landing at Albert Park The Southern Cross landed at Eagle Farm Airport in Brisbane, Australia, on 9 JuneFamous Fokker Flights before a crowd of 25,000 people.History of Eagle Farm , Our BrisbanePhoto of Southern Cross, and welcoming crowd, at Eagle Farm on June 9, 1928, National Archives of Australia\\"Magnificent Machines – Home- grown Legends\\", The Sydney Morning Herald They flew to Sydney the following day. The flight of the Southern Cross marked the first successful use of radio on a long distance flight. Returning to California, Warner and Lyon each were given a 4 oz gold commemorative medal along with $10,000 from the citizens of Oakland and William Randolph Hearst. Warner then bought two aeroplanes and started training for a flight to Japan. However, during a crude in-air refuelling whilst trying to set an endurance record, the pilot of the single- engine craft fell asleep and landed upside-down in the mud flats near San Mateo and San Francisco Bay. Warner's flight to Japan never got beyond planning. Later career In about 1930 Warner went to Los Angeles where he opened a radio shop. He hired an engineer and the two designed and manufactured a superheterodyne kit which could be installed in the era's heterodyne radio receivers. He also experimented with building an electronic organ and was hired by Hearst to install a sound system at San Simeon in Northern California. Later during the Great Depression of the 1930s Warner moved to Fresno and worked for a water softener business, traveling in California’s Central Valley. He met his future wife in Highway City north of Fresno, where she owned a roadside diner. In August 1940 Warner was recalled into the navy and sent to Hawaii. In 1941 he was transferred to the Navy’s central receiving station in Washington DC. Warner was then assigned to College Station, Texas, in March 1943, where he taught radio at Texas A&M; University until the end of World War II.

Early life Howard was born to Charles Preston Howard and Maude L. (Lewis) Howard in Des Moines, Iowa. His parents were African-American. His father, a friend of civil rights leader Dr. Ralph Bunche, was a native of South Carolina, his mother has been described as Native American (Sioux). but was actually a daughter of Thomas D. Lewis (1846–1909) and Mary Adeline Tann (1855–1939) of Fayette, Iowa, both members of a farming colony of free people of color that settled in Northeast Iowa in 1853. Joseph's grandfather Lewis had the distinction of being a private in the 38th Regiment USCT, one of four USCT units that were the first US troops to march into Richmond, Virginia when it fell in April, 1865. Joseph's great-uncle Theodore Wright Lewis (1853–1922), an AME pastor who served churches in Iowa, Illinois and Kansas was one of the founding members of the NAACP in the Davenport, Iowa and Rock Island, Illinois area. His father was a lawyer and one of the original founders of the National Bar Association, an association of African-American attorneys. Howard served in the U.S. Army from 1944 to 1946. During World War II, he commanded Filipino troops and ran a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. He was honorably discharged with the rank of Captain. Education After his discharge, Howard resumed his education at the University of Iowa and graduated in 1950 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Prior to the war, Howard had tried out for and made the football team; he was the only black player on the team. During a 1944 game against the Indiana University, his coach yelled out to the Iowa defense: \\"We gotta stop that nigger\\", referring to the opposing team's running back. Howard immediately walked up to his coach and asked him to apologize; he didn't, and Howard quit the team. Later at the Drake University Law School, he became the first African-American student admitted to the Phi Alpha Delta legal fraternity. He earned his Bachelor of Laws in 1955 and was married to Gwendolyn Mae London that same year. Howard received a Master of Arts from Drake University in 1957 and a Juris Doctor from Drake University Law School in 1968. Law practice In 1959, after they moved to Baltimore, Maryland, Howard passed the Maryland bar exam and then started a law firm (Howard & Hargrove) with his brother, Charles P. Howard, and John R. Hargrove Sr. (who also went on to become a U.S. district judge). In 1964, Howard became assistant state's attorney in Baltimore and later became the first African-American chief of the trial section of the state's attorney's office. Two years into the job, Howard criticized his superiors and Baltimore police for pursuing harsher penalties against alleged black rapists when the victims were white than the penalties they sought when the victims were black. Howard was ordered to issue a report to back up his allegations. In the report he cited that 30 black men had been executed for raping white woman, but no one, black or white, had been executed for raping a black woman. In 1967, he became assistant city solicitor. State judicial service Prior to 1968, vacancies on the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City were filled by the Governor of Maryland with white males and usually confirmed by the voters of Baltimore. In 1968, 81 of the 82 judges on Maryland's appellate and circuit courts where white males. Maryland governors had been slow to appoint blacks to the bench, even though the city was majority African American. Howard challenged the system and ran for judge without the blessings of the governor. He won by 8,000 votes over his nearest competitor, and became the first African-American to run for and win a seat on that bench. As a judge, he challenged the racial hiring practices of the supreme bench and helped racially diversify the offices and employ minorities at the circuit court as well. Federal judicial service Howard was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on May 22, 1979, to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, to a new seat created by 92 Stat. 1629. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 4, 1979, and received his commission on October 5, 1979, becoming the first African-American judge of the District of Maryland. He assumed senior status on November 15, 1991. His service was terminated on September 16, 2000, due to his death.

It served on the Western Front, being renamed as 5th Cavalry Division on 26 November 1916. In March 1918, the 5th Cavalry Division was broken up. The British and Canadian units remained in France and the Indian elements were sent to Egypt to help constitute 2nd Mounted Division. History The division sailed for France from Bombay on 16 October 1914, under the command of Major General G A Cookson. During the war the division would serve in the trenches as infantry. Due to the difference on troop levels each cavalry brigade, once dismounted, formed a dismounted regiment. In March 1916 the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division was attached to the British Fourth Army. On 1 July 1916 the 9th (Secunderabad) Cavalry Brigade moved into a reserve position on the Somme, ready to exploit any breakthrough. The same brigade was sent up again on 14 July, to Montauban to support the attack on the Bazentin – Longueval ridge. At 17.30 the leading two regiments were ordered to advance between High Wood and Delville Wood. The British 7th Dragoon Guards and the Indian 20th Deccan Horse galloped forward to a position between the woods, but little could be achieved. At 03.30 on 15 July, they returned to Montauban, having suffered casualties of 74 men and 110 horses. Cavalry units were again brought forward on 15 September to support the attack on Flers-Courcelette, but were not drawn into the fighting and played no further part in the Battle of the Somme except as labour units in reserve. The high number of officer casualties suffered early on had an effect on its later performance. British officers that understood the language, customs, and psychology of their men could not be quickly replaced, and the alien environment of the Western Front had some effect on the soldiers. The 2nd Indian Cavalry Division was renamed the 5th Cavalry Division on 26 November 1916 and attached to the 5th Army. In March 1918 the division was transferred to Egypt, although its two British regular cavalry regiments (8th Hussars and 7th Dragoon Guards) remained in France.

This is in addition to three private universities, five private colleges, and six theological colleges. There are also an extensive number of private career institutes and colleges.Listings available via the Private Career Training Institutions Agency (PCTIA) or the BC Career Colleges Association . In 2007, the population of British Columbia (BC) stood at 4,383,000.Statistics Canada, \\"Population by year, by province and territory\\" (modified 2007-11-29) Retrieved Aug 29, 2008 Approximately 433,000 people were enrolled in public post-secondary institutions in BC during the 2006–2007 academic year. More than 17,250 identified themselves as Aboriginal students and approximately 10,500 were international students. In the 2011 calendar year, 151,774 applications took place through BCcampus, a publicly funded organization whose role is to support higher education by providing leadership in the use of ICT (Information and Communications Technology). Each of the province's post-secondary institutions sets its own admission requirements. Generally, successful graduation from high school, with the required academic prerequisites, is needed for admission to programs. Special consideration may be given to mature applicants, Aboriginal peoples, and people with disabilities. Information about admissions and prerequisites is available from the registrar's office of each institution. ApplyBC.ca (formerly PASBC) was a system-wide application portal (developed by BCcampus) that allows people to apply for admission. In 2015, the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training (AEST) initiated a dialogue with the public post-secondary sector to explore a common online application platform for students applying to public post-secondary education in B.C., similar to those used in other jurisdictions.

Retrieved June 1, 2008, from http://records.viu.ca/homeroom/content/postsec/postsec.htm In the same year, Whetham College opened as a small, independent institute located in downtown Vancouver that was intent of preparing \\"its students not only for the Army, Navy and Civil Service examinations and for Matriculation Examinations in any university or college, but also for first and second year examinations in Arts leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in any university;\\" unfortunately, it closed only three years due to financial difficulties.Logan, H.T. (1958). Tuum Est: A History of the University of British Columbia. (p.13) Vancouver, BC: Mitchell Press. A second independent post-secondary institution opened in 1892 known as the Columbian Methodist College. It was opened by the Methodist Church of Canada in New Westminster, and it was affiliated with Victoria College of the University of Toronto and offered courses towards Arts & Theology degrees. McGill University affiliated with a second British Columbian high school in 1903, Victoria High School which was renamed Victoria College later to become the University of Victoria. In 1904 & 1905 McGill University received permission to improve and expand the University's course offerings in British Columbia. Two acts were passed to enable this; An Act Respecting McGill University, which gave McGill University permission to establish a University College in British Columbia for the higher education of men and women, and An Act to Incorporate the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning of British Columbia, which established the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning of British Columbia. This institution would undertake the responsibility of establishing a college anywhere in British Columbia.Humphries, D., & Hunt, W. (1988). Higher Education in British Columbia before the Establishment of UBC. Retrieved May 28, 2008, from http://www.library.ubc.ca/archives/mucbc.html Vancouver College in 1906 was formalized as McGill University College of British Columbia; then it began offering first and second year courses in Arts and Applied Sciences. Victoria College was brought under the direction of the Royal Institution in 1908, and it offered first and second year Arts courses. In this same year, the provincial government made a second attempt to establish a provincial university. They succeeded with An Act to Establish and Incorporate a University for the Province of British Columbia. It would be called the University of British Columbia, and it would be located in the western part of Point Grey. However, plans to start construction on the campus for the new university had to be postponed due to lack of funding. Meanwhile, McGill University agreed to continue providing higher education through Victoria College. Former home of Victoria College The provincial government made amendments to the Public School Act in 1894 and 1896 to allow any Canadian university to affiliate with any of the high schools in British Columbia. The high schools could then be incorporated as colleges of these institutions. McGill University was the first to take advantage of this new amendment.Hives, C. (2006). From Humble Beginnings: UBC's Origins and First Decade. Retrieved June 2, 2008, from http://www.library.ubc.ca/archives/humble.html By 1898, an affiliation between McGill University and Vancouver High School was established. The high school curriculum was extended to include the first two years of Arts and part of the school become Vancouver College in 1899. McGill University controlled the curriculum, set and marked exams, and approved the hiring of instructors. Students were required to travel to McGill to complete their studies. The provincial government granted a lease for land at Point Grey to the Royal Institution. Construction started in 1911. In 1913, the provincial government appointed Frank Wesbrook as the university's first president, in anticipation of it opening in the near future. However, in 1914, the onset of World War I halted the construction at Point Grey. There would be no more construction for almost a decade. In 1915, McGill University closed McGill University College. The provincial government changed the provincial university's name to the University of British Columbia and it opened to classes at the Fairview facilities recently vacated by McGill University. With the opening of UBC, Victoria College closed. A second Provincial Normal School was also opened in Victoria in 1915. President Wesbrook died in 1918, and Leonard Klinck became UBC's second president. UBC added the Nursing degree program in 1919. This was the first such program in the British Empire. In 1920, the Anglican Theological College opened in downtown Vancouver. On October 28, 1922, almost 1,200 students with floats, bands and banners marched through downtown Vancouver to the Point Grey campus. This was known as \\"The Great Trek\\". The students protested the inferior conditions and overcrowding of buildings at the Fairview campus. It also protested the still uncompleted construction at Point Grey. The student protest and media attention spurred the government to provide funding to finish the construction and move UBC from Fairview to Point Grey. The new Ryerson College took over the theological training curriculum at Columbian College in 1923. Columbian College continued to operate as a residential secondary school and general arts institution. On September 22, 1925 the University of British Columbia opened its first classes at the new Point Grey campus. This same year the Vancouver School of Art opened. In 1927 Ryerson College (Methodists), Westminster Hall (Presbyterians) and the Congregationalists amalgamated to form the United Church seminary, named Union College.  Mid 20th century (1930 – 1961)  The Great Depression put a halt to any further plans for higher education. UBC came close to being shut down due to government cutbacks, but Professor Henry Angus helped prevent this. In 1936, Columbian College was closed, yet in the same year; the Nanaimo Vocational School opens and starts providing vocational education. The Extension Department (later called Continuing Studies) at UBC is established, enabling UBC to bring higher education to all parts of the province. With the start of World War II in 1939, UBC's faculty, staff, and students dedicated themselves to the cause. In 1940, the Government of Canada established a military college in Victoria, Royal Roads Military College to train officers for the Canada's armed forces. After World War II, UBC's President Norman MacKenzie declared any returning veteran was guaranteed a space at UBC. As a result, student numbers tripled to over 9,000 by 1947 and UBC experienced a crunch in classroom space and a lack of faculty to teach the extra classes that were needed. In 1949, the Vancouver Vocational Institute opened. By 1956, a new provincial Teacher Training Program was established at UBC, and the Victoria and Vancouver Normal Schools were closed. In 1960, the British Columbia Vocational School opened under direct management of the provincial government. MacDonald report and expansion of the public post- secondary system (1962 – 1988) In 1962, John B. MacDonald recommended changes in the post-secondary system in British Columbia.Higher Education in British Columbia and a Plan for the Future A recommendation of the MacDonald report was the establishment of two-year community colleges offering programs in four fields of education: academic (university transfer); career/technical, to train students for specific employment with programs ranging in duration from a few weeks to two or more years; vocational, offering short applied programs of a year or less; and adult basic education to prepare those without high school graduation for other post-secondary programs or for employment. The report marked the development of British Columbia's Post Secondary School System. In the same year, King Edward Continuing Education Centre and the private Christian evangelical college, Trinity Junior College both open their doors. In 1963, the provincial legislature passed an act to establish Simon Fraser University. The University of Victoria was established in 1963 and moved to the Gordon Head campus. Also, the legislature charted Notre Dame University College of Nelson as a private, Catholic university. The British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) opened in 1964. Simon Fraser University opened in 1965. This same year saw the opening of the first college recommended by the MacDonald report; Vancouver City College. Vancouver City College was the first autonomous community college in BC, formed by amalgamating Vancouver Vocational Institute, Vancouver School of Art, and King Edward Continuing Education Centre. Community colleges around the province started opening between 1966 and 1975: Selkirk College opened in 1966 followed by Capilano College, College of New Caledonia, Okanagan Regional College, and Malaspina College in 1968. Cariboo College and Douglas College were opened in 1970 followed by Camosun College in 1971, and East Kootenay Community College, North Island College, Northern Lights College, and Northwest Community College all opened in 1975. In 1971, Union College and the Anglican Theological College joined to form the Vancouver School of Theology at UBC. Also in 1971, UBC became the first university in Canada to offer a program in Women's Studies for academic credit. Trinity Junior College was renamed Trinity Western College in 1972. The government established the Post-Secondary Articulation Coordinating Committee in 1974 to provide a means of determining whether post-secondary institutions could apply previous credit at another British Columbia institution toward completion of a program. This same year, Simon Fraser University (SFU) became the first university in Canada to have a female president with Pauline Jewett's installment. Then in 1975, the provincial government passed the Royal Roads Military College Degrees Act enabling Royal Roads to grant degrees. In 1977, BCIT opened Sea Island Campus in RichmondBritish Columbia Institute of Technology: About the Institute: History, (n.d) Retrieved June 25, 2008, from https://www.bcit.ca/about/history.shtml The year, 1978 saw the establishment of the Open Learning Institute, the Pacific Vocational Institute, the Justice Institute, the Pacific Marine Training Institute, and the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design (ECIAD). In 1981, Kwantlen College formed as a separate institution from Douglas College. Then in 1983, the Nicola Valley Institute of Technology opened to address the low participation and success rates of First Nations students in higher education. 1984 saw the closure of the Notre Dame University of Nelson due to costs per student. In 1985, the Government of British Columbia supported a private member's bill that would change Trinity Western College to Trinity Western University. BCIT merged with the Pacific Vocational Institute in 1986. In 1988, the Open Learning Agency was formed by combining the Open Learning Institute and the Knowledge Network. Focus on transferability and the creation of university colleges (1989–2007) The British Columbia Council on Admissions and Transfer (BCCAT) was created in 1989 to address the concerns about mobility and transferability of program credit throughout British Columbia, especially with regards to university colleges and students wanting to transfer from their local colleges to provincial universities. Between 1989 and 1995, four two-year community colleges became four-year degree-granting university-colleges: University College of the Cariboo, Malaspina University College, University College of the Fraser Valley, and Kwantlen University College. In 1993, Yukon College became a part of the BC credit transfer system. This same year, Aboriginal peoples in British Columbia established Wilp Wilxo'oskwhl Nisga'a, a community driven, student focused aboriginal post-secondary institute. In 1994, Vancouver Community College's Langara campus separated into an independent college, and it was renamed Langara College. Also in 1994, the University of Northern British Columbia opened, and the Pacific Marine Institute merged with BCIT. Two Aboriginal education institutes — the Nicola Valley Institute of Technology and the Institute of Indigenous Government — were designated as public post-secondary institutions in 1995. That same year, the provincial government passed the College and Institute Act that provided university colleges, colleges, and institutes with authority to grant associate degrees, diplomas, and certificates. Also, 1995 saw the closure of Royal Roads Military College; yet by 1996, Royal Roads University opened on the same campus. In 1999, the Technical University of BC opened only to be shut down in 2002. Simon Fraser University assumed responsibility for the students and facilities of the former Technical University of BC and established its Surrey campus. Also in 2002, the Government of British Columbia passed the Degree Authorization Act that enabled private universities to grant BC degrees. The act also expanded degree-granting capacity for colleges (applied baccalaureates) and university-colleges and institutes (applied masters). The University College of the Cariboo and the Open Learning Agency amalgamated in 2005 to become Thompson Rivers University. Also in 2005, Okanagan University College is split to become UBC's Okanagan campus and Okanagan College, and the British Columbia government approves new private degree programs at Sprott Shaw College, University Canada West, and Columbia Colleges. In 2006, Canada and British Columbia's first private sector, for-profit, university, University Canada West, opens in Victoria. Former University of Victoria president, David Strong is the first president of UCW. A year later in 2007, Canada and British Columbia's first private, non-profit secular liberal arts and sciences university, Quest University Canada, opens in Squamish. Former UBC president, David Strangway is the first president of QUC.  Creation of teaching universities (2008 – present)  On April 29, 2008, changes to the University Act established five new teaching universities: University of the Fraser Valley (formerly University College of the Fraser Valley), Kwantlen Polytechnic University (formerly Kwantlen College), Vancouver Island University (formerly Malaspina University College), Capilano University (formerly Capilano College), and Emily Carr University of Art and Design (formerly Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design). Structure and Governance University of Victoria Engineering & Computer Science Building Aerial view of Simon Fraser University at Burnaby, British Columbia The provincial government is responsible for higher education in British Columbia. It enacts legislation regarding the establishment, management, and operation of post-secondary institutions. The government also provides leadership and support for post-secondary education.British Columbia. Ministry of Advanced Education. (n.d.a). About the Ministry.

In addition, it is responsible for intergovernmental issues, performance accountability, data management and analysis, and policy related to transitions within the post- secondary education system. To maintain the quality and accreditation of higher education in British Columbia, the government passed legislation titled the Degree Authorization ActDegree Authorization Act (2002) that established criteria for when either a private or out-of-province public institution applies for consent to provide degree programs or use the word \\"university\\" in British Columbia, or new degree programs are proposed by British Columbia's current public post-secondary institutions. A Degree Quality Assessment BoardDegree Quality Assessment Board established in 2002 works with the government on reviews and makes recommendations to the Minister on institution applications. Higher education institutions in British Columbia have particular mandates and serve specific community needs. They are able to decide how to achieve their mandate and deal with the various levels of administrative details with regard to operations, faculty, staff, and students. Research universities such as the University of British Columbia (Vancouver and Okanagan), University of Victoria, Simon Fraser University, and the University of Northern British Columbia operate under a bicameral structure composed of a Board of Governors and a Senate. Thompson Rivers University uses a tri-cameral system, which includes a Planning Council for Open Learning.Thompson Rivers University Act Teaching intensive universities, such as Royal Roads University, colleges and institutes each have a Board of Governors, but instead of a Senate they have a council (e.g. Academic Council) . In addition to those bodies, Royal Roads University has a Program and Research Council. Before the legislation of the \\"College and Institute Act\\"College and Institute Act in 1996, these institutions used to follow a form of governance based on administrative or governing board authority. When the new act came into effect, the bicameral governance permitted faculty to play a role in board governance in a senate-type body where before decisions were made by administrators and board members.Levin, J.S. (2003). Organizational paradigm shift and the university colleges of British Columbia. Higher Education, 46 (4), 447-467. Private career and college institutions fall under the auspice of the Degree Authorization Act, but only if they provide degrees or call themselves \\"university.\\" Institutions that offer only diploma or certificate programs are legislated by the Private Career Training Institutions Act,Private Career Training Institutions Act (2003) and have to register with the Private Career Training Institutions Agency (PCTIA). This self-regulating agency is governed by a board of appointed industry representatives and the board's responsibility is to provide information and consumer protection to the students of registered institutions and to establish standards of quality that must be met by its accredited institutions.  Funding for public post-secondary institutions \\"Public post-secondary institutions in British Columbia receive about one-half of their total revenue from the provincial government in the form of grants from AVED. The rest they receive from tuition, ancillary services, federal grants, donations, endowments, investments and research revenue.\\"British Columbia. Office of the Auditor General. (2006).

Base funding amounts to just under 90% of total government funding . This funding is allocated based on the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) student spaces each institution is allocated. Institutions receive on average $7,200 per FTE for the majority of their programs. Institutions are able to choose which programs they offer and which they will fund. The second part of higher education funding is strategic funding, designed to create spaces for high priority areas with significant labour market demand, such as health and nursing. This type of funding is associated with increasing the number of graduates from high priority programs, expanding online access, and establishes permanent British Columbia Leadership Chairs and British Columbia Regional Innovation Chairs via the Leading Edge Endowment Fund.Pakravan, P.

In relation to the system, more funding is necessary to focus on the specific targets of post-secondary achievement by progressively introducing outcome and performance measurements and accountability into the budgeting process. Tuition fees vary across specific program areas, and detailed information on tuition rates is available from each institution directly.

Student financial assistance  Financial assistance for students attending post-secondary institutions in British Columbia can be either from government or private sources. The government administers a variety of student assistance programs for Canadian citizens, protected persons, and permanent residents. Both loans and grants are available for qualified full-time and part-time students. Such loans include Canada Student Loans and British Columbia Student Loans. Students also may be eligible for Canada Student Grants, depending upon their financial need and personal circumstances. BC Awards Online is a collection of scholarships, bursaries, and awards for British Columbia secondary students planning to attend a post-secondary institution in British Columbia. Other resources include Studentawards.com, a database of scholarships, bursaries, grants and fellowships operated by an online advertising and market research data collection company, ScholarshipsCanada.com (operated by EDge Interactive, a student recruitment company), and while searches can be tailored to focus on British Columbia, both websites require registration and personal information for access to the databases. Gustavson School Of Business University of Victoria For Aboriginal students, resources are available at First Nations Education Steering Committee's Scholarships and Bursaries and the federal government's Aboriginal Bursary System. For students with disabilities, resources are available at National Educational Association of Disabled Students. The federal government also has listings for British Columbia in a section of its web-site dedicated to youth, Scholarships and Bursaries. The Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC) manages more than 150 scholarship programs on behalf of the federal government, domestic and foreign agencies, and private sector companies. International students with a permit to study in Canada are usually qualified to apply for entrance or transfer scholarships, and they should contact their intended institution's awards and financial assistance office for further information. There are also a wide variety of scholarships and bursaries for all types and levels of students, many provided through corporations, private organizations, and individual donors that are associated with a particular institution and information about these financial awards are available from the awards and financial services at each institution. Equity, mobility, and access Aboriginal students First Nations totem pole and longhouse at the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia There is a concentrated effort in British Columbia to increase access to higher education for aboriginal peoples. The Council of Ministers of Education, Canada (CMEC), commissioned a report in 2002 that stated only 38% of Aboriginal students were found to finish high school, compared with 77% of non-Aboriginal students. The legacy of residential schools, of distrust or indifference to the school system, which is seen as antagonistic to their culture, and the lack of reflection of an Aboriginal perspective in the secondary system were all cited as factors in the poor performance and completion of Aboriginals in the secondary system which subsequently affects enrolment of Aboriginal peoples in post-secondary education.Council of Ministers of Education, Canada.

These institutions offer academic, vocational, technical, and continuing education for adults, striving to provide bilingual, bicultural certificate, diploma, and degree programs in areas such as forest rangers/technicians, fishery technicians, biologists, and scientists and training in hospitality and tourism, social services, trades, and financial planning. The following universities offer the largest number of programs designed specifically for Aboriginal students and also have some of the largest enrolments of Aboriginal peoples: Thompson Rivers University, Simon Fraser University, University of Northern British Columbia, University of Victoria, University of British Columbia, and Royal Roads University. On April 24, 2007, the provincial government announced a $65-million \\"Aboriginal Post- Secondary Education Strategy\\" to close the education gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people.Aboriginal Post-Secondary Education Strategy This strategy aimed to accomplish this goal by: # Increasing the opportunity for Aboriginal students and those who want to be by providing funding to the Aboriginal Endowment Scholarship, the Chief Joe Mathias B.C. Aboriginal Scholarship, Alberta Centennial Scholarships and loan options through StudentAid BC. # Supporting three-year Aboriginal service plans created by communities and institutions to develop partnerships that will encourage people to access post-secondary programs that will lead to jobs in their local areas. # Increasing opportunities for institutions and communities to develop Aboriginal-focused programs that recognize cultural and learning needs, like the Aboriginal Special Projects Fund. # Building supportive ways to help Aboriginal people enter the education system through adult basic education, upgrading and beyond up to graduate levels to reach their goals. # Providing institutions with funding to build culturally welcoming structures and gathering places that will lower isolation and increase retention by reflecting the character, community and traditions of Aboriginal cultures. # Encouraging Aboriginal perspectives and decision making by supporting Aboriginal participation on public post-secondary education boards. # Continuing to address the education needs of Aboriginal students by working with institutions to create a system-wide standard to track participation and success. Aboriginal students have personal and academic support like that offered through the First Nations House of Learning at the University of British Columbia, which offers students a \\"home away from home\\" and can help to alleviate the feelings of isolation and loneliness that many Aboriginal people feel, especially at large urban universities and colleges. The same principle is available at the University of Victoria at their First Peoples House and Simon fraser university's first nations Student Centre. Every public post-secondary institution in British Columbia provides services or liaisons for Aboriginal students . Thompson Rivers University, for example, provides an Elder-in-Residence in their Aboriginal Cultural Centre. The University of British Columbia provides a wide range of programs and services to Aboriginal students, starting with the First Nations House of Learning, established in 1987, that ensures that students have access to a range of supports. Other programs available at UBC includes the Residency Program, Aboriginal Health and Community Administration Program, CH'NOOK Aboriginal Business Education, First Nations Language Program, Indigenous Studies Program (Okanagan campus), Native Indian Teacher Education Program and Ts\\"kel Graduate Studies in Education. There is also a specialized campus library at the First Nations House of Learning called Xwi7xwa Library. The University of Victoria also has a wide range of programs and services to Aboriginal students. One key component is the LE,NONET Project, which is composed of a network supporting Aboriginal students at UVic through a Bursary Program, Peer Mentoring, Community Internships, Research Apprenticeships, and Staff and Faculty Aboriginal Cultural Training. In addition, there's also the Aboriginal Language Revitalization Program, an Office of Indigenous Affairs, First Nations Partnership Programs in Early Childhood and Youth Care, Indigenous Governance Program, Indigenous Studies Program, Indigenous Initiatives at the School of Social Work, and the Native Students Union. There are associations involved with Aboriginal peoples in higher education, such as the Indigenous Aboriginal Higher Learning Association and the First Nations Education Steering Committee (FNESC) Post-Secondary Sub-Committee. Students with disabilities The Student Recreation Centre at the University of British Columbia British Columbians with disabilities attending post-secondary institutions have access to some of the most accessible campuses in Canada. Disability services are prevalent at almost all campuses. Assistive Technology BC works on contract with the provincial government. Its mandate is \\"to provide technology support services ... to reduce barriers caused by the disability in meeting educational and employment goals. Through this program, adults with disabilities who are post-secondary students and/or clients of EPPD are eligible for special technology support services. These services include assessment, consultation loan of adaptive technology and training on the use of technology, all of which facilitate independence with reading, writing, and communication within learning and work situations\\" British Columbia.

International students The McPherson Library at the University of Victoria International students have been coming to British Columbia for post-secondary education for almost as long as the higher education system has been established in the province. Globalization and modern technology has made it easier to obtain education in other countries, and governments are taking note when they consider their post-secondary student populations as a possible source of skilled workers to join the local economy. In 1983, the BC Ministry of Advanced Education, Training and Technology established the International Education and Training Group (IETG), a forum for discussion between colleges, institutes and universities, and the ministries of Education and Advanced Education. Five years later in 1988, the provincial government commissioned a study on international education issues. The study reported that BC's institutions were uncoordinated in their internationalization efforts, were failing to present a professional image abroad, and that the province was not sufficiently proactive. In 1990, this led to the formation of the British Columbia Centre for International Education (BCCIE)—the first such organization in Canada. The total number of international students in British Columbia for the year of 2006 was 44,799, up from 23,011 in 1997.Canada. Citizenship and Immigration. (2006).

There is no public subsidization, and international students pay a mostly full-tuition fee basis. Most international students obtain funding either through personal resources (e.g., family or savings), or obtain funding through the institution, such as entrance awards. There are some government funds, but are usually open to nationals of developing countries only. The Canadian Bureau for International Education lists some of those awards.http://www.destineducation.ca/intstdnt/awards_e.htm The Off-Campus Work Permit Program for international students at public institutions was launched nationally as a formalized program on April 27, 2006. Prior to the introduction of this program, students were only allowed to work on the campus of the educational institution at which they were studying. Students who qualify for the program will be able to work up to 20 hours per week off- campus while classes are in session, full-time during summer and winter breaks, and over their reading weeks. In April 2008, the Government of Canada's Minister of Citizenship and Immigration announced changes to work permits for international students who graduate from eligible programs at certain Canadian post-secondary institutions, making it easier to attract foreign students to Canada. For the first time, international students would be able to obtain an \\"open work permit\\" under the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program, with no restrictions on the type of employment and no requirement for a job offer. In addition, the duration of the work permit has been extended to three years across the country. Previously, the program only allowed international students to work for one or two years, depending on location. A minimum of one year of work experience in managerial, professional or technical positions (i.e., at level 0, A or B under the National Occupational Classification system) will be necessary to apply to stay permanently through the Canadian Experience Class.Canada.

International students interested in studying in British Columbia can contact the international office at the institutions they are interested in. In addition, the Government of Canada's Department of Citizenship and Immigration has information for international students about studying in Canada and applying for student visas. Transferability of program credits Koerner Library at the University of British Columbia The ability of students to transfer from one post-secondary institution to another without losing credit for coursework at a previous institution in British Columbia is enabled with the presence of the BC Council on Admissions and Transfer (BCCAT), a provincially funded agency that was created in 1989 to replace the Post-Secondary Articulation Coordinating Committee that had been established in 1974. BCCAT has a mandate to \\"facilitate admission, articulation, and transfer arrangements among BC post-secondary institutions by encouraging them to develop policies and practices regarding the transferability of post-secondary credit courses so that credit granted at one institution can be applied toward credentials at other institutions.\\" British Columbia Council on Admissions and Transfer. (2008). Mandate. Retrieved June 2, 2008, from http://www.bccat.ca/about.cfm There are formal agreements between most institutions on mutually acceptable awarding of credits in specific programs. For example, a college may deliver the first two years of an articulated degree program and a university may deliver the final two years and award the degree. Private institutions have to be approved by the Degree Quality Assessment Board and have received the minister's consent to be accepted by BCCAT as a member of the BC Transfer System. The BCCAT has a Private Degree-Granting Institutions Policy that outlines the requirements a private institution must comply with to be considered for membership in the agency.

Description It features the typical body plan of a member of the phylum Arthropoda: A segmented head, a thorax, and an abdomen. As a member of order Decapoda, this organism has 5 pairs of legs, with one pair having developed into sharper claws, or chela. This hermit crab supports the heavy shell of a gastropod with its four pairs of ambulatory legs, shielding its soft abdomen inside. It features a unique and exotic color pattern, sporting alternating bright blue and black stripes on its legs and olive green chela with white speckles on the ends. Two bright blue eyes peer out of the shell alongside two orange antennae and two orange antennules. The organism also features maxillae to help guide particles of food into its mouth. Some morphological differences arise based upon the geologic habitat the organism resides in. For instance, some individuals of Calcinus elegans found in Hawaii display orange bands on their ambulatory legs, differing from the pure blue bands found in individuals of the Indo-Pacific. Calcinus elegans is distinct from all other species in the Calcinus genus as it is the only one to be covered with small hairs known as seta.  Habitat  Calcinus elegans primarily makes its home in shallow tidal and subtidal regions found within the Indo-West Pacific, stretching from Eastern Africa to island chains just south of Hawaii. Some of them can also be found living in the tropics of The U.S. Virgin Islands near Puerto Rico. Some sightings have even been reported at various locations in Japan including the Ryuku islands, Izu, Ogasawara, Kochi, Boso, and the Kii peninsula. Its distribution primarily follows the path of the equator; these places are known to have tropical conditions such as higher ocean temperatures, clear waters, and little primary productivity. These habitats have a depth range of 0-20m, a sea surface salinity range of 30-35 ppt, and a sea surface temperature range of 20-30 degrees Celsius.  Behavior   Shell selection  Each member of the Calcinus elegans species will select a shell for itself, occasionally switching shells with other species members or empty shells it finds during its lifetime. Shell exchanges could be performed due to the current shell being structurally unstable, too heavy, or perhaps too large or small. Shell exchange was also found to occur within the Calcinus genus as a result of interspecific competition, as individuals of a certain species battle for a perfect shell. Some studies show that the sex of the individual may also play a role in the competition; this behavior is observed in individuals of Calcinus verrilli. These shells are primarily used to provide shelter and protection from predators as well as the surrounding environment. Individuals of Calcinus elegans were found to show a preference for the shells of dog whelks (Nucella lapillus), but were also observed wearing shells of the Snakehead Cowrie (Calcinus caputserpentis) and Variable Worm (Serpulorbis variabilis). This shows that the species exhibits a variety of morphology. Shell shape was also found to influence the distribution of Calcinus elegans within their habitat. Those with cowrie or variable worm shells often remained in shallow waters, refraining from entering the subtidal areas out of fear of predation. When tested, cowrie shells and variable worm shells proved to be a weak defense system against the predators of the subtidal. Calcinus elegans that wear the shells of dog whelks prefer to live within the subtidal region as their shell shape allows them to effectively deter predators. Shell shape shows no significant impact upon the travel rate to obtain food for individuals of Calcinus elegans. Therefore, there is no select locomotive advantage of wearing a certain species’ shell. Studies conducted using simulated surges show that shell shape influences the ability of Calcinus elegans to withstand wave action. Individuals wearing shells of dog whelks were proven to resist surge much more effectively than those with snakehead cowrie or variable worm shells.  Sense of smell  Calcinus elegans relies heavily on its keen sense of smell for detecting danger in the surrounding environment. This hermit crab is constantly wary of not only the smell of its predators, but the smell of gastropod shells being broken. As it relies on its gastropod shell for protection, Calcinus elegans knows that such a smell indicates that a predator is nearby and on the hunt. Usually Calcinus elegans will attempt to find shelter or a place to hide from its predators. In the event that it is unable to locate shelter, Calcinus elegans will withdraw into its shell for defense, only emerging when it feels safe or the scents of danger have passed on. Studies have shown that the amount of time that Calcinus elegans spends withdrawn into its shell is partially determined by what species of gastropod the shell belonged to.  Reproduction  The blue line hermit crab shows a sign of remarkable intelligence. These organisms will traditionally engage in unique behaviors before mating. Some such examples include the male rotating the female’s shell or rubbing their chilipeds, or claws, around the opening of the female’s shell. Unlike most crustaceans, Calcinus elegans does not perform a shell exchange during mating.  Feeding  Calcinus elegans are nocturnal omnivorous detritivores, exploring seagrass beds at night to scavenge for detritus and larger decaying plant and animal matter.  Threats   Global climate change  Ocean acidification and a continual decline in the ocean’s pH will likely have drastic consequences for hermit crabs such as Calcinus elegans. The shells of hermit crabs, primarily composed of calcium carbonate, are easily susceptible to a decline in pH. Low pH environments degrade calcium carbonate rapidly, creating a large amount of structural instability within the hermit crab’s primary defense system. Without proper protection from sturdy shells and a decline in the number of suitable shells within the environment, the population of Calcinus elegans, and other hermit crabs may begin to drop. Studies have also been performed that indicate that the resulting stress of ocean acidification could be impacting the hermit crabs’ sense of smell. Insufficient sensory stimuli were found to reduce both feeding behavior and even the rate of shell exchange. As stated before, the sense of smell is key to the survival of Calcinus elegans. If inhibited, many individuals may have difficulty sensing predators, and as such, populations could decline.  Predators  As Calcinus elegans primarily relies on the shelter of its shell for protection and defense, its primary predators are individuals who have adapted to breaking gastropod shells. The white spotted eagle ray (Aetobatis narinari) is one such predator. Found in Australia and Taiwan's Penghu Islands, this organism uses unique crushing plates in its mouth to shatter the shells of its prey. It feeds on mollusks, gastropods, and members of the Diogenidae family, which includes hermit crabs such as Calcinus elegans.  Ecology  While typically reclusive, hermit crabs will on occasion forge a relationship with other marine organisms. Some cnidarians use the hard surface of hermit crab shells to settle and grow polyps. The cnidaria aid in defending the crab from predators using their stinging cnidae and may reduce the need for frequent shell exchange. In return, the hermit crab provides them a settling ground as well as transport to new environments which may contain more nutrients for the cnidaria in the form of detritus or microorganisms. However, relationships with other organisms can prove to be complicated and are not always symbiotic; some cnidaria interfere with reproduction and may even increase a hermit crab's risk of predation. These relationships have to be carefully considered so that the benefits to the hermit crab outweigh the costs. If the cost is too high, the hermit crab may abandon its shell and locate a replacement. Some algae also use the heavy shell of Calcinus elegans as a settling ground. Many of its shells have been found crusted with coralline algae. This algae provides a strong and smooth surface for coral polyps to settle on, possibly being responsible for the symbioses that can occur between corals or other cnidarians and hermit crabs.

Author(s): Nils-Henrik Morch von der Fehr and Kai-Uwe Kuhn Source: The Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 103, No. 4, (Aug., 1995), pp. 785–812 Published by: The University of Chicago Press This is in contrast to the Coase conjecture which holds that a durable goods monopolist has no market power, and so price is equal to the competitive market price. In a December 1989 journal articleBagnoli, M., Salant, S.W., & Swierzbinski, J.E. \\"Durable-Goods Monopoly with Discrete Demand\\". The Journal of Political Economy, 97.6 (December 1989), pp. 1459–1478. (JSTOR) Mark Bagnoli, Stephen W. Salant, and Joseph E. Swierzbinski theorized that if each consumer could be relied upon to buy a good as soon as its price dipped below a certain point (with different consumers valuing goods differently, but all pursuing the same \\"get-it-while- you-can\\" strategy), then a monopolist could set prices very high initially and then \\"eat his way down the demand curve,\\" extracting maximum profit in what Bagnoli et al. called \\"the Pacman strategy\\" after the voracious video-game character. Specifically, Bagnoli et al. state that \\"Pacman is a sequential best reply to get-it-while-you-can,\\" a result they call \\"the Pacman Theorem.\\" Their proof, however, relies strongly on the assumption that there is an infinite time horizon. Durable-goods monopolists and the Coase conjecture A durable-goods monopolist sells goods which are in finite supply and which last forever, (not depreciating over time). According to the Coase Conjecture, such a monopolist has no market power as it is in competition with itself; the more of the good it sells in period one the less it will be able to sell in future periods. Assuming marginal costs are zero. In the first period the monopolist will produce quantity (Q1) where marginal cost = marginal revenue and so extract the monopoly surplus. However, in the second period the monopolist will face a new residual demand curve (Q − Q1) and so will produce quantity where the new marginal revenue is equal to the marginal cost, which is at the competitive market price. There is then an incentive for consumers to delay purchase of the good as they realize that its price will decrease over time. If buyers are patient enough they will not buy until the price falls and so durable goods monopolists face a horizontal demand curve at the equilibrium price and so will have no market power. Durable-goods monopolists and the Pacman conjecture The Pacman Conjecture on the other hand holds that consumers realize the price of the good will only fall when they purchase the good; therefore, a patient monopolist can exercise full market power and perfectly price-discriminate. The monopolist sets the price of the durable good at time t equal to the highest reservation price of a consumer who hasn't purchased prior to that point t. The consumer then buys the good as soon as it is equal to their reservation price, as they realize price will not fall further unless they purchase it. (Bagnoli et al. refer to buyers exhibiting this behavior as \\"type ℓ buyers\\", or \\"buyers following the get-it-while-you-can strategy\\".) The Pacman Conjecture requires that the monopolist to have perfect information about consumer reservation prices and an infinite time horizon. The buyers must not only follow the get-it-while- you-can strategy, but also must faithfully believe that the monopolist is following a perfect Pacman strategy (as otherwise they would be tempted to match patience with the monopolist in hopes of getting a better deal later). The monopolist will exercise full market power over the buyers in that pool, but will not be able to extract similar surpluses from buyers who come in from outside (for example, the children of the original buyers) without deviating from the pure Pacman strategy. Differences between Coase and Pacman conjectures Pacman conjecture *finite set of buyers, *infinite time horizon, *monopolists have maximum market power, *monopolists perfectly price- discriminate. Coase conjecture *Patient buyers (discount factor greater than or equal to 0.5), *non-atomic buyers, *infinite time horizon, *reservation prices are continuous, *monopolists have no market power, *price is equal to the perfectly competitive price equilibrium.

Life and career Leavitt's screenwriting career began in 1996 when he wrote Sunchaser. He wrote the screen adaptation of the Rodman Philbrick novel Freak the Mighty for the screen in 1998. The Mighty starred Sharon Stone, Gena Rowlands, Harry Dean Stanton, Kieran Culkin and Elden Henson. The film received two Golden Globe Awards for Best Supporting Actress (Sharon Stone) and Best Original Song (\\"The Mighty\\"). After writing the script for the 2001 film K-PAX, Leavitt was hired by Warner Bros. in February 2004 to rewrite an early draft of the film Blood Diamond, then titled Okavango. The story had been stuck in \\"development hell\\" at the studio for years before producers Paula Weinstein and Gillian Gorfil finally decided on the story of a Sierra Leonean farmer caught up in the conflict between an White Zimbabwean smuggler and the local diamond mining organization. Leavitt researched the diamond industry to great lengths before he began writing the screenplay, explaining that he has \\"always been a stickler for immersing [himself] in research\\". He wrote the film with the assumption that it would offend the diamond industry, particularly De Beers, and so made sure to portray the industry truthfully, aware that he could potentially be sued by De Beers and other powerful mining corporations. Paula Weinstein was impressed by Leavitt's Blood Diamond draft, but hired writers Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz to rewrite the script again; by the time he had completed the script, Zwick had become so interested in the story that he agreed to direct the film as well. Leavitt was signed by Warner Bros. in October 2006 to adapt Vanity Fair editor Doug Stumpf's novel Confessions of a Wall Street Shoeshine Boy, which the studio had acquired the rights to in mid-2005. He has also since rewritten Scott Williams' original draft of The Express: The Ernie Davis Story, a biographical film about American football player Ernie Davis. He wrote the screenplay for In the Heart of the Sea, for Intermedia and Spring Creek, and has written Animal Kingdom on spec. He re-wrote the 2014 film Seventh Son and the 2016 film Warcraft.

The truck could transport up to 3500 kilograms (7716 lbs) cross-country and up to 5000 kg (11023 lbs) on paved roads, it could also tow trailers of up to 4000 kg (8818 lbs). As a truck designed primarily with military service in mind, it can ford rivers and mud of between 120 and 180 centimetres of depth. It was initially equipped with a 6-cylinder S359 diesel engine (6842 cm³, 150 HP). The design works started in 1968. The following year the first prototypes were ready. Between 1970 and 1973 the vehicle was being prepared to enter serial production which it did in 1973. It remained in production until 2000, when it was replaced with Star 1466. It was being produced for 27 years. Usage One of the two Star 266 trucks used for the 1988 Dakar Rally in Nature and Technology Museum in Starachowice. Star 266 was first all adopted as a basic military tactical truck, but was also used as civilian truck, especially for services needing high mobility, like a mobile workshop for energetics. It also served as a basis for several civilian vehicles including fire engines and truck-mounted cranes. Fire Engines and Energetic Services still use this Truck because of its durability and ease of repairs in poor weather and terrain conditions. Two specially modified Star 266 trucks took part in the 1988 Dakar Rally. One crew included Tomasz Sikora and Jerzy Franek, second crew consisted of Jerzy Mazur and Julian Obornicki. Both trucks reached the finish line in Senegal but they went over the delay limit and as such they were disqualified.STAR & JELCZ w rajdzie DAKAR One of the trucks is currently in Muzeum Przyrody i Techniki (Nature and Technology Museum) in Starachowice, home town of the truck. Modernised Star 228M during Wroclaw flood of 2010 Star 266 is a basic medium-capacity transport vehicle of the Polish Armed Forces and as such is used for a number of different tasks. Polish Army also uses the modernized variant of Star 266 known as Star 266M. Star 266 also served as basis for a number of different vehicles including CD-5 tanker trucks which are used for transport of liquid fuel by supply platoons of tank and mechanized battalions, GD-2 smokescreen generation vehicles, truck-mounted cranes, excavators, WUS-3 and IRS special vehicles used for disinfection and chemical recon, deactivation and decontamination of vehicles, terrain, equipment and buildings, ADK-11 command vehicles as well as Star-266 AP-64 and Star-266 BP-64 special transport vehicles used for transporting the elements of the PP-64 Wstęga pontoon bridge.

Sinclair and written by Harold Medford and Owen Crump. The cast includes Arthur Kennedy, Mel Tormé, Lloyd Nolan, Craig Stevens and Peter Van Eyck. Resisting Enemy Interrogation was intended to train United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) crews to resist interrogation by the Germans. Resisting Enemy Interrogation received an Academy Award nomination in 1944 for best feature-length documentary. Resisting Enemy Interrogation Plot In 1944, German intelligence strives to find the target of an upcoming raid by the reputed \\"B-99 bomber\\". To achieve this end, they interrogate a recently shot-down aircrew from a B-99 reconnaissance mission that was shot down over Italy. The aircrew is sent to Dulag Luft POW camp. The German officers, commanded by Major von Behn (Carl Esmond) use various methods to discover this information, some of them quite subtle. While interviewing Lieutenant Frank L. Williams, Jr. (Don Porter) and Captain James Spencer (James Seay), the two airmen at first resist any probing for information. Other members of the crew include Sergeant Alfred Mason (Arthur Kennedy). Though no physical brutality is used, the Germans at one point stage a mock execution to scare a prisoner. Another prisoner is subjected to isolation to heighten his fear. Red Cross officers and a nurse (Poldi Dur) use their positions to extract information from the prisoners. Each airman eventually provides useful information because of their arrogance, fear or naivety. Some of what they say, which the enemy finds useful, seems innocuous but is used by the Germans as pieces to solve the larger puzzle. In the end, the Germans are able to determine the target of the raid and the B-99 bombing mission is intercepted. The intended target is spared heavy damage with 21 B-99s shot down and the loss of 105 aircrew. The U.S. intelligence officer (Lloyd Nolan), in his briefing to the surviving members of the raid, stresses not talking under any circumstances because of the danger of talking too much; even innocuous conversation can help the enemy. He also says not to let down one's guard, that everything in a prison camp is suspect, and not to try to outwit the enemy.

Aside from brief voice-over narration at the beginning and a speech by Lloyd Nolan at the end, the film is presented in dramatic form. According to screenwriter Owen Crump from the First Motion Picture Unit, the secluded Bavarian chateau that appears in the film at the beginning was a process shot based on a picture post card. After the war, Crump said two aviators visited Warner Bros. studios. During the war, they were taken to the same chateau for interrogation. Recognizing it from Resisting Enemy Interrogation, the two fliers were so amused that they kept breaking into laughter, completely baffling their captors.\\"Notes: 'Resisting Enemy Interrogation' (1944).\\" Turner Classic Movies.

Reception Resisting Enemy Interrogation was typical of the propaganda films of the period produced under the auspices of the Office of War Information.Koppes and Black 1987, p. 58. The film was distributed and exhibited by the USAAF primarily to air force personnel but was released as a theatrical feature in New York in August 1944. Remake In 1950, the film story of Resisting Enemy Interrogation was purchased from Harold Medford to be made into a Universal-International motion picture with a working title of \\"Prisoner of War.\\"\\"Hollywood Dossier.\\" The New York Times, April 30, 1950. The film, entitled Target Unknown, was released by Universal in 1951 with a screenplay by Medford. It was directed by George Sherman with a cast led by Mark Stevens. The climax of the film is changed to an escape of the prisoners. References Notes Bibliography * Koppes, Clayton R. and Gregory D. Black.

It is also known as the Haitian curlytail lizard and the green-legged curly-tail. The species is sexually dimorphic with the males being considerably larger with impressive red markings on the head around the lower jaw. Females are much smaller and are brown in colour with lighter stripes running down the flanks. The species is endemic to Hispaniola. Description In males, the snout–vent length is with a tail of . Adult males have a black face and throat, extending beyond the ear to the shoulder folds. Young males often have pale spots below and in front of the ears. The crown is brown. Older males often have a wide pale longitudinal stripe on the back as well as lateral stripes. The underparts are lightly spotted with black, including the chin, legs and rather paler tail. The female is rather smaller than the male with a snout-to-vent length of and is rather more drab in colouration, with four longitudinal pale stripes, much black barring between the stripes, and underparts heavily spotted with black. Distribution and habitat This lizard is endemic to Hispaniola in the Caribbean Sea. It is known from various locations in Haiti, Grosse Caye, and the Dominican Republic. It occurs at altitudes of up to about . It mainly inhabits damp locations, but is also present in shaded parts of dry shrublands, including broadleaf woodland, pine forests, plantations, coastal scrub, gardens, arable land and pasture. It also occurs in urban areas, city parks and town gardens. This lizard was first recorded in Florida in 1994, where it was described as a newly arrived exotic species \\"likely to colonize natural areas\\". It is restricted to several localities in Dade County. Ecology This lizard lives on the ground and is diurnal. It feeds mainly on insects and other small arthropods, but also eats some plant material. It is probably preyed on by the small Javan mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) which has been introduced to the island. A study of anti-predator behaviour among these lizards showed that those that lived in more open, exposed locations, tended to display such traits as longer limbs and faster sprint speeds. Status Leiocephalus personatus is endemic to Hispaniola but within its limited range it is a common species and no particular threats have been identified. The population appears to be stable and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

Concept Publishing Company, 1 Jan 1992 This approach to farming and living share some common traits with Masanobu Fukuoka \\"natural farming\\" and permaculture. He was a recipient of the 1985 Jamnalal Bajaj Award. Biography Shripad A. Dabholkar was an educationist. He aimed to shape education as a tool for total change in the life situation of an average worker in rural areas. Dabholkar realized the limitation of conventional academic system in which he played a part as a teacher for 25 years. He left it to undertake the task of educating farmers through demystification of science, adopting non-formal methods of knowledge communication. Dabholkar was a lone campaigner but succeeded in creating mass awareness and interest in farmers, who formed their own groups even in his absence. His network building resulted in a new sociology of science and education. He started his work in Tasgaon, a village in Sangli district in Maharashtra, among the grape cultivators. Soon the productivity in the district rose to world standards and grape production became a highly productive activity, inducing small farmers to turn to it. Dabholkar then successfully extended the applied research to other crops as well. Prayog Pariwar methodology Prayog Pariwar methodology is about networking of self- experiment ventures for nature friendly and human friendly prosperity. The central thesis is that without depending on foreign aid or imported technology, economic development can be achieved by experimenting farmers and by common individuals in their own neighborhoods. It evolved out from an initiative by S.A. Dabholkar in Maharashtra, India, in the mid-1960s. By then the network was called Swashraya Vikas Mandal, meaning self-help and self- reliance for building new possibilities by working in one's own real-life situation. These groups also pioneered collaborative networking practices and an Internet-type information exchange using postcards. Dabholkar described the Prayog Pariwar methodology in the book Plenty for all (Mehta Publishing House, 1998) where he defines and establishes a non structured approach for development in the neighborhood through: * grassroot networking * demystification of latest science, knowledge and new thoughts to generate and propagate * people's own techno-scientific ventures * full-fledged eco-motive rurban development all over the world. It has proven successful. In one case in Maharashtra, farmers without formal agricultural education became India's leading grape cultivators with a turnover of over $122 million.

The special, based on Camille Saint-Saëns' musical suite of the same name and consisting of entirely new animation, was purposely cast in the successful mold of Jones' own earlier musical cartoons (including Rabbit of Seville, Long-Haired Hare and Baton Bunny), and is set the familiar showbiz rivalry between Bugs and Daffy against the orchestral backdrop of conductor Michael Tilson Thomas, in a performance based on Saint-Saëns' music and Ogden Nash's poetry. Carnival of the Animals originally aired on CBS on November 22, 1976, and was the first Warner Bros.-commissioned work featuring Bugs Bunny following the release of the cartoon False Hare, as well as their first Looney Tunes production following the second closure of their original animation studio in 1969. This is an abridged version of the work, omitting the \\"Tortoise\\", \\"Characters with Long Ears\\", \\"Cuckoo\\" and \\"Swan\\" movements and using the \\"Pianists\\" music over the ending credits.  Production   Behind the scenes  Prime-time television would seem to be the natural place for the adult humor of Warner's classic cartoons, as was exemplified by the success of The Bugs Bunny Show that aired Tuesday evenings on ABC in the early 1960s. However, in the mid-1960s, the Warner Bros. cartoons had become established as kiddie entertainment. By 1968, executives at CBS were convinced that all animated material, no matter what its original intended audience had been, belonged exclusively on Saturday mornings. However, the popular characters of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies intentionally had enduring adult appeal from the first, and with the success of other prime-time television specials such as the various Peanuts specials that were being produced at the time, network programmers were finally convinced to give the Warner Bros. animated characters another chance in prime time. According to animation historians Kevin McCorry and Jon Cooke: > Cartoon characters, appearing in holiday-related, half-hour features, could > be relied upon to garner respectable ratings and advertising revenue. > Further, with the reduction of regular series episodes per season to below > 26, specials were needed to fill the gaps in the 52 weeks that constituted a > television season. This special marked the first time since Warner Bros. had closed their studios in 1964 that Bugs Bunny had appeared on-screen with new material. (Bugs, unlike most of the other regular Looney Tunes characters, had not appeared in any of the outsourced productions distributed under the Warner Bros. banner from 1964 to 1969.)

Voters were allowed to vote as many times as they wanted. Although anyone was able to participate in online voting, those who had purchased the books themselves were able to increase their voting power by inputting special codes that appeared on their copies. These practices were not continued in Pilot Season 2008. The protagonists in both of 2007's winning comics, Cyblade and Velocity, were characters spun off from Marc Silvestri's popular Cyberforce comic series. Both Cyblade and Velocity were slated for release as series in fall 2008. While Cyblade was released on schedule, Velocity suffered a series of delays. Joshua Hale Fialkov and Rick Mays continued writing duties and art for Cyblade, and released a four issue miniseries. Initially, Joe Casey resumed writing for Velocity, but ChrisCross took over from Kevin MacGuire on art. In December 2008, ChrisCross announced his resignation from the Velocity project due to \\"unforeseen differences\\". The series was officially cancelled in February 2009 without a single issue released.http://previewsworld.com/support/previews_docs/orderforms/FEB09_Cancel.txt In an interview, writer Joe Casey indicated that he had written three issues, and ChrisCross had pencilled one, before \\"that famous Top Cow brand of common sense disappeared into an unexpectedly bizarre rift in time and space.\\" He cited mass company dismissals of staff, including that of \\"our beloved editor\\", as contributing factors to the demise of the series. Following their departures from the title, Joe Casey and ChrisCross teamed up to create the DC Comics miniseries Final Crisis Aftermath: Dance. In June 2010, Top Cow relaunched Velocity. Despite the new series being released under the Pilot Season banner, the creative team behind Velocity's 2007 win were not involved in this new incarnation. Instead, Ron Marz assumed writing duties, while Kenneth Rocafort was responsible for art. In a press release, Marz is quoted as saying \\"We're going to pay off Velocity's Pilot Season win with a story that's got her literally running for her life, and the lives of her teammates.\\" 2008 The entrants for the 2008 season were (winners in bold):Pilot Season 2008 Winners: Genius, Twilight Guardian, Newsarama, September 18, 2008 *Twilight Guardian #1Pilot Season: Twilight Guardian #1 - The FULL Issue, Newsarama, August 29, 2008 (W) Troy HickmanHickman talks \\"Pilot Season: Twilight Guardian\\", Comic Book Resources, May 28, 2008Shedding Light on the Twilight Guardian with Troy Hickman, Newsarama, May 15, 2008 (A) Reza (Cov) Hendry Prasetyo *Genius #1Pilot Season: Genius #1 - The FULL Issue, Newsarama, August 27, 2008 (W) Marc Bernardin & Adam FreemanBernardin & Freeman talk Top Cow's Genius, Comic Book Resources, October 27, 2008 (A) Afua Richardson (Cov) Afua RichardsonBernardin & Freeman - Creating Top Cow's \\"Genius\\", Newsarama, June 23, 2008 **Lady Pendragon #1Pilot Season: Lady Pendragon #1 - The FULL Issue, Newsarama, September 1, 2008 (W) Matt HawkinsKnights of the Red Planet: Hawkins talks \\"Lady Pendragon”, Comic Book Resources, June 2, 2008 (A) Eru (Cov) Drew Struzan **Alibi #1Pilot Season: Alibi #1 - The FULL Issue, Newsarama, August 28, 2008 (W) Joshua Hale FialkovAlibi Checks Out: Fialkov talks “Pilot Season: Alibi”, Comic Book Resources, June 25, 2008 (A) Jeremy Haun (Cov) Jeremy HaunExclusive Preview: Pilot Season: Alibi, June 21, 2008 **The Core #1Pilot Season: Core #1 - The FULL Issue, Newsarama, August 25, 2008 (W) Jonathan Hickman (A) Kenneth Rocafort (Cov) Kenneth Rocafort **Urban Myths #1Pilot Season: Urban Myths #1 - The FULL Issue, Newsarama, August 26, 2008 (W) Jay FaerberGreek to Me: Faerber on “Pilot Season: Urban Myths”, Comic Book Resources, July 9, 2008 (A) Jorge Molina (Cov) Jorge Molina The 2008 season included 4 new original properties. Only 2 of the comic books, Twilight Guardian and Lady Pendragon, had a history of publication prior to participation in Pilot Season. This was a markedly different situation from the 2007 event, in which all five of the Pilot Season issues (along with the cancelled Aphrodite IX pilot issue) had been based upon pre-existing Top Cow characters. The voting period ran from August 4 through to September 8, 2008. In a departure from the previous year's competition (which allowed people to vote as often as they liked), individual computers were only able to vote once per day. The final distribution of votes has been detailed as follows: *Twilight Guardian: 29% *Genius: 24% *Urban Myths: 22% *The Core: 15% *Lady Pendragon: 7% *Alibi: 3% Twilight Guardian's first issue post Pilot Season was released in January 2011. Genius' first issue post Pilot Season was released on August 6, 2014. According to Mel Caylo, Top Cow Vice President of Marketing & Sales, some entrants that did not win the 2008 competition may still have a future at the company. \\"While we have two, very clear winners in Twilight Guardian and Genius, voting for the other books was so fierce that it doesn't preclude us from ever doing something else with those properties down the road.\\" 2009 The entrants for the 2009 season were: *Murderer #1 (W) Robert Kirkman (A) Nelson Blake II (Cov) Marc Silvestri *Demonic #1 (W) Robert Kirkman (A) Joe Benitez (Cov) Marc Silvestri *Stealth #1 (W) Robert Kirkman (A) Sheldon Mitchell (Cov) Marc Silvestri *Stellar #1 (W) Robert Kirkman (A) Bernard Chang (Cov) Marc Silvestri *Hardcore #1 (W) Robert Kirkman (A) Brian Stelfreeze (Cov) Marc Silvestri Top Cow relaunched Pilot Season with major differences. In previous years, Pilot Season had been a competition between titles developed by a diverse roster of creative teams. All five Pilot Season titles released were written by Robert Kirkman, with covers by Marc Silvestri. The first published issue, \\"Murderer\\", was released in December 2009. The rest were released over the course of 2010 with the exception of the final issue, Hardcore, which was due in 2010, but was finally released on May 2012.

He was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain and general secretary of the Young Communist League. Biography Ashton was born in Oldham, and moved to Portrush, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, where he grew up. He studied at the former Northern Ireland Hotel and Catering College in Portrush, before moving to London in 1978. Richard Coles wrote about this period: \\"Mark also worked for a while as a barman at the Conservative Club in King’s Cross, or, rather, as a barmaid, in drag, with a blonde beehive wig. I was never sure if the patrons worked out that he was really a man\\". In 1982 he spent three months in Bangladesh visiting his parents, where his father was working for the textile machinery industry. The experience of his sojourn had a profound effect on him. Upon his return, he volunteered with the London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard, supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and joined the Young Communist League. In 1983 he featured in the Lesbian and Gay Youth Video Project film Framed Youth: The Revenge of the Teenage Perverts, an early documentary that won the Grierson Award 1984 for Best Documentary. He formed, with his friend Mike Jackson, the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners (LGSM) support group after the two men collected donations for the miners on strike at the 1984 Lesbian and Gay Pride march in London. After LGSM, he became involved in the Red Wedge collective and became the General Secretary of the Young Communist League from 1985 to 1986. Diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, Ashton was admitted to Guy's Hospital on 30 January 1987 and died 12 days later of Pneumocystis pneumonia. His death prompted a significant response from the gay community, particularly in publication and attendance at his funeral at Lambeth Cemetery. Legacy In his memory, the Mark Ashton Trust was created to raise money for individuals living with HIV, and it had raised £20,000. Since 2008, the Terrence Higgins Trust has included the Mark Ashton Red Ribbon Fund, which had collected more than £38,000 . Mark Ashton is also remembered on a panel on the UK AIDS Memorial Quilt and has been memorialised in May 2014 on a plaque at the entrance to the London headquarters of the Terrence Higgins Trust. In 2017, on the anniversary of what would have been Ashton's 57th birthday, a blue plaque was unveiled in his honour above the Gay's The Word bookshop in Marchmont Street, London, the site where LGSM met and held meetings during the miners' strike. The ballad \\"For a Friend\\" in the album Red from the British pop duo The Communards was written in his memory. Mark Hooper of The Rough Guide to Rock writes that this cut may be Somerville's \\"most impassioned moment\\". Ashton was a friend of both Jimmy Somerville and Richard Coles. For a Friend reached number 28 on the British charts. The Constantine Giannaris film Jean Genet Is Dead (1989) is dedicated to his memory. The LGSM's activities were dramatised in Pride, a film released in September 2014 featuring Ben Schnetzer as Ashton. Ashton's role in the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners group was recalled in a series of interviews with some of its other members prior to the film's release. However, Ashton's membership in the Young Communist League was not explicitly mentioned in the film, possibly to avoid alienating American audiences. Schnetzer, an American actor, was nominated for two British Independent Film Awards for his performance. On 25 September 2018, the Council of Paris awarded the garden adjoining the Hôtel d'Angoulême Lamoignon the new name of (Hôtel-Lamoignon - Mark Ashton Garden), in his memory.

The bill received the assent of the President of India and was brought into effect by notification issued on 12 April 2006. The law The People's Union for Democratic Rights pointed out that although this act was ostensibly meant to combat growing Maoist violence, all the Maoist groups operating in Chhattisgarh were already banned and declared unlawful organisations after the 2004 amendment to the Unlawful Activities - Act, 1967 It authorises the police to detain a person for committing acts, which among other things, show a \\"tendency to pose an obstacle to the administration of law\\". The act also states any person whose actions \\"encourage(s) the disobedience of the established law\\" will be considered \\"unlawful\\". Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, in a statement, said that the present definition of \\"unlawful activities\\" imperils free exercise of fundamental freedoms set out under Article 19 of the Constitution and illustratively it appears to restrict the right to hold public meetings; organise public protests; and oppose government policies through the media. Arrests Six organisations were banned under this act. Dr. Binayak Sen, General Secretary, Chhattisgarh People's Union for Civil Liberties was detained under this Act on 14 May 2007 allegedly for his linkages with the Communist Party of India (Maoist). Criticism Human rights activists says this legislation will lead to increased repression of human rights. The People's Union for Democratic Rights said that this legislation is meant to suppress all political dissent in the state. This is evident from the fact that Maoist groups were already banned under 2004 amendments to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. The Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative has expressed its reservations about the Act, and said it may become a potential instrument to throttle the right to free speech, legitimate dissent, and trample the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. Concerns on press freedom The act bars the media from carrying reports of any kind of ‘unlawful activities’ in the state. International Federation of Journalists appealed to the President of India, not to give his assent to \\"this undemocratic legislation, and initiate public debate on the complex causes of conflict, rather than treat it as a law and order problem.\\" President Christopher Warren, in a statement, said, \\"Freedom of the press is a pre-requisite for the peaceful resolution of conflict, and restricting the media from carrying out its professional activities can only lead to more suspicion and misinformation. Under no circumstances has gagging the media and silencing journalists furthered the objective of tackling armed conflict. It is only when democratic debate and the free flow of accurate information is made possible is the cause of democracy furthered.\\"Santosh yadav, a bastar based journalist was arrested based on this law in 2015.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWjPJE8oMU&t;=11s References External links * Unofficial English Translation of the Act * PUDR Analysis on the act * Chhattisgarh’s novel way to counter Naxals: Gun for journalists * Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative statement *Chhattisgarh security act challenged in Supreme Court Category:Chhattisgarh state legislation Category:2005 in law Category:Naxalite–Maoist insurgency Category:Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly ","title":"Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act"},{"id":"17702691","text":"Russell Barry Frank Russell Barry (called Russell)Telegraph Obituary – John Bowden was an Anglican Bishop and authorAmongst others he wrote “One Clear Call”, 1922; ”The Relevance of Christianity”, 1931; “The Relevance of the Church”, 1935; “Faith in Dark Ages”, 1940; “Mervyn Haigh”, 1964;and “ Period of My Life” 1974 British Library Catalogue accessed 15:20 May 31st 2008 who served as Bishop of Southwell for over 20 years in the middle of the 20th centuryThe Times, Monday, 8 Dec 1941; pg. 6; Issue 49103; col D Ecclesiastical News Bishop Of Southwell Nominated Born on 28 January 1890 he was educated at Bradfield and Oriel College, Oxford and ordained in 1914.Who was Who 1987-1990: London, A & C Black, 1991 ) From 1915 to 1919, he was a Chaplain with the BEF during which time he was Mentioned in Despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order.

It lies along U.S. Route 15 below the James River, northeast of the county seat of Buckingham.Rand McNally. The Road Atlas '08. Chicago: Rand McNally, 2008, p. 105-106. Although it is unincorporated, it has a post office, with the ZIP code of 23123.  History  In November, 1793, the Virginia General Assembly decreed that a town to be named \\"New Canton\\" was to be established in Buckingham County on the James River, near the mouth of Bear Garden Creek. The twenty five acres of land were located on the bluff above Cannon's Ferry, which had been in operation for many years. This land was to be laid out into lots of one half acre each, with \\"convenient cross streets running throughout\\". The main street and one angled cross street were the existing roads that served the ferry. The land was part of an original colonial land grant made to William Cannon on March 1, 1743. The land for the town was donated by Cannon's grandson, also named William, who hoped that the town would grow and prosper, causing his surrounding property to increase in value. The original 45 lots were to be sold at public auction. Each purchaser was given seven years to build a \\"habitable dwelling house\\" on the lot. The dwelling was to be at least sixteen feet square and have either a brick or stone chimney. In addition, a tobacco warehouse was to be constructed and named \\"Cannon's Warehouse\\". Initial sales were slow and nine years later, in 1802, the General Assembly adopted legislation to provide an additional five years for purchasers to build on their lots. The tobacco warehouse had been constructed by January, 1804, on the only one acre lot in town. This warehouse later became known as the \\"Public\\" or \\"Publik\\" Warehouse and existed well into the 19th century. In its early years, New Canton was known as a rowdy place, with as many as three saloons in a town of less than 40 houses. Iron and gold mines were in operation all around New Canton from the mid-18th until the mid-19th century. The remains of the iron foundry and several mines still exist today. The only church ever built in New Canton was Trinity Presbyterian which was constructed in 1840. It still exists in the original building as a functioning church. A private one room Catholic chapel was constructed by local merchant John Thomas McKenna in the mid-1880s. It later served as the New Canton post office until the mid-1960s and it also still exists to this day. In 1840, the James River and Kanawha Canal was constructed adjacent to the north bank of the river (opposite New Canton) and opened to traffic. The canal was used by packet and freight boats which replaced the earlier shallow- draft batteau boats used before the canal for commerce. These boats brought goods and passengers to and from Richmond and points beyond. A bridge was built to connect the canal to the New Canton side. Long a dream of early Virginians such as George Washington, who was a surveyor early in his career, the canal was never completed as envisioned. However, the canal in the area of New Canton was used until both it and the bridge were destroyed by Union forces during the American Civil War (1861–1865). The canal was repaired after the war, but traffic never returned to pre-war levels as railroads were becoming more numerous and popular. After many years of attempts to compete successfully with the ever-expanding network of railroads, the James River and Kanawha Canal was conveyed to a new railroad company by a deed dated March 4, 1880. Railroad construction workers promptly started laying tracks on the towpath. The new Richmond and Allegheny Railroad offered a water-level route from the Appalachian Mountains just east of West Virginia near Jackson's River Station (now Clifton Forge) through the Blue Ridge Mountains at Balcony Falls to Richmond. In 1888 the railroad was leased, and later purchased, by Collis P. Huntington's Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. In the mid-1880s major change came to New Canton when a railroad bridge was constructed over the James River, connecting the Bremo Bluff side to the New Canton side. A new road was constructed a few hundred feet to the west of the old ferry road to service the new bridge. Planks were laid on the bridge which allowed wagon and foot traffic as well as rail traffic. The locals named the bridge the \\"Combination Bridge\\" because of this. The old ferry and its connecting road fell into disuse and were gradually abandoned. New Canton never became a \\"boom town\\" but it did have considerable commerce and enterprise in the 19th and early 20th centuries. There was a tan yard, a grist mill, a tobacco warehouse, a saw mill, several bars, a hotel, several general stores and a post office. In the early 20th century, there were gas pumps, a Ford automobile dealership and an orchard as well. As motorcars became popular early in the 20th century, they too began using the bridge and the road down to the river became a highway for the ever-increasing motor vehicle traffic. The main highway that was to become U.S. Route 15 actually ran right through New Canton. This brought a boom in commerce to New Canton but it was to be short lived. In 1934, a new highway bridge opened a few hundred feet to the west of the town, effectively a bypass isolating New Canton from through traffic. Commerce gradually wound down in the latter half of the 20th century. The village now has no commercial establishments and there are less than 10 occupied houses on the original 45 lots. The most active part of town is the post office which has remained in continuous operation, in several different buildings, since the early 19th century. This post office serves a wide area around the village itself. Carter G. Woodson (1875–1950) was an African-American who was born and raised in the New Canton area of Buckingham County. He became a noted teacher, educator, and historian. He is best known for establishing Black History Week, which has evolved into Black History Month. Dr. Woodson is known as the Father of Black History.

The Ward population taken at the 2011 census was 7,256. It is surrounded on the west and south by the Anker, and comprises the church, Rectory, Church Farm, the Grove, and the grounds of the former Weddington Castle. A branch road leading south from Watling Street passes through the village. History Weddington Castle was probably built on the site of the capital mansion-house mentioned in a suit of 1566. It may have been built by Thomas, Marquess of Dorset, who enclosed the whole manor of Weddington in 1491, converting all the land to pasture, whereby went out of cultivation, 10 houses were allowed to go to ruin, and 60 persons were driven from their homes, losing their occupation. After the forfeiture of Thomas's son, the Duke of Suffolk, the manor was leased by the Crown until 1561 and one of the lessees, Mr. Trye, rebuilt the village and 'made habitations mete for husbandry'. In 1730 Thomas notes that there were four farmhouses and the Manor House in the parish, and even in 1901 the population was only just over 100. Since that time, with the development of Nuneaton, many small houses have been built. Weddington is now included in the parish and borough of Nuneaton under the Borough of Nuneaton (Extension) Order 1931, which came into operation on 1 April 1931. The woodland in Weddington was 2 furlongs in length and 1 furlong broad in 1086, and in 1849 there were of woodland, but by 1886 there was none outside the grounds of the Castle. Richard Vines, a Puritan Divine and Ancient Greek scholar, was presented to the living of Weddington in 1627 and to Caldecote in 1630, holding both for a time. He was one of the orthodox divines presented for Warwickshire to be consulted about the reformed liturgy. He had gifts as a preacher, and a sermon preached before the House of Commons in 1642 made a great impression. With other Puritans he took refuge at Coventry in 1643. In the following year he was made Master of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, where he did good work, showing himself a good administrator and promoter of learning. He married Katherine, daughter of Humphrey Adderley of Weddington. Transport and facilities Weddington is now a suburb of Nuneaton with a local primary school, Weddington Primary School, and secondary school, Higham Lane School. The A444 runs through the parish where it is called Weddington Road; further out of Nuneaton, it is Weddington Lane. There is a stretch of greenbelt bordering Weddington which is called Sandon Fields, known locally as Weddington or Weddy Meadows. The field has a sports pavilion, football pitches and the Cleaver Gardens flats. There is a second field, which is a narrow strip with a children's park, running south of Weddington to St. Nicolas Park; this is called Coronation Walk and known locally as Brookie Fields. Weddington in generally considered as the most prosperous area of Nuneaton.

Design and development In July 1972 a Sydney boat builder named Ronald Gilbert Wheeler made the first flight of a minimum aircraft which he'd designed and built himself, and which he put into series production soon thereafter. At the time Ron was building catamarans in Sydney's southern suburbs. Having already developed 'Tweetie', a successful hang glider, Wheeler simply modified the design of the glider to have the pilot seated instead of hanging below the wings, and of course to accommodate an engine. Marketed as the Skycraft Scout, this was the world's first commercially produced ultra light – rigid wing rather than a Rogallo – and spawned a new Australian industry. Ron had no experience in aircraft design and claims to have started the project on a whim in his spare time. Using sources referenced from the library at Sydney Technical College and Hurstville local Library he built up a working knowledge of aerodynamics. In his 1975 patent application (number 494013) Wheeler claims to have \\"improve[ed]the flight characteristics of the rogallo wing by so cutting and sewing the fabric as to shape the wing to form an aerofoil section having an increasing angle of attack from the root to the tip of the wing as well as increasing the area of the wing at the outer span region relative to that of a conventional rogallo configuration.\\" The Scout was a factory-built minimum aircraft that utilised yacht fittings from his local marine shop. The early Scout was an extremely basic machine, which utilised Dacron sailcloth for the wing covering, lanyards and battens and an aluminium yacht mast as the wing spar. It was initially powered by a modified Victa lawnmower engine and, unlike a conventional aeroplane, had only rudder and elevator controls. Nevertheless, on a good day, it usually flew. Significantly, the Scout was the first ultralight aircraft to be covered by airworthiness regulations in the world, in this case-Australia's Air Navigation Order(ANO)95.10 issued by the Department of Transport. In 1975 Ron Wheeler approached The Department of Transport to issue an Air Navigation Order regulation for ultralight and minimum aircraft. Subsequently, the Department issued ANO 95.10 for unlicensed pilots to fly aircraft weighing less than 180 kilograms under a number of restrictive conditions, including altitude restrictions, and not to fly over sealed roads. This allowed the ultralight aircraft industry to take-off, and Wheeler went into full-time production of the Scout as a leisure craft.

The House of Commons represents around 65 million people in 650 UK constituencies. The House of Lords remains unelected but can be overruled. United Kingdom constitutional law concerns the governance of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. With the oldest continuous political system on Earth, the UK constitution is not contained in a single code but principles have emerged over the centuries from statute, case law, political conventions and social consensus. In 1215, Magna Carta required the King to call \\"common counsel\\" or Parliament, hold courts in a fixed place, guarantee fair trials, guarantee free movement of people, and free the church from the state; it also enshrined the rights of \\"common\\" people to use the land.Magna Carta 1215 clauses 1 ('... the English church shall be free...'), 12 and 14 (no tax 'unless by common counsel of our kingdom...'), 17 ('Common pleas shall... be held in some fixed place'), 39-40 ('To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice'), 41 ('merchants shall have safe and secure exit from England, and entry to England') and 47-48 (land taken by the King 'shall forthwith be disafforested'). After the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution 1688, Parliament won supremacy over the monarch, as well as the church and the courts, and the Bill of Rights 1689 recorded that the \\"election of members of Parliament ought to be free\\". The Act of Union 1707 unified England, Wales and Scotland, while Ireland was joined in 1800, but the Republic of Ireland formally separated between 1916 and 1921 through bitter armed conflict. By the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928, almost every adult man and woman was finally entitled to vote for Parliament. The UK was a founding member of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations, the Commonwealth, the Council of Europe, the European Union, and the World Trade Organization (WTO).The ILO was formed as part of the (now defunct) League of Nations in the Versailles Treaty 1919 Part XIII. The UN was formed in 1945. The Commonwealth of Nations was formally established by the London Declaration of 1949. The Council of Europe was created in 1950. The European Union was formed by the Maastricht Treaty 1992, succeeding the European Community which the UK joined by the European Communities Act 1972. The WTO was created in 1994. The principles of parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, democracy and internationalism guide the UK's modern political system. The central institutions of modern government are Parliament, the judiciary, the executive, the civil service and public bodies which implement policies, and regional and local governments. Parliament is composed of the House of Commons, elected by voter constituencies, and the House of Lords which is mostly appointed on the recommendation of cross-political party groups. To make a new Act of Parliament, the highest form of law, both Houses must read, amend, or approve proposed legislation three times. The judiciary is headed by a twelve-member UK Supreme Court, and underneath are the Court of Appeal for England and Wales and the Court of Session for Scotland, and a system of high courts, Crown courts, or tribunals depending on the subject in the case. Courts interpret statutes, progress the common law and principles of equity, and can control the discretion of the executive. UK courts are usually thought to have no power to declare an Act of Parliament unconstitutional. The executive is headed by the Prime Minister, who must command a majority in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister appoints a cabinet of people who lead each department, and form Her Majesty's Government. The Queen herself is a ceremonial figurehead, who gives royal assent to new laws. By constitutional convention, the monarch does not usurp the democratic process and has not refused royal assent since the Scottish Militia Bill in 1708. Beyond the Parliament and cabinet, a civil service and a large number of public bodies, from the Department of Education to the National Health Service, deliver public services that implement the law and fulfil political, economic and social rights. In practice, most constitutional litigation occurs through administrative law disputes, concerning the operation of public bodies, and human rights. The courts have an inherent power of judicial review, to ensure that every institution under law acts according to law. Except for Parliament itself, courts may declare acts of any institution or public figure void, to ensure that discretion is only used reasonably or proportionately. Since it joined the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950, and particularly after the Human Rights Act 1998, courts are required to review whether legislation is compatible with international human rights norms. These protect everyone's rights against government or corporate power, including liberty against arbitrary arrest and detention, the right to privacy against unlawful surveillance, the right to freedom of expression, freedom of association including joining trade unions and taking strike action, and the freedom of assembly and protest. Every public body and private bodies that affect people's rights and freedoms are accountable under the law. History Roman Britain from 43 to 410 AD was governed under the Roman Constitution, subject to the Emperor. The history of the UK constitution, though officially beginning in 1800, traces back to a time long before the four nations of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland were fully formed.See AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) ch 2, 32–48, on historic structure, and devolution. Before the Roman Empire’s conquest, Britain and Ireland were populated by Celtic migrants from the European continent, but ones who left no recorded history of law.See F Pollock and FW Maitland, The history of English law before the time of Edward I (1899) Book I, ch I, 1, ‘Such is the unity of all history that anyone who endeavours to tell a piece of it must feel that his first sentence tears a seamless web.’ Near the end of the Roman Republic in 55 and 54 BC, the former Consul and legion commander Julius Caesar invaded Britain during the broader Gallic Wars. This did not establish permanent occupation, as Caesar returned to Rome, became dictator and was assassinated. The Republic was transformed into an Empire, when Caesar’s heir Augustus took power in 27 BC. In the reign of Augustus’ grandson, Claudius, Britain was conquered from 43 AD. Under Rome's uncodified constitution, Roman Britain was administered by a governor, usually member of the Senate but appointed by the Emperor for their military record. Londinium was a provincial capital of 60,000 people, and Britain a cosmopolitan society of around 3 million people. Roman law was based upon a slave economy, and highly militarised. Hadrian constructed a wall from 122 as part of the Empire's limits, but this was soon moved north by Antoninus Pius from 142. Constantine the Great was stationed in York in 306 when he left to claim his title to be Emperor. Constantine marched on Rome under the cross in 312, and issued an Edict of Milan in 313. This triggered a series of events where the Church assumed more and more power over the law.Pollock and Maitland (1899) 4–5 But under constant assault, the Empire began to collapse and Britain was abandoned in 407.cf E Gibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1789) arguing Christianity led to weakness that caused Rome’s fall. Neither the Theodosian Code issued in 438, nor the great Corpus Juris Civilis of Justinian I in 534 entered the laws of Britain.Pollock and Maitland (1899) 5-6 In the Dark Ages, during power struggles between Anglo- Saxons, Britons, Danes and Vikings, kings convened regular councils, called the Witan, composed of lords and church leaders.FW Maitland, The constitutional history of England (1909) 6 But it was not until the Norman Invasion of 1066 that one common law was established through England under one monarch. John Ball, a leader of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 following repression after the Black Death, preached that \\"matters goeth not well to pass in England, nor shall not do till everything be common, and that there be no villains nor gentlemen, but that we may be all together, and that the lords be no greater masters than we be.\\"J Froissart, Froissart's Chronicles (1385) translated by GC Macaulay (1895) 251–252. Under William the Conqueror, advised by a King’s Council (Curia Regis), the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086 cataloguing all land and labour to levy taxes. Just 12 per cent of people were free, while the feudal system made others serfs, slaves or bordars and cottars.DD McGarry, Medieval History and Civilization (1976) 242, 12% free, 30% serfs, 35% bordars and cottars, 9% slaves. In 1190 Richard the Lionheart, more closely tied with the Pope in Rome, joined the Third Crusade to invade the Holy land, but at great cost. Taxes levied by Richard I,T Purser, Medieval England, 1042–1228 (2004) 161, this included a 25% tax on income and property, all the year's wool, and all churches gold and silver, to pay a ransom after Richard I was captured when returning from the crusades by Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor. and his successor King John to pay for the wars led to intense discontent, and the aristocracy forcing the King to sign the Magna Carta 1215. This was a commitment to hold ‘common counsel’ before any taxation, hold courts at a fixed place, hold trials according to law or before an accused’s peers, guarantee free movement of people for trade, and give back common land.Magna Carta 1215 clauses 12 (Parliament), 17 (court), 39 (fair trial), 41 (free movement), 47 (common land). Failure to abide by Magna Carta led to the First Barons' war, and the popular legend of Robin Hood emerged: a returned crusader who robbed from the rich to give to the poor.See W Langland, Piers Plowman (1370) Passus 5, 3278, \\"But I kan rymes of Robyn Hood\\" is the first mention of the tales, notably in the run up to the Peasants' revolt of 1381. As ballads and poems evolved, see John Stow, Annales of England (1592) The commitments on common land were soon recast in the Charter of the Forest 1217, signed at St Paul's by Henry III.Charter of the Forest 1217. This allowed, for example, in clause 9, ‘Every freeman shall at his own pleasure provide agistment' or grazing rights, and in clause 12, ‘Henceforth every freeman, in his wood or on his land that he has in the forest, may with impunity make a mill, fish-preserve, pond, marl-pit, ditch, or arable in cultivated land outside coverts, provided that no injury is thereby given to any neighbour.’ These documents established that the monarch, even with apparent authority from God, was bound by law, and it remains ‘the nearest approach to an irrepealable “fundamental statute” that England has ever had.’Pollock and Maitland (1899) Book I, 173 Throughout the Middle Ages, common land was a source of welfare for common people, peasant labourers bound by a feudal system of control. In 1348, the Black Death struck England, and killed around a third of the population. As peasants lost their lords, and there was a shortage of workers, wages rose. The King and Parliament responded with the Statute of Labourers 1351 to freeze wage rises. This led to the Peasants’ Revolt of 1381, where leaders demanded an end to feudalism, and for everything to be held in common.J Froissart, The Chronicles of Froissart (1385) translated by GC Macaulay (1895) 250–52, \\"What have we deserved, or why should we be kept thus in servage? We be all come from one father and one mother, Adam and Eve: whereby can they say or shew that they be greater lords than we be, saving by that they cause us to win and labour for that they dispend? They are clothed in velvet and camlet furred with grise, and we be vestured with poor cloth: they have their wines, spices and good bread, and we have the drawing out of the chaff and drink water: they dwell in fair houses, and we have the pain and travail, rain and wind in the fields; and by that that cometh of our labours they keep and maintain their estates: we be called their bondmen, and without we do readily them service, we be beaten; and we have no sovereign to whom we may complain, nor that will hear us nor do us right.\\" Despite the revolt’s violent repression, slavery and serfdom broke down,EP Cheyney, ‘The Disappearance of English Serfdom’ (1900) 15(57) English Historical Review 20 and A Fitzherbert, Surueyenge (1546) 31, servitude was ‘the greatest inconvenience that nowe is suffred by the lawe. That is to have any christen man bounden to an other, and to have the rule of his body, landes, and goodes, that his wyfe, children, and servantes have laboured for, all their life tyme, to be so taken, lyke as it were extorcion or bribery’. yet most people remained without any substantial liberty, in political or economic rights. As sheep farming became more profitable than agricultural work, enclosures of common land dispossessed more people, who turned into paupers and were punished.See Inclosure Acts and Vagrancy Act 1547. cf T More, Utopia (1516) Book I, \\"wherever it is found that the sheep of any soil yield a softer and richer wool than ordinary, there the nobility and gentry, and even those holy men, the abbots not contented with the old rents which their farms yielded... stop the course of agriculture, destroying houses and towns, reserving only the churches, and enclose grounds that they may lodge their sheep in them... Stop the rich from cornering markets and establishing virtual monopolies. Reduce the number of people who are kept doing nothing. Revive agriculture and the wool industry, so that there is plenty of honest, useful work for the great army of unemployed – by which I mean not only existing thieves, but tramps and idle servants who are bound to become thieves eventually.\\" Under Henry VIII, to seal a divorce from Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn (who he soon beheaded for supposed infidelity), the Church of England was declared separate from Rome in the Act of Supremacy 1534, with the King as the head. The Law in Wales Act 1535 united Wales and England in one administrative system, while the King became ever more despotic, executing the Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas More in 1535, and dissolving the monasteries and murdering those who resisted. After Henry VIII died, and power struggles following the death of his boy Edward VI at age 15,On his behalf Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset ruled as Lord Protector until he was replaced and executed by John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland. Somerset House was transferred to the crown, and Elizabeth was allowed to live there by Mary, Queen of Scots as she killed Lady Jane Grey (1554) and ruled until 1558. Mary then died without children, after killing hundreds of protestants. Elizabeth I, the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, took the throne in 1558. Half a century of prosperity followed as Elizabeth I avoided wars, but founded corporations including the East India Company to monopolise trade routes. Under her successor, James I, further companies were created to colonise North America, including the London Company and the Virginia Company in 1606, and the Massachusetts Bay Company in 1628. Many religious dissidents left England to settle the new world. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 confirmed Parliament's supremacy over the monarch, represented by John Locke's Second Treatise on Government (1689). This laid the foundations for a peaceful unification of England and Scotland in the Act of Union 1707. While Elizabeth I maintained a Protestant church, under her successor James, who unified the Scottish and English Crowns, religious and political tensions grew as he asserted a divine right of Kings.James, The True Law of Free Monarchies (1598) This prompted a series of cases from Sir Edward Coke,Coke had already reported on many significant constitutional judgments, often adding his own style, including Heydon's Case (1584) 76 ER 637, that the task of a court in construing any statute is to find its mischief and the intention of Parliament, and Semayne's Case (1604) 5 Coke Rep 91, that nobody can enter another's property without lawful authority and that \\"the house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his defence against injury and violence as for his repose.\\" See also Calvin's Case that a person born in Scotland is entitled to all rights in England. the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and then King's Bench courts, which denied that the King could pass judgment in legal proceedings,Case of Prohibitions [1607] EWHC J23 (KB) and held that the royal prerogative was subject to the law and cannot be expanded.Case of Proclamations [1610] EWHC KB J22 Coke CJ went even further in Dr Bonham's case, holding that even that \\"the common law will control Acts of Parliament\\".(1610) 77 Eng Rep 638 Though supported by some judges,e.g. Day v Savadge (1614) Hob 85, 80 ER 235, Hobart CJ, ‘even an Act of Parliament, made against natural equity, as to make a man judge in his own case, is void in itself, for jura nutrae sunt immutabilia, and they are leges legu.’ R v Love (1653) 5 State Tr 825, 828, Keble J, ‘Whatsoever is not consonant to the law of God, or to right reason which is maintained by scripture... be it Acts of Parliament, customs, or any judicial acts of the Court, it is not the law of England.’ City of London v Wood (1701) 12 Mod 669 per Holt CJ. cf W Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765) \\"if the parliament will positively enact a thing to be done which is unreasonable, I know of no power that can control it...\\" In the US, Coke CJ's argument was applied in Marbury v Madison 5 US (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). the idea that common law courts could nullify Acts of Parliament was rejected, and the common law was formally placed under the King's control in the Earl of Oxford’s case, establishing that equity (then administered by the Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords) was above common law.(1615) 21 ER 485 Coke fell from favour, and was removed from judicial office. When Charles I succeeded to the throne in 1625, and more fervently asserted a divine right, including the ability to levy tax without Parliament,Five Knights' case (1627) 3 How St Tr 1 Coke and others presented the Petition of Right 1628.Petition of Right 1628 (3 Car 1 c 1) This demanded the King to abide by Magna Carta, levy no tax without Parliament, not arbitrarily commit people to prison, not have martial law in times of peace, and not billet soldiers in private homes. Charles I responded by shutting down or proroguing Parliament and taxing trade (or \\"ship money\\") without authority. The country descended into the English Civil War in 1642 culminating in the capture and execution of King Charles I on Whitehall in 1649 by the New Model Army led by Oliver Cromwell.Debates on the proper nature of liberty were held at the Putney debates, October to November 1647, summarised in ASP Woodhouse, Puritanism and Liberty (1938) 52. By contrast, a bitter opponent of the civil war was T Hobbes, Leviathan (1651) Cromwell, not wishing to become a king, became a de facto dictator. After his death,Richard Cromwell, Oliver's son, briefly succeeded but lacking support swiftly renounced power after nine months. the monarchy was restored with Charles II in 1660, but his successor James II again attempted to assert divine right to rule. In 1688, Parliament 'invited' a replacement King and Queen, William and Mary of Orange, and after a brief conflict forced James II out.The conflict ended at Battle of the Boyne. Known as the Glorious Revolution, Parliament proclaimed a new Bill of Rights 1689, with a Claim of Right Act 1689 in Scotland, that cemented parliamentary sovereignty. As well as reaffirming Magna Carta, it says the 'pretended power of suspending laws or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of Parliament is illegal’, that 'election of members of Parliament ought to be free’, and that 'Parliament ought to be held frequently'.Bill of Rights 1689 and Claim of Right 1689 arts 2, 8 and 13 The justification for government itself, encapsulated by John Locke in his Second Treatise on Government was the protection of people's rights: \\"lives, liberties and estates.\\"John Locke, Second Treatise on Government (1689) Chapter IX The British Empire ended after WW2 as countries, where democracy and freedom were suppressed, demanded independence. The Commonwealth is now open to any country committed to peace, liberty, equality, and development, as in the Harare Declaration of 1991. With parliamentary sovereignty as the cornerstone of the new constitution, Parliament proceeded to set up a system of finance in the Bank of England Act 1694 and the Act of Settlement 1700 created an independent system of justice: judges were salaried and could not be removed except by both Houses of Parliament, no member of the House of Commons could be paid by the Crown, and the Crown had to be Anglican. In 1703, Ashby v White established that the right to vote was a constitutional right.(1703) 92 ER 126, per Holt CJ confirmed by the House of Lords. The Act of Union 1707 formally joined the parliaments of England and Scotland, by giving Scottish electors representation in Westminster.Union with Scotland Act 1706 arts 18 and 19, stipulate that Scottish private law would continue under a Scottish court system. The new union was soon faced with disaster as in the War of the Spanish Succession, the Spanish promised the right for British ships to trade (mostly slaves) in the seas around South America. The South Sea Company, duly incorporated to monopolise trade routes, became the object of mass financial speculation, provoked by government ministers interested in its rising share price. When it transpired, contrary to promoters' stories, that no trade was done because the Spanish had revoked their promise the stock market crashed, driving economic chaos.A Smith, The Wealth of Nations (1776) Book V, ch 1, §107 This was made worse by the decision of conservative politicians to endorse the company to take over the national debt as an alternative financier to the government over the Whig dominated Bank of England. The result of the crash was that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was imprisoned in the Tower of London for his corruption, the Postmaster General committed suicide, and the disgraced Lord Chancellor was replaced with Lord King LC who promptly ruled that people in a position of trust must avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest.Keech v Sandford [1726] EWHC J76, an English trust law case following Lord Macclesfield LC, disgraced by his role on the South Sea Company, impeached by the House of Lords and found guilty of taking bribes in 1725. Keech reversed Bromfield v Wytherley (1718) Prec Ch 505 that a fiduciary could take money from a trust and keep profits if they restored the principal afterwards. Out of the chaos, Robert Walpole emerged as a stable political figure who for 21 years held a majority of the House of Commons,Attorney General v Davy (1741) 26 ER 531 established that any body of assembled people can do a corporate act by a majority. and is now considered the first \\"Prime Minister\\".Walpole's tenure lasted from 1721-1742. In 1765, Entick v Carrington established that the government could do nothing but that which was empowered by law,Entick v Carrington [1765] EWHC KB J98 while the first teacher of English law, William Blackstone represented the standard view in his Commentaries on the Laws of England that slavery was unlawful and that \\"the spirit of liberty is so deeply ingrained in our constitution\\" any person enslaved in England must be freed. However, the transatlantic slave trade had accelerated to North American colonies. In 1772, when Lord Mansfield ruled in Somerset v Stewart that slavery was unlawful at common law,(1772) 98 ER 499 Charles Stewart from Boston, Massachusetts had bought James Somerset as a slave and taken him to England. With the help of abolitionists, Somerset escaped and sued for a writ of habeas corpus (that \\"holding his body\\" had been unlawful). Lord Mansfield, after declaring he should \\"let justice be done whatever be the consequence\\", held that slavery was \\"so odious\\" that nobody could take \\"a slave by force to be sold\\" for any \\"reason whatever\\". this set off a wave of outrage in southern, enslavement colonies of America. Together with northern colonies grievances over taxation without representation, this led to the American Revolution and declaration of independence in 1776.AW Blumrosen, 'The Profound Influence in America of Lord Mansfield's Decision in Somerset v Stuart' (2007) 13 Texas Wesleyan Law Review 645 The British military failed to hold control. Instead, it began settling Australia from 1788.Using the Transportation Act 1717 and then the Transportation Act 1790. In 1789, the French Revolution broke out, and the King was deposed with demands for \\"liberty, equality and fraternity\\". The British aristocracy reacted with repression on free speech and association to forestall any similar movement.See the Combination Acts, etc. While figures like Jeremy Bentham called natural rights \\"nonsense upon stilts\\",J Bentham, Anarchical Fallacies; Being an examination of the Declaration of Rights issued during the French Revolution (1796) Mary Wollstonecraft called for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman as well as men, arguing that unjust gender and class oppression flowed from \\"the respect paid to property... as from a poisoned fountain\\".M Wollstonecraft, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) Chapter IX While successful in the Napoleonic wars in defeating France, and cementing union with Ireland in the Act of Union 1800,Union with Ireland Act 1800 arts 3–4 gave Irish representation at Westminster. liberty, freedom and democracy were scarcely protected in the new \\"United Kingdom\\". To demand democratic reform, the Chartists met on Kennington Common during the Revolutions of 1848. During this time, with the invention of the steam engine the industrial revolution had begun. Poverty had also accelerated through the Speenhamland system of poor laws by subsidising employers and landowners with parish rates. The Corn Laws from 1815 further impoverished people by fixing prices to maintain landowner profits.T Malthus, An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) supported this, arguing that working class \\"vice\\" and overpopulation was the cause of poverty. While the Great Reform Act 1832 extended the vote slightly, only those with property had any representation in Parliament. Although the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 abolished the slave trade within the British Empire, it only compensated slave owners and made ex-slaves in colonies pay off debts for their freedom for decades after. With the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, further punishment for poverty was inflicted as people were put into workhouses if found to be unemployed. In R v Lovelass a group of agricultural workers who formed a trade union were prosecuted and sentenced to be transported to Australia under the Unlawful Oaths Act 1797,(1834) 172 ER 1380 triggering mass protests. A movement called Chartism grew demanding the right to vote for everyone in free and fair elections. As the great famine hit Ireland and millions migrated to the United States, Chartists staged a mass march from Kennington Common to Parliament in 1848 as revolutions broke out across Europe, and the Communist Manifesto was drafted by German revolutionary Karl Marx and Manchester factory owner Friedrich Engels. While the Crimean War distracted from social reform and Viscount Palmerston opposed anything,Letter to Lord Russell (October 1862) 'Power in the Hands of the Masses throws the Scum of the Community to the Surface. ... Truth and Justice are soon banished from the Land.' the American civil war of 1860 to 1865 ended slavery in the US, and the UK gradually enabled greater political freedom. In the Second Reform Act 1867 more middle-class property owners were enfranchised, the Elementary Education Act 1870 provided free primary school, and the Trade Union Act 1871 enabled free association without criminal penalty.See also the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875 and Allen v Flood [1898] AC 1 The Representation of the People Act 1884 reduced the property qualification further, so that around one third of men could vote. Still, outside the UK liberty and the right to vote were violently repressed across the vast British Empire, in Africa, India, Asia and the Caribbean.See S Tharoor, Inglorious Empire (2018) From the start of the 20th century, the UK underwent vast social and constitutional change, beginning with an attempt by the House of Lords to suppress trade union freedom.Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants [1901] UKHL 1 In response, the labour movement organised to support representatives in Parliament, and in the 1906 general election won 29 seats and supported the Liberal Party's programme of reform. This included a legal guarantee of the right of unions to collectively bargain and strike for fair wages,Trade Disputes Act 1906 an old-age pension,Old Age Pensions Act 1908 a system of minimum wages,Trade Boards Act 1909 a People's Budget with higher taxes on the wealthy to fund spending. After a further election brought by the House of Lords blocking reform, Parliament pass a National Insurance system for welfare,National Insurance Act 1911 and the Parliament Act 1911 prevented the House of Lords blocking legislation for more than two years, and removed the right to delay any money bills.Parliament Act 1949 reduced the power to delay to one year. Despite this, the Liberal government, against the opposition of Labour, armed for and entered World War One. At the end of the War, with millions dead, Parliament passed the Representation of the People Act 1918 which enabled every adult male the vote, although it was only after the mass protest of the Suffragettes that the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 enabled all women to vote, and that the UK became democratic. The War also triggered uprising in Ireland, and an Irish War of Independence leading to the partition of the island between the Republic of Ireland in the south and Northern Ireland in the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The Versailles Treaty at the end of the War demanded German reparations, beggaring the country through the 1920s and upon the Great Depression leading to a fascist collapse under Hitler.Predicted by JM Keynes, The Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919) The failed international law system, after World War Two was replaced with the United Nations where the UK held a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. However the British Empire began to crumble as India and nations across Africa fought for democracy, human rights, and independence. To prevent any recurrence of the Holocaust and war, the Council of Europe was established to draft the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950. Further, it was seen that the only way to prevent conflict was through economic integration. The European Economic Community, which became the European Union in 1992, was supported by Winston Churchill with the UK to be \\"at the centre\\",e.g. 'Speech to the 69th Annual Conservative Party Conference at Llandudno' (9 October 1948). See J Danzig 'Winston Churchill: A founder of the European Union' (10 November 2013) EU ROPE although it did not enter until the European Communities Act 1972. Under Margaret Thatcher, significant cuts were made to public services, labour rights, and the powers of local government, including abolishing the Greater London Council. However, some powers were restored with extensive devolution of power in the Scotland Act 1998, Northern Ireland Act 1998, Greater London Authority Act 1999 and the Government of Wales Act 2006. After many years of armed conflict in Northern Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 brought peace. The Human Rights Act 1998 empowered courts to apply Convention rights without the need for claimants to take cases to the Strasbourg court. The House of Lords Act 1999 reduced but did not fully eliminate hereditary peers. Since a financial crisis of 2007–2008 brought about by bankers' speculation,JC Coffee, ‘What Went Wrong? An Initial Inquiry into the Causes of the 2008 Financial Crisis’ (2009) 9(1) Journal of Corporate Law Studies 1. For problems starting in US regulation, see E Warren, ‘Product Safety Regulation as a Model for Financial Services Regulation’ (2008) 43(2) Journal of Consumer Affairs 452, and contrast the Consumer Credit Act 1974 or the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 93/13/EEC arts 3–6. a Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition launched a programme of \\"austerity\\" cuts, and cemented their term in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. After 2015, however, early elections were held anyway in 2017, following a referendum on EU membership that resulted in 51.9 per cent of people favouring to leave but without any clear plan, and 48.1 per cent of voters favouring to remain. While the United Kingdom formally left the European Union on 31 January 2020, the details of its future relationship with the European Union remain to be negotiated. Principles In French, parler means \\"to talk\\", and the old French developed into the English word \\"Parliament\\", painted by Claude Monet in 1904. Though not codified, the UK's constitution is written in hundreds of Acts of Parliament, court cases, and in documented conventions. Its essential principles, though continually evolving, are Parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, democracy and internationalism.See AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) chs 1-6 The UK constitution has not been codified in one document, like the Constitution of South Africa or the Grundgesetz in Germany. However, general constitutional principles run through the law,AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) chs 1-6 and central statutes have been recognised as holding \\"constitutional\\" value.R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport [2014] UKSC 3, [207] per Lord Neuberger and Lord Mance, \\"The United Kingdom has no written constitution, but we have a number of constitutional instruments. They include Magna Carta, the Petition of Right 1628, the Bill of Rights and (in Scotland) the Claim of Rights Act 1689, the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Act of Union 1707. The European Communities Act 1972, the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 may now be added to this list.\\" The main sources of law, which \\"constitute\\" the body politic of the UK, are Acts of Parliament, cases decided by courts, and conventions on how the Cabinet, the Prime Minister, Parliament and the Monarch conduct themselves.On conventions, see Attorney General v Jonathan Cape Ltd [1975] 3 All ER 484 Through legislation, case law and conventions, at least four main principles are usually recognised. First, parliamentary sovereignty is a foundational principle. Through the English Reformation, the Civil War, the Glorious Revolution of 1689 and the Act of the Union 1707, Parliament became the dominant source of law, above the judiciary, executive, monarchy, and church. Parliamentary sovereignty means Parliament can make or unmake any law within its practical power to do so, a fact that is usually justified by Parliament upholding other principles, namely the rule of law, democracy, and internationalism. Second, the rule of law has run through the constitution since the Magna Carta 1215 and the Petition of Right 1628. This means the government may only conduct itself according to legal authority, including respect for human rights.See T Bingham, The Rule of Law (2011) and Entick v Carrington [1765] EWHC KB J98 Third, at least since 1928, democracy has become a fundamental constitutional principle. Originally only wealthy, property- owning men held rights to vote for the House of Commons, while the king or queen, and/or a hereditary House of Lords, dominated politics. But from 1832 adult citizens slowly won the right to universal suffrage.Great Reform Act 1832 (common property qualification rules for all boroughs and counties), Representation of the People Act 1867 (extended the franchise to around 1/3 of men), Representation of the People Act 1884 (extended the male franchise), Representation of the People Act 1918 (enabled all men to vote over 21, and women over 30 with property), and Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 (enabled equal suffrage of men at women age 21). The Representation of the People Act 1948 further abolished multiple votes for graduates of London, Cambridge and Oxford, and other University constituencies, and the Representation of the People Act 1969 lowered the voting age to 18. Restrictions on prisoner voting were inserted by the Representation of the People Act 1983. British citizens abroad can vote under the Representation of the People Act 1985, but millions of UK residents, who pay taxes but do not have citizenship, cannot vote. Fourth, the UK constitution is international: Parliament has consistently augmented its sovereignty and the practical power of UK citizens through membership of international bodies, including the International Labour Organization,See the Appropriation Act 1923 Sch 4 the United Nations, the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Union, the World Trade Organization, and the International Criminal Court. EU membership was challenged by the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, and while the government failed to win the 2017 general election, it is unclear what the outcome will be. Parliamentary sovereignty Parliamentary sovereignty is often seen as a central element in the UK constitution, although its extent is contested.See generally, AW Bradley, ‘The Sovereignty of Parliament – Form or Substance?’ in J Jowell, The Changing Constitution (7th edn 2011) ch 2 It means that an Act of Parliament is the highest form of law, and also that \\"Parliament cannot bind itself.\\"cf AW Bradley and KD Ewing, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2015) 65, it ‘is not possible to predict the outcome of changes made by Parliament to the ‘manner and form’ of the legislative process since, depending on the nature and reasons for such changes, the courts might still be influenced by a deep-seated belief in the proposition that Parliament cannot bind itself.’ Historically, Parliament became sovereign through a series of power struggles between the monarch, the church, the courts, and ordinary people. The Magna Carta 1215, which was later annulled leading to the First Barons' War, granted the right of Parliament to exist for \\"common counsel\\" before any tax,Magna Carta 1215 cl 12, ‘No scutage [tax on knight's land or fee] nor aid shall be imposed on our kingdom, unless by common counsel of our kingdom...’ against the supposedly \\"divine right of kings\\" to rule. Common land was also guaranteed to people to farm, graze, hunt or fish, though aristocrats continued to dominate politics. In the Act of Supremacy 1534, King Henry VIII asserted his divine right over the Catholic Church in Rome, declaring himself the supreme leader of the Church of England. Then in the Earl of Oxford's case in 1615,Earl of Oxford’s case (1615) 21 ER 485, Lord Ellesmere LC, ‘... when a Judgment is obtained by Oppression, Wrong and a hard Conscience, the Chancellor will frustrate and set it aside, not for any error or Defect in the Judgment, but for the hard Conscience of the Party.’ the Lord Chancellor (both the King's representative and head of the judiciary) asserted the supremacy of the Court of Chancery over the common law courts, effectively nullifying Sir Edward Coke's assertion that judges could declare statutes void if they went \\"against common right and reason\\".Dr Bonham’s case (1610) 8 Co Rep 114a Finally, after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the Bill of Rights 1689 placed Parliament's power over the monarch (and therefore over the church and courts). Parliament became the \\"sovereign\\", and supreme. But power struggles within Parliament continued between the aristocracy and common people. People from the Chartists, to the trade unions fought for the vote in the House of Commons, and finally in the Parliament Act 1911 and Parliament Act 1949 for the Commons to prevail in any conflict over the unelected House of Lords: after 1949, the Lords could only delay legislation by one year,Parliament Act 1949 s 1. and not delay any budgetary measure over a month.Parliament Act 1911 s 1. In R (Jackson) v Attorney General, a group of pro-hunting protestors challenged the Hunting Act 2004, arguing it was not valid and could not ban fox hunting, because it was passed avoiding the House of Lords under the Parliament Act 1949, and this was itself invalid, because it was passed using the power in the Parliament Act 1911 to override the Lords in two years and limited the Lords' power of delay to one year. But the Parliament Act 1911 could not be used to amend its own limitation of the Lords power, argued the claimants. It had to be implicitly limited in scope. The House of Lords rejected this argument, holding both the Parliament Act 1949 and the Hunting Act 2004 to be completely valid. However, in obiter dicta Lord Hope did argue that the \\"rule of law enforced by the courts is the ultimate controlling factor on which our constitution is based\\", that Parliamentary sovereignty \\"is no longer, if it ever was, absolute\\", it cannot be used to defend unconstitutional Acts (as determined by the courts).[2005] UKHL 56, [120] 'Parliamentary sovereignty is an empty principle if legislation is passed which is so absurd or so unacceptable that the populace at large refuses to recognise it as law'. There remains no settled meaning of \\"Parliamentary sovereignty\\", except that it depends upon the principle of representative democracy, and its legal force depends on political legitimacy. The UK has committed to international law as a \\"sovereign\\" member, to augment its power through cooperation, in the United Nations since 1945. The first UN General Assembly was held at Methodist Central Hall, opened by Prime Minister Clement Attlee.See also a photo of the first General Assembly. In recent history, four main factors have developed Parliament's sovereignty in practical and legal terms.cf Leslie Stephen, The Science of Ethics (1882) 145, \\"Lawyers are apt to speak as though the legislature were omnipotent, as they do not require to go beyond its decisions. It is, of course, omnipotent in the sense that it can make whatever laws it pleases, inasmuch as a law means any rule which has been made by the legislature. But from the scientific point of view, the power of the legislature is of course strictly limited. It is limited, so to speak, both from within and from without; from within, because the legislature is the product of a certain social condition, and determined by whatever determines the society; and from without, because the power of imposing laws is dependent upon the instinct of subordination, which is itself limited. If a legislature decided that all blue-eyed babies should be murdered, the preservation of blue-eyed babies would be illegal; but legislators must go mad before they could pass such a law, and subjects be idiotic before they could submit to it.\\" First, since 1945 international cooperation meant Parliament has augmented its power by working with other sovereign nations, rather than trying to dominate them. The British Empire, which once colonised a quarter of the world's population and a third of its land, was weakened by World War I, and disintegrated after World War II. While the UK's military power before had been largely uncontested, and so was thought by writers of the Imperial period to be able to \\"make or unmake any law whatever\\",AV Dicey, The Law of the Constitution (1885) 39-40, Parliament has ‘under the English constitution, the right to make or unmake any law whatever; and further... no person or body is recognised by the law of England as having a right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament.’ the UK chose to join in the League of Nations in 1919, and after its failure, the United Nations 1945 to rebuild a system of international law. The Versailles Treaty 1919, in the lasting part that established the International Labour Organization, recalled that \\"peace can only be established if it is based upon social justice\\".Treaty of Versailles 1919 Part XIII, statute of the International Labour Organization The UN Charter, which was \\"based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members\\", said that \\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind\\", the UN would \\"reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights\\", and members should \\"live together in peace with one another as good neighbours\\". The Bretton Woods Agreements Act 1945, United Nations Act 1946 and the International Organisations Act 1968 wrote the UK's funding and membership of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and other bodies, into statute.See the International Organisations Act 1968 ss 1-8 For example, the UK bound itself to implement by order UN Security Council resolutions, up to the actual use of force, in return for representation in the General Assembly and Security Council.United Nations Act 1946 s 1 Although isolated UK governments have infringed international law before,See, for example, the Legality of the Iraq War page. the United Kingdom has always accepted a formal duty that its sovereignty would not be used unlawfully. Second, in 1950 the UK helped to write and join the European Convention on Human Rights. While that convention reflected norms and cases decided under UK statutes and the common law on civil liberties, the UK accepted that people could appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, if domestic remedies were insufficient. In the Human Rights Act 1998, Parliament decided that the UK judiciary should be both empowered and required to apply human rights norms directly in determining UK cases, to ensure a more speedy, human rights-based resolution to case law, and effectively to influence human rights reasoning more by \\"bringing rights home\\". The UK is a European Union member, which commits to \\"human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights\\".Treaty on European Union Article 2 Winston Churchill had called for a United States of Europe and for the UK to be \\"at the centre\\". The Brexit poll of 2016 demanded by Conservative backbenchers and supported by 51.89% of UK voters called the UK's EU membership into question. Third, the UK became a member of the European Union after the European Communities Act 1972 and through its ratification of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. The idea of a Union had long been envisaged by European leaders, including Winston Churchill, who in 1946 had called for a \\"United States of Europe\\" with the UK \\"at the centre\\". EU law has always been held to prevail in any conflict between member state laws for the limited fields in which it operates,Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen (1963) Case 26/62, [94] member states \\"have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields, and have thus created a body of law which binds both their nationals and themselves\\" on the \\"basis of reciprocity\\". but member states and citizens gain control over the scope and content of EU law, and so extend their sovereignty in international affairs, through joint representation in the European Parliament, Council of Ministers, and the Commission. This means that, as the UK is a member of the club, it voluntarily agrees to play by the club's rules. This principle was tested in R (Factortame Ltd) v SS for Transport, where a fishing business claimed that it should not be required to have 75% of British shareholders, as the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 said.[1990] UKHL 7 Under EU law, the principle of freedom of establishment states that nationals of any member state can freely incorporate and run a business across the EU without unjustified interference. The House of Lords held that, because the EU law conflicted with the sections of the 1988 Act, those sections would not be enforced, and disapplied, because Parliament had not clearly expressed an intention to renounce the 1972 Act. According to Lord Bridge \\"whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the [1972 Act] was entirely voluntary\\".[1990] UKHL 7 It is, therefore, the courts' duty, until Parliament expresses a clear will to leave the EU on certain terms, to apply EU law. On the other hand, in R (HS2 Action Alliance Limited) v Secretary of State for Transport the Supreme Court held that certain fundamental principles of UK constitutional law would not be interpreted by the courts as having been given up by membership of the EU, or probably any international organisation.[2014] UKSC 3 Here a group protesting against the High Speed 2 rail line from London to Manchester and Leeds claimed that the government had not properly followed the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 2011 by whipping a vote in Parliament to approve the plan. They argued that the Directive required open and free consultation, a requirement not fulfilled if a party whip compelled party members to vote. The Supreme Court unanimously held the Directive did not prevent a party whip. But if a conflict had existed, a Directive could not compromise the fundamental constitutional principle from the Bill of Rights 1689 that Parliament is free to organise its affairs. In this respect, EU law could not override fundamental principles of UK law.See further, P Craig and G de Búrca, EU Law: Text, Cases, and Materials (6th edn 2015) chs 9-10. See also, by analogy in German constitutional law, Solange II or Re Wünsche Handelsgesellschaft (22 October 1986) BVerfGE, [1987] 3 CMLR 225 Fourth, devolution in the United Kingdom has meant Parliament gave power to legislate on specific topics to nations and regions: the Scotland Act 1998 created the Scottish Parliament, the Government of Wales Act 1998 created the Welsh Assembly, and the Northern Ireland Act 1998 created a Northern Ireland Executive following the historic Good Friday Agreement, to bring peace. In addition, the Local Government Act 1972 and the Greater London Authority Act 1999 gives more limited powers to local and London governments. Constitutionally, it has become increasingly accepted that decisions should not be taken for the UK which would override, and run counter to the will of regional governments. However, in Miller v Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, a group of people who sought to remain in the European Union brought the government on whether the Prime Minister could trigger Article 50 to notify the European Commission of the UK's intention to leave, without an Act of Parliament.[2017] UKSC 5 This followed the Brexit poll of 2016 where 51.9% (of those voting) voted to leave on uncertain terms, comprising 27% of the UK population.See Opinion polling for the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum#Post–referendum polling The claimants argued that, because \\"Brexit\\" would obliterate rights that Parliament had conferred through Acts (e.g. the right of free movement of UK citizens in the EU, the right to fair competition through merger control, or the right to vote for EU institutions) only Parliament could consent to notifying the intention to negotiate to leave under Article 50. They also argued that the Sewel Convention for devolved assemblies, where the assembly passes a motion that the Westminster Parliament can legislate on a devolved matter before it does so, meant the UK could not negotiate to leave without the Scottish or Northern Ireland legislatures' consent. The UK Supreme Court held that Parliament must pass an Act, and could not begin the process of leaving purely through Royal Prerogative. However, the Sewel convention could not be enforced by courts, rather than observed.[2017] UKSC 5, [146] \\"Judges, therefore, are neither the parents nor the guardians of political conventions; they are merely observers. As such, they can recognise the operation of a political convention in the context of deciding a legal question (as in the Crossman diaries case - Attorney General v Jonathan Cape Ltd [1976] 1 QB 752), but they cannot give legal rulings on its operation or scope, because those matters are determined within the political world. As Professor Colin Munro has stated, “the validity of conventions cannot be the subject of proceedings in a court of law” - (1975) 91 LQR 218, 228.\\" This led Prime Minister Theresa May to procure the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017, giving her power to notify the intention to negotiate to leave the EU. It remains unclear that the United Kingdom, or Parliament's sovereignty, will survive if EU membership is eventually given up.cf MacCormick v Lord Advocate 1953 SC 396, Lord Cooper, \\"The principle of the unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law.\\" However this view was disapproved in R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the EU [2017] UKSC 5, [43] \\"Parliamentary sovereignty is a fundamental principle of the UK constitution\\" and at [50] \\"it is a fundamental principle of the UK constitution that, unless primary legislation permits it, the Royal prerogative does not enable ministers to change statute law or common law... This is, of course, just as true in relation to Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish law.\\" Rule of law The rule of law has been regarded as a fundamental principle of modern legal systems, including the UK.cf Aristotle, Politics (330 BCE) 3.16, ‘It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens’. It has been called \\"as important in a free society as the democratic franchise\\",X v Morgan-Grampian Ltd [1991] AC 1, 48, per Lord Bridge, ‘The maintenance of the rule of law is in every way as important in a free society as the democratic franchise. In our society the rule of law rests upon twin foundations: the sovereignty of the Queen in Parliament in making the law and the sovereignty of the Queen's courts in interpreting and applying the law.’ and even \\"the ultimate controlling factor on which our constitution is based\\",R (Jackson) v Attorney General [2005] UKHL 56, [104] per Lord Hope but like parliamentary sovereignty, its meaning and extent is disputed. The most widely accepted meanings speak of several factors: Lord Bingham, formerly the highest judge in the UK, suggested the rule of law ought to mean that law is clear and predictable, not subject to broad or unreasonable discretion, applies equally to all people, with speedy and fair procedures for enforcement, protects fundamental human rights, and works according to international law.T Bingham, ‘The Rule of Law’ (2007) 66(1) Cambridge Law Journal 67 and see also T Bingham, Rule of Law (2008) 8, ‘all persons and authorities within the state, whether public or private should be bound by and entitled to the benefit of laws publicly made, taking effect (generally) in the future and publicly administered in the courts.’ Lord Bingham, ‘The Rule of Law and the Sovereignty of Parliament’ (31 October 2007) King's College, London also remarked, ‘democracy lies at the heart of the concept of the rule of law’. Other definitions seek to exclude human rights and international law as relevant, but largely stem from visions of pre-democratic scholars such as Albert Venn Dicey.AV Dicey, Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution (3rd edn 1889) Part II, ch IV, 189, first \\"absolute supremacy or predominance of regular law as opposed to the influence of arbitrary power\\", second \\"equality before the law, or the equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law of the land administered by the ordinary law courts\\" and third, \\"principles of private law have with us been by the action of the courts and Parliament so extended as to determine the position of the Crown and of its servants\\". See also J Raz, ‘The Rule of Law and its Virtue’ (1977) 93 Law Quarterly Review 195. Contrast D Lino, ‘The Rule of Law and the Rule of Empire: A.V. Dicey in Imperial Context’ (2018) 81(5) Modern Law Review 739. Previously, discourse among international finance followed a restrictive ideal: M Stephenson, ‘Rule of Law as a Goal of Development Policy’ (2008) World Bank Research The rule of law was explicitly recognised as a \\"constitutional principle\\" in section 1 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, which limited the judicial role of the Lord Chancellor and recast the judicial appointments system to entrench independence, diversity and merit.Constitutional Reform Act 2005 ss 1, 63-65 and Schs 8 and 12 As statute gives no further definition, the practical meaning of the \\"rule of law\\" develops through case law. The European Court of Human Rights, following common law principles,Entick v Carrington [1765] EWHC KB J98 protects the rule of law by requiring people's liberty, privacy or other rights are not infringed by the government unless there is a clear legal basis and justification.Malone v United Kingdom (1984) 7 EHRR 14 At the core of the rule of law, in English and UK law, has traditionally been the principle of \\"legality\\". This means that the state, government, and any person acting under government authority (including a corporation),T Bingham, Rule of Law (2008) 8, ‘all persons and authorities within the state, whether public or private should be bound by and entitled to the benefit of laws publicly made, taking effect (generally) in the future and publicly administered in the courts.’ may only act according to law. In 1765, in Entick v Carrington a writer, John Entick, claimed that the King's Chief Messenger, Nathan Carrington, had no legal authority to break into and ransack his home, and remove his papers. Carrington claimed he had authority from the Secretary of State, Lord Halifax who issued a search \\"warrant\\", but there was no statute that gave Lord Halifax the authority to issue search warrants. Lord Camden CJ held that the \\"great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property\\", and that without any authority \\"every invasion of private property, be it ever so minute, is a trespass.\\"[1765] EWHC KB J98 Carrington acted unlawfully and had to pay damages. Today this principle of legality is found throughout the European Convention on Human Rights, which enables infringements of rights as a starting point only if \\"in accordance with the law\\".European Convention on Human Rights Article 8 (1) Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. (2) There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\\" For example, in 1979, in Malone v Metropolitan Police Commissioner a man charged with handling stolen goods claimed the police unlawfully tapped his phone, to get evidence. The only related statute, the Post Office Act 1969 Schedule 5, stated there should be no interference in telecommunications unless the Secretary of State issued a warrant, but said nothing explicit about phone tapping. Megarry VC held there was no wrong at common law, and refused to interpret the statute in light of the right to privacy under the European Convention on Human Rights, article 8.[1979] Ch 344 On appeal, the European Court of Human Rights concluded the Convention was breached because the statute did not ‘indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities.’[1984] ECHR 10, (1984) 7 EHRR 14 The judgment, however, was overshadowed by the government swiftly passing a new Act to authorise phone tapping with a warrant.Originally the Interception of Communications Act 1985, and now the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 ss 1-11, as amended by the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014. By itself, the principle of legality is not enough to alone preserve human rights in the face of ever more intrusive statutory powers of surveillance by corporations or government. The most broadly accepted meaning of the rule of law, advocated by Lord Bingham, includes the principle of legality, human rights and commitment to democracy and international law. The rule of law also requires law is truly enforced, though enforcement bodies may have room for discretion. In R (Corner House Research) v Director of the Serious Fraud Office a group campaigning against the arms trade, Corner House Research, claimed the Serious Fraud Office acted unlawfully by dropping an investigation into the UK-Saudi Al- Yamamah arms deal. It was alleged that BAE Systems plc paid bribes to Saudi government figures.[2008] UKHL 60, [2]-[7] The House of Lords held the SFO was entitled to take into account the public interest in not pursuing an investigation, including the security threats that might transpire. Baroness Hale remarked that the SFO had to consider \\"the principle that no-one, including powerful British companies who do business for powerful foreign countries, is above the law\\", but the decision reached was not unreasonable.R (Corner House Research) v Director of the Serious Fraud Office [2008] UKHL 60, [55] When enforcement or court proceedings do take place, they should proceed swiftly: anyone who is detained must be charged and put on trial or released.See A v Home Secretary [2004] UKHL 56, Lord Nicholls, ‘indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law’. People must also be able to access justice in practice. In R (UNISON) v Lord Chancellor the Supreme Court held the government's imposition of £1200 in fees to bring an Employment Tribunal claim undermined the rule of law, and was void. The Lord Chancellor had statutory authority to create fees for court services, but this led to a 70% drop in claims at Employment Tribunals against employers for breach of labour rights, such as unfair dismissal, unlawful wage deductions or discrimination. Lord Reed held the \\"constitutional right of access to the courts is inherent in the rule of law\\". Without access to courts, \\"laws are liable to become a dead letter, the work done by Parliament may be rendered nugatory, and the democratic election of Members of Parliament may become a meaningless charade.\\"[2017] UKSC 51, [66]-[68] In principle every person is subject to the law, including government ministers, or corporate executives, who may be held in contempt of court for violating an order.e.g. M v Home Office [1993] UKHL 5, holding the Home Secretary, Kenneth Baker, in contempt of court for failing to return a Zaire teacher to the UK on refugee status, despite a High Court judge ordering it be done. In other systems the idea of a separation of powers is seen as an essential part of maintaining the rule of law. In theory, originally advocated by Baron de Montesquieu, there should be a strict separation of the executive, legislature and judiciary.Montesquieu, The Spirit of the Laws (1748) Book XI, ch 6, ‘When legislative power is united with executive power in a single person or in a single body of the magistracy, there is no liberty.’ While other systems, notably the United States, attempted to put this into practice (e.g. requiring the executive does not come from the legislature) it is clear that modern political parties may undermine such a separation by capturing all three branches of government. In the UK, democracy has been advanced since the early 20th century despite the fact that \\"there is no formal separation of powers in the United Kingdom.\\"AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2014) 94. cf W Bagehot, The English Constitution 65, the ‘efficient secret’ of the UK constitution was ‘the close union, the nearly complete fusion, of the legislative and executive powers’. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 did, however, end the practice of the Lord Chancellor sitting as the head of the judiciary, while also being a Member of Parliament, and sitting in the cabinet. Since the Act of Settlement 1700, there has been only one instance of a judge being removed, and a suspension cannot happen without the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord Chancellor following a judge being subject to criminal proceedings.Constitutional Reform Act 2005 ss 108-9 There is now a duty on all ministers to \\"uphold the continued independence of the judiciary\\", including against assault by powerful corporations or the media.Constitutional Reform Act 2005 s 3. Democracy Parliament was recognised as a forum for the King for \\"common counsel\\" in the Magna Carta 1215, sealing a tradition going back to the Anglo-Saxon Witan. The principle of a \\"democratic society\\" is generally seen as a fundamental legitimating factor of both Parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law. A functioning representative and deliberative democracy, which upholds human rights legitimises the fact of Parliamentary sovereignty,cf A Bradley, ‘The Sovereignty of Parliament – Form or Substance?’ in Jowell, The Changing Constitution (7th edn 2011) 35, ‘A further question is whether the democratic process in the UK works so well as to justify the absence of any limit on the authority of Parliament to legislate.’ Criticising AV Dicey, The Law of the Constitution (10th edn 1959) 73, who said ‘The electors in the long run can always enforce their will’, on the basis that executive dominance over Parliament might require revisions of the extent of the concept. and it is widely considered that \\"democracy lies at the heart of the concept of the rule of law\\",Lord Bingham, ‘The Rule of Law and the Sovereignty of Parliament’ (31 October 2007) Speech given at King's College, London. It is also a considered that the rule of law is necessary for democracy, e.g. X v Morgan-Grampian Ltd [1991] AC 1, 48, per Lord Bridge, ‘The maintenance of the rule of law is in every way as important in a free society as the democratic franchise.\\" Lord Woolf [1995] PL 57, ‘Our Parliamentary democracy is based on the Rule of Law.... If Parliament did the unthinkable then I would say that the courts would also be required to act in a manner which would be unprecedented.\\" Reference on Quebec (1998) 161 DLR (4th) 385, 416, \\"democracy in any real sense of the word cannot exist without the rule of law.\\" R (UNISON) v Lord Chancellor [2017] UKSC 51, [68] \\"Without such access [to courts], laws are liable to become a dead letter, the work done by Parliament may be rendered nugatory, and the democratic election of Members of Parliament may become a meaningless charade.\\" because the opposite of arbitrary power exercised by one person is \\"administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few’\\".See Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War (c 411 BC) Book 2, para 37. Contrast Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book V, Parts 3 and 4, translated by DP Chase (favouring aristocracy, by equating it with appointment according \\"excellence\\", supposedly), and Plato, The Republic, Book IV, Part V, 139, translated by D Lee (arguing that philosopher kings should rule over a rigid hierarchy where there was \\"no interchange of jobs\\"). According to the preamble to the European Convention on Human Rights, as drafted by British lawyers following World War II, fundamental human rights and freedoms are themselves \\"best maintained... by \\"an effective political democracy\\".ECHR 1950 Preamble Similarly, this \\"characteristic principle of democracy\\" is enshrined by the First Protocol, article 3, which requires the \\"right to free elections\\" to \\"ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature\\".See Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v Belgium (1987) 10 EHRR 1, [47] on ECHR 1950 Prot 1, art 3 While there are many conceptions of democracy, such as \\"direct\\", \\"representative\\" or \\"deliberative\\", the dominant view in modern political theory is that democracy requires an active citizenry, not only in electing representatives, but in taking part in political life.A Lincoln, Gettysburg Address (1863) \\"that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the Earth\\". Its essence lies not simply majority decision-making, nor referendums that can easily be used as a tool of manipulation,cf AJ Zurcher, 'The Hitler Referenda' (1935) 29(1) American Political Science Review 91 \\"but in the making of politically responsible decisions\\" and in \\"large-scale social changes maximising the freedom\\" of humankind.See FL Neumann, The Democratic and the Authoritarian State (1957) 186-193 The legitimacy of law in a democratic society depends upon a constant process of deliberative discussion and public debate, rather than imposition of decisions.J Habermas, Between Facts and Norms (1996) 135, ‘the only law that counts as legitimate is one that could be rationally accepted by all citizens in a discursive process of opinion- and will-formation.’ It is also generally agreed that basic standards in political, social and economic rights are necessary to ensure everyone can play a meaningful role in political life.e.g. R Dworkin, ‘Constitutionalism and Democracy’ (1995) 3(1) European Journal of Philosophy 2-11, 4-5, a constitutional democracy means: (1) ‘a majority or plurality of people’ (2) ‘all citizens have the moral independence necessary to participate in the political decision as free moral agents’ (3) ‘the political process is such as to treat all citizens with equal concern’. D Feldman, Civil Liberties and Human Rights in England and Wales (2002) 32-33 ‘it would be perverse to argue that there is anything undemocratic about a restriction on the capacity of decision-makers to interfere with the rights which are fundamental to democracy itself’. See also Matadeen v Pointu [1999] 1 AC 98, Lord Hoffmann, “Their Lordships do not doubt that such a principle [of equality] is one of the building blocks of democracy and necessarily permeates any democratic constitution.\\" For this reason, the rights to free voting in fair elections and \\"general welfare in a democratic society\\" have developed hand-in-hand with all human rights, and form a fundamental cornerstone of international law.See Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 Articles 21 and 29(2), International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 Article 25, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1966, Article 4 Parliament, depicted here by JMW Turner on fire in 1834, has been threatened by the Monarch and authoritarian governments by prorogation or suspension since its inception. In the UK's \\"modern democratic constitution\\",Archie v Law Association of Trinidad and Tobago [2018] UKPC 23, [18] Lady Hale, \\"A vital element in any modern democratic constitution is the independence of the judiciary from the other arms of government, the executive and the legislature. This is crucial to maintaining the rule of law: the judges must be free to interpret and apply the law, in accordance with their judicial oaths, not only in disputes between private persons but also in disputes between private persons and the state. The state, in the shape of the executive, is as much subject to the rule of law as are private persons.\\" cf KD Ewing, ‘The Resilience of the Political Constitution’ [2013] 14(12) German Law Journal 2111, 2116, suggesting the current political constitution of the UK is not necessarily the same as a fully democratic constitution. the principle of democracy is manifested through statutes and case law which guarantee the right to vote in fair elections, and through its use as a principle of interpretation by courts. In 1703, in the landmark case of Ashby v White, Lord Holt CJ stated that the right of everyone \\"to give [their] vote at the election of a person to represent [them] in Parliament, there to concur to the making of laws, which are to bind [their] liberty and property, is a most transcendent thing, and of an high nature\\".(1703) 2 Ld Raym 938, dissent approved by the House of Lords. This has meant that the courts actively ensure that votes cast are counted, and that democratic elections are conducted according to law. In Morgan v Simpson the Court of Appeal held that if a vote \\"was conducted so badly that it was not substantially in accordance with the law as\\" then it would be declared void, and so would even minor irregularities that would affect the result.[1975] QB 151 A considerable body of regulation, for instance in the Representation of the People Act 1983 or the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, restrict spending or any foreign interference because, according to Baroness Hale \\"each person has equal value\\" and \\"we do not want our government or its policies to be decided by the highest spenders.\\"Animal Defenders International v United Kingdom [2008] UKHL 15, [48] and see also [2013] ECHR 362 More broadly, the concept of a \\"democratic society\\" and what is \\"necessary\\" for its functioning underpins the entire scheme of interpretation for the European Convention on Human Rights as applied in UK law, particularly after the Human Rights Act 1998, because each right can usually only be restricted if \\"in accordance with law\\" and as \\"necessary in a democratic society\\". The place of the social welfare state that is necessary to support democratic life is also manifested through courts' interpretation. For instance, in Gorringe v Calderdale MBC Lord Steyn, giving the leading judgment said it was \\"necessary\\" to view the law of negligence in the context of \\"the contours of our social welfare state.\\"Gorringe v Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council [2004] UKHL 15, [2]. See also O'Rourke v Camden London Borough Council [1998] AC 188, \\"the [Housing] Act [1985] is a scheme of social welfare, intended to confer benefits at the public expense on grounds of public policy.\\" More generally, the common law has been increasingly developed to be harmonious with statutory rights,e.g. Johnson v Unisys Limited [2001] UKHL 13, and Gisda Cyf v Barratt [2010] UKSC 41, [39] and also in harmony with rights under international law. Internationalism Like other democratic countries,See, for example, J Lobel, 'The Limits of Constitutional Power: Conflicts between Foreign Policy and International Law' (1985) 71(7) Virginia Law Review 1071. J Habermas, 'The Constitutionalization of International Law and the Legitimation Problems of a Constitution for World Society' (2008) 15(4) Constellations 444. In Germany, see Grundgesetz 1949 Article 25, \\"The general rules of international law shall be an integral part of federal law. They shall take precedence over the laws and directly create rights and duties for the inhabitants of the federal territory.\\" In the EU, see Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council and Commission (2008) C-402/05, holding that international law binds EU law unless it requires an act that would run contrary to basic human rights. the principles of international law are a basic component of the UK constitution, both as a primary tool of interpretation of domestic law, and through the UK's consistent support and membership of major international organisations. As far back as the Magna Carta 1215, English law recognised the right to free movement of people for international trade.e.g. Magna Carta 1215, ch 41, ‘All merchants shall have safe and secure exit from England, and entry to England, with the right to tarry there and to move about as well by land as by water, for buying and selling by the ancient and right customs, quit from all evil tolls, except (in time of war) such merchants as are of the land at war with us...’ By 1608, Sir Edward Coke wrote confidently that international commercial law, or the lex mercatoria, is part of the laws of the realm,Coke, 1 Institutes 182 while the constitutional crises of the 17th century centred upon Parliament halting the King's attempting to tax international trade without its consent.See Bate's case or Case of Impositions (1606) 2 St Tr 371, John Bate claimed he did not need to pay a duty on imported currants imposed by the Crown, as contrary to the Confirmation of Charters, Weirs, Taxation Act 1371, 45 Edw 3 c 4, which prohibited indirect taxation without consent of Parliament. The Court of Exchequer held the Crown could impose the duty as he pleased to regulate trade. The Court could not go behind the King's statement that the duty was indeed imposed for the purpose of regulating trade. Then, the Case of Ship Money or R v Hampden (1637) 3 St Tr 825 held that the King could raise money from trade without Parliament. This was reversed by the Shipmoney Act 1640, and after the civil war and glorious revolution, once again by the Bill of Rights 1689 art 4. At the turn of the 18th century, Lord Holt CJ saw international law as a general tool for interpreting the common law,Lethulier's Case (1692) 2 Salk 443, \\"we take notice of the laws of merchants that are general, not of those that are particular.\\" and Lord Mansfield affirmed that the international lex mercatoria \\"is not the law of a particular country but the law of all nations\\",Luke v Lyde (1759) 97 Eng Rep 614, 618; (1759) 2 Burr 882, 887 and \\"the law of merchants and the law of the land is the same\\".Pillans v Van Mierop (1765) 3 Burr 1663 In 1774, in Somerset v Stewart, one of the most important cases in legal history, Lord Mansfield held that slavery was lawful \\"in no country\\" and therefore in common law.Somerset v Stewart (1772) 98 ER 499, \\"The state of slavery is of such a nature, that it is incapable of now being introduced by Courts of Justice upon mere reasoning or inferences from any principles, natural or political; it must take its rise from positive law; the origin of it can in no country or age be traced back to any other source: immemorial usage preserves the memory of positive law long after all traces of the occasion; reason, authority, and time of its introduction are lost...\\" In modern case law it has been consistently accepted that it \\"is a principle of legal policy that [UK] law should conform to public international law.\\"Saad v SS for the Home Department [2001] EWCA Civ 2008, [15] Lord Phillips MR, quoting Bennion on Statutory Interpretation (3rd ed) p 630 that: “It is a principle of legal policy that the municipal law should conform to public international law. The court, when considering, in relation to the facts of the instant case, which of the opposing constructions of the enactment would give effect to the legislative intention, should presume that the legislator intended to observe this principle.” The House of Lords stressed that \\"there is a strong presumption in favour of interpreting English law (whether common law or statute) in a way which does not place the United Kingdom in breach of an international obligation.\\"R v Lyons [2002] UKHL 44, [27] Lord Hoffmann For example, in Hounga v Allen the Supreme Court held that a young lady who had been illegally trafficked to the UK had a right to bring a race discrimination claim against her employers, even though she had herself been in violation of the Immigration Act 1971.[2014] UKSC 47 In doing so, the court unanimously drew upon international treaties signed by the UK, known as the Palermo Protocols, as well as the European Convention on Human Rights, in interpreting the scope of the common law doctrine of illegality, and held it was no bar for the claimant to assert her legal rights. It has been further debated whether the UK should adopt a theory of that sees international law as part of UK without any further act (a \\"monist\\" theory), or whether it should still be required for international law principles to be translated into domestic law (a \\"dualist\\" theory).See further R (SG) v SS for Work and Pensions [2015] UKSC 16, on the benefits cap, Lord Kerr, dissenting, at [247]-[257] argued the dualist theory of international law should be abandoned, and international law should be directly effective in UK law. The current position in European Union law is that while international law binds the EU, it cannot undermine fundamental principles of constitutional law or human rights.Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council and Commission (2008) C-402/05 The 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum challenged UK membership of the European Union, as 27% of the UK population voted to \\"leave\\": on a 72.21% turnout, 51.89% voted to leave, and 48.11% to remain. The referendum has been challenged as violating international law and common law standards of free and fair voting.See the Venice Commission, Code of Practice on Referendums (2007) on asking questions with concrete, determinative choices. Since the World Wars brought an end to the British Empire and physically destroyed large parts of the country, the UK has consistently supported organisations formed under international law. From the Versailles Treaty 1919, the UK was a founding member of the International Labour Organization, which sets universal standards for people's rights at work. After the failure of the League of Nations and following World War Two, the UK became a founding member of the United Nations, recognised by Parliament through the United Nations Act 1946, enabling any resolution of the Security Council except the use of force to be implemented by an Order in Council. Under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948, the continued colonial occupation, and suppression of democracy and human rights in the British Empire lost any remaining legitimacy under international law, and combined with independence movements this led to the Empire's rapid dissolution. Two fundamental treaties, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 1966 saw the UK ratify most rights from the Universal Declaration. Following the Ponsonby Rule from 1924, the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 section 20 stipulates that a treaty is ratified once it is laid before Parliament for 21 days and no adverse resolution is passed against it. Regionally, the UK participated in drafting the European Convention on Human Rights 1950 which sought to guarantee basic standards of democracy and human rights to preserve peace in post-war Europe. At the same time, following long-held visions for European integration with the UK \\"at the centre\\",e.g. Winston Churchill, 'Speech to the 69th Annual Conservative Party Conference at Llandudno' (9 October 1948). See J Danzig 'Winston Churchill: A founder of the European Union' (10 November 2013) EU ROPE democratic European countries sought to integrate their economies both to make war impossible, and to advance social progress. In 1972, the UK joined the European Community (renamed the European Union in 1992) and committed to implement EU law in which it participated, in the European Communities Act 1972. In 1995, the UK also became a founding member of the World Trade Organization.cf World Trade Organization (Immunities and Privileges) Order 1995 To ensure that the European Convention was directly applied by the courts, the Human Rights Act 1998 was passed. It also passed the International Criminal Court Act 2001 to enable prosecution of war criminals, and subjected itself to the jurisdiction of the court. In 2016, however, the UK voted in a referendum on whether to leave the European Union, resulting on a 72.21% turnout in a margin of 48.11% favouring \\"remain\\", 51.89% favouring \\"leave\\" on unspecified terms (27% of the total UK population).On the post-referendum crisis, see R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union [2017] UKSC 5 and European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017 s 1, giving power to the PM to notify intention to negotiate to leave the EU. However, large majorities in both Scotland and Northern favoured remaining in the EU, and it was revealed that significant criminal conduct took place in the vote.See House of Commons, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Disinformation and ‘fake news’: Interim Report (29 July 2018) HC 363 and Electoral Commission, Report of an investigation in respect of Vote Leave Limited, Mr Darren Grimes, BeLeave, Veterans for Britain (17 July 2018). Litigated in R (Wilson) v Prime Minister [2018] EWHC 3520 (Admin), and see E McGaughey, 'Could Brexit be Void?' (2018) King's Law Journal. This led to considerable uncertainty about the UK's future role in the international community. Institutions The UK system of parliamentary democracy ensures that the executive, and the Prime Minister, is removable by a simple majority vote in the House of Commons. The executive is bound to the rule of law, interpreted by the judiciary, but the judiciary may not declare an Act of Parliament to be unconstitutional. While principles may the basis of the UK constitution, the institutions of the state perform its functions in practice. First, Parliament is the sovereign entity. Its two chambers legislate. In the House of Commons each Member of Parliament is elected by a simple majority in a democratic vote, although outcomes do not always accurately match people's preferences overall. Historically, most elections occurred each four years,The Parliament Act 1911 set elections to take place at a maximum of each five years, but elections usually occurred in a fourth year. Before this the maximum was seven years, but in practice governments called votes sooner. but this was fixed at five years in 2011.Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 s 1(3). By contrast, Australia has elections each 3 years, and the US has presidential elections each 4 years. Election spending is tightly controlled, foreign interference is prohibited, and donations and lobbying are limited in whatever form. The House of Lords reviews and votes upon legislative proposals by the Commons. It can delay legislation by one year, and cannot delay at all if the proposed Act concerns money.Parliament Act 1911 and Parliament Act 1949. Most Lords are appointed by the Prime Minister, through the Queen,Life Peerages Act 1958 s 1 on the advice of a Commission which, by convention, offers some balance between political parties. Ninety-two hereditary peers remain.House of Lords Act 1999 ss 1-2, or 90 plus the \\"Lord Great Chamberlain\\" and the \\"Earl Marshal\\". To become law, each Act of Parliament must be read by both houses three times, and given royal assent by the monarch. The monarch cannot veto legislation, by convention, since 1708. Second, the judiciary interprets the law. It can not strike down an Act of Parliament, but the judiciary ensures that any law which may violate fundamental rights has to be clearly expressed, to force politicians to openly confront what they are doing and \\"accept the political cost\\".R (Simms) v SS for the Home Department [1999] UKHL 33, [2000] 2 AC 115, 131, Lord Hoffmann Under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the judiciary is appointed by the Judicial Appointments Commission with cross-party and judicial recommendations, to protect judicial independence. Third, the executive branch of government is led by the Prime Minister who must be able to command a majority in the House of Commons. The Cabinet of Ministers is appointed by the Prime Minister to lead the main departments of state, such as the Treasury, the Foreign Office, the Department of Health and the Department of Education. Officially the \\"head of state\\" is the monarch, but all prerogative power is exercised by the Prime Minister, subject to judicial review. Fourth, as the UK matured as a modern democracy, an extensive system of civil servants, and public service institutions developed to deliver UK residents economic, social and legal rights. All public bodies, and private bodies that perform public functions, are bound by the rule of law. Parliament In the UK constitution, Parliament sits at the apex of power. It emerged through a series of revolutions as the dominant body, over the church, courts, and the monarch,Following Magna Carta 1215, see the Acts of Supremacy 1534, the Earl of Oxford's case (1615) 21 ER 485, and the Bill of Rights 1689 and within Parliament the House of Commons emerged as the dominant chamber, over the House of Lords that traditionally represented the aristocracy.This was represented by the Parliament Act 1911, following the People's Budget of 1909. The central justification for Parliamentary sovereignty is usually thought to be its democratic nature, although it was only upon the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 that Parliament could be said to have finally become \\"democratic\\" in any modern sense (as property qualifications to vote were abolished for everyone over 21), and not until after WW2 that decolonisation, university constituencies and lowering of the voting age took place. Parliament's main functions are to legislate, to allocate money for public spending, and to scrutinise the government.See JS Mill, Considerations on Representative Government (1861) ch 5. AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) ch 8. In practice many MPs are involved in Parliamentary committees which investigate spending, policies, laws and their impact, and often report to recommend reform. For instance, the Modernisation Committee of the House of Commons in 2002 recommended publishing draft bills before they became law, and was later found to have been highly successful.HC Modernisation Committee (2001-2) HC 1168, recommended publishing draft bills, and (2005-6) HC 1097, 'one of the most successful Parliamentary innovations of the last ten years' and 'should become more widespread'. There are 650 Members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons, currently elected in five year terms unless two- thirds vote for an early election,Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 s 1(3) and 790 peers in the House of Lords. For a proposed Bill to become an Act, and law, it must be read three times in each chamber, and given royal assent by the monarch. House of Commons is the most important body in the UK constitution. Its Members of Parliament are democratically elected by constituencies across the UK, and the parties who have a majority in the Commons form the UK government. Today the House of Commons is the primary organ of representative government. The Representation of the People Act 1983 section 1 gives the right to vote for MP in the House of Commons to all Commonwealth citizens, and citizens of the Republic of Ireland, who are over age 18, and registered. Sections 3 and 4 exclude people who are convicted of an offence and in a penal institution, or detained under mental health laws.Mental Health Act 1983 or Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964 These restrictions fall below European standards, which require that people who are convicted of very minor crimes (such as petty theft or drug offences) have the right to vote.See Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2) [2005] ECHR 681 (blanket disqualification of convicted prisoners from voting breached ECHR Prot 1, art 3. After this the UK failed to change its laws. Green v United Kingdom [2010] ECHR 868 reaffirmed the position. HL Paper 103, HC 924 (2013-14) recommended prisoners serving under 12 months should be entitled to vote. Parliament still did not act. McHugh v UK [2015] ECHR 155, reaffirmed breach but awarded no compensation or costs.However, Moohan v Lord Advocate [2014] UKSC 67 and Moohan v UK (13 June 2017) App No 22962/15, denial of prisoner voting in the Scottish independent referendum was not a breach of art 3. Since 2013, everyone has to register individually to vote (for instance, at www.gov.uk/register-to-vote), instead of households being able to register collectively, but an annual household canvass is conducted to increase the number of registered people.Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013 ss 1-5 As far back as 1703,Ashby v White recognised the right to \\"vote at the election of a person to represent him or [her] in Parliament, there to concur to the making of laws, which are to bind his liberty and property\\" as \\"a most transcendent thing, and of an high nature\\".(1703) 2 Ld Raym 938 This originally meant that any interference in that right would lead to damages. If the denial of voting would have changed the result, or if a vote was \\"conducted so badly that it was not substantially in accordance with the law\\" the vote would have to be run again.Morgan v Simpson [1975] QB 151, per Lord Denning MR So, in Morgan v Simpson the Court of Appeal declared that an election for a Greater London Council seat was not valid after it was found that 44 unstamped ballot papers were not counted. These common law principles predate statutory regulation, and therefore appear to apply to any vote, including elections and referendums.cf R (Wilson) v Prime Minister [2018] EWHC 3520 (Admin), and E McGaughey, 'Could Brexit be Void?' (2018) King's Law Journal Election spending is tightly controlled today by statute. A maximum of £20 million can be spent by political parties in national campaigns, plus £10,000 in each constituency.PPERA 2000 ss 72-131 and Schs 8-13, in referendums, the limit has traditionally been set at £600,000 for the official campaigns on each side. Political advertisements on television are prohibited except for those in certain free time slots,Communications Act 2003 ss 319-333. although the internet remains largely unregulated. Any spending over £500 by third parties must be disclosed. While these rules are strict, they were held in Animal Defenders International v UK to be compatible with the Convention because \\"each person has equal value\\" and \\"we do not want our government or its policies to be decided by the highest spenders.\\"Animal Defenders International v United Kingdom [2008] UKHL 15, [48] per Baroness Hale. Confirmed in [2013] ECHR 362. Foreign interference in voting is completely prohibited, including any \\"broadcasting\\" (also over the internet) \\"with intent to influence persons to give or refrain from giving their votes\\".Representation of the People Act 1983 ss 92. Furthermore, any \\"trading\\" with hostile foreign parties with whom the UK is \\"at war\\" may lead to seven years in prison. Trading with the Enemy Act 1939 (c 89) ss 1-2, seven years prison for trading with an enemy who is \\"at war with His majesty\\". Donations by foreign parties can be forfeited in their entirety to the Electoral Commission.R (Electoral Commission) v City of Westminster Magistrate's Court and UKIP [2010] UKSC 40, holding that a partial forfeiture of £349,216 donations by a non-UK resident was appropriate. Domestic donations are limited to registered parties, and must be reported, when they are over £7,500 nationally or £1,500 locally, to the Electoral Commission.Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 ss 12-69 and 149 The system for electing the Commons is based on constituencies, whose boundaries are periodically reviewed to even out populations.Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, setting up the Boundary Commission. See also, R (McWhirter) v Home Secretary (21 October 1969) The Times, elector in Enfield sought mandamus ('we command') to require Home Secretary to perform statutory duty of laying before Parliament Commission reports with draft orders in Council. There has been considerable debate about the first-past-the-post system of voting the UK uses, as it tends to exclude minority parties. By contrast, in Australia voters may select preferences for candidates, although this system was rejected in a 2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum staged by the Cameron-Clegg coalition. In the European Parliament, voters choose a party from multi-member regional constituencies: this tends to give smaller parties much greater representation. In the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and London Assembly, voters have the choice of both constituencies and a party list, which tends to reflect overall preferences best. To be elected as an MP, most people generally become members of political parties, and must be over 18 on the day of nomination to run for a seat,Electoral Administration Act 2006 s 17 be a qualifying Commonwealth or Irish citizen,Act of Settlement 1700 s 3 unless ‘qualifying Commonwealth and Irish citizens, British Nationality Act 1981 Sch 7 and Electoral Administration Act 2006 s 18 not be bankrupt,Insolvency Act 1986 s 426A(5) found guilty of corrupt practices,RPA 1983 ss 160 and 173 or be a Lord, judge or employee of the civil service.House of Commons Disqualification Act 1957 ss 1 and 5 and House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 give further exceptions. To limit the government's practical control over Parliament, the Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 1975 restricts higher payment of salaries to a set number of MPs.Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 1975 ss 1-2 The House of Lords is a chamber mostly appointed by the Prime Minister, loosely based on the Lords' expertise, achievement, or political affiliation. Since the abolition of most hereditary peers, there has been ongoing debate about whether or how to elect the House of Lords. Along with a hereditary monarch, the House of Lords remains an historical curiosity in the UK constitution. Traditionally it represented the landed aristocracy, and political allies of the monarch or the government, and has only gradually and incompletely been reformed. Today, the House of Lords Act 1999 has abolished all but 92 hereditary peers, leaving most peers to be \\"life peers\\" appointed by the government under the Life Peerages Act 1958, law lords appointed under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876, and Lords Spiritual who are senior clergy of the Church of England.House of Lords Act 1999 ss 1-2 Since 2005, senior judges can only sit and vote in the House of Lords after retirement.Constitutional Reform Act 2005 s 24 The government carries out appointment of most peers, but since 2000 has taken advice from a seven-person House of Lords Appointments Commission with representatives from the Labour, Conservatives and Liberal-Democrat parties.See the Lords Appointments webpage. A peerage can always be disclaimed,Now confirmed in the House of Lords Reform Act 2014 and ex-peers may then run for Parliament.Peerages Act 1963 and Re Parliamentary Election for Bristol South East [1964] 2 QB 257, Viscount Stansgate or Tony Benn challenged the law disqualifying peers standing for Parliament. Since 2015, a peer may be suspended or expelled by the House.House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015 In practice the Parliament Act 1949 greatly reduced the House of Lords' power, as can only delay and cannot block legislation by one year, and cannot delay money bills at all.Parliament Act 1911 ss 1-3 and Parliament Act 1949 Nevertheless, several options for reform are debated. A House of Lords Reform Bill 2012 proposed to have 360 directly elected members, 90 appointed members, 12 bishops and an uncertain number of ministerial members. The elected Lords would have been elected by proportional representation for 15 year terms, through 10 regional constituencies on a single transferable vote system. However, the government withdrew support after backlash from Conservative backbenches. It has often been argued that if the Lords were elected by geographic constituencies and a party controlled both sides \\"there would be little prospect of effective scrutiny or revision of government business.\\" A second option, like in Swedish Riksdag, could simply be to abolish the House of Lords: this was in fact done during the English Civil War in 1649, but restored along with the monarchy in 1660. A third proposed option is to elect peers by work and professional groups, so that health care workers elect peers with special health knowledge, people in education elect a fixed number of education experts, legal professionals elect legal representatives, and so on.cf GDH Cole, Self- Government in Industry (5th edn 1920) ch V, 134-135. S Webb, Reform of the House of Lords (1917) Fabian Tract No. 183, 7, at 12, preferring a chamber of around 100 people elected by proportional representation. E McGaughey, 'A Twelve Point Plan for Labour, and A Manifesto for Labour Law' (2017) 46(1) Industrial Law Journal 169 This is argued to be necessary to improve the quality of legislation. Judiciary Proceedings in the UK Supreme Court, which moved to its modern home at Middlesex Guildhall in 2009, are web- streamed live, and judges no longer wear wigs. The judiciary in the United Kingdom has the essential functions of upholding the rule of law, democracy, and human rights. The highest court of appeal, renamed from the House of Lords in 2005, is the UK Supreme Court. Since the 1966 Practice Statement, the judiciary has acknowledged that while a system of precedent, that binds lower courts, is necessary to provide \\"at least some degree of certainty\\", the courts should update their jurisprudence and \\"depart from a previous decision when it appears right to do so.\\"Practice Statement [1966] 3 All ER 77 Litigation usually begins in a County Court or the High Court for civil law issues, or a magistrates' court or the Crown Court for criminal law issues. There are also employment tribunals for labour law disputes,Employment Tribunals Act 1996, appealing to the Employment Appeal Tribunal. and the First-tier Tribunal for public or regulatory disputes, ranging from immigration, to social security, to tax.Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, appealing to the appropriate Upper Tribunal division. After the High Court, Crown Court, or appeal tribunals, cases generally may appeal to the Court of Appeal in England and Wales. In Scotland, the Court of Session has an Outer (first instance) and Inner (appeal) House. Appeals then go to the UK Supreme Court, although at any time a court may make a \\"preliminary reference\\" to the Court of Justice of the European Union to clarify the meaning of EU law. Since the Human Rights Act 1998, courts have been expressly required to interpret UK law to be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. This follows a longer tradition of courts interpreting the law to be compatible with international law obligations.e.g. Hounga v Allen [2014] UKSC 47 It is generally accepted that the UK courts do not merely apply but also create new law through their interpretative function: this is obvious in the common law and equity, where there is no codified statutory basis for large parts of the law, such as contracts, torts or trusts. This also means an element of retroactivity,\\"The power to interpret is the power to destroy.\\" O Kahn-Freund, 'The Impact of Constitutions on Labour Law” (1976) 35 Cambridge Law Journal 240, 244, paraphrasing Marshall CJ in McCulloch v Maryland (1819) 17 US (4 Wheat) 316 since an application of developing rules may differ from at least one party's understanding of the law in any conflict.See Re Spectrum Plus Ltd [2005] UKHL 41. Although formally the UK judiciary may not declare an Act of Parliament \\"unconstitutional\\",See Pickin v British Railways Board [1974] AC 765 in practice the judiciary's power to interpret the law so as to be compatible with human rights can render a statute inoperative, much like in other countries.R (Simms) v SS for the Home Department [1999] UKHL 33, per Lord Hoffmann, \\"In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.\\" The courts do so sparingly because they recognise the importance of the democratic process. Judges may also sit from time to time on public inquiries.Inquiries Act 2005 The UK Supreme Court on Parliament Square. The independence of the judiciary is one of the cornerstones of the constitution, and means in practice that judges cannot be dismissed from office. Since the Act of Settlement 1700, no judge has been removed, as to do so the Queen must act on address by both Houses of Parliament.See now the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 s 33 and Senior Courts Act 1981 s 11(3) It is very likely that a judge would never be dismissed, not merely because of formal rules but a \\"shared constitutional understanding\\" of the importance of the integrity of the legal system.AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2014) 329, ‘whatever the theoretical position, there are a number of reasons which help to ensure that these latter powers are unlikely ever to be used, with the security of judicial tenure relying not so much on legal rules as on a shared constitutional understanding which these rules reflect.’ This is reflected, for example, in the sub judice rule that matters awaiting decision in court should not be prejudged in a Parliamentary debate.Codified in 1963, updated in 1972 and 2001, HC Deb (15 December 2001) col 1012. The Lord Chancellor (once head of the judiciary but now simply a government minister) also has a statutory duty to uphold the independence of the judiciary,Constitutional Reform Act 2005 s 3 for instance, against attacks upon their integrity by media, corporations, or the government itself. Members of the judiciary can be appointed from among any member of the legal profession who has over 10 years of experience having rights of audience before a court: this usually includes barristers, but can also mean solicitors or academics.Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 Appointments should be made \\"solely on merit\\" but regard may be had to the need for diversity when two candidates have equal qualifications. For appointments to the Supreme Court, a five-member Judicial Appointments Committee is formed including one Supreme Court judge, three members from the Judicial Appointments Commission, and one lay person.CRA 2005 s 27A and SI 2013/2193. See also Judicial Appointments Regulations 2013 (SI 2192) For other senior judges such as those on the Court of Appeal, or for the Lord Chief Justice, Master of the Rolls, or the heads of the High Court divisions, a similar five member panel with two judges is formed.CRA 2005 ss 70-79 Gender and ethnic diversity is lacking in the UK judiciary compared to other developed countries, and potentially compromises the expertise and administration of justice.cf 'Baroness Brenda Hale: \\"I often ask myself 'why am I here?'\\" (17 September 2010) Guardian \\"I'm quite embarrassed to be the only justice to tick a lot of the diversity boxes, for example the gender one, the subject areas in which I'm interested (which are not ones that most of my colleagues have had much to do with up until now), the fact that I went to a non-fee-paying school and the fact that I wasn't a practitioner for any great length of time. I'm different from most of my colleagues in a number of respects (and they're probably at least as conscious of this as I am). I think we could do with more of that sort of diversity.\\" Backing up the judiciary is a considerable body of administrative law. The Contempt of Court Act 1981 enables a court to hold anyone in contempt, and commit the person to imprisonment, for violating a court order, or behaviour that could compromise a fair judicial process. In practice this is enforced by the executive. The Lord Chancellor heads the Ministry of Justice, which performs various functions including administering the Legal Aid Agency for people who cannot afford access to the courts. In R (UNISON) v Lord Chancellor the government suffered scathing criticism for creating high fees that cut the number of applicants to employment tribunals by 70 per cent.[2017] UKSC 51 The Attorney General of the UK and the Solicitor General represent the Crown in litigation. The Attorney General also appoints the Director of Public Prosecutions who heads the Crown Prosecution Service, which reviews cases submitted by the police for prosecution, and conducts them on behalf of the Crown.See the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 Executive The Prime Minister, at 10 Downing Street, exercises political power of the UK government, when they command majority support of the House of Commons. The executive branch, while subservient to Parliament and judicial oversight, exercises day to day power of the UK government. In form, the UK remains a constitutional monarchy. The formal head of state is Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, a hereditary monarch since 1952. In reality, no Queen or King has attempted to usurp the will of Parliament since 1708, and all constitutional duties and power are accepted by binding convention to have shifted to the Prime Minister, Parliament or the courts.See R Blackburn, ‘Monarchy and the personal prerogatives’ [2004] Public Law 546, explaining that the \\"personal prerogative\\" of the monarch is a set of powers that must be exercised according to law, and must follow the advice of the Prime Minister, or in accordance with Parliament and the courts. Over the 17th century, the Petition of Right 1628 was asserted by Parliament to prevent any taxation by the monarch without Parliament's consent, and the Habeas Corpus Act 1640 denied the monarch any power to arrest people for failing to pay taxes. The monarch's continued assertion of the divine right to rule led to Charles I being executed in the English Civil War, and finally the settlement of power in the Bill of Rights of 1689. Following the Act of Union 1707 and an early financial crisis as South Sea Company shares crashed, Robert Walpole emerged as a dominant political figure. Leading the House of Commons from 1721 to 1742, Walpole is generally acknowledged to be the first Prime Minister (Primus inter pares). The PM's modern functions include leading the dominant political party, setting policy priorities, creating Ministries and appointing ministers, judges, peers, and civil servants. The PM also has considerable control through the convention of collective responsibility (that ministers must publicly support the government even when they privately disagree, or resign), and control over the government's communications to the public. By contrast in law, as is necessary in a democratic society,n.b. the Monarch continued to withhold royal assent for laws in British colonies leading, for example, to the American Revolution and US Declaration of Independence in 1776. the monarch is a figurehead with no political power,cf W Bagehot, The English Constitution (1867) 111, suggesting the monarch has a right to be consulted, to encourage and to warn. but a series of ceremonial duties, and considerable funding. Aside from private wealth and finance,The Sunday Times Rich List 2015 estimated the Queen's personal wealth at £340 million, making her the 302nd richest person in the UK: H Nianias, 'The Queen drops off the top end of the Sunday Times Rich List for the first time since its inception' (26 April 2015) The Independent the monarchy is funded under the Sovereign Grant Act 2011, which reserves 25 per cent of the net revenue from the Crown Estate.Sovereign Grant Act 2011 ss 1-6. This was raised from 15% by SI 2017/438 art 2. The Crown Estate is a public, government corporation,Crown Estate Act 1961 s 1, up to eight Crown Estate Commissioners are appointed by the monarch on PM advice. which in 2015 held £12 billion in investments, mostly land and property, and therefore generates income by charging rent to businesses or people for homes.'Crown Estate makes record £304m Treasury payout' (28 June 2016) BBC News. See map.whoownsengland.org and the colour purple for the Crown Estate. This includes (1) retail property such as Regent Street in London, commercial property in Oxford, Milton Keynes, Nottingham, Newcastle, etc., and a right to receive 23% of the income from the Duchy of Lancaster's Savoy Estate in London (2) 116,000 hectares of agricultural land and forests, together with minerals and residential and commercial property (3) rights to extract minerals covers some 115,500 hectares (4) 55% of the UK's foreshore, and all of the UK's seabed from mean low water to the 12-nautical-mile (22 km) limit, plus sovereign rights of the UK in the seabed and its resources vested by the Continental Shelf Act 1964. The monarch's major ceremonial duties are to appoint the Prime Minister who can command the majority of the House of Commons,I Jennings, Cabinet Government (3rd edn 1959) ch 2 to give royal assent to Acts of Parliament, and to dissolve Parliament upon the calling of an election.Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 Minor ceremonial duties include giving an audience to the Prime Minister, as well as visiting ministers or diplomats from the Commonwealth, and acting on state occasions, such as delivering the \\"Queen's speech\\" (written by the government, outlining its political platform) at the opening of Parliament. It has frequently been debated whether the UK should abolish the monarchy, on the ground that hereditary inheritance of political office has no place in a democracy. On the other hand, there are powerful attachments of emotion and tradition: in Australia a referendum was held in 1999 on becoming a Republic, but failed to get a majority.The vote was 45.13% in favour of becoming a republic, but on a model of having a directly elected president. 54..87% of voters opposed this. See [2000] Public Law 3. official opposition, currently led by Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party, is to hold the government and the Prime Minister to account in and out of Parliament. Although called the royal prerogative, a series of important powers that were once vested in the King or Queen are now exercised by government, and the Prime Minister in particular. These are powers of day-to-day management, but tightly constrained to ensure that executive power cannot usurp Parliament or the courts. In the Case of Prohibitions in 1607,Case of Prohibitions [1607] EWHC J23 (KB), per Coke CJ, \\"true it was, that God had endowed His Majesty with excellent science, and great endowments of nature; but His Majesty was not learned in the laws of his realm of England, and causes which concern the life, or inheritance, or goods, or fortunes of his subjects\\". it was held that the royal prerogative could not be used to determine court cases, and in the Case of Proclamations in 1610 it was held new prerogative powers could not be created by the executive. It is also clear that no exercise of the prerogative can compromise any right contained in an Act of Parliament. So, for instance, in R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the EU the Supreme Court held that the Prime Minister could not notify the European Commission of an intention to leave under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union without an Act of Parliament, because it could result in rights being withdrawn that were granted under the European Communities Act 1972, such as the right to work in other EU member states or vote in European Parliament elections.R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the EU [2017] UKSC 5 Royal prerogative powers can be categorised in different ways,cf AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) ch 10 258-265, listing 9 categories. there are around 15.HC Deb (21 April 1993) col 490 and HC 422 (2003-4) Treasury Solicitor, suggesting an exhaustive catalogue of powers is probably not possible, but listing major categories. First, the executive may create hereditary titles, confer honours and create peers.Subject to the Life Peerages Act 1958 and House of Lords Act 1999 s 1 Second, the executive can legislate by an Order in Council, though this has been called an 'anachronistic survival'.See R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex p Bancoult (No 2) [2008] UKHL 61, [69] per Lord Bingham Third, the executive can create and administer financial benefits schemes.R (Lain) v Criminal Injuries Compensation Board [1967] 2 QB 864, 886. R (Harrison) v Home Secretary [1988] 3 All ER 86. R (FBU) v Home Secretary [1995] 2 AC 513, Re Lord Bishop of Natal (1864) 3 Moo PC (NS) 115 Fourth, through the Attorney General the executive can stop prosecutions or pardon convicted offenders after taking advice.Allen (1862) 1 B&S; 850 and Criminal Appeal Act 1995 s 16 Fifth, the executive may acquire more territory or alter limits of British territorial waters.e.g. the Island of Rockall was seized in 1955, and later recognised in the Island of Rockall Act 1972. See R (Lye) v Kent JJ [1967] 2 QB 153 on alterations. Sixth, the executive may expel aliens and theoretically restrain people from leaving the UK.Nissan v AG [1970] AC 179, now regulated by Immigration Act 1971 s 33(5). The power of expulsion is considered 'doubtful' outside statute: AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) ch 10, 261 The executive can sign treaties, although before it is considered ratified the treaty must be laid before Parliament for 21 days and there must be no resolution against it.Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 s 20, codifying the previous Ponsonby Rule. Eighth, the executive governs the armed forces and can do \\"all those things in an emergency which are necessary for the conduct of war\\".Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Lord Advocate [1965] AC 75, 101 The executive cannot declare war without Parliament by convention, and in any case has no hope in funding war without Parliament.This convention was established through the Iraq war, where Parliament backed an invasion contrary to international law in 2003, and a vote against an invasion of Syria in 2013. Ninth, the Prime Minister can appoint ministers, judges, public officials or royal commissioners. Tenth, the monarch needs to pay no tax, unless statute states it expressly.Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart NV v Administrator of Hungarian Property [1954] AC 584 Eleventh, the executive may by royal charter create corporations, such as the BBC,e.g. MoJ, Rev of the Exec Royal Prer Powers (2009) 23 and franchises for markets, ferries and fisheries.Spook Erection Ltd v Environment Secretary [1989] QB 300 (beneficiary of market franchise not entitled to Crown’s exemption from planning control) Twelfth, the executive has the right to mine precious metals, and to take treasure troves. Thirteenth, it may make coins. Fourteenth, it can print or license the authorised version of the Bible, Book of Common Prayer and state papers. And fifteenth, subject to modern family law, it may take guardianship of infants.e.g. Butler v Freeman (1756) Amb 302, In re a Local Authority [2003] EWHC 2746, Scott v Scott [1913] AC 417. In addition to these royal prerogative powers, there are innumerable powers explicitly laid down in statutes enabling the executive to make legal changes. This includes a growing number of Henry VIII clauses, which enable a Secretary of State to alter provisions of primary legislation. For this reason it has often been argued that executive authority should be reduced, written into statute, and never used to deprive people of rights without Parliament. All uses of the prerogative, however, are subject to judicial review: in the GCHQ case the House of Lords held that no person could be deprived of legitimate expectations by use of the royal prerogative.Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service [1985] AC 374 Whitehall hosts the major offices of the UK government, led by cabinet ministers. Facing towards Big Ben is a statue of Charles I, who was executed in 1649 for denying the rights of Parliament. Although the Prime Minister is the head of Parliament, Her Majesty's Government is formed by a larger group of Members of Parliament, or peers. The \\"cabinet\\" is a still smaller group of 22 or 23 people, though only twenty ministers may be paid.Ministerial Salaries Act 1975. See also, recognising the PM's position, the Chequers Estate Act 1917, Chevening Estate Act 1959, Ministerial and other Pensions and Salaries Act 1991 Each minister typically heads a Department or Ministry, which can be created or renamed by prerogative.Ministers of the Crown Act 1975 s 5. Under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 s 17 the Minister for Civil Service (i.e. the PM) maintains a list of govt departments (for the purpose of proceedings against the Crown). Cabinet committees are usually organised by the Prime Minister. Every minister is expected to follow collective responsibility,See AG v Jonathan Cape Ltd [1976] QB 752, suggesting the duty of confidentiality expires after a number of years out of government. and the Ministerial Code 2010. This includes rules that Ministers are \\"expected to behave in a way that upholds the highest standards of propriety\\", \\"give accurate and truthful information to Parliament\\", resign if they \\"knowingly mislead Parliament\\", to be \\"as open as possible\\", have no possible conflicts of interest and give a full list of interests to a permanent secretary, and only \\"remain in office for so long as they retain the confidence of the Prime Minister\\". Assisting ministers is a modern civil service and network of government bodies, who are employed at the pleasure of the Crown.Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 s 3, putting management of the civil service into statute. Civil Service Management Code s 11.1.1, civil servants employed at pleasure of the Crown, theoretically lacking a wrongful dismissal remedy according to somewhat outdated case law: Dunn v R [1896] 1 QB 116 and Riordan v War Office [1959] 1 WLR 1046, but under the Employment Rights Act 1996 s 191, civil servants expressly have the right to claim unfair dismissal. The Civil Service Code requires civil servants to show \\"high standards of behaviour\\", uphold core values of \\"integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality\\", and never put themselves in a position that \\"might reasonably be seen to compromise their personal judgment or integrity\\". Since the Freedom of Information Act 2000, it has been expected that government should be open about information, and should disclose it upon a request unless disclosure would compromise personal data, security or may run against the public interest.Freedom of Information Act 2000 ss 1 and 21-44. Sch 1 lists public bodies that are subject. The BBC can only be required to disclose information held for non-journalistic purposes, to protect freedom of expression: Sugar v BBC [2012] UKSC 4 and BBC v Information Commissioner [2009] UKHL 9 In this way the trend has been to more open, transparent and accountable governance.

The only region of England with representation, it has limited powers including over transport, the environment and housing.Greater London Authority Act 1999 ss 31, 141, 180 and 333 (with highly limited powers except in transport) The constitution of UK regional governments is an uncodified patchwork of authorities, mayors, councils and devolved assemblies.See S Bailey, Cross on Local Government Law (2004). J Loughlin (ed), The Oxford Handbook of Local and Regional Democracy (2012). S Webb, English Local Government (1929) Volumes I–X. In Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and London unified district or borough councils have local government powers, and since 1998 to 2006 new regional assemblies or Parliaments exercise extra powers devolved from Westminster. In England, there are 55 unitary authorities in the larger towns (e.g. Bristol, Brighton, Milton Keynes) and 36 metropolitan boroughs (surrounding Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, Sheffield, and Newcastle) which function as unitary local authorities. But in other parts of England, local government is split between two tiers of authority: 32 larger County Councils, and within those 192 District Councils, each sharing different functions. Since 1994, England has had eight regions for administrative purposes at Whitehall, yet these have no regional government or democratic assembly (like in London, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland) after a 2004 referendum on a North East Assembly failed. This means that England has among the most centralised, and disunified systems of governance in the Commonwealth or Europe. Three main issues in local government are the authorities' financing, their powers, and the reform of governance structures. First, councils raise revenue from council tax (charged on local residents according to property values in 1993Local Government Finance Act 1992 set up property value bands, but despite proposals in 1995, these have never been altered despite drastic shifts in house prices.) and business rates charged on businesses with operations in the locality. These powers are, compared to other countries, extreme in limiting local government autonomy, and taxes can be subjected to a local referendum if the Secretary of State determines they are excessive.Local Government Finance Act 1992 ss 52ZA-ZY, introduced by the Localism Act 2011. Also under ss 52A-Y in Wales the Secretary can cap council tax if deemed excessive. In real terms since 2010, central government cut local council funding by nearly 50 per cent, and real spending fell by 21 per cent, as councils failed to make up cuts through business rates.N Amin-Smith and D Phillips, 'English council funding: what’s happened and what’s next?' (2019) IFS, BN 250 Unitary authorities and district councils are responsible for administering council tax and business rates.See further Local Government Finance Act 1992 ss 65-68. Council Tax (Administration and Enforcement) Regulations 1992 regs 8-31 The duties of UK local governments are also extremely limited compared to other countries, but also uncodified so that in 2011 the Department for Communities and Local Government enumerated 1340 specific duties of local authorities.See DCLG duties and other duties. Generally, the Localism Act 2011 section 1 states local authorities may do anything an individual person may do, unless prohibited by law, but this provision has little effect because human beings or companies cannot tax or regulate other people in the way that governments must.Localism Act 2011 ss 1-5, which add that the Secretary of State can remove restrictions through secondary legislation. The Local Government Act 1972 section 101 says that a local authority can discharge its functions through a committee or any officer, and can transfer functions to another authority, while section 111 gives authorities the power to do any thing including spending or borrowing 'which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of their functions'. However the real duties of local council are found in hundreds of scattered Acts and statutory instruments. These include duties to administer planning consent,Town and Country Planning Act 1990 ss 65-223 to carry out compulsory purchasing according to law,Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 ss 13-39 to administer school education,Education Act 1996 ss 3A-458 libraries,Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 ss 1-13 care for children,Childcare Act 2006 ss 6-13 roads or highway maintenance and local buses,Highways Act 1980 ss 25-31A provide care for the elderly and disabled,egNHS Act 2006 ss 74-82.

Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000 s 1-6A prevent pollution and ensure clean air,Environmental Protection Act 1990 ss 45-73A ensure collection, recycling and disposal of waste,e.g. Household Recycling Act 2003 regulate building standards,Building Act 1984 ss 59-106 provide social and affordable housing,eg Housing Act 1985 ss 8-43 and 166-8 and shelters for the homeless. Local authorities do not yet have powers common in other countries, such as setting minimum wages, regulating rents, or borrowing and taxing as is necessary in the public interest, which frustrates objectives of pluralism, localism and autonomy.cf Widdicombe Committee, Committee of Inquiry into the Conduct of Local Authority Business (1986) Cmnd 9797 Since 2009, authorities have been empowered to merge into 'combined authorities' and to have an elected mayor.Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 s 107A and Sch 5A This has been done around Manchester, Sheffield, Liverpool, Newcastle, Leeds, Birmingham, the Tees Valley, Bristol and Peterborough. The functions of an elected mayor are not substantial, but can include those of Police and Crime Commissioners.Cities and Local Government Devolution Act 2016 s 15. cf M Elliot, Public Law (2016) 320, ‘The net result, over time, will be a patchwork of combined authorities with elected mayors, supplying a mezzanine layer of government that sits between individual local authorities and central government.’ HC 369 (2015-16) [53] criticised the lack of actual public consultation in creating combined authorities. See also 2012 English mayoral referendums and List of lord mayoralties and lord provostships in the United Kingdom. The Scottish Parliament at Holyrood has 129 MSPs with extensive powers, including taxation. In Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London there are also regional assemblies and Parliaments, similar to state or provincial governments in other countries. The extent of devolution differs in each place. The Scotland Act 1998 created a unicameral Scottish Parliament with 129 elected members each four years: 73 from single member constituencies with simple majority vote, and 56 from additional member systems of proportional representation. Under section 28, the Scottish Parliament can make any laws except for on 'reserved matters' listed in Schedule 5. These powers, reserved for the UK Parliament, include foreign affairs, defence, finance, economic planning, home affairs, trade and industry, social security, employment, broadcasting, and equal opportunities. By convention, members of the UK Parliament from Scottish constituencies do not vote on issues that the Scottish Parliament has exercised power over.cf Sir Kenneth Calman Report, Serving Scotland Better (2009) This is the most powerful regional government so far. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 lists which matters are transferred, but the Northern Ireland Assembly has been suspended since 2017 because of basic disagreements among its members, stemming from long-standing violence and civil conflict, before a delicate peace deal was brokered in the Good Friday Agreement.Belfast or Good Friday Agreement (10 April 1998) The Government of Wales Act 2006 requires a 40-member assembly with elections each four years, and sets out in Schedule 5 twenty fields of government competence, with some exceptions. The fields include agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development, economic development, school education, environmental policy, highways and transport, housing, planning, and some aspects of social welfare.Government of Wales Act 2006 Sch 5 listing (1) agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development) (2) ancient monuments and historic buildings (3) culture (4) economic development (5) education and training (6) environment (7) fire and rescue services and promotion of fire safety (8) food (9) health and health services (10) highways and transport (11) housing (12) local government (13) National Assembly for Wales (14) public administration (15) social welfare (16) sport and recreation (17) tourism (18) town and country planning (19) water and flood defence (20) Welsh language. The Supreme Court has tended to interpret these powers in favour of devolution.See Agricultural Sector (Wales) Bill - Reference by the Attorney General for England and Wales [2014] UKSC 43 Human rights Eleanor Roosevelt, one of its drafters, said the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \\"may well become the international Magna Carta\\" when it was released in 1948.Eleanor Roosevelt: Address to the United Nations General Assembly 10 December 1948 in Paris, France The Universal Declaration was recast in two International Covenants in 1966, treaties ratified by the UK. Codification of human rights is recent, but before the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European Convention on Human Rights, UK law had one of the world's longest human rights traditions. The Magna Carta 1215 bound the King to require Parliament's consent before any tax, respect the right to a trial \\"by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land\\", stated that \\"We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right\\", guaranteed free movement for people, and preserved common land for everyone.Magna Carta 1215 clauses 12 (no tax without consent), 39 (fair trial), 40 (justice), 41 (free movement of merchants), and 47 (disafforesting common land). The Petition of Right 1628 reasserted these values from the Magna Carta against King Charles I. After the English Civil War the Bill of Rights 1689 in England and Wales, and the Claim of Rights Act 1689 in Scotland, enshrined principles of representative democracy, no tax without Parliament, freedom of speech in Parliament, and no \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\". By 1789, these ideas evolved and inspired both the US Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen after the American and French Revolutions. Although some labelled natural rights as \\"nonsense upon stilts\\",J Bentham, Anarchical Fallacies; Being an Examination of the Declarations of Rights Issued During the French Revolution (1789) art II more legal rights were slowly developed by Parliament and the courts. In 1792, Mary Wollstonecraft began the British movement for women's rights and equality,M Wollstonecraft, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects (1792). See also O de Gouges, Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen (1791) while movements behind the Tolpuddle martyrs and the Chartists drove reform for labour and democratic freedom.Turning points were the Second Reform Act 1867 and the Trade Union Act 1871. Upon the catastrophe of World War Two and the Holocaust, the new international law order put the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 at its centre, enshrining civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.Though a UN General Assembly Declaration, not a treaty, the rights are binding jus cogens norms in international law, since two treaties, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 recast the UDHR. In 1950, the UK co-authored the European Convention on Human Rights, enabling people to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg even against Acts of Parliament: Parliament has always undertaken to comply with basic principles of international law.This is qualified, as in the EU, by the position that international law must be compatible with basic principles of the UK constitution: see R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport [2014] UKSC 3 (for the UK), Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council and Commission (2008) C-402/05 (for the EU) and Re Wünsche Handelsgesellschaft (22 October 1986) BVerfGE 73, 339 (first setting out the basic concepts). Because this appeals process was long, Parliament legislated to \\"bring rights home\\" with the Human Rights Act 1998, so that people can raise human rights claims in UK courts based on the Convention directly. The Convention contains the rights to life, rights against torture, against forced labour, to marry, to an effective remedy, and the right to suffer no discrimination in those rights.ECHR arts 2 (right to life). Article 3 (right against torture). Article 4, right against forced labour, see Somerset v Stewart (1772) 98 ER 499. Articles 12-14 are the right to marriage, effectiveness and to equal treatment. Most case law concerns the rights to liberty, privacy, freedom of conscience and expression, and to freedom of association and assembly.ECHR arts 5-11. The UK also enshrines rights to fair labour standards, social security, and a multitude of social and economic rights through its legislation. Liberty and a fair trial The right to liberty of the person, to be free from the domination or servitude of others, and only to lose one's liberty 'by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land' has been fundamental to UK and English law since the Magna Carta.Magna Carta 1215 ch XXIX, 'NO Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land. We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right.' This said, slavery and serfdom took until the 16th century to break down in England, and was maintained at least until 1833 within the British Empire, before full abolition of forced labour was passed, extending the writ of habeas corpus (the right to one's own body) to everyone.cf Somerset v Stewart (1772) 98 ER 499, and now article 4. See also the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 and Bird v Jones (1845) 7 QB 742. Benjamin Franklin's adage, that people who sacrifice liberty for security will lose both and deserve neither,cf Benjamin Franklin, Objections to Barclay’s Draft Articles of February 16 (1775) 'They who can give up essential Liberty to obtain a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.' is reflected in human rights law. Like international law,Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 arts 3 and 9-11. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 arts 9-16 the European Convention on Human Rights article 5 states no 'one shall be deprived of [their] liberty' unless law expressly allows that person's detention after conviction, a lawful arrest or detention on suspicion of an offence, detention of a minor for education, detention for health or stopping infectious diseases spreading, or for lawful deportation or extradition.ECHR art 5(1) People must be told reasons for any detention, be put on trial in a reasonable time, or released immediately with compensation if detention was unlawful.ECHR art 5(2)-(5) Article 6 requires a fair trial, with a presumption of innocence, and legal aid if justice requires it, according to principles of natural justice. Article 7 prohibits criminal offences applying retroactively to acts done before something was made criminal. In practice, every power of the police or the state to maintain order and security 'inevitably means a corresponding reduction in the liberty of the individual',AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) 398, ‘Every power conferred on police officers inevitably means a corresponding reduction in the liberty of the individual, and brings us face to face with Convention obligations.' and the UK has among the highest spending on policing in the world.Home Affairs Committee, Policing in the 21st Century (2007-8) HC 364-I, para 67, the UK spent 2.5% of GDP on police, the OECD’s highest. For this reason the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, and the limits to police powers, is a key legislative guardian of liberty in the UK today. community support officers including giving a fixed penalty notice,Police Reform Act 2002 s 40 but not the wider search or arrest powers of police. Three main issues of police power and liberty are (1) powers of arrest, detention and questioning, (2) powers to enter, search or seize property, and (3) the accountability of the police for abuse of power. First, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 section 1 allows a constable to stop and search people if a constable 'has reasonable grounds for suspecting' that they will 'find stolen or prohibited articles', they may seize the articles, and they may use reasonable force.PACEA 1984 ss 1 and 117 The constable must give their name, police station, and grounds for the search. People cannot be made to remove clothing in public, except an outer coat, jacket or gloves.PACEA 1984 s 2, and s 3 requires details are recorded. Because of the widespread problem of race discrimination in stop and search, the Home Office Code A says that 'reasonable suspicion cannot be based on generalisations or stereotypical images' of people being involved in crime.Home Office Code A, para 2.2B(b). The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 s 23 enables stop and search powers for unlawful drugs. M Townsend, 'Racial bias in police stop and search getting worse, report reveals' (13 October 2018) Guardian, finds black people are 9 times more likely than white people to be searched. In 2019, 43% of searches in London were on black people: (26 January 2019) Guardian. See also K Rawlinson, 'Bristol race relations adviser Tasered by police is targeted again' (19 October 2018) Guardian. It was formerly seen as 'contrary to constitutional principle' to search someone to find whether or not there are grounds for arrest.Jackson v Stevenson (1879) 2 Adam 255, per the Lord Justice General But since 1994, there is no need for police to show reasonable suspicion to search someone to prevent violence or the carrying of offensive weapons.Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 s 60(5) and see B Bowling and E Marks, 'The rise and fall of suspicionless searches' (2017) 28 KLJ 62. In 2015 the Supreme Court held suspicionless searches were held to be compatible with ECHR article 5.R (Roberts) v MPC [2015] UKSC 79. Under section 24, constables can arrest people without a warrant if they are committing an offence, or if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting they will.PACEA 1984 s 24 The meaning of 'reasonable grounds' is not exacting, but a police officer must not arrest someone in bad faith, or irrationally, or if a suspect is cooperating and arrest is therefore unnecessary.Alanov v Sussex CC [2012] EWCA Civ 235, ‘the “threshold” for the existence of “reasonable grounds” for suspicion is low... small, even sparse.’ Also R (TL) v Surrey CC [2017] EWHC 129 Otherwise, a justice of the peace may issue a warrant for arrest, require attendance at court, in writing, and it can be executed by a constable.Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 s 1 and 125D-126. nb Constables’ Protection Act 1750 s 6 means a constable who arrests someone in good faith is protected from liability from arrest if it turns out the warrant was beyond the jurisdiction of the person who issued it. With a warrant, a constable can enter and search premises to make an arrest, or enter and search after an arrest. In addition, any person can make a 'citizens' arrest of another person who is in the act of committing an indictable offence.PACEA 1984 s 24A Anyone being arrested mus be told the fact of arrest, and the reasons, or be told as soon as practicable, and if they are not the arrest is unlawful.PACEA 1984 s 28. Hill v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire [1990] 1 All ER 1046, s 28 is a rule ‘laid down by Parliament to protect the individual against the excess or abuse of the power of arrest’. Christie v Leachinsky [1947] AC 573, ‘the arrested man is entitled to be told what is the act for which he is arrested.’ People who are arrested must be brought to a police station as soon as practicable, and there must either be released, charged or detained for questioning.PACEA 1984 ss 30-39 People can only be detained without charge for 24 hours, but this can be extended to 36 hours for an indictable offence, or another 36 hours (i.e. 72 hours in total) but only with approval of a magistrate's court where the detainee has a right to legal representation.PACEA 1984 ss 41-45ZA. People can be searched at a police station with an inspector's authority, but can only do intimate searches of orifices if there are reasonable grounds for thinking there is a class A drug or article that could cause injury. A detainee has the right to inform a friend or relative, and consult a solicitor, but this right can be delayed by 36 hours if arrested for an indictable offence or 48 hours for terrorism.PACEA 1984 ss 54-58 and Terrorism Act 2000 s 41 and Sch 8 para 9. Ibrahim v UK [2016] ECHR 750, suggests that damages were recoverable for denial of access to a solicitor in breach of Convention rights. cf Cullen v Chief Constable of the RUC [2003] UKHL 39, held there was no right to damages for failure to permit legal representatives, but evidence may be inadmissible. Interviews should be recorded, people can be photographed and drug tested without their consent. 'Intimate' samples of bodily fluids, blood and swabs cannot be taken without consent, but courts may draw adverse inferences.PACEA 1984 ss 60-64A. When being questioned by police, it is acknowledged that the right to silence is ultimately 'at the heart' of a fair trial,Condron v UK (2000) 31 EHRR 1, 20 the right to silence is in ECHR art 6, ‘at the heart’. But drawing adverse inferences is not an infringement. and ‘particular caution [is] required before a domestic court [should] invoke an accused’s silence against him.’Beckles v UK (2003) 36 EHRR 162 No statement or confession is admissible unless it is voluntarily given.Ibrahim v R [1914] AC 599, a confession or statement of an accused person is not admissible unless it is voluntary, not obtained by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage, exercised by the person in authority: PACEA 1984 ss 76-78. A clear exception, however, is that a vehicle owner can be required to reveal the identity of a driver, and this does not breach ECHR article 6.Brown v Stott [2001] 1 AC 681, on the Road Traffic Act 1988 Second, police officers have no right to trespass upon property without a lawful warrant, because as Lord Camden said in Entick v Carrington by 'the law of England every invasion of private property, be it ever so minute, is a trespass.' Here a sheriff searched and seized property at the home of a journalist, John Entick, but the 'warrant' used by the sheriff had no legal basis. The Court held that the sheriff had to pay damages. Today, under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 section 8 enables officers to enter premises and search but only based on a warrant granted by a justice of the peace. There is no right to search communications between lawyer and a client, or confidential personal records, some medical materials, and confidential journalistic material, unless there is an order of a judge.PACEA 1984 ss 9-14 and Sch 1, paras 4-12. See R v Singleton (1995) 1 Cr App R 431. A common law power to enter premises to stop a breach of peaceThomas v Sawkins [1935] 2 KB 249, power to enter to stop breach of peace: controversial. KD Ewing and C Gearty, The Struggle for Civil Liberties (2000) ch 6. was held in McLeod v UK to have unjustifiably violated the right to privacy under ECHR article 8, because the police used it to help an ex-husband recover property when an ex-wife was absent from a home.McLeod v UK (1998) 27 EHRR 493 Under section 19, an officer can seize material if they have reasonable grounds to believe it was obtained by committing an offence, or if it is evidence, but not if it is subject to legal privilege.PACEA 1984 ss 19 and 21, a record must be provided to the occupier, and a person has a right of access under police supervision unless this would prejudice investigation. Third, although 'the law does not encourage' someone to 'resist the authority of... an officer of the law', there is an inherent right to resist an unlawful arrest,Christie v Leachinsky [1947] AC 573, 599, per Lord du Parcq, and at 591, Lord Simonds, ‘it is the corollary of the right of every citizen to be thus free from arrest that he should be entitled to resist arrest unless that arrest is lawful’. See also Abbassy v MPC [1990] 1 All ER 193, Woolf LJ but it is an offence to resist a lawful arrest.Police Act 1996 s 89 By contrast, before being formally arrested, in R v Iqbal a man accused of drug offences was detained and handcuffed by police while attending a friend's trial, but before being arrested he broke free and escaped. He was caught again, and convicted for escaping lawful custody, but the Lord Chief Justice overturned the conviction because there was no lawful arrest, and the offence could not be widened 'by making it apply to those whose arrest has been deliberately postponed.'R v Iqbal [2011] EWCA Crim 273 Anyone can bring a claim against police for unlawful conduct, the chief constable is vicariously liable for constables' conduct, and exemplary damages are available for 'oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional actions'.Police Act 1996 s 88, Police Reform Act 2002 s 42 and Kuddus v Chief Constable of Leicestershire Constabulary [2001] UKHL 29 Evidence illegally obtained, such as a confession, and certainly anything through 'torture, inhuman or degrading treatment and the use or threat of violence' must be excluded, and a court can refuse evidence if it would have an adverse effect on the fairness of proceedings.PACEA 1984 ss 76-78 and see R v Khan [1997] AC 558, an illegally placed surveillance device evidence was admissible, even with probable ECHR art 8 breach, but merely ‘a consideration which may be taken into account for what it is worth’. Schenck v Switzerland (1988) 13 EHRR 242, irregularly obtained evidence can be admitted. R v Loosely [2001] UKHL 53, no need to change s 78 for the ECHR. Since 2011, Police and Crime Commissioners are directly elected in England and Wales (on low turnouts) and have a duty to 'secure that the police force is efficient and effective'.Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 s 1 The Home Secretary is meant to issue a 'strategic policing document' that chief constables pay regard to, but can intervene and require 'special measures' if there is mismanagement.Police Act 1996 ss 37A-54 This means the Home Secretary is ultimately politically responsible, but administration is largely local. Commissioners have a duty to enforce the law, but decisions about how to allocate scarce resources mean that police forces can choose to prioritise tackling some kinds of crime (e.g. violence) over others (e.g. drugs).e.g. R v MPC ex p Blackburn (No 3) [1973] QB 241 Generally police forces will not be liable in tort for failing to stop criminal acts,Hill v CC of West Yorkshire [1989] AC 53 but positive duties do exist to take preventative measures or properly investigate allegations.Osman v UK (2000) 29 EHRR 245, ECHR art 2 requires the state ‘to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual.’ But breach hard to establish. DSD v MPC [2018] UKSC 11 Privacy The constitutional importance of privacy, of one’s home, belongings, and correspondence, has been recognised since 1604, when Sir Edward Coke wrote that the ‘house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress’.Semayne’s case (1604) 77 Eng Rep 194, Sir Edward Coke, ‘The house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his defence against injury and violence as for his repose.’ While rights to liberty and a fair trial also protect against unjustified search or seizure, the European Convention on Human Rights article 8 enshrines the right to one’s ‘private and family life’, ‘home’ and ‘correspondence’ unless interference is ‘in accordance with the law’ and ‘necessary in a democratic society’ for public security, safety, economic well-being, preventing crime, protecting health or morals or rights of others.ECHR article 8 The law of trespass, as in Entick v Carrington,(1765) 19 St Tr 1030 traditionally protected against unjustified physical violations of people’s homes, but given extensive powers of entry,Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 explanatory notes stated over 1300 statutory provisions enable entry into people's homes, and while ss 39-47 and Sch 2 enable a Minister to repeal and replace these powers, the government continued to add them, eg Scrap Metal Dealers Act 2013 s 16(1) and with modern information technology the central concerns of privacy are electronic surveillance, both by the state and by private corporations aiming to profit from data or 'surveillance capitalism'.See AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) ch 16, 429, not just the state but private parties violate privacy, highlighting ‘newspapers engaged in a desperate circulation war, or employers checking on employees’. S Zuboff, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power (2019) The four main fields of law relating to privacy concern (1) listening devices and interference with private property, (2) interception of mail, email or web communications by government, (3) mass data storage and processing by corporations or state bodies, and (4) other breaches of confidence and privacy, particularly by the press. Government Communications HQ, part of UK intelligence, is among the public bodies which can apply for warrants to put people under surveillance to detect serious crime. With the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 these powers have steadily grown. First, the Police Act 1997 sections 92 prohibits 'interference with property or with wireless telegraphy' without authorisation by a chief constable or others.Police Act 1997 s 92, following R v Khan [1997] AC 558, (2001) 31 EHRR 1016 which found there was no legal basis for police bugging, and therefore a violation of ECHR article 8. Such listening or bugging devices may only be used 'for the prevention or detection of serious crime' that could lead to over 3 years of jail. A judicial commissioner's approval is further needed if a dwelling, bedroom or office is being bugged, and if refused the police can appeal to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner.Police Act 1997 s 104 On top of this, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 which also generally allows surveillance by police, intelligence, HMRC and councils to obtain private information ('directed'), or surveillance of a residence or vehicle ('intrusive') if for the purpose of national security, preventing serious crime, or protecting UK economic well-being. Only 'intrusive' surveillance requires approval by a judicial commissioner.RIPA 2000 ss 26-36. This has frequently led to abuse, for instance, in one case with a family being put under surveillance to see if they lived in a catchment area of an oversubscribed school,Investigatory Powers Tribunal, Report 2010 (2011) 28. and in another an intelligence officer infiltrating a protest group and fathering a child, after taking a dead child's identity.R v Barkshire [2011] EWCA Crim 1885. Surveillance in public places does not engage the human right to privacy, according to Kinloch v HM Advocate, where evidence of the defendant money laundering was gathered by police following the suspect in public spaces.[2012] UKSC 62, [21] Lord Hope, 'He took the risk of being seen and of his movements being noted down. The criminal nature of what he was doing, if that was what it was found to be, was not an aspect of his private life that he was entitled to keep private.' Second, although the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 section 2 creates a duty to consider whether means less intrusive to privacy could be used, warrants can be issue for targeted or bulk interception of any data, including to assist other governments, but only to detect serious crime, protect national security, or protect the UK's economic well-being, and this must be proportionate.Investigatory Powers Act 2016 ss 6 and 20 Applications are made to the Home Secretary or other appropriate ministers, and must be approved by a judicial commissioner with written reasons for any refusal.IPA 2016 ss 19 and 23 Warrants can also be issued against Members of Parliament with the consent of the Prime Minister.IPA 2016 s 26 Interception should not be disclosed in judicial proceedings.IPA 2016 s 56 Local councils are able to carry out interceptions, albeit with authority of a justice of the peace. Journalists' material can be intercepted, though only with authority of a judicial commissioner. The government can also require internet service providers retain data, including bulk data, for up to a year. Judicial commissioners must have held high judicial office, while the Investigatory Powers Commissioner audits, inspects and investigates the exercise of public body powers. In 2015, over 3059 warrants were granted, and it is argued by MI5 that bulk data enables security services to 'make the right connections between disparate pieces of information'.Privacy International v Foreign Secretary [2016] UKIPTrib 15_110-CH The fact of bulk data collection, however, inevitably means people who have nothing to do with serious crime remain under state surveillance. The world's biggest tech corporations, particularly Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple have vast databases on user behaviour. In 2016, a scandal broke as it was found Facebook and other data was illegally taken and used for psychologically targeted adverts in the 2016 Brexit poll.House of Commons, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Disinformation and ‘fake news’: Final Report (2019) HC 1791 The GDPR 2016 creates minimal data rights. Third, it has been recognised that the 'right to keep oneself to oneself, to tell other people that certain things are none of their business, is under technological threat' also from private corporations, as well as the state.R v Brown [1996] 1 AC 541, 556, per Lord Hoffmann Through standard form contracts, tech corporations routinely appropriate users' private data for targeted advertising, particularly Google (e.g. search and browsing history, email, locations), Facebook (e.g. personal interactions, hobbies, messages), Microsoft (e.g. emails, or cloud documents) and others. Because people have no choice but to agree to the terms and conditions, consent is defective and contract terms are often unfair, legislation has been increasing in strength to reflect the fundamental 'right to the protection of personal data' in the European Union.See the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union 2000 art 8 The General Data Protection Regulation 2016 requires that all data is processed lawfully, fairly and transparently, and on the basis of 'consent' or a contract.GDPR 2016 arts 5-6 The meaning of 'consent' requires more than the basic rules for commercial contracts, and must be clearly and distinctly identifiable, and revocable at any time.GDPR 2016 arts 6-7 Contract terms may be subject to more protective rights contained in UK law.See the Consumer Rights Act 2015 at present. Whenever a 'data subject' has personal data processed or stored, they have basic rights to be provided with transparent information about the data stored including when they have not given that information themselves,GDPR 2016 arts 12-14 to access the data and rectify any inaccuracies, and to demand that the data is erased when it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was originally given.GDPR 2016 art 17. Also art 18 gives the right to restrict processing. There is a further right that data must be portable 'to another controller without hindrance',GDPR 2016 art 20 for instance in switching phone contacts. Data may be disclosed for legitimate reasons, so in Rugby Football Union v Consolidated Information Services Ltd the Supreme Court held that a ticketing agency had no data protection defence against disclosing information to the Rugby Football Union about people who touted tickets against its rules, because the legitimate interest in stopping theft was stronger.[2012] UKSC 55 Article 32 states a data controller must ensure the security of people's data, and notify supervisory authorities of any breach, including transfers to 'third countries' where the rule of law is defective. However, during the 2016 Brexit referendum the House of Commons fake news committee found that Facebook enabled massive breaches of users' data, being sold onto third parties including Cambridge Analytica, which psychologically targeted voters with political adverts, and this data spread into Russia.House of Commons, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Disinformation and ‘fake news’: Final Report (2019) HC 1791, [150] and [255]-[256] The penalties for breach of GDPR rules, since it came into force in May 2018, can be up to 4% of a company's worldwide turnover, or €20m, whichever is higher.GDPR 2016 art 83. There are also databases kept by UK state bodies, including the National Domestic Extremism Database, a DNA Database,S and Marper [2008] ECHR 1581, limits to retain DNA information and a Police National Computer,Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 s 27(4) and National Police Records (Recordable Offences) Regulations 2000/1139, recording people's convictions, cautions, reprimands, and warnings for any offence punishable with prison or in the Schedule. Related to this, the Supreme Court held in R(L) v Metropolitan Police Commissioner that there was no breach of privacy when a primary school's enhanced criminal record check on an applicant for a teaching assistant job showed the applicant's son was put on a child protection register because of neglect, and she was refused a job.[2009] UKSC 3 A planned NHS patients' database, care.data, was abandoned because of protests about confidentiality and security of data.cf J Kollewe, 'NHS data is worth billions – but who should have access to it?' (10 June 2019) Guardian and S Boseley, 'NHS to scrap single database of patients' medical details' (6 July 2016) Guardian Finally, claimants may sue any private party on the grounds of breach of confidence, an old equitable action,Prince Albert v Strange (1849) 1 Mac&G; 25 although one that may be giving way to a tort of misuse of private information.R (Ingenious Media Holdings plc) v HMRC [2016] UKSC 54 and Campbell v MGN Ltd [2004] UKHL 22, [14] per Lord Nicholls, and [2005] UKHL 61 For instance, it was held that it was an unlawful breach of privacy for the Daily Mail to publish private journals of the Prince of Wales about the handover of Hong Kong to China stolen and leaked by a former employee.Associated Newspapers Ltd v Prince of Wales [2006] EWCA Civ 1776 It was also held to be unlawful for a newspaper to publish details of an applicant's private sexual life, even though in other countries the story had spread around the internet, because there was no 'public interest... in the disclosure or publication of purely private sexual encounters, even though they involve adultery or more than one person at the same time'.PJS v News Group Newspapers Ltd [2016] UKSC 26, [32] In this way the common law has developed to uphold human rights. Conscience and expression The rights to freedom of conscience, and freedom of expression, are generally seen as being the 'lifeblood of democracy.'R v Home Secretary, ex p Simms [2000] 2 AC 115, 126 The trial and executions of Socrates in ancient Athens for 'corrupting the youth',Plato, Crito (ca 350 BC) and JS Mill, On Liberty (1859) ch 1 of Jesus Christ in ancient Rome for blasphemy and sedition,Book of Matthew 26-27. Book of John 18. Book of Luke 23. of Sir Thomas More for refusing to bless Henry VIII's remarriage and split from the Catholic Church, or the house arrest of Galileo Galilei in the Inquisition for heresy, exemplified how people's conscience and expression in the ancient and medieval worlds were crushed for challenging people in political and economic power. After the English Civil War, it was established that a jury could acquit a Quaker who preached to a crowd even against the judge's direction and ‘against full and manifest evidence’.R v Penn and Mead or Bushell’s case (1670) 6 St Tr 951, prosecuting Quakers under the Religion Act 1592 (offence to not attend church) and the Conventicle Act 1664 and Conventicles Act 1670 (prohibitions on religious gatherings over five people outside the Church of England). The Bill of Rights 1689 article 9 guaranteed the 'freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament' and stated they were 'not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament', but the first full, legal guarantees for free speech came from the American Revolution, when the First Amendment to the US Constitution guaranteed 'freedom of speech'. The government and employers suppressed free speech through the French revolution and after the Napoleonic wars,eg R v Lovelass (1834) 172 ER 1380 on the transportation of the Tolpuddle martyrs under the Unlawful Oaths Act 1797. until the repeal of the anti-Catholic laws,Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, and contrast the Gordon Riots following the Papists Act 1778. and the abolition of restraints on trade union organising, as well as throughout the British Empire. But after World War Two, the UK signed the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and joined the European Convention. Article 9 states that everyone has the right to freedom of conscience, including religion and belief. Only the manifestation of a belief can be limited on justifiable legal grounds as strictly necessary in a democracy.cf Ahmad v Inner London Education Authority [1978] QB 38, and Redfearn v Serco Ltd [2012] ECHR 1878 Article 10 enshrines the right to freedom of expression which includes the rights 'to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.' This does not prevent 'the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.' Like all other rights these are subject to restrictions set out in law, and as necessary in a democratic society, to stop crime, or protect security, territorial integrity, safety, health, morals, the rights of others, and to maintain the judiciary's impartiality. At Speakers' Corner of Hyde Park, London, here in 1944, people traditionally gather to exchange views, debate, and listen. Debating and free speech societies are found throughout the UK and regularly feature on TV. The practical right to free expression is limited by (1) unaccountable ownership in the media, (2) censorship and obscenity laws, (3) public order offences, and (4) the law of defamation and breach of confidence. First, although anybody can stand on Speakers’ Corner, in Parliament Square, or in Trafalgar Square and speak freely to a crowd, the communication channels with the biggest audiences are owned by large corporate entities:cf Leveson Report (2012-13) HC 779 discussing media concentration and competition. three internet media networks, five television networks, and six corporate-owned newspaper groups, almost all of which aim have shareholders that demand to make a profit.AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) 464, ‘most newspapers are commercial enterprises whose first duty is one arising under private law to maximise shareholder return.’ This means that most speech, with most reach, is designed to be compatible with generating advertising revenue and shareholder profit for the newspaper, TV, or Internet corporation, and controllers choose which speech or images are acceptable, unless the law creates different rights. While there are loose limits on cross-ownership of TV and newspapers,Communications Act 2003 s 3 requires Ofcom to maintain 'sufficient plurality'Communications Act 2003 s 391 requires regular reviews of media ownership, by Ofcom, to be sent to Secretary of StateThe Broadcasting Act 1990 Sch 2, and CA 2003 Sch 14, para 1, states a person cannot hold a Channel 3 (ITV) licence if he runs a national newspaper/s with market share over 20% over a six month period. there is no regulation yet separate advertising business and internet media platforms where their interests conflict with public goals. The Communications Act 2003 sections 319-321, regulates television (but not explicitly Internet broadcasts, or newspapers) to ensure that diverse views are heard, and to restrict discriminatory viewing, or the stop misleading information, and allows a complaints procedure. An Independent Press Standards Organisation operates for newspapers,R (News Media Association) v Press Recognition Panel [2017] EWHC 2527 but this has no publicly accountable legal basis after the industry chose to boycott one. The UK's transparent, and publicly accountable system of TV media regulation is consistently held to be compatible with freedom of expression. Two of the UK’s TV networks, the BBC and Channel 4, are publicly owned and accountable, through an arm’s length appointment process overseen by the government. However, most television channels are funded through advertising revenue. There is also effectively no regulation of standards on Internet media, although the House of Commons committee on fake news called for the same regulation as on TV to be applied after Facebook data theft and psychologically targeted political ads were used by ‘Vote Leave’ in the 2016 Brexit poll. Second, censorship and obscenity laws have been a highly traditional limit on freedom of expression. The Theatres Act 1968 prohibits obscenity in plays, that is 'indecent, offensive, disgusting or injurious to morality' but with a defence in the public good, while the Video Recordings Act 1984 section 9 makes it illegal to supply of a video without a classification certificate, which is graded according to sexual or violent activity. Obscene publications, since early common law,eg Curl’s case (1727) 17 St Tr 153 have been banned although the idea of what is 'obscene' has changed from Victorian values.In the Obscene Publications Act 1857 debate, Lord Campbell, HL Deb (25 June 1857) col 329 said obscene meant ‘exclusively to works written for the single purpose of corrupting the morals of youth, and of a nature calculated to shock the common feelings of decency in any well regulated mind’. In R v Hicklin (1868) LR 3 QB 360, Lord Cockburn CJ (a notorious womaniser) held that immunity for a medical treatise depended on the circumstances, and the author's intent could be taken into account. The Obscene Publications Act 1959 defines 'obscene' as having the effect to 'deprave and corrupt' people, and allows police or the Director of Public Prosecutions to search and seize obscene material, subject to a defence for literary, artistic, scientific or other merit. Pornography, but also non- sexual gay literature, was suppressed until the 1990s,Shaw v DPP [1962] AC 220, finding obscene an illustrated magazine with contacts for prostitutes, and convicting the publisher, Shaw, for conspiracy, Lord Reid dissenting.Knuller Ltd v DPP [1973] AC 435 finding a gay magazine for men to meet other men was involved in a 'conspiracy' to 'corrupt public morals' even though homosexuality ceased to be criminal in the Sexual Offences Act 1967, Lord Reid and Lord Diplock dissenting. There are around 70 cases each year, but today the Criminal Prosecution Service guidelines only recommend charges for 'extreme' cases. The controversial Digital Economy Act 2017, which would have required age verification on the basis of protecting children to access all pornographic websites, by requiring companies take bank card details, has been repeatedly delayed. Third, there are three main public order offences, based on incitement to disaffection, racial hatred, and terrorism. Disaffection means attempting to persuade the armed forces,Incitement to Disaffection Act 1934, makes it an offence to maliciously and advisedly endeavour to seduce a member of the armed forces from that person’s duty or allegiance. police,Police Act 1996 s 91 prohibits causing disaffection among police officers or inducing them to withhold services or commit breaches of discipline. This effectively prohibits strikes, or calling for them, although it appears unenforceable in practice. or others,Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act 1919 s 3 prohibits an 'alien' from causing sedition or disaffection among civil population and armed forces. to revolt or even withhold services. Racial hatred means 'hatred against a group of persons defined by reference to colour, race, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins', and it is an offence to threaten, abuse or insult anyone, including through displays, to stir up racial hatred.Public Order Act 1986 ss 17-27, first introduced in the Race Relations Act 1965. The same idea extends to religious hatred, sexual orientation and in practice disability.Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 s 1, inserted POA 1986 ss 29A-29N. Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 s 74, Sch 16. College of Policing, Hate Crime Operational Guidance (2014) on disability. In international law, it is also explicit, that advocacy of hatred includes 'incitement to discrimination' (as well as hostility or violence).International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 Article 20 '(1) Any propaganda for war shall be prohibited by law. (2) Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law.' In the UK this would engage the Equality Act 2010, and could include incitement to discriminate against immigrants. The Terrorism Act 2006 defines incitement to terrorism as 'direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement' for 'commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism', as well as glorifying terrorist acts (that is 'any form of praise or celebration') punishable with 7 years in prison.Terrorism Act 2006 ss 1-3 and 20 Fourth, the laws of defamation and breach of confidence are designed to balance people's reputations and rights to privacy. The Defamation Act 2013 states that defamation means a statement that has or would 'cause serious harm to the reputation of the claimant', and if that claimant is a profit-making body this requires 'serious financial loss'. The truth is always a defence for stating something factual, and a defendant may always show their statement 'is substantially true', or that they made a statement of honest opinion, rather than an assertion of fact. Further, if the statement is in the public interest, it will not be unlawful. Connected to this, news outlets should ask someone who is a subject of a story for their side.Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd [2001] 2 AC 127 Internet operators are liable for statements on their websites that are defamatory if the poster is hard to identify, and they fail on a notice by the claimant to remove the statement within 48 hours.Defamation Act 2013 s 5 and The Defamation (Operators of Websites) Regulations 2013 Schedule There can be no claim for defamation if a defendant has the 'absolute privilege' of making a statement in Parliament or reports, in the course of high state duty, internal documents or a foreign embassy, or reports of courts' proceedings.Prebble v Television New Zealand Ltd [1995] 1 AC 321, Chatterton v Secretary of State of India [1895] 2 QB 189, Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 s 10(5), Al-Fayed v Al-Tajir [1988] QB 712, Defamation Act 1996 s 14(3) There is also 'qualified privilege' which gives a defence to defamation, but only if the writer asks the subject for an explanation or contradiction, for any legislative proceedings outside the UK, public enquiries, non-UK government documents, and matters of an international organisation.Webb v Times Publishing Co [1960] 2 QB 535, Tsikata v Newspaper Publishing plc [1997] 1 All ER 655, Curistan v Times Newspapers Ltd [2008] EWCA Civ 432, and Defamation Act 1996 Sch 1, part 1. Given the global nature of media, a claim in the UK must ensure that the UK is the 'most appropriate place', there is no long trial by jury, and courts can order removal of claims from many websites if it has spread.Defamation Act 2013 ss 9-13 Claims for breach of confidence are meant to protect the right to privacy. Examples have included an injunction against a retired security service officer who wrote a book called Spycatcher that revealed official secrets.Attorney General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd (1992) 14 EHRR 153 But the government lost its claim to have an injunction against a newspaper on the effects of thalidomide on new births.Sunday Times v United Kingdom (1979–80) 2 EHRR 245 Association and assembly The rights to freedom of association and freedom of assembly are central to the functioning of democracy because they are the basis for political organisation and discourse.AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) ch 18 and E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (2019) ch 8, 324, stating freedom of association \\"is fundamental to democratic society... workers taking collective action were major... factors contributing to the deposition of German Kaiser in 1918, Indian independence in 1948, the victory of the US civil rights movement in 1964, the collapse of the Iron Curtain in 1989, and the end of apartheid South Africa in 1994\\". Political parties, trade unions, social campaign groups, and businesses all associate freely in democratic societies, and take action upon that freedom, including through assemblies, strikes, or protests. Also protected in international law,Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 arts 20 and 23. Also, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 arts 21-22 and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1966 art 8, both ratified by the UK. the European Convention on Human Rights article 11 states: \\"Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others\\" including joining \\"trade unions for the protection of\\" one's interests. Like with other rights, freedom of association cannot be restricted without a lawful justification that is further than necessary in a democratic society, to protect security, safety, health or other people's rights. Freedom of association involves three main principles.KD Ewing, ‘The Implications of Wilson and Palmer’ (2003) 32(1) Industrial Law Journal 1-22 First, there is a right to suffer no disadvantage for associating with others, for instance, because if an employer penalises workers for joining a trade union.Wilson v United Kingdom [2002] ECHR 552, where an employee for the Daily Mail who was not given a raise after he refused to give up trade union membership was held to have suffered an unlawful detriment, violating his freedom of association. Second, one must be able to associate with others on the terms one wishes so that, for example, a political party or a trade union must be able to admit or expel members based on their political values and actions.e.g. ASLEF v UK [2007] ECHR 184, where the European Court of Human Rights held that a union, ASLEF, could expel a member of the fascist group, the British National Party, because it was committed to equality. Third, there is a right to act upon the goals of the association, for instance by campaigning for election as a political party, or as a trade union collectively bargaining with an employer for better wages or if necessary going on strike.cf RMT v United Kingdom [2014] ECHR 366, where the ECtHR held that although a union had the right to strike, and the UK's laws were at the outer limits (with Russia and Turkey) in restricting union freedoms, it was within the margin of appreciation to have restricting balloting rules, and possibly to limit secondary action. UK law generally imposes no restriction on people forming groups for political purposes, with the significant exception of organisations banned under the Terrorism Act 2000, such as the neo-Nazi white hate group National Action or Jihadi fundamentalists in Al Qaeda.Terrorism Act 2000 s 3 and Sch 2, with a growing list of banned organisations. Extinction Rebellion protests in London. Like freedom of association,eg Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch [1941] UKHL 2 and Mogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor, Gow & Co [1892] AC 25 the right of peaceful assembly was recognised at common law. For instance, in Beatty v Gillbanks the Salvation Army wanted to march against alcohol. The march was halted by the police over concerns that a rival 'skeleton army' of local brewers would violently disrupt them, and result in a breach of the peace. The court held that nobody could 'say that such an assembly [was] in itself an unlawful one' and said there was 'no authority' for saying anyone 'may be convicted for doing a lawful act'.(1882) 9 QBD 308, approved in Redmond-Bate v Director of Public Prosecutions [2000] HRLR 249 Any procession in the streets or highways is lawful,AL Goodhart, ‘Public Meetings and Processions’ (1937) 6 CLJ 161, 169 although there is a duty to inform police 6 days in advance if it is to demonstrate for a cause.Public Order Act 1986 ss 11-16. Police can impose conditions on duration and numbers, and may apply for a banning order but only if serious public disorder could not be controlled with conditions. In Scotland, the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 ss 62-64 requires 28 days notification. This said, in Kay v Metropolitan Police Commissioner the House of Lords held that a regular cycling protest called Critical Mass required no notification because under the Public Order Act 1986 section 11(2) it was \\"commonly or customarily held\\" and it did not have a planned route.[2008] UKHL 69 Although the Highways Act 1980 section 137 makes it an offence to obstruct a highway,Highways Act 1980 s 137 is inconsistent with many other EU member state and Commonwealth country rules, see e.g. Eugen Schmidberger, Internationale Transporte und Planzüge v Austria (2003) C-112/00 in DPP v Jones the House of Lords held that protestors who assembled on roads around Stonehenge despite police ordering them to disperse from a four-mile radius,Public Order Act 1980 s 14A could not be lawfully arrested or convicted, because their occupation was 'not inconsistent with the primary right of the public to pass and repass.'[1999] UKHL 5, [1999] 2 AC 240, a 3 to 2 decision. As well as rights to use public spaces, the law creates positive rights to use public property, such as school halls, for public political meetings.Representation of the People Act 1983 ss 95-96, and case law such as Wheeler v Leicester CC [1985] AC 1054 and Webster v Southwark Council [1983] QB 698. But contrast the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 s 59, that enables public space protection orders, requiring application for a public assembly. Universities also have a special duty, imposed in 1986, to 'ensure that freedom of speech within the law is secured for members... and for visiting speakers' and people are not denied use of premises based on their views or objectives.Education (No 2) Act 1986 s 43 This does not mean, however, that student societies cannot protest or that universities cannot prohibit speakers based on likely threats to property or good order.R v University of Liverpool, ex p Caesar-Gordon [1987] PL 344, a university was not entitled to stop a talk by secretaries of the South African Embassy, from the apartheid government, because of fears about violence on the nearby Toxteth estate, but could have done if there was concern about 'disorder on university premises and among university members'. Anomalously it was held in Hubbard v Pitt that an estate agent might be able to sue a group of protestors in the tort of private nuisance for giving out leaflets and displaying placards opposed to it, on the ground that frustrated its business. Lord Denning MR dissented, and would have held the protestors used the highway reasonably, there was no nuisance at common law, and any picket was lawful if to obtain or communicate information for peaceful persuasion.Hubbard v Pitt [1976] QB 142 Whenever a picket is made in the \\"contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute\\" it is lawful,TULRCA 1992 s 220. cf Broome v DPP [1974] AC 587, holding there was no right to stop traffic. so mushroom workers leafleting customers outside a supermarket to boycott their employers' mushrooms acted lawfully even though it caused the employers economic loss.Middlebrook Mushrooms Ltd v TGWU [1993] ICR 612 The right to assembly does not yet extend to private property. In Appleby v UK the Court of Human Rights held there was no interference in ECHR article 11 when the owners of a private shopping mall in Washington, Tyne and Wear excluded protestors collecting signatures to stop the loss of open space from their mall.[2003] ECHR 222 Although UK law could provide more protection than the minimum European level, it does not, and makes it an offence under the Criminal Law Act 1977 to enter 'any premises' without leave, or threaten violence to secure entry. For 'residential premises' it is also an offence to remain as a trespasser after being required to leave. Further, a law dating from 1875, still makes it an offence to 'wrongfully and without legal authority... watch and beset' premises.Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 s 241, originally in the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875 s 7. This fell into disuse, but was revived for miners’ strike: Wallington (1985) 14 Industrial Law Journal 145. In R v Jones, Jones entered a Royal Air Force base intending to damage military equipment during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which was itself a violation of international law.See J Crawford, Brownlie's Principles of Public International Law (2019) ch 33 The House of Lords held that it was no defence even if the invasion was itself unlawful in international law, and there was still a conspiracy to cause criminal damage in violation of the Criminal Law Act 1977 section 1.[2006] UKHL 16, also Criminal Damage Act 1971 s 3(b) The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 also makes it an offence to trespass and reside, disrupt or quat on premises without the owner's consent.Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 ss 61-77, also Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 s 128. Genuine beliefs in the importance of the cause is no defence,DPP v Bayer [2003] EWHC 2567 and an injunction can be obtained for violations. However, in all of these offences, the human right of freedom of assembly or expression of the protestors must be taken into account.On injunctions, see NWL Ltd v Woods [1979] ICR 867, 881, Lord Diplock, stating the test concerns ‘the degree of likelihood the plaintiff would have succeeded in establishing his right to an injunction if the action had gone to trial, is a factor to be brought into the balance.’ AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) chs 18, 501, where human rights are at stake, HRA 1998 s 12 means that ‘courts ought to give more weight to the respondent’s defence than might otherwise have been the case.’ There are also four further significant public order offences. First, it is unlawful to riot, where 12 or more people use or threaten unlawful violence.Public Order Act 1986 s 1, with up to 10 years prison. The famous Riot Act 1714 is now repealed, and the Seditious Meetings Act 1817, which allowed police to disperse meetings lapsed. The Riot Compensation Act 2016 entitles victims who suffer damage from rioting to compensation for uninsured property. Second, using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, including on signs, is an offence if this could make people believe they will suffer immediate unlawful violence,Public Order Act 1986 s 4 or if it causes or is likely to cause \\"harassment, alarm or distress.\\"Public Order Act 1986 s 4A-5 Insults did not include anti-apartheid protests at Wimbledon that spectators resented,Brutus v Cozens [1973] AC 854 and did not include books, such as Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses where the immediacy of any result is lacking.R v Horseferry Road Magistrate, ex p Siadatan [1991] 1 QB 260 Third, harassment is an offence under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 section 4 if it causes someone to fear on two or more occasions that violence will be used against them.Oxford University v Broughton [2004] EWHC 2543, injunctions against animal rights activists. Fourth, while breach of peace is not an offence itself, the apprehension that it is about to happen is grounds for arrest. This has included selling a National Front paper outside a football ground,Alexander v Smith 1984 SLT 176 and a homophobic preacher holding signs in Bournemouth saying ‘Stop Immorality’, ‘Stop Homosexuality’ and ‘Stop Lesbianism’.Hammond v Director of Public Prosecutions [2004] EWHC 69 (Admin) Generally the police may arrest people who they honestly and reasonably think will risk a breach of the peace,eg Piddington v Bates [1960] 3 All ER 660, a police officer instructed at a trade dispute in a North London factory there should only be two pickets at each entrance. The appellant insisted on joining, and was arrested for obstruction. Divisional Court upheld the conviction, the restriction to 2 pickets was not unlawful and arbitrary. Lord Parker CJ, ‘a police officer charged with the duty of preserving the Queen’s peace must be left to take such steps as, on the evidence before him, he thinks are proper.’ Moss v McLachlan [1985] IRLR 76, defendants were stopped at a motorway exit, suspected of travelling to attend a picket at a colliery. They refused to go back and were arrested for obstructing a police officer. Skinner J upheld convictions, saying provided officers ‘honestly and reasonably form the opinion that there is a real risk of a breach of the peace in the sense that it is in close proximity both in place and time, then the conditions exist for reasonable preventive action including, if necessary, the measures taken in this case.’ but in R (Laporte) v Gloucestershire Chief Constable the House of Lords held it was unlawful for police to stop a coach of demonstrators from travelling to RAF Fairford and turn it back to London. There was no evidence that a breach of peace was imminent.[2006] UKHL 55 By contrast, in Austin v United Kingdom the European Court of Human Rights held there was no breach of article 5, the right to liberty, when protestors were kettled in Oxford Circus without food or drink for 7 hours. They were held not to have been falsely imprisoned and the conduct was justified to stop breach of the peace. Arguments were not, however, made under article 11.R (Hicks) v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [2017] UKSC 9 holding arrests and release of protestors on the royal wedding day was not unlawful. Contrast AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) 515-6. This said, the police must use their 'operational discretion' at all times with regard to human rights.cf DB v PSI Chief Constable [2017] UKSC 7, [72] ‘The area of discretion available to the police was also constrained by the positive obligation to protect the appellant’s article 8 rights’. Social and economic rights *Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 art 22 (social security), art 25 (health, medical care, food, clothing, housing), art 26 (education), art 27 (share in scientific advancement and its benefits) *International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights arts 9-14 *ECHR Protocol 1, article 2, education *CFREU art 14 (education), art 34 (social security), art 35 (health care), art 36 (public services) *(1) health and social care (2) education (3) social security, income, pension (4) housing (5) employment on fair wages and holidays (6) equal treatment, (7) clean environment, (8) fair competition, (9) benefits of science, culture and art (10) development of personality. *NHS Act 2006 *Education Reform Act 1988, School Standards and Framework Act 1998 and Further and Higher Education Act 1992 *Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, Pensions Act 2008 *Gorringe v Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council [2004] UKHL 15, it was \\"necessary\\" to view negligence in the context of \\"the contours of our social welfare state.\\" *Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 Security and intelligence *article 3 (no torture), article 2 (life) *Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 *Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011 *Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 s 59 *Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 s 1 *Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 s 23 *A v Home Secretary [2004] UKHL 56 *A v Home Secretary (No 2) [2005] UKHL 71 *Home Secretary v JJ [2007] UKHL 45 *Home Secretary v AP [2010] UKSC 24 *Gillan v United Kingdom [2009] ECHR 28 Administrative law Any person in the UK who is significantly affected by a public body's act can challenge a decision by judicial review. The claims usually begin in the High Court. Administrative law, through judicial review, is essential to hold executive power and public bodies accountable under the law. In practice, constitutional principles emerge through cases of judicial review, because every public body, whose decisions affect people's lives, is created and bound by law. A person can apply to the High Court to challenge a public body's decision if they have a \\"sufficient interest\\",Senior Courts Act 1981 s 31(3) within three months of the grounds of the cause of action becoming known.Civil Procedure Rules rule 54.5 claims can be made up to 'three months after the grounds to make the claim first arose', but the period can be shorter if legislation says so. By contrast, claims against public bodies in tort or contract, where the Limitation Act 1980 usually sets the period as 6 years.Limitation Act 1980 ss 2 and 5. But under s 11, the period is three years for personal injury or death, under s 11A ten years for defective products, and under s 15 twelve years to recover land. Almost any public body, or private bodies exercising public functions,R (Datafin) v Panel on Takeovers and Mergers [1987] QB 815 can be the target of judicial review, including a government department, a local council, any Minister, the Prime Minister, or any other body that is created by law. The only public body whose decisions cannot be reviewed is Parliament, when it passes an Act. Otherwise, a claimant can argue that a public body's decision was unlawful in five main types of case:Different books and cases categorise the grounds to review administrative discretion differently, as do different fields of law such as directors' duties in UK company law, unfair dismissal in UK labour law or implied terms in English contract law. Lord Diplock in the GCHQ case said the grounds were \\"illegality\\", \\"irrationality\\" and \\"procedural impropriety\\". A Le Sueur, M Sunkin and J Murkens, Public Law Text, Cases, and Materials (3rd edn 2016) ch 16 follows this. It is often, however, unclear how a procedural requirement of the law can be separated from substance, and it was thought that \\"irrationality\\" is too restrictive. AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2014) ch 24 now suggests substantive grounds, legitimate expectations and procedural grounds. In R (Baker) v Devon CC [1995] 1 All ER 73, 88, Sir Robin Cooke said \\"The administrator must act fairly, reasonably and according to law. That is the essence and the rest is mainly machinery.\\" M Elliott and R Thomas, Public Law (3rd edn 2017) ch 12 generally follows this. Another categorisation of Lord Bingham, Rule of Law (2010), was \\"Ministers and public officers at all levels must exercise the powers conferred on them in good faith, fairly, for the purposes for which the powers were conferred, without exceeding the limits of such powers and not unreasonably.\\" Contrast the Companies Act 2006 ss 171-177, codifying directors' duties. # it exceeded the lawful power of the body, used its power for an improper purpose, or acted unreasonably,Ridge v Baldwin [1964] AC 40 (following law). Padfield v Minister of Agriculture [1968] AC 997 (improper purpose), R v Home Secretary ex p Venables and Thompson [1998] AC 407 (irrelevant consideration). # it violated a legitimate expectation,Associated Provincial Picture Houses v Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB 223 (unreasonableness loosely defined); Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service [1985] AC 374 (legitimate expectation rejected). R v North and East Devon Health Authority, ex p Coughlan [2001] QB 213 (legitimate expectation upheld) # it failed to exercise relevant and independent judgement,R (Corner House Research) v Director of the Serious Fraud Office [2008] UKHL 60 (independent judgement) # it exhibited bias or a conflict of interest, or failed to give a fair hearing,Porter v Magill [2001] UKHL 67 (bias). R v Bow Street Stipendiary Magistrate, ex p Pinochet (No 2) [2000] 1 AC 119 (possibility of a conflict of interest). and # it violated a human right.Human Rights Act 1998 ss 3–6 As a remedy, a claimant can ask for the public body's decisions to be declared void and quashed (via a quashing order), or it could ask for an order to make the body do something (via a mandatory order), or prevent the body from acting unlawfully (via a prohibiting order). A court may also declare the parties' rights and duties, give an injunction, or compensation could also be payable in tort or contract.Senior Courts Act 1981 s 31(1) Substantive judicial review Applications for judicial review are generally divided into claims about the 'substance' of a public body's decision, and claims about the 'procedure' of a decision, although the two overlap, and there is not yet a codified set of grounds as is found in other countries or in other fields of law.In Germany, see the Administrative Procedure Act 1976, Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz 1976, or in UK company law see the Companies Act 2006 ss 170-177 and 260-263. First, a claimant may allege that a public body's decision was outside the 'letter and spirit of the law': that an act was ultra vires or did not follow the 'proper purpose' for which the public body's powers were conferred. For example, in R (McCarthy and Stone Ltd) v Richmond Council the House of Lords held that Richmond Council had no statutory power to charge residents a £25 fee to consult its planning officers, because deciding planning permission was a statutory duty, and no charge can be levied by a public body without clear statutory authority.[1992] 2 AC 48 Similarly, in Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC the House of Lords held that the council acted beyond its powers in the Local Government Act 1972 by entering interest rate swaps transactions, a functional equivalent of borrowing money, which was limited by statute.Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC [1992] 2 AC 1 The courts particularly guard against the executive's attempt to overreach its power. In Ahmed v HM Treasury the Supreme Court held that the United Nations Act 1946 section 1 did not confer on the Prime Minister the right to pass two orders that froze or seized funds of people designed by the UN Security Council as suspected terrorists without any possibility for review. The Act could not have left the definition of what was 'necessary' or 'expedient' to the uncontrolled judgement of the Prime Minister, which affected the rights of citizens without the clear authority of Parliament.[2010] UKSC 2 A public body may also act unlawfully by misinterpreting its own powers. In Anisminic Ltd v Foreign Compensation Commission the House of Lords held that the Foreign Compensation Commission (a body to compensate British persons who lost property when Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the Suez canal during the Suez crisis of 1956) made an error of law by interpreting its powers narrowly. The FCC thought an Order in Council about its powers, which excluded claims by anyone whose 'successor in title' was not a British company, applied to Anisminic Ltd, whose assets were acquired by an Egyptian company after 1956. But the House of Lords held that the Egyptian company was not Anisminic Ltd's 'successor' in title, that the FCC had therefore taken an irrelevant factor into account (its own error of law) in denying a claim, and that the decision had to be a nullity. It was also not possible for an ouster clause in the Act, saying nothing should question the FCC's decisions, to prevent judicial review.[1969] 2 AC 147 right Determining the legality of a public body's action also extends to the purpose and therefore the policy objectives behind the legislation. In Padfield v Minister of Agriculture milk producers successfully argued that the Minister for Agriculture had wrongly exercised his power in the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 section 19 by not raising subsidies for milk when transport costs changed. The country was divided into eleven milk regions, with different milk prices based on estimates of how much it cost to transport milk. The House of Lords held the Minister was wrong to refuse an investigation into milk price disparities because this frustrated a central policy of the Act: to ensure fair milk subsidies were paid, taking into account costs of production.[1968] AC 997, upholding Lord Denning MR's dissent in the Court of Appeal. If public bodies take into account factors outside those necessary for exercising their judgment, a decision will also be quashed. So in R v Home Secretary ex parte Venables and Thompson the House of Lords held that the Home Secretary (Michael Howard) unlawfully took into account the irrelevant consideration of a petition organised by The Sun newspaper to not allow two men release from prison. Instead he should have taken into account the prisoners' progress during detention.[1998] AC 407 In the best known case, Associated Provincial Picture Houses v Wednesbury Corporation, a cinema claimed that the council's requirement that it stop admitting children aged under 15 on Sundays after a local poll was unreasonable. The Court of Appeal (in 1948) held that this was not an unreasonable, irrational or absurd condition and therefore lawful.[1948] 1 KB 223 Lord Greene MR said that the different grounds of judicial review (including an error of law, regarding only relevant considerations, and absurd decisions) all 'run into one another', but that as a general concept a decision would only be unlawful if 'no sensible person could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority'.Contrast in company law Re Smith and Fawcett Ltd [1942] Ch 304, per Lord Greene MR One established ground by which decisions will automatically be unreasonable is if they have a discriminatory impact, violating the principle of equality. In Kruse v Johnson, Lord Russell CJ held that if a public body's actions 'were found to be partial and unequal in their operation as between different classes' it would be unreasonable and ultra vires.[1898] 2 QB 91, 98-100, '... unreasonable in what sense? If, for instance, they were found to be partial and unequal in their operation as between different classes; if they were manifestly unjust; if they disclosed bad faith; if they involved such oppressive or gratuitous interference with the rights of those subject to them as could find no justification in the minds of reasonable men, the Court might well say, “Parliament never intended to give authority to make such rules; they are unreasonable and ultra vires.”' here a council's bylaw prohibited playing music or singing within 50 years of a public house or highway, but this was held to be valid. However, this test of \\"Wednesbury unreasonableness\\" has been repeatedly criticised as having little principled meaning, unless it is coupled with the purpose or policy of the law.eg R (Daly) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] UKHL 26, per Lord Cooke, ‘an unfortunately retrogressive decision’ because it ‘suggested that there are degrees of unreasonableness and that only a very extreme degree can bring an administrative decision within the legitimate scope of judicial invalidation’. The 'proportionality' test has been increasingly favoured, and sometimes said to reach similar outcomes.R (Alconbury Developments Ltd) v SS for Environment, Transport and the Regions [2001] UKHL 23, [51]. R (Daly) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] UKHL 26, [27]-28] per Lord Steyn. The proportionality test asks whether a public body's act has a legitimate aim, and then is appropriate, necessary, and reasonably balances individual and social interests, in achieving that aim.Huang v Home Secretary [2007] UKSC 11, [13]-[22] per Lord Bingham This test is routinely used in human rights, discrimination law, and trade law reasoning. The second major group of cases concern claims that a public body defeated an applicant's 'legitimate expectations'. This is similar to a contract (without the need for consideration) or estoppel, so that if a public body promises or assures somebody something, but does not deliver, they will be able to claim a 'legitimate expectation' was defeated.Contrast Crabb v Arun DC [1975] EWCA Civ 7 and O'Neill v Phillips [1999] UKHL 24 For example, in R v North and East Devon Health Authority, ex p Coughlan, Miss Coughlan claimed that she should be able to remain in social housing, a care home for people with severe disabilities after the health authority had assured her it was a 'home for life'. Coughlan had become tetraplegic after a severe road accident. The Court of Appeal held that it would be an abuse of power, breaking the assurance was 'equivalent to a breach of contract in private law', and it 'was unfair because it frustrated her legitimate expectation of having a home for life'.[2001] QB 213 By contrast, in Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service the House of Lords held that the trade union at GCHQ had been given the assurance through the 'existence of a regular practice' that the employer would negotiate over a fair pay scale. However, Margaret Thatcher's decision to stop negotiation through an Order in Council on pay was justified (ostensibly) on grounds of 'national security'. On this point, and while the prerogative was also subject to judicial review, security was 'par excellence a non-justiciable question', their Lordships saying they were 'totally inept to deal with the sort of problems which it involves.'[1985] AC 374 This has been criticised on the basis that the courts should have required reasons as to why workers bargaining for fair pay threatened national security. A third group of cases concern a failure of a public body to exercise independent judgement,cf R (Corner House Research) v Director of the Serious Fraud Office [2008] UKHL 60 held that taking into account a threat of the Saudi Arabia government to not investigate allegations of fraud was lawful on the fact. for instance by fettering their discretion. In British Oxygen Co Ltd v Minister of Technology the Minister had a rule in handing out capital grants to firms that it would not fund claims under £25. An oxygen cylinder company claimed it should receive the grants it has spent £4m on gas cylinders: they unfortunately just cost £20 each. The House of Lords held that while a government department was entitled to make a rule or policy in exercising its discretion, it must be 'always willing to listen to anyone with something new to say' and to make an exception,[1971] AC 610 a principle akin to equity (mitigating strict legal rules) in administrative law. Procedural review As well as reviewing the substance of a decision, judicial review has developed to ensure that public bodies follow lawful and just procedures in making all decisions. First, like the substance of a decision may go beyond the powers of a public body, a procedure actually followed by a public official may not follow what was required by law. In Ridge v Baldwin a chief constable was summarily dismissed by a Brighton police committee, even though the disciplinary regulations made under the Police Act 1919 required an inquiry into charges against someone before they were dismissed. The House of Lords held the regulations applied, and should have been followed, so the dismissal was ultra vires. But in addition, basic principles of natural justice required the constable should have had a hearing before being dismissed. According to Lord Hodson, the ‘irreducible minimum’ of natural justice is (1) the right to decision by an unbiased tribunal, (2) notice of any charges, and (3) a right to be heard.[1964] AC 40 The same principles with regard to dismissal have been applied to a wide range of public servants, while the law of unfair dismissal and the common law quickly developed to protect the same right to job security.See Wilson v Racher [1974] ICR 428, Employment Rights Act 1996 s 94, and Chhabra v West London Mental Health NHS Trust [2013] UKSC 80 right If statutes are silent, the courts readily apply principles of natural justice, to ensure there is no bias and a fair hearing. These common law principles are reinforced by the European Convention on Human Rights article 6, which in determining anyone’s ‘civil rights and obligations’,cf Tomlinson v Birmingham CC [2010] UKSC 8, applicants who argued they had a right to homeless accommodation under the Housing Act 1996 s 193(5), and never received letters rejecting them, had violated the right to a fair trial in determination of their 'civil rights' in ECHR article 6. The Supreme Court held that no 'civil rights' were at stake because benefits in kind were not a right that an applicant held, rather than a right that depended upon a public body's evaluation. or ‘any criminal charge’, requires ‘a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.’ The rule against bias includes, for example, not allowing a judge to sit on any case in which he is financially interested, such as being a shareholder in a company that is a litigant.Dimes v Grand Junction Canal (1852) 3 HLC 759, the parties may, however, consent. Also R v Mulvihill [1990] 1 WLR 438, and contrast a controversial decision in R (United Cabbies Group (London) Ltd) v Westminster Magistrates' Court [2019] EWHC 409 (Admin) finding that a judge's husband doing consulting work for a firm, which had Uber as a client, posed no actual or potential conflict of interest. This rule, which reflects a principle of equity that there must be no possibility of a conflict of interest,See Keech v Sandford EWHC Ch J76 following the disgrace of Lord Macclesfield in the South Sea Bubble. was applied in R v Bow Street Stipendiary Magistrate, ex p Pinochet (No 2) after the ex-dictator General Pinochet had been ordered by the House of Lords to be extradited to Chile to stand criminal trial. The charity, Amnesty International had argued in the appeal to support extradition, and Lord Hoffmann had not disclosed that he was a director of the charity. The House of Lords, after a complaint, held that its decision could not stand and had to be heard again. According to Lord Nolan, even if there was no actual bias or conflict, ‘in any case where the impartiality of a judge is in question the appearance of the matter is just as important as the reality.’[2000] 1 AC 119, 139 Justice ‘should not only be done but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done’.R (McCarthy) v Sussex Justices [1924] 1 KB 256, per Lord Hewart Where conflicts of interest taint any public body’s decision, they may be quashed. In Porter v Magill the Conservative majority in Westminster City Council had a policy of selling off council houses in parts of the city where they believed new owners would be more likely to vote conservative. For this reason, the House of Lords held that the councillors had exercised their powers for improper purposes, and were motivated by bias.[2001] UKHL 67 The requirements of a fair hearing are that each side knows the case against them,Dr Bentley’s Case (1723) 1 Stra 557, the right to know charges against you, and a right to reply, used in a university. can present their version of the facts, makes submissions on the rules of law, comments on material considered by the judge, and does not communicate with the judge without the other having the same opportunity. For instance, in Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works, Mr Cooper failed to notify his intention to build a house. The Board of Works decided to demolish the house without giving him any hearing. Byles J held that although ‘there are no positive words in a statute requiring that the party shall be heard, yet the justice of the common law shall supply the omission of the legislature.’(1863) 14 CBNS 180 The right to know any case against you was illustrated in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex p Doody, where prisoners who received life sentences were told a minimum period they had to stay in prison before any review, but not the judiciary’s recommendations. The House of Lords held that they had to be able to know the recommended period, and to be able to make representations, before any time was fixed.[1994] 1 AC 531 Often, although there is no hard right to them, a failure to give reasons for a decision will be regarded as unfair,[1994] 1 AC 531, 564-5, per Lord Mustill, ‘The giving of reasons may be inconvenient, but I can see no grounds at all why it should be against the public interest: indeed, rather the reverse. That being so, I would ask simply: Is refusal to give reasons fair? I would answer without hesitation that it is not. because giving reasons ‘is one of the fundamentals of good administration’.Breen v AEU [1971] 2 QB 175, 191, Lord Denning MR. In all cases where human rights are at stake, the standards are higher.eg Hadjianastassiou v Greece (1992) 16 EHRR 219. Human rights review Like the common law grounds (that public bodies must act within lawful power, uphold legitimate expectations, and natural justice), human rights violations are a major ground for judicial review. Since World War Two, the Holocaust, and the end of the British Empire, ensuring compatibility between international human rights and UK law has generally been considered a binding duty of the courts,e.g. Seaford Court Estates Ltd v Asher [1949] 2 KB 481, 498-499, Denning LJ, a judge ‘must set to work on the constructive task of finding the intention of Parliament, and he must do this not only from the language of the statute, but also from a consideration of the social conditions which gave rise to it, and of the mischief which it was passed to remedy, and then he must supplement the written word so as to give “force and life” to the intention of the legislature.’ Ahmad v Inner London Education Authority [1978] QB 38, Lord Denning MR, 'The convention is not part of our English law, but, as I have often said, we will always have regard to it. We will do our best to see that our decisions are in conformity with it.' Congreve v Home Office [1976] QB 69 (need for judiciary to control any executive's abuse of power). 'The convention is not part of our English law, but, as I have often said, we will always have regard to it. We will do our best to see that our decisions are in conformity with it.' but it was only since the Human Rights Act 1998 that the courts have had structured, statutory guidance for how to do this. The Supreme Court has, at least since 2014, adopted a practice of giving indirect effect to international law, to which the UK has acceded through binding treaties.e.g. Hounga v Allen [2014] UKSC 47, interpreting the common law illegality doctrine according to the Palermo Protocol. FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC [2014] UKSC 45, [42] referring to the United Nations Convention against Corruption 2003 in interpreting remedies for breach of fiduciary duty. The Christian Institute v Lord Advocate [2016] UKSC 51, [72]-[73], ' As is well known, it is proper to look to international instruments... as aids to the interpretation of the ECHR', going on to examine the UNCRC, the UDHR and the ICCPR. cf R (SG) v SS for Work and Pensions [2015] UKSC 16, Lord Kerr, dissenting, at [247]-[257] arguing the dualist theory of international law should be abandoned, and international law should be directly effective in UK law. The post-war 'international Magna Carta', the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 was expanded into two human rights Conventions, ratified by the UK, in 1966: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Within Europe, the UK was a founding signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights 1950 and the European Social Charter 1961. These documents were not also written into UK statute, because it was generally thought that the ordinary mechanisms of judicial review were sufficient. However, to establish a violation of the Convention, claimants had to exhaust the judicial process within the UK before making another application to the Strasbourg court system, and there was no guarantee that UK courts would explicitly engage with human rights reasoning in their decisions. The Human Rights Act 1998 was eventually passed to 'bring rights home' in order to make the judicial process quicker, and to ensure greater influence by the UK judiciary in formulating what human rights meant. Under the Human Rights Act 1998 section 3, courts have a duty to interpret legislation so 'far as it is possible to do so' to be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.Human Rights Act 1998 s 3 and Sch 1 lists provisions of the ECHR to be followed. This is a strong duty, and courts must, if a compatible interpretation is possible, use it because the Act presumes Parliament cannot have intended to violate international human rights law. For instance, in Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza an applicant argued that he should have the right to succeed in title to a flat of his recently deceased homosexual, because the Rent Act 1977 said there was a right of succession if two people lived together 'as his or her wife or husband'.Rent Act 1977 Sch 1, para 2(2) The landlord argued this did not apply, because Godin-Mendoza was gay. This was clearly discriminatory in violation of ECHR article 14, and also an interference in the right to private life and one's home under ECHR article 8. The House of Lords held they could interpret the Act compatibly with the right to equal treatment and one's home, by reading the Rent Act 1977 like it said that they lived together 'as if they were his wife or husband'.[2004] UKHL 30, [50] per Lord Steyn. If a compatible interpretation is impossible, a court must under section 4 issue a 'declaration of incompatibility', a (rare) notice to Parliament that the law does not match the Convention and should be changed. Parliament has always, since it was written in 1950, ultimately upheld the Convention. Under section 10(2) a Minister may if 'there are compelling reasons' amend legislation to remove the inconsistency, although Parliament often passes a new Act.HRA 1998 s 10(2) For instance, in Bellinger v Bellinger a transsexual woman, Elizabeth, married a man called Michael and sought a declaration that this was a lawful marriage under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 section 11, which described marriage as being between a 'male' and a 'female'. The judge refused because Elizabeth was classified as male at her birth, and the House of Lords held that, despite being 'profoundly conscious of the humanitarian considerations underlying Mrs Bellinger's claim', they could not interpret the statute compatibly (to give the word 'woman' a non-biological meaning), and so they instead issued a declaration of incompatibility.[2003] UKHL 21. See also, R (Wright) v Secretary of State for Health [2009] UKHL 3, [39] per Baroness Hale, ‘It is not for us to attempt to rewrite the legislation.’ Here a nurse could not be suspended under the Care Standards Act 2000 s 82(4) without a hearing compatibly with ECHR article 6, leading to a declaration of incompatibility. Parliament soon amended the law in the Gender Recognition Act 2004. Section 6 requires all public bodies to act compatibly with the Convention, and this includes courts in developing common law and equity. Section 8 enables the courts to give any 'relief or remedy' that is 'just and appropriate'.HRA 1998 s 8 Despite indirect effect, there is not yet direct effect codified in statute for important economic and social rights, such as the right to work, fair pay, increased leisure time, and social security.eg in the European Social Charter 1961 and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1966 A central difference between judicial review based on human rights, and judicial review based on common law ground that a decision is \\"Wednesbury unreasonable\\" and ultra vires, is that infringements of rights can only be defended if the infringement is 'proportionate'. If the infringement is disproportionate, the right is violated. The proportionality test requires the court to ask, first, if the public body had a legitimate aim. For most rights, the legitimate aims are set out in sub-article 2, such as infringements for the purpose of national security, health, morals, or the rights of others. Second, the court asks whether the public body's conduct was 'appropriate' or 'suitable' to achieve the aim. Third, it asks if the public body's conduct was 'necessary', and particularly whether it could have taken an alternative course of action that would not have interfered with the applicant's human rights. For instance, in R (Daly) v Secretary of State for the Home Department the House of Lords held that searches of a prisoner's cells which contained legally privileged correspondence with the prisoner's solicitor went further than necessary to achieve the aim of maintaining security and preventing crime, because it was a blanket policy that could be tailored to individual prisoners' circumstances, depending on whether they had been disruptive, a result the same as the common law.[2001] UKHL 26, [18]-[19] and [23] per Lord Bingham. Fourth, the court asks whether the action was 'reasonable' in striking a balance between the interests of the individual and society.Huang v Home Secretary [2007] UKSC 11, [19] noting that proportionality analysis involves 'the need to balance the interests of society with those of individuals and groups... [and] should never be overlooked or discounted'. If anything is lacking, if there is no legitimate aim, or the public body's actions are not appropriate, necessary, and reasonable, its actions will be disproportionate and violate the applicant's right. Standing and remedies Judicial review applications are more limited than other forms of legal claims, particularly those in contract, tort, unjust enrichment or criminal law, although these may be available against public bodies as well. Judicial review applications must be brought promptly, by people with a 'sufficient interest' and only against persons exercising public functions. First, unlike the typical limitation period of six years in contract or tort,Limitation Act 1980 ss 2 and 4 the Civil Procedure Rules, rule 54.5 requires that judicial review applications must be made within 'three months after the grounds to make the claim first arose'.Civil Procedure Rules, rule 54.5(1)(b). This was six months before 1977. See further R (Burkett) v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC [2002] UKHL 23 time begins running when a formal decision is made by a public body, not when such a body resolves to make a decision. cf R (Wilson) v Prime Minister [2019] EWCA Civ 304 (on time to bring a claim where conduct is concealed and fraudulent). Often, however, the same set of facts could be seen as giving rise to concurrent claims for judicial review. In O'Reilly v Mackman prisoners claimed that a prison breached rules of natural justice in deciding they lost the right to remission after a riot. The House of Lords held that, because they had no remedy in 'private law' by itself, and there was merely a 'legitimate expectation' that the prison's statutory obligations would be fulfilled, only a claim for judicial review could be brought, and the three month time limit had expired. It was an abuse of process to attempt a claim in tort for breach of statutory duty.[1983] UKHL 1, [1983] 2 AC 237 Second, according to the Senior Courts Act 1981 section 31 an applicant must have a 'sufficient interest' to bring a case.Senior Courts Act 1981 s 31 In R (National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd) v Inland Revenue Commissioners a taxpayer group (the NFSE) claimed that the Revenue should collect tax from 6000 casual Fleet Street newspaper workers, after they had decided to end a practice of tax evasion over many years by collecting for a previous two years and not investigate earlier infringements. The House of Lords held the NFSE did not have a sufficient interest in the issue because this would interfere with the Revenue's general management powers.[1982] AC 617, 633 It was also held that a theatre preservation group had no standing to review a minister's decision refusing to designate a site as an historic monument.R v Secretary of State for the Environment, ex p Rose Theatre Trust Co Ltd [1990] 1 QB 504 On the other hand, it has been consistently recognised that public interest groups have standing to challenge decisions of public bodies, such as a respected and expert environmental group over pollution concerns,R v Inspectorate of Pollution, ex p Greenpeace Ltd (No 2) [1994] 4 All ER 329, Otton J, classing 'the applicants as eminently respectable and responsible in their genuine interest in the issues raised', and referring to the fact that if Greenpeace were denied standing, a less organised group could claim which could stretch a court's resources. a development campaign group over excessive spending in an international dam project,R v Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, ex p World Development Movement [1995] 1 WLR 386 and the government equality watchdog, the Equal Opportunities Commission, for whether UK legislation complied with EU law on redundancy protection.R (Equal Opportunities Commission) v Secretary of State for Employment [1995] 1 AC 1 Occasionally, the government has attempted to exclude judicial review through putting an ouster clause in an Act, providing that a public body's decisions should not be 'called into question'. However, in R (Privacy International) v Investigatory Powers Tribunal the Supreme Court suggested that ouster clauses cannot restrict the right to judicial review without the most express words, because of a strong common law presumption that Parliament intends for public bodies to act lawfully and within their jurisdiction.[2019] UKSC 22, Lord Carnwath, Lady Hale, Lord Kerr, Lord Lloyd-Jones holding that ouster clause applied only to a legally valid decision relating to jurisdiction. Lord Sumption, Lord Reed, Lord Wilson dissented. See also R (Cart) v The Upper Tribunal [2011] UKSC 28. A third issue is which bodies are subject to judicial review. This clearly includes any government department, minister, council, or entity set up under a statute to fulfil public functions. However, the division between 'public' and 'private' bodies has become increasingly blurred as more regulatory and public actions have been outsourced to private entities. In R (Datafin plc) v Panel on Take-overs and Mergers the Court of Appeal held that the Takeover Panel, a private association organised by companies and financial institutions in the City of London to enforce standards in takeover bids, was subject to judicial review because it exercised 'immense power de facto by devising, promulgating, amending and interpreting the City Code' with 'sanctions are no less effective because they are applied indirectly and lack a legally enforceable base'.[1987] QB 815 By contrast, the Jockey Club was not thought to exercise sufficient power to be subject to judicial review.R v Disciplinary Committee of the Jockey Club, ex p Aga Khan [1992] EWCA Civ 7, [1993] 1 WLR 909 Nor was the Aston Cantlow Parochial Church Council, because although a public authority, it was not a 'core' public authority with any significant regulatory function.Aston Cantlow Parochial Church Council v Wallbank [2003] UKHL 37 In a controversial decision, YL v Birmingham CC held that a large private corporation called Southern Cross was not a public authority subject to judicial review, even though it was contracted by the council to run most nursing homes in Birmingham.[2007] UKHL 27. YL claimed the company violated her right to a home under ECHR article 8 by giving her just 28 days notice to leave after a disagreement. This decision was immediately reversed by statute,Health and Social Care Act 2008 s 145 and in R (Weaver) v London and Quadrant Housing Trust the Court of Appeal held that a housing trust, supported by government subsidies, could be subject to judicial review for unjust termination of a tenancy.[2009] EWCA Civ 587, per Elias LJ. Finally, the Supreme Court Act 1981 section 31 sets out the main remedies available through judicial review: a mandatory order (previously called mandamus) to make a public body do something, a prohibiting order (prohibition) to stop a public body doing something, a quashing order (certiorari) to cancel an act, an injunction, or a declaration. The old writ of habeas corpus also remains available, to require that a person be delivered to court and freed.See R (Khawaja) v Home Secretary [1984] AC 74 and Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs v Rahmatullah [2012] UKSC 48 Further, in contract, tort or unjust enrichment claims against public bodies, the courts may order standard remedies of compensation for loss, restitution of gains, or an award of specific performance. In Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v Evans, however, the House of Lords held that although a police officer was unlawfully dismissed in violation of statute, compensatory damages were a more appropriate remedy than a mandatory order for reinstatement given the rarity (at the time) of specific performance in employment contracts.[1982] 1 WLR 1155 Occasionally the law makes provision for special privileges or immunities of public bodies from the ordinary law, but these are generally construed restrictively.cf Duncan v Cammell Laird & Co [1942] AC 624 See also *English contract law *English trusts law *English land law *English tort law *English criminal law *European Union law *UK enterprise law *UK labour law *UK company law Explanatory notes Notes References ;Articles *V Bogdanor, T Khaitan and S Vogenauer, 'Should Britain have a written constitution?'

The outer optimization task is commonly referred to as the upper-level optimization task, and the inner optimization task is commonly referred to as the lower-level optimization task. These problems involve two kinds of variables, referred to as the upper-level variables and the lower-level variables.  Mathematical formulation of the problem  A general formulation of the bilevel optimization problem can be written as follows: \\\\min\\\\limits_{x \\\\in X, y \\\\in Y}\\\\;\\\\; F(x,y) subject to: G_i(x,y) \\\\leq 0, for i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ 1,2,\\\\ldots ,I \\\\\\\\}; y \\\\in \\\\arg \\\\min \\\\limits_{z \\\\in Y} \\\\\\\\{ f(x,z) : g_{j}(x,z) \\\\leq 0, j \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ 1,2,\\\\ldots,J \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\} where : F,f: R^{n_x} \\\\times R^{n_y} \\\\to R : G_i,g_j: R^{n_x} \\\\times R^{n_y} \\\\to R : X \\\\subseteq R^{n_x} : Y \\\\subseteq R^{n_y}. In the above formulation, F represents the upper-level objective function and f represents the lower-level objective function. Similarly x represents the upper-level decision vector and y represents the lower-level decision vector. G_i and g_j represent the inequality constraint functions at the upper and lower levels respectively. If some objective function is to be maximized, it is equivalent to minimize its negative. The formulation above is also capable of representing equality constraints, as these can be easily rewritten in terms of inequality constraints: for instance, h(x)=0 can be translated as \\\\\\\\{h(x)\\\\leq 0,\\\\ -h(x)\\\\leq 0\\\\\\\\}. However, it is usually worthwhile to treat equality constraints separately, to deal with them more efficiently in a dedicated way; in the representation above, they have been omitted for brevity.  Stackelberg competition  Bilevel optimization was first realized in the field of game theory by a German economist Heinrich Freiherr von Stackelberg who published Market Structure and Equilibrium (Marktform und Gleichgewicht) in 1934 that described this hierarchical problem. The strategic game described in his book came to be known as Stackelberg game that consists of a leader and a follower. The leader is commonly referred as a Stackelberg leader and the follower is commonly referred as a Stackelberg follower. In a Stackelberg game, the players of the game compete with each other, such that the leader makes the first move, and then the follower reacts optimally to the leader's action. This kind of a hierarchical game is asymmetric in nature, where the leader and the follower can not be interchanged. The leader knows ex ante that the follower observes its actions before responding in an optimal manner. Therefore, if the leader wants to optimize its objective, then it needs to anticipate the optimal response of the follower. In this setting, the leader's optimization problem contains a nested optimization task that corresponds to the follower's optimization problem. In the Stackelberg games, the upper level optimization problem is commonly referred as the leader's problem and the lower level optimization problem is commonly referred as the follower's problem.  Applications  Bilevel optimization problems are commonly found in a number of real-world problems. This includes problems in the domain of transportation, economics, decision science, business, engineering, environmental economics etc. Some of the practical bilevel problems studied in the literature are briefly discussed. Toll setting problem In the field of transportation, bilevel optimization commonly appears in the toll-setting problem. Consider a network of highways that is operated by the government. The government wants to maximize its revenues by choosing the optimal toll setting for the highways. However, the government can maximize its revenues only by taking the highway users' problem into account. For any given tax structure the highway users solve their own optimization problem, where they minimize their traveling costs by deciding between utilizing the highways or an alternative route. Under these circumstances, the government's problem needs to be formulated as a bilevel optimization problem. The upper level consists of the governments objectives and constraints, and the lower level consists of the highway users' objectives and constraints for a given tax structure. It is noteworthy that the government will be able to identify the revenue generated by a particular tax structure only by solving the lower level problem that determines to what extent the highways are used. Structural optimization Structural optimization problems consist of two levels of optimization task and are commonly referred as mathematical programming problems with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). The upper level objective in such problems may involve cost minimization or weight minimization subject to bounds on displacements, stresses and contact forces. The decision variables at the upper level usually are shape of the structure, choice of materials, amount of material etc. However, for any given set of upper level variables, the state variables (displacement, stresses and contact forces) can only be figured out by solving the potential energy minimization problem that appears as an equilibrium satisfaction constraint or lower level minimization task to the upper level problem. Defense applications Bilevel optimization has a number of applications in defense, like strategic offensive and defensive force structure design, strategic bomber force structure, and allocation of tactical aircraft to missions. The offensive entity in this case may be considered a leader and the defensive entity in this case may be considered a follower. If the leader wants to maximize the damage caused to the opponent, then it can only be achieved if the leader takes the reactions of the follower into account. A rational follower will always react optimally to the leaders offensive. Therefore, the leader's problem appears as an upper level optimization task, and the optimal response of the follower to the leader's actions is determined by solving the lower level optimization task.  Solution methodologies  Bilevel optimization problems are hard to solve. One solution method is to reformulate bilevel optimization problems to optimization problems for which robust solution algorithms are available. Extended Mathematical Programming (EMP) is an extension to mathematical programming languages that provides several keywords for bilevel optimization problems. These annotations facilitate the automatic reformulation to Mathematical Programs with Equilibrium Constraints (MPECs) for which mature solver technology exists. EMP is available within GAMS.  Evolutionary bilevel optimization  For complex bilevel problems, classical methods fail due to difficulties like non-linearity, discreteness, non- differentiability, non-convexity etc. In such situations, evolutionary methods, though computationally demanding, could be an alternative tool to offset some of these difficulties and lead to an approximate optimal solution. Multi-objective bilevel optimization A bilevel optimization problem can be generalized to a multi-objective bilevel optimization problem with multiple objectives at one or both levels. A general multi-objective bilevel optimization problem can be formulated as follows: \\\\min\\\\limits_{x \\\\in X, y \\\\in Y}\\\\;\\\\; F(x,y) = ( F_{1} (x,y),F_{2} (x,y),\\\\ldots,F_{p} (x,y) ) In the Stackelberg games: Leader problem subject to: G_i(x,y) \\\\leq 0, for i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ 1,2,\\\\ldots,I \\\\\\\\}; y \\\\in \\\\arg \\\\min \\\\limits_{z \\\\in Y} \\\\\\\\{ f(x,z) = ( f_1 (x,z),f_2 (x,z),\\\\ldots,f_q (x,z) ) : g_{j}(x,z) \\\\leq 0, j \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ 1,2,\\\\ldots,J \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\} In the Stackelberg games: Follower problem where : F: R^{n_x} \\\\times R^{n_y} \\\\to R^{p} : f: R^{n_x} \\\\times R^{n_y} \\\\to R^{q} : G_i,g_j: R^{n_x} \\\\times R^{n_y} \\\\to R : X \\\\subseteq R^{n_x} : Y \\\\subseteq R^{n_y}. In the above formulation, F represents the upper-level objective vector with p objectives and f represents the lower-level objective vector with q objectives. Similarly, x represents the upper-level decision vector and y represents the lower-level decision vector. G_i and g_j represent the inequality constraint functions at the upper and lower levels respectively. Equality constraints may also be present in a bilevel program, but they have been omitted for brevity.

It was killed by Kenneth Anderson, who described it in his memoirs Man-Eaters and Jungle Killers: The reasons given to explain the Mysore sloth bear's unusual behaviour varied. Some of the natives within the bear's killing range thought that the bear was a sow taking revenge on humanity after her cubs were stolen. Others thought that it was a male which had previously abducted a young girl as its mate, only to have her rescued by the villagers, thus inciting the bear's anger. Kenneth Anderson believed that the bear had previously been injured by humans and altered its behaviour accordingly. First attacks A sloth bear in the Frankfurt Zoo showing its claws The bear began its attacks in the Nagvara Hills, east to the town of Arsikere, 105 miles north-west of Bangalore in Mysore State. It made its home in the numerous boulder strewn hillocks, from whence it would come down to forage in the fields. As its boldness increased, it began harassing people in both daylight and night-time hours. In typical sloth bear fashion, the animal attacked its victims' faces with its claws and teeth. Those who survived its attacks usually lost one or both eyes, some their noses while others had their cheeks bitten through. Those who died often had their faces completely torn from their heads. At least three of the victims had been partially eaten. First hunt for the bear The bear's depredations first came to the attention of Kenneth Anderson when an aged Muslim friend of his named Alam Bux sent him a postcard, urgently asking him to come to his home, a shrine situated between Arsikere and Shimoga. Bux's 22-year-old son had been fatally mauled by the bear at 9:00 p.m., having unintentionally disturbed it while it was feeding on fallen figs. Anticipating an easy hunt, Anderson did not come prepared for a long trip, having brought with him for the hunt just an electric torch, a .405 Winchester rifle, and a single change of clothes. Arriving at the shrine early in the evening, Anderson planned to wait until darkness to shoot the bear. Starting his search near fig trees, Anderson walked for a mile and a half without spotting the bear. He then unsuccessfully searched groundnut fields before finally returning to the shrine. Anderson made two subsequent tours during the course of the night, both of which proved unsuccessful. At noon the next day, Anderson was taken to the mouth of what was thought to be the bear's cave. After throwing stones into the crevice with no results, Anderson returned to Bangalore, asking Bux to inform him by telegram should the bear attack again. Second hunt for the bear One month later, two woodcutters in Sakrepatna, a small town between Chikmagalur and Kadur, were seriously mauled by the bear, one fatally. Anderson was contacted by the District Forest Officer of Chikmagalur who requested that Anderson come and shoot the bear. Anderson requested precise coordinates for the bear's whereabouts, and was answered ten days later that the bear lived in a hillock three miles from the town, near a footpath leading to a lake called the Ionkere. It was also revealed that the bear had since mauled the Forest Guard during a regular patrol. Anderson left for Chikmagalur and set up his headquarters in a small house owned by the Mysore Forest Department. At 4:30 the next afternoon, a man rushed to the bungalow, stating that the bear had mauled his brother, a cattle grazer near the hill where the bear allegedly had his lair. Setting forth with a rifle, a torch and three or four helpers, Anderson journeyed six miles into the jungle for an hour and a half before coming across a heavily scrubbed hill. The helpers refused to accompany him any further, and Anderson followed the general directions given by the victim's brother of the attack's location. After searching for a while through the thick brush, Anderson heard the faint moans of the victim, whom he found lying at the foot of a tree, unconscious and severely mutilated. Realising that the man was dying, Anderson carried him for a short distance, before spraining his ankle and collapsing. The victim died at 5 in the morning, and Anderson was found later by Forest officials and a dozen villagers. He was hospitalised at Chikmagalur for a week before resuming the hunt. Third hunt for the bear During Anderson's absence, the bear had mauled two men along the path of Ionkere Lake. Anderson arrived at Sakrepatna where he was told that the bear had taken to visiting some fields bordered by Boram trees a mile from the village. Anderson arrived at the site at 5:00 pm and spent the night at the foot of the largest tree, hoping that the bear would come. At roughly 11:00 pm, Anderson heard the bear digging for roots in the distance, and an hour later, it approached the Boram tree. Anderson shone his torch at the bear, which reared up on its hind legs in alarm. Anderson then shot it in the chest.

The theatre has recently undergone a complete refurbishment and major extension, adding a second theatre, two dedicated cinema screens, two performance/dance studios, improved dressing room and green room facilities and additional office space. The theatre's restaurant and bar facilities have also been totally overhauled and improved. History Plans for a theatre, restaurant and dance-hall were put first forward in November 1967, then lengthy negotiations followed. The Eden Court Theatre was formally opened on 15 April 1976 by Andrew Cruickshank MBE, an actor best known for his portrayal of Dr Cameron in BBC's long-running series \\"Dr Finlay's Casebook\\". It was built on a site next to the Ness river and incorporated the gothic Bishop's Palace residence (from which it took its name) into a new building designed by architects Law Dunbar and Naismith. The theatre was at that time a revolution to Inverness, and the wider Highland Region. It provided modern theatre performance space for the first time since the early '30s. Inverness had previously had a number of theatres including the Theatre Royal, previously situated on Bank street which burnt down in 1934 The Highland Council - Highland History & culture and the Empire Theatre on Academy Street. This theatre had originally opened as The Central Hall Picture House in 1912, but after the Theatre Royal burnt down, it was converted to a fully functioning theatre and reopened as the Empire around 1934. The building was designed by A. Ross & Son and was eventually demolished in 1971. Many famous names performed at this popular venue - Harry Lauder, Renee Houston and Calum Kennedy to name a few. Today the modern British Telecom building stands in its place. A theatre by the name of The Playhouse also existed in Inverness situated in the Eastgate area of the town centre. Present day Eden Court reopened in November 2007, having undergone a complete refurbishment and extension by Robertson Construction and Page\\\\Park Architects. Upon its reopening it became the largest combined arts centre in Scotland. With the reconstruction complete the theatre now has two auditoriums, the main auditorium, renamed the Empire Theatre has a capacity of just under 840. The second auditorium, named the One Touch Theatre has a capacity of approximately 270. The two new cinemas, La Scala and The Playhouse, have capacities of 125 and 78 respectively. The Empire Theatre, La Scala and Playhouse are named after the former venues of those names (the first La Scala was a cinema in Strother's Lane which closed down in the 1990s). The One Touch Theatre is named after the OneTouch Ultra diabetes monitor, produced by local employer LifeScan. La Scala and Playhouse host the annual Inverness Film Festival which includes many Scottish Premieres and niche and foreign language films. The refurbished theatre also includes the Jim Love Studio, named after the late Inverness Courier editor. Awards The theatre has won an award from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). It won the Community Benefit prize at the 2008 awards. Aberdeen Press & Journal Newspaper, 2 June 2008 It won the 2009 \\"Specialist Carpentry Refurbishment Award\\" for the high standard of carpentry work carried out in the Bishops Palace as undertaken by specialist contractor Ryvoan Developments.

It was the largest armed battle of the Lincoln County War and the climax of that civilian conflict in the New Mexico Territory. The firefight was interrupted and suppressed by United States Cavalry led by Lt. Col. Nathan Dudley from Fort Stanton. By September 1878, when Territorial Governor Lew Wallace was appointed by the president, many of the Regulators and other fighters had returned to normal life, as many had left the area. Wallace tasked Lincoln County Sheriff Pat Garrett to reduce lawlessness in the region, and, within three years, he and his deputies had hunted down and killed William \\"Billy the Kid\\" Bonney and other figures who had continued to operate in the area. Background Armed conflict in the Lincoln County War began with the killing of John Tunstall on February 18, 1878, by members of the Jesse Evans Gang (who were hired as gunmen by the \\"Murphy-Dolan\\" faction – referred to as \\"The House\\" by local residents) to harass their commercial competition in Lincoln. Tunstall had become a competitor of the established Murphy-Dolan mercantile store and bank.\\"Big Jim French and the Lincoln County War\\"; Tower, Mike; in Wild West Magazine; June 12, 2006 (online); History Net website; accessed January 2014Nolan, Frederick; The Lincoln County War, A Documentary History; University of Oklahoma Press; Norman, OK; 1992. The failure of Lincoln County Sheriff William J. Brady to take action against those responsible for the death of Tunstall led to Tunstall's supporters forming their own armed vigilante group. They called themselves the Lincoln County Regulators, and were led by Richard \\"Dick\\" Brewer. Other members included gunmen such as Charlie Bowdre, John Middleton, Frank Coe, George Coe, \\"Big Jim\\" French, Doc Scurlock, and William Bonney (later known as \\"Billy the Kid\\").\\"Billy the Kid\\"; Desert USA, October 1998; accessed January 2014 The conflict resulted in numerous deaths on both sides, including the killing of Sheriff Brady on April 1, 1878. On April 29, 1878, George Peppin, the newly appointed county sheriff, led a posse that included Jesse Evans and several of his gang, as well as the Seven Rivers Warriors gang to engage three Regulators in a shootout at the Fritz Ranch, resulting in the death of Frank McNab, the wounding of Ab Saunders, and the capture of Frank Coe. Shortly after his capture, Frank Coe escaped custody, although the details are unknown. The following morning, George Coe took up a defensive position on the roof of Alexander McSween's house. Coe had lost his trigger finger earlier in the month in a gunfight with Buckshot Roberts. He took aim at 'Dutch Charlie' Kruling, a member of the Seven Rivers gang. As the distance exceeded 350 yards, Henry Brown warned Coe he was wasting his shot, but Coe shot and successfully wounded Kruling.Coe, George; Frontier Fighter; University of New Mexico Press; Albuquerque, New Mexico; 1934 That same day, Seven Rivers members Tom Green, Charles Marshall, Jim Patterson, and John Galvin were killed in Lincoln, and the Regulators were blamed. On May 15, a group of 22 Regulators—led by Deputy Sheriff Scurlock and including Bonnie—tracked down Manuel Segovia of the Seven Rivers gang. They believed he had killed McNab. Segovia was reportedly shot and killed while trying to escape custody. The battle McSween, although a non-combatant, was the former partner of John Tunstall, and, along with John Chisum, had organized and financially supported the Regulators. On July 15, 1878, McSween returned to Lincoln with about 41 additional supporters, ten of whom he put up in his home; while the rest found beds throughout the town. Shortly afterward, a large force hired by the \\"Murphy-Dolan\\" faction and led by Peppin, arrived in Lincoln, and surrounded the Regulators at McSween's house.High Noon in Lincoln: Violence on the Western Frontier; by Utley, Robert Marshall; UNM Press; 1989; book; Google Books online; accessed January 2014 The posse and the Regulators traded gunfire for much of that day. At least five Murphy-Dolan men were wounded in the initial exchange, while the Regulators suffered no casualties. During the next three days, little changed, with no further casualties reported. Finally, on July 18, a cavalry detachment under the command of Lt. Col. Nathan Dudley from Fort Stanton arrived. They had either been summoned by frightened residents or by a report that a soldier had been wounded in Lincoln. The soldiers quickly ended the skirmish. By the end of the third day, the McSween supporters scattered around town had departed, leaving just the contingent at the McSween homestead. At some point during the night of July 18–19, however, the McSween house was set afire. When McSween and the others attempted to flee the following morning, he and several other Regulators were shot and killed. Now under the leadership of Bonney and Jim French, the Regulators quickly reassessed their position, and forced an escape from the burning adobe house. Reported casualty figures for the battle varied, but the Regulators lost at least five men, including McSween, while Peppin's posse suffered two dead: Bob BeckwithODMP memorial Robert Beckworth and Charlie Crawford. Aftermath The widow, Susan McSween, tried to have members of the Murphy-Dolan faction prosecuted, but no legal action was taken against them. Col. Dudley was placed under investigation for his failure to complete his mission without further bloodshed, but was cleared a year later when the army decided not to file charges. In September 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes dismissed Governor Axtell, replacing him with Lew Wallace, who was determined to reduce the lawlessness in the territory. By that time, the remaining Regulators had broken up. Scurlock, for instance, moved to Texas, where he settled down and raised a family. He and his wife had 10 children and he managed the local mail station; he died in Eastland, Texas, at 80 years old. The cousins Frank and George Coe also went straight, leaving Lincoln and living to be old men. In 1934, George Coe published his memoir, Frontier Fighter, recounting his part in the Lincoln County War and his friendship with Billy the Kid. Others, such as William Bonney, Charlie Bowdre, Tom O'Folliard, and Jose Chavez y Chavez, remained on the wrong side of the law. Over the next few years, Bonney, Bowdre, and O'Folliard, who were bandits, were hunted down and killed by Sheriff Garrett and his deputies. Chavez was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison in 1894 in an unrelated case. He received a pardon in 1910. Governor Lew Wallace issued general amnesties for many who took part in the conflict. He issued warrants for others, such as Bonney. He met him in Lincoln, where he offered the Kid a pardon if the latter would testify against the Murphy-Dolan faction in court. The Kid agreed, and after a staged arrest, gave his testimony at trial. Wallace failed to grant the promised pardon, and ignored Billy's subsequent correspondence imploring the governor to hold up his end of the bargain. The \\"war\\" led to the notoriety of Billy the Kid. Bonney escaped from jail, and Wallace issued a warrant and offered a $500 reward for his arrest. He was eventually killed by lawman Pat Garrett. The state considered a posthumous pardon of Bonney in 2010, but this was protested by law enforcement groups and descendants of the three officers killed by him.

The son of a gamekeeper, he had little formal education; but together with his brother Edward (1835–1865) he founded the firm of Tinsley Brothers, which published many of the leading novelists of the time. Life Tinsley was born in the village of South Mimms, north of London, the second of ten children. Although his mother (born Sarah Dover, the daughter of a local vet)Newbolt (2001), 1. could read and write well, his father William (born 1800), a gamekeeper,Tinsley (1900) I, 29–36. did not value education, and his son only attended school for a few years. By the age of nine he was doing day jobs, such as bird scaring, in the fields.Tinsley (1900) I, 7–8. In 1852, at the age of seventeen, William's younger brother Edward moved to London to take up work in the Nine Elms engineers' workshop of the London and South Western Railway.Tinsley (1900) I, 47–8; Newbolt (2001), 7. A few months later William followed him, walking from South Mimms to Notting Hill, where he quickly found work and lodging.Tinsley (1900) I, 3; 42. Both brothers were fond of books: William spent his evenings looking through bookshops and Edward quit his job with the railway to work for a small magazine Diogenes. In 1854 the brothers founded Tinsley Brothers, although the firm's formal foundation seems to date to 1858.Tinsley (1900) I, 46–9 gives 1854 as the start of the business; II, 343–4 cites a letter Tinsley wrote to the Athenaeum giving 1858 as the date and adding \\"I have our original agreement before me at this moment\\". Newbolt (2001), 31–2 discusses the patchy evidence for the brothers' early ventures. William, now an established businessman, married Louisa Rowley (1830 – 25 December 1899) on 26 April 1860. The couple would go on to have six daughters.Newbolt (2001), 38; 196; Newbolt (2004). After a slow start, the firm had its first major success with Mary Elizabeth Braddon's first novel Lady Audley's Secret in 1862.Tinsley (1900) I, 56–8. The book was hugely profitable for Tinsley Brothers and started an association of the firm with sensation novels, continued in other novels by Mrs. Braddon, Ouida and Sheridan Le Fanu, and perhaps most significantly The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins.Tinsley (1900) I, 82–5 (on Ouida). Newbolt (2001), 76–80 (on Ouida); 101–3 (on Le Fanu). Caricature of Tinsley by A. Bryan In 1866, Edward died of a stroke, leaving William to manage the firm alone.Newbolt (2001), 95–8. He continued to publish new authors, with, most notably, the first books of Thomas Hardy and G. A. Henty and the first novels of Richard Jefferies.Tinsley (1900) I, 126–7 (on Hardy); Downey (1905), 114–7 (on Henty); Miller and Matthews (1993), 91–3; 102–4; 113–5 (on Jefferies). In both Hardy's and Jefferies' case, he let the authors take a part of the risk, asking the former for £75, the latter for £60 to guarantee the costs. Hardy had brought Desperate Remedies (1871) to Tinsley because of the firm's reputation as a publisher of sensational novels;Hardy (1928), 100, \\"By this time it seemed to have dawned upon him that the Macmillan publishing-house was not in the way of issuing novels of a sensational kind: and accordingly he packed up the MS. again and posted it to Messrs. Tinsley … which did publish such novels\\". but the book (like Jefferies' early novels) was not a success and Hardy regained only £59, 12s., 6d. from his original £75.Hardy (1928), 115–6; Purdy (1954), 4–5; Sutherland (1976), 218–22; Newbolt (2001), 156–62. Sutherland gives a transcription, Purdy and Newbolt a photo, of the account presented to Hardy. Purdy (1954), 329–35 also summarises the Hardy-Tinsley correspondence. Despite this experience, Hardy returned to Tinsley with Under the Greenwood Tree (1872). Tinsley bought the copyright for £30, but again was unable to sell it. A Pair of Blue Eyes (1873) was yet another commercial failure; and later books by Hardy came out (more successfully) with other publishers.Sutherland (1976), 222–5. In old age, Tinsley recounted that he never had the offer of Far from the Madding Crowd (1874);Tinsley (1900) I, 128. but his assistant Edmund Downey remembered Tinsley telling him that Hardy had come to him detailing the rival offer:Downey (1905), 20–1. > I thanked him very much and said,' Take the offer, my boy. I couldn't spring > so much.' I seem to be very unlucky, Downey, about fourth novels, for the > one I declined was ' Far From the Madding Crowd.' Of course, I hadn't seen > it but even if I had it wouldn't have made any difference. Shortly after his brother's death, Tinsley added a new venture to the firm, Tinsleys' Magazine. Shilling magazines were then very popular; and after failing to buy Temple Bar Magazine, Tinsley founded his own in 1867. The magazine published short fiction and serialisations of books that Tinsley Brothers were bringing out, including Hardy's A Pair of Blue Eyes.Tinsley (1900) I, 128; Hardy (1928), 118. The magazine ran from 1868 to 1884, edited first by the writer Edmund Yates, then by Tinsley, finally by Tinsley's assistant Edmund Downey. It was never a success and often had disastrous losses; but Tinsley saw it as a useful advertisement for the firm's books.Tinsley (1900) 1, 323–4; Downey (1905), 242–72; Newbolt (2001), 203–16; Newbolt (2004). The final decades of the firm were marked by repeated financial crises; and in 1887, Tinsley Brothers had liabilities of £1,000. The few books dated 1888 from the firm are presumably orders already placed with the printers before bankruptcy.Newbolt (2001), 292–3. Tinsley survived his firm by fourteen years and towards the end was able to give a picture of Victorian publishing life in Random Recollections of an Old Publisher (1900). He died of chronic Bright's disease at his home in Wood GreenTinsley Moved in to 2 Dovecote Villas on Green Lanes in 1862, shortly after it was built. He remained there till his death. Sourced from 'William Tinsley (1831-1902): Speculative Publisher', ed Peter Newbolt, University of Michigan, 2001 on 1 May 1902.Newbolt (2004). Tinsley was an unorthodox businessman, often working without formal agreements; and what he saw as fair dealing might come across as sharp practice to those who lost by it.Tinsley (1900) I, 295 gives an example from his dealings with William Black: \\"There was no written agreement between us …, and I certainly thought I was entitled to charge what I had lost by 'Love or Marriage' out of the profit there was on 'In Silk Attire', but I reckoned without my host.\\" But he could also be generous and had a genuine enthusiasm for literature. His greatest passion was the theatre and his sometimes naive admiration led him to publish material from those involved in it against his own interest.Tinsley (1900) I, 47; Downey (1905), 215–6; Newbolt (2004).

The state forests are self- supporting (no taxes are used to operate the system). In addition, one-fourth of all income is returned to King William County. Income is received from the sale of forest products. The property was originally part of a large estate belonging to William Aylett, and was purchased in 1782 by one Robert Pollard. He built a frame house on the land, calling it Mount Zoar. It was partially destroyed by an 1851 fire, and rebuilt using brick by Pollard's son. Another fire between 1884 and 1885 destroyed the structure, as well as its contents. The present house was built in 1890; today it is on the National Register of Historic Places as Zoar. The forest was donated to the Virginia Department of Forestry in 1987. Today, the house and its outbuildings support field offices for area foresters helping landowners in both King William and King and Queen counties.

In 1932 he founded Chung Ming Machinery Co., Ltd. in Shanghai, to produce commercially available charcoal fueled cars. During World War II (1937) the charcoal car grew in popularity due to the high price of oil. His charcoal cars were popular until the early 1950s. Starting then, their popularity dropped, especially in Southwest China where inexpensive fuel was easily accessible.

Their hunting range was 2.7 square miles (7 square km) around the town of Hazaribagh in the eastern Indian district of Bihar. They were apparently attracted to the area by the town's rubbish dump, where livestock carcasses and bodies from the local mortuary were often buried, and frequently attracted wolves, striped hyenas, golden jackals and pariah dogs. One of the first attacks occurred on 15 February 1981, when a wolf entered a yard bordered by brushwood and attacked a young boy. The boy's cries attracted several people, who attacked the wolf with wooden poles, beating it to death. Throughout the next six months, the remaining wolves killed 13 children and mauled 13 others. On a night of June 1981, they were seen via a headlight to be exhuming and eating a human corpse. During the year, 4 wolves were killed, the last of which, thought to be the dominant male, was caught in a scrub forest and shot. Another report Human-Wolf Conflict in human dominated landscapes of Ahmednagar District, Maharashtra states that in the Hazaribagh area, 80 children were attacked - 60 of them fatally - between April 1993 and April 1995 (Rajpurohit 1999). It was thought that five wolf packs were responsible for the attacks. Indeed, Hazaribagh appears to be particularly prone to wolf attacks on children; as attacks have been a regular occurrence over a large area in Hazaribagh from the 1930s onwards (and perhaps even before this), it seems likely that a number of packs have been in operation over the years (Linnell et al. 2002).

The 7 mm Weatherby Magnum did not get a lot of exposure until the early part of the 1950s when the Weatherby rifles became more available. The more popular 7mm Remington Magnum was introduced in 1962 with very similar ballistics when compared to the 7mm Weatherby. It is a great cartridge for a one-rifle hunter that shoots long distances. It has taken game of all sizes around the world. Weatherby Mark V in 7 mm Weatherby Hunting The 7mm Weatherby Magnum is useful for all American plains game including the great Bears and the American Bison. It is also particularly useful when African and Australian plains game are hunted. It is an ultra high velocity cartridge giving about 300-400 fps higher velocity with lighter bullets than the more popular 30-06 Springfield which is regarded as considerably fast. It is quite easy to flinch in anticipation of the significant recoil. Care must be taken to confirm what twist rate was used, as the earlier West German 7mm Weatherby's used a 1 in 12 twist vs the faster 1 in 10 twist for those of later manufacture.

The vessel was 50 meters in length, 10 meters wide and weighed about a thousand tons. Its tallest mast was estimated to be 90 feet in height. The ship was manned by a crew of 200 and had approx. 1600 passengers. The great loss of life associated with the sinking has led to the Tek Sing being referred to in modern times as the \\"Titanic of the East\\". Sinking Sailing from the port of Amoy (now Xiamen in Fujian, China), the Tek Sing was bound for Batavia, Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta, Indonesia) laden with a large cargo of porcelain goods and 1600 Chinese immigrants. After a month of sailing, the Tek Sing's captain, Io Tauko, decided to attempt a shortcut through the Gaspar Strait between the Bangka-Belitung Islands, and ran aground on a reef. The junk sank in about 30m (100 feet) of water. The next morning, February 7, an English East Indiaman captained by James Pearl sailing from Indonesia to Borneo passed through the Gaspar Strait. The ship encountered debris from the sunk Chinese vessel and an enormous number of survivors. The English ship managed to rescue about 190 of the survivors. Another 18 persons were saved by a wangkang, a small Chinese junk captained by Jalang Lima. This Chinese vessel may have been sailing in tandem with the Tek Sing, but had avoided the reefs. Discovery On May 12, 1999, British marine salvor Michael Hatcher discovered the wreck of the Tek Sing in an area of the South China Sea north of Java, east of Sumatra and south of Singapore. His crew raised about 350,000 pieces of the ship's cargo in what is described as the largest sunken cache of Chinese porcelain ever recovered. Human remains were also found, but they were not disturbed as most of Hatcher's crew, being Indonesian and Chinese, believed that bad luck would befall any who disturbed the dead. The Tek Sing's recovered cargo was auctioned at in Stuttgart, Germany in November 2000.

He served a distinguished and decorated career in the United States Army, which most notably included commanding the first black tank battalion to enter combat in World War II. He also became well known as the white colonel who refused to court-martial future Baseball Hall of Famer Jackie Robinson. Early life Bates was born in Los Angeles, California and graduated in 1931 from Western Maryland College, now McDaniel College, where he was a star football player and a member of the Reserve Officers Training Corps. He also worked as a high school football coach and a teacher before being called to active duty in the Army as a first lieutenant in February 1941.Paul Bates, Head of Black Tank Unit, Dead at 86 World War II In January 1943, then Lieutenant Colonel Bates, took command of the 761st Tank Battalion, all of whose enlisted men were black. The unit’s distinctive unit insignia had an image of a black panther head. When the unit completed training in rigidly segregated boot camps in Louisiana and Texas, Bates refused a promotion from lieutenant colonel that would have separated him from what he regarded as one of the best tank battalions in the Army.Brothers in Arms: The Epic Story of the 761st Tank Battalion, WWII's Forgotten Heroes by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Anthony Walton, Broadway Books, 2004, page 29. He was eventually promoted to Colonel. While in Texas, Bates refused to court-martial a black officer who had refused to move to the rear of a bus at Fort Hood.Brothers in Arms: The Epic Story of the 761st Tank Battalion, WWII's Forgotten Heroes by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Anthony Walton, Broadway Books, 2004, page 57. That officer was Jackie Robinson, who was subsequently court-martialed for insubordination, but not convicted, and left the 761st before it went overseas. Praising Bates for his fairness and good judgment in his autobiography, Robinson would go on to break the color barrier in Major League Baseball by signing with the Brooklyn Dodgers.Arlington National Cemetery The 761st entered combat in November 1944 as part of General George S. Patton's Third Army and fought for 183 consecutive days without relief, according to David Williams, a battalion veteran and the author of the novel Hit Hard. The battalion fought in France and then Germany, where it pierced the Siegfried Line, and in Belgium, where it fought the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge. The 761st also fought in Luxembourg and Austria. In all, the 761st Tank Battalion went from Vic-sur- Seille, France, to the Enns River in Steyr, Austria, where it linked up with the Soviet Army. The 761st inflicted thousands of casualties on the enemy and captured, destroyed or liberated more than 30 major towns, four airfields, three ammunition-supply dumps, 461 wheeled vehicles, 34 tanks, 113 large guns and a radio station. Ironically, Bates was the first member of the 761st to be wounded.Brothers in Arms: The Epic Story of the 761st Tank Battalion, WWII's Forgotten Heroes by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Anthony Walton, Broadway Books, 2004, page 94. Among its 687 enlisted men and 41 officers, 276 received the Purple Heart for wounds in action and 36 died in combat. During World War II, Bates was awarded the Silver Star and two Bronze Stars, in addition to the Purple Heart. In 1963, he was awarded the Legion of Merit when he retired from the Army, having served in combat commands in Europe, at the Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, KS, and at the Pentagon. In 1978, after a 33-year struggle by the unit's veterans, President Jimmy Carter awarded the 761st a Presidential Unit Citation \\"for extraordinary heroism in action.\\" Later years Following his retirement Colonel Bates remained in close touch with the veterans of the 761st and their families, attending yearly reunions and establishing a scholarship at McDaniel College for lineal descendants of the battalion members who served the unit from August 1944 through April 1945. The Paul L. Bates Memorial Scholarship Fund was established in 1999 under the terms of his will, and is administered and maintained by the Board of Trustees of McDaniel College in Westminster, Maryland.761st Tank Battalion site In 1993, the 761st made news because of a PBS documentary, Liberators: Fighting on Two Fronts in World War II, in which two of its former enlisted men said the battalion had participated in the liberation of the Dachau and Buchenwald concentration camps. But Colonel Bates, along with other officers, noted that the unit was spread over a 50-mile front supporting the 71st Infantry Division at the time and would not confirm the claim. The unit did however liberate Gunskirchen, a subcamp of the Mauthausen complex. Colonel Bates was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia on March 1, 1995 with full military honors.

Built in 1803, it is a fine local example of Federal architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 30, 1976. It is presently part of a larger building that houses financial services businesses.  Description and history  The Bartlett–Russell–Hedge House is located in the center of Plymouth, on the south side of Court Street at its junction with Russell Street. It is a three- story painted brick building, with a hip roof surrounded by a low balustrade and topped by a cupola. It is five bays wide and three deep, with a symmetrically arranged front facade. The outer bays have sash windows set in rectangular openings, with smaller windows on the third floor. The main entrance is in the center bay; it is accessed by a short flight of side-facing stone steps, and is sheltered by a roughly rectangular portico supported by paired paneled square columns in front and pilasters in the back. The center portion of the portico has a slightly rounded projection, and is topped by a balustrade. On the second floor above is a Palladian window, while the third- floor window is a three-part window lacking the Palladian rounded arch at the center. The house was built about 1803 for Joseph Bartlett, a ship's captain. After suffering financial reverses due to the War of 1812, his son William took over the property, converting it to an inn. It was here that his son John was spent his early years; he would later achieve fame as the publisher of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations. The next owner, Nathaniel Russell, owned a local iron manufacturing business. His granddaughter married into the family of Barnabas Hedge, one of his business partners, and eventually inherited the property. In 1951, the Hedge family sold the house to a bank, which made additions to the rear to accommodate its business. The modern attachments to the structure have since been extended further, but the house interior still retains many original features.

The congregation, founded in 1866, is one of a small number of African Methodist Episcopal (AME) congregations in eastern Massachusetts, and is an enduring component of the small African-American community in Plymouth. Its church, built about 1840 as a commercial building and consecrated in 1870, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Description and history The Bethel AME Church is located a short south of Plymouth's downtown Main Street area, on the south side of Sever Street west of Russell Street. It is located in a densely built residential area. The church is a modest 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It exhibits transitional Greek Revival-Italianate styling, with corner pilasters, paired brackets in the eaves, and gable end returns. The main facade is symmetrical, with paired sash windows flanking the center entrance. The windows are topped by bracketed projecting cornices and are articulated by narrow pilasters. The entrance is simply framed, and is sheltered by a gabled portico with Doric columns. The parsonage house is a vernacular 1-1/2 story wood frame house located about behind the church; it was built in 1895. The church building's construction date is unknown: the lot was empty in 1830, and the building stood there on an 1858 map. It was apparently built for commercial purposes, housing diverse businesses such as gymnasium, shoe shop, and school, prior to its acquisition by the AME congregation in 1870. Plymouth has historically had a small African-American population, which was in 1850 recorded to number 138. Members of this population organized the AME congregation in 1866, meeting in a small converted house on Billington Street. Seeking a larger space, the congregation purchased this building in 1870. Most of the congregation's pastors were either unpaid or little-paid, and many served the congregation only a short time, often supplementing their religious mission with other work.

Since 2009 the main organisers have been Mozaīka, the National LGBT Rights Organization LGL Lithuanian Gay League, and the Estonian LGBT Association. History Latvia The first pride event held in Latvia took place in 2005 under the name Riga Pride, as the local equivalent to other pride parades held elsewhere around the world. Political opposition to Pride emerged after organizers received a permit. The Prime Minister of Latvia Aigars Kalvītis publicly opposed the event, and Pride was officially sanctioned only after a court overturned a withdrawal of the permit. The deputy Mayor of Riga Juris Lujāns resigned in protest at the event going ahead.

Description and history Plymouth was settled in 1620, and developed in the 18th century as a maritime center. In the 19th century, it expanded as services for this activity grew. In 1812 the first wharf southeast of the mouth of Town Brook was built by Samuel Doten; it is now the site of a yacht club. Residences were built on the roads facing the waterfront, and on the roads rising up the hill to the south. Union Street parallels the shore, providing access to the waterfront properties, and Bradford Street and Water Streets rise southwest to join it to Sandwich Street, for many years the principal through coast road. The Bradford Street area was developed in part as a speculative venture by Alden Harlow in the 1840s, giving the area most of its character. Harlow built a number of vernacular 1-1/2 story cottages with three-bay fronts, which are the single most numerous housing type in the district. The historic district is centered on the junction of Bradford and Union Streets. It extends southeastward along Union Street for a short distance, and northwest to the junction with Water Street. In addition to including the entirety of Bradford Street, it includes houses located on the adjacent roads: Emerald, Freedom, and Watercure Streets.

Available by request from the National Park Service. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. The district includes historical and archaeological resources that span more than three centuries. Included in these resources are four mill ponds, dams, herring runs, mill privileges (sites where mill operators were authorized to divert water, where industrial archaeological remains may be found), and a variety of housing from nearly every significant period in that time. The oldest house in the district is the Richard Sparrow House, built in 1640; it is also the oldest building standing in Plymouth. The reconstructed Jenney Grist Mill The mills erected by the early settlers provided basic functions: they were used to saw wood and grind grain. As Plymouth prospered and grew, smaller industrial operations harness the brook's water power to perform other functions. During the 19th century, the nation's industrialization reached Town Brook, and mill complexes of larger size were also built. Around the turn of the 20th century mills for processing iron in a variety of ways were established, some of whose buildings still survive today. A significant number of industrial properties from the 19th century were lost, often to fire, in the 20th century. In the early 20th century interest in the area's rich history led to the establishment in the 1920s of Brewster Gardens, a public park near the mouth of the brook. Near the park is the Jenney Grist Mill, a 1970 reconstruction of an early grist mill which burned in 1837.

Temple of Hercules Umayyad Palace Collection of Roman sculptures on display at the Jordan Archaeological Museum. Roman Theater, the Hashemite Plaza and the downtown area as seen from the hill. Site map The Amman Citadel () is a historical site at the center of downtown Amman, the capital of Jordan. The L-shaped hill is one of the seven hills (jabals) that originally made up Amman. Evidence of occupation since the pottery Neolithic period has been found and the hill was fortified during the Bronze Age (1800 BC). The hill became the capital of the Kingdom of Ammon sometime after 1200 BC. It was later occupied by various empires that of the Assyrians (8th century BC), Babylonians (6th century BC), the Ptolemies, the Seleucids (3rd century BC), Romans (1st century BC), Byzantines (3rd century AD) and the Umayyads (7th century AD). After the Umayyads came a period of decline and for much of the time until 1878 as the former city became an abandoned pile of ruins only sporadically used by Bedouins and seasonal farmers. Despite this gap, the Citadel of Amman is considered to be among the world's oldest continuously inhabited places. The Citadel is considered an important site because it has had a long history of occupation by many great civilizations.Najjar, M. \\"Amman Citadel Temple of Hercules Excavations Preliminary Report.\\" Syria 70 (1993): 220-225. Most of the buildings still visible at the site are from the Roman, Byzantine, and Umayyad periods. The major buildings at the site are the Temple of Hercules, a Byzantine church, and the Umayyad Palace. The Jordan Archaeological Museum was built on the hill in 1951. Though the fortification walls enclose the heart of the site, the ancient periods of occupation covered large areas. Historic structures, tombs, arches, walls and stairs have no modern borders, and therefore there is considerable archaeological potential at this site, as well as in surrounding lands, and throughout Amman. Archaeologists have been working at the site since the 1920s, including Italian, British, French, Spanish, and Jordanian projects, but a great part of the Citadel remains unexcavated. History Excavations have uncovered signs of human occupation from as far back as the Middle Bronze Age (1650-1550 BC) in the form of a tomb that held pottery and scarab seals.Najjar, M. \\"Amman Citadel Temple of Hercules Excavations Preliminary Report.\\" Syria 70 (1993): 220-225. During the Iron Age, the Citadel was called Rabbath-Ammon. The Amman Citadel Inscription comes from this period, an example of early Phoenician writing.Horn, Siegried H. \\"The Amman Citadel Inscription.\\" The American Schools of Oriental Research 193 (1969): 2-13.

Rajjal. \\"Amman\\" Cities 5.4 (1988): 318-325. From the Hellenistic Period, there were not many architectural changes, but pottery provides evidence for their occupation. The site became Roman around 30 BC, and finally came under Muslim rule in AD 661. The Citadel declined in importance under Ayyubid rule in the 13th century, but a watchtower was added to the site during this period.Milwright, Marcus. \\"Central and Southern Jordan in the Ayyubid Period: Historical and Archaeological Perspectives.\\" Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland 16.1 (2006): 1-27.

Contents *Roman Temple of Hercules *Umayyad Palace *Umayyad water cistern *Byzantine church *Ayyubid watchtower The Temple of Hercules located at the site dates to the Roman occupation of the Citadel in the 2nd century AD. During the Umayyad period (AD 661-750), a palace structure, known in Arabic as al-Qasr, (القصر) was built at the Citadel. The Umayyad Palace was probably used as an administrative building or the residence of an Umayyad official. The palace draws on Byzantine style. For example, the entrance hall is shaped in a Greek cross plan. The palace may have been built on top of an existing Byzantine structure in this shape.Almagro, Antonio, and Emilio Olavarri. \\"A New Umayyad Palace at the Citadel of Amman.\\" Studies in the History and Archaeology of Jordan.

Article 22(122) provides that: \\"All peoples shall have the right to their economic, social and cultural development with due regard to their freedom and identity and in the equal enjoyment of the common heritage of mankind.\\" The right to development was subsequently proclaimed by the United Nations in 1986 in the \\"Declaration on the Right to Development,\\" which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly resolution 41/128. The Right to development is a group right of peoples as opposed to an individual right, and was reaffirmed by the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. The right to development is now included in the mandate of several UN institutions and offices. The Preamble of the Declaration on the Right to Development states \\"development is a comprehensive economic, social, cultural and political process, which aims at the constant improvement of the well- being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active, free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom.\\" The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action states in Article 10 \\"The World Conference on Human Rights reaffirms the \\"right to development\\", as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development, as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights. As stated in the Declaration on the Right to Development, the human person is the central subject of development. While development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, the lack of development may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human rights. States should cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development. The international community should promote an effective international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the elimination of obstacles to development. Lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level, as well as equitable economic relations and a favorable economic environment at the international level.\\" The Rio Declaration The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, also known as Rio Declaration or the G.R.E.G, recognizes the right to development as one of its 27 principles.

In the beginning, the church likely met in congregants' homes until the first meeting house was built near what is today known as Miles Standish Burial Ground. The Duxbury congregation became a parish church of Massachusetts' Congregationalist state church. A schism developed at the turn of the 19th century, when much of the congregation adopted Unitarianism along with many of the other state churches in Massachusetts. State churches were officially disaffiliated with the Massachusetts government in 1834. The current church building was constructed in 1840.

The song is well known by variations of the chorus: Songs such as \\"Steal Away to Jesus\\", \\"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\\", \\"Wade in the Water\\" and the \\"Gospel Train\\" are songs with hidden codes, not only about having faith in God, but containing hidden messages for slaves to run away on their own, or with the Underground Railroad. \\"Steal Away\\" the song was composed by Wallace Willis, a slave of a Choctaw freedman in the old Indian Territory, sometime before 1862.Banks, \\"Narrative\\", p. 28: \\"My grandfather, Uncle Wallace, was a slave of the Wright fam'ly when dey lived near Doaksville, and he and my grandmother would pass de time by singing while dey toiled away in de cotton fields. Grandfather was a sweet singer. He made up songs and sung 'em. He made up 'Swing Low Sweet Chariot' and 'Steal Away to Jesus.' He made up lots more'n dem, but a Mr. Reid, a white man, liked dem ones de best and he could play music and he helped grandfather to keep dese two songs. I loves to hear 'em.\\" Alexander Reid, a minister at a Choctaw boarding school, heard Willis singing the songs and transcribed the words and melodies. He sent the music to the Jubilee Singers of Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee.Flickinger, The Choctaw Freedmen , etc.: \\"In 1871, when the Jubilee singers first visited Newark, New Jersey, Rev. Alexander Reid happened to be there and heard them. The work of the Jubilee singers was new in the North and attracted considerable and very favorable attention. But when Prof. White, who had charge of them, announced several concerts to be given in different churches of the city he added, \\"We will have to repeat the Jubilee songs as we have no other.\\" When Mr. Reid was asked how he liked them he remarked, \\"Very well, but I have heard better ones.\\" When he had committed to writing a half dozen of the plantation songs he had heard \\"Wallace and Minerva\\" sing with so much delight at old Spencer Academy, he met Mr. White and his company in Brooklyn, New York, and spent an entire day rehearsing them. These new songs included, \\"Steal Away to Jesus,\\" \\"The Angels are Coming,\\" \\"I'm a Rolling,\\" and \\"Swing Low.\\" The Jubilee Singers then popularized the songs during a tour of the United States and Europe. \\"Steal Away\\" the song is a standard Gospel song, and is found in the hymnals of many Protestant denominations. An arrangement of the song is included in the oratorio A Child of Our Time, first performed in 1944, by the classical composer Michael Tippett (190898). Many recordings of the song have been made including versions by Pat Boone and Nat King Cole.

Description and history The Captain Gamaliel Bradford House stands in the central eastern part of Duxbury, on the west side of Tremont Street (Massachusetts Route 3A), south of Harrison Street and north of Duxbury Town Hall. It is a 2-1/2 story frame structure, roughly square in plan, with a hip roof topped by a square monitor section. It is finished in clapboards, except for the sidewalls, which are brick, and is set with a side facing the street. The main facade, facining north, is three bays wide, with a center entrance sheltered by a Doric porch. A similar but simpler entry is located on the south-facing rear facade. The interior of the house follows a typical central hall plan, and retains original period wood paneling. A two-story addition projects west of the main block, behind the rear entry. The property also includes a 19th-century barn and a small cottage, built about 1840 out of materials salvaged from a nearby church. The house was built in 1807 for Gamaliel Bradford, member of a prominent local family. A ship's captain, he served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, and later served as a trustee of the Massachusetts Historical Society. The United States Navy destroyer USS Bradford is named in his honor.

Interactions between humans and the elk sometimes results in injuries. Human–wildlife conflict refers to the interaction between wild animals and humans, and the resultant negative impact on people, animals, resources, and habitats. It occurs when growing human populations overlap with established wildlife territory, creating competition for space and resources. Conflict takes many forms including but not limited to: loss of life or injury to humans and wild animals, depredation of livestock, and degradation of habitat. Human–wildlife conflict is a global issue present in urban and rural landscapes alike. Previously, conflict mitigation strategies utilized lethal control, translocation, population size regulation, and endangered species preservation. Recent management now uses an interdisciplinary set of approaches to solving conflicts. These include applying scientific research, sociological studies, and the arts to reducing conflicts. As human-wildlife conflict inflicts direct and indirect consequences on people and animals, its mitigation is an important priority for the management of biodiversity and protected areas. Meaning Human–wildlife conflict is defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) as \\"any interaction between humans and wildlife that results in negative impacts of human social, economic or cultural life, on the conservation of wildlife populations, or on the environment.SARPO, WWF. \\"Human wildlife conflict manual.\\" Harare, Zimbabwe, WWF Southern African Regional Programme Office (SARPO) (2005).

However, in both cases outcomes are decided by human responses to the interactions.Cline, R.; Sexton, N.; Stewart, S.C. (2007).

History Human- wildlife interactions have occurred throughout man's prehistory and recorded history. Among the early forms of human-wildlife conflict is the depredation of the ancestors of prehistoric man by a number of predators of the Miocene such as saber-toothed cats, leopards, and spotted hyenas.Smilie, Shaun (20 May 2002). \\"Killer Cats Hunted Human Ancestors\\".

African elephants frequently clash with humans, as their long-distance migrations often intersect with farms.

Resolving conflicts, therefore, often requires a regional plan of attack with a response tailored to the specific crisis.Pooley, S., Barua, M., Beinart, W., Dickman, A., Holmes, G., Lorimer, J., ... & Sillero‐Zubiri, C. (2017). An interdisciplinary review of current and future approaches to improving human–predator relations. Conservation Biology, 31(3), 513-523. Still, there are a variety of management techniques that are frequently employed to mitigate conflicts. Examples include: * _Translocation of problematic animals_ : Relocating so-called \\"problem\\" animals from a site of conflict to a new place is a mitigation technique used in the past, although recent research has shown that this approach can have detrimental impacts on species and is largely ineffective.Bradley, E. H., Pletscher, D. H., Bangs, E. E., Kunkel, K. E., Smith, D. W., Mack, C. M., ... & Jimenez, M. D. (2005). Evaluating wolf translocation as a nonlethal method to reduce livestock conflicts in the northwestern United States. Conservation Biology, 19(5), 1498-1508. Translocation can decrease survival rates and lead to extreme dispersal movements for a species, and often \\"problem\\" animals will resume conflict behaviors in their new location.Massei, Giovanna, Roger J. Quy, Joanne Gurney, and Dave P. Cowan. \\"Can translocations be used to mitigate human–wildlife conflicts?.\\" Wildlife Research 37, no. 5 (2010): 428-439. * _Erection of fences or other barriers_ : Building barriers around cattle bomas, creating distinct wildlife corridors,Kesch, M. Kristina, Dominik T. Bauer, and Andrew J. Loveridge. \\"Break on through to the other side: the effectiveness of game fencing to mitigate human—wildlife conflict.\\" African Journal of Wildlife Research 45, no. 1 (2015): 76-88. and erecting beehive fences around farms to deter elephantsNgama, Steeve, Lisa Korte, Jérôme Bindelle, Cédric Vermeulen, and John R. Poulsen. \\"How bees deter elephants: beehive trials with forest elephants (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) in Gabon.\\" PloS one 11, no. 5 (2016): e0155690. have all demonstrated the ability to be successful and cost-effective strategies for mitigating human-wildlife conflict. * _Improving community education and perception of animals_ : Various cultures have myriad views and values associated with the natural world, and how wildlife is perceived can play a role in exacerbating or alleviating human-wildlife conflict. In one Masaai community where young men once obtained status by killing lions, conservationists worked with community leaders to shift perceptions and allow those young men to achieve the same social status by protecting lions instead. * _Effective land use planning_ : altering land use practices can help mitigate conflict between humans and crop-raiding animals. For example in Mozambique, communities started to grow more chili pepper plants after making the discovery that elephants dislike and avoid plants containing capsaicin. This creative and effective method discourages elephants from trampling community farmers' fields as well as protects the species. * _Compensation_ : Compensation: in some cases, governmental systems have been established to offer monetary compensation for losses sustained due to human-wildlife conflict. These systems hope to deter the need for retaliatory killings of animals, and to financially incentivize the co-existing of humans and wildlife.Nyhus, Philip J., Steven A. Osofsky, Paul Ferraro, Francine Madden, and Hank Fischer. \\"Bearing the costs of human- wildlife conflict: the challenges of compensation schemes.\\" CONSERVATION BIOLOGY SERIES-CAMBRIDGE- 9 (2005): 107. Compensation strategies have been employed in India,Ogra, Monica, and Ruchi Badola. \\"Compensating human–wildlife conflict in protected area communities: ground-level perspectives from Uttarakhand, India.\\" Human Ecology 36, no. 5 (2008): 717.

Policies and practices in managing human-wildlife conflict in Limpopo Province, South Africa.\\" Conservation and Society 8, no. 3 (2010): 225. to name a few. The success of compensation in managing human-wildlife conflict has varied greatly due to under-compensation, a lack of local participation, or a failure by the government to provide timely payments. * _Spatial analyses and mapping conflict hotspots_ : mapping interactions and creating spatial models has been successful in mitigating human-carnivore conflictMiller, Jennifer RB. \\"Mapping attack hotspots to mitigate human–carnivore conflict: approaches and applications of spatial predation risk modeling.\\" Biodiversity and Conservation 24, no. 12 (2015): 2887-2911. and human-elephant conflict,Sitati, Noah W., Matthew J. Walpole, Robert J. Smith, and Nigel Leader‐Williams. \\"Predicting spatial aspects of human–elephant conflict.\\" Journal of Applied Ecology 40, no. 4 (2003): 667-677. among others. In Kenya, for example, using grid-based geographical information systems in collaboration with simple statistical analyses allowed conservationists to establish an effective predictor for human-elephant conflict. * _Predator- deterring guard dogs_ : The use of guard dogs to protect livestock from depredation has been effective in mitigating human-carnivore conflict around the globe. A recent review found that 15.4% of study cases researching human- carnivore conflict used livestock-guarding dogs as a management technique, with animal losses on average 60 times lower than the norm.Moreira-Arce, Darío, Carolina S. Ugarte, Francisco Zorondo-Rodríguez, and Javier A. Simonetti. \\"Management tools to reduce carnivore-livestock conflicts: current gap and future challenges.\\" Rangeland ecology & management 71, no. 3 (2018): 389-394. Livestock guardian dogs can be an effective and popular way of deterring predators and reducing human-carnivore conflicts. Hidden Dimensions of Conflict Human wildlife conflict also has a range of 'hidden' dimensions that are not typically considered when the focus is on visible consequences. These can include health impacts, opportunity costs, and transaction costs.Barua,M., Bhagwat, S.A. and Jadhav, S. (2013). \\"The hidden dimensions of human-wildlife conflict: Health impacts, opportunity and transaction costs\\". Biological Conservation. 157(2013): 309–316. doi:10.1016/j.biocon.2012.07.014 Case studies include work on elephants in northeast India, where human-elephant interactions are correlated with increased imbibing of alcohol by crop guardians with resultant enhanced mortality in interactions,Barua,M. (2013). \\"Volatile ecologies: towards a material politics of human-animal relations\\". Environment and Planning A. 0 (6): 1462–1478. doi:10.1068/a46138. Retrieved 21 December 2013. and issues related to gender in northern India.Ogra, M. (2008). \\"Human-wildlife conflict and gender in protected area borderlands: A case study of costs, perceptions, and vulnerabilities from Uttarakhand (Uttaranchal), India\\". Geoforum. 39 (May 2008): 1408–1422. In addition, research has shown that the fear caused by the presence of predators can aggravate human-wildlife conflict more than the actual damage produced by encounters.

The complex consists of two towers, completed in 2006 and 2007. A third tower was completed in 2008, and was later rebranded as The Martin in 2011. A fourth tower had been planned, but was never built. History Early model design of Panorama Towers Panorama Towers was announced on September 7, 2003, as a business venture between partners Andrew Sasson and Laurence Hallier, who owned Sasson/Hallier Development LLC. The project was announced as a 250-unit condominium complex that would stand 30 stories high and would be built on 10.5 acres of land. Las Vegas-based architecture firm Klai Juba was hired to design the project. Klai Juba's iconic aqua-blue glass towers have been nominated and won numerous awards from the design, construction and excellence service of the complex. Among the many honors was The Best of Las Vegas' architecture award by the editors of the Las Vegas Review Journal, and \\"High- Rise of the Year\\" by the Community Associations Institute. Sasson described the target clientele as local residents who enjoy high-end design and the ideal central location of being only a block from the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, which he labeled as Las Vegas' beachfront. The project was named for its panoramic views of the Las Vegas Strip and of Red Rock Canyon. Sales for a second tower had begun by July 2004. By September 2004, construction was underway on one of the towers. That month, a 35-story third tower, standing 500 feet tall, was approved by Clark County. The third tower would be slightly smaller than the other two towers, with only 250 units compared to 350 for the others. The second tower was scheduled to begin construction in January 2005, with construction on the third tower scheduled to begin six months later. During construction, actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire purchased units at Panorama Towers. DiCaprio also attended the groundbreaking ceremony, held in October 2004. Construction on the first two towers was underway in April 2005, at which point a lawsuit was filed against The Related Companies by Sasson/Hallier. The two companies had previously negotiated a possible joint venture for the Panorama Towers project, and Sasson/Hallier provided various database information – including contracts, financials, and marketing information – to Related as part of the negotiations. Ultimately, negotiations failed, and Sasson/Hallier alleged that Related kept the database information to develop and market its proposed Icon condominium project. By March 2006, a fourth tower was being planned. The fourth tower was to be constructed south of the property, and was to stand 44 stories tall. A groundbreaking ceremony for the third tower was held on April 21, 2006. Pamela Anderson appeared at the event as Hallier's date. Anderson, who referred to the project as \\"Pamorama\\", was to become a resident in the future fourth tower and said she would hire David LaChapelle to design her new residence. At that time, the first tower – standing 33 stories, with 308 units – was 90 percent complete, with an expected opening in July 2006, approximately six months later than initially planned. The second tower had been topped off at that time, and was scheduled for completion in January 2007. M.J. Dean Construction was the general contractor for the first and second tower, while Taylor International was the general contractor for the third tower, which was constructed north of Harmon Avenue and the other two towers. The first tower opened in December 2006, while the second tower – with 326 units – was scheduled to open in summer 2007. The first and second tower were constructed at an estimated cost of $300 million. In April 2007, a Vice President of Sales for the project said there was no timetable for developing the fourth tower due to the local high- rise market becoming questionable. The second tower opened in late 2007. In January 2008, Hallier said that the second tower had sold 98 percent of its 320 units. The third tower, Panorama North, was completed in 2008. In 2009, Hallier listed his unfinished three-level, \\"chairman's penthouse\\" in the first tower for sale, at a price of $2.8 million. In 2011, Panorama North was spun off as a separate property renamed The Martin. In February 2011, Anderson sued Hallier, alleging that he reneged on a promise to build her a condominium unit at Panorama Towers. In June 2011, Hallier filed a counter-complaint against Anderson, claiming that she was in breach of a 2006 agreement in which she was to make numerous promotional appearances to help market Panorama Towers. Hallier said Anderson's promised condominium unit was contingent on her appearances, which he said she failed to do. Hallier sued Anderson for $22.5 million, the total price of the unsold units that Anderson was to promote. In January 2012, Hallier and Anderson settled out of court as part of an undisclosed deal. In 2013, the unfinished penthouse in the second tower sold for $3.9 million. As of 2013, Panorama Towers was patrolled by an 80-camera security system and two dozen security personnel, and utilized fingerprint security scanners. Value Initial condominium prices ranged from $270,000 to $1 million during the pre-construction phase. Even after facing the worst real estate market in the city's history, Panorama Towers has rebounded with one of highest appreciation rates in the region. The units have regained a significant amount of their value with prices nearly doubled over the final six months of 2011. Additionally, with the opening of the Harmon Overpass, it allows residents access to the heart of Las Vegas Strip in five minutes.

It is endemic to Southern Africa (South Africa, Lesotho, Eswatini, Botswana). Distribution This species is widespread in South Africa (present all provinces but is absent from most of the Northern Cape) and also occurs in Lesotho and Eswatini. It is also recorded from eastern Botswana, although this might represent a translocation. Description The snake can achieve a maximum length of 90 cm, but averages 45–60 cm. Colour varies from shiny olive green to dull dark green above. A bright yellow to orange vertebral stripe runs from the top of the head to the tip of the tail. Habitat and ecology This species occurs in grassland, fynbos, and moist savanna habitats at elevations up to above sea level. They are often found near streams and under rocks, and may occur in old termitaria. It is secretive but can be locally common. It is active at night (nocturnal). The diet consists of rodents, lizards, and frogs. The female lays clutches of up to 12 eggs. It is non-venomous and seldom attempts to bite. Conservation Grassland habitats that this species inhabits are heavily transformed by urban development and agriculture, but it is not considered threatened because it remains common in suitable habitat and is widespread. Its range overlaps with a number of protected areas.

The district includes both sides of Washington Street extending from South Duxbury (also known as Hall's Corner) to Powder Point Avenue, including several side streets off of Washington and a small portion of St. George Street and Powder Point Avenue. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. In 1986, the district included 143 buildings deemed to contribute to the historic character of the area. Historic significance The district was selected for inclusion in the National Register because it embodies the distinctive characteristics of Duxbury, Massachusetts during the community's heyday as a center of shipbuilding and maritime commerce. Within the district are scores of houses which are well-preserved examples of early 19th century architecture. The great majority of the structures are of the Federal style and were constructed between 1800 and 1820. There are also some examples of Greek Revival and Victorian architecture.Jean Poindexter Colby, \\"National Register District,\\" The Duxbury Book,(Duxbury: Duxbury Rural and Historical Society, 1987) p. 217 Washington Street, which makes up the bulk of the district, runs two miles along the shore of Duxbury Bay from Hall's Corner to the Bluefish River and slightly beyond. First laid out in 1798, the street was, at the time, a controversial scheme concocted by several up-and-coming shipbuilders. These men, including Ezra Weston I, Ezra Weston II, Seth Sprague and Joshua Winsor, were among the first in the community to take advantage of the post-Revolution economic boom and each built substantial fleets of fishing schooners. Their new wealth commanded attention and respect in the community, however they met with opposition from the bulk of residents when they proposed the construction of a north-south avenue along the shore. Prior to 1798, Duxbury's shore was only accessible by crude cart paths. In order for maritime commerce to thrive, the shipbuilders required an avenue running along the water which would allow convenient placement of shipyards, warehouses, stores, wharves, and boarding houses. Although the proposal caused uproar at Duxbury Town Meetings for several years, even ending up in court with the shipbuilders suing the Town for refusing to construct the avenue, the project, including a wooden drawbridge over the Bluefish River, was eventually completed in 1803.Patrick Browne, King Caesar of Duxbury: Exploring the World of Ezra Weston, Shipbuilder and Merchant,(Duxbury: Duxbury Rural and Historical Society, 2006) pp. 30-36 Immediately after its construction, sea captains, shipwrights and merchants began building attractive homes on Washington Street. The shipyards and wharves are now gone, but the houses remain and collectively provide a sense of the character of early 19th century Duxbury. The avenue that at first caused so much consternation is now one of Duxbury most treasured historic resources.

Historic significance The Wright Building was donated to the Town of Duxbury by Georgianna Wright (1837–1919), an influential citizen of Duxbury and philanthropist. In 1890, Wright had donated her guest house to serve as the first Duxbury Free Library. The wooden building soon grew too cramped and by 1906, Wright decided to fund the construction of a new building. Sparing no expense, she hired a well-known architect, Joseph Everett Chandler, to design a brick library in the colonial revival style. Other projects by Chandler include the Frederic Adams Library in Kingston, Massachusetts and the restoration of the Paul Revere House in Boston, Massachusetts. The cornerstone was laid in 1907 and the building completed in 1909. A newspaper reporter present at the dedication noted some of the library's impressive features, including electric lighting and a reading room paneled in black cypress with gilded accents.Browne and Forgit, 20-21. Restoration In 1997, the Duxbury Free Library moved to new quarters, leaving the Wright Building empty. Used sporadically by various organizations for a few years, by 2004 the Wright Building was vacant and suffering decay. By a vote of Duxbury Town Meeting, Community Preservation Funds were appropriated and the Town of Duxbury undertook the extensive restoration of the building. The 1909 portion of the library was outfitted for use by the Duxbury Rural and Historical Society for their Drew Archival Library where historic documents are preserved. The 1968 addition was refurbished for use by the Duxbury Student Union Association. The Wright Building was re-dedicated on September 22, 2007, just slightly over one hundred years after the cornerstone was laid.

The leading speech in the case was delivered by Lord Denning, during his short tenure as a Law lord.  Facts  The defendants were a brewery house. The managers of the brewery house, Mr and Mrs Richardson, lived on the premises and occupied a private portion there. Wheat, a paying guest, fell down the stairs of that private part of the premises and died, because there was no handrail on part of the stairs and someone had removed the lightbulb on the stairway. Mr Wheat's estate sued the brewery under the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957.  Judgment  The main legal issue before the house of Lords was whether the brewery fell within the scope of the Act as \\"occupier\\". The leading speech was delivered by Lord Denning. He defined the \\"occupier\\" as a person who has sufficient control over the premises to the extent that he ought to realise that lack of care on his part can cause damage to his lawful visitors. The duty may be shared between several occupiers, who will be jointly and severally liable to the visitors if they both fail to exercise the due care, causing injury. If the property is let, the owner will be considered occupier to all parts of the premises that are not let by demise, such as the common staircase. Where the owner did not let by demise, but merely licensed the property (i.e. allowed another person to live on it), he will be considered occupier of the entire space because he would retain the right and the duty to do repairs. In both cases he will be occupier jointly with the tenant. A contractor doing work on the premises can also be classed as occupier in certain circumstances, whether or not jointly with the owner. In this particular case, the brewery and Mr and Mrs Richardson (the brewery’s licensees) were all three occupiers. However, they all had different duties of care towards the visitors, depending on how much control they exercised. In this case, the owners were responsible for keeping the handrail safe and the lighting system maintained. However, the handrail could not reasonably be considered dangerous provided there was light and the lack of light was caused by an unknown stranger taking out the light bulb. Consequently, the respondents did not fail in their duty as occupiers towards their visitors and were not liable.

Émilie may have been an illegitimate daughter of Napoleon I. LeRoy was daughter of a Lyon bookseller. Her husband was Henri (de) Pellapra, a rich financer. Émilie Pellapra claimed she was the natural daughter of Napoleon. This would have had to have been the result of an affair with her mother at the time of a stay by Napoleon in Lyon. This claim was that an affair took place in April 1805, whilst Napoleon was on the way to Italy to be crowned. But this date is incompatible with the birth of Émilie in November 1806. For Émilie to have been the daughter of Napoleon, it would have been necessary that he stayed in Lyon in February 1806. However, no stay in this city at that time seems to have taken place and, according to several authors (in particular André Gavoty in the Bulletin de l'Institut Napoleon April 1950), Napoleon only met LeRoy in 1810.

The observation tower provides 360-degree views of the surrounding area including the Shavers Fork River, Tygart Valley River valley, and the U.S. Route 33 crossing of Cheat Mountain. The tower is not handicapped-accessible. Other facilities A pit toilet is located at Bickle Knob. The site formerly featured a small picnic ground, which has since been removed. **pit toilet has been removed, as well. Access Bickle Knob is located at the end of Forest Route 91A, a spur from Stuart Memorial Drive (FR 91). Both roads are gravel but can easily be traversed by normal passenger cars.

He served mainly in the Western Theater and was killed in action during the Battle of Iuka. Early life and career Little was born in Baltimore, Maryland to Peter Little and his wife Catherine on Mar. 19, 1817. He was a brother-in-law of Alexander E. Steen and son-in-law of Pitcairn Morrison. Little was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 5th U.S. Infantry in 1839 after graduating from West Point. He served in the Mexican War and was awarded a brevet promotion to captain for his service at the Battle of Monterrey in 1846. He was promoted to captain in the regular army on August 20, 1847.Eicher, p. 350. American Civil War Little resigned his commission as a U.S. Army officer on May 7, 1861. He helped Sterling Price train the Missouri volunteers that soon joined the Southern armies. He entered the Confederate service as an infantry captain on March 16, 1861, but soon was made an artillery major that same month. Little was promoted to colonel on May 18 and served Price as his Adjutant General in the Missouri State Guard. At the Battle of Pea Ridge on March 7, 1862, Little commanded the 1st Missouri Brigade in Price's division. In the thick of the first day's fighting near Elkhorn Tavern, he demonstrated competence and initiative. \\"During the course of the battle he gradually assumed more and more responsibility until he became the de facto commander of Price's division during the last hours that the Army of the West was on the field.\\"Shea & Hess, p. 313. His appointment to brigadier general occurred on April 12.Boatner, p. 485. Little came east of the Mississippi River with Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn's army and served under Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard at Corinth. There, he caught malaria and was in poor health for the few remaining months of his life. Even so, he was regarded as \\"a thorough soldier and an excellent disciplinarian.\\"Cozzens, p. 39. At Corinth he was given command of the 1st Division in Price's Army of the West. His peers praised his division as well drilled and disciplined. He led his division at the Battle of Iuka on September 19.

Mendes was also the Chief Justice for the 2008–2010 term and the Attorney General from 2000 to 2002. He has been criticised by legal scholarshttps://www.jota.info/colunas/supra/o-inimigo-do- supremo-05062017 and journalistshttps://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/bernardomellofranco/2017/12/1944400-o-papai- noel-do-supremo.shtml for the supposedly opportunistic political motivations of his rulings, and mockedhttp://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/josesimao/2017/08/1912336-ueba- gilmar-solta-de-baciada.shtml for his alleged penchant for freeing powerful politicians suspected of corruption. In 2009, fellow Justice Joaquim Barbosa confrontedhttp://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,ministro-ataca-mendes- nao-esta-falando-com-seus-capangas,358909 him during a televised session of the Court, comparing him to a local criminal leader who commanded \\"thugs\\". He defends himself from criticism by arguing that he is a guardian of the rule of law and has always denied any wrongdoings. Early life Mendes was born in Diamantino, Mato Grosso. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in Law from University of Brasília, received his master's degree in Law from the same university, another master's degree in Law from University of Münster (Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster) with the dissertation \\"Presupposed Admissibility of the Abstract Norm Control in the Federal Constitutional Court\\" (Die Zulassigkeitsvoraussetzungen der abstrakten Normenkontrolle vor dem Bundesverfassungsgericht) and a PhD in Law from the same university with the thesis \\"Abstract Norm Control in the Federal Constitutional Court and the Brazilian Supremo Tribunal Federal (Die abstrakte Normenkontrolle vor dem Bundesverfassungsgericht und vor dem brasilianischen Supremo Tribunal Federal). Career as Supreme Court Justice Gilmar Mendes was assigned to the Supreme Court by presidente Fernando Henrique Cardoso. During his tenure, Mendes took the position of vice-Chief Justice (2006-2008) and then took oath as Chief Justice (2008-2010). Mendes was also president of the Nacional Justice Council (2008-2010), and implemented a national plan to modernize Brazilian Justice, which resulted in the judgement of 2.72 million old cases (dated before 2006). During his tenure, other measures were taken to enhance dynamism and efficiency in the Brazilian judicial system, such as the creation of the Electronic judicial process and the lower criminal and civil virtual courts, among others. In addition to his role as a leading judge, Mendes has contributed to doctrine and research, having published many books, articles and participated in academic events. Controversies, scandals and accusations of corruption Gilmar Mendes was the least supported nomination to the Supreme Court ever approved by the senate, with three times more senators voting against him than the next most rejected justice, . Shortly before confirmation, Mendes was accused of paying R$32K with funds from the Attorney General's office to a law school prep course owned by then-president Fernando Henrique Cardoso who he still served as attorney general at that time. In July 2008, Gilmar Mendes granted two habeas corpus to the Brazilian financier Daniel Dantas, investigated and arrested by the federal police in operation Satiagraha. Mr. Dantas was arrested and released by Gilmar Mendes' order twice in less than two days. Political bloggers and political personalities started to refer to him as \\"Gilmar Dantas\\" after that episode, highlighting his deep connections to the interests of Dantas. Shortly after the second habeas corpus, a group of 134 active federal judges and personalities signed a petition supporting the judge who had issued the arrest warranties against Dantas, judge , against Mendes' decision. In the same occasion, Mendes accused the Federal Police of tapping his phone, claiming that Brazil was becoming a police state under President Lula and his appointee for the federal police, . Gilmar Mendes was never able to show any evidence of the tapping, but the attention given the supposed scandal by the Brazilian media eventually ousted Lacerda from his position. Around the same time in 2008, the Brazilian weekly magazine CartaCapital published a piece on the scandals surrounding Gilmar Mendes, denouncing his connection with the law school prep course among other ethically dubious conduct from the justice, particularly paying R$8 million to buy his partner's share out in the endeavor as a way to silence him about how the institute was administered. Mr. Mendes sued the publication, saying that the article was \\"denigrating his public image\\" and \\"hurting his credibility\\". In November 2010, judge Adriana Sachsida Garcia, from the Tribunal of Justice of the State of São Paulo dismissed Mr. Mendes' claims. In August, 2012, Gilmar Mendes asked the Brazilian Federal Police to investigate wikipedia. According to the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo, he argues that the Portuguese language wikipedia's article showcasing his biography uses \\"journalistic sources\\" which are not adequate for an \\"informative article\\". The sources he referred to were from a weekly magazine that gathered denunciations of corruption involving him. In April 2013, Gilmar Mendes was again in controversy, blocking legislation that would have imposed checks and balances to the power of the Brazilian Supreme Court, claiming that the legislation would be unconstitutional. Never before in Brazilian history had the judiciary branch intervened to stop a law or constitutional amendment before it was even debated and approved by the people's representatives.

Patterson was originally drafted by the San Diego Padres in the third round of the amateur draft; however, he chose not to sign. In , the Giants took him in the 23rd round, and that time, he did choose to sign. Patterson began his professional career in with the Everett Giants. In 232 at-bats with them, he hit .250 with no home runs, 21 stolen bases and 26 RBI. After missing the 1989 season, Patterson collected 160 hits in 530 at- bats for a .302 batting average with the San Jose Giants in . In 131 games, he hit four home runs, scored 91 runs, drove 66 runs in and stole 29 bases. In , playing for the Shreveport Captains, Patterson hit .295 in 464 at-bats over 117 games. He also hit four home runs, drove in 56 RBI and stole 41 bases. Patterson made his big league debut on April 6, 1992 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He appeared in the game as a pinch runner for Robby Thompson. In 32 games in the majors in 1992, he hit .184 with five stolen bases. He played in 93 games with the Phoenix Firebirds that year as well, hitting .301 with 37 RBI and 22 stolen bases in 362 at-bats. The following year, he appeared in 16 games for the Giants, collecting three hits in 16 at-bats for a .188 average. In 16 games with the Firebirds that year, he hit .235 in 68 at-bats. He is best known for an unlikely home run he hit against the Atlanta Braves on September 1, 1993 in the heat of a pennant race between the Giants and Braves. Patterson had missed most of the season with a torn rotator cuff, and had only 68 at-bats in Single A San Jose. He was called up to the Major League club on September 1 when roster sizes expand from 25 to 40 and later that day was asked to pinch hit in the 9th inning, his first Major League at bat of the season, with the game tied at 2. He hit his first Major League home run off Mark Wohlers, who had not allowed a home run in exactly two years . His home run gave the Giants the win and a 4.5 game lead over the Braves in the National League West. The pennant race would go down to the final day of the season with the Braves winning by 1 game. In 1992, Patterson also has the dubious claim to fame of, while at bat during an exhibition game against the Anaheim Angels, fouling a pitch into the Angels dugout and hitting Matt Keough in the right temple nearly killing him and ending Keogh's playing career . Patterson appeared in 85 games for the Giants in 1994 95 games for them in 1995. He hit .238 and .205 and he stole 13 bases and three bases in those years, respectively.

In the United States, jury nullification occurs when a jury in a criminal case reaches a verdict contrary to the weight of evidence, sometimes because of a disagreement with the relevant law.\\"Jury nullification\\". Encarta dictionary. Microsoft Corporation. Archived from the original on 2009-11-01. Retrieved 2009-05-21. The American jury draws its power of nullification from its right to render a general verdict in criminal trials, the inability of criminal courts to direct a verdict no matter how strong the evidence, the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause, which prohibits the appeal of an acquittal, and the fact that jurors cannot be punished for the verdict they return. In practice The tradition of jury nullification in the United States has its roots in the British legal system, specifically in a 1670 English case where Quakers were acquitted by a jury of violating a law that permitted religious assemblies only under the Church of England. In 1735, journalist John Peter Zenger was acquitted in New York by a jury that nullified a law making it a crime to criticize public officials. Later, colonial juries nullified the Navigation Acts, which would have forced all trade with the colonies to pass through England for taxation. Just before the American Civil War, northern juries sometimes refused to convict for violations of fugitive slave laws because jurors felt the laws to be unjust. In 1851, 24 people were indicted for helping a fugitive escape from a jail in Syracuse, New York. The first four trials of the group resulted in three acquittals and one conviction, and the government dropped the remaining charges. Likewise, after a crowd broke into a Boston courtroom and rescued Anthony Burns, a slave, the grand jury indicted three of those involved, but after an acquittal and several hung juries, the government dropped the charges. During the 19th and 20th centuries, especially in the 1950s and '60s civil rights movement era, some all-white juries acquitted white defendants accused of murdering blacks, but the problem, according to some scholars, was \\"not in jury nullification, but in jury selection. The jury was not representative of the community\\". During Prohibition, juries often nullified alcohol control laws, possibly as often as 60% of the time, because of disagreements with the justice of the law. This resistance is considered to have contributed to the adoption of the Twenty-first Amendment repealing the Eighteenth Amendment which established Prohibition. Kalven's and Zeisel's study of the American jury found that juries acquitted when judges would have convicted in only 19% of cases, and of these, only 21% of the acquittals were attributable to jury nullification. Jury nullification sometimes takes the form of a jury convicting the defendant of lesser charges than the prosecutor sought. In the 21st century, many discussions of jury nullification center around drug laws that many consider unjust either in principle or because they disproportionately affect members of certain groups. A jury nullification advocacy group estimates that 3–4% of all jury trials involve nullification, and a recent rise in hung juries (from an average of 5% to nearly 20% in recent years) is seen by some as indirect evidence that juries have begun to consider the validity or fairness of the laws themselves (though other reasons such as the CSI effect may also be involved). In criminal cases, jury nullification arguments sometimes focus on the precise language of the jury instruction on burden of proof. Many jury instructions on burden of proof invite nullification arguments. According to these instructions juries must find the defendant not guilty if the case has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Conversely the jury should find the defendant guilty if the case has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The word \\"should\\" arguably allows juries to consider nullification arguments. It is also possible to receive a specific jury instruction on nullification, though most judges simply avoid the topic and do not tell jurors of their power to judge the fairness of the law and how it is applied as well as the facts of a case. During the Vietnam War era, many protestors, including Benjamin Spock, sought jury nullification. Spock was convicted of conspiracy to counsel, aid, and abet registrants to avoid the draft, after the judge instructed the jury to apply the law as he laid it down, but the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit overturned the conviction because the judge had committed prejudicial error in putting to the jury ten special yes-or-no questions. Eight defendants from Oakland, California, were tried in 1969 for conspiracy to disrupt a draft induction center, and the jury acquitted after being told by the judge that it could acquit if it felt the defendants' actions were protected by First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly. Likewise, in a case involving ten Seattle protestors accused of blocking a munitions train carrying bombs destined for Vietnam, the jury acquitted after the judge allowed the defendants to talk about their motives and permitted the defense to ask the jurors to invoke their consciences and object to the war by acquitting. The Camden 28 were acquitted despite overwhelming evidence of their guilt. In at least one case, the judge allowed the jury to hear testimony about the Pentagon Papers and the nature of the Vietnam War. In one Vietnam-era case, the defense compared the defendants' actions in breaking into a government office to the Boston Tea Party, saying that no one \\"would say that breaking into a ship shouldn't be criminal, shouldn't be a crime\\", but that it was justified under the circumstances. There was also a case in which a jury voted 9–3 to acquit peace activists despite their admission that they poured blood in a military recruiting center. Several cases that are speculated to be instances of jury nullification include the prosecution of Washington, D.C.'s former mayor Marion Barry; the trial of Lorena Bobbitt; the prosecution of the police officers accused of beating Rodney King; the prosecution of two men charged with beating Reginald Denny in the resulting riots; the trial of the surviving Branch Davidian members; the trial of the Menendez brothers for their parents' murder; and perhaps most famously, the O. J. Simpson murder case. In the days preceding Jack Kevorkian's trial for assisted suicide in Michigan, Kevorkian's lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, told the press that he would urge the jury to disregard the law. Prosecutors prevailed upon the judge to enter a pretrial order banning any mention of nullification during the trial, but Fieger's statements had already been extensively reported in the media. In a 1998 article, Vanderbilt University Law School Professor Nancy J. King wrote, \\"recent reports suggest jurors today are balking in trials in which a conviction could trigger a three strikes or other mandatory sentence, and in assisted suicide, drug possession, and firearms cases.\\" Court opinions In the 1794 case Georgia v. Brailsford, the Supreme Court directly tried a common law case before a jury. The facts in the case were not in dispute, and the legal opinion of the court was unanimous, but the Court was nonetheless obligated under the Seventh Amendment to refer the matter to the jury for a general verdict. Chief Justice John Jay's nuanced instructions to the jury have been cited frequently in discussions of jury nullification: Although no precedent revokes the power of nullification, since the 19th century courts have tended to restrain juries from considering it, and to insist on their deference to court-given law. The first major decision in this direction was Games v. Stiles ex dem Dunn,Games v. Stiles ex dem Dunn, which held that the bench could override the jury's verdict on a point of law. The 1895 decision Sparf v. United States,Sparf v. U.S. written by Justice John Marshall Harlan, held that a trial judge has no responsibility to inform the jury of its right to nullify laws. It was a 5–4 decision. Often cited, it has led United States judges to commonly penalize anyone who attempts to present legal argument to jurors and to declare a mistrial if such argument has been presented to them. In some states, jurors are likely to be struck from the panel during voir dire if they will not agree to accept as correct the rulings and instructions of the law as provided by the judge.\\"...the court can also attempt to prevent such an occurrence of juror nullification by (1) informing prospective jurors at the outset that jurors have no authority to disregard the law and (2) obtaining their assurance that they will not do so if chosen to serve on the jury.\\" People v. Estrada, 141 Cal.App.4th 408 (July 14, 2006. No. C047785). A 1969 Fourth Circuit decision, U.S. v. Moylan, affirmed the power of jury nullification but also upheld the power of the court to refuse to permit an instruction to the jury to this effect. Nevertheless, in upholding the refusal to permit the jury to be so instructed, the Court held that: In 1972, in United States v. Dougherty, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a ruling similar to Moylan that affirmed a jury's de facto power to nullify the law but upheld the denial of the defense's chance to inform the jury of that power. Then- chief judge David L. Bazelon wrote an opinion dissenting in part, arguing that the jury should be informed of its power to render a verdict according to its conscience if the law is unjust. He wrote that refusal to allow the jury to be so informed constitutes a \\"deliberate lack of candor\\". It has been argued that the denial of jury nullification requests negates much of the point of self- representation. In 1988, in U.S. v. Krzyske, the jury asked the judge about jury nullification. The judge responded, \\"There is no such thing as valid jury nullification.\\" The jury convicted the defendant. On appeal, the majority and the dissent agreed that the trial judge's instruction was untrue, but the majority held that this false representation was not a reversible error. In 1997, in U.S. v. Thomas, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that jurors can be removed if there is evidence that they intend to nullify the law, under Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 23(b). But the Second Circuit also held that the court must not remove a juror for an alleged refusal to follow the law as instructed unless the record leaves no doubt that the juror was engaged in deliberate misconduct—that he was not simply unpersuaded by the Government's case against the defendants. In 2001, a California Supreme Court ruling on a case involving statutory rape led to a new rule requiring jurors to inform the judge whenever a fellow juror appears to be deciding a case based on his or her dislike of a law. But the ruling cannot overturn the practice of jury nullification itself because of double jeopardy: a defendant who has been acquitted of a charge cannot be charged with it a second time, even if the court later learns jury nullification played a role in the verdict. The Supreme Court of the United States has not recently confronted the issue directly. Circa 1996, Laura Kriho was the sole juror holdout in a drug possession trial, one eventually declared a mistrial. Kriho was found in contempt of court and charged with perjury and obstruction of justice for learning from the Internet that the defendant could face a four- to 12-year prison term if convicted, a fact the court had not disclosed to the jury. Additionally, while not asked about her opinions about the fairness of the drug laws or her own legal history, she was prosecuted for obstruction of justice for failing to volunteer this information on her own. The trial court found \\"that Kriho had intended to obstruct the judicial process and that her actions had prevented the seating of a fair and impartial jury\\", but after four years of legal battles the charges were dropped when a district court ruled that her statements during secret jury deliberations could not be used against her. It has been argued that improved protection of the holdout juror is a necessary and critical component to the preservation of a defendant's right to a fair trial. In 2017, the Ninth Circuit upheld the first three sentences of a jury's instruction and overruled the last two. The jury instructions were: \\"You cannot substitute your sense of justice, whatever that means, for your duty to follow the law, whether you agree with it or not. It is not for you to determine whether the law is just or whether the law is unjust. That cannot be your task. There is no such thing as valid jury nullification. You would violate your oath and the law if you willfully brought a verdict contrary to the law given to you in this case.\\" But it deemed this a harmless error and affirmed the conviction. In 2020, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that handing out jury nullification brochures to prospective jurors outside a courthouse does not constitute jury tampering because the activity is not targeted at jurors for any specific case. Advocacy groups and notable proponents Ron Paul, a U.S. Representative and presidential candidate in 1988, 2008 and 2012, is a notable supporter of jury nullification and has written extensively on the historic importance of juries as finders of fact and law. Some advocacy groups and websites argue that private parties in cases where the government is the opponent have the right to have juries be instructed that they have the right and duty to render a verdict contrary to legal positions they believe to be unjust or unconstitutional.Fully Informed Jury AssociationThe Jury Rights ProjectThe Jury Education CommitteeConstitution Society These and other organizations contact citizens directly and lobby for legal reforms regarding instructions given to jurors. Jury scholar and attorney Clay Conrad argues that there is nothing wrong with jury nullification: it is part and parcel of what a jury is all about. Conrad extensively reviews cases of jury nullification in cases of racist juries acquitting in cases of pro-segregation violence. The racist communities that produced the racist juries had also elected racist police, prosecutors, and judges. Such cases were rarely prosecuted at all, and when they were, due to outside political pressure, only the minimum effort to go through the motions of a trial was made, with jury selection systems crafted by political leaders to exclude non-whites. Reviewing Conrad's book, University of Tennessee law professor Glenn Reynolds wrote that jury nullification is parallel with the doctrine of prosecutorial discretion. The late Chief Justice of the Washington State Supreme Court William C. Goodloe was an advocate of jury nullification and suggested that the following instruction be given by judges to all juries in criminal cases: The United States Libertarian Party's platform states, \\"We assert the common-law right of juries to judge not only the facts but also the justice of the law.\\" Some see jury nullification as one of the so-called four boxes of liberty. Notable criminal prosecutions Julian P. Heicklen – Teaneck, New Jersey – Fall 2010 In the fall of 2010 Julian P. Heicklen of Teaneck, New Jersey, a jury nullification activist who had made a regular practice of handing out information about jury nullification outside courthouses, was charged in federal court in Manhattan with jury tampering, a misdemeanor. He has previously been cited several times for distributing fliers without a permit outside the Federal Courthouse in Manhattan. Heicklen, a retired chemistry professor, was arraigned February 25, 2011 before a magistrate judge. The maximum penalty is 6 months' incarceration. Because Heicklen was charged with a misdemeanor, he was not entitled to a jury trial. The statute under which Heicklen was charged, Title 18 USC Section 1504, reads in pertinent part: A federal judge dismissed the case against Heicklen on April 19, 2012. Keith Wood – Mecosta County, Michigan – November 24, 2015 On November 24, 2015, Keith Wood was arrested and charged with felony obstruction of justice and misdemeanor jury tampering after he handed out fliers, stating that jurors have the right to practice jury nullification, on the sidewalk in front of the Mecosta County, Michigan, courthouse. The felony charge was dismissed. He was convicted on the misdemeanor jury tampering charge in a jury trial in which Mecosta County Circuit Judge Kimberly Booher ruled against arguing a first amendment defense. On July 28, 2020, the Michigan Supreme Court overturned Wood's conviction. Opponents James Wilson, founding father and one of the leading legal theorists of the day, was one of the only sources from the era that addressed jury nullification. He defended the jury's right to render a general verdict (to determine the law as well as the fact). However, in rendering that verdict, he asserted that juries must \\"determine those questions, as judges must determine them, according to law.\\" He noted that the law was \\"governed by precedents, and customs, and authorities, and maxims,\\" that are \\"alike obligatory upon jurors as upon judges, in deciding questions of law.\\" In essence, Wilson was arguing that juries must not disregard the law because laws are the result of due process by legal representatives of the people.James Wilson, \\"Of the Constituent Parts of Courts – Of the Juries,\\" in The Works of James Wilson, Volume II, edited by Robert Green McCloskey, (Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1967), 542. A notable opponent of jury nullification is former judge and unsuccessful Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork. In an essay he wrote jury nullification is a \\"pernicious practice\\". Some have argued that it is not sufficient to instruct jurors that they may judge the law if legal arguments are not made to them, that such incomplete information may indeed do more harm than good, and that we must return to the standard of due process represented by the Stettinius and Fenwick cases. Some alleged costs of jury nullification include inconsistent verdicts and discouraging of guilty pleas. There is some question as to whether jury nullification should be disallowed in cases where there is an identifiable crime victim. Jury nullification has more support among legal academics than judges. Jury nullification has also been criticized for having resulted in the acquittal of whites who victimized blacks in the Deep South. David L. Bazelon argued, \\"One often-cited abuse of the nullification power is the acquittal by bigoted juries of whites who commit crimes (lynching, for example) against blacks. That repellent practice cannot be directly arrested without jeopardizing important constitutional protections-the double jeopardy bar and the jury's power of nullification. But the revulsion and sense of shame fostered by that practice fueled the civil rights movement, which in turn made possible the enactment of major civil rights legislation. That same movement spurred on the revitalization of the equal protection clause and, in particular, the recognition of the right to be tried before a jury selected without bias. The lessons we learned from these abuses helped to create a climate in which such abuses could not so easily thrive.\\" However, Julian Heicklen disputed this: \\"The problem with the all-white juries that refused to convict whites that committed crimes against blacks was not in jury nullification, but in jury selection. The jury was not representative of the community and would not provide a fair and impartial trial.\\" Leipold points out that to argue that nullification prevents unfair prosecutions is to argue that it is unfair to convict a defendant when a representative legislature has passed a statute making a certain behavior a crime, the evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant engaged in that behavior, and the accused has no defense to the charge.

From July 27, 1918 to February 20, 1919, Ishkhanian headed the People's Government of Karabakh (subsequently renamed the Karabakh Council). Subsequently, he was elected to be vice-president of the National Council. Early life Yeghishe Ishkhanian was born in the capital city Shusha (local name: Shushi). He was the son of Hovhanes-Bek Ishkhanian, a civil servant in the Customs and Excise, a well- known man in Nagrono-Karabakh and a close friend of Armenian bishop Vahan Ter- Georgian. Ishkhanian received his primary and secondary education in Shusha and graduated from Yerevan's Diocesan School. After that, he left for Petrograd, where he studied at the Agronomic High School until the February Revolution of 1917. Back to home In May 1917, Ishkhanian returned to Shusha and actively participated in the organization of the social order and the establishment of a self-government in Nagorno-Karabakh. On 24 December 1917 he was elected to be vice-president of the Interparty Bureau (the Provisional Government). Simultaneously he was appointed as member of the Armenian-Tatar Committee (which had the chief task to maintain peaceful coexist between the Armenian majority and the Azeri minority in Nagorno- Karabakh, particularly in Shusha). On July 27, 1918, when the 1st Karabakh Congress elected the People's Government of Karabakh (an independent government in Nagorno Karabakh during 1918-1920), Ishkhanian was elected prime minister. Administration The administration of Ishkhanian (1918–1919) was full of political vicissitudes. First the Transcaucasus was occupied by the Ottoman Turks, next the Britain military mission took command there. As the head of the People's Government of Karabakh, Yeghishe Ishkhanian had to enter to negotiations with the new commanders of the region, as well with the government of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan. Moreover, The People's Government of Karabakh faced an influx of about 3.000 Armenian refugees from the Armenian Genocide and about 5.000 from the village Berdadzor (in the Lachin corridor), which was attacked by Azeri forces in August 1918. However, they saw as the greatest threat for Nagorno-Karabakh was the government of Azerbaijan's attempts to annex Nagorno-Karabakh. Being a co-editor of the government's official newspaper \\"Artsakh\\", Ishkhanian wrote an article on March 7, 1919, entitled \\"Get your bloody hands off\\". In his speech in the 4th Karabakh Congress Ishkhanian expressed his concern thus: Exile But the new rulers of Transcaucasia were unable to deal with the recalcitrant republic. On October 1, 1918, the Ottoman Turks arrested many of the members of the Government, including Yeghishe Ishkhanian. During the interrogation, not obtaining what they wanted to get from him, they beat him up. The Britain Mission, which followed the Ottoman Turks, brought in fact no better condition for Nagorno-Karabakh, moreover it helped Khosrov bey Sultanov to get authority over Nagorno-Karabakh. In April 1919 general Shatelwort tried for the last time to persuade the 5th Karabakh Congress to \\"temporary recognize the Azerbaijani jurisdiction\\", but in vain. On June 5, 1919, Ishkhanian, along with two other government leaders, was banished from Shusha. In Armenia Following his expulsion, Ishkhanian lived in the Democratic Republic of Armenia. He met with the country's government leaders, in particular Hamo Ohanjanyan, and hold discussion about the Karabakh-issue. In July he went to Vayots Dzor, and was appointed as secretary of the regional executive branch. He remained there until 1920 and worked with Drastamat Kanayan, Garegin Nzhdeh and others. In April 1920, after the Bolsheviks had suppressed the February Uprising, many Armenian politicians and officers moved to Syunik. In 1921, after the fall of Mountain-Armenia, they crossed the river Arax and escaped to Iran. Among them was Yeghishe Ishkhanian. Journal Ishkhanian spent the rest of his life in New York City. In 1966 he recounted the events of 1917–1920 in a journal. He remembered with inspiration the government they had formed, where statesmen of different political ideas worked together, but with pain and regret - the next tragic developments in Nagorno-Karabakh, the destruction and the Shusha pogrom, (at the time he had been in Karakilisa), where among many others, his parents were killed.

He was a son of Emperor Xuanzong, and after the general An Lushan had rebelled against Emperor Xuanzong's rule in 755, Li Lin tried to occupy the region south of the Yangtze River and establish a separate regime, but was defeated and killed.  Background  It is not known when Li Ze was born.However, it is known that his older brother Li Jiao (李璬), who was the 13th son, was born in 718, and given that Li Ze was himself created the Prince of Yong in 725, he must have been born during that time period. It is known, however, that he was the 16th of Emperor Xuanzong's 30 sons, and that his mother Consort Guo was the younger sister of the military governor (jiedushi) Guo Xuji (郭虛己). Consort Guo died when Li Ze was only a few years old, and Li Ze was raised by his older brother Li Sisheng; it was said that at night, Li Sisheng would hold Li Ze in his arms. Li Ze was said to be intelligent in his youth, but was ugly in appearance and had strabismus. In 725, Emperor Xuanzong created Li Ze the Prince of Yong, and in 727 gave him the honorary title as the commandant at Jing Prefecture (荊州, roughly modern Jingzhou, Hubei). In 732, he was given the additional honorific title of Kaifu Yitong Sansi (開府儀同三司), and his name was changed to Li Lin.  Rebellion  In 755, the general An Lushan rebelled, and by 756 was approaching the Tang capital Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xuanzong to flee toward Jiannan Circuit (劍南, roughly modern Sichuan and Chongqing, headquartered) with his family—although Li Sisheng (whose name had by now been changed to Li Heng and who was crown prince) did not follow Emperor Xuanzong to Jiannan Circuit but instead went to Lingwu and was declared emperor there (as Emperor Suzong). Meanwhile, though, Emperor Xuanzong, who had not known that Emperor Suzong had taken imperial title, continued to issue edicts as emperor, and on August 15, 756,兩千年中西曆轉換 he issued an edict giving Li Heng and three other sons of his—Li Lin and his younger brothers Li Qi (李琦) the Prince of Sheng and Li Gong (李珙) the Prince of Feng—responsibility zones for them to command over, with Li Heng in overall command. (Li Qi and Li Gong, however, did not actually report to their command areas.) Li Lin's responsibility area were Shannan East (山南東道, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), Lingnan (headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), Qianzhong (黔中, headquartered in modern Chongqing), and Jiangnan West (江南西道, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) Circuits, with the officials Dou Shao (竇紹) and Li Xian as his assistants, and his headquarters set at Jiangling. Later, when Emperor Xuanzong heard about Emperor Suzong's ascension, he recognized Emperor Suzong as emperor and himself took the title of Taishang Huang (retired emperor). With the empire's transportation network disrupted by An's rebellion, the taxes and levies of the region south of the Huai River were all sent to Jiangling, allowing Li Lin access to a great amount of wealth and ability to conscript tens of thousands of soldiers. His son Li Yang (李瑒) the Prince of Xiangcheng was said to be brave and studied in military matters, and his strategist Xue Liu (薛鏐) suggested to him that given the amount of wealth and territory he had, he should occupy Jinling (金陵, modern Nanjing), take over all of the territory south of the Yangtze River, and establish a separate regime similar to Eastern Jin. When Emperor Suzong heard this, he issued an order that Li Lin return to Chengdu to accompany Emperor Xuanzong, but Li Lin refused. This alarmed Li Xian, who claimed to be ill and resigned, and then reported to Emperor Suzong's then-location at Pengyuan (彭原, in modern Qingyang, Gansu). Both he and another official, Gao Shi (高適), then proposed strategies to stop Li Lin's plan. Around the new year 757, Emperor Suzong commissioned Gao as the military governor of Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), and another general, Lai Tian (來瑱), as the military governor of Huainan West Circuit (淮南西道, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan), and instructed them to, along with Wei Zhi (韋陟) the military governor of Jiangdong Circuit (江東, headquartered in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu), to prepare to resist Li Lin. On January 19, 757,兩千年中西曆轉換 Li Lin, without any imperial permission, left Jiangling with a fleet, heading east on the Yangtze. Li Xiyan (李希言) the governor of Wu Commandery (roughly modern Suzhou) then sent him a letter that treated him as an equal and addressed him by name, inquiring as for the reason for him to be heading east. Li Lin, in anger, replied in a letter: Li Lin then ordered his generals Hun Weiming (渾惟明) to attack Li Xiyan, and Ji Guangchen (季廣琛) to attack Li Chengshi (李成式) the secretary general of Guangling Commandery (廣陵, roughly modern Yangzhou). He himself advanced to Dangtu (當塗, in modern Ma'anshan, Anhui). Li Xiyan sent his subordinates Yuan Jingyao (元景曜) and Yan Jingzhi (閻敬之) and Li Chengshi sent his subordinate Li Chengqing (李承慶) to resist Li Lin, but Li Lin's forces killed Yan, and Yuan and Li Chengqing surrendered to Li Lin. Meanwhile, Gao, Lai, and Wei rendezvoused at Anlu (安陸, in modern Xiaogan, Hubei) and public declared their intent to suppress Li Lin's rebellion. Meanwhile, Li Lin had taken position in a city.None of the main traditional historical sources reporting Li Lin's rebellion mentioned which city this was. The modern Chinese historian Bo Yang opined that it was probably Zhenjiang. See the Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 53 [757]. The forces of the general Li Xian (李銑, note different character than Li Lin's former assistant) and Li Chengshi converged on the city, stopping north of the Yangtze River. In light of the pressure, Li Lin's subordinates Ji, Hun, and Feng Jikang (馮季康) deserted him. That night, when Li Xian's and Li Chengshi's forces lit torches to try to intimidate Li Lin, Li Lin's forces responded by lighting torches as well, but Li Lin, when he saw his own forces' torches, mistakenly thought that Li Xian's and Li Chengshi's forces had already crossed the Yangtze, and he panicked, fleeing out of the city at night, only returning in the day. He then took his remaining forces and headed east on ships. Li Chengshi's subordinate Zhao Kan (趙侃) gave chase, catching Li Lin at Xinfeng (新豐, in modern Changzhou, Jiangsu), defeating Li Yang and Li Lin's general Gao Xianqi (高仙琦) and causing Li Lin's forces to collapse. Li Lin and Gao fled to Poyang (鄱陽, in modern Shangrao, Jiangxi) and gathered military supplies there, intending to flee to Lingnan. Huangfu Shen (皇甫侁) the examiner of Jiangnan West Circuit gave chase and captured Li Lin. He then secretly put Li Lin to death.That Huangfu put Li Lin to death was per the accounts in the New Book of Tang and the Zizhi Tongjian. Li Lin's biography in the Old Book of Tang indicated that Li Lin was killed in battle. Li Yang was killed in battle. Li Lin's surviving family members were delivered to Chengdu. Emperor Suzong, because of the love he had for Li Lin, chose not to publicly declare Li Lin a rebel, and when he found out that Huangfu had put Li Lin to death, he relieved Huangfu from his office and never gave him another one. Li Lin's sons Li Zan (李儹), Li Zhen (李偵), Li Xuan (李儇), Li Ling (李伶), and Li Yi (李儀) were allowed to keep their titles.

The street was developed over the 19th century with a succession of high-quality houses. This cluster of seven well- preserved houses was built primarily in the 1850s; two Colonial Revival houses, one at #337 built in 1887, the other at #340 built in 1897, were the only ones built later. Stylistically the other five are a diverse representation of revival styles popular in the mid-19th century, with only the Italianate style represented twice (by #341–43 and #336). One of the more notable residents in the district was Samuel B. Rindge, a merchant and banker who was father to Frederick H. Rindge, a major benefactor of the city. The Rindges lived at #342–44, a Second Empire house. Several houses were designed by architects, and the design for at least one, the Gothic Revival house at #338, came from a pattern book.

He possessed one of the best dramatic voices of the 1930s and 1940s. Initially a racing car driver and mechanic at the Citroën car company, his voice was discovered while he was serving in the military. He studied singing in Paris with the eminent former tenors Léon David and Léon Escalais and made his debut in Rouen as Cavaradossi in Tosca in 1931. During the 1932-33 season he debuted at both the Palais Garnier and the Opéra-Comique, where he won considerable acclaim as Don José in Carmen, a role he sang an estimated 500 times during his career. He sang widely in Europe, spending much of 1935-37 in Italy, appearing in Florence, Turin and Verona but mostly at the Rome Opera. He also appeared at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden, the Monte Carlo Opera, the Liceo in Barcelona and other European venues. He made his South American debut at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires in 1936, and sang in the United States at the Lyric Opera of Chicago during the 1937-38 season. Luccioni had an impressively large voice that combined beauty with power, in the tradition of his great French predecessor at the Paris Opéra, Paul Franz (1876–1950). He was also a fine singing-actor. Notable roles of his included Roland, Samson, Vasco, Jean, Turiddu, Canio, Chenier, Radames and Otello. He also appeared in a few motion pictures, including Colomba (1947) and Le bout de la route (1948). After retirement, he served as Director of the Opéra de Nice. His son, Jacques Luccioni, was also an opera singer, first as a tenor and later as a baritone. Luccioni died in the South of France shortly before his 75th birthday. He left a sizeable legacy of recordings made during his vocal prime. A wide selection of these recordings are available on CD. They confirm Luccioni's reputation as being one of the finest ever French dramatic tenors.

From March 2008 to September 2012, he served as provincial governor of Helmand province. Life Mangal was born in Laja Mangal, Paktia Province in Afghanistan, and belongs to the Mangal ethnic Pashtun tribe. He acquired his bachelor's and master's degree in literature from Kabul University.[1] A former member of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, Mangal started his career as a young military officer on the request of the Afghanistan government. He served in the Ministry of Defence from 1979 to 1989, holding the title up to colonel. He worked as a manager for Publicity and Public Awareness of Afghanistan National Army. Later, Mangal joined the insurrection fighting in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

From October 2016, he has been serving as the senior adviser minister of borders and tribal affairs for the president of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. He is also actively involved in tribal conflict resolutions.  Attempts on his life  According to The New York Times, Mangal has faced at least fourth attempts on his life. In October 2006, Mangal's convoy was struck by a bomb attack east of Kabul, for which the Taliban claimed responsibility, narrowly missing him, killing one provincial official. In May 2008, while flying into Musa Qala with a British escort to dedicate a new mosque, the CH-47 Chinook helicopter in which he was flying was hit by rocket fire. In February 2009, two U.S. soldiers who were part of a convoy of coalition troops accompanying Mangal to a village where he intended to talk to residents about alternatives to opium farming were killed along with three Afghans, including a police official, while trying to disable a roadside bomb. In April 2010, three Italian citizens and six Afghans who worked at a hospital run by the Italian charity Emergency in the capital of Helmand Province, Lashkar Gah were detained, suspected of having planned suicide attacks. According to Mangal, he was the target of the planned attacks that would have killed many more people as well. Afghan authorities claimed the detainees later confessed, but the Taliban denied hiring any foreign aid workers,Afghanistan: 'No collusion' between Taliban and aid hospital and they were later released without charges.Official Press Release from EMERGENCY The hospital staff had become unpopular with local officials, as they had a reputation for treating wounded Taliban fighters.  Wikileaks cables  In the WikiLeaks cables released in 2010, Mangal was cited as one of the officials in Afghanistan who criticised the British. According to U.S. cables of January 2009, Mangal accused the British of doing too little to interact with the local community, telling a U.S. team led by Vice-President Joe Biden that he did not “have anything against them (the British) but they must leave their bases and engage with the people.” As reported by The New York Times, the Wikileaks cables confirm that Mangal is considered an effective governor by foreign diplomats, and that he only kept his job as governor in Helmand Province thanks to “a concerted effort by the British, backed up by NATO allies”, when President Hamid Karzai wanted to replace him with a “tribal power broker with unsavory connections”.

The Thouet rises at Secondigny, close to the source of the Sèvre Nantaise, and joins the Loire just to the west of Saumur. It is long, and drains an area of . The river's name derives from the ancient Gallic word for tranquil. Course of the river Stepping stones on the Thouet above Thouars The château rises from the river at Thouars The Thouet downstream of Montreuil-Bellay The Thouet rises in the Gâtine Vendéenne, the most southern outcrop of the Armorican Massif, at altitude. The Armorican Massif is made up of volcanic and metamorphic rocks dating back to the Paleozoic era. This impermeable land does not result in any important aquifers but is an area of significant rainfall runoff. From the source to Parthenay the river flows in a generally east-west direction. To the east of Parthenay, the river turns north and flows on a generally northward heading for the rest of its course. Between Saint-Loup-Lamairé and Thouars, the river flows onto the Paris Basin, an area of sedimentary rocks where successive marine deposits of periods from the Triassic to the Pliocene were laid down. The nature of the rocks here allows the formation of an aquifer whose water reserves support the river in times of low flow. In order downstream, the Thouet flows through: * Secondigny * Azay-sur-Thouet * le Tallud * Parthenay * Châtillon-sur-Thouet * Gourgé * Saint-Loup-Lamairé * Airvault * Saint-Généroux * Missé * Thouars * Taizon * Saint-Martin-de-Sanzay * Montreuil-Bellay * Saint-Just-sur-Dive * Saumur The principal tributaries of the River Thouet are: * The Viette, at Parthenay on the right bank * The Palais, at Parthenay on the left bank * The Cébron, at Saint-Loup-Lamairé on the left bank * The Thouaret, near Taizé on the left bank * The Argenton, at Saint-Martin-de- Sanzay on the left bank * The Losse, at Montreuil-Bellay on the right bank * The Dive, at Saint-Just-sur-Dive on the right bank. For much of its length, the Thouet is paralleled by the GR 36 long-distance walking route, which connects Ouistreham, on the coast of the English Channel, with Bourg-Madame, on the border with Spain. This stretch of the path traces the footsteps of pilgrims from Brittany and Normandy on their way to Santiago de Compostela, and in places crosses the river using the same fords, packhorse bridges and stepping stones the pilgrims would have used. Navigation The Thouet was once navigable between its confluence with the Loire and Montreuil-Bellay. The first mention of navigation on the river dates from 1430 when an assembly of merchants in Saumur suggested the creation of a navigation over this stretch of the river, requiring the creation of passages through three mill weirs. It is possible that boats were already carrying goods on the river before that date, the cargo being transferred between boats at each obstacle. King Charles VII authorised the start of work by letters patent, financing the work by allowing the lords of Montreuil-Bellay to raise a tax on wine that would pass through their land. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the passage through the weirs probably took the form of flash locks. The later pound lock may have been introduced towards the end of the 16th century, and it is known that three pound locks were in use on the river by 1608. A project to make the river navigable up to Thouars was proposed in 1746 but was never executed. The Dive, a tributary of the Thouet, was canalised in 1834 to create the Canal de la Dive. As part of this development, two modern pound locks with straight sides and mitred gates were built on the Thouet, downstream of the confluence with the Dive. A third modern lock was built at the same time on the Thouet, but upstream from the confluence of the Dive. These locks had dimensions of length, width, and a draught of . However the new navigation soon faced competition from better roads and the railway, which appeared in the region in 1874. The maximum boat size imposed by the locks proved insufficient, and a proposed enlargement to the larger Freycinet gauge was never realized. The last commercial navigation on the river was in 1920.

Archaeology Blackwater Draw contains an important archaeological site that was first recognized in 1929 by Ridgley Whiteman of Clovis, New Mexico. Blackwater Locality No. 1 (29RV2; LA3324) is the type-site of the Clovis culture. The first large-scale excavation occurred in 1932, though local residents had been collecting bone and lithic materials for decades. Evidence of \\"fluted\\" points, spearheads now known as Clovis points (a New World invention) and other stone and bone weapons, tools, and processing implements were found at the archaeological site. The Clovis points were lanceolate and often, though not always, longer than Folsom points. The Clovis-age artifacts are in association with the remains of extinct Late Pleistocene megafauna, including mammoth, camel, horse, bison, saber-toothed cat, sloths, and dire wolf that were hunted by the early peoples who visited the site. Generations of some of the earliest New World inhabitants hunted and camped at Blackwater Draw, creating stratified levels of archaeological remains from many different time periods, including Clovis, Folsom, Midland, Agate Basin, and various Archaic period occupants. Clovis chipped stone technology is currently one of the oldest and most widespread chipped stone technologies recognized in the New World; radiocarbon dates on sediment from the Clovis layers at Blackwater Draw average around 11,290 years before the present. Two of the projectile points from Blackwater Draw were used as the type specimens to define Clovis chipped stone technology in the 1930s. The archaeological site is known for its well-defined and dated stratigraphic horizons that exhibit numerous cultural sequences. The sequences begin with the some of the earlier New World peoples and continue through the southwestern archaic, and into the historic period. Investigations at Blackwater Draw have recovered protein residue on Clovis weapons, indicating their use as hunting and possibly butchering tools on extinct Pleistocene animals. Towards the end of the Pleistocene period, the climate began to change, which brought warmer and drier weather, causing the water flow in the region to dramatically decrease. This decrease caused small seasonal lake basins called playas to form. These areas became popular hunting locations for early North Americans. Since its discovery, the Blackwater Locality No. 1 site has been a focal point for scientific investigations by academic institutions and organizations from across the country. The Carnegie Institute, Smithsonian Institution, Academy of Natural Sciences, National Science Foundation, United States National Museum, National Geographic Society, and more than a dozen major universities either have funded or participated in research at Blackwater Draw. Eastern New Mexico University owns and manages the excavations and visitations at the site. The Anderson Basin district around Blackwater Draw in Roosevelt County, near Clovis and Portales was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961Note: A National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination document should be available upon request from the National Park Service for this site, but it is not available on-line from the NPS Focus site . and incorporated into the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. Blackwater Draw Museum The original Blackwater Draw Museum was first opened to the public in 1969, at 42987 Highway 70, Clovis, New Mexico primarily to display artifacts uncovered at the Blackwater Locality No. 1 site. The artifacts and displays illustrated life at the site during the Clovis period (over 13,000 years ago) through the recent historic period. In 2017, the museum moved onto the Eastern New Mexico University campus, and expanded its focus to incorporate local history, as well as archaeology on a broad scale. Exhibits now include descriptions of archaeological work, different archaeological sites, cultural complexes, and scientific methods, among other topics. As of August 2017, Blackwater Draw is under the direction of Dr. Brendon Asher of ENMU in Portales.

Plot synopsis  Jared Mercer and Cheryl Gannett are second bests at their school, so they decide to form a club consisting of their school's other second bests; Jason, Karin, Abbie, Darren, and Randall. Their club is called the Shadow Club, consisting of other students who also consider themselves to be \\"in the shadows\\" of people who are better than them at the things they are good at. They start out by pulling pranks to humiliate their enemies, the \\"unbeatable\\". However, their pranks quickly escalate, to the point of becoming dangerous. In addition, the most recent pranks were not carried out by the Shadow Club at all and the club members believe that they are being framed by Tyson, their school's biggest underachiever and pyromaniac. The pranks climax when Jared's biggest enemy, Austin Pace (nicknamed L'Austin sPace), a student training to be an Olympic racer, is permanently injured. After this even, the members of the Shadow Club gather to discuss their problem and decide that their only solution is to force a confession out of Tyson in the worst way possible; by punching, kicking, and pushing him, and even by trying to drown him. After he almost dies, they let him run off, and return to their meeting place, which they called \\"Stonehenge.\\" Meanwhile, Jared, who has taken part in half of Tyson's interrogation, discovers that it was not Tyson who pulled the pranks, it was the members of the Shadow Club, each acting independently, so that none of the others knew of their actions, and each of them truly believed that they pulled one prank, but that Tyson did the rest. Realizing their mistake, Jared rushes back to find the members of the club in Stonehenge, all with horrified looks on their faces.

Plot Robin the Frog is delighted that he and the Muppets are finally going on a vacation. His hopes are dashed, however, when he learns that rather than Krakatoa or England, their destination is a 'run-down, old castle in the middle of nowhere'. His Uncle Kermit reminds him that they had to accompany Dr. Bunsen Honeydew on this journey to hear the reading of his uncle's will, emphasizing the value of friendship. After becoming frightened of his surroundings and the door of the castle being opened by a mysterious figure, Robin fainted. Robin the Frog is awoken by Pepe the King Prawn, Beaker and Dr. Bunsen Honeydew in some sort of underground laboratory. Dr. Bunsen Honeydew explains that the laboratory belonged to his late uncle and that after Robin fainted, the group of Muppets was ambushed and many of them transformed into monsters by the castle's 'evil energy'. In addition, the castle's energy has begun to permeate the nearby village causing it to become twisted and evil. Robin the Frog asks what can be done, and Honeydew presents him with a special 'Power Glove' that takes evil from monsters and stores it in a backpack. Informing him that the glove will only work with \\"the amphibian anatomy,\\" he sends Robin on his way to collect evil energy from the village and try to save the Muppets from being monsters forever. Robin embarks on his adventure with assistance from Pepe, who transmits important information to him at key points in the game. Other Muppet cameos include The Swedish Chef (who requires ingredients to be collected) Rizzo the Rat (who has a Muppet Token and teases Robin to come and get it in numerous levels), and Beaker himself (who appears with a jetpack on his back that can be used to destroy obstacles in Robin's way). He is able to travel wherever he pleases using the \\"Hub\\" (a portal to all the areas of the village) as long as he has collected enough evil energy, Robin initially fights his way through the innards and grounds of the Castle von Honeydew itself, facing its corrupt knights and guards, before defeating (and thereby rescuing) Gonzo who has turned into the vampire \\"Noseferatu.\\" Next, Robin ventures into the outskirts of the village nicknamed \\"The Deadlands\\" where he encounters villainous pirates and reanimated skeletons. Robin defeats the \\"Wocka Wocka Wearbear\\" and transforming him back into Fozzie Bear. Robin is able to advance to the forests around the village called \\"Neverleave Forest.\\" After avoiding falling prey to transmogrified hunters and evil pumpkin farmers, Robin must fight his own Uncle Kermit to save him from an eternity as \\"Ker-Monster\\" (a spoof of Frankenstein's monster). Having done this, Robin moves into the river-dwelling and Arab quarters of the village before doing away with the fearsome Muck Monster who transforms back into Clifford. With over half the village now saved and purified, Robin moves into Madness Marsh, a treacherous region of the village which is home to its heavily armed hiking community, as well as ravenous piranha, puffer fish, and hungry crocodiles. Robin dispatches them in short order and comes to face the fearsome \\"Ghoul-friend of Ker- Monster\\" (a thinly veiled parody of Bride of Frankenstein) and initiates her transformation back into Miss Piggy. Having now gained access to the village's more mountainous regions, Robin battles through what is locally called \\"The Whatsamatterhorn,\\" defeating all manner of foes including a group of violent monks. Having saved his friends and believing his journey to be complete, Robin returns to the center of the castle only to find one final enemy awaiting him....Baron Petri von Honeydew himself (who has the appearance of Erik from The Phantom of the Opera). Robin manages to turn the Baron's projectiles against him and finally lays his mad soul to rest. Having achieved all this in such a short space of time, Robin succumbs to another faint. He is awoken once again by Dr. Bunsen Honeydew. This time however, all the other Muppets are with him and seemingly unchanged. He is also lying in the hallway of the Castle itself, where the butler Chives (the figure who opened the door) has led the group of Muppets. Robin exclaims that he has had the most amazing dream and describes his adventure to all those present, who assure him it was indeed a dream. However, as he and the group ascend the stairs and pass a painting of the late Baron von Honeydew, the painting appears to move and say 'shush' to Robin as the Power Glove suddenly appears on Robin's hand again, indicating his adventure may well have been something more than a dream after all.Muppet Monster Adventure, released 2000 Gameplay The game draws heavily on PlayStation standard platformers of its day, most prominently Spyro (with which it shared a sound designer, Michael Gollom). Other notable inspirations are Crash Bandicoot (Robin's spin attack is identical in execution to Crash's), Croc, and Super Mario 64 (the game's swimming system was described as 'intuitive' and compared favourably with Mario's 'flying underwater' style controls In a review of Super Mario Sunshine the reviewer reflected on that game's poor swimming mechanic, remarking on how MMA and SM64 had done better.). Despite some fundamental similarities in controls and platforming setpieces used, the game was praised for the array of context- specific transformations that Robin can perform. Inspired by the transformations the Muppets themselves undergo, Robin is able to use their abilities (by taking on their appearance) once he has collected all four pieces of an amulet bearing the relevant Muppet's face. Noseferatu's amulet grants Robin the power to glide, the Wocka Wocka Werebear's enables him to climb, the Muck Monster's allows him to dive underwater, Ker-monster's permits him to push and pull large blocks, and the amulet bearing the Ghoul-friend of Ker-monster gives him the ability to perform door-smashing karate chops. The mechanisms by which the game progresses are relatively simplistic. Each level requires a certain amount of 'evil energy' (dropped by enemies and scattered freely around all levels) to open it, and only three may be unlocked before a boss has to be fought. Bosses, however, do not require the collection of evil energy but instead need 'Muppet Tokens', a gaming MacGuffin similar to Super Mario 64's Power Stars that resemble a golden block shaped like Kermit's head. Once a set number of these have been collected (some are found scattered around levels while others require the completion of certain minigames), the boss is accessible and can be defeated, opening up the next stage of the game.

GameSpots Scott Steinberg called it 'surprisingly polished and enjoyable', but was unimpressed by the game's sound effects and 'forgettable' soundtrack. Jeremy Conrad of IGN disagreed with Steinberg's verdict on the soundtrack, deeming it 'probably the best part of the entire game', but found the gameplay 'isn't really anything we haven't seen before'.

Her environmental meteorology experience is most evident in her Insider Duology: Inside Out and Outside In. In this science fiction series, the people are living inside a giant metal cube and have lost track of what's outside their world. In order for the people to survive living inside a closed environment, Snyder used her knowledge of air scrubbers and waste-water treatment plants to create a world that is scientifically accurate. As a mother of two children, Snyder hates when her kids are sick and wishes she could heal them with a touch. This desire led to her Healer Series, where Avry of Kazan can heal people by touching them, however the injury or sickness transfers to Avry, who heals at an accelerated rate. The Healer Series has three books, Touch of Power, Scent of Magic and Taste of Darkness. In February 2015, Snyder returned to the main characters of the Study Series and released the first book of her next trilogy, the Soulfinder Series.

However the Indian Army has decided to drop the F-INSAS program in favour of two separate projects. The new program will have two components: one to arm the future infantry soldier with the best available assault rifle, carbines and personal equipment, such as helmets and bulletproof vests. The second component is the Battlefield Management Systems (BMS). The program is modeled on the US military Future Warrior system.http://www.spslandforces.com/ebook/37012014.pdf  The F-INSAS program  F-INSAS has been taken up to equip Indian infantry with advanced weaponry, communication network and instant access to information on the battlefield. This program is similar to the future soldier programs of other nations. F-INSAS includes a fully networked all-terrain, all-weather personal-equipment platform, enhanced firepower and mobility for the digitalised battlefield of the future. The weight carried by soldiers will need to be reduced by at least 50%. The fully integrated Infantry of tomorrow will be equipped with mission- oriented equipment integrated with his buddy soldier team, the sub-unit, as also the overall C4ISTAR represents C4 (command, control, communications, computers) and ISTAR (intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance) system.  Timeline  In the first phase, to be completed by 2015, the infantry soldier will be equipped with a modular weapon system that will have multi-functions. The Indian Army intends to modernise its entire 465 infantry and paramilitary battalions by 2020 with this program.  F-INSAS equipment  The intention is to equip the soldiers to ensure a dramatic increase in his lethality, survivability and mobility while making the soldier \\"a self-contained fighting machine\\".  Core systems  Helmet and visor The helmet is a Level-IV bullet-proof helmet and capable of stopping a 9mm round at close range, facial protection, ballistic and laser eye protection and flame-resistant eye & face protection. The visor will contain a mounted flash light, thermal sensors, advanced night vision capability, a digital compass, shoulder video camera, a computer, nuclear, biological and chemical sensors, and an audio headset. The visor is intended to be integrated and to act as a heads-up display monitor equivalent to two 17-inch computer monitors. Clothing The personal clothing of this soldier of the future would be lightweight with a level IV bullet-proof jacket. The jacket would be non- flammable, water-proofed yet breathable (flexible ballistic protection, hard ballistic protection, electronic jacket, load-bearing structure). The new attire will enable him to carry extra loads and resist the impact of nuclear, radiological, chemical and biological (NRCB) warfare. The uniform will also carry solar elements for charging palmtop computers and other attached electronic equipment. It will contain an external oxygen supply and respirator to provide protection against gas and smoke and will include fire-proof knee and elbow pads, hand gloves and ballistic & laser eye protection goggles. A bullet-proof, armoured waistcoat including flexible ballistic, hard ballistic, ceramic armor plates covering the front, back and groin and an armored, electronic jacket with a load-bearing system will also be included. The electronic jacket integrates the electronics (such as a computer unit, energy manager unit, peripheral equipment interfaces, user interfaces, a radio, a man-machine interface, an Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS a.k.a. NAVigation with Indian Constellation- NavIC) device, cables, connector, camouflaging system, wearable environmental control and a micro-climate heating & cooling system). A flexible water bottle, magazines, grenades and other equipment holders and pockets optimises weight distribution on the soldier. The new uniform will have vests with sensors to monitor the soldier's health parameters and provide quick medical relief. He might also wear flame- resistant, moisture-defeating undergarments; flame-resistant hand, face, and foot protection and a pair of non-skid shoes with mine & explosive detection sensors would complete the ensemble. The system also includes inbuilt water purifier system so that they have purified drinking water. Weapons The weapons sub-system is built around a multi-calibre individual weapon system with the fourth calibre attached to a grenade launcher. These include a 5.56 mm, a 7.62 mm and a new 6.8 mm under development for the first time in India. The UBGL (Under Barrel Grenade Launcher) will be capable of firing air bursting grenades. The sub-system includes a thermal weapon sight and laser range finder to provide the soldier with range and direction information. The IRNSS (similar to GPS or GLONASS) location information will allow the soldier to call for indirect fire accurately. There are two types of next generation infantry rifle under development in cooperation with Israel. In this context, news sources report that the Indian MoD has recently issued a global tender for the acquisition of a new assault rifle and a Close Quarter Battle (CQB) carbine. In DEFXPO 2014 a prototype of the ARDE-DRDO MCIWS (Multi Caliber Individual Weapon System) was showcased. It is lighter than the existing INSAS rifles in the Indian Armed Forces, weighing only 3 kg. It features an UBGL (Under Barrel Grenade Launcher) as well as thermal sights or plain holographic sights & Red dot sights. Laser target it has multiple pica tinny rails to facilitate various add-on equipments needed for various missions and thus improving versatility. And many other terrain, operation & mission based weapons as per requirement. Accessories The soldier will be equipped with a USB 2.0. digital data bus, Palmtop IRNSS/GPS navigation device, secured advance audio communication set, advance electronic warfare data manager, secured network connection where each radio can subscribe to two networks simultaneously. This offers the squad leader some flexibility in organizing communication networks in his section. Each network has an audio conference channel, with priority given to the squad leader, an alert channel from the infantryman to his leader, and a data transmission channel. Voice and data transmissions are based on tried and tested civilian technology (domestic cordless telephone technology). Each sub-network works from a base carried by the squad leader. As RIF sets are all identical, a soldier can replace his commander if necessary by configuring his set as base. The radio is configured by the computer, thereby limiting the number of control buttons needed on the set. The soldier might be able to communicate with other soldiers and locate or generate maps to find his location, and he will be aware of the situation on the battlefield.

The procurement covers night-vision devices, laser designators and detachable under-barrel grenade launchers.  Indigenisation of program  With the intent to retain its strategic autonomy, self-reliance and indigenisation of the program is being emphasised. Most of the equipment is being locally developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Ordnance Factories Board as the prime developer and the system integrator respectively. # Design and development of a multi- calibre individual weapon system. # Design and development of an air bursting grenade for individual weapons.  Program split  In January 2015, Vice Chief of Army staff, Lt General Philip Campose reported that the Indian Army has split the F-INSAS program in favour of two separate projects. The new program will have two components: one arming the modern infantry soldier with the best available assault rifle, carbines and personal equipment such as the helmet and bulletproof vests and the second component is the Battlefield Management Systems (BMS).

A head house or headhouse may be an enclosed building attached to an open-sided shed, or the aboveground part of a subway station. Markets In the 18th and early 19th centuries, head houses were often civic buildings such as town halls or courthouses located at the end of an open market shed; one example is the former market and firehouse from which Philadelphia's Head House Square takes its name. Mines In mining, a headhouse is the housing of the headworks of various types of machinery used for moving coal to the surface, or men to or from it. Transportation Railroads Since the mid-19th century, in the United States, a head house has often been the part of a passenger train station that does not house the tracks and platforms. Elsewhere, the same part of a station is known as the station building. In particular, it often contains the ticket counters, waiting rooms, toilets and baggage facilities. It might also include the passenger concourses and walkways between the platforms and other facilities. The head house at Philadelphia's Reading Terminal, which fronts a two level shed with tracks and platforms placed above a covered market, combined both the older and newer meanings of the word. Larger terminals had amenities that were contained within their own distinct building, which was separate from the railroad. For instance, when Cincinnati Union Terminal opened in 1933, the head house held a restaurant, lunch room, ice cream shop, news agent, drug store, small movie theater, men's and women's lounges, and restrooms that included changing rooms and showers.\\"Cincinnati's New Union Terminal\\", Railway Age, Vol. 94, No. 16, April 22, 1938 (available as a reprint—The Cincinnati Union Terminal—from the Cincinnati Railroad Club) Subways Bowling Green subway station in New York City In subway systems, a head house is the part of a subway station that is above ground, which contain escalators, elevators and ticket agents. On the New York City Subway, a head house is called a \\"Control House\\". They were built, and are still used in certain locations (such as at Broadway and West 72nd Street), where a simple staircase or kiosk was not desirable. During the design and construction of the city's original subway line opened by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) in 1904, control houses were treated as integral architectural features of the system. In 1901, William Barclay Parsons, chief engineer for the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners, had traveled to Boston with architect Christopher LaFarge, where he was apparently inspired by the ornamental houses he saw used as entrances to the Tremont Street subway. In response, architects Heins & LaFarge designed each IRT control house to be an attractive exterior feature of the transit network system that was in keeping with its location. The buildings, which are examples of the Beaux-Arts style, are similar to other ground-level structures on the IRT, such as the powerhouses and sub-stations.

It was last assigned to the 183rd Fighter Wing located of the Illinois Air National Guard at Capital Airport Air National Guard Station, Springfield, Illinois. The 170th last flew the Block 30 General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. It was inactivated on 30 September 2008. History World War II The squadron was activated at Dale Mabry Field, Florida as one of the original squadrons of the 338th Fighter Group.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 369Maurer, Combat Units, p. 216 The squadron was initially equipped with Bell P-39 Airacobras. It operated as a replacement training unit. Replacement training units were oversized units which trained aircrews prior to their deployment to combat theaters.Craven & Cate, p. xxxvi In 1943, the 338th Group and its squadrons standardized training with the Republic P-47 Thunderbolts, although the squadron also operated a few Curtiss P-40 Warhawks. However, the Army Air Forces found that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization, were proving poorly adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, it adopted a more functional system in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit,Goss, p. 75 while the groups and squadrons acting as RTUs were disbanded or inactivated.Maurer, Combat Units, p. 7 This resulted in the 305th, along with other units at Dale Mabry, being disbanded in the spring of 1944 and its personnel and aircraft were transferred to the 335th Army Air Force Base Unit (Replacement Training Unit Fighter). Illinois Air National Guard The 305th Fighter Squadron was reconstituted and redesignated as the 170th Fighter Squadron on 24 May 1946 and allotted to the National Guard. In September 1948 the squadron was organized at Capital Airport, Springfield, Illinois and extended federal recognition. The squadron was equipped with the North American F-51D Mustang and was assigned to the 128th Fighter Group of the Wisconsin Air National Guard. In November 1950, the 126th Composite Wing was organized in the Illinois Air National Guard when the National Guard adopted the wing base organization system and the squadron was assigned to its 126th Composite Group. =Korean War mobilization= On 1 March 1951 the 170th was called to active duty due to the Korean War. It moved to Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas where it was redesignated the 170th Fighter-bomber Squadron and was assigned to the federalized 131st Fighter-Bomber Group. In addition to the 170th, the 131st Group was assigned the 110th Fighter-Bomber Squadron of the Missouri Air National Guard and the 192d Fighter-Bomber Squadron of the Nevada Air National Guard. At Bergstrom, its mission was to replace the 27th Fighter-Escort Group which deployed to Japan as part of Strategic Air Command's commitment to the Korean War. In November the 131st and its squadrons were transferred to Tactical Air Command and moved to George Air Force Base, California. At George, the unit was scheduled to be re-equipped with Republic F-84D Thunderjets for deployment to Japan, however the F-84s were instead sent to France and the squadron remained in California with Mustangs for the remainder of its federal service. The 170th was released from active duty and returned to Illinois state control on 1 December 1952 and its personnel, equipment and mission at George were transferred to the active duty 435th Fighter-Bomber Squadron.Mueller, pp. 190-191. Mueller does not show the detailed structure of the 131st Group and erroneously lists the 435th Squadron as activating on 1 January 1953.

After returning to Springfield, the 170th was equipped with the North American F-86E Sabre. However, only about a half-dozen Sabres were received before the squadron began receiving Republic F-84F Thunderstreaks. The first F-84F arrived in February 1955. The squadron's mission was changed to what was termed a \\"Special Delivery\\" squadron, and the 170th began training on the tactical delivery of nuclear weapons, being renamed the 170th Tactical Fighter Squadron in 1958. On 1 October 1961, as a result of the 1961 Berlin Crisis, the 170th was again federalized and assigned to the 131st Tactical Fighter Group. The 170th remained at Springfield, while elements of the 131st deployed to Toul- Rosières Air Base, France to form the 7131st Tactical Fighter Wing. The 131st Tactical Fighter Wing, was composed of three federalized National Guard squadrons and their supporting squadrons. However, only its 110th Tactical Fighter Squadron deployed as a unit to France. The 170th rotated personnel to Toul during their period of activation, however aircraft and personnel deployed to Toul were maintained at a level equivalent to a single squadron at any one time. Camouflaged squadron F-84FAircraft is Republic F-84F-40-RE Thunderstreak serial 52-6631 in Vietnam War camouflage. While in France, the Guardsmen trained with elements of the United States Seventh Army and maintained a 24-hour alert status. The 7131st exchanged air and ground crews with the Royal Danish Air Force's 730th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Skydstrup Air Station, Denmark during May 1962. As the Berlin situation subsided, all activated ANG units were ordered to be returned to the United States and released from active duty, while the 7131st Wing was discontinued in France. The 170th reformed in Illinois in the fall of 1962, retaining its F-84F Thunderstreaks. On 15 October 1962, the 170th Tactical Fighter Squadron was authorized to expand, and the 183rd Tactical Fighter Group was established. The 170th became the new group's flying squadron. Other units assigned into the group were the 183rd Material Squadron, 183rd Combat Support Squadron and the 183rd USAF Dispensary. 170th Tactical Fighter Squadron F-4DAircraft is McDonnell F-4D-31-MC Phantom II serial 66-7701, about 1982. The aircraft was retired to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center as FP0146 on 2 August 1988 The squadron continued to fly the F-84F aircraft throughout the 1960s. The squadron did not see service during the Vietnam War, although, between 1968 and 1971, many of its personnel were activated as individuals and some saw service in Southeast Asia. All F-84Fs were grounded in November 1971, after a 170th pilot was killed when his plane lost a wing during exercises at the Hardwood Gunnery range in Findley, Wisconsin. The accident was caused by the \\"milkbone\\" bolt in the wing, weakened by years of flying, failing in- flight. Inspections of other F-84Fs found the same issue affected many other aircraft. The problem was deemed too widespread to justify the costly repair of the aircraft, and the Air Force decided to retire the Guard's fleet of F-84Fs and replace them with more modern aircraft. All F-84s were retired to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC) at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. The 170th flew the Thunderstreak for more than a decade and a half, longer than any other squadron in the active force or the Air National Guard. In 1972, the squadron was the first Air National Guard unit to receive the McDonnell F-4C Phantom II. Most of its aircraft were planes returning combat from Southeast Asia. Along with the F-4C, a flight of RF-4C Phantom II Reconnaissance aircraft were received. In 1981, the F-4Cs were exchanged for the F-4D. =Post Cold War era= The 170th saw its first General Dynamics F-16A Fighting Falcon on 7 June 1989 when two landed at Capital Airport to replace the squadron's aging F-4D Phantom IIs. By 5 May 1990 the 170th was operational with the F-16A/B. Its mission was fighter attack and the squadron flew the \\"Block 15\\" for this mission. On 15 March 1992 the squadron changed designation from the 170th Tactical Fighter Squadron to the 170th Fighter Squadron. Three years later, it would be reassigned to the 183rd Operations Group when its parent became the 183rd Fighter Wing under the Air Force Objective Wing reorganization plan. During early 1994 the 170th started to exchange its block 15 F-16A/B for block 30 F-16C/D Fighting Falcons with larger air inlets. Most of the block 15s were retired to AMARC. During the 1990s, the unit conducted numerous overseas deployments, including six to Southwest Asia, two to Denmark, one to Panama, one to Curaçao, and one to Thailand. =Global War on Terrorism= 170th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron F-16Aircraft is General Dynamics F-16C Fighting Falcon serial 87-294 at Balad Air Base, Iraq, taking off on an Operation Iraqi Freedom mission on 21 July 2006. After the 9/11 attacks, the 170th increased its capability by obtaining AN/AAQ-28(V) LITENING targeting pods in October 2001. Training with the new pod started immediately to get ready for a scheduled deployment in March 2002 for Operation Enduring Freedom. Starting in January 2002 the 170th deployed for two weeks to Tucson Air National Guard Base, Arizona for final training with the LITENING pod. The March 2002 deployment was to be with two other units but this changed due to their Operation Noble Eagle air defense commitments. As a result, the 170th deployed by itself as the 170th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron. The 170th Expeditionary Squadron replaced the 18th Squadron. Besides its duties over Afghanistan, the 170th Expeditionary Squadron performed air interdiction missions over Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch. In the very early morning on 17 April 2002 while on deployment in Afghanistan a pilot in a two-ship formation from the 170th mistakenly bombed a Canadian force which was practicing live firing of its weapons near Kandahar, Afghanistan. Four soldiers were killed and eight were injured. This tragedy resulted in non-judicial punishment for one of the pilots involved after their return to Springfield. After more than two of overseas deployments the 170th participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom in October 2004. =BRAC 2005 and Inactivation= 170th Fighter Squadron 60th Anniversary F-16Aircraft is General Dynamics F-16C block 30 Fighting Falcon serial 87-296 leaving Capital Airport for its final training flight in September 2008. The BRAC 2005 committee report recommended the retirement of the Block 30 F-16s and the inactivation of the 170th Fighter Squadron.

La Linea features an ensemble cast that includes Ray Liotta, Armand Assante, Valerie Cruz, Esai Morales, and Andy García. Plot Veteran assassin Mark Shields is hired to track down the head of an elusive drug cartel centered in Tijuana, Mexico. Shields takes the assignment in a weary daze, as he is fresh off a case that claimed the life of a woman he continues to see in his mind. Meanwhile, Javier Salazar, the head of the cartel Shields is assigned to, is dying. Salazar hands over his position to his nephew, the cocky Pelon. Pelon takes charge with a different agenda, however, planning to change the cocaine being transported to heroin from Afghanistan. Shields recruits Wire, an old friend, to help in an assassination attempt. Pelon is leaving one of his warehouses when he is attacked not only by Shields and Wire, but a different group set up by a contractor named Anthony. A shootout ensues, ending in Anthony's team being forced to withdraw. Shields aborts the operation, but Wire is kidnapped. Pelon sees Padre Antonio after the shootout. Then he goes to talk to Salazar, who tells his nephew that their operation won't ever be in jeopardy if the Americans simply keep taking out the leaders. Salazar believes that someone will always be there to take the seat of the fallen leader. Shields is mugged but is found by a local woman named Olivia, who takes him into her home. Shields stays until he recovers, then leaves. He later finds out that Wire was tortured and killed. Pelon is attacked once more by Shields, and is kidnapped. Shields takes Pelon to Salazar's home. It is revealed that Salazar faked his illness, hired Shields and set up an elaborate twist for his nephew. Pelon is executed by Padre Antonio, another dupe set up by Salazar. Shields then gives his pay to Olivia (local woman) and boards a cab. On a ride to the airport Shields realizes that he was shot sometime when he was kidnapping Pelon, and he slowly lays down in the back of the cab and dies.

It is situated at around above sea level on the western slopes of Mount Hermon, south east of Beirut near the Syrian border, and approximately halfway between Jezzine and Damascus., URL accessed May 31, 2008 Culture Rashaya has a population of around 6,000 to 7,500 that are mostly Druze. It is still considered to be a traditional Lebanese town with its old cobbled streets and small shops, even though it witnessed in recent years a slight expansion of buildings. It retains a distinguished character of traditional stone houses with red tiled roofs. The small souk in the middle of the town offers various shops selling local crafts and inexpensive goods. There is a recently renovated goldsmiths selling an assortment of gold and silver jewelry in Byzantine and other styles.

The remains of a Roman temple can be seen on the left side of the road leading from Rashaya to the village of Aaiha, one of several Temples of Mount Hermon. Neolithic flints were also found in the hills north of the town. There is also a significant Neolithic site nearby at Kawkaba where fragments of agricultural tools such as basalt hoes have been found with very faded dating suggesting the 6th millennium or earlier.J.

History The Rashaya Citadel, also known as the Citadel of Independence, has been declared a national monument, having been first built as a palace by the Shihab family in the 18th century. It is now stationed by the Lebanese Armed Forces and can be visited and seen under the army's surveillance.Lebanon Atlas - Rashaya: Tourism in Lebanon, Lebanon Touristic Sites, Rachaya al Wadi, Rashayya In June 1860, the town was the scene of a massacre, where two hundred and sixty five Christians were killed by Druze forces, some within the citadel. Around one thousand victims were killed in the areas of Hasbaya and Rashaya between 10 and 13 June. In November and December 1925, the town was engulfed and nearly obliterated by one of the largest battles of the Great Druze Revolt, when four hundred and twenty nine Christian homes were either damaged or destroyed. Three thousand Druze under Zayd Beg besieged the citadel of French legionnaires under a Captain Granger between 20 and 24 November. The Druze eventually suffered their first major defeat to French reinforcements, with heavy casualties marking a turning point in the Druze invasion of southern Lebanon. Under the French Mandate and on 11 November 1943, Rashaya witnessed the arrest and the imprisonment of the Lebanese national leaders in its citadel by the Free French troops (Bechara El Khoury (the first post- independence President of Lebanon), Riad El-Solh (the Prime Minister), Pierre Gemayel, Camille Chamoun, Adel Osseiran). This led to a national and international pressure in demand for their release, and eventually obliging France to obey. On November 22, 1943, the prisoners were released, and that day was declared the Lebanese Independence Day.  Geology  Rashaya is situated on a karst topography of grey or creamy-white, jurassic limestone with a thickness of up to . The Rashaya Fault has been defined as a left- lateral strike-slip fault that cuts into Mount Hermon and is an extension of the Banias Fault. It suggested to be pre-Pliocene and may be active. The danger of earthquakes is not high and there have been none on record. It runs a few kilometers east of the Hasbaya Fault, which in turn runs parallel to the Jordan valley. The Rashaya Fault may have experienced up to of Quaternary horizontal movement and small breaches on the associated strands from it have developed small basins. The danger of earthquakes is not high and there have been none recorded from the fault. Climate Rashaya receives between and of rainfall each year with around two fifths of this amount falling between November and March. It has an average annual temperature of , varying between in the summer season down to in winter. The dominant wind direction is east to west from which the town is somewhat sheltered by the mountains. Economy The economy of the town is primarily based on agriculture, the services and tourism industries. The town has two olive oil presses and three grape molasses factories. Rashaya was designated one of nine poverty areas within Lebanon in a survey of 2002. The World Bank and U.S. Aid has financed development projects in the area with the assistance of the YMCA and other NGOs. Projects have included a $500,000 waste water treatment plant and redecoration of the town's guesthouse in 2007.USAID opens water treatment plants in Bekaa, The Daily Star (Lebanon), July 30, 2007. Agriculture Commonly grown crops include cherries, olives, apricots and grapes. Some wild cucumbers are also grown, however vegetables are less frequently grown due to low rainfall. Animal husbandry is also practiced, mainly with goats, of which the Labneh variety is a popular staple food for locals. Tree species such as oak, wild pistachio and sumac grow in the area. A variety of jackals and foxes, snakes, lizards and rodents live in the area along with various species of migratory birds.

The field is analogous to genomics and proteomics, which are the study of the genome and proteome of a cell. Epigenetic modifications are reversible modifications on a cell's DNA or histones that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Epigenomic maintenance is a continuous process and plays an important role in stability of eukaryotic genomes by taking part in crucial biological mechanisms like DNA repair. Plant flavones are said to be inhibiting epigenomic marks that cause cancers. Two of the most characterized epigenetic modifications are DNA methylation and histone modification. Epigenetic modifications play an important role in gene expression and regulation, and are involved in numerous cellular processes such as in differentiation/development and tumorigenesis. The study of epigenetics on a global level has been made possible only recently through the adaptation of genomic high-throughput assays. Introduction to epigenetics The mechanisms governing phenotypic plasticity, or the capacity of a cell to change its state in response to stimuli, have long been the subject of research (Phenotypic plasticity 1). The traditional central dogma of biology states that the DNA of a cell is transcribed to RNA, which is translated to proteins, which perform cellular processes and functions. A paradox exists, however, in that cells exhibit diverse responses to varying stimuli and that cells sharing identical sets of DNA such as in multicellular organisms can have a variety of distinct functions and phenotypes. Classical views have attributed phenotypic variation to differences in primary DNA structure, be it through aberrant mutation or an inherited sequence allele. However, while this did explain some aspects of variation, it does not explain how tightly coordinated and regulated cellular responses, such as differentiation, are carried out. A more likely source of cellular plasticity is through the Regulation of gene expression, such that while two cells may have near identical DNA, the differential expression of certain genes results in variation. Research has shown that cells are capable of regulating gene expression at several stages: mRNA transcription, processing and transportation as well as in protein translation, post- translational processing and degradation. Regulatory proteins that bind to DNA, RNA, and/or proteins are key effectors in these processes and function by positively or negatively regulating specific protein level and function in a cell. And, while DNA binding transcription factors provide a mechanism for specific control of cellular responses, a model where DNA binding transcription factors are the sole regulators of gene activity is also unlikely. For example, in a study of Somatic-cell nuclear transfer, it was demonstrated that stable features of differentiation remain after the nucleus is transferred to a new cellular environment, suggesting that a stable and heritable mechanism of gene regulation was involved in the maintenance of the differentiated state in the absence of the DNA binding transcription factors. With the finding that DNA methylation and histone modifications are stable, heritable, and also reversible processes that influence gene expression without altering DNA primary structure, a mechanism for the observed variability in cell gene expression was provided. These modifications were termed epigenetic, from epi “on top of” the genetic material “DNA” (Epigenetics 1). The mechanisms governing epigenetic modifications are complex, but through the advent of high-throughput sequencing technology they are now becoming better understood. Epigenetics Genomic modifications that alter gene expression that cannot be attributed to modification of the primary DNA sequence and that are heritable mitotically and meiotically are classified as epigenetic modifications. DNA methylation and histone modification are among the best characterized epigenetic processes. DNA methylation The first epigenetic modification to be characterized in depth was DNA methylation. As its name implies, DNA methylation is the process by which a methyl group is added to DNA. The enzymes responsible for catalyzing this reaction are the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). While DNA methylation is stable and heritable, it can be reversed by an antagonistic group of enzymes known as DNA de-methylases. In eukaryotes, methylation is most commonly found on the carbon 5 position of cytosine residues (5mC) adjacent to guanine, termed CpG dinucleotides. DNA methylation patterns vary greatly between species and even within the same organism. The usage of methylation among animals is quite different; with vertebrates exhibiting the highest levels of 5mC and invertebrates more moderate levels of 5mC. Some organisms like Caenorhabditis elegans have not been demonstrated to have 5mC nor a conventional DNA methyltransferase; this would suggest that other mechanisms other than DNA methylation are also involved. Within an organism, DNA methylation levels can also vary throughout development and by region. For example, in mouse primordial germ cells, a genome wide de-methylation even occurs; by implantation stage, methylation levels return to their previous somatic values. When DNA methylation occurs at promoter regions, the sites of transcription initiation, it has the effect of repressing gene expression. This is in contrast to unmethylated promoter regions which are associated with actively expressed genes. The mechanism by which DNA methylation represses gene expression is a multi-step process. The distinction between methylated and unmethylated cytosine residues is carried out by specific DNA-binding proteins. Binding of these proteins recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs) enzyme which initiate chromatin remodeling such that the DNA becoming less accessible to transcriptional machinery, such as RNA polymerase, effectively repressing gene expression. Histone modification In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is coiled into protein-DNA complexes called chromatin. Histones, which are the most prevalent type of protein found in chromatin, function to condense the DNA; the net positive charge on histones facilitates their bonding with DNA, which is negatively charged. The basic and repeating units of chromatin, nucleosomes, consist of an octamer of histone proteins (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) and a 146 bp length of DNA wrapped around it. Nucleosomes and the DNA connecting form a 10 nm diameter chromatin fiber, which can be further condensed. Chromatin packaging of DNA varies depending on the cell cycle stage and by local DNA region. The degree to which chromatin is condensed is associated with a certain transcriptional state. Unpackaged or loose chromatin is more transcriptionally active than tightly packaged chromatin because it is more accessible to transcriptional machinery. By remodeling chromatin structure and changing the density of DNA packaging, gene expression can thus be modulated. Chromatin remodeling occurs via post-translational modifications of the N-terminal tails of core histone proteins. The collective set of histone modifications in a given cell is known as the histone code. Many different types of histone modification are known, including: acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, ADP-ribosylation, deamination and proline isomerization; acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination have been implicated in gene activation whereas methylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, deamination and proline isomerization have been implicated in gene repression. Note that several modification types including methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination can be associated with different transcriptional states depending on the specific amino acid on the histone being modified. Furthermore, the DNA region where histone modification occurs can also elicit different effects; an example being methylation of the 3rd core histone at lysine residue 36 (H3K36). When H3K36 occurs in the coding sections of a gene, it is associated with gene activation but the opposite is found when it is within the promoter region. Histone modifications regulate gene expression by two mechanisms: by disruption of the contact between nucleosomes and by recruiting chromatin remodeling ATPases. An example of the first mechanism occurs during the acetylation of lysine terminal tail amino acids, which is catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs). HATs are part of a multiprotein complex that is recruited to chromatin when activators bind to DNA binding sites. Acetylation effectively neutralizes the basic charge on lysine, which was involved in stabilizing chromatin through its affinity for negatively charged DNA. Acetylated histones therefore favor the dissociation of nucleosomes and thus unwinding of chromatin can occur. Under a loose chromatin state, DNA is more accessible to transcriptional machinery and thus expression is activated. The process can be reversed through removal of histone acetyl groups by deacetylases. The second process involves the recruitment of chromatin remodeling complexes by the binding of activator molecules to corresponding enhancer regions. The nucleosome remodeling complexes reposition nucleosomes by several mechanisms, enabling or disabling accessibility of transcriptional machinery to DNA. The SWI/SNF protein complex in yeast is one example of a chromatin remodeling complex that regulates the expression of many genes through chromatin remodeling. Relation to other genomic fields Epigenomics shares many commonalities with other genomics fields, in both methodology and in its abstract purpose. Epigenomics seeks to identify and characterize epigenetic modifications on a global level, similar to the study of the complete set of DNA in genomics or the complete set of proteins in a cell in proteomics. The logic behind performing epigenetic analysis on a global level is that inferences can be made about epigenetic modifications, which might not otherwise be possible through analysis of specific loci. As in the other genomics fields, epigenomics relies heavily on bioinformatics, which combines the disciplines of biology, mathematics and computer science. However while epigenetic modifications had been known and studied for decades, it is through these advancements in bioinformatics technology that have allowed analyses on a global scale. Many current techniques still draw on older methods, often adapting them to genomic assays as is described in the next section. Methods Histone modification assays The cellular processes of transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair involve the interaction between genomic DNA and nuclear proteins. It had been known that certain regions within chromatin were extremely susceptible to DNAse I digestion, which cleaves DNA in a low sequence specificity manner. Such hypersensitive sites were thought to be transcriptionally active regions, as evidenced by their association with RNA polymerase and topoisomerases I and II. It is now known that sensitivity to DNAse I regions correspond to regions of chromatin with loose DNA-histone association. Hypersensitive sites most often represent promoters regions, which require for DNA to be accessible for DNA binding transcriptional machinery to function. =ChIP-Chip and ChIP-Seq= Histone modification was first detected on a genome wide level through the coupling of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technology with DNA microarrays, termed ChIP-Chip. However instead of isolating a DNA-binding transcription factor or enhancer protein through chromatin immunoprecipitation, the proteins of interest are the modified histones themselves. First, histones are cross- linked to DNA in vivo through light chemical treatment (e.g., formaldehyde). The cells are next lysed, allowing for the chromatin to be extracted and fragmented, either by sonication or treatment with a non-specific restriction enzyme (e.g., micrococcal nuclease). Modification-specific antibodies in turn, are used to immunoprecipitate the DNA-histone complexes. Following immunoprecipitation, the DNA is purified from the histones, amplified via PCR and labeled with a fluorescent tag (e.g., Cy5, Cy3). The final step involves hybridization of labeled DNA, both immunoprecipitated DNA and non- immunoprecipitated onto a microarray containing immobilized gDNA. Analysis of the relative signal intensity allows the sites of histone modification to be determined. ChIP-chip was used extensively to characterize the global histone modification patterns of yeast. From these studies, inferences on the function of histone modifications were made; that transcriptional activation or repression was associated with certain histone modifications and by region. While this method was effective providing near full coverage of the yeast epigenome, its use in larger genomes such as humans is limited. In order to study histone modifications on a truly genome level, other high-throughput methods were coupled with the chromatin immunoprecipitation, namely: SAGE: serial analysis of gene expression (ChIP-SAGE), PET: paired end ditag sequencing (ChIP-PET) and more recently, next-generation sequencing (ChIP- Seq). ChIP-seq follows the same protocol for chromatin immunoprecipitation but instead of amplification of purified DNA and hybridization to a microarray, the DNA fragments are directly sequenced using next generation parallel re- sequencing. It has proven to be an effective method for analyzing the global histone modification patterns and protein target sites, providing higher resolution than previous methods. DNA methylation assays Techniques for characterizing primary DNA sequences could not be directly applied to methylation assays. For example, when DNA was amplified in PCR or bacterial cloning techniques, the methylation pattern was not copied and thus the information lost. The DNA hybridization technique used in DNA assays, in which radioactive probes were used to map and identify DNA sequences, could not be used to distinguish between methylated and non-methylated DNA. =Restriction endonuclease based methods= Non genome-wide approaches The earliest methylation detection assays used methylation modification sensitive restriction endonucleases. Genomic DNA was digested with both methylation- sensitive and insensitive restriction enzymes recognizing the same restriction site. The idea being that whenever the site was methylated, only the methylation insensitive enzyme could cleave at that position. By comparing restriction fragment sizes generated from the methylation-sensitive enzyme to those of the methylation-insensitive enzyme, it was possible to determine the methylation pattern of the region. This analysis step was done by amplifying the restriction fragments via PCR, separating them through gel electrophoresis and analyzing them via southern blot with probes for the region of interest. This technique was used to compare the DNA methylation modification patterns in the human adult and hemoglobin gene loci. Different regions of the gene (gamma delta beta globin) were known to be expressed at different stages of development. Consistent with a role of DNA methylation in gene repression, regions that were associated with high levels of DNA methylation were not actively expressed. This method was limited not suitable for studies on the global methylation pattern, or ‘methylome’. Even within specific loci it was not fully representative of the true methylation pattern as only those restriction sites with corresponding methylation sensitive and insensitive restriction assays could provide useful information. Further complications could arise when incomplete digestion of DNA by restriction enzymes generated false negative results. Genome wide approaches DNA methylation profiling on a large scale was first made possible through the Restriction Landmark Genome Scanning (RLGS) technique. Like the locus-specific DNA methylation assay, the technique identified methylated DNA via its digestion methylation sensitive enzymes. However it was the use of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis that allowed be characterized on a broader scale. However it was not until the advent of microarray and next generation sequencing technology when truly high resolution and genome-wide DNA methylation became possible. As with RLGS, the endonuclease component is retained in the method but it is coupled to new technologies. One such approach is the differential methylation hybridization (DMH), in which one set of genomic DNA is digested with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes and a parallel set of DNA is not digested. Both sets of DNA are subsequently amplified and each labelled with fluorescent dyes and used in two-colour array hybridization. The level of DNA methylation at a given loci is determined by the relative intensity ratios of the two dyes. Adaptation of next generation sequencing to DNA methylation assay provides several advantages over array hybridization. Sequence-based technology provides higher resolution to allele specific DNA methylation, can be performed on larger genomes, and does not require creation of DNA microarrays which require adjustments based on CpG density to properly function. =Bisulfite sequencing= Bisulfite sequencing relies on chemical conversion of unmethylated cytosines exclusively, such that they can be identified through standard DNA sequencing techniques. Sodium bisulfate and alkaline treatment does this by converting unmethylated cytosine residues into uracil while leaving methylated cytosine unaltered. Subsequent amplification and sequencing of untreated DNA and sodium bisulphite treated DNA allows for methylated sites to be identified. Bisulfite sequencing, like the traditional restriction based methods, was historically limited to methylation patterns of specific gene loci, until whole genome sequencing technologies became available. However, unlike traditional restriction based methods, bisulfite sequencing provided resolution on a nucleotide level. Limitations of the bisulfite technique include the incomplete conversion of cytosine to uracil, which is a source of false positives. Further, bisulfite treatment also causes DNA degradation and requires an additional purification step to remove the sodium bisulfite. Next-generation sequencing is well suited in complementing bisulfite sequencing in genome-wide methylation analysis. While this now allows for methylation pattern to be determined on the highest resolution possible, on the single nucleotide level, challenges still remain in the assembly step because of reduced sequence complexity in bisulphite treated DNA. Increases in read length seek to address this challenge, allowing for whole genome shotgun bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) to be performed. The WGBS approach using an Illumina Genome Analyzer platform and has already been implemented in Arabidopsis thaliana. Reduced representation genomic methods based on bisulfite sequencing exist as well, and they are particularly suitable for species with large genome sizes.  Chromatin accessibility assays  Chromatin accessibility is the measure of how \\"accessible\\" or \\"open\\" a region of genome is to transcription or binding of transcription factors. The regions which are inaccessible (i.e. because they're bound by nucleosomes) are not actively transcribed by the cell while open and accessible regions are actively transcribed. Changes in chromatin accessibility are important epigenetic regulatory processes that govern cell- or context-specific expression of genes. Assays such as MNase-seq, DNase-seq, ATAC-seq or FAIRE-seq are routinely used to understand the accessible chromatin landscape of cells. The main feature of all these methods is that they're able to selectively isolate either the DNA sequences that are bounded to the histones, or those that are not. These sequences are then compared to a reference genome that allows to identify their relative position. MNase-seq and DNase-seq both follow the same principles, as they employ lytic enzymes that target nucleic acids to cut the DNA strands unbounded by nucleosomes or other proteic factors, while the bounded pieces are sheltered, and can be retrieved and analysed. Since active, unbound regions are destroyed, their detection can only be indirect, by sequencing with a Next Generation Sequencing technique and comparison with a reference. MNase-seq utilises a micrococcal nuclease that produces a single strand cleavage on the opposite strand of the target sequence. DNase-seq employs DNase I, a non-specific double strand-cleaving endonuclease. This technique has been used to such an extent that nucleosome-free regions have been labelled as DHSs, DNase I hypersensitive sites, and has been ENCODE consortium's election method for genome wide chromatin accessibility analyses. The main issue of this technique is that the cleavage distribution can be biased, lowering the quality of the results. FAIRE-seq (Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements) requires as its first step crosslinking of the DNA with nucleosomes, then DNA shearing by sonication. The free and linked fragments are separated with a traditional phenol-chloroform extraction, since the proteic fraction is stuck in the interphase while the unlinked DNA shifts to the aqueous phase and can be analysed with various methods. Sonication produces random breaks, and therefore is not subject to any kind of bias, and is also the bigger length of the fragments (200-700 nt) makes this technique suitable for wider regions, while it's unable to resolve the single nucleosome. Unlike the nuclease-based methods, FAIRE-seq allows the direct identification of the transcriptionally active sites, and a less laborious sample preparation. ATAC-seq is based on the activity of Tn5 transposase. The transposase is used to insert tags in the genome, with higher frequency on regions not covered by proteic factors. The tags are then used as adapters for PRC or other analytical tools. Direct detection Polymerase sensitivity in single-molecule real-time sequencing made it possible for scientists to directly detect epigenetic marks such as methylation as the polymerase moves along the DNA molecule being sequenced. Several projects have demonstrated the ability to collect genome-wide epigenetic data in bacteria. Nanopore sequencing is based on changes of electrolytic current signals according to base modifications (e.g. Methylation). A polymerase mediates the entrance of ssDNA in the pore: the ion-current variation is modulated by a section of the pore and the consequently generated difference is recorded revealing the position of CpG. Discrimination between hydroxymethylation and methylation is possible thanks to solid-state nanopores even if the current while passing through the high- field region of the pore may be slightly influenced in it. As a reference amplified DNA is used which will not present copied methylationed sites after the PCR process. The Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencer is a technology where, according to a hidden Markov model, it is possible to distinguish unmethylated cytosine from the methylated one even without chemical treatment that acts to enhance the signal of that modification. The data are registered commonly in picoamperes during established time. Other devices are the Nanopolish and the SignaAlign: the former expresses the frequency of a methylation in a read while the latter gives a probability of it derived from the sum of all the reads. Single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT) is a single-molecule DNA sequencing method. Single-molecule real-time sequencing utilizes a zero-mode waveguide (ZMW). A single DNA polymerase enzyme is bound to the bottom of a ZMW with a single molecule of DNA as a template. Each of the four DNA bases is attached to one of four different fluorescent dyes. When a nucleotide is incorporated by the DNA polymerase, the fluorescent tag is cleaved off and the detector detects the fluorescent signal of the nucleotide incorporation. As the sequencing occurs, the polymerase enzyme kinetics shift when it encounters a region of methylation or any other base modification. When the enzyme encounters chemically modified bases, it will slow down or speed up in a uniquely identifiable way. Fluorescence pulses in SMRT sequencing are characterized not only by their emission spectra but also by their duration and by the interval between successive pulses. These metrics, defined as pulse width and interpulse duration (IPD), add valuable information about DNA polymerase kinetics. Pulse width is a function of all kinetic steps after nucleotide binding and up to fluorophore release, and IPD is determined by the kinetics of nucleotide binding and polymerase translocation. In 2010 a team of scientists demonstrated the use of single- molecule real-time sequencing for direct detection of modified nucleotide in the DNA template including N6-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxylcytosine. These various modifications affect polymerase kinetics differently, allowing discrimination between them. In 2017, another team proposed a combined bisulfite conversion with third-generation single-molecule real-time sequencing, it is called single-molecule real-time bisulfite sequencing (SMRT-BS), which is an accurate targeted CpG methylation analysis method capable of a high degree of multiplying and long read lengths (1.5 kb) without the need for PCR amplicon sub-cloning. Theoretical modeling approaches First mathematical models for different nucleosome states affecting gene expression were introduced in 1980s [ref]. Later, this idea was almost forgotten, until the experimental evidence has indicated a possible role of covalent histone modifications as an epigenetic code. In the next several years, high-throughput data have indeed uncovered the abundance of epigenetic modifications and their relation to chromatin functioning which has motivated new theoretical models for the appearance, maintaining and changing these patterns,. These models are usually formulated in the frame of one- dimensional lattice approaches.

It encompasses a street with a cohesive collection of well-preserved, predominantly Italianate and Second Empire, houses, in which the original spacing and setting has been preserved. It includes houses on both sides of Maple Avenue, numbered from 8 to 33, among which stand several Queen Anne and Colonial Revival houses. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history Maple Avenue is located in central Cambridge, within a triangular area demarcated by Harvard Square, Central Square, and Inman Square. It runs between Cambridge Street, which connects Harvard and Inman Squares, and Broadway, which connects Harvard and Kendall Squares. This area was first developed residentially in the mid-19th century. Lining both sides of the middle area of Maple Avenue are fifteen houses whose scale and setting typify the development of that period. All of the houses are wood frame structures, and all but one are two stories in height. One house is a duplex. Five houses are Second Empire in style, typically with slate mansard roofs, bracketed cornices, and ornate window and porch details. There are two Italianate houses, each with flushboarded facades and elaborately-decorated entry porches. Some of the later houses have Queen Anne styling, but most of the remaining housing stock is Colonial Revival in character. The properties are characterized by relatively generous lot sizes, especially in comparison to the immediately surrounding properties.

Publication history Steve Lombard first appeared in Superman #264 (June 1973) in a story written by Cary Bates and penciled by Curt Swan. When editor Julius Schwartz suggested adding a sportscaster to Clark Kent's news broadcast, Bates decided to create a workplace adversary for Kent to contrast with Kent's friendly relationship with the other cast members, drawing partial inspiration from the character Ted Baxter of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Lombard's physical model was real-life football star Joe Namath. For several years after Steve Lombard's debut, he appeared in nearly every published Superman story. Action Comics writer Martin Pasko later attempted to explain the character's popularity: Bates wrote Steve Lombard out of the regular Superman supporting cast in Superman #384, though his final pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths appearance was not until Superman #413. Fictional character biography Pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths In Pre- Crisis continuity, Steve \\"The Slinger\\" Lombard is a quarterback for the fictional NFL team the Metropolis Meteors. The day before his team is to play in the Super Bowl, Steve exacerbates existing injuries to his knees while saving a baby falling from a building. An experimental radiation treatment cures his knees, but also produces an energy being resembling Lombard in his football uniform. The energy being responds to Lombard's thoughts and begins scoring touchdowns in his place, as Lombard had missed most of the game due to his accident. Initially taking credit for the energy being's performance, Lombard publicly confesses the truth after the being goes on a rampage and has to be stopped by Superman. Steve resigns from the Meteors and retires from football over his actions, leading Morgan Edge to hire him as a sportscaster for Galaxy Broadcasting, working alongside anchor Clark Kent on the Six O'Clock News. Action Comics #466 (December 1976) Steve is portrayed as brash and overly self-confident, and often plays childish pranks on Clark Kent (addressing him as \\"Clarkie\\"), which Kent usually counters with the subtle use of his super-powers. However, Steve also considers Clark one of his few real friends, since he takes Steve's behavior in stride and never bears him a grudge. Steve has a brother named Vernon, who is a doctor, and a nephew named Jaime. Steve also has an aunt, Kaye Daye, who is a mystery novelist who works with the Mystery Analysts of Gotham City. Morgan Edge ultimately fires Steve after many years due to his declining popularity with the viewing audience. Steve goes to Clark's apartment seeking solace, only to be attacked by a former college roommate who did not shrug off Steve's pranks as well as Clark did, and obtained superhuman powers to get revenge. In a rare display of genuine courage and humanity, Steve forces Clark to safety before confronting his opponent, although Clark returns as Superman and rescues Steve. Post- Crisis Lombard was not part of the original reboot of the Superman storyline that began in John Byrne's 1986 The Man of Steel mini-series. His first Post-Crisis appearance is as a news anchor on WGBS-TV in The Adventures of Superman #467 (June 1990). As of the June 2008 storyline, Lombard works for the Daily Planet, as the editor of the Sports section. Perry White states Steve Lombard has recently returned to the paper, so it can be assumed that Steve used to work there before leaving to work for WGBS. Action Comics Annual #11 (May 2008) gives the following information on Steve: \\"Sports Reporter. Steve Lombard played football in high school, college, and briefly for the pros. He sees himself as a man's man, everything Clark Kent is not in fact. He is a walking encyclopedia of sports trivia and put-downs. Lombard cannot figure out why Lois Lane does not throw herself at him\\". It is also stated that Steve Lombard often butts heads with Ron Troupe on nearly everything. His personality is featured in the 2008 'Brainiac' storyline. He makes a crude sexual advance to Lois Lane right in front of Clark Kent. He insults Ron Troupe's choice of subject matter, thinking articles critical of sports means Ron 'hates' them. He takes great joy in assaulting colleagues with a football, laughing at their torment. However, once actual danger arises he is quick to take charge and work with others in order to make sure everyone is safe. For example, he and Ron save Cat Grant's life.\\"Action Comics\\" #866-870 (2008) The 2009-2010 miniseries Superman: Secret Origin established that Lombard, in post-Infinite Crisis continuity, was already on the staff of the Daily Planet when Clark Kent began working at the newspaper.Superman: Secret Origin #3 (2009) Steve's first 'Rebirth' appearance is a crude confrontation with Lois Lane in the Daily Planet newsroom. At least what he thinks is his universe's Lois Lane.Action Comics #965 (October 2016) Steve Lombard is shot in the shoulder when he attempts to stop a crazed gunman from killing various Daily Planet employees. He is later seen being led away from the building. Action Comics #989 (December 2017) Alternate versions Earth-Two There was an Earth-Two version called Steve Bard who appeared in the 'Mr. & Mrs. Superman' stories in the Superman Family title. He appeared first in Superman (first series) #29, as a jokester, resembling The Prankster. Smallville Steve Lombard is featured in the Smallville Season 11 digital comic based on the TV series who is possessed by Eclipso.Smallville Season 11: Chaos #2 While a Steve Lombard is said to have recently gone to the Daily Star in the episode \\"Booster\\", leaving the Daily Planet,Geoff Johns (writers) & Tom Welling (director) (April 22, 2011). \\"Booster\\".

He tells Jimmy Olsen that the Earth-Three Jimmy Olsen had skinned Steve Lombard for looking at his private collection of pictures of Superwoman. This was the only reference so far to the character.Justice League # 20 All-Star Superman Steve Lombard appears as a minor supporting character in Grant Morrison's limited series All-Star Superman. This incarnation works as a sportswriter at the Daily Planet. His character and appearance are similar to that of the post-Crisis Lombard. In All-Star Superman #7, Steve proves immune to the Bizarro virus due to his use of performance-enhancing drugs. In the same issue, he risks his life to defend fellow employees from danger. He also wears a toupee he denies exists.

The machinery used to do this, such as large trucks and tractors, has destroyed most of the original rural roads.

Reception Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com wrote \\"Mignone does a remarkable job at taking what starts as a mild flirtation or tiptoeing into perversity and showing how baby steps can soon lead to full-on, downhill slides\\". He writes that of the many stories intertwined in the film, the \\"movie is surprisingly at its best in the story of the two teens\\", who flirt with a teacher played memorably by actor Eddie Jemison), when noting the \\"shocking transition\\" of two girls seen worrying about their grades riding with their teacher to a porn studio to be \\"crudely sized up for their value to the viewing audience\\". He offers that while the film tries to wrap everything up tidily, it \\"is perhaps the wrong approach for a movie about an industry with no happy endings\\". He concludes that the film is memorable \\"more for its performances than its plot\\", and that \\"this somewhat scrappy independent doesn't fade from the mind quickly\\". Marina Antunes of Quiet Earth compares the film to David Slade's Hard Candy but opines that \\"Mignone's style is an interesting mix of saturated colours and unusual visuals.

Gerry Putzer of DVD Talk compares the film with Paul Schrader's 1979 porn-world thriller Hardcore, in that the sex in the film is as \\"uniformly bizarre, degrading and joyless\\". He concludes that the film \\"deserves high marks for ambition\\", and that the actors do a \\"convincing job under first-time writer-director Thomas Mignone, whose structural adventurousness is intriguing.\\" Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote that despite flaws, Mignone's first feature \\"has delivered a fairly tight package that draws generally good performances from thesps in largely one-dimensional roles\\". David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews writes that while Mignone \\"generally does a nice job of infusing the proceedings with an intriguing visual style, there's little doubt that the increasingly uneven nature of Mignone's screenplay proves detrimental to the movie's overall success\\". He notes that \\"Mignone's decision to employ a sprawling structure - replete with almost a dozen recurring characters - undoubtedly ranks high on the film's list of problems\\".

It was founded in 1917 following the Russian Revolution. On the eve of the Occupation of Estonia by the German Empire the Omakaitse units took over major towns in the country allowing the Salvation Committee of the Estonian Provincial Assembly to proclaim the independence of Estonia. After the German Occupation the Omakaitse became outlawed. The Estonian Defence League was dissolved in 1940 after the Soviet occupation of Estonia. The Omakaitse was reestablished during the German Operation Barbarossa in 1941 by the Forest brothers who took control of the country before the German troops arrived allowing Jüri Uluots establish a co-ordinating council in Tartu to proclaim the provisional government of Estonia.In some areas of southern Estonia, pro independence administrations were already in place by the time German troops arrived. Jüri Uluots set up a co-ordinating council in Tartu, yet stopped short of declaring a provisional government The Germans disbanded the provisional government but allowed the armed units in the Omakaitse after Estonia became a part of the German-occupied Reichskommissariat Ostland. During World War II Omakaitse existed from 3 July 1941 – 17 September 1944 at the Eastern Front (World War II).Resistance Occupation Museum of Estonia Background The Omakaitse was a unique organisation in the context of the Eastern Front, as in Latvia, which otherwise shared a common fate with Estonia, there was no organisation of this kind. Formation and Summer War The Estonian Defence League did not completely cease to exist after being closed down during the Soviet occupation in summer 1940. Its members hid some of the weapons but it was done on their own initiative and only in a few locations. They maintained communication, common listening to foreign radio stations was organised as well as discussions of world affairs and future prospects. After the June deportation in 1941 and the breakout of war between Germany and the Soviet Union, the former members of the Defence League and other civilians formed partisan groups in the woods called forest brothers. As clashes with the retreating Soviet 8th Army, destruction battalions and NKVD escalated into the Summer War, the partisan groups formed themselves into Omakaitse of rural municipalities and regions. The formation of countywide structures began right after the arrival of the German 18th Army. The first such organisation was created on 3 July 1941 in the town of Kilingi-Nõmme. It included the units of Omakaitse and forest brothers of rural municipalities. The Pärnu County Omakaitse was formed on 8 July, after the 18th Army had taken the town of Pärnu. The countywide Omakaitse organisations of Valga, Petseri, Võru, Tartu, Viljandi were formed on subsequent days. 9,175 Omakaitse troops attacked the retreating Soviet forces. The battle of Tartu lasted for two weeks and destroyed a large part of the city. Under the leadership of Major Friedrich Kurg, the Omakaitse drove the Soviets from Tartu, behind the rivers Pärnu and Emajõgi, securing South Estonia under Estonian control by 10 July.Tartu in the 1941 Summer War . By Major Riho Rõngelep and Brigadier General Michael Hesselholt Clemmesen (2003). Baltic Defence Review 9 German occupation After the arrival of the 18th Army troops the Omakaitse organisations were subordinated to local Wehrmacht field commanders. This happened in Pärnu on 10 July, in Tartu on 11 July, in Valga on 12 July and in Võru on 14 July. The Omakaitse units disbanded on 29 July 1941 at the orders of the German Army Group North. On voluntary basis, the formations were summoned yet again on 2 August 1941 under the name of the Estonian Omakaitse. The Omakaitse organisation of Tallinn was formed on 28 August and later in Saaremaa island. Members were initially selected from the closest circles of friends. Later, candidate members were asked to sign a declaration that they were not members of a Communist organisation. The Estonian Omakaitse relied on the former regulations of the Estonian Defence League and Estonian Army, insofar as they were consistent with the laws of German occupation. The tasks of the Omakaitse were as follows: # defence of the coast and borders; # fight against parachutists, sabotage, and espionage; # guarding militarily important objects; # fight against Communism; # assistance to Estonian Auxiliary Police and guaranteeing the general safety of the citizens; # providing assistance in case of large-scale accidents (fires, floods, diseases, etc.); # providing military training for its members and other loyal citizens; # deepening and preserving the patriotic and national feelings of citizens. On 15 July, the Omakaitse had 10,200 members, on 1 December 1941, 40,599 members. Until the mobilisations of February 1944, the membership was roughly 40,000. Approximately 1000–1200 men of the Omakaitse (2.5–3%) were directly involved in criminal acts, taking part in the round-up, guarding or killing of 400–1000 Romani people and 6000 Jews in the concentration camps of Pskov region of Russia and Jägala, Vaivara, Klooga, and Lagedi camps in Estonia.Conclusions of the Estonian International Commission for the Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity. Phase II - The German Occupation of Estonia, 1941 - 1944 Guarded among others by the few percent of the Omakaitse, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war died in Estonia, some of them because of neglect and mistreatment and some executed. The Estonian Omakaitse remained a voluntary territorial defense organisation until 2 October 1943, when the Estonian puppet government ('Self- Administration') issued a regulation with regards to calling the male population to Home Guard Service. It became compulsory for men aged 17–45 to become members of the Omakaitse. The regulation on 29 January 1944 made membership of the Omakaitse obligatory for males aged 17–60 and not affected by general mobilisation. The combat battalions consisted in men who either for health reasons or for their age were not mobilised into the German Armed Forces. The men were mostly wearing civilian clothes, but were obliged to wear armbands with distinctive insignia. Their training was incomplete and they were armed with old British, German and Russian rifles and light and heavy machine guns from World War I. Therefore, the Omakaitse territorial battalions were deployed to Lake Peipus coast guard duties and insignificant sectors of the front. However, in the defence of the Väike Emajõgi river line against the Soviet Tartu Offensive in August–September and the Riga Offensive in September 1944, some of the battalions became involved in serious combat operations. When the Army Group North started to withdraw from mainland Estonia, most of the members of the Omakaitse returned to their homes. However, the members who got evacuated to Germany were sent to the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian).

The theme of the song is that of a warning to a girl, either Jana delgada (delicate Joanna) or Na Delgada, a senhal (pet name) meaning \\"delicate lady\\". The line jana delgada (read either as Jana delgada or ja, Na Delgada) is repeated after every two lines as a respos. The song has much in common with Galician-Portuguese cantigas de amigo.

The 100th is equipped with the General Dynamics F-16C+ Fighting Falcon. The 100th FS was one of the Tuskegee Airmen squadrons during World War II, one of the famous all-black squadrons of the 332d Fighter Group, activated on 19 February 1942 at Tuskegee Army Air Field, Alabama. It was returned to duty in 2007 as a replacement of the Alabama ANG 160th Fighter Squadron so the state could honor the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen. History World War II Established in February 1942 at Tuskegee Army Airfield, Alabama to train African-American flight cadets graduated from the Tuskegee Institute Army contract flying school. At Tuskegee, the squadron performed advanced combat flying training. As the number of graduated from the Tuskegee school grew, two additional squadrons the 301st and 302d Fighter Squadrons were activated at Tuskegee Army Airfield, forming the 332d Fighter Group. Due to the segregated status of the Army Air Forces in 1942 and the reluctance by the service to deploy African Americans into combat, the 332d remained in an extended training status. The Group was transferred to Selfridge Army Air Base, near Detroit, Michigan in March 1943 after the decision was reached to deploy the unit. Racial tensions in the Detroit area, however, forced a move to Oscoda Army Airfield, in isolated northeast Michigan the next month where the final training of the unit was performed by First Air Force. However, the unit was delayed again going into combat, and also was sent back to Selfridge upon completion of training at Oscoda AAF to perform Air Defense flights over the Detroit area beginning in July 1943. For six months, the unit remained at Selfridge until pressure on the Army led to the decision to deploy the 100th to the Fifteenth Air Force in Italy at the end of 1943, under the command of Robert B. Tresville, to support the strategic aerial bombardment campaign being carried out by Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator Heavy bombers from newly established air bases in the Foggia, Italy area. As the Italian Campaign pushed further north into Italy during 1944, the squadron moved to operate from forward captured air bases, flying bomber escort missions initially with Republic P-47D Thunderbolts, then being upgraded to the long-range North American P-51D Mustang fighter. In combat, the unit engaged enemy forces in the Rome-Arno area, then during the D-Day landings in France, took part in the Normandy and Northern France campaigns. It returned to the MTO in August 1944, flying combat missions supporting the Invasion of southern France and attacking enemy targets in Northern Italy, Po Valley, the German Rhineland and the Western Allied invasion of Germany during March and April 1945. With the end of the War in Europe in May 1945, the squadron was returned to Southern Italy, being stationed at Lucera Airfield, near Foggia where the unit slowly was demobilized and personnel returned to the United States. The 100th Fighter Squadron was inactivated as an administrative unit at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey in mid-October 1945. Cold War The 332d was re-activated as part of Tactical Air Command Ninth Air Force at Lockbourne Army Airbase (Later Lockbourne AFB), near Columbus, Ohio in July 1947, again as a segregated African-American unit of the Army Air Forces (later United States Air Force). At Lockbourne, the Wing was equipped with new F-47N Thunderbolts that were designed for very-long range flights in the Pacific Theater to attack ground targets in the Japanese Home Islands. However, the aircraft were never deployed due to the sudden end of the War in August 1945. At Lockbourne, the squadron participated in firepower demonstrations, gunnery training, and operational missions to maintain combat proficiency. The African-American segregated unit was inactivated in July 1949 as a result of President Harry S. Truman's Executive Order 9981. EO 9981 abolished racial discrimination in the United States Armed Forces. The 100th's personnel and equipment were reassigned to other units. The 100th was reactivated by Strategic Air Command in 1953 as an integrated squadron, being equipped with Boeing KB-29P Superfortress tankers and given an air refueling mission, based at Robins AFB, near Macon, Georgia. The squadron primarily performed areal refueling of SAC's Boeing B-50 Superfortress medium bombers (the Convair B-36 Peacemaker did not have IFR capability) using a primitive \\"looped hose\\" refueling system. In 1954, the squadron moved to Pease AFB, New Hampshire; received Boeing KC-97 Stratotankers and performed aerial refueling with SAC's Boeing B-47 Stratojet units, deploying frequently to England and Morocco in North Africa to operate from what were called \\"REFLEX\\" bases to refuel SAC bombers prior to their planned flights into Communist-controlled Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. The 100th Air Refueling Squadron continued to operate from Pease until the end of the B-47 and REFLEX era in 1966, at which point the unit was inactivated. Air Training Command re-activated the 100th as a Flying Training Squadron at Williams AFB, Phoenix, Arizona in September 1989 to demonstrate the feasibility of Air Training Command's plan for five flying training squadrons at each pilot training base. It's instructor pilots provided incoming pilots qualification in T-37 and T-38 aircraft, and as instructor pilots. The squadron was inactivated as part of the post-Cold War draw-down of the Air Force in 1993. Post-Cold War era In 1999, the 100th Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron was activated as a provisional United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) Expeditionary aerial refueling squadron. Its mission was the refuel NATO combat aircraft during the 1999 Kosovo Campaign, Operation Allied Force. Consisting of Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers from the 100th Air Refueling Wing, RAF Mildenhall, England, the squadron was active between April–June 1999 when the Kosovo Campaign ended. After the Kosovo Campaign, the 100th was again re-activated as a flying training squadron at Randolph AFB, Texas, equipped with Beechcraft T-6 Texan II, Raytheon T-1 Jayhawk and Northrop T-38C Talon trainers. It provided flight training to new air force pilot trainees throughout the early 21st century. Alabama Air National Guard More than 150 US Air National Guardsmen from the 187th Fighter Wing, the Alabama Air National Guard unit at Dannelly Field ANGB in Montgomery, deployed to Romania in August to participate in Dacian Viper 2012, a three-week joint exercise with the Romanian Air Force. In 2007, the Alabama legislature requested the National Guard Bureau to allow the Alabama Air National Guard 160th Fighter Squadron to be re-designated as the 100th Fighter Squadron so the state could honor the legacy of the World War II Tuskegee Airmen. This was obtained from the Air Force and on 12 September 2009, the 100th Flying Training Squadron was inactivated. The designation was transferred to the National Guard Bureau by the Air Force and it was allotted to the Alabama ANG. As a result, the 160th Fighter Squadron was inactivated, and the new 100th Fighter Squadron assumed its personnel, equipment and aircraft. The 160th Fighter Squadron stood down in a ceremony at Montgomery Air National Guard Base, on 13 September 2007, with the 100th Fighter Squadron standing up and being bequeathed the history, lineage, and honors of the World War II 100th Fighter Squadron and its successor units. From the onset the squadron started training on the block 30 version of the General Dynamics F-16C/D Fighting Falcon that carried over from the 160th FS. The squadron flies the F-16 in a traditional air defense and conventional attack role. In August 2009, the 100th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron deployed 240 airmen and aircraft to Balad AB, Iraq as part of the 332d Expeditionary Fighter Squadron supporting Operation Iraq Freedom. This was the first deployment of the 100th FS to the middle east and over 2,000 hours were flown and Precision Guided Munitions were employed. The unit returned to Montgomery in November 2009. The squadron deployed to Romania in August 2012 to participate in Dacian Viper 2012, a three-week joint exercise with the Romanian Air Force. The Alabama ANG contingent, which included nearly twenty fighter pilots and eight F-16s, exercised with approximately 200 Romanian soldiers, technical staff, and pilots flying six Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 \\"Fishbed\\" fighters at 71st Air Base, located near the town of Câmpia Turzii in the northwestern part of Romania. In December 2017, the Air Force announced that the 100th was one of two Air National Guard squadrons selected for equipping with the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. The conversion to the fifth-generation jet fighter is scheduled for 2023.

It was last assigned to the 187th Fighter Wing, stationed at Montgomery Air National Guard Base, Alabama. It was inactivated on 13 September 2007, with personnel and equipment being transferred to the 100th Fighter Squadron. History Authorized by the National Guard Bureau in 1947 as the 160th Fighter Squadron, Alabama Air National Guard. Organized at Birmingham Municipal Airport and extended recognition as a new unit on 1 October 1947 with no previous World War II history or lineage. The squadron was assigned to the 117th Fighter Group and equipped with F-51D Mustangs. The unit's initial mission was the air defense of Alabama. Was re-equipped with RF-51D Mustangs in 1950, being assigned to Tactical Air Command. Its mission was changed to daylight aerial reconnaissance. Its aircraft were former World War II F-5 Mustangs which had been used in the United States in a training role. Korean War activation thumbrightLockheed RF-80C-11-LO Shooting Star Serial 45-8391 in the foreground, along with other RF-80s of the 160th Tactical Recon Squadron, 1952. (Photo taken at Neubiberg AB, West Germany) The squadron and its parent 117th Fighter Group were federalized due to the Korean War on 10 October 1950. On 1 November the Mustangs were transferred to other units and the 160th was re-equipped with RF-80A Shooting Star photo- reconnaissance jets and transferred to Lawson AFB, Georgia. At Lawson, the wartime group was formed as the 160th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, the 157th TRS (South Carolina ANG) (RF-80) and 112th TRS (Ohio ANG) (RB-26). The 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Group was assigned to Ninth Air Force, Tactical Air Command. After over a year at Lawson AFB for transition training, and also because the Groups planned base, Toul-Rosières Air Base, France was under construction, finally in January 1952 the group deployed to the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). However at the time of the 117th's arrival, Toul AB consisted of a sea of mud, and the new jet runway was breaking up and could not support safe flying. The commander of the 117th deemed it uninhabitable and its flying squadrons of the wing were dispersed to West Germany. The 112th TRS was transferred to Wiesbaden AB, the 157th TRS deployed to Fürstenfeldbruck AB, and the 160th deployed to Neubiberg AB. The non-flying Headquarters and Support organizations were assigned to Toul. The mission of the 117 TRG was to provide tactical, visual, photographic and electronic reconnaissance by both day and night, as was required by the military forces within the European command. The RF-80's were responsible for the daylight operations; the RB-26s for night photography. In June 1952, the 117th was involved in Exercise 'June Primer'. This exercise took place in an area bordered by a line drawn from Cherbourg to Geneva in the east and in the west by the Swiss, Austrian and Russian occupation zone borders. The two RF-80 squadrons of the 117th had to complete a number of varying missions, including vertical photography of prospective paratroop air drop zones, oblique photos of the Rhine and Danube river bridges, vertical photography of the airfields of Jever, Fassburg, Celle, Sundorf and Gütersloh and various visual missions on behalf of the seventh army, including artillery adjustment for the 816th field artillery. The 157 TRS had had wire recorders fitted to five of its RF-80's prior to June Primer and these greatly facilitated the latter missions. By July 1952 the facilities at Wiesbaden AB were becoming very crowded, and it was felt that the B-26's could fly from the primitive conditions at Toul. The 112 TRS returned to Toul, however the jet-engined RF-80's remained in West Germany until a new runway was constructed. On 9 July 1952 the activated Air National Guard 117 TRG was released from active duty. All of the aircraft and support equipment remained at Toul. The 117 TRG was inactivated and its mission was taken over by the newly activated 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing. Cold War 160th TRS Republic RF-84F-40-RE Thunderflash 53-7538, about 1960 The squadron was returned to Alabama State Control and was re-formed in Birmingham in the fall of 1952, being re-equipped with the RF-51D Mustang. Sharing the facility with the 106th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron as well as the expanding civil airport led to congestion and in 1953, the 160th TRS was moved to the Montgomery Regional Airport. The Mustangs were at the end of their USAF service in 1955 and the squadron received RF-80s which were also at the end of the line for their USAF service. On 28 September 1956 its parent 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Group was inactivated and discontinued. The reason was that the Groups World War II predecessor unit, the 354th Fighter Group, was re-activated at the new Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina. The 117th designation was re-allotted to the Alabama ANG as a new organization, with no World War II lineage or history, and federal recognition was extended the same day. Also in 1956, the 160th began to receive new RF-84F Thunderstreak jet photo-reconnaissance aircraft directly from Republic, replacing the obsolete RF-80s. The squadron continued to operate the RF-84s for the next fifteen years. During the 1961 Berlin Crisis, the 117th TRG was again federalized, along with the 160th TRS on 1 October 1961. The federalized 117th TRG consisted of the 106th TRS at Birmingham; the 153d TRS (Mississippi ANG); the 184th TRS (Arizona ANG), and the 117th. Due to federal budget restrictions, only the 106th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron was deployed to Dreux-Louvilliers AB, France. However elements of all three other squadrons rotated to France as part of the USAFE 7117th Tactical Wing until the crisis was defused and the 117th TRG and subordinate squadrons were returned to their various state control on 31 August 1962. On 15 October 1962, the 160th was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 187th Tactical Reconnaissance Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 160th TRS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 187th Headquarters, 1187th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 187th Combat Support Squadron, and the 187th USAF Dispensary. In 1971 the RF-4C Phantom II photo-reconnaissance aircraft was being withdrawn from Southeast Asia, and the 160th began to receive these Vietnam War veteran aircraft. The RF-84Fs were retired and during the 1970s the squadron flew the Phantoms in its aerial reconnaissance mission. Tactical Fighter 160th Tactical Fighter Squadron – McDonnell F-4D-30-MC Phantom 66-7591 In 1983 the 117th was re-aligned from its photo-reconnaissance mission and converted to a tactical fighter mission, transferring its RF-4Cs and receiving Vietnam Veteran F-4D Phantom IIs. The Phantoms were primarily used for Air Defense as part of the Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC) division of TAC. By 1988 the Phantoms were being withdrawn from the Air Force inventory, and the 160th began to receive Block 30 F-16C/D Fighting Falcons to use in the air defense mission. During the 1990s, the 187th has undertaken an ambitious and successful regimen of participation in many Total Force deployments. These deployments have taken the men and women of the 187th to exercises in South Korea, Norway, Guam, Hawaii, Alaska, and many other stateside locations. By far the most significant deployments have been for contingency operations enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq. In 1995, the unit deployed for a 30-day rotation to Incirlik AB, Turkey for Operation Provide Comfort II. The following year, the Wing deployed to Al Jaber AB, Kuwait for Operation Southern Watch. Then in 1997, the Wing returned to Incirlik for Operation Northern Watch. These operations were to enforce the respective northern and southern no-fly zones over Iraq.

The unit sustained this effort for Operation Noble Eagle for one year following the events of 11 September. The 187th was again called to active duty in January until April 2003 as part of the largest military mobilization since the 1991 Gulf War. This marked the largest unit activation in the units 50-year history with over 500 personnel being deployed along with aircraft and equipment for Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). The 187th, as an integral part of the Total Force, deployed to Prince Hassan Air Base (H-5) and Shahid Muafaq Al-Salti Air Base, Jordan, as the lead unit, commanding a mixture of Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, Active Air Force and British Royal Air Force units comprising the 410th Air Expeditionary Wing. This marked the largest integration of coalition Air and Special Forces Operations in history with over 3,500 personnel operating out of this location. The 410th's mission was to prevent Iraqi missile launches against coalition forces and neighboring countries. In September 2004 the unit again deployed over 300 personnel with aircraft and equipment to Al Udeid AB, Qatar for Operation Iraqi Freedom. This deployment also marked a significant first for the unit and the U.S. Military. The 187th was the first unit to ever use the GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munition in combat. The GBU-38 is a 500 lb global positioning system (GPS) guided bomb which, while being very effective, minimizes collateral damage. The GBU-38 is a precision guided munition commonly referred to as a \\"Smart Bomb\\". This weapon was effectively employed by the 187th in the Battle of Fallujah. In 2006, the 160th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron deployed to Balad AB, Iraq for 90 days and became part of the 322d Expeditionary Fighter Squadron in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). Inactivation In 2007, it was announced that the Alabama Air National Guard would activate the 100th Fighter Squadron so the state could honor the legacy of the World War II Tuskegee Airmen. As a result, the 160th Fighter Squadron would be inactivated, and the new 100th FS would assume its personnel, equipment and aircraft. The 160th Fighter Squadron stood down in a ceremony at Montgomery Air National Guard Base, on 13 September 2007, with the 100th Fighter Squadron standing up and being bequeathed the history, lineage, and honors of the World War II 100th Fighter Squadron and its successor units.

It lies on the northwest (Bering Sea) coastal side of central Aleutians East Borough. Most of the refuge (300,000 acres) was designated as Wilderness in 1980 under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. The refuge is administered from offices in Cold Bay. Izembek National Wildlife Refuge lies between the highly productive waters of the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. Within the heart of the refuge is Izembek Lagoon, a long and wide coastal ecosystem that contains one of the world's largest eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds. More than 200 species of wildlife and nine species of fish can be found on the refuge. Millions of migratory waterfowl and shorebirds find food and shelter in the coastal lagoons and freshwater wetlands on their way to and from their subarctic and arctic breeding grounds. This extraordinary abundance and diversity of waterfowl has attracted international attention. In 1986, Izembek National Wildlife Refuge and Izembek State Game Refuge, which encompasses the submerged land of Izembek Lagoon, was the first wetland area in the United States to be recognized as a Wetland of International Importance by the Ramsar Convention. In 2001, Izembek Refuge was also designated as a Globally Important Bird Area by the National Audubon Society. Attempts have been made to build a road through the refuge connecting the towns of King Cove to Cold Bay. One such attempt proposed a land transfer of of land owned by the state of Alaska and the King Cove Corporation in exchange for construction of a single-lane road which would pass through Izembek NWR. Environmentalists contended the road threatens the population of the migratory black brant and other species. This attempted land transfer was ultimately blocked by the Department of the Interior in 2013.https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-jewell-issues-decision-on- izembek-national-wildlife-refuge-land-exchange-and-road-proposal In January 2018 the Trump administration proposed a different land transfer agreement. Nine environmental groups sued the administration one week later,https://www.apnews.com/538aeb2b63dc4c5c9221bf7e829e2746 arguing that the four-year environmental impact statement commissioned by the Department of the Interior had already determined that the road was unnecessary and would irreversibly damage the refuge. A ruling on March 29, 2019 by the United States District Court for the District of Alaska once again blocked the land transfer,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-oil-trump-leases/u-s-judge- scraps-trump-order-opening-arctic-atlantic-areas-to-oil-leasing-idUSKCN1RB0FP finding that the Trump administration's attempts to remove acreage from the refuge contradicted the existing environmental impact statement and made no attempt to explain why the statement was no longer applicable. Fauna Mammals that roam this refuge include brown bears, red foxes and caribou. Raptors which prey on the many species of rodents, birds, and fish in this area include bald and golden eagles, rough-legged hawks, gyrfalcons, and Peale's peregrine falcons. Marine mammals are common in the productive waters surrounding this refuge. Harbor seals, Steller's sea lions, and sea otters inhabit nearby coastal waters and lagoons. Harbor seals frequently haul out on sandbars in the lagoons and along the coast. Orcas, gray whales, and minke whales can sometimes be seen as they migrate along the shoreline and occasionally inside of Izembek Lagoon.

Since 1973, it has been directed by the American dancer and choreographer John Neumeier. In addition there is a ballet school, , established in 1978. The performances of the Hamburg Ballet are usually held at the Hamburg State Opera, while the training and education facility is the \\"Ballettzentrum Hamburg - John Neumeier\\". The Hamburg Ballet is well known for guest performances at home and abroad. In the season 2012/13 the company celebrated its 40th anniversary. History On August 16, 1973, John Neumeier took over as ballet Director and Chief Choreographer of the ballet department of the Hamburg State Opera. At that time the dancers worked at the opera the whole time, as the opera house included the stage and the ballet studios. The first performance of the company under the new leadership was a Ballet Workshop (\\"Ballett-Werkstatt\\") titled \\"Classical Technique in Modern Choreographies\\" on September 9, 1973. Later the Ballet Workshops developed into a hallmark of The Hamburg Ballet. On September 30, 1973, the dancers presented their first program with \\"Divertimento No. 15\\", \\"Allegro Brillante\\", \\"Désir\\" and \\"Jeu de cartes“. In January, 1974 The Hamburg Ballet had its first premiere: \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" originally choreographed by John Neumeier for the Frankfurt Ballet in 1971. Neumeier danced Romeo, and Marianne Kruuse was Juliet. For the 40th anniversary, this ballet to Sergej Prokofjew’s score was revived on April 11th, 2013. On May 12th, 1974 the first world premiere of a ballet by John Neumeier took place in Hamburg. The ballet \\"Meyerbeer – Schumann\\" tells the story of the composers Giacomo Meyerbeer and Robert Schumann. The lead roles were danced by Max Midinet (Meyerbeer) and François Klaus (Schumann). In 1974 the Hamburg Ballet was invited to perform abroad for the first time. Since then touring is part of every season of the Hamburg Ballet. Over the last 40 years the company has travelled to 29 countries and 4 continents - including France, Russia, China and Brazil. During the 2013/14 season they will perform in Costa Mesa (California) and Vienna (Austria). From June 14–22, 1975 the first Hamburg Ballet Days (\\"Hamburger Ballett-Tage\\") took place. Together with the “Nijinsky Gala”, which concludes the Ballet Days, they became a tradition. On January 1, 1978 John Neumeier founded the School of The Hamburg Ballet. Originally, the students trained at the Hamburg State Opera. Later the school moved to the “Bierpalast” and on September 23, 1989 the “Ballettzentrum Hamburg – John Neumeier” opened. The Ballet Center is the home of the company, the school and the National Youth Ballet (“Bundesjugendballett”), which was founded by John Neumeier in 2011. Repertoire Over the last 40 years, The Hamburg Ballet has developed a broad repertoire, which includes over one hundred and twenty of John Neumeier's choreographies. The main interest of the Director and Chief Choreographer of The Hamburg Ballet is to create new, contemporary forms in connection with the classical ballet tradition. On stage One of John Neumeier’s artistic focuses lies on the revision of evening-length narrative ballets such as \\"The Nutcracker\\" (1971), \\"Illusions - like Swan Lake\\" (1976), \\"A Cinderella’s Story\\" (1992), \\"Sylvia\\" (1997), which was originally created for the ballet of the Paris Opera, and \\"Giselle\\" (2000). The repertoire of The Hamburg Ballet also includes a variety of ballets choreographed to orchestral music. Of special importance is John Neumeier’s \\"Third Symphony of Gustav Mahler\\" (1975). Taken together with other ballets set to the music by Mahler, Neumeier's works form a cycle. In addition, John Neumeier has created ballets to Johann Sebastian Bach's \\"Saint Matthew Passion\\" (1980) and \\"Christmas Oratorio\\" (Part I – III premiered in 2007, the complete work will premiere on December 8, 2013), Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's \\"Requiem\\" (1991) and George Frideric Handel's \\"Messiah\\" (1999). In addition, various composers were commissioned to compose for John Neumeier's ballets. One of them is Alfred Schnittke, who contributed the music to \\"Peer Gynt\\" (1989). Lera Auerbach composed the music for \\"Préludes CV\\" (2003) and \\"The Little Mermaid\\" (2005). In addition, the company dances ballets based on world literature. John Neumeier created \\"The Lady of the Camellias\\" (1978) based on the novel by Alexandre Dumas and \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" (1983) based on Tennessee Williams for Marcia Haydée. Neumeier has also created adaptations of Henrik Ibsen's \\"Peer Gynt\\" (1989), Homer's \\"Odyssey\\" (1995), Anton Chekhov's \\"The Seagull\\" (2002) and Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice” (2003). William Shakespeare plays a very important role for the Director and Chief Choreographer. With inspiration from the Elizabethan writer, John Neumeier choreographed “As You Like It” (1985), “Hamlet” (1985), “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” (1977), “Romeo and Juliet” (1971), “VIVALDI or What you will” (1996) and “Othello” (1985). A revival of the latter opens the season 2013/14. Most recently John Neumeier turned Ferenc Molnár's \\"Liliom\\" into a ballet (2011). Another important aspect in John Neumeier's artistic work is the exploration of musical genre. He staged Leonard Bernstein's \\"West Side Story\\" (1978) and \\"On the Town\\" (1991). He also developed a rhapsodic form, which can be found in the ballet revue \\"Shall we dance?\\" (1986) and in \\"Bernstein Dances\\" (1998). The Hamburg Ballet does not only dance creations by John Neumeier though. The repertoire of the company includes ballets by George Balanchine, Maurice Béjart, John Cranko and Mats Ek, among others. There are also reconstructions of historical choreographies, such as Vaslav Nijinsky's \\"Le Sacre du Printemps\\" by Millicent Hodson. In the season 2010/11 the works of \\"Dances at a Gathering\\" and \\"The Concert\\" by Jerome Robbins became part of the repertoire as \\"Chopin Dances\\". In 2012, The Hamburg Ballet performed “Renku”, choreographed by company members Yuka Oishi and Orkan Dann. The same year a new production of John Cranko’s Onegin was staged at the Hamburg State Opera. Film versions A film version of John Neumeier's \\"Lady of the Camellias\\" premiered in 1987. The lead roles were danced by Marcia Haydée (Marguerite) and Ivan Liska (Armand Duval). In addition, the German broadcasters NDR and ZDF filmed \\"Third Symphony of Gustav Mahler\\", \\"Wendung\\" (String Quintet in C major by Franz Schubert), \\"Kinderszenen\\" (1974) and \\"Othello\\". \\"Illusions - like Swan Lake\\", \\"Death in Venice\\" and \\"Saint Matthew Passion\\" with dancers of The Hamburg Ballet were also filmed. Features Ballet Workshops Since 1973 the Ballet Workshops (“Ballett-Werkstätte”), shown several times each season, are traditionally held on a Sunday morning. John Neumeier speaks about a topic, which is then illustrated by the company. He explains creative processes to the public and examines other dance related subjects, such as: \\"The Petipa Era\\" (1978), \\"Revival of a Ballet - Copy or Creation\\" (1987) or \\"Danced Violence\\" (1988). Newer Ballet Workshops covered themes such as \\"Orpheus and...\\", \\"The Little Mermaid reappears\\" or \\"Debut\\". A four-part Ballet Workshop was recorded by the German broadcaster NDR. It made the work of the main soloists in the 80s (Marianne Kruuse, Ivan Liska, Kevin Haigen) known to a wider audience. In 1982 four more workshops were produced for television. In the season 2012/13 John Neumeier and his company gave the audience insight into the development of his ballets for the 200th time. Hamburg Ballet-Days Since 1975 the Hamburg Ballet Days (“Hamburger Ballett-Tage”) have been established as festival at the end of the season. The festival usually starts with the premiere of a new ballet. In 2014, The Hamburg Ballet Days will open with the premiere of John Neumeier's \\"Tatiana\\" with a newly commissioned score by Lera Auerbach, a ballet after the verse novel by Alexander Puschkin. The festival concludes with the \\"Nijinsky-Gala\\", where The Hamburg Ballet and international acclaimed guest dancers present excerpts of various ballets. The Gala is dedicated to the great dancer and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky. Traditionally, during the festival another renowned ballet company gives guest performances at the Hamburg State Opera. In 2010, the Tokyo Ballet visited, and in 2013 the Bayerisches Staatsballett as well as Les Ballets de Monte Carlo were guests in Hamburg. At the end of the season 2013/14 Nederlands Dans Theater will give guest performances. The Ballet Center Hamburg – John Neumeier entrance of Ballettzentrum Hamburg The School of The Hamburg Ballet was established in 1978. The ballet students are taught at the Ballet Center Hamburg (“Ballettzentrum Hamburg – John Neumeier”). The building, once a secondary school for girls, is one of the last buildings designed by the famous Hamburg architect Fritz Schumacher. There are nine ballet studios, where both members of the company, as well as students, can train and rehearse. In addition, the boarding school can house 35 young people. The international students, aged 10 to 18 years, are educated to become professional stage dancers. The syllabus gives priority to all aspects of classical-academic dance. In addition, there are courses on modern dance technique, dance composition and folklore. The criteria for admission to the school are physical aptitude, rhythmic ability, dancing disposition, talent for improvisation and the level of classical ballet technique in relation to age. The entrance exams are held every year in spring. The minimum age for the preschool is 7 to 9 years, for training classes 10 to 16 years and for theater classes 16 to 18 years. Today about 80% of the company dancers have been educated at the School of The Hamburg Ballet. The school is supported by the clubs Friends of the Hamburg Ballet Centre (“Freunde des Ballettzentrums Hamburg”) and Ballet Friends Hamburg (“Ballettfreunde Hamburg”). The Ballet Centre is also the home of the first German National Youth Ballet (“Bundesjugendballett”), but legally it does not belong to The Hamburg Ballet. The Foundation John Neumeier The Foundation John Neumeier was established on February 23, 2006. Together with the Hamburg State Opera and the Ballet Center Hamburg, the Foundation represents the third part of John Neumeier’s artistic activities in the city. The foundation under curator Hans-Michael Schäfer serves science, research and documentation. Its function and aim is to preserve and portray the history of ballet through words and images, documents and objects. In this way, the achievements of John Neumeier and in particular his work with The Hamburg Ballet will be displayed.

History Planning for a base for the nascent Luftwaffe near Roth started in the mid-1930s. Building works not only for an air base but also for regular barracks started in 1937 and were completed in 1938. The first unit to occupy the base was a pilot training school relocated from Landsberg Air Base near Penzing. During World War II, a number of Luftwaffe fighter wings were stationed at Roth. In 1945 the airfield was bombed by aircraft of the USAAF and surrendered to American forces on 8 April 1945. Subsequently, the base was used as storage facility for ammunition and bombs. In 1954 Roth's Amateur Pilot Club received permission to use the airstrip. This permission has never been revoked and is still valid. In 1956 the air base was handed over to the German military, first to the Luftwaffe, which used it for the basic training of its recruits, and in 1961 to the German Army which utilised the facilities to house units of its Army Aviation Corps on the base, extending and improving the already existing structures. The first aircraft to be stationed at Roth Air Base were Alouette II and Do 27 and in 1963 Army Aviation Battalion 4 was founded at Roth. In the same year, the air base was given the name Otto Lilienthal Barracks after the pioneer of human aviation. After the phasing out of the Do 27, the battalion received helicopters of the type Bell UH-1D in 1969. During the following decade a number of German Army Aviation Corps' units were stationed at Roth Air Base only to be relocated within a few years or to be renamed. In 1980 Army Aviation Regiment 26 received helicopters of the type Bo 105 and in 2004 the regiment was renamed Army Aviation Attack Helicopter Regiment 26 and was given the honorary name Franken (i.e. Franconia), this being a result of the German Army's continuing commitment to the base at the time. Beginning in 2009 Army Aviation Attack Helicopter Regiment 26 was to receive 32 helicopters of the type Eurocopter Tiger, replacing the Bo 105. In order to accommodate this new helicopter, extensive construction works to build two hangars for storage and maintenance had started in 2007 and were completed in 2009. However, due to technical problems, the deliveries were delayed and ultimately did not take place. Even though Army Aviation Attack Helicopter Regiment 26 is the air base's main occupant, small units of other parts of the armed forces are also stationed at this location, namely Army Aviation Squadron 269, two squadrons of the Luftwaffe's Air Defence Artillery Group 23 equipped with Patriot surface-to-air missiles, parts of the Luftwaffe's Training Regiment and its staff, and also parts of Central Medical Services. Approximately 2,800 military and civilian personnel are currently employed at Roth Air Base. Coat of arms of Army Aviation Regiment 26 In October 2011 the German Federal Ministry of Defence announced a reorganisation/reduction of the German Armed Forces. As a consequence, Army Aviation Attack Helicopter Regiment 26 and auxiliary units as well the two squadrons of the Luftwaffe's Air Defence Artillery Group 23 and the Luftwaffe's Training Regiment will be disbanded. The Luftwaffe's Officers Training School will relocate from Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base to Roth. The Central Medical Services will be expanded into a regional medical centre. Additionally, a regiment of Feldjäger (Military Police) will also be moved to Roth. However, after the implementation of these cuts and relocation the number of military personnel based at Roth Air Base will be reduced by more than 80 per cent to 540.Quoted from , PDF-file \\"Die Stationierung der Bundeswehr in Deutschland\\", p. 60 With the relocation of the last attack helicopters in 2014, military flying operations at Roth Air Base will cease to exist.

He was a member of the Croatian Peasant Party from its founding in 1904. He was assassinated in the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in Belgrade in 1928. Basariček was the son of Stjepan Basariček and Amalija (née Pogačnik), natives of Đurđevac. He finished elementary school, gymnasium and a law degree in Zagreb where he also received his doctorate in law in 1907. He served as a judge in Slavonski Brod and in Zagreb. He was active in relocating disadvantaged children from Istria and Bosnia and Herzegovina to more fertile areas, largely in Slavonia and Podravina. In 1919, Basariček began his involvement in the colonization of Slavonia from areas such Gorski kotar and Lika, and continued with this cause until his death. From the founding of the Croatian Peasant Party, Basariček collaborated with its leader Stjepan Radić. Believing as Radić did that the Croats needed to embrace Pan-Slavism, Basariček learned Czech and Russian. He was elected to the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes four times: in 1920, 1923, 1925 and 1927. In 1927 he addressed the assembly saying that \\"dark powers\\" were preparing a dictatorship which was \\"equally dangerous to the Croats and to Serbdom\\". On 20 June 1928, Basariček was assassinated by Radical representative Puniša Račić. In the attack Pavle Radić was also killed and Stjepan Radić was fatally wounded. The event led to King Alexander's proclamation of a dictatorship in the Kingdom on 6 January 1929 and the renaming of the country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

The 184th is equipped with the MQ-9 Reaper. In June 2014 the squadron transitioned from A-10C to the MQ-9. Overview The 184th Attack Squadron MQ-9 Reaper Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) mission is to provide close air support (CAS), air interdiction, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), and attack to eliminate threats when present. The multi- role capabilities of these RPAs allows Combat Search and Rescue operations and extended time over targets to locate, track, target, strike, and assess time sensitive targets. History Tactical Reconnaissance Authorized by the National Guard Bureau in 1953 at the 184th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron. Organized at Fort Smith Regional Airport, Arkansas and extended recognition as a new unit on 15 October 1953. The squadron was assigned to the Tennessee ANG 118th Tactical Reconnaissance Group, Berry Field, Nashville, for administration, operational control was exercised by the Arkansas Air National Guard. The 184th TRS was initially equipped with World War II-era RB-26C Invader night photo-reconnaissance aircraft. The black-painted RB-26s were originally medium bombers that were modified for aerial reconnaissance in the late 1940s. Most of the aircraft received were Korean War veterans, were unarmed and carried cameras and flash flares for night aerial photography. In 1956, the B-26 was reaching the end of its operational USAF service, and the squadron was re-equipped with RF-80A Shooting Star daylight reconnaissance aircraft that were also nearly obsolescent. In January 1957, the 184th retired its worn-out RF-80s and received new RF-84F Thunderstreak reconnaissance aircraft, manufactured for Air National Guard use. During the 1961 Berlin Crisis, the squadron was federalized and assigned to the mobilized Kentucky ANG 123d Tactical Reconnaissance Group however it remained at Fort Smith and was released from active duty and returned to Arkansas state control on 22 August 1962. On 22 August 1962, the 184th was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 188th Tactical Reconnaissance Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 184th TRS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 188th Headquarters, 188th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 188th Combat Support Squadron, and the 188th USAF Dispensary. In 1970 with the winding-down of the Vietnam War, the 184th began receiving McDonnell RF-101C Voodoos, replacing the RF-84Fs the unit had been flying for over a decade. The USAF had, however, planned for the RF-101C to be gradually phased out of USAF service in favor of the McDonnell RF-4C Phantom II and the aircraft remained with the 184th TRS for only a brief period of time, and in 1970 was retired. Tactical Fighter Lockheed RF-80A-5-LO Shooting Star 45-8371, about 1955 Gunsmoke '85\\" exercise on 6 October 1985. F-16Cs Arkansas ANG at Ft Smith 2002 Following their withdrawal from the Vietnam War, numerous USAF F-100D Super Sabres were turned over to the Air National Guard. Tactical Air Command realigned the 151st into a Tactical Fighter Group in 1972, and equipping the unit with Vietnam Veteran F-100D and twin-seat F-100F Trainers. In 1979, the Super Sabre was being retired and the 184th TFS began receiving F-4C Phantom IIs to be used in an air defense role. In 1988, as part of the retirement of the Phantom II, the squadron began receiving Block 15 F-16A Fighting Falcons. The first F-16 delivery to the squadron was on 1 July 1988 and the formal acceptance of the F-16 happened on 15 October. On 15 March 1992 the 184th dropped the Tactical name from the squadron as the parent 184th converted to the USAF Objective organization. In early 2001 the 184th FS began to retire its F-16A/B block 15s to AMARC in exchange for F-16C block 32s. They never received any D-models. Because the squadron flew the rarely seen block 32, the squadron became a source for spare F-16s for the USAF Thunderbirds flight demonstration team. In the end the 184th FS never had to give up any of their aircraft as the Thunderbirds took needed aircraft from home based Nellis 57th Fighter Wing. Deployed to Prince Sultan AB, Saudi Arabia (24 October 2002 to December 2002) in support of Operation Southern Watch. In 2005, the 188th deployed nearly 300 Airmen and multiple F-16C Fighting Falcons to Balad Air Base, Iraq, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. BRAC 2005 BRAC 2005 initially decided to inactivate the 188th Fighter Wing and close Fort Smith ANGB. With a great deal of effort by Arkansas' leaders caused the BRAC panel to change its decision on the 184th FS and give it a new mission. The squadron would still lose its F-16s but in their place would get a total of eighteen A-10 Thunderbolt II ground attack aircraft. One of the deciding factors was Fort Smiths location near Fort Chaffee, a former National Guard training post. On 18 October 2006 the 184th FS began giving up F-16s when two departed for the 194th Fighter Squadron located at Fresno Air National Guard Base, California. By April 2007 the 184th FS had already begun to receive the A-10 from the Massachusetts ANG 104th Fighter Wing and pilots had already commenced cross training in October. On 14 April 2007 the 184th FS marked the day with a celebration 'Viper Out/Warthog In' day. The 184th FS took the opportunity to display their new A-10 paint scheme and to still fly the F-16 but the 184th FS at this point was officially an A-10 unit. Current status In early 2012 the Air Force planned to realign the 188th Fighter Wing and replace its 20 A-10 aircraft, converting the 184th FS to operate the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, after extensive discussions in August 2012 it was announced that the 188th Fighter Wing would retain its A-10s. In July 2012, the Wing deployed 275 airmen and aircraft to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. They were assigned to the 455th Air Expeditionary Wing, Bagram Airfield, near Kabul. This was the second AEF deployment for the 188th as a unit since receiving A-10 Thunderbolt II \\"Warthogs\\" April 14, 2007. The 188th's last AEF deployment transpired in 2010 when the unit deployed about 300 Airmen and 12 A-10Cs to the 451st Air Expeditionary Wing at Kandahar Airfield. The guardsmen remained in Afghanistan until October, flying close- air support in response to ground troops who may be in contact with the enemy, or to escort convoys in particularly hostile areas. When not supporting ground troops, A-10s patrol designated sectors and provided aerial reconnaissance on locations of interest to ground commanders. In three months, Arkansas ANG A-10s delivered more than 60,000 30mm cannon rounds and more than 250 precision munitions on enemy targets. In June 2014, the last of the units A-10C aircraft departed and the unit was re-designated the 184th Attack Squadron.

He was then moved to the tackle position in 1962 and had more playing time than any other Michigan player that year. At the end of the 1962 season, he was voted by his teammates to be the captain of the 1963 Michigan Wolverines football team. In 1963, O'Donnell moved back to the guard position, and also served as the team's punter. He averaged 36.4 yards per kick on 48 punts during the 1963 season. In the 1963 season opener against SMU, he faked a punt and ran 50 yards for a touchdown. The fake punt was not a called play. O'Donnell said after the game that he saw one side of SMU's line collapse and took off. He also recovered two fumbles in a 1963 victory over Northwestern. At the end of the 1963 season, the Associated Press selected O'Donnell as a first-team player on its 1963 All-Big Ten Conference football team. O'Donnell was also an outstanding student at Michigan. He was named to the Big Ten All- Academic teams in 1962 and 1963 and, in 1964, was named to the All-Time All- Academic Big Ten football team. Professional football O'Donnell was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the third round of the 1964 NFL Draft and by the Buffalo Bills in the 13th round of the AFL draft (in that era, the AFL and NFL were separate leagues and held separate drafts). He chose to play for the Bills. O'Donnell played for the Bills, primarily as their right guard from 1964 through 1971. In 1964, he was selected to play in the AFL Pro Bowl. He was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals prior to the 1972 season in exchange for guard Irv Goode. He chose to retire from pro football prior to the 1972 season and so never played with the Cardinals. In 1974, he came out of retirement to play for the Birmingham Americans of the World Football League (WFL). He played for the WFL's Birmingham Vulcans in the 1975 season until the league collapsed. Post-retirement After retiring from football, O'Donnell started and ran several businesses including a floor-covering business called \\"Yardage Distributors\\", and a butcher-shop/bakery called \\"The Butcher - The Baker\\". In 1978, he moved his family from their farm in Eden, New York back to Milan, Michigan. He was active in civic affairs in Milan serving on the school board for many years. In the 1980s he organized the annual \\"Great American Pig Roast\\" which was a successful fundraising event for the school district. He also served on the coaching staff at Milan High School for many years. In 2010, the high school football field in Milan was renamed \\"Joe O'Donnell Field\\" in recognition of his service to the community and the football program. In the late 1980s O'Donnell provided the color commentary for the radio broadcasts of the University of Michigan football games on the Michigan Farm Radio Network. O'Donnell was married to Caroline (Kerr) O'Donnell (deceased) and has three sons. He died from complications of Alzheimer's disease in 2019.

Biography Buns was born in GeldernGeldern belonged in that time to the Spanish Netherlands (see also Southern Netherlands) and from 1713 to the Austrian Netherlands; the Dutch language was spoken up to 1870; from 1713 Geldern belonged to Prussia see Geldern. (near Kevelaer), which is now a part of Germany, and died in Boxmeer, the Netherlands. In 1659 Buns entered the monastery of the Carmelites in Geldern.At the time, Geldern belonged to the Spanish Netherlands His first name is unknown. Work in Boxmeer Buns was professed in 1660 and was ordained in 1666.Arbogast p.111 Sometime between 1666 and 1671 Buns moved to the monastery of the Carmelites in Boxmeer. He was appointed sub-prior in the periods 1671–1674; 1677–1683; 1692–1701; and 1704-1707. During this length of time he frequently travelled to Mechelen, Antwerp and Brussels to attend Carmelite chapter-meetings. From 1679 until his death he held the position of functionary (titularus) organist in Boxmeer at the Bremser organ, built by Blasius Bremser from Mechelen. As organist, Buns succeeded Waltmans p. V Hubertus à Sancto Joanne Vlaminck (1633–1679) a well known organist in Boxmeer (from 1668–1679). The Basilica at Boxmeer was part of an independent Catholic enclave.Wout van Kuilenburg p.5See too the Blaeu Atlas Maior 1665 In 1688, Buns initiated the completion and expansion (under-Positive) of the Bremser organ in Boxmeer by Jan van Dijck.Wout van Kuilenburg p. 10-12 From 1699 onward, Buns worked as private composer, conductor and organist (\\"Aulae Bergis phonascus et organista\\") - to the Count Oswaldo van den Bergh at Boxmeer and the family van den Bergh at 's-Heerenbergh.Count Oswaldo van den Bergh (in Dutch) Buns was also an organ-expert and an organ-advisor, and In 1703 he approved the Ruprecht (III) organ which was built in the chapel of the nunnery of the Carmelites Elsendael in Boxmeer. In 1706 he advised the manufacture and implementation of the new organ in the monastery in Geldern.Arbogast p. 109 The famous organ in the Basilica of Boxmeer where Buns played. Death and legacy Buns died on 6 December 1716 in Boxmeer, and was buried in the halls of the monastery.On a plan from 1914 of the Boxmeer monastery-hall Van der Meer found the sepulchre of Buns (\\"B. P. A. S. J.\\" in the heading of the stone), see van der Meer (2) p.143. and was succeeded by Cecilius à Sancto Gerardo. In the necrology of the Carmelite monastery in Boxmeer is recorded: \\"6. December obiit P. Benedictus à Sancto Josepho alias Buns, Gelriensis, quondam subprior, organista ac Musiciae componista famosissimus.\\" In France, Buns was granted with a title of honour ”le grand Carme”.Wennekes p.7 The Dutch musicologist Frits Noske has done a remarkable job to make accessible the total oeuvre by Buns.Kreisarchiv Kleve S7Jos van Veldhoven p.7 In 1967, a first Benedictus Buns Memorial was held in Boxmeer initiated by conductor Theo Lamée and Carmelite monk Paulus Schmitt.See the Programme at classical- composers database/buns and in the newspapers de Gelderlander and Volkskrant. Programme available in the library of the monastery in Boxmeer. In 1968 a simple marble plaquette was unveiled in the hall of the monastery in Boxmeer in remembering and honouring the Carmelite Benedictus Buns. In 2001 a second Benedictus Buns Memorial in Boxmeer was initiated and executed by conductor Hans Smout in the castle and in the basilica at Boxmeer.See for the Programme 2001 classical-composers database/buns Music Much of Buns's work has survived, including motets, litanies, masses, pieces for chorus and instruments, as well as 14 instrumental sonatas. Buns published nine opus numbers (I-IX) between 1666 and 1721. Books were published by Petrus Phalesius, Antwerp, opus I–III; by Lucas de Potter, Antwerp, opus IV and V; by Arnold van Eynden, Utrecht opus VI; by Hendrik Aertssens, Antwerp, opus VII; and by Estienne Roger, Amsterdam, opus VIII-IX. The two editions of Gregorian chant and his opus I-VII and IX contains a large amount of liturgical music. His opus VIII contains only instrumental music. Of the nine opus numbers, seven have survived complete. Even after his death (1716) opus numbers were published. Those opus numbers I up to IX published during his life consist out of 123 surviving compositions, among others 109 religious vocal compositions with instruments. We know for instance of 11 Masses, 2 Requiem motets, 2 Magnificats, 5 Lauretanic Litany, Litany of the blessed Virgin, 8 Tantum Ergos, 11 Salve Reginas, 4 Regina Caelis, 1 Te Deum, some Ave Marias, 2 Missa pro defunctis, Ave Regina caelorum, 1 Alma Redemptoris Mater, 11 little Oratorios with free religious text and compositions for Beata Maria Virgine, Sancto Josepho, Sancto vel sancto, Sanctissimo Sacramento and many other religious occasions.Arbogast p. 114 Buns’s work reflects of course his activities in the service of his order. Furthermore, Buns composed 13 trio sonatas for 2 Violins, Viola da Gamba and Basso Continuo (Bass viola and organ) which were published in 1698 in his opus VIII with the title: Orpheus Elianus è Carmelo in Orbem Editus a 2 Viol. et Basso viola cum Basso Continuo. These compositions were dedicated to Count Oswald van den Bergh Boxmeer and his wife Maria Leopoldina van Oost-Friesland-Rittburg.J.H. van der Meer (1) Opus V and Opus VII by Buns were also dedicated to Count Oswald van Bergh. The tomb of Count Oswald van Bergh in the Basilica of Boxmeer. Dedication of the Opus V to Count Oswald van Bergh. The 14th instrumental sonata is sonata finalis No. 15 opus V. This Sonata finalis has two instrumental choirs with basso continuo and is representative of the modern concerto principle of the time. It is possible that Buns composed another 14th sonata, because other instrumental works have been lost also.See too J.H. van der Meer (1) His last opus IX was published in 1701. Buns also studied and practised the Gregorian chorals and chants from two volumes published in Antwerp and Brussels (Plantin Antwerp, 1711) and (Ludovicus de Quantinne Brussels, 1721). He specifically collected these two volumes of Gregorian songs for the liturgical practice in the monastery of Fratrum Beata Virginae Mariae Monte Carmelo Boxmeriensis, first the \\"Processionale juxta usum Fratrum Beatae Virginae Mariae de Monte Carmelo\\" and second \\"Manuale Chori ad usum Fratrum Beatae Virginae Mariae de Monte Carmelo\\". These two books showing theoretically and musically amendments by Buns. Much of his compositions (voice-books) no scores are available were laid-down and found in libraries of Amsterdam, Utrecht (city), Brussels, Antwerp, Geldern, Boxmeer, Paris, Zürich, Vienna, Uppsala. Style and evaluation Buns's compositions are very important for Dutch religious music.Hans Smout in Gelderlander 2001Rudolf Rasch p.2Arbogast p.116 Buns's religious compositions have to be judged against the background of the spiritual life of the Carmelites.Waltmans p. VII For Buns style is characteristic the structure from proportionally short pieces, with changing beat and speed bars. The motets on Latin texts are of a meditative nature. Further a homophone setting kind of the Primus in the upper voice, as well as larding also instrumental components in prelude and interlude plays under the designation: Symphonia, Sonata, Ritornello. However he wrote brilliant concertando masses, for instance Missa Secunda opus I for 6 vocibus, 4 vocibus in repiëno et instrumenti.This splendid Mass was performed by Hortus Musicus Religiosus/Bergen op Zoom at the Buns Memorial in March 2001 in Boxmeer Buns uses text in the motets of literal excerpts from the Holy Scriptures, partly too of paraphrases of the Scriptures and his own additions in meditative style. The new created texts by poets in the 17th century are even real inspiration for Buns’ motets. Even literal quotations from the Scriptures text are treated by Buns in an oratical way. The instrumental part is in the first phase according to conservative habit written in three or five part, only rarely four part after more modern view. The chosen instrumentation by Buns consists of violins, alto and tenor violins, viola, viola di gamba, bass viola, violoncello, bassoon, and basso continuo, usually organ with bass- violins, sometimes with trombones. But to the contrary in sonata finalis nr. 15 opus V Buns composed for two instrumental choirs with basso continuo. This composition is representative of the modern concerto principle used by Buns. The 13 sonatas of opus VIII are written in outstanding virtuoso Baroque idiom, with some southern tint.Too Emile Wennekes p. 8 This opus VIII - Orpheus Elianus e Carmelo in orbem editus - is a splendid example of truly inspired excellent Dutch music.Too Emile Wennekes p. 9 Orpheus Elianus refers to the Prophet Elijah, so he did in his opus VII, Elijah the spiritual inspiration for the founders and members of the order of Carmelites to which Buns belonged. These 13 trio sonatas opus VIII have a clear affinity with the sonata da chiesa by Corelli. They exist from short, in each other overflowing particles, often in five parts Adagio – Allegro – Adagio – Allegro – Adagio. In the same slightly one possibly the sonata finalis nr. 15 opus V for two violin choirs has to be considered as an excellent instrumental motet. Extremely surprisingly and ingenious is the alternating play between chorus I (violin 1 and 2, viola and viola di gamba) and chorus II (violin 1 and 2, viola, tenor-violin and dulciano/fagotto) having been supported by the continuo (organ, clavichord and double-bass).Ruud Huijbregts in CD Booklet p. 2 The opus VIII as a whole exhibits a logical tonal system. The first six sonatas follow the circle of fifths in the minor keys, starting from c through g, d, a, and e to b. Sonata no. 7 starts in f-sharp minor but modulates to E-flat major. The last six sonatas nr. 8 up to 13 continue through the circle of fifths, but now in the major keys, from E-flat, through B-flat, F, C, G and to D. The chosen harmonic structure is interesting and lends this opus VIII a tough architecture.See J.H. van der Meer (1) Introduction p. 1 and Emile Wennekes p. 9 Buns is strongly influenced by Italian composers from his time, for instance Bassani and Degli Antonii.Hans Schouwman in 1963 It could be Buns had some contacts with musicians of the Italian Carmelites. Unfortunately it is unknown who was Buns' music-teacher in Geldern. In the Carmelite monastery of Geldern were at that time two organs placed in the monastery-church. The Carmelites at that time had a high skill of the art of music. Perhaps a chapel-master out of Cologne? Because there exists proven contacts between the family/Count van den Bergh ‘s-Heerenbergh and chapel-masters of Cologne like Carl Rosier (1640-1725) and even the Flemish Carolus Hacquart (ca. 1640-1671).Confirmed by Dr. TJ. Wieringa according to recent research in archives in 's-Heerenbergh It is likely they worked in ‘s-Heerbergh. Buns’ music is based on the principles and style of the Venetian School at the beginning of the 17th century and Buns’ oeuvre has some similarity to Monteverdi and even comparison to Marc-Antoine Charpentier and Corelli can be adduced.Emile Wennekes p. 9 Although Buns wrote almost exclusively religious music he has considered as the most important Dutch composer in the second half of the 17th century.Rudolf Rasch (2) p.2 Character of the era in which Buns lived and worked Buns lived and worked in the time when the barony of Boxmeer was divided into numerous small territories which fell under various jurisdictions, with the exception of the Calvinistic Republic,See the Blaeu Atlas Maior 1665See Drs. Wolters-van der Werff p. VII known as “Vrije heerlijkheid” (literally \\"free manor\\") an autonomous area in the Calvinistic Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. Boxmeer had nothing to fear from the Reformation taking place at that time in the Netherlands. Boxmeer was part of the Diocese of Roermond, which by 14 August 1653 granted authorisation to the founding of the convent in Boxmeer.See Drs. Wolters- van der Werff p. 6 After the peace of Munster in 1648, Catholics in Brabant had been forced to cede their churches to the new religion, but not in the free enclave of Boxmeer, where the Catholic religion could be confessed freely. See Wout van Kuilenburg p. 5 The family of the earls Van den Bergh from 's-Heerenberg stimulated a cultural flowering in Boxmeer. Moreover, some prosperous families, such as Van Odenhoven, De Raet and Hengst, had built country-seats in Boxmeer such as Leucker, De Weijer, and Elsendock. They brought together with the earls Van den Bergh employment of administrative nature in Boxmeer.See Drs. Wolters- van der Werff p. 3 At the request of Earl Albert Van den Bergh the Flemish Carmelites requested that a Carmelite convent be established in Boxmeer. In 1652 a donation was sealed to the Flemish Carmelites and the Geldern Carmelites by Earl Albert van den Bergh which consists of two hectare grounds located beside the existing parish church at Boxmeer.See Drs. Wolters- van der Werff pp. 6-7 Buns, who composed mainly religious music, flourished in Boxmeer with the support of the Van den Bergh family.Wennekes p. 8 Buns composed dedicated music for Madeleine the Cusance, the widow of Earl Albert and for his son, Oswald Van den Bergh. In spite of Buns travelling and his patronage, his music was not broadly spread in the Netherlands, although famous music printers recognised his musical qualities and printed his music, with the exception of Buns' opus VIII - entirely existing from 13 sonatas - which was, however, the only opus published in Amsterdam. Buns did not remain in the Carmelite convent and was a much-travelled man. The Carmelites backed the Reform of Touraine in 1604 and were strongly in favour of integration of art and education in the convent. A Latin school in Boxmeer opened in 1658 answered guarantor for \\"artes liberales usque ad rhetoricam\\" (Liberal Arts and rhetoric), which formed a counterbalance against the reform colleges in the Republic.See Drs. Wolters- van der Werff p. 1 en 4 The earls Van den Bergh considered this Latin school as a scientific centre and a cultural stronghold. But also the Carmelites had to adhere to the \\"jurisdictiones, praeeminentias et immunitates\\" (jurisdiction, primacy and immunity) of the earls Van den Bergh and those stood sometimes on the side of the House of Orange.

The game was published by Rising Star Games in Australia on April 22, 2009 and Europe on April 24, 2009, by Xseed Games in North America on July 21, 2009, and by Marvelous Entertainment in Japan on September 3, 2009. The player character is a timid boy who has found a mysterious crown which gives him the power to charm people and make them follow orders. As king of the village his goal is to expand the village and make his subjects happy. The design of the game combines various simulation elements as well as real-time and adventure elements. Yasuhiro Wada told CVG that the game would be a \\"single-player life-sim set in Europe.\\" An enhanced re-imagining of the game was released on the PlayStation Vita under the title of New Little King's Story. The Microsoft Windows version of the game has been released on August 5, 2016. The game is published by the North American version of the game publisher Xseed Games. Gameplay Building In Little King's Story, players control the new king, Corobo. With his undeniable charm and control, he issues various orders to citizens. Though starting in what is essentially a cluttered field, players begin to upgrade the kingdom of Alpoko with activities such as treasure hunting and fighting. Within a few hours, players are able to purchase and institute various buildings, training facilities, and other castle commodities, while the population steadily grows. All important stats such as population and finances are tracked constantly through an easily accessible menu system. When walking around, Corobo is able to select any citizen to follow him. Afterward, the player is able to issue commands to each citizen, including actions such as digging and fighting. While the player can have a group of people follow him, he can only issue commands to one citizen at a time. Early in the game, the player has the option to buy a podium that allows the player to gather choice citizens without walking around and searching for them. Corobo's followers are initially very limited and weak in capability; however, this is quickly corrected when training facilities are built. At that point, the player can send his citizens into the buildings and change them into a different type of worker. The game offers different jobs for civilians, including but not limited to soldier, carpenter, peasant, farmer, and hunter. Each job allows citizens different capabilities and weaknesses. For example, a farmer is exceptional at field work and digging, but is a poor fighter, while soldiers are strong but lack the ability to traverse environmental obstacles. Corobo is also able to converse with his followers whenever he desires, though it usually only produces small talk. Outside of the main story, side quests are widely available via a suggestion box in the town square. Courtesy of varied civilian complaints, Corobo can accept missions that range from fetch quests to hunting and fighting that allow him to keep his public satisfied and increase finances. On some days, players are actually unable to do much due to events such as celebrations. After conquering a rival land, for example, the next day a massive parade is held in Alpoko. During this day, commanding people is a futile effort as they are too busy enjoying themselves. Saving progress can only be done in the kingdom. Adventuring Along with building and fortifying the kingdom, adventuring and questing constitutes the bulk of Little King's Story. Alpoko is only a small portion of the world, which the players must explore in order to advance the plot, collect valuable treasures and bounty, and conquer the seven rival kingdoms. It is here where having variously classed citizens comes in handy, as the player encounters various environmental obstacles, including things such as gaps in the land, caved in areas, and of course a wide slew of dangerous enemies, including boss battles. Corobo attacks with his sceptre, but his attacks are extremely weak. Instead, he must have others do all fighting for him. All civilians and Corobo possess a set amount of life; should a civilian lose all of his he will die, while if the king dies it is game over. Scattered throughout the land are little hot springs that allow the player to replenish his life; however, in order to save and collect bounty, the player must travel back to Alpoko first. Plot Corobo is a lonely boy who enjoys playing with his toys in his dark and cluttered room. One day, while chasing out a group of rats, he wanders into a mysterious land and finds a crown. Upon putting it on, he discovers that the crown allows him to give people orders with which they cannot refuse. Corobo is also appointed the ruler of a little kingdom known as Alpoko, accompanied by Howser the Bull Knight, his friends, Liam and Verde (who become Minister of Anything and Record Keeper, respectively), and a slew of obedient citizens. After building up Alpoko slightly, Corobo is issued a challenge by a foreign kingdom, which he defeats and conquers, gaining more money, territory, and a princess to keep and be with. Howser then encourages Corobo to unify the other six kingdoms under his reign. These kingdoms are ruled by kings which are: the evil Onii King (the one who issued the challenge in the first place and the leader of a group of demons called Oniis), the drunken King Duvroc (who uses his skill with liquor as a form of fighting), the obese King Shiskebaboo (who uses his obesity to fight back), the riddling Omelet King (a weakling that has his men do all the work while he cowers on his toilet), The TV-obsessed TV Dinnah, the tall Long Sauvage (who is, in reality, a pygmy), and the giant eraser man King Jumbo Champloon (the first man created by \\"God\\"). While doing this, the little king also meets Skinny Ray, a man who claims that the universe is coming to an end as evidenced by earthquakes of growing magnitude, though nobody listens to him. Eventually, Corobo unifies the whole world and gains an additional six princesses; however, as the quakes escalate to Armageddon scale, it is decided that the king must build a flying machine (which he does) and discover the cause of Armageddon. Right before, he discovers that his kingdom has gone bankrupt and that all of his princesses demand to come. Upon choosing any one of the princesses or Verde (who also loves Corobo) to be with him, the king sets forth into space only to discover that his universe is contained within a box, and that its inhabitants are actually microscopic in size. It is then revealed that many of the characters are actually fantasy versions of people the owner of the box knows (Howser being a deceased grandfather turned into a knight and many of the bosses being parodies of various influences throughout this person's life). In fact, Little King's Story appears to be a child's diary acted out in the box. After facing a nasty group of rats, who are the cause of the tremors, little Corobo discovers himself to be alone while a giant boy awakens and chases him into a corner, only for a light to reveal that the giant is actually Corobo as he was at the beginning of the story. The game ends there without telling us whether the entire story was Corobo's dream or if there are two respective Corobos (a miniature king version and a regular boy version), as well as two different worlds. Development Little King's Story began development under the title \\"Project O\\". The game was executive produced by Yasuhiro Wada, who is the creator of the Story of Seasons series. Wada contracted a developer in Fukuoka to create a new title for the Wii and asked Yoshirou Kimura to sign on as a producer. As there was no other staff at that time, Kimura contacted Norikazu Yasunaga to aid in the game's design, Youichi Kawaguchi to direct and Hideo Minaba and Kazuyuki Kurashima to design the characters and monsters respectively. Kimura had previously worked on cult titles such as Moon: Remix RPG Adventure and Chulip, and came up with the concept of Little King's Story. Kimura states that his inspiration for the game came from The Little Prince, a storybook he read as child. His goal the first year in development was to create a real-time strategy game with easy controls, specifically one that used the Wii Remote. Little King's Story, as \\"Project O\\", was first shown at the Tokyo Game Show in 2007. The official website held a \\"UMA\\" (Unidentified Mysterious Animal) contest, where people were able to send a sketch of a monster they created. The first prize winner would have their \\"UMA\\" star as an in-game character, and 99 other winners would have the artwork displayed in the game. Six of the creatures that won were \\"Bruno\\", \\"Flummex\\", \\"Octoknight\\", \\"Pirabbit\\", \\"Ninjūn\\", and \\"Kabelle\\". Rereleases On August 24, 2011, it was announced that Marvelous Entertainment was working on a reimagining to Little King's Story titled published by Konami for the PlayStation Vita. According to Famitsu, the game would have \\"love elements, along with new visual stylings for its characters.\\" In August 2016, Little King's Story was ported to PC via Steam by Marvelous, Inc. Although initially it had a mixed reception due to bugs and bad controls, after a major update, many of the complaints were fixed. Audio The game's music is composed and arranged by Yutaka Minobe. Yoko Shimomura, famous for her music in the Kingdom Hearts series, also contributed an arrangement of Boléro for the first trailer of the game, which debuted at Tokyo Game Show 2007. Sound and voice effects were handled by Vanpool. The game's main background music comes from Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Opus 125, 4th movement from 9:00 to about 10:20. Reception Little King's Story received critical acclaim by many reviewers. It received 92% from Official Nintendo Magazine, a 9/10 in UK magazine Edge and an 8/10 from Eurogamer also Little King's Story . The game also won a Satellite Award for Outstanding Puzzle/Strategy Game. As of November 13, 2009, Little King's Story had sold 26,000 units in Japan, 37,000 units in North America, and 67,000 units in Europe. Despite modest initial sales, Rising Star's Product Manager Yen Hau stated in 2010 that the title \\"is still selling well to this day, [which is] something [that] doesn't happen often to video games,\\" citing Rising Star's satisfaction with sales. Kimura explained, \\"We are planning to make a sequel to Little King's Story, like Super Little King's Story, but we're still in the idea phase.\\" However, Cing has declared bankruptcy since then; this does not mean studio closure, but rather that they will be tightening their financial belt. Regardless of Cing's closing, Marvelous Entertainment currently owns the full intellectual property rights to Little King's Story.Cing Declares Bankruptcy Both Kimura and Wada left Marvelous and joined Grasshopper Manufacture in 2010.

Jones played college football at the University of Pittsburgh where he finished seventh in the Heisman Trophy voting in 1941. Jones grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and attended the University of Pittsburgh, where he was a standout on the school's football team. After college, Jones entered the U.S. Navy during World War II. Upon his discharge in 1945, he joined the Bears for one game before he was banned by the NFL's commissioner because he had signed a contract to play for the Browns in the rival AAFC. He joined the Browns in 1946 and remained on the team through the 1949 season; Cleveland won the AAFC championship in each of Jones's four seasons. In 1950, Jones played for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League and set a league scoring record. The following year, Jones began a brief coaching career at Pitt, his alma mater, and with the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers. Later in life, he worked as a recreation superintendent in Scranton and founded the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame. Early life and high school career Jones grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he excelled in football and baseball. As a 17-year-old, he was the pitcher for his high school team in an exhibition game in Scranton against the professional St. Louis Cardinals. He was recruited by several major-league baseball teams out of high school. College career Jones attended the University of Pittsburgh and played on the school's varsity football team starting as a sophomore in 1939. He was one of the most lauded halfbacks in the country in college. In a 1939 game against Carnegie Tech, he threw a 50-yard pass to Bob Thurbon for a touchdown as time expired for the only score of the game. In 1940, however, he lost the spot as Pittsburgh's primary forward passing threat to George Kracum, a fullback. In 1941, he had a strong game against Fordham University, returning an interception for a touchdown and throwing a touchdown on offense. He finished seventh in Heisman Trophy voting that year. Professional career Jones was drafted in December 1941 by the Chicago Bears of the National Football League but delayed his professional career to join the U.S. Navy during World War II. While in the military, Jones played on service football teams. Jones was discharged in 1945 and signed a contract to play for the Bears, but a controversy erupted when it was revealed he also had a contract to play in 1946 for the Cleveland Browns of the new All-America Football Conference. After playing in just one game for the Bears, Elmer Layden, the NFL's commissioner, barred him from further participation in the league because of his AAFC contract. Layden said the NFL's policy \\"is not to permit players who have signed alleged player contracts with an unrecognized league to play football in the National Football League when it is such player's intention to play but for one year\\". Jones joined the Browns when the team started play the following year in the AAFC. With the Browns, he was known for his skill in making tough short-yardage plays. He was also a leader who was willing to stand up to coach Paul Brown. Jones was fifth in the AAFC in 1946 with 539 rushing yards, placing behind his teammate Marion Motley. He was also third in the league in yards per carry with seven. The Browns won the AAFC championship that year by beating the AAFC's New York Yankees, 14–9. In 1947, Jones missed five games due to injury but still led the AAFC in average yards per carry, with 6.4, as the Browns won the championship again. Jones remained with the Browns in 1948 as the team went undefeated and won the title for the third time in a row. He scored two touchdowns in the championship game. In a 1949 game against the Los Angeles Dons, Jones suffered a broken collarbone and missed the remainder of the regular season. The Browns again reached the championship, and Jones returned to play in the game, which Cleveland won for the fourth straight time. His shoulder continued to bother him, however, and he decided to retire after the season. Jones played most of his professional career as a second fiddle to Motley, a fullback, and Otto Graham, the Browns' star quarterback. He nevertheless was an important part of the Browns' offensive attack. Graham said that while he was not very fast, he was \\"always good in short yardage\\". Paul Brown considered him one of the finest clutch players he ever had. Despite retiring, Jones returned to football in 1950 with the Hamilton Tiger- Cats of the Canadian Football League, and was one of the circuit's top scorers. By the end of October, he had scored 102 points in 11 games, breaking a league record. Coaching career Jones in 1951 signed on to be the backfield coach at the University of Pittsburgh, his alma mater. He had wanted to begin a coaching career and heard that Pitt's old backfield coach was leaving for the University of Oregon. He applied and got the job with the help of a recommendation from Brown. He spent two years at Pitt, before joining the Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL as backfield coach, but he retired soon after. Later life and death Jones was the superintendent of Scranton's recreation bureau for two years in the mid-1960s. He later founded the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame, into which he was inducted in 1983.

The Shia Islamic Fatimid Caliphate departed to their newly conquered territories in Egypt leaving the Zirid dynasty to govern in their stead. The Zirids would eventually break all ties to the Fatimids and formally embrace Sunni Islamic doctrines. During this time there arose in Maghrib two strong local successive movements dedicated to Muslim purity in its practice. The Almoravids emerged in the far western area in al-Maghrib al-Aksa (Morocco) establishing an empire to as north as modern Spain (al-Andalus) and south to Mauretania; Almoravid rule never included Ifriqiya. Later, the Berber religious leader Ibn Tumart founded the Almohad movement, supplanted the Almoravids, and would eventually bring under the movement's control al-Maghrib and al-Andalus. Almohad rule would be succeeded by the Tunis-based Hafsids. The Hafsids were a local Berber dynasty and would retain control with varying success until the arrival of the Ottomans in the western Mediterranean.Geography and Climate information are presented in the History of Tunisia preview.For reference to authorities, see text following. Berber sovereignty Following the Fatimids, for the next half millennium Berber Ifriqiya enjoyed self-rule (1048−1574). The Fatimids were Shi'a, specifically of the more controversial Isma'ili branch. They originated in Islamic lands far to the east. Today, and for many centuries, the majority of Tunisians identify as Sunni (also from the east, but who oppose the Shi'a). In Ifriqiyah, at the time of the Fatimids, there was disdain for any rule from the east regardless if it was Sunni or Shi'a.cf., Perkins, Tunisia (1986) pp. 28-29, 34, 36-37, 39-40. Hence the rise in medieval Tunisia (Ifriqiya) of regimes not beholden to the east (al-Mashriq), which marks a new and a popular era of Berber sovereignty. The Coat of Arms of the Republic of Tunisia Initially the local agents of the Fatimids managed to inspire the allegiance of Berber elements around Ifriqiya by appealing to Berber distrust of the Islamic east, here in the form of Aghlabid rule. Thus the Fatimids were ultimately successful in acquiring local state power. Nonetheless, once installed in Ifriqiya, Fatimid rule greatly disrupted social harmony; they imposed high, unorthodox taxes, leading to a Kharijite revolt.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 83-84. Later, the Fatimids of Ifriqiya managed to accomplish their long-held, grand design for the conquest of Islamic Egypt; soon thereafter their leadership relocated to Cairo. The Fatimids left the Berber Zirids as their local vassals to govern in the Maghrib. Originally only a client of the Fatimid Shi'a Caliphate in Egypt, the Zirids eventually expelled the Shi'a Fatimids from Ifriqiya. In revenge, the Fatimids sent the disruptive Banu Hilal against Ifriqiya, which led to a period of social chaos and economic decline.For additional references to authorities re the Fatimids, see the preceding article subsection History of early Islamic Tunisia#Fatimids: Shi'a Caliphate and the text following below. The independent Zirid dynasty has been viewed historically as a Berber kingdom; the Zirids were essentially founded by a leader among the Sanhaja Berbers.Perkins, Tunisia (1986) at 39-40. Concurrently, the Sunni Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba were opposing and battling against the Shi'a Fatimids.Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (1970, 1977) at 134, 138, 141, 147. Perhaps because Tunisians have long been Sunnis themselves, they may currently evidence faint pride in the Fatimid Caliphate's rôle in Islamic history. In addition to their above grievances against the Fatimids (per the Banu Hilal), during the Fatimid era the prestige of cultural leadership within al-Maghrib shifted decisively away from Ifriqiya and instead came to be the prize of al-Andalus.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 90. During the interval of generally disagreeable Shi'a rule, the Berber people appear to have ideologically moved away from a popular antagonism against the Islamic east (al-Mashriq), and toward an acquiescence to its Sunni orthodoxy, though of course mediated by their own Maliki school of law (viewed as one of the four orthodox madhhab by the Sunni). Professor Abdallah Laroui remarks that while enjoying sovereignty the Berber Maghrib experimented with several doctrinal viewpoints during the 9th to the 13th centuries, including the Khariji, Zaydi, Shi'a, and Almohad. Eventually they settled on an orthodoxy, on Maliki Sunni doctrines. This progression indicates a grand period of Berber self-definition.Abdullah Laroui, L'Histoire du Maghreb. Un essai de synthese (Paris: François Maspero 1970), translated as The History of the Maghrib. An interpretive essay (Paris 1970; Princeton Univ. 1977) at 105-106. Tunis under the Almohads would become the permanent capital of Ifriqiya. The social discord between Berber and Arab would move toward resolution.During this period, especially under the Hafsids, \\"the process of Arabization accelerated. ...the use of Arabic spread, and Arab-Berber cultural and racial distinctions became increasingly blurred.\\" Perkins, Tunisia (Westview 1986) at 49. In fact it might be said that the history of the Ifriqiya prior to this period was prologue, which merely set the stage; henceforth, the memorable events acted on that stage would come to compose the History of Tunisia for its modern people.Professor Américo Castro makes the case, regarding several nearby Mediterranean countries to the north, i.e., Italy, France, and Spain, that their true national histories do not begin until about the year 1000 (circa 400 A.H.). A nation is based on its members having \\"the awareness of forming part of a human community that works out and is responsible for its own destiny.\\" For example, Italy is not a continuation of the Roman Empire, but a new entity.

Prof. Perkins mentions the preceding history of rule from the east (al- Mashriq), and comments that following the Fatimids departure there arose in Tunisia an intent to establish a \\"Muslim state geared to the interests of its Berber majority.\\" Thus commenced the medieval era of their sovereignty.Perkins, Tunisia (Westview 1986) at 49.Cf., Julien, History of North Africa (Paris 1931, 1961; London 1970) at 133-135.

In general long-standing tribal loyalties can compare to the composite language classifications, yet any match will not always correspond due to changing tribal alliances over time, episodic adoptations of a region's majority speech by newly arrived or minority tribal groups, and otherwise.

Zenata Nota Bene: The classification and nomenclature of Berber languages lack complete consensus.The language map above right (by Davius Sanctex of Spanish provenance) links to another which divides the Moroccan into thirds. Another map at Berber languages by Agurzil (revised by Ayadho) differs at the margins. The two classification schemata presented there, one by Maarten Kossmann (1999), and another by Ethnologue based on Aikhenvald and Militarev (1991), also differ somewhat. Another complicating factor is the dialect continua between adjacent oral cultures; at their borders, such neighboring speech regions of related idioms may blend and merge. Script, writings The Libyan Berbers developed their own writing system, evidently derived from Phoenician,Its modern name Tifinagh, more accurately in French Tifinar, derives in the Afroasiatic morphology of Semitic triliteral roots from FNR which signifies the Phoenician people. P. Salama, \\"The Sahara in Classical antiquity\\" 286-295, at 289-290, in General History of Africa, volume II, Ancient Civilizations of Africa (UNESCO 1990) Abridged Edition. Many alphabets seem to derive via the Pheonician. as early as the 4th century BC.David Diringer, Writing (London: Thames and Hudson 1962) at 124, 132, 141. A chart shows the Berber letters and sound values of ancient Libyan and modern Tifinagh. Brent and Fentress (1996) at 220. It was a boustrophic script, i.e., written left to right then right to left on alternating lines, or up and down in columns.Joseph R. Applegate, \\"The Berber Language\\" at 96-118, 115, in Hodge (ed.), Afroasiatic. A Survey (1971). Boustrophic writing was more common in the ancient world. Most of these early inscriptions were funerary and short in length. Several longer texts exist, taken from Thugga, modern Dougga, Tunisia. Both are bilingual, being written in Punic with its letters and in Berber with its letters. One throws some light on the governing institutions of the Berbers in the 2nd century BC.Over 150 words, the text dates from the era of the Berber King Masinissa. The other text begins: \\"This temple the citizens of Thugga built for King Masinissa.... \\"Steven Roger Fischer, A History of Writing (London: Reaktion 2001) at 92. The text is over 50 words and dates from the Second Punic War, 218-201. Fischer also reports a Celt-Iberian coin from Spain of the first century B.C. inscribed with Libyan letters. Ibid. at 93. Today the script descendent from the ancient Libyan remains in use; it is called Tifinagh. \\"Stop\\" sign in Nador, Morocco. Arabic qif above Berber bedd (written left to right), from the Tarifit language of the Rif (Zenati) The Tuareg of the central Sahara use Tifinagh for writing their language Tamachek. In Algeria it is also widely written by the Kabyle for their language. Until recently, its most frequent modern usage seemed to be within the family, e.g., domestic messages, personal and household ornament, magic symbolism, love letters and other notes of intimacy. Lately, public use of Tifinagh in Berber regions has been markedly increasing. Fischer, A History of Writing (2001) at 93. Brent & Fentress (1996) at 208-209, 212. Currently on the agenda in various Berber communities are considerations to expand the language's use, making its application more comprehensive. Ibid. (1996) at 281. Evidently, a variant of Tifinagh now enjoys official status in Morocco. Afroasiatic language family. Outside Ethiopia, marked here Tigre & Amharic, Semitic languages were not generally spoken elsewhere in Africa until the spread of Islam (after 632). Then Arabic supplanted some Afroasiatic languages, e.g., ancient Egyptian and Berber in many areas. Berber, however, no longer is widely spoken in present-day Tunisia; e.g., centuries ago many of its Zenata Berbers became Arabized. Today in Tunisia the small minority that speaks Berber may be heard on Jerba island, around the salt lakes region, and near the desert, as well as along the mountainous border with Algeria (across this frontier to the west lies a large region where the Zenati Berber languages and dialects predominate).Berry and Rhinehart, \\"The Society and its Environment\\" at 84-85, 86, in Tunisia. A Country Study (3rd ed., 1986).Berber speakers are indicated at the extreme south of Tunisia (near the Ghadames oasis) on the map of Agurzil (found at the top of the Berber languages page). In contrast, use of Berber is relatively common in Morocco,Barbara F. Grimes, editor, Ethnologue (Dallas 12th ed. 1990) at 305-307, indicates 5,700,000 speakers of Berber out of a total Moroccan population of 26,250,000, or about 22%. and also in Algeria,Grimes, ed., Ethnologue (12th ed. 1990) at 153-155, states that 14% speak Berber out of a total Algerian population of 25,700,000, or about 3,600,000. and in the remote central Sahara.Generally, see Joseph R. Applegate, \\"The Berber Languages\\" 96-118, at 96-97, in Afroasiatic. A Survey edited by Carleton T. Hodge (The Hague: Mouton 1971).David L. Appleyard, \\"Berber Overview\\" at 23-26, 23, in Selected Comparative-Historical Afrasian Linguistic Studies in memory of Igor M. Diakonoff, edited by M. Lionel Bender, Gabor Takacs, and David L. Appleyard (Muenchen: LINCOM 2003). Today Berber speakers said to total about 12 million. Berber poetry endures,E.g., the poet Muhammad Awzal (1670–1748). Awzal wrote Berber using a Maghribi variant of the Arabic script. as well as a traditional Berber literature.René Basset, Moorish Literature (New York: P.F.Collier & Son 1901) contains Berber ballads, tales, stories, folk-lore, and traditions.Leo Frobenius and Douglas C. Fox, African Genesis (Berkeley: Turtle Island Foundation 1983) at 45-105, contains Berber (Kabyle) legends and folk tales, originally published by Leo Frobenius in Volksmärchen und Volksdichtungen Afrikas (Jena: Eugen Diederichs Verlag 1921–1924). Berber tribal affiliations The grand tribal identities of Berber antiquity were said to be the Mauri, the Numidians, and the Gaetulians. The Mauri inhabited the far west (ancient Mauritania, now Morocco and central Algeria). The Numidians were located between the Mauri and the city-state of Carthage. Both had large sedentary populations. The Gaetulians were less settled, with large pastoral elements, and lived in the near south on the margins of the Sahara.Sallust (86-35), Bellum Iugurthinum (c.42 B.C.), 19-20, translated by S.A.Handford as The Jugurthine War (Penguin 1963) at 55-56.Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (1970, 1977) at 55, 60, 65.Brett and Fentress, The Berbers (1989) at 41-42. The medieval historian of the Maghrib, Ibn Khaldun, is credited or blamed for theorizing a causative dynamic to the different tribal confederacies over time.Cf., Steven C. Caton, \\"Anthropological Theories of Tribe and State Formation in the Middle East: Ideology and the Semiotics of Power\\" in Khoury and Kostiner, Tribes and State Formation in the Middle East (Univ.of California 1990) at 74-108, 85-90.See subsection on Ibn Khaldun, in Hafsid dynasty section of History of medieval Tunisia. Issues concerning tribal social-economies and their influence have generated a large literature, which critics say is overblown. Abdallah Laroui discounts the impact of tribes, declaring the subject a form of obfuscation which cloaks suspect colonial ideologies. While Berber tribal society has made an impact on culture and government, their continuance was chiefly due to strong foreign interference which usurped the primary domain of the government institutions, and derailed their natural political development. Rather than there being a predisposition for tribal structures, the Berber's survival strategy in the face of foreign occupation was to figuratively retreat into their own way of life through their enduring tribal networks.Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (1970, 1977) at 64-66. On the other hand, as it is accepted and understood, tribal societies in the Middle East have continued over millennia and from time to time flourish.Philip S. Khoury and Joseph Kostiner, \\"Introduction: Tribes and the Complexities of State Formation in the Middle East\\" at 1-22, in Khoury and Kostiner, Tribes and State Formation in the Middle East (Univ.of California 1990) at 1-22. Berber tribal identities survived undiminished during the long period of dominance by the city-state of Carthage. Under centuries of Roman rule also tribal ways were maintained. The sustaining social customs would include: communal self-defense and group liability, marriage alliances, collective religious practices, reciprocal gift-giving, family working relationships and wealth.Ernest Gellner, \\"Tribalism and State in the Middle East\\" in Anthropology and Politics. Revolutions in the Sacred Grove (Oxford: Blackwell 1995) at 180-201, 180-185.Generally, Marshall D. Sahlins, Tribesmen (Prentice-Hall 1968). Abdallah Laroui summarizes the abiding results under foreign rule (here, by Carthage and by Rome) as: Social (assimilated, nonassimilated, free); Geographical (city, country, desert); Economic (commerce, agriculture, nomadism); and, Linguistic (e.g., Latin, Punico-Berber, Berber).Abdallah Laroui, L'Histoire du Maghreb: Un essai de synthèse (Paris: Librairie François 1970), translated by Ralph Manheim as The History of the Maghrib (Princeton Univ. 1977) at 64. During the initial centuries of the Islamic era, it was said that the Berbers tribes were divided into two blocs, the Butr (Zanata and allies) and the Baranis (Sanhaja, Masmuda, and others).H. Mones, \\"The conquest of North Africa and Berber resistance\\" at 118-129, 118, in General History of Africa, Volume III, Africa from the Seventh to the Eleventh Century (UNESCO 1992). The etymology is unclear, perhaps deriving from tribal customs for clothing (\\"abtar\\" and \\"burnous\\"), or perhaps words coined to distinguish the nomad (Butr) from the farmer (Baranis). The Arabs drew most of their early recruits from the Butr.Singular of Baranis is Burnus, from which burnous, understood as a long garment. \\"Abtar\\" signifies cut short, hence a short tunic. Brent and Fentress, The Berbers (1996) at 131. E.F.Gautier is cited for the conjecture per farmers and nomads. Later, legends arose which spoke of an obscure, ancient invasion of North Africa by the Himyarite Arabs of Yemen, from which a prehistoric ancestry was evidently fabricated: Berber descent from two brothers, Burnus and Abtar, who were sons of Barr, the grandson of CanaanBrett and Fentress, The Berbers (1996) at 131. (Canaan being the grandson of Noah through his son Ham).Book of Genesis, at 10:1 & 6\\\\. The Hebrew Bible apparently does not list Barr as a descendant of Ham. Chapter 10 of the Book of Genesis is known as The Table of Nations. Both Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) and Ibn Hazm (994-1064) as well as Berber genealogists held that the Himyarite Arab ancestry was totally unacceptable.H.T.Norris, Saharan Myth and Saga (Oxford Univ. 1972) at 26, 30, citing René Basset (1900 & 1901). Yet Norris also notes that E.F.Gautier (1942) found an echo in the 6th century Byzantine historian Procopius of the Himyarite myth, and conjectured an ancient Canaanite Völkerwanderungen, finding common cultural symbols. Norris (1972) at 30.H.T.Norris, The Berbers in Arabic Literature (Beirut: Librairie du Liban 1982), \\"Berber Lineages\\" at 32-43. This legendary ancestry, however, played a rôle in the long Arabization process that continued for centuries among the Berber peoples.Brett and Fentress, The Berbers (1996) at 120-126, 130, 131-132; cf., 135 ff.See History of early Islamic Tunisia#Berber rôle. Topography of al-Maghib with modern state borders In their medieval Islamic history the Berbers may be divided into three major tribal groups: the Zanata, the Sanhaja, and the Masmuda. These tribal divisions are mentioned by Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406).Abun-Nasr remarks that \\"[T]hese divisions do not seem to coincide entirely either with the ethnic groupings or distinctions of dialect.\\" Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 8. The Zanata early on allied more closely with the Arabs and consequently became more Arabized, although Znatiya Berber is still spoken in small islands across Algeria and in northern Morocco (the Rif and north Middle Atlas). The Sanhaja are also widely dispersed throughout the Maghrib, among which are: the sedentary Kabyle on the coast west of modern Algiers, the nomadic Zanaga of southern Morocco (the south Anti-Atlas) and the western Sahara to Senegal, and the Tuareg (al- Tawarik), the well-known camel breeding nomads of the central Sahara. The descendants of the Masmuda are sedentary Berbers of Morocco, in the High Atlas, and from Rabat inland to Azru and Khanifra, the most populous of the modern Berber regions.For Masmuda descendent population, cf., Grimes (ed.), Ethnologue (12th ed. 1992) at 307.Generally, Jamil M. Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (Cambridge Univ. 1971) at 8-9.Brett and Fentress, The Berbers (1996) at 131-132. Medieval events in Ifriqiya and al-Maghrib often have tribal associations. Linked to the Kabyle Sanhaja were the Kutama tribes, whose support worked to establish the Fatimid Caliphate (909–1171, only until 1049 in Ifriqiya); their vassals and later successors in Ifriqiya the Zirids (973-1160) were also Sanhaja.Perkins, Tunisia (1986) at 34 (Fatamid), 36 (Zirid). The Almoravids (1056–1147) first began far south of Morocco, among the Lamtuna Sanhaja. From the Masmuda came Ibn Tumart and the Almohad movement (1130–1269), later supported by the Sanhaja. Accordingly, it was from among the Masmuda that the Hafsid dynasty (1227–1574) of Tunis originated.H. Mones, \\"The conquest of North Africa and Berber resistance\\" at 118-129, 118-120, in General History of Africa, Volume III, Africa from the Seventh to the Eleventh Century (UNESCO 1992).Brett and Fentress, The Berbers (1996) at 130-132, 134-135. Zirid Berber succession Under the Fatimids Fatimid sphere The Zirid dynasty (972-1148) began their rule as agents of the Shi'a Fatimids (909−1171), who had conquered Egypt in 969. After removing their capital to Cairo from Mahdiya in Ifriqiya, the Fatimids also withdrew from direct governance of al-Maghrib, which they delegated to a local vassal. Their Maghriban power, however, was not transferred to a loyal Kotama Berber, which tribe had provided crucial support to the Fatimids during their rise. Instead authority was given to a chief from among the Sanhaja Berber confederacy of the central Magrib, Buluggin ibn Ziri (died 984).The Kotama tribe was also a member of the parent Sanhaja confederacy. His father Ziri had been a loyal follower and soldier of the Fatimids.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (Cambridge University 1971) at 83 (Ziri in Morocco), 84.Perkins, Tunisia (1986) at 36 & 39.Julien, History of North Africa (Paris 1931, 1961; London 1970) at 64-66 (Ziri's Achir). For a time the region enjoyed great prosperity and the early Zirid court famously enjoyed luxury and the arts. Yet political affairs were turbulent. Bologguin's war against the Zenata Berbers to the west was fruitless. His son al-Mansur (r. 984-996) challenged rule by the Fatimid Shi'a Caliphate in Cairo, but without his intended effect; instead, the Kotama Berbers were inspired by the Fatimids to rebel; al-Manur did manage to subdue the Kotama. The Fatimids continued to demand tribute payments from the Zirids. After Buluggin's death, the Fatamid vassalage had eventually been split among two dynasties: for Ifriqiya the Zirid (972−1148); and for western lands [in present-day Algeria] the Hammadid (1015–1152), named for Hammad, another descendant of Buluggin. The security of civic life declined, due largely to intermittent political quarrels between the Zirids and the Hammadids, including a civil war ending in 1016. Armed attacks also came from the Sunni Umayyads of al-Andalus and from the other Berbers, e.g., the Zanatas of Morocco. Even though in this period the Maghrib often fell into conflict, becoming submerged in political confusion, the Fatimid province of Ifriqiya at first managed to continue in relative prosperity under the Zirid Berbers. Agriculture thrived (grains and olives), as did the artisans of the city (weavers, metalworkers, potters), and the Saharan trade,. The holy city of Kairouan served also as the chief political and cultural center of the Zirid state. Soon however the Saharan trade began to decline, caused by changing demand, and by the encroachments of rival traders: from Fatimid Egypt to the east, and from the rising power of the al-Murabit Berber movement in Morocco to the west. This decline in the Saharan trade caused a rapid deterioration in the commercial well being of Kairouan. To compensate, the Zirids encouraged the sea trade of their coastal cities, which did begin to quicken; however, they faced rigorous competition from Mediterranean traders of the rising city- states of Genoa and Pisa.Perkins, Tunisia (1986) at 40-41, 42. Independence In 1048, for both economic and popular reasons, the Zirids dramatically broke with the Shi'a Fatimid Caliphate, who had ruled them from Cairo. Instead the Zirids chose to become Sunni (always favored by most Maghribi Muslims) and hence declared their allegiance to the moribund Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad. Consequently, many shia were killed during disturbances throughout Ifriqiya. The Zirid state seized Fatimid wealth and coinage. Sunni Maliki jurists were reestablished as the prevailing school of law.Perkins, Tunisia at 39-40, 41. In retaliation, the Fatimid political leaders sent against the Zirids an invasion of nomadic Arabians, the Banu Hilal, who had already migrated into upper Egypt. These warrior bedouins were induced by the Fatimids to continue westward into Ifriqiya. Ominously, westward toward Zirid Ifriqiya came the entire Banu Hilal, along with them the Banu Sulaym, both Arab tribes quitting upper Egypt where they had been pasturing their animals.I. Hrbek, \\"The emergence of the Fatimids\\" in General History of Africa, volume III, at 163-175, 173-174 (Paris: UNESCO; Berkeley: Univ.of California 1992, abridged edition). Banu Hilal in genealogical scheme of the Banu 'Amir The arriving Bedouins of the Banu Hilal defeated in battle the Zirid and Hammadid Berber armies in 1057, and sack the Zirid capital Kairouan. It has since been said that much of the Maghrib's misfortunes to follow can be traced to the chaos and regression occasioned by their arrival, although historical opinion is not unanimous.Negative view of the Banu Hilal, of course, is challenged; cf., Aziz al-Azmeh, Ibn Khaldun in Modern Scholarship at 218-222. The Maghriban Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) wrote strongly disapproving of the Banu Hilal. In Arab lore the Banu Hilal's leader Abu Zayd al-Hilali is a hero; he enjoys a victory parade in Tunis where he is made lord of al- Andalus, according to the folk epic Taghribat Bani Hilal.H. T. Norris, The Berbers in Arab Literature (Beirut: Librairie du Liban 1982) at 209-226 (the chapter \\"The Hilaliyya). Encouraged by the Fatimids, these stories evidently arose in upper Egypt among the pastoral Arabs left behind, who gloried in rumors of conquest by their cousin Arabs in the far west. Norris (1982) at 218-219. The Banu Hilal came from the tribal confederacy Banu 'Amir, located mostly in southwest Arabia.Cf. Laroui, The History of the Maghrib at 147-156. In Tunisia as the Banu Hilali tribes looted the rural areas, the local sedentary populace were forced to take refuge in the main coastal cities as well as in fortified towns in northern Tunisia (Such as Tunis, Sfax, Mahdia, Bizerte...). During this time, Tunisia underwent rapid urbanisation as famines depopulated the countryside and industry shifted from agriculture to manufactures.Abulafia, \\"The Norman Kingdom of Africa\\", 29.Abulafia, \\"The Norman Kingdom of Africa\\", 27. The prosperous agriculture of central and northern Ifriqiya gave way to pastoralism for a time; consequently the economic well-being went into steep decline. Even after the fall of the Zirids, the Banu Hilal were a source of disorder, as in the 1184 insurrection of the Banu Ghaniya.Julien, History of North Africa, at 116.Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) viewed the Banu Hilal as destroying locust. Perkins, Tunisia at 41-42. These rough Arab newcomers, however, did constitute a second large wave of Arab immigration into Ifriqiya, and thus accelerated the process of Arabization. Use of the Berber languages decreased in rural areas as a result of the Bedouin ascendancy.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib at 80-86. Substantially weakened, Sanhaja Zirid rule lingered, with civil society disrupted, and the regional economy now in chaos. Normans in coastal Tunisia Normans from Sicily raided the east coast of Ifriqiya for the first time in 1123.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (Cambridge University 1971) at 84-86.Perkins, Tunisia (1986) at 36-37 & 39, and 43 (Normans from Sicily).Julien, History of North Africa (Paris 1931, 1961; London 1970) at 66-72. After some years of attacks, in 1148 Normans under George of Antioch conquered all the coastal cities of Tunisia: Bona (Annaba), Sfax, Gabès, and Tunis. Indeed, the Norman king Roger II of Sicily was able to create a coastal dominion of the area between Bona and Tripoli that lasted from 1135 to 1160 and was supported mainly by the last local Christian communities. These communities, usually Christian North African populations (Roman Africans), holding to their religion since the Roman Empire, still spoke the African Romance in a few places like Gabès and Gafsa: the most important testimony of the existence of the African Romance comes from the 12th-century Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi, who wrote that the people of Gafsa (in central- south Tunisia) used a language that he called al-latini al-afriqi (\\"the Latin of Africa\\";). Berber Islamic movements Almoravids (1056–1147) In the medieval Maghrib, among the Berber tribes, two strong religious movements arose one after the other: the Almoravids (1056–1147), and the Almohads (1130–1269). Professor Jamil Abun-Nasr compares these movements with the 8th- and-9th-century Kharijites in the Magrib including Ifriqiya: each a militant Berber movement of strong Muslim faith, each rebellious against a status quo of lax orthodoxy, each seeking to found a state in which \\"leading the Muslim good life was the professed aim of politics\\".Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 119.Today, remnants of these Maghriban Kharijis are located about the Tunisian island of Djerba. Ibadi remnants of the Rustamids now live in the Mzab region, in the pre-Sahara of Algeria. These medieval Berber movements, the Almoravids and the Almohads, have been compared to the more recent Wahhabis, strict fundamentalists of Saudi Arabia.H.A.R. Gibb, Modern Trends in Islam (Univ. of Chicago 1947) at 25-26, per excerpt in Lenczowski, editor, The Political Awakening of the Middle East (Prentice-Hall 1970) at 30. The Almoravids [Arabic al-Murabitum, from Ribat, e.g., \\"defenders\\"] began as an Islamic movement of the Sanhaja Berbers, arising in the remote deserts of the southwest Maghrib.Predominantly Berbers of the Sanhaja confederacy, then located across the far west Sahara, the early Almoravids were first led chiefly by the Lamtuna tribe. Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 92-96, 101.A Ribat [Arabic: \\"a post\\", \\"a hospice\\", \\"a fort\\", from verb rabata, \\"to bind\\"] often was a fort on the frontier of Islam. Those at such a fort were called al-murabitum, i.e., \\"those who stand together for the defense of religion\\" or \\"ones bound (to religious duty)\\". Cyril Glassé, The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam (HarperSanFrancisco 1989) at 335, and 39. After a century, this movement had run its course, losing its cohesion and strength, thereafter becoming decadent.Roger Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement in North Africa in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries (Princeton University 1969) at 11-15.Cyril Glassé, The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam (HarperSanFrancisco 1989) at 39-40. From their capital Marrakech the Almoravids had once governed a large empire stretching from Mauritania (south of Morocco) to al-Andalus (southern Spain), yet Almoravid rule had never reached east far enough to include Ifriqiya.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 94. The rival Almohads were also a Berber Islamic movement, whose founder was from the Masmuda tribe. They defeated and supplanted the Amoravids and themselves established a large empire, which embraced the region of Ifriqiya, formerly ruled by the Zirids.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 103. Almohads (al-Muwahiddin) Mahdi of the Unitarians The Almohad movement [Arabic al-Muwahhidun, \\"the Unitarians\\"] ruled variously in the Maghrib starting about 1130 until 1248 (locally in Morocco until 1275).Cyril Glassé, The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam (San Francisco: HarperCollins 1989) at 38-39.Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement (Princeton Univ. 1969) at 3, 41, 48-49, 92.\\"Almohad\\" is from the Spanish for the Arabic al-Muwahhidun. Abun- Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 105 n.1. This movement had been founded by Ibn Tumart (1077–1130), a Masmuda Berber from the Atlas mountains of Morocco, who became the mahdi. After a pilgrimage to Mecca followed by study, he had returned to the Maghrib about 1218 inspired by the teachings of al-Ash'ari and al-Ghazali.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 103, stating that although Ibn Tumart was clearly influenced by al-Ghazali, the two never personally met (citing Goldziher). A charismatic leader, he preached an interior awareness of the Unity of God.Roger Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement in North Africa in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries (Princeton Univ. 1969) at 3-11, 25-26. A puritan and a hard-edged reformer, he gathered a strict following among the Berbers in the Atlas, founded a radical community, and eventually began an armed challenge to the current rulers, the Almoravids (1056–1147).Le Tourneau reports (and criticizes) the story that the Almoravids (with Maliki legal backing) burned the book Revival of Religious Sciences by Al-Ghazali (1058–1111), which was said to have antagonized Ibn Tumart. Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement in North Africa (1969) at 6-8, 14 Almohad Empire (1147–1269) at its greatest extent Ibn Tumart the Almohad founder left writings in which his theological ideas mix with the political. Therein he claimed that the leader, the mahdi, is infallible.An idea some sunni condemn as unorthodox, i.e., as similar to the shi'a.

Ibn Tumart created a hierarchy from among his followers which persisted long after the Almohad era (i.e., in Tunisia under the Hafsids), based not only on a specie of ethnic loyalty,\\"Every member of the community had to belong to a tribe\\" under the control of their chief. Too, only Berbers of the Masmuda tribe could claim the title muwahiddin (Almohad).

Ibn Tumart trained his own talaba or ideologists, as well as his huffaz, who function was both religious and military. There is lack of certainty about some details, but general agreement that Ibn Tumart sought to reduce the \\"influence of the traditional tribal framework.\\" Later historical developments \\"were greatly facilitated by his original reorganization because it made possible collaboration among tribes\\" not likely to otherwise coalesce.Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement (1969) at 31-34.Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (1970, 1977) at 178-179. These organizing and group solidarity preparations made by Ibn Tumart were \\"most methodical and efficient\\" and a \\"conscious replica\\" of the Medina period of the prophet Muhammad.Laroui The History of the Maghrib (1970, 1977) at 179-180.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 105-106. The mahdi Ibn Tumart also had championed the idea of strict Islamic law and morals displacing unorthodox aspects of Berber custom.Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement (1969) at 20.E.g., Ibn Tumart condemned unveiled women and musical instruments. Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 104. At his early base at Tinmal, Ibn Tumart functioned as \\"the custodian of the faith, the arbiter of moral questions, and the chief judge.\\"Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 106. Yet evidently because of the narrow legalism then common among Maliki jurists and because of their influence in the rival Almoravid regime,In Al-Andalus the Maliki school had turned inward to develop only those issues already present in its own fiqh; this had led to the burning of al-Ghazali's book.

Empire of a unified Maghrib Almohad flag Following the Mahdi Ibn Tumart's death, Abd al-Mu'min al-Kumi (c. 1090 – 1163) circa 1130 became the Almohad caliph—the first non-Arab to take such title.Abd al-Mu'min was the first non-Arab to take the caliphal title amir al-mu'minin [commander of the faithful].

He immediately launched attacks on the ruling Almoravid and had wrestled Morocco away from them by 1147, suppressing subsequent revolts there. Then he crossed the straits, occupying al-Andalus (in southern Spain); yet Almohad rule there was uneven and divisive.Unfortunately, as a result of the Almohad invasion, zealots forced many of the conquered to choose between conversion or flight. The family of the Jewish philosopher and talmudist, Moshe ben Maimon, then thirteen, had to flee Córdoba in 1148, eventually finding safety in Fatimid Egypt. Isaac Husik, A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy (Macmillan 1916, reprint Philadelphia 1940) at 238.Due to Almohad severity, many Jews eventually chose to enter Christian Spain.

The only strong Muslim power then in the Maghreb was that of the newly emerging Almohads, led by their caliph a Berber Abd al-Mu'min. He responded with several military campaigns into the eastern Maghrib which absorbed the Hammaid and Zirid states, and removed the Christians.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (Cambridge Univ. 1971) at 109, 110.Cf., Haskins, The Normans in European History (New York 1915, reprint Norton Library 1966) at 192. Thus in 1152 he first attacked and occupied Bougie (in eastern Algeria), ruled by the Sanhaja Hammadids. His armies next entered Zirid Ifriqiya, a disorganized territory, taking Tunis. His armies also besieged Mahdia, held by Normans of Sicily, compelling these Christians to negotiate their withdrawal in 1160.Roger Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement in North Africa in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries (Princeton Univ. 1969) at 48-57, 92. Yet Christian merchants, e.g., from Genoa and Pisa, had already arrived to stay in Ifriqiya, so that such a foreign merchant presence (Italian and Aragonese) continued.Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (1970, 1977) at 186-187.Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (1970, 1977), at 201, 217. Italian merchants, as well as those of Aragon, came to predominate in the western Mediterranean trade of the Maghrib starting in the Almohad era. With the capture of Tunis, Mahdia, and later Tripoli, the Almohad state reached from Morocco to Libya. \\"This was the first time that the Maghrib became united under one local political authority.\\"Abun-Nasr, \\"A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 110. \\"Abd al-Mu'min briefly presided over a unified North African empire--the first and last in its history under indigenous rule\\".Perkins, Tunisia. Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) at 44. It would be the high point of Maghribi political unity. Yet twenty years later, by 1184, the revolt in the Balearic Islands by the Banu Ghaniya (who claimed to be heirs of the Almoravids) had spread to Ifriqiya and elsewhere, causing severe problems for the Almohad regime, on and off for the next fifty years.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 114-118. Religion and culture Ibn Tumart had refused to recognize the fiqh of any established school of law. In practice, however, the Maliki school of law survived and by default worked at the margin. Eventually Maliki jurists came to be recognized in some official fashion, except during the reign of Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur (1184–1199) who was loyal to Ibn Tumart's teachings. Yet the confused status continued to exist on and off, although at the end for the most part to function poorly. After of century of such oscillation, the caliph Abu al-'Ala Idris al-Ma'mun broke with the narrow ideology of the Almohad regimes (first articulated by the mahdi Ibn Tumart); circa 1230, he affirmed the reinstitution of the then- reviving Malikite rite, perennially popular in al-Maghrib.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 111, 114.Cf., Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement (1969) at 94-96.Abdallah Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (Princeton Univ. 1977) at 188-189. Ibn Rushd of Córdoba, detail from the fresco \\"School of Athens\\" by Raphael The Muslim philosophers Ibn Tufayl (Abubacer to the Latins) of Granada (died 1185), and Ibn Rushd (Averroës) of Córdoba (1126–1198), who was also appointed a Maliki judge, were dignitaries known to the Almohad court, whose capital became fixed at Marrakech. The Sufi master theologian Ibn 'Arabi was born in Murcia in 1165. Under the Almohads architecture flourished, the Giralda being built in Seville and the pointed arch being introduced.Cyril Grasse, A Concise Encyclopedia of Islam (San Francisco 1991) at 174-175, 176-177, and 38-39. \\"There is no better indication of the importance of the Almohad empire than the fascination it has exerted on all subsequent rulers in the Magrib.\\"Abdallah Laroui, L'Histoire du Maghreb (Paris: Librairie François Masero 1970), translated as The History of the Maghrib (Princeton Univ. 1977) at 201. It was an empire Berber in its inspiration, and whose imperial fortunes were under the direction of Berber leaders. The unitarian Almohads had gradually modified the original ambition of strictly implementing their founder's designs; in this way the Almohads were similar to the preceding Almoravids (also Berber). Yet their movement probably worked to deepen the religious awareness of the Muslim people across the Maghrib. Nonetheless, it could not suppress other traditions and teachings, and alternative expressions of Islam, including the popular cult of saints, the sufis, as well as the Maliki jurists, survived.Cf., Abdallah Laroui, L'Histoire du Maghreb (Paris: Librairie François Masero 1970), translated as The History of the Maghrib (Princeton Univ. 1977) at 186-192.Sufis mystical orders spread after the collapse of the Almohad regime. Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 119. The Almohad empire (like its predecessor the Almoravid) eventually weakened and dissolved. Except for the Muslim Kingdom of Granada, Spain was lost. In Morocco, the Almohads were to be followed by the Merinids; in Ifriqiya (Tunisia), by the Hafsids (who claimed to be the heirs of the unitarian Almohads).Cyril Grasse, A Concise Encyclopedia of Islam (San Francisco 1989, 1991) at 38-39. Hafsid dynasty of Tunis The Hafsid dynasty (1230–1574) succeeded Almohad rule in Ifriqiya, with the Hafsids claiming to represent the true spiritual heritage of its founder, the Mahdi Ibn Tumart (c. 1077 – 1130). For a brief moment a Hafsid sovereign would be recognized as the Caliph of Islam. Tunisia under the Hafsids would eventually regain for a time cultural primacy in the Maghrib. Political chronology Abu Hafs 'Umar IntiOr: Abu Hafs 'Umar al-Hintati. Not to be confused with Abu Hafs 'Umar, son of the first Almohad caliph 'Abd al-Mu'min (r.1132-1163), his vizier, and brother of the next caliph Abu Ya'qub Yusuf (r.1163-1184). Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement in North Africa at 67-68; cf., Julien, History of North Africa at 114-115. was one of the Ten, the crucial group composed of very early adherents to the Almohad movement [al-Muwahhidun], circa 1121. These Ten were companions of Ibn Tumart the Mahdi, and formed an inner circle consulted on all important matters. Abu Hafs 'Umar Inti, wounded in battle near Marrakesh in 1130, was for a long time a powerful figure within the Almohad movement. His son 'Umar al-Hintati was appointed by the Almohad caliph Muhammad an-Nasir as governor of Ifriqiya in 1207 and served until his death in 1221. His son, the grandson of Abu Hafs, was Abu Zakariya.Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement in North Africa (Princeton Univ. 1969) at 24, 27, 32-33, 41, 65-66; Julien, History of North Africa at 102, 108, 115, 120, 141; Laroui, History of the Maghrib at 179-180, 183-184, 188. Abu ZakariyaAbu Zakariya later was also known as Yahya I. (1203–1249) served the Almohads in Ifriqiya as governor of Gabès, then in 1226 as governor of Tunis. In 1229 during disturbances within the Almohad movement, Abu Zakariya declared his independence, having the Mahdi's name declared at Friday prayer, but himself taking the title of Amir: hence, the start of the Hafsid dynasty (1229–1574).Julien, History of North Africa (Paris: 1952; London: 1970) at 141. In the next few years he secured his hold on the cities of Ifriqiya, then captured Tripolitania (1234) to the east, and to the west Algiers (1235) and later Tlemcen (1242). He solidified his rule among the Berber confederacies. Government structure of the Hafsid state followed the Almohad model, a rather strict hierarchy and centralization. Abu Zakariya's succession to the Almohad movement was acknowledged as the only state maintaining Almohad traditions, and was recognized in Friday prayer by many states in Al-Andalus and in Morocco (including the Merinids). Diplomatic relations were opened with Frederick II of Sicily, Venice, Genoa, and Aragon. Abu Zakariya the founder of the Hafsids became the foremost ruler in the Maghrib.Abdallah Laroui, L'Histoire du Maghreb: Un essai de synthese (Paris: Librairie François Maspero 1970), translated as History of the Maghrib. An interpretive essay (Princeton Univ. 1977) at 178, 182, 195.Julien, History of North Africa at 141-142, 154. For an historic moment, the son of Abu Zakariya and self-declared caliph of the Hafsids, al-Mustansir (r.1249-1277),The honorific surname of al-Mustansir was given to Abu 'Abd Allah, son of Abu Zakariya. (In Tunisian history there was earlier another Abu 'Abd Allah, namely the Isma'ili dai who prepared the way for the Fatimid Mahdi; and there was also another Fatimid caliph known as al-Mustansir.) was recognised as Caliph by Mecca and the Islamic world (1259–1261), following termination of the Abbasid caliphate by the Mongols in 1258. Yet the moment passed as a rival claimant to the title advanced; the Hafsids remained a local sovereignty.Hodgson, The Venture of Islam 2: 291-292, 477. In 1261 Baybars had become sultan of Egypt and he revived the Abbasid Caliphate.Julien, History of North Africa at 142-143. Constantine and Tripoli) and neighboring states, circa 1400 Since their origins with Abu Zakariya the Hafsids had represented their regime as heir to the Almohad movement founded by the Mahdi Ibn Tumart, whose name was invoked during Friday prayer at emirate mosques until the 15th century. Hafsid government was accordingly constituted after the Almohad model created by the Mahdi, i.e., it being rigorous hierarchy. The Amir held all power with a code of etiquette surrounding his person, although as sovereign he did not always hold himself aloof. The Amir's counsel was the Ten, composed of the chief Almohad shaiks. Next in order was the Fifty assembled from petty shaiks, with ordinary shaiks thereafter. The early Hafsids had a censor, the mazwar, who supervised the ranking of the designated shaiks and assigned them to specified categories. Originally there were three ministers [wazir, plural wuzara]: of the army (commander and logistics); of finance (accounting and tax); and, of state (correspondence and police). Over the centuries the office of Hajib increased in importance, at first being major-domo of the palace, then intermediary between the Amir and his cabinet, and finally de facto the first minister. State authority was publicly asserted by impressive processions: high officials on horseback parading to the sound of kettledrums and tambors, with colorful silk banners held high, all in order to cultivate a regal pomp. In provinces where the Amir enjoyed recognized authority, his governors were usually close family members, assisted by an experienced official. Elsewhere provincial appointees had to contend with strong local oligarchies or leading families. Regarding the rural tribes, various strategies were employed; for those on good terms their tribal shaik might work as a double agent, serving as their representative to the central government, and also as government agent to his fellow tribal members.Julien, History of North Africa (Paris 1952; London 1970) at 154-156. Julien draws on the Masalik, a 27-volume Arabic encyclopedia of the 14th century written by al-'Umari. In 1270 King Louis IX of France, whose brother was the king of Sicily, landed an army near Tunis; disease devastated their camp.Steven Runciman, History of the Crusades (Cambridge Univ. 1954; Harper reprint 1967) at 291-292. Later, Hafsid influence was reduced by the rise of the Moroccan Marinids of Fez, who captured and lost Tunis twice (1347, and 1357).Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 229-231. Yet Hafsid fortunes would recover; two notable rulers being Abu Faris (1394–1434) and his grandson Abu 'Amr 'Uthman (r. 1435–1488).Julien, History of North Africa (1952, 1970) at 147-151. Toward the end, internal disarray within the Hafsid dynasty created vulnerabilities, while a great power struggle arose between Spaniard and Turk over control of the Mediterranean. The Hafsid dynasts became pawns, subject to the rival strategies of the combatants. By 1574 Ifriqiya had been incorporated into the Ottoman Empire.Perkins, Tunisia (1986) at 48-52. Society and culture Madhhab 'jurisdiction' in current Islamic law After an hiatus under the Almohads,Ibn Tumart is said not to have followed any recognized madhhab [see the Almohads or al-Muwahiddin era, the Rule over the Maghrib section, above]; yet the Almohads may have followed the Zahiri school of law (Hodgson, Venture of Islam at II:269), which is now extinct. the Maliki madhhab (school of law) resumed its full traditional jurisdiction over the Maghrib. During the 13th century, the Maliki school had undergone substantial liberalizing changes due in part to Iraqi influence.Maghribi students were drawn to Iraq by the teachings left by Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (died 1209). By the end of the 13th century, Ibn Zaytun Haskuni Mishaddali had introduced transformations in Maliki fiqh which were incorporated in the Hafsid restoration. Mahsin Mahdi, Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History at 30-31. Under Hafsid jurisprudents the concept of maslahah or \\"public interest\\" developed in the operation of their madhhab. This opened up Maliki fiqh to considerations of necessity and circumstance with regard to the general welfare of the community. By this means, local custom was admitted in the Sharia of Malik, to become an integral part of the legal discipline.Hodgson, Venture of Islam at II:478. Later, the Maliki theologian Muhammad ibn 'Arafa (1316–1401) of Tunis studied at the Zaituna library, said to contain 60,000 volumes.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 150. Bedouin Arabs continued to arrive into the 13th century.The new arrivals being the Banu Suaim. As to the Banu Hilal, most had by this period moved on to Morocco. Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 129, 144-145. With their tribal ability to raid and war still intact, they remained problematic and influential. The Arab language came to be predominant, except for a few Berber-speaking areas, e.g., Kharijite Djerba, and the desert south. An unfortunate divide developed between the governance of the cities and that of the countryside; at times the city-based rulers would grant rural tribes autonomy ('iqta') in exchange for their support in intra-maghribi struggles.Laroui, History of the Maghrib at 211-212 (Banu Hilal), cf. 216.Julien, History of North Africa at 145-146 (Beni Sulaim). Yet this tribal independence of the central authority meant also that when the center grew weak, the periphery might still remain strong and resilient.Cf., Perkins, Tunisia (1986) at 53. From al-Andalus Muslim and Jewish migration continued to come into Ifriqiya, especially after the fall of Granada in 1492, the last Muslim state ruling on the Iberian peninsula. These newly arriving immigrants brought infusions of their highly developed arts.Julien, History of North Africa at 151-153. The well-regarded Andalusian traditions of music and poetry are found discussed by Ahmad al-Tifashi (1184–1253) of Tunis, in his Muta'at al-Asma' fi 'ilm al-sama' [Pleasure to the Ears, on the Art of Music], in volume 41 of his encyclopedia.Benjamin M. Liu and James T. Monroe, Ten Hispano-Arabic Strophic Songs in the Modern Oral Tradition (University of California 1989) at 2 & 35; al-Tifasi's text translated at 36-69. As a result of the initial prosperity, Al-Mustansir (r.1249-1277) had transformed the capital city of Tunis, constructing a palace and the Abu Fihr park; he also created an estate near Bizerte (said by Ibn Khaldun to be without equal in the world).Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) at 141. Education was improved by the institution of a system of madrasah. Sufism, e.g., Sidi Bin 'Arus (d. 1463 Tunis) founder of the Arusiyya tariqah, became increasingly prominent, forming social links between the city and countryside.Trimingham, The Sufi Orders in Islam (Oxford Univ. 1971) at 87 The Sufi shaikhs began to assume the religious authority once held by the unitarian Almohads, according to Abun-Nasr. Poetry blossomed, as did architecture. For the moment, Tunisia had regained cultural leadership of the Maghrib.Julien, History of North Africa at 159-161. Commerce and trade Bacino del Mediterraneo, dall’Atlante manoscritto del 1582-1584 ca. Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Vittorio Emanuele II, Roma (cart. naut. 2 – cart. naut 6/1-2) Tunisia under the early Hafsids, as well as the entire Maghrib, enjoyed a general prosperity due to the rise of the Saharan-Sudanese trade. Perhaps more important was the increase in Mediterranean commerce including trade with Europeans.Cf., E. Ashtor, A Social and Economic History of the Near East in the Middle Ages (London: Collins 1976). Trade had quickened in the Mediterranean after the Fatimids in Egypt took over the trade to India from the Persian Gulf ports. In 996 there were said to be at least 160 Italian merchants in Cairo. Tunis was a major center of this east-west Mediterranean trade, which continued for four hundred years. Ibid. at 195-196. While Cairo sent west the spices of India and raw flax, Tunis chiefly sent silk, olive oil, and soap east. Ibid. at 197-198. Across the region, the repetition of buy and sell dealings with Christians led to the eventual development of trading practices and structured shipping arrangements that were crafted to ensure mutual security, customs revenue, and commercial profit. It was possible for an arriving ship to deliver its goods and pick-up the return cargo in several days time. Christian merchants of the Mediterranean, usually organized by their city-of-origin, set up and maintained their own trading facilities (a funduq) in these North African customs ports to handle the flow of merchandise and marketing.Two commercial letters originally in Arabic sent from Tunis and addressed to merchants of Pisa, dated 1201, can be found in Robert S. Lopez and Irving W. Raymond, Medieval Trade in the Mediterranean World. Illustrative documents translated with introductions and notes (Columbia Univ. 1955, 2001) at 384-388 'Solidarity of Muslim and Christian Merchants,' docs. no. 190 and no. 191. Modern reconstruction of a Caravel )Caravela Latina), which starting in the 13th century carried commercial cargoes across the Mediterranean Sea The principal maritime customs ports were then: Tunis, Sfax, Mahdia, Jerba, and Gabés (all in Tunisia); Oran, Bougie (Béjaïa), and Bône (Annaba) (in Algeria); and Tripoli (in Libya). At such ports generally, the imports were off loaded and transferred to a customs area from where they were deposited in a sealed wharehouse, or funduq, until the duties and fees were paid. The amount imposed varied, usually five or ten percent. The Tunis customs service was a stratified bureaucracy. At its head was often a member of the ruling nobility or musharif, called al-Caid, who not only managed the staff collecting duties but also might negotiate commercial agreements, conclude treaties, and act as judge in legal disputes involving foreigners.Wm. Spencer, Algeirs in the Age of the Corsairs (1976) at 8-11. Tunis exported grain, dates, olive oil, wool and leather, wax, coral, salt fish, cloth, carpets, arms, and also perhaps black slaves. Imports included cabinet work, arms, hunting birds, wine, perfumes, spices, medical plants, hemp, linen, silk, cotton, many types of cloth, glass ware, metals, hardware, and jewels.Julien, History of North Africa at 158-159. Islamic law during this era had developed a specific institution to regulate community morals, or hisba, which included the order and security of public markets, the supervision of market transactions, and related matters. The urban marketplace [Arabic souk, pl. iswak] was generally a street of shops selling the same or similar commodities (vegetables, cloth, metalware, lumber, etc.).In the villages and rural areas, there was generally a market day each week at a fixed location for trading and bartering The city official charged with these responsibilities was called the muhtasib.Knut S. Vikor, Between God and the Sultan. A History of Islamic Law (Oxford Univ. 2004) at 195-198. Vikor points out that hisba, which means \\"balance\\" in Arabic, also has the sense of achieving the common good and acting against evil, duties required of all Muslims, but especially of the Sultan. In some current Islamist movements, it can be viewed as license to vigilante action, e.g., breaking into homes to smash bottles of alcohol. Such private initiative also challenges the legitimacy of the government to keep public order.John L. Esposito, The Oxford Dictionary of Islam (Oxford Univ. 2003) at 114, 213. To achieve public order in the urban markets, the muhtasib would enforce fair commercial dealing (merchants truthfully quoting the local price to rural people, honest weights and measures, but not quality of goods nor price per se), keep roadways open, regulate the safety of building construction, and monitor the metal value of existing coinage and the minting of new coin (gold dinars and silver dirhems were minted at Tunis).Julien, A Histoyr of North Africa (1952, 1970) at 158. The authority of the muhtasib, with his group of assistants, was somewhere between a qadi (judge) and the police, or on other occasions perhaps between a public prosecutor (or trade commissioner) and the mayor (or a high city official). Often a leading judge or mufti held the position. The muhtasib did not hear contested litigation, but nonetheless could prescribe the pain and humiliation of up to 40 lashes, remand to debtor's prison, order a shop closed, or expel an offender from the city. However, the civic authority of the muhtasib did not extend into the countryside.Knut S. Vikor, Between God and the Sultan. A History of Islamic Law (Oxford Univ. 2004) at 197-198. Beginning in the 13th century, from al- Andalus came Muslim and Jewish immigrants with appreciated talents, e.g., trade connections, agricultural techniques, manufacture, and arts (see below, Society and culture). Yet unfortunately general prosperity was not steady over the centuries of Hafsid rule; there was a sharp economic decline starting in the mid-fourteenth century due to a variety of factors (e.g., agriculture, and the Sahara trade).E.g., Laroui, History of the Maghrib at 221. Under the amir Abu al-'Abbas (1370–1394), Hafsid participation in the Mediterranean trade began to decline, while early corsair raiding activity commenced.Julien, A History of North Africa (Paris 1952; London 1970) at 148. Abu al-'Abbas was the father of the celebrated amir Abu Faris (1394–1434). Ibn Khaldun Life and career Statue of Ibn Khaldoun in Tunis A major social philosopher, Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) is recognized as a pioneer in sociology, historiography, and related disciplines. Although having Yemeni ancestry, his family enjoyed centuries-long residency in al-Andalus before leaving in the 13th century for Ifriqiyah. As a native of Tunis, he spent much of his life under the Hafsids, whose regime he served on occasion. Ibn Khaldun entered into a political career early on, working under a succession of different rulers of small states, whose designs unfolded amid shifting rivalries and alliances. At one point he rose to vizier; however, he also spent a year in prison. His career required several relocations, e.g., Fez, Granada, eventually Cairo where he died. In order to write he retired for a while from active political life. Later, after his pilgrimage to Mecca, he served as Grand Qadi of the Maliki rite in Egypt (he was appointed and dismissed several times). While he was visiting Damascus, Tamerlane took the city; this cruel conquorer interviewed the elderly jurist and social philosopher, yet Ibn Khaldun managed to escape back to his life in Egypt.Muhsin Mahdi, Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History (London: George Allen & Unwin 1957; reprint Univ.

Social philosophy The history and historiography written by Ibn Khaldun was informed in theory by his learning as a faylasuf [philosopher].Muhsin Mahdi (Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History (1957) at 30-33) understands that he was influenced directly by Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (died 1209) of Iraq, and at least indirectly by al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, and Ibn Rushd. Erwin Rosenthal (Political Thought in Medieval Islam (1958) at 104-105) states that he favored and shared the views of al-Ghazali. Yet it was his participation in the small unstable governments of the region that inspired many of his key insights. His history seeks to account for the apparent cyclical progression of historical states of the Maghrib, whereby: (a) a new ruling association comes to power with strong loyalties, (b) which over the course of several generations fall apart, (c) leading to the collapse of the ruling strata. The social cohesion necessary for the group's initial rise to power, and for the group's ability to maintain it and exercise it, Ibn Khaldun called Asabiyyah.Heinrich Simon, Ibn Khalduns Wissenschaft von der Menschlichen Kultur (Leipzig 1959), translated by Fuad Baali as Ibn Khaldun's Science of Human Culture (Lahore: Ashraf 1978) at 68-88, presents a discussion of this key concept, wherein asab means \\"to bind\\", asabatun means \\"the group\\", asabah means the \\"paternal relationship\\" in the law of inheritance [at 68 and 68n1], and asabiyah means \\"the nature of the group\\" [68-69]. His seven-volume Kitab al-'Ibar [Book of Examples]Muhsin Mahdi, in his Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History at 63-71, discusses the subtleties of this title. Ibar can mean \\"instructive examples\\" [64], \\"bridge\\" or medium of explanation [66], or \\"bridge between meanings\\" [71]. (shortened title) is a telescoped \\"universal\\" history, which concentrates on the Persian, Arab, and Berber civilizations. Its lengthy prologue, called the Muqaddimah [Introduction], presents the development of long-term political trends and events as a field for the study, characterizing them as human phenomena, in quasi-sociological terms. It is widely considered to be a gem of sustained cultural analysis. Unfortunately Ibn Khaldun did not attract sufficient interest among local scholars, his studies being neglected in Ifriqiyah; however, in the Persian and Turkish worlds he acquired a sustained following.Muhsin Mahdi, Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History.

In the later books of the Kitab al-'Ibar, he focuses especially on the history of the Berbers of the Maghrib. The perceptive Ibn Khaldun in his narration eventually arrives at historical events he himself witnessed or encountered.There is said to be danger in contemporary use of his local histories, because Ibn Khaldun reluctantly employed highly nuanced \\"folk Maghribi archetypes\\" that conflate Berber and Arab tribal identities with static genres de vie (socio-economic life styles), creating \\"mythological entities\\" and a chaos of meaning. Aziz al-Azmeh, Ibn Khaldun in Modern Scholarship (London 1981) at 215-222. Compare: Laroui, The History of the Maghrib at 218-223. As an official of the Hafsids, Ibn Khaldun experienced first hand the effects on the social structure of troubled regimes and the long-term decline in the region's fortunes.

History Ramsey Windmill was originally built in Woodbridge, Suffolk. It was the north westerly one of four mills on the Mill Hills shown on the 1838 tithe map. The mill was moved to Ramsey in 1842 by Henry Collins, millwright of Woodbridge. The mill was working until the Second World War, and then left to deteriorate until 1974 when the owner, Mr Michael Organ, set about restoring the mill. Members of the Suffolk Mills Group assisted with work on Ramsey Windmill between 1974 and 1978. Description Ramsey Windmill is a post mill with a three-storey roundhouse. The mill was winded by a roof mounted fantail, similar to that seen at Icklesham today. It has four double Patent sails. There are two pairs of millstones in the breast and a third pair in the tail. Trestle and roundhouse The trestle is of oak. The main post is in length, square at its base. The mill was built with a roundhouse from the start. Having started life in Suffolk, and being moved by a Suffolk millwright, the normal practice from that county was followed, with the roundhouse having three storeys. Body The body of the mill measures by in plan. The mill is high overall. The Crowntree is square in section. The side girts are by in section. Sails and Windshaft Ramsey Mill has a cast iron windshaft and four double Patent sails. Machinery The wooden Head Wheel is of clasp arm construction, diameter, with 90 cogs of pitch. It drives two pairs of overdrift French Burr millstones via a cast iron Wallower and Spur Wheel. The cast iron Tail Wheel is diameter. It drives a single pair of underdrift diameter millstones via an Upright Shaft and Spur wheel. Fantail Ramsey Windmill was winded by a six-bladed roof mounted fantail, which blew off in 1939. The drive was down the back of the mill and thence to a ring set above the join of the quarterbars to the main post.This is a departure from the normal practice, which is to drive the wheels that carry the external ladder at the back of the mill.

Don Johnson stars as a member of a United States Cavalry detachment refusing to slaughter its horses after being ordered to do so by General Douglas MacArthur. The movie follows the plight of the officers as they attempt to save the animals that the Army no longer needs as it modernizes toward a mechanized military. The movie claims to be based on a true story but without firm evidence to support the claim.In Defense of Honor: General Douglas MacArthur and the Horse Cavalry of 1934 Plot The film during opens in 1932 when World War I veterans are protesting and rallying in Washington D.C. for war bonuses they were promised but never received from the government, a true event known as the Bonus March. In the ensuing events, the U.S. cavalry and infantry are present for crowd control. The mounted cavalry is ordered by Major John Hardesty (Bob Gunton), to present their sabers in order to hold back the protesters. First Sergeant or \\"Top\\" John Libbey (Don Johnson), along with three fellow soldiers, refuse to draw their swords because the demonstrators were men they served with during the war. As a consequence, their military careers are tarnished and they are relegated to duty at a remote post in the American Southwest. Two years later, Lieutenant Marshall Buxton (Craig Sheffer), arrives at his new post, where it is discovered during his interview with retiring Colonel Stuart (Rod Steiger) that he was so assigned because of a fight and that many of the others there are also because of insubordination. Lt. Buxton meets Sergeants Libbey, Quinlain (Neil Melville), Mulcahey (John Dennis Johnston), and Shattuck (Robert Coleby), who together manage the herd of remounts. Col. Stuart is replaced as post commander by Col. Hardesty, (on promotion). Hardesty's mission is to aid in the transition to a mechanized army. To accomplish this, the horses at the outpost will have to be destroyed. Buxton is ordered to escort the animals to slaughter. While watching the first hundred horses being helplessly shot in a mass grave, Lt. Buxton decides, with the concurrence of Libbey and the other Sergeants, to end the massacre and drive the remaining herd to safety. A manhunt ensues that forces the renegade men and horses north. Along the way, the men get a little help from retired Col. Stuart in his standing with the U.S. War Department and Colonel Stuart's daughter Jessica (Gabrielle Anwar), who is a journalist. Many of the horses are lost during the journey, due to exhaustion and injuries. The original idea for the horses is the Indian Reservation in Montana but because of Hardesty's Armored Division they are forced to go north to Canada. After reaching the Canada–US border and making a final run with the horses, the men are granted a pardon by President Franklin D. Roosevelt while being fired on by light artillery which was inaccurate because the Gunnery Sergeant's order \\"accidentally\\" ranged them to be farther than they were because he did not believe in shooting American soldiers. Buxton's men and the remaining horses are allowed safe passage across the border by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. While Lt. Buxton decides to return to the United States to face charges, Libbey wants to head toward Alaska, the others decide to stay in Canada.  Cast * Don Johnson as Sgt. John Libbey * Craig Sheffer as Lt.

Scott Murray, Australia on the Small Screen 1970–1995, Oxford Uni Press, 1996 p61 Accuracy While the film depicts the US Army eliminating its horsed cavalry units in 1934 by destroying all its horses, research conducted at the U.S. Army Center of Military History and the records at the MacArthur Memorial show no record of a slaughter of horses as alleged in the film, or any order or plan for such destruction. In reality the United States Army and various states' National Guard units retained horsed cavalry units into the 1940s. Several US Army units, including the 26th Cavalry Regiment of the Philippine Scouts, the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional) (\\"Merrill's Marauders\\"), and portions of the 3rd Infantry Division and 10th Mountain Division used horses and mules for transportation for men and equipment during the Second World War, even riding into combat in some instances. US Army occupation troops in Germany included a mounted platoon.\\"The Last Cavalry Horses\\" Olive-Drab website The US Cavalry School continued training horses and riders until 1946, when it was inactivated. When the Army's Remount Service was ended, its horses and programs were transferred to the Department of Agriculture, which sold the horses at auction the following year. Slaughter of wild horses by ranchers in the intermountain region was not uncommon in the 1960s. Many horsemen in this region wear Stetsons in the \\"Montana Peak\\" style which resembles the \\"Trooper Hat\\" of the old cavalry units. This might have contributed to the belief that the Army was slaughtering the horses. In his 1992 painting \\"Save the Wild Horses\\" for a Smithsonian fundraiser, Stockton Master Artist Jack Feldman depicted the mustangs, rounded up, their eyes glowing red, illuminated by spotlights, in a nighttime mass slaughter.

The series is set in Pine Deep, a fictional rural Pennsylvania town that becomes plagued by an evil force thought previously killed thirty years ago. In the books the town is considered to be \\"the most haunted town in America\\" and has a booming supernatural tourism industry based around the town's history and Halloween. The trilogy is composed of Ghost Road Blues, Dead Man's Song, and Bad Moon Rising. The first book in the series, Ghost Road Blues, won the Bram Stoker Award for Best First Novel in 2006 and was one of Complex magazine's \\"25 Best Horror Novels of the New Millennium\\". Pine Deep also appears in a crossover short story of Jonathan Maberry's Joe Ledger series of books, Material Witness. In Material Witness, a stand-alone short story that takes place in the early days of Joe Ledger's service in the Department of Military Sciences, a top secret division of Homeland Security. Joe Ledger and the DMS must protect a Pine Deep resident spook and author who is in over his head with the wrong people and may know more than he is letting on and in Pine Deep, nothing is what it seems. Premise Thirty years ago, Oren \\"Bone Man\\" Morse was murdered by several townspeople that believed that he was responsible for a series of brutal and gruesome murders in the town of Pine Deep. Before he was killed, Morse tried to explain that the killer was actually local townsperson Ubel Griswold. Morse had fought and killed Griswold, who had been committing the murders while in his werewolf form, but was unable to convince the townspeople of his innocence. Years later Griswold reawakens and with the help of local mechanic Vic Wingate and the psychopathic Ruger, plans to be reborn and exact unimaginable terror on the town. However just as Griswold has awoken, so has the Bone Man, the man who originally stopped Griswold's initial reign of terror on the town. The series follows Malcolm Crow, owner of a local Halloween-themed craft store and a survivor of the original massacre. As a boy of nine Crow was saved by the Bone Man who prevented Griswold from killing him. His fiancé, Val Guthrie, is also a survivor, though it was her family that suffered at Griswold’s hands. Their friend and the mayor of Pine Deep, Terry Wolfe, has been suffering a terrible psychological breakdown that has roots in a moment of childhood trauma where his sister was murdered by Griswold and he was nearly killed. Ghost Road Blues In Ghost Road Blues Crow and his friend Terry have begun having nightmares, with Terry having ones that show him either committing atrocities or watching his city burn. Meanwhile, Crow has been planning to propose to his girlfriend Val, only for her and her family to be brutally attacked by Karl Ruger. The event leaves Val's father dead, her sister-in-law mentally scarred, and both herself and Crow heavily wounded. At the same time, the local newsboy Mike Sweeney has his own problems. His step-father Vic Wingate is physically and emotionally abusing him under the influence of Ubel Griswold and another town local wants Mike dead, believing that the voice in his head is God telling him that Mike is the Antichrist. Dead Man’s Song In Dead Man’s Song, Crow and local newsman Willard Fowler Newton, begin tracking the backstory of the events of thirty years ago, while at the same time Vic Wingate and Karl Ruger quietly begin building an army of the undead to prepare for Griswold’s return. They intend to launch the Red Wave, a massive attack scheduled for Halloween Night. While Crow and Newton are down in Dark Hollow, a remote spot where Griswold both lived and died, one of Ruger’s companions, Boyd, has become a strange kind of mindless vampire. While Griswold’s ghost sets a trap for Crow, Wingate sends Boyd after Val Guthrie. The attack ends with the death of Val's brother and the near death of his wife, but Val manages to survive and kill Boyd via a headshot. During this, Crow and Newton investigate Griswold's seemingly abandoned house in Dark Hollow, only to almost die after the porch collapses in on them and a swarm of cockroaches attempts to attack them. They just barely manage to survive, making it back to Val just as she manages to kill Boyd. At the same time, Terry is spiraling deeper and deeper into depression and insanity due to the images he sees when he manages to sleep as well as the waking visions of the sister Griswold murdered. Terry begins to lose control of himself, snapping at others and acting out of character. It's only after he almost kills his wife while he was beginning to succumb to the evil inside of him that Terry throws himself out of a window in an attempt to commit suicide. Meanwhile, Mike is still being stalked by Tow Truck Eddie, having a few close calls and being saved multiple times by the intervention of the ghost of Owen Morse. Bad Moon Rising Bad Moon Rising picks up at the end of the events of the previous novel. Val is temporarily hospital-bound, Terry is in a coma, and Mike frequently falls into fugue states where he begins to change into a vampire, as it was revealed in the previous book that he is the son of Ubel Griswold while he possessed a man later revealed to be Terry. Mike continues to be stalked by Tow Truck Eddie as Val, Newton, and Crow attempt to reach out to a Pennsylvania researcher that specializes in the occult, Jonatha. Meanwhile, Vic Wingate continues to prepare for the upcoming \\"Red Wave\\" that will bring back Griswold on Halloween Night, only for Ruger to eventually end up killing his wife Lois and transforming her into a living vampire. She manages to avoid the temptation for human blood, which keeps her soul inside of her body. Lois manages to save her son Mike from being killed by Vic and allows Mike to escape, only for Ruger to force blood inside of her, causing her soul to leave her body. Crow manages to convince some of the police force that had assisted in the earlier manhunt for Ruger to help with the vampiric threat, culminating in a showdown at Griswold's house that kills one of them and almost kills Vic. During this time the Red Wave begins to take effect in the town, with all paths of escape blown up by bombs and most of the townspeople taken out by candy and beverages spiked with psychedelic drugs. Most of the town is killed and Crow, Val, Mike, and the remaining police officer return to Griswold's home to keep him from rising. They are assisted in their efforts by Terry, who has transformed into a werewolf, but not before much of their group is dead. The group does barely manage to kill Griswold as outside help comes in to take care of the remaining living citizens of the town. Reception Reception for the series was mixed to positive, with Dread Central praising the first two books. Publishers Weekly called the book horror on a grand scale... reminiscent of Stephen King’s heftier works.\\" Real world elements Author Jonathan Maberry includes a number of real world elements in his novels, and this is most apparent in the final book of the trilogy, Bad Moon Rising. Pine Deep’s Halloween Festival is the centerpiece of the story and several actual celebrities from the horror industry appear as 'guest stars' including Ken Foree (star of the original Dawn of the Dead), makeup effects wizard Tom Savini, scream queens Brinke Stevens and Debbie Rochon, screenwriter Stephen Susco (The Grudge and Grudge 2), writer-director James Gunn (remake of Dawn of the Dead and Slither), drive-in movie critic Joe Bob Briggs, and actor, stuntman and haunted attraction consultant Jim O'Rear.

The 149th is the first Air National Guard fighter squadron to fly the F-22 Raptor. History World War II  : see: 352d Fighter Group for full World War II history Activated in September 1942, the squadron trained with P-47 Thunderbolts under First Air Force in northeast United States. It deployed to the European Theater of Operations (ETO) in July 1943 as part of VIII Fighter Command and was based in England, operating as a B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber fighter escort squadron. In July 1944, the squadron converted to long- range P-51D Mustangs, while its P-47s were reassigned to IX Fighter Command for tactical fighter-bomber missions supporting Allied ground forces in France. The squadron later deployed to Belgium in December 1944 to supplement IX Fighter Command tactical air forces during the Battle of the Bulge, before returning to England from where they flew long-range escort missions until April 1945. Afterwards, the squadron demobilized in England during the summer of 1945. Its personnel returned to the United States and the squadron was subsequently inactivated as an administrative organization, in November 1945. Virginia Air National Guard The wartime 328th Fighter Squadron was re- designated as the 149th Fighter Squadron, and was allotted to the Virginia ANG, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Byrd Field, Richmond, Virginia and was extended federal recognition on 21 June 1947. The 149th Fighter Squadron was entitled to the history, honors, and colors of the 328th. The squadron was equipped with F-47D Thunderbolts and was allocated to the Fourteenth Air Force, Continental Air Command by the National Guard Bureau. The unit was called to active federal service on 1 March 1951. This activation temporarily resulted in the dissolution of the Virginia Air National Guard, as members were sent to various places, including for many, duty in the Korean War. The squadron was sent to Turner AFB, Georgia where it was assigned to the federalized 108th Fighter-Bomber Group with a mission to provide fighter escorts to Strategic Air Command B-50 Superfortress bombers on training missions. In December 1951 it was moved to Godman AFB, Kentucky where it replaced a unit deployed to England. It was released from active duty and returned to Virginia state control on 10 November 1952. Upon return to state control, the squadron was reorganized as a B-26 Invader light bombardment squadron and allocated to Tactical Air Command. In June 1957 a jurisdictional tug-of-war began between Air Defense Command and Tactical Air Command occurred for control of the squadron. The unit was redesignated the 149th Fighter Interceptor Squadron and was scheduled to get F-86E Sabre jets. However, later that year, the unit became the Tactical Air Command-gained 49th Tactical Fighter Squadron, and F-84F Thunderstreaks began replacing the obsolescent B-26s. At the height of the Cold War in 1961, the squadron was federalized as a result of tensions concerning the Berlin Wall. Part of the squadron remained at Richmond in an active-duty status for about a year before being released. Twenty-two Virginia ANG members were sent to Chaumont-Semoutiers AB, France, in December 1961 to support the USAFE 7108h Tactical Wing, a deployed unit of the 108th Tactical Fighter Wing, New Jersey ANG. They spent eight months in Europe. On 15 October 1962, the 149th was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 192d Tactical Fighter Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 149th TFS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 192d Headquarters, 192d Material Squadron (Maintenance), 192d Combat Support Squadron, and the 192d USAF Dispensary. During 1971, the squadron was assigned the F-105D Thunderchief, a battle-hardened supersonic fighter-bomber that was the backbone of America's fighter element during the Vietnam War. The group's special tasking during the next 10 years included several deployments to Red Flag live-fire exercises at Nellis AFB, Nevada and a Crested Cap NATO deployment to RAF Lakenheath, England, in 1976. In 1981, the unit transitioned to the Vought A-7D Corsair II, a subsonic jet designed primarily for close-air support. The 10-year A-7 era included several deployments, to Ecuador, Norway, and to Panama, in support of the defense of the Panama Canal. A Virginia contingent competed in Gunsmoke '85, the Air Force's tactical fighter competition, and the 149th was named the world's \\"Best A-7 Unit.\\" The squadron also earned the General Spruance Safety Award and was recognized as having had the best Operational Readiness Inspection in the Ninth Air Force during 1985. That string of accomplishments helped the squadron earn its first USAF Outstanding Unit Award, which was presented in 1987. On 20 December 1989, the United States unleashed Operation Just Cause – the emergency dispatch of U.S. forces to Panama to try to oust Panamanian Dictator Manuel Noriega, break up his army and pave the way for democratic elections. The Virginia Air Guard flew 59 Guardsmen and five A-7s to Howard AFB, near Panama City, on 20 January 1990 for its turn in the rotation. The 149th replaced the Ohio ANG's 180th Tactical Fighter Group, whose A-7 pilots had flown 76 sorties in support of Operation Just Cause. Virginia was to send a similar contingent two weeks later to replace its first group. The Virginia Guard's mission differed from previous ones. Some elements of the Panamanian Defense Forces and the Dignity Battalions were suspected to be at large in provinces, and the squadron pilots supplied air cover for field operations and air reconnaissance of areas where enemy activity was suspected. Virginia ANG 149th TFS A-7D Corsair II 70-955 149th Fighter Squadron F-16C 86-0244 in World War II 328th Fighter Squadron markings during 50th anniversary of unit, 1997 The unit soared into a new era of aviation technology in 1991, when it became the first Air National Guard unit to receive the Air Force's upgraded F-16 Fighting Falcon, the F-16C/D block 30. The 149th designation shortened somewhat during 1992 from 149th Tactical Fighter Squadron to 149th Fighter Squadron. This change reflected the adoption of the Objective Wing concept. The unit was initially assigned 24 single-seat F-16C models and two F-16D models. By early 1994, defense cutbacks had reduced the unit's assigned inventory to 18 F-16s, and eventually to only 15 fighter jets. After the 149th FS became fully operational with the F-16, it was chosen as the lead unit in a four-state Air National Guard F-16 \\"rainbow\\" detachment deployed to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, to support Operation Provide Comfort II. During that operation between 1 December 1993, and 15 January 1994, ANG pilots patrolled the no-fly zone over northern Iraq to prevent Iraqi forces from inflicting damage on the villages of Kurdish minorities. This was the first time Air National Guard units had been called to active duty to serve in a peacekeeping role in the Mideast, following Iraq's defeat in 1991. The unit returned to Incirlik AB in February 1996 for another round of patrols over Iraq. During October 1995, the parent 192d's designation was again modified to reflect unit restructuring within the Air Force and Air National Guard. This time the unit designation was changed from 192d Fighter Group to 192d Fighter Wing. The 149th was assigned to the new 192d Operations Group. In December 2000, the squadron deployed to Southwest Asia and other locations in support of Operation Southern Watch. In addition to Turkey and Kuwait, they were deployed to Prince Sultan Air Base and Eskan Village, Saudi Arabia; Aviano Air Base, Italy; and Qatar. Also in December 2000, elements of the squadron were deployed on its first Aerospace Expeditionary Force assignment. A 130-person detachment went to Curaçao in the Netherlands Antilles as part of Operation Nighthawk, an effort to stop drug smuggling into the United States. Aside from strictly operational matters, the fighter wing also focused on community support, humanitarian assistance and military heritage. In October 2005, Lt. Col. Phillip Guy became the first VANG pilot to transition to Langley AFB and fly the new F-22A Raptor in training missions and sorties alongside active duty Air Force pilots stationed there. The first two ship flight of VANG piloted F-22A's taking off from Langley AFB was successfully completed by 192nd FW pilots Lt. Col. Guy and Maj. Patrick DeConcini on 18 February 2006. Later in May, active duty personnel and Virginia guardsmen successfully completed tasking of a first ever joint-exercise requirement. The last Unit Training Assembly was held in Richmond in September 2007. Remaining base personnel solemnly attended the 'Stand-down' ceremony in the main hangar and watched as the unit flag was rolled-up by Col. Jay Pearsall and then put away. Afterwards a single F-16 took off, turned and passed over the flight deck. The pilot dipped the wings of his jet and made a final fly-by, then continued on to bring the aircraft to its new location. This marked the closing chapter for an era of excellence as the 192d FW began its future with Langley's 1st Fighter Wing. On 13 October 2007, the 192d FW was reactivated in a ceremony held at the 27th Fighter Squadron, Langley AFB. Integration with the active duty 1st FW allows the Air National Guard to be at the forefront of the latest design of fighter craft. Set-up as a classic 'associate wing' the 192nd FW works directly with the 1st FW yet maintains its own unit identity and command structure. It shares in the support of mission requirements for the F-22A Raptor, but does not own any of the aircraft on station. Lineage P-51B Mustang of 352d FG/328th FS pilot, Lt.

Its name may be related to its origin in a marsh-like area, or that its large rose comb resembles the flower of the Marsh Daisy (Armeria maritima). The Marsh Daisy is a hardy, economical barnyard chicken, but is slow to mature. It is a lightweight breed of standard fowl, with males at a maximum of 2.95 kilos (6.5 pounds) and females 2.5 kilos (5.5 pounds). A good forager, it prefers being kept free range. Though generally calm, it is active and can fly. Hens are layers of a fair number of tinted eggs. Distinguishing characteristics are the 'Rose comb', 'white earlobes' and 'willow green legs'. Known for being flighty, and slow to mature, the hardiness of the breed is the primary feature that allows them to develop, and breeders take pleasure in raising such a rare breed.Hobson, Jeremy and Lewis, Cecilia. Choosing & Raising Chickens: The complete guide to breeds and welfare. David and Charles publishing. London. 2009. p 60 There are currently no Bantam variations on the Marsh Daisy. History Beginning in the 1880s in Southport, Lancashire, Old English Game, roosters were crossed with Malay hens to create the foundation for the breed. Black Hamburgs, White Leghorns, and Sicilian Buttercups were also added to cement its characteristics. The Marsh Daisy would become a proper, defined breed in England as of 1913. The Marsh Daisy has never had any populations of consequence abroad, and has never been recognized for showing by organizations such as the American Poultry Association. Extremely rare even in its homeland, it is listed as an endangered breed by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust of the United Kingdom. It was once found in Black, Brown, Buff, Wheaten and White color varieties, the Wheaten and Brown are the most common, the Buff white and black have been reintroduced by dedicated breeders. It has no bantam version.

His last appointment was as Secretary of the Department of Defence (2012–17). Background and career Richardson was keenly interested in current affairs as a boy. He attended the University of Sydney where he received a Bachelor of Arts with Honours (1965–68). He started his Australian Public Service career in the Department of External Affairs in 1969. His history supervisor had suggested he apply to the Department rather than continuing with plans to become a teacher. Between 1969 and 1986 Richardson had various positions in the Department of Foreign Affairs, including postings to Kenya, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. In 1986 he was appointed Head of the Refugee and Humanitarian Branch in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. In 1987, Richardson moved to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, being appointed Head of the International Division in 1988. In 1990-91, Richardson was seconded to Prime Minister Bob Hawke's office where he served as Chief of Staff. In 1992, Richardson conducted a review of the Australian Intelligence Community Post Cold War. In 1993, Richardson was appointed Deputy Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. He was Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization from October 1996 to May 2005. Richardson was Australian Ambassador to the United States of America (2005–2010) and Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (2010–2012). While Australian Ambassador to the US he visited all 50 states, driving with his wife to all but Hawaii. In October 2012, Richardson was appointed Secretary of the Department of Defence. Richardson announced on 19 April 2017 that he would retire on 12 May 2017. Associate Secretary Brendan Sargeant was acting Secretary until the appointment of Greg Moriarty on 4 September 2017.Dennis Richardson AO , Department of Defence (Australia), accessed 2017-04-19Defence Department secretary Dennis Richardson announces resignation , Henry Belot, ABC News Online, 2017-04-19 Richardson was on the board of the US Studies Centre at Sydney University from 2010-2017. Following his retirement from the Public Service, he was appointed to the Board of Linfox Australia. In addition to Linfox, Richardson currently serves on the Boards of The National Capital Authority, Vault, The Australian Wildlife Conservancy, The Canberra Raiders NRL Club and is Chair of StarFlight Victoria. He is the Patron of the RSPCA in the ACT. In mid 2018, Richardson was appointed by the Australian Government to conduct a Comprehensive Review of Australian Intelligence Legislation. A classified report was given to the government in December 2019, with an unclassified report due in 2020. Honours Richardson received the Centenary Medal in 2001. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 2003 for service to the community in a range of public policy areas including foreign policy, immigration and security, and advanced to Companion of the Order of Australia in 2019 for his \\"eminent service to public administration\\" in the fields of national security, defence and foreign policy. He was also awarded the Distinguished Service Order by the President of Singapore on 8 June 2017. Richardson received an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of Sydney in November 2018 and an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the Australian National University in December 2018. Personal Richardson is married to Betty, a real estate agent, and has two children, Mark and Natalie. In 2020, he revealed his views on several public policy positions in an interview. He said he now supported calls for the establishment of a Commonwealth Integrity Commission to restore public trust, in part because ministerial staffers had been excluded from being investigated by many inquiries. He supported Australia becoming a republic because he believed that a head of state should not be foreign, and was opposed to the ban on Catholics becoming monarch. He also confirmed several anecdotes from his diplomatic career, saying he was the only person, to his knowledge, to have attended a diplomatic ceremony in a \\"waiter's uniform\\" after hiring a suit during a posting to East Africa. Another anecdote concerned his Rottweiler, Henry, downing politician Peter Costello at a diplomatic residence. Richardson agreed with characterisations of himself as being tough, an occasional micromanager, and a \\"cheeky bastard\\".

Philanthotoxins are polyamine toxins, a group of toxins isolated from the venom of wasps and spiders which immediately but reversibly paralyze their prey.. δ-philanthotoxin, also known as PhTX-433, is the most active philanthotoxin that can be refined from the venom. PhTX-433 functions by non-selectively blocking excitatory neurotransmitter ion channels, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). Synthetic analogues, including PhTX-343 and PhTX-12, have been developed to improve selectivity. While the IC50 values of philanthotoxins varies between analogues and receptor subunit composition, the IC50 value of PhTX-433 at the iGluR AMPA receptor naturally expressed in locust leg muscle is 18 μM and the IC50 value at rat nAChRs is 1 μM.  Biological context  left Nesting female Philanthus triangulum wasps utilize philanthotoxin-containing venom to paralyze prey (generally working honey bees Apis mellifera though other species may be collected) by stinging directly behind the front legs through the articular membranes. The female then carries the paralyzed prey to her nest burrow to be fed to her brood. The ability of the philanthotoxins in the venom to paralyze insect skeletal muscle through the blocking of glutamate receptor ion channels allows for this process to occur. Larval wasps rely on the paralyzed bees as a food source when they emerge. Paralyzed bee-prey may be stored for some length of time within the burrow and are regularly provisioned by the mother wasp to avoid spoiling due to fungal or bacterial infestation. In other predatory wasp species that paralyze instead of immediately killing the prey they provide their offspring, spoilage is deferred significantly by the chemical process of paralysis. Analysis of the provisioning of bee-prey by Beewolves, however, found that paralysis alone was not sufficient to prevent spoilage, and that additional preservation methods were associated with treatment by the female wasp.  Mechanism of action  Philanthotoxins reversibly inhibit AMPA (also called the \\"quisqualate receptor\\"), kainate, and NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs).. Philanthotoxins have a hydrophobic aromatic head group and a hydrophilic polyamine tail, which allow them to inhibit iGluRs by binding within the ion channel. The nitrogen atoms of the polyamine tail have been proposed to interact with the negatively-charged or polar amino acids within the cation- selective channel pore. The aromatic head group anchors the molecule to the extracellular entrance to the channel. Inhibition may also occur via binding to an external allosteric polyamine binding site. Subunit composition of iGluRs heavily influences the efficacy of philanthotoxins. For example, AMPA receptors lacking the GluA2 subunit are highly sensitive to PhTX-433, whereas receptors containing the GluA2 subunit are predominantly insensitive. Study into the exact interactions that occur between the philanthotoxin molecules and the ion channels coupled with glutamate receptors has indicated that the molecules could bind to the narrowest region of the channel, thereby blocking ion flow, and that membrane potential is important to toxin-receptor interaction, making PhTXs highly voltage-dependent antagonists of iGluRs. PhTX-433 inhibits both vertebrate and insect nAChRs predominantly by non- competitively blocking the ion channel in its open conformation. Blockage or inhibition of excitatory ion-channel coupled receptors results in paralysis of skeletal muscle in the wasp's prey. Philanthotoxin isomers generated during the identification of biological philanthotoxin structure. PhTX-433 was found to be identical to the biologically active form of the toxin isolated from the wasp's venom. Philanthotoxins have four distinct regions that can be edited to produce a huge variety of synthetic analogs with varying efficacy and subunit selectivity. 4-3-3 describes number of methylenes separating nitrogens in the tail (thermospermine) region.  Isolation and synthesis  PhTX-433 was structurally elucidated and synthesized in 1988 by Eldefrawi and colleagues. For the isolation and structural identification of PhTX-433 female wasp venom glands were fractionated using reverse-phase HPLC and fractions were tested for pharmacological activity. The most pharmacologically active sample was re- fractioned using the same method. UV spectrum and H1NMR analysis revealed that the structure consisted of a butyrl/tyrosil/polyamine sequence. Three isomers, PhTX-433, PhTX-343, and PhTX-334 (see image at upper right of this section), were determined to be possible candidate structures and all three were synthesized. PhTX-433 was found to be identical to the natural product isolated from the fractionalization in terms of H1NMR, Mass Spectometry, HPLC, and biological activity. PhTX-433 was therefore designated as the structure of the most biologically active naturally occurring philanthotoxin. Because PhTX-433 lacks strong receptor subtype selectivity, a variety of analogs have been synthesized as candidates for potential pharmacological exploitation. Philanthotoxins have four distinct regions that can be modified (see image at lower right of this section); the number of nitrogens in the polyamine chain is the most common distinction between synthetic analogs. The most commonly synthesized and studied analogue is PhTX-343, which has similar properties to PhTX-433. Notably, philanthoxin and its synthetic analogues are smaller than similar polyamine toxins form orb-web spider venoms and argiotoxins, and are easier to synthesize.  Historical context  Venoms from hymenoptera species have been used in Chinese, Korean, and ancient Greek and Egyptian traditional medical practices since 1000-3000 BCE to treat a variety of ailments, including various neurological disorders. Valued in part for their pharmacological usefulness, bees and wasps are heavily featured in the art and mythology of ancient Egypt, portrayed in hieroglyphs, amulets, and figurines.  Modern uses  Study of ionotropic glutamate (iGlu; AMPA) and nACh receptors using philanthotoxins as tools has been ongoing since the 1980s. Analogues with IC50 values in the low nano-molar and pico-molar range have been identified and studied. Combined with the potential for precise receptor subtype selectivity, synthetic philanthotoxins could be used as highly potent and selective inhibitors for nAChRs and iGluRs. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain and has been implicated in mediating neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. There is considerable interest in the therapeutic development of iGluR antagonists as anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, and agents to protect from ischemic brain damage and possibly neurodegeneration. Study of philanthotoxins has therefore been largely focused on their potent antagonistic effect on iGlu receptors in invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems, as abnormal activation of these receptors is involved with Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, neuropathic pain, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. By blocking open ionotropic receptor channels, philanthotoxins can moderate excessive opening associated with pathological neurological conditions and prevent a potentially damaging influx of calcium (Ca2+), resulting in neuroprotection. It is notable that this is a similar mechanism of action to the Alzheimer's drug Memantine, which has obtained good clinical results in the symptomatic treatment of Alzhiemer's disease. In addition, because nAChRs are the major excitatory neurotransmitter gated ion channels in insects, philanthotoxins may be developed as insecticides. The low specificity of the naturally occurring PhTX-433 has been the major obstacle in the development of PhTX-433 insecticides.

Some aspects of violin playing in his day can be seen: the lightweight, concave bow and the absence of any chin rest or shoulder rest. Versuch einer gründlichen Violinschule (A Treatise on the Fundamental Principles of Violin Playing) is a textbook for instruction in the violin, published by Leopold Mozart in 1756. The work was influential in its day, and continues to serve as a scholarly source concerning 18th century performance practice. Background and publication Leopold Mozart's primary job was as a court musician, working for the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. He began with an unpaid post in the violin sectionHalliwell (1998, 16) and gradually worked his way up the ranks in the court musical establishment, though he never was promoted to the top position of Kapellmeister. Salaries at Salzburg were low, and Leopold supplemented his income by giving violin lessons.Halliwell 1998, 20 There is indirect evidence that Leopold was a highly skilled teacher, in that both of his children, taught exclusively by him, became extraordinary musicians: Maria Anna Mozart (called \\"Nannerl\\") and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.This was a contemporary view: Hasse wrote in a letter \\"you will not be displeased to know a father who has the merit of having known how to form and give so good an education to a son.\\" (Grove dictionary, section 1) Leopold wrote his textbook during the year 1755, when he was 36 years old. He took on the work of publication himself, assigning the task of printing to Johann Jakob Lotter, a printer in Leopold's home town of Augsburg. Leopold shipped copies of his book far and wide and received his share of the profits when they were sold. His mode of business can be seen in a letter (7 January 1770) he wrote to his wife Anna Maria, who had to take over the operation while Leopold and Wolfgang were traveling in Italy: :Put together 12 copies of the Violinschule, and send them to Joseph Wolf's bookshop, in Insprugg ... You need to enclose a short letter, something like this: You receive here 12 copies of the Violinschule, which my husband, from Verona, has told me to send you. You may keep them on commission, according to the arrangement, and sell each one at 2fl[orins] 14kr[eutzer] tyrolean coinage, and reimburse my husband at 1 fl. 45 kr. in the same coinage for the ones sold; you may put this in the paper and charge the costs to my husband in this case.Halliwell 1998, 159 The Violinschule was successful in its day and went through two further German editions (1769, 1787), as well as being translated into Dutch (1766) and French (1770).Solomon 1995, 32 The work Ruth Halliwell reviews the core of the work thus: \\"At the level of practical comments on improving aspects of violin technique, Leopold showed himself to be full of common sense, and to be capable of expressing his explanations in robust and clear language ... The work, together with [Leopold's] correspondence about it [with printer Lotter], shows that Leopold knew exactly what he wanted to do, that he had strong opinions on how pupils should be taught to play the violin, that he had thought out how to present his material in the clearest possible way, that he wanted even impoverished pupils to be able to afford his book, and that he was prepared to put in all the necessary work to get the details just right.\\"Halliwell (1998, 25) Halliwell goes on to note Leopold's view that mere technical instruction would not produce fine violinists. For instance, concerning a particular aspect of bowing, Leopold insisted \\"that the performer pay attention to the Affekt (approximately, emotion) intended by the composer, so that the most appropriate bowing could be chosen. Leopold envisaged that the performer should be capable of studying a piece for clues about the intended Affekt... One element [necessary to this] was an education broad enough to encompass the study of literature and especially poetry, for a cantabile style should be the aim of every instrumentalist, and poetry was the key to good phrasing in music.\\"Halliwell (1998, 23-24 (Leopold Mozart was himself highly cultivated, with strong interests in poetry and many other areas.See Halliwell (1998, 20). The Grove Dictionary describes him as \\"a man of broad cultural achievement – a passionate reader of literature and natural science, and an admirer of Gottsched, a correspondent of Gellert's and a friend of Wieland.\\") See also *Vibrato *Pizzicato *Viola d'amore Notes References *Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, online edition, article \\"Leopold Mozart\\".

The site is located near the Baltic coast, north of the Jägala village and the former Jägala concentration camp. It is best known as the execution site of at least 6,000 Jewish and Roma Holocaust victims.  Execution site  The Kalevi-Liiva site served as the execution and burial site for trainloads of Central European Jews transported to Estonia for extermination. Other victims include Gypsies and political prisoners of mainly Estonian and Russian origin. The mass execution were carried out by Estonian Nazi collaborators under German supervision. At least two trainloads of Jews arrived at the Raasiku railway station, one from Theresienstadt on September 5, 1942, and another from Germany in mid-September. The trains carried over 2,000 people, mainly German and Czechoslovakian Jews, about 450 of whom were selected for forced labor and interned at the Jägala concentration camp, the rest were transferred by bus to Kalevi-Liiva and immediately executed. The Estonians in charge of the executions, Aleksander Laak, Ain-Ervin Mere and Ralf Gerrets, were implicated in the Holocaust trials in Soviet Estonia in 1961 and charged with murdering up to 5,000 German and Czechoslovakian Jews and Gypsies in 1942–1943.Estonian reference Estimates of the total number of victims vary. The two memorial stones on the site cite 6,000 Jews and 2,000 Roma.

In 1828, the year he was born, his father was elected to the New York State Assembly as a member of the Anti-Masonic Party. His maternal grandparents were Reverend Lemuel Powers, a Baptist minister, and Abigail Newland-Powers. His paternal grandparents were Phoebe (Millard) and Nathaniel Fillmore, a farmer. Career He studied law in his father's office and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1849. He served as his father's private secretary during the latter's presidency. After practicing law in Buffalo, New York as the partner of E. Carleton Sprague, he was appointed a federal court clerk. Personal life After the death of his mother, in 1853, his father married Caroline Carmichael McIntosh; a union which Millard Powers Fillmore reportedly never accepted. Following his father's death, he engaged in a bitter battle with his stepmother over the terms of his father's will, which young Millard won. Fillmore never married and had no children, so he was his father's last surviving descendant. He died of apoplexy in Buffalo on November 15, 1889. Fillmore was buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo. His will directed that all his family correspondence (including that with his father) be burned, the motive for which was the subject of much speculation.

It is a writer's house museum occupying the 17th-century house (informally known as Chawton Cottage) in which novelist Jane Austen spent the last eight years of her life. The museum has been a Grade I listed building since 1963. In 2020 this was among the many museums facing budgetary crisis due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Jane Austen residence Previously home to local farmers, the house was briefly a public house, The New Inn, between 1781 and 1787. The pub was the site of two murders, and after the second murder the house was let by Edward Austen Knight to a Bailiff Bridger Seward. View The former steward's cottage was a gift of Jane's brother Edward Austen Knight to allow his mother and sisters to have a permanent residence. Jane Austen lived in the house with her mother, her sister Cassandra and a longtime family friend Martha Lloyd from 7 July 1809 until May 1817, when because of illness she moved to Winchester to be near her physician. She died in Winchester on 18 July 1817, though her mother and sister continued to live in the house until their deaths in 1827 and 1845 respectively. When she arrived at Chawton, Austen had written three novels in draft form; these were Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice and Northanger Abbey. It is possible that she revised these novels at the house before getting them published.Kathryn Sutherland, Professor of English, Oxford University In addition, it was here that she wrote Mansfield Park, Emma and Persuasion.Jane Austen Society Inscription on Jane Austen's House  Museum  Following Cassandra's death, the house was divided into small apartments for labourers, before part of the building becoming a workman's club by the dawn of the twentieth century. The remainder of the house was split into cottages for estate workers, and had been known as Petty Johns and Chawton Cottage. Jane Austen's House Museum was established in 1947 and until 2014 it was governed by the Jane Austen Memorial Trust. The house was sold by Edward Knight to Thomas Edward Carpenter for £3,000 in 1948 (£ as of ). The house was given in trust in 1949 in memory of Carpenter's son, Lieutenant Philip John Carpenter, of the 1st Battalion East Surrey Regiment, 'who fell whilst leading his men at Trasimene, Italy, the 30th day of June 1944, aged 22'.War Memorials Online website The museum opened to the public in July 1949 and is visited by approximately 40,000 people each year.Chawton House LibraryChawton Heritage website It is now owned and run by the Jane Austen's House Museum CIO, a registered charity which has as its objects \\"the advancement of education and in particular the study of English literature, especially the works of Jane Austen.\\"(registered number: 1156458) The Museum's collection includes eight music books owned by Jane Austen, with pieces transcribed in her own hand. In addition, among the items of Jane Austen's furniture on display at the museum are a Muzio Clementi pianoforte (dated 1813) and a Hepplewhite bureau-bookcase containing several of her works.. The museum also has a collection of other Austen family items and furniture. The museum owns the only three pieces of jewellery known to have been owned by Austen, a turquoise beaded bracelet, a topaz cross, and a turquoise and gold ring. The gold ring had remained in Austen's family until its 2012 sale at auction to the American singer Kelly Clarkson. The British government placed an export ban on the ring owing to its historic importance, and the museum eventually bought the ring by the export deadline, with the help of £100,000 from an anonymous donor. The ring was placed on display at the museum in February 2014. Regular events are held at the museum, both to further appreciation of Jane Austen, and to encourage new writers. There are also recitals using the Clementi pianoforte and performances based on her works.

The idea was abandoned in June 2010. The rule required that—at the beginning of each match—each club must field at least six players eligible to play for the national team of the country of the club.  Definition  At the beginning of each match, each club must field at least six players eligible to play for the national team of the country of the club. There is no restriction, however, on the number of non-eligible players under contract with the club, nor on substitutes to avoid non-sportive constraints on the coaches (potentially 3+8 at the end of a match).  Explanation  The objective of this rule is to restore the national identity of football clubs who have increasingly resorted to fielding foreign players in their squad. It is also intended to reduce the increasing gap between the big and small football clubs. The rule's name is derived from the 11 players on each club that play on the pitch at the start of a match, with six players being required to be eligible for the national team and the remaining five players not subject to this restriction.  Resolution adopted by the FIFA Congress  The FIFA Congress, at its meeting in Sydney on 29 and 30 May 2008, decided to: # fully support the objectives of \\"6+5\\" as laid down at the above Congress, # request the presidents of FIFA and UEFA to continue to explore for Europe, together with the world of sport – football's protagonists, but also the International Olympic Committee and the international federations – all possible means within the limits of the law to ensure that these crucial sporting objectives be achieved, # give the FIFA President the mandate to, if necessary, take similar steps on the other continents in co-operation with the relevant confederation.  Background of 6+5  # The foundations of football are harmony and balance between national team football and club football. # The clubs' loss of national identity is endangering the former and has led to increasing inequality among the latter, thereby widening the financial and sporting gap between the two, reducing the competitiveness of club competitions and increasing the predictability of their results. # Safeguarding ## the education and training of young players, ## training clubs, and ## the values of effort and motivation in football, particularly for young players, is a fundamental element of protecting national teams and restoring sporting and financial balance to club football. # The universal development of football over the last century would not continue if there were increasing inequalities between continents, countries and protagonists in football.  Calendar of 6+5  The objective is to have an incremental implementation starting at the beginning of the 2010–11 season to give clubs time to adjust their teams over a period of several years:  Legal position in the European Union  The 6+5 rule has on numerous occasions been described as illegal by the European Union and was rejected by the European Parliament on 9 May 2008. The rule violates both Article 48 of the EC Treaty and the Bosman ruling. FIFA President Sepp Blatter met with representatives of European football leagues to explain the new rule and to garner support for it on 22 July 2008. At an informal meeting of the European sports ministers in Biarritz on 27 and 28 November 2008, FIFA was again seeking support for its proposed rule. In a final declaration, the ministers expressed their wish to \\"encourage further discussion on initiatives put forward by international federations to encourage the teams of professional clubs in each country to develop the presence of athletes capable of qualifying for national teams, in compliance with EU law, to strengthen the regional and national roots of professional sport.\\" While FIFA expressed their satisfaction about the continuation of dialogue, EU commissioners repeated their standpoint that the \\"6+5 rule is based on direct discrimination on the grounds of nationality, and is thus against one of the fundamental principles of EU law.\\" Observers concluded that the status quo has not changed. The independent Institute for European Affairs (INEA) had been commissioned by FIFA to investigate whether the rule was legal under current EU law. On 26 February 2009, the INEA released an expert opinion declaring the 6+5 rule \\"can be implemented in line with European Community law.\\" The ruling has since been scrapped as of June 2010 as the European Commission had said such a proposal would contravene EU labour laws.

These names already expressed the relationship between the two languages (Council of Tours 813). New names that related Catalan to Rome (lingua romanana, romançar or romanç) came about to dignify the Catalan language in the thirteenth century, though Latinists called it vulgar (or sermo vulgaris) and the people planus, or pla. During the Muslim presence in Iberia and the Reconquista, it was known as chrestianesch ('Christianish'), or lingua chrestianica, or christianica ('Christian language'), and contrasted with Classical languages, like Arabic and Hebrew; that are linked to Islamic and Judaic traditions. With the language expanding beyond Catalonia, names that indicated its place of origin were favoured: catalanesch (or cathalanesch), valencianesch and balearica or maioricensis. Likewise, the monarchy became associated with the language, which neutralized the political divisions of its territory. The increased range of the language had the effect of unifying the territory that it came to be spoken in, a fact that successive rulers took advantage of to neutralize political divisions, as was recorded by Ramon Muntaner. The first written reference to Catalan appears in the regles de trobar (Rules of the Trobadour's Art, ca. 1290), written in Occitan in Sicily by the Catalan troubadour and monk Jofre of Foixà: \\"si tu trobes en cantar proençals alcun mot que i sia frances o catalanesch...\\" (If you find a French or Catalan word in a troubadour song...) By the end of Middle Ages, Latin was less of a universal language, provoking Catalan to receive other names that remarked a local character and the political divisions of the time: materna lingua (or maternus sermo), maioricensis (in the Kingdom of Majorca), valencianesch (in the Kingdom of Valencia). Similarly, when Castile and Aragon were united in the fifteenth century, the range of the Catalan name was reduced to simply mean \\"from Catalonia\\" and confusion about the origin of the language led to the apparition of names such as lemosin, or llemosí (Limousin). Before the Renaixença, which revitalized Catalan-language culture, some unpopular terms such as llemosí-català, català i valencià, and bacavès (after balear-català-valencià) were created.

Along with José Vasconcelos, he founded the Ateneo de la Juventud, a humanist group against philosophical positivism. The Athenian generation opposed Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer’s philosophical views, giving credence to and expanding on the ideas of Henri Bergson, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and José Enrique Rodó. Caso opposed rationalism. His group the ateneistas believed in a moral, willing, and spiritual individual being.Biography on Caso from UNAM He was the older brother of archaeologist Alfonso Caso. Philosophical Work In the summer of 1909, Caso presented his critiques of positivism in a series of conferences later expanded in the third edition by the Athenians of Youth. He was inspired by the Christian philosophical tradition, in particular by Blaise Pascal and Tolstoy. Caso distinguishes three aspects of human existence: economic, aesthetic, and moral. Caso refuted Gabino Barreda’s thesis and the first Justo Sierra that the future of Mexico was built primarily on basis of a scientific doctrine. In the work \\"Catholicism, Jacobinism and Positivism\\" included in the book Discursos a la nacion mexicana (Discourses to the Mexican nation) Caso deepens his criticism of two of the hegemonic ideologies in the late nineteenth century: Jacobinism (or extreme liberalism) and positivism. The supporters of the first accuse them of ignoring reality, while those in the second get the blame for the alleged inevitability of reality. Antonio Caso is a pioneer in the Mexican philosophy that was developed later by Samuel Ramos, Leopoldo Zea Aguilar, and Octavio Paz among others. In his book El problema de México y la ideología nacional, (The problem of Mexico and the nation ideology) published in 1924, Caso argues Mexico’s biggest problem is the lack of unity (racial, cultural and social). Towards the end of his life, Caso was influenced by the philosophies of Husserl, Scheler, and Heidegger, especially Husserl, whose ideas were reflected in the book La filosofía de Husserl, El acto ideatorio, La persona humana y el estado totalitario y El peligro del hombre.

It is the second book in the series, following The Mysterious Benedict Society. Plot After the events of the previous book, Mr. Benedict, and the children's parents, plan to bring the children back together for another adventure using their teamwork, skills, and intelligence. When the children arrive at his house, they find out that Mr. Benedict was kidnapped by his evil twin, Mr. Curtain. In a letter, Mr. Curtain explains that he needs a certain rare plant and that a person extremely close to Mr. Benedict knows where to find it. He also says that Mr. Benedict and his assistant, Number Two, will be in danger if he doesn’t get this info. Constance, Mr. Benedict’s adopted 3-year-old genius, soon reveals that Mr. Benedict gave her a letter to open when the others came. A series of riddles lead them to take the MV Shortcut, the fastest ship in the world, bound for Lisbon. They sneak off to the ship, which is captained by Phil Noland, a friend and former navy colleague of Mr. Benedict, who has been expecting them. Noland tells them more about Mr. Benedict, including his recent communications. Noland gives them a two-way radio for communication, but Reynie mistrusts him and later disposes of it. They find new info, which leads them to a castle in Portugal. There, they find evidence that leads them to a science museum in a city in Holland called Thernbaakagen. At the museum, they learn that the rare plant is called duskwort, capable of inducing a spellbinding sleep, and might be extinct. It has the power to put an entire city to sleep and also has the power to cure narcolepsy, the disease that Mr. Benedict and his brother have. They rest at a hotel that evening but are found by Mr. Curtain’s agents called Ten Men, then rescued by Milligan, Kate’s recently found father. They then go to the island that the library said had the last remaining duskwort. On the island, they find Number Two, who tells them that Mr. Benedict is being held captive. When Milligan tries to rescue Mr. Benedict, the children are attacked by the Ten Men. Milligan comes back and saves the children by fighting the Ten Men while the children escape. Later, they find Mr. Curtain, who tricks the children into being captured also. After Mr. Curtain leaves to run an errand, Mr. Benedict tricks S.Q., their guard, and they get away. The children escape, along with Mr. Benedict, Milligan, and Number Two. As they climb down the mountain, Mr. Benedict falls asleep due to his narcolepsy and the children carry him down the mountain. They soon find Milligan, who is extremely injured from the battle with the Ten Men, and after Mr. Benedict wakes up, they run to the bay and are soon surrounded by the Ten Men. But just in time, the Shortcut and its crew come to save them. Everyone runs into the security hold of the ship and try to hide from the Ten Men, but the Ten Men find them. Just as the Ten Men plant a bomb near the hold, the Royal Navy shows up. Kate throws away the bomb and Mr. Curtain escapes, but the children make it back home to their families. Characters Reynard \\"Reynie\\" Muldoon is an eleven-year-old with no parents to speak of. He lives with his former tutor who now is his adopted mother, Miss Perumal (or as he calls her, Amma), who is teaching him Tamil, and her mother, whom he calls Pati. He acts as a leader to the rest of the Mysterious Benedict Society. He is very gifted at finding the puzzles in things, much like Constance Contraire. He is also the one who devises most of the plans, and he considers himself alone, though he realizes that he finds happiness with the people who like him. George \\"Sticky\\" Washington is also an eleven- year-old boy. He is characterized by his intelligence and ability to remember everything he reads hears or sees—hence his nickname, for everything \\"sticks\\" in his mind. He strongly prefers this nickname to his given name, George Washington. Sticky ran away from his home after feeling that he is not wanted by his parents, but is now living in his home with his parents again. He has tea-colored skin and is bald because he used hair remover to disguise himself. Sticky also has a bad habit of polishing his spectacles whenever he gets nervous. Sticky also ran away because his brain needed a rest from contests that his parents entered him in for his intelligence. His family spent a fortune finding Sticky, leaving them very poor. In this book, Sticky is becoming more comfortable with his gifts. Kate Wetherall is an energetic twelve-year-old girl who lives with her father Milligan on a farm; her mother died when she was a young child. Kate has long blonde hair and ocean-blue eyes. Kate possesses unparalleled strength, speed, agility, and endurance, among other things. She can be considered the backbone or powerhouse of the four. Her many awkward-but-useful talents (such as regurgitating things) are very prized and prove to be pivotal for the welfare of the group. Whatever happens she still is as cheerful as anyone else in the group. Even in the hardest times she is still making jokes! Constance Contraire is the fourth child of the group. She is waiting to be adopted by Mr. Benedict. Though she at first does not appear to have any special abilities, her bravery and stubbornness ultimately prove to be a great asset. Constance can detect patterns in things, and though it may seem like she is psychic, Constance merely recognized patterns and unknowingly can predict the near future. She has wispy, light blonde hair and pale blue eyes. Constance is only three years old, which explains her frequent napping and obstinacy. Mr. Benedict is a little older-than-middle-age man who recruits the children that later call themselves the Mysterious Benedict Society. He is the one who discovered the plans of his twin brother, Ledroptha Curtain. He is the founder of the Mysterious Benedict Society and is the smartest of them all. He is afflicted with narcolepsy, and in this book seeks a cure; one that may help cure this disease. Mr. Curtain is Mr. Benedict's evil twin brother, who has kidnapped Mr. Benedict and Number Two in the attempt of taking over the world. He wears silver glasses and green plaid suits, and usually makes his way around in a motorized wheelchair. Like his brother, he suffers from narcolepsy, but his condition is triggered by anger as opposed to laughter. His real name is Ledroptha. Rhonda Kazembe is Mr. Benedict's adopted daughter. She comes from Zambia. She is also, like Number Two (Shown Below), an assistant to Mr. Benedict, though she does sleep. She is quite beautiful, with very dark skin and coal-black hair. She has a very good memory, similar to Sticky's. 'Number Two' is Mr. Benedict's assistant and adopted daughter. She almost never sleeps and takes sudden food breaks to keep her energy up. She is kidnapped along with Mr. Benedict in this book. Her real name is revealed to be Pencilla in the final book of the series, The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Prisoner's Dilemma. Milligan was a spy captured by Mr. Curtain. Although his memories were erased by Mr. Curtain, he managed to escape and eventually became Mr. Benedict's bodyguard. However, near the end of the first book, when the four children are in danger and he desperately needs to save them, that triggers his memory and is revealed to be Kate's father. By the second book many of his physical abilities as a secret agent have been revealed, including being able to devise a lockpick from nail clippings, being able to bend metal bars, and being able to expertly handle his signature tranquilizer gun. As a desperate attempt to save Kate and the others, he jumped down a ravine. He survives the jump, but broke almost every bone in his body. He has blonde hair and ocean blue eyes just like Kate. The Ten Men are paid workers of Mr. Curtain who dress elegantly and carry briefcases that contains deadly weapons. They are called that way because they have ten different ways to hurt someone. Their names include McCracken, Crawlings, Sharpe, and Garotte. The weapons created by Mr. Curtain himself are to be in the possession of these men. Reception In a starred review, School Library Journal described the book as \\"not just a rip-roaring adventure ... but also a warm and satisfying tale about friendship.\\" Kirkus Reviews was less positive, saying that the book \\"may wear down less patient readers\\", citing the prose and needless elaborations in several areas. Horn Book Magazine disagreed, saying that \\"Stewart keeps interest high throughout\\". They especially praised the \\"first-rate brainteasers\\", with School Library Journal also commenting that it had \\"plenty of clever twists\\". The beginning of the novel came in for particular criticism, with Horn Book Magazine complaining of \\"a few treacly initial scenes\\" and School Library Journal saying that \\"[t]he action takes a while to get going\\".

The entry thus has Mesh-ki-ang- gasher ruling the fortress or castle around which his son would build the city of Uruk, and which was to become the main temple to its patron goddess. Unlike his successors Enmerkar, Lugalbanda, Dumuzid, the Fisherman and Gilgamesh, Mesh-ki-ang-gasher is not known from Sumerian epics or legends besides the King List. His nature as the son of the sun god, the founder of a major dynasty and his mysterious \\"disappearance\\" in the sea give him a mostly mythological flavour. His son Enmerkar is also called \\"son of Utu\\" in the Sumerian legend Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta -- where, aside from founding Uruk, Enmerkar is credited with building a temple at Eridu and with the invention of writing.

Jabalpur Development Authority was established and incorporated on 11 January 1980 with an aim of well planned and balanced development of Jabalpur city. The authority is structured under the town and country planning act 1973 of MP State Govt. and it works under the administration of Housing and Development Ministry of MP Govt. The symbol of urbanization, which is directly perceived by common people, is \\"the development of land in an organized manner\\". The common people do the investment in this activity. JDA provides a platform for people to participate in the development. JDA sells the plots in the scheme. The function of JDA is to control and regulate the development. If the private developers make plans for any institutional, residential or any other area, then they are required to be approved by JDA. If the plan does not meet the requirement of existing proposal of the master plan then it is not given the approval. In case if the matter is not solved by the JDA then it goes to the TCPO. The Government of Madhya Pradesh and Jabalpur Development Authority have been vested with the task of developing housing and other civic amenity infrastructures at par with international standards. Jabalpur Development Authority has been a major factor in transformation of city's outlook with its amazing residential projects. With an aim to convert the rustic look of the city to an urban metro, the State Government of Madhya Pradesh founded the Development Authority of Jabalpur. Along with undertaking construction of residential societies and auctioning of plots, Jabalpur Development Authority also builds community centers, shopping areas and office spaces. The city of Jabalpur is dominated by small-time businessmen and traders, along with large government offices. With the advent of industrialization in India, foreign companies are exploring hitherto untapped geographical areas to cash on cheap labor force. Jabalpur has been caught in the radar of foreign investors for making investments in sectors like - *Tourism *Mining *Textile *Auto ancillaries *Banking *Insurance and financial services *Food and food products *Power generation This rise in industrial boom in Jabalpur led the Madhya Pradesh Government to enter into public-private partnerships in the area of real estate development. This has in fact, propelled the demand for quality infrastructure both, residential and business infrastructure. Jabalpur Development Authority is involved with the construction of a number of projects in different parts of Jabalpur. Jabalpur Development Authority provides, not only residential accommodation but also other amenities of cosmopolitan city life like business facilities, cultural facilities, educational, and health care facilities, large open spaces, green areas, water bodies, sports complex, permanent exhibition complex, modern hospitals, arterial roads, and transport terminals. Further, the Jabalpur Development Authority also provides new business areas with non-polluting, non-offensive, and non-hazardous industrial infrastructure. A major portion of the dwelling units developed by it are meant for EWS, LIG, and MIG categories. The board has so far constructed many housing units belonging to EWS/LIG/MIG/HIG groups for the public on ownership bases. It has also sold developed plots to the public for making houses of their own. Over the last few years, urban, planned development in Jabalpur has gathered considerable momentum and the contribution of the Jabalpur Development Authority in this regard is worth mentioning.

He was the author of the celebrated 'Railroad Hymn,' which he sang on the occasion with fine effect.\\" History \\"The Gospel Railroad\\" (1867). The source for the melody and lyrics is unknown but developed out of a tradition which resulted in a number of similar songs about a \\"Gospel Train\\". One of the earliest known is not from the United States, but from Scotland. In 1853, Scotsman John Lyon published a song in Liverpool titled \\"Be in Time\\", the last verse of which mentions that the Gospel train is at hand.Lyon, The Harp of Zion, pp. 183-184: \\"Be in Time\\" Lyon's book was written to raise funds for the Mormon emigration of the 1840s and 50s. In 1857, an editor for Knickerbocker magazine wrote about visiting a \\"Colored Camp-Meeting\\" in New York where a song called \\"The Warning\\" was sung which featured an almost identical last verse.Editor, Nickerbocker, pp. 532-533: \\"... we accompanied a neighbor to a Colored Camp-Meeting, assembled in a shady grove on the 'Greenbush Road,' ... There were perhaps a thousand people present, men and women, young and old, at least one-half of whom were white persons. ... One colored brother ... was singing from a printed slip 'A Warning,' which all around him joined with great fervor.\\" \\"The Warning\\" used the melody from an old dance song about captain William Kidd. In 1948, the American born (British by marriage) jazz vocalist Adelaide Hall appeared in a British movie filmed in London called A World is Turning, intended to highlight the contribution of black men and women to British society at a time when they were struggling for visibility on our screens. Filming appears to have been halted due to the director's illness and only six reels of rushes remain, including scenes of Hall rehearsing songs such as \\"The Gospel Train\\"Youtube video and \\"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\\".Youtube video Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961). \\"Be in Time\\" The last verse from \\"Be in Time\\" is: \\"The Warning\\" The last verse of \\"The Warning\\" is: \\"The Gospel Railroad\\" \\"The Gospel Railroad\\" is another one of the early \\"Gospel Train\\" songs from Britain.

Duke's friend Rane, played by Peter Fonda, comes to visit his friend and ends up helping him. Rane and Pickup suggest hauling a load of illegal liquor to a lumber camp, in order to become secure enough to resist King and Harvey's pressure, and thus inspiring other independents to resist as well. Duke is shot, and Rane organizes the other truckers to confront King and Harvey. Pickup is kidnapped by Harvey. Back at King’s headquarters, Harvey knocks Pickup unconscious, shooting King when he protests. As the truckers arrive and fight King’s men, Harvey puts Pickup in his car and drives away. Rane sees Harvey and gives chase. When Harvey stops, he and Rane confront each other in a fight. Both men draw their weapons and Rane shoots Harvey, then embraces Pickup.

The IICA is generally considered the leading arbitration institution in Israel.  History  The late Prof. Smadar Ottolenghi was one of the founders of the IICA, and she served as its first President for nearly thirteen years. The current President of the IICA is the Honorable Judge (Retired) Ayala Procaccia. The prior President (through 2012) was Amnon Straschnov. In addition to providing arbitration services, the IICA also provides mediation services. The IICA’s list of arbitrators and mediators includes those from different backgrounds and disciplines: retired Israeli judges, lawyers, accountants, engineers, appraisers, and economists. From 1991 until 2007, the IICA maintained only one set of arbitration rules, in Hebrew (the General Rules). In 2007, the IIICA adopted a special set of rules, in English, for international disputes (the International Rules).Sherby, Eric (2008). \\"Israel's New International Arbitration Rules\\" NYSBA International Law Practicum21(1) (hereinafter, \\"Sherby Article\\"), 39. The chairman of the IICA Rules Committee (which drafted the General Rules) is Advocate David Golan. The principal draftsman of the IICA's International Rules was Advocate Eric Sherby.  Unique Features of General (Domestic) Rules  Throughout the world, the lack of appealability is generally considered one of the drawbacks of arbitration. One of the unique aspects of the IICA's General Rules is that it addresses the concern as to appealability. In 2004, the IICA amended the General Rules to allow the parties to an arbitration to agree on an appellate level to review the award of the arbitrator(s). The appellate procedure does not have any effect on the parties' rights under Israeli law to file a motion to confirm an arbitral award (or a motion to cancel/vacate an arbitral award) under Israeli law. The IICA is believed to be one of very few arbitral institutions globally that has adopted an institutional procedure for appealing arbitral awards.  Unique Features of International Rules  The IICA's International Rules are not like the UNCITRAL Rules. The IICA's International Rules provide that, whenever an arbitration agreement is in English, absent the parties' agreement otherwise, the language of the arbitration will be English. In such respect, the IICA is believed to be the only national arbitral institution (in a country where English is not an official language) to provide for English as the \\"default\\" language of arbitration.Sherby Article, at 39. The International Rules generally respect the parties' pre-dispute agreement to use multiple arbitrators, subject to the party's prompt notification of the desire for a multiple arbitrator adjudication. Sherby Article, at 39. The IICA's International Rules also provide that certain rulings concerning a claim of privilege that relies upon substantive law other than Israeli law may be appealed to the President of the IICA.

They were used in power supplies for electronic equipment and in high-current battery-charger applications until they were superseded by silicon diode rectifiers in the late 1960s. The arrival of the alternator in some automobiles was the result of compact, low-cost, high-current silicon rectifiers. These units were small enough to be inside the alternator case, unlike the selenium units that preceded silicon devices. The rectifying properties of selenium, amongst other semiconductors, were observed by Braun, Schuster and Siemens between 1874 and 1883.books.google.co.uk The photoelectric and rectifying properties of selenium were also observed by Adams and Day in 1876books.google.co.uk and C. E. Fitts around 1886, but practical rectifier devices were not manufactured routinely until the 1930s. Compared with the earlier copper-oxide rectifier, the selenium cell could withstand higher voltage, but at a lower current capacity per unit area.Peter Robin Morris. A history of the world semiconductor industry, IET, 1990, , pages 13, 18. Construction Typical structure of a selenium rectifier Selenium rectifiers are made from stacks of aluminum or steel plates coated with about 1 μm of bismuth or nickel. A much thicker layer of selenium (50 to 60 μm) doped with a halogen is deposited on top of the thin metal plating. The selenium is then converted into polycrystalline gray (hexagonal) form by annealing. Cadmium selenide forms by reaction of the selenium with the tin- cadmium alloy and the CdSe-Se heterojunction is the active rectifying junction. Each plate is able to withstand about 20 volts in the reverse direction. The metal squares, or disks, also serve as heat sinks in addition to providing a mounting place for the selenium disks. Plates can be stacked indefinitely to withstand higher voltages. Stacks of thousands of miniature selenium disks have been used as high-voltage rectifiers in television sets and photocopy machines. Use Selenium rectifiers used in 1950s MADDIDA computer Selenium rectifier from 1960s. Each plate is 1-inch square. Radio and television receivers used them from about 1947 to 1975 to provide up to a few hundred volts of plate voltage. Vacuum-tube rectifiers had efficiencies of only 60% compared to the 85% of selenium rectifiers, partially because vacuum- tube rectifiers required heating. Selenium rectifiers have no warm-up time, unlike high-vacuum rectifiers. Selenium rectifiers were also cheaper and simpler to specify and install than vacuum tubes. However, they were later replaced by silicon diodes with high efficiencies (close to 100% at high voltages). Selenium rectifiers had the capability to act as current limiters, which can temporarily protect the rectifier during a short circuit and provide stable current for charging batteries. Properties A selenium rectifier has about the same size as copper-oxide rectifiers, but much larger than a silicon or germanium diode. Selenium rectifiers have a long but not indefinite service life of 60,000 to 100,000 hours, depending on rating and cooling. The rectifier can show some unforming of the rectifier characteristic after long storage.Ernst Bleule (ed.), Electronic methods, Academic Press, 1964, , pages 206–207. Each cell can withstand a reverse voltage around 25 volts and has a forward voltage drop around 1 volt, which limits the efficiency at low voltages. Selenium rectifiers have an operating temperature limit of 130 °C and are not suitable for high-frequency circuits.H. P. Westman (ed), Reference Data for Radio Engineers Fifth Edition, Howard W. Sams & Co., Inc. 1968, chapter 13. Replacement Selenium rectifiers had a shorter lifespan than desired. During catastrophic failure they produced significant quantities of malodorous and highly toxic fumes that let the repair technician know what the problem was. By far the most common failure mode was a progressive increase in forward resistance, increasing forward voltage drop and reducing the rectifier's efficiency. During the 1960s they began to be superseded by silicon rectifiers, which exhibited lower forward voltage drop, lower cost, and higher reliability.Selenium, U.S. Department of the Interior. They are still manufactured for exact replacement purposes, but are not designed into new equipment. Selenium diode computer logic In 1961 IBM started developing a low-speed computer logic familyUS Patent 3218472: Transistor switch with noise rejection provided by variable capacitance feedback diode. that used selenium diodes with similar characteristics to silicon but cost less than one cent. The terminal development departments were begging for low cost and did not need speed. It was possible to punch 1/8-inch discs from a sheet of selenium diode. GE claimed that they could make reliable selenium diodes. A design was achieved for a DDTL circuit with two levels of diode logic feeding one alloy transistor and no series input resistor or speed-up capacitor. The family was called SMAL or SMALL, for \\"selenium matrix alloy logic\\". The alloy transistor proved to be too fast for the selenium diode recovery. To solve this problem, a selenium diode was connected around the base–emitter to slow it down. The two-level logic was similar to the PLAs programmable logic array that would come on the market many years later. Nearly any static logic function that yielded one output could be achieved with one transistor and a handful of cheap diodes. Several years later the selenium diodes were found not to be reliable and were replaced by silicon diodes. The logic family was packaged on SMS cards. Further reading * F.T.

Climbing career Harding was born in Nottingham but raised in the East Midlands and took his first job as an apprentice as the Rolls Royce factory in Derby. He was inspired to climb during a cycling holiday in Snowdonia in late 1943, and the following January he bought a cotton rope and began to visit the crags of the nearby Peak District with his girlfriend and climbing partner Veronica Lee. By the following summer, Harding was one of the leading climbers in the Peak District, and was beginning to make first ascents of his own, including many routes now regarded as mid-grade classics. The first of these was Promontory Traverse at Black Rocks (modern grade E1 5b) which crosses a large overhanging prow. This was followed by routes such as Goliath's Groove at Stanage Edge, the first route to be graded \\"Exceptionally Severe\\", and Suicide Wall at Cratcliffe Tor in 1946, to which he gave the same grade. While modern protection has made Suicide Wall safer than it was for Harding, it is still regarded as one of Britain's most exciting rock climbs. In 1947, Peter Harding moved to Shrewsbury where he became a lecturer in engineering at the technical college, and began to climb in North Wales. He made numerous first ascents there, the most important of which were Spectre and Ivy Sepulchre in the Llanberis Pass, which would remain among the hardest routes in the area for the next decade. Innovations and contributions to climbing Harding's most important contribution to climbing technique was to perfect and popularise the hand jam; a method of climbing cracks using the fleshy part of the thumb in conjunction with the back of the hand to grip the inner part of the crack. He is sometimes credited with inventing the technique, though it is more likely that he rediscovered a method which had been used occasionally since the late 19th century. However, he did much to promote the use of hand jams at a time when most climbers preferred to climb fist-width cracks by tiring laybacking, or by forcing their hands against opposite sides of the crack, as if opening sliding doors. Using the hand jam, Harding claimed, it was possible to hang comfortably from one hand, while smoking a cigarette with the other – and he would regularly demonstrate this. Another of Harding's innovations was the introduction of aid climbing tactics from Europe, which had previously been regarded as unsporting by British climbers. His most important route in this respect was Kaisergebirge Wall in the Llanberis Pass which he climbed in 1948 and which presaged the increased acceptance of the use of pitons in the 1950s. In his professional life, Harding took an interest in climbing equipment, and a large amount of data was generated from his experiments on karabiners, ropes and pitons in his workshop. Later life Modern climbers on Valkyrie at The Roaches; a route first climbed by Peter Harding Harding's time at the peak of British climbing was relatively short. He climbed his last major new route in 1949 with Demon Rib at Black Rocks; possibly his most difficult route of all, which is now graded E3. However, by 1950 his family and career had begun to take priority over climbing and a new generation of climbers, led by Joe Brown and Don Whillans, took his place at the fore of the sport. Harding left teaching in 1951 to work on brake linings at Small & Parkes, and later Mintex, where he eventually became Research and Development Manager, and produced many technical papers on the braking of road vehicles. This job allowed him to indulge his interest in motor racing, and he became a regular rally driver. He continued to climb into his seventies, and in 1994 surprised many younger climbers by making a solo ascent of the difficult Younggrat route on the Breithorn.

The grounds are open to the public most of the year round and the drawing room or \\"Treaty Room\\" in the house itself on selected dates only. It is described by the National Trust as a \\"late 18th- century thatched house in gentrified vernacular style\\". Features Built in the style of a \\"cottage orné\\", the single storey house is set in a partly- walled demesne in of beautiful parkland and woodland. It features unique local thatching using Shannon reeds. The surrounding parkland was laid out by John Sutherland (1745–1826), one of the most celebrated disciples of Capability Brown. The park includes woodland belts, a largely unused walled kitchen garden, a small quarry, and a short walking trail. There are four gate lodges within the grounds, including the head gardener's house, known as Hortus Lodge. These were added in the 19th century, one before 1834, two before 1861 and one before 1906. History Isaac Corry, MP The house was built between 1776 and 1787 by Isaac Corry, MP for Newry for thirty years, on land he inherited from his father. The house was described by Sir Charles Coote as \\"without exception, the most elegant summer lodge...\\"Brett, Sir Charles, Buildings of County Armagh, UAHS, 1999, p. 154 Corry was the last chancellor of the exchequer of Ireland before the Act of Union of 1800, in which he played a significant role. It has been suggested that the Act of Union may have been drafted in the drawing room (also known as the Treaty Room) of the house in 1800 although there is little evidence to support this. It is possible that the Act may have been discussed here though the actual signing took place at the House of Parliament (now the Bank of Ireland) at College Green in Dublin. Later years Derrymore was sold by Corry in 1810, when he moved to Dublin, and was later acquired by the Young family. Sir William Young, Bart. sold the Derrymore estate in 1825 to the Smyth family. The demesne, which hosted 140,000 trees, was then bought by a wealthy Merchant Robert Glenny of Trevor Hill in Newry who in turn sold it onto the linen manufacturer John Grubb Richardson who lived in the adjoining estate, The Woodhouse. Richardson was responsible for establishing the village of Bessbrook and building Bessbrook Friends' Meeting House, which sits in the Derrymore demesne. In 1952 Mr. J. S. W. Richardson, a descendant of J. Grubb Richardson, donated Derrymore House and his estate at Bessbrook to the National Trust. The National Trust subsequently undertook to demolish a large portion of the house, which had been added by the Richardson family in the Georgian style, in order to return the property to the manner in which Isaac Corry had known it. The banner of Bessbrook Star of Hope Temperance Loyal Orange Lodge 927, depicts Derrymore House. During The Troubles, the house was damaged by explosive devices planted on five separate occasions between 1972 and 1979. The then custodian, Edmund Baillie, carried some of these bombs away from the house to the garden. Due to damage suffered by the structure at this time, most if not all of the timbers had been replaced and some changes made to the interior. The Derrymore estate became a military camp during World War II. Most of the structures built at this time have since been demolished and the ground re-landscaped. A concrete road and some earthworks remain. The estate hosted the US Army Quartermaster Depot Q111-D from 23 November 1943 to August 1944.

Name There are several meanings given to the root name of the \\"Zapotlán el Grande\\". \\"TzapoTl\\" is the name given to all the round fruits from the general region; another well-known fact among the locals, it states The full name Zapotlán means \\"my round fruits\\" in the ancient language. Round sweet fruits, not exactly zapotes as most people believe; however, it means guavas, tunas, tejocotes, cherries found in this region and still found in the low, wet valleys. A new theory of the name is Tzapot, which ends with Tzapotlan, and it refers to the goddess of medicine named Tzaputlatena. Image Adapted city tree portraying sweet round fruits. In 1971 the figure shown below became part of the city of Zapotlán el Grande, shown as a tree with three branches, with round fruits at the end of each branch and at the trunk a pair of teeth simulating a human mouth. This oil painting was embraced by the city officials under the administration of Lic. Genaro Alvarez Lopez, who ordered this work of art to be displayed in the city hall. This work of art eventually became a representation of the city indicating its strong ties with its ancestors of Zapotlán el Grande; also known as Ciudad Guzmán or plainly just Guzmán.  History  Prior to the arrival of the European Spanish Conquistadors, this area was the pre-Columbian kingdom of Zapotlán and was at different times under the domain of the nearby kingdoms of Colima and Michoacán. Zapotlán el Grande was conquered in 1526. Many treasures and weapons are said to be buried throughout the town's old colonial homes, buildings, and farms. In the mid-19th century, the name of the town was changed from Zapotlán el Grande to Ciudad Guzman, after the Mexican federalist insurgent Gordiano De Guzmán. The valley of Zapotlán was discovered by Friar Juan de Padilla who arrived to Tuxpan in 1532 in which he found three small towns. The small towns were Tzapotlán, Tlayolan, Tenamaxcatitlan and Mochitla. Friar Padilla settled down in Tenamaxcatitlan, where he taught the natives the Catholic doctrine. On August 15, 1533, the Spanish crown recognized the Pueblo de Santa Maria de la Asunción de Zapotlán in the place called the Portal de Sandoval.  Demographics  Zapotlán Coat of arms. The city is located at , 124 km south of Guadalajara, at a height of 1,507 metres above sea level. Its population totaled 93,609 in the 2005 census, ranking as the sixth-largest city in the state. Other geographical location explanations are as follows the city is located south-central in the state of Jalisco, west-central of Mexico. It is placed between the Sierra de Tapalpa and the Cerro del Tigre. Between Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara.  Tourism  Zapotlán is known for its cornFrom the beginning of the last century this important agricultural region became known for its unique geography and climate, that is inherently ideal for the abundant production of corn as well as for the commercial rearing of cattle. The general region has a noticeable French influence coalesced within the architecture of this Spanish colonial era settlement. This influence can be seen throughout the city, in the residences, municipal buildings, and public spaces. The Santa Catarina Hacienda, also a remnant from the Spanish colonial era, is one of the most popular and highly visited sites found in the region located just a few miles from the center of downtown Zapotlán. A site that is very popular among the locals is, \\"El Nevado\\" National Park and wildlife preserve. Located approximately 33 miles southwest from the city. The period between the beginning of January and the later of February are the most popular and eventful times to enjoy \\"El Nevado\\" peak. \\"El Nevado\\", now dormant and the seventh highest mountain in Mexico is the higher and elder of the two volcanoes that comprise the Neo-Volcanic Cordela. The Volcano to its south is known as \\"El Volcan de Colima\\", or \\"El Volcan de Fuego\\" It has been active since June 1998 and thus, hiking on \\"El Volcan de Fuego\\" is dangerous and prohibited. Zapotlán el Grande has been celebrating the customs and religious beliefs of thanksgiving adoring St Joseph for over 258 years. Senor Don José Prieto y Tovar committed himself to propagate the rituals of honoring the St. Joseph known in Spanish as \\"Senor San José\\" across America with the blessings of the archbishop Señor Don Geronimo Antonio de Obregón. Senor Obregón gave his superior permission on April 13, 1778 according to Cathedral of Nueva Granada, documentation located in Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico. This religious celebration gave birth to the \\"Fiestas de Octubre\\" begin on October 5–23. The \\"Fiestas de Octubre\\" offer sports activities, such as professional and amateur soccer, bullfighting till death, bicycle races, mariachi band competitions, the use of fighting cocks in cockfighting until one bird dies or both, animal exhibits, horse racing, girl beauty contests, and carnival rides totaling 19 days of celebration. 19 days of daily celebration every October Elevation Peaches known to the high and colder areas of Zapotlán Zapotlán el Grande is located at an elevation of 1530 meters above the sea level. It borders with six municipalities known as Gomes Farias towards the north, Tamazula de Gordiano towards the east, Zapotiltic is located on the southeast, Tuxpan is located south, Zapotiltic de Vadillo towards the east with San Gabriel. The municipality of Zapotlán el Grande has an area of 295.29 square kilometers.

The squadron is a descendant organization of the World War I 113th Aero Squadron, established on 26 August 1917. It was reformed on 1 August 1921, as the 113th Observation Squadron, and is one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II. History Unit was formed as 113th Aero Squadron in August 1917 at Kelly Field, Texas and then assigned as an aviation unit with the Pennsylvania National Guard, however apparently performed support duties as a supply unit. Redesignated the 634th Aero Squadron in 1918 Did not deploy to France as part of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). Squadron was demobilized in March 1919.Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces in the First World War Indiana National Guard Re-formed and its honors and lineage was combined (in 1936) with those of the 137th Squadron, Indiana NG, which had activated at Fagley Field, Indiana during August 1921 (equipped with Curtiss Jennies). Redesignated the 113th Observation Squadron on 25 January 1923, the unit relocated to Schoen Field and then Stout Field (formerly Mars Hill), Indianapolis in October 1926. The squadron, or elements thereof, called up to perform the following state duties: aerial surveillance of labor troubles in Vanderburg and Warwick Counties 22 February-23 March 1926; flood relief duties at Hazelton-Vincennes, IN, during the Wabash River flood 15–21 January 1930; aerial mapping survey of the state of Indiana in 1930; aerial surveillance of labor troubles during a coal miners' strike at the Dixie Bee Mine August–October 1932; flood relief efforts along the Ohio River in southern Indiana during January–February 1937. Supported the training of the 7th Cavalry Brigade at various times 1934–36. Conducted summer training at Wright Field, OH, or Godman Field, 1922–40. World War II The 113th was operating Douglas O-38Bs and North American O-47A/Bs when called to active duty on 17 January 1941 as part of the build-up of the Army Air Corps after the Fall of France. Ten days later the unit transferred to Key Field, Mississippi and began flying (assigned to the 67th Observation Group, 3d Air Force) Anti-Submarine patrols with O-47s, O-49s and O-52s over the Gulf of Mexico. Between 1942 and disbandment at Birmingham Army Airfield, Alabama on 30 November 1943 the 113th performed Operational Training for combat reconnaissance pilots in Bell P-39 Airacobras and other light reconnaissance aircraft. Indiana Air National Guard The wartime 113th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron was reconstituted on 21 June 1945. It was then redesignated as the 113th Fighter Squadron, and was allotted to the Indiana Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Stout Field, Indianapolis, Indiana, and was extended federal recognition on 9 December 1946 by the National Guard Bureau. The 113th Fighter Squadron was bestowed the lineage, history, honors, and colors of the 113th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron and all predecessor units. The squadron was assigned to the 122d Fighter Group, Indiana Air National Guard and equipped with F-51D Mustang fighters. The 113th and the 163d Fighter Squadron at Stout Field, Indianapolis were the operational squadrons of the 122d Fighter Group. Its mission was the air defense of Indiana. The 113th flew training missions primarily over the northern part of Indiana, while the 163d operated from Indianapolis south to the Ohio River border with Kentucky. During the postwar years, the Air National Guard was almost like a flying country club and a pilot could often show up at the field, check out an aircraft and go flying. However, these units also had regular military exercises that kept up proficiency and in gunnery and bombing contests they would often score better than full-time USAF units. =Korean War Federalization= With the surprise invasion of South Korea on 25 June 1960, and the regular military's complete lack of readiness, most of the Air National Guard was federalized placed on active duty. The 113th Fighter Squadron and its parent 122d Fighter Group were federalized on 10 February 1951. The 113th initially remained at Stout Field, Indianapolis, and the 122d Fighter Group established headquarters at Stout Field, Indianapolis along with the 163d Fighter Squadron at Baer Field, Fort Wayne, under Air Defense Command. ADC established the 122d Fighter-Interceptor Wing with the 122d Fighter-Interceptor Group as its operational unit with a mission for the air defense of Indiana and the upper midwest as part of the Eastern Air Defense Force. Both squadrons were re-equipped with very long range (VLR) F-51H Mustangs that were developed during World War II for long distance B-29 Superfortress bomber escort missions in the Pacific Theater. On 1 May the 113th FIS was dispersed to Scott AFB, Illinois and the 163d FIS to Sioux City MAP, Iowa; the 122d FIW being transferred to the ADC Central Air Defense Force. Now assigned for the air defense of the Central United States, the squadrons flew interception missions for ADC. The 122d FIW/FIG were inactivated on 6 February 1952, the squadron being reassigned to the 4706th Air Defense Wing. It was later transferred to the 33d Air Division on 1 April. Its period of federalization ended, the squadron was returned to Indiana State Control on 1 November 1952. =Air Defense mission= The unit was re-formed at Stout Field and continued to fly the F-51H Mustangs, returning to its pre- federalization air defense mission of Indiana. With the end of the line for the Mustang in USAF service, the United States Air Force, in an effort to upgrade to an all jet fighter force, required Air National Guard Air Defense Command units to upgrade to jet-powered aircraft. However, the facilities at Stout Field were inadequate for jet interceptor fighters and as a result the squadron was moved to Hulman Field, at Terre Haute, on 1 January 1954. In July 1954 the Mustangs were retired and the squadron was re-equipped with F-80C Shooting Star jets that had seen combat in the Korean War. In March 1956, conversion to refurbished and reconditioned F-86A Sabres commenced, and in April 1958 new F-84F Thunderstreaks were received. =Tactical Fighters= Two 113th Tactical Fighter Squadron F-84F Thundersteaks in Vietnam-era Camouflage livery flying in formation in 1966 In July 1959, the 113th was designated as a Tactical Fighter Squadron (Special Delivery), with a mission of the delivery of Tactical nuclear weapons. Although the 113th trained for the delivery of tactical nuclear weapons, it never had any actual nuclear weapons on hand, nor did the base at Terre Haute ever had nuclear weapon storage facilities. In 1959 and 1960 the squadron participated in exercises Dark Cloud and Pine Cone III, the latter taking place at Congaree AFB, South Carolina. In the exercises, the squadron practiced delivery of tactical nuclear weapons in the fictitious country of \\"North Saladia\\". In 1960, the unit performed extremely well during the annual \\"Ricks's Trophy Race\\" between Turner Air Force Base, Georgia and Hamilton Air Force Base, California. =1961 Berlin crisis= On 1 October 1961 the 113th and the 122d Tactical Fighter Wing was federalized and ordered to active service as part of Operation Tack Hammer, the United States response to the 1961 Berlin Crisis. Due to DOD budget restrictions, the 122d was instructed to deploy only a portion of its total strength and only the 163d Tactical Fighter Squadron was deployed to Chambley-Bussières Air Base, France, with the other two squadrons being on active duty at their home stations, ready to reinforce the 163d if necessary. On 6 November, twenty-six F-84F Thunderstreaks arrived at Chambley, with the wings support aircraft (C-47 and T-33A's) arriving by mid-November. Due to its reduced force structure, the wing was designated the 7122d Tactical Wing while in France. By 1 December the ground support units arrived and the 7122d prepared for an estimated overseas deployment of 10 months. Rotations of Air National Guard pilots from the stateside squadrons in Indiana was performed to train them in local flying conditions in Europe. This allowed the 163d to maintain 100 percent manning and also to relieve the boredom of the national guard pilots on active duty in CONUS and kept them connected to the overseas part of the Wing. The mission of the 7122d was to support Seventeenth Air Force and various NATO exercises in Europe, flying up to 30 sorties a day exercising with Seventh Army units in West Germany. NATO exchanges with the West German 32d Fighter-Bomber Wing occurred in April 1962 to increase understanding of NATO air integration and terminology. By April, the Berlin Crisis appeared to be settled and the Kennedy Administration was interested in saving money on this emergency call-up of national guard units. On 7 June the 163d was directed to return to CONUS with all personnel, however the aircraft and equipment were to remain at Chambley. The support C-47 and T-33s were flown back to Indiana, and in July the Air National Guardsmen of the 122 TFW/163 TFS returned to CONUS. On 16 July the 7122nd Tactical Wing was discontinued with its F-84F aircraft being turned over to the new 366th Tactical Fighter Wing. The Guardsmen were released from active duty and returned to Indiana state control, 31 August 1962. =Tactical Air Command= 113th Tactical Fighter Squadron – North American F-100D-75-NA Super Sabre 56-3198 in Vietnam War camouflage livery. After the Berlin Federalization, the 113th transferred its 25 F-84Fs to the active-duty USAF to fill gaps in TAC Wings; the aircraft being temporally replaced by RF-84Fs from the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Shaw AFB, South Carolina that was upgrading to the RF-101 Voodoo. The squadron flew the RF-84F until May 1964 to maintain proficiency but did not train in photo-reconnaissance. On 1 October 1962, the 113th was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 181st Tactical Fighter Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 113th TFS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 181st Headquarters, 181st Material Squadron (Maintenance), 181st Combat Support Squadron, and the 181st USAF Dispensary. Re-equipped with F-84Fs, in 1965, the 181st TFG deployed to Hickam AFB, Hawaii for Tropic Lighting I, an exercise designed to assist in the training of Army ground units prior to their deployment to South Vietnam. This deployment required two over-water air refuelings in either direction. In addition, the 113th deployed to Vincent AFB, Arizona for extensive gunnery, rocketry and special weapons delivery training. Row of 113th TFS F-4Cs painted in Air Defense blue-grey as part of Air Defense, Tactical Air Command at Hulman Field, 1988. The F-84F remained with the 181st until December 1971, when they were retired to AMARC and replaced by North American F-100C/D Super Sabres following their withdrawal from the Vietnam War. The F-100 remained with the squadron until 1979 and participated in numerous deployments and exercises. In April 1976, the squadron deployed to RAF Lakenheath, England as part of Cornet Prize, and was awarded an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for the period October 1975 to May 1976. The unit had the honor to fly the last active United States Military F-100 mission when it flew F-100D 56-2979 to MASDC (now AMARC), Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, in November 1979. In the summer of 1979 the unit had begun conversion to the F-4C Phantom II (actual aircraft were Vietnam War EF-4C Wild Weasel aircraft which had been de-modified). By 1 April 1988 the unit had completed its conversion to more the advanced F-4E version of the Phantom II. However, the squadron was not assigned the specialized Wild Weasel mission, and it operated its F-4Cs in the conventional strike role. With the receipt of the Phantoms in 1979, the 113th began using Tactical Air Command Tail Code \\"HF\\" on their aircraft (Hulman Field). The 113th initially operated the F-4Cs in a tactical role. In addition, they served in the air defense role as part of the Air National Guard taking over the mission of the inactivated Aerospace Defense Command for continental air defense. In the air defense role, the squadron operated under Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC), a named unit that operated at the numbered air force level of TAC. =Air Combat Command= Beginning in April 1991 the unit started its conversion to ex USAFE 50th Tactical Fighter Wing Block 25 F-16C/Ds (the last Phantoms left in October 1991) and completed this on 1 July 1992 when the last F-16 left Hahn Air Base prior to its closure. With the changeover to the F-16, the squadron changed its Tail Code to \\"TH\\" (Terre Haute). In 1992, the unit designation changed to 113th Fighter Squadron, 181st Fighter Group (15 March 1992) and in June its gaining command changed from Tactical Air Command to Air Combat Command (1 June 1992). On 1 October 1995 the 181st Fighter Group was changed in status to a Wing, this being part of the Air Force's One-Base, One-Wing requirement. Newly received Block 25 F-16 Fighting Falcons in April 1991. Note the changeover of tail codes from HF to TH, with both applied to different F-16s parked on the tarmac. In mid-1996, the Air Force, in response to budget cuts, and changing world situations, began experimenting with Air Expeditionary organizations. The Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept was developed that would mix Active-Duty, Reserve and Air National Guard elements into a combined force. Instead of entire permanent units deploying as \\"Provisional\\" as in the 1991 Gulf War, Expeditionary units are composed of \\"aviation packages\\" from several wings, including active-duty Air Force, the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard, would be married together to carry out the assigned deployment rotation. Since equipping with F-16s the Racers (The 113th's nickname coming from the proximity of Terre Haute to the Indianapolis 500 racetrack) have participated in a humanitarian deployment to Romania, provided security for the 1996 Summer Olympic Games and have deployed in support of Operation Southern Watch (operating from Al Jaber Air Base, Kuwait) and Operation Northern Watch (from Incirlik Air Base, Turkey). Additionally, the Unit received exceptional ratings on a number of higher headquarters evaluations. The 113th swapped their Block 25 F-16C/Ds for Block 30s in July/August 1995 and flew those aircraft until 2008. The units vipers were equipped with the LITENING targeting pod, a precision targeting pod system designed for Air Force Reserve's and Air National Guard's F-16 Block 25/30/32 Fighting Falcons. This precision targeting system significantly increases the combat effectiveness of the F-16 during day, night and under- the-weather conditions in the attack of ground targets with a variety of standoff weapons. =Global war on terrorism= 113th Fighter Squadron Block 30 F-16C 86-0261 in 2000 On 11 September 2001, the 181st Fighter Wing wasted no time in joining the War on Terrorism as it responded after the attack on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon in less than four hours to the task of flying Combat Air Patrols over the Midwest as part of Operation Noble Eagle. The 181st Fighter Wing drastically increased its operations tempo during the early 2000s to guard America's skies and protect freedom. The 181st deployed members and equipment to 19 countries to simultaneously support seven different military operations, including: Operation Southern Watch, Operation Northern Watch, Operation Joint Forge, Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Deep Freeze, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. =Air support operations= In 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure commission mandated the end of the flying era for the 181st. On 8 September 2007, the 181st Fighter Wing flew their last training mission out of Hulman Field International Airport. The Block 30 F-16 aircraft were reassigned to the 177th Fighter Wing, New Jersey Air National Guard at Atlantic City Air National Guard Base in September 2007. A realignment was directed with two new Air Force missions: a Distributive Ground Station (DGS) and an Air Support Operations Squadron (ASOS). On 3 May 2008 the 181st Fighter Wing was redesignated as the 181st Intelligence Wing. The DGS is an intelligence based mission, monitoring near real time video feed from Predators, Global Hawks and other unmanned aerial vehicles hovering the skies over any military area of operation. The servicemembers will process, exploit, and disseminate the video feed, providing actionable intelligence to the ground commanders and war- fighting forces. The ASOS will bring unity to joint forces fighting in the Global War on Terrorism. Their mission is to advise the ground commanders on the best way to utilize U.S. and NATO assets for close air support.

Saint Serapia was born at Antioch in the late 1st century, of Christian parents who, fleeing the persecution of Emperor Hadrian, went to Italy and settled there. When her parents died, Serapia was sought in marriage by many, but having resolved to consecrate herself to God alone, she sold all her possessions and distributed the proceeds to the poor. Then she sold herself into voluntary slavery, and entered the service of a Roman noblewoman named Sabina. The piety of Serapia, her love of work, and her charity soon gained the heart of her mistress, who became a Christian. She died in 119 CE. In the reign of Hadrian, Serapia was commanded to do homage to the gods of Rome. She refused and was handed over to two men who tried to rape her, but she resisted. They then tried to set her on fire with torches, but could not do so. By command of the judge Derillus, she was beaten with rods and then beheaded by sword. Her body was buried by Sabina in Sabina's own tomb, near the Vindician field, but the memory of her martyrdom is kept more especially on September 3, on which day their common tomb was finished, adorned and consecrated as a fitting place of prayer. In art, Saint Serapia holds a tablet or book; sometimes she appears with Saint Sabina.

It pined away after 4th in 1981–82 season and relegated to Third League after two successive seasons between 1987–1989. It yoyoed between old Second and Third Leagues after 1989. It was one of the founder teams of the new Third League, which is the fourth tier of the Turkish League system in 2001. It promoted to Second League after finishing as champion at Third Group of Third League in 2001–2002 season. It missed out promotion to Second League Category A next season. It pined away again after 2002–2003 season and relegated to Third League after finishing 8th or last in Fourth Classifiment Group of Second League Category B in 2005–2006 season. It struggled to escaping from relegation to Amateur League because of financial straits until 2007–2008 season. It finally relegated to Zonguldak Super Amateur League after losing 3–2 away match against Beylerbeyi, who is Galatasaray's pilot team and promoted to Second League, at Round 29. It finished 13th or 4th from last in Fourth Group of Third League. Its relegation meant no representative of Zonguldak province at Turkish League since 2008. Zonguldakspor finished Zonguldak Super Amateur as runner-up in 2008–2009 season and as champion in 2009–10 one and finally qualified for Regional Amateur League. It finished 4th this group and was forced to play-out against Demir Madencilik Dilaverspor, play-off winner of Zonguldak Super Amateur.

Vpu stands for \\"Viral Protein U\\". The Vpu protein acts in the degradation of CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the enhancement of virion release from the plasma membrane of infected cells. Vpu induces the degradation of the CD4 viral receptor and therefore participates in the general downregulation of CD4 expression during the course of HIV infection. Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation is thought to prevent CD4-Env binding in the endoplasmic reticulum in order to facilitate proper Env assembly into virions. It is found in the membranes of infected cells, but not the virus particles themselves. The Vpu gene is found exclusively in HIV-1 and some HIV-1-related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolates, such as SIV, SIV, and SIV, but not in HIV-2 or the majority of SIV isolates. Structural similarities between Vpu and another small viral protein, M2, encoded by influenza A virus were first noted soon after the discovery of Vpu. Since then, Vpu has been shown to form cation-selective ion channels when expressed in Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cells and also when purified and reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers. Vpu also permeabilizes membranes of bacteria and mammalian cells to small molecules. Therefore, it is considered a member of the Viroporins family.  Expression  Vpu and Env are expressed from the same bicistronic mRNA in a Rev-dependent manner, presumably by leaky scanning of ribosomes through the vpu initiation codon. In fact Vpu gene overlaps at its3′-end with the env gene. Several HIV-1 isolates were found to carry point mutations in the Vpu translation initiation codon but have otherwise intact vpu genes. Since removal of the Vpu initiation codon results in increased expression of the downstream env gene, it is possible that HIV-1 actually uses this mechanism as a molecular switch to regulate the relative expression of Vpu or Env in infected cells. The possible benefits of such a regulation are unclear.  Function  Two main functions have been assigned to the Vpu protein. The first function is known to induce degradation of the viral receptor molecule CD4, and the second function is to enhance the release of newly formed virions from the cell surface. Vpu accomplishes these two functions through two distinct mechanisms. In the case of CD4, Vpu acts as a molecular adaptor to connect CD4 to an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex resulting in CD4 degradation by cellular proteasomes. This requires signals located in Vpu’s cytoplasmic domain. Enhancement of virus release on the other hand involves the neutralization of a cellular host factor, BST-2 (also known as CD317, HM1.24, or tetherin) and requires Vpu’s TM domain. however, the exact mechanism of how Vpu counteracts BST-2 is still unclear. In the absence of Vpu, tetherin binds to the viral envelope and ties it to the cell membrane and other viral particles, impeding release of the viral particles. Recent data suggest that the BST-2 transmembrane domain is crucial for interference by Vpu. The interaction of Vpu and BST-2 results in the downregulation of BST-2 from the cell surface. BST-2, which is an interferon (IFN)-inducible cell surface protein, appears to “tether” HIV to the cell in the absence of Vpu. BST-2 is a heavily glycosylated 29- to 33-kDa integral membrane protein with both a transmembrane domain and a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (GPI). At the cell surface, BST2 resides in lipid rafts through the GPI anchor, whereas its TM domain lies outside them, indirectly interacting with the actin cytoskeleton. Vpu primary site of action is the plasma membrane, where this protein targets cell-surface BST-2 through their mutual TM-to-TM binding, leading to lysosomes, partially dependent on βTrCP.  Structure  Viral protein \\"u\\" (Vpu) is an oligomeric, 81-amino acid type I membrane protein (16 kDa) that is translated from vpu-env bicistronic mRNA. The N-terminus of Vpu encoding the transmembrane (TM) anchor represents an active domain important for the regulation of virus release but not CD4 degradation. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (54 residues) that contains a pair of serine residues (at positions 52 and 56) constitutively phosphorylated by casein kinase 2. The phosphorylation of two serine residues in the cytoplasmic domain is critical for CD4 degradation in the ER. Based on 2D 1H NMR spectroscopy of a peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu, it was proposed that the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu contains two α-helical domains, helix-1 and helix-2, which are connected by an unstructured region containing the two conserved phosphoseryl residues. In addition, computer models predict a third α-helical domain in the transmembrane domain of Vpu, which could play an important role in the formation of ion channels.

The greater portion of the Crow's Nest Peninsula is approximately and lies within the coastal plain of Virginia. About of the peninsula is protected as part of the Virginia Natural Area Preserve System. Virtually the entire Crow's Nest Peninsula is forested with an impressive, mature stand of mixed hardwoods. Hardwood forests of this extent are becoming increasingly rare in the Virginia and Chesapeake Bay coastal plain due to prevalent forestry practices and fragmentation of natural areas for development and agriculture. The size and continuity of this hardwood stand enhance its viability and its value in providing a large, unfragmented natural area for diverse organisms. Within a relatively short time (50–100 years), this forest will also comprise a substantial occurrence of old-growth forest with inestimable scientific, biological, and aesthetic values. Currently, trees greater than diameter at breast height (dbh) are common, and very large relict tree specimens are scattered throughout the site. The entire Crow's Nest Peninsula is undeveloped and is primarily forested with mature stands of hardwood trees such as oaks and hickories. This is especially true in the eastern half of the peninsula and the northern slopes facing Accokeek Creek. The coastal plain landscape in this region of Virginia was formed beginning in the late Triassic period, approximately 230 million years ago, through the rise and fall of the sea. Crow's Nest is approximately in length from east to west, across and rises above the surrounding Accokeek and Potomac creeks. The peninsula is highly dissected on its north and south sides by steep ravines flowing into these two fresh-water tidal creeks. In contrast, most landscapes in the coastal plain of Virginia are relatively flat and/or gently rolling. Crow's Nest's dramatic rise to above Potomac and Accokeek creeks is startling compared to the adjacent peninsulas in Stafford County, such as Marlborough Point and Widewater Peninsula, which are relatively flat. A large portion of Crow's Nest is composed of calcareous, or calcium-rich, soil layers from ocean or marine animals that once lived at the bottom of a vast inland sea. Most soils in the Piedmont and coastal plain of Virginia are not calcareous or limey and thus tend to be acidic. This calcareous soil strata within Potomac Creek is referred to as the Aquia Formation, which is 60 million years old. The Aquia Formation is found within a larger outcrop belt known as the Pamunkey Group, a sequence of Lower Tertiary (Paleocene-Eocene) sands and clays that formed in shallow marine environments beneath the western margin of the Atlantic Ocean. The Aquia Formation is composed of marine sediments that are dark green to gray-green, argillaceous, highly glauconitic, well sorted fine-to medium grained sand with shell beds up to in depth. Today, shell- marl/calcareous ravine forests such as those at Crow's Nest are not common anywhere in the mid-Atlantic region. These plant communities are rare to this coastal plain ecosystem. There are two nutrient-rich plant communities associated with lime sands and localized shell concretions at Crow's Nest. One can be broadly classified as Basic Mesic Forests (G2, globally imperiled). Another rare community found at Crow's Nest that is typically associated with the shell-marl/calcareous environments is the Basic Oak-Hickory Forest (G2, globally imperiled). These are found on two very steep slopes facing Potomac Creek and represent this plant community. Much of the shell-marl/calcareous ravine forests that do still exist on the east coast of the United States have since been heavily logged. In assessing natural communities in need of protection, the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation listed the state's few remaining calcareous ravine forests to be conservation priorities. The Crow's Nest site is perhaps Virginia's best remaining example of this rare forest community. Due to the unusual subsurface calcareous soil formations underlying most of the peninsula, the unusual soils are basic (alkaline) and give rise to rare plants and plant communities. This is due to the ability of the limey soils at Crow's Nest to neutralize and buffer soil pH within the range 6.3 to 6.8. Elements such as calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) create conditions in the soil that raise the pH of the soil and increase nutrient availability for plants. This results in the establishment of more robust and diverse vegetation at Crow's Nest. Additionally, disjunct plant communities at Crow's Nest are found that are not common in the Piedmont and coastal plain of Virginia, as these areas generally have lower pH soils. These rare or \\"disjunct\\" plants and plant communities include small-flower baby-blue-eyes (Nemophila aphylla) and glade fern (Athyrium pycnocarpon). After assisting and conducting field surveys for rare plant species and plant communities, the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, Division of Natural Heritage determined in 1999 that \\"Crow's Nest is considered one of the finest, if not the finest example of mature forests remaining in the Coastal Plain of Virginia.\\" These forest communities on the peninsula consist of several distinct community types. The peninsula supports several regionally and globally rare plants and plant communities, two of which are ranked Globally Imperiled (G2) by NatureServe. Geologic history A view of Crow's Nest from across the Potomac River The mid-Atlantic Ridge started to form in the early Jurassic period (175 million years ago), breaking apart the super continent Pangaea and beginning the expansion of the modern Atlantic Ocean. It has widened steadily to its present size. This rifting event separated North America from Africa, and the area known today as Virginia became the trailing edge of the newly formed North American continent. The Jurassic Period is found in the Mesozoic Era, or the Age of the Dinosaurs. The Mesozoic Era spanned a length of time from 251 million years ago to 66 million years ago. In the early Eocene Epoch (55.8 million years ago) the Coastal Plain of Virginia was completely underwater. Sediment accumulating beneath this sea eventually would become the Crow's Nest of today. The Paleocene and the Eocene epochs are found in the Cenozoic Era, or the age of the mammals. The Cenozoic Era spanned a length of time from 66 million years ago to the present. During the Eocene, the Atlantic Ocean was considerably narrower than it is today, making migration relatively easy for marine animals. The climate of Virginia during this period was considerably warmer than it is today. According to extensive records, the Earth experienced its warmest interval of the past 66 million years during the early Eocene, and Virginia was probably much warmer than central and southern Florida today. The remains of large alligators and turtles have been found at this latitude in Virginia. The calcareous soil strata within Potomac Creek, the Aquia Formation, is 60 million years old. This formation is found within a larger outcrop belt known as the Pamunkey Group, a sequence of Lower Tertiary (Paleocene-Eocene, 55.8 million years ago) sands and clays that formed in shallow marine environments beneath the western margin of the Atlantic Ocean. The Aquia Formation is composed of marine sediments that are dark green to gray-green, argillaceous, highly glauconitic, well sorted, fine-to medium-grained sand with shell beds up to in depth. Biology Crow's Nest has been referred to as a \\"biological gem\\". There have been few formal surveys for rare plant and animal species, however, mostly conducted by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation in the late 1990s. Virtually the entire Crow's Nest Peninsula is forested with mature stands of mixed hardwoods. In the words of Gary Fleming, Natural Heritage Program ecologist, \\"Overall, Crow's Nest supports one of the finest—if not the finest—upland hardwood forests remaining in the Virginia Coastal Plain.\\"Gary Fleming, Virginia Department of Conservation & Recreation, Division of Natural Heritage Report, October 1999. Surveys documented two state-listed species and the potential habitat for two other federal listed species and several state- listed species. Several Stafford County records for plants and two state- listed endangered plant species were found, including ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) in rich ravines and river bulrush (Scirpus fluviatilis) in adjacent tidal marshes. Suitable habitat was found for small whorled pogonia (Isotria medeoloides), although it does not grow there. The peninsula is forested with huge trees, some over in diameter, including chinkapin oak (Quercus muhlenbergii) and tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera). Other trees include bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis), pignut hickory (Carya glabra), black walnut (Juglans nigra), and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). In addition to the high-quality forests found at Crow's Nest, there are approximately of freshwater tidal marshes surrounding the peninsula that account for 60% of all marshes in Stafford County. The marshes are in nearly pristine condition and represent some of the best examples found in the state.Final Environmental Assessment for Proposed Accokeek Creek National Wildlife Refuge, December 2000 Several environmental factors exert important influences on vegetation on the Crow's Nest Peninsula. First, the steep terrain made most of the site unsuitable for agriculture, so it was never fragmented or plowed. It is one of the largest unfragmented patches of hardwood forests in Virginia's coastal plain. The steepness also limited logging to a substantial degree. Secondly, the mix of freshwater tidal wetlands, ravine bottoms, steep slopes of various aspect, and high ridgecrests has led to a high biodiversity, including sites important in neotropical bird migration. Lastly, the Lower Tertiary deposits in this part of the mid- Atlantic Coastal Plain consist largely of glauconitic sand, shelly clay-silt, and some sandy limestone and calcium-rich sands. These contribute to the development of relatively basic, nutrient-rich soils. Basic or calcareous soil environments are uncommon to rare on the Virginia coastal plain and can support vegetation unusual for the region.Virginia Department of Conservation & Recreation, Division of Natural Heritage Report, October 1999 Crow's Nest is surrounded on three sides by a freshwater-tidal estuary, and a multitude of resident and spawning fish thrive in these waters. Local fishermen captured the shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum), a federally listed endangered fish, twice in 2002. A variety of marine fossils have been found on the shores of Crow's Nest. These include Paleocene-epoch shark teeth, as well as ancient parts of rays, turtles, and numerous mollusks of genus Turritella. Turritella has an elongated, highly coiled corkscrew shape. The internal molds and casts of these gastropods can be found in these waters and are especially plentiful at nearby Bull Bluff on Potomac Creek. Many of the calcareous ravine forests on the east coast of the United States have been logged, and the Virginia Department of Conservation listed this ecosystem as a conservation priority. The Crow's Nest site is one of Virginia's best remaining examples of this rare habitat and associated vegetation types. These communities are rare in the coastal plain ecosystem. The principal rich forest associated with ravines down-cutting into lime sands and localized shell concretions is currently classified as the Northern Coastal Plain/Piedmont Basic Mesic Hardwood Forest and is found on two dry, very steep slopes facing Potomac Creek. More study is required for a better understanding of the environment and ecology at Crow's Nest. In the larger context of biodiversity protection in Virginia and the mid-Atlantic region, the factors which contribute to the unique character of this region and its important neotropical migrant populations include its size, large-patch community dynamics, its diversity of habitats, and the known or potential occurrence of rare ecosystems and biota. Native Americans Crow's Nest Peninsula is steeped in important local, state and national history. Important events happened here, and important people lived extraordinary lives at Crow's Nest. Evidence of significant Native American, colonial, Civil War and modern history are found at Crow's Nest and the adjoining lands within the estuary of Potomac and Accokeek creeks. Native peoples in the region The archaeological record reveals that native peoples have been in this area of the coastal plain of Virginia since the Early Archaic period, around 9000 BC. It was thought that due to the steep topography at Crow's Nest the Patawomecks may not have lived in permanent villages adjacent to the surrounding water, though they definitely hunted and camped there. In October 2005, Cultural Resources Inc. (CRI) conducted a Phase I archaeological resource inventory of Crow's Nest and found archaeological evidence of several Late Woodland domestic occupations associated with hamlets or villages. In one area of Crow's Nest, a large number of unfinished stone points were found, indicating that Indians had once used the property as a stone-tool-making workshop. Directly across the mouth of Accokeek Creek from Crow's Nest Point there are the archaeological remains of a Patawomeck Indian town at Indian Point on the Marlborough Point Peninsula's western tip. \\"Patawomeke Town\\" was a community of the Patawomeck tribe for which the Potomac River is named. There are several different spellings for the native people who inhabited this area. (\\"Patawomeck\\" will be used in this article.) The original pronunciation may never be known. This area of Potomac Creek and the Potomac River is a boundary between three major Late Woodland Period Indian groups, Iroquoian-speaking people to the north, Siouan-speaking people to the western Piedmont, and Algonquian-speaking people on Potomac Creek. The name Patawomeck name may mean \\"trading place\\". It is certainly true that Potomac Creek Ware is iconic to the region and has a wide distribution, found hundreds of miles from its place of origin. One of the most endangered archaeological sites in Virginia, the remains of a large 13th-century and 13-ringed palisaded Indian community was found next to Indian Point, nationally catalogued as 44ST2. Today, small pieces of cord-impressed Potomac Creek Ware pottery continue to be found along the shoreline. Radiocarbon dates on carbonized wood at this site have established that the town was occupied between 1300 AD and 1550 AD. The latter dates suggest that this particular town was not inhabited by the post-contact period in the 17th century, and that a neighboring village site (44ST1) at Indian Point had replaced it by then. John Smith encountered the Patawomecks in 1608. Indian Point is believed to be where Pocahontas, Powhatan's daughter, was captured by Captain Samuel Argall in 1613. Relatively peaceful relations between the English and Patawomecks continued from 1608 to 1619. Captain Samuel Argall with his ship Discovery sailed into Potomac Creek and gained nearly 400 bushels of corn, peas and beans and many furs in 1610. It is believed that trade with the Patawomecks increased the chances of Jamestown Colony surviving the first ten years. The Patawomecks did not fight against the English in the first Indian war led by Opchanacanough against the English in March 1622. By the summer of 1622 documentation exists that a Captain Madyson tragically turned on the Patawomeck tribe, killing 30-40 and burning a village. By the 1670s English homesteads dotted the Potomac River shores far past Potomac Creek. There was a gradual abandonment of the Patawomeck homelands, with the people primarily going to live among other Algonquian-speakers, including the Potopacos (Portobago Bay on the Rappahannock River to the south. The Potomac Neck area was patented to John Rookwood and later to Giles Brent in 1651. The last chief of the Patawomecks, Wahanganoche, was alleged to be murdered in Caroline County, Virginia, in 1664. Historical records show that the Patawomecks ceased to exist as an organized society after the late 17th century. In her book Pocahontas’s People, Helen Roundtree states that \\"No patent mentions the site of the Patawomeck town and no documents mention the Patawomecks at all after 1665.\\" Frank Speck, author of Chapters on the Ethnology of the Powhatan Tribes of Virgini, believed that a small group of families, whose names are mostly Newton and Green, represent what may be the residue of the Indians who are recorded to have inhabited Potomac Creek. Speck estimates their number back in the 1920s to be about 150. The records of the people who were descendants to the Patawomecks were largely destroyed during the Civil War. Additionally, it may not have been popular in the 18th and 19th centuries to claim Indian ancestry due to the racial attitudes that existed then. This may be one of the reasons that state recognition of the Patawomecks as an Indian tribe is difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, in the 1990s, the descendant community of the native peoples of Potomac Creek reorganized as the \\"Patawomeck Tribe\\" and conduct regular tribal events and powwows in Stafford County. The Patawomeck received official recognition from the Commonwealth of Virginia in February 2010.http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/national/southeast/86633287.html?m=y Civil War Not much is known about Crow's Nest's direct involvement during the American Civil War except for the burning of the Daniel homes and their eviction from Crow's Nest. Due to its close proximity to well-documented military sites and activities, Crow's Nest undoubtedly harbored Union forces at the time. According to D.P. Newton of Stafford County and curator of the White Oak Museum in Stafford, a brigade of Union troops held ground at Crow's Nest. Stafford County is situated halfway between the capitals of the Union and Confederacy during the Civil War and thus became a large depot for important campaigns in Fredericksburg, Spotsylvania County, and Orange County. According to the National Park Service, \\"the area around Fredericksburg has the most blood-soaked ground than anywhere in America.\\" The battles of Fredericksburg, Wilderness, Chancellorsville, and Spotsylvania Courthouse were fought within a radius all south of Crow's Nest. Eric Mink, historian with the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park, interprets the following events surrounding Crow's Nest in south Stafford: \\"With Virginia's secession from the Union in April 1861, Stafford County quickly became part of the frontier between the warring sections of the country. The nearness of the Potomac River caused immense concern among Confederate authorities, as the idea of large flotillas of Union gunboats descending the Potomac resulted in panic among Virginia residents. In May 1861, Confederate forces moved into Stafford County and erected batteries along the Potomac shore. The idea was to create a blockade of the river that would neither allow warships to descend the river, nor allow supply ships up to Alexandria and Washington, D.C. The defenses also helped to protect the northern terminus of the Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac Railroad, located at Aquia Creek Landing. Artillery positions were established at the mouth of Aquia Creek and even on Marlborough Point. The Potomac batteries harassed Yankee shipping throughout the winter of 1861 and 1862.\\" Because of its location on the Potomac River and its proximity to Fredericksburg, Aquia Landing was destined to play an important role in the Civil War. It was the site of one of the war's earliest military engagements and became a major supply base for the Army of the Potomac in three separate campaigns. On May 31, 1863, there was the first engagement of the Civil War between the U.S. Navy and the shore batteries of the Confederacy at Aquia Landing. In the spring of 1862, the war shifted south toward Richmond, and the Confederates abandoned the Potomac River defenses. As fate would have it, Crow's Nest would be in the wake of the northern Armies of the Potomac that would occupy south Stafford. Since 1854, the terminus of the Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railroad (RF&P;) had been located at Aquia Landing, where travelers transferred to steamships to complete their journey to Washington, D.C. Subsequently, Federal armies arrived en masse in southern Stafford County in 1862. Aquia Landing and Belle Plains, directly across from Crow's Nest, immediately became critical junctions for moving men and material southward. Potomac Creek became a major off-loading and depot for tens of thousands of men engaged in fighting the major campaigns in the Fredericksburg area. During the Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville campaigns, from November 1862 through June 1863, southern Stafford County was occupied by more than 100,000 troops of the Federal Army of the Potomac. Union forces marched into Stafford County in the spring of 1862. While the war played out around Richmond, Federals in Stafford County acted as a barrier or shield for Washington, D.C. The Potomac River became the lifeline for the Federals in Stafford. Supplies steamed down the river and to Aquia Creek Landing. The Federal occupation lasted through the spring and summer, before developments around Manassas forced the evacuation of Stafford in September 1862. The Union Army of the Potomac returned to Stafford County in November 1862. Over 100,000 strong, the Federals made the southern part of the county their home for the following seven months. Once again the Potomac River was alive with ships and transports, bringing supplies, food and equipment. More landings opened to handle the steamers and barges. Aquia Creek Landing was again very busy, as were wharves at Belle Plains, Hope Landing and Marlborough Point. Hospitals grew up around these landings, as battle casualties and sickness took its toll on the Union army. Throughout southern Stafford County, winter camps sprang up, and the occupation of the area changed its appearance. Wood lots fell to the soldiers' axes, and small huts covered once-farmed fields. Almost certainly, the area known as Crow's Nest felt the intrusion of war, given its close proximity to Belle Plains and the shipping lanes. It is likely that camps and hospitals were established there, although documentation of these sites remains scant. In June 1863, the military activities shifted elsewhere, and once again the Union army abandoned Stafford County. Their return did not come until May 1864. In 1862, after General Burnside's costly loss at the battle of Fredericksburg, the Federal Army of the Potomac went into winter camp, with many Federal units bivouacked in southern Stafford County over the next eight months of the 1862 campaign. The largest known encampment near Crow's Nest was located at Belle Plains on the southern bank of Potomac Creek. In addition to a camp, supply base and a hospital, Belle Plains was also a prisoner of war camp for Confederate troops captured during the battles of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania Courthouse in 1864. Today, this area is known as Belle Plains. The spring of 1864 saw a renewed Union offense in Virginia. In the central part of the state, the Army of the Potomac drove into the heart of Spotsylvania County. The battles of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court House produced horrific casualties, as well as prisoners. Wounded Union soldiers and Confederate prisoners, destined for the hospitals and prisons in the north, were transported once again to the base at Belle Plains. A large prison holding area along the south side of Potomac Creek became known as the \\"Punch Bowl\\". Thousands of southern soldiers were held there while they awaited transportation north. Across the creek, on the Crow's Nest peninsula, wartime maps show that the captors set up artillery positions to cover the prisoners. As the war shifted south, once again Stafford County was left to its inhabitants. They felt the intrusion of the Union army only once more, when in June 1865 the victorious forces of the United States marched through the county on their way home to Washington, D.C. Stafford County was devastated by the Federal occupation. The great conflict left south Stafford County barren and almost completely devoid of trees, food, forage and homes. Many homes were burned, and the population of Stafford County was greatly reduced. The northern troops destroyed hundreds of homes, and those that remained were severely damaged. The countryside was denuded of vegetation, and agricultural fields were trampled and reduced to over-ground patches of wild shrubbery. The Daniel family of Crows Nest did not fare well during the Civil War period. As previously stated, going back to March 1857, Supreme Court Justice Peter Vivian Daniel was a part of an overwhelming majority of the Court who decided Dred Scott should be returned to slavery in the infamous Dred Scott Decision of 1857. He served on the Court until his death in 1860. Although Moncure Daniel Conway, one of the most famous Southern abolitionists at the time, was related to the Daniel family, Stafford County was Confederate territory, and the inhabitants of Crow's Nest were considered southern sympathizers. According to Raleigh Travers Daniel, whose father was born at Crow's Nest, \\"the northern armies forced the evacuation of the family home and the house was fired upon.\\" According to Jerrilynn Eby: \\"As the marauding Union soldiers streamed onto the tract in 1862, the family loaded a wagon with what they could carry and fled towards Fredericksburg. While crossing the Rappahannock River, the wagon overturned and all their belongings were lost. Back at Crow's Nest, the Union soldiers ransacked the house, carrying off whatever they wished. Because it offered such a fine vantage point of the creek, the soldiers set fire to the house, thus preventing its use by Confederates. When the family finally returned to Crow's Nest, all that remained was a small table out in the yard. Some soldier had carried it out of the house, perhaps decided it was too large to take with him, and dropped it in the yard. It was the family's only household possession that survived the war. By the 1920s another house had been built on the tract, this one standing in the approximate center of the peninsula.\\" Additionally, Eby states, \\"During the War Between the States, the Crow was used for blockade running, much to the dismay of the Union. Northern gunboats finally cornered the Crow and her crew in Potomac Creek. Had they captured the ship, the Crow would have been confiscated for use by the invading forces. Realizing that the situation was hopeless, the captain of the Crow ordered the crew to raise all sails and attain maximum speed. Rather than lose his ship to the Union cause, the captain ran her aground on the sand bar off Marlborough Point, crushing the hull. The crew then waded ashore and disappeared into the safety of the Stafford forest. The ribs of the ship remained near the shoreline well into the 20th century.\\" After the death of John Moncure Daniel III in 1865, the remarkable history of Crow's Nest seems to have come to an abrupt end as the Daniel family was forcefully evicted from the property in the 1860s and the inhabitants of the peninsula were gone.

Zumbado, was a Cuban writer, journalist, critic, humorist, and essayist. In his words, \\"humor is a weapon, because it criticizes and exposes at the same time, and does so with a smile. Then that who is targeted cannot get too angry.\\"Prosas en ajiaco, p. 237 He has published: Limonada (Lemonade), 1978; Amor a primer añejo, 1980; Riflexiones (a portmanteau word that could be translated as Riflections), 1980; Prosas en ajiaco (Proses on pottage), 1984; El American Way (The American Way), 1981; ¡Esto le zumba!, 1981; and Kitsch, Kitsch, ¡BANG, BANG!, 1988. He has written for several Cuban and foreign press publications, like Juventud Rebelde and the magazine Bohemia. Zumbado has collaborated with publications of Chile, Uruguay, Dominican Republic, Algeria, India, Norway, and the former GDR (German Democratic Republic), among others (3). In 2000, he was the first person to be awarded the Cuban National Humor Award (Premio Nacional de Humorismo) (3). As a social manners critic, his favorite subject is bureaucracy.Prosas en ajiaco, p. 247 Biography Héctor Zumbado was born in the zone of Vedado, at Havana, Cuba, in 1932. His mother was born in Nicaragua, and his father was from Costa Rica. They met in Madrid, and married in New York City. In the decade of the 1930s his father, who worked for a transnational company, was moved to the company's office in Havana (Prosas en ajiaco, p. 236). From 1948 to 1950, Zumbado resided in the United States (3) where he studied for the bachelor degree in the early 1950s. During that time, he wrote some works for a publication in English language. He took a commercial career at a university in Kentucky, which he left unfinished, because of, as he stated, hating numbers (Prosas en ajiaco, p. 236). H. Zumbado's life as a worker started in Venezuela, where he worked as a commercial translator, money collector in a navigation company, and salesman (Prosas en ajiaco, p. 234). In Caracas, Venezuela, he tried to become a bullfighter, though he did not pass beyond \\"the phase of the wooden bull, with a real head and wheels\\" (Prosas en ajiaco, p. 234). He went to Haiti, in 1953 (3) and worked as an auditor for the electric company at Port-au-Prince. In his own words: \\"they were looking for a young person who could speak French and knew about accounting and I took the chance, though the one thing I had to fulfill the requirements was my youth, since I had no knowledge of French or accounting.\\" (Prosas en ajiaco, p. 235). From 1953 to 1956 (3), Zumbado worked at a North American Insurance company, as an archivist, and was fired after straying the policy of a Gómez Mena family aristocrat's jewels (Prosas en ajiaco, p. 235). He has also worked as an office systems seller (Prosas en Ajiaco, p. 235). Zumbado worked in Cuba mixing products in a laboratory, of the brand GRAVI, where they made deodorants. As he said: \\"I went out so clean and fragant every day, that I didn't need to take a bath, I looked like a baby.\\" (Prosas en ajiaco, p. 235). Between 1956 and 1961 he was a writer of publicity texts for tourism agencies (3). That was his job by 1959 with the advent of the Cuban Revolution. In 1961 he was appointed as a publicity chief at INIT (Prosas en ajiaco, p. 236), and then worked as a researcher of the demand, in a research department of the Ministry of Industries, until 1963 (3), when, he would start doing the same work for the Ministry of the Food Industry. That was up to 1967, when he moved to Juventud Rebelde. In 1963 he wrote several stories for the magazine Bohemia, which was his initiation in literature. Between that year and 1967 he published about fifteen stories, in a humorous style and mood. Due to this, he was asked to work with La Chicharra, a humor publication of Juventud Rebelde. He accepted because, as he states, he wished to work as a writer (Prosas en ajiaco, p. 248). In La Chicharra he wrote the section Limonada (Lemonade), that would later be published in the newspaper on Sundays, between 1969 and 1970, to be compiled later in a book in 1978. From Juventud Rebelde, he went to work at Prensa Latina, where he wrote an international section, that was released in about fifteen countries, under the title El American Way, satirizing the North American way of life. Later on, between 1971 and 1973, Zumbado was a chief editor at the magazine Cuba, and at La hiena triste (The sad hyena), a publication of the UNEAC (Union of Artists and Writers of Cuba) (3). Then he worked for the Institute of the Domestic Demand as an exportable funds publicity and promotion adviser of the integral promotion group (EMPI), where he worked together with his wife, Mabel (Prosas en ajiaco, p. 236). Between 1986 and 1988 H. Zumbado worked as chief of the humor page of Bohemia, and had some collaborations, in 1987, with the Cuban radio station Radio Rebelde (3). In 1988, he started working as chief editor of the Cuban tourism magazine Sol y Son. In the year 2000, H. Zumbado was awarded the National Humor Award (Premio Nacional de Humorismo) of Cuba. Zumbado was the first to be given the award, since that was its first edition (3). Zumbado has been awarded the medal Raúl Gómez García, and the class of the National Culture (3). He has two sons and two daughters, from oldest to youngest: Héctor, Karla, Yamil, and Teriana (Prosas en ajiaco, pp. 235–236). Literary work Limonada Limonada (Lemonade, in English) is a series of short articles of manners, written by H. Zumbado for the Cuban newspaper Juventud Rebelde. There were about forty published from May 1969 to March 1971, mostly on Sundays. (Limonada, p. 9). Commenting on the purpose of the work, the author states: :\\"I think that, generally speaking, Limonada attempts to criticize some habits, especially of some deficiencies in temperament, character, and personality; of some negative attitudes and other vices inherited since the times of Cristopher Columbus (...), that represented the tiny thing of 466 years, 2 months, and three days, influencing every day the Cuban idiosyncrasy, and, as it is to expect, were not to be eradicated in only twenty years of a new and higher way of being. On the other hand, Limonada attempts as well to catch some general traits of our peculiar psychology, including its positive facets.\\" (Limonada, p. 9). About the title, H. Zumbado asserts: \\"This section was called this way because it was intended to be something fresh and that's all the truth and not as some claim -including my wife- that the title is as well due to the acid in the lemon.\\" (Limonada, pp. 8–9). The articles were compiled in the book Limonada, published in 1978, by the editorial Letras Cubanas. The book featured a \\"Prilogue\\", which, in the author's words, is a hybrid of a prologue and an epilogue; to help with readers who would read the prologue after reading the rest of the book, or the epilogue before; and helps with writers and critics who would write a good epilogue for a prologue, and vice versa. This \\"prilogue\\" was written by Héctor Zumbado himself. The illustrations in the book were made by Jorge Hernández, and the cover of the book was made by Guerrero. The book has thirty-eight short stories, grouped in four sections. The grouping in three sections was done for the book, and not for the original articles or their publication. Riflexiones Riflexiones is a series of articles written by H. Zumbado, and published weekly, on Sundays, in the newspaper Juventud Rebelde. In the author's words: \\"Riflexiones is just an attempt of synthesis of what people say\\" (Prosas en ajiaco, p. 238). While Limonada is more about personal traits in the society of the time, Riflexiones is rather about attitudes, methods, and situations (Prosas en ajiaco, p. 245). One of the best virtues of these Riflexiones of Zumbado are that they are legible, understandable by every kind of readers, with any cultural level, but without easy concessions. He does not hesitate, indeed, in using plenty and in a very smart way, the literary, historical, or philosophical citations; but without resulting in a dark text for those readers who do not know the references . Riflexiones was published as a book in 1980. The term riflexión is a portmanteau word, merging rifle (Spanish for rifle) and reflexión (Spanish for reflexion, meditation). Therefore, riflexión could be translated as riflection. The term riflexiones is its plural form. As a verb, it is riflexionar, which could be translated as to riflect. In H. Zumbado's own words: \\"I thought of name of the section as a word play that combines thinking, reflecting, and the concept of critics, a kind of focusing and aiming.\\" (Prosas en ajiaco, p. 237). ¡Esto le zumba! The book ¡Esto le zumba! was published in 1981. The content of the book is twenty-five short stories. The stories are full of sharp criticism about social aberrations and Cuban manners; with a spontaneous, sarcastic, and funny style (¡Esto le zumba!). According to the author, the book is about all the stories that he had written in the last twenty years; from El hombre del teléfono (The man of the phone), written in February, 1963, to La croqueta (The croquette), written in early March, 1981 (¡Esto le zumba!, p. 7).

It remains the only internationally approved programme specific to Small Island Developing States (SIDS) which has been collectively and unanimously endorsed by SIDS.  Development of the BPOA  The full text of the BPOA was produced in Bridgetown, Barbados in 1994 at the first Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island States, a conference mandated by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 47/189. The need for an islands specific conference was highlighted some two years prior at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (Earth Summit), held in Rio de Janeiro where 179 governments voted to adopt Agenda 21. Chapter 17, section G of Agenda 21 acknowledges that \\"small island developing states are a special case both for environment and development ... [and] are considered extremely vulnerable to global warming and sealevel rise.\\"  BPOA+5  In 1999, the General Assembly of the UN held a special session to appraise five years of progress on the implementation of the BPOA (BPOA +5). The Assembly recognized progress as 'uneven' and identified key trends including increasing globalization, widening inequalities in income and a continued deterioration of the global environment. A new General Assembly Resolution (S-22/2) promised further action.  BPOA+10  The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, agreed to at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2002) affirmed UN commitment to 'full implementation' of Agenda 21, alongside achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, the BPOA, and other international agreements. To this end, it recommended the convening of an International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Program of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. Upon receipt of the recommendation, the General Assembly of the UN passed Resolutions 57/262 and 58/213, which mandated an International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States to take place. The meeting was held in Port Louis, Mauritius between January 10-14, 2005. The final report emerging from this meeting significantly revised the original BPOA, and verified what previous reviews were alluding to, that the implementation of the BPOA had been largely unsuccessful. What emerged from it was a reorganising of the Programs \\"priority areas\\" and an entrenched commitment to the notion that economic growth would ultimately contribute to sustainable development.

In machine learning the margin of a single data point is defined to be the distance from the data point to a decision boundary. Note that there are many distances and decision boundaries that may be appropriate for certain datasets and goals. A margin classifier is a classifier that explicitly utilizes the margin of each example while learning a classifier. There are theoretical justifications (based on the VC dimension) as to why maximizing the margin (under some suitable constraints) may be beneficial for machine learning and statistical inferences algorithms. There are many hyperplanes that might classify the data. One reasonable choice as the best hyperplane is the one that represents the largest separation, or margin, between the two classes. So we choose the hyperplane so that the distance from it to the nearest data point on each side is maximized.

Like many of his stories, it puts the author's own profession of anthropology into a science fiction context. In this case, the addition of time travel theoretically enables the scientists to observe primitive humans in the past. The results, however, are unexpected. Plot summary Anthropologists Ben Hazard and Ed Stone join a top-secret project which uses a time-travel device, affectionately known as \\"the Bucket\\", to return in time to observe human development throughout history. They are shocked to discover that, if they travel far enough into the past to research hominids such as Sinanthropus, they find nothing. There is no trace of humans or any related species in the deep past. Hazard returns from a trip in which he proves that Sinanthropus did not exist in the time indicated by the age of the bones. He, Stone and their mentor, Franz Gottwald, discuss the problem. Gottwald, a by-the-book scientist, insists on facts, not speculation. They therefore decide on an exhaustive effort to discover when, and how, humans did appear on Earth. Travelling back and forth in the past, Hazard and Stone happen upon an extraordinary event in France, over 25,000 years ago, near a cave where Cro- Magnon remains were found in their time. They see a gigantic spaceship land. Humans emerge, along with robots of various shapes and sizes. Using fantastic technology they shape the land into a primitive home, complete with artifacts such as stone tools. They deposit some apparently brainwashed humans wearing animal skins. They also bury objects in local caves. Hazard is sure that these are bones left for future generations to find. Returning to modern times, they join Gottwald to try to solve the mystery. Clearly humans did not arise on Earth. The bones planted were probably genuine, but must have been brought from the real home of humanity. They can understand why humans might be seeded on another world, but not why the bones were planted. Hazard takes a fishing trip to take his mind off the problem, hoping that an idea will occur to him. Remembering one of the chimpanzees used by his project trying to solve a simple puzzle, he decides that the whole thing is a gigantic experiment, a puzzle to be solved with some reward at the end. He also realizes that a necessary part of the experiment is an observer, someone who can monitor it. Such a person would want to get close to the time-travel project, and the best candidate is Gottwald himself, who came from Europe and never talks about his past. Hazard finds Gottwald's house deserted. Entering, he finds a letter addressed to him, from Gottwald. It tells him that he has solved part of the puzzle, and for the rest he must press a hidden button and stand outside. He does this and is transported to the spaceship, still in orbit about Earth after 25,000 years. There he meets Gottwald and his wife, who are the last survivors of the people who came in the ship. Humans arose on a distant world, discovered faster-than-light space travel, carved an empire for themselves, and were then almost exterminated by the Enemy, a race of vicious monsters. So horrific are these creatures that they are part of human \\"racial memory\\", being the demons and dragons and other creatures out of nightmare. The ship is one of four sent as a last desperate measure. The human race had to start again. It needed a \\"transfusion\\" of new ideas and ways of thinking, in order to survive the inevitable future encounter with the Enemy. Gottwald tells Hazard that his people never discovered time-travel. It may be the answer they were seeking. They wait for Ed Stone, who will surely solve the problem and join them.

Art Pepper played at the Village Vanguard jazz club in New York City twice during 1977. The second occasion was recorded and was released as three albums: Thursday Night at the Village Vanguard, Friday Night at the Village Vanguard and Saturday Night at the Village Vanguard. Further tracks appeared on the album More for Les at the Village Vanguard and a complete record of Pepper's residency was subsequently released as The Complete Village Vanguard Sessions. In the sleeve notes, Pepper says of his own tunes: > My tunes are very difficult to read and interpret. I write down all the > parts, and ask my group to play it like it's written for a while and then > just use it as a guide and play with their own feelings. Of \\"But Beautiful\\" he says: > Billie Holiday sang this song so beautifully. I've always been influenced by > the way a good singer can express something beyond the words of a song. I > try to express the quality of the human voice when I'm playing a ballad.

An Encyclopedia of Fairies. New York: Pantheon Books. p. 243 When a person falls asleep by the side of a spring or stream, the Alp-luachra appears in the form of a newt and crawls down the person's mouth, feeding off the food that they had eaten. In Robert Kirk's Secret Commonwealth of Fairies, this creature feeds not on the food itself, but on the \\"pith or quintessence\\" of the food.Kirk, Robert (1933) [1893]. The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns, and Fairies. Dover Publications. A man haunted by a joint-eater will never grow fat, because the pith or quintessence of the food is consumed by the fairy.. People who consume newts are thought to be plagued in this way. In Douglas Hyde's collection of folk tales, Beside the Fire, a farmer, who was starving from an Alp-luachra, was eventually rid of the fairy. He was instructed to eat large amounts of salted meat and, when he could eat no more, lie still with his mouth open just above the surface of a stream. After having been driven to thirst by the salt, the offspring of the Alp-luachra, and eventually the Alp-luachra mother herself, jumped into the water. Hence, to rid one's self of an Alp-Luachra, one should eat a large quantity of salt beef, without drinking anything, and then lie by a running stream with their mouth wide open; after a long wait, the Alp-Luachra will become thirsty, and will jump into the stream to drink.

Named for Alice B. Toklas, the award is given once, only, in appreciation of career achievement. In addition to the medal, each recipient is given a lapel pin and a significant honorarium. The Award was founded by Roberta \\"Sandy\\" Sandburg who died of cancer at the age of 72 on June 16, 2009. Sandy envisioned the Alice B Awards a decade or so ago, and in 2004 decided to make the awards a reality by committing funds from \\"an anonymous donor.\\" A lifelong reader who was passionate about lesbian fiction, Sandy wanted to thank and reward the authors who had given her so much joy, and she did so by establishing the Alice B fund and gathering a group of women who became the Alice B Readers Appreciation Committee. In addition to Alice B Medals, until 2016 the Committee awarded Alice B Lavender Certificates to up- and-coming authors who do not yet have a body of work but who have published a remarkable work or two deserving of notice. Winners of the certificate received an honorarium of $50. After 2016, the Lavender Certificate was suspended. Due to the overwhelming number of debut writers, the Committee was no longer able to read so many books.  Significance of the Award  Historically, lesbians have rarely had their voices heard in the fiction or nonfiction of modern society,Alice B Awards Winners. Retrieved on 2008-05-31. (except perhaps as footnotes in medical journals regarding pathology). As Bertha Harris, author of many novels including Lover, once wrote: \\"Between the time of Sappho and the birth of Natalie Clifford Barney lies a 'lesbian silence' of twenty-four centuries.\\"Bold Strokes Alice B Award Winners . Retrieved on 2008-05-31. It wasn't until the 1970s and the establishment of Naiad Press (after the Stonewall riots in 1969), that books by, for, and about lesbians began to be regularly published. Still, it was a long hard road with little recognition and to this day, considerable difficulties and discrimination face authors of lesbian works. The Alice B Award is one small contribution toward overcoming discrimination. As Martha Nell Smith so cogently wrote: > \\"The trajectory of lesbian literature for the first two-thirds of the > twentieth century can be described as a movement from encrypted strategies > for expressions of the love that dare not speak its name to overtly > political celebrations of woman-for-woman passion that, by the late 1960s, > refused to be denied, denigrated, or expunged.\\"Alice B Award Winner Lori L. > Lake. Retrieved on 2008-05-31. The Alice B Award exists to honor and recognize forerunners of modern lesbian fiction including such luminaries as Ann Bannon, Jane Rule, Marijane Meaker, Katherine V. Forrest, and Lee Lynch as well as to the new voices who are providing information, entertainment, and enlightenment to lesbians around the world.  The Alice B Awards Committee  The Alice B Awards Committee is an anonymous group of avid lesbian readers. The award is made possible by an anonymous donor. The donor and committee share a common goal: to reward and thank writers of lesbian fiction for their contribution to the lesbian community, culture, and identity. At least two Medals are given out annually. Selections are made from lists compiled by the committee members’ all-time favorite living authors currently publishing and those who have not published in more than five years.

It comprises thirteen short webisodes released on its website and YouTube. Overview The series tells the story of a single girl who deals with the lonely reality that all her friends are in serious relationships by creating imaginary friends to talk to. But, as Edie explains: \\"They're not really my friends; they're horrible bitches.\\" The show stars Eden Riegel, Elizabeth Hendrickson, Brooke Nevin and Connie Fletcher-Staton. Guest stars include Michael Traynor, Jessalyn Gilsig, Aaron Staton, Greg Rikaart, James Kee, Chandra West, Brittany Ishibashi, Sam Page, Charlie Koznick, and Billy Aaron Brown. Imaginary Bitches episodes have been viewed over 4 million times.YouTube - ImaginaryBitches's Channel In May 2008, Imaginary Bitches became a YouTube Partner, allowing the creators of the show to share revenue from advertising on YouTube video pages.YouTube Partner Program Overview: YouTube Partner Program The show is something of a family affair. Show creator Andrew Miller is married to lead actress Eden Riegel. Riegel's half-sister, Tatiana S. Riegel, edits the episodes, and her brother, Sam Riegel, co-wrote episode 6 and sound edited episodes one and two. Quyen Tran, the cinematographer, is Sam Riegel's wife. Characters Eden and friends Eden (Eden Riegel): The protagonist of the series. She is slightly self- conscious and extremely lonely due to all of her friends being in relationships. She also has difficulty finding and keeping a boyfriend. She creates the Bitches to have someone to talk to. Her enemies are Brittany, who stole her boyfriend, and Jessalyn, who backstabbed her. She unsuccessfully attempted therapy. One of her favorite shows appears to be Greys Anatomy, she plays a game with The Bitches where whenever someone says \\"Seriously\\" they have to eat a piece of chocolate. Lizzie (Elizabeth Hendrickson): One of Eden's oldest friends, she appears to be perky and very friendly, as well as being open minded to Eden's single-ness. She has a forgetful boyfriend named Jake. In one episode, she breaks up with him after he reacts badly to her thoughts about weddings; however, she calls him in the end. In the same episode, she has an imaginary wedding in a way similar to the bitches but on a larger scale. Brooke (Brooke Nevin): Appears to be Eden's closest friend. She considers herself to be very supportive of Eden, and helps her when they run into an old nemesis and sets her up with her shrink. She was the first of Eden's friends to learn about the Bitches, as well as the first to intervene. Her boyfriend Michael is extremely well organized, which sometimes bothers her. Connie (Connie Fletcher-Staton): Eden's most promiscuous friend. She sets Eden up with a man from her office. She prefers not using condoms (citing it as her favorite thing about no longer being single) and has had sex dressed as Catwoman. Her priest is a former porn star. The bitches Initially created to be friends to talk to, they quickly developed mean personalities. Though Eden is the only one able to see them they have communicated with Brittany. Although they appear to be best friends they also constantly are at each other's throats. Catherine: The first bitch, Catherine is the meaner of the two. She can be very greedy, shown when she demanded twice the salary of the cast of Desperate Housewives. She is described by Heather as being snobby. She dislikes Dr. Kee, refusing to even enter his office although he falls in lust with her. She compares Eden's friends to the Pod People when they attempt to set her up with the perfect guy. Heather: The nicer, if more promiscuous bitch. She is described by Eden as being around 5'4\\", with dirty blonde hair, wide green eyes, and pouty lips. Catherine calls her an anorexic whore. Eden says everything about her is perky. She has an infatuation with bald men, and wants to have sex with Dr. Kee because of his baldness. She would like to have sex with the entire cast of The CW (both male and female), the Jonas Brothers, and Hannah Montana. She has a sexual fantasy involving baseball. Mark's avatar Brett almost hooks up with her. Jennifer: The nicest bitch, she is actually a lesbian, and falls in love with Eden. Enemies Jessalyn (Jessalyn Gilsig): Eden's nemesis. She appears to dislike non-single people, and invites Eden to a singles party. Although she at first appears to be friendly, she quickly becomes a bitch. According to Heather she has an imaginary friend who thinks she's \\"psycho.\\" She winds up being a lesbian and ruins Eden's attempt at lesbian dating by hooking up with Eden's date. Brittany (Brittany Ishibashi): A wannabe Guru and yoga instructor and failed actress. She had stolen Eden's boyfriend, but now wishes forgiveness. Catherine and Heather appear to her (the only time someone beside Eden has directly communicated with them) and trick her into confessing to be a fake. Men Waiter Guy (Michael Traynor): A waiter who Eden sleeps with. The relationship seems to be going well, but when she has no one to talk to about the night before, Eden creates Catherine. They break up after Catherine insults Waiter Guy. Bruce (Aaron Staton): A man at Jessalyn's singles party. Although Jessalyn promised him to Eden, she later uses her knowledge of the Bitches to take him. He calls Jessalyn \\"a sexy Mother Teresa.\\" Mark (Greg Rikaart): A Second Life fanatic who works with Connie. He was set up with Eden because of their mutual imaginary worlds. He attempts to hook his alter-ego Brett up with Heather. Eden breaks up with him after he tries to masturbate to a Heather avatar that Mark created after hearing a description of Heather and her fantasies. Dr. James Kee (James Kee): Brooke's shrink and the author of #1 bestselling self- help book, \\"Your Psyche Has a Secret.\\" Catherine hates him, refusing to enter his office. Heather flirts with him, due to her attraction to bald men. He soon proves to be crazy after becoming infatuated with Catherine and even trying to have sex with her. Father Grant (Charlie Koznick): Connie's priest. He is an ex-porn star who attempts to rid Eden of the bitches by having sex with her, apparently the plot of one of his movies. Episodes Eden's Europe Vlog Ten vlogs were made chronicing Eden (the actress, as opposed to the character) in Europe with Catherine and Heather. The reason for the trip was a hiatus caused by re-negotiations of the bitches' contracts, which nearly resulted in them being replaced, going as far as Andrew sending Eden audition videos for replacements. A video setting the vlogs up was also made, as a press conference. It is implied during these videos that Heather is bisexual and somewhat of an ephebophile; as part of the contract she requests sex with male and female actors on The CW, as well as teenagers The Jonas Brothers and Hannah Montana.
