Schaeffer) (February 16, 1812 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania ‚Äì November 2, 1892 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), was the founder of the Lutheran Home at Germantown for Orphans and an active leader of many ministries of the Lutheran Church in Philadelphia. She was the wife of Rev. Charles William Schaeffer and mother of four children. Early history Elizabeth was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on February 16, 1812 in the Germantown area. Her parents were James Ashmead and Eve Frey (Fry). Elizabeth was baptized at St. Michael's Lutheran Church in Germantown on May 18, 1812. She had five older siblings, (John, William, Anna, James and Charles) and two younger siblings (Catherine and George). Elizabeth and George (born in 1818) would grow up to be very close friends and business partners. Elizabeth was confirmed at St. Michael's in 1825 by Rev. John C. Baker. In 1826, her mother Eve, died at the age of fifty-three. In 1828, Rev. Baker was called to Trinity, Lancaster and the new pastor, Rev. Benjamin Keller was called to St. Michael's. This move would be very important in Elizabeth's life because a long with this new pastor came her future husband, Charles W. Schaeffer. Charles' father died when he was two and so his mother, Catherine, remarried Rev. Keller and by the time they moved to Germantown, Charles was confirmation age.  Early career  As Rev. Keller began his service at St. Michael's, issues of women's role and their place in the church began to arise. In December, 1833, Elizabeth was a key leader in a meeting of women and men to develop a missionary and education society at St. Michael's. They submitted a constitution to Rev. Keller to take before the congregation and on January 22, 1834, the Female Domestic Missionary and Education Society of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of St. Michael's Germantown was born. Elizabeth was elected the first secretary of the Society and held the position until 1837, until she was forced to step down because of her marriage to, the now ordained, Rev. Charles W. Schaeffer (married in 1836). He was ordained at St. Michael's in 1835 but served at Barren Hill and Whitemarsh parish. Elizabeth's resignation from the Society and departure from St. Michael's came around the same time that Rev. Keller was asked to resign by the congregation due to issues around using German or English during the worship services and issues over whether or not women could vote in religious settings. Afterwards, Elizabeth attended Barren Hill and Whitemarsh with her husband, Charles W. Schaeffer. There is strong indication that she assumed strong leadership roles in every congregation that her husband served and she was the head of many benevolent organizations throughout the years. In 1841, she and Rev. Schaeffer moved to Harrisburg where they became the parents of two sons and two daughters: Katherine, Charles, Eva, and William. In 1849, St. Michael's Germantown had moved to an all English speaking worship service and were in need of a pastor. It took months to fill and but they finally called Rev. Charles W. Schaeffer and Elizabeth. Elizabeth would resume her leadership roles in the Missionary and Education Society and lead it in a new direction with the creation of an Orphan's Home.  Founding the Lutheran Home at Germantown  = The Story of the First Dollar = As Elizabeth began to increase her role in leadership at St. Michael's, she and her husband were visited by the Rev. William A. Passavant on his way to the Ministerium of Pennsylvania. Passavant was known for his work in developing social ministries and he had recently opened an Orphan's Home in Pittsburgh, PA. Depending on the account it differs as to which one made the original suggestion, but in talking Rev. Passavant and Elizabeth came to the conclusion that Philadelphia also needed an Orphans' Home. And so, Passavant said to her, \\"Now, everything must have a beginning: I will give you the first dollar.\\" Elizabeth placed that dollar in her knitted purse and began working tirelessly to start the Lutheran Home at Germantown for Orphans.Kretschmann, T.W. (1923). The Church's Treasures. Philadelphia, PA: A.J. Holman Company. pp. xvii‚Äì51. = Opening and Leadership = The Home opened on March 12, 1859 and it was clear that at first the Home was managed by women under the leadership of Elizabeth. She had the chief administrative role as director and treasurer. Other women helped to manage the home around her and would meet with her weekly to sew and help with other needs for the children. On May 1, 1860, a constitution and by-laws were finalized, officers were elected and an application was sent to the state for incorporation for the Home. Two ladies were to be chosen by each of the local Lutheran congregations to be representatives to constitute the Board of Lady Managers. While the Board of Trustees constituted of mostly men (other than Elizabeth Schaeffer as the director), it was especially stipulated that the Board of Trustees were not to interfere with the domestic affairs of the Home but that responsibility fell to the Board of Lady Managers. This included the hiring and firing of all staff, the selection of orphans and, the supervision of staff, including matron, nurses, and servants. Elizabeth Schaeffer saw over everything. She presided over the Household Committee of the Board of Managers and held the position of treasurer of the Home, looking over income and expenditures. = Changing Roles = In 1864, as the amount of orphans increased and Elizabeth's role was changing Elizabeth's brother, George Ashmead, took over as treasurer. The amount of orphans being received rose drastically because of the number of children orphaned due to the conflict of the Civil War. As of July 1865 there were 68 orphans, October 2nd there were 107, and by the next April there were 131 orphaned children. Due to the increase in children, the Board of Trustees decided to construct additional buildings. Elizabeth played a large role in as she led several fundraising events, like a great fair in 1869. Due issues of finances and debt, the Board of Trustees decided to disband the Board of Lady Managers and give direct management of the Home to the Ministerium of Pennsylvania. Elizabeth had always opposed the transfer to the Ministerium but many family and friends disagreed with her. On April 9, 1872 the legislature approved the change and it was announced to the Board on May 16, 1872, although Elizabeth was not present. The Board of Lady Managers was disbanded and a new one, the Board of Lady Visitors, was created to support the children of the Home, at which point a new President was elected, Mrs. Mary Steiner. Although she had firmly opposed the transfer to the Ministerium, Elizabeth remained active in the Home as a fundraiser and worked with the Board of Lady Visitors, even becoming the President again in 1878.  Time at the seminary  When the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia opened in 1864, Elizabeth's husband's uncle, Charles F. Schaeffer was the head of the faculty and the only full-time professor. During this time, the women of the Lutheran congregations of Philadelphia became active in assisting the institution. The women, including Elizabeth, sent a letter to the new board encouraging the creation of a women's committee to \\"superintend and regulate the domestic departure of the institution.\\" The women helped to make significant improvements to the campus. In 1872, a new building was erected and ladies from congregations all around contributed furniture and hosted an open house. In 1875, Charles W. Schaeffer was elected as the Burkhalter Professor at the Seminary and he and Elizabeth and their family moved closer to the seminary at 4784 Germantwon Ave. This is where Elizabeth would spend her remaining years, just a few houses down from where she was born.  Death and remembrance  Elizabeth Fry Ashmead Schaeffer passed away on November 22, 1892. After her death the Board of the Germantown Home passed a resolution: > Resolved, that while we humbly bow to our Father's will and gratefully > acknowledge His goodness in permitting Mrs. Schaeffer to serve Him so long > and so faithfully in this life, we pray that her example may stimulate > others to follow in her steps, as she followed Christ. In 1903, the Schaeffer-Ashmead Memorial Chapel was constructed at the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia in honor of Elizabeth Fry Ashmead Schaeffer and her husband and Professor Rev. Charles W. Schaeffer. The Memorial was given by their son, Rev. William Ashmead Schaeffer (missionary superintendent of the Ministerium of Pennsylvania), and their daughter, Katie Schaeffer.

Dhamayatra have been used many times, especially in south east Asia, including Thailand. One of the most famous Dhamayatra in Thailand is ‚ÄúDhamayatra of Lumpatao River Basin‚Äù (Thai: ‡∏ò‡∏£‡∏£‡∏°‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏∏‡πà‡∏°‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏•‡∏≥‡∏õ‡∏∞‡∏ó‡∏≤‡∏ß) which is a 7-day event held every year in Chaiyaphum province. ‚ÄúDhamayatra of Lumpatao River Basin‚Äù has been held 16 times with the purpose of creating awareness of environmental problems in Thailand.  History  Pra Paisan Visalo, one of the Dhamayatra of Lampatao River Basin founder = Lampatao Environment Issue = A long time ago, Lampatao river basin had an abundance of nature. But after the industrial revolution came to Thailand in the 1880s, the government changed the country‚Äôs direction. They started a forest concession and created the Lumpatao Dam, which involved destroying a lot of forest in the process. They also encouraged farmers to do monoculture farming which uses a lot of chemical compounds. As the time past, the Lampatao River basin lost a lot of forest, many local animals and plant went extinct, and local people also faced many natural disasters. = Starting the Campaign = Luang Pho Kam Khean and Phra Paisal Visalo of Wat Pa Sukato in Lampatao River Basin observe that the environment in this area is a critical issue. They started the Dhamayatra in the year 2000[1] in order to generate an awareness of this environmental issue. The main target was the local villagers.  Daily life and activities  Group of Dhamayatra of Lampatao River Basin preparing the caravan Dhamayatra group meditating on the mountain during the sunset Water checking activities in Dhamayatra of Lampata River Basin = People = A core team consists of monks from Wat Pa Sukato who are led by Luang Pho Kam Khean and Pra Paisan Visalo and the group also includes people from the province. Moreover, each year other interested people participate in the events, including villagers, student activists, and NGO workers. = Route = The walking path is changed every year, but it always is approximately 100 km in length, which is split into seven days. Participants start by walking only a short distance in the very first day and then increase the distance slightly with each successive day. Each day is split into morning and afternoon trips, with a lunch break in between. And there are some short breaks during each period. They walk past a variety of atmospheres. The participants walk across the mountain, the forest and the city by the lead of monks. They continue the walk, regardless of the weather. = Living = The waking goal in each day is to arrive at the next milestone in order to rest at night, which is almost always a temple. Because in Thailand, a Buddhist country, many temples are spread all around the country, so it is a very good place for the group to get rest. The meals, including breakfast and lunch, come from food that villagers have given to the temple. They don‚Äôt take dinner due to the monks' dietary rules. But some days, the group also need to rest in a forest. On those days, meals need to be pre- prepared. = Meditating = Because Dhamayatra uses the thought of Dhamma, the participants also meditate. Praying and meditating are done both in the morning and in the evening. They also pray for the nature before starting the walk each day. = Activities = This campaign also has activities for people in the group which can be separated according to two purposes. The first are science-based activities which give knowledge. They have water checking activities to show the problems of low-quality water in the area they walk past, blood tests to show how many chemical compounds are in their bodies, and an organic fertilizer making activity to teach villagers an alternative to using chemical fertilizers. The second are social-based activities which help the people in the group to know each other better, such as games and the exchanging of knowledge and experience.

Traces of the earlier building exist in the crypt. The bell-tower, embedded with spolia, was begun in the 12th century. Because the site had a nearby cemetery, many of the tombstones were reutilized in the church. The church was refurbished during the 16th and 18th centuries. The main portal (1597) was donated by the bishop Paolo Sanvitale. To the left of the entrance portico is the Chapel of the Innocents, with frescoes that recall the founding of the church and the Life of Santa Abbondanza, supposedly buried here.

The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attack. At least 16 people were killed and at least 30 were wounded. On 29 May 2016, ISIL gunmen and a suicide bomber attacked another Real Madrid fan club in the same area, killing at least 12 people and injuring around 15. They were attacked while watching the 2016 UEFA Champions League Final. Events During the first attack on May 13, around 50 fans of Real Madrid were gathered in a caf√© in Balad, to discuss their arrangements for their favorite team's upcoming football match, when six armed men stormed into the caf√© and started to shoot at the young men. Reports claim that grenades were also used to attack those gathered to watch the match. Several attackers reportedly fled the cafe and then detonated themselves, one was captured but then burned to death. At least 14 people were killed outright and two more died of their wounds later on. More than 30 people were injured. Responsibility Survivors of the attack blamed the attack on May 13 on ISIL and its opposition to football. In its claim of responsibility, ISIL said the attack had targeted Shia militiamen, making no mention of any connection to Real Madrid. Some believe that the claim stems from the extremist groups ideology against football, as they believe it is a product of western society. Reaction The attack was condemned by soccer fans around the world. Javier Tebas Medrano the President of Spain's La Liga responded to the attack with the statement \\"Terrorism has attacked football. We are with the victims and their families.\\" The Real Madrid football club itself expressed \\"great sadness\\" and offered its \\"regards and condolences\\" to the families and friends of the victims. Real Madrid players wore black armbands for their away game against Deportivo de La Coru√±a, on 14 May 2016, as a mark of respect.

Pepito Kawit followed-up by striking Allan's diaphragm with the butt of an armalite, causing Allan to fall against a cement box. Brion thought Allan was already dead, but Kawit said, quote, \\"His death will come later.\\" Aurelio Centeno, who eventually became a star witness, joined Sanchez's personal aides Edwin Cosico and Raul Alorico to watch television at the adjacent resthouse. Alorico told Centeno that the Mayor had been eagerly waiting for the group and worried that they will not arrive. At around 1:00 a.m. of the next day, a crying Eileen was dragged out of the resthouse by Luis and Medialdea, her hair disheveled, mouth covered by a handkerchief, hands still tied and stripped of her shorts. The Mayor, clad merely in white polo, appeared and thanked Luis and Medialdea for the gift. \\"I am through with her. She's all yours,\\" the Mayor uttered in contentment. When asked what will happen to Allan, Medialdea assured the Mayor that they will also kill him for full measure. Eileen and Allan were then loaded in the Tamaraw van by the appellants and headed for Calauan, followed closely by the ambulance. Kawit finished off Allan with a single gunshot from his armalite. The men then stopped at a sugarcane field in Sitio Paputok, Kilometro 74 of Barangay Mabacan, and gang-raped Eileen. Kawit invited Centeno to join the sexual fiasco but Centeno refused as he cannot, in conscience, bear the bestiality being committed on Eileen. At the end of the gang-rape, the six men decided to shoot Eileen in the face in order to hide their crime. When Eileen cried while knelled and pleaded to the six men to spare her life, Eileen said to the six men, quote, \\"Please, you have taken everything from me. My shame, my honor.

Convictions On March 14, 1995, Pasig Judge Harriet Demetriou concluded the 16-month Sarmenta-Gomez murder trial with the finding that Calauan Mayor Antonio Sanchez and several henchmen (only some of whom were policemen) were guilty of raping and murdering Sarmenta and killing Sarmenta's friend. Demetriou, in her 132-page decision, described the crime as being borne out of a \\"plot seemingly hatched in hell.\\"[4] Sanchez is currently serving (7) terms of reclusion perpetua (40 years per term) for the crime. On January 25, 1999, the Philippine Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Regional Trial Court. On August 29, 1999, Sanchez was given a double life term by the Supreme Court for a different case (Murders of Nelson & Rickson Pe√±alosa in 1991). Together with his seven life terms for the Sarmenta-Gomez murder, Sanchez will have to spend a total of 360 years in jail.[5] Release order controversy A report by GMA News showed that Sanchez could have walked free in August 2019, according to a document bearing the signature of then-Bureau of Corrections director Nicanor Faeldon. The document said the release order was for one Antonio Leyza Sanchez, \\"who was found to have served 40 years upon retroactive application of RA No. 10592 and was certified to have no other legal cause to be further detained, shall be released from confinement.\\" RA 10592 is the law allowing convicts an early release based on good conduct time allowance (GCTA). Sanchez's kin had said that they were informed about Sanchez's impending release, but public outrage prompted the government to review the GCTA law. On September 4, 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte has fired Bureau of Corrections chief Nicanor Faeldon after the latter approved the release of Sanchez.

An inscription on the back wall indicates it was constructed in 1263, commissioned by Abbot Teodino. http://www.storiadellarte.com/articoli/guida/AFFRESCHI%20ORATORIO%20DI%20SAN%20PELLEGRINO.html The oratory was believed to have been constructed over the tomb of San Pellegrino of Syria, a saint evidently highly regarded in this area, but little is known about him. UNESCO declared the oratory a World Heritage Site in 1996.  Architecture  An eighteenth-century porch marks the front facade, while a bell tower tops the back.http://www.storiadellarte.com/articoli/guida/AFFRESCHI%20ORATORIO%20DI%20SAN%20PELLEGRINO.html The small space (18.7 x 5.6m) comprises a single nave with ogival vaults in 4 bays. (Interior of Oratory) It is lit by three small windows on each side and rosette windows on the front and back facades. The space is divided by a half wall that must have served to separate lay visitors from the monks. The interior walls are entirely covered with frescoes, which date to the late 13th century.  Frescoes  4 rows of frescoes decorate the walls. At the lowest level are faux hanging curtains. Above, 3 rows of narratives represent scenes from the childhood of Christ, the Passion, the Last Judgment, the lives of St. Pellegrino and other saints, and months of the calendar. It has been suggested that a Charlemagne cycle was also included (now fragmentary).Baschet, J√©r√¥me.Lieu sacr√©, lieu d'images.

He was awarded a PhD from the University of Edinburgh in 1989 for research investigating the structure and function of the malate synthase gene in cucumber supervised by Steven M. Smith and Chris J. Leaver. Career and research From 1990 to 1993 he was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Plant Sciences at the University of Oxford. He was appointed a lecturer in the division of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at University of Glasgow from 1994 to 1999. During 1994, he was a SERC/NATO funded research scientist in Department of Plant Biology at Stanford University. He has been Chair of Biochemical Genetics at York since 1999. Graham's interests include how plants make and breakdown various metabolites, how these processes are controlled and how they impact on plant growth. He has used biochemical genetics to dissect the main metabolic pathways controlling oil mobilisation in Arabidopsis seed and provided new insight into how a lipid based signal controls seed germination. He has used similar approaches to investigate the synthesis of bioactive compounds in two of the world's major medicinal plants. This has led to new understanding of how genome rearrangement has shaped the evolution of plant metabolism. The discovery of a 10 gene cluster responsible for the production of the anti- cancer compound noscapine in opium poppy provided the tools for molecular breeding of new commercial varieties. The discovery of a novel Cytochrome P450 ‚Äì oxidoreductase gene fusion described the last unknown step in synthesis of morphine and codeine. Characterisation and genetic mapping of traits responsible for production of artemisinin in Artemisia annua has enabled development of F1 hybrid seed that can deliver a robust source of this vital antimalarial medication for the developing countries. =Awards and honours= Graham was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2016.

The reservoir, which has three islands within it, also has an established commercial fisheries development programme operated by the Fisheries Department. Construction of the dam, including the irrigation system, was started in 1961 at an initial cost of Rs. 3.65 crores (1954 price level) which was revised to Rs. 101.19 crores (1970 price level). The irrigation command was partially developed in 1980 with a total CCA of . To complete the irrigation development in the entire command a new scheme titled \\"Extension, Renovation and Modernisation (ERM) Irrigation Project\\" under the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) initiated by the Prime Minister of India, was approved by the Planning Commission in the year 2008 for an estimated cost of Rs 30.0 crore, to cover balance CCA of 1,247 hectare. Geography Vadakodan Mala Kanjirapuzha Dam The Kanjirapuzhan Dam is located on the Kanjirapuzha River, a tributary of the Thuthapuzha River, which itself joins the Bharatapuzha River, a part of the west-flowing rivers from Tadri to Kanyakumari.

It was founded by K≈´kai in 824 and predominantly consists of a large water garden centering about a pond. It is said to be the oldest existing garden in Kyoto.  History  First built in the year 794, the site was originally connected to the Heian Palace of that time and was used as a private garden for the Emperor. According to the records, the site originally extended approximately 400 meters from north to south and about 200 meters from east to west (500 meters and 240 meters according to different sources). In 863 a plague extended throughout the city and a sacred ritual to appease the angry spirits was held. Later, a total of 66 pikes (representing the regions of Japan of that time) were erected on the south end of the Shinsenen, Mikoshi from the Gion-jinja (today's Yasaka Shrine) were brought in and a ritual was conducted. Over the years this became a local festival and the pikes were mounted on decorated carts, which is said to be the origin of the modern day Gion Matsuri. In 1603 when Tokugawa Ieyasu built the Nij≈ç Castle, a large portion of the garden's land was absorbed by the castle grounds, reducing its size. After 1607 the garden was reconstructed and later became a Buddhist temple of the Shingon school.

Her works mostly represent abstract forms in nature, including flowers, fruits, and vegetables. She developed a silk screen technique that became her trademark.  Early Life & Education  Malle Leis was born on July 7, 1940 in the town Viljandi, Estonia, a country on the Baltic Sea across from Finland. Leis began her education at the Tartu Art School attending from 1958 to 1961 and attended the Estonian Academy of Arts (also called Art Institute of Tallinn, see Wiki for associated names in past) from 1961 to 1967. Leis graduated from the stage design department in 1967 and was able to be recognized as one of the original members of ANK '64. In 1964, a group of young artists in Tallinn formed an organization called ANK '64. Original members of ANK' 64 included students of the art institute, Malle Leis, T√µnis Vint, J√ºri Arrak, Kristiina Kaasik, T√µnis Laanemaa, Marju Mutsu, Enno Ootsing, Tiiu Pallo-Vaik, Vello Tamm, and Aili Vint. The small group aimed to hold exhibitions outside the official system, to change theoretical ideas, and to organize private seminars on modern art. Each of these goals were being neglected by the art institute, and ANK '64 worked to change that. The small group influenced many younger beginner artists. Many artists argued that ANK '64 played more of a role in artistic development than the institute would have. Over the years, ANK '64 offered various intense exhibitions, lectures, performances, and other activities to young students. With being involved in this group, Leis became very familiar with Western contemporary art. Leis preferred working in abstract in the early sixties, but eventually developed an interest in pop art towards the end of the decade.  Artwork  = Mediums = Leis typically worked with oil, watercolor, and serigraphs, establishing herself not only as a painter, but also as a printmaker. = Styles in the 1960s = Leis' was highly influenced when being part of ANK '64, and mostly worked with a abstraction in the beginning of her career, but quickly moved to pop art style by the end of the 1960s. One of her early works was Exchange, a piece using oil and watch parts on canvas, done in 1968. Leis combined a background of geometric forms with pop elements. The juxtaposition of geometry and pop show Leis' knowledge and influence from Western contemporary art. The two male heads in the painting are portraits of her husband, Villu J√µvega. = Styles in the 1970s and 1980s = Leis began to paint large and bright flowers and vegetables in the 1970s, occasionally adding in human figures or horses. Leis' 1972 painting Sunlight Triptych shows striking red poppies and yellow daffodils against a flat blue background. She was likely inspired by Andy Warhol's 1964 series, Flowers, but still has her own unique style by painting a more detailed flower. In Leis' 1977 painting The Longest Day, Leis stretches tulips across the black canvas and places a human head in the bottom corner. The flowers are larger than the head, creating a dominant presence. The colorful flowers form an idea of life and happiness, but the head in the corner has been reduced to an object, simply gazing into space with an emotionless stare. These styles continued into the early 1980s. Leis began working with watercolors and silk screening in this time as well. Leis' husband helped her to develop her silk screening process, in which she would use ten to twenty different colors in each print. Her screen printed works had oriental resemblances, possibly inspired by Japanese artist Ogata K≈çrin. Leis' screen printing technique quickly became her trademarked style.  Awards  = Order of the White Star = Leis was awarded the Order of the White Star, IV Class in 2001. The Order of the White Star was instituted in 1936 to commemorate the fight of the Estonian people for freedom. The Order of the White Star is bestowed on Estonian citizens to give recognition for services rendered in state public service or local government and on foreigners for services rendered to the Estonian state.

Wreidt, the team's coach, resigned and Nashville football was threatened with its end, but it survived for a few more years.http://www.lostcolleges.com/#!nashville-university/c1bo2 References Category:American football teams established in 1889 Category:Sports clubs disestablished in 1909 Category:1889 establishments in Tennessee Category:1909 disestablishments in Tennessee ","title":"Nashville Garnet and Blue football"},{"id":"50538795","text":"Things titled variants on Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive (a parody of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson) include: Music * Dr. Heckle and Mr. Jive (England Dan & John Ford Coley album), 1979 * Dr Heckle and Mr Jive (Pigbag album), 1982 * \\"Dr. Heckyll & Mr. Jive\\" (Men at Work song), 1982 Film * Dr. Heckyl and Mr. Hype, a 1980 film starring Oliver Reed * Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde, a 1995 film starring Sean Young * Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde, a 1971 film starring Ralph Bates * Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Mouse, a 1947 Tom and Jerry cartoon See also *Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (disambiguation) ","title":"Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive"},{"id":"50538804","title":"Jempol (federal constituency)"},{"id":"50538805","text":"Timothy Lawrence Cutler (born 23 March 1982 in Caringbah, New South Wales), is an Australian born Hong Kong cricket player and administrator.

It is unknown if the couple's two children knew their parents were embedded KGB spies living under false identities. He served as both a KGB and SVR operative until his disclosure in the United States in 2010. Biography Andrei Olegovich Bezrukov was born on 30 August 1960 in Kansk, Krasnoyarsk Krai. In 1978, he enrolled at Tomsk State University, graduating in 1983 with a degree in history. From 1978 to 1983 he studied at Tomsk State University with a degree in history, where he met his future wife. Under the assumed name of Donald Howard Heathfield, together with his wife Elena Vavilova, he lived in several nations outside of the Soviet Union for more than 20 years, engaged in illegal intelligence activities. According to his undercover identity, Heathfield was the son of a Canadian diplomat, who actually died in 1962 at the age of 7 weeks, and graduated from high school in the Czech Republic. A classmate from Harvard noted that Heathfield kept up to date regarding the lives of his classmates, including future Mexican President Felipe Calderon. From 1992 to 1995 he studied in Canada, at York University where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in international economics. From 1995 to 1997, he studied at the √âcole nationale des ponts et chauss√©es, receiving a master's degree in international business. From 1999 onwards, he lived in the United States. In 2000, he graduated from the John F. Kennedy School of Government with a master's degree in public administration. From May 2000 to May 2006 he worked as a partner in the consulting company Global Partners Inc., whose clients were well-known companies such as Alstom, Boston Scientific, General Electric and T-Mobile. From May 2006 to December 2010, he headed another consulting company, Future Map, specializing in government and corporate strategic forecasting and planning systems, which had branches in Paris and Singapore. Bezrukov was a member of the World Future Society, an organization once described by the Boston Herald as \\"a factory of thought for new technologies, at a conference of which leading experts in the field of public administration come together\\". Because of this, Heathfield was able to make numerous acquaintances. In particular, he was familiar with Leon Fuerth, a former National Security Advisor to Vice President Al Gore, and professor of management at George Washington University, William Halal, who participated in the 2008 World Future Society conference. Halal described his relationship with Heathfield as warm. \\"I came across him at meetings in federal agencies, thought factories, and the World Future Society. I do not know anything that could be of interest from a security perspective. Everything that I provided to Don was published and available via the Internet. \\" Bezrukov and his wife lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Around that time, Elena Vavilova had graduated from McGill University and, before settling in the United States, had lived in France. She worked at the Redfin real estate agency in Somerville, Massachusetts. In June 2010 he was arrested in the United States along with his wife as part of an undercover operation. On July 9, 2010, he was exchanged with four other Russian citizens, along with 9 other Russian illegal intelligence agents in Vienna. Among the exchanged was Sergei Skripal, who had been in a Russian prison for 13 years for passing information to MI6. After returning to Russia, Bezrukov and his wife were awarded the Order \\"For Merit to the Fatherland\\" 4th Class. He was also appointed adviser to the president of Rosneft, as well as an assistant professor at the Department of Applied Analysis of International Problems at MGIMO. In 2015, he published the book Russia and the World in 2020. The contours of a troubled future. After his return, he gave his first interview to the Russian Reporter magazine in 2012. He has also given several other interviews in local media. Today, he regularly leads a column in the business newspaper Izvestia on current topics. Tracey Foley Tracey Foley, (real name: Elena Stanislavovna Vavilova (–ï–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –í–∞–≤–∏–ª–æ–≤–∞); Tomsk, November 16, 1962) was Donald Heathfield's wife, and also a KGB agent. She was born in Tomsk, then part of the Soviet Union, to parents Vavilov Stanislav Platonovich and Vavilova Svetlana Konstantinovna. From 1970 to 1980, she attended a school where she learned German. In 1985, she graduated from Tomsk State University with a degree in history via a distance learning program. While studying in there, she met her future husband. After they married, they moved to Moscow to begin their training as KGB officers. Since the late 1980s, for almost 25 years she worked as a deep-cover intelligence officer in several countries under the name of Tracy Lee Ann Foley. Her husband, Andrey Bezrukov, worked with her under the assumed name of Donald Howard Heathfield. According to her undercover identity, Foley was born in Canada. While living in Toronto she gave birth to two sons: Timothy (born 1990) and Alexander (born 1994). In 1999, the family settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Elena, known as Ann Foley, worked as a real estate agent, first at Channing Real Estate and later for another real estate company ‚Å†‚Äî Redfin. On June 27, 2010, after a decade of surveillance, Foley and her husband were arrested at their Cambridge townhouse as part of an operation carried out by US surveillance agencies. They were then released to Russian authorities as part of a prisoner exchange in Vienna. Upon returning to Russia, she and her husband were given the Order \\"For Merit to the Fatherland\\" 4th Class. She currently lives in Moscow with her husband, and has since become a writer. She served as the inspiration for the main character in the TV show The Americans.  Heathfield children  The Heathfield children maintained that they never knew their parents were Russian spies and never heard them speak in Russian. At the time of their parents' arrest, they were 16 and 20 years old. Their Canadian citizenship was revoked on the grounds that the children of foreign diplomats are not entitled to citizenship even if born on Canadian soil. The younger son, Alex, appealed the decision and ultimately had his citizenship reinstated.

The site includes substantial remains of a building and is both a scheduled monument and a Grade II listed building. Traditionally, a gift of two white quartz pebbles thrown into the pool can cure mental health problems. Location St Gwenfaen's Well lies in an isolated position in a cleft in the rock in a dell overlooking the cliffs of Porth Gwalch (Welsh: Hawk Bay) in the community of Rhoscolyn in the south west of Holy Island, Anglesey. The well is just under west by south west of the village of Rhoscolyn which is the location of St Gwenfaen's Church, part of the ministry area of Holy Island (Church in Wales). As with much of Holy Island, the well lies within the area of the Glannau Ynys Gybi (Welsh: Holy Island Coast) Site of Special Scientific Interest and the Anglesey Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Description The remains of the drystone well house are east-west by (originally) north-south. Three steps descend into the building from the east into a square chamber with a flagstone floor and four diagonal stone seats in each corner. A narrow opening and steps lead into the rectangular well chamber, east-west by north-south, with recessed semi-circular seats at each side. An outer external well chamber roughly square contains the well itself, and is separated from the internal well chamber by a drystone wall, which includes a stone slab with circular grooves cut in its upper and lower edges to allow water to flow between the two chambers. The external chamber can be reached by six descending stone steps on either side cut into the cleft in the rock. At the western end a stone slab with a hole allows water to be retained in the chamber or be released into a long paved channel leading to a pool west of the well. St Gwenfaen's Well has not been accurately dated but is assumed to be medieval. The nearby church dedicated to St Gwenfaen is on the site of an older church dating from 630 AD. History and legend Gwenfaen was the daughter of Paul Hen of Manaw (who also known as Old Paulinus), and sister of Peulan and Gwyngeneu, both saints who also lived on Holy Island. She was known for healing mental illness. While being chased by druids, Gwenfaen is said to have climbed a nearby rock stack and was carried away by angels when the tide came in. An offering of two white quartz pebbles into the water of the well is said to cure mental problems. Recent history St Gwenfaen's Well was designated as a Grade II listed building in 1971 and as a scheduled monument in 1987. The well is blessed every year on, or near, Gwenfaen's Saint's day, 4 November, after Holy Communion in the nearby church. Access St Gwenfaen's Well can be reached by footpath, either by a circular route around Rhoscolyn or by following the Anglesey Coastal Path (part of the Wales Coast Path).

Biography  After attending high school in Potenza, Camardese moved to Rome to undertake higher studies. He graduated in medicine, specializing in radiology, then began professional medical practice at the Ospedale S. Filippo Neri in Rome, later working at the Policlinico Umberto I, also in Rome. He evolved his musical style through teaching himself, and in amateur performances. But in 1956, he played on the RAI Italian television talent show Primo applauso, his first television appearance, in which he won first prize. The television programme Chitarra, amore mio featured him in 1965, and he was seen again in 1973 in the music- based talk show Speciale per voi. He regularly visited two of Rome's most important jazz venues, the Music Inn and Folkstudio. Here, he joined several famous musicians in performances, including Chet Baker, Tony Scott, Joe Venuti, Lelio Luttazzi, Romano Mussolini and Irio de Paula. In 1978 he met his partner with whom he remained for 18 years. At the time, she had a three-year- old son, Roberto Angelini, who went on to become a singer and songwriter. The same year also saw Camardese's final television appearance. His shy and modest nature, together with the pressure of performing on live television, caused him to turn down further requests for such shows.  Media  Camardese's performances are poorly documented. The only widely-available film of his playing is his performance Chitarra, amore mio, rebroadcast in later years by the Italian state broadcaster RAI. In this recording, Camardese's distinctive tapping style is clearly evident, where the fingers of the right hand strike the strings on the guitar neck, creating the musical notes and other sounds.  Film  A project to document Camardese's life and work is (as of May 2016) seeking funding. Its publicity is presented by Roberto Angelini, the son of Camardese's partner.

The film is produced by S. Nanthagopal. The film features Vishal, Tamannaah, and Jagapathi Babu in the lead roles. Vadivelu, Soori and Tarun Arora play pivotal roles. The project was launched in May 2016. The film released on 23 December 2016. It was dubbed and released simultaneously in Telugu as Okkadochadu. It was dubbed into Hindi as Rowdy Rajkumar. Plot Arjun Ramakrishnan (Vishal) comes to Chennai to woo a psychology student named Divya (Tamannaah), on whom he has a crush. With the help of a local incompetent don named Deva (Soori), he succeeds in winning her heart. Divya's elder brother is Tamizhselvan (Jagapathi Babu), the honest and sincere DCP of Chennai. He approves the relationship between Arjun and his sister, and soon, their wedding is fixed. One day, Tamizhselvan is kidnapped by some goons in retaliation for his thwarting of a black money scam six months ago. Arjun rescues Tamizhselvan and takes him home, only to reveal that he is actually a CBI officer who had discovered 250 crore stashed in Tamizhselvan's house as black money. 300 crore had been seized during the black money raid, but it was publicly announced that only 50 crore had been seized. Arjun takes away all the money but does not arrest Tamizhselvan due to his public reputation, instead of telling him to personally surrender later that day. However, Tamizhselvan soon finds out that Arjun is not a CBI officer, but is a criminal who had recently been released from prison. He pursues Arjun with the aim of getting back the money. During the chase, he opens fire on Arjun's SUV, causing Arjun to lose control and meet with an accident, losing consciousness. Arjun wakes up in a hospital, having lost his memory. Tamizhselvan keeps Arjun in custody in a house, where a psychiatrist named Dr. Boothri (Vadivelu) is assigned to restore Arjun's memory so that he can reveal where he has kept the money. Unknown to anyone, Arjun had not lost his memory; he is only pretending as part of his mission to retrieve the black money. At night, he sneaks out of the house and steals the black money of a Union Minister (Jayaprakash), converting it to white money with the help of a hawala trader. However, Tamizhselvan and the Union Minister soon find out that Arjun had not lost his memory and has stolen even more of the black money. Arjun, confronted by Tamizhselvan and the Union Minister, reveals his motive for stealing the black money. Arjun is from Manimangalam, a remote village with no basic amenities like roads, water, high schools, and even proper housing and sanitation facilities. When the building of the only primary school in the village collapsed, he confronted the local MLA Sivagnanam (Thennavan), who had falsely claimed to have developed the village, instead pocketing all the money which was to be used for developing Manimangalam. Sivagnanam rudely sent him away, defending his corruption and even declaring that he would never develop the village. Following this, Arjun approached the Union Minister, who also turned out to be corrupt like Sivagnanam. Arjun's friends confront Sivagnanam and his men, who kill them all. It is at this stage that Arjun had decided to get back all the black money acquired by Sivagnanam (which was the 300 crore recovered earlier in the film) and the Union Minister and use it to develop Manimangalam. Arjun takes Tamizhselvan, the Union Minister and Divya to Manimangalam, which is now a very well developed village. He reveals that he had used the money hoarded by the Union Minister along with Sivagnanam's 300 crore to develop the village and had given the credit to him, because of which the villagers now hold the Union Minister in high regard. Tamizhselvan drops all charges against Arjun, seeing that he had stolen the money which was black for good intentions and arrests the Union Minister. In the credits, it is revealed that Divya and Tamizhselvan involve themselves in Manimangalam's development, along with Arjun.

The IBA was consequently established at the 1992 International Bamboo Congress in Japan. Through 1998 the IBA had been the coordinating platform for bamboo people around the world, with its primary responsibility being the International Bamboo Congress & International Bamboo Workshop. A union of these two distinct gatherings is today called the World Bamboo Congress, and has led to the rebirth of the IBA into the World Bamboo Organization. The WBO was legally formed as a U.S. tax-exempt trade association in 2005 by CEO Susanne Lucas. She currently holds the position of Executive Director, WBO Ambassador and is the author of Bamboo. Kamesh Salam (Assam, India) served as President 2007-2009. Michel Abadie (Paris, France) served his first term as President from 2010-2012, and was reappointed a second term in 2013 and has continued his role to the present. The founding members of the WBO are Susanne Lucas(USA), I.V. Ramanuja Rao (India), Karina Quintans (USA), David Flanagan (USA), Carmelita Bersalona (Philippines), Amin Samuel Zacca (Ghana), Jorge Campos (Chile), Victor Brias (Belgium). An Honorary Council was established in 2005 to support WBO with professional consultation and expertise. The Honorary Council evolved and was renamed to better reflect the horizontal structure of its collaborations in the name of bamboo; who are now collectively called World Bamboo Ambassadors  World Bamboo Congress  Every 3-4 years the WBO organizes a World Bamboo Congress (WBC). In the last 20 years, the WBC as a series of Sessions & Demonstrations has attracted around 400 participants from more than 30 countries around the world, including world-renowned experts in bamboo design, construction, and architecture. The aim of the WBC is to promote best practices in supply chain management for bamboo in order to protect natural resources and the environment, to ensure sustainable utilization, as well as promote traditional uses locally and for community economic development. Additionally, the WBC promotes new cultivation of bamboo for new industries such as bio-energy, bio- plastics, climate mitigation, housing materials, pulp, paper, textiles, nutrition and medicine. The most recent WBC took place in Damyang, Korea in 2015 during the World Bamboo Fair, hosted by the municipality of Damyang, a location considered to be a significant bamboo habitat in Korea. The World Bamboo Fair attracted several hundred thousand visitors during the months of September and October, with its motto, ‚ÄúBamboo for a Greener Future‚Äù, the fair encouraged the exchange of ideas and educated the public on bamboo's many uses.  World Bamboo Day  World Bamboo Day was officially established on September 18 at the 8th World Bamboo Congress held in Bangkok in 2009 and declared by the Thai Royal Forest Department. People and businesses from around the world use this day to raise awareness of the benefits of bamboo and to promote its use in everyday products. On this day each year, its celebration has included bamboo planting ceremonies, 5K races, various contests and other kinds of celebrations around the world.  United Nations Global Compact and the SDGs  In January 2016, World Bamboo Organization joined the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the world's largest sustainability initiative. WBO accepted Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's) upholding the aims of the UNGC.  WBO Ambassadors  A group of people from many countries around the world have united to become World Bamboo Ambassadors. Among the ambassadors, Dr. Chongtham Nirmala is a professor of botany at Panjab University where she mainly focuses in nutritive value and phytochemicals research regarding bamboo shoots, as an ambassador she promotes bamboo use as wood and food. Ambassadors mainly find biological value to bamboo and some economically assist their surroundings with its use.

It is named after Kasim Pasha (). The mosque was built by Kasim Pasha in 1478‚Äì1479, the Beylerbey of the Rumelia Eyalet in the Ottoman Empire and a commander of the Ottoman forces during the reign of the sultans Mehmed the Conqueror (r. 1444‚Äí1446, 1451‚Äí1481) and Bayezid II (r. 1481‚Äì1512); he was also titled \\"Evliya\\", saint. The grave of Kasim Pasha is in the mosque's yard. Architecture The mosque is situated in the Kiri≈ühane quarter on the north bank of the Tunca River to the south of the city of Edirne. A masonry staircase with 14 steps was built to enable access to the mosque from the river, but this now has only two steps remaining. Constructed in ashlar, the building with square plan has one dome and one minaret. The fa√ßade is directed to the north. Here is the main gate and an outer mihrab flanked by rwo windows. Above the main gate, a construction inscription with a three-line text in Ottoman language, is attached. On each of the other three sides of the building, there are four windows, two in line. The lower windows, in rectangular form, are placed inside niches, and have arched gables. Each gable features a carved small five-pointed star. The upper windows are arched, and in the middle of the west wall, a sundial is found. Status The mosque has not been in use since 1950 due to its location. It is separated from the city by an artificial levee, which was built to protect the city from flooding by the river, and lack of congregation. Periodically, flooding does further damage to the historic building. In the 2010s, the province governor of Edirne initiated efforts to save the mosque from future ruin. The two projects, to relocate the levee passing between the mosque and the river, or to completely move the mosque to a safe place, have been rejected by the related public bodies so far.

He is known as an advocate and apologist for slavery. Life He was born in London, the son of James Tobin Sr. of Nevis, identified tentatively in the ODNB with the sea captain James Tobin (1698‚Äì1770), as given in Caribbeana. Educated at Westminster School, he took articles as a solicitor. After a period in Nevis, he returned in 1784 to Bristol. He was in business there, with John Pretor Pinney, and advocated for the planters' view of slavery. He was a member of the Bristol West India Association. Tobin travelled first to Nevis in 1758, to work in the family plantation business, at Stoney Grove Estate. From 1760 to 1782 he was there at least three times. He went back there in 1808. In 1817, the year of his death, there were 213 enslaved people on the Stoney Grove plantation. In the end Tobin quarrelled with the Pinney family. He died in Bristol, on 6 October 1817. Works Tobin was one of a group of writers who defended the existing institution of slavery, based on experience in the Caribbean, that included also Samuel Estwick, Edward Long, Richard Nisbet who published Slavery not Forbidden by Scripture (1773), and Philip Thicknesse. He was drawn into controversy by the views of James Ramsay, expressed in An Essay on the Treatment and Conversion of African Slaves in the British Sugar Colonies of 1784; and published a number of works: *Cursory Remarks upon the Reverend Mr. Ramsay's Essay on the Treatment and Conversion of African Slaves in the Sugar Colonies (1785). Tobin deployed arguments including the deprivations found in English rural life, compared to an idealised West Indian plantation drawing on the novels of Henry Mackenzie and Sarah Scott. He cited the pro-slavery work of Rev. Robert Robertson from earlier in the century, and followed racial purity arguments from Long. * Short Rejoinder to the Reverend Mr. Ramsay's Reply (1787). Tobin pointed out the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts as owner of a Barbados sugar plantation that used slave labour. Tobin was addressed personally by Ramsay in A Letter to James Tobin, Esq., late member of His Majesty's Council in the island of Nevis (1787). He replied in: *A Farewel Address to the Rev. Mr. James Ramsay (1788) The 1786 Essay on Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species by Thomas Clarkson deals with Tobin as the \\"Cursory Remarker\\". In 1787, Ottobah Cugoano responded to a number of authors defending enslavement, including Tobin, in Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil and Wicked Traffic of the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species. Olaudah Equiano replied to Tobin in 1788, in The Public Advertiser, attacking two of his pamphlets, and also a related book from 1786 by Gordon Turnbull. Hector Macneill wrote positively about Tobin's Cursory Remarks in his Observations on the Treatment of the Negroes in Jamaica (1788). In February 1790 Tobin gave evidence to a parliamentary committee on the slave trade. A later work was A Plain Man's Thoughts on the present Price of Sugar (1792). In that year a bill to abolish the slave trade was defeated in the House of Commons. Family Tobin married in 1766 Elizabeth Webbe, daughter of George Webbe, a Nevis planter. Living until 1777 in Salisbury, they had eight children: James Webbe, George, Henry Hope, John, Elizabeth, Charles Meadows, Joseph Webbe, and Frances. Elizabeth married John Cobham of Barbados, and Frances Robert Bush of Clifton. In a marriage of first cousins, George Webbe Tobin, son of George, married Susannah Cobham, daughter of Elizabeth.

The shiptime use is divided between the main users, the University of Troms√∏ (50%), Norwegian Polar Institute (30%) and Norwegian Institute of Marine Research (20%). She was built at Fincantieri shipyard in Genova, Italy, and delivered in 2018.  Technical details  With a length of , beam of and draft of , Kronprins Haakon is the largest Norwegian icebreaker ever built despite being slightly shorter than Svalbard, the 6,375-ton icebreaking offshore patrol vessel operated by the Norwegian Coast Guard. The research vessel has accommodation for 55 personnel in 38 cabins, including a crew of 15‚Äì17. She is equipped with hangar for two small to medium-sized helicopters, but the helipad in the bow is strengthened also for the heavier helicopters such as NHIndustries NH90 operated by the Norwegian Coast Guard and Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma search and rescue (SAR) helicopters based in Svalbard. Like most modern icebreakers, Kronprins Haakon has a diesel-electric propulsion system. Her power plant consists of two 3,500kW six-cylinder Bergen B32:40L6 and two 5,000kW 9-cylinder Bergen B32:40L9 medium-speed diesel engines that produce power for two 5.5MW Rolls- Royce US ARC 0.8 FP azimuth thrusters and two 1.1MW bow thrusters. The propulsion system also gives her Dynamic Positioning (DP) Class 1 stationkeeping capability.New Norwegian ice going Research Vessel Kronprins Haakon. Norwegian Polar Institute, 2015. In open water, she has a maximum cruising range of and endurance of 65 days at cruising speed. The bollard pull of the vessel is 158 tonnes. The hull of Kronprins Haakon is strengthened according to International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) Unified Requirements for Polar Class Ships for operations in winter ice with pressure ridges, multi-year ice and glacial ice inclusions. Her ice class, Polar Class 3, is intended for vessels designed for \\"year-round operation in second-year ice which may include multi-year ice inclusions\\". During full- scale ice trials north of Svalbard, Kronprins Haakon was found out to be capable of breaking ice with a snow layer at a continuous speed of at full propulsion power, slightly exceeding her contractual requirements. Ridges up to in thickness were successfully broken by ramming. A high-end research vessel, Kronprins Haakon has an extensive scientific outfit for oceanography, marine biology and geology. The main deck is largely dedicated to scientific activities with 15 fixed and three container laboratories, refrigerated storage rooms, large working deck with cranes and an A-frame for trawling, and a hangar and moon pool for sampling as well as AUV and ROV operations.

In July 2019, one of Kronprins Haakons propulsion units developed a lubricating oil leak during icebreaking operations north of Svalbard, forcing the research vessel to cancel a scientific cruise ahead of schedule and return to Norway for repairs. During inspection in Harstad, the cause of the leak was discovered to be a loose bolt in the port side propeller shaft seal. There were no visible signs of damage and the repairs consisted of tightening the bolts in both port and starboard propulsion units and securing them with thread-locking fluid.

From 1958 to 1964, he was director of Aerofototeca for the Italian Ministry of Public Education, he was a professor of Etruscology, Italian antiquities, and the topography of ancient Italy at the University of Lecce. At the same university, he was also director of the Institute of Archaeology, of the Department of Scholarship on Antiquity, and of the school of classical and medieval archaeology. As a civil servant, in charge of the of Basilicata and Apulia, he was notable for his protection of the archaeological sites within the territory under his control, for the creation of a national network of museums, and for advocating the display of archaeological discoveries near the location of their original discovery.  Biography  The fifth of ten sons of a priest of the Romanian Orthodox Church, Adame»ôteanu received an education similar to that of his siblings:Liliana Giardino, Omaggio a Dinu Adame»ôteanu his brother, the veterinarian Ion Adame»ôteanu was one of the founders of the Romanian veterinary school. His niece, Gabriela Adame»ôteanu (b. 1942), daughter of Mircea (third of the ten brothers) is a noted Romanian author. He attended primary school in his native village, followed by the central seminary and Saint Sava National College in Bucharest. From 1933 to 1938, he studied at the University of Bucharest's literature faculty, where one of his professors was Victor Papacostea.Marius Porumb, \\"Dinu Adame»ôteanu\\", in Transylvanian Review', vol.

Storia = Career in Italy= Adame»ôteanu relocated from Romania to Italy in 1939, where he was a member (1940-1942) and then librarian (1943-1946) of the Romanian School in Rome. In Rome he received a degree along with Gaetano De Sanctis and began a long friendship with the numismatist Attilio Stazio. The outbreak of the Second World War and the institution of a communist regime in Romania after the war had a dramatic impact on his life. With the loss of his Romanian citizenship, he became a stateless refugee. At this time he first met Mario Napoli (like him a future archaeologist), whom he met at the refugee camp in Bagnoli.  Sicily  At the end of 1949, in a semi-clandestine fashion on account of his statelessness, Adame»ôteanu was able to continue his research activities, thanks only to the support and assistance of his friends and colleagues, who asked him to participate in archaeological research in Sicily. Professor Luigi Bernab√≤ Brea, archaeological superintendent for the province of Syracuse, invited him to participate in the exploration of the sites of Syracuse and Leontini. At the latter site, a series of soundages allowed them to identify and then bring to light the city's fortifications, with twenty metre thick walls on the hill of San Mauro which culminated in the south with the \\"Syracusan Gate,\\" mentioned by Polybius, which was also excavated at this time. In Sicily, at the invitation of Piero Griffo, superintendent of Agrigento, Adame»ôteanu directed the excavation of Butera and Gela, where he collaborated closely with Pietro Orlandini, between 1951 and 1961, advancing research of ancient Sicilian forticiations in particular. In this period, Adame»ôteanu adopted a theme which had already been advocated passionately by Vasile P√¢rvan, who had emphasised the imporance of interaction between Greek colonists and indigenous populations in his Getica; this would subsequently become a major focus of historical and archaeological research He published the results of his research in Sicily, together with Orlandini, in three volumes dedicated to the fortifications of Gela and to the ancient territory of the city, in the Accademia dei Lincei's Notizie degli Scavi, and in other journals, including Revue Archeologique, Archeologia Classica, and Bollettino d'Arte.  Aerial survey and Aerofototeca at the Ministry of Public Education  Adame»ôteanu, pioneer of aerial archaeology, during a helicopter survey in 1966 In this period, Adame»ôteanu continued his pioneering use of aerial survey. His attentive and patient comparison between surface and aerial photographic evidence allowed him to identify \\"a large number of ancient sites, some known only through literary sources and some otherwise entirely unknown. He also deployed these techniques for the study of ancient urban and rural structures of Spina and its hinterland in the Po delta. But even more important was his use of aerial photographic techniques for the protection of archaeological sites: he used it to identify areas where large scale construction projects impacted on sites of archaeological interest. He worked to promote the potential offered by the integration of aerial photography into traditional archaeological research, through demonstrations in Italy and abroad. Owing to his personal qualities and achievements, he received Italian citizenship for scientific merit in 1954. In 1958 he was entrusted with the creation of Aerofototeca, a subdivision of the National Photographic Office of the Ministry of Public Education, which he directed from 1959 to 1990. This institute, the only one of its kind in Europe or America, collected aerial photographs, plans and stereocopic photographs of Italian territory taken during the Second World War by the Regia Aeronautica, the United States Army Air Forces, the Royal Air Force and the German Luftwaffe, and used them for the reconstruction of ancient topography. These images were supplemented by the activities of the Istituto Geografico Militare and of the Florentine .Sito ufficiale dell'Aerofototeca  Soprintendente in Basilicata and Puglia  In 1964, Adame»ôteanu was posted to Potenza in Lucania with his appointment as the head of the newly created archaeological sovrintendenza of Basilicata. He was involved in excavations during this period at Metapontum, Policoro, Matera, Melfi, and Heraclea Lucania, either personally or in a supporting capacity. The results of the work carried out by him along the coast of the Ionian Sea in collaboration with an international team of archaeologists, was published in the work, La Basilicata Antica. After this, for the few months between the end of 1977 and April 1978, he had a brief stint as archaeological sovrintendente of Apulia, where he worked to protect some Messapian sites. From 1971 to 1983, Adame»ôteanu was also a professor of Etruscology, Italian antiquities, and the topography of ancient Italy at the University of Lecce. He was also director of the Institute of Archaeology, of the Department of Scholarship on Antiquity, and of the school of classical and medieval archaeology at the same university.  Museum advocacy  One of Dinu Adame»ôteanu's main preoccupations was the creation, maintenance and development of museums located near archaeological sites. This had positive results for a large number of regional museums: at Metaponto, for example, his intervention in the local \\"Antiquarium\\" led to its transformation into a , the ; at Policoro, his advocacy laid the foundations for a new museum, which also achieved national status, the . At Melfi, the was established inside the Norman castle.  Academic affiliations and honours  Dinu Adame»ôteanu was a member of a large number of academic organisations.

She joined the Communist Party in 1923 and much of her published work is strongly polemical. Sources identify her under several different names. Between her marriage to Louis Jacobsohn in 1901 and 1917 she used, for some purposes, the name Berta Jacobsohn. After the death of both her brothers in law, the couple changed their name to Jacobsohn-Lask. She also wrote under the pseudonym \\"Gerhard Wieland\\". Life =Provenance and early years= Berta Lask was born into a prosperous Jewish family in Wadowitz, a small industrialising town at that time in Galicia, and a short distance to the southwest of Krak√≥w. She was the third of her parents' four recorded children. Her parents had grown up in the north of Germany, and despite living in Austria-Hungary still held Prussian nationality. Her father, Leopold Lask (1841‚Äì1905), owned a paper factory in Falkenberg, far to the north. Her mother, Cerline Lask (?-1921) was a teacher. The elder of her brothers, Emil Lask (1875‚Äì1915), would achieve eminence as a neo-Kantian philosopher. In 1885 the family moved to Falkenberg in Brandenburg. Berta Lask attended primary school in Berlin and a secondary school (Gymnasium) in Bad Freienwalde, a short distance to the northeast of the capital. Her mother was dismissive of her wish progress with her education, and it was partly as a reaction against her mother's attitudes that Berta first made contact with political feminism. Through her brother Emil, three years her senior, she also came into contact with other intellectual currents of the time. In her late teens she began her first forays into serious writing. It was also during this period, in 1894/95, that she studied in Berlin with Helene Lange who was already gaining a reputation as a leading advocate of women's rights. In 1901 Berta Lask married Louis Jacobsohn (1863‚Äì1940), a neurologist and histologist who was teaching at Berlin's Frederick-William University (as it was known at the time). During the next few years they had four recorded children. In 1912 her first unpublished stage work appeared under the title \\"Auf dem Hinterhof, vier Treppen links\\" (\\"In the backyard, four steps to the left\\"). =War= Both her brothers were killed in the First World War. Through her husband's work as a doctor Lask became increasingly radicalised, which formed the context for her activism in the women's movement and later her support for the October Revolution in Leningrad in 1917 and the November Revolution in Berlin in 1918. After the war, between 1919 and 1921 she entitled two volumes of poetry reflective of the war experience and the deaths of her own brothers entitled \\"Stimmen\\" (\\"Voices\\") and \\"Rufe aus dem Dunkel\\" (\\"Calls out of the dark\\"). Along with her poetry, she published articles for \\"The Red Flag\\" (\\"Die Rote Fahne\\") and other less high-profile revolutionary newspapers. In 1923 she joined the recently established Communist Party in Berlin. She provided material for the party's Agitation and Propaganda group. Her output included the chorus \\"The call of the dead - speaking chorus to commemorate Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg\\" (\\"Die Toten rufen - Sprechchor zum Gedenken an Karl Liebknecht und Rosa Luxemburg\\"), the stage pieces \\"Leuna 1921\\" (which appeared in 1927) and \\"Thomas M√ºntzer\\", and children's books such as \\"Through Time on the Flying Horse\\" (\\"Auf dem Fl√ºgelpferde durch die Zeiten\\") and \\"How Franz and Greta traveled to Russia\\" (\\"Wie Franz und Grete nach Russland reisten\\"). She had made her own first visit to Russia in 1925. =Weimar years= During the Weimar period Berta Lask found herself before the judges charges with high treason several times. Her published plays were confiscated and performances of them banned. Her works also featured in trials launched against communist book sellers. In 1927, however, the cases against her failed. Along with Johannes R. Becher, Frida Rubiner, Franz Carl Weiskopf and others she was a member of the planning committee and a founder member of the Association of Proletarian-Revolutionary Authors (\\"Bund proletarisch- revolution√§rer Schriftsteller\\" / BPRS) which they launched on 19 October 1928, with Lask becoming deputy secretary to the national executive in 1932. She was also a member of the Protection League of German authors (\\"Schutzverband deutscher Schriftsteller\\" / SDS). Her work by now was chiefly restricted to journalism. =Nazi years and Soviet exile= The Nazis took power in January 1933 and lost little time in converting the German state into a one-party dictatorship. Political activity (unless in support of the Nazi party) became illegal. Berta Lask was arrested and held in \\"protective custody\\" between March and June. After that, probably in August 1933 (though sources differ as to the precise dates) she emigrated via Czechoslovakia to the Soviet Union. She lived in Moscow at least till 1936, by which time all three of her sons and her husband had relocated from Nazi Germany to the Soviet Union. Her husband, who had been semi-retired even before the Nazi take-over, and had never involved himself in his wife's political activities (but was nevertheless professionally marginalised and in increasing danger because he was Jewish) arrived, using a tourist visa, only at the start of 1936, accompanied by her daughter in law, Dora and her baby grand daughter, Franziska. In Moscow Berta Lask worked as a journalist. Moscow, like Paris, had welcomed large numbers of refugees from Nazi Germany, forced to flee because of their politics, their race, or both. There were several German language news publications following the Communist Party line, notably the Deutsche Zentral-Zeitung, published in Moscow by the German language section of the Comintern, and to which Lask contributed. She was also writing for \\"Zwei Welten\\" and for \\"Internationale Literatur\\" and contributing material to Radio Moscow. She published several books under the pseudonym \\"Gerhard Wieland\\". It has been suggested that she used a pseudonym partly in order to protect her sons and her husband all of whom had initially remained in Germany when Berta had fled. At some point after 1936 Louis and Berta left Moscow and settled at Sevastopol in Crimea where the authorities were happy for Louis to continue his work as a physician until his death in May 1940. Berta Lask was deprived of her German citizenship by the government in 1938. She received Soviet citizenship in 1940. Unlike their father, all three of the Lasks' sons had joined the German Communist Party by 1933. Of the three of them, the youngest, Ernst, stayed for a time in Berlin working \\"underground\\" for the Communist Party (which was now illegal). He was assigned to the party's \\"anti- militarist\\" department which was in effect a cover name for the German Communist Party's news service. He then fled, following his mother to Moscow, where he worked first for the Agriculture Institute and then for the International Economics and Politics Institute. However, at the end of June 1936, a month after his thirtieth birthday, Ernst died of tuberculosis in the First University Clinic in Moscow hospital. The other two, Hermann and Ludwig, were arrested in 1938, when the political purges in Moscow were still at their height. The middle son, Hermann, was banned to Arkhangelsk in the north where he lived with his widowed mother between 1941 and 1944. He was eventually transferred to the Soviet \\"Labor army\\", and returned to what remained in Germany in 1948. The eldest son is sometimes identified in sources as Ludwig and sometimes as Lutz. Lutz, who had a degree in human economics (\\"Volkswirtschaft\\"), was working at the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute in Moscow when he was arrested. His detention included eight years in a camp at Kolyma in the Far East. Like his brother Hermann, he survived his time in the Soviet Union, but he was only permitted to return to Germany in 1953. After Lutz was arrested, his wife, Dora, keen to avoid getting caught up in Stalin's latest purge, left Moscow with their daughter Franziska. They crossed Europe and arrived in England towards the end of the summer of 1939. Having avoided imprisonment by the Soviets, in London Dora was identified as an enemy alien and imprisoned in Holloway jail, and then \\"interned\\" on the Isle of Man. By the end of the war she had been released, and lived in England for the rest of her life: she died from kidney disease in 1952, the year before the Soviets were finally persuaded to release her husband. According to some sources, Berta Lask tried to return to Moscow from Arkhangelsk during the war in order to contribute to the struggle against Nazi Germany. In the end she appears to have returned to Moscow around the end of the war, possibly when her son was transferred from Arkhangelsk to the Soviet \\"Labor army\\". She then remained in Moscow till 1953. When she returned to the part of Germany which by this time had become the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), she was accompanied by her newly freed son, Lutz. =German Democratic Republic= Berta Lask lived her final years in East Berlin where she continued to write and was able to finish the semi-autobiographical novel on which she had started work in 1938. It was published as \\"Stille und Sturm\\" in 1955. In 1958 she was honoured officially with the Patriotic Order of Merit in silver. The equivalent award in gold followed in 1963.Neues Deutschland, 6 October 1963, p. 1 She was a member of the East German literary elite, and the country's powerful Party Central Committee offered public condolences when she died on 28 March 1967.

She was most known for her still lifes and street scenes. Her painting Christopher Street, Greenwich Village was selected for the White House by President Franklin Roosevelt and is now in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. She won national competitions to complete post office murals for the post offices in Indianola and Columbus, Mississippi. Biography Beulah Ruth was born on August 22, 1894, in St. Louis, Missouri to James B. and Ella Ruth. She studied at the Art Students League of New York with George Bellows and John Sloan and later studied under John Carroll, Frank V. DuMond and Charles Hawthorne. On April 18, 1917, in Manhattan, New York, Ruth married the illustrator Howard Bettersworth. Career Christopher Street, Greenwich Village (1934) Not much has been written of her early career, but it is known that Bettersworth did some artwork for advertising in the 1920s. She was exhibiting paintings in New York in the early 1930s and lived on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village. In 1933, she began the year in January with a one-woman show at the Artists Gallery in the Tower Hotel in New York City and in October she exhibited portraits in an exhibition at the same venue. Though not known as a portrait painter, her works were well received. In 1934, her black and white works, predominantly still lifes were shown in the Art Gallery of the Tower Hotel along with several artists from the Brooklyn Painters and Sculptors' Group. Her work in these shows was given attention and earned Bettersworth invitations to show works at the Corcoran Gallery of Art and the Museum of Modern Art. Her painting, \\"Christopher Street, Greenwich Village\\" (1934) was chosen by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to hang in the White House, when he saw it on exhibit at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. By 1936, she and Howard were living in the artists' colony in Woodstock, New York, where Beulah participated in exhibits. Betterworth was selected to complete two murals for the WPA Section of Painting and Sculpture. \\"White Gold in the Delta\\" (1939) for the post office at Indianola, Mississippi and \\"Out of the Soil\\" for the post office at Columbus, Mississippi, both depict cotton harvesting scenes and did not shy away from depicting white foremen and black laborers. Bettersworth was not the original artist commissioned to complete the work in Indianola, but when Walter Anderson was unable to complete the mural, she was selected. Both at the time they were installed and at present, there have been complaints that the murals depict racist themes and should be removed. The Indianola mural was destroyed and though the argument over whether the Columbus mural should be removed or remain, as it accurately reflects history, is unsettled, the mural is still in place. In 1947, the Betterworths sold their home in Woodstock and by the early 1950s they were living in Tucson, Arizona, where Howard was working as an art director for the Cabat-Gill Advertising Agency. Erni Cabat and Norval Gill, another WPA artist, had founded the agency in the late 1940s. Bettersworth died in Tucson on August 3, 1968, and was buried in Tucson Memorial Park Cemetery. Legacy Bettersworth had works shown at the Corcoran Gallery of Art and the Museum of Modern Art. Her painting \\"Christopher Street, Greenwich Village\\" is in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

It was released for Microsoft Windows and iOS by Novectacle in 2012 and 2014 in Japan, and for Microsoft Windows by MangaGamer in 2016 internationally. Additionally, a Nintendo 3DS version was released by FuRyu in 2016, and a PlayStation Vita version was released by Dramatic Create in 2017, both exclusive to Japan. Another PlayStation Vita version, as well as a PlayStation 4 version, were released in North America by Limited Run Games in 2019. A Nintendo Switch version of the game has been announced for release at an unknown date. The House in Fata Morgana is a visual novel set in a mansion, where the player character wakes up with amnesia. They meet a Maid in the mansion, and the two visit the mansion in different time periods ‚Äì 1603, 1707, 1869 and 1099 ‚Äì to learn what has happened to its residents in the past, and to try to get the player character to regain their lost memories.  Plot An amnesiac spirit wakes inside an old mansion. They are greeted by a Maid, who attempts to help them recover their memories by exploring the mansion's past; in the hope that they will recognize themself in a past life. She first takes them to 1603, where the mansion is inhabited by young aristocrat siblings Mell and Nellie Rhodes. One night a mysterious White-Haired Girl with pale skin and red eyes arrives at the mansion; Mell catches her speaking to the Maid (who also lives in this time and appears no different) and is instantly smitten. The White-Haired Girl reveals to Mell that her father was a painter for the household but was kicked out and died in the streets. Mell apologizes for his family's actions, and the two begin a relationship. Nellie is driven mad with jealousy and discovers that the painter had slept with her and Mell's mother, resulting in the White-Haired Girl's birth and his expulsion. Nellie reveal this to Mell, as well as her own romantic feelings for him, causing him great grief. The Maid next takes the spirit to 1707, where the mansion has become abandoned and destitute, though it is now in a different location than in 1603. The Maid, the mansion's only inhabitant, one day discovers Yukimasa, an amnesiac man, in the cellar. However, due to his amnesia as well as abuse he received due to his race and inability to communicate, he came to visualize himself as a savage beast, calling himself \\"Bestia\\". While the Maid initially tries to civilize him, he murders the multiple villagers that come to the mansion in retaliation for his abuse. Some time later, the White-Haired Girl appears at his doorstep; while she is a reincarnation of her previous self from 1603, she retains hazy memories of her past life. Yukimasa attempts to kill her, but her lack of fear (which he believes is fueled by her blindness) stupefies him, and the two become friends. Meanwhile, Yukimasa's lover Pauline is searching for him, as she was told he was lost at sea. She gradually befriends Javi, a standoffish young boy whose parents were killed by Yukimasa. The two travel to the mansion, where Pauline finds Yukimasa. Yukimasa flees from Pauline, whom he sees as another Bestia. Pauline chases him into the manor, and in his confusion he kills her. Some time after, Javi rallies the villagers to attack the mansion, resulting in the White-Haired Girl's death. Yukimasa finally succumbs to being nothing more than a beast, slaughtering all of the villagers. The spirit is then lead by the Maid to 1869. In this time the house is owned by young, greedy businessman Jacopo, and the house has moved to America. He lives with his new wife, the White-Haired Girl, as well as a multitude of servants, including the Maid and his childhood friend Maria. Jacopo, believing his wife to be wooing other men, locks her in a small exterior cottage. The White-Haired Girl frequently writes love letters to Jacopo; however, Maria secretly wishes to destroy the two's relationship, so she alters the recipient names on the letters to address them to other men. Jacopo eventually decides to release his wife, but when he comes to her cottage he finds that she had given up hope and fled. Finally realizing the truth, Jacopo confronts Maria, who reveals her hatred towards him. She shoots Jacopo, wounding him, but Jacopo shoots Maria between the eyes, killing her. Jacopo spends the rest of his life unsuccessfully searching for the White- Haired Girl. Briefly separated from the Maid, the spirit encounters a talking painting which shows him a memory of an unknown black-haired woman. Shortly after, the spirit is found by the Maid, who takes it to 1099. In this era the White-Haired Girl flees to the mansion from a village that persecuted her for her appearance. She meets Michel, a mysterious hermit who has the power to drain the life from anything he touches. The two fall in love, with the White- Haired Girl revealing her name as Giselle. A bandit attacks the mansion, forcing Michel to drain some of his life. The man escapes, but before he dies he tells the village of Michel and Giselle. Having been cut, some of Michel's blood spills onto Giselle, which appears to cause her health to deteriorate. The villagers attack the manor, forcing the two to flee into the observation tower. Believing they have no chance of escape, the two embrace, causing Giselle to fall limp. Michel confronts the villagers and they skewer him, but his blood dripping from his corpse down the stairs kills all of the villagers. Giselle awakens, Michel's curse having not affected her after all. As she grieves for Michel, she is approached by the Maid, who reveals herself to be a witch named Morgana. Morgana offers her the option to be reincarnated so that she may one day reunite with Michel's reincarnation, which Giselle accepts. The spirit finally recalls its past identity as Michel, and the Maid explains that the White-Haired Girl had been Giselle's reincarnations. Michel, however, remembers the black-haired woman from his earlier vision and believes what he witnessed to have been falsified. He claims that the Maid is in fact Giselle and demands to see the truth, which the Maid reluctantly agrees to. In reality, Giselle was not the White-Haired Girl; instead, she was a young black-haired woman in need of money for her family. She accepted work at the wealthy Bollinger estate but was repeatedly raped by the Bollinger patriarch, Antonin, scarring her physically and emotionally. When Antonin's wife discovered this, Giselle was to be executed, but instead Antonin had her banished to the mansion where Michel, their son, lived. Giselle cheerfully introduces herself to Michel, but Michel is cold and curt to her, keeping contact between the two minimal. When Giselle enters Michel's room one night, he discovers her and accuses her of being a thief; Giselle flees in terror and passes out in the woods. She is brought to a nearby village where the villagers claim Giselle had stolen money and torture her until she reveals where it is. Out of desperation, Giselle leads the villagers to the mansion so that they may loot it. Michel steps outside, revealing his pale skin, white hair and red eyes. He scares the villagers away and accuses Giselle once more of being a thief. Giselle, fed up with nobody believing her, begs Michel to kill her, baffling him. She reveals that Michel's father had raped her, causing Michel to feel guilty for his accusations and for his father's actions, and the two begin their relationship anew. Over the course of a year, the two become incredibly close, eventually coming to realize that they love one another. Michel receives news that his father has died; after sending a letter to his mother, knights arrive and attack the manor. The two flee to the observation tower, but Michel leaves Giselle trapped in the top room while he confronts and is killed by the knights, his corpse being dragged away. Giselle is spoken to by a disembodied voice which calls herself the Witch, Morgana. Morgana explains that while she is unable to bring Michel back to life with all of his memories intact, she can have him be physically reincarnated. Morgana curses Giselle's body so that she no longer ages, effectively rendering her dead. Giselle waits in solitude for Michel's reincarnation to arrive for hundreds of years, eventually donning the garb of the Maid per Morgana's recommendation. Eventually Mell and his family move into the house, and later the White-Haired Girl arrives. With her memories hazy, Giselle believes the White-Haired Girl, her actual name being Michelle, to be Michel's reincarnation, but Michelle has no memories of her. Giselle becomes emotionally numb, watching the tragedies of the mansion unfold with little reaction. Michelle's continual reincarnations only serve to torture Giselle further, until Morgana convinces her that she's always been the Maid and that her past memories with Michel aren't real. The Maid, having regained her memories and original personality as Giselle, is suddenly dragged away by Morgana into the observation tower. Michel is instructed by the talking painting to convince the spirits of Mell, Yukimasa and Jacopo, all of whom are also trapped in the mansion, to give him three keys needed to ascend the observation tower. As he climbs, Morgana reveals her past. As a child her blood was believed to have healing qualities, so she freely gave it to the needy. Her mother sold her to a local lord who mutilated her body to extract blood. She was freed in a slave uprising and brought to a brothel where she was cared for, but bandits invaded and abducted Morgana. One of her fellow captives, a swordsman, managed to break free and kill their captors, but in his frenzy he slaughtered his fellow captives except for Morgana. Morgana made her way to a cottage and lived there for three years, until a boy came to her requesting she heal his sick sister. She willingly gave him blood multiple times, until he came to the cottage with the swordsman who severed her arm. She was captured and brought back to the lord, who kept her imprisoned in an observation tower where her blood would be sold through the church below. Though Morgana eventually died from her wounds and weakened state, her spirit lingered on, wishing to curse the three men who had caused her to suffer. Michel makes his way to the top of the tower and finds an illusion of Giselle, who calls him disgusting and claims that he is actually a woman. Michel, known as a child as \\"Michelle\\", was born intersex and was originally thought to be female. Growing up he felt conflicted about society's expectations of him as a woman, preferring the masculine activities of his brothers Didier, a knight, and Georges, an artist. In 1086 his voice deepened and his body became masculine. Feeling at peace with himself for the first time, Michelle renamed himself \\"Michel\\" and claimed himself to have always been male. However, his mother, adoring him as her only daughter, considered him cursed and had him locked in his room until he could be \\"cured\\". He languished for two years until he was freed by Didier and Georges, who told him that their father intended to have him killed. With a fond farewell, they sent him to live in the mansion where he could be safe until Georges claimed the family name and they could welcome him back. Upon his father's death, Michel had written to his mother requesting her acceptance of him as a man. In her hysteria, she had sent the knights to claim his life, with Didier leading the procession. Morgana claims that the White-Haired Girl was the reincarnation of Michel that Giselle had asked for, thus proving him to be female, and mocks him for being unable to remember Giselle in his other lives. The real Giselle accepts Michel for everything he is and remains confident that the White-Haired Girl was not Michel. Michel, encouraged by Giselle to save Morgana's soul, physically travels to the distant past when Morgana was alive. Believing changing the past may be able to save Morgana from her fate, Michel convinces the past versions of Mell and Yukimasa to set her free by revealing their parts in Morgana's captivity to the past versions of Nellie and Pauline. He then travels into the memories of the past Jacopo, learning that while he is currently the lord, he was not the same lord as the man who had mutilated Morgana for blood. Instead, he was the slave who had saved Morgana and cared for her, and he had eventually fallen in love with her. Overwhelmed with guilt and self-loathing, Jacopo agrees with the other three men to free Morgana. When they climb the observation tower, they find her on the verge of death and speaking to herself, her mind having been split in two. Michel stays by her side and comforts her as she dies; when he attempts to leave the mansion with her body, though, he instead sees the events that had originally taken place following Morgana's death, revealing that he was not changing the past but merely reliving it. Back in the mansion, Michel meets the White-Haired Girl, who is revealed to be the half of Morgana's soul embodying her self- sacrificing nature. Being formless until meeting Michel, The White-Haired Girl had modeled her appearance and name after him out of admiration. At her insistent request, Michel permanently destroys her soul, allowing Morgana's soul to heal and become whole again. Finally relinquishing her hatred after having learned the truth behind the three men's actions, Morgana goes with Michel to the spirits of the men trapped in the mansion; while Morgana doesn't forgive any of them, she sets their souls free. Before they leave, Michel retrieves the talking painting, which he realizes was the soul of Georges who had also been trapped in the mansion. The three go to leave the mansion, but Didier's soul blocks their path. Georges blocks a fatal blow for Michel, and Michel manages to bring Didier to his senses and help his soul pass on. Michel, Morgana and Giselle leave the mansion, causing it to dissipate, and all three pass on. In 2009 France, the reincarnations of Mell, Nellie, Yukimasa, Pauline, Jacopo, Maria and Morgana are living ordinary lives. The reincarnated Giselle, having retained all of the memories of her past life, goes to where the mansion once stood, and is greeted by the reincarnated Michel, who has retained his memories as well.  Development  The game was developed by Novectacle and written by Keika Hanada, with art by Moyataro. The developers did not specifically target men or women with the game, and instead just intended to make a game for players who enjoy stories. Hanada spent more than a year planning the story, which was influenced by Tanith Lee's books, and the films Millennium Actress (2001) and The Best of Youth (2003). To keep the text from distracting the player, it was mostly written in modern Japanese, with only little use of archaic speech. To make the game feel unique, Moyataro made use of heavy coloring and shading, to portray a \\"more realistic kind of beauty\\" compared to the \\"cutesy\\" anime-like artstyle common in Japanese visual novels. Another important aspect in making the game feel unique was its music: more than half of the songs are vocal tracks, intended to make the game feel like visiting a theatre with someone singing in the background. Five composers worked on the music, and wrote 65 different tracks. In June 2013, the game distribution platform Playism announced that they were interested in localizing the game for English-speaking audiences, as they wanted to bring visual novels to their platform and felt The House in Fata Morgana might be a good place for them to start. They encouraged people to tell them if they were interested in the game, to gauge demand for it. Two days later, they clarified that monetary issues were what caused them to not start localization work right away: Novectacle, being an indie developer, were unable to pay upfront for the localization work. Instead, Novectacle proposed that all revenue from Japanese The House in Fata Morgana sales would go to paying for the localization. As the Japanese sales on the Playism platform were much too low to finance the localization, Playism considered either waiting and seeing if Japanese sales would pick up pace, or launching a crowdfunding campaign. Playism was still working towards a localization in late March 2014, when they released a localized demo. During the Otakon convention in August 2014, the visual novel publisher MangaGamer announced that they had acquired the license to publish the game. Due to the large range of cultures and time periods appearing in the game, it was important to MangaGamer to decide on a localization strategy early on to avoid an inconsistent script; translator BlackDragonHunt said that making language in historical settings appear authentic was a difficult balancing act, with too modern dialogue breaking immersion, and older English being difficult for modern readers to understand. They decided to follow the same style as the Japanese original, mainly using modern language, with some use of words based on the various time periods and regions in the game to give it a \\"historical flavor\\": for instance, the word \\"bedroom\\" was replaced with \\"bedchamber\\", and \\"maid\\" with \\"abigail\\".  Release and reception  The game was originally released for Microsoft Windows on December 31, 2012 in Japan; this version was also released through Playism on May 31, 2013 in Japan. A Japanese iOS version followed on May 16, 2014. MangaGamer released the Microsoft Windows version in English on May 13, 2016, both separately and in a bundle with the game's soundtrack. A Nintendo 3DS version was released digitally in Japan on July 27, 2016 by FuRyu, as one of the first three games of their Catalyst line, and a PlayStation Vita version was released both physically and digitally in Japan on March 16, 2017 by Dramatic Create. This version includes new content; due to sickness, Moyataro was unable to create the new artwork needed for it, so another illustrator was given the task. Limited Run Games released the game in North America for PlayStation Vita on May 28, 2019, and released it for PlayStation 4 on June 11, under the title The House in Fata Morgana: Dream of the Revenants Edition; their PlayStation 4 version uses newer artwork as it was the first time the game was available in 4K resolution. They have also released physical versions for both platforms. The game was a runner-up for Hardcore Gamer Best Story of 2016 award. The Steam release had an estimated total of 8,500 players by July 2018. Complete list.

The affected \\"smaller\\" libraries consisted Burnt Ash, Hayes, Mottingham, Shortlands, Southborough and St Paul's Cray under these plans. The larger libraries and core services were also being considered for outsourcing. These privatization plans triggered criticism and strike action from current Bromley libraries staff in 2016. In July 2017, Bromley council announced that Greenwich Leisure Ltd. had been awarded a ten-year contract to operate the libraries service in cooperation with the council, and would take control of all library services as opposed to the split model proposed in the 2015 plans. This handover came into effect in November 2017, and also resulted in the departure of Bromley's libraries from the London Libraries Consortium, ending cross-borrowing with other London boroughs in the LLC. Following the handover to Greenwich Leisure Ltd., a dispute with former council staff over pay resulted in strike action from the union Unite, amid broader criticism of the council's privatization policies. The strike action began on March 28th of 2018, and involved 36 workers, ending in April after three weeks when a new agreement was reached between staff and Greenwich Leisure Ltd.

Maix dedicated her life and service to the adequate treatment of the poor and ill with an added emphasis on the recognition of female dignities. Maix's death in 1873 prompted calls for her beatification which commenced in 1993 and culminated in her beatification that was celebrated on 6 November 2010 in Brazil where she worked. Archbishop Lorenzo Baldisseri presided over the celebration on the behalf of Pope Benedict XVI. Life Maria B√°rbara Maix was born in Vienna on 27 June 1818 to Joseph Maix and Ros√°lia Mauritz; one of her sisters was Maria. Several siblings died in their childhood which left four other sisters and Maix. Her father served as a chamberlain to Archduke Franz Karl of Austria in the Sch√∂nbrunn Palace. In her childhood - even further into adulthood - she suffered from a series of heart ailments in addition to asthma. In her adolescence she worked as a kitchen hand and as a maid at the Sch√∂enbrunn Palace in the capital. It was around this time at the age of fifteen that both her parents died. At the age of 18 she and her sister Maria left the place the pair resided in and opened a home for those who needed assistance which included the poor population of Vienna. It was at this time she wrote a rule of life that sought to promote the dignities of females and it was this that inspired her to establish a Marian order for women to that effect. Maix established her new Marian order in Vienna in 1843 but desired the blessing of the Supreme Pontiff for his formal approval. She travelled to Rome for a scheduled audience with Pope Gregory XVI but the pontiff died on 1 June 1846 - a day before the two were to meet. Maix did not remain in Rome following this and nor did she attempt to have an audience with the new Pope Pius IX. During the Revolutions of 1848 she and her 21 companions were expelled from the state and made the decision to establish their order in North America. However, as the group awaited their ship in Hamburg Maix made the sudden decision to go to Brazil. She and her companions arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 9 November 1848 and founded their Mother-House at Porto Alegre on 8 May 1849. At the request of the Bishop of Rio de Janeiro Manoel de Monte Rodrigues de Araujo she entered the Conceptionist Sisters for six months before leaving. She prepared for her vows and religious vesting alongside 22 others on 8 May 1849 and assumed a new religious name; this marked the formal establishment of her order in Brazil. The congregation welcomed the poor and the ill as well as women and abandoned people. On 31 December 1870 she departed for Rio de Janeiro from Porto Alegre to assist at a school for orphan girls. Maix fell ill following Mass on 7 March 1873. She died on 17 March 1873 in her armchair with a slight smile on her face. Her remains were relocated in 1957 and are now at the Chapel of S√£o Raphael in Porto Alegre. Her institute now operates across South America in places like Bolivia and expanded in other places like Haiti and Italy. Beatification Tomb. The beatification process commenced after the transfer of the competent forum that would undertake the cause from Rio de Janeiro to Porto Alegre on 15 May 1992. Following this the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against) to the cause on 2 February 1993 under Pope John Paul II and proclaimed her to be a Servant of God. The diocesan process spanned from 19 June 1993 and concluded its work on 29 November 1996. It was ratified on 24 April 1998 and allowed for the postulation to compile the Positio and submit it to the C.C.S. in 2003 for their own assessment. Historians were called to assess the cause and determine if it could proceed without historical obstacles and approved the cause to continue to the next stage on 29 April 2003. Theologians approved the cause on 19 October 2007 and the C.C.S. followed suit on 1 April 2008. Maix was declared to be Venerable on 3 July 2008 after Pope Benedict XVI confirmed that she had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. The miracle required for her beatification was investigated in the diocese of its origin and was ratified as a valid process on 6 October 2000. The Rome-based medical board approved it on 13 November 2008 while consulting theologians cleared it on 22 April 2009. The C.C.S. gave their approval on 12 January 2010 before passing it onto the pope for his own papal approval on 27 March 2010. Lorenzo Baldisseri presided over the beatification on 6 November 2010 in Porto Alegre on the behalf of Benedict XVI. The current postulator assigned to the cause is Gentila Richetti.

Exterior appearance was not specifically stated, other than the limiting of ornate or expensive features. There is no specific information regarding the use of the Tudor Revival design. It is the only known example of Tudor Revival in Hobart. In 1968, the library built a larger building elsewhere and sold the Carnegie building to the Hobart Historical Society. It is now a museum. Description The building is rectangular with a high-pitched gable roof. On the south is a small gabled bay and entry porch. It is a brick structure with a slate roof in a Tudor Revival style. The roofline is outlined by an ogee-shaped cornice with returns. The brickwork is a Flemish bond, with decorative coursing in the foundation area. The double chimney is corbelled on the east facade. The main entry is on the south next to the bay window. A small porch extends from the main roof over the door. East of the entry is a polygonal bay window, with five, large, leaded glass windows. Each window has a stained glass flower decoration. The brickwork is intricate limestone trim. The bay window is topped by a gable in a half-timbered design with quatrefoil decorative elements. The west fa√ßade was built with a Palladian style window grouping and a circular ventilator in the gable area. A later addition to provide access to the basement area has altered this fa√ßade. A 1969 addition on the north fa√ßade used concrete block. The basement is a one-half story above grade designed for lectures and meetings. The main floor is one large room. The east end was designated the children's reading room, while west end was reserved for adults. The librarian was located opposite the main door. The Carnegie floor plan \\"A\\" places windows high in the walls, to provide for bookshelves below. The east end has a fireplace center on the wall, was considered a waste of space for bookshelves. The woodwork and bookcases were of oak. See also *List of Carnegie libraries in Indiana References Bibliography *George S.

The lake lies within Independence Township in Oakland County, Michigan. The lake has a maximum depth of 55 feet. Greens Lake connects to Lester Lake and Van Norman Lake to the south and Dollar Lake, Middle Lake and Deer Lake to the north. Namesake Greens Lake was named for the Green Family who owned a 200-acre farm along the eastern shore of the lake. In 1832, John Green (b.1794-d.1851), along with his wife Elinor (b.1802-d.1883) and their ten children settled on sections 28 and 29 in Independence Township, Michigan from their Warren County, New Jersey home. After John Green's death in 1851, his son, Daniel Green (b. 1828, d. 1918), along with Daniel's wife Julia (b. 1826, d. 1914) took over the family farm in sections 29 and 32 on Waterford Hill in Independence Township. The farm was located along the lake that was originally called Green's Lake but over time was called Greens Lake, without the apostrophe. Bay Court Park On the south shore of Greens Lake is Bay Court Park. The Independence Township park features a sandy beach, a playscape, a 9-hole disc golf course, picnic pavilions, a banquet/meeting facility, and a gazebo. Prior to Bay Court Park becoming an Independence Township park, it was a camp. The Boy Scouts camped at Camp Brady on Greens Lake and across the street (Andersonville Road) on Lester Lake from 1921 through 1946. In 1946, the camp was sold to the United Way and was used as a camp for mothers and children through 1972. It was also used by the Detroit Public Schools for underprivileged children. The camp was sold in 1988 to Independence Township.

They have numerous teams competing in competitions run by the Central Coast Division of Country Rugby League, from U/7s through to First Grade. The Hawks' current home ground is Darren Kennedy Oval and their traditional colours are blue and gold. History Toukley began as a junior rugby league club in 1967. In 1971, when Group 12 Schoolboys switched from weight limit teams to age limit teams, Toukley fielded a side in each age group from Under 8 to Under 14, although not in Under 15. When a Second Division competition commenced in 1976, Toukley entered a team. The Hawks' were competitive in their inaugural season of senior football and reached the semi-finals. The following year, Toukley finished at the top of the table, then defeated Milson Island in a major-semi- final and Wyong in a Grand Final, to claim the Second Division premiership. Toukley switched to First Division in 1979 and entered teams in First Grade, Second Grade, Third Grade, Under 19s and Under 17s. During the 1980s, Toukley's appearances in finals football were limited. The Hawks were Second Grade Grand Finalists in 1981 and Under 18 Semi-finalists in 1985, 1988 and 1989. In 1991 Toukley qualified for the finals series in Third, Second and, for the first time, First Grade. Sadly for the club, all finals matches were lost by small margins. In Third Grade Toukley had led 8‚Äì0 after twenty minutes, but The Entrance won 22‚Äì16. In Second Grade, Erina led 18‚Äì0, before a rally by the Hawks saw the scores level, 20-all at full time. Two tries by Erina in the second period of extra-time denied Toukley, 28‚Äì20 being the final score. One week later, Toukley met Erina in the First Grade major semi-final. The 6-all half-time score, was broken by an Erina field goal. A later try was added by the Eagles, to beat the Hawks 11‚Äì6. Toukley then met Woy Woy in the preliminary final. Despite dominating possession and field position in the first twenty minutes, Toukley trailed 12‚Äì2 at half-time. A try, conversion and later penalty goal by Toukley reduced the margin to two points, but Woy Woy kicked away with an unconverted try and subsequent field goal. Final score, 17‚Äì10. In 1995 Toukley dropped out of First Division and returned to Second Division, which came to be known as the Saturday League. The number of wins each season increased over the ensuing seasons, culminating in a Grand Final win over the Peninsula Raiders in 1998. The match was scoreless for 76 minutes, at which point the Raiders landed a field goal. Toukley responded in the last minute, \\"On the fourth tackle the ball went out the backline until lock and captain Mark Burns had to regather a sloppy pass. In desperation Burns passed back inside to David Sant, who sped through a gap\\" and \\"crashed over beside the posts\\". The try was converted, 6‚Äì1 the full time score. Toukley's success in the Saturday League continued in 1999 as they reached the Grand Final undefeated. The Hawks led early and again late in the second half, prior to a penalty goal by opponents Budgewoi taking the score to 14-all at full time. Toukley scored a converted try early in extra-time and held on to win, 20‚Äì14. Toukley and Budgewoi met again in the 2000 Grand Final. A strong performance in the first half saw the Hawks cross for five tries and lead 22‚Äì0 at the break. The Bulldogs rallied and a second try with nine minutes to go, brought them within ten points. Toukley, however, held firm to win 22‚Äì12, and claim a third successive Saturday League title. Budgewoi players and supporters must have derived both satisfaction and relief when they defeated Toukley in the minor semi-final of 2001, ending the Hawk's season. Budgewoi went on to win the Grand Final. After finishing seventh in 2002, Toukley returned to the final series in 2003. The second division competition was now known as the Ken Cosgrove Cup. Losing the major semi-final to defending premiers Central Wyong (10‚Äì20), Toukley recovered with a win over Gosford Cougars, 38‚Äì14, to set-up a rematch. Trailing by six points for much of the second half, \\"a try to fullback Daniel Lewis with 13 seconds remaining followed by a storming performance in extra-time propelled the Toukley Hawks to grand final glory.\\" Two unconverted tries were added by Toukley, to win 24‚Äì16. Toukley had strong seasons in the Ken Cosgrove Cup in 2004 and 2005, finishing as losing Finalists in both years. In 2006, local Rugby League was reorganised and the second division competition was discontinued. Toukley entered teams in First Grade, Second Grade and Under 17s and finished in sixth or seventh place in each competition. The club has fielded a team in many of the senior-level competitions since, and reached three lower grade grand finals: Under 17s and the inaugural Open Age league in 2010 and Under 18/1s in 2012. In 2015 and 2016 Toukley fielded teams in First Grade, Reserve Grade, Open Age and in Ladies League Tag. In 2017, the club also entered an Under 19 team, competing in all five senior competitions. In 2017 the club has fielded 23 junior teams, from Under 6's to Under 17's, an increase of six teams from 2016, and the most in the club's 50 year history.

It was released in the UK as a Sky Cinema Original Film. The film is about a maintenance worker, his meteorologist brother, and a treasury agent contending with band of rogue treasury agents who plan to use a Category 5 hurricane to cover their tracks of a bank robbery. The film was released on March 9, 2018, received negative reviews and was a box-office bomb, making just $32 million against its estimated $35 million budget. Plot In 1992, a category 5 hurricane named \\"Andrew\\" hits the town of Gulfport. Will and Breeze Rutledge (Leonardo Dickens and Patrick McAuley) are evacuating from the destructive hurricane with their dad. However, their truck gets stuck after avoiding the toppling tree in front of them, and they are forced to take refuge in a nearby house. While trying to save the truck from blowing away, strong winds blow a water tank and it crushes their dad, killing him. In 2018, another destructive category 5 hurricane named \\"Tammy\\" approaches the town of Gulfport. Federal Reserve Treasury agent Casey Corbyn (Maggie Grace) is ordered by fellow employee Randy Moreno (Christian Contreras) to summon Breeze (Ryan Kwanten), who now works in maintenance and whose brother Will (Toby Kebbell) is a National Weather Service meteorologist, to fix the generator at a cash storage facility. While she is out of the facility, rogue Treasury agents led by Connor Perkins (Ralph Ineson) infiltrate the facility and hold Moreno hostage. Their plan is to steal $600 million, and Perkins enlists computer hackers Sasha (Melissa Bolona) and Frears (Ed Birch) to crack the code of the vault. Failing to decrypt it, Perkins realizes that Corbyn may have changed it, so he has his men find her. Sasha and Frears have to use a brute-force attack using the town's transmission tower. As Corbyn and Breeze drive back to the facility, they encounter the mercenaries, and Corbyn engages in a shootout with them. Will helps her escape with his Storm Research Vehicle (SRV) called the Dominator, but Breeze is left behind and is captured and taken hostage, forced to repair the generator. Will is upset when he learns that his brother is in danger. Determined to save him, he and Corbyn meet Sheriff Jimmy Dixon (Ben Cross) at his station. Unfortunately, Sheriff Dixon reveals himself to be one of Perkins' cohorts and tries to take Will and Corbyn hostage. Corbyn shoots the sheriff, and they escape. When Dixon and one of his deputies chase them, Will manages to knock their car with his Dominator. Realizing that the tower is being used to crack the vault's code, Will and Corbyn manage to topple it moments before the decryption is completed. Perkins' men spot them and engage in a gunfight with them, but they escape. Dixon turns Perkins down, confronting him over a botched heist in the previous hurricane. When Dixon wants to claim all the money, Perkins shoots him dead and persuades Dixon's men to find Corbyn. While looting a mall, Corbyn calls Perkins and makes a deal for the release of Moreno and Breeze as long as she opens the vault and gets the money. When Perkins asks where the trade will be conducted, Corbyn tells him at the mall. When Perkins asks \\".....which mall?\\" Corbyn says \\"The only mall in Gulfport.\\" The mercenaries arrive at the mall with Breeze to do the trade. Will and Corbyn make a plan to shoot the roof glass causing the mercenaries to be sucked out through the roof. After Will talks to Breeze, Corbyn shoots the glass roof, sucking the mercenaries out into the storm as planned. Corbyn, Will, and Breeze manage to hold on. After the storm surge, Corbyn gives herself up while Breeze rescues the stranded Will. Back at the Treasury facility as Corbyn and the remaining mercenaries arrive, Perkins breaks his deal to release Moreno and shoots him avenging the deaths of his men Jaqi (Moyo Akande) and Xander (Jimmy Walker). As the eye of the storm passes, Perkins and his men take the money, using three of the facility's truck trailers, along with Corbyn. Will and Breeze follow them. With the eye- wall approaching on their tail, Will and Breeze take over a truck, and Frears and Perkins are injured in the process. After the struggle with Perkins, the eye-wall sucks the money out of one of the trucks and then the truck itself. Cursing the storm, Perkins is then killed after his own detached trailer crushes him. When Breeze's truck engine backfires and burns, Will and Corbyn transfer him to their truck. However, when they attempt to rescue Sasha and Frears, they are sucked into the storm. Corbyn and the brothers manage to outrun the storm safely, and drive away into the sunshine.

In February 2016, it was announced that the film had been acquired for distribution in a large number of international locations via the European Film Market. In May 2016, it was revealed that Toby Kebbell had been set to star in the film. In June 2016, the rest of the cast was announced. Principal photography on the film began in Bulgaria on August 29, 2016. In July 2017, the completed film, now titled The Hurricane Heist, was acquired for domestic distribution by Entertainment Studios with an early 2018 release date slated. In the UK, the film will be released by Altitude Film Distribution and will be the second Sky Cinema Original Film. Reception =Box office= The Hurricane Heist grossed $6.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $26.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total $32.5 million against a production budget of $35 million. In the United States and Canada, The Hurricane Heist was released on March 9, 2018 alongside The Strangers: Prey at Night, Gringo, and A Wrinkle in Time, and was initially projected to gross around $7 million from 2,402 theaters in its opening weekend. However, after making just $950,000 on its first day, weekend estimates were lowered to $3 million. It ended up grossing $3 million, finishing ninth. =Critical response= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 47% based on 59 reviews, and an average rating of 4.83/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Hurricane Heist is a throwback to the overblown action thrillers of yesteryear‚Äîand a thoroughly middling example of why they don't make 'em like this anymore.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 35 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale. Alonso Duralde of TheWrap criticized the film's direction, acting and overbearing musical score, saying, \\"Critics often lament that worthy films released early in the year are too often forgotten during awards season, so let's be very clear up front: For your Best of the Worst of 2018 consideration, in all categories, The Hurricane Heist.\\" Andrew Barker, writing for Variety, gave the film an ironic recommendation, calling it the best worst movie of 2018 and saying: \\"All three of our heroes take time out in the middle of survival situations to discuss their undying love of football and the Second Amendment, but they also believe in climate change. If our divided country can't come together over a movie this wonderfully terrible, what hope do we really have?\\" There are some factual inconsistencies relating to the alleged location of the events in the film. Several scenes show mountains in the distance, but the entire Gulf Coast is completely flat. Also, the film claims to be in Gulfport, which exists in Mississippi, not Alabama.

She co-founded the Association for Reproductive and Family Health of which she was director for many years, has acted as consultant for many different organisations across Africa, and has written and co-authored numerous books and articles on women's health and related topics. In 1993, she was given the World Health Organization Sasakawa Award for her work in health development.  Early life and education  Grace Ebun-Oluwa Samuel was born in Kaduna on 13 November 1935 to Yoruba parents. Her name Ebun-Oluwa means gift from God in Yoruba: she was born unexpectedly to a forty-four-year-old mother with one other child, a ten-year-old boy. She grew up aware that her mother had had a series of difficulties with pregnancy and child mortality. Her mother, who had little schooling herself, supported her daughter's enthusiasm for education and let her go to school in Lagos when she was thirteen. Delano won a scholarship that allowed her to move to more advanced schools, ending with the Abeokuta Grammar School. With help from her mother and brother Delano travelled to England in 1956 for three years of nursing training. After that she studied midwifery and then trained as a district nurse. This was when she came across women who wanted help to space their pregnancies out, and she took the opportunity to go to lectures in family planning and the use of the diaphragm. Delano returned to Nigeria in 1961 and the following year got a job in the maternity unit at University College Hospital, Ibadan. By then she was married to the future judge Tunde Delano.  Career  Her work as maternity staff nurse led to her joining a project started by an Ibadan University professor, and she became the nurse in charge of the first university teaching hospital family planning programme in Nigeria. Over the years the programme spread from urban to rural areas,Demographic and Programmatic Consequences of Contraceptive Innovations p123 and from hospital-based provision to community-based initiatives, including distributing supplies through traditional markets. This work came to involve visits abroad: at first trips to the US for training,PIACT report and later on Delano went as a consultant to many other African countries. Much of her work was funded or part-funded by international agencies like USAID, Pathfinder International and the Ford Foundation. After she wrote a straightforward informational book on family planning the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) paid for it to be printed and distributed in five languages. She went on to write several other books and has written or co- written numerous academic health-related articles. UNFPA also supported her pioneering clinical manual on the IUCD.Sickle Cell Health Foundation In the 1980s she was connected with the Center for Development and Population Activities (CEDPA) which used to organise leadership development training for women, especially supporting health and education initiatives. It is now part of Plan USA.Plan International and CEDPA Delano began to feel more confident about public speaking, and went to conferences, meeting other female leaders, and planning strategies to help women, especially with reproductive issues. While still working within Ibadan University (she left in 1992) Delano started to work with community organisations to develop a new NGO which became the independent Association for Reproductive and Family Health (ARFH). It expanded, added adolescent sexual healthUSAID report and other areasARFH projects to its concerns and worked with the government on HIV/AIDS projects. ARFH educational and counselling materials are used in many African countries. A key colleague in this work was Professor O.A. Ladipo, president of ARFH.

In December 2016, it became the first approved drug used in treating this disorder. Nusinersen cost in the first year and annually after that in the United States as of 2019. Nusinersen has orphan drug designation in the United States and the European Union.  Medical use The drug is used to treat spinal muscular atrophy associated with a mutation in the SMN1 gene. It is administered directly to the central nervous system (CNS) using intrathecal injection. For updates see FDA index page for NDA 209531 In clinical trials, the drug halted the disease progression. In around 60% of infants affected by type 1 spinal muscular atrophy, it improves motor function. Side effects People treated with nusinersen had an increased risk of upper and lower respiratory infections and congestion, ear infections, constipation, pulmonary aspiration, teething, and scoliosis. There is a risk that growth of infants and children might be stunted. In older clinical trial subjects, the most common adverse events were headache, back pain, and other adverse effects from the spinal injection, such as post-dural-puncture headache. Although not observed in the trial patients, a reduction in platelets as well as a risk of kidney damage are theoretical risks for antisense drugs and therefore platelets and kidney function should be monitored during treatment. In 2018, several cases of communicating hydrocephalus in children and adults treated with nusinersen emerged; it remains unclear whether this was drug related. Pharmacology Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the SMN1 gene which codes for survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. People survive owing to low amounts of the SMN protein produced from the SMN2 gene. Nusinersen modulates alternative splicing of the SMN2 gene, functionally converting it into SMN1 gene, thus increasing the level of SMN protein in the CNS. The drug distributes to CNS and peripheral tissues. The half-life is estimated to be 135 to 177 days in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 63 to 87 days in blood plasma. The drug is metabolized via exonuclease (3‚Ä≤- and 5‚Ä≤)-mediated hydrolysis and does not interact with CYP450 enzymes. The primary route of elimination is likely by urinary excretion for nusinersen and its metabolites. Chemistry Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide in which the 2‚Äô-hydroxy groups of the ribofuranosyl rings are replaced with 2‚Äô-O-2-methoxyethyl groups and the phosphate linkages are replaced with phosphorothioate linkages. The sequence of nusinersen (UCACUUUCAUAAUGCUGG) is listed as N1-Hua in Table I. History Nusinersen was developed in a collaboration between Adrian Krainer at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (formerly called Isis Pharmaceuticals). Initial work of target discovery of nusinersen was done by Dr. Ravindra Singh and co-workers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School funded by Cure SMA. Starting in 2012, Ionis partnered with Biogen on development and, in 2015, Biogen acquired an exclusive license to the drug for a license fee, milestone payments up to , and tiered royalties thereafter; Biogen also paid the costs of development subsequent to taking the license. The license to Biogen included licenses to intellectual property that Ionis had acquired from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and University of Massachusetts. In November 2016, the new drug application was accepted under the FDA's priority review process on the strength of the Phase III trial and the unmet need, and was also accepted for review at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) at that time. It was approved by the FDA in December 2016 and by EMA in May 2017 as the first drug to treat SMA. Subsequently, nusinersen was approved to treat SMA in Canada (July 2017), Japan (July 2017), Brasil (August 2017), and Switzerland (September 2017). Cost Nusinersen list price in the USA is per injection which puts the treatment cost at in the first year and annually after that. According to The New York Times, this places nusinersen \\"among the most expensive drugs in the world\\". In October 2017, the authorities in Denmark recommended nusinersen for use only in a small subset of people with SMA type 1 (young babies) and refused to offer it as a standard treatment for all other people with SMA quoting an \\"unreasonably high price\\" compared to the benefit.Medicinr√•det siger nej til l√¶gemiddel til b√∏rn med muskelsvind: 'Urimeligt' dyrt Retrieved October 13, 2017. Norwegian authorities rejected the funding in October 2017 because the price of the medicine was \\"unethically high\\".Dette er uforst√•elig og utrolig urettferdigThis is incomprehensible and incredibly unfair (google translate) In February 2018, the funding was approved for people under 18 years old. In August 2018, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which weighs the cost-effectiveness of therapies for the NHS in England and Wales, recommended against offering nusinersen to people with SMA. Children with SMA type 1 were treated in the UK under a Biogen-funded expanded access programme; after enrolling 80 children, the scheme closed to new people in November 2018. In May 2019, however, NICE reversed its stance and announced its decision to recommend nusinersen for use across a wide spectrum of SMA for a 5 year period.Nusinersen for treating spinal muscular atrophy. NICE Technology appraisal guidance [TA588 2019] The Irish Health Service Executive decided in February 2019 that nusinersen was too expensive to fund, saying the cost would be about ‚Ç¨600,000 per patient in the first year and around ‚Ç¨380,000 a year thereafter \\"with an estimated budget impact in excess of ‚Ç¨20 million over a five-year period\\" for the 25 children with SMA living in Ireland. Both the manufacturer and patient groups disputed the numbers and pointed out that actual pricing arrangements for Ireland are in line with the negotiated price for the BeneluxA initiative which Ireland has been a member of since June 2018. As of May 2019, nusinersen was available in public healthcare in more than 40 countries.

Earl Heinrekr of Saxland, who also interprets dreams, envies > Jon's superior ability. By eating J√≥n's heart, the earl hopes to acquire > J√≥n's gift, so he commands his wife Ingibj«´rg to murder J√≥n in his sleep, > cut out his heart, and prepare it as food for a meal. Ingibj«´rg spares J√≥n, > however, and substitutes the heart of a dog. A waxen image of J√≥n is buried > in his stead. The earl's treachery comes to light when his brother-in-law, > the emperor of Saxland, arrives seeking interpretation of an unusual dream. > He learns the truth about J√≥n from Ingibj«´rg. Subsequently, the earl is > banished, while J√≥n receives the earldom and weds Ingibj«´rg.Marianne E. > Kalinke and P. M.

He trained first as a cabinetmaker; later, at some time between the ages of 14 and 19, he traveled to Albany, New York, where he studied painting with William Collins. His earliest known portraits date from 1837 and are mainly of family members. Following his father's death, he bought his brother's share of the family farm and supplemented his income by land management. In 1840 Chandler married Lucretia Ann Waite (1820‚Äì1868), an established painter from Hubbardston, Massachusetts. A descendant reported that Lucretia \\"finished up\\" her husband's paintings, and the two artists probably collaborated on several portraits. Soon after his marriage, Chandler began his career as an itinerant painter, traveling principally in northwestern Massachusetts until he established a studio in Boston in 1852. In 1860 the Chandlers returned to Hubbardston, where they spent the rest of their lives. Chandler died in 1884, and is buried in the Greenwood Cemetery.

Exhibit Columbus is an \\"annual exploration of architecture, art, design, and community,\\" that alternates between symposium and exhibition programming each year, and features the J. Irwin and Xenia S. Miller Prize. The award-winning and critically acclaimed project has been credited with renewing the design legacy of Columbus, Indiana. After hosting its inaugural symposium, \\"Foundations and Futures,\\" in fall 2016 and inaugural exhibition in Fall 2017, the 2018 symposium, \\"Design, Community, and Progressive Preservation\\" took place in September 2018. The second exhibition, \\"Good Design and the Community: Columbus, Indiana,\\" ran from August 24 to December 1, 2019. Exhibit Columbus has four key components: The Miller Prize, High School Design Team, University Design Research Fellowships, Washington Street Civic Projects, and Environmental design and Wayfinding.  The J. Irwin and Xenia S. Miller Prize  The Miller Prize was created to honor J. Irwin Miller and his wife Xenia S. Miller, two of the twentieth century's greatest patrons of architecture, design, and art, and a \\"family whose visionary commitment to community remains unparalleled.\\" The J. Irwin and Xenia S. Miller Prize is the centerpiece of both Exhibit Columbus's symposium and exhibition; recipients are international leaders selected for their commitment to the transformative power that architecture, art, and design has to improve people's lives and make cities better places to live. With this award, Exhibit Columbus brings studios‚Äô unique perspectives to Columbus to explore the traditions and values that have created this city's internationally renowned design legacy. Each studio is paired with a significant downtown site to create new forms that allow us to rediscover their purpose, while further connecting people to place and community. In 2016 ten designers were paired at one of the five sites in a competition to see which team would be selected by a jury for the opportunity to build an installation in conversation with the past while exploring the future of design and fabrication. In 2018 five studios were selected as Miller Prize winners from a short list. These studios were selected for their commitment to using art and architecture to improve people's lives and make cities better places to live. After the 2019 Design Presentations in January 2019, Wallpaper* declared that the exhibition \\"promises to celebrate women in architecture,\\" and The Republic Newspaper indicated that the installations would lean heavily on landscape architecture. 2019 Exhibition The 2019 exhibition participants were announced in the Summer 2018, and participated as speakers in the 2018 National Symposium: Design, Community, and Progressive Preservation. The exhibition opened on August 24 and ran through December 1, 2019. The exhibition featured 18 site-responsive installations by architects, designers, academics, artists, and graphic designers. These designers created outdoor installations and experiences that used Columbus‚Äô built heritage as inspiration and context, while highlighting the role that visionary community plays in growing a vibrant, sustainable, and equitable city. For inspiration, Exhibit Columbus looked to the 1986 exhibition, Good Design and the Community: Columbus, Indiana, created when Columbus business leader and philanthropist J. Irwin Miller became the first person inducted into the National Building Museum Hall of Fame in Washington. Mr. Miller chose to emphasize the community's process and involvement in building, rather than the architecture itself, as a source of his hometown pride. Elaborating on the connection between the tangible and intangible culture that Mr. Miller described, the 2019 exhibition explored the idea of ‚Äúgood design in the community,‚Äù and what it means today. =2019 Miller Prize Recipients= The 2019 exhibition will feature five J. Irwin and Xenia S. Miller Prize recipients: * Agency Landscape + Planning (Cambridge, MA) ::Site: AT&T; Facility, 1978, Paul Kennon of Caudill Rowlett Scott * Bryony Roberts Studio (New York, NY) ::Site: Columbus City Hall, 1981, Edward Charles Bassett, Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill * Frida Escobedo Studio (Mexico City, Mexico) ::Site: Cleo Rogers Memorial Library Plaza, 1971, I.M.

The commissioning of innovative, well-designed educational facilities helped create what can be seen today: a quality, forward-thinking educational system. Inspired by J. Irwin Miller's vision, Exhibit Columbus seeks to connect the next generation of the Columbus community to its design heritage through the High School Design Team. =Environmental design and wayfinding= Thirst is designing a system that provides a cohesive experience that connects each installation. The Environmental Design and Wayfinding of the 2019 Exhibition unified the many facets of the exhibition through a system of color-coded installation kiosks and an exhibition guide design by Thirst, with complimentary guides in the form of a Family Activity Guide designed by Rosten Woo, and the Hear/Here app created by Halsey Burgund. Exhibit Columbus considers Environmental Design and Wayfinding as the 18th installation as it forms a continuous language that serves to inspire, educate, and connect to Exhibit Columbus‚Äô purpose and the exhibition theme. =Publications, mobile app, and videos= Exhibit Columbus sought to provide an enjoyable and meaningful experience for all ages. The Family Activity Guide, designed by Rosten Woo, invited children and families to learn about and interact with the exhibition, as well as interpret Columbus‚Äô design heritage. Hear/Here is an interactive location-based audio app that offers an aural exploration of the exhibition and invites visitors to upload their own voices. Historic audio clips, insights from community members, and interviews with exhibition participants come together in the Hear/Here app‚Äì‚Äìcreating a new way to interact with the exhibition and experience the city's design legacy. 2018 symposium The 2018 symposium took place September 26 to September 29, and was created in partnership with Docomomo US, American Institute of Architects Indiana and Kentucky, and the Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields. The theme for the symposium is Design, Community, and Progressive Preservation, a title which recognizes the need to look for forward looking preservation plans in the future of cities. The Architect's Newspaper proclaimed that the symposium was \\"unburdened by the lack of old-school historic preservation and architectural history thought chains, and discussion instead focused on innovation, creativity, and participation over historical facts delivered by academics.\\" Over four days about 1200 attendees experienced sessions in many of the historic buildings throughout Columbus. The symposium culminated with introductory remarks from the 2019 Miller Prize Winners. 2017 exhibition The 2017 exhibition opened on 26 August and features 18 site-responsive installations in downtown Columbus. Funding from the project has come from a number of individuals, corporations, and foundations in the region, including the Ball State University, Cummins, Indiana University, Efroymson Family Fund, and the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts. The eighteen installations on view during the inaugural exhibition were: =Miller Prize Installations= Five projects of architecture or art that are in conversation with one of the Miller Prize Sites; *Another Circle by Aranda\\\\Lasch at Mill Race Park *Anything can happen in the woods by Plan B at the Cummins Office Building *The Exchange by Oyler Wu at the Irwin Conference Center *Wiikiaami by studio:indigenous at First Christian Church *Conversation Plinth by IKD at Cleo Rogers Memorial Library 2016 Miller Prize Finalists * Benjamin Aranda and Chris Lasch of Aranda\\\\Lasch (Tucson, AZ and New York, NY) * Benjamin Ball and Gaston Nogues of Ball-Nogues Studio (Los Angeles, CA) * Herwig Baumgartner and Scott Uriu of Baumgartner + Uriu (Los Angeles, CA) * Rachel Hayes of Rachel B.

M. Stern, and Michael Van Valkenburgh and sessions with experts on the history of Modern architecture, Columbus, Indiana, fabrication, and the community. The symposium was billed as the first step to launch the first exhibition which is slated to take place in August 2017. All ten of the 2016 Miller Prize Finalists were featured in panel discussions. The 2016 symposium was recognized by NUVO as a \\"2016 Best Of Editors Pick.\\" Project development Early planning work for Exhibit Columbus began in late 2014, and the project was officially launched on 5 May 2016 in Columbus as a program of Heritage Fund‚ÄîThe Community Foundation of Bartholomew County. It receives funding from a number of local and regional individuals, foundations, and corporations. =100 Variations= An exhibition was developed in the fall of 2014 as a pilot project that featured designer Jonathan Nesci who created 100 unique tables for an installation in front of First Christian Church. This exhibition, \\"100 Variations,\\" was produced by Indianapolis-based curator, Christopher West with support from the Haddad Foundation, the Columbus Area Visitors Center, and the Columbus Museum of Art and Design. Each of the tables was made by Noblitt Fabricating in Columbus, Indiana under the leadership of Curt Aton. =Graphic identity= The Chicago-based graphic design firm, Thirst, was hired in 2016 to create the Exhibit Columbus identity with the goal of creating a system that was aligned with Paul Rand's designs in Columbus, along with Alexander Girard's work at the Miller House and Garden.

The text was named after Penelope, the wife of Odysseus in Greek Mythology, who was perpetually spinning a web which she never completed.  History  After the creation of the European Single Currency, the European Commission decided that the EU should have a single constitution to replace the existing ad hoc system of multilateral treaties. The Convention on the Future of Europe, or the European Convention, was created by the European Council in December 2001 in order to propose a draft constitution for the European Union. The Commission wanted to create an expanded system of Qualified Majority Voting to allow for more expediency in decision making. In a speech in Strasbourg in May 2002, Romano Prodi stated that the proposed reforms had a further intention: 'As regards the institutions, our proposals have a clear aim: to define more clearly who does what in the European Union. In other words, who is accountable politically and institutionally for action undertaken.' (emphasis in original) However, the European Convention did not lead to agreement on a possible Constitution. According to a 2005 review of the treaty reform process: \\"Val√©ry Giscard d‚ÄôEstaing, the chair of the Praesidium, made clear at an early stage his lack of sympathy for the Commission and for its President‚Äôs ambition that it should become the government of Europe, suggesting that it had served purpose in establishing the single market.\\" The European Commission presented two communications to the Convention in 2002 laying out its policy preferences for a future constitution. These communications left out discussion of the architecture of European institutions until after the 2002 Irish Referendum on the Treaty of Nice. Prodi signalled his intention to influence the 'listening phase' of the Treaty consultations by creating the 'Penelope Group', \\"a small group of senior officials to prepare a draft Constitution in secret (European Commission, 2002c), which would be submitted to the Convention in the beginning of the ‚Äòdrafting phase‚Äô.\\" However, the existence of the Penelope Group led to a disagreement with Val√©ry Giscard D'Estaing, the chair of the Convention, who saw it as undermining his work. Secondly, \\"the ‚ÄòPenelope‚Äô draft was leaked to Le Monde and newspapers in Germany, Italy and Spain only hours before the official December document (European Commission, 2002b) was approved by the College (Norman, 2003, 165). The appearance of two texts, virtually simultaneously, seriously undermined the Commission‚Äôs credibility, even if there was little difference in their substance.\\" The Penelope Project document was seen by critics as an attempt to increase the importance and power of the Commission relative to the Parliament and Council, but the final outcome of the treaty process saw the creation of the office of President of the European Union, rather than increasing the powers of the President of the Commission.

In this procedure, the members of the diet divided into two bodies (corpora), the Corpus Evangelicorum (body of Evangelicals) and the Corpus Catholicorum (body of Catholics), irrespective of the colleges to which they otherwise belonged. That is, the Protestant (Evangelical) members of the College of Electors, the College of Princes and the College of Cities gathered together separately from the Catholic members of the same. The two bodies then negotiated with each other, but debated and voted among themselves. A decision was reached only when both bodies agreed. The itio in partes could be invoked whenever there was a unanimous vote of one body. At first, it could only be invoked in matters affecting religion, but gradually this requirement was dropped. Background The formation of the Corpus Evangelicorum as a grouping in the diet was a gradual process that began before 1648. During the period of confessional struggle between the Diet of Worms (1521) and the Peace of Westphalia (1648), there had been several Protestant leagues and a Catholic League, but these had no formal role in the empire's constitution. The first to propose making the Corpus Evangelicorum (i.e., the Protestant states collectively) an integral part of the empire's constitution was King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. Shortly before his death in 1632, he proposed as a settlement of the Thirty Years' War the establishment of a corpus politicum (political body) composed only of Protestant princes for civil administration and a corpus bellicum (body of war) for matters of defence. The relationship these corpora were to have with the empire is unclear. Gustavus' intention was mainly to limit the authority of the imperial Habsburg dynasty to their own lands and to strengthen Swedish domination of the Protestant part of the Empire. The Peace of Westphalia (which ended the Thirty Years' War) enshrined the corpora in the imperial constitution and introduced the itio in partes procedure for religious matters. The separation of the Catholic and Protestant states at the Westphalian peace conference (1645‚Äì48) was itself the model for the itio in partes. The Catholic states had gathered at M√ºnster, where negotiations between France and the Empire were to take place, while the Protestant states had gathered at Osnabr√ºck for negotiations between Sweden and the Empire. Establishment The itio in partes was introduced in Article V, ¬ß52 of the Treaty of Osnabr√ºck. It provided for the right of the diet to divide into two bodies to deliberate separately on a religious question. Each body would formulate its position separately before coming together to negotiate an \\"amicable agreement\\" (amicabilis compositio). In fact, Protestants and Catholics never agreed on what a religious question was. The Corpus Evangelicorum was of the view that any issue which affected a Protestant was a religious issue and thus, in effect, anything could be deliberated by itio in partes. Also implicit in the treaty was that no decision might be reached if the two corpora could not agree. This became the explicit view of the Corpus Evangelicorum by 1700. Each corpus was placed under a director. The director of the Corpus Catholicorum was the Elector of Mainz. The majority of Catholic states were bishoprics and abbacies. The Corpus Evangelicorum was formally organized on 22 July 1653 with the Elector of Saxony as director. When the elector, Augustus the Strong, converted to Catholicism in 1697, he refused to relinquish the directorate. In practice, actual control of the directorate was transferred to a cadet branch of the Saxon house, the Dukes of Weissenfels. Still, the dukes could not act without the approval of the Saxon privy council in Dresden. In response, Saxony's chief rival for the directorate, Brandenburg, assumed the role of vice-director. Evolution of the corpora After 1653, interest in the Corpus Evangelicorum as a vehicle for Protestant interests dwindled. It was re- ignited by the Peace of Ryswick (1697), which contained a clause contravening the Peace of Westphalia in favour of Catholicism. During the Eternal Diet that was in permanent session from 1663 until 1806, the Corpus Evangelicorum met as a separate body from 1712 to 1725, from 1750 to 1769 and from 1774 to 1778. Except for during an itio in partes, the Corpus Catholicorum did not meet separately from the regular diet. The periods of highest activity for the Corpus Evangelicorum correspond to periods of heightened Austro-Prussian rivalry. By the early 1700s, there were two factions within the Corpus Evangelicorum: a moderate party supportive of the Saxon directorate and following its lead and a more radically Protestant party led by Brandenburg and Hanover. The French called these factions the politiques (politicians) and the z√©l√©s (zealots). Under the influence of Brandenburg and Hanover, the Corpus drew up a list of 432 gravamina (grievances), published at Regensburg in 1719. Two more lists followed over the next three years. From the 1720s onwards, Protestants claimed that all religious issues could only be decided by the diet and that no court decision nor any decision by an imperial deputation could every be final. It was always possible to appeal the decision to the diet, the recursus ad comitia. This tendency was exacerbated by Brandenburg's dominance of the Corpus Evangelicorum. The corpus made decisions by majority vote. Since it was composed of imperial estates, and the ruler of Brandenburg held many (besides Brandenburg), he had effective control of the body. By the middle of the 18th century, a majority of votes in the corpus were held by Brandenburg alone. This made it to Brandenburg's advantage to claim that every issue was a religious one and to try to force an itio in partes. Under Frederick II, who had little respect for the imperial constitution, this practice paralyzed the diet. Invoking the itio There was no dispute over how the itio could be invoked or whether one corpus along could demand it. There was, however, a dispute at first over who was to decide if an issue constituted a \\"religious question\\". The Catholics insisted that an itio could only be demanded if both sides agree that the question was religious in nature. The Protestant view, which ultimately won out, was that a corpus could decide that unilaterally, just as a corpus could unilaterally force an itio in partes. The procedure of itio in partes was often threatened, but only ever formally invoked four times (1727, 1758, 1761, 1764). It was seriously threatened on one further occasion (1774‚Äì75). In every case it was primarily a tactic of Prussia to weaken Habsburg influence in the diet. Since Catholics had a permanent majority in both the College of Electors and the College of Princes after 1648, only the Corpus Evangelicorum ever initiated the itio in partes.

Poor Russian Jewish immigrants settling in the East End of London created demand for services for this community. And also opportunities for women's activism and the UJW was formed to address issues that Jewish women faced. It was inspired by the National Union of Women Workers (NUWW), and in 1900, a group of Jewish women gathered at the home of Lady Louisa de Rothschild and decided to organise the May 1902 Conference of Jewish Women.  Work  The Union declared itself to be an ‚Äúall-embracing sisterhood,‚Äù forming a ‚Äúbond between Jewish women of all degrees and all shades of opinion, religious, social and intellectual.‚Äù. The Union organized a system of volunteers trained to help women seeking employment and to assist Jewish charitable institutions. Before World War I the UJW was composed primarily of upper-class women who had little contact with the working class women the organisation was created to help. The UJW had mixed success; in 1924 the Council of the United Synagogue voted against the franchise for women, though many of those individual Synagogues had already agreed to support it. In order to be more effective, the UJW joined many women's organisations to promote further extension of women's suffrage.

He is also former coach of Dynamos Football Club. Pasuwa led Dynamos to four consecutive league titles as coach from 2011 to 2014 writing his own piece of history.  Background  Callisto Pasuwa (referred to as Kallisto in certain sections of the media) was born on 20 June 1970 in Mutare. He attended Mutare Boys High where he finished in 1990. Pasuwa is married.  Playing career  = Club = Pasuwa is a former Dynamos player. He was part of the history making Dembare outfit that played in the African Champions league. He also won several league titles with the club. He also played alongside other Dembare legends such as Memory Mucherahowa, Stewart Murisa and Tauya Murehwa. During his playing days, Pasuwa was known for his midfield artistry and dribbling skills. He was also known for scoring goals occasionally.  Coaching career  = Club = While Pasuwa was the coach at Dembare (a nickname for Dynamos F.C.), he also doubled as the national team assistant coach. It was however at Dembare that Pasuwa carved his name in the country's history books when he won four consecutive league titles. Many had expressed skepticism over Pasuwa's capacity to coach a well decorated outfit such as Dynamos after having taken over from Lloyd Mutasa whom he had been deputising. Pasuwa silenced his critics with four deserved league titles on the trot including other trophies such as the Mbada Diamonds Cup, Gushungo Victory Cup and the Bob 90 Cup.[1] During his successful stint at Dynamos, Pasuwa won 12 trophies which include four league titles, a record only him holds. = National Team = Pasuwa's coaching career with the national team both the under 23 and the senior side has been nothing short of exceptional. Despite a series of poor training facilities and planning on the part of ZIFA, Pasuwa has produced very impressive results. In an AFCON 2017 qualifier played against the flames of Malawi, the team traveled by bus after having trained as a unit for only a day but upset Malawi 2-1 on their home turf. He also followed the triumph of Malawi with another victory at Rufaro Stadium against the Comoros Islands in a CHAN qualifier. Pasuwa's appointment as senior national team coach had been after he had secured the qualification of the under 23 side to play in the All Africa Games after dispatching continental powerhouses, Cameroon.[2] Following a series of broken promises by ZIFA to Callisto Pasuwa, he walked away from his job in mid 2015 just days before a crucial match with South Africa effectively throwing the country's hopes of partaking in the Olympics into doubt.[3] Despite ZIFA getting money amounting to US 1 million, they had not paid Pasuwa a cent, resulting in the coach quitting his job at the eleventh hour. He later returned to his job leading Zimbabwe to a third AFCON qualification after beating Malawi 3-0 at home, leading the country to qualification with a game to spare for the first time.

During the early stages of the 2013 season, Pasuwa's charges lost the opening four games.[5][6] He, however, got Dembare's campaign on track after which he went on to win a fourth title. Despite landing a fourth title, relations between Pasuwa and the Dembare executive remained frosty.  Unceremonious Departure  Regardless of Pasuwa's triumphs at the helm of Dembare, his exit from the club was very unceremonious considering that he had won four consecutive league titles in succession. He was informed by the Dembare executive that if he wanted to remain as coach of the club, he would have to apply like any other coach intending to coach Dembare. After he walked away from the club, Pasuwa sued his former paymasters for unpaid dues. There had also been accusations from Dembare leaders alleging that Pasuwa had walked away with their property and that they did not owe him money but the court ruled that the club was supposed to pay Pasuwa money amounting to US$19 000.[3]  References  # Jump up‚Üë Dembare lifts Bob 90 cup, TM Pick n Pay Challenge Cup News DzeZimbabwe, Published: March 16, 2014, Retrieved: December 23, 2014 # Jump up‚Üë Pasuwa set to be named warriors head coach, Soccer24, Published: April 14, 2015, Retrieved: June 23, 2015 # ‚Üë Jump up to:3.0 3.1 Eddie Chikamhi Pasuwa walks away, The Herald, Published: July 29, 2015, July 29, 2015 # Jump up‚Üë Eddie Chikamhi, Callisto Pasuwa set for Kaizer Chiefs, 'Nehanda Radio', Published: 21 Dec 2012, Retrieved: 6 May 2014 # Jump up‚Üë Godknows Matarutse, Pasuwa faces axe, DailyNews, Published: 16 Apr 2013, Retrieved: 6 May 2014 # Jump up‚Üë LATEST: Pasuwa‚Äôs job on the line?, Chronicle, Published: 5 May 2014, Retrieved: # BLESSING SANDO IS THE MAIN SOURCE OUTTA SAKUBVA Category:Zimbabwean football managers Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:2017 Africa Cup of Nations managers Category:Zimbabwean expatriate football managers ","title":"Callisto Pasuwa"},{"id":"50540695","text":"Maginness is a surname.

Today the company is led by grandson Stefano Cecchihttps://bebeez.it/2018/05/16/red-fish-kapital-compra-controllo- pistacchio-bronte/http://archivio.panorama.it/archivio/Torino-Con-me-allegra- e-concept. History =1936-1950= In 1936, Gabriello Cecchi moved to Turin. He was originally from Ponte Buggianese, in Tuscany, but he hailed from France, where he learned the art of making gelato from Italian immigrants. Assisted by his wife and his brother, Tancredi, he opened an gelato parlour in Corso Palestro with a seating capacity of 200 and a workshop attached. The business grew quickly, thanks also to his famous crema gialla custard flavour, considered the best in Turin at the time. This particular type of vanilla, a flavour that no one ever managed to reproduce, was Gabriello's jewel in the crown. The glass sign featuring golden italics on an aquamarine background, which dominated the Corso Palestro parlour's shop window ‚Äì Cecchi Gelati Naturali ‚Äì revealed only part of the secret. Gabriello did use top quality ingredients, but it was the formula he used to mix those ingredients that made his gelati so unforgettable. It was a time when gelato was booming; it became a mass consumer good in the postwar years. Gelato recipes were perfected and new ways of eating it were invented. The usual steel cups used for serving it at tables were joined by wafer cones for eating it while strolling along. The three most important brands in Turin were Cecchi, Fiorio and Pepino. Then there were those who didn't have a shop yet and toured the city on a bicycle cart, such as Teofilo Sanson, who sold the gelato his close friend Gabriello provided him with. =1950-1960= At the end of the Second World War ‚Äì during which Gabriello fought alongside the partisans (he was the commander of the 77th Garibaldi Brigade in Italy and the Third International Brigade in Spain) ‚Äì Gelati Cecchi made a giant leap towards industrialisation. The gelato parlour in Corso Palestro was no longer big enough for its ambitious founder, who was in no doubt as to the quality of his products and wished to distribute them beyond the borders of Turin. New machines and technologies became available, hence the first production plant in Via Abate Chanoux was set up: an establishment that initially employed 40 people. Gelati Cecchi produced gelato lollies, cones, sandwiches and tubs. The workshop boasted modern pasteurising and freezing equipment supplied by Cecchi's friends, Bruto and Poerio Carpigiani. A sales network of entrepreneurs was set up, selling and delivering gelato throughout the regions of Piedmont and Liguria. The increase in production was supported by Cecchi's first simple promotional efforts. =1960-1973= In the Sixties, Gabriello Cecchi streamlined the company's structure and focused on industry. He opened a new, modern, 3,000-metre production plant in Vinovo. His son Raimondohttps://www.lastampa.it/2014/12/12/cronaca/addio-allo-storico- presidente-dellesperia-una-vita-tra-fiume-e-impresa- oCdRcguYIhrt809vwxYPxH/pagina.html, fresh out of law school, was now helping him. Gelati Cecchi grew till it employed 300 members of staff and boasted a network of 120 agents who supplied as many as 1,500 points of sale, expanding to cover the whole of northern Italy and part of the French Riviera. The brand was now a market leader and its marketing efforts attempted to find an image that would be more recognizable and up-to-date. This was how Cecchino, the cartoon that helped enliven the company's message, came about. Cecchino decorated the fridges and enamel boards displayed at the entrance to the shops the company supplied and, next to him, customers found the gelati that had now been given their own special names: Capriccio, Canestrino, Secchiello, Mattonella, Graziella, Nobilino, Parigina, Canguro and Mela Cha Cha Cha. The company's communication strategy could not fail to feature sport and Gelati Cecchi linked its name to Pallacanestro Biella,http://www.legabasket.it/news/21582/e_in_tv_giocava_atripaldi which competed in the A1 league and boasted talented players of the calibre of Rudy Bennetthttp://m.pianetabasket.com/palla-a-spicchi/la-scomparsa-di-rudy- bennett-il-gelataio-della-cecchi-biella-24339/ and Charlie Caglieris.http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2010/08/04/piccolo- grande-uomo.html The company once founded by Gabriello ‚Äì who by now had been made a Cavaliere del Lavoro (a knight of the Italian Order of Merit for Labour) ‚Äì had thus become one of the ten biggest Italian gelato companieshttp://www.animamia.net/i-gelati-degli-anni-70/ and joined Motta, Alemagna, Besana, Algida, Chiavacci, Sammontana, Toseroni, Sanson and Tanara in setting up a trade association that was presided over by Raimondo Cecchi for a two-year stint. At the height of its success in the early 1970s and during a general phase of corporate take-overs, Gelati Cecchi was acquired by the Barilla Group through its subsidiary, Tanara, only to become part of the SME Group, alongside Motta and Alemagna. =1973-1993= Gabriello Cecchi became manager of the Italgel Group dealing with research and development. At the beginning of the 1980s a new brand was founded in gourmet cuisine which immediately met with the public's approval: Antica Gelateria del Corso. The Knight has followed the development of the project step by step bringing forth unforgettable products such as the ice cream coconut, the gelato lemon and the famous tartufo (truffle). In 1993, the Italgel group was sold for 475 billion lire to the Swiss multinational food corporation, Nestl√©. The Cecchi family bowed out from the world of gelato forever, except for Silvano Moschinihttps://torino.repubblica.it/cronaca/2020/03/31/news/la_scomparsa_di_silvano_il_mito_del_gelato_artigianale_a_torino-252814438/, the brother of the Knight's wife, Luisa Cecchi, who kept the family tradition alive in his traditional gelato parlour in Via Nizza. And it's thanks to Silvano that the secret of traditional gelato has reached us today; a secret that has brought him international honour and Italian recognition in the Gambero Rosso and Slow Food guides. =2014= Stefano Gabriello Cecchi ‚Äì Raimondo'shttp://www.lastampa.it/2014/12/12/cronaca/addio-allo-storico- presidente-dellesperia-una-vita-tra-fiume-e-impresa- oCdRcguYIhrt809vwxYPxH/pagina.html son and Gabriello's grandson, the founder of a record company, a creator of luxury brands and a global marketing and communication consultant ‚Äì decides to revive Gelati Cecchi using his grandfather's formulashttps://torino.corriere.it/piemonte/20_luglio_30/banco- biraghi-l-ira-stefano-cecchi-piazza-san-carlo-non- mercato-1d2088c8-d294-11ea-9ae0-73704986785b.shtmlhttps://torino.corriere.it/cronaca/20_settembre_08/gelati- cecchi-non-soloal-posto-libri-paravia- ab48934e-f13d-11ea-9f2b-89b4229fc5bf.shtml.

As part of No. 81 Group 55 OTU pilots flew at low level over the Solway Firth training to fly \\"Rhubarb\\" missions, crossing the English Channel to attack targets of opportunity in France and the Low Countries. Initially they flew Hawker Hurricanes; and later, Miles Master trainers and Hawker Typhoon fighter-bombers. In June 1943 55 OTU was transferred to No. 9 Group; and on 26 January 1944 was redesignated No. 4 Tactical Exercise Unit (TEU), then No. 3 TEU on 28 March 1944.

Today, Squale is owned by the Maggi Family, who had previously been distributors of von B√ºren/Squale watches in Italy.  History  Squale was founded by Charles von B√ºren in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland, in 1946 as a manufacturer of watchcases and other components for other watch brands. Originally, the \\"Squale\\" mark appeared on watches as a symbol of the case's origins and pride in its quality. In 1950, von B√ºren S.A./Montres began to produce their own range of professional diving watches under the Squale brand name. These watches were not marketed for jewelry shops but rather specialty dive stores. During the 1960s and 1970s, Squale provided cases for Altanus Gen√®ve, Arlon, Potens Prima, Prima Flic, Jean Perret Geneva, Ocean Diver / Blandford, Deman Watch, Margi, Berio, Eagle Star Gen√®ve, La Spirotechnique, Wertex, Carlson Tavernier Geneva, and Sinn. Cases designed for 500m water resistance with the crown located at the \\"4 o'clock\\" position were sold to Airin, Dodane, Blancpain, Tag Heuer, Doxa, Zeno, and Auricoste. Squale also supplied the parachutists corps \\"Folgore Brigade\\" part of the Italian Airforces (\\"Aeronautica Militare Italiana\\") and the Italian Navy's Diving Corps (\\"Marina Militare Italiana\\") with timepieces during this period. In 1974, Squale entered the watch market as an independent entity. Following the watch industry's \\"quartz crisis\\", Squale halted their production of mechanical watches in order to focus on quartz timepieces in 1989. This led to the creation of the \\"Squale Rambo.\\" Like many watch companies at the time, Squale began to fade from the international watch market. After the retirement of Charles von B√ºren, the Maggi Family, friends to the von B√ºren family and former distributors of von B√ºren/Squale watches in Italy purchased the company. The brand relaunched in 2010 and is now headquartered in Milan, with the watches being made in Grenchen in the Jura valley, Switzerland.  Name and logo  \\"Squale\\" is the French word for \\"shark\\". Its founder, Charles von B√ºren created von B√ºren S.A./Montres in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland, in 1946.

Facade History Construction of the church was begun in 1572 designed by Annibale de‚Äô Lippi of Florence. It stands near the Porta San Matteo, also called di Loreto. The site was chosen because it had housed an aedicule or chapel with the fresco of the Maest√† (1537) painted by Jacopo Santoro da Giuliana, also called Jacopo Siculo. After the earthquake of 1571, veneration of the image increased. Many claimed the image had miraculous movements of the eyes causing the seismic events to stop. A church was thus erected around the image. The church was built in an unusual nearly symmetric Greek cross layout. The entrance portal was completed in 1662. The interior had a number of canvases by Giovanni Baglione, but these are now in the town art gallery. The interior houses the chapel of the Maest√†, paralleling the englobed Santa Casa di Loreto.Comune of Spoleto, entry on church, quoting L‚ÄôUmbria, Manuali per il Territorio, Spoleto, Roma 1978; G.

For the first time since Reconstruction, African Americans were able to visit the polls in large numbers, giving their own candidates a chance at office. Charles City County was 75% African American, and on November 7, 1967, the county elected an African American sheriff (Bradby) and county clerk (Iona W.

Bradby and Adkins took office on January 1, 1968. At the time, Bradby was one of only two African American sheriffs in the entire United States. Friends reported that Bradby felt intense pressure to represent his race in his new position, and became despondent at what he saw as his failure to live up to the challenge. On Sunday, March 24, 1968, he left his home and died by suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, running a hose from his tailpipe into his car. He was 38 years old. The possibility of foul play was ruled out by the lack of marks on his body, the fact that the hose and masking tape he had used to seal the car came from his own garage, the fact that the car was tightly sealed from the inside, and by the lack of Ku Klux Klan activity in the mostly African-American county. Bradby was remembered as a conscientious and well-liked sheriff despite the brevity of his tenure, including by his predecessor M.D. Lampkin.

It is located near the main street of the city, the ancient Cassaro, in the quarter of the Kalsa, within the historic centre of Palermo. The building represents the main Conventual Franciscan church of Sicily. It has the title of Minor basilica.  History  The history of the church starts with the arrival of the first Franciscans in Sicily. In 1224 the chronicler Vadingo reported the groundwork of the first Franciscan convent near the Walls of Palermo. However, shortly after, the local clergy with the support of the Saracens chased the friars out from the city. The friars went to Viterbo and appealed to the Pope Gregory IX. The pontiff ordered Landone, archbishop of Messina, to promote the reconstruction of the convent. In this way the pope took advantage of the absence of Berard of Castagna, archbishop of Palermo gone to Germany with the Emperor Frederick II. Therefore, in 1235 the friars built a new convent by converting an old Byzantine fortification dating back to the military campaign of George Maniakes. In 1239, because of quarrels with the Pope, Frederick II decreed the building's destruction. In 1255 the Vicar general of Sicily Ruffino Gorgone da Piacenza, chaplain of Pope Alexander IV, entrusted the reconstruction to the bishop of Malta, Roger. The work went on during the period of Charles of Anjou. In 1302 the main portal and the anterior fa√ßade were built, both in Chiaramontan-Gothic style. In the 15th century several chapels were built in Gothic and Renaissance style, including the Chapel Mastrantonio, the first manifestation of the Renaissance in Sicily. Over the centuries the church became rich of artworks thanks to artists like Antonio di Belguardo, Antonio Scaglione, Giuseppe Giacalone, Francesco Laurana, Pietro de Bonitate, Gabriele di Battista, Domenico Pellegrino, Iacopo de Benedetto, Domenico Gagini, Antonello Gagini, Antonio Gagini, Giacomo Gagini, Giuliano Mancino, Antonio Berrettaro, Antonello Crescenzio, Cesare da Sesto, Mariano Smiriglio, Vincenzo degli Azani, Pietro Novelli, Gerardo Astorino and Giacomo Serpotta. As a result, the church represents a mix of different styles, mainly Gothic and Sicilian Baroque. On 5 March 1823 the building was damaged by an earthquake. The church was restored in the Neoclassical style. Other damages were caused by the air raids during the Second world war. In recent decades the church was restored. In 1924 Pope Pius XI gave the title of Minor basilica to this building. The church of Saint Francis of Assisi has an important role in the religious life of Palermo: in fact, in this church is enshrined the Simulacrum of the Immaculate Conception that every year, on the evening of December 8, pass through the streets of the historic center among thousands of believers who accompany the procession till the Piazza San Domenico.Church of St. Francis of Assisi Palermo on siciliandays.com  Gallery  File:Palermo-AP-p1070665.jpgPortal File:SF PA 11.JPGChapel of the Immaculate Conception File:SF PA 07.JPGChapel of Saint Francis File:SF PA 12.JPGChapel of Saint George File:SF PA 05.JPGChapel Mastrantonio File:SF PA 14.JPGSimulacrum of the Immaculate Conception  See also  * Kalsa * Oratorio di San Lorenzo * Oratorio dell'Immacolatella  References   External links  * History of the convent - Conventual Franciscans of Sicily Francesco Francesco Assisi Category:Gothic architecture in Palermo Category:Franciscan churches Francis Palermo Category:Minor basilicas in Sicily ","title":"San Francesco d'Assisi, Palermo"},{"id":"50541120","title":"Casi (song)"},{"id":"50541123","text":"Hibo Wardere is a Somali-born campaigner against female genital mutilation (FGM), author, and public speaker. Born in Somalia, she moved to London, England when just a teenager in 1989, as a refugee fleeing the Somali Civil War. She currently resides in Walthamstow, London, where she worked as a mediator and a regular FGM educator for Waltham Forest Borough. Her testimonials and campaigning work have made her one of Britain's most prominent campaigners about FGM and she has appeared in numerous publications, including the Telegraph, the BBC, and The Guardian.  Early life  Hibo Wardere was born in Somalia. At the age of six, she was the victim of type 3 FGM, an event she has described as \\"being engulfed in pain from head to toe\\". Every day for the next ten years, she sought answers from her mother, but was always denied a response. When Wardere was 16, she finally struck a deal with a relative, who promised to tell her everything about what happened after her wedding night. She was horrified by the revelations, and soon fled to London after the civil war broke out in the 1980s.  Activism  When she arrived in London, Wardere sought treatment for her wounds, but received little support from the NHS. Doctors failed to ask what had happened to her, and only rarely mentioned FGM on her medical files, even when she gave birth to her children. Wardere eventually found the answers she was looking for at the library, where she read about female mutilation in a book. Years later, when she was studying to become a teaching assistant, she opened up about her story in a homework essay. The head of staff read her work and asked her to deliver a speech to 120 teachers, during which some realised that their students might have experienced the same trauma. After reading Wardere‚Äôs essay, school governor Clare Coghill booked Wardere appointments with other schools in the area. Wardere has worked as a mediator and FGM educator since then, helping young students escape FGM. She also delivers awareness raising sessions to doctors and the Police to assist in their understanding of FGM. Her testimonies have appeared in numerous publications, including the BBC, the Guardian and the Telegraph. Wardere has advised that as an FGM survivor, she is aware many other women who have undergone the practice feel too ashamed to speak out about their suffering. Wardere is quoted as saying ‚ÄúIt is a sexual abuse. It brings shame and rips women and girls of their dignity. It should be stopped\\". Wardere's main ambition for the future is to see Female Genital Mutilation eradicated in her lifetime. Her memoir, Cut, was published in April 2016.  Personal life  Hibo Wardere lives with her husband Yusuf and their seven children.

It has historically been used by the Mevlevi Order and now serves as a museum. It is one of the most important historical and religious buildings in the island. It is located next to the Kyrenia Gate, on Girne Avenue, in the ƒ∞brahimpa≈üa quarter.  History  = Functioning as a tekke = It is traditionally held that the building was built in the early 17th century, on a piece of land donated by a landlady called Emine Hatun. This Emine Hatun hailed from the village of Kyra, where she owned a farm. It is rumoured by the locals that she is buried in a grave without any inscriptions, located to the northeast of the tomb in the tekke. According to another view, the tekke is located on land donated by Arab Ahmed Pasha and Haydar Pa≈üazade Fatma Hanƒ±m. According to the Evkaf Administration, the tekke was initially built in 1593 by Arab Ahmed Pasha on a plot of land owned by him and then enlarged into a complex using land donated by Emine Hatun. According to documents from Ottoman archives from 1593, a mevlevi tekke named after Arab Ahmed Pasha, built on a plot of land donated by him, was built near Kyrenia Gate. This tekke was ruined by 1607 and Ferhad Pasha built a mevlevi tekke on its foundations and named it after him in 1607. The present-day tekke is a continuation of this one. A document from 1857 mentions the addition of an administrative building to the tekke, which oversaw the needs of the poor at the time. The sheikh of the tekke was under the jurisdiction of the central administration in Konya, while Kutup Osman Tekke in Famagusta, Mehmet Bey Ebubekir Tekke and Mehmet Buba Tekke in Paphos and Piri Osman Tekke in Limassol were amongst the ones responding to Nicosia. As of 1873, there were 36 members of the tekke and rituals were conducted on Sundays. When tekkes in Turkey were closed as a part of Atat√ºrk's Reforms in 1925, some in the Turkish Cypriot community demanded the closure of the tekke. However, the British disregarded this, and as the centre of the Mevlevi Order had moved from Konya to Aleppo, it decided to appoint Syrian sheikhs. The first such sheikh was Muhammed Selim Dede from Damascus, appointed on 6 December 1933 and paid ¬£48 by the colonial government, in the place of Mehmed Cel√¢leddin Efendi, who had died in 1931. Selim Dede would hold this position until his death on 9 December 1953 and was replaced by Hafƒ±z ≈ûefik Efendi. However, as those who were appointed after Selim Dede were either workers or civil servants who could not serve as sheikh continually, the tekke ceased operation in 1954, with the Mevlevi Order in Cyprus officially ceasing to exist on 15 April 1956, with the handover of Evkaf Administration to the Turkish Cypriot community. = List of sheikhs = The following incomplete list of sheikhs of the tekke was compiled by archaeologist Tuncer Baƒüƒ±≈ükan, according to the mentions in Ottoman archives: * Saadeddin ƒ∞bn Muharrem (1607) * Siyahi Mustafa Dede (?‚Äì1710) * El-Ha√ß Mehmet Sadri Dede (1719‚Äì?) * Hƒ±zƒ±r Dede (Handi Dede) Efendi (?‚Äì1727) * Mehmet Arif Dede (1727‚Äì1765) * Seyid Abdullah Dede (1765) * Mustafa Dede (1765‚Äì1766) * Feyzullah Dede (1813‚Äì1850/51) * Mustafa Safvet Efendi (1850/51‚Äì1857) * Konyalƒ± ≈ûeyh Dervi≈ü Ali Dede (29 April 1857‚Äì9 December 1860) * Mustafa Safvet Efendi (9 December 1860‚Äì1894) * ≈ûeyh Mehmet Cel√¢leddin Efendi (20 September 1893‚Äì22 September 1931) * ≈ûamlƒ± Selim Dede (6 December 1933‚Äì9 December 1953) * Hafƒ±z ≈ûefik Efendi  Architecture  The building is an important example of Ottoman architecture in the urban fabric of Nicosia. The current surviving buildings are the semahane, used for the whirling rituals of sama, the tomb, and a few rooms to the east of the semahane, along with a small backyard. The initial tekke contained rooms for dervishes, guestrooms, a kitchen, a well dated to the Venetian times and a large garden with fruit trees, but these buildings were ruinous by the 1950s and demolished to make room for Vakƒ±flar Pasajƒ±, a business centre. The garden was also mostly taken up by this new building.

The organization published pamphlets. It also lobbied members of the California State Assembly. It promoted American patriotism, and it warned the public against communism. Furthermore, it argued the United States Constitution should not be amended. In the workplace, the organization was opposed to labor unions and regulations. Moreover, it promoted a six-day workweek and it rejected the minimum wage. In schools, it warned against \\"bolshevik\\" authors like Edward Alsworth Ross, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr. and David Saville Muzzey used in textbooks. They also objected to Garfield Bromley Oxnam joining a school board. Moreover, it was opposed to \\"compulsory education beyond the age of 14\\". One of its successes was to ban The Nation and The New Republic from public schools in California. Some scholars have suggested the organization has influenced conservative politics in California to this day.

The park is surrounded by sidewalks on 3 sides. The entrance, located on the side bordering 6th Street, has a metal archway. The sidewalks bisect sidewalks and lead towards a hill in the center on which there stands a monument to those who are buried on the grounds. The monument lists of the names of the identifiable dead buried on the grounds, along with a brief history of the grounds, and a note commemorating the Laboring Sons Memorial Committee and the City of Frederick for their work to restore the grounds.  History  = Establishment and decline = The Laboring Sons Beneficial Society was founded in 1837 \\"for the purpose of relieving or alleviating both spiritually and temporally any member of us who may be distressed and to see that his mortal remains be interred with decency.\\" It would not see official incorporation though until 1867, when the Maryland General Assembly passed an act incorporating it. Its membership consisted of both free and enslaved blacks from Frederick; free blacks at the time numbered around 790 or about 16% of the city's population. They established the cemetery, purchasing 1.17 acres of land for $265, located between 5th and 6th Street on Chapel Alley, in the Historic District of Frederick, in 1851. At the time there were few cemeteries in which blacks could be buried in the city, and even in those the amount of available space was limited. In 1852, a quarter of the cemetery was divided in 12 foot by 16 foot plots with white marble corner posts. As time went on the remainder of the grounds were sold off as burial plots in order to fund the society's activities. In 1862 half of the Laboring Sons Beneficial Society split off into the Workingmen's Society due to disagreements within the group. By 1949 the cemetery had an estimated 1,500 bodies buried in it, but there was nobody left to care for the grounds, and they had deteriorated. A photo in a 1948 newspaper showed the cemetery covered in weeds and underbrush. Garland Makel Jr., grandson of one of the last of the society's officials, said, \\"There was nobody left to take care of it any more, everybody with any connection to the place had died or moved away.\\" After a special meeting of the lot holders in Laboring Sons that took place on 1 October 1948, they gave the grounds to the City of Frederick, who in turn, promised to restore the grounds to their original condition. The agreement proposed to the city, which the city accepted, was: that the city would maintain the land as a public park and playground with the name Laboring Sons Memorial Park, that no further burials would be permitted unless the city decided to allow a black hero, scientist, artist, or athlete to be buried, that a monument be erected, that the park would be open to colored residents of the city, all the monuments and stones currently in the cemetery would be left undisturbed, and that the city would fund a study regarding juvenile delinquency amongst the colored youth and propose solutions to fix it. The memorial tablet that the city had promised to erect was never erected. Instead of restoring the grounds, in 1949 the city removed the remaining grave stones and headstones from the cemetery. Newspapers at the time reported that some of the remains in the cemetery were disturbed. The workmen buried some of the headstones to provide a smooth surface for laying black-top. The city then covered the grounds in black-top, added recreational equipment (such as swings and a basketball court) and converted the grounds into a whites-only park which they named Chapel Park. During the construction, a list of the names of those interred at the site began to be compiled, but was stopped after reaching only 161 names. Municipal workers who helped move the grave stones underground said that they had just done as they were told and that no bodies had been moved. Makel also said that no bodies were removed from the site, but an official from Fairview Cemetery has said that some of the bodies were moved to Fairview Cemetery. Lord Nickens, a well known civil rights activist in Frederick, also claims that some of the bodies were removed and moved to Fairview Cemetery. The city has no record of any objections at the time to what was done to the cemetery. William O. Lee Jr. speculated that most people who had living descendants probably had their remains moved to Fairview Cemetery and that those who remained had nobody to object for them. For some time after this the original use of the grounds was forgotten. = Rediscovery = In the 1990s a Frederick resident, Jackie Berry, decided to research her great-great-uncle's burial location. His death certificate stated he was buried in Laboring Sons Cemetery. She made the connection that Laboring Sons Park might be the location of Laboring Sons Cemetery. Around the same time former alderman Bill Lee and Bernard Brown, grand master of the Black Elks Lodge, were urging the city to acknowledge what had happened and make amends. In 1999 the City of Frederick decided to rename all of the alleys in the city, with a particular emphasis on naming them after historical prominent black citizens. The Gazette heard about the grounds because a local resident, living near Chapel Park, suggested that Chapel Alley ought to be named Laboring Sons Alley in recognition of Laboring Sons Beneficial Society and in memory of those buried under the park. The article, run in the Gazette in 2000, helped bolster support for restoring the grounds. A newspaper reporter noticed that, on an old map in city hall, the grounds were labeled \\"Colored Cemetery\\" dispelling the idea that the city may have destroyed the grounds out of ignorance of their purpose. In January 2000 the board of alderman unanimously promised to make amends and honor those buried on the grounds with a plaque. In February 2000, a retired engineer, who remembered when the incident happened, and had worked on the grounds, and helped record the names of those interred there, showed city officials a map of the cemetery along with a partial list of names of those interred, allowing them to discover the location of the graves within the site. These documents put an end to speculation about whether or not there were any dead buried under the site. After the names were found the plans for the plaque were changed from a plaque simply describing the history of the grounds to a plaque that would also list the names of those buried there. A committee was formed in June 2000 to research the site and plan a memorial. An archaeologist company in Frederick volunteered to do a remote sensing on the grounds for free and found 10 possible burial shafts in two areas of the park. The committee suggested to the city that it remove all recreational equipment from the site, remove the asphalt, erect a monument with the names, birth dates, and death dates of those interred, along with a description of the site, create paths and benches on the sites that were not over identified graves, build another play area in the community, and rededicate the location as Laboring Sons Memorial Park. = Restoration = Work on the memorial was fraught with \\"delay and inaction\\" for two and a half years after the committee issued its suggestions. Roelky Myers, director of parks and recreation for Frederick in 2003, said that the committee the city set up for the memorial were unaware that they would have to go through the Historic District Commission, leading to delays. In the week leading up to 13 September 2002 the Frederick Historic District Commission approved the basic design of the memorial park along with the design of the 4 foot tall and 11 foot wide granite monument to be erected there. The city's director of historic preservation, Barbara Wyatt, volunteered to design a memorial park to put on the site, and to champion the effort. William O. Lee Jr., a member of the committee formed in 2000, said, \\"Without her we wouldn't be this far\\". The design for the park evolved from a simple design with some benches and paths to a much more elaborate setup with trees, bisecting pathways, and retaining walls that are short enough to sit on. City officials promised to rename it Laboring Sons. The city earmarked $40,000 of federal grant money for restoration of the park. Another $60,000 was acquired from a combination of donations and the city's capital improvement program. Jennifer Dougherty, who was elected mayor of Frederick in 2002, promised during her campaign that she would restore the grounds, saying that, \\"It seems logical to say a burial ground should never become something other than a burial ground, or at least a place of honor.\\" When she was elected Mayor she approved work to identify those who were buried in the grounds and made work on the grounds one of her priorities. Construction of the memorial park was hindered by the discovery of bodies and having to bring in \\"copious amounts of dirt\\" in order to cover them. The dirt was used so that any construction would happen on the new top layer of soil and the bodies interred would remain undisturbed. As work was done on the site the State's Attorney was notified anytime that a new body was found. In 2001 the site was dedicated as a memorial garden and the name changed to Laboring Sons Memorial Ground; in 2003, on the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr., the site was rededicated as a memorial ground and a plaque was erected listing the names of the 117 people known to be buried there. A second re-dedication ceremony was done on 20 June 2003 when construction on the site had finished  References  Category:Cemeteries in Maryland Category:Historic sites in Maryland Category:Monuments and memorials in Maryland Category:African-American cemeteries ","title":"Laboring Sons Memorial Grounds"},{"id":"50541252","text":"Jeptha Root Simms Jeptha Root Simms (December 31, 1807 ‚Äì May 31, 1883) was an American historian best known for chronicling the settlement of upstate New York. Personal life Jeptha Root Simms was born at Canterbury, Connecticut on December 31, 1807, son of Joseph Simms and the former Phoebe Fitch. His family moved to Plainfield, New York in 1824. He married April 1, 1833, to Catherine Lawyer of Schoharie, New York. He died May 31, 1883 in Fort Plain, New York, age 75. Education Mr. Simms was largely self-educated. He became an acknowledged authority on the history and geology of upstate New York through years of personal interviews with the region‚Äôs oldest surviving residents and collecting fossils and mineral samples. The interviews became the backbone of his subsequent writings, while his geological collection was eventually purchased by the State of New York for $5,000 (an impressive sum at the time). Career As a young man, Simms worked at Canajoharie, New York, but removed to New York City in 1829. A few years later, he returned to upstate New York and began compiling his collection of historical material while working as a railroad ticket agent.

ConAgra Foods, Inc., 577 U.S. ___ (2016), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States clarified rules for determining whether a federal court may exercise diversity jurisdiction in cases involving unincorporated organizations.Americold Realty Trust v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., No. 14‚Äì1382, 577 U.S. ___, slip op. at 1, 4 (2016) (internal quotations omitted). The case began as a contract dispute between food producers and a warehouse owner when millions of tons of stored food were destroyed in a warehouse fire.Americold, slip op. at 1; Amy Howe, Trusts and citizenship: It is an easy question for the Court, (Mar. 7, 2016) (noting that \\"millions of tons\\" of food were destroyed). A federal trial court initially ruled in favor of the warehouse owner, but on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled that the federal district court may not have had jurisdiction.Americold, slip op. at 2. The Tenth Circuit held that the warehouse owner, a real estate investment trust (\\"REIT\\"), should be treated as an unincorporated organization and the district court should not be allowed to exercise diversity jurisdiction without examining the citizenship of the members of the real estate investment trust. The warehouse owner appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to resolve a circuit split \\"regarding the citizenship of unincorporated entities.\\" Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor held that for the purposes of diversity jurisdiction, the citizenship of a real estate investment trust should be determined by the citizenship of its shareholders when the real estate investment trust is \\"held and managed for the benefit and profit of any person who may become a shareholder\\".Americold, slip op. at 1‚Äì4, 6 (internal quotations omitted). Although some commentators have suggested that the Court's ruling is \\"unlikely to have any broad or long-term impact\\",Ronald Mann, Opinion analysis: Justices choose bright-line rule limiting diversity jurisdiction over business trusts, (Mar. 7, 2016). others have stated that the Court's ruling \\"means that REITs like Americold will have a much harder time getting (or keeping) their cases in federal court.\\"Amy Howe, Trusts and citizenship: It is an easy question for the Court, (Mar. 7, 2016). Background =Federal diversity jurisdiction= United States district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, but a federal statute permits district courts to hear cases when the parties are citizens of different states.. This form of jurisdiction is known as \\"diversity jurisdiction\\".See generally George W. Ball, Revision of Federal Diversity Jurisdiction, 28 356 (1933). In the mid-nineteenth century, the Supreme Court has clarified that for the purposes of determining citizenship, a corporation should be considered a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated.See . Congress later codified this rule in statute and also expanded this definition so that corporations are also considered citizens of the state in which that corporation operates its primary place of business.Americold, slip op. at 3 (citing 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1332(c) (1958 ed.)). However, for unincorporated entities, the citizenship of those entities is determined by the citizenship of its members.Carden v. Arkoma Associates, . When individuals own stock in an unincorporated organization, the shareholders function as the \\"members\\" of that organization.See Carden, 494 U.S. at 189‚Äì90. =Initial lawsuit and appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit= The case began as a contract dispute that arose when food owned by ConAgra Foods and other corporations was destroyed in a 1991 underground warehouse fire in Kansas City, Kansas.Americold, slip op. at 1. The corporations sued the warehouse's owner, which is now known as Americold Realty Trust, in a state court in Kansas. The case was later removed to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, and the district court ultimately ruled in favor of Americold. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that district court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. The parties argued that the district court could assert diversity jurisdiction in this case because the parties were citizens of different states, but the Tenth Circuit disagreed. The Tenth Circuit held that the citizenship of the corporate plaintiffs should be determined according to \\"where they were chartered and had their principal places of business\\", but that Americold (a real estate investment trust) should be considered a citizen of every state in which its shareholders were citizens. Because there was \\"no record of the citizenship of Americold‚Äôs shareholders\\", the Tenth Circuit ruled that the parties had failed to prove they were citizens of different states. Americold appealed the Tenth Circuit's ruling, and the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari to resolve a circuit split \\"regarding the citizenship of unincorporated entities.\\" Opinion of the Court In a unanimous opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor declined to remove the \\"doctrinal wall between corporate and unincorporated entities.\\"Americold, slip op. at 6 (citing Carden, 494 U.S. at 190) (internal citations omitted). Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor held that real estate investment trusts, as defined by Maryland law, should be treated like other unincorporated entities when determining diversity jurisdiction.Americold, slip op. at 3. Consequently, Justice Sotomayor ruled that \\"diversity jurisdiction in a suit by or against the entity depends on the citizenship of all its members.\\"Americold, slip op. at 3 (citing Carden v. Arkoma Associates, ) (internal quotations and modifications omitted). Because Maryland real estate investment trusts are unincorporated organizations \\"in which property is held and managed for the benefit and profit of any person who may become a shareholder‚Äù, Justice Sotomayor explained that shareholders of Maryland real estate investment trusts \\"appear to be in the same position as the shareholders of a joint-stock company or the partners of a limited partnership ‚Äî both of whom we viewed as members of their relevant entities.\\"Americold, slip op. at 3 (citing Md. Corp. & Assns. Code Ann. ¬ß¬ß 8‚Äì704(b)(5), 8‚Äì101(d) (2014)) (internal quotations omitted). Therefore, for the purposes of determining whether diversity of citizenship exists, Justice Sotomayor held that \\"Americold‚Äôs members include its shareholders.\\"Americold, slip op. at 4. Commentary and analysis In his analysis of the case for SCOTUSblog, Ronald Mann wrote that the case \\"seems most unlikely to have any broad or long-term impact\\" and that the \\"most likely fate\\" of the case \\"is an occasional appearance in the footnotes of casebooks and treatises on federal courts.\\" Mann also observed that \\"Chief Justice John Roberts has not yet assigned any major opinions to Sotomayor, and this case leaves that pattern intact.\\" Amy Howe also wrote that the Court's ruling \\"means that REITs like Americold will have a much harder time getting (or keeping) their cases in federal court.\\" See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases * Lists of United States Supreme Court cases by volume * List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Roberts Court Notes References External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:2016 in United States case law Category:Conagra Brands Category:Diversity jurisdiction case law Category:History of Kansas City, Kansas ","title":"Americold Realty Trust v.

Lubin was born in 1876 in Sacramento, California. His father, David Lubin, and his half-uncle, Harris Weinstock, co-founded Lubin and Weinstock, \\"the largest department store in Sacramento, California\\". Lubin was educated at the Sacramento High School, graduating in 1895. He received a bachelor of arts degree from Harvard University in 1903.

Moreover, Groth adds that Governor Hiram Johnson took Lubin's work seriously in light of the fact that the construction of the Panama Canal would inevitably lead to higher immigration levels from Eastern Europeans looking for work. Lubin served as the president of the Pan-American Institute of Reciprocal Trade. Personal life, death and legacy Lubin married Rebecca Cohen.

The case revolved around using the TV show Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi as a basis for a Tide detergent commercial and whether this violated copyright law.  Facts of the case  Star India was the owner of the copyright in the serial Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu thi's theme and artistic work with which the title appeared on TV according to Clause 6 of the agreement between Star India and Balaji Telefilms. Producers and Marketers of Tide detergent (the defendants) came up with the advertisement for Procter & Gamble showing a scene resembling climax of the TV show and displaying the artistic work appearing on TV with the words \\"kyunki bahu bhi kabhi saas banegi\\" Star alleged that people will think that Star licensed or produced the advertisement. Also, Star paid a sum of money to acquire the copyright and Tide was alleged to be trying to encash upon Star's goodwill. Defendants alleged that they independently created the advertisement. Further, it was the idea that was used and ideas are not copyrightable. The commercial was submitted to Star who did not find it objectionable. No average person would make the connect between the show and the ad. Lastly they argued that even if it is a copy, it is not a substantial copy. Star replied saying that it copied the heart of the TV show, i.e. the climax episode.  Decision of Bombay High Court  High Court in this case stated that copy under Section 14 of the Copyright Act meant a physical copy. However, the plaintiffs in this case made a separate work. This was a material alteration as a completely different. The court looked at the similarities and dissimilarities between the show and the ad by comparing the entire show (87hours) with the 30 second advertisement. The work in question was held to be a \\"cinematographic film\\" under the Copyright Act. Any prudent person will not confuse between the two. Further, there was no scope for misrepresentation as the ad was aired on channels different from where Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu thi was aired so there was not effect of the ad on the show and the likelihood of damage was too remote. As far as passing off action is concerned, the court held that there was no common field of activity. Further court held that \\"state of mind of the public\\" was necessary to see the goodwill of the characters in the TV soap. There was no material on record to show that people will associate the ad with the show.  See also  * Procter & Gamble Co. v.

J.\\") Stephenson (1920-1997) was a trapper, naturalist, and self-taught artist from Garysburg, North Carolina. He is known for his \\"Occoneechee Trapper's Lodge\\" (or \\"Trapper's Lodge Museum\\"), a natural history museum and art environment in Garysburg.  Biography  Q. J. Stephenson was born in 1920 in Garysburg, North Carolina. The son of a traveling salesman, Stephenson grew up in the lean years of the Great Depression, trapping muskrat, mink, and raccoons in the woods and selling their pelts to Sears & Roebuck. In his teenage years, he would travel to northern California with the Civilian Conservation Corps, an experience that he would later credit with his interest in and love of nature. When he returned home, he operated a crane with a dragline, which led to the unexpected discovery of fossils, petrified wood, Civil War artifacts, and other relics from the North Carolina environment. Through the donation of some of these objects, Stephenson developed a relationship with the Smithsonian Institution. In the 1950s, out of concern that younger generations were not properly learning traditional naturalist and trapping methods, Stephenson began an artistic endeavor that spanned 50 years of production and manifested itself in the Occoneechee Trapper's Lodge and his self-termed \\"Prehistoric Art.\\" In 1997, Stephenson died in Garysburg.  Occoneechee Trapper's Lodge  The Occoneechee Trapper's Lodge is a natural history museum and art environment created by Stephenson to illustrate local natural history features and impart his own personal philosophies and knowledge. The construction process involved the gradual accretion of sculptures, fossils, shells, petrified wood, and other found objects, which adorned a small cement and wood building on his property. Stephenson covered much of the external surface of the building with cast cement plates, each embellished with mosaics of natural particulates and imprinted with written philosophies, histories, lessons, and didactic labels. Some of these plates are hung from brackets on the walls, while others are embedded directly into the cement foundation which spills out into the surrounding landscape. Cypress knees are affixed to the overhanging ledges and jut up from the surrounding grounds, resembling stalagmites and stalactites in a cave. The interior of the lodge is also encrusted with similar panels and assemblages, although more vibrant and untouched by the external elements. In the 1970s, Stephenson began producing \\"Prehistoric Art,\\" creating fantastic creatures from his imagination out of cement and found objects. He would position these sculptures in and around the Trapper's Lodge to amuse himself and visitors. In addition to the lodge building, Stephenson constructed other smaller works on the property in the same creative method and style. These include a windmill, table and bench, bell, and planter. Pieces made by Stephenson and fragments from the environment have made their way into several public and private collections, one notable example being the Smithsonian American Art Museum. As of 2016, the Occoneechee Trapper's Lodge still exists on Stephenson's property in Garysburg. However, natural and man-made destruction has led to noticeable degradation and loss of the environment.  External links  * Q. J. Stephenson in the SPACES Archives * Q. J.

Biography His father was a well-to-do craftsman who had emigrated from Austria. He began his art studies at the Warsaw Lyceum with Zygmunt Vogel and Marcello Bacciarelli. In 1817, he enrolled with the Faculty of Fine Arts at the University of Warsaw.Brief biography @ the Internetowy Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny. Later, he received government scholarships that enabled him to study in Vienna and Rome; sending back paintings for exhibitions in Warsaw. Initially, he sent copies of works by Titian and Correggio but, by 1825, was sending original compositions, including renditions of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço marrying Jadwiga and the blind Oedipus being led by Antigone. After his scholarships expired in 1830, he remained in Rome at his own expense. He returned to Poland in 1834 and, three years later, married a painter named Amelia Lepig√©, who he had met at an art auction. At that time, he began to specialize in portraits. Some of his notable sitters included Maria Szymanowska and General Jan Zygmunt Skrzynecki. Later, he also painted religious works; notably an \\"Adoration of the Magi\\" for St. John's Archcathedral (destroyed in 1944). Many of his works were, in fact, lost or destroyed during the Second World War. In the late 1830s, he did restorative work at the gallery in ≈Åazienki Palace. He was also an avid art collector and owned works by Raphael, Rubens and Rembrandt. In 1844, a major exhibit of his collection took place in Saint Petersburg. In 1836, he established his own art school, which he operated until 1848, when he and his wife emigrated to Italy in the wake of the Greater Poland Uprising. After that, he apparently cut off all ties with Poland and seems to have focused on collecting art and antiquities, rather than painting.

The Governing Body usually meets twice each year to receive reports, discuss issues concerning the church and make decisions on matters brought before it. History The Church in Wales was created in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914. It came about as a result of a desire by the Welsh people to be led by Welsh bishops and to be able to worship in their own language. It is not only a disestablished church but also a disendowed church. It became an independent province of the Anglican Communion. It adopted a written constitution and elected a Governing Body which at first used to meet once a year, but now meets twice annually. The Governing Body has ultimate authority \\"to approve liturgies, review organizational structures, and secure firm fiscal resources for the mission and ministry of the church\\". The Church in Wales was one of the first members of the Anglican Communion to adopt synodical government. The Governing Body The Governing Body of the Church in Wales is tricameral and consists of three orders of participants; the first order is the House of Bishops, which includes all six bishops from the six dioceses in the archbishopric; the second is the House of Clergy, which includes fifty-one clerical representatives who are elected at diocesan level; the third is the House of Laity, which includes eighty-six non-clerical representatives from the parishes of the archbishopric, again elected at diocesan level. The chairman and vice-chairman of the Representative Body of the Church in Wales are ex-officio members and other persons can be co-opted to cover their areas of expertise. The total membership of the Governing Body is one hundred and forty-three persons.

Wurts, Pedigrees of the Barons (1942), Philadelphia: Brookfield, [1945], repr. 1964, , p. 2777. (September 8, 1866 ‚Äì December 31, 1946) was an architect who worked in the Bay Area of California, particularly in San Francisco. He primarily designed houses but was also responsible for some Christian Science churches and commercial and government buildings. Early life and training Edgar Mathews was born in Oakland, the third son of Julius Case Mathews and his wife Pauline, n√©e McCracken. His father was an architect and all three sons trained with him; the eldest, Walter, went into partnership with him, while the second, Arthur, became an artist. Edgar received further training at the Van Der Naillen School of Engineering, from which he graduated in 1888, and after working for his father and others, opened his own architectural office in 1895. He moved to San Francisco soon after, and most of his work was built there.David Parry, \\"Mathews, Edgar A.: Architect\\" , Encyclopedia of San Francisco, republished from \\"Pacific Heights Architects #3 - Edgar Mathews\\", Classic SF Properties, May 2001 (pdf), retrieved May 14, 2016. Career 2508 Green Street (1895) Mathews designed a large number of houses, particularly in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco, where in 1908 he built 2980 Vallejo Street for himself and his wife, Katherine n√©e Dart. He drew on English arts and crafts conventions:Richard Longstreth, On the Edge of the World: Four Architects in San Francisco at the Turn of the Century, American Monograph Series, The Architectural History Foundation, Cambridge, Massachusetts / London: MIT, 1983, , pp. 306‚Äì07. his houses are often in a half-timbered style with high- pitched roofs suggesting English Tudor, and even more often squarish and clad in unpainted redwood shingles.John Beach, \\"The Bay Area Tradition, 1890‚Äì1918\\", in Bay Area Houses, ed. Sally Woodbridge, rev. ed. Salt Lake City, Utah: Gibbs Smith, 1988, , pp. 64, 68. He also designed apartment houses, usually in the shingled style. Both his houses and his apartments usually have porches and a low wall around the lot; his apartment buildings characteristically have separate entrances for each unit. His work is the primary reason for Pacific Heights' reputation for shingle-style buildings. In San Francisco, houses by Mathews include 2361 Washington Street (1898, for William Gerstle) and 2421 Pierce Street (1897\\"2421 Pierce St., San Francisco\\", Business, San Francisco Chronicle, September 2, 2009. or c. 1903, for James Irvine), both in the Tudor style,Anne and Arthur Bloomfield, Gables and Fables: A Portrait of San Francisco's Pacific Heights, Berkeley, California: Heyday, 2007, , pp. 94, 148. and 2505 Divisadero Street (1899), former home of rock musician Kirk Hammett, in Georgian style.Anna Marie Erwert, \\"Pac Heights mansion, once home to Metallica‚Äôs Kirk Hammett, rocks the MLS\\", On the Block blog, San Francisco Chronicle, May 25, 2015.

Third Church of Christ, Scientist, San Francisco (1917) 447 Sutter Street, San Francisco, designed by Mathews for PG&E; in 1916 As a Christian Scientist, Mathews was commissioned to design the First Church of Christ, Scientist in San Francisco (1912); for this and again for the similar Third Church of Christ, Scientist (1917) he used a Byzantine-Romanesque style in variegated brick with polychrome terracotta decoration.Paul Eli Ivey, Prayers in Stone: Christian Science Architecture in the United States, 1894‚Äì1930, Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois, 1999, , pp. 56‚Äì57. Writing in The Architectural Review, William Winthrop Kent singled the Third Church out for special praise.William Winthrop Kent, \\"The New San Francisco: Part III: Churches and Clubs\\", The Architectural Review, 8 (1919) 127‚Äì28.

Later in his career, Mathews was a proponent of Renaissance revival architecture; an example of his commercial designs in this style is the highly ornamented 447 Sutter Street (1916), for Pacific Gas and Electric.Cerny, Guidebook, p. 28. He also designed government buildings in Sacramento; in 1919 he won the $500 prize in the competition to design a new courthouse for Santa Barbara, but it remained unbuilt for lack of funds, and after the 1925 earthquake, a design by William Mooser, the second-place entrant, was built instead.Neal Graffy, Historic Santa Barbara: An Illustrated History, San Antonio, Texas: Historical Publication Network, 2010, , p. 72. The base of Douglas Tilden's 1907 monument to Padre Junipero Serra in Golden Gate Park is also by Mathews.United States Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, California, National Register of Historic Places, Section 7, Page 22. Mathews was vice-president of the San Francisco Chapter of the American Institute of Architects from 1913 to 1916 and president in 1917. He was president of the California Board of Architectural Examiners in 1915‚Äì18. Private life and death Mathews and his wife had two daughters.\\"Edgar A.

In 1935 they moved to 1956 Great Highway, which he had also designed; he died on New Year's Eve 1946. Lawsuits Mathews was involved in two lawsuits. In 1908 he was sued by a former client in San Rafael for twice designing a similar house to be built close to the client's, which the client had wanted to be unique. The judge ruled in favor of Mathews, saying: \\"If this injunction were granted it would have the practical effect of putting architect Mathews out of business, because his personality expresses itself in a certain type of house, and this injunction seeks to restrain him from constructing that type.\\"\\"Court Rules That an Architect May Duplicate His Plans to Different Clients\\", Current News Section, The American Architect and Building News 94, July 1, 1908, p. 19.The Ohio Architect and Builder 12 (1908) 45‚Äì46. In 1914 Mathews sued the Board of Trustees of the San Francisco Public Library for $11,900, his fee and time in entering the competition to design the main library; he argued that the winning design by George W. Kelham (the building now the Asian Art Museum) plagiarized Cass Gilbert's Detroit Public Library.

The book sparked controversy due to its highly explicit sexual content and the little known reality of people who have D.I.D. and it has been referred to it as a book that \\"leaves 50 shades looking as a sweet blushing kiss.\\" In 2017 Marcela launched her book \\"InmorTal\\", a collection of real life stories of sexual violence against Chilean girls and women with strong emphasis on the clergy and upper classes. She invited her friend Gabriela Rivera Lucero, a renowned Chilean feminist photographer who worked with her in Caleidoscopio to collaborate doing a small series of black and white explicit images that were taken during urban interventions at churches and cemeteries as well as studio shots and counted with the assistance of their families and eminent actor Julio Jung who posed next to Marcela. A selection of these photographs was included in the book. Del Sol has stated that her inspiration to publish InmorTal came from Nabila Rifo, a victim to one of the most violent domestic violence crimes in Chile, having had her eyes gouged by her ex-partner. She felt there was a need to inmortalise Rifo's story, ordeal and strength in order to push society towards effectively fighting gender violence. Marcela met and befriended Nabila Rifo and has been a tireless supporter of hers. Rifo wrote a few lines as a call to end violence against women, which were included in InmorTal. Del Sol has been a collaborator in a number of publications in Australia and Chile and participates in social poetry events in Australia.

The German CD single was issued via Warner Bros. Records, including only the album version of the track; this marked Prince's final collaboration with Warner.  Background and release  In July 1999, Prince announced the upcoming release of The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale, a collection of previously unreleased material from his partnership with Warner Bros. Records. The material created was recorded throughout 1985 and 1994, and was promoted by the release of one single, \\"Extraordinary\\", on August 10, 1999. While it is unknown what album Prince wrote the song for, \\"It's About That Walk\\" was written around the time The Hits/The B-Sides was released. A CD single of \\"It's About That Walk\\" was released exclusively in Germany, to further promote The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale. The CD solely included the album version of the track, but was not made available for purchase as it was a \\"promo-only\\" CD. This collaboration was the last Prince would do with Warner Bros. for nearly fifteen years; his next release with Warner would be Plectrumelectrum (2014).  Critical response  After its release, \\"It's About That Walk\\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Mark Zeltner of PopMatters declared it the \\"best of the lot\\" on The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale, favorably comparing it to the works of James Brown and Smokey Robinson.

The Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) for Nakivale in 2013 was 2.9% (with critical being more than 15%) and Severe Acute Malnutrition rate was negligible (critical = 5%). = Water and Sanitation = There is an estimated population of over 35,000 nationals surrounding the Refugee Settlement who directly benefit from water, education, health and nutrition programmes in the settlement. UNHCR and the government of Uganda fund and monitor the implementation of sub-projects activities and interfaces with implementing partners involved in providing social service like Windle International Uganda for education. The settlement hosts communities from Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Somalia, Rwanda, Eritrea, and Ethiopia. Refugees in Nakivale settlement receive both underground water (through boreholes and shallow wells) and surface water pumped from Lake Nakivale and treated at one of 3 water plants in the settlement (Base camp, Misiera and Kabazaana). There are 50 hand pumps and 318 water taps in the settlement. Water trucking (in schools and health centres) is also used during the dry season and rain water harvesting during the wet season. The sanitation sector is involved in hygiene promotion in communities and institutions. Latrine coverage in 2013 was 87%. = Livelihoods and environment = The main livelihood activities include food crop production (including mushroom growing inside houses), crop post- harvest handling (mainly for maize), livestock husbandry, small businesses and vocational skills (tailoring, soap making, bakery and crafts/sandal making), making energy efficient stoves that use less firewood and making charcoal out of household waste. A total of 2,590 energy saving stoves have been constructed in the settlement through community participation. As part of promoting and supporting small holder associations, beneficiary households have also been organized into groups/associations. In order to promote conservation and stop deforestation tree-planting and energy saving technologies have been introduced. = Resettlement = Nakivale is the main settlement for resettlement cases due to its size and the length of stay of many of its refugees. The focus is on individual protection cases and Congolese refugees for durable solutions. Additionally, follow-up and counseling is provided for the Somali refugees whose cases were submitted between 2009 and 2011 and still pending. In 2013, UNHCR referred 999 individuals from Nakivale and 1,763 individuals departed. In 2013, resettlement submissions from Nakivale are expected to continue increasing significantly with a main focus on Congolese refugees.

For the history of radio disc jockeys, see Radio disc jockey history. A young woman plays a gramophone in an air raid shelter in north London (1940). History The modern DJ's role as a performer who creates a seamless and extended mix of music for a dance party or club atmosphere evolved from radio personalities who introduced and played individual selections of recorded music on broadcast radio stations. In 1935, American radio commentator Walter Winchell coined the term \\"disc jockey\\" (the combination of disc, referring to disc-shaped phonograph records, and jockey, which is an operator of a machine) to describe radio announcer Martin Block, the first radio announcer to gain widespread fame for playing popular recorded music over the air. In 1943, radio DJ Jimmy Savile launched the world's first DJ dance party by playing jazz records in the upstairs function room of the Loyal Order of Ancient Shepherds in Otley, England. In 1947, he claims to have become the first DJ to use twin turntables for continuous play, and in 1958 became a radio DJ at Radio Luxembourg. Also in 1947, the Whiskey √† Go-Go nightclub opened in Paris, France, considered to be the world's first commercial discoth√®que, or disco (deriving its name from the French word meaning a nightclub where the featured entertainment is recorded music rather than an on-stage band). Regine began playing on two turntables there in 1953. Discos began appearing across Europe and the United States. In the 1950s, American radio DJs would appear live at sock hops and \\"platter parties\\" and assume the role of a human jukebox. They would usually play 45-rpm records, featuring hit singles on one turntable while talking between songs. In some cases, a live drummer was hired to play beats between songs to maintain the dance floor. In 1955, Bob Casey, a well- known \\"sock hop\\" DJ, brought the two-turntable system to the U.S. In the late 1950s, sound systems, a new form of public entertainment, were developed in the ghettos of Kingston, Jamaica. Promoters, who called themselves DJs, would throw large parties in the streets that centered on the disc jockey, called the \\"selector,\\" who played dance music from large, loud PA systems and bantered over the music with a boastful, rhythmic chanting style called \\"toasting\\". These parties quickly became profitable for the promoters, who would sell admission, food, and alcohol, leading to fierce competition between DJs for the biggest sound systems and newest records. 1960s and 1970s In the mid-1960s, nightclubs and discoth√®ques continued to grow in Europe and the United States. Specialized DJ equipment, such as Rudy Bozak's classic CMA-10-2DL mixer, began to appear on the market. In 1969, American club DJ Francis Grasso popularized beatmatching at New York's Sanctuary nightclub. Beatmatching is the technique of creating seamless transitions between records with matching beats, or tempos. Grasso also developed slip-cuing, a technique long used in radio, where holding a record still while the turntable is revolving underneath and releasing it at the desired moment created a sudden transition from the previous record. By 1968, the number of dance clubs started to decline; most American clubs either closed or were transformed into clubs featuring live bands. Neighborhood block parties that were modelled after Jamaican sound systems gained popularity in Europe and in the boroughs of New York City. In 1973, Jamaican-born DJ Kool Herc, widely regarded as the \\"father of hip-hop culture,\\" performed at block parties in his Bronx neighborhood and developed a technique of mixing back and forth between two identical records to extend the rhythmic instrumental segment, or break. Turntablism, the art of using turntables not only to play music but to manipulate sound and create original music, began to develop. In 1974, Technics released the first SL-1200 turntable, which evolved into the SL-1200 MK2 in 1979‚Äîwhich, as of the early-2010s, remains an industry standard for DJing. In 1974, German electronic music band Kraftwerk released the 22-minute song \\"Autobahn,\\" which takes up the entire first side of the album of the same title. Years later, Kraftwerk would become a significant influence on hip-hop artists such as Afrika Bambaataa and house music pioneer Frankie Knuckles. During the mid-1970s, Hip-hop music and culture began to emerge, originating among urban African Americans and Latinos in New York City. The four main elements of Hip Hop culture are graffiti, DJing, b-boying, and MCing (rapping). In the mid-1970s, the soul-funk blend of dance pop known as disco took off in the mainstream pop charts in the United States and Europe, causing discoth√®ques to experience a rebirth. Unlike many late-1960s clubs, which featured live bands, discoth√®ques used the DJ's selection and mixing of records as the entertainment. In 1975, record pools began, providing disc jockeys access to newer music from the industry in an efficient method. In 1975, hip-hop DJ Grand Wizard Theodore invented the scratching technique by accident. In 1976, American DJ, editor, and producer Walter Gibbons remixed \\"Ten Percent\\" by Double Exposure, one of the earliest commercially released 12‚Ä≥ singles (a.k.a. \\"maxi-single\\"). In 1979, the Sugar Hill Gang released \\"Rapper's Delight\\", the first hip-hop record to become a hit. In 1977, Saratoga Springs, NY disc jockey Tom L. Lewis introduced the Disco Bible (later renamed Disco Beats), which published hit disco songs listed by beats per minute (tempo), as well as by either artist or song title. Billboard ran an article on the new publication, and it went national relatively quickly. The list made it easier for beginning DJs to learn how to create seamless transitions between songs without dancers having to change their rhythm on the dance floor. Today, DJs can find the beats per minute of songs in the BPM List. 1980s In 1981, the cable television network MTV was launched, originally devoted to music videos, especially popular rock music. The term \\"video jockey\\", or VJ, was used to describe the fresh-faced youth who introduced the music videos. In 1982, the demise of disco in the mainstream by the summer of 1982 forced many nightclubs to either close or change entertainment styles, such as by providing MTV-style video dancing or live bands. Released in 1982, the song \\"Planet Rock\\" by DJ Afrika Bambaataa was the first hip-hop song to feature synthesizers. The song melded electro hip-hop beats influenced by Yellow Magic Orchestra with the melody from Kraftwerk's \\"Trans-Europe Express.\\" In 1982, the Compact Disc reached the public market in Asia, and early the following year in other markets. This event is often seen as the \\"Big Bang\\" of the digital audio revolution. In the early 1980s, NYC disco DJ Larry Levan, known for his electric mixes, gained a cult following, and the Paradise Garage, the nightclub at which he spun, became the prototype for the modern dance club where the music and the DJ were showcased. Around the same time, the disco-influenced electronic style of dance music called house music emerged in Chicago. The name was derived from the Warehouse Club in Chicago, where resident DJ Frankie Knuckles mixed old disco classics and Eurosynth pop. House music is essentially disco music with electronic drum machine beats. The common element of most house music is a 4/4 beat generated by a drum machine or other electronic means (such as a sampler), together with a solid (usually also electronically generated) synth bassline. In 1983, Jesse Saunders released what some consider the first house music track, \\"On & On.\\" The mid-1980s also saw the emergence of New York Garage, a house music hybrid that was inspired by Levan's style and sometimes eschewed the accentuated high-hats of the Chicago house sound. During the mid-1980s, techno music emerged from the Detroit club scene. Being geographically located between Chicago and New York, Detroit techno artists combined elements of Chicago house and New York garage along with European imports. Techno distanced itself from disco's roots by becoming almost purely electronic with synthesized beats. In 1985, the Winter Music Conference started in Fort Lauderdale Florida and became the premier electronic music conference for dance music disc jockeys. In 1985, TRAX Dance Music Guide was launched by American Record Pool in Beverly Hills. It was the first national DJ-published music magazine, created on the Macintosh computer using extensive music market research and early desktop publishing tools. In 1986, \\"Walk This Way\\", a rap/rock collaboration by Run DMC and Aerosmith, became the first hip-hop song to reach the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. This song was the first exposure of hip- hop music, as well as the concept of the disc jockey as band member and artist, to many mainstream audiences. In 1988, DJ Times magazine was first published. It was the first US-based magazine specifically geared toward the professional mobile and club DJ. 1990s During the early 1990s, the rave scene built on the acid house scene. The rave scene changed dance music, the image of DJs, and the nature of promoting. The innovative marketing surrounding the rave scene created the first superstar DJs who established marketable \\"brands\\" around their names and sound. Some of these celebrity DJs toured around the world and were able to branch out into other music-related activities. During the early 1990s, the Compact Disc surpassed the gramophone record in popularity, but gramophone records continued to be made (although in very limited quantities) into the 21st century‚Äîparticularly for club DJs and for local acts recording on small regional labels. In 1991, Mobile Beat magazine, geared specifically toward mobile DJs, began publishing and in their premier edition featured award-winning club & Mobile DJ Chris Pangalos from Rolling Thunder Productions. Pangalos was also featured in the April 1993 edition of DJ Times magazine as well. In 1992, the Moving Picture Experts Group released the MPEG-1 standard, designed to produce reasonable sound at low bit rates. The lossy compression scheme MPEG-1 Layer-3, popularly known as MP3, later revolutionized the digital music domain. In 1993, the first internet \\"radio station\\", Internet Talk Radio, was developed by Carl Malamud. Because the audio was relayed over the internet, it was possible to access internet radio stations from anywhere in the world. This made it a popular service for both amateur and professional disc jockeys operating from a personal computer. Danny Brown in 2014 In 1998, the first MP3 digital audio player was released, the Eiger Labs MPMan F10. N2IT developed Final Scratch between 1998 and 2002 and showed a non-functioning prototype at the BE Developer Conference, marking the first digital DJ system to allow DJs control of MP3 files through special time-coded vinyl records or CDs. The \\"Final Scratch\\" system developed by N2IT shipped it first working units in early 2002 and DJs were spinning on digital vinyl by mid 2002. While it would take sometime for this novel concept to catch on with the \\"die hard Vinyl DJs\\", This would soon become the first step in the new Digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with computer DJing pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being Professor Jam (a.k.a. William P. Rader), who went on to develop the industry's first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the \\"CPS (Computerized Performance System) DJ Summit\\", to help spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology. In 1998, Nathan Burton (England) started using Computers to Dj instead of vinyls using the popular mpeg3 format at the time. In 1999, Shawn Fanning released Napster, the first of the massively popular peer-to-peer file sharing systems. During this period, the AVLA (Audio Video Licensing Agency) of Canada announced an MP3 DJing license, administered by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. This meant that DJs could apply for a license giving them the right to perform publicly using music stored on a hard drive, instead of having to cart their whole CD collections around to their gigs. 2000s At the start of the new century, the introduction of advances in technology made it possible for new sounds and new DJ styles to be developed. Pioneer DJ came to be the digital standard. Audio and Video Mixers where developed, bringing the MTV world of the 80s and 90s to the world of DJ personality of the 2000s. New technologies concentrated in analog sound brought another high tech digital era, sound mixers made a whole new culture of DJ integration. DJs were more virtual than ever. Mixtapes flooded the online world. DJs began to merge and network with classic DJs. The proliferation of Internet technologies have also created a culture of disc jockey enthusiast groups who proliferated social and mass media groups, however, the DJ culture has kept its underground essence in most metropolitan cities. 2010s References Category:DJing Category:Music history ","title":"History of DJing"},{"id":"50541947","text":"Government P.C.

The district encompasses 25 contributing buildings in an exclusively residential section of Hammond. The development began before 1923, the year its first house was constructed, on what had been \\"Eggebrech's Second Tract\\" that was sold around 1919. The builder Karl Hohenberger obtained the land and then saw his real estate development financed in part by Al Capone, who enabled him to build the first house according to his specifications that included steel skeleton to support the massive weight of a Spanish barrel-tile roof and concrete floors between the house's stories. This house also features the inclusion of steel plates in its outside walls in order to render it bullet-proof to the standards of the day. Capone and his organization used this house as a collection point for the proceeds of their bootlegged liquor, prostitution and other rackets that went on unchecked in Hammond until the early 1930s. The house was employed as a detention point for those customers of Capone who were unable to pay him timely and has bulletholes on its outside and inside to attest to the ruthlessness of that notorious criminal organization. Numerous spent .22 caliber bullets have turned up in the back patio from this era. The house was seized under a writ of judicial forfeiture in 1932 by Judge Henry Clay Cleveland, whose wife Florence Hammond was the granddaughter of George Hammond, city founder and proprietor of its meat-packing operation. It developed between about 1925 and 1952, and includes notable example of Colonial Revival, Tudor Revival, Spanish Colonial and English Cottage style residential architecture.

His family includes doctor B√©la R√°kosi, writer Viktor R√°kosi, and actress Szidi R√°kosi.  Life  He was the son of J√°nos Kremsner and Anna Vogel, who were Danube Swabians. His father previously lived in the villages of Ukk and Dabronc, where he worked as a goldsmith and was a bailiff with a small estate. His family changed their name to R√°kosi in 1867. By the 1850s, the family had settled in the village of T√ºrje, where his childhood home had a plaque installed by the Danubian Cultural Association in 1942. R√°kosi went to school first in S√°rv√°r, then graduated in started and finished high school in a class of six in K≈ëszeg and Sopron. A luckily poetic minded young man, he had illustrious teachers Jeromos L√≥skay and Fl√≥ri√°n Holl√≥sy tutoring him as a senior and managed to get to Sopron Roman Catholic high school. He began, under the pressure of Hungarian political movements, to self-study, which was initially the same in German, but from 1859, it was entirely in Hungarian. Here he mainly wrote short stories, but later, he also wrote plays. The foundation of self-study groups were largely from fellow student J√°nos H√©rics (T√≥th), who later became President of the Royal Court of Appeal. On one occasion, at high school age, R√°kosi's parents sent him to Graz and became part of the theatre scene; the German winning piece Birchpfeifer was so pleasing to him that he wanted a copy to be delivered home, especially after seeing the play after listening to the translation. R√°kosi's father was impoverished due to a variety of disasters with nine living children, but the parents' burden was lightened and lived by himself in search, school career stopped and went to Somogy County where, in the autumn of 1860 and spring of 1862 in Lengyelt√≥ti, landed in Count J√°nos Zichy's estate, J√≥zsef Perlaky steward's children r√©p√©titeur and at the same time marketing intern volt. The tendency for writers in court for the first time began to manifest itself, constantly studying and writing, and also minor plays. Even in the economic field and he gave up after this dismal deserved statement and in 1862 by J√≥zsef Jankovich's clerk in his estate in √ñreglak (Somogy County). Here, R√°kosi spent about 13 months until June 1863; However, he utterly diverted from his economic path and moved away from Pest. Here, J√°nos H√©rics invited R√°kosi to continue his studies. After much struggle, he managed to earn licenses in the six years of education, supplementing it with less than one year by merging the Benedictines in the Sopron graduation exam. The 1863-1864. school year saw students enrolled in the university's law faculty, where it was carried out. At the same time he continued his studies and working of poetry (mostly English literature, as he felt affection for and studied Shakespearean works), and in difficult financial circumstances, maintained himself as a lawyer. Jen≈ë R√°kosi in a card series In the first half of 1864, he wrote a drama about Ladislaus the Posthumous in the second half of Aesop's tales. On 14 October 1866 he took his first staged romantic drama at the National Theatre (released a day earlier in Gy≈ër) and had a definite success. The young writer was a pioneer of the Hungarian drama and appeared with close friends. He soon took to literature and public life's sights. Jen≈ë R√°kosi's portrait on the Vas√°rnapi Ujs√°gban In March 1867 the Pesti Napl√≥ entered superannuation,Papp Ferenc: R√°kosi Jen≈ë a h√≠rlap√≠r√≥, 1924 of which the De√°k party was part of. Baron Zsigmond Kem√©ny called his board colleague who had cancer in the past with pieces of old glories by critics of the academy, not so much in order to be employed, but as more to provide for writing plays of his financial problems independent of the situation, as such, R√°kosi became a journalist. The Pesti Napl√≥ took the box \\"Vienna Things\\" of the successor forthwith Ferenc Salamon. The box brochure and the polemical articles were fought in a compromise with the lively, current style, which was very popular in the assigned box. A few months later, he received a special honor award for working hard on editorials. He was also a large part of the founding of Borsszem Jank√≥ on 5 January 1868, where the Hungarian-scribe poems, at one time, were very much in demand. Although he had been a very active journalist, in literature not been unfaithful. He dealt with translations of Shakespeare's works into Hungarian and four of the Hungarian Shakespeare translation was published in the Kisfaludy company, such as The Merry Wives of WindsorShakespeare: A windsori v√≠g asszonyok (Ford√≠totta: R√°kosi Jen≈ë), As You Like It, and CymbelineShakespeare: Cymbeline.. In 1869, the Kisfaludy Society chose, among its members, his poem Sz√©p Ilonka as an exemplary act of a dramatic poem. After the end of 1869 and the merger between the Pesti Napl√≥ and Sz√°zadunk, R√°kosi left as editor and, with M√≥r R√°th, on 15 December 1869, they founded the Reform and was independently until 16 June 1875, when the Reform went into a pro-De√°k party sentiment, and was grouped with talented young writers at the time, most notably M√°rkus Istv√°n and Istv√°n Toldy, but others were present. After the fall of the De√°k party, the sheet was disbanded and reduced to Urv√°ry beleolvasztotta and the Pesti Napl√≥. R√°kosi left the Pesti Napl√≥ to ministerial writers whom, however, did not deal with politics. Drama Writing in his career Gergely Csiky (later parallels) while constantly been on the rise before. At the time, it was made for the establishment of the People's Theatre and R√°kosi made a great deal; the idea was brought and served the final stage; He became collector, manager, clerk of the committee and was qualified as a theatre director. He undertook the ad without an invitation, in 1875 the institute received annual wage of 10,000 HUF. He organized a troupe of folk plays and works, and operettas and cultural attractions. The German theatre was weakened by the better performance of the contract and by the Soci√©t√© des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques Parisian troupe concluded that all Paris successful piece of storytelling right to Budapest secured for the People's Theatre. In 1881, he was headed to the theater and during this time was not only a director but also a director, translator, recasting it. In 1881, the Pesti Napl√≥ became divided when J√≥zsef Csuk√°ssy, along with more particularly those of the editorial board, called R√°kosi to base the Budapesti H√≠rlap on 15 June 1881. After the establishment of the political newspaper, J√≥zsef had cancer and after his death on 27 May 1891 Ferenc Csajthay became editor of the paper, while the editor in chief and publisher was R√°kosi. It soon became one of the most often read in public goods; A political party affiliation was not present in the paper, especially with the idea of national service. R√°kosi wrote most of the editorials and determined the direction. R√°kosi worked for the Budapesti H√≠rlap for forty years, where he was editor in chief and constant contributor. Its purpose was, as he writes: \\"All this advocacy and support, which serves the cause of Hungarians in any field or respect for life.\\"Acs√°d, h√≠res sz√ºl√∂ttek: R√°kosi Jen≈ë The board of reconciliation was on the side, but advocated the extension of national rights. On several occasions, he was a notable factor on the political public opinion. He had a confidential and intimate relationship with Publikum√°val, a sign of the immediate impact of a public purpose by collecting notable amounts could be raised. In the 1890s, he considerably extended his business ventures; he founded the newspaper Fashion, the Children's fashion and lingerie Laundry by fashion magazine, and by the end of 1896 created the Evening Newspaper. On 5 May 1892, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences elected him as a corresponding member. On 10 November 1896, the Hungarian nobility received his name Mindszent, and he became a member of the House of Lords on 1 January 1903. Portrait by Philip de L√°szl√≥, 1897 R√°kosi was part of the folk play development. He discovered and engaged the prematurely deceased Ferenc Csepreghy, whose works were published in 1881. R√°kosi's career had later fallen, and worked as an editorial writer and editor, where he was generally polemical and was more in the foreground of newspaper writing; literary work of great importance as well. In addition to his pen, he had an upscale taste characterized by a fanatical cult of national direction. The Hungarian made famous to work in the field and spelling reform. He was the founder and worked on the evolution of Hungarian literature. He was the president of the scope of the Home of writers and newspaper writers; he assisted in the metropolitan newspaper publishing, of which he was also president of the Association. He was the second president of the association of cultural and national associations of the national council in Pannonia, he was vice president of the Urania Association of Science, an elected member of the national council of museums and libraries, and was appointed by the government members of the Elizabeth Memorial National Committee; Finally, he was a member of the Copyright 1884. XVI. Budapest constant expert committee formed pursuant to ¬ß 31 of the Act. The newspaper writers participated in the congresses in 1896 and the national memorial statues and tablets unveiling ceremony held commemorative speeches in Szombathely, F√ºrged, Gy≈ër, Sopron, Kom√°rom, Budapest, Kaposv√°r, Pozsony, Kolozsv√°r, Arad, Zombor, Szeged, Debrecen, and Beszterceb√°ny. R√°kosi conducted a plethora of wide-ranging organizational work, in addition to operetta texts in Hungarian and historical dramas. In addition to folk dramas, he also wrote high-level entertainment, being a public recruiter from the Hungarian theater collusion. R√°kosi was rejected by universal suffrage from the introduction of left-wing demand for the country's peace and territorial integrity that feared him. He had done much more to be part of the Hungarian language newspaper. He also played a major role in the so-called Bukovina Sz√©kelys of the Lower Danube resettlement, organised by the Cs√°ng√≥ installation. The language of the nation and their loyalty was important in the campaign, not the origin. He intended to achieve the preservation of the constitutional rights and culture of the Hungarian country. His dream was shared by the thought of the thirty million Hungarian Hungarian Empire, which saw Slavs as posing a threat to Europe, and against the German overweight against forces which have been reported. On 13 August 1907, his mother died. In the early 20th century, he supported Apponyi's coalition supported and held Count with Istv√°n Tisza: as an officer, he did not want the First World War to happen, but after the Kingdom of Hungary got involved, he encouraged it because he saw that the existence of the country was at stake. He was opposed by Endre Ady, and this questionable connection had become particularly fierce. At this point, his literature did not approve of the Western political stance, and some authors questioned the morality of Western literature and portrayed samples of excessive imitation. In the 1920s, he was one of the vanguards of the Revisionist movement in Hungary. His works appeared in 1912 in 12 volumes. In the 1920s, in the aftermath of the Treaty of Trianon, R√°kosi, with the nation and the rule of law, defended the radical left and anti-Hungarian protestors, both for equal rights and in response to the questions the radical right side was facing. It was considered vital for the changing frontiers of Trianon, of which he worked on until his death. At the age of 87, in 1926, he wrote memoirs which foresaw the approaching of World War II, and assessed the reasons leading to it. In July 1928 in London and in September 1928 in Venice, he discussed these memoirs with Lord Rothermere, as Mussolini was becoming a more present force in Italy. Jen≈ë R√°kosi's tombstone in Budapest's Kerepesi cemetery, created in 1966 by J√°nos Horvay. On 8 February 1929, after recording, he died. He was put to rest two days later on February 10, 1929 at the Kerepesi cemetery. Shortly after his death, on 17 February, Lord Rothermere offered his own condolences, where he creates a drawn memorial of R√°kosi. A statue of him was inaugurated 30 November 1930. The editor of the Daily Mail, Rothermere wrote this tribute in front of Jen≈ë R√°kosi's work. \\"Since [the] recorded history of mankind, there has [never] been a fairer deal as the Hungarian national emergency.\\"  Legacy  After his death, only two of five space and a street named after him in Budapest. Harold Harmsworth dedicated a bronze statue to him on the corner of Erzs√©bet Boulevard and Doh√°ny Street Square, and another work dedicated by Zsigmond Strobl. His birthplace of Acs√°d had become almost a place of pilgrimage. In 1945, however, after the Soviet takeover of Hungary, the statue in Budapest was removed and melted down in 1948, and now is replaced by a statue of a faun. The Hungarian regime change has not provided the truth behind his works, despite the fact that several major public and intellectual coterie could keep track among his predecessors. An extensive oeuvre, however, is mostly totally unknown, and is nuanced today, so therefore it is not yet possible, but people have found distorted simplifications of his works for research.

Career With his half-brother David Lubin, he opened a drygoods store in San Francisco, California in 1872. They subsequently co-founded Lubin and Weinstock, a department store in Sacramento, California later known as Weinstock's. He was also an investor in the Weinstock, Lubin Real Estate Company; the Weinstock, Nichols Company; and the National Bank of D. O. Mills. Weinstock served in the National Guard from 1881 to 1895, retiring as Colonel. Meanwhile, he joined the board of trustees of the California State Library in 1887. Seven years later, in 1895, he joined the State Board of Horticulture. Weinstock became a freeholder of Sacramento in 1891. In 1913, he was appointed to the Commission on Industrial Relations by President Woodrow Wilson. p. 19. He also served on the executive committee of the National Civic Federation, which attempted to alleviate conflict between employers and labor unions. He was subsequently appointed to the State Industrial Accident Commission. Weinstock was elected the first President of the Commonwealth Club of California in 1903.The Commonwealth Club of California A Brief Statement Regarding Its Origin, Purposes and History, Transactions of the Commonwealth Club of California, November 15, 1903, Vol. 1. No. 1, p. 1. Weinstock drafted the Weinstock Arbitration Bill of 1911, which prohibited strikes and lockouts during the arbitration process. By 1915, Weinstock was appointed by Governor Hiram Johnson as first director of the State Market Commission of California. As Commissioner, Weinstock imposed regulations on the citrus and poultry industries, ensuring that farmers were paid their fair share and helping the industries with marketing. He also established the State Fish Exchange. He resigned in January 1920. Weinstock served as the vice president of the Jewish Publication Society. He was also a member of the Jewish Historical Society. Personal life and death Weinstock married Barbara Felsenthal.

As a child, Egner was a musical prodigy. During his early career he performed with the Metropolitan Opera and New York Philharmonic, but left civilian life to join the U.S. Army at the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, spending three years in the Philippines as bandmaster of the 17th Infantry Regiment. He would later be appointed band director at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and is best remembered for composing \\"On, Brave Old Army Team\\", West Point's fight song. Early life Egner was born in New York City to German immigrants Philippe and Emma Egner and grew up in East Orange, New Jersey. His father was a music teacher and, by age six, the younger Egner had mastered the violin; he was described by one account as a \\"child prodigy\\". Egner went on to learn additional instruments and, by age 16, was the leader of his own orchestra in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Career Early in Egner's career he performed as a cellist with the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic. In 1898, on the outbreak of war with Spain, Egner joined the United States Army and was appointed bandmaster of the 17th Infantry Regiment. He spent the next three years in the Philippines. Returning to the United States, Egner briefly toured the U.S. as an instrumentalist in the vaudevillian performances of Lillian Russell and the minstrel shows of Primrose and West. He later served as director of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company Band, and for six years led the band of New York's Hebrew Orphans Asylum (HOA), a Jewish orphanage organized and disciplined along military lines. His HOA band established a reputation as the \\"best boys' band in the city\\" and his work with the ensemble has been credited with leading to his appointment as bandmaster at West Point, a post he held from 1909 to his retirement in 1934. In 1910 Egner collaborated on scripting a new cheer with one of West Point's yell kings. While returning to his quarters, Egner began whistling an improvised tune which he decided would go well with the words for the new cheer, making it more suited for a fight song than a football chant. He scribbled the notes on his shirt cuff and the resulting composition became \\"On, Brave Old Army Team\\". During his time at West Point, Egner also composed the \\"Official West Point March\\", among other songs. He scored the 1916 musical comedy staged by the cadets, The Wasp-Waisted Vampires about a time in the future when half the corps of cadets is women and the academy on the verge of being shuttered by the U.S. government on account of a lack of wars (at the end of the show the \\"good news\\" arrives that Highland Falls, New York has been invaded, thereby justifying continued congressional appropriations to West Point). In 1932 Egner invited Mabel Bauer, a music teacher in New Haven, Connecticut and wife of a West Point alumnus, to direct the band in performing Franz von Blon's \\"With Energy and Strength\\", which marked the first time since the band's formation in 1817 that a woman had taken-up the baton. From 1929 until his retirement five years later, Egner also served as director of the West Point Glee Club. Major-General Perry Griffith, who attended West Point in the early 1930s, recalled cadet dances of that era held at Camp Clinton ‚Äì the academy's then summer tactical course for third-year cadets ‚Äì in a 1983 article for West Point's alumni magazine The Assembly. The 1915 edition of the academy's yearbook, The Howitzer, was dedicated by the corps of cadets to Egner for his \\"unfailing kindness and untiring labor in our behalf\\". Personal life Egner married Emma Hausens in 1895, with whom he had one daughter and one son. Emma died in 1926 and Philip married Gertrude Laswick Specht in 1927. She had 3 sons and 1 daughter. Gertrude died in 1939, and in 1942 Philip married her sister, Anna Laswick. He died in 1956 and is buried in the West Point Cemetery beneath a grave etched with the first seven notes of the chorus to \\"On, Brave Old Army Team\\". Anna, his last wife is buried with him. She died in 1967.

The East Baton Rouge Parish school system held multiple public meetings to discuss new names for the school. The school board in the end decided not to rename the school. When the school became a magnet school it was renamed from \\"Robert E. Lee High School\\" to \\"Lee Magnet High School\\". = June 2020 meeting = A screenshot of board member Connie Bernard shopping during the meeting. In June 2020, the name of the school became the center of controversy as many residents questioned the purpose of memorializing the legacy of Lee. Many, including the Baton Rouge Area Chamber (BRAC), announced their support of the name change, with Adam Knapp, CEO of BRAC, saying, \\"Our leadership felt it was time to make a change in the name of that school.\\" On June 18, 2020, the East Baton Rouge School Board held a meeting about the schools name. Connie Bernard, a board member who has been serving since 2010, defended the schools name, telling community members to ‚Äúlearn a little bit more about‚Äù Lee saying that \\"General Lee inherited a large plantation, and he was tasked with the job of doing something with those people who lived in bondage to that plantation ‚Äì the slaves ‚Äì and he freed them.\\" Community leader Gary Chambers Jr. photographed Bernard on her laptop shopping during the meeting, posting it on his Facebook before addressing the board. The three minute video of Chambers criticizing Bernard went viral on social media, with LeBron James, Shannon Sharpe, and Ava DuVernay retweeting the video. After the speech, Chambers uploaded a 2-minute video on Instagram explaining his perspective, calling for Bernard to resign, and containing a 20-second video of Bernard on her laptop. Bernard has been called to resign by three of the EBR school board members, including by vice president Tramelle Howard, and has since apologized about the incident, writing \\"My comments last week about the naming of Lee High School were insensitive, have caused pain for others, and have led people to believe I am an enemy of people of color, and I am deeply sorry.\\" She had also told that what was on her laptop was a pop-up ad that failed to close and that she \\"was actually taking notes, paying attention, reading online comments.‚Äù In response to a news conference calling her to resign, Bernard has stated that she would not resign and that she \\"will continue to serve all students as elected by my district three times.\\" The members of the school board said that they would launch a campaign to remove Connie Bernard if she did not resign. Richard Lipsey and board president Mike Gaudet have also called for Bernard's resignation. Woody Jenkins, the chairman of the executive committee for the Republican Party in East Baton Rouge, called Gaudet to resign over his remarks. After a request, the history from the school board-issued laptop used by Bernard was searched, showing that the had visited a website called \\"thredUP.\\" On June 18, 2020, the East Baton Rouge School Board unanimously voted to establish a renaming committee and to hear recommendations for the new name. The renaming committee narrowed three names on July 13: Louisiana Magnet High School, Liberty Magnet High School, and P.B.S. Pinchback Magnet High School. On July 16, the renaming committee voted to rename the school to \\"Liberty High School.\\" On August 3, crews removed the \\"Lee Magnet\\" signage from the school.

Biography Figueiroa was born in Porto Alegre to the Portuguese journalist Manoel dos Passos Figueiroa and the Brazilian Ana C√¢ndida da Rocha Figueiroa. Her father died when she was four years and she became a depressed and melancholic adolescent. However, due to her sensibility, during this period she started to write lyrical poems for the local newspapers, including A Reforma (The Reform). A Romantic, she had among her influences Gon√ßalves Dias, Jos√© de Alencar, Alvares de Azevedo and Casimiro de Abreu. At 24 she left her hometown to go to Rio de Janeiro along with her brother, Jos√©, an engineer and professor at the Polytechnic School of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. There, she was encouraged by some intellectuals of the Imperial Court, who appreciated her work, to publish poems in the local A Luz (The Light) and Pelotas' Progresso Liter√°rio (Literary Progress). After a period of happiness in Rio she returned with her brother to Porto Alegre where her memories persecuted here. Her joy was recovered when she met the poet and goldsmith Carlos Ferreira during a literary event. Ferreira became the \\"center of her life\\", according to a biographer, and they soon got engaged. Her poetry style was affected by that relationship; the wistful love, she once wrote about, turned into a vivid love in her poems, in which she revealed her inner feelings. During this period she entered the Sociedade Partenon Liter√°rio (Parthenon Literary Society), a group whose main ideas were the Romantism and regionalism. She published works on Partenon's monthly journal and local newspapers to critical and public acclaim. Her works were not limited to love poems, though; Figueiroa wrote nationalistic pieces inspired by the Paraguayan War (1864‚Äì1870) that she considered as a sovereignty-driven enterprise. She also supported the Abolitionist movement and women's right through her poems. In 1872, she published her only book, Crep√∫sculos (Twilights), through the printing office of Jornal do Com√©rcio (Commerce Journal). She was happier than ever until the day Pedro II and Teresa Cristina came to Porto Alegre's S√£o Pedro Theatre to receive a homage. During the reception, Ferreira declaimed a poem that impressed the emperor who offered to pay his studies in Rio de Janeiro. Ferreira accepted to Figueiroa's second great disappointment after the death of her father. At first, she was reluctant to believe but when it became clear she locked herself in her house and did not want to eat. She went through mental alienation and later she was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Aged 33, she died from tuberculosis on September 24, 1878. A street is named after her in the neighborhood Partenon and she is the patroness of the sixth chair of Feminine Literary Academy of Rio Grande do Sul.

The nursery is cited as eliminating illnesses rife in the East End by providing children with regular meals, places to wash and disinfecting their clothes.

Much of the swampy area surrounding the park was drained by Socialist Romania, building a neighbourhood of apartment blocks, while the \\"valley of weeping\\" became Tineretului Park. President Nicolae Ceau»ôescu wanted to build a reservoir which was supposed to be filled from the Arge»ô River via the MihƒÉile»ôti Lake. As such, a concrete dam was built to surround the lake. The few modest houses located in this area were bought by the state and demolished.Lascu, p. 40 In 2003, the Ministry of the Environment concessioned the area for 49 years to Royal Romanian Corporation for a $6 million.Lascu, p. 45 The company was supposed to invest over a billion dollars in a sports-culture complex, however it did not honor its part of the contract. Due to the area being unused for such a long period of time, plant-life and wildlife flourished within the confines of the dam.

Folk tradition suggested that the name refers to a woman named Alys (Alice) whose cottage stood where the chapel was built. However, another theory contends that the Welsh word als translates as rock, and there is a rock-face behind the chapel. It is a Grade II-listed building but many believe it should be accorded more significant status. Early history The interior of the chapel The first building at Capel Als, dating from 1780, is said to have been \\"very simple and basic\\" and was extended in 1797. At the time, Llanelli was in the early stages of industrial development as a result of the expansion of the coal, iron and copper industries. The mother church of Capel Als was at Llanedi and it was Evan Davies, minister at Llanedi from 1775 who instigated the formation of churches at Cross Inn (later known as Ammanford), Kidwelly and Pembrey, as well as Llanelli. The ministry of David Rees, 1829-69 The first recorded minister was David Rees, a celebrated preacher, publisher and agitator. David Rees arrived in Llanelli in 1829 and inherited a congregation of 250. By 1832, this had grown to 446 and Rees had embarked on replacing the 1797 structure with a much larger building. During the first half of his ministry, Rees was instrumental in establishing several new chapels including Park Church (1839), Siloah (1841) and Capel-y- Bryn (1841). Notwisthstanding the transfer of several hundred members to the new churches, membership at Capel Als stood at 580 in 1850. The chapel was rebuilt and enlarged in 1852 under the supervision of the architect Thomas Thomas of Landore, Swansea. Thomas subsequently used the Capel Als design at Independent chapels at Pontypool in the following year and seven years later in his home chapel in Llandeilo. Rees had a remarkable career as publisher of the radical journal, Y Diwygiwr (The Reformer) and as a pioneer in the provision of education. He was firmly opposed to the established church and conducted a long running feud with the rector of Llanelli, Ebenezer Morris. When he died in 1869, the membership at Capel Als stood at over 800. The ministry of Thomas Johns, 1869‚Äì1914 The minister from 1869 until 1914 was Thomas Johns, a leading figure in Welsh nonconformity, Johns received a unanimous invitation in 1869 to succeed David Rees as pastor of Capel Als. The invitation was accepted, and Johns remained at Capel Als until his death. A new schoolroom was built early in his pastorate, and in 1875 a group of members were released to form a new church at Tabernacle, towards the cost of which Capel Als contributed a significant sum. Several hundred members transferred from Capel Als to the new church at Tabernacle, and it was hoped that this would ease the over-crowding at Capel Als, which suffered from poor ventilation and was uncomfortable especially when the chapel was full as it was for the Sunday evening service every week. The solution was to build a new chapel. Some members wanted to demolish the chapel but old members resisted tstrongly. Therefore a compromise was reached and the new building maintained many features of the David Rees chapel but it was greatly extended. The work was completed in 1894 by Owen Morris Roberts. Later history D.J. Davies became minister at Capel All in 1916 and remained or forty two years until his retirement in 1958. During this period, membership peaked at 1,007 in 1935. He was succeeded by Iorwerth Jones who published a biography of David Rees during his ministry. Maurice Loader was minister from 1975 until 1994.

The school was meant to prevent tuberculosis. The Waldschule f√ºr kr√§nkliche Kinder (translated: forest school for sickly children) soon became the prototype for many successors in European countries as well as in the United States. Since Bendix had a Jewish family background he lost his teaching authorisation after the Nationalsocialists came into power. In 1937 he emigrated to Egypt where he later died.

Belle Yang (born 1960) is an artist, author, graphic novelist and children's book writer. Yang was born in Taiwan in 1960, and moved to the San Francisco Bay area with her parents when she was seven years old. She graduated from University of California, Santa Cruz with a degree in biology, then enrolled in art school. When an ex-boyfriend began harassing Yang, her parents sent her to live with friends of the family in Beijing. She spent three years in China, traveling the country and studying history and classical Chinese art. She was in Beijing during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and returned to the US later that year. Once home, she started recording her parents' stories of their life in China, and that led to her first book, Baba, A Return to China Upon My Father's Shoulders, in 1994. The book, published by Harcourt Brace, was about her father, Joseph Yang, walking out of a 1940s war-torn China. Author Amy Tan, who wrote the foreword to Baba, says that \\"Belle Yang is an American writer who writes in English and thinks in Chinese\\". Maxine Hong Kingston compared Yang's art and writing to that of Isaac Bashevis Singer and Marc Chagall. The Kirkus Review wrote that \\"Yang's work is like a lovely painted scroll swimming with wild souls, beasts, birds, flowers, day and night sky, tragedy, and hope\\". In 1996, Yang wrote a second book about her father's exodus from China, Odyssey of a Manchurian. She completed the trilogy, in 2010, with publication by W.W. Norton and Company of the graphic novel Forget Sorrow, An Ancestral Tale.

The episode was written by producer Cameron Litvack and consulting producer Thania St. John, and was directed by Terrence O'Hara. Plot Opening quote: \\"Fee fi fo fum... I smell the blood of an Englishman...\\" A judge, Logan Patterson (Anthony De Longis) is attacked at his home by a man (Eric Edelstein) and then killed. Sgt. Wu (Reggie Lee) and a fellow police officer are called for break-in and report the homicide. Meanwhile, in a car, the man treats his wounds. Nick (David Giuntoli) and Hank (Russell Hornsby) are sent to investigate, where they find fingerprints on the gavel. Hank later reports to Captain Renard (Sasha Roiz) that the gavel revealed the DNA of a jury foreman. Hank, Renard and the PPD raid a house to discover the foreman's corpse. The jury foreman holds a woman's watch, so Nick and Hank go with Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) to get help. Monroe reveals that the owner of the watch was Mary Robinson, an assistant district attorney. When the police arrive at her home, they find her dead. Hank realizes that the murderer is Oleg Stark, a contract killer who's killing the people who sent him to jail, including him. Captain Renard then suspends Hank for his safety. Nick searches through aunt Marie‚Äôs trailer for any information on Stark's possible wesen form. Nick arrives home where he is attacked by Stark, demanding to know where Hank is.

Nick is transferred to the hospital while Monroe is notified and realizes that Stark is a Siegbarste. Monroe then goes to Aunt Marie's trailer to get a rifle that's the only weapon that can kill a Siegbarste. Hank lures Stark to a quarry while Monroe follows with the rifle. Stark brutally attacks Hank but Monroe manages to kill the Siegbarste before he can kill him but flees before Hank sees him. In the station, Captain Renard chastises Hank for his actions and then tells him that the bullets that killed Stark are from an English rifle that's over 100 years old and it's also a rare elephant gun.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B-\\" grade and wrote, \\"Grimm is about as minor of a hit as possible thanks to being on NBC, but it's sticking around admirably. It holds onto a decent Friday night audience week after week, and turns out consistently average episodes that hold my attention, but we've hit a bit of a rough patch, where the fairy tales are window dressing, plot movement is still barely taking baby steps, and Nick is literally sidelined at the most important time during a case. Stranding a protagonist with a witty, knowledgeable buddy instead of a mentor is already tenuous, but Grimm feels even more in flux than that, almost so surprised of how assured its status is through the end of the season that it doesn't know which direction to go. Does it need more character development for the soon-to-be-engaged couple, retooling to make Eddie Monroe more of a lead, or a toned down amount of fairy tale references? Tonight's episode was a mix of all three, and only the Monroe change made a positive difference.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.5 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Overall, 'Game Ogre' was a fun change of pace for a series that hasn't taken many risks other than its premise, and it paid off beautifully.

He was the top-rated European two-year-old in 2000 when he recovered from a defeat on his debut to win the Phoenix Stakes and the Middle Park Stakes. In the following year he finished fourth in the 2000 Guineas and third in the Irish 2,000 Guineas. He was retired to stud but had limited success as a breeding stallion. Background Minardi was a brown horse with a white blaze bred in Kentucky by Indian Creek. He was sired by Boundary, a Kentucky-bred stallion who won six of his eight races including Grade III victories in the Roseben Handicap and the A Phenomenon Handicap. As a breeding stallion he is best known as the sire of Big Brown. Minardi's dam yarn won one minor race but became a very successful broodmare who also produced Tale of the Cat (King's Bishop Stakes) and Myth, the dam of Johannesburg. As a descendant of the broodmare Feola, she came from the same branch of Thoroughbred family 2-f which has produced numerous major winners including Round Table, Pebbles Nashwan and Deep Impact. As a yearling the colt was offered for sale at the Keeneland September sale and was bought for $1.65 million by the bloodstock agent Dermot \\"Demi\\" O'Byrne on behalf of John Magnier's Coolmore organisation. He was sent to Europe and entered training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like may Coolmore horses the details of the colt's ownership changed from race to race: he was sometimes listed as being owned by Michael Tabor whilst on others occasions he ran for the partnership of Tabor and Sue Magnier. He was ridden in all but two of his races by Mick Kinane. Racing career =2000: two-year-old season= Minardi was sent to England for his racecourse debut and started 5/4 favourite for a six furlong maiden race at Ascot Racecourse on 29 July. He proved no match for the Paul Cole-trained Rumpold and finished second, beaten five lengths. Despite his defeat the colt was stepped up sharply in class for the Group One Phoenix Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse two weeks later. He had not been an intended runner in the race but took his place after his more highly regarded stablemate Freud was withdrawn. The filly Dora Carrington (winner of the Cherry Hinton Stakes) started 5/2 favourite with Minardi joint second choice in the betting on 7/2 alongside Superstar Leo. Kinane settled the colt in fourth as the outsider Longueville Legend set the pace before moving up to take the lead a furlong and a half from the finish. He accelerated clear of his rivals in the closing stages to win by five lengths from Superstar Leo despite being eased down by Kinane in the final strides. The runner-up was later voted Cartier Champion Two-year-old Filly for 2000. His victory was described as \\"a stunning display\\" by the Racing Post. After the race Aidan O'Brien commented \\"Ascot was a blip on Minardi's record. He'd always worked very well and we thought he would burn up the course. Minardi will now have a break before coming back for the Dewhurst and similar races. On 28 September Minardi was sent back to England for the Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse and started the 5/6 favourite in a ten runner field. His principal rivals appeared to be Bad As I Wanna Be (Prix Morny), Endless Summer (Richmond Stakes) and Baaridd (Ripon Champion Two Years Old Trophy) whilst the other runners included Bannister (Gimcrack Stakes), Ghayth (third in the Champagne Stakes), Pomfret Lad (runner-up in the Mill Reef Stakes) and Bram Stoker (runner-up in the Coventry Stakes). Minardi started slowly and raced towards the rear of the field as the early pace was set by the outsiders Joplin and Red Carpet. The favourite made rapid progress to take the lead approaching the final furlong and stayed on to win by one and a half lengths and won by one and a half lengths from Endless Summer, with Red Carpet taking third ahead of Bad As I Wanna Be. According to the Racing Post he \\"outclassed one of the most competitive Middle Park fields we've seen in recent years\\". British bookmakers responded by making the colt favourite for the following year's 2000 Guineas Endless Summer was later disqualified in unusual circumstances when it was revealed that he had been foaled prematurely on 27 December 1997: he was therefore technically a three-year-old and ineligible to contest the race. It was expected that Minardi would end his season in the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket but was ruled out of the race after showing signs of respiratory infection. In the official International Classification for 2000, Minardi was rated the best two-year-old colt in Europe. =2001: three- year-old season= On his first appearance of the 2001 season, Minardi was sent to England again to contest the 2000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course on 5 May and started the 5/1 second favourite behind Tobougg in an eighteen-runner field. After being held up in the early stages he struggled to obtain a clear run in the final furlong before staying on to finish fourth behind Golan, Tamburlaine and Frenchmans Bay. Three weeks later he started 2/1 favourite for the Irish 2,000 Guineas at the Curragh but after taking second place in the straight he was unable to make further progress and finished third behind his stablemates Black Minnaloushe and Mozart. Minardi made little impact in three subsequent races starting with the St James's Palace Stakes in which he finished eighth behind Black Minnaloushe. He was then moved back to sprint distances and finished sixth in the Prix Maurice de Gheest and ninth in the Haydock Sprint Cup. Stud record At the end of his racing career Minardi was retired to become a breeding stallion. He stood in Europe and North America before being exported to New Zealand in 2006. He died on 30 October 2012. The best of his progeny were My Sweet Baby (Premio Regina Elena) and Ballet Pacifica (Prix Madame Jean Coturie).

Son of Johannes Franciscus Hubertus Cobbenhagen, candle maker, and Maria Catharina Hubertina Ramaekers.  Life  Cobbenhagen studied at the minor seminary (1906-1913), and at the major seminary (1913-1916 ) in Rolduc. He was ordained a priest in 1917, and continued his studies at the College of Business in Rotterdam (', today the Erasmus University Rotterdam), where he completed his master's in economics (1921). After his graduation he was invited as instructor in Rolduc, where he gave classes in business and religion. In 1927 Cobbenhagen defended his PhD in Economics under the supervision of . His doctoral dissertation was titled The responsibility in commercial enterprise ('). Cobbenhagen was one of the founders of the Catholic College of Economics () in 1927, the predecessor of Tilburg University. From 1929 to 1954 he was Professor of General Theory and History of Economics, and during this period he was elected Rector Magnificus of the same university for three times (1932 ‚Äì 1933; 1937 ‚Äì 1938; 1945 ‚Äì 1946). From 1935 until his death (1954) he was the editor of Economie, a journal of Tilburg economists having the mission of providing a space for contributions on issues of socio-economic planning. From July 1942 to April 1943 Cobbenhagen was interned in Haaren with other fellow-professors because of a satirical poem written by Frans van der Ven against Anton Mussert, leader of the NSB party. In 1947 he was appointed Secret Papal Chamberlain.  Ideas  = Academic contributions = Cobbenhagen's academic contributions do not include books but his dissertation. He wrote several manuscripts, classes and book reviews, which were later collected under the title The academic community in Tilburg. Collected essays and talks on academic practice, higher education in economics and the academic lifestyle () and published in 1945. These writings constitute the bulk of Cobbenhagen's academic production in economics, including economic doctrines concerning planning, price and wealth distribution. A selection of these writings are included in the volume \\"Cobbenhagen essays. The Founding Father's Idea of Tilburg University\\" (see below) = Educational project = Cobbenhagen's views on economics were inspired on his knowledge and practice of Catholic moral theology. He was the first in the Netherlands to introduce the idea that ethics and economics are not distinct fields of knowledge. In his educational project, the academic curriculum of economists would combine a solid academic basis with the application of academic knowledge to the practice of socioeconomic life. He proposed an interdisciplinary approach in which the study of economics curriculum included also courses in ethics, philosophy, psychology, and other social sciences. He promoted several academic initiatives to provide students with intellectual stimuli, and for his dedication to the administration of the College and his personal involvement in student life he merited the nickname of father of the college community. = Economic thinking = One of the principles of Cobbenhagen's economic thinking was that the economy is inherently linked to sociology and psychology. He believed that an economic science isolated from the rest of human knowledge contributed to human materialism and mechanization of life. A second important point was his philosophical and ethical treatment of economic issues, inspired by Catholic moral theology. The economy was, according to Cobbenhagen, at the crossroad between natural science and the humanities; as such, it should combine quantitative with qualitative elements. In his views the positivist analysis of economic factors (considered quantitatively as measurable entities interacting in a closed system governed by functional relationships) was only one-sided. A comprehensive economic analysis should drive to insights into the essence of things and to assess effectiveness. Thus a price doctrine explains the how price forms and how the equilibrium price originates, but also the why of price formation and equilibrium, and their effectiveness in practice. According to this practical criterion to evaluate comparative efficiency, Cobbenhagen saw the immediate and material economic prosperity of society as goals in light of a higher ultimate end, which to him was religious. This idea also opened the way to the development of evaluation theories in economic regulation and economic policy. = Philosophical view = Cobbenhagen's treatment of economic issues was rooted in the philosophical realm of neo- Thomism. According to Cobbenhagen, this approach was normative, and explicitly did not undermine the hardcore of theoretical economics. Accordingly, economics is a science which possesses the economy as its own formal object, that is the study of human behavior aimed at the welfare purpose, which is different from the formal object of ethics as a normative science. In his view, economics could be fully understood in its essence only when studied adopting a philosophical stand, combined with its quantitative and qualitative study. = Relationship with Catholic social thought = During the interwar period Cobbenhagen worked with other intellectuals, such as prof. J. A. Veraart, Mgr. prof. F. A. Weve, prof. H. A. Kaag and prof. C. P. M. Romme, which shared with him the same Catholic socio-economic ideas. Similar ideas were also the teaching of the Jesuit priest and economist Heinrich PeschPesch, Heinrich, Teaching Guide to Economics (Lehrbuch der National√∂konomie) (10 volumes), translated by Rupert J. Ederer, Edwin Mellen Press (2003)‚Äìreview; and, Storck, Thomas, \\"A Giant Among Catholic Economists\\", New Oxford Review (February 2005) (1854-1926) and are also contained in the papal encyclical letter Quadragesimo anno (1931). Cobbenhagen and his fellow intellectuals advocated solidarism as a socio economic planning principle to overcome both individualist capitalism and state socialism, and a view of society as a community having an organic and hierarchical order and organized according to the principle of subsidiarity.
