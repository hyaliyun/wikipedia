It was created by the team behind the sketch show Smack the Pony and hospital-based sitcom Green Wing, led by Victoria Pile who acts as co-writer, producer and director. It is set in the fictitious Kirke University and follows the lives of the staff, in particular the power-crazed and callous vice chancellor Jonty de Wolfe (played by Andy Nyman), lazy womanising English literature professor Matt Beer (Joseph Millson) and newly promoted senior mathematics lecturer Imogen Moffat (Lisa Jackson). Campus was first broadcast as a television pilot on Channel 4 on 6 November 2009, as part of the channel's Comedy Showcase season of comedy pilots. A full series was later commissioned and commenced airing on 5 April 2011, with the first episode being a re-shot and expanded version of the pilot. When first broadcast many critics claimed it was too similar to Green Wing and that much of the humour was offensive. However, others praised the show's dark humour and surrealism. Campus was cancelled after one series due to poor TV ratings. Over the course of the first series (not including the pilot) the average ratings were 554,000 viewers per episode, or 2.99% of the total audience, which is below the Channel 4 average. Plot Campus revolves around the lives of the staff of Kirke University, a plate glass university under the control of Vice Chancellor Jonty de Wolfe (Nyman). Wolfe is described as \\"a comedy grotesque\\", who wants Kirke and himself to become greater, no matter how it is done. He often gives out what he sees as the harsh truth to people but what others consider to be offensive and even bigoted remarks. He is assisted by the \\"Three Graces of Admin\\", three administrators all of whom are called Grace and are referred to as Grace 1, Grace 2 and Grace 3 or \\"Big Grace\\", \\"Pretty Grace\\" and \\"Was Once A Man Grace\\" (Alison Lintott, Chizzy Akudolu and Matthew Devitt respectively). One of Wolfe's plans is to exploit the success of newly promoted senior maths lecturer Imogen Moffat (Jackson) and her hit book The Joy of Zero, by ordering her to write a sequel and the other university staff also to write best selling books. His targets include English literature professor Matt Beer (Millson), an unrepentant womaniser, who does hardly any work and who is assisted by postgraduate student Flatpack (Jonathan Bailey), a man who reads hardly any books and instead is keen on sport. Beer tries to come up with ideas but spends more time annoying Moffat and mechanical engineering lecturer Lydia Tennant (Dolly Wells), who is annoyed by Moffat's success. Elsewhere in the university, Nicole Huggins (Sara Pascoe), an accommodations officer, makes an error in the university's accounting system. As a result, everyone in the university has received twice as much pay as normal, giving away over ¬£2 million. It is left to university accountant Jason Armitage (Will Adamsdale) to try to retrieve the money but he fails. The university is forced to call in Canadian restructuring guru Georgina \\"George\\" Bryan (Katherine Ryan). Due to her fondness for downsizing, Wolfe orders for Beer to seduce her in order to make her cuts less damaging. While Beer tries to carry out Wolfe's orders, he begins to develop feelings for Moffat and starts to suspect that he is falling in love with her. As he tries to reveal his feelings to Moffat, Bryan accepts Beer's offer of sex. In revenge Moffat has sex with Flatpack, who in turn begins to fall in love with Moffat. Meanwhile, Huggins attempts to make Armitage fall in love with her but when Armitage reveals that he is already in a relationship with Cecilia Hare (who does not appear in on screen), Huggins claims that she is a lesbian so that they can still be friends. By the end of the series, it emerges that Bryan's one night stand with Beer has left her pregnant. At the meeting in which she is due to publish her damaging final report on the university, her pregnancy causes her to re-evaluate her priorities, realising that destroying the lives and careers of the staff would be cruel. Wolfe persuades her to modify her report to put Kirke in a better light and offers her a job at the same time. The series ends without resolving the relationships between Beer and Moffat or Armitage and Huggins, who eventually sleep together in the final episode, with Huggins claiming that Armitage \\"turned\\" her heterosexual rather than reveal the fact that she lied. Production Campus shares connections with an earlier Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing. It has six of the same writers: Victoria Pile, Robert Harley, James Henry, Oriane Messina, Richard Preddy and Fay Rusling. It also has the same composer, Jonathan Whitehead. Campus references Green Wing in the show, with the motto of Kirke University being: \\"With wings.\\" Filming for the series took place during the summer months of 2010, at the University of Bath campus, with some additional internal shots being filmed at Buckinghamshire New University in High Wycombe. Campus was created by Pile, who also acted as producer and director. She set up the stories, ideas and characters. Once enough material was created, the actors were brought along to read the scripts with the other writers. Millson claimed that the eight writers went off and wrote their own version of the show, and then all the versions were read. Pile claims that she decided to set the show at a university because they display various kinds of relationships, similar to the hospital setting of Green Wing. Character development Jonty de Wolfe is described as a \\"pseudo-magic figure\\" by co-writer and editor Christian Sandino-Taylor. Nyman says that in his world, \\"you are never quite sure whether that's actually him doing stuff or just his madness... he's clearly potty.\\" Nyman was responsible for Wolfe's appearance, including his quiff hairstyle, and also Wolfe's use of other voices, which he has since gone to claim as being a form of multiple personality disorder. He also claims that Wolfe thinks he is sane, but is actually insane. Pile said of the character: \\"We've all had bosses that are power hungry and status obsessed and it's a kind of extension of what we all know and recognise in our fellow human beings, and sometimes in ourselves.\\" With regards to other characters, Messina describes Jason Armitage as being \\"awkward\\" and finding every situation difficult. Millson describes the relationship between Beer and Moffat as being similar to Benedick and Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing. Wells claims that Tennant, \\"has got to the point now where she'd be grateful for anything... but she would prefer a man\\". Ryan describes Bryan as being the show's villain. The characters Flatpack, Grace 2 and Grace 3 were not in the pilot and were later additions. Bailey describes the relationship between Flatpack and Beer as a, \\"one-sided unrequited beautiful love.\\" Bailey also claims that he is an \\"open book\\" due to his simpleness. Episodes Pilot (2009) Series 1 (2011) Reception Pilot The main characters in Campus. Top row, left-to- right, Flatpack (Bailey), Lydia Tennant (Wells), Imogen Moffat (Jackson), Nicole Huggins (Pascoe) and Jason Armitage (Adamsdale); Bottom row, left-to- right, Matt Beer (Millson), Jonty de Wolfe (Nyman) and George Bryan (Ryan). The pilot received a mixed reception when it was broadcast. Jane Simon in the Daily Mirror wrote that: \\"There are some very funny moments but the staff at Kirke are perhaps a little too eccentric for their own good. It's as if the challenge was how weird can we make these people and still have them breathe oxygen? Vice-chancellor Jonty (Andy Nyman) comes on like a more megalomaniac David Brent, while womanising English lecturer Matt Beer (think about it) and speccy maths star Imogen Moffat (Joseph Millson and Lisa Jackson) have big shoes to fill if they're to be Campus's answer to Guy [Secretan] and Caroline [Todd, characters from Green Wing].\\" Sam Wollaston of The Guardian disliked Campus, saying: \\"Ah, I see, Campus (Channel 4) is taking that path: the offensive one. There's nothing wrong with that; offence can be good, if done artfully. There's plenty of it here ‚Äì Jonty's bigotry and English literature lecturer Matt Beer's (comedy name, like beer mat, but the other way round!) sex pesting. There is talk of rape by pigs, and odd-shaped anal cavities that lead to odd-shaped stools. I'm just not convinced it is being done very artfully. It seems more like offence for the sake of offence. Compare it with the beautifully crafted filth of Malcolm Tucker in The Thick of It. If he is the Michelangelo of offence, this is Rolf Harris.\\" However, Caitlin Moran of The Times praised it saying she hoped a full series would be made. She wrote of the pilot: \\"Although, like Green Wing, Campus works as an ensemble of freaks, perhaps the most intriguing mutant is Vice Chancellor Jonty de Wolfe (Andy Nyman). Initially, he looks like the weakest character ‚Äì a small, bumptious David Brent clone who keeps attempting Jamaican patois to make a point. But by the end of the show he has turned into a more sinister version of the shopkeeper in Mr Benn ‚Äì wandering around the library in a floor-length taffeta ballgown, urging depressed students to commit suicide and, on one occasion, simply disappearing in the middle of a monologue, as if it were a Las Vegas floor-show, leaving his English lecturer Matthew Beer (Joseph Millson) holding a madly clattering clockwork monkey, and his jaw.\\" Series 1 The first series also had a mixed reaction. Tim Dowling in The Guardian wrote that: \\"The central problem with Campus is that the gossamer-thin thread that tethered Green Wing to a plot has here completely snapped. Everything is too surreal and unmoored. Vice-chancellor Jonty de Wolfe (Andy Nyman) is meant to be monstrously ambitious, but he's just monstrous. He's all over the place ‚Äì shouting out the window, jumping out of cupboards, putting on accents and indulging in freeform sexist and/or racist rants. His character isn't identifiably pathetic, cynical, inadequate or insane; he isn't even a character, really.\\" Graeme Thomson wrote for The Arts Desk that, \\"Campus tilled familiar ground with diminishing returns and zero warmth\\", while Dan Owen for Obsessed With Film about Wolfe that: \\"He's David Brent meets Charles Manson. It's just a shame his performance is just one of many bonkers turns, because there's so much weirdness it almost becomes suffocating.\\" There were positive reviews of Campus. Rob Clyne wrote for Sabotage Times that: \\"The overall picture of Campus isn't yet a clear one. At times it feels a little like a few sketches have been slung together, especially as a lot of the Jonty stuff comes out of nowhere. But these are only small gripes ‚Äì Campus is hugely original, some may say it is genre defining. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but this is pure entertainment which doesn't need to fall under a specific category.\\" Louisa Mellor from Den of Geek attacked some of the complaints against the show saying: \\"The complaint about implausibility in comedy always baffles me. No, you wouldn't meet people like these in real life. Yes, they are unrealistic. We are all talking about sitcom aren't we? Jonty, Matt, Lydia et al are comic creations, little grains of truth worked up into misshaped pearls of comedy weirdness. It might help to place it on the family tree of The Kids in the Hall, Big Train or (at a fairly hefty push) Monty Python, rather than as having descended from the much more straightforward worlds of The Royle Family or The Office.\\" On BBC Radio 4 Extra's comedy discussion show What's So Funny? host Rufus Hound and guest Dom Joly both enjoyed the show. Joly described the show as, \\"one of the funniest things I've seen in three or four years. It made me laugh so much, so quickly.\\" Cancellation Campus was cancelled in June 2011 after one series due to poor viewing figures. Following from the pilot which attracted 900,000 viewers (5% of the total viewing audience), the first episode of the first series attracted only 610,000 viewers (3.7%). The other episodes attracted 540,000 viewers (3.2%), 380,000 viewers (2.3%), 430,000 viewers (2.5%), 440,000 viewers (2.5%), and 360,000 viewers (2.1%) respectively. Over the course of the first series (not including the pilot) the average ratings for the series were 554,000 viewers (2.99%), below the Channel 4 average. A spokesman for Channel 4 said that, \\"C4 are very proud to have championed Campus and those fans who watched adored it, but there simply weren't enough of them to justify a second series.\\" After the series was cancelled, fans of the show complained to Channel 4. Out of 105 complaints that were sent to Channel 4 about Campus in June 2011, most of them complained about the programme's cancellation. It was the second most complained about programme on Channel 4 that month, after the documentary Sri Lanka's Killing Fields. Merchandise A DVD of the first series was released on 16 May 2011\\\\. It features deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes documentary, and a re-edited version of the ending to the series as extras. While the Comedy Showcase pilot version of the first episode has not yet been released on DVD, it is currently watchable available via Channel 4's on demand service 4oD and in August 2016 it was added to Netflix worldwide.

Still in 2017 the fort is exiting in natural shape. History During Talpur rule over Sindh, Mir Fateh Ali Khan abandoned Khudabad and shifted his capital to Hyderabad in 1789. He also used the Hyderabad Fort to reside and hold his court in it. He added a Haram and other buildings to accommodate the ruling family and his relations. To enable residents to fulfill their religious obligation, he also commissioned the building of Mosques. During this period of the Mirs‚Äô the fort was gradually swarmed with the shabby and odd buildings of the working class for their habitation. After defeating the Mirs‚Äô in the battle of Miani in 1843, the British occupied the fort. Blasts in the fort, later on, destroyed most of the buildings and houses of the public. In 1857, the British razed most of the remaining buildings to ground to making room to accommodate troops and military stores.

He and Solie also hosted a popular segment on the show, \\"Pro Wrestling This Week\\", which discussed the then current news from the \\"Big Three\\" (AWA, NWA and the WWF) and regional promotions. Scott Hudson and Steve Prazak, both former WCW announcers, were fans of the show and given their first big break by Pedicino when he began promoting events in the late 1980s. Bill Apter, editor of Pro Wrestling Illustrated, has also credited Pedicino for considerably raising his profile among wrestling fans due to his weekly segment. He was also the booker and part owner of the Global Wrestling Federation with former USWA commentator Max Andrews, as well as part of the announcing team for GWF Wrestling Superstars on ESPN, and had a similar role in the short-lived Ladies Professional Wrestling Association. Popularly known as the \\"round mound of sound\\", Pedicino has been compared to some of the top commentators of the mid-to late 1980s and is regarded as one of the most recognizable personalities during the final years of the \\"territory era\\". Brian Westcott, wrestling historian and writer, has called Pedicino one of his all-time favorite play-by-play/color commentators. Following his retirement from wrestling, Pedicino owned and operated local radio stations based in central Georgia, as well as general sales manager for WCNN radio Atlanta. Pedicino was also a management consultant for several major media companies including Turner Broadcasting, Susquehanna Broadcasting and Clear Channel Broadcasting. He and his wife also began a successful publishing company, Food Fax, which puts out six annual specialty advertising guides.

Eight different wrestling organizations from as far away as Dallas, Texas and Birmingham, Alabama were broadcast during its first year. These would later include the Continental Wrestling Association, Deep South Championship Wrestling, Mid-South Wrestling and World Class Championship Wrestling as well as events from around the world. Because the show never disclosed that the wrestling being shown was pre-taped, with Pedicino adding commentary later on, fans watching the show at home would often travel to the studio hoping to attend the show. In November, twenty fans drove in a van all the way from Snellville, Georgia to the locked studio in downtown Atlanta only to be turned away by security. Pedicino served as both executive producer and host throughout its near 7-year run. He was joined by fellow ring announcer Rhubarb Jones and 21-year-old Boni Blackstone, who later became his wife. Blackstone had been one of 20 girls, chosen out of a total of 70, to become Pedicino's co-host. Gordon Solie, a popular wrestling announcer, also joined the show as a regular color commentator. Solie would also host a featured segment with Pedicino, \\"Pro Wrestling This Week\\", which discussed wrestling news from around the country. They were sometimes joined by Bill Apter, who had his own segment, and co-produced interview segments with Pro Wrestling Illustrated featuring many wrestling stars of the 1980s. Apter's appearances, as well as those on TBS, considerably raised his profile among wrestling fans of the era. The show was watched in over 20 major television markets in its first year. By the summer of 1987, the show broadcast in 40 cities, including New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago, and eventually syndicated throughout the country. Pedicino and Blackstone became seen as local celebrities in Atlanta but Pedicino brushed off the attention regarding themselves as \\"wrestling fans who got lucky\\". Earlier that year, he and Blackstone hosted the three-day 20th annual Miller High Life World of Wheels car show held at Atlanta's World Congress Center. Sponsored by the National Automotive Parts Association, the event displayed over 500 of the most expensive custom designed antique vehicles in the world including the 18-wheel Volvo \\"Elvis' Eldorado\\".

Biello and Richard Williams; the third show raised enough money to purchase 200-300 bulletproof vests of the 1,100 needed for the Atlanta Police Department.Greppi, Michele. Unlikely tag team finds perfect match in TV wrestling fans. The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution. 17 Jun. 1988: C1 Four months later, Pedicino appeared with a number of media figures and television celebrities at a benefit show, \\"Celebrity Cookoff for a Cure\\", held by the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation at Benihana. Other participants included Atlanta Magazine editor Lee Walburn, Atlanta Business Chronicle editor Anita Sharpe, Creative Loafing publisher Deborah Eason and local WSB-TV personalities John Pruitt and Bebe Emerman.Graham, Keith. \\"Reach Out: Good Meal Ambassadors.\\" The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution. 16 Nov. 1988: D2  Georgia All-Star Wrestling and marriage to Boni Blackstone  Pedicino started his own wrestling promotion, Georgia All-Star Wrestling, in 1989. Having been an announcer for Jim Crockett Promotions, Pedicino was able to bring in a number of former stars from around the region. Among these included Jimmy Holiday, Tony Zane, Billy Starr, John MichaelsDa Costa, Norman. \\"Pssst! Keep it quiet but Mr. Perfect won.\\" The Toronto Star. 3 May 1990: C5 and Mr. Wrestling II, then working for Jody Hamilton's Deep South Championship Wrestling. Future WCW star Marcus Bagwell also made his debut in the promotion under the name Fabian. In early-1990, he hired Scott Hudson and Steve Prazak as announcers for the promotion. According to Hudson in a later interview, both men had been fans of his show and they persuaded Pedicino to hire them for free after a poor performance given by the regular announcer at a show in Carrollton, Georgia. As Hudson and Prazak had prior experience in radio and television, they soon became valuable members of the promotion. Pedicino later brought the two with him when he became involved with the Global Wrestling Federation. He and Hudson were also given their own segment on Superstars of Wrestling, styled in a comedic \\"Laurel and Hardy\\" fashion, called \\"Point- Counterpoint\\" which was sometimes aired on ESPN for the GWF. Craig Johnson, then a play-by-play commentator for the United States Wrestling Association, was also hired by Pedicino as head announcer over other applicants including Chris Cruise and Eric Bischoff. That same year, he and Blackstone became married. This came as a surprise, both to wrestling fans and the staff, as the two had a well-known kayfabe adversarial relationship on the show much like Gorilla Monsoon and Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan on WWF Wrestling Challenge. Pedicino played the \\"straight man\\" of the team who teased and played pranks on Blackstone. The two would continue their routines off-camera, keeping even the studio in the dark, by driving home in separate cars and Blackstone addressing her then boyfriend as \\"Mr. Pedicino\\" in front of studio employees during the first two years of their relationship. Global Wrestling Federation With the close of Fritz von Erich's World Class Championship Wrestling the previous year, he and former USWA commissioner Max Andrews decided to start a new promotion and moved into the Dallas-area in June 1991. It was claimed that this new promotion, the Global Wrestling Federation, was an established wrestling organization that promoted events worldwide and intended to become a competitor of World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation. Pedicino and Andrews were originally backed by a supposed Nigerian businessman, Olu Oliami, who had offered to invest $10 million in the promotion. When the deal fell through, Pedicino instead went to the Overton family for assistance. The Overtons later backed out as well and Pedicino took on the bulk of the financial backing himself. By late 1991, he had signed a deal with ESPN to air GWF events from the Global Dome as well as purchasing the United States Wrestling Association's syndicated time slot from Jerry Jarrett providing additional television coverage for the GWF. Joined by Craig Johnson, Scott Hudson and Steve Prazak, Pedicino and his wife became part of the regular GWF broadcast team on ESPN. As well as being a major on-air personality for the promotion, Pedicino was also involved in a major storyline which saw him reveal GWF Commissioner Max Andrews as the unknown leader of the heel stable The Cartel (Rip Rogers, Cactus Jack, Scotty the Body and Makhan Singh). In October 1991, Pedicino turned over his booking position to Eddie Gilbert. While television ratings improved under Gilbert, house show attendance dwindled due to declining business brought on by a series of scandals in the wrestling industry involving the World Wrestling Federation. The cost of maintaining the roster as well as television production costs slowly drained the promotion's finances. The financial situation became so serious that the promotion was forced to release Pedicino and Blackstone, Eddie Gilbert, Craig Johnson and other key GWF members on April 9, 1992.Marvez, Alex. \\"Rib Injury Sidelines Sting.\\" The Miami Herald. 19 Apr. 1992: 10D Pedicino sold his share of the promotion and the GWF eventually folded after going through a series of failed owners including Grey Pierson and Jim Crockett. Retirement and later years Back in Atlanta, creative differences eventually caused Pedicino and Solie to part ways and Pedicino decided to end Superstars of Wrestling in August 1992. He and Blackstone started their own business, Max Foods, that same year. The business initially began by publishing a two-page fax listing of 24 restaurants and their daily specials to office workers.Vesey, Susannah. \\"Peach Buzz: Tag Team Fax.\\" The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution. 21 Sept. 1992: C2 The first company of its kind, the listing was sent out five nights a week to over 1,000 businesses in the Cobb County area. In 1993, Blackstone was brought to the WWF as an interviewer for several months while Pedicino joined Sgt. Slaughter, Jim Cornette and Ken Resnick as commentators in Ladies Professional Wrestling Association. Although he considered bringing back Superstars of Wrestling, Pedicino instead distanced himself from professional wrestling and returned to the radio industry. He was hired as management consultant for several major media companies including Turner Broadcasting, Blair Broadcasting, Outlet Broadcasting, Susquehanna Broadcasting, and Clear Channel Broadcasting. He was also the owner and general manager of several Georgia-based radio stations, most notably WMKJ,Longino, Miriam. \\"On Radio - After 10-year wait, there's Magic in the air.\\" The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution. 17 Dec. 1997: B2 and WMGP,\\"Digest: Radio station changes hands.\\" LaGrange Daily News. 19 Aug. 2007: A007 and produced WTLK TV-14 infomercial \\"Shoppers' Showcase\\" with his wife prior to joining Legacy Media Holdings as vice president and chief marketing officer in 1996. In August 2000, Pedicino and his wife Boni began hosting Pro Wrestling this Week on FOX Sports Radio, which ran on Sunday nights from 11:00 pm to 1:00 am, and later appeared together at the NWA 52nd Anniversary Show. In July 2007, Pedicino bought WEKS, which was given approval by the Federal Communications Commission to increase its broadcasting range two months later. The country music station, originally only available in Griffin, Georgia, could then be heard on 92.5 FM in Troup, Meriwether, Coweta, Pike and Spalding counties.

The boats featured a mixture of Western and Eastern equipment, including Soviet anti-ship missiles and Swedish guns. During the Croatian War of Independence one ship, Vlado ƒÜetkoviƒá, was captured by Croatian forces while being overhauled. It was eventually commissioned with the Croatian Navy as ≈†ibenik and is still in use. The remaining five ships were relocated to Montenegro, entering service with the new FR Yugoslav Navy, with three of them being decommissioned in the early 2000s. The last two ships of the class are planned to be modified as patrol boats for service with the Montenegrin Navy.  Description  The Konƒçar class was developed by the Brodarski institut (BI) from Zagreb. The six-strong class was built at the Tito's Kraljevica Shipyard from 1977 to 1979 with all six ships being named after People's Heroes of Yugoslavia. The ships measure in length, with a beam and draught. The hull, similar to the Swedish Spica class, is made of steel with an aluminium superstructure. Fully loaded they displace and are manned by a crew of 30. The class utilizes a CODAG engine configuration for propulsion. Mounted on four shafts, two MTU 16V 538 TB91 diesel engines are used for economical cruising while two RR Marine Proteus 52 M gas turbines are used for achieving high speeds. Cruising speed is while the maximum achievable speed is . Travelling at a near maximum speed of 38 knots, the ships have a maximum range of . Powered by diesel engines only and travelling at a speed of they have a range of , with exact numbers varying from source to source. Endurance is between five and seven days. Gun armament of the class consists of two Bofors /70 Mk1 gun mounted on the bow and towards the stern. During the development phase, the designers planned on using French Exocet anti-ship missiles as the class's main weapon system. However, due to the high price the French asked for the missile, possibly because of political reasons, the project was changed and two Soviet P-20 (SS-N-2B) were used instead. Self-defense measures include two Wallop Barricade chaff launchers.  Ships  {wikitable width=65% - valign=top !  Name !  Pennant number !  Namesake !  Builder !  Launched !  Commissioned !

Two RBS-15 launchers and the AK-630 CIWS are visible. During the late 1980s and early 1990s Rade Konƒçar and Vlado ƒÜetkoviƒá underwent a modernization program which included removing the stern 57 mm Bofors and installing a Soviet AK-630 CIWS. At the start of the Croatian War of Independence, Vlado ƒÜetkoviƒá was captured by Croatian forces in ≈†ibenik while being overhauled. It was commissioned with the Croatian Navy on 28 September 1991 as ≈†ibenik (RTOP-21). Sometime between 1991 and 1994 ≈†ibenik underwent a refit that included removing the P-20 launchers and installing two mounts for up to four Swedish built RBS-15 anti-ship missiles. As of 2014 ≈†ibenik is in active service with the Croatian Navy. The rest of the class remained in hands of the Yugoslav Navy. On 6 October, Hasan Zahiroviƒá-Laca along with the Koni- class frigate Koper (VPBR-32) took part in the Battle of Zadar. Croatian coastal batteries in the area operated two captured Bofors guns with only one of them being in position to open fire on the ships. The initial five to six rounds fired at Hasan Zahiroviƒá-Laca missed their target, after which the gun malfunctioned. After a quick repair, the missile boat was targeted again, with three rounds hitting the stern section and causing no damage because the gun crew didn't have armor-piercing ammunition at their disposal. Two Konƒçar-class missile boats also took part in the Battle of the Dalmatian Channels. Jordan Nikolov-Orce, operating under the codename \\"Parak\\", and Ante Banina, under the codename \\"Pakra\\", were members of the tactical group \\"Vis\\" which was tasked with enforcing a naval blocade of the city of Split and the surrounding islands. With the Yugoslav People's Army endings its campaign in Croatia, all ships of the class, excluding Vlado ƒÜetkoviƒá, were relocated to Montenegro where they were commissioned with the new FR Yugoslav Navy of Serbia and Montenegro. Three boats of the class took part in the Lido II incident.  Post-war service  Kralj-class missile boats, Kralj Dmitar Zvonimir (RTOP-12) (center) and Kralj Petar Kre≈°imir IV (RTOP-11) (right) During the mid 1990s, Ramiz Sadiku was docked for a major overhaul and reconstruction. However, due to the lack of funds the work was never completed and the boat was decommissioned and eventually sold for scrap. The boat's superstructure, propulsion, sensors and weapon systems were dismantled, after which the new owner moved the boat to an underground naval dock on the Lu≈°tica peninsula. The boat remained there for several years, before its deteriorating condition caused it to sink inside the dock. The wreck was raised in 2014 and towed to Zelenika where it was broken up to smaller segments which were then transported to the Nik≈°iƒá steel factory. In June 2006, Hasan Zahiroviƒá-Laca sailed from Boka Kotorska to Italy to participate in the international naval exercise \\"Adrion Livex 06\\". The boat left port under the flag of the Navy of Serbia and Montenegro, but because Montenegro declared its independence on 6 June while the boat was still out on exercise, Hasan Zahiroviƒá-Laca became the first ship outside of Montenegrin waters to display the flag of the new country. The boat was decommissioned later that year, along with the first boat of the class, Rade Konƒçar. The latter was sold to Kenya in 2014 for an undisclosed price. The Kenyan Navy plans on stripping the boat of its guns and fire-control systems which would then be overhauled and installed on the offshore patrol vessel KNS Jasiri. Rade Konƒçar itself is then expected to be rebuilt and used by the Navy as a patrol boat. The fate of Hasan Zahiroviƒá- Laca remains unknown. RTOP-405 in service with the Montenegrin Navy photographed in 2015. In 2013, the Ministry of Defense of Montenegro issued the Strategic Overview of the Defense of Montenegro (Strategijski pregled odbrane Crne Gore) in which it was stated that until sufficient funds to acquire new patrol boats were made available, the Montenegrin Navy would modify two Konƒçar-class missile boats, RTOP-405 and RTOP-406, for use as patrol boats. In February 2014 it was revealed that the Montenegrin Ministry of Defense chose the Brodarski institut from Zagreb to create the project documentation for the modification of the missile boats. As planned, the boats would be stripped of their missile launchers and the aft Bofors gun to allow a rigid-hulled inflatable boat to be carried.

Moreover, radial velocity variations would also hint two strong signals at 8.5 and 1340 days. The former periodicity is likely due to stellar pulsation, whereas the latter could be indicative of the presence of an additional planetary companion with 2.14 Jupiter masses, moderate eccentricity (e=0.13) and located at 2.6 Astronomical Units away from the giant star. Nevertheless, the nature of such a signal is still unclear and further investigations are needed to confirm or rule out an additional substellar companion.

The two nuclear bombs being ferried were found \\"relatively intact in the middle of the wreckage\\", and after Fort Meade's 28th Ordnance Detachment secured them, the bombs were removed two days later to the Cumberland Municipal Airport. Accident description The B-52D was returning to Georgia from Massachusetts after an earlier Chrome Dome airborne alert to Europe. Near Meyersdale, Pennsylvania, on a path east of Salisbury, Pennsylvania; and after altitude changes to evade severe turbulence; the vertical stabilizer broke off. The aircraft was left uncontrollable as a result; the pilot ordered the crew to bail out, and the aircraft crashed. The wreckage of the aircraft was found on the Stonewall Green farm. Today, the crash site is in a private meadow of Elbow Mountain within Savage River State Forest, along the public Savage Mountain Trail just north of the Pine Swamp Road crossing. Crew As the only crew member who did not eject, the radar bombardier died in the crash and was not located until more than 24 hours afterward. The navigator and tail gunner died of exposure in the snow. The navigator's frozen body was found two days after the accident, from the crash and away from where his orange parachute was found high in a tree near Poplar Lick Run. Unable to disentangle his chute he released the Koch fittings and fell over thirty feet through the tree, suffering injuries from the branches; his survival tent and other gear remained in the tree. He then attempted to find shelter and \\"meandered\\", eventually falling down a steep slope in the dark into a river basin. After landing in the \\"Dye Factory field\\", the tail gunner trekked in the dark with a broken leg and other injuries over to the embankment of Casselman River ‚Äì in which his legs were frozen when his body was found five days later, from a Salisbury street light. The pilot parachuted onto Maryland's Meadow Mountain ridge near the Mason‚ÄìDixon line and, after being driven to the Tomlinson Inn on the National Road in Grantsville, notified the United States Air Force of the crash. The co-pilot landed near New Germany Road, remained where he landed, and stayed \\"cozy warm\\" until rescued.

In some cases the sensory map is simply a topographic representation of a sensory surface such as the skin, cochlea, or retina. In other cases it represents other stimulus properties resulting from neuronal computation and is generally ordered in a manner that reflects the periphery. An example is the somatosensory map which is a projection of the skin's surface in the brain that arranges the processing of tactile sensation. This type of somatotopic map is the most common, possibly because it allows for physically neighboring areas of the brain to react to physically similar stimuli in the periphery or because it allows for greater motor control. The somatosensory cortex is adjacent to the primary motor cortex which is similarly mapped. Sensory maps may play an important role in facilitating motor responses. Other examples of sensory map organization may be that adjacent brain regions are related through proximity of the receptors that they process as in the map of the cochlea in the brain, or that similar features are processed as in the map of the feature detectors or the retinotopic map, or that time codes are used in organization as in the maps of an owl's sense of direction via interaural time difference between ears. These examples exist in contrast to non-mapped or randomly distributed patterns of processing. An example of a non-mapped sensory processing system is the olfactory system where unrelated odorants are processed side-by-side in the olfactory bulb. In addition to non-mapped and mapped processing, stimuli may be processed under multiple maps as in the human visual system. Neurobiology Sensory maps are created primarily within the somatosensory cortex, also referred to as the sensory cortex. The central nervous system is attached to this cortex and all other parts of an organism‚Äôs body. Both the somatosensory cortex and the central nervous system are made up of neurons which create associations with each other to transmit electrical impulses throughout the body. The central nervous system, when made aware of various stimuli without the body, sends signals to the brain. These signals are sent by different parts of the body e.g. the auditory system, system that uses touch, and visual system. Each system produces different sensory maps that are connected to analyze an organism‚Äôs surroundings more thoroughly. For one sensory system there are multiple maps that analyze the stimulus. These maps work together to glean spatial, characteristic, and action information from surroundings. An organism then acts based on the information they receive and already have. Scientists speculate that these nerve connections have grown increasingly over the lifetime of an organism and have also been genetically passed on by earlier generations. Functions Mapped sensory processing areas are a complex phenomenon and must therefore serve an adaptive advantage as it is highly unlikely for complex phenomena to appear otherwise. Sensory maps are also very old in evolutionary history as they are nearly ubiquitous in all species of animals and are found for nearly all sensory systems. The dynamic nature of neurons, which collect sensory information to create these maps, allow different stimuli to change maps made by other sensory neurons in the past. Also, for one sensory system there can be multiple different maps working together to analyze different aspects of a stimulus. Some advantages of sensory maps have been elucidated by scientific exploration: *Adaptation: Maps can be adjusted by stimuli outside of their originally being created. For example: if a sensory map has been made by visual stimulation, auditory stimuli, that expresses different information than seen before, can adjust the sensory map and make it more accurate in understanding of an organism‚Äôs surroundings. Sensory maps contain an adaptive characteristic that enables them to connect to many different neurons and still gain understanding of an organism‚Äôs environment. Nevertheless, sensory maps can be passed from generation to generation genetically. * Filling In: When sensory stimulation is organized in the brain in some form of topographic pattern, then the animal might be able to ‚Äúfill in‚Äù information that is missing using neighboring regions of the map since they will usually be activated together when all information is present. Loss of signal from one area can be filled in from adjacent areas of the brain if those areas are for physically related parts of the periphery . This is evident in animal studies where the neurons bordering a lesioned, or damaged, brain area (which used to process the sense of touch in a hand) to recover processing of that sensory region because they process information from adjacent hand areas.Jain, N., Qi, H.X., Collins, C.E., and Kass, J.H. (1989), Large-Scale Reorganization in the Somatosensory Cortex and Thalamus after Sensory Loss in Macaque Monkeys. Journal of Neuroscience. Vol 28(43): 11042‚Äì11060 * Lateral Inhibition: Lateral inhibition is an organizing principle, it allows contrast in many systems from the visual to the somatosensory. This means that if adjacent areas inhibit one another then stimulation which activates one brain region can simultaneously inhibit the adjoining brain regions to create a sharper resolution between stimuli. This is evident in the visual system of humans where sharp lines can be detected between bright and dark regions because of simple cells which inhibit their neighbors.Studies show that two different types of stimuli can send signals to the central nervous system and the most recent can alter the other stimulus. Building of sensory maps through sensory inhibition can be affected by timing a great deal. Recency and repetition between two stimuli that are associated with each other will adjust sensory maps to create the most accurate understanding of a person‚Äôs environment. Lateral inhibition also aides in discriminating between two different stimuli when they are supposed to be combined. For example, within a movie or video where the sound and images are supposed to be synchronous. If the sound is on different timing than that of the images on the screen, lateral inhibition helps a person to discriminate between when the sound and images were synchronous, and when they were synchronous. * Summation: Organization also allows related stimuli to be summed in the neural assessment of sensory information. Examples of this are found in the summation of tactile inputs neurally or visual inputs under low light.Laughlin, S. (1989), The Role of Sensory Adaptation in the Retina. Journal of Experimental Biology. 146, 39-6 in data analysis within sciences and corporations, because it exemplifies hierarchical order that generates efficiency. *Behavioral Influence: Sensory maps are associated with motor reflexes that react to sensory information. In other words, the sensory and motor systems are intertwined with sensory maps. Reactions to stimuli are based upon a hierarchical system which organizes the most important stimuli to the least. The motor system then reacts or does not react based upon the level of importance. Types Topographic maps These maps may be thought of as a mapping of the surface of the body onto the brain structure. Phrased another way, topographic maps are organized in the neural system in a manner that is a projection of the sensory surface within the brain. This means that the organization in the periphery mirrors the order of the information processing in the brain. This organization can be somatotopic,Killackey, H.P., Rhoadesb, R.W., Bennet-Clarke, C.A., (1995), The formation of a cortical somatotopic map, Trends in Neurosciences. Vol.18(9), 402-407 as in the tactile sense of touch, or tonotopic,Kaltenbach J.A., Czaja J.M., Kaplan CR., (1992), Changes in the tonotopic map of the dorsal cochlear nucleus following induction of cochlear lesions by exposure to intense sound. Hearing Research. 59(2):213-23 as in the ear, and the retinotopic map which is laid out in the brain as the cells are arranged on the retina. Neurons on the surface of the body have importance in our day to day life. There are more neurons connected to the parts of the surface of the body when the neuron‚Äôs roles are more important than other neurons in relation to our well-being. Phantom limbs activate sensory maps according to scientists. Because there is no actual connection between the amputee limb and the rest of the body, it is assumed that when the limb was detached from the rest of the body the sensory maps which were created before the amputation, are still active and are being activated without an actual stimulus. =Examples= * Wilder PenfieldPenfield, W., Rasmussen, T., (1950), The cerebral cortex of man: a clinical study of localization of function, Macmillan. discovered the original topographic map in the form of the internal somatosensory Homunculus. His work on human neural systems showed that the brain areas that processed tactile sensations are mapped in the same fashion that the body is laid out. This sensory map exaggerates certain regions that have many peripheral sense cells like the lips and hands while reduces the relative space for processing areas with few receptors like the back. * Hair cells in the auditory system display tonotopic organization.R.V., Ibrahim, D., and Mount, R.J., (1998), Plasticity of tonotopic maps in auditory midbrain following partial cochlear damage in the developing chinchilla, Experimental Brain Research. Vol 123(4), 1432-1106 This tonotopic arrangement means that cells are laid out to range from low frequency to high frequency and processed in that same organization within the brain. Computational maps These maps are organized entirely in the neural system or organized in a manner not present in the periphery. Sensory information for computational maps comes from auditory and visual stimuli . Thus, any auditory or visual information that is constructed by neural computation, which is when the brain relates two or more bits of information in order to obtain some new information from them, can combine to change the already existing sensory map to include the new information. Often these maps involve comparing, as in performing subtraction to get a time delay, two stimuli, like incoming sound information from different ears, in order to produce a valuable new bit of information about those stimuli, as in where they originated. The process just described takes place in the owl's neural system very rapidly. =Examples= * The Jeffres Map was a theory of how the brain might compute interaural time differences (ITD), or differences in time of stimulus arrival between the two ears. Jeffres was famous for producing a theoretical mechanism for making a place map out of timing information, this explained how some animals could appear to have a \\"look-up map\\" for where a sound came from. The neural system computes this ITD in the Owl Auditory System and the real neural system was found to almost exactly match the Jeffres Map theory.Carr, C.E., Konishi, M., (1988), Axonal delay lines for time measurement in the owl's brainstem. Neurobiology. Vol. 85, pp. 8311-8315 The Jeffres Map shows how ITD signals are used to determine distance and direction in the owl. * Feature Detectors in a visual system are another example of computational maps. No part of the physical system in the eyes actually analyzes for features like simple cells in the brain do. This system is well studied in frogs. It is known that frogs detect specific \\"worm-like\\" features in their environment and, controlled entirely by the neural system, will lunge at them even if they are a series of white squares in a line imitating a basic worm.Carew, T.J. (2000), Behavioral neurobiology: The Cellular Organization of Natural Behavior, Sinauer Associates. Creating illusions within our sensory maps is a way that organisms fill in for unknown information about their surroundings. * There is also an Frequency Modulation to Frequency Modulation Comparison in the Bat Auditory System which is used in echolocation. This FM-FM comparison determines flutter of their target and was made famous in work by Suga.Suga, N. (1989), Principles of auditory information-processing derived from neuroethology. Journal of Experimental Biology. Vol 146(1): 277-286 * When motor and sensory systems were studied by way of fish, scientists found that there could be computational maps made between the two. Fish whose central nervous system was inactivated, for a specific appendage, adjusted their previous natural behavior. Scientists believe that sensory information often precedes the actions and decisions made by organisms. Thus, when there is additional information given by outside stimuli, or lack of it, their behavior changes to adapt to new surroundings. Abstract maps Abstract maps are maps that are also created by stimuli outside of an organism, but it has no surface by which it creates a map in the brain. They are ordered like topographical and computational maps, but their features are abstract. These types of maps are associated with seeing color.

The Argentine university reform of 1918 was a general modernization of the universities, especially tending towards democratization, brought about by student activism during the presidency of Hipolito Yrigoyen, the first democratic government. The events started in C√≥rdoba and spread to the rest of Argentina, and then through much of Latin America. The reform set up the freedom for universities to define their own curriculum and manage their own budget without interference from the central government. This has had a profound effect on academic life at the universities through the nationalization process that boasts academic freedom and independence throughout the university life. Background Ever since the Jesuits founded the first university in Argentina in the 17th century, education was managed by the clergy and conservative upper-class citizens . The universities' authorities were selected by them, and professors were appointed for life. Professors also decided on the subjects to be taught, usually following the preferences of the Church and suppressed modern ideas such as Darwin's theory of evolution By the end of the 19th century many changes were taking place in Argentina. With the arrival of European immigrants in large waves, new ideas arrived with them which were opposed to the old oligarchic conservatism. The 1912 S√°enz Pe√±a Law of the secret vote brought the less conservative Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen to the presidency in 1916. It was in 1918 that the students of the National University of C√≥rdoba, probably the most conservative in Argentina at that time, demanded a revision of the university's statutes to modernize and democratize them. They succeeded in creating student centres, but their demands were ignored. Demands The demands of the students can be summarized in four main topics: *University autonomy: the right for the university to choose its own government, professors and studies without the intervention of the government or any other organism.Carmen Bernand, ¬´ D‚Äôune rive √† l‚Äôautre ¬ª, Nuevo Mundo Mundos Nuevos, Materiales de seminarios, 2008 (Latin-Americanist Review published by the EHESS), Put on line on 15 June 2008. URL : http://nuevomundo.revues.org//index35983.html Accessed on 28 July 2008. *Co-government: the equality of all parties in the university (students, professors and graduated students) to participate in the election of the above. *Scientific modernization: a review of the contents of curricula, to include modern scientific knowledge to the study material. *No tuition: the right for every student to acquire university education. *Secular education: education programs and syllabuses free of Catholic dogmatism. Features The most important features of the Reform described in the Liminar Manifesto can be summarized as follows: :a) Institutionalization of student participation in university councils, joining professors and alumni in a three-party system known as co-governance. :b) A linkage between student politics and national politics in order to mobilize the university toward the solution of economic, social and political problems. :c) An emphasis on university extension, particularly courses for workers that would lead to the development of fraternal bonds with the proletariat. :d) Tuition-free education and open admission to all academically qualified applicants, in order to replace the elitist and archaic 19th century university with a democratic, modern and mass university. :e) A defense of institutional autonomy with respect to the state. :f) Institutionalization of mechanisms to protect academic freedom, including the implementation of \\"free teaching\\" (docencia libre) to ensure academic pluralism and to break the monopoly of teaching enjoyed by senior professors (catedr√°ticos). :g) Promotion of new ideas, innovative methods of teaching, changes in exam systems, optional classroom attendance, original research, and a rejection of dogmatism, all leading to the replacement of theology by positivist disciplines. :h) Selection of faculty through open, competitive examinations in order to counteract nepotism and patronage, and promotion of professors on the basis of merit and achievement rather than seniority. :i) The enlargement and diversification of professional training through the establishment of new professional schools. :j) An understanding of university life as a truly communitarian experience, therefore encouraging the development of a population of full-time professors and full time students. Conflict The conflict started with a lateral problem, the cancellation of the patients beds at the Hospital de Cl√≠nicas university hospital in late 1917. On March 31, 1918, when classes should have been restarted, the students organised another strike, with demonstrations, that finally forced the national government to intervene the university. Jos√© Matienzo was named intervenor of the university, and he confirmed most of the irregularities described by the students. He declared vacant the positions of Rector of the university and Deans of the faculties, and commanded the democratisation of the university's statutes. But the students were not to be part of this process, since the conservative Antonio Nores was voted Rector of the University, against the wishes of the students. The students occupied the faculties' premises, so classes could not be restarted regularly. They resisted the police and were finally driven out by force by the national army. This produced a general uneasiness of the public throughout the country, which forced President Yrigoyen to appoint his Minister of Justice and Public Education, Jos√© S. Salinas, as a new intervenor of the university. The decree of the university reform was redacted on October 12, 1918. Repercussions The objectives of the 1918 Cordoba Reform were promptly adopted by many student organizations, and one by one, from Argentina to Mexico, Latin American universities experienced unprecedented uprisings. The same year the reform statutes were enacted into law at C√≥rdoba, they were extended to the University of Buenos Aires and later to other Argentinean universities. Its principles were included in the 1920 manifesto of the Argentine University Federation, and subsequently endorsed by the International Student Congress on University Reform held in Mexico City in 1921, with the participation of delegates from Latin America, United States, Europe, and Asia. In 1924, when Haya de la Torre, leader of the university reform in Peru, founded the Popular Revolutionary American Alliance, the original student demands evolved into a vigorous and ambitious political, social, and economic movement. The Cordoba Reform had a tremendous impact in most Latin American universities, and would even inspire the leaders of the 1960s student movement in industrialized countries. The success of the students' demands in C√≥rdoba soon spread to other important universities such as the University of Buenos Aires, the National University of La Plata, the National University of Tucum√°n and the National University of the Littoral, from which it extended to other Latin American countries: first to Peru, then Chile and Cuba, Colombia, Guatemala and Uruguay. In the 1930s, a second Latin American wave of university reforms shook Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Mexico. The repercussion went further even eliciting the autonomy of the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico granted in the 1920s into the National Autonomous University of Mexico that exist up to day.Elizalde, Guadalupe, Piedras en el Camino de la UNAM, EDAMEX, 1999 p.49. Likewise M√©xico, but in 1921, the Peruvian Royal and Pontifical University of San Marcos granted the autonomy of the nowadays National University of San Marcos the oldest university in the Americas. Since University Reform, student organisations have maintained close links with workers' organizations and labor unions, frequently joining them in demonstrations and protests. Another consequence has been the politicizing of the student centers for the elections inside the universities, with which they are usually connected, identified with, and supported by national political parties.

She was born in Attenborough, Nottinghamshire, England.http://records.ancestry.com/bridget_ireton_records.ashx?pid=44332556 She married Thomas Bendish in 1670.. (Also DNB, vol iv, p. 212)Her husband Thomas Bendish (1643‚Äì1707) was a son of Sir Thomas Bendish, 2nd Baronet (Anderson p. 383) Bridget died early in 1726 at age 76 and was buried in Great Yarmouth. Life Bridget's mother (pictured) died in 1662, and, because her father had died in 1651, Bridget lived with her stepfather, Charles Fleetwood, until age 19. In 1652, her mother, also named Bridget Ireton (born July 1624), married General Charles Fleetwood after being widowed by the death of Henry Ireton. In 1662, her mother died; and Bridget lived with her stepfather at Stoke Newington, Middlesex, until she was 19. On 24 August 1669 a license was granted for her to marry Thomas Bendish (bap. 1645, d. 1707) of Gray's Inn; in 1670 they married. They moved to Southtown, near Great Yarmouth, where Bendisb owned salt marshes and a saltworks on Cobholme. In 1672, he was charged with landing coal from the vessel of a non-burgess on the west side of the haven without permission. Bridget Bendish always took a lively interest in politics, and is said to have compromised herself, along with her husband, in many ways in the Rye House Plot of 1683. Her views may well have been sympathetic to the Whig exclusionists. In May 1685 she aided her brother, Henry Ireton, in his escape from prison on suspicion of complicity. Following his recapture and imprisonment, she was allowed access to him in Newgate in November and December 1685. In 1688-1689 she secretly distributed papers recommending the recognition of William III. In 1689 the clergyman Rowland Davies visited Bendish's house \\"and saw all his contrivance to make salt.\\" Archbishop Tillotson introduced Bridget to Queen Mary in 1694, and a pension was promised her, but it was never granted, owing to the death of both her patrons immediately after the interview. On 27 April 1707, her husband Thomas Bendish died, leaving her in charge of their business. Mrs. Bendish was always careless about money matters, and although she received a large bequest from her aunt, Lady Fauconberg, she had to depend for her livelihood in her old age on her own exertions. Family Two of their sons and a daughter reached adulthood: Thomas, who died in the West Indies; Bridget, who died at Yarmouth, unmarried, in 1736, aged 64; and Henry, who died in London in 1740, having married Martha Shute, the sister of John Barrington, 1st Viscount Barrington. Assessment She was always determined to defend her family heritage. In 1719, a local dissenting minister, Samuel Say, wrote in \\"The character of Mrs B[ridget] B[endish] granddaughter of Oliver Cromwell\\" on occasion of the closing words of Lord Clarendon's character of her grandfather that he was \\"a brave wicked man.\\" This work, which was not published until after her death, portrayed her as a rigid Calvinist of uncertain temper, with a strength of will and physical courage rarely paralleled. According to Say, she labored incessantly in her own household, on her husband's farm, and at his saltworks, yet was always noted for dignity of mien and the charm of her conversation. She was reputed to bear a physical resemblance to her grandfather, of whose reputation she was an ardent champion. Samuel Say recorded an incident when Bridget was traveling to London in a public coach when a fellow passenger, in conversation with a companion, spoke lightly of Oliver Cromwell. Bridget not only inveighed against the offender for the rest of the journey, but on landing in London snatched another passenger's sword from its sheath and challenged the slanderer to fight her there and then.

They were reunited with their father in Genoa five years later.Ale, Ana. La Dinast√≠a. Editorial Planeta, 2001. Arrival in Argentina The birth of the Italian Republic prompted Giorgio Macri to enter politics, by which he co-founded a nationalist party, the Common Man's Front, ahead of the general elections in June 1946; following the party's poor showing, however, he departed for Buenos Aires, settling in the western suburb of San Justo. He immigrated with two of his seven siblings- Antonio (the father of Jorge Macri) and Maria Pia (who married Antonio Calcaterra). He later obtained housing in the Eva Per√≥n Foundation's Ciudad Evita community, and was joined by his three children in January 1949. Franco Macri found work in as a construction laborer; he was promoted quickly and held an administrative post within a year, later earning his secondary school diploma at the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires and, in 1950, establishing a construction firm, Urbana. Obtaining a number of small, public contracts, Urbana ultimately failed, and Macri entered into a partnership, Vimac, in 1953. The firm was boosted by a lucrative contract from Loma Negra, the leading Argentine cement producer, for the construction of a new plant near Tandil in 1955. He married Alicia Blanco Villegas, the daughter of a prominent Tandil physician, in 1958, relocated to Mar del Plata, and had the first of their four children, Mauricio, in 1959. Leading contractor Macri started a home builder, Demaco, and purchased a tiny Buenos Aires apartment facing Vicente L√≥pez Plaza (in the heart of the upscale Recoleta district). The 1962 installation of ultraconservative Economy Minister Alvaro Alsogaray, however, and the latter's policy of paying state contractors and employees with worthless \\"Ninth of July Bonds\\" led to Vimac's closure. Joined by two investors and aided by an economic recovery, in 1964 he fused Demaco with the remains of Vimac to establish Impresit-Sideco. The firm secured a coveted contract with Italian automaker Fiat, for the construction and maintenance of their Caseros factory, and quickly became a leading public works contractor, notably in the construction of the General Belgrano Bridge, the Atucha I and Embalse nuclear power plants (Latin America's first), as well as in private works, such as an AGIP gas pipeline and the Catalinas Norte office park.Fundaci√≥n Konex: Francesco Macri; accessed 11 March 2019. Inheriting his father's interest in film (the elder Macri had worked for the iconic Cinecitt√† Studios), he also established MBC, which produced cinema for local directors Leopoldo Torre Nilsson and Alejandro Doria, among others. Having completed over 30 major public works projects worth over US$1.8 billion since 1964, Macri acquired Philco and NEC's Argentine affiliates and gained controlling interest in Impresit and established Socma, a holding company for his various interests, in 1976. The installation of the last dictatorship that year, and their appointment of Buenos Aires Mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore led to the closure of the city's tens of thousands of apartment building incinerators, whose noxious disposal of the city's 3,000 daily tons of refuse had been worsening air quality for decades. Cacciatore had them replaced in 1979 with curbside pickup service awarded to Manliba, a consortium between Impresit-Sideco and Waste Management, Inc.Clar√≠n (29 August 2009) Macri's marriage ended in separation in 1980 (no provision existed in Argentina for divorce until 1987), and in 1982 he married Cristina Cressier, with whom he had his sixth child, Florencia. The collapse of the Argentine auto industry in 1981‚Äì82 allowed Macri to purchase a controlling stake in Sevel Argentina S.A., a local joint venture between Fiat and Peugeot formed in 1980. The acquisition averted the closure of the European automakers' Argentine plants, and tripled Socma's income. Macri's finances were undermined, however, from losses stemming from the Banco de Italia y R√≠o de la Plata, of which he was majority shareholder between 1975 and 1980. The subsequent crisis, which resulted from the implosion of Economy Minister Jos√© Alfredo Mart√≠nez de Hoz's financial deregulation and strong peso policies, also prompted Macri to take advantage of an exchange rate guarantee enacted by the Central Bank in 1980 for large private borrowers facing sharply higher U.S. dollar payments, a benefit granted to Sevel. Ventures and misadventures Macri entered into a valuable real estate venture in New York, when in 1979, developer Abraham Hirschfeld sold him a 75% stake in 30 hectares (75 acres) of Hudson Riverfront land formerly owned by Penn Central. Planning to develop \\"Lincoln West,\\" a residential complex, Macri invested US$100 million in mandated public works and related expenses, but could not, ultimately, service a Chase Manhattan loan or meet the city's myriad zoning demands, selling the land to Donald Trump in 1985 for US$117 million. The aforementioned disappointment was compounded by a heart attack in 1983, and the end of his second marriage in 1986, by which he lost custody of Florencia. He suffered serious losses during the country's repeated currency crises between 1987‚Äì90, but gained from a partnership with BellSouth and Motorola to form Movicom, the first large-scale Argentine mobile phone service provider. A supporter of La Rioja Province Governor Carlos Menem ahead of his upset victory in the 1988 Justicialist Party primaries, Macri broke from the flamboyant president when, after his 1989 election (which he won on a populist platform), he pursued aggressive free trade policies that undermined Sevel (by then the largest automaker in Argentina) in favor of cheaper imports. Carlos Grosso, Menem's appointed Mayor of Buenos Aires (a presidential prerogative until 1996), was a managerial employee of Macri's. A vocal Peronist, Grosso had reportedly been spared becoming one of the \\"disappeared\\" upon his 1978 military abduction only by Macri's appeal on his behalf to Internal Affairs Minister Albano Harguindeguy and Apostolic Nuncio Pio Laghi.P√°gina/12 (27 April 2008) The family was shaken by the August 23, 1991, kidnapping of Mauricio Macri, Franco Macri's eldest son. Freed after two weeks in captivity for a reported ransom of US$6 million, Macri's abduction was executed by four members of the Polic√≠a Federal Argentina, which has policing purview over Buenos Aires (the perpetrators were located only a decade later). Sevel, the Socma Group's centerpiece at the time, initially benefitted from the boom touched off by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo's Convertibility Plan in 1991, seeing its auto sales grow from 30,000 in 1990 to 200,000 in 1994. The local auto industry was hit hard, however, by the Mexican peso crisis. A fall in sales to 130,000 led the company to divest itself of the Fiat licence in 1996, and Sevel revenues fell by nearly half, to US$1.1 billion. During the Menem-era wholesale privatization drive, Macri was outmaneuvered in a 1997 bid for the management of the nation's 33 main airports by Eduardo Eurnekian, although Socma was sold the national postal service in July 1997. Sevel was eventually liquidated, rescinding its Peugeot licence in March 2000, well into the Argentine economic crisis, and the Socma Group's global revenues fell from US$4.5 billion in 1994 to US$2 billion in 2001. Following Sevel's liquidation, Macri was convicted of customs duty evasion relating to an auto export-import scheme via neighboring Uruguay.La Naci√≥n (24 October 2000) Legacy Macri, a fan of the Boca Juniors football club since the 1950s, had a commercial relationship with it for almost as long, dating from his 1960 partnership in a small insurance firm with the club's president at the time, Alberto Armando. He leveraged this to promote his elder son, Mauricio, as president of the club in 1992, though he was defeated by the incumbent, Antonio Alegre (credited with saving the club from insolvency in the 1980s).Ol√© (3 January 2008) Macri was elected in 1995, however, and caused controversy by earmarking a multi-million dollar renovation of the Bombonera stadium, and granting the contract to Impresit (Macri's construction firm).La Botella del Mar (8 November 2005) Florencia, Macri's youngest daughter, was kidnapped on April 30, 2003, and freed a week later after a ransom of nearly a million dollars was reportedly paid.Am√©rica Economica (6 May 2003) The federal postal service contract with Socma, through Correos Argentinos, was rescinded, citing the company's debt to taxpayers of US$296 million.La Naci√≥n (21 November 2003) Pago F√°cil, the electronic funds transfer service operated by Socma, became one of the group's leading firms, processing over 7 million payments a month. Among the group's most significant real estate developments after 2004 was the Mulieris towers, in Buenos Aires' Puerto Madero district.Franco Macri: presente, francomacri.com; accessed 11 March 2019. Macri returned to the auto industry in 2007, when he obtained licensing to produce Chery automobiles, as well as their parts, which would be assembled in Uruguay.iEco (4 December 2007) His son, Mauricio, was elected Mayor of Buenos Aires in 2007, and in 2008, the 78-year-old Macri divested Socma of two of its most important firms, Iecsa (construction) and Creaurban (real estate), in favor of Angelo Calcaterra, his nephew. Chery Socma, the joint venture with the Chinese automaker, exported its first units in September 2009. Macri published a reflection on his over half-century as an Argentine businessman, El futuro es posible, in 2004. From 1949 when he arrived in Argentina Macri kept the suitcase with which he came. Panama Papers scandal In April 2016, following the leak to German newspaper S√ºddeutsche Zeitung of 11 million documents belonging to Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, the leaked Panama Papers revealed that Mauricio Macri was listed as director of a Bahamas-based trading company that he did not disclose during his tenure as Mayor of Buenos Aires. Shortly after the Panama Papers made the news, Mauricio appeared in a short television interview in which he said his father, Franco Macri, had founded the company through a \\"legal operation\\". He added that the company had been intended to carry out investment operations in Brazil but the business was never completed. Journalist Joaqu√≠n Morales Sol√° considered it unlikely that Mauricio would be prosecuted for the Panama revelations. Mauricio appears himself in the directory, Franco Macri had reported it to the AFIP, and it was closed in 2008, just a year after Mauricio Macri became chief of government. On 7 April 2016, federal prosecutor Federico Delgado began a formal investigation into Macri's involvement with Fleg Trading Ltd., the company registered in Panama for which President Macri was listed as director. Judge Sebasti√°n Casanello was asked to start the file on the inquiry. The initial petition was made by Norman Mart√≠nez, deputy for the Front for Victory. Mart√≠nez claimed Macri could be guilty of perjury due to omissions made in his sworn statement. Mart√≠nez also referenced another offshore company, Kagemusha SA, which had been established in 1981 and to which President Macri also had connections. Death Macri died on March 2, 2019, in his house in Barrio Parque. Most Argentine politicians sent their condolences to Mauricio Macri, including (despite their rivalry) former president Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner. He also received messages from other South American presidents, such as Brazilian Jair Bolsonaro, Bolivian Evo Morales, Paraguayan Mario Abdo Ben√≠tez, Peruvian Mart√≠n Vizcarra and the U.S. ambassador Edward Prado. He was buried at the cemetery Jard√≠n de Paz in Pilar. The Macri family arrived from San Mart√≠n de los Andes following a private funeral.

It replaced the 1908 Pattern and 1925 Pattern‚Äîon which it was based‚Äîand was standard issue for British and Commonwealth troops from its introduction in 1937, throughout World War II, and in the post-war period until it was superseded by 58 pattern webbing. Development At the end of the First World War, huge stocks of 1908 Pattern equipment remained, and the difficult financial climate meant that these remained in service with the British Army in the post-war period.Bull 2016, p. 114 In 1932, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff established the Brathwaite Committee to look into the uniform and equipment of the infantry and to make recommendations for their improvement.Crew 1955, p. 84 The increasingly complex nature of combat and different roles that soldiers and members of the other services were being required to undertake, meant that the new design needed to be flexible, thus it was decided that it would consist of interchangeable components, which could be modified to suit the individual needs of a soldier based on his role.Brayley & Chappell 2002, p. 38 In 1932, the Mills Equipment Company, the prime manufacturer of the 1908 equipment, offered the Brathwaite Committee four new designs to consider. Although the committee decided on one of the designs in 1934, the ongoing trials to find a successor to the Lewis gun that resulted in the Bren gun,Bull 2016, p. 114 and also abortive trials of automatic rifles including the Pedersen rifle, meant that new webbing could not be adopted until decisions had been reached on future weaponry. The design was confirmed on 8 June 1938 and wide-scale issue began in 1939. Towards the end of World War II, some 37 Webbing was produced in jungle green for troops fighting in the Pacific Theatre, although purpose-made 44 Pattern Webbing was then introduced for the humid jungle conditions, being lighter in weight, quicker drying and rot-proofed.Brayley & Chappell 2002, p. 37. Although 44 Pattern continued in use with the British Army for jungle warfare in its various post-World War II colonial conflicts, it did not replace 37 Pattern in general service, which was in front-line use up until the introduction of 58 Pattern. However, 37 Pattern was used for second line and support troops and was included in the army's Catalogue of Ordnance Stores and Ammunition (C.O.S.A.) in 1985, but had finally disappeared by the time of the 1991 edition. Description Two soldiers demonstrate 1937 Pattern Webbing, March 1944 1937 Pattern Webbing was made from cotton webbing, which was waterproofed and dyed before being woven. The fittings were made of stamped brass‚Äîblackened steel post war‚Äîand it was produced by various manufacturers. It was produced in a khaki colour for the Army, which could then be dyed with Blanco, most often to pea green (a light-green shade) and blue-grey for the Royal Air Force. Military Police had white webbing.Brayley & Chappell 2001, p. 44. Standard components included a belt (issued in sizes Normal and Large), cross straps (called 'braces'), cartridge pouches for .303 ammunition (which gave way to 'universal' pouches to carry ammunition for an array of infantry weapons then in use by the British Army, in addition to grenades), a carrier for the waterbottle and a small pack.Brayley & Chappell 2001, p. 39. The large (1908) pack‚Äîintended to be carried in regimental transport except when in full marching order‚Äîand entrenching tool carrier were retained from World War I issue, although the later was initially issued in modified form before being reintroduced in 1941.Brayley & Chappell 2001, pp. 38‚Äì39. Frogs for the 1907 SMLE and No.4 Rifle bayonets were also issued. Different combinations of these components comprised the 'marching order' and the 'battle order' respectively. In addition various items were issued to be used by officers and often armoured crewmen, such as pouches for binoculars, pistol ammunition and compass (externally the same as that for pistol ammunition but with felt padding inside), as well as a 'valise' side pack and holster for the .38 revolver (a tank crew version with leg strap also existed in two versions).Brayley & Chappell 2001, p. 34. The theoretical weight of the fully loaded equipment was for an infantryman in full marching order, including a rifle but not helmet of gas cape, and for an officer.Bull 2016, p. 116 A number of items were issued which conformed to 37 Pattern in their fittings and materials but were not strictly part of the set, such as a bandolier for Sten magazines as issued to airborne troops and the spare barrel bag and parts wallet for the Bren gun. Components British infantry on exercise in England, 1941 Basic Components *Haversack, All Ranks: A rectangular bag that attached to the brace ends on the left hip. It was partitioned in the middle and the rear partition was split in two, with the two Mess Tins stored in one side and the Mark VII Water Bottle and its webbing harness stored in the other side. It was worn on the back when the large pack was not worn. In this case, the poncho was folded so as to cushion the back and was visible under the flap. *Binoculars Case: A box that carried the Binoculars Pouch and binoculars. The back of the case attached to the web belt with two long oval metal hooks. The same case could also be used for carrying the iron sight for the tripod-mounted BREN gun; it came in a fitted wooden box to cushion and protect it. *Compass Pouch: A square pouch that was the same size and shape as the pistol ammunition pouch except it was felt-lined to cushion the compass. It sat above the Binoculars Case attached to the right-side shoulder strap. Holsters *Pistol Case: A cross-draw belt holster worn on the left hip that was designed to carry the Enfield No 2 Revolver. *Pistol Case, Royal Tank Corps (1916‚Äì1939) / Royal Armoured Corps (1939‚ÄìPresent): A straight-draw thigh holster worn on the right thigh that was used by Tank commanders to carry the Enfield No 2 Revolver. It had a long strap that allowed it to extend to the upper leg and a tie-down strap on the holster to secure it. It had six cartridge loops on the side of the holster to hold spare ammunition and a cleaning rod pocket along the front edge. There are pictures showing Commandos wearing a cross-draw shoulder holster worn under the left armpit made from a converted version of this rig. Ammunition carriers The system could be used to flexibly mix and match components, but regulations usually had soldiers wear set combinations. *Grenade Carrier: A horizontal rectangular case with two pouches. Each pouch could carry a No 36M Mills Bomb Fragmentation Grenade. The back of the carrier slid on the web belt with two long oval metal hooks. It was designed to be worn on the side of the belt on the hip rather than the front and therefore has no shoulder strap link. *Basic Pouch: A large vertical rectangular pouch that went through three versions (Marks I, II, and III). It could carry either (2) BREN magazines, (6) 20-round Thompson SMG magazines, (4) No 36M Fragmentation, No 69 Offensive, or No.77 White Phosphorus grenades, (4) No 36M cup-discharger rifle grenades with attached gas-check baseplates, (2) Smoke Grenades, or boxes of Small Arms Ammunition. The Mark I version had three cartridge loops sewn into the inner lid for carrying three ballistite Rifle Grenade Blanks for launching rifle grenades; this feature was later omitted on the Mark II pouch. The longer Basic Pouch Mark III could hold (5) 32-round STEN Machine Carbine Magazines. *Pistol Ammunition Pouch: A small pouch that carried a rectangular box of (12) rounds of .38/200 ammunition for the Enfield No 2 Revolver. It could be secured between the Pistol Case and the left brace. *Cartridge Carrier: A horizontal rectangular case with two square pouches that carried a total of 20 rounds (4 √ó 5-round clips). It was designed for use by non-infantry soldiers who carried a rifle. Each pouch contained (2) 5-round chargers that were separated by a cloth divider. The pouch had two snaps: the bottom snap was used if only one clip was carried and the top snap was used if both clips were carried. The back of the carrier attached to the web belt with two long oval metal hooks and the top had a strap that linked into the shoulder strap. *Lanchester Magazine Pouch: This long rectangular pouch carried (3) 50-round magazines for the Lanchester Machine Carbine that was used by the Royal Marines, Royal Navy and RAF. The back of the carrier slid on the web belt with two long oval metal hooks and the top had a short strap that linked into the shoulder strap. It was so high that it went almost up to the wearer's chin. *Vickers G.O. Gun Magazine Pouch, Alternate: This was an oval pouch designed to hold a drum for the Vickers K machine gun. It could hold a 100-round drum. The back of the carrier slid on the web belt with two long oval metal hooks and the top had a strap that linked into the shoulder strap. Accessories *Bandolier: A rectangular piece of cloth with 5 pockets and a shoulder strap. Each pocket carried (2) 5-round Mauser-style stripper clips for a total of 50 rounds. It went through 3 marks and 4 versions during the war (Marks I, II, III, and III/1). *Utility Pouch: A pair of large vertical rectangular pouches with a built-in cloth yoke and a narrow strap for securing across the chest. It was a bigger version of the Basic Pouch. The yoke could be worn over the neck and the pouches across the chest or worn over the shoulder with the pouches across one side. Each pouch could carry either (3) BREN gun magazines, (2) Boys Anti-Tank Rifle magazines, (3) 2-inch O.S.B. mortar shells, a Mark VII water bottle, several grenades, or boxes of Small Arms Ammunition.

The system comprises an eclipsing white dwarf and red dwarf. The two stars orbit each other every 0.13 days. Planetary system A planetary system has been inferred to exist around NN Ser by several teams. All of these teams rely on the fact that Earth sits in the same plane as the NN Serpentis binary star system, so humans can see the larger red dwarf eclipse the white dwarf every 0.13 days. Astronomers are then able to use these frequent eclipses to spot a pattern of small but significant irregularities in the orbit of stars, which could be attributed to the presence and gravitational influence of circumbinary planets. Chen (2009) used these \\"eclipse timing variations\\" to suggesting a putative orbital period spanning between 30 and 285 years and a minimum mass between 0.0043 and 0.18 Solar masses. In late 2009, Qian estimated a minimum mass of 10.7 Jupiter masses and orbital period of 7.56 years for this planet, probably located at 3.29 Astronomical Units. This has since been disproven by further measurements of the eclipse times of the binary stars.

Brooke Papers at National Archives ref 5735 The estate passed to Sir John Charlton early in the 14th century and by the marriage of a Charlton heiress to Richard Moreton in the early 16th century. The Moreton heiress Anne married Humphrey Brigges of Ernestry in 1587 and the Briggs Baronets occupied the estate until the death of the 5th and last Baronet in 1767. The present house was built in 1718 by Sir Humphrey Briggs, 4th Baronet, MP for Wenlock, originally in red brick, with two storeys and attics and a seven bay frontage. After 1767 the estate was divided between among daughters and the Hall passed to George Townsend Brooke, son of Elizabeth Briggs. He improved and enlarged the house between 1820‚Äì30; the external walls were stuccoed and two two-storey flanking wings were added. Following the death of Major William John Brooke (born 1875), of the King's Shropshire Light Infantry (he was killed during the Battle of Estaires on 9 April 1918 whilst attached to the Middlesex Regiment)https://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/874966/brooke,-william- john/, the property passed to a nephew and was thereafter let out for various uses, including briefly a school.

Thulas are metrical name-lists or listsOn the anthropological significance of making lists see now Eco, Umberto. 2009. The Infinity of Lists (orig. Vertige de la liste). New York: Rizzoli. of poetic synonyms compiled, mainly, for oral recitation. The main function of thulas is thought to be mnemonic. The Old Norse term was first applied to an English poem, the Old English Widsith, by Andreas Heusler and Wilhelm Ranisch in 1903.Baugh, Albert C. ¬≤1967. A Literary History of England. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul. Vol. 1. p. 32, n. 1. Thulas occur as parts of longer poems, too; Old Norse examples are found in various passages of the poetic and the prose Edda (esp. Sk√°ldskaparm√°l with the Nafna√æulur, Gr√≠mnism√°l, Alv√≠ssm√°l), the R√≠gs√æula as well as in the V√∂lusp√°. Thulas can be considered as sources of once canonic knowledge, rooted in prehistoric beliefs and rituals. They generally preserve mythological and cosmogonical knowledge, often proper names and toponyms, but also the names of semi-legendary or historical persons. Their language is usually highly formalized, and they make extensive use of mnemonic devices such as alliteration. For a number of archaic words and formulas some thulas are the only available source. The term and the genre may go back to the function of the Thyle (), who held the function of an orator and was responsible for the cultus.  Examples  The different versions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle start off with the names of the English rulers back to Woden in metrical form: \\"Cynric [w√¶s] Cerdicing, Cerdic Elesing, Elesa Esling, Esla Gewising, Gewis Wiging, Wig Freawining, Freawine Fri√∞ugaring, Fri√∞ugar Bronding, Brond B√¶d√¶ging, B√¶ld√¶g Wodening.\\" (after The Parker Chronicle, ed. Plummer 1892-99) The longest Old English thulas, though, are part of the poem Widsith, listing, in the first thula, 30 kings, 54 tribes in the second, and 28 men in the third and last thula.  Outside early medieval literature  Lists of names and objects abound in texts other than early Germanic ones, too. In classic Greek and Latin poetry, lists, or catalogues, function as forms of amplificatio (see amplification) and enumeratio. Ovid includes a catalogue of trees in his Metamorphoses (10.90-108).For more examples cf. Ernst Robert Curtius. 1953, repr. 1973. European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages. Trans. Willard R. Trask. Bollingen Series 36. Princeton: Princeton UP. esp. 194-95 Lists in works by later medieval authors follow the classic models rather than the thulas, even though the poetic effect may be similar. A good example is found in Chaucer's Parlement of Foules, which, among other things, features a list of trees: :The bilder ook, and eek the hardy asshe; :The piler elm, the cofre unto careyne; :The boxtree piper; holm to whippes lasshe; :The sayling firr; the cipres, deth to pleyne; :The sheter ew, the asp for shaftes pleyne; :The olyve of pees, and eek the drunken vyne, :The victor palm, the laurer to devyne.(176-80) The text is based on The Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer. Ed. W.W. Skeat. Oxford, 1900. The \\"Wood of Error\\" in Edmund Spenser's in The Faerie Queene (I.i.8-9) is a similar catalogue of trees, based on that of Ovid. Among modern authors, James Joyce, for instance, includes numerous lists in his Ulysses and Finnegans Wake, e.g. a list of the books in Leopold Bloom's library. (Ulysses 17.1357ff.)See also Leopold Ettlinger's \\"Lists in Finnegans Wake and in Ulysses: A Note on Joyce and Vico\\"  References   External links  * Baugh, Albert C. ¬≤1967.

Schell starts by discussing the cultural embeddedness of men, patriotism and death in battle (going back to the Athenian - Pericles). From this classic root political morality has held onto the need for 'standing up for principles with force', which in practice quickly descends to \\"plunder, exploitation and massacre\\". In the 5th century, St. Augustine conjoined this with Christian love... by theorising 'separate realms' for political and religious morality. Politics has thus long been wedded to violence... it is hard to conceptualise a political ideology that does not have a resort to violence clause. As Schell says there has been, \\"an age old reliance of politics on violent means\\". (p. 4) Schell then puts forward his main thesis that \\"violence has now become dysfunctional as a political instrument\\" (p. 7) and that \\"forms of non-violent action can serve effectively in the place of violence at every level of political affairs\\". (p. 8) The key political progress has been the idea of democracy - even the worst democracy - carries within it the principle of equality which is a deeply seated contradiction to an also deeply embedded practice of inequality - see Tocqueville. Ironically modern national democracy allowed for a new kind of army, in which it was possible to mobilise masses of men prepared to die - apparently in defence of their own national interest and the principle of democracy. The disaster of the modern war system was fed by an unholy confluence of democracy, science, industrial revolution, and imperialism which developed through the 19th century. Power Power came to be widely defined by the ability to wage war. He describes imperialism as \\"a monotonous record of one sided slaughter\\" (p. 75) He argues that there was an end of limited war between 'great powers' after 1870 (p. 44). After that we had 1914 and the period of total or world war until 1946. Then the period of Cold War in which the public appearances of a strategic balance of power became more important than the reality of a balance of actual power. The A-bomb made a balance of actual power obsolete (p. 62). People's war - wars of national self-determination The first modern people's war was the Spanish resistance to the French invasion 1807-14 (p. 68). A people's war that showed how a superior force can be worn down by lesser military strength contrary to the classic rules of conventional warfare. The main need was to endure, and an armed population. George Washington also understood this need to endure. \\"Washington was always aware that his most important task was to insure the survival of his own forces - not strictly for military purposes but to personify the unconquerable will of the American people\\" (p. 157). The big downside of people's war is that the whole people then become subject to retaliation (p. 81). In the Japanese retaliation against the Chinese communists, the population dropped from 45 million to 25 million. With this level of violence, political ideals are what buoys the resistance up. It also allowed humanitarian treatment of prisoners by the communist forces to be maintained. In a people's war it is important that war is kept subordinate to politics. This is the first stage of extracting politics from the war machine. Politics here means the creation of a civil administration from the ground up. For Mao the most important goal and foundation of this politics was the redistribution of land from rich to poor. A militarised politics can easily segue into a totalitarian politics as it did in China via conventional warfare against the American-backed Kuomintang. People's war became the principal instrument of self-determination and social change in the third world from around the 1950s. If a population is united, an imperial war against it is difficult to win. Charles de Gaulle understood this in relation to Algeria in 1958. Even when he had achieved a military victory it did not lead to a political one. Cold war The nuclear standoff produced a stalemate in the war system. The last resort was unusable. '\\"In both (nuclear deterrence and people war) violence became not so much an instrument for producing physical effects as a kind of bloody system of communication, through which the antagonists produced messages to one another about will.\\" (p. 97) Nuclear deterrence became a conflict waged by appearances to produce intangible effects on leaderships and populations. People's war also came to be decided by intangible effects on hearts and minds of both sides. In both situations the capacity of violence for achieving political ends is thrown into doubt. Revolution A similar mindset of belief in violence pervaded western theories of revolution. Right, left and centre theorists and leaders agreed that that revolution had to be violent. Power was only understood as an effect of violent coercive rule. (except for a few voices, e.g., Tolstoy) Two expressly political theorists thought consistently about nonviolence: Mahatma Gandhi and Hannah Arendt. Mohandas K. Gandhi Mohandas K. Gandhi believed that courage was a more important attribute of those seeking liberation than a desire for nonviolence or Satyagraha. At one point he even acted as conscription agent for the British military in South Africa. (date?) Gandhi appealed to the 'spiritual' strength of Indian peoples to oppose the Western Imperial (war) system. The assumption here is that tyrants and ruling classes alike only have the power that we invest in them. Give them nothing and they are naked and have no power. \\"The central role of consent in all government meant that non-cooperation - the withdrawal of consent - was something more than a morally satisfying activity; it was a powerful weapon in the real world.\\" (p. 129) \\"Non-cooperation is not a passive state, it is an intensely active state - more active than physical resistance or violence.\\"' (p. 130) Schell quoting from Gandhi's Essential Writings (p. 99) The Gandhi programme of Satyagraha (\\"the quiet and irresistible pursuit of truth\\") was accompanied by 'the constructive programme'. This campaigned and organised to achieve concrete goals such as justice for workers, peace between factions, village hygiene and diet, the condition of women, etc. The idea is to do anything that obstructed the solidarity of the nation and that facilitates the production of a democratic political culture. \\"Constructive effort is political power\\" Gandhi's Essential Writings (p. 259) Revolutions and violence Schell looks for the nonviolent actions that are part of what are often represented as broadly violent revolutions. (p. 143) He defines violence: \\"Violence is the method by which the ruthless few can subdue the passive many. Non-violence is a means by which the active many can overcome the ruthless few.\\" (p. 144). He discusses The Glorious Revolution of 1689 in England and the American, French and Russian Revolutions. He makes the interesting observation that revolutions are typified as violent and the subsequent establishment of a new regime is assumed to be peaceful, whereas the reverse has \\"more often been the case\\". (p. 144) in the French revolution, the American, even the Russian...(p. 175) (p. 178). More people died making Potemkin the film than in the actual storming of the Winter Palace! The Russian Revolution was more of a victory of a 'mass minority' ... than a real people's revolution as happened in France or America (p. 183). The English 'Glorious Revolution' of 1689 \\"London was in fact the first of many modern capitals whose rebellious spirit was to infect and destroy the allegiance of an army of an ancien regime\\". This was William of Orange versus King James, with defections at the non-battle at Salisbury. There has been a near universal failure of theorists to predict the non- violent fall of powers. He quotes Thomas Paine: \\"Tis not in numbers but in unity that our great strength lies\\". In the American Revolution Committees of Correspondence were formed for \\"mutually fostering and co-ordinating activity\\". These were the basic political units. Edmund Burke realised that it is only by cultivating the love and admiration of the people that a ruler can raise taxes or an army or get voted in. This love \\"infuses into (army and navy) that liberal obedience without which your army would be base rabble and you navy nothing but rotten timber\\" (p. 159). East Europe Schell's sources here are Adam Michnik, V√°clav Havel and Gy√∂rgy Konr√°d as sources to explain the 'unsuspected' weakness of the Soviet empire. In their beginnings they \\"did not aim at state power\\" (p. 191) but aimed at \\"achieving immediate changes in daily life\\" within what was called 'civil society' a term that goes back to Paine. (p. 194) The setting up of institutions independent from the state or the ruling classes... is the key activity in preparing for a peoples revolution. In Eastern Europe this took the form of civic and cultural activity (p. 195), e.g., Workers' Defence Committee provided concrete assistance to those in trouble with the authorities, and their families. Other terms for similar activity: * flying university * parallel structures * second culture * revolutionary councils' (Arendt) V√°clav Havel suggested there should be no discourse with the centre of power but that activists should \\"fight only for those concrete causes, and fight for them unswervingly to the end\\" (p. 196). Compare this with Gandhi's earlier call for courage . Chosen well these independent institutions will rattle the establishment. The idea of cultivating 'a predisposition to truth' (Havel/ Gandhi) is seen as key (p. 197). The final collapse of the USSR is not like the rest of Eastern Europe as it was a mainly top down operation rather than one of peoples power. There was still a remarkable and unexpected lack of violence. The main thesis is reiterated: \\"The professionals of power, in or out of government, were consistently caught off-guard by the failures of superior force and the successes of nonviolence\\" (p. 216). Contemporary political theory could 'neither foresee nor explain' the successes of non-violent people power. Hannah Arendt's ideas of power Hannah Arendt's redefinition of the word 'power' On Violence, paperback edition, Hannah Arendt, 1970, has a strong echo from Paine. She says: \\"Power corresponds to the human ability not just to act but to act in concert.\\"On Violence, paperback edition, Hannah Arendt, 1970, , page 44 (Schell p. 218). She goes so far as to deny ascription of 'power' to individual action. Max Weber is probably more realistic in asserting that power is the assertion of will in a social relationship. (p. 220) But this does mean that in limiting its meaning Hannah Arendt can discuss political power in more detail. The assertion of the will of the tyrant is ultimately an illusion, the tyrant is dependent on his supporters. Violence can never create real political power in Arendt's sense: \\"To substitute violence for power can bring victory, but the price is very high; for it is not only paid by the vanquished, it is also paid by the victor in terms of his own power.\\" On Violence, paperback edition, Hannah Arendt, 1970, , page 53 (Schell p. 222). According to John Stuart Mill public opinion guides willRepresentative Government by John Stuart Mill and \\"a great part of all power consists in... willing allegiance\\" (Schell p. 229). Nonviolent change in liberal democracy? Schell sees the 'taming of violence' being written into liberalisms 'genetic code'. His example is the Civil Rights Movement in the USA. Although he sees nonviolent action being only 'curative' or reforming of a liberal democratic system.

He was born in Bastia, Corsica on January 17, 1862. , ...which a Corsican named Capazza, coming from the town of Bastia, has invented... He lived in Belgium from 1892-1898Homage page then emigrated to the United States in about 1920. He died on December 28, 1928 in Paris after contracting pneumonia in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Ballooning accomplishments Capazza's lenticular balloon airship design of 1908 His first balloon ascent was on November 14, 1886 above Bastia and Ajaccio on board his own balloon \\"Gabizos\\". His first balloon flight and para-descent was made in 1892 from Villette, France; he made more than 35 balloon ascents in his lifetime. He was also a pilot of the airship \\"Lebaudy\\" in France. He made many flights between 1891-92 in Britain and 1893-94 in France. He designed a lenticular-shaped balloon airship and was the inventor of a parachute in which he made two jumps. During a flight attempt in August 1892 at the Welsh Harp, England, the balloon slipped out of the net, and launched without him. The crowd turned into an angry mob, and tried to kill him. On a flight in 1892 he used a unique balloon which utilised a large parachute in place of the traditional net. He launched from the Villette Gas Works, the balloon was purposely ripped in flight, allowing him to descend safely. On November 14, 1899 he made the first balloon crossing of the Mediterranean Sea in \\"Gabizos\\" with a 21-year-old companion, Alphonse Fond√®re. He launched from Marseille at 04.30 and landed five and a half hours later in Appietto, Corsica. On a flight attempt on May 7, 1903 his balloon caught fire on inflation. On October 26, 1910 he piloted the Lebaudy Morning Post airship on its delivery flight form Moissons to Farnborough. Career He originally studied at college as a professional engineer and worked as a Traffic Superintendent for French Railways. In 1883, he entered the Service of the Geological Survey to study the problems relating to the installation of the railway network of Corsica. Noticed by Savorgnan de Brazza during its rise of 1886, Capazza became one of his best collaborators and was one of the founders of French Congo. He excelled in all his various endeavours - as a courageous explorer, administrator of territories, organiser of large business firms or banking, of mining railway companies and financial adviser in Morocco. He was successively named member of the Council of the French Bank of Africa, then Superior council of the colonies and moreover administrator of the company Radio-France. He played even a certain diplomatic part, especially in 1911, at the time of the Franco-German disagreement in Morocco; according to Mr. Fran√ßois Berger, then secretary of the Commission of the Senate he deployed in this business \\"of marvellous qualities.\\" He also suggested exchanging a territory of Means-Congo against the German rights to Morocco and was thus at the origin of the treaty which avoided the war. He was elected president of the Commission on Airships of the French Aero Club in 1913. Honours He received the Croix de Chevalier de son ordre, from King Leopold II of Belgium for research on balloon safety. In 1925, the Grand Prix town of Paris decreed upon him 'Officer of the Legion of Honour', vice-president of the French Association of aerial navigation. Commemorative plaques There are two plaques commemorating Capazza's achievement of his Mediterranean Sea crossing. In Corsica, a monument was inaugurated on October 28, 1928 with the collar of San Bastiano, in the presence of Mr. Landry, president of the General advice. In Marseilles, on the edge of the Saint-Michel plain, an inscription, due to the Botinelly sculptor and the architect Manor house, was dedicated to the glory of the two travellers by the care of the ministry for the Air, of the General advice of the Rhone delta, the Flying-club of France and the municipalities of Ajaccio, Bastia, Marseilles on November 16, 1930.

Additional variants were produced abroad totalling in 34,852 Bf 109s built. Bf 109 A/B/C/D Bf 109B-2 Bf 109C-1 The Bf 109A was the first version of the Bf 109. Armament was initially planned to be just two cowl-mounted 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns. However, possibly due to the introduction of the Hurricane and Spitfire, each with eight 7.7 mm (.303 in) machine guns, experiments were carried out with a third machine gun firing through the propeller shaft.Feist 1993, pp. 14‚Äì15. V4 and some A-0 were powered by a 640 PS (631 hp, 471 kW) Junkers Jumo 210B engine driving a two-blade fixed-pitch propeller, but production was changed to the 670 PS (661 hp, 493 kW) Jumo 210D as soon as it became available. The A-0 was not of a uniform type; there were several changes in their appearance. Visible changes included engine, cockpit and machine gun ventilation holes/slats, and the location of the oil cooler was changed several times to prevent overheating. Many of these Bf 109 A-0 served with the Legion Condor and were often misidentified as B-series aircraft, and probably served in Spain with the tactical markings 6-1 to 6‚Äì16. One A-0, marked as 6‚Äì15, ran out of fuel and was forced to land behind enemy lines. It was captured by Republican troops on 11 November 1937 and later transferred to the Soviet Union for a closer inspection.Bf 109 6-15 captured in spain 6‚Äì15 incorporated several improvements from the Bf 109B production program and had been prepared to use a variable-pitch propeller although it had not been installed. According to RLM documentation 22 aircraft were ordered and delivered with V4 as the A-series prototype.Ritger 2006, p. 12.RLM Flugzeugbeschaffungs-Programm Nr. 7a, 01.04.1938 (Deliveries up to 30.11.1937) The first Bf 109 in serial production, the Bf 109 B-1, was fitted with the 670 PS (661 hp, 493 kW) Jumo 210D engine driving a two-bladed fixed-pitch propeller. During the production run a variable-pitch propeller was introduced and often retrofitted to older aircraft; these were then unofficially known as B-2s. The Bf 109B saw combat with the Legion Condor during the Spanish Civil War, although it was apparent that the armament was still inadequate. Several aircraft were produced with an engine-mounted machine gun but it was very unreliable, most likely because of engine vibrations and overheating. Thus the Bf 109 V8 was constructed to test the fitting of two more machine guns in the wings; however, results showed that the wing needed strengthening.Feist 1993, p. 19. In the following V9 prototype, both wing guns were replaced by 20 mm MG FF cannons.Feist 1993, p. 20. A total of 341 Bf 109 B-1s were built by Messerschmitt, Fieseler, and the Erla Maschinenwerke.Ritger 2006, p. 170.RLM Flugzeugbeschaffungs-Programm Nr. 10 von 01.01.1939 (Deliveries up to 31.12.1938) Production of the short-lived Bf 109C began in the spring of 1938.Khazanov 2015, p. 15 The 109C was powered by a 700 PS (690 hp, 515 kW) Jumo 210G engine with direct fuel injection. Another important change was a strengthened wing, now carrying two more machine guns, giving four 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17s in total. The C-0s were pre-production aircraft, the C-1 was the production version, and the C-2 was an experimental version with an engine-mounted machine gun. The C-3 was planned with 20 mm MG FF cannons replacing the two MG 17s in the wings, but it is not known how many C-3s (if any) were built or converted. The C-4 was planned to have an engine-mounted Motorkanone MG FF, but this variant was not produced.Feist 1993, p. 151. A total of 58 Bf 109Cs of all versions were built by Messerschmitt. Messerschmitt Bf 109C-1, 6-47, 1.J/88 Legion Condor, Spain, Spring 1938 The next model, the V10 prototype, was identical to the V8, except for its Jumo 210G engine. The V10, V11, V12 and V13 prototypes were built using Bf 109B airframes, and tested the DB 600A engine with the hope of increasing the performance of the aircraft. The DB 600A was dropped as the improved DB601A with direct fuel injection was soon to become available. Developed from the V10 and V13 prototypes, the Bf 109D was the standard version of the Bf 109 in service with the Luftwaffe just before the start of World War II. Despite this, the type saw only limited service during the war, as all of the 235 Bf 109Ds still in Luftwaffe service at the beginning of the Poland Campaign were rapidly taken out of service and replaced by the Bf 109E, except in some night fighter units where some examples were used into early 1940. Variants included the D-0 and D-1 models, both having a Junkers Jumo 210D engine and armed with two wing-mounted and two nose-mounted 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17s. The D-2 was an experimental version with an engine-mounted machine gun, but as previously tried, this installation failed. The D-3 was similar to the C-3 but with two 20 mm MG FFs in the wings. A total of 647 Bf 109Ds of all versions were built by Focke-Wulf, Erla, Fieseler, Arado and AGO.Ritger 2006, p. 171. Messerschmitt is listed as having produced only four Bf 109Ds, probably the D-0 preproduction series with the serial production transferred to the licensed manufacturers. Several Bf 109Ds were sold to Hungary. Switzerland bought 10 109D-1s (Serial Numbers from 2301 until 2310) which had been built by the Arado-Flugzeugwerke GmbH factory located in Warnem√ºnde. Bf 109E In late 1938, the Bf 109E entered production. To improve on the performance afforded by the 441‚Äì515 kW (600‚Äì700 PS) Jumo 210, the larger, longer Daimler- Benz DB 601A engine was used, yielding an extra 223 kW (300 PS) at the cost of an additional 181 kg (400 lb). A much bigger cooling area was needed to disperse the extra heat generated by the DB 601, and this led to the first major redesign of the basic airframe. Enlarging the existing nose-mounted radiator sufficiently to cool the engine would have created extra weight and drag, negating some of the performance gains afforded by the increased power, so it was decided to move the main radiators to the undersurfaces of the wings immediately outboard of the junction of the wing root and wing panel, just forward of the trailing edges' inner ends, leaving the oil cooler under the nose in a small, streamlined duct. The new radiator position also had the effect of counterbalancing the extra weight and length of the DB 601, which drove a heavier three-bladed Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke (VDM)-made propeller.Cross and Scarborough 1976, p. 20 To incorporate the new radiators, the wings were almost completely redesigned and reinforced, with several inboard ribs behind the spar being cut down to make room for the radiator ducting. Because the radiators were mounted near the trailing edge of the wing, coinciding with the increased speed of the airflow accelerating around the wing camber, cooling was more effective than that of the Jumo engined 109s, albeit at the cost of extra ducting and piping, which was vulnerable to damage. The lowered undercarriage could throw up mud and debris on wet airfields, potentially clogging the radiators.Cross and Scarborough 1976, pp. 60, 62-63. To test the new 1,100 PS (1,085 hp, 809 kW) DB 601A engine, two more prototypes (V14 and V15) were built, each differing in their armament. While the V14 was armed with two 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17s above the engine and one 20 mm MG FF in each wing, the V15 was just fitted with the two MG 17s mounted above the engine.Feist 1993, p. 23. After test fights, the V14 was considered more promising and a pre-production batch of 10 E-0 was ordered. Batches of both E-1 and E-3 variants were shipped to Spain for evaluation, and first saw combat during the final phases of the Spanish Civil War. E-1 Bf 109E-3 The E-1 production version kept two 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17s above the engine and two more in the wings. Later, many were modified to the E-3 armament standard. The E-1B was a small batch of E-1s that became the first operational Bf 109 fighter bomber, or Jagdbomber (usually abbreviated to Jabo). These were fitted with either an ETC 500 bomb rack, carrying one 250 kg (550 lb) bomb, or four 50 kg (110 lb) bombs. The E-1 was also fitted with the Reflexvisier \\"Revi\\" gunsight. Communications equipment was the FuG 7 Funkger√§t 7 (radio set) short-range radio apparatus, effective to ranges of 48‚Äì56 km (30‚Äì35 mi). A total of 1,183 E-1 were built, 110 of them were E-1/B.RLM Lieferplan Nr. 18 Ausgabe 3, 01.11.1940 (Deliveries up to 31.10.1940) E-2 Only very limited numbers of the E-2 variant were built, for which the V20 prototype served as basis. It was armed with two wing-mounted, and one engine-mounted Motorkanone MG FF cannon, which gave considerable trouble in service, as well as two synchronized MG 17s cowl machine guns. In August 1940, II./JG 27 was operating this type.Mason 1973, pp. 8‚Äì9.Hitchcock 1973, p. 24. Bf 109E-3 of JG 51 'M√∂lders' at Deutsches Museum M√ºnchen E-3 To improve the performance of the Bf 109E, the last two real prototypes (V16 and V17) were constructed. These received some structural improvements and more powerful armament. Both were the basis of the Bf 109 E-3 version. The E-3 was armed with the two MG 17s above the engine and one MG FF cannon in each wing.Hannu Valtonen ‚Äì Messerschmitt Bf 109 ja saksan sotatalousCross and Scarborough 1976, p. 65. A total of 1,276 E-3 were built, including 83 E-3a export versions. Bf 109E-4 E-4 The E-3 was replaced by the E-4 (with many airframes being upgraded to E-4 standards starting at the beginning of the Battle of Britain), which was different in some small details, most notably by using the modified 20 mm MG-FF/M wing cannon and having improved head armour for the pilot. With the MG FF/M, it was possible to fire a new and improved type of explosive shell, called Minengescho√ü (or 'mine-shell'), which was made using drawn steel (the same way brass cartridges are made) instead of being cast as was the usual practice. This resulted in a shell with a thin but strong wall, which had a larger cavity in which to pack a much larger explosive charge than was otherwise possible. The new shell required modifications to the MG FF's mechanism due to the different recoil characteristics, hence the MG FF/M designation. The cockpit canopy was also revised to an easier-to-produce, \\"squared-off\\" design, which also helped improve the pilot's field of view. This canopy, which was also retrofitted to many E-1s and E-3s, was largely unchanged until the introduction of a welded, heavy-framed canopy on the G series in the autumn of 1942. The E-4 would be the basis for all further Bf 109E developments. Some E-4 and later models received a further improved 1,175 PS (1,159 hp, 864 kW) DB601N high-altitude engine; known as the E-4/N; owing to priority being given to equipping Bf 110s with this engine, one fighter gruppe was converted to this version, starting in July 1940.Mankau and Petrick 2004, p. 24 The E-4 was also available as a fighter-bomber with equipment very similar to the previous E-1/B. It was known as E-4/B (DB 601Aa engine) and E-4/BN (DB 601N engine). A total of 561 of all E-4 versions were built, including 496 E-4s built as such: 250 E-4, 211 E-4/B, 15 E-4/N and 20 E-4/BN. E-5, E-6 The E-5 and E-6 were both reconnaissance variants with a camera installation behind the cockpit. The E-5 was a reconnaissance variant of the E-3, the E-6 was a reconnaissance variant of the E-4/N. Twenty-nine E-5s were built and nine E-6s were ordered. E-7 A standard Luftwaffe 300 litre drop tank The E-7 was the next major production variant, entering service and seeing combat at the end of August 1940.Mason 1973, p. 9. One of the limitations of the earlier Bf 109Es was their short range of 660 km (410 mi) and limited endurance, as the design was originally conceived as a short-range interceptor. The E-7 rectified this problem as it was the first Bf 109 subtype to be able to carry a drop tank, usually the standardized Luftwaffe 300 L (80 US gal) capacity unit mounted on a centre-line rack under the fuselage, which increased its range to 1,325 km (820 mi). Fuel from the drop tank was pumped to the internal fuel tank via a large fuel line that ran up and along the inside starboard wall of the cockpit, with a clear sight glass located in the fuel line's main span so the pilot could easily see the flow of fuel and know when the tank was empty. Alternatively, a bomb could be fitted and the E-7 could be used as a Jabo fighter-bomber. Previous Emil subtypes were progressively retrofitted with the necessary fittings for carrying a drop tank from October 1940.Prien 2000, p. 183. Early E-7s were fitted with the 1,100 PS DB 601A or 1,175 PS DB 601Aa engine, while late-production ones received 1,175 PS DB 601N engines with improved altitude performance ‚Äì the latter was designated as E-7/N.Mankau and Petrick 2001, p. 24. A total of 438 E-7s of all variants were built.Ritger 2006, p. 173. _Bf 109E variants and sub-variants_ * E-0 (Pre-production aircraft with 4 √ó 7.92 mm/.312 in MG 17 machine guns) * E-1 (Similar to E-0) ** E-1/B (Fighter-bomber version of E-1, usually with DB 601Aa) * E-2 (Limited production, additional Motorkanone engine mounted MG FF cannon, otherwise as E-3) * E-3 (Similar to E-1 but 2 √ó 20 mm MG FFs in the wings instead of the MG 17) * E-4 (Armour and structural improvements, change of MG FF cannons to MG FF/M. \\"Square\\" canopy) ** E-4/B (Fighter-bomber version of E-4, 1 √ó 250 kg/550 lb bomb, usually with DB 601Aa) ** E-4 trop (Version of E-4 modified to serve in tropical regions) ** E-4/N (E-4 with DB601N engine) ** E-4/BN (Fighter- bomber version of E-4/N, 1 √ó 250 kg/550 lb bomb) * E-5 (Recon version of E-3, camera equipment, 2 √ó 7.92 mm/.312 in MG 17) * E-6 (Recon version of E-4/N, camera equipment, 2 √ó 7.92 mm/.312 in MG 17) * E-7 (Similar to E-4 but with optional 300 L drop tank) ** E-7/N (Similar to E-4/N but with optional 300 L tank) ** E-7/NZ (also known as E-7/Z, an E-7/N with additional GM-1 nitrous oxide injection system) ** E-7/U2 (Ground attack variant of E-7 with additional armour) * E-8 (Long-range version of E-1 using drop tank installation of E-7, 4 √ó 7.92 mm/.312 in MG 17) * E-9 (Recon version of E-7/N, drop tank, camera equipment, 2 √ó 7.92 mm/.312 in MG 17) Bf 109T Bf 109T-1 Prior to the war, the Kriegsmarine had become fascinated with the idea of the aircraft carrier. Borrowing ideas from the British and Japanese (mainly ), they started the construction of as part of the rebuilding of the navy. The air group for the carrier was settled on Messerschmitt Bf 109T fighters and Ju 87C dive bombers. The suffix 'T' denotes Tr√§ger (carrier) in German use. Despite references to a Bf 109 T-0 version.Green 1980, p. 82. this version never existed. Seven earlier versions (Bf 109 B, Bf 109 C, Bf 109 E) were converted to test carrier equipment. This included adding a tail-hook, catapult fittings and increasing the wingspan to 11.08 m (36.35 ft). The ailerons were increased in span, as were the slats, and flap travel was increased. The wings were not modified to be folding since the ship Graf Zeppelin was designed around the intended aircraft, so the lifts could accommodate the Bf 109T with its 11 m (36 ft) wingspan. The wings could, however, be detached from the fuselage for transport purposes, as in every version of the Bf 109.Radinger and Schick 1997Marshall 1994Marshall 2002 Following flight tests, especially the catapult tests, 70 T-1 with DB601Ns were to be produced at Fieseler in Kassel, but after seven T-1s were built, the carrier project was cancelled. The remaining 63 of 70 T-1s were built as T-2s without carrier equipment and some of the T-1s may have been \\"upgraded\\" to T-2 standard. It was found that the performance of the T-2 was closely comparable to the E-4/N and, because of its ability to take off and land in shorter distances, these fighters were assigned to I/JG.77, deployed in Norway on landing strips which were both short and subject to frequent, powerful cross-winds.Green 1980, pp. 82‚Äì83. At the end of 1941 the unit was ordered to return their aircraft to Germany and received E-3s as replacements.Command from the OKL from 23 December 1941 The armament of the Bf 109T consisted of two 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17s above the engine and one 20 mm MG FF/M cannon in each wing. Interest in Graf Zeppelin revived when the value of aircraft carriers became obvious, and in 1942 the ship was back in the yards for completion. By this time, the Bf 109T was hopelessly outdated and a new fighter would be needed. Messerschmitt responded with the updated Me 155A series, but work on the ship was again canceled and the Me 155 was later re- purposed as a high-altitude interceptor. Design work was transferred to Blohm & Voss and the aircraft was then known as the BV 155. The Bf 109Ts were issued to several training units in 1943. Then, in April 1943, the Jagdstaffel Helgoland was formedBundesarchiv-Milit√§rarchiv RL2 III 723 and operated from D√ºne until late 1943, when the unit transferred to Lista in south Norway. The unit was renamed as 11./JG 11 as of 30 November 1943BA-MA RL2 III 727 and the Bf 109Ts remained in operation until the summer of 1944, after which some were used in training units in Germany. Bf 109F Prototypes Messerschmitt Bf 109 F-2 Development of the new Bf 109 F airframe had begun in 1939. After February 1940, an improved engine, the Daimler-Benz DB 601E, was developed for use with the Bf 109. The engineers at the Messerschmitt facilities took two Bf 109 E-1 airframes and installed this new powerplant. The first two prototypes, V21 (Werknummer (Works number) or W.Nr 5602) and V22 (W.Nr 1800) kept the trapeziform wing shape from the E-1, but the span was reduced by 61 cm (2 ft) by \\"clipping\\" the tips. Otherwise the wings incorporated the cooling system modifications described below. V22 also became the testbed for the pre- production DB 601E. The smaller wings had a detrimental effect on the handling so V23, Stammkennzeichen (factory Code)These factory codes were used by all second line aircraft, such as trainers, communication, some Air Service aircraft and others not engaged in operational use.Stammkennzeichen CE+BP, W.Nr 5603, was fitted with new, semi-elliptical wingtips, becoming the standard wing planform for all future Bf 109 combat versions. The fourth prototype, V24 VK+AB, W.Nr 5604, flew with the clipped wings but featured a modified, \\"elbow\\"-shaped supercharger air-intake, which was eventually adopted for production, and a deeper oil cooler bath beneath the cowling.Green 1980, pp. 84‚Äì86. On all of these prototypes, the fuselage was cleaned up and the engine cowling modified to improve aerodynamics. Aerodynamic improvements Compared to the earlier Bf 109 E, the Bf 109 F was much improved aerodynamically. The engine cowling was redesigned to be smoother and more rounded. The enlarged propeller spinner, adapted from that of the new Messerschmitt Me 210, now blended smoothly into the new engine cowling.Radinger and Otto 1999, p. 14. Underneath the cowling was a revised, more streamlined oil cooler radiator and fairing. A new ejector exhaust arrangement was incorporated, and on later aircraft a metal shield was fitted over the left hand banks to deflect exhaust fumes away from the supercharger air-intake. The supercharger air-intake was, from the F-1 -series onwards, a rounded, \\"elbow\\"-shaped design that protruded further out into the airstream. A new three-blade, light-alloy VDM propeller unit with a reduced diameter of 3 m (9 ft 8.5 in) was used. Propeller pitch was changed electrically, and was regulated by a constant-speed unit, though a manual override was still provided. Thanks to the improved aerodynamics, more fuel-efficient engines and the introduction of light-alloy versions of the standard Luftwaffe 300 litre drop tank, the Bf 109 F offered a much increased maximum range of 1,700 km (1,060 mi)Beim-zeugmeister : Das Leistungsverm√∂gen der Bf 109 F-4 ‚Äì Britische Testergebnisse. compared to the Bf 109 E's maximum range figure of only 660 km (410 miles) on internal fuel, and with the E-7's provision for the 300 litre drop tank, a Bf 109E so equipped possessed double the range, to 1,325 km (820 mi). The canopy stayed essentially the same as that of the E-4, although the handbook for the 'F' stipulated that the forward, lower triangular panel to starboard was to be replaced by a metal panel with a port for firing signal flares. Many F-1s and F-2s kept this section glazed. A two-piece, all-metal armour plate head shield was added, as on the E-4, to the hinged portion of the canopy, although some lacked the curved top section. A bullet-resistant windscreen could be fitted as an option.Prien and Rodeike 1995, pp. 11‚Äì18. The fuel tank was self-sealing, and around 1942 Bf 109Fs were retrofitted with additional armour made from layered light-alloy plate just aft of the pilot and fuel tank. The fuselage aft of the canopy remained essentially unchanged in its externals. The tail section of the aircraft was redesigned as well. The rudder was slightly reduced in area and the symmetrical fin section changed to an airfoil shape, producing a sideways lift force that swung the tail slightly to the left. This helped increase the effectiveness of the rudder, and reduced the need for application of right rudder on takeoff to counteract torque effects from the engine and propeller. The conspicuous bracing struts were removed from the horizontal tailplanes which were relocated to slightly below and forward of their original positions. A semi-retractable tailwheel was fitted and the main undercarriage legs were raked forward by six degrees to improve the ground handling. An unexpected structural flaw of the wing and tail section was revealed when the first F-1s were rushed into service; some aircraft crashed or nearly crashed, with either the wing surface wrinkling or fracturing, or by the tail structure failing. In one such accident, the commander of JG 2 \\"Richthofen\\", Wilhelm Balthasar, lost his life when he was attacked by a Spitfire during a test flight. While making an evasive manoeuvre, the wings broke away and Balthasar was killed when his aircraft hit the ground. Slightly thicker wing skins and reinforced spars dealt with the wing problems. Tests were also carried out to find out why the tails had failed, and it was found that at certain engine settings a high-frequency oscillation in the tailplane spar was overlapped by harmonic vibrations from the engine; the combined effect being enough to cause structural failure at the rear fuselage/fin attachment point. Initially, two external stiffening plates were screwed onto the outer fuselage on each side, and later the entire structure was reinforced. The entire wing was redesigned, the most obvious change being the new quasi-elliptical wingtips, and the slight reduction of the aerodynamic area to 16.05 m¬≤ (172.76 ft¬≤). Other features of the redesigned wings included new leading edge slats, which were slightly shorter but had a slightly increased chord; and new rounded, removable wingtips which changed the planview of the wings and increased the span slightly over that of the E-series. Frise-type ailerons replaced the plain ailerons of the previous models. The 2R1 profile was used with a thickness-to-chord ratio of 14.2% at the root reducing to 11.35% at the last rib. As before, dihedral was 6.53¬∞. The wing radiators were shallower and set farther back on the wing. A new cooling system was introduced; this system was automatically regulated by a thermostat with interconnected variable position inlet and outlet flaps that would balance the lowest drag possible with the most efficient cooling. A new radiator, shallower but wider than that fitted to the E was developed. A boundary layer duct allowed continual airflow to pass through the airfoil above the radiator ducting and exit from the trailing edge of the upper split flap. The lower split flap was mechanically linked to the central \\"main\\" flap, while the upper split flap and forward bath lip position were regulated via a thermostatic valve which automatically positioned the flaps for maximum cooling effectiveness.109 F cooling system Retrieved 24 April 2008. In 1941 \\"cutoff\\" valves were introduced which allowed the pilot to shut down either wing radiator in the event of one being damaged; this allowed the remaining coolant to be preserved and the damaged aircraft returned to base. However, these valves were delivered to frontline units as kits, the number of which, for unknown reasons, was limited.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 12. These cutoff valves were later factory standard fitting for Bf 109 GErs√§tzteiliste Bf 109 G, pp. 117‚Äì118. and K series.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 169.Ers√§tzteiliste Bf 109 K, Rumpfwerk, Baugruppe 209.728. Armament The armament of the Bf 109 F was revised and now consisted of the two synchronized 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17s with 500 rpg above the engine plus a Motorkanone cannon firing through the propeller hub. The pilots' opinion on the new armament was mixed: Oberst Adolf Galland criticised the light armament as inadequate for the average pilot, while Major Walter Oesau preferred to fly a Bf 109 E, and Oberst Werner M√∂lders saw the single centreline Motorkanone gun as an improvement. With the early tail unit problems out of the way, pilots generally agreed that the F series was the best-handling of all the Bf 109 series.Radinger and Otto 1999, p. 15. M√∂lders flew one of the first operational Bf 109 F-1s over England from early October 1940; he may well have been credited with shooting down eight Hurricanes and four Spitfires while flying W.No 5628, Stammkennzeichen SG+GW between 11 and 29 October 1940.M√∂lders victory list Retrieved 20 April 2008. Bf 109 F sub-variants =F-0, F-1, F-2= Bf 109 F-2/Trop. As the DB 601 E was not yet available in numbers, the pre-production F-0 (the only F variant to have a rectangular supercharger intake) and the first production series F-1/F-2 received the 1,175 PS (1,159 hp, 864 kW) DB 601N engine driving a VDM 9-11207 propeller. The F-0/F-1 and F-2 only differed in their armament; the F-1 being fitted with one 20 mm MG FF/M Motorkanone firing through the propeller hub, with 60 rounds. The F-1 first saw action in the Battle of Britain in October 1940 with JG 51.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 9. The most experienced fighter aces like Werner M√∂lders were the first ones to fly Bf 109 F-1s in combat in October 1940.Prien and Rodeike 1995, pp. 8‚Äì9.

As the harder-hitting 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 version become available, a number of F-2s were retrofitted with it in the field. About 1,230 F-2s were built between October 1940 and August 1941 by AGO, Arado, Erla, Messerschmitt Regensburg and WNF(Wiener Neust√§dter Flugzeugwerke). No tropical version was built, although F-2s were fitted with sand filters in the field.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 18.

The 1,350 PS (1,332 hp, 993 kW) DB 601 E was used in the F-3 and F-4 model together with a VDM 9-12010 propeller with broader blades for improved altitude performance.Radinger and Otto 1999, p. 19. The DB 601 E was initially restricted to 1,200 PS (1,184 hp, 883 kW) at 2,500 rpm; however, the full rating of 1,350 PS at 2,500 rpm was cleared for service use by February 1942. The DB 601 E ran on standard 87 octane \\"B-4\\" aviation fuel, despite its increased performance; while the earlier DB 601 N required 100 octane \\"C-3\\" fuel.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 24. Only 15 examples of the F-3 are believed to have been produced by Messerschmitt Regensburg between October 1940 and January 1941. Like the F-1, the F-3 was armed with the 20 mm MG-FF/M and two 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17s.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 23. From the F-4 onward, the new 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 with 200 rounds was used as the Motorkanone. The first F-4s reached frontline units in June 1941. Production lasted exactly a year between May 1941 and May 1942, with 1,841 of all F-4 variants produced.Prien and Rodeike 1995, pp. 23‚Äì24. Some of the later models were capable of mounting two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons under the wing in faired gondolas with 135 rpg. These were designated F-4/R1 and 240 of them were produced by WNF in the first quarter of 1942.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 28. This optional additional armament was standardized as field kit for later G and K series. A special high-altitude variant, the F-4/Z featuring GM-1 boost, was also built with a production run of 544 in the first quarter of 1942 and saw extensive use.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 27. Finally, the Erla factory produced 576 tropicalized F-4 trop in the first half of 1942. Bf 109 F-6. With its initial engine rating of 1,200 PS, the maximum speed of the F-4 (and F-3) was 635 km/h (394 mph) at rated altitude; and with the clearance of the full rating of 1,350 PS, maximum speed increased to 659 km/h (410 mph) at 6,200 m (20,341 ft).Hitchcock 1990, p. 34 * F-3 (As F-1 but with 1350 PS DB 601E engine, produced in limited numbers) * F-4 (As F-2 but with DB 601E engine, 20 mm MG 151/20 \\"Motorkanone\\" cannon replacing the 15 mm MG 151) ** F-4/R1 (capable of mounting two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons in underwing gondolas) ** F-4/R2 (dedicated recon version, 5 built) ** F-4/R3 (dedicated recon version, 36 built) ** F-4/Z (As F-4, high-altitude fighter with GM-1 boost) ** F-4 trop (Tropicalized fighter) * F-5 (planned but not built) * F-6 (planned but not built) * F-8 (planned but not built) Bf 109G Introduction Bf 109G-2/Trop \\"Black 6\\", Now on static display RAF Hendon London The Bf 109 G-series was developed from the largely identical F-series airframe, although there were detail differences. Modifications included a reinforced wing structure, an internal bullet-proof windscreen, the use of heavier, welded framing for the cockpit transparencies, and additional light-alloy armour for the fuel tank. It was originally intended that the wheel wells would incorporate small doors to cover the outer portion of the wheels when retracted. To incorporate these the outer wheel bays were squared off. Two small inlet scoops for additional cooling of the spark plugs were added on both sides of the forward engine cowlings. A less obvious difference was the omission of the boundary layer bypass outlets, which had been a feature of the F-series, on the upper radiator flaps.Prien and Rodeike 1995, pp. 49, 66.Bf 109F, G and K radiator design Retrieved 23 February 2008. Like most German aircraft produced in World War II, the Bf 109 G-series was designed to adapt to different operational tasks with greater versatility; larger modifications to fulfil a specific mission task, such as long-range reconnaissance or long- range fighter-bomber, were with \\"R√ºststand\\" and given a \\"/R\\" suffix, smaller modifications on the production line or during overhaul, such as equipment changes, were made with kits of pre-packaged parts known as Umr√ºst-Baus√§tze, usually contracted to Umbau and given a \\"/U\\" suffix. Field kits known as R√ºsts√§tze were also available but those did not change the aircraft designation. Special high-altitude interceptors with GM-1 nitrous oxide injection high-altitude boost and pressurized cockpits were also produced. Bf 109G-2, Wings of Dream Museum in S√£o Carlos, Brazil The newly fitted Daimler- Benz DB 605A engine was a development of the DB 601E engine utilised by the preceding Bf 109 F-4; displacement and compression ratio were increased as well as other detail improvements to ease large-scale mass production. Takeoff and emergency power of 1,475 PS (1,455 hp, 1,085 kW) was achieved with 1.42 atm (42.5 inches/6.17 lbs) of boost at 2,800 rpm. The DB 605 suffered from reliability problems during the first year of operation, and this output was initially banned by VT-Anw.Nr.2206, forcing Luftwaffe units to limit maximum power output to 1,310 PS (1,292 hp, 964 kW) at 2,600 rpm and 1.3 atm manifold pressure (38.9 inches/4.4 lbs). The full output was not reinstated until 8 June 1943 when Daimler-Benz issued a technical directive.Radinger and Otto 1999, p. 23. Up to 1944, the G-series was powered by the 1,475 PS Daimler-Benz DB 605 driving a three-blade VDM 9-12087A variable-pitch propeller with a diameter of with even broader blades than used on the F-series. Pitch control, as on the 109F, was either electro-mechanical (automatic) or manual-electric using a thumb-switch on the throttle lever. From 1944 a new high-altitude propeller with broader blades was introduced, designated VDM 9-12159, and was fitted to high-altitude variants with the DB 605AS or D-series engines. The early versions of the Bf 109G closely resembled the Bf 109 F-4 and carried the same basic armament; however, as the basic airframe was modified to keep pace with different operational requirements, the basically clean design began to change. From the spring of 1943, the G-series saw the appearance of bulges in the cowling when the 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 were replaced with 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine guns (G-5 onwards) due to the latter's much larger breechblock, and on the wings (due to larger tyres), leading to the Bf 109 G-6's nickname \\"Die Beule\\" (\\"The Bulge\\"). The Bf 109G continued to be improved: new clear- view cockpits, greater firepower in the form of the 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 cannon were introduced in late 1943; and a new, enlarged supercharger in the high-altitude DB 605AS engine, a larger vertical stabilizer (G-5 onwards), and MW 50 power boost in 1944. Erich Hartmann, the World's top scoring fighter ace, claiming 352 victories, flew only the Bf 109G, of which he said: From the Bf 109 G-5 on an enlarged wooden tail unit (identifiable by a taller vertical stabilizer and rudder with a morticed balance tab, rather than the angled shape) was often fitted. This tail unit was standardised on G-10s and K-4s. Although the enlarged tail unit improved handling, especially on the ground, it weighed more than the standard metal tail unit and required that a counterweight was fitted in the nose, increasing the variant's overall weight.Feist 1993, p. 37. With the Bf 109G, a number of special versions were introduced to cope with special mission profiles. Here, long-range fighter- reconnaissance and high-altitude interceptors can be mentioned. The former were capable of carrying two 300 L (80 US gal) drop tanks, one under each wing; and the latter received pressurized cockpits for pilot comfort and GM-1 nitrous oxide \\"boost\\" for high altitudes. The latter system, when engaged, was capable of increasing engine output by above the rated altitude to increase high-altitude performance. Early Bf 109G models Gustav R√∂del Bf 109 G-2 remake in the Luftwaffenmuseum in Berlin =G-1, G-2= The G-1, produced from February 1942, was the first production version of the G-series and the first production Bf 109 with a pressurized cockpit. It could be identified by the small, horn-shaped air intake for the cockpit compressor just above the supercharger intake, on the left upper cowling. In addition, the angled armour plate for the pilot's head was replaced by a vertical piece which sealed-off the rear of the side-hinged cockpit canopy. Small, triangular armour-glass panels were fitted into the upper corners of this armour, although there were aircraft in which the plate was solid steel. Silica gel capsules were placed in each pane of the windscreen and opening canopy to absorb any moisture which may have been trapped in the double glazing. The last 80 G-1s built were lightweight G-1/R2. In these GM-1 nitrous oxide 'boost' was used, and the pilot's back armour was removed, as were all fittings for the long-range drop tank. A few G-1 flown by I./JG 1 are known to have carried the underwing 20 mm MG 151/20 cannon gondolas.Prien and Rodieke 1995, pp. 57‚Äì62. Bf 109 G-2. The G-2, which started production in May 1942, lacked the cabin pressurization and GM-1 installation.Feist 1993, p. 154. Performance-wise it was identical to the G-1. The canopy reverted to one layer of glazing and incorporated the angled head armour used on the F-4, although several G-2 had the vertical type as fitted to the G-1. Several R√ºsts√§tze could be fitted, although installing these did not change the designation of the aircraft. Instead the \\"/R\\" suffix referred to the G-2's R√ºstzustand or equipment condition of the airframe, which was assigned at the factory rather than in the field. There were two R√ºstzustand planned for G-2s: * G-2/R1: Long-range fighter-bomber. It carried a bomb up to 500 kg (1,100 lb) under the fuselage and had a modified fuel system with underwing fittings for a 300 L (80 US gal) drop tank. As a standard Bf 109G had not enough ground clearance to carry a 500 kg bomb, a jettisonable auxiliary undercarriage was added just aft of the cockpit. The prototype was the FiSk 199. No production known * G-2/R2: a reconnaissance aircraft with GM-1 and camera equipment. The rack and internal fuel lines for carrying a 300 L (80 US gal) under-fuselage drop-tank were widely used on G-2s, as were the underwing 20 mm MG 151/20 cannon gondolas. Several G-2s were fitted with the ETC 500 bomb rack, capable of carrying one 250 kg (550 lb) bomb. The final G-2 production batches built by Erla and Messerschmitt Regensburg were equipped as tropical aircraft (often referred to as G-2 trop), equipped with a sand-filter on the front of the supercharger intake and two small, teardrop-shaped metal brackets on the left side of the fuselage, below the cockpit sill. These were used as mounts for specially designed sun umbrellas (called Sonderwerkzeug or Special tool), which were used to shade the cockpit.Prien and Rodieke 1995, pp. 62‚Äì79. A total of 167 G-1s were built between February and June 1942,Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 57. 1,586 G-2s between May 1942 and February 1943, and one further G-2 was built in Gy≈ër, Hungary, in 1943.Prien and Rodeike 1995, pp. 62‚Äì63. Maximum speed of the G-2 was 537 km/h (334 mph) at sea level and 660 km/h (410 mph) at 7,000 m (22,970 ft) rated altitude with the initial reduced 1.3 atm rating. Performance of the G-1 was similar, but above rated altitude the GM-1 system it was equipped with could be used to provide an additional 350 horsepower.Griehl 2004, p. 5. With his G-1/R2, pilot R. Klein achieved 660 km/h (420 mph) at 12,000 m (39,370 ft), and a ceiling of 13,800 m (45,275 ft). The following variants of the G-1 and G-2 were produced: * G-0 (Pre-production aircraft, powered by a DB 601E engine) * G-1 (Pressurized fighter, powered by a DB 605A engine) ** G-1/R2 (Reconnaissance fighter) ** G-1/U2 (High-altitude fighter with GM-1) * G-2 (Light fighter) ** G-2/R1 (Long-range Fighter-bomber or JaboRei, with 2 √ó 300 L/80 US gal underwing drop tanks, 500 kg/1,100 lb bomb under fuselage, extended second tail wheel, only prototype) ** G-2/R2 (Reconnaissance fighter) ** G-2 trop (Tropicalized fighter) =G-3, G-4= Bf 109 G-4 W.Nr. 19310 on display at Technikmuseum Speyer In September 1942, the G-4 appeared; this version was identical to the G-2 in all aspects, including performance, except for being fitted with the FuG 16 VHF radio set, which provided much clearer radio transmissions and had three-times the range of the earlier HF sets. Externally this could be recognised by the position of the fuselage antenna lead-in which was moved further aft to between frames seven and eight on the fuselage spine.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 81. Due to the steady weight increases of the 109, from the spring of 1943 larger 660 √ó 160 mm (26 √ó 6.3 in) mainwheels were introduced, replacing the previously used 650 √ó 150 mm (25.6 √ó 6 in) type. The undercarriage legs were altered so that the wheel's vertical axis was nearly upright rather than being parallel with the oleo leg. These changes resulted in the fitting of teardrop-shaped fairings to the upper wing surface above the wheel-wells to accommodate the upper part of the mainwheels. The larger wheels and fairings were often retrofitted to G-2s.The last production G-2s were fitted with the enlarged mainwheels and tailwheel while the first of the G-4s used the smaller wheels. In addition, a larger 350 √ó 135 mm (14 √ó 5 in) tailwheel replaced the original 290 √ó 110 mm (11 √ó 4 in) one; the larger tailwheel no longer fitted the recess, so the retraction mechanism was disconnected and the tailwheel fixed down.Prien and Rodeike 1995, pp. 84‚Äì85. Up to July 1943, 1,242 G-4s were produced, with an additional four in Gy≈ër and WNF factories in the second half of 1943.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 80. Between January and February 1943, 50 examples of a pressurized version, the G-3 were also produced; similar to the G-1 although it was equipped with the same FuG 16 VHF radio set as the G-4.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 96. The following variants of the G-3 and G-4 were produced: * G-3 (Pressurized fighter, as G-1 with FuG 16 VHF radio; 50 built) * G-4 (Fighter) ** G-4/R2 (Reconnaissance fighter) ** G-4/R3 (Long-range reconnaissance fighter, with 2 √ó 300 L/80 US gal underwing droptanks) ** G-4 trop (Tropicalized fighter) ** G-4/U3 (Reconnaissance fighter) ** G-4y (Command fighter) =G-5, G-6= In February 1943, the G-6 was introduced with the 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131s, replacing the smaller 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 ‚Äì externally this resulted in two sizeable Beule blisters over the gun breeches, reducing speed by 9 km/h (6 mph). Over 12,000 examples were built well into 1944 although contradictory factory and RLM records do not allow an exact tally.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 99. The G-5 with a pressurized cockpit was identical to the G-6. A total of 475 examples were built between May 1943 and August 1944.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 134. The G-5/AS was equipped with a DB 605AS engine for high-altitude missions. GM-1-boosted G-5 and G-6 variants received the additional designation of \\"/U2\\".Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 137. and were clearly identifiable as they use a modified, aerodynamically cleaner, engine cowl without the usual blisters. Bf 109G-6 on display in the Polish Aviation Museum in Krak√≥w The G-6/U4 variant was armed with a 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 cannon mounted as a Motorkanone firing through the propeller hub instead of the 20 mm MG 151/20.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 108. The G-6 was very often seen during 1943 fitted with assembly sets, used to carry bombs or a drop tank, for use as a night fighter, or to increase firepower by adding rockets or extra gondola-style, underwing gun pod mount ordnance. The following variants of the G-5 and G-6 were produced: Bf 109 G-6 * G-5 (Pressurized fighter) ** G-5/U2 (High-altitude fighter with GM-1 boost) ** G-5/U2/R2 (High-altitude reconnaissance fighter with GM-1 boost) ** G-5/AS (High-altitude fighter with DB 605AS engine) ** G-5y (Command fighter) * G-6 (Light fighter) ** G-6/R2 (Reconnaissance fighter, with MW 50) ** G-6/R3 (Long-range reconnaissance fighter, with 2 √ó 300 L/80 US gal underwing droptanks) ** G-6 trop (Tropicalized fighter) ** G-6/U2 (Fitted with GM-1) ** G-6/U3 (Reconnaissance fighter) ** G-6/U4 (As G-6 but with 30 mm/1.18 in MK 108 Motorkanone engine cannon) ** G-6y (Command fighter) ** G-6/AS (High- altitude fighter with DB 605AS engine) ** G-6/ASy (High-altitude command fighter) ** G-6N (Night fighter, usually with R√ºstsatz VI (two underwing MG 151/20 cannons) and sometimes with FuG 350Z Naxos) ** G-6/U4 N (as G-6N but with 30 mm/1.18 in MK 108 Motorkanone engine cannon) One offensive weapons upgrade in 1943 for the Bf 109G ‚Äî and also used for the Fw 190A ‚Äî was one that mounted the Werfer-Granate 21 heavy calibre rocket weapon system with one launching tube under each wing panel.Vogt 1998, p. 15. The rockets, fitted with a massive 40.8 kg (90 lbs) warhead, were aimed via the standard Revi reflector sights, and were spin-stabilized in flight. In emergency, the tubes could be jettisoned via a small explosive charge.Vogt 1998, p. 15. Intended as a \\"stand-off\\" weapon, fired from a distance of 1,200 meters and outside the effective range of the formations defensive guns, it was employed against Allied bomber formations, the Wfr. Gr. 21 rocket was unofficially known as the BR 21 (Bordrakete 21 cm) for the Bf 109G-5, G-6 and G-14. The weapons system received the designation of R√ºstsatz VII on the G-10. Late Bf 109G models =Improvements to the design= During the course of 1943, a number of improvements were gradually introduced. In an attempt to increase the pilot's field of view an armoured glass head-rest, the so-called Galland Panzer was developed, and subsequently began replacing the bulky armour plate in the spring of 1943. Towards the end of the year the clear-view, three-panel Erla Haube canopy appeared, named after the Erla Maschinenwerk sub-contractor involved in building new examples, and upgrading older examples of the Bf 109. Often misnamed the \\"Galland Hood\\" in postwar Western aviation books and periodicals, it eventually replaced the older heavily framed two-piece canopy ‚Äî comprising the starboard side-hinged six-panel main canopy, and the three- panel fixed rear unit fastened to the fuselage ‚Äî on the Bf 109G. The canopy structure was completely redesigned to incorporate a greater area of clear perspex; the welded framing for the three-panel Erla Haube design was reduced to a minimum and there was no longer a fixed rear portion, with the entire structure aft of the windscreen being hinged to swing to starboard when opened.Prien and Rodeike 1995, pp. 104‚Äì105. The Bf 109 G-10, AS-engined G-5s, G-6s and G-14s as well as the K-4 saw a refinement of the engine cowlings. The formerly separate, added-on Beule blisters which had earlier covered the spent shell-casing chutes of the synchronized fuselage-mount MG 131s were completely integrated into the upper cowling panels, vastly improving their streamlining and allowing them to be lengthened and enlarged to cover both the weapons and the engine bearers. Initial prototype versions were symmetrical, but as larger superchargers were fitted, the engines required modified upper engine bearers to clear the supercharger housing, and as a result the final shape of the new cowling was asymmetrical, being enlarged on the port side where the supercharger was mounted on the DB engine. There were also special streamlined panels fitted to the forward fuselage. These so-called agglomerations could be seen in several different patterns. Because of their aerodynamically more efficient form in a side-view of DB 605AS and D -powered Bf 109 Gs and Ks, the agglomerations were barely discernible compared with the conspicuous fairings they replaced.Prien and Rodeike 1995, pp. 112‚Äì113, 178‚Äì181, 188‚Äì189. =Late- production G-6, G-14, G-14/AS= Bf 109 G-14. Some versions of the G-6 and later Gs had a taller, wood-structure tail unit and redesigned rudder with an inset rudder balance protruding forward into the fin which improved stability at high speeds. The introduction of the WGr. 21 cm (8 in) under-wing mortar/rockets and the 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 cannon increased firepower. Certain production batches of the Bf 109G were fitted with aileron Flettner tabs to decrease stick forces at high speeds. A radio-navigational method, the Y-Verf√ºhrung (Y-Guidance) was introduced with the FuG 16ZY.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 149. Subsequent Bf 109G versions were essentially modified versions of the basic G-6 airframe. Early in 1944, new engines with larger superchargers for improved high-altitude performance (DB 605AS), or with MW-50 water injection for improved low/medium-altitude performance (DB 605AM), or these two features combined (DB 605ASM) were introduced into the Bf 109 G-6. Maximum speed of the G-5/G-6 was 530 km/h (320 mph) at sea level, 640 km/h (391 mph) at 6,600 m (21,650 ft)-rated altitude at 1.42 atm boost. The G-14 arrived in July 1944 at the invasion front over France.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 144. It represented an attempt to create a standard type, incorporating many changes which had been introduced during production of the G-6, and which led to a plethora of variants, plaguing decentralized mass production. The standardization attempt proved to be a failure, but overall the type offered improved combat performance, as MW 50 power boosting water injection (increasing output to 1,800 PS (1,775 hp, 1,324 kW), the clear-view Erla Haube was now standard installation.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 147. Top speed was 568 km/h (353 mph) at sea level, and 665 km/h (413 mph) at 5 km (16,400 ft) altitude. A high-altitude fighter, designated G-14/AS was also produced with the DB 605ASM high-altitude engine. The ASM engine was built with a larger capacity supercharger, and had a higher rated altitude, and correspondingly the top speed of the G-14/AS was 560 km/h (348 mph) at sea level, and 680 km/h (422 mph) at 7.5 km (24,600 ft) altitude. There was increasing tendency to use plywood on some less vital parts e.g. on a taller fin/rudder unit, pilot seat or instrument panel. A cautious estimate based on the available records suggest that about 5,500 G-14s and G-14/AS were built.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 145. The following variants of the G-14 were produced: * G-14 (Fighter; standardized late-production G-6; DB 605AM engine, MW 50 boost) ** G-14/AS (High-altitude fighter with DB 605ASM engine, MW 50 boost) ** G-14/ASy (High- altitude command fighter) ** G-14y (command fighter) ** G-14/U4 (As G-14, but with 30 mm/1.18 in MK 108 Motorkanone engine cannon) =G-10= Messerschmitt Bf 109G-10 at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio Referred to as the \\"bastard aircraft of the Erla factory\\" in the Luftwaffes Aircraft Variants Book of December 1944,Griehl 2004, p. 70. the G-10 was a Bf 109 G airframe combined with the new DB 605 D-2 engine, created to maintain production levels with minimal disruption of the assembly lines until production of K-series airframes would reach sufficient levels. Despite what the designation would suggest, it appeared in service after the G-14 in November 1944, largely replacing previous G-series aircraft on the production lines of Erla, WNF and Messerschmitt Regensburg factories. Contrary to popular belief the G-10 were not rebuilt older airframes but new production. Early production G-10 may have had two data plates (one stamped G-14) as these airframes were originally intended for G-14 assembly but were diverted to G-10 assembly. Bf 109 G-10 - note swept-forward radio antenna mast, under port wing's leading edge. The most recognizable external change was the use of the three-panel Erla-Haube clear-view canopy, which filled the entire canopy length behind the four-panel windscreen unit, which eliminated the older, rear fixed canopy section. Internal changes included inheriting the new 2,000 W generator and the DB 605 D-2 engine of the 109K. Apart from the standardised streamlined engine cowlings, G-10s with the DB605 D-2 were equipped as standard with the MW-50 booster system (DB 605DM, later 605DB) and had a larger Fo 987 oil cooler housed in a deeper fairing. Also, because of the engine's enlarged crankcase and the oil return lines which ran in front of it, these G-10s had small blister fairings incorporated into the lower engine cowlings, forward of and below the exhaust stacks, except for Erla-built aircraft, which had modified cowlings without the little bulges in front of the exhaust stacks. This became a distinguishing feature between Erla-built G-10s and those of other factories.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 159. The radio antenna mast was also removed from atop the rear fuselage turtledeck, and replaced with a standard late-war Luftwaffe ventral whip aerial antenna under the wing. The following variants of the G-10 were produced: * G-10 (Light fighter with DB605DM or DB/DC engine) ** G-10/R2 (Reconnaissance fighter) ** G-10/R6 (Bad-weather fighter with PKS 12 autopilot) ** G-10/U4 (As G-10 but with 30 mm/1.18 in MK 108 Motorkanone engine cannon) Approximately 2,600 G-10s were produced from October 1944 until the war's end. =Miscellaneous variants: G-8, G-12= The G-8 was a dedicated reconnaissance version based on the G-6. The G-8 often had only the Motorkanone engine cannon or the cowling machine guns installed, and there were several subversions for short- or long-range reconnaissance missions with a wide variety of cameras and radios available for use.Prien and Rodeike 1996, pp. 139‚Äì141. The Bf 109 G-12 was a two-seat trainer version of the Bf 109. This was a conversion of \\"war- weary\\" or rebuilt G-4 and G-6 airframes;Feist 1993, pp. 41‚Äì42. the space needed for the second cockpit was gained by reducing the internal fuel capacity to only 240 L (60 US gal) meaning that the 300 L (80 US gal) drop tank was employed as standard equipment. This version was rarely armed with anything more than one or two cowling machine guns.Feist 1993, p. 156. The rear cockpit canopy was bowed out to give the instructor, who sat behind the student pilot in an armoured seat, a clearer view. The rear cockpit was also equipped with a basic instrument panel and all flight controls.Prien and Rodieke 1996, p. 142. =Bf 109G subtypes and variants= The base subtypes could be equipped with R√ºstsatz add-on standard field kits; in practice this meant hanging on some sort of additional equipment like droptanks, bombs or cannons to standard attachment points, present on all production aircraft. Aircraft could be modified in the factory with Umr√ºst-bausatz (Umbau) conversion kits or by adding extra equipment, called R√ºstzustand, to convert standard airframes for special roles, a reconnaissance or bad-weather fighter, for example. Unlike the R√ºstsatz field-kits, these modifications were permanent. The R√ºstsatz kits were labelled with the letter \\"R\\" and a Roman numeral. R√ºstsatz kits did not alter the aircraft type so a Bf 109 G-6 with R√ºstsatz II (50 kg/110 lb bombs) remained a Bf 109 G-6 and not G-6/R2, which was a reconnaissance fighter with MW 50, as suggested by most publications. The Umr√ºst-Bausatz, Umbau or R√ºstzustand were identified with either an \\"/R\\" or \\"/U\\" suffix and an Arabic number, e.g. Bf 109 G-10/U4.

The wingspan was increased through the addition of new, constant-chord inner wing panels to 11.92 m (39.11 ft), and the widened stabilizer again received a supporting strut leading from the fuselage, like the B through E models. Maximum speed was 750 km/h (470 mph) at 10,100 m (33,140 ft). A small number of Bf 109 H-1s were built, flying several sorties over Britain and France. Bf 109H-2 and H-5 developments were also planned, but the entire H-series was scrapped because of wing flutter problems.Fesit 1993, p. 45. * H-0 (Pre-production aircraft, rebuilt from F-4/Z, powered by a DB 601E engine with GM-1 boost) * H-1 (Production version, based on G-5 airframes, powered by a DB 605A engine with GM-1 boost) A record exists of one particular Bf 109H-1, Werknummer 110073, was recorded as having been converted to a photo-recon aircraft by a Luftwaffe long-range reconnaissance group, Fernaufkl√§rungsgruppe 123, in May 1944, and flown on dates immediately following the Invasion of Normandy with one mission meant to scan the entire French coastline from Cherbourg to Ouistreham, from an altitude of some 15 km (49,200 ft), which proved to be just beyond the achievable ceiling of the selected aircraft. Bf 109K K-4 Messerschmitt Bf 109 K-4 The Bf 109K was the last of the series to see operational duty and the last in the Bf 109 evolutionary line. The K series was a response to the bewildering array of series, models, modification kits and factory conversions for the Bf 109, which made production and maintenance complicated and costly ‚Äì something Germany could not afford late in the war. The RLM ordered Messerschmitt to rationalise production of the Bf 109, consolidating parts and types to produce a standard model with more interchangeable parts and equipment; flaws in the design of the airframe were also to be remedied. Work on the new version began in the spring of 1943 and the prototype was ready by autumn. Series production started in August 1944 with the K-4 model, due to changes in the design and delays with the new DB 605D powerplant. The K-4 was the only version to be mass-produced.Prien and Rodeike 1998, p. 166. Externally the K series could be identified by changes in the locations of the radio equipment hatch, which was moved forward and to a higher position between frames four and five and the filler point for the fuselage fuel tank, which was moved forward to a location between frames two and three.The shape of the hatch was changed in that the lower edge sloped up slightly to the front. The D/F loop was moved aft to sit between frames three and four on the fuselage spine and a small circular plate above the footstep on the port side of the fuselage was deleted. The rudder was fitted as standard with a Flettner tab and two fixed tabs although some rare examples were not fitted with the fixed tabs. All K-4s were to be fitted with a long retractable tail wheel () with two small clamshell doors covering the recess when the tail-wheel was retracted. The wings featured the large rectangular fairings for the large main wheels. Small wheel well doors, originally planned for the G series, were fitted to the outer ends of the wheel bays, covering the outer wheels when retracted. These doors were often removed by front-line units. The radio equipment was the FuG 16ZY with the relocated main swept- forward radio antenna under the port wing from the G-10 being carried through as the standard for the K-series airframes. The FuG 25a Erstling IFF system, as well as the FuG 125 Hermine D/F equipment were also fitted. Internally, the oxygen bottles were relocated from the rear fuselage to the right wing.Prien and Rodeike 1995, pp. 171‚Äì174. Flettner tabs for the ailerons were also to be fitted to serial production aircraft to reduce control forces but were extremely rare, with the majority of the K-4s using the same aileron system as the G series.Poruba and Janda 1997, p. 79. Armament of the K-4 consisted of a MK 108 engine-mounted cannon (Motorkanone) with 65 rounds and two MG 131s in the nose with 300 rpg, although some K-4s were fitted with the MG 151/20 as the Motorkanone.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 174. Additional R√ºsts√§tze (equipment kits) such as a 300 L (80 US gal) drop tank (R III), bombs up to the size of (R I), underwing 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 cannon gondola pods (R IV) or Wfr.Gr. 21 rockets (as on the Gustav models) could be carried after minimal preparation; the latter two were rarely used by Bf 109 units at this stage of the war, although III./JG 26 were almost completely equipped with K-4s which were fitted with R IV: There were problems with the MK 108 Motorkanone, which often jammed while the aircraft was manoeuvring in battle, leaving the pilot to fight on with the two MG 131 heavy machine guns.Poruba and Janda 1997, p. 84. The standard Revi 16C reflector sight was fitted, which was slated to be replaced by the EZ 42 Gyro gunsight, although this never happened.Griehl 1987, p. 41. Power in production K-4s was supplied by the Daimler-Benz DB 605 DB/DC engine (very early K-4s used the earlier DM). The DB/DC engine had an adjusting screw allowing the engine to use either B4 + MW 50 Methanol Water injection equipment or C3 fuel (DB 605 DB) or C3 fuel with or without MW 50 (DB 605 DC).Mermet 1999, pp. 19‚Äì21. The DB when using B4 fuel with MW 50 had an emergency power rating of 1,600 PS at 6,000 m (1,160 PS maximum continual at 6,600 m) and generated take-off power of 1,850 PS at 0 m at a maximum supercharger boost of 1.8 ata.Mermet 1999, p 46.Poruba and Janda 1997, p. 81. The DB could also be run on higher octane C3 fuel, but the use of MW 50 was forbidden. The DC ran on C3 fuel and had a potential to generate 2,000 PS when using C3 fuel with MW 50, and a boost of 1.98 ata, but otherwise the power ratings were similar to that of the DB.The shortage of C3 fuel and other problems meant that it was doubtful that 1.98 ata boost was ever used operationally, apart from being tested by II./JG 11. A wide-chord, three- bladed VDM 9-12159A propeller of diameter was used, as on the G-6/AS, G-14/AS and G-10. Deliveries began in mid-October 1944 and 534 examples had been delivered by the Messerschmitt A.G., Regensburg by the end of November and 856 by the end of the year.Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 167.Radinger and Otto 1999, p. 45. Regensburg delivered a total of 1,593 by the end of March 1945, after which production figures are missing. With such a high rate of production, despite continuous heavy fighting, by the end of January 1945, 314 K-4s ‚Äì about every fourth 109 ‚Äì were listed on hand with the first line Luftwaffe units. Ultimately it was intended to equip all Bf 109 units with the 109K, which marked the final stage of 109 development before the jet age.Zobel and Mathmann 1995, p. 43. Using MW 50 and maximum boost the Bf 109 K-4 was the fastest 109 of World War II, reaching a maximum speed of 710 km/h (440 mph) at altitude.Hitchcock 1979, p. 34. Without MW 50 and using 1.80 ata the K-4 reached 670 km/h (416 mph) at .Poruba and Janda 1997, p. 36. The Initial Rate of climb was /min, without MW 50 and /min, using MW 50. Improved propellers were being developed when the war ended which would have boosted the speed to 727 km/h (452 mph); 741 km/h (459 mph) was expected with an experimental swept-back propeller design. The Bf 109 remained comparable to opposing fighters until the end of the war but the deteriorating quality of the thousands of novice Luftwaffe pilots pressed into service by this stage of the war meant the 109's strengths were of little value against the numerous and well-trained Allied fighter pilots. Other Bf 109K projects and prototypes Bf 109 K-6. Several other versions were projected based on the 109K airframe ‚Äì K-6, K-8, K-10 and K-14. In the proposed K-6 the armament would have been two 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 above the engine, along with a 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 Motorkanone and an internally mounted MK 108 in each wing, with 45 rpg. Alternatively, the wing MK 108s could be substituted by 20 mm MG 151/20s, with 100 rpg. Armour weight was increased to . Takeoff weight was . Some K-6 prototypes were built and tested at the Erprobungstelle Tarnewitz weapons-testing centre on the Baltic coast.Hitchcock 1979, pp. 22‚Äì30. Project drawings of the K-8 show a K-series airframe powered by the two-stage DB 605L high altitude engine, a high-velocity 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 103 Motorkanone, and two 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 cannons in the wings; the cowl 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131s were dispensed with.Hitchcock 1979, p. 27. Some sources point to limited use of the K-14, intended as high-altitude heavy fighter. Two airframes are listed as delivered to II./JG52 under Major Wilhelm Batz in late spring of 1945, these being armed with only one 30 mm (1.18 in) cannon, but the type's existence cannot be positively confirmed. The K-14 was to be powered by the two-stage supercharged DB 605L engine, using a four-bladed propeller. , and an operational altitude of was projected. Armour and armament were otherwise similar to the K-6. Common R√ºstsatz kits, Bf 109KWerkschrift 2109 Bf 109 K-4 Flugzeug Handbuch. Teil 0, Allgemeine Angaben, 1944. Pg. 34.

The engine chosen was the Pratt & Whitney R-1830 of 1200 hp. The Messerschmitt company received a contract from RLM/LC on 13 June 1938 to fit the P&W; Twin Wasp on the Bf 109 V21 (21st prototype) Werknummer 1770 (D-IFKQ). Even the maiden flight date is not known; it is established that Hermann Wurster flew it at Augsburg on 17 August 1939. In September 1940 it was part of the DVL (Deutsche Versuchsanstalt f√ºr Luftfahrt) at Brauschweig-V√∂lkenrode with the Stammkennzeichen code KB+II. Its end is not known. As the BMW 801 radial engine became available, a Bf 109F, Werknummer 5608, callsign D-ITXP was converted with a BMW 801 A-0. This aircraft became a prototype for the Bf 109X. The fuselage had a wider cross-section, and a new canopy was fitted. The wing tips were akin to that of the Bf 109E. The prototype was first flown by Flugkapit√§n Fritz Wendel on 2 September 1940, and the test flights continued despite troubles with the BMW 801A powerplant. Development was stopped in early 1942. Bf 109Z \\"Zwilling\\" Bf 109Z-1 This experimental aircraft was essentially two Bf 109F airframes joined together by means of a new wing centre section and new tailplane, both of constant chord, in a manner paralleled by the F-82 Twin Mustang. In the preproduction model, the right fuselage cockpit was faired over and the pilot flew the aircraft from the left side fuselage. Additional modifications included setting the main undercarriage hinges further inboard, with associated strengthening of the fuselage and modifications to the wing forward structure. Four variants of this aircraft were proposed. One was an interceptor armed with five 30 mm (1.18 in) cannon and up to a 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) bomb load, another a fighter- bomber armed with two MK 108 cannon and up to two 2,200 lb. bombs. Both airframes were to be powered by the DB605 engine. A third and fourth were designed on paper and would be similar to the first two airframes but powered by Jumo 213 engines. Only one Bf 109Z was built, and it was never flown, having been damaged in its hangar during an Allied bombing raid in 1943. The project was permanently abandoned in 1944.Bf109 variants overview (German)Green, W.; Warplanes of the Third Reich, Macdonald and Jane's, 1970. Bf 109TL Bf 109TL The Bf 109TL was first proposed on 22 January 1943 at an RLM conference; at the time only three prototypes of the Me 262 had been completed. The Bf 109TL would be a backup if the Me 262 did not come to production or as a second fighter to operate alongside the Me 262. In order to reduce development time, various components from previous aircraft were to be used. The fuselage was to come from the Bf 109H/BV 155B high-altitude fighter (with a new nose and tail section), the wing was from the Me 409 project and the tricycle undercarriage came from the Me 309. The powerplant would be the same Junkers Jumo 004B-1 turbojet (900 kgf thrust) or BMW 003A (800 kgf). The basic armament was to be two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons (with 120 rpg) and two MK 103 cannons mounted in the nose. An additional proposal was two 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 cannons to be installed in the wing roots. The pilot cockpit used in the prototypes was the same as utilized in the Bf 109E/G types. The performance was estimated to be possibly better than the Me 262 due to the Bf 109TL's narrower fuselage, a product of the design for a high-speed high- altitude fighter. The Bf 109TL received intensive research. By March 1943, it was decided that many other modifications to components would be needed and the project was abandoned in order to concentrate on the Me 262 project. Fieseler und Skoda FiSk 199 Experimental version of Bf 109G-2/R1 with extra landing gear, one ventral 250 kg bomb and two drop tanks under wings Developments after World War II Czechoslovak production S 199 After the war, some Bf 109s were produced in Czechoslovakia as the Avia S-99 and Avia S-199. These were modified Bf 109G-14s, the latter with the inferior Junkers Jumo 211F engine, which resulted in an aircraft with remarkably poor handling characteristics and a tendency to crash during landings. As noted above, Czech pilots who had previously flown Spitfires for the RAF nicknamed the aircraft Mezek (\\"Mule\\"). They were replaced in frontline service by Soviet jets in 1952, but flew on as trainers for another five years.Glancey 2006, p. 150. Several of the S-199s were sold to Israel, forming the basis of the fledgeling Israeli Air Force.Avia S.199 Spanish production Hispano Aviaci√≥n HA-1112 Buchon, the second and last Spanish version built by Hispano Aviaci√≥nIn Spain, two versions of the Bf 109G-2, the Hispano Aviaci√≥n HA-1112 \\"Tripala\\" and \\"Buch√≥n\\", were built under license, the former with the Hispano- Suiza engine, and the latter with the same Rolls-Royce Merlin engines that had powered Spitfires. Many of these aircraft have been used for theatrical purposes, posing (rather obviously, given their very distinctive undernose air intakes, mandated by the R-R Merlin engines they used) as \\"Emils\\" and \\"Gustavs\\" in Battle of Britain and The Tuskegee Airmen, respectively. These modifications were carried out in the Hispano Aviaci√≥n factory in Seville. Germany had agreed to let Spain have 25 un-assembled Bf 109G-2s to help familiarize the Spanish with the type. The wings and airframes arrived but not the engines, so the Spanish installed the French Hispano-Suiza engine, and then fitted Rolls-Royce Merlins as late as 1956. A few were still in active service until the late 1960s. The Ha 1112 was produced until 1958. References Footnotes Citations Bibliography * Beale, Nick, Ferdinando D'Amico and Gabriele Valentini.

On April21, 1958, the Douglas DC-7 serving the flight crashed in southern Nevada following a The aircraft assigned to Flight 736, an airliner with 47 aboard (42 passengers, 5 crew), was flying at cruise altitude above Clark County, en route to a stopover at Denver, Colorado, when it was struck by a United States Air Force fighter jet crewed by two pilots. The collision occurred at 8:30 a.m. in clear weather within a major commercial airway; both aircraft fell out of control from and crashed into unpopulated desert terrain southwest of Las Vegas. There were no survivors from either aircraft, and with 49 fatalities it remains the deadliest crash in the history of the Las Vegas Valley. Among the victims were a group of military personnel and civilian contractors involved with sensitive Department of Defense weapons systems. The loss of the group triggered new rules prohibiting similar groups engaged in critical projects from flying aboard the same aircraft. The official investigation stated that cockpit visibility limitations played a role in the accident, but also faulted military and civilian aviation authorities for not taking measures to reduce well known collision risks that had existed for over a year within the confines of airways, despite numerous complaints from airline crews. The loss of Flight 736, one of a series of 1950s mid-air collisions in American skies, helped usher-in widespread improvements in air traffic control within the United States. Events leading to the accident Flight 736, a four-engined DC-7 propliner with registration departed Los Angeles International Airport at 7:37 a.m. on a flight to New York City with stops in Denver, Kansas City, and Washington, D.C. On board were 42 passengers and five crew members; Captain Duane M. Ward, 44, First Officer Arlin E. Sommers, 36, Flight Engineer Charles E. Woods, 43, and Stewardesses Pauline Mary Murray, 22, and Yvonne Marie Peterson, 27. Of the passengers on the flight, seven were military personnel and 35 were civilians. Soon after takeoff the airliner was directed into airway \\"Victor 8,\\" on a route that took it east over Ontario, California, and then northeast toward Las Vegas. The crew flew the DC-7 under instrument flight rules, controlled by Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA) ground stations, at an authorized altitude of toward the first stopover at Denver. alt=Rear quarter view of a single engine jet fighter taking off from a runway located in a desert. The bare metal finish jet has a checkerboard unit insignia on its vertical tail. The landing gear are raised. The horizon is hilly. Approximately 8 minutes after the DC-7 had departed Los Angeles, a U.S. Air Force F-100F-5-NA Super Sabre jet fighter, serial number 56-3755, took off from Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas at 7:45 a.m. on a training flight with two pilots on board. In the front seat of the tandem cockpit was flight instructor and safety pilot Capt. Thomas N. Coryell, 29, and behind him sat his student, 1st Lt. Gerald D. Moran, 24, who as part of his training would spend the flight under a hood that blocked his view outside the aircraft, but allowed him to see his instrument panel. The instructor had two-way microphone communication with the student, and his duties were to instruct the student in the rear seat, monitor his performance and maintain a lookout for other aircraft. The F-100F had dual pilot controls and the instructor could take over flying the jet at any time. The training flight involved a descent and approach to Nellis Air Force Base under simulated instrument meteorological conditions from an altitude of . The descent was to be a \\"teardrop pattern,\\" with the Las Vegas commercial radio station KRAM as the navigational fix, a process that was referred to as the \\"KRAM procedure.\\" The prescribed descent angle for the KRAM procedure was about five degrees. At 8:14 a.m. the United Airlines crew radioed a routine position report over the Mojave Desert to notify controllers that they expected to arrive over McCarran Field near Las Vegas at 8:31 a.m. Air Force pilot Moran radioed the control tower at Nellis Air Force Base at 8:28 a.m. to report that he would now begin a procedural \\"jet penetration\\" descent to . As the fighter descended, the airliner was approaching Las Vegas air space at about on a heading of 23degrees, flying straight-and-level within the confines of its designated airway. The CAA stations controlling the airliner were unaware of the fighter jet; the Air Force controllers at Nellis Air Force Base directing the jet were unaware of the airliner. Collision alt=Newspaper front page. Headline states in large font \\"L.A. AIRLINE, JET COLLIDE; 49 KILLED. An aerial photo of the desert crash site is immediately below the headline. The photo shows emergency vehicles surrounding shattered and burned wreckage from which dark smoke rises. At 8:30 a.m., despite clear skies with excellent visibility of about , the flight paths of the two aircraft intersected about southwest of Las Vegas. The converging aircraft collided nearly head-on at an altitude of at an estimated closure speed of . The descending Air Force jet, flying at , had clipped the airliner's right wing with its own right wing, immediately sending both aircraft out of control. At the moment of collision the F-100F was in a 90degree bank to the left at a down angle of about 17 degrees. One eyewitness to the collision stated that about two seconds before the collision the wings of the F-100F \\"dipped\\"; another eyewitness said the fighter \\"swooped down\\" just before the impact. The witness descriptions and the extreme 90 degree bank of the fighter jet--far more than the 30 degrees outlined in the KRAM procedure--suggest an unsuccessful \\"last second\\" evasive action on the part of the Air Force crew. Moments after the two planes collided, the only mayday distress call radioed by the United Airlines crew was heard at 8:30 a.m. plus 20 seconds. The crippled airliner--now missing about eight feet (2.5 m) of its right wing--trailed black smoke and flames as it spiraled earthward, and crashed into a then-empty patch of desert outside the town of Arden in what is now the unincorporated town of Enterprise. The nearly vertical impact and subsequent explosion instantly killed everyone on board. The fighter jet--its right wing and right tailplane torn away by the collision--left a trail of fragments as it arced downward, and crashed west of the small community of Sloan into a hilly area of uninhabited desert, several miles south of the DC-7 crash site. At least one of the Air Force pilots was still in the jet when it hit the ground, but contemporary news reports differ on whether the other pilot managed an unsuccessful ejection at too low an altitude to survive, or stayed with the jet all the way to the ground. Witnesses reported seeing a parachute drifting away from the falling F-100F, leading to the hope that a pilot had ejected, but when the parachute was located it was determined to be a drag parachute that is meant to be deployed on landing to help slow the fighter down. Investigations alt=Inside view of a cramped cockpit, facing forward and slightly to the right.

Forty round instrument dials are on a flat panel in front of two seats. Facing each seat is a short column topped with a semi-circular control yoke. Between the seats are two clusters of engine throttles, one set of four for each pilot. At the request of the local sheriff and United Airlines, the Federal Bureau of Investigation sent fingerprint experts to help identify the human remains. The Los Angeles Times reported that among the dead were 13 civilian and military managers, engineers and technicians assigned to the American ballistic missile program. Articles in the Las Vegas Review-Journal commemorating the 40th and 50th anniversaries of the crash reported that the FBI search went beyond fingerprint matching for identification; the agents were also looking for any surviving sensitive papers relating to national security that the group of military contractors had carried on board in handcuffed briefcases. The same reports also said the crash prompted the military and defense industry to adopt rules to keep groups of technical people involved in the same critical project from traveling together on the same plane. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) conducted an investigation and published a report on the accident. The CAB ruled out the weather conditions and the airworthiness of the two planes as factors in the collision. The report stated the probable cause was the high rate of near head-on closure, and that at high altitude, there were human and cockpit limitations involved. Analysis of the approach angles concluded that a metal frame support on the F-100's canopy \\"interfered seriously\\" with detection of the DC-7, and a supporting pillar on the DC-7's windshield may have hindered sighting the fighter. The CAB accident report also cited a failure of Nellis Air Force Base and the CAA to take measures to reduce a known collision exposure; training exercises were allowed to be conducted for more than a year prior to the collision within the confines of several airways, even after numerous near-misses with military jets had been reported by airline crews. Legacy This mid-air collision, and another a month later over Maryland, between a Capital Airlines airliner (Flight 300) and another military jet, accelerated efforts in the United States to change the way air space was allocated to commercial and military flights. On April 22, the day after the Flight 736 collision, the CAB proposed an experiment in which it would set aside part of the air space from which would be barred all aircraft lacking specific clearance to enter it. All aircraft operating in the designated space would have to be equipped for instrument flight operations. According to the CAB there had been 159 mid-air collisions in the years 1947‚Äì1957, and 971 near-misses in 1957 alone. The increased speed of aircraft and higher air traffic density made it harder to give pilots enough time to spot each other during flights. Therefore, the CAB said, \\"it is essential that positive control be extended to altitudes at 35,000feet and on additional routes as rapidly as practical.\\" At the time such control only existed between 17,000 and 22,000feet on certain transcontinental airways. In the wake of the two airliners lost in the April and May 1958 collisions, investigators from a House of Representatives committee--concerned about the lack of coordination between civil and military air traffic controllers--imposed a 60-day deadline on the CAB and the Air Force to establish new control procedures. The committee also said that eventually a single civil agency should be given the power to regulate all air space for all types of aircraft. Furthermore, the committee stated that military flying should be controlled in the vicinity of airways not only in instrument weather, but also in visual conditions. Four months after the accident the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 was signed into law. The act dissolved the CAA and created the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA, later renamed Federal Aviation Administration). The FAA was given unprecedented and total authority over the control of American air space, including military activity, and as procedures and ATC facilities were modernized, airborne collisions gradually decreased in frequency. The Las Vegas Review-Journal in a 50th anniversary article stated that the act \\"specifically referenced the crash of United 736 in ordering the creation of the FAA.\\" The supersonic F-100 left a legacy of many crashes over its years of service; nearly 25 percent were lost to accidents. In particular, 1958 was the most costly, with 47 F-100 pilots killed and 116 of the fighters destroyed, a loss rate averaging almost one every three days. Legal aftermath Following the collision at least 31 lawsuits seeking damages were brought against United Airlines, the U.S. Government, or both. On September 24, 1958, United Airlines filed for damages--based on the Federal Tort Claims Act--against the United States in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The airline alleged that the United States through its agents in the United States Air Force negligently operated the F-100F, and sought damages of US$3,576,698. The court found neither crew was negligent for a failure to see and avoid each other, but held the United States was liable because of other negligence. The case was settled on December17, 1962, with the United States agreeing to pay the airline $1.45million. In another case, on January 8, 1964 surviving relatives of two of the United Airlines crew were awarded a total of $343,200 from the government, with U.S. District Court Judge Hatfield Chilson finding the Air Force pilots did not use \\"ordinary care\\" in operation of the fighter jet, and should have yielded the right of way to the DC-7 airliner. Chilson also criticized the Air Force for not coordinating instrument training flights with civilian instrument flight rules traffic, and for failing to schedule flights to minimize traffic congestion. The government appealed, and the relatives cross-appealed to have their damage awards increased, but the earlier 1964 judgment was affirmed on September 30, 1965. Nearby crash sites The 49 lives lost in this aviation accident were the worst in the history of the Las Vegas region, but it has experienced other major airliner crashes. In 1942 movie star Carole Lombard and 21 others died in the mountainside crash of TWA Flight 3, about WSW of where United Airlines Flight 736 crashed. In 1964, 29 people lost their lives when Bonanza Air Lines Flight 114 flew into a hilltop SW of the United Airlines impact site; the F-100F crashed in the same area of desert hills as the Bonanza Air Lines flight. At both of those rugged, mountainous sites, salvage efforts removed the more accessible and valuable wreckage, but scattered and sometimes substantial portions of the TWA DC-3 and Bonanza Air Lines Fairchild F-27 were left behind, including the DC-3's radial engines. The United Airlines DC-7 crash site, however, has been cleared of all but the smallest artifacts, and is threatened by development. In 1958 the site was at least a mile from the nearest paved road; today, the spot where the DC-7 hit is adjacent to the developed neighborhood of Southern Highlands near the intersection of Decatur Boulevard and Cactus Avenue. Six decades after the events of April 21, 1958, a small metal cross placed in the sandy soil in 1999 by the son of a victim is the only sign of the loss of United Airlines Flight 736, but preliminary efforts were in motion to encourage public officials to build a permanent memorial to those who died.

Sir Hubert Wilkins photographed this feature from the air in 1928 and gave it the name \\"Crane Channel\\", after C.K. Crane of Los Angeles, reporting that it appeared to be a channel cutting in an east-west direction across the peninsula. The name was altered to \\"Crane Inlet\\" following explorations along the west coast of the peninsula in 1936 by the British Graham Land Expedition, which proved that no through channel from the east coast existed as indicated by Wilkins. Comparison of Wilkins' photograph of this feature with those taken in 1947 by the Falklands Islands Dependencies Survey shows that Wilkins' \\"Crane Channel\\" is this glacier, although it lies about northeast of the position originally reported by Wilkins. The speed of Crane Glacier increased threefold after the collapse of the Larsen B Ice Shelf in 2002 and this is likely to be due to the removal of a buttressing effect of the ice shelf.

The Grootrivier (Afrikaans for \\"Great River\\") is one of various mountain streams that over millions of years have cut through the coastal plateau towards the sea. The R102 winds its way from the N2 on the coastal plateau, which is an ancient sea-bed now at 220m above sea-level, through dense coastal forest, down to the resort of Nature's Valley on the Grootrivier and then climbs the opposite slope, back to the plateau. The pass was finished in 1880 by Thomas Bain and major reconstruction was carried out on both sections in 2010. The route from plateau down to sea-level and then back to the plateau, was dictated by the wide and deep gorge carved by the Grootrivier and stretching inland to the Tsitsikamma Mountains. Modern bridge-building techniques spanned the three gorges of the Grootrivier, the Bloukrans River and the Storms River, allowing the opening of the freeway in June 1984. The forest is home to a myriad of bird species as well as small antelope, vervet monkeys, baboons and leopards.

The company funnel was black with three widely spaced narrow white bands. BDS progressively expanded its routes to provide world wide services. The company operated a regular passenger service from West Norway to the UK with Norwegian Government support from 1890, and took part in the Norwegian coastal service, the Hurtigruten, from 1894 until 1979. Cruise liners were run from 1921 until 1971 when BDS partnered Nordenfjeldske Dampskibsselskab in setting up the Royal Viking Line. At its height, between about 1920 and 1970, the company had up to 2500 employees. During World War II several BDS ships were sunk by Allied action on the Norwegian coast, including in which over 2500 lives were lost. According to the newspaper Bergens Tidende the Company profited highly from shipping contracts entered into with the German occupiers of Norway. At the end of the war the Company's records were no longer in existence. The Company's management was investigated by Bergen police for 18 months, but no charges were brought. Under the name Bergen Line (not to be confused with the Bergen Line railway) passenger ships were operated between Newcastle, Stavanger, Haugesund and Bergen. These continued after 1984 when the company was taken over by Kosmos Line. After being sold again in 1988, the company lost any individual identity.  Fleet  From a slow start the Company increased its ship numbers from 5 in 1875 to 20 in 1894 and over 45 by 1916 when unrestricted submarine warfare was introduced. The numbers were then increased from 35 in 1918 to 55 by 1939, reduced to 35 by 1945, with a modest increase thereafter.Kielhau, Wilhelm, Norway and the Bergen Line 1851-1951, BDS, Bergen, 1953  UK Passenger Service  The UK passenger service ran between Newcastle and Bergen, with some sailings also calling at Stavanger and Haugesund. From 1928 the service terminated at the purpose-built Tyne Commission Quay, North Shields, only two miles from the Tyne piers and now part of the Royal Quays complex. The service continued after 1984 when the company was taken over by Kosmos Line. After being sold again in 1988, the company lost any individual identity. On June 14, 1888, the Norwegian Parliament agreed to support a weekly mail service from Newcastle to Bergen and Trondheim. Initially the service was provided jointly by the Bergen Line and Nordenfjeldske. The Bergen Line vessel, Mercur (), inaugurated the service, departing from Bergen on May 31, 1890 at 9 p.m., arriving in the Tyne early on June 2. In June 1893 the Bergen Line ship Venus (), built on the Tyne by Swan Hunter, entered the service and remained on regular sailings until 1931. In 1912 the Norwegian Government entered a contract with the two companies to increase the frequency of sailings to seven per week. According to Kielhau this was achieved by August 1914 at the start of World War I when the Bergen Line's contribution was provided by Venus, Vega () and Irma (). From August 22 of that year all British mail for the Far East was sent via Newcastle and Bergen and the route became the only safe one for the exchange of personnel between the Western Powers and their Russian ally. In 1915 the service was joined by Jupiter (), built at Gothenburg and twice the size of previous ships on the route. Sailings were interrupted at the end of 1916 after four BDS ships including Vega had been intercepted and sunk by U-boats in two months; but Jupiter was chartered by the British Government at ¬£30,000 per year, with the replacement cost set at ¬£200,000, to continue a service between Aberdeen and Bergen with a British crew and under the British flag, with priority guaranteed in a British shipyard for building a replacement should Jupiter meet with an accident. Normal regular services were restarted by Irma on November 26, 1918, followed by Jupiter on January 18, 1919. Nordenfjeldske withdrew in October 1921 but sailings continued with Jupiter and Venus, joined by Leda (), a sister to Jupiter powered by steam turbines, newly built on the Tyne in 1920 by Armstrong Whitworth. In 1931, in response to a new route opened by Swedish Lloyd between Gothenburg and Tilbury, Bergen Line ordered a new Venus, a 20-knot motorship of , thus once again doubling the size of ship on the route. She maintained the service with Jupiter during most of the 1930s. In 1936 the peak season was covered by Jupiter and Venus, each with two round trips weekly. The next ship to be built for the service was Vega of , built by Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico of Trieste in 1938 to offset Italian purchases of fish from Norway. The two large twin-funnelled motorships maintained a summer service of four round trips per week until the outbreak of World War II, with departures from Bergen at 11.00 on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and from Newcastle at 19.30 on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Southbound trips from Bergen by Venus on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and northbound trips from the Tyne by Vega on Tuesdays and Saturdays also called at Stavanger and Haugesund. By 1945 both Venus and Vega had been sunk while in German hands, and the service was re- opened with Lyra (), a regular passenger service restarting in January 1946 on which she was joined by Astrea (). Jupiter took over from Lyra in March 1946. Vega's main engines were salvaged in 1949 and installed in two ships, one of which continued in service until 1969. Venus had been discovered sunk in Hamburg harbour in 1945 and judged capable of rebuilding, and she reappeared on the service in April 1948 with a larger profile which had the forecastle built one deck higher (). She maintained summer sailings from Newcastle and operated cruises from Plymouth to Madeira in the winters from December 1948 onwards, which also took advantage of the cargo opportunity provided by the import of fruit and vegetables to the UK. The last conventional passenger ferry was (), delivered in 1953 by Swan Hunter and powered by steam turbines giving a speed of 22 knots, making her the only ship which could complete three round voyages weekly, and she did so during the 1950s and 1960s. From 1953 the service continued regularly for 15 years with Leda and Venus operating the summer service with up to five sailings per week, and Leda operating a twice-weekly winter service. Both ships were limited by their lack of drive-on car transport facilities, and Venus was withdrawn and broken up in 1968. Leda continued until its withdrawal in 1974 after steep rises in fuel prices. Some timetables from the 1930s and 1950s are available on the web. Individual ship histories are also available.  Hurtigruten  The Hurtigruten opened in 1893 to convey passengers and cargo along the Norwegian coast, initially from Trondheim to Hammerfest, later from Bergen to Kirkenes. At the start there were almost no lighthouses and other navigational aids in the north, and navigation was often done with a compass, chart and stopwatch. Until 1937 the company's ships were around but then, with , the size was doubled.

The airline took over services from Bechuanaland National Airways which ceased operations in late 1966. The airline was formed by Johnny Gibson under the leadership of D. Morgan. After Botswana's independence, Bechuanaland National Airways was renamed Botswana National Airways. It began services on domestic and regional routes utilising Douglas DC-3 and DC-4 aircraft and later a Vickers Viscount and Fokker F-27, which saw flights being operated from Gaborone to Livingstone and Lusaka in Zambia, and Johannesburg in South Africa. Services to Bulawayo in Rhodesia were commenced in October 1966 in conjunction with South African Airways. Domestic flights were flown with a Britten-Norman Islander and a Beech Baron, with the F-27 sometimes being utilised on the Gaborone-Francistown route. During 1967, the airline began to carry diesel fuel for the Roan Selection Trust Copper mines in Zambia and a Douglas DC-4, acquired from Philippine Airlines, was utilised in which the airline flew 32 tons of fuel daily between Francistown and Livingstone, from where it was carried by rail to the Copperbelt region. Following the 1968 United Nations Security Council resolution banning air transportation to and from Rhodesia, Botswana National Airways was forced to cease operations to Bulawayo. The airline suspended operations in late 1969, and was placed into receivership. The bankruptcy court deemed that it would be impossible for the airline to emerge from receivership and to recover its debts, which in July 1969 totalled some 453,600 rand. The company was acquired by the Government of Botswana and Burton Construction in July 1969, and Botswana Airways Corporation was formed on 1 November 1969.

First released on compact disc in West Germany in the late 1980s, it was not released in that format in the rest of Europe until 1993. For this issue, two bonus tracks, the single version of \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and a live version of \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\". A later remastered issue in 1999 added a third bonus track, a live version of \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\". Background This album was recorded and released following Graham Nash's departure from the band to join David Crosby and Stephen Stills in December 1968 after early sessions for a follow-up to the psychedelic concept album, Butterfly broke down. Nash became frustrated when the other band members showed opposition to lyrics in his latest compositions. By that time, Nash was the only member of the band using LSD and marijuana and a rift was forming between him and his beer drinking bandmates: Nash quickly became disillusioned with the direction that the band was moving artistically and especially derided their decision to record an entire album of covers: Nash has claimed in interviews that he sang on the version of \\"Blowing in the Wind\\", and indeed, a TV appearance of the band playing the song with Nash from late 1968 exists (One of the last TV shows he did with the band). However, his name does not appear on the album credits. There have been claims that the album was hated by fans and critics alike. However it peaked at no. 3 in the UK, their third highest showing for any LP and second-highest charting for one with newly recorded material. Nevertheless, the group's next album was titled Hollies Sing Hollies in an apparent move to placate critics. In an interview for Billboard magazine in 1974, Clarke reflected on the album: This is the first album with new member Terry Sylvester, who replaced Nash.

There are plans to gradually convert the road into a full motorway. Therefore, exits would be built replacing the two intersections in Westrode/Londerzeel and a bridge replacing the intersection near Breendonk. However, in 2010, the intersections are being modernised instead and a frontage road is partially being built in the direction of Brussels.

Altitude 850 ‚Äì 920 meters high, population is 30,000, area 14 square km, number of homes 2,870. Bordering Towns: Deir El Qamar, Beit Eddine, Aynbal, Deir Dourit, Symkanieh, and Jahlieh. History Founded in the 12th century by the Maan emirs, Baakline served as their capital until the early 17th century when its most famous Emir Fakhreddin II, moved to Deir el Qamar. Today Baakline is an important Druze town and seat of the sect's religious leader. The beautiful grand serail, the main administrative building of Baakline before World War II, has been restored and transformed into a public library. In the area of the Serail are some Druze religious buildings of the 18th and 19th centuries, including, ancient tombs and Ain Aldiaa water source. The roots of Lebanon as we know it today go back to Baakline. Around the year 1120 A.D., Amir Maan Ibn Rabeaah, the great grandfather of Amir Fakher Eddine Al Maani the second who established ‚ÄúLubnan Al Kabeer‚Äù, settled in Baakleen with his tribe. He was supported by his in- laws, the Tanoukhyeen. Amir Maan was married to the daughter of Amir Noaaman Al Tanoukhy. Historians agree that Baakleen was the capital of the Maani Emirate. Due to water shortages in Baakline, the Maani Amirs were attracted to Neighboring Deir Al Kamar (according to Druze archives, called Dar Al Kamar), where they built many palaces and a mosque that still stands in the middle of the town square carrying the name of Amir Fakher Eddine Ibn Othman Ibn Al Hajj Younis Al Maani (1493 AD). The last of the Maan family Amirs was Amir Ahmad who died in 1697 A.D. and with his death, the rulers of the Emirate became the Shihab family who were tied to the Maan family through intermarriages and alliances. Under the Ottoman rule, Baakline came back to the forefront as one of the ‚ÄúQasabat‚Äù or major towns. It served as the summer capital for the Druze ‚ÄúQaem Makqam‚Äù or the local governor in the name of the Ottoman Sultan. On 21 April 2020, nine people were killed.

Christine admits to Maria that she is not particularly religious but that she has been on several pilgrimages as it affords her the possibility of travelling. Maria develops a crush on Kuno one of the guards assigned to care for the group. He is, in turn, attentive to Christine. When Maria notices this she abandons her duties and runs off leaving Christine in the care of her roommate who is more mobile than her. That day Christine is able to move her hand on her own. As the group prepares to return home, the head helper Miss C√©cile, abruptly collapses while preparing for the final party. The following day, when Maria comes into her room to dress her for the day she finds Christine already dressed. The other members of the group are stunned by Christine's marked improvement and encourage her to have it officially recognized by the church. She is seen by a doctor who verifies that, while she still struggles to walk, her ability to do so is outside the realm of what can be explained scientifically and tells her her case will be moved to a committee who will determine whether it is a miracle or not. Christine is able to attend the last day excursion, which Maria tries to block her from as it was a hike available to the most well members of their group. On the trip other members wonder why Christine was miraculously cured while other, more pious people were not. Christine is oblivious to this and spends some alone time with Kuno. At the going away party Christine dances with Kuno and then collapses. Though Christine recovers others begin to doubt that she is cured. Standing on the sidelines she initially refuses to sit down. Eventually she reluctantly sits back in her wheelchair.

Initially based in Enfield, North London, and moved to Harlow Essex in 1959. At this time STC was part of ITT. It is now recognised as the birthplace of optical fibre communications, for it is here that Sir Charles K. Kao, George Hockham and others pioneered the use of single-mode optical fibre made from low loss glass. In 2009 Charles Kao was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics, for pioneering optical fibre communication. Another famous name associated with STL is Alec Reeves, previously famous for inventing pulse-code modulation while working at the Paris labs of the parent company ITT in 1938, and for his invention of the wartime bomber navigation system OBOE. Alec headed a team working on various means of optical communication, prior to the emergence of glass optical fibre as the leading contender. In 1991, the laboratories became a part of Bell Northern Research (BNR), following the acquisition of STC by Northern Telecom, which later became Nortel. Nortel subsequently encountered financial difficulties, and was broken up and sold off. The last remnants of the laboratories at the Harlow, Essex site, have now disappeared. Since the collapse of Nortel, the site has been redeveloped into a new high-technology business development called KAOPARK.

Ninth in a series of 11 films made between 1939 and 1944 about the Aldrich family and their irrepressible teenage son, Henry, played by Jimmy Lydon, it also stars Charles Smith, John Litel, Olive Blakeney, Joan Mortimer, David Holt, and Minor Watson. The film was released on January 13, 1944, by Paramount Pictures. Plot Henry Aldrich (Jimmy Lydon), the Senior Patrol Leader of his Boy Scout troop, aspires to be promoted to Junior Assistant Scoutmaster to impress his budding love interest, Elise Towers. Henry is anxious for his troop to excel at an upcoming council camporee competition to earn the coveted promotion. Meanwhile, Henry's father, Sam, invites Ramsey Kent, an old college chum and prosperous industrialist, to visit his town in hopes of convincing him to locate a new manufacturing plant there. En route to the Aldrich's house for dinner, Kent's car breaks down on a desolate road. Henry and his Boy Scout troop come to Kent's aid by giving the car a push. Impressed by Henry's helpfulness, Kent decides that Scouting would be a good influence on his spoiled brat of a son, Peter (Darryl Hickman). Compelled to join Henry's troop, Peter initially scoffs at the other Scouts as a \\"bunch of pantywaists\\" and antagonizes everyone by shirking his duties and playing a number of pranks to sabotage Henry's troop at the camporee. He even feigns a sprained ankle while hiking, to get the other Scouts to carry him on an improvised stretcher. After he is challenged to a fistfight by a Scout he has taunted and is roughed up off-screen, a reformed Peter strives to win acceptance by his fellows and help his troop win the competition. Having learned the meaning of Scout's honor the hard way, he begins to appreciate Henry's standing up for him when no one else wanted him around. Irwin Barrett (David Holt), the unscrupulous Senior Patrol Leader of a rival troop, tampers with a competitor's compass to ensure his troop's victory in the camporee orienteering event. When the malfunctioning compass causes a troop to become lost, Henry suspects that Peter is to blame, despite the young Tenderfoot's denials. Even when Peter solemnly declares his innocence of the nefarious deed \\"on Scout's Honor\\", Henry retorts angrily, \\"What would you know of Scout's Honor?\\". Distraught that Henry disbelieves him, Peter runs away that night and stumbles over a cliff in the dark, landing precariously on a narrow ledge where he is eventually rescued from his peril by Henry and Dizzy Stevens. Irwin, realizing that his deceitful actions almost cost Peter his life, confesses that he is to blame and is \\"unworthy to be a Scout\\". At the conclusion of the camporee, Henry's victorious troop marches in review as his beaming parents look on and Elise blows him a kiss. This picture had the official support of the BSA, which supplied a technical advisor to Paramount Pictures during filming for accurate depiction of Scouting details and uniforming.

It was situated in the area between today's suburbs of Hochland Park and Pioneers Park. History Upon the creation of the neighborhood in 1912 by the Windhoek City Council, all Black residents of other areas of the city were moved to the Main Location. A year later, streets were laid out and the separation of Black ethnic groups took place, with each ethnic group forced to live in a different section. Administration of the area was split between Black local residents and White residents from elsewhere. The suburb contained the St Barnabas Anglican Church School, a school that was attended by a number of pupils that later became notable, including Clemens Kapuuo, Sam Nujoma, Mburumba Kerina, Tjama Tjivikua and Kuaima Riruako. The school was destroyed when Old Location was closed for Blacks. Old Location Uprising Background After World War I the League of Nations gave South West Africa, formerly a German colony, to the United Kingdom as a mandate under the title of South Africa. When the National Party won the 1948 election in South Africa and subsequently introduced apartheid legislation, these laws also extended into South West Africa which was the de facto fifth province of South Africa. During the 1950s, the Windhoek municipality and the South African colonial administration decided to forcefully move the residents of the Main Location to the north of the city, prompting the evicted people to give the new location the name Katutura (). For a number of reasons most residents did not want to move: They had owned the erven in Old Location whereas in Katutura all land belonged to the municipality. The newly allocated erven were also a lot smaller than those in Old Location, effectively forbidding the creation of gardens. Also economically black residents were worse off after the move because they now had to pay rent to the municipality, and they needed a bus to reach their work places in town‚ÄîOld Location had been in walking distance. Events on 10 December 1959 The newly established SWANU party, in one of their first mass actions, organised the protest of the inhabitants which came to a head in December 1959. Following protests and an effective boycott of municipal services by Main Location residents, the police opened fire on the protesters, killing 11 and wounding 44 others. Doctors at the hospitals in Windhoek refused to treat the wounded, telling them to \\"go to the United Nations for treatment because these people ... [are] political patients\\". Although this claim is backed by many eyewitnesses, among them Sam Nujoma, Namibia's founding president who references the incident in his autobiography Where Others Wavered, it has not been unchallenged. Hannes Smith caused a controversy in 2003, calling it a \\"gross lie\\".Nujoma's war of words with editor in the Mail & Guardian, 30 August 2003 3,000-4,000 residents fled the area and refused to return, fearing police reprisals. The Old Location Uprising, as it came to be known, was a rallying cry for Namibian independence until the country received independence in March 1990, 31 years later.History of Old Location and Katutura NamibWeb.comForced Removal from Old Location Vantaa.fi It was one of the events leading to the foundation of SWAPOPeter N.

It is also probably one of the main reasons for SWAPO to put less effort into petitioning and resistance, and to turn the independence struggle into an armed conflict. The Old Location uprising is the reason for the declaration of December 10, Human Rights Day, as a Namibian national holiday. Transfer to Katutura The transfer to the Katutura suburb took several years. In 1962, approximately 7,000 people had been moved, joining the 2,000 people of Ovambo descent that already lived there. In 1968, the Old Location was officially closed and whites began to settle.

Early life John Gibson was born in Brighton on 24 August 1916, the only child of Violet Lilian (n√©e Wells) and Axel Charles von Wichmann, later Wickman (the Coventry machine tool manufacturer A.C. Wickman, 1894‚Äì1970) of Brighton and Hove. In 1920 he moved with his mother's family to New Zealand, where she married James Gibson. John was educated in Auckland and at New Plymouth Boy's High School. He returned to the United Kingdom in 1938, where he began a short service commission in the Royal Air Force. He was commissioned as an acting pilot officer on probation on 9 July 1938. His commission was confirmed on 16 August 1939, just a few weeks before the UK entered the Second World War in September 1939. Second World War In May 1940, as France was invaded by Nazi Germany, Gibson was posted to No. 501 (County of Gloucester) Squadron, Royal Auxiliary Air Force, and his squadron was dispatched from RAF Tangmere across the English Channel to B√©theniville. The squadron flew Hawker Hurricanes, which Gibson had not flown before, and on 27 May he scored his first kill when he destroyed a Heinkel 111 bomber, and shared in another kill, before being shot down and landing close to Rouen. He was again shot down on 10 June over Le Mans, and a week later his squadron withdrew to Jersey and then regrouped at Croydon Airport. On 29 August after shooting down a Me 109, he was rescued from the English Channel after his aircraft was shot down and he parachuted to safety. The next day he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. The citation read: He was promoted flying officer on 3 September 1940, and later in the month he was wounded and hospitalised. In May 1941, Gibson was posted as an air firing instructor, and returned to flying as a flight commander with No. 457 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force. On 3 September 1941 he was promoted to war substantive flight lieutenant. In May 1942, the squadron moved to Australia and Gibson was posted to New Zealand with the Royal New Zealand Air Force. He joined No. 15 Squadron and went to Tonga and flew Kittyhawks as a flight commander. Gibson returned to New Zealand in December 1942 and attended a course at the Staff College in April 1943. In December 1943, he rejoined No. 15 Squadron at New Georgia in the Solomon Islands as Commanding Officer. He was confirmed as a temporary squadron leader on 1 July 1944. On 16 March 1945 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. He returned to Europe and joined No. 80 Squadron flying the Hawker Tempest, and was again shot down and injured in March 1945. After recovering, he formally transferred to the RNZAF on 1 December 1945. However, he soon returned to RAF service, and served successively as pilot and aide to Bernard Montgomery and Arthur Tedder. He resigned his commission in 1950, but returned to the RAF in 1952, initially reverting to the rank of flight lieutenant. He was promoted to squadron leader again on 1 January 1953. He finally retired from the RAF on 31 December 1954. Airline pilot and later life In the 1960s, Gibson formed Bechuanaland National Airways and Botswana National Airways. Beginning with a Douglas DC-3, he expanded the airlines until they operated two DC-3s, two Douglas DC-4s, and a presidential aircraft for Batswana President Seretse Khama. During the Biafran War, Gibson was operating from Gabon, and with his son Michael as co-pilot, he flew in supplies and helped to evacuate children. He later formed a charter airline Jagair, based at Kariba Dam, Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and after ceasing operations due to political difficulties, he was employed by his friend and fellow wartime Royal Air Force pilot, Ian Smith, the Prime Minister of Rhodesia, as an aviation operations officer. Gibson retired in 1982, and returned to the United Kingdom in 1987 where he settled in Nottingham. He died on 1 July 2000.

He was the Archdeacon of Chester from 2002 to 2010 and on 5 November 2009 was nominated as the next Bishop of Peterborough. He was installed on 17 April 2010. Allister served in parish positions in Hyde, Greater Manchester; Sevenoaks, Kent; Birkenhead, Merseyside and Cheadle, Greater Manchester. While at Sevenoaks he also served as a consultant editor of the Church of England Newspaper and in Birkenhead he was also a part-time hospital chaplain. He has been a member of the General Synod of the Church of England since 2005 and was on the committee which drafted proposed legislation regarding the consecration of women as bishops. He is also a member of the Council for Christian Unity. In 2001 Allister attracted media attention after it was reported that he had refused to allow a couple to have the hymns \\"Jerusalem\\" and \\"I Vow to Thee, My Country\\" at their wedding. He has also spoken out about baptising the children of unmarried couples and also on sex outside of marriage more generally. Early life Allister was born in Liverpool, Lancashire (before Merseyside was created) in 1952, Donald Allister at Burke's Peerage the son of a manager in the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company and a nursing sister. The family soon moved across the Mersey to Birkenhead on the Wirral peninsula. Later they moved to Bromley, Kent, before returning to the Wirral when they settled in Heswall, before finally returning to Birkenhead where he attended Birkenhead School. In his childhood he was a choirboy at several churches and also an altar server for his uncle from whom comes his middle name of Spargo. Allister then went up to Peterhouse, Cambridge to study medicine, later changing to theology. After graduation, he undertook further theological studies at Trinity College, Bristol. Ministry He was made a deacon at Petertide 1976 (27 June) and ordained a priest the next Petertide (26 June 1977), both times by Victor Whitsey, Bishop of Chester, at Chester Cathedral. After ordination Allister served as a curate at St George's Church, Hyde from 1976 to 1979 and at St Nicholas' Church, Sevenoaks from 1979 to 1983. During this period he was also a consultant editor of the Church of England Newspaper. He was then appointed vicar of Christ Church, Birkenhead in 1983, also working as a part-time hospital chaplain. In 1989 Allister became rector of St Mary's Church, Cheadle, and took on the additional position of rural dean of the Cheadle deanery in 1999. In 2001 he received media coverage when it was reported that he had refused to allow a couple to have the hymns \\"Jerusalem\\" and \\"I Vow to Thee, My Country\\" sung at their wedding. He later said: He had previously also refused to baptise the children of unmarried parents and condemned sex outside marriage. In 1993. he wrote \\"Liberalism is one of Satan‚Äôs greatest weapons against the church.\\" He attributed the fire at York Minster in 1994, the fire at Windsor Castle in 1992, and \\"the disastrous royal marriage saga of last year\\" (a reference to the separation of Charles, Prince of Wales from Diana, Princess of Wales in 1992), to the judgment of God. However, when his appointment as Bishop of Peterborough was announced in 2009, he said on the diocesan website that \\"his views have changed over the years and that, like all Christians, he is on a faith-journey\\". In 2002 Allister was appointed as the Archdeacon of Chester. In this position he has also chaired the diocesan committees on education, houses and glebe. He also acted as the bishop's adviser on healthcare chaplaincy. He became a member of General Synod in 2005 and was appointed to the commission drafting legislation relating to the possible consecration of women as bishops in 2006, serving until it delivered its proposals in 2008. On 5 November 2009 it was announced from 10 Downing Street that Allister had been nominated as the next Bishop of Peterborough. The see had become vacant with the death of Ian Cundy in May 2009. The announcement was followed by a press conference in Peterborough. The Cong√© d'Elire officially authorising his election as bishop was issued by Elizabeth II on 1 December 2009. He was consecrated as a bishop in St Paul's Cathedral on 25 March 2010 and was enthroned as Bishop of Peterborough in Peterborough Cathedral on 17 April 2010. On 4 November 2011, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in theology by the University of Chester \\"in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the promotion of Christian education\\".

It was the successor to Cassell's Illustrated Family Paper, (1853‚Äì1867) becoming Cassell's Family Magazine in 1874, Cassell's Magazine in 1897, and, after 1912, Cassell's Magazine of Fiction. The magazine was edited by H. G. Bonavia Hunt from 1874 to 1896, Max Pemberton from 1896 to 1905, David Williamson from 1905 to November 1908, Walter Smith from December 1908 to 1912, and Newman Flower from 1912 to 1922. It was acquired by the Amalgamated Press in 1927 and merged with Storyteller in 1932. In the 1890s, under Pemberton's editorship, the magazine was based on the Strand Magazine, attempting to be a competitor to that periodical. Contributing authors included Wilkie Collins, whose 1870 novel Man and Wife raised the magazine's circulation to 70,000. Following the success of George Newnes's Tit-Bits, the Strand Magazine and Alfred Harmsworth's Answers, Cassell's began publishing a combination of journalistic miscellanea and illustrated fiction by popular novelists such as Robert Louis Stevenson, Arthur Quiller-Couch, Sheridan Le Fanu, J. M. Barrie, P. G. Wodehouse, Marjorie Bowen, and Warwick Deeping. The Examiner,Launceston, Tasmania, 6 January, 1917, (p. 8). Other contributors were E. W.

In January 1908 he instructed his agent, 'Please secure the number' (CL 4:31), suggesting that Conrad was interested in seeing its illustrated publication in one of the most popular magazines of that time. In 1912, under Flower's editorship, Cassell's became a \\"pulp\\" magazine, printed on wood pulp paper and aiming at a more populist type of fiction.Ashley, Michael (2006).

The group has played at The Bamboozle 2007, The Bamboozle Left 2009, The Bamboozle 2009, The 2010 Take Action Tour, The Bamboozle Roadshow 2010, released two EPs and an album, Stuck On Repeat on July 20, 2010, on Columbia Records. History 2006-07: Formation and The Worst Case Scenario EP In 2006, Matt Villani left the Pop Punk group, Valet Parking to form a new band, called Stereo Skyline. Villani initially played piano and synth and sang lead vocals for the band. He recruited Jay Marotta and Anthony Purpura of his former band, Aerosol, to play guitar and bass guitar, respectively, Dane Drozdzewicz to play drums and Eddie Dizura of Suddenly October to play guitar. Soon after the formation of the first line- up, Drozdzewicz left the band and was temporarily replaced by Chris Capuano of Valet Parking/Set In Color until Purpura was moved to drums. Tom Angenbroich of Don't Fall Darling was recruited to play bass guitar and scream. Dizura also left and was replaced by his Suddenly October bandmate, Kevin Bard, who was recruited to play guitar and sing backup vocals. This remained the line-up for their first EP, The Worst Case Scenario. The Worst Case Scenario was recorded by the producer Nick Zinnanti in his Bethpage, New York, studio and was released in 2006. The band toured around Long Island to promote its release. In 2007, the band underwent a major line-up change. Bard became the lead vocalist. Villani became the backing vocalist, continued on piano, and picked up guitar. Purpura switched to playing synthesizer, and Rob Michelsen joined the band to play drums. The band played at The Bamboozle for the first time that year. 2007-08: Major changes and Stereo Skyline EP Shortly after their performance at Bamboozle, the band took on the manager Jason Aron of Ozone Management (Boys Like Girls, Hey Monday, We the Kings). Aron wanted to take the band in another direction which resulted in the departure of Angenbroich and Purpura in summer 2007. As a result, Marotta switched to bass guitar and Bard maintained his role as lead singer, but also picked up guitar. The new line-up recorded and released a demo that summer. In winter and spring 2008, the band recorded an EP called Stereo Skyline at Stadiumred in Harlem, New York. It was released in July 2008. The artwork for the EP was created by Alexander Sheldon of Match & Kerosene and was edited into its final state by Russell Heiman of Nice Guys Finish First. 2008-09: Departure of Villani and signing to Columbia Records In September 2008, after numerous conflicts with the band, Villani was fired. He formed Set In Colour immediately after his departure with Angenbroich and Purpura, former Stereo Skyline members, along with Kenny Gallart on drums. The band continued with Bard as its new leader and recruited Brian Maddox of Scenes and Sirens to replace Villani on guitar. In November 2008, Marotta left the band for undisclosed reasons, and Maddox switched to bass guitar. In January 2009, the band signed a publishing deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing. In February 2009, the band was taken on by the Paradigm Booking Agency. In June 2009, the band had signed a record deal with Columbia Records. In September 2009, the band played a string of shows with Mitchel Musso and are referred to many times in the video for \\"Shout It\\" which was shot primarily at the September 9, 2009, show they played with Musso, KSM and Jimmy Robbins at the House of Blues in Boston, Massachusetts. In the video, Musso wears a Stereo Skyline bracelet. 2010: Gaining exposure and Stuck on Repeat The band was featured in Alternative Press magazine as one of its \\"100 Bands You Need to Know\\" for 2010. On April 26, 2010, after being the touring guitarist since January 2010, Clayton Johnson, formerly of A Bird A Sparrow and IT BOYS!, officially joined Stereo Skyline as its permanent guitarist and backing vocalist. \\\\- The band appeared on the MTV show Silent Library with Hey Monday. The band's album, Stuck On Repeat, was released on July 20, 2010. It was produced by Blake Healy (formerly of Metro Station) and includes production and songwriting work by S*A*M and Sluggo and Adam Schlesinger. The band went on its first headlining tour to promote the album with The Audition, Cash Cash, The Downtown Fiction and Cady Groves for support from July 28 to August 21. On November 1, 2010, the band performed live for Good Day New York. 2011: Departure of Maddox and Johnson and The Good Life In spring 2011, Stereo Skyline set out on \\"Tourantula!\\" supporting Family Force 5. Their song \\"Uptown, Get Around\\" was played at the beginning of The Suite Life Movie. On May 21, 2011, Johnson and Maddox announced that they had left Stereo Skyline to \\"explore other adventures in music and create a 'secret' project together\\".

The village is a traditional Chukchi and Yupik settlement in an area that has been inhabited for centuries. Whilst the village still exists, in 2010, a law was passed abolishing the municipal rural settlement of Nutepelmen, meaning that administration responsibilities passed to the central district administration. Geography The village, population 135, as of 2006:,Strogoff, p.127 is formed mainly of Chukchi people, and is located on a spit at the entrance to Pyngopylkhyn Lagoon (from the Chukchi, Pynopelgyn, lit. \\"sucking orifice\\"). Kolyuchin Island is found to the north east of the village. History Early history Further along the coast, near the village, a stone circle can be found, dating from the sixteenth to seventeenth century when the Chukchi fought battles with the Cossack explorers. The skeletons of those killed in the battle can still be found on the surrounding tundra and the local Chukchi population regard the area as cursed. As well as the stone circle, on the eastern shore of Kolyuchinskaya Bay is the ancient Inuit village of Anayan (inhabitants transferred to Neshkan in the 1950s by Soviet authorities), where ruined houses still stand. the name of the village is derived from the Chukchi, meaning \\"Land in the Mist\\".V.V.

They were commissioned by Pope Sixtus V and built at the direction of Muzio Mattei, and were installed between 1588 and 1593. The figure of one fountain is said to represent the River Tiber, in front of an oak-tree; a she-wolf, the symbol of Rome, was a later addition. A second fountain represents the River Aniene, a tributary of the Tiber, called Anio in ancient Rome, which provided most Roman aqueducts with water. Pope Sixtus proposed to build a canal to bring the water of the Aniene to Rome. The other two fountains feature female figures believed to represent the Goddess Diana; the symbol of Chastity; and the Goddess Juno, the symbol of Strength, but it is possible that they may also represent rivers. The fountains of the Aniene, Tiber, and Juno are the work of Domenico Fontana. The fountain of Diana was designed by the painter and architect Pietro da Cortona. The later Baroque church of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane, by Francesco Borromini, is located near the fountains, and takes its name from them. Until 1964 the Via Quattro Fontane was home to the Pontifical Scots College.

It is a classical long period variable star that has been well observed for over 120 years. Discovery U Orionis in the center of the image at approx visual mag. 12 on February 5th 2017 It was discovered on 1885 December 13 by J.E. Gore and initially it was thought to be a nova in the early stages of decline (Gore's Nova and NOVA Ori 1885 as still listed in SIMBAD), but a spectrum taken at Harvard showed features similar to that of Mira. Thus U Orionis became the first long period variable to be identified by a photograph of its spectrum. Location U Orionis lies less than half a degree east of the small-amplitude variable star œá1 Orionis and less than an arc-minute from the much fainter eclipsing variable UW Orionis. œá1 Orionis is slightly brighter than U Orionis at its brightest maximum, while UW Orionis is more than a thousand times fainter, similar to U Orionis at minimum. Stellar parameters The star has a low effective temperature (roughly 2700 K) but a large and bloated radius of 370 solar radii and a high luminosity, 7,000 times higher than the Sun. If the Sun were replaced with U Orionis, its radius would extend beyond Mars's orbital zone (about 1.7 astronomical units), and, to be habitable with water at liquid state and a comfortable temperature, a planet would have to be located within 85 AU, within the Kuiper belt's orbital zone. Possible planetary system According to Rudnitskij, a 12- to 15-year \\"super-periodicity\\" has been observed. The author infers such periodicity could coincide with the revolution period of an invisible companion, probably planetary. So far no clear hint of planetary objects has been detected.

Corvette grew up in Detroit, Michigan. She was always fascinated with music, and at 16 ran away from home because her mother refused to allow her to attend an MC5 concert. In late 1977 or early 1978, a friend of hers arranged for Nikki to headline a concert at a bar. At the time, she was not a member of a band, and she spent the next few weeks organizing Nikki and the Corvettes. The new band had never rehearsed, and played together for the first time at the concert. Originally, they played mainly cover songs as well as a few original songs written by Corvette and her former boyfriend Peter James, who had played with The Romantics. The Corvettes were signed by Bomp! Records and released an album, Nikki and the Corvettes in 1980. Mike Miliard of the Boston Phoenix described the album as \\"power pop perfection\\" which \\"[split] the difference between the Ronettes and the Ramones\\". Adrian Mack of The Georgia Straight describes Corvette's early work as a \\"brief, if beautiful, career belting out innocently snotty bubblegum punk with the gutter-budget girl group Nikki and the Corvettes. Their solitary, highly prized 1980 album is still launching new bands and teenage-misfit boners, though Corvette herself didn't realize its impact until a reissue in 2000.\\" Nikki and the Corvettes disbanded in 1981. At this time, it was still unusual to have a woman front a rock band. The notoriety that Nikki Corvette earned for her role in breaking those barriers led to her being namechecked in the song \\"Gimme My Radio\\" by The Donnas. Corvette returned to music in 2003, forming a new band called Nikki and the Stingrays. Corvette described the new band as \\"the next progression of the Corvettes. It's got the same quality to some of it, but I grew up a little bit. Which is good, since it's only what, 27 years later?\\" The Stingrays released an album, Back to Detroit on Dollar Records. After the release of this album, Corvette moved back to Detroit, where she became friends with Amy Gore of the Gore Gore Girls. The two wrote several songs together, with Corvette providing the lyrics and Gore the music. In 2009 they formed the band Gorevette. Gorvette performed a fall 2010 tour opening for bands including Blondie and The Donnas. In 2012, she appeared at the \\"Girls Got Rhythm\\" fest in St. Paul, MN alongside artists such as Ronnie Spector, The Muffs, The 5.6.7.8's and L'Assassins.

Statistics is both a formal science and a practical theory of scientific inquiry, and both aspects are considered in statistics education. Education in statistics has similar concerns as does education in other mathematical sciences, like logic, mathematics, and computer science. At the same time, statistics is concerned with evidence-based reasoning, particularly with the analysis of data. Therefore, education in statistics has strong similarities to education in empirical disciplines like psychology and chemistry, in which education is closely tied to \\"hands-on\\" experimentation. Mathematicians and statisticians often work in a department of mathematical sciences (particularly at colleges and small universities). Statistics courses have been sometimes taught by non- statisticians, against the recommendations of some professional organizations of statisticians and of mathematicians. Statistics education research is an emerging field that grew out of different disciplines and is currently establishing itself as a unique field that is devoted to the improvement of teaching and learning statistics at all educational levels. Goals of statistics education Statistics educators have cognitive and noncognitive goals for students. For example, former American Statistical Association (ASA) President Katherine Wallman defined statistical literacy as including the cognitive abilities of understanding and critically evaluating statistical results as well as appreciating the contributions statistical thinking can make. Cognitive goals In the text rising from the 2008 joint conference of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction and the International Association of Statistics Educators, editors Carmen Batanero, Gail Burrill, and Chris Reading (Universidad de Granada, Spain, Michigan State University, USA, and University of New England, Australia, respectively) note worldwide trends in curricula which reflect data-oriented goals. In particular, educators currently seek to have students: \\"design investigations; formulate research questions; collect data using observations, surveys, and experiments; describe and compare data sets; and propose and justify conclusions and predictions based on data.\\" The authors note the importance of developing statistical thinking and reasoning in addition to statistical knowledge. Despite the fact that cognitive goals for statistics education increasingly focus on statistical literacy, statistical reasoning, and statistical thinking rather than on skills, computations and procedures alone, there is no agreement about what these terms mean or how to assess these outcomes. A first attempt to define and distinguish between these three terms appears in the ARTIST website which was created by Garfield, delMas and Chance and has since been included in several publications.Garfield, J., & Ben-Zvi, D. (2008). Developing students' statistical reasoning: Connecting research and teaching practice. Springer.Garfield, J., & Ben-Zvi, D. (2008). Preparing school teachers to develop students' statistical reasoning. In C. Batanero, G. Burrill, C. Reading, & A. Rossman. Teaching Statistics in School Mathematics- Challenges for Teaching and Teacher Education: A Joint ICMI/IASE Study: The 18th ICMI Study. 299‚Äì310. Dordrecht: Springer. Brief definitions of these terms are as follows: # Statistical literacy is being able to read and use basic statistical language and graphical representations to understand statistical information in the media and in daily life. # Statistical reasoning is being able to reason about and connect different statistical concepts and ideas, such as knowing how and why outliers affect statistical measures of center and variability. # Statistical thinking is the type of thinking used by statisticians when they encounter a statistical problem. This involves thinking about the nature and quality of the data and, where the data came from, choosing appropriate analyses and models, and interpreting the results in the context of the problem and given the constraints of the data. Further cognitive goals of statistics education vary across students' educational level and the contexts in which they expect to encounter statistics. Statisticians have proposed what they consider the most important statistical concepts for educated citizens. For example, Utts (2003) published seven areas of what every educated citizen should know, including understanding that \\"variability is normal\\" and how \\"coincidences‚Ä¶ are not uncommon because there are so many possibilities.\\" Gal (2002) suggests adults in industrialized societies are expected to exercise statistical literacy, \\"the ability to interpret and critically evaluate statistical information‚Ä¶ in diverse contexts, and the ability to‚Ä¶ communicate understandings and concerns regarding the‚Ä¶ conclusions.\\" Non-cognitive goals Non-cognitive outcomes include affective constructs such as attitudes, beliefs, emotions, dispositions, and motivation. According to prominent researchers Gal & Ginsburg, statistics educators should make it a priority to be aware of students' ideas, reactions, and feelings towards statistics and how these affect their learning. =Beliefs= Beliefs are defined as one's individually held ideas about statistics, about oneself as a learner of statistics, and about the social context of learning statistics. Beliefs are distinct from attitudes in the sense that attitudes are relatively stable and intense feelings that develop over time in the context of experiences learning statistics. Students' web of beliefs provides a context for their approach towards their classroom experiences in statistics. Many students enter a statistics course with apprehension towards learning the subject, which works against the learning environment that the instructor is trying to accomplish. Therefore, it is important for instructors to have access to assessment instruments that can give an initial diagnosis of student beliefs and monitor beliefs during a course. Frequently, assessment instruments have monitored beliefs and attitudes together. For examples of such instruments, see the attitudes section below. =Dispositions= Disposition has to do with the ways students question the data and approach a statistical problem. Dispositions is one of the four dimensions in Wild and Pfannkuch's framework for statistical thinking, and contains the following elements: *Curiosity and Awareness: These traits are a part of the process of generating questions and generating ideas to explore and analyze data. *Engagement: Students will be most observant and aware in the areas they find most interesting. *Imagination: This trait is important for viewing a problem from different perspectives and coming up with possible explanations. *Scepticism: Critical thinking is important for receiving new ideas and information and evaluating the appropriateness of study design and analysis. *Being logical: The ability to detect when one idea follows from another is important for arriving at valid conclusions. *A propensity to seek deeper meaning: This means not taking everything at face value and being open to consider new ideas and dig deeper for information. Scheaffer states that a goal of statistics education is to have students see statistics broadly. He developed a list of views of statistics that can lead to this broad view, and describes them as follows: > *Statistics as number sense: Do I understand what the numbers mean? (seeing > data as numbers in context, reading charts, graphs and tables, understanding > numerical and graphical summaries of data, etc.) *Statistics as a way of > understanding the world: Can I use existing data to help make decisions? > (using census data, birth and death rates, disease rates, CPI, ratings, > rankings, etc., to describe, decide and defend) *Statistics as organized > problem solving: Can I design and carry out a study to answer specific > questions? (pose problem, collect data according to a plan, analyze data, > and draw conclusions from data) =Attitudes= Since students often experience math anxiety and negative opinions about statistics courses, various researchers have addressed attitudes and anxiety towards statistics. Some instruments have been developed to measure college students' attitudes towards statistics, and have been shown to have appropriate psychometric properties. Examples of such instruments include: *Survey of Attitudes Towards Statistics (SATS), developed by Schau, Stevens, Dauphinee, and Del Vecchio *Attitude Toward Statistics Scale, developed by Wise *Statistics Attitude Survey (SAS), developed by Roberts and Bilderback Careful use of instruments such as these can help statistics instructors to learn about students' perception of statistics, including their anxiety towards learning statistics, the perceived difficulty of learning statistics, and their perceived usefulness of the subject. Some studies have shown modest success at improving student attitudes in individual courses, but no generalizable studies showing improvement in student attitudes have been seen. Nevertheless, one of the goals of statistics education is to make the study of statistics a positive experience for students and to bring in interesting and engaging examples and data that will motivate students. According to a fairly recent literature review, improved student attitudes towards statistics can lead to better motivation and engagement, which also improves cognitive learning outcomes. Primary‚Äìsecondary education level New Zealand In New Zealand, a new curriculum for statistics has been developed by Chris Wild and colleagues at Auckland University. Rejecting the contrived, and now unnecessary due to computer power, approach of reasoning under the null and the restrictions of normal theory, they use comparative box plots and bootstrap to introduce concepts of sampling variability and inference. The developing curriculum also contains aspects of statistical literacy. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, at least some statistics has been taught in schools since the 1930s. At present, A-level qualifications (typically taken by 17-18-year olds) are being developed in \\"Statistics\\" and \\"Further Statistics\\". The coverage of the former includes: Probability; Data Collection; Descriptive Statistics; Discrete Probability Distributions; Binomial Distribution; Poisson Distributions; Continuous Probability Distributions; The Normal Distribution; Estimation; Hypothesis Testing; Chi- Squared; Correlation and Regression. The coverage of \\"Further Statistics\\" includes: Continuous Probability Distributions; Estimation; Hypothesis Testing; One Sample Tests; Hypothesis Testing; Two Sample Tests; Goodness of Fit Tests; Experimental Design; Analysis of Variance (Anova); Statistical Process Control; Acceptance Sampling. The Centre for Innovation in Mathematics Teaching (CIMT) has online course notes for these sets of topics.CIMT A-level course notes Revision notes for an existing qualificationmathsrevision.net A-level notes indicate a similar coverage. At an earlier age (typically 15‚Äì16 years) GCSE qualifications in mathematics contain \\"Statistics and Probability\\" topics on: Probability; Averages; Standard Deviation; Sampling; Cumumulative Frequency Graphs (including median and quantiles); Representing Data; Histograms.matherevision.net GCSE maths notes The UK's Office for National Statistics has a webpageONS stats4schools teacher/student resources leading to material suitable for both teachers and students at school level. In 2004 the Smith inquiry made the following statement: > \\"There is much concern and debate about the positioning of Statistics and > Data Handling within the current mathematics GCSE, where it occupies some 25 > per cent of the timetable allocation. On the one hand, there is widespread > agreement that the Key Stage 4 curriculum is over-crowded and that the > introduction of Statistics and Data Handling may have been at the expense of > time needed for practising and acquiring fluency in core mathematical > manipulations. Many in higher education mathematics and engineering > departments take this view. On the other hand, there is overwhelming > recognition, shared by the Inquiry, of the vital importance of Statistics > and Data Handling skills both for a number of other academic disciplines and > in the workplace. The Inquiry recommends that there be a radical re-look at > this issue and that much of the teaching and learning of Statistics and Data > Handling would be better removed from the mathematics timetable and > integrated with the teaching and learning of other disciplines (e.g. biology > or geography). The time restored to the mathematics timetable should be used > for acquiring greater mastery of core mathematical concepts and operations.\\" United States In the United States, schooling has increased the use of probability and statistics, especially since the 1990s.In the United States, there was a \\"wide growth of statistical training in grades K-12, led by the implementation of an Advanced Placement (AP) course in statistics.\\" p. 403 in Summary statistics and graphs are taught in elementary school in many states. Topics in probability and statistical reasoning are taught in high school algebra (or mathematical science) courses; statistical reasoning has been examined in the SAT test since 1994. The College Board has developed an Advanced Placement course in statistics, which has provided a college-level course in statistics to hundreds of thousands of high school students, with the first examination happening in May 1997.Page 403 in In 2007, the ASA endorsed the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE), a two-dimensional framework for the conceptual understanding of statistics in Pre-K-12 students. The framework contains learning objectives for students at each conceptual level and provides pedagogical examples that are consistent with the conceptual levels.

University level General Statistics is often taught in departments of mathematics or in departments of mathematical sciences. At the undergraduate level, statistics is often taught as a service course. =United Kingdom= By tradition in the U.K., most professional statisticians are trained at the Master level. A difficulty of recruiting strong undergraduates has been noted: \\"Very few undergraduates positively choose to study statistics degrees; most choose some statistics options within a mathematics programme, often to avoid the advanced pure and applied mathematics courses. My view is that statistics as a theoretical discipline is better taught late rather than early, whereas statistics as part of scientific methodology should be taught as part of science.\\" In the United Kingdom, the teaching of statistics at university level was originally done within science departments that needed the topic to accompany the teaching of their own subjects, and departments of mathematics had limited coverage before the 1930s. For the twenty years subsequent to this, while departments of mathematics had started to teach statistics, there was little realisation that essentially the same basic statistical methodology was being applied across a variety of sciences. Statistical departments have had difficulty when they have been separated from mathematics departments. Psychologist Andy Field (British Psychological Society Teaching and Book Award) created a new concept of statistical teaching and textbooks that goes beyond the printed page. SAGE Strikes Gold with Andy Field‚Äôs New Statistics Textbook/Ebook ‚Äì Nancy K. Herther 2013 =United States= Enrollments in statistics have increased in community colleges, in four-year colleges and universities in the United States. At community colleges in the United States, mathematics has experienced increased enrollment since 1990. At community colleges, the ratio of the students enrolled in statistics to those enrolled in calculus rose from 56% in 1990 to 82% in 1995.Page 616 in One of the ASA-endorsed GAISE reports focused on statistics education at the introductory college level. The report includes a brief history of the introductory statistics course and recommendations for how it should be taught. In many colleges, a basic course in \\"statistics for non-statisticians\\" has required only algebra (and not calculus); for future statisticians, in contrast, the undergraduate exposure to statistics is highly mathematical.\\"Undergraduate major programs should include study of probability and statistical theory, along with the prerequisite mathematics, especially calculus and linear algebra. Programs for nonmajors may require less study of mathematics. Programs preparing for graduate work may require additional mathematics.\\" As undergraduates, future statisticians should have completed courses in multivariate calculus, linear algebra, computer programming, and a year of calculus-based probability and statistics. Students wanting to obtain a doctorate in statistics from \\"any of the better graduate programs in statistics\\" should also take \\"real analysis\\".Page 622 in Laboratory courses in physics, chemistry and psychology also provide useful experiences with planning and conducting experiments and with analyzing data. The ASA recommends that undergraduate students consider obtaining a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics as preparation for entering a master program in statistics.The ASA makes the following recommendations for undergraduates wishing to become statisticians: \\"Major in applied mathematics, or a closely related field. If you do major in a nonstatistical field, minor in mathematics or statistics. Develop a background in mathematics, science, and computers and gain knowledge in a specific field of interest. A master's degree or PhD is very helpful and often recommended or required for higher-level positions.\\" Historically, professional degrees in statistics have been at the Master level, although some students may qualify to work with a bachelor's degree and job-related experience or further self- study.\\"A master's degree or PhD is very helpful and often recommended or required for higher-level positions.\\" Professional competence requires a background in mathematics‚Äîincluding at least multivariate calculus, linear algebra, and a year of calculus-based probability and statistics. In the United States, a master program in statistics requires courses in probability, mathematical statistics, and applied statistics (e.g., design of experiments, survey sampling, etc.). For a doctoral degree in statistics, it has been traditional that students complete a course in measure-theoretic probability as well as courses in mathematical statistics. Such courses require a good course in real analysis, covering the proofs of the theory of calculus and topics like the uniform convergence of functions. In recent decades, some departments have discussed allowing doctoral students to waive the course in measure-theoretic probability by demonstrating advanced skills in computer programming or scientific computing.Stanford University statistician Persi Diaconis wrote that \\"I see a strong trend against measure theory in modern statistics departments: I had to fight to keep the measure theory requirement in Stanford's statistics graduate program. The fight was lost at Berkeley.\\" Who should teach statistics? The question of what qualities are needed to teach statistics has been much discussed, and sometimes this discussion is concentrated on the qualifications necessary for those undertaking such teaching. The question arises separately for teaching at both school and university levels, partly because of the need for numerically more such teachers at school level and partly because of need for such teachers to cover a broad range of other topics within their overall duties. Given that \\"statistics\\" is often taught to non-scientists, opinions can range all the way from \\"statistics should be taught by statisticians\\", through \\"teaching of statistics is too mathematical\\" to the extreme that \\"statistics should not be taught by statisticians\\". Teaching at university level In the United States especially, statisticians have long complained that many mathematics departments have assigned mathematicians (without statistical competence) to teach statistics courses, effectively giving \\"double blind\\" courses. The principle that college-instructors should have qualifications and engagement with their academic discipline has long been violated in United States colleges and universities, according to generations of statisticians. For example, the journal Statistical Science reprinted \\"classic\\" articles on the teaching of statistics by non-statisticians by Harold Hotelling; Hotelling's articles are followed by the comments of Kenneth J. Arrow, W. Edwards Deming, Ingram Olkin, David S. Moore, James V. Sidek, Shanti S. Gupta, Robert V. Hogg, Ralph A. Bradley, and by Harold Hotelling, Jr. (an economist and son of Harold Hotelling). Data on the teaching of statistics in the United States has been collected on behalf of the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS). Examining data from 2000, Schaeffer and Stasny reported > By far the majority of instructors within statistics departments have at > least a master‚Äôs degree in statistics or biostatistics (about 89% for > doctoral departments and about 79% for master‚Äôs departments). In doctoral > mathematics departments, however, only about 58% of statistics course > instructors had at least a master‚Äôs degree in statistics or biostatistics as > their highest degree earned. In master‚Äôs-level mathematics departments, the > corresponding percentage was near 44%, and in bachelor‚Äôs-level departments > only 19% of statistics course instructors had at least a master‚Äôs degree in > statistics or biostatistics as their highest degree earned. As we expected, > a large majority of instructors in statistics departments (83% for doctoral > departments and 62% for master‚Äôs departments) held doctoral degrees in > either statistics or biostatistics. The comparable percentages for > instructors of statistics in mathematics departments were about 52% and 38%. The principle that statistics-instructors should have statistical competence has been affirmed by the guidelines of the Mathematical Association of America, which has been endorsed by the ASA. The unprofessional teaching of statistics by mathematicians (without qualifications in statistics) has been addressed in many articles. Teaching methods The literature on methods of teaching statistics is closely related to the literature on the teaching of mathematics for two reasons. First, statistics is often taught as part of the mathematics curriculum, by instructors trained in mathematics and working in a mathematics department. Second, statistical theory has often been taught as a mathematical theory rather than as the practical logic of science --- as the science that \\"puts chance to work\\" in Rao's phrase--- and this has entailed an emphasis on formal and manipulative training, such as solving combinatorial problems involving red and green jelly beans. Statisticians have complained that mathematicians are prone to over-emphasize mathematical manipulations and probability theory and under-emphasize questions of experimentation, survey methodology, exploratory data analysis, and statistical inference.Hotelling. Cobb and Moore. In recent decades, there has been an increased emphasis on data analysis and scientific inquiry in statistics education. In the United Kingdom, the Smith inquiry Making Mathematics Count suggests teaching basic statistical concepts as part of the science curriculum, rather than as part of mathematics.Adrian Smith (primary source). T.M.F. Smith et alia. In the United States, the ASA's guidelines for undergraduate statistics specify that introductory statistics should emphasize the scientific methods of data collection, particularly randomized experiments and random samples: further, the first course should review these topics when the theory of \\"statistical inference\\" is studied. Similar recommendations occur for the Advanced Placement (AP) course in Statistics. The ASA and AP guidelines are followed by contemporary textbooks in the US, such as those by Freedman, Purvis & Pisani (Statistics) and by David S. Moore (Introduction to the Practice of Statistics with McCabe and Statistics: Concepts and Controversies with Notz) and by Watkins, Schaeffer & Cobb (Statistics: From Data to Decisions and Statistics in Action). Besides an emphasis on the scientific inquiry in the content of beginning of statistics, there has also been an increase on active learning in the conduct of the statistics classroom.Moore and Cobb. Professional community Associations The International Statistical Institute (ISI) now has one section devoted to education, the International Association for Statistical Education (IASE), which runs the International Conference on Teaching Statistics every four years as well as IASE satellite conferences around ISI and ICMI meetings. The UK established the Royal Statistical Society Centre for Statistics Education and the ASA now also has a Section on Statistical Education, focused mostly on statistics teaching at the elementary and secondary levels. Conferences In addition to the international gatherings of statistics educators at ICOTS every four years, the US hosts a US Conference on Teaching Statistics (USCOTS) every two years and has recently started an Electronic Conference on Teaching Statistics (eCOTS) to alternate with USCOTS. Sessions on statistics education area also offered at many conferences in mathematics educations such as the International Congress on Mathematical Education, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the Conference of the International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education, and the Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia. The annual Joint Statistical Meetings (offered by the ASA and Statistics Canada) offer many sessions and roundtables on statistics education. The International Research Forums on Statistical Reasoning, Thinking, and Literacy offer scientific gatherings every two years and related publications in journals, CD-ROMs and books on research in statistics education. Graduate coursework and programs Only three universities currently offer graduate programs in statistics education: the University of Granada, the University of Minnesota, and the University of Florida. However, graduate students in a variety of disciplines (e.g., mathematics education, psychology, educational psychology) have been finding ways to complete dissertations on topics related to teaching and learning statistics. These dissertations are archived on the IASE web site. Two main courses in statistics education that have been taught in a variety of settings and departments are a course on teaching statistics and a course on statistics education research. See EPSY 8271. An ASA-sponsored workshop has established recommendations for additional graduate programs and courses. Software for learning *Fathom: Dynamic Data Software *TinkerPlots *StatCrunch Trends in Statistics Education Teachers of statistics have been encouraged to explore new directions in curriculum content, pedagogy and assessment. In an influential talk at USCOTS, researcher George Cobb presented an innovative approach to teaching statistics that put simulation, randomization, and bootstrapping techniques at the core of the college-level introductory course, in place of traditional content such as probability theory and the t-test. Several teachers and curriculum developers have been exploring ways to introduce simulation, randomization, and bootstrapping as teaching tools for the secondary and postsecondary levels. Courses such as the University of Minnesota's CATALST, Nathan Tintle and collaborators' Introduction to Statistical Investigations, and the Lock team's Unlocking the Power of Data, are curriculum projects based on Cobb's ideas. Other researchers have been exploring the development of informal inferential reasoning as a way to use these methods to build a better understanding of statistical inference. (8‚Äì22 in PDF.) Another recent direction is addressing the big data sets that are increasingly affecting or being contributed to in our daily lives. Statistician Rob Gould, creator of Data Cycle, The Musical dinner and theatre spectacular, outlines many of these types of data and encourages teachers to find ways to use the data and address issues around big data. According to Gould, curricula focused on big data will address issues of sampling, prediction, visualization, data cleaning, and the underlying processes that generate data, rather than traditionally emphasized methods of making statistical inferences such as hypothesis testing. Driving both of these changes is the increased role of computing in teaching and learning statistics. Some researchers argue that as the use of modeling and simulation increase, and as data sets become larger and more complex, students will need better and more technical computing skills. Projects such as MOSAIC have been creating courses that blend computer science, modeling, and statistics.

Schabel (1998). \\"Effects of orbital decay on satellite-derived lower-tropospheric temperature trends\\", Nature 394.6694, pp. 661-664 Wentz, Frank J., and Matthias C.

The 2011 correction to UAH data is closer to the RSS data but differences remain, for example the Lower Troposphere global average trend since 1979, RSS currently have +0.133K/decade while UAH have 0.140K/decade, while the mid troposphere difference is even more marked at 0.079K/decade and 0.052K/decade respectively. However, in a recent online YouTube video, Dr. Carl Mears, a senior scientist with the team behind the satellite data, explained how he believes his data set needed correction. > I would have to say that the surface data seems that it's more accurate, > because a number of groups analyze the surface data, including some who set > out to prove the other ones wrong, and they all get more or less the same > answer.

An increased awareness of the separate nature of your self stated as context and your actual experience stated as content in the book, can reduce worry and stress on a person which can lead to beneficial health aspects as well. While worrying is a natural emotion for everyone, excessive worrying can interfere with problem-solving and decision-making.Carol Abaya Sandwich Generation: Worry is natural The Sacramento Bee Mar. 24, 2009 The author uses a five-step model approach to guide the reader through learning the skills of acceptance and commitment therapy and applying them to the problem of worry. It starts off by discussing the \\"fight-or-flight\\" response and the normal impulse toward controlling thoughts and feelings. Finally, it guides you in taking actions directed by your values rather than by worry.

Schumacher & Co on Broadway and 22nd Street on Manhattan‚Äôs Ladies‚Äô Mile (now the Ladies' Mile Historic District). With the Gilded Age in full swing, F. Schumacher & Co. became the premier supplier of decorative fabrics for the mansions of the uber wealthy in Newport, New York and Palm Beach; as well as for luxury hotels like the Waldorf-Astoria and the Biltmore Hotel that were sprouting up across the United States at that time. In 1895, the company became a manufacturer by purchasing a domestic fabric mill in Paterson, New Jersey. The Waverly Mill produced woven fabrics for residences, businesses and public buildings, including a satin lampas that Stanford White designed in 1902 for Theodore Roosevelt‚Äôs White House. A modern approach (1925-1945) Pierre Pozier, Schumacher‚Äôs nephew, a visionary in his own right, became Vice President of the company in 1912 as the second generation to enter the family- owned company. In 1925, under Pozier‚Äôs lead, Schumacher took part in the Exposition Internationale des Arts D√©coratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris, an exhibition that advanced the modernity expressed by the Art Deco movement. Pozier is credited for bringing Art Deco fabrics to the United States. In 1930, Pierre Pozier brought on luminary French fashion designer Paul Poiret to create a line of fabrics for Schumacher. It was the first designer fabric collection of its kind and was followed over the next 40 years by collaborations with industrial designer Donald Deskey, interior designer Dorothy Draper, artist and photographer Cecil Beaton, architects Joseph Frank and Frank Lloyd Wright, fashion designers Elsa Schiaparelli and Karl Lagerfeld, illustrators Jeremiah Goodman and Saul Steinberg, and artist Vera Neumann. Many of the patterns in these collections are still available today along with reboot collections with the estates of Vera Neumann and Frank Lloyd Wright released in 2014 and 2018, respectively.  World War II  During World War II, Schumacher‚Äôs Wavery Mill was key to the war efforts; operating 24 hours a day manufacturing material for parachutes, life preservers and other military equipment. Post-war (1945-1970) With the rise of suburban communities and the American housewife, Waverly (a division of Schumacher, which was sold in 2007) marketed directly to the department store consumer and began advertising in print media with the first slogan \\"all three,\\" allowing customers to purchase fabric, wallpaper and carpeting in one place. In 1950, First Lady Bess Truman selected a Vera Neumann-designed fabric from F. Schumacher & Co. to decorate the White House's third floor solarium. In 1956, upon learning that many famous generals in history had been honored with a commemorative toile, Mrs. Eisenhower and decorator Elisabeth Draper devised a design from the buildings, trophies, and motifs that symbolized President Eisenhower‚Äôs life and career. The pattern was even fashioned into a dress for Mrs. Eisenhower to wear during the president‚Äôs successful 1956 reelection campaign. Schumacher‚Äôs Blue Room Lampas was featured in Jackie Kennedy‚Äôs famous TV tour of the White House, which aired in 1962. In 1998, F. Schumacher & Co. acquired Patterson Flynn Martin, which was established in 1943 as a purveyor of fine Wilton and Axminster carpets from Europe, and authentic hand- made reproductions of traditional rug designs from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries making it the sister company to Schumacher. Presently, it also focuses on making custom rugs for interior designers and architects. The two heritage brands, Schumacher and Patterson Flynn Martin, work in harmony to meet the needs of the ever-changing interior design industry and trends, focusing on exceptional customer service and broad range of premium product offerings.

There are two versions: EMSRaBelobaba, P. P., Air Travel Demand and Airline Seat Inventory Management. Flight Transportation Laboratory. Cambridge, MIT. PhD, 1987 and EMSRb,Belobaba, P. P., Optimal vs. heuristic methods for nested seat allocation. Presentation at ORSA/TIMS Joint National Meeting, 1992 both of which were introduced by Belobaba. Both methods are for n-class, static, single-resource problems. Because the models are static some assumptions apply: classes are indexed in such a way that the fare for the highest class, r_{1}, is higher than the fare for the next highest class, r_{2}, so r_{1} > r_{2} > ... > r_{n}; demand arrives in a strict low to high order in stages that are indexed with j as well; demand for class j is distributed with cdf F_j(x). For simplicity it is also assumed that demand, capacity and the distributions are continuous, although it is not very difficult to drop this assumption. EMSRa EMSRa is the first version that Belobaba came up with. The idea behind the heuristic is to add the protection limits that are calculated by applying Littlewood's rule to successive classes. Suppose that we are in stage j+1 and we want to calculate how much capacity we need to protect for stages j, j-1,..., 1. Then we are actually calculating protection limit yj. To do so we consider every class in j, j-1,..., 1 and compare that class, indexed with k, with j+1 in isolation. For every combination of k and j+1 we compute the protection level for that class with Littlewood's rule: :P ( D_k > y_k^{j+1}) = \\\\frac{r_{j+1}}{r_k} The idea of EMSRa then is to add all these protection limits to get the protection limit for y_j. :y_j = \\\\sum_{k=1}^j y_k^{j+1} However, there is a problem with this method because it does not take the statistical averaging effect into account. Suppose, for example, that classes 1 to j have the same fare r, then EMSRa will calculate the protection limit for y_{j+1} with : P( D_k > y_k^{j+1}) = \\\\frac{r_{j+1}}{r} However, because the fare for all these classes is the same they should be aggregated. EMSRa will calculate protection limits that are too conservative. In other words, it will reserve too many seats for the higher fares, thereby rejecting too many low fare bookings. Although having equal fares is not realistic this will also happen if the difference between fares is small. Therefore EMSRb was invented. EMSRb One of the most widely used RM heuristics is EMSRb. It is simple and produces under certain conditions close to optimal results. Belobaba reports studies in which both EMSRa and EMSRb were compared. He shows that EMSRb is consistently within 0.5 percent of the optimal solution, while EMSRa under certain conditions can deviate more than 1.5 percent from the optimal solution. However, with mixed order of arrival and frequent re-optimization both methods perform well.Belobaba, P. P., Optimal vs. heuristic methods for nested seat allocation. Presentation at ORSA/TIMS Joint National Meeting, 1992 There is also study by Polt that shows mixed results.Polt, S., Back to the roots: New results on leg optimization. In 1999 AGIFORS Reservations and Yield Management Study Group Symposium, London, UK, 1999 EMSRb is also based on an approximation that compares two classes, but it does take the statistical averaging effect into account. Instead of aggregating protection levels, as EMSRa does, it aggregates demand. Suppose we are again in stage j+1 and we want to calculate the protection limit yj. Then first all future demand for classes j, j-1,‚Ä¶, 1 is aggregated: :S_j = \\\\sum_{k=1}^j D_k and the weighted revenues are calculated: : \\\\overline{r}_j = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k=1}^j r_k \\\\cdot D_k}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^j D_k} Then, again with Littlewood‚Äôs rule, the protection limit for classes j and higher is calculated such that: : P( S_j > y_j ) = \\\\frac{r_{j+1}}{\\\\overline{r}_j} Rearranging gives: {\\\\overline{r}_j}) cellpadding border border colour = #50C878 background colour = #ECFCF4}} y_{j}^{\\\\star} is the optimal protection limit, F_{j}(x) is a continuous distribution used to model the demand. Usually demand is considered to be independent and distributed normally with a mean and a variance . Using that the protection limits can be calculated as: : y_j = \\\\mu_j + z_\\\\alpha \\\\cdot \\\\sigma_j with the mean and variance of the demand to come as \\\\mu_j = \\\\sum_{k=1}^j \\\\mu_k and \\\\sigma_j^2 = \\\\sum_{k=1}^j \\\\sigma_k^2 respectively. z_\\\\alpha is calculated with the inverse of the normal distribution z_\\\\alpha = \\\\phi^{-1}(1-\\\\frac{r_{j+1}}{\\\\overline{r}_j}). This is done for each j, giving the protection limit for every class.

The application requires connection to Internet data (e.g. 3G, 4G, WiFi, etc.) and normally uses a GPS satellite connection to determine its location. A user can enter a destination into the application, which will plot a path to it. The app displays the user's progress along the route and issues instructions for each turn. History The application‚Äôs beta release was released on October 28, 2009, accompanying the release of Android 2.0 (Eclair) on the Motorola Milestone (known as the Motorola Droid). Google Maps Navigation Beta was initially released in the United States. The application (version 4.2) was later released in the UK on April 20, 2010 and Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland on June 9, 2010. Features  Search  Instead of searching for an address or a street name, the application can also search by name, for example guide the user to a nearby restaurant by being given the name of the restaurant. The application can also take phrases such as ‚Äúa place with burgers‚Äù and suggest nearby destinations that match the phrase. The application can receive a voice input instead of typing the destination on the device. Multiple views * Traffic: The application's traffic congestion map shows the route marks with different colours based on the current traffic along the route. The traffic is measured by data from local road services such as highway cameras, as well as speed and location information from other Android devices that are accessing Google Maps for Mobile. * Satellite: The application displays a route from a bird‚Äôs eye view using Google‚Äôs satellite imagery. * Street: The Google Street View feature displays a route from first-person view as which automatically changes as the user travels along the route.... Car dock mode Users can dock their Android device in a car using a special car dock for the device (which may or may not come with the device). Once docked, the device will enter this mode, enabling for easier access to the navigation features at an arm‚Äôs length. Walking and transit The application provides voice navigation for walking and previously for transit directions. In its current iteration navigation is not available for transit, only a list of directions is provided. The transit directions are available in 400 cities around the world. Offline guidance Once the user has searched for a destination, the map will cache along the intended route. It is also possible to download a map over a certain area and store it on the phone, which can be useful when there are high roaming charges or expected slow connection. The application requires an Internet connection to search for the route, but once a route has been found the user no longer requires an Internet connection as the route is temporarily saved onto the device.

The film is about a group of teenagers telling ghost stories around a campfire. One of the storytellers is horror legend Gunnar Hansen. The movie also uses many elements from famous horror stories and directors (Lucio Fulci specifically). Plot The first story involves a young couple returning home after hearing on the radio that a murderer with a hook on his right hand has escaped from the local insane asylum and is terrorizing the countryside. Upon returning home, the girlfriend discovers that her parents have been decapitated. As she runs to get help from her boyfriend she discovers that he has also fallen victim to the hook. A battle ensues and she comes out victorious, killing the escaped prisoner with his own hook. The second story involves two stoners searching for marijuana. Upon finding a large quantity, and a very strange drug dealer, they return home to smoke it. When they awaken they are sickly and appear to be rotting. They return to get more and notice that the dealer is suffering from the same symptoms. But they take no notice and return home to indulge once again. Again, they awaken more sickly than before. Instead of seeking medical treatment they return to the dealer, only to find that he is no longer there. His plants are still in the apartment and the two take all of the plants with them back to their place. They indulge once again. As they smoke, they begin to fall apart and eventually turn to slime. The third story has to do with a greedy, selfish man returning home to his mother for Christmas. He kills her for the inheritance, pushing her down the stairs leading into the basement. He leaves the body and heads over to his brother's house to watch his two children while he and his wife leave for the emergency room due to the husband breaking his arm putting up their Christmas Tree. The children tell him a tale about an evil Santa Claus known as \\"Satan Claus\\" who comes and punishes those who do evil things throughout the year. He leaves to head back to his mother's house, plotting what he is going to tell the police and his brother. Upon returning he is attacked by Satan Claus, who rips his heart out. The fourth story and final story is about a shipwrecked pirate on a desolate island. He discovers a man who warns him about buried treasure on the island being guarded by zombies. The pirate kills the man and goes in search for the treasure, ignoring the man's warnings. He discovers the treasure only to be attacked by a large group of pirate zombies. After running from them for some time they eventually catch and kill him. The wrap around story involves the young men going to sleep with the narrator revealing a hook on his right hand. Cast * Gunnar Hansen as Ralph * Robin Roberts as Jason * Tres Holton as Billy * Courtney Ballard as Danny * Lora Podell as Susan * H. Ray York as The Hook * Johnny Tamblyn as Jim Reception Website Mondo Digital wrote about the film: \\"Despite the immediate presence of Hansen, Campfire Tales may be a bit difficult for jaded horror fans to warm up to; the first half hour or so is standard zero-budget fare with only an unusual amount of gore to distinguish it. Stick with it, though, and you'll be well rewarded; the last two stories really pay off with a fine mix of storytelling, grue, and sick laughs; coupled with some atmospheric camerawork and nifty monster effects. \\" The Video Graveyard gave it two and a half stars.

Its name is a tribute to engineer Jose Alfredo Marsilac, who developed many techniques for building roads and tunnels, even after losing 99% of his vision from being hit by a bomb in the Revolution of 1932.  History  Early settlement of the area owed mainly to the construction of the Sorocabana Railroad connecting Mairinque and Santos, completed in 1935. Along its extension, there were three stations in the district: Engineer Marsilac (which gave name to the surrounding neighborhood and later to its own district), Evangelista de Souza, and Rio de Campos.  Features  Located near the Serra do Mar and almost entirely rural, Marsilac has the largest land area of the municipality, equivalent to all of the municipality's central area. It also has the lowest population density of all the districts, largely covered by reserves of the Atlantic Forest.

In 1974 he started his first magazine, MuscleMag International, with an initial print run of 110,000. He had no previous experience with magazine publishing and MuscleMag would not turn a profit for 15 years - forcing Kennedy to dodge creditors and even sell his home and his car to finance it. The magazine ceased publication on June 7, 2013 after Robert Kennedy Publishing declared bankruptcy.Robert Kennedy Publishing Shuttered In addition to MuscleMag International, Kennedy has also written 53 books, including several New York Times bestsellers; Hardcore Bodybuilding, Reps!, RockHard!, Beef It!, and Pumping Up! He eventually decided to become a book publisher himself, and under Robert Kennedy Publishing, the company has published hundreds of books. In the 1976, Kennedy opened a chain of fitness stores called MuscleMag International, the first of which opened in downtown Toronto on Yonge Street. Kennedy soon followed with stores in Miami, New York, Las Vegas, and California, eventually reaching 28 stores. He also created a fitness clothing line (Faremon) and supplement line (Formula 1). Most of the stores were eventually closed, while the clothing and supplement line was sold or discontinued to concentrate on the core business of book and magazine publishing. In 1997 Kennedy started Oxygen magazine, which targets a female fitness demographic. By 2008 the publication reached a circulation of over 200,000. Currently, the magazine-publishing arm includes five titles: MuscleMag International (hardcore bodybuilding), Oxygen (women‚Äôs fitness), American Curves (swimsuit images of fitness women), Clean Eating (eating for health and fitness), and Reps! (building a proportionate body). In 2011 another title, Maximum Fitness, was folded into Reps! and the first issue was published with a double cover. Maximum Fitness had until then been a general men's fitness title published six times a year. Kennedy is also known in the bodybuilding world for coining the term \\"Hardcore Bodybuilding\\" after publishing the book under the same name; and the concept The Pre-Exhaust Principle, known and used by bodybuilders around the world. Kennedy is also credited with discovering and helping launch the careers of numerous fitness models, bodybuilders, actors and wrestlers, including Trish Stratus, Victoria Pratt, Torrie Wilson, Cory Everson, Roland Kickinger, Larry Vinette and Ronnie Coleman. At the Arnold Classic bodybuilding and fitness expo held on March 3, 2012, just weeks before his death, Kennedy was awarded The Arnold Schwarzenegger Lifetime Achievement Award; the award was presented by Schwarzenegger to Kennedy's wife, Tosca Reno. Kennedy is an internationally collected studio artist, his collection includes over 250 contemporary original acrylic and oil paintings now under his family's management.http://webfarm.foliolink.com/Asset.asp?AssetID=58980&AKey;=H5ACJ6V2 He painted under his father's name Wolfgang Kals.http://www.wolfgangkals.com Kennedy extremely admired his contemporaries and collected their work whenever possible,.http://webfarm.foliolink.com/Asset.asp?AssetID=58978&AKey;=H5ACJ6V2http://webfarm.foliolink.com/GalleryMain.asp?GalleryID=136366&AKey;=H5ACJ6V2 He was also an avid photographer, photographing the bodybuilding greats during his annual visits to Santa Monica, CA.http://webfarm.foliolink.com/GalleryMain.asp?GalleryID=136367&AKey;=H5ACJ6V2 Personal life Kennedy had two children, a son, Braden, and a daughter, Chelsea, with his first wife. In 1998, Kennedy and Braden who was then 11, were in a car crash. Kennedy was thrown from the car but Braden suffered severe brain damage and would require round-the-clock care (until his death in March 2011). After the accident Kennedy's wife committed suicide.https://www.thestar.com/living/health/article/1166712--robert-kennedy- was-a-trailblazer-in-the-fitness-industry Robert Kennedy was a trailblazer in the fitness industry Kennedy's second wife was fitness writer Tosca Reno, who is the author of the best-selling book series The Eat-Clean Diet (published by Robert Kennedy Publishing).

The explosion was discovered by Jack Newton in scans of images produced by Tim Puckett. (It was independently discovered by the Lick/Tenagra Observatory as part of their combined supernova search program.) Initially it had an apparent magnitude of about 14.7 and was categorized as a Type IIn supernova. However, in 2008 Dovi Poznanski discovered that the spectrum more closely resembled a Type Ia supernova. Further, the energy output was much lower than a typical supernova and the luminosity dropped at a dramatic pace. A team consisting of Poznanski, Joshua Bloom, Alex Filippenko and others concluded that it was a new category of exploding star. This system is believed to consist of a binary pair of white dwarf stars, with helium being transferred from one dwarf to the other. The accreted helium exploded in a thermonuclear reaction on the surface of the more massive white dwarf, resulting in the observed outburst. In this sense, it was akin to a nova explosion, although the magnitude of the explosion was a thousand times greater. In 2007 Lars Bildsten et al. had predicted this category of explosion would occur in AM Canum Venaticorum star binary systems. NGC 1821 is an irregular galaxy categorized as type IB(s)m. It is apparent magnitude 14.5 and has a redshift of 0.012029. This galaxy is located about 48 megaparsecs from the Earth.

It is a state-recognised climatic health resort and has accommodation for 200 visitors as well as 700 inhabitants. The village lies on the Innerste at a height of 550‚Äì600 m above sea level. Surrounded by meadows, woods and numerous lakes (see Upper Harz Ponds), it is a base for all sorts of leisure activities such as hiking, cycling, fishing, swimming and, in winter, cross-country skiing. From the Kuckholzklippe observation tower there is an impressive view over the mountains to the Harz Foreland.

Points of interest   Regular events  * Cattle and Sheep Day (mid-August) * Buntenbock Folk Festival and Sch√ºtzenfest (end of August)  Tourism  Tourism has played an important role in Buntenbock for a good 100 years. In the early days it was advertised as a healthy place to recover from illness due to its mountain air. Buntenbock lay on important transport routes and was traditionally a village of carters, who mainly worked for the mines. The keeping of domestic animals, particularly horses and goats, stems from that time. In the cheese dairy of Buntenbock's goat farm (Ziegenhof), goat's milk is processed into products such as the aromatic Buntenb√∂cker Ziegenk√§se goat's cheese. In the area around Buntenbock are numerous lakes from the mining era, which are used for swimming in summer and skating in winter. In and around Buntenbock there are many walking trails, which include the Harzer Hexenstieg that passes nearby. The village has a small spa park where, from April to September, there is a village market every fortnight on a Wednesday. In winter there is tobogganing and cross-country skiing on Buntenbock's local mountain, the Ziegenberg.

She entered into the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in 1898, and sided with its Bolshevik faction following the intra-party division into the Bolshevik and Menshevik camps in 1903. She met her husband, Vladimir Bobrovsky, during their mutual involvement in political work against the czarist regime. Bobrovskaya was first arrested in Kharkiv in 1900. After a period in Switzerland in 1902, she returned to Russia, choosing Tver as a center of activity following an arrest in St. Petersburg. She first met with Lenin, then based in the Swiss city of Geneva, in 1902, during her work as an agent of the Iskra, the party newspaper Lenin had founded in 1900, and, together with her husband Vladimir, followed the party‚Äôs work to the Caucasus.

Dr. Schnell is President of the Society for Mathematical Biology. He serves on the Editorial Board of Mathematical Biosciences,.http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaleditorialboard.cws_home/505777/editorialboard  Research  Dr. Schnell systematically investigated for the first time how the rate laws describing intracellular reactions vary as a function of the physico-chemical conditions of the intracellular environments. His work has focused to resolve the ambiguities in the quantitative analysis and modeling of reactions inside cells. He has also focused his research attention on deriving mathematical expressions to estimate enzyme kinetics parameters under different reaction conditions. He has systematically obtained equations to estimate kinetic parameters for the family of Michaelis-Menten reaction mechanisms and determined their region of validity for the initial enzyme and substrate concentrations. Dr. Schnell derived a generic expression, known nowadays as the Schnell-Mendoza equation, to determine the Michaelis-Menten constant and maximum velocity for enzyme catalyzed reactions following Michaelis-Menten kinetics using time course data. In addition, Dr. Schnell has also extensive experience in developing multiscale models of developmental processes and cancer. His work has been highlighted in popular science magazines, such as American Scientisthttp://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/multiscale-modeling- in-biology (USA), Investigaci√≥n y CienciaModelizaci√≥n en biolog√≠a a trav√©s de escalas m√∫ltiples\\" Investigaci√≥n y Ciencia, Mayo 2007, N√∫mero 268, pp. 60-69 (Spain and Latin-America), Spektrum der Wissenschaft (Germany).

Geography  Laute in Lautenthal High Street (Hahnenkleer Stra√üe) Market Place Market Place with former Town Hall Former railway station Lautenthal lies in the Innerste valley between Clausthal-Zellerfeld and Langelsheim in the northwestern Upper Harz. The town is located at a height of about in a valley bowl, the surrounding mountains being up to . The two rivers of the Innerste and the Laute flow through the town. Towards Langelsheim the Innerste is impounded by the Innerste Dam.  History  Mining of copper, lead and silver in the area around Lautenthal started about 1225.Evert Heusinkveld: Die Innerstetalbahn Langelsheim - Altenau, p. 64. Nordhorn 2007 In the middle of the 14th century, however, the Harz was depopulated because of plague and mining came to an end. Mining in the Harz was started again in 1524. Lautenthal was founded in 1538 as a mining settlement on the river Laute, a small tributary of the Innerste, and had already been given the status of a town by 1580. Sixteen years later it became a free mining town. The town was enlarged in 1560 and a rectangular market place was laid out. A comparatively large town hall was built in 1570. The building was transformed into a hotel later. In 1626, the town was plundered by the troops of Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly in the Thirty Years' War. The Protestant town church was built 1649-59. In 1690, 28 mines were operated in and around Lautenthal. In 1821, the town had 2.006 inhabitants.W. Keil: Neumanns Orts- und Verkehrslexikon, p. 593. Leipzig 1905 The railway line to Lautenthal, Innerste Valley Railway, was inaugurated in 1875 and extended to Altenau in 1914. Railway bridges were built over the Laute and the Innerste. Tourism gradually developed creating more and more jobs. At the beginning of the 20th century, Lautenthal had 2.626 inhabitants. As of 30 June 2018, Lautenthal had a population of 1,570. With the closure of the mines in 1959 the town lost its significance and was incorporated into the borough of Langelsheim in 1972. In 1976 the railway line to Lautenthal was closed and the former railway station was transformed into a hotel.

It was transformed into a brewery museum in 1960. * The present Market Place (Marktplatz) was laid out in 1560. In the Middle Ages, many inhabitants of Lautenthal worked as charcoal-burners who lived in small wooden huts in the forest in summer. A small charcoal- burner's hut, rebuilt in a traditional style, can be seen in the middle of the Market Place. The former Town Hall was built in 1570 and transformed into a hotel in 1658. It was inhabited by Goethe in 1784 and by King George V. in 1862. * The old clocktower was built in 1680 on a hill offering a scenic view of the town.

However the Bugatti Type 252 never went beyond the prototype stage. The car now resides in the Cit√© de l'Automobile museum in Mulhouse, France.  History  Developed between 1957 and 1962, the Bugatti Type 252 was the last car proposed by the historic Bugatti brand before it was sold to Hispano-Suiza in 1963. The Bugatti Type 252 is the result of a mid-size sports car study conducted by Roland Bugatti and was designed by Giovanni Michelotti. It was reportedly pitched to multiple different investors but never was funded and remained a one-off. It is powered by a 1.5 L inline 4 engine with twin overhead camshafts and uses MacPherson strut suspension in the front and rear. During development, the car suffered numerous engine problems, and on test drives, driver Pierre Macoin would frequently end up broken down on the side of the road. To avoid any unwanted publicity, Bugatti decided that they would fit the prototype engine under the hood of a Bugatti Type 73 saloon. Later though, both the engine and chassis of the Type 252 were redesigned. Work on the suspension began in August 1959 and was completed in 1962, but the project was abandoned soon after.

It was also issued under the title Head Room. It was the first FM album to feature Ben Mink, who replaced founding member Nash the Slash on electric violin and electric mandolin, instruments which Nash also played. It has been re-released for the first time in CD format on Esoteric Records in February 2013. Recording The album was made using the direct to disc recording method, in which recording tape is not used. This method requires that the group perform two 15-minute sides live in the studio with no overdubs. The recording is mixed live and transcribed to the master disc as it is being performed. This was a briefly popular format in the 1970s, and like all albums made this way, it was a limited edition, because only so many copies can be pressed from the master disc. The album was mostly instrumental, consisted of one piece on each side, and was issued on a small label called Labyrinth Records, catalogue number LBR-1001, which suggests it was likely the label's first (and possibly only) release. It was well received by critics who compared the first side to a blend of Yes, King Crimson, and Lighthouse, while the second side took on a jazz feel, concluding with the sound of an unusual instrument: an alpha wave brain monitor plugged into a synthesizer, translating drummer Martin Deller's live brainwaves into a throbbing hum. Artwork The fantasy cover art by Paul Till shows a warrior (possibly from the distant past, or the distant future, and possibly female) gazing into a portal and seeing a green glowing vacuum tube in the foreground, superimposed over the warrior's face. The concept references the album's use of older, but not obsolete, and (arguably) superior recording technologies: tube amplifiers, and the direct to disc recording process. Editions and Head Room reissue During the recording session, six takes were recorded for each side. The original edition uses take four on each side. The take number is determined by checking the side number suffix in the matrix numbers inscribed next to the run-out groove. Suffixes A4 and B4 indicate take four. This version was a limited edition of 20,000 copies.Pictures of Direct to Disc covers and labels, plus quote from Martin Deller, at Blacknoise site Some time after the original edition's release (possibly in 1980), several reissues appeared. One still has the original Direct to Disc title, but it has a different company name on the label: Kiras Music Works. Another edition changes the album title to Head Room, or perhaps Headroom. The title, which is also the title of the piece covering side one, is spelled as one word on the main track list printed on the inner gatefold cover, but as two words in the engineering credits and on the first edition's cream coloured label. (The Kiras edition's label is also cream coloured.) Conversely, it is spelled as two words on the front cover of the later edition, but as one word on its black label, which has no label name. All editions continue to use the Labyrinth Records name and original catalogue number on the cover. These later editions use different takes of the track for side two. Takes one and two (marked B1 and B2 in the matrix area) are known to exist. In an interview, Martin Deller suggested the later editions were not known to the band at the time: > \\"As far as the Direct to Disc goes there was a limited pressing of 20,000 > copies and it sold out. However a local fan has collected a couple of copies > of the album and I understand that they have different versions of each take > (side 1, side 2) on them! I have yet to check this out but if so there may > be more (than the 20K) available.\\" :‚Äì Martin Deller, January 2004 The claim that alternate takes of side one exist has not been confirmed, but the quote suggests Deller was uncertain of the details. A remastered edition of Direct to Disc was released by Esoteric Records (ECLECM2377) on February 25, 2013. Track listing Descriptions are taken from the track list on the album cover. Timings are taken from the first edition's label, which uses take four of each side. Later editions have alternate takes of side two, and timings are not shown on the labels.

Racing and touring cyclists generally prefer to cycle to Torfhaus via the Landstra√üe 504 from Altenau, which is also called the \\"Steep Face\\" (Steile Wand); The Bundesstra√üe 4, with its heavy motor traffic, is only used for round trips as an unavoidable route section. The cafe Brockenblick (\\"Brocken view\\") is a popular meeting point for motorcyclists. In winter, Torfhaus has various cross country skiing routes as well as hiking trails. There is also a toboggan run with a lift and a ski slope with a drag lift. The Goethe Way runs along the Torfhausmoor (a raised bog). It is accessible on a board walk installed by the national park and enables as good view of the Brocken.

The Lex Baebia was the first bribery law in RomeAn earlier law in 358 (the Lex Paetelia) is sometimes referenced, but dubiously; the law may not have existed, or may have existed and not dealt with bribery, or not been put into effect; see T.

Baebius played an important diplomatic and military role in the Roman-Syrian War. In carrying out the deportation of the Apuani of Liguria for the purpose of occupying their territory, Baebius is also a significant figure in tracing the history of Roman expansionism.  Family  During the Republican era, all men with the family name Baebius who are known to have held the highest magistracies belong to the branch distinguished by the cognomen Tamphilus.Elizabeth Rawson, \\"Sallust on the Eighties?\\" Classical Quarterly 37 (1987), p. 166. Marcus's brother Gnaeus was consul in 182 BC, in an unusual instance of two brothers holding the office in succession. Their father, Quintus, was a praetor; the Q. Baebius Tamphilus who was tribune of the plebs in 200 may have been the eldest of his sons.See Baebia (gens) for more on Q. Baebius, the tribune of 200 BC.  Early career  M. Baebius Tamphilus was a tribune of the plebs in 194.CIL 12 2.585. Broughton notes that the Lex agraria of 111 names a M. Baebius who was both plebeian tribune and one of the IIIvir col. deduc. and whom Mommsen identified as this man. Giovanni Niccolini, in I fasti dei tribuni della plebe (Milan 1934), the standard work of tribunicial prosopography, regards this as uncertain.

In that same year, he served on a three-man commission (triumviri coloniae deducendae) with an otherwise unknown Decimus Junius Brutus and the Marcus Helvius who was praetor in 197, for the purpose of establishing a Roman colony at Sipontum in southern Italy.Livy, 34.45.3.

In November 193 BC, Baebius was elected praetor for the following year. In the sortition to allot provincesA provincia was a task assigned to an elected magistrate who held imperium; although the task might be defined in terms of a geographical area, it was not originally a \\"province\\" in the modern sense of an area under formal administration. Baebius drew Hispania Citerior and Atilius Serranus got Hispania Ulterior. Although the sequence of events and thus reconstructions of causation differ among scholars,For a detailed and provocative examination of the background to Baebius's command, see John D. Grainger, The Roman War of Antiochos the Great (Brill, 2002), particularly Chapter 8, pp. 163‚Äì191, limited preview online. the senate decided to override the lots, a constitutional procedure that during this period required a senatorial decree and a vote in the people's assembly.On the workings of the constitutional machinery, see T. Corey Brennan, The Praetorship in the Roman Republic (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 187 online. The senate is sometimes thought to have reacted to news at Rome that Antiochus III of Syria had invaded Greece by crossing to Demetrias, but this report was likely not delivered till mid-year. At any rate, the senate awarded Atilius the dual provinciae of Macedonia and the Roman fleet, with orders to build 30 quinqueremes and to man them with sailors from the allies, and sent him in the spring of 192 to the Peloponnese. Baebius was given a provincia over the Bruttii, in modern-day Calabria, with command of two legions, 15,000 Italian allied infantry, and 500 Italian allied cavalry. The Bruttii had sided with Hannibal and the Carthaginians until their defeat by the Romans; during the previous year, three Roman colonies had been established in their confiscated territory, which was not yet regarded as secure.Grainger, The Roman War of Antiochos pp. 165‚Äì167, 188 (note 75). Later that year, Baebius and his troops were moved to Tarentum and Brundisium, where he prepared for a crossing to Epirus.The province of the Bruttii passed to A. Cornelius Mamulla, praetor 191 BC, in command of a force comparable in size to that of Baebius; see Grainger, The Roman War of Antiochus p. 167; Brennan, Praetorship, p. 203 online. During this same time, the consul L. Quinctius Flamininus levied troops in preparation for war the following year.R.M. Errington, \\"Rome against Philip and Antiochus,\\" in The Cambridge Ancient History: Rome and the Mediterranean to 133 B.C. (Cambridge University Press, 1989, 2nd edition, reprinted 2003), vol. 8, pp. 282‚Äì283 online. From 192 to 190, praetors were regularly dispatched to southern Italy to guard the coastline against rumored attack and to ensure the continued loyalty of Roman allies. Baebius's assignment from the senate was \\"to guard the entire coast in the vicinity of Tarentum and Brundisium.\\"Brennan, Praetorship p. 203. Grainger (pp. 170‚Äì172) maintains that these military measures were insufficient if the senate had serious fears of an invasion and were instead \\"cosmetic\\" for the purpose of quelling exaggerated rumors (described by Livy as \\"anonymous and groundless,\\" 35.23.2) of Antiochus's intentions. Grainger attributes the rumors to Africanus, who was trying to make a case that an alliance between Antiochus and Hannibal would pose a serious threat. On the sequence of events, see also William V. Harris, War and Imperialism in Republican Rome, 327‚Äì70 B.C. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1979), p. 220, note 4 online. As propraetor for the following year, Baebius was assigned to Macedonia and Greece. These territories had not been annexed under Roman rule at the time, and the assignment was a military command.For ancient sources on Baebius's activities in 192‚Äì191 BC, see Livy 35.20.12‚Äì13, 23.5, 24.7; 36.1.7, 6.8, 8.6, 10.10, 13.1‚Äì9, 22.8; also Appian, Syrian Wars 16; Zonaras 9.19. The provinciae of Baebius and Atilius in the East overlap, but their missions differ. Atilius was charged with defending Roman allies with his fleet, ostensibly against Nabis of Sparta, who in any event had died before the praetor's arrival. Baebius's smaller force, shipped out in September or October, held the region around Apollonia.Brennan, Praetorship p. 206; Grainger, The Roman War of Antiochos p. 188. Tetradrachm of Philip V of Macedon (British Museum) During the winter of 191, Baebius negotiated at Dassaretis with Philip V of Macedon, who was increasingly ill- disposed toward Antiochus. Only the city of Demetrias and the Aetolians were supporting Antiochus. Baebius agreed that Philip should keep any territories he captured from the Aetolians and their allies, and Baebius himself garrisoned the strategically located Thessalian city of Larisa in time to prevent its capture by Antiochus. Before the arrival of the new consul M'. Acilius Glabrio in April, Philip and Baebius had conducted \\"devastatingly swift\\" operations in ThessalyThe future consul Appius Claudius Pulcher, as a young officer under Baebius's command, had taken a leading role in these operations; see Grainger, The Roman War of Antiochos pp. 228‚Äì229 and Livy 36.10.10‚Äì14 and 13.1 and Appian, Syrian War 16. that regained most of the towns the Aetolians had taken in the previous year, leaving little that Glabrio would be required to do.See especially Livy 36.13.6. See also a summary of these events by N.G.L. Hammond, \\"The Reigns of Philip V and Perseus,\\" in A History of Macedonia: 336‚Äì167 B.C. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988, reprinted 2001), vol. 2, pp. 450‚Äì451 online. The consul's arrival precipitated the surrender of most of Antiochus's allies, and left the forces of the East outnumbered militarily by a two-to-one margin. Facing either retreat to Asia or a battle on his own terms, Antiochus chose to fight at Thermopylae, in the hope of using the terrain to compensate for his disadvantages. After an overwhelming defeat, he was compelled to abandon Greece, and returned to Ephesus. The entire campaign lasted only about six months.R.M. Errington, \\"Rome against Philip and Antiochus,\\" in The Cambridge Ancient History (Cambridge University Press, 1989, 2nd edition), vol. 3, p. 283. Although Antiochus's invasion had failed, the need to respond to it had shown the Roman senate the vulnerability of the settlement arrived at in Greece in 194, which diplomatic missions had hoped to address. \\"The conclusion was typical,\\" notes a historian of the period, \\"not that the settlement was wrong in principle, but that the general conditions under which it had been implemented were too uncertain. Rome needed to ensure that no major threat to the peace existed, not merely in the Balkans, but in the whole Aegean area, including Asia Minor. ‚Ä¶ It was necessary to redefine, but this time not just in terms of physical geography but in terms of geo-politics.\\"Errington, Cambridge Ancient History, p. 284 online. As a result, L. Cornelius Scipio, consul for 190, was given Greece as his province, with the understanding that he should cross into Asia as he deemed necessary.  Diplomatic missions  From 185 to 184, Baebius was one of the ambassadors (legati)The others were Q. Caecilius Metellus and either Ti. Sempronius Gracchus or the Ti. Claudius Nero who was praetor in 181. sent to negotiate disputes between Philip, his former joint commander in the Roman-Syrian War, and surrounding Greek polities, who had lodged complaints about Philip's occupation of Aenus and Maroneia.Polybius 22.10; Livy 39.23.5‚Äì29.3; Pausanias 7.8.6. At a hearing, Philip himself testified on the question of whether Rome had agreed that he could hold any cities he had captured during the campaign of 191, or only those cities that had been \\"originally\\" Aetolian. Although Baebius should have been able to answer that question conclusively, he appears not to have, and the commission arrived at no summation: \\"The hearing was in fact a farce.\\"N.G.L. Hammond, \\"The Reigns of Philip V and Perseus,\\" in A History of Macedonia: 336‚Äì167 B.C. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, reprinted 2001), vol. 2, p. 456 online. See also John Briscoe, A Commentary on Livy, Books 38‚Äì40 (Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 315‚Äì316. The delegation also met with Achaean magistrates to discuss Achaean treatment of Sparta.Polybius 22.10 and 23.4.7; Diodorus 29.17; Pausanias 7.8.6 and 9.1.  Consulship and triumph  Marcus Baebius succeeded his brother Gnaeus in the consulship. Family influence was perhaps not absent in the election, since it fell to Gnaeus as presiding magistrate to select rogatores, the election officials to whom voters voiced their choice, and to declare the winners.Secret ballots were not used in Roman elections until the Lex Gabinia tabellaria of 139 BC. See Andrew Lintott, The Constitution of the Roman Republic (Oxford University Press, 1999, reprinted 2002), pp. 169‚Äì170 online. The consular colleague of Baebius in 181 was P. Cornelius Cethegus. Both consuls were assigned to Liguria as their province. Their efforts to levy troops were hampered by a plague, and this delay kept them from coming to the aid of the proconsul L. Aemilius Paullus, who was under siege.Livy 40.18.1, 3; 40.24‚Äì26; 40.35.1. Citations from Livy and the following overview from Miriam R. Pelikan Pittenger, Contested Triumphs: Politics, Pageantry, and Performance in Livy's Republican Rome (University of California Press, 2008), pp. 81‚Äì82 online; see also pp. 93, Paullus managed a victory without their relief, took an impressive number of prisoners of war, and earned a triumph. Other Ligures sent peace envoys to Rome, and while their overtures were rejected by the distrustful senate,Livy 40.34.8‚Äì12. Cornelius and Baebius faced no military challenges in their province.Livy 40.35.1 and 40.37.9. Their imperium was nevertheless prorogued for the following year. The senate's instructions were that they should await their successors and then dismiss their troops and return to Rome,Livy 40.36.7. but when the plague claimed the life of one of the consuls for 180,This was G. Calpurnius Piso. public business was suspended, and the two proconsuls decided to march against the Ligurian Apuani, presumably without authorization. The Apuani, who had no reason to expect an attack from Rome after extending an offer of peace, were caught by surprise and effected an immediate surrender (deditio).Livy 40.37.1‚Äì38.1. The senate then approved a plan for removing the Apuani from their land and allocated \\"sizable\\" public funds for that purpose. The proconsuls forced thousands of families to leave their homes in the mountains and resettled them in territory which formerly belonged to the SamnitesLivy 40.36.7, 37.8‚Äì38.9; see also Samnite Wars. and which was now ager publicus, land held in common ostensibly for the benefit of the Roman people. It was claimed that this action reduced the Apuanian threat to the security of the Republic,Livy 40.38.2‚Äì7. and the senate voted Cornelius and Baebius a triumph without controversy, though others had been denied under similar circumstances for insufficient hostages or booty for the treasury. The Augustan historian Livy, however, later said that this was the first triumph awarded nullo bello gesto, \\"without a war waged.\\"Livy 40.38.8‚Äì9. The policy of deportation continued to be carried out by consuls assigned to Liguria for several years, and substantial populations from among the Ligures were moved to central Italy.Miriam R. Pelikan Pittenger, Contested Triumphs: Politics, Pageantry, and Performance in Livy's Republican Rome (University of California Press, 2009), pp. 112‚Äì113.  Electoral reform  It was Baebius's task also to hold elections for the next year. Rome's expansionist activities had created a culture of ambition that threatened to corrupt the electoral process.Brennan, Praetorship p. 625; J. Briscoe, \\"Livy and Senatorial Politics, 200‚Äì167 B.C.: The Evidence of the Fourth and Fifth Decades,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt 2.30.2 (de Gruyter, 1982), p. 1107 online. A flurry of legislation in the 190s and 180s attempted to address these growing problems.Henrik Mouritsen, Plebs and politics in the late Roman Republic (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 124 online. Advancement through the political career track had not been regularized before the 190s; the consulship and praetorship might be held in either order, without prerequisites. At the beginning of the Republic, imperium had been granted to the two consuls and a sole praetor; by 197 BC, there were six praetors.Andrew Lintott, The Constitution of the Roman Republic (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 114. The annexation of territories had led to a shortage of personnel qualified to hold imperium and meet administrative and military demands in the new provinces, and commands were frequently extended (prorogatio) beyond the annual magistracy.Brennan, Praetorship, pp. 605. It is during this time that the Latin word provincia takes on the additional meaning, like the modern, of an administrative territory. A law dating to ca. 196 BC began to require that candidates for the consulship must first have served as praetors, and fiercer competition for the praetorship stimulated campaign corruption and bribery (ambitus). Baebius spearheaded legislation to crack down on ambitus. Anyone convicted of bribery was disqualified from holding public office for ten years. This law was accompanied by an attempt to regulate prorogation. The Lex Baebia et Cornelia of 181It is unclear whether legislation on the number of praetors was a separate law, or a provision of the law on ambitus usually known as the Lex Baebia; see Brennan, Praetorship pp. 169‚Äì170 on the likelihood that the two measures were part of the same law. devised a complicated system aimed at limiting the number of ex-praetors vying for the consulship. In the sortition for provinciae, the two Spains were to be left out in odd-numbered years, and only four praetorships would be available in those years.Livy 40.44.2. In effect, a provincial appointment in Spain meant automatic prorogation, resulting in a two-year term. The Lex Baebia thus marks the constitutionalized acceptance of routinely extending commands past the year of the elected magistracy.Brennan, Praetorship p. 626. This law was supported by M. Porcius Cato, the famous legislative and moral reformer.John Hazel, Who's Who in the Roman World (Routledge, 2001), p. 58 online. But because this limit only decreased the number of administrators available for other provinces, resulting in further use of prorogation, six praetors became the norm again in the mid-170s, and the moral issues were set aside.Brennan, Praetorship pp. 625‚Äì626. These laws should also be viewed in the context of other legislation during the Middle Republic that was aimed at disrupting the hold of factions and dynasties on political power. The extra-constitutional activities of Cornelius and Baebius in Liguria may cast doubt on the extent to which personal probity underlay their efforts at reform. A law proposed in 151 BC and also supported by Cato forbade reelection to the consulship after M. Claudius Marcellus held his third term; the early 20th-century historian G.W. Botsford observed that while Cato may have intended to help \\"new men\\" (novi homines) advance, in practice \\"the measure contributed to the further subordination of the individual to the plutocratic machine.\\" Botsford held that the Baebian bribery law was put forward \\"in the same partisan spirit rather than in the interest of political morality,\\" and that it failed to achieve its aim. Another consular Lex de ambitu in 159 is sometimes thought to have carried the death penalty, but in practice the punishment was exile, and \\"this law had no more effect than the earlier.\\"George Willis Botsford, The Roman Assemblies from Their Origin to the End of the Republic (New York, 1909), p. 348 online.

Wrestle Radio U.S.A.: Grapplers Speak. Toronto: ECW Press, 2004. (pg. 81) She retired from wrestling in 1995, and eventually followed her husband into the radio industry.

Blackstone and Pedicino are also the owners of a successful publishing company, Food Fax, which puts out six specialty advertising guides a year. The company originally sent out fax listings to office workers listing lunch menus and daily specials from over 1,000 local restaurants in Cobb County, Georgia. It was the first of its kind to offer such service.Nash, Rebecca. \\"Cobb At Work - Couple links up with \`all the news that's fit to eat'.\\" The Atlanta Journal Constitution. 19 Nov. 1992: G13 Biography Early career and Superstars of Wrestling One of two daughters born to Buster and Annette Blackstone in 1965, Boni Blackstone grew up in Riverdale, Georgia and graduated from North Clayton High School in 1984.

Out of 70 young women, Pedicino read 20-30 of the best letters on the show and selected Blackstone as the winner. As a lifelong wrestling fan, she impressed Pedicino with her knowledge of wrestling and natural camera presence. He later told The Atlanta Journal Constitution in a 1986 interview, \\"I feel like we saved ourselves six weeks in training by selecting her. Her professionalism and ease in front of the camera are outstanding. We're extremely happy with her\\".Dancy, Lee. \\"Ms. Boni Blackstone adds a soft touch to pro wrestling as a co-hostess to the \\"Superstars of Wrestling.\\" The Atlanta Journal Constitution. 20 Nov. 1986: I3 Unlike most women in professional wrestling, Blackstone was portrayed as a serious, intelligent commentator who often displayed her wrestling knowledge both calling matches with Pedicino and in interviews during her own segments. She became an instant hit with fans and, in November 1986, a group of twenty people drove in a van from Snellville, Georgia to the locked studio in downtown Atlanta to see Blackstone and attend what they believed to be a live wrestling event. This became a common occurrence during the show's early years, as neither Pedicino or Blackstone disclosed whether the show was live or taped, and fans would often be turned away by security. With the show's success, Pedicino and Blackstone became local celebrities although they often referred to themselves as \\"wrestling fans who got lucky\\". They often visited hospitals, were involved with charitable organizations The Atlanta Journal Constitution often ran stories featuring the private and professional lives of both. Global Wrestling Federation In 1991, she joined Pedicino in Dallas, Texas where he and partner Max Andrews started the Global Wrestling Federation. Their new promotion was followed by much fanfare and, when Pedicino successfully negotiated with ESPN for a weekly television show later that year, Blackstone joined her husband as part of the announcing team with Scott Hudson, Steve Prazak and Craig Johnson. She remained the only female member, and primary interviewer, during her time with the promotion. On April 9, 1992, she and Pedicino were released from the promotion as a cost-cutting measure along with other core members of the GWF including booker Eddie Gilbert, head announcer Craig Johnson, and other key GWF members.Marvez, Alex. \\"Rib Injury Sidelines Sting.\\" The Miami Herald. 19 Apr. 1992: 10D Retirement and recent years When Superstars of Wrestling finally ended in August 1992, she and her husband started their own business Food Fax.

It spans the boundaries of the city of Misawa, the town of T≈çhoku, and the village of Rokkasho in Kamikita District. Data The lake has an area of and holds of water. Its circumference is . At its deepest point, the water is deep, with an average depth of . The surface is at sea level. The lake is shallow (less than deep) from the shoreline to a distance of approximately , whereupon the depth drops off precipitously. The edge of Lake Ogawara is very near the coast of the Pacific Ocean, and the sand bar guarding its mouth has been breached numerous times by storms and typhoons, thus accounting for the brackish water of the lake. There are four inflowing rivers, all coming from the Hakk≈çda Mountains. The only outflow is the Takase River, which drains the lake to the Pacific Ocean. History Lake Ogawara was originally a marine bay, which became a lake approximately 3,000 years ago by the formation of a sand bar at its mouth. The shoreline around Lake Ogawara has been settled since prehistoric times, and numerous J≈çmon period remains and shell middens have been discovered, most notably at the Futatsumori Site on the west bank of the lake. The lake was used by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service units at Misawa Airfield to practice for the attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II due to its similarity in depth to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. The Japanese government initiated a project beginning in the 1970s to convert the lake from brackish to fresh water to serve as a source of drinking, industrial and irrigation water despite the adverse environmental impact. On February 20, 2018, an F-16 of the US Air Force based at the nearby Misawa Air Base jettisoned two external fuel tanks into the lake after experiencing an engine fire. Tests conducted in March 2018 found no residual fuel in the lake following a cleanup effort by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. Fishermen were given 85,000,000 yen (about $800,000) in a joint payment from the US and Japanese governments for loses incurred while the lake was closed to fishing during the cleanup efforts. Environment Lake Ogawara is an abundant habitat for fish and birds, and is recognized as such by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment. A variety of marimo occurs naturally in the lake. In 1996 the sound of wild birds on the shores of Lake Ogawara was selected by the Ministry of the Environment as one of the 100 Soundscapes of Japan. In 2002, the Ministry of the Environment classified Lake Ogawara to be one of the 500 Important Wetlands in Japan, particularly for its biodiversity of aquatic flora, insects, and freshwater shellfish. The lake also serves as a habitat for migratory wildfowl. The lake was previously home to the critically endangered Hucho perryi, which was last spotted in 1943. Migratory birds include the whooper swan and tundra swan, among others. Economic activity The lake is a commercial source of cultivated Japanese smelt, icefish, goby and shijimi.

As of April 2014 he is the artist in residence at the American Ballet Theatre. From 2004 to 2008 he was the director of the Bolshoi Ballet. Training and performance career Ratmansky was born in St. Petersburg and trained under Pyotr Pestov and Alexandra Markeyeva at the Bolshoi Ballet School. He graduated in 1986. He then danced in Kiev and was a principal dancer with the Ukrainian National Ballet, Royal Winnipeg Ballet and Royal Danish Ballet. Choreographic and administrative careers Ratmansky's choreographic career first became notable with his staging of the ballet Dreams of Japan for the State Ballet of Georgia in 1998. Dreams and Charms of Mannerism, choreographed in 1997, were both created for Nina Ananiashvili. Dreams earned the Golden Mask Award from the Theatre Union of Russia. Ratmansky is noted for restaging traditionally classical ballets for large companies. His first three-act story ballet was Cinderella, created for the Kirov Ballet in 2002. Ratmansky's 2003 staging of The Bright Stream (also translated as \\"The Limpid Stream\\") for the Bolshoi Ballet led to his appointment as artistic director of that company the following year. While there he also made a full-length production of The Bolt, in 2005, and re-staged Le Corsaire and the Flames of Paris, in 2007 and 2008. The Critics' Circle in London has named the Bolshoi \\"Best Foreign Company\\" under Ratmansky's direction, in 2005 and 2007, and he received its National Dance Award for The Bright Stream. After his directorship at the Bolshoi, Ratmansky agreed to become the first artist in residence for the American Ballet Theatre in 2008 after negotiations with the New York City Ballet failed over the position of resident choreographer. His ballets for the New York City Ballet include Russian Seasons and Concerto DSCH , and for the American Ballet Theatre, On the Dnieper and Seven Sonatas. In 2011, his choreography of Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet was premiered by the National Ballet of Canada in Toronto. Its performance in London earned Ratmansky the praise from New York Times reviewer Alastair Macaulay of being \\"the most gifted choreographer specializing in classical ballet today.\\" In 2014, Ratmansky took his career in a new direction when he reconstructed Marius Petipa's final revival of Paquita from the Sergeyev Collection. The reconstruction was premi√®red in Munich in December 2014, performed by the Bavarian State Ballet. In March 2015, he mounted his second Petipa reconstruction for American Ballet Theatre - The Sleeping Beauty, which premi√®red in Orange County and was later staged at the Teatro alla Scala. Ratmansky is currently reconstructing the Petipa/Ivanov 1895 staging of Swan Lake, which was premi√®red in Zurich in February 2016.

His sentence was protested by numerous Western governments and the human rights group Amnesty International, which named him a prisoner of conscience. Background Hkun Htun Oo is ethnically Shan (Tai), and was born in 1943 in Hsipaw Northern Shan State. He is the nephew of Sao Kya Seng, the last Saopha of Hsipaw who was arrested in 1962 after General Ne Win's 1962 Burmese coup d'√©tat and never seen again. He pursued a Bachelor of Laws at Rangoon University in 1964 before serving as assistant to the Indonesian military attach√© in Burma. Hkun Htun Oo went on to become \\"the most senior political representative of the Shan\\". After pro-democracy, anti-government protests toppled Ne Win's military dictatorship in 2011, Hkun Tun Oo stood for the 1990 parliamentary elections at the head of the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy (SNLD) party. His party gained 23 seats (220,835 votes),Europa Publications Staff, The Far East and Australasia, Routledge, 2003, p. 863. and within Shan State, finished ahead of even Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), which had won 59.9% of the vote nationwide. However, the military government annulled the results, the parliament never convened, and the generals continued to rule the country as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). Activism, arrest, and trial Eight years after the annulment of the election results, SNLD and 3 other ethnic parties worked on a coalition agreement with the NLD. This coalition urged the SPDC to negotiate with the NLD over human rights, but these efforts did not succeed, and Hkun Htun Oo's party ultimately urged politicians to boycott the SPDC's coming National Convention. In a 2002 interview with BBC News, he described his party's ultimate objective as \\"the establishment of a multi-party democratic system\\". That same year, he publicly protested the exclusion of Burma's ethnic minorities from Union Day celebrations. Hkun Htun Oo's opposition to the government eventually led to his arrest. On 7 February 2005‚ÄîShan National Day‚ÄîHkun Htun Oo met several other politicians for a meal, over which they discussed the SPDC's plans for the coming national transition. He was arrested two days later on charges of \\"high treason\\" and \\"inciting disaffection towards the Government\\". The other leaders present at the meeting were arrested as well. In November of that year, the group was tried in a closed trial at Insein Prison. Hkun Htun Oo was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to 93 years' imprisonment. Amnesty International criticized the trial as falling \\"far short of international fair trial standards\\", noting that the defendants were denied access to family and their own lawyers. Imprisonment and international attention Hkun Htun Oo and the other Shan State leaders were sent to different prisons in remote area of Burma, hundreds of miles from their hometowns.From 2005 to 2011, Hkun Htun Oo was held in Putao prison in Northernmost Kachin State where temperature fall below zero in winter . According to reports released from the prison, despite having diabetes and gout he received little medical attention, and was also suffering from swollen legs due to lack of exercise, as well as ischemic heart disease. Amnesty International reported that he also suffers from a peptic ulcer and arthritis. On 9 February 2010, the Democratic Voice of Burma reported that Hkun Htun Oo was \\"losing hair and weight,\\" dropping from around 160 lbs. to around 120 lbs., and on 10 February 2011, that his health was \\"deteriorating\\". Amnesty International named Hkun Htun Oo as a prisoner of conscience, and as of May 2011, continued to publicize his case. He was also made an honorary Italian citizen by the mayor of Monza on December 10, 2008. A 2010 United Nations draft resolution calling by name for the freedom of Hkun Htun Oo and other political prisoners was co-sponsored by Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Great Britain and the US. In March 2011,Hkun Htun Oo was awarded the Nationalities Hero prize by the United Nationalities Alliance, a group representing several minorities of Burma, for his \\"dedication and struggle for ethnic groups and national reconciliation\\". Release Hkun Htun Oo was released on 13 January 2012 in a mass presidential pardon of political prisoners.

The channel also has studios in Diepkloof, near the largest hospital in Africa, The Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, South Africa.  Company history   Early history  Soweto TV was founded by Mr Ephraim Tshepo Thafeng in 2005, who was then both the CEO and head of marketing for the community channel then. The channel received a 24-day special events broadcasting licence, from the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) which would see the it broadcasting eight hours a day, from 26 November 2005 till mid- December. Despite financial constraints, Soweto TV started broadcasting to millions of Soweto residents from Saturday, November 26 as scheduled. The month-long broadcast was themed, 'World Aids Day' which falls on December 1. The Dobsonville Shopping Mall provided some funding for basic staff needs, while the state-owned SABC financed the studio and installation. Volunteers; both media students and community stakeholders from the township provide manpower for the duration of the broadcasts. Following the success of the broadcast, the channel received another special events broadcasting licence in 2006 and they completed another successful broadcast. In 2007, the Soweto TV received a longer license which would see it broadcasting for a year. The license meant the channel would be live and uninterrupted for 24 hours a day from 1 July 2007 until 30 June 2008. In May 2008, the channel submitted an application for a new licence, but the expiry date for the previous license, came and went without the channel receiving a new license due to a back-log at ICASA. The channel's future seemed uncertain despite successfully broadcasting for a year. Despite not having a license, the channel was allowed to continue broadcasting whilst ICASA was processing the application, though terms of the Electronic Communications Act of 2005, which stated that: no-one may broadcast without a licence. In line with the ICASA community television licence provisions, Urban Brew Studios put together a community training programme based upon the Soweto TV channel platform.

This meant viewers would be able to watch Soweto TV across Gauteng. The 360 degree antenna would allow viewers across a wider geographical area absolute access to the channel at no extra cost. The station opened its spread on 16 June 2013. It came after the old Bop TV transmitter was removed, which had restricted the TV station to broadcasting locally, only reaching Soweto. With the new antenna, Soweto TV would reach as far as Heidelberg, Benoni, Springs and Nigel in the east; Tembisa, Vanderbijlpark, Vereeniging and Sasolburg in the south; and Pretoria North and Mamelodi in the north Recent history In August 2018, Soweto TV announced Bridget Nkuna as their new CEO.

Following the decision by the board to step down, ICASA gave the only remaining board member, Mr Nkutha and CEO, Ms Nkuna a mandated to appoint people from the community to a steering committee that would be in charge at the channel for six months in preparation for the Annual General Meeting (AGM). In an article, it would be alleged that Nkutha and Nkuna appointed their own preferred people to the board, who also happened to be their personal friends. Soon after the new board was appointed, Ms. Nkuna, was placed on special leave. Board member, Thabo Molefe also known as Tbo Touch was then appointed the channel's acting CEO. His appointment promised to bring positive change to the channel. As part of his first project, he organised a soccer tournament where soccer legends played a heritage game against local celebrities at Soweto Nike Stadium on September 24 and promised he would be rolling out documentary series, reality TV shows and soapies that resonate with the local market in the next coming months. His appointment including of the board didn't come without controversy. It is alleged that at his first meeting with the Soweto TV staff he threatened staff, saying they [board members] are not afraid of anyone and they hava a budget for CCMA and any court action taken against them. By the end of 2019, it was reported to ICASA that an illegitimate board had been appointed and was running the channel. Speaking to Sowetan LIVE in an article released on 17 January 2020, Mr. Thafeng said ICASA was fully aware of what's happening at the channel but was not doing anything about it. ICASA spokesperson Paseka Maleka confirmed receipt of the complaint in relation to the election of the board. \\"The complaints and compliance commission is investigating the matter,\\" he said.

Mitko was born in Kor√ß√´, Albania (then Ottoman Empire), where he attended the local Greek school. His uncle, Peti Mitko, had been one of the leaders of the Albanian Revolt of 1847 in Kor√ß√´ and Tepelen√´ against the Turkish Tanzimat legislation. Both left Albania in 1850, moving first to Athens, Greece, then to Plovdiv, Bulgaria and finally to Vienna, Austria, where Thimi Mitko worked as a tailor. In 1866, he emigrated to Egypt, devoting himself to the Albanian nationalist movement and setting up a successful trading business in Beni Suef where he died on 1890. Mitko collected Albanian folklore material from 1866. He corresponded with Italian prime minister Francesco Crispi, Jeronim De Rada, Dhimit√´r Kamarda, Dora d'Istria, Jan Urban Jarn√≠k, Kostandin Kristoforidhi, and Gustav Meyer, providing Kamarda with folksongs, riddles and tales for the latter's collection. Mitko's own collection of Albanian folklore, consisting of folk songs, tales and popular sayings from southern Albania was published in the Greek-Albanian journal Alvaniki melissa (Belietta Sskiypetare)Alvaniki melissa (Belietta Sskiypetare) syngramma alvano - ellinkon periechon : meros istorias \\"Dora d'Istrias - i Alvaniki fyli\\", Alvano - Ellinikas Paroimias kai Ainigmata, Alvanika kyria onomata, Asmata kai Paramythia Alvanika, kai Alvano - Ellinikon lexiologion .... (The Albanian Bee) Alexandria, Egypt on 1878. According to Mitko, the collection was meant to provide Egypt's flourishing Albanian community with information about Albanian origins, customs and character. He maintained that the heroic songs collected by him showed that Albanians had a love of country and their fellow countrymen of different religions by keeping the memory alive of history and events through songs. Mitko also encouraged Albanians to study their mother tongue, as he viewed it as \\"the first and common food reviving the people\\". De Rada noted of the time that copies of Mitko's Albanian Bee had been burned in Greece. The work was reedited by Georg Pekmezi in Vienna in 1924 under the title Bleta shqyp√´tare e Thimi Mitkos.Thimi Mitko, Georg Pekmezi: Bleta shqyp√´tare (1924). Albanian question Mitko was also the author of numerous articles in European periodicals in support of the Albanian cause. He also wrote articles in the Greek magazine Pandora. In Cairo for a short time during 1901, Mitko contributed with works that were pro-Greek to the Albanian newspaper Bashkimi i Shqiptar√´vet (Union of the Albanians) and later wrote in Faik Konica's periodical Albania. Mitko supported an Albanian-Greek union within a confederation as a dual kingdom like Austria-Hungary provided it had a guarantee of Albania's \\"natural frontiers\\", as an independent Albania for him seemed too weak to oppose the Ottoman Empire. He however viewed that scenario a distant prospect as Greeks would not give up claims to Yanina and Preveza, while Mitko thought a loss by Albania of Yanina in such a framework was \\"an incurable wound\\". He viewed Greek claims to Epirus and Yanina as \\"pedantic and imaginary\\" and held that Greeks of Yanina were hellenised Albanians speaking an acquired learned Greek. Mitko in one of his works claimed that the majority of the Albanian people supported the idea that they should remain part of the Ottoman Empire, while a small number of Christians desired union with Greece.Kondis Basil. Greece and Albania, 1908-1914. Institute for Balkan Studies; University of New York, 1976, p. 28 Later Mitko expressed views in the Italo-Albanian periodical Fiamuri Arb√´rit (Flag of Albania) that he supported the policy of the Ottoman Empire being against common enemies shared by Albanians.

This Saturday morning series lasted for one season on ABC. This show was divided into two segments: Mork & Mindy and Laverne & Shirley with the Fonz. The Laverne & Shirley half- hour was the second season of Laverne & Shirley in the Army, with the addition of The Fonz and his dog Mr. Cool from the earlier cartoon The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang. Mork & Mindy In the Mork & Mindy segment, in which Robin Williams and Pam Dawber voiced the title characters, a teenaged Mork is sent to Earth from planet Ork to observe the lives of human teenagers and enroll in a local school. As on the original show, Mindy McConnell and her father Fred (voiced by Conrad Janis) are the only Earthlings who know that he is an alien and he sends telepathic reports of his experiences to Orkan ruler Orson (voiced by an uncredited Ralph James). Unlike the original show, Mork is accompanied by his Orkan pet, a pink, six-legged, dog-like creature named Doing (voiced by Frank Welker) which is pronounced as \\"Doyng\\". Other characters in the show included Eugene (voiced by Shavar Ross), Hamilton (voiced by Mark L. Taylor), and Principal Caruthers (voiced by an uncredited Stanley Jones).

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Baker, to the north. Both are part of the Waputik Mountains. History It was named by Arthur Wheeler one week following the armistice which ended World War I to honor the Poilu, the common soldiers of the French Army. The first ascent of Mont des Poilus was made 1901 by James Outram, Edward Whymper, guided by C. Kaufmann, C. Klucker and J. Pollinger. The mountain's name became official in 1924 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Mont des Poilus is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Cambrian period. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. The Glacier des Poilus lies on the east aspect of the peak, and is part of the larger Waputik Icefield. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mont des Poilus is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.

Although sometimes compared with Beauty and the Beast, there are no parallels in the plot except that it features the relationship between a beast (monster) and a woman. The film was noted for its explicit sexual content upon its initial release. It has become a cult film. Background A loose adaptation of the novella Lokis by Prosper M√©rim√©e was originally conceived in 1972 as a film on its own. However, Borowczyk later rendered Lokis as a story (La v√©ritable historie de la b√™te du G√©vaudan) in Immoral Tales (1974), which was envisaged to be a film of six stories. After Immoral Tales was remastered as a film of four stories, the footage became the dream sequence of The Beast.LOKIS Le manuscrit du Professeur WITTEMBACH Plot Businessman Philip Broadhurst dies and leaves his estate to his daughter, Lucy, on the condition that, within six months of his death, she marries Mathurin, the Marquis Pierre de l'Esperance's son, and be married by Cardinal Joseph do Balo, the brother of Pierre's uncle, the crippled Duc Rammaendelo de Balo, who shares their crumbling farmhouse with Pierre's daughter Clarisse, and their servant Ifany. Mathurin, who manages the family horse-breeding business, is dim-witted and deformed, and has never been baptized. Pierre summons the local priest to the house for the baptism, but Pierre, by promising the priest repairs to his church and a new bell, performs the ritual himself so that the priest will not find out the truth about Mathurin. Lucy and her aunt, Virginia, are driven by their chauffeur towards the farm but their way is blocked by a fallen tree. They find a back route to the house at a back door to the house, where Lucy asks Rammaendelo about rumors. Rammaendelo, who is not in favor of the marriage because he is dependent on Mathurin to look after him, shows her a book that describes the beautiful Romilda's fight with a beast in the local forest 200 years ago. Lucy comes across several drawings depicting bestiality, and becomes sexually excited at the thought of her impending marriage, even though she has never met Mathurin. Pierre blackmails Rammaendelo into persuading his brother to perform the marriage by telling him that he has proof that Rammaendelo poisoned his wife. Rammaendelo is unable to get through to the Cardinal on the telephone, so Pierre sends a telegram, assuring him that Mathurin has been baptized and urging him to attend this evening. Everyone assembles for dinner, and Mathurin's uncouth manners become apparent. Lucy and her aunt try to leave, but are persuaded to stay. Everyone having drunk too much wine, most of the assembly fall asleep while waiting up for the Cardinal. Lucy retires to her room, undresses, puts on her thin wedding dress, and dreams that she is Romilda, playing a harpsichord. Seeing a lamb straying into the forest, she chases after it to find that it has been torn apart by a black hairy beast. Pierre overhears Rammaendelo on the telephone to the Cardinal trying to dissuade him from performing the marriage. Angrily interrupting the conversation, Pierre slits Rammaendelo's throat with a razor and tears the phone out of the wall. In the ensuing comic dream sequence, the beast with a large visible erection chases Lucy through the forest. She loses most of her clothing in the process and ends up hanging by her arms from a branch, and the beast licks her and masturbates. Lucy wakes in a sweat and wonders if it was merely a dream. She tiptoes to Mathurin's room but he is asleep, fully clothed, on his bed. Lucy returns to her room, masturbates, and dreams that the beast is copulating with her. She wakes again and is convinced that Mathurin must have visited her. She visits his room again but he is still sleeping soundly. Lucy returns to her dream. The beast continues to masturbate and Lucy rubs his ejaculate all over herself. Eventually the beast dies of exhaustion. Lucy wakes and walks into Mathurin's room to find him dead on the floor. She runs naked through the house screaming, and everyone runs to her aid. Virginia examines Mathurin's body and discovers that a plaster cast on his arm is concealing a claw for a hand. Pulling his clothes off reveals both that he is covered in thick black hair and that he has a tail. They run out of the house in terror as the Cardinal arrives. Virginia comforts the terrified Lucy as they speed away in the car, and Lucy dreams that she is naked in the forest again, burying the beast.Review with several screenshots at devildead.comDVD: Beast, The, 3-Disc Limited Edition / La Bete (1975), by Mark R.

Many felt the film went over the top with its sex scenes, leading to its withdrawal from film for several years.

The channel was initially used to simulcast programs such as Idols South Africa, and later went on to broadcast reruns of shows that were previously on other M-Net channels. However, due to multiple issues regarding signal and programming, the channel was later replaced with M-Net Family. History When Mnet's Open Time Prime Time block was closed they sought a new service to keep viewership of the popular programs in the block up. To do this they would need to be affordable to all families in order to do this. Dstv wanted to launch a scaled down package for low income households for the cost of R19.00. The second half of open time was kept for this new pay TV package and also wanted to launch with a service called Mnet Lite. Up to the end of the Open Time block this new offer was heavily advertised on the pay TV Terrestrial channel. A lot of secrecy was around this new channel and when launched it was a combination of rerun and first run content from Channel O and the rest of the Mnet Channels. From 2200 to 1100 the channel would simulcast completely with Channel O. It was also launched to promote South African movies but later evolved into a fullscale General Entertainment Channel. Its prime time also has reruns but also contains the American reality show Starting Over. It still contains African produced movies during prime time. 2009 In 2009 the channel started simulcasting Mnet's New Youth Channel Vuzu's flagship program, V Entertainment. Whenever there is a major local reality program running it will broadcast on the channel like Idols in its entirety and later Big Brother Africa's weekly highlight show. When Dstv cut All Africa Poker, they moved it content to be broadcast on MagicWorld from 2230 to 0430 with Channel O picking up where they leave off all the way to 1100. It now also reruns popular Kenyan talk show, The Patricia Show. 2015 In 2015 the channel was rebranded as M-Net Family In an attempt to revive ratings. The channel had reruns of The Wild, The Talk and the kids block Koowee. Later in 2016 the channel had a program reshuffle leaving only The Talk as the only current program from the defunct MagicWorld. In 2017, M-Net Family was discontinued due to low ratings and programs from M-Net Family moved to Vuzu. The channel's slot was later given to Zambezi Magic.

Key reforms address cost and coverage and include obesity, prevention and treatment of chronic conditions, defensive medicine or tort reform, incentives that reward more care instead of better care, redundant payment systems, tax policy, rationing, a shortage of doctors and nurses, intervention vs. hospice, fraud, and use of imaging technology, among others. The first of these reform proposals to be passed by the United States Congress is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which originated in the Senate and was later passed by the House of Representatives in amended form on March 21, 2010 (with a vote of 219‚Äì212).Noam N. Levey and Janet Hook, \\"House passes historic healthcare overhaul,\\" Los Angeles Times (March 22, 2010). President Obama signed the reforms into law on March 23, 2010. Reuters and CNN summarized the reforms and the year in which they take effect. Overview Chart showing life expectancy at birth and health care spending per capita for OECD countries as of 2015. The U.S. is an outlier, with much higher spending but below average life expectancy.OECD Health at a Glance 2015-Table 3.3 A variety of specific types of reform have been suggested to improve the United States health care system. These range from increased use of health care technology through changing the anti-trust rules governing health insurance companies and tort-reform to rationing of care. Different overall strategies have been suggested as well.New England Journal of Medicine-A Systemic Approach to Containing Healthcare Spending-September 2012 The Institute of Medicine reported in September 2012 that approximately $750B per year in U.S. health care costs are avoidable or wasted. This included: unnecessary services ($210 billion annually); inefficient delivery of care ($130 billion); excess administrative costs ($190 billion); inflated prices ($105 billion); prevention failures ($55 billion), and fraud ($75 billion).Atlantic-Brian Fung-How the U.S. Healthcare System Wastes $750B Annually-September 2012 During a June 2009 speech, President Barack Obama outlined his strategy for reform. He mentioned electronic record-keeping, preventing expensive conditions, reducing obesity, refocusing doctor incentives from quantity of care to quality, bundling payments for treatment of conditions rather than specific services, better identifying and communicating the most cost- effective treatments, and reducing defensive medicine. President Obama further described his plan in a September 2009 speech to a joint session of Congress. His plan mentions: deficit neutrality; not allowing insurance companies to discriminate based on pre-existing conditions; capping out of pocket expenses; creation of an insurance exchange for individuals and small businesses; tax credits for individuals and small companies; independent commissions to identify fraud, waste and abuse; and malpractice reform projects, among other topics. In November 2009, then-OMB Director Peter Orszag described aspects of the Obama administration's strategy during an interview: \\"In order to help contain [ Medicare and Medicaid ] cost growth over the long term, we need a new health care system that has digitized information...in which that information is used to assess what‚Äôs working and what‚Äôs not more intelligently, and in which we‚Äôre paying for quality rather than quantity while also encouraging prevention and wellness.\\" He also argued for bundling payments and accountable care organizations, which reward doctors for teamwork and patient outcomes. Mayo Clinic President and CEO Denis Cortese has advocated an overall strategy to guide reform efforts. He argued that the U.S. has an opportunity to redesign its healthcare system and that there is a wide consensus that reform is necessary. He articulated four \\"pillars\\" of such a strategy: *Focus on value, which he defined as the ratio of quality of service provided relative to cost; *Pay for and align incentives with value; *Cover everyone; *Establish mechanisms for improving the healthcare service delivery system over the long-term, which is the primary means through which value would be improved. Writing in The New Yorker, surgeon Atul Gawande further distinguished between the delivery system, which refers to how medical services are provided to patients, and the payment system, which refers to how payments for services are processed. He argued that reform of the delivery system is critical to getting costs under control, but that payment system reform (e.g., whether the government or private insurers process payments) is considerably less important yet gathers a disproportionate share of attention. Gawande argued that dramatic improvements and savings in the delivery system will take \\"at least a decade.\\" He recommended changes that address the over- utilization of healthcare; the refocusing of incentives on value rather than profits; and comparative analysis of the cost of treatment across various healthcare providers to identify best practices. He argued this would be an iterative, empirical process and should be administered by a \\"national institute for healthcare delivery\\" to analyze and communicate improvement opportunities. A report published by the Commonwealth Fund in December 2007 examined 15 federal policy options and concluded that, taken together, they had the potential to reduce future increases in health care spending by $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years. These options included increased use of health information technology, research and incentives to improve medical decision making, reduced tobacco use and obesity, reforming the payment of providers to encourage efficiency, limiting the tax federal exemption for health insurance premiums, and reforming several market changes such as resetting the benchmark rates for Medicare Advantage plans and allowing the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices. The authors based their modeling on the effect of combining these changes with the implementation of universal coverage. The authors concluded that there are no magic bullets for controlling health care costs, and that a multifaceted approach will be needed to achieve meaningful progress.Cathy Schoen, Stuart Guterman, Anthony Shih, Jennifer Lau, Sophie Kasimow, Anne Gauthier, and Karen Davis, \\"Bending the Curve: Options for Achieving Savings and Improving Value in the U.S. Health Spending\\" Commonwealth Fund, December 2007 During February 2010, President Obama updated his reform proposal, with modifications to the bills that had passed as of that time. Cost overview U.S. healthcare cost information, including rate of change, per-capita, and percent of GDP. Health insurance premiums for employer-provided family coverage 1999-2014. The 3% increase in 2014 was tied for lowest over the 16-year period. Health spending accounted for 17.6% of GDP in the United States in 2010, down slightly from 2009 (17.7%) and by far the highest share in the OECD, and a full eight percentage points higher than the OECD average of 9.5%. Following the United States were the Netherlands (at 12.0% of GDP), and France and Germany (both at 11.6% of GDP). The United States spent $8,233 on health per capita in 2010, two-and-a-half times more than the OECD average of $3,268 (adjusted for purchasing power parity). Following the United States were Norway and Switzerland which spent over $5,250 per capita. Americans spent more than twice as much as relatively rich European countries such as France, Sweden and the United Kingdom.OECD-Health Data 2012-How Does the United States Compare- June 2012OECD Health Data 2012-June 2012 The annual rate of cost increases slowed during 2010 and 2011. The causes are disputed, ranging from recession- related delays in visiting doctors to more long-term trends in moderating insurance premiums and reduced spending on structures and equipment.Washington Post-Sarah Kliff-Healthcare spending slowdown-August 2012 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported in 2013 that the rate of increase in annual healthcare costs has fallen since 2002. However, costs per capita continue to rise. Per capita cost increases have averaged 5.4% annually since 2000. Costs relative to GDP have risen from 13.8% in 2000 to 17.9% by 2009, but remained at that level in 2010 and 2011.Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-Statistics, Trends and Reports-Retrieved June 9, 2013 Several studies have attempted to explain the reduction in the rate of annual increase. Reasons include, among others: *Higher unemployment due to the 2008-2012 recession, which has limited the ability of consumers to purchase healthcare; *Rising out-of-pocket payments; *Deductibles (the amount a person pays before insurance begins to cover claims) have risen sharply. Workers must pay a larger share of their own health costs, and generally forces them to spend less; and *The proportion of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance enrolled in a plan that required a deductible climbed to about three-quarters in 2012 from about half in 2006. Increasing healthcare costs also contribute to wage stagnation, as corporations pay for benefits rather than wages. Bloomberg reported in January 2013: \\"If there‚Äôs a consensus among health economists about anything, it‚Äôs that employer-provided health benefits come out of wages. If health insurance were cheaper, or the marketplace were structured so that most people bought health coverage for themselves rather than getting it with their jobs, people would be paid more and raises would be higher.\\"Bloomberg-Rammesh Ponurru-What Republicans Misunderstand About Healthcare Costs-January 2013 Best practices Independent advisory panels President Obama has proposed an \\"Independent Medicare Advisory Panel\\" (IMAC) to make recommendations on Medicare reimbursement policy and other reforms. Comparative effectiveness research would be one of many tools used by the IMAC. The IMAC concept was endorsed in a letter from several prominent healthcare policy experts, as summarized by OMB Director Peter Orszag: Both Mayo Clinic CEO Dr. Denis Cortese and Surgeon/Author Atul Gawande have argued that such panel(s) will be critical to reform of the delivery system and improving value. Washington Post columnist David Ignatius has also recommended that President Obama engage someone like Cortese to have a more active role in driving reform efforts. Comparative effectiveness research Medicare spending per person varied significantly across states in 2006 Overutilization refers to when a patient overuses a doctor or to a doctor ordering more tests or services than may be required to address a particular condition effectively. Several treatment alternatives may be available for a given medical condition, with significantly different costs yet no statistical difference in outcome. Such scenarios offer the opportunity to maintain or improve the quality of care, while significantly reducing costs, through comparative effectiveness research. According to economist Peter A. Diamond and research cited by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the cost of healthcare per person in the U.S. also varies significantly by geography and medical center, with little or no statistical difference in outcome. Comparative effectiveness research has shown that significant cost reductions are possible. Former OMB Director Peter Orszag stated: \\"Nearly thirty percent of Medicare's costs could be saved without negatively affecting health outcomes if spending in high- and medium-cost areas could be reduced to the level of low-cost areas.\\" Pilot programs Gawande wrote that Obamacare contains a variety of pilot programs that may have a significant impact on cost and quality over the long-run, although these have not been factored into CBO cost estimates. He stated these pilot programs cover nearly every idea healthcare experts advocate, except malpractice/tort reform. He described how the U.S. faced a cost problem with agriculture, with nearly 40% of household disposable income absorbed by food costs in 1900. With a central oversight panel (the U.S.D.A.) and many pilot programs, the U.S. was able to vastly improve the productivity of its food production and reduce these costs over time. He wrote: Preventive strategies Increased use of preventive care (e.g., regular doctor visits) is one way of reducing health care spending. Official budget scores of universal health care proposals state that most of its savings would be from providing preventative care to the uninsured.Physicians for a National Health Program (2008) \\"Single Payer System Cost?\\" PNHP.org Canadian physicians, who provide universal health care including preventative care, found that they could lower their total health care expenditures by 40% simply by increasing appropriate and reducing inappropriate preventative care measures. A single uninsured cancer patient diagnosed at stage four can incur over half a million dollars in hospital bills in a few months, which must be borne by all other health care consumers, when the same diagnosis at stage one with preventative screening would cost much less.Nicholas Kristof (October 17, 2012) \\"Scott‚Äôs Story and the Election\\" New York Times However, preventive care is typically provided to many people who would never become ill, and for those who would have become ill, it is partially offset by the health care costs during additional years of life.David Brown, \\"In the Balance: Some Candidates Disagree, but Studies Show It's Often Cheaper To Let People Get Sick,\\" The Washington Post, April 8, 2008 Preventing obesity and overweight conditions presents a significant opportunity to reduce costs. The Centers for Disease Control reported that approximately 9% of healthcare costs in 1998 were attributable to overweight and obesity, or as much as $92.6 billion in 2002 dollars. Nearly half of these costs were paid for by the government via Medicare or Medicaid. However, by 2008 the CDC estimated these costs had nearly doubled to $147 billion. The CDC identified a series of expensive conditions more likely to occur due to obesity. The CDC released a series of strategies to prevent obesity and overweight, including: making healthy foods and beverages more available; supporting healthy food choices; encouraging kids to be more active; and creating safe communities to support physical activity. An estimated 25.6% of U.S. adults in 2007 were obese, versus 23.9% in 2005. State obesity rates ranged from 18.7% to 30%. Obesity rates were roughly equal among men and women. Some have proposed a so-called \\"fat tax\\" to provide incentives for healthier behavior, either by levying the tax on products (such as soft drinks) that are thought to contribute to obesity, or to individuals based on body measures, as they do in Japan. A study released in October, 2010 had a similar cost estimate, of $168 billion, nearly 17% of U.S. medical costs. This is an estimated $2,400 per obese person. The study was performed by researchers at Cornell and Emory universities. However, in contrast to yearly costs, lifetime costs can be highest among healthy people, who live longer. One study in the Netherlands indicated that: \\"Until the age of 56, yearly health costs were highest for obese people and lowest for healthy-living people. At older ages, the highest yearly costs were incurred by the smoking group. However, because of differences in life expectancy (life expectancy at age 20 was 5 years less for the obese group, and 8 years less for the smoking group, compared to the healthy-living group), total lifetime health spending was greatest for the healthy-living people, lowest for the smokers, and intermediate for the obese people.\\" Eliminate unnecessary tests During April 2012, nine physician groups identified 45 tests that were commonly used but that provided no proven benefits to patients or could actually be harmful. This was done at the urging of a Dr. Howard Brody, who published this recommendation in a 2010 article. The nine groups (medical societies) developed the lists after months of analyses and reviews of the medical literature by expert committees. The New York Times editorial board wrote: \\"Eliminating needless care is not rationing. It is sound medicine and sound economics.\\"NYT-Do You Need that Test? April 2012 One July 2012 proposal advocated that consumers of healthcare always have \\"skin in the game\\" such that their costs rise as more services are provided. Address expensive chronic cases The CBO reported in May 2005: \\"Medicare spending is highly concentrated, with a small number of beneficiaries accounting for a large proportion of the Medicare program's annual expenditures. In 2001, the costliest 5 percent of beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare's fee-for-service (FFS) sector accounted for 43 percent of total spending, while the costliest 25 percent...accounted for fully 85 percent of spending...These high-cost beneficiaries, compared with beneficiaries in the bottom 75 percent in terms of their spending, were slightly older, more likely to suffer from chronic conditions, such as coronary artery disease and diabetes, and more likely to die in a given year.\\" Such concentration offers opportunities to focus on key ailments and treatment approaches. Peter Orszag wrote in May 2011: \\"The truth is that constraining future health care costs will require a variety of approaches, but in particular it will mean improving the information that providers have about their patients and best practices, and the incentives that providers are given to deliver better care, especially in expensive cases.\\" Market-based solutions Privatize Medicare with a voucher system Rep. Paul Ryan (R) has proposed the Roadmap for America's Future, which is a series of budgetary reforms. His January 2010 version of the plan includes the transition of Medicare to a voucher system, meaning individuals would receive a voucher which could be used to purchase health insurance in the private market. This would not affect those near retirement or currently enrolled in Medicare. A series of graphs and charts summarizing the impact of the plan are included. Economists have both praised and criticized particular features of the plan. The CBO also partially scored the bill. Medicaid recipients could also be provided with tax credits or subsidies to purchase their own private insurance, reducing incentives for them to remain in the program.NYT-David Brooks-A Choice, Not a Whine-July 2012 Insurance company antitrust reforms Some conservatives advocate free market reforms such as breaking up state monopolies on insurance and licensing and allowing consumers to purchase health insurance licensed by other states. The GAO reported in 2002 (using 2000 data) the following statistics regarding insurance competition in state markets: \\"The median number of licensed carriers in the small group market per state was 28, with a range from 4 in Hawaii to 77 in Indiana. The median market share of the largest carrier was about 33 percent, with a range from about 14 percent in Texas to about 89 percent in North Dakota. The five largest carriers, when combined, represented three-quarters or more of the market in 19 of the 34 states supplying information, and they represented more than 90 percent in 7 of these states. Twenty-five of 37 states supplying information identified a Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) carrier as the largest carrier offering health insurance in the small group market, and in all but one of the remaining 12 states, a BCBS carrier was among the five largest. The median market share of all the BCBS carriers in the 34 states supplying information was about 34 percent, with a range from about 3 percent in Vermont to about 89 percent in North Dakota; in 9 of these states BCBS carriers combined for half or more of the market.\\" The GAO reported in 2008 (using 2007 data for the most part) the following statistics: \\"The median number of licensed carriers in the small group market per state was 27. The median market share of the largest carrier in the small group market was about 47 percent, with a range from about 21 percent in Arizona to about 96 percent in Alabama. In 31 of the 39 states supplying market share information, the top carrier had a market share of a third or more. The five largest carriers in the small group market, when combined, represented three quarters or more of the market in 34 of the 39 states supplying this information, and they represented 90 percent or more in 23 of these states. Thirty-six of the 44 states supplying information on the top carrier identified a Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) carrier as the largest carrier, and in all but 1 of the remaining 8 states, a BCBS carrier was among the five largest carriers. The median market share of all the BCBS carriers in the 38 states supplying this information was about 51 percent, with a range of less than 5 percent in Vermont and Wisconsin and more than 90 percent in Alabama and North Dakota...the median market share of all the BCBS carriers in 38 states reporting this information in 2008 was about 51 percent, compared to the 44 percent reported in 2005 and the 34 percent reported in 2002 for the 34 states supplying information in each of these years.\\" Economist Paul Krugman argued that allowing interstate competition would create a \\"race to the bottom,\\" in which \\"[t]he states with the weakest regulations ‚Äì for example, those that allow insurance companies to deny coverage to victims of domestic violence ‚Äì would set the standards for the nation as a whole. The result would be to afflict the afflicted, to make the lives of Americans with pre-existing conditions even harder.\\" Reform of doctor's incentives Critics have argued that the healthcare system has several incentives that drive costly behavior. Two of these include: #Doctors are typically paid for services provided rather than with a salary. This provides a financial incentive to increase the costs of treatment provided. #Patients that are fully insured have no financial incentive to minimize the cost when choosing among alternatives. The overall effect is to increase insurance premiums for all. Gawande argued: \\"Our fee-for-service system, doling out separate payments for everything and everyone involved in a patient‚Äôs care, has all the wrong incentives: it rewards doing more over doing right, it increases paperwork and the duplication of efforts, and it discourages clinicians from working together for the best possible results.\\" Gawande quoted one surgeon who stated: \\"We took a wrong turn when doctors stopped being doctors and became businessmen.\\" Gawande identified various revenue-enhancing approaches and profit-based incentives that doctors were using in high-cost areas that may have caused the over-utilization of healthcare. He contrasted this with lower- cost areas that used salaried doctors and other techniques to reward value, referring to this as a \\"battle for the soul of American medicine.\\" One option involves an integrated series of healthcare providers charging a premium or flat fee to patients to participate in the network, rather than a fee for each individual service. This modifies the doctor's incentive from ordering more services to solving the problem efficiently (i.e., more care to more cost- efficient care). The provider network would also purchase insurance for catastrophic (extremely high cost) cases.Atlantic-Philip K. Howard-Beyond Obamacare: How to Fix our Enormous, Inefficient Healthcare System-May 2012 Medical malpractice liability costs and tort reform Critics have argued that medical malpractice costs (insurance and lawsuits, for example) are significant and should be addressed via tort reform.Realclearmarkets.com RCP- Roth-The High Cost of Medical Malpractice-August 2009 How much these costs are is a matter of debate. Some have argued that malpractice lawsuits are a major driver of medical costs. A 2005 study estimated the cost around 0.2%, and in 2009 insurer WellPoint Inc. said \\"liability wasn‚Äôt driving premiums.\\" A 2006 study found neurologists in the United States ordered more tests in theoretical clinical situations posed than their German counterparts; U.S. clinicians are more likely to fear litigation which may be due to the teaching of defensive strategies which are reported more often in U.S. teaching programs. Counting both direct and indirect costs, other studies estimate the total cost of malpractice \\"is linked to\\" between 5% and 10% of total U.S. medical costs. A 2004 report by the Congressional Budget Office put medical malpractice costs at 2 percent of U.S. health spending and \\"even significant reductions\\" would do little to reduce the growth of health care expenses. A 2009 CBO report estimated that approximately $54 billion could be saved over ten years by limiting medical malpractice lawsuits. A tort reform package that includes caps on jury awards of $500,000 for punitive damages and $250,000 for \\"pain and suffering\\" damages would lower liability insurance premiums by about 10 percent. In August 2009, physician and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean explained why tort reform was omitted from the Congressional health care reform bills then under consideration: \\"When you go to pass a really enormous bill like that, the more stuff you put in it, the more enemies you make, right?...And the reason tort reform is not on the bill is because the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition to everybody else they were taking on. That is the plain and simple truth.\\"Realclearpolitics.com RCP-Roundtable on Health Reform Costs- August 2009 Others have argued that even successful tort reform might not lead to lower aggregate liability. For example, the current contingent fee system skews litigation towards high-value cases while ignoring meritorious small cases; aligning litigation more closely with merit might thus increase the number of small awards, offsetting any reduction in large awards. A New York study found that only 1.5% of hospital negligence led to claims; moreover, the CBO observed that \\"health care providers are generally not exposed to the financial cost of their own malpractice risk because they carry liability insurance, and the premiums for that insurance do not reflect the records or practice styles of individual providers but more-general factors such as location and medical specialty.\\" Given that total liability is small relative to the amount doctors pay in malpractice insurance premiums, alternative mechanisms have been proposed to reform malpractice insurance. In 2004, the CBO studied restrictions on malpractice awards proposed by the George W. Bush Administration and members of Congress; CBO concluded that \\"the evidence available to date does not make a strong case that restricting malpractice liability would have a significant effect, either positive or negative, on economic efficiency.\\" Empirical data and reporting have since shown that some of the highest medical costs are now in states where tort reform had already caused malpractice premiums and lawsuits to drop substantially; unnecessary and injurious procedures are instead caused by a system \\"often driven to maximize revenues over patient needs.\\" One option proposed includes specialized healthcare courts rather than the jury system. Such courts exist in other disciplines. In administrative health courts, an expert judge would decide cases based on best medical practice, writing an opinion that is subject to appeal to an appellate health court. There would also be a requirement of full disclosure by hospitals, and all facts would be fed back into the health care system so providers learn from their mistakes. Such an approach has been opposed by trial lawyer lobbyists.The Atlantic-Beyond Obamacare: How to Fix Our Enormous, Inefficient Health-Care System-Philip K. Howard-May 2012 Addressing the shortage of doctors and nurses The U.S. is facing shortages of doctors and nurses that are projected to grow worse as America ages, which may drive up the price of these services. Writing in the Washington Post, cardiologist Arthur Feldman cited various studies that indicate the U.S. is facing a \\"critical\\" shortage of doctors, including an estimated 1,300 general surgeons by 2010. The American Academy of Family Physicians predicts a shortage of 40,000 primary care doctors (including family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics/gynecology) by 2020. The number of medical students choosing the primary care specialty has dropped by 52% since 1997. Currently, only 2% of medical school graduates choose primary care as a career. An amendment to the Senate health bill includes $2 billion in funds over 10 years to create 2,000 new residency training slots geared toward primary care medicine and general surgery. Writing in Forbes, a physician argued that this is a \\"tiny band-aid at best,\\" advocating full loan repayments and guaranteed positions upon graduation. Physicians wrote a NYT Op Ed in May 2011 stating that doctors typically graduate with an average of $155,000 in debt from Medical school, with over 80% owing debt of some type. This drives some doctors into higher paying specialties as opposed to primary care. As specialists, they prescribe more expensive treatments. About $2.5 billion/year would be required to make Medical school free, which the writers estimated at one-thousandth the total annual healthcare costs. Making medical school free would help address the shortage in their view.Why Medical School Should be Free-NYT- The U.S. had 2.3 doctors per 1,000 people in 2002, ranking 52nd. Germany and France had approximately 3.4 and ranked in the top 25.NationMaster.com-Retrieved December 4, 2009 The OECD average in 2008 was 3.1 doctors per 1,000 people, while the U.S. had 2.4. The American Association of Colleges of Nurses cited studies estimating that a shortage of registered nurses would reach 230,000 by 2025 as America ages, with over 135,000 open positions during 2007. An additional 30% more nurses would have to graduate annually to keep up with demand. A study by Price Waterhouse advanced several strategies for addressing the nursing shortage, including developing more public-private partnerships, federal and state-level grants for nursing students and educators, creating healthy work environments, using technology as a training tool, and designing more flexible roles for advanced practice nurses given their increased use as primary care providers. Newsweek wrote: \\"Lately, some policymakers have argued that instead of having a primary-care doctor, more people‚Äîespecially young, healthy patients with simple medical needs‚Äîshould see a nurse or physician assistant who administers routine care and kicks more complex problems up to a doctor when they arise. 'If you're just coming in to have your blood pressure checked and your pulse taken, you really don't need to see a doctor, and you might not need to see a nurse, either,' says David Barrett, president and CEO of the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Mass. \\"There are three-stripe military sergeants with two-year degrees who can provide excellent primary care. There's absolutely no reason to force all primary-care providers to have an M.D.\\" Tax reform Health insurance premiums paid on behalf of workers are increasingly offsetting compensation The Congressional Budget Office has described how the tax treatment of insurance premiums may affect behavior: Peter Singer wrote in the New York Times that the current exclusion of insurance premiums from compensation represents a $200 billion subsidy for the private insurance industry and that it would likely not exist without it. In November 2009, The Economist estimated that taxing employer-provided health insurance (which is presently exempt from tax) would add $215 billion per year to federal tax revenue. Employer-provided health insurance receives uncapped tax benefits. According to the OECD, it \\"encourages the purchase of more generous insurance plans, notably plans with little cost sharing, thus exacerbating moral hazard\\". Consumers want unfettered access to medical services; they also prefer to pay through insurance or tax rather than out of pocket. These two needs create cost-efficiency challenges for health care. Some studies have found no consistent and systematic relationship between the type of financing of health care and cost containment. Some have proposed an \\"excise tax\\" for high cost 'Cadillac' insurance plans. A study published in Health Affairs in December 2009 found that high-cost health plans do not provide unusually rich benefits to enrollees. The researchers found that only 3.7% of the variation in the cost of family coverage in employer-sponsored health plans is attributable to differences in the actuarial value of benefits. Only 6.1% of the variation is attributable to the combination of benefit design and plan type (e.g., PPO, HMO, etc.). The employer's industry and regional variations in health care cost explain part of the variation, but most is unexplained. The researchers conclude \\". . . that analysts should not equate high-cost plans with Cadillac plans, . . . [w]ithout appropriate adjustments, a simple cap may exacerbate rather than ameliorate current inequities\\" Premium tax subsidies to help individuals purchase their own health insurance have also been suggested as a way to increase coverage rates. Research confirms that consumers in the individual health insurance market are sensitive to price. It appears that price sensitivity varies among population subgroups and is generally higher for younger individuals and lower income individuals. However, research also suggests that subsidies alone are unlikely to solve the uninsured problem in the U.S.\\"The Price Sensitivity of Demand for Nongroup Health Insurance,\\" Congressional Budget Office, 2005M.

The Office of Management and Budget reported that $54 billion in \\"improper payments\\" were made to Medicare ($24B), Medicaid ($18B) and Medicaid Advantage ($12B) during FY2009. This was 9.4% of the $573 billion spent in these categories. GAO reported in 2000: \\"The Department of Health and Human Services‚Äô Office of Inspector General has reported that $13.5 billion of processed Medicare fee-for-service claim payments for fiscal year 1999 may have been improperly paid for reasons that ranged from inadvertent error to outright fraud and abuse.\\" Fewer than 5% of Medicare claims are audited.Carrie Johnson, \\"Medical Fraud a Growing Problem: Medicare Pays Most Claims Without Review,\\" The Washington Post, June 13, 2008 CBO reported in October 2014 that it is difficult to quantify healthcare fraud related to government programs. CBO reported that: \\"According to HHS, since 2009 the HEAT Medicare task force has filed criminal and civil charges against more than 1,700 defendants who falsely billed the Medicare program for more than $5.5 billion.\\" However, false billing is a partial measure of fraud, as much of it is undetected.CBO- How Initiatives to Reduce Fraud in Federal Health Care Programs Affect the Budget-October 2014 According to CBS News, Medicare fraud accounts for an estimated $60 billion in Medicare payments each year, and \\"has become one of, if not the most profitable, crimes in America.\\" Criminals set up phony companies, then invoice Medicare for fraudulent services provided to valid Medicare patients who never receive the services. These costs appear on the Medicare statements provided to Medicare card holders. The program pays out over $430 billion per year via over 1 billion claims, making enforcement challenging. Its enforcement budget is \\"extremely limited\\" according to one Medicare official. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in an interview: \\"Clearly more auditing needs to be done and it needs to be done in real time.\\" The Obama administration is providing Medicare with an additional $200 million to fight fraud as part of its stimulus package, and billions of dollars to computerize medical records and upgrade networks, which should assist Medicare in identifying fraudulent claims.Ira Rosen and Joel Bach, producers, CBS-60 Minutes-Medicare Fraud-A $60 Trillion Business, CBS News, October 25, 2009 During July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010, citing approximately $110 billion in unauthorized payments of all types, including Medicare and Medicaid. President Obama has directed his administration to reduce these payments by $50 million annually by 2012, less than 1%. Coverage mandates Reforming or restructuring the private health insurance market is often suggested as a means for achieving health care reform in the U.S. Insurance market reform has the potential to increase the number of Americans with insurance, but is unlikely to significantly reduce the rate of growth in health care spending. Careful consideration of basic insurance principles is important when considering insurance market reform, in order to avoid unanticipated consequences and ensure the long-term viability of the reformed system.Uninsured Work Group, 'Fundamentals of Insurance: Implications for Health Coverage,\\" Issue Brief, American Academy of Actuaries, July 2008 According to one study conducted by the Urban Institute, if not implemented on a systematic basis with appropriate safeguards, market reform has the potential to cause more problems than it solves.Linda J. Blumberg and Len Nichols, \\"Health Insurance Market Reforms: What They Can and Cannot Do,\\" Urban Institute, November 1, 1995 Since most Americans with private coverage receive it through employer-sponsored plans, many have suggested employer \\"pay or play\\" requirements as a way to increase coverage levels (i.e., employers that do not provide insurance would have to pay a tax instead). However, research suggests that current pay or play proposals are limited in their ability to increase coverage among the working poor. These proposals generally exclude small firms, do not distinguish between individuals who have access to other forms of coverage and those who do not, and increase the overall compensation costs to employers.Richard Burkhauser and Kosali Simon, \\"The Economics of \\"Pay or Play\\" Employer Mandates: Who Gets What From Employer \\"Pay or Play\\" Mandates,\\" Employment Policies Institute, November 2007 In October 2009 the Wall Street Journal reported that while requirements to purchase health insurance were central to proposals in both the House and Senate, these coverage mandates were \\"under fire from both ends of the political spectrum, with some liberals saying the penalties are too harsh for those who refuse and conservatives denouncing the whole concept.\\"Janet Adamy and Greg Hitt, \\"Insurance Mandates Draw Flak From Both Sides,\\" The Wall Street Journal, October 10, 2009 According to the article, however, \\"[h]ealth-policy experts . . .say there is a good reason for the mandate.\\" Proposed reforms would prohibit health insurers from denying coverage to individuals with pre- existing medical conditions. Insurers said that, to keep premiums from rising for everyone, it is necessary for healthier people to pay into the insurance pools to balance out the cost of these higher cost individuals. Arguing against requiring individuals to buy coverage, the Cato Institute has asserted that the Massachusetts law forcing everyone to buy insurance has increased costs: \\"Premiums are growing 21 to 46 percent faster than the national average, in part because Massachusetts' individual mandate has effectively outlawed affordable health plans.\\"Michael F. Cannon, Massachusetts' Obama-like Reforms Increase Health Costs, Wait Times, Cato Institute, Reprint of article that appeared in the Detroit News on August 27, 2009 (accessed October 16, 2009) They say that \\"the mandate gives politicians enormous power to dictate the content of every American's health plan ‚Äì a power that health care providers inevitably capture and use to increase the required level of insurance\\" and state that providers were successful in persuading legislators to include an additional 16 benefit mandates in the required benefit package during the first three years after the coverage mandate was enacted. They also say that by prohibiting the use of health status in pricing, the Massachusetts law \\"further increase[s] premiums for the young and healthy\\" and, as the result of adverse selection, drives more comprehensive health plans out of the market. The conclusion they draw is that \\"[T]he most sweeping provision . . . is an 'individual mandate' that makes health insurance compulsory. Massachusetts shows that such a mandate would oust millions from their low- cost health plans and force them to pay higher premiums.\\" Writing in the New York Times opinion blog \\"Room for Debate\\" the single-payer health care advocate Marcia Angell, former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, said that a coverage mandate would not be necessary within a single- payer system and that even within the context of current system she was \\"troubled by the notion of an individual mandate.\\" She described the Massachusetts mandates as \\"a windfall for the insurance industry\\" and wrote, \\"Premiums are rising much faster than income, benefit packages are getting skimpier, and deductibles and co-payments are going up.\\"The Editors, \\"Should Health Insurance Be Mandatory?,\\" \\"Room for Debate\\" opinion blog, The New York Times, June 4, 2009 In April 2009 the Boston Globe reported that the number of people seeking emergency room care and the cost of emergency room visits increased after the 2006 mandates went into effect (comparing 2005 to 2007).Liz Kowalczyk, \\"ER visits, costs in Mass. climb: Questions raised about healthcare law's impact on overuse,\\" The Boston Globe, April 24, 2009 The number of visits increased by 7% during that period, while costs rose by 17%. State officials cautioned that it was too early to determine if the state's new coverage mandate had failed to reduce the emergency room use, but several physicians and policymakers said that it was unlikely that a coverage mandate alone could solve the problems of emergency room crowding and overuse. In August 2009 the Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts had \\"the most expensive family health insurance premiums in the country.\\" Premiums in Massachusetts increased by 40 percent from 2003 to 2008, compared to a national average increase of 33%. The report did not break out the amount of the increase since 2006, but as the Massachusetts reforms are often taken as a model for national reform, \\"advocates on various sides of the issue said the report underscores the urgency of including cost controls in any large-scale federal or state overhaul.\\"Kay Lazar, \\"Bay State health insurance premiums highest in country: Rein in health costs, Massachusetts urged,\\" The Boston Globe, August 22, 2009 Karen Davenport, director of health policy at the Center for American Progress, has argued that \\"before making coverage mandatory, we need to reform the health insurance market, strengthen public health insurance programs, and finance premium subsidies for people who can‚Äôt afford coverage on their own.\\" Addressing the issue when it was proposed in 1994, CBO wrote: \\"A mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action. The government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the United States.\\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/48xx/doc4816/doc38.pdf There is also disagreement as to whether federal mandates would be constitutional, and state initiatives opposing federal mandates may lead to litigation and delay. On June 28, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate provision as Constitutional. Rationing of care President Barack Obama argues that U.S. healthcare is rationed, based on income, type of employment, and pre- existing medical conditions, with nearly 46 million uninsured. He argues that millions of Americans are denied coverage or face higher premiums as a result of pre-existing medical conditions. Peter Singer and David Leonhardt have each separately noted that health care rationing is not a choice, but an economic necessity. All health care resources are finite and have to be allocated in some way or other. The issue is which way is the most sensible way to do it. Former Republican Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson has also argued that some form of rationing is inevitable and desirable considering the state of U.S. finances and the trillions of dollars of unfunded Medicare liabilities. He estimated that 25‚Äì33% of healthcare services are provided to those in the last months or year of life and advocated restrictions in cases where quality of life cannot be improved. He also recommended that a budget be established for government healthcare expenses, through establishing spending caps and pay-as-you-go rules that require tax increases for any incremental spending. He has indicated that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be required. All of these issues would be addressed under the aegis of a fiscal reform commission. Rationing by price means accepting that there is no triage according to need. Thus in the private sector it is accepted that some people get expensive surgeries such as liver transplants or non life-threatening ones such as cosmetic surgery, when others fail to get cheaper and much more cost effective care such as prenatal care, which could save the lives of many fetuses and newborn children. Some places, like Oregon for example, do explicitly ration Medicaid resources using medical priorities. Politicians on the right tend to be fearful of democratically elected governments becoming involved in rationing decision. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) argued that the reform plans supported by President Obama expand the control of government over healthcare decisions, which he referred to as a type of healthcare rationing. Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) makes similar arguments claiming for example that people like the late Senator Edward Kennedy received health care in the U.S. that would have been denied in countries which have government controlled health care, a claim that The Economist magazine said was \\"dangerous\\" and went on to say that \\"The reality is that America, like Britain, already makes extensive use of rationing. Better usage of healthcare technology Automation of patient records The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that increased use of health information technology has great potential to significantly reduce overall health care spending and realize large improvements in health care quality providing that the system is integrated. The use of health IT in an unintegrated setting will not realize all the projected savings.U.S. Congressional Budget Office, \\"Evidence on the Costs and Benefits of Health Information Technology,\\" Pub. No. 2976, May 2008 Treatment registries One application of healthcare technology is the creation of registries or databases to relate treatments to outcomes. Useful treatments could be identified and those less useful could be avoided to reduce costs.Bloomberg-Peter Orszag-Smart Health-Care Strategy Hidden in 'Cliff‚Äô Deal-January 9, 2013 Payment system reform The payment system refers to the billing and payment for medical services, which is distinct from the delivery system through which the services are provided. The over 1,300 U.S. health insurance companies have different forms and processes for billing and reimbursement, requiring enormous costs on the part of service providers (mainly doctors and hospitals) to process payments. For example, the Cleveland Clinic, considered a low-cost, best-practices hospital system, has 1,400 billing clerks to support 2,000 doctors. Further, the insurance companies have their own overhead functions and profit margins, much of which could be eliminated with a single payer system. Economist Paul Krugman estimated in 2005 that converting from the current private insurance system to a single-payer system would enable $200 billion per year in cost savings, primarily via insurance company overhead. One advocacy group estimated savings as high as $400 billion annually for 2009 and beyond. Proponents of health care reform argue that moving to a single-payer system would reallocate the money currently spent on the administrative overhead required to run the hundredsThe trade association AHIP , America's Health Insurance Plans, has some 1,300 members. of insurance companies in the U.S. to provide universal care.\\"The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It\\" By Paul Krugman, Robin Wells, New York Review of Books, March 23, 2006 An often-cited study by Harvard Medical School and the Canadian Institute for Health Information determined that some 31 percent of U.S. health care dollars, or more than $1,000 per person per year, went to health care administrative costs.Costs of Health Administration in the U.S. and Canada, Woolhandler, et al., NEJM 349(8) Sept. 21, 2003 Other estimates are lower. One study of the billing and insurance-related (BIR) costs borne not only by insurers but also by physicians and hospitals found that BIR among insurers, physicians, and hospitals in California represented 20‚Äì22% of privately insured spending in California acute care settings. Advocates of \\"single-payer\\" argue that shifting the U.S. to a single-payer health care system would provide universal coverage, give patients free choice of providers and hospitals, and guarantee comprehensive coverage and equal access for all medically necessary procedures, without increasing overall spending. Shifting to a single-payer system, by this view, would also eliminate oversight by managed care reviewers, restoring the traditional doctor-patient relationship.Physicians for a National Health Program. \\"What is Single Payer?\\" Among the organizations in support of single-payer health care in the U.S. is Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP), an organization of some 17,000 American physicians, medical students, and health professionals. Reduce costs of imaging technology During 2009, Medicare spent $11.7 billion for medical imaging, such as CT scans and MRI's. From 2005 to 2009, usage of scans grew at an annual rate of 14%, but may have slowed since due to a combination of changing incentives and saturation of usage. Initially, demanding patients insisted on scans; doctors feared malpractice suits if they refused; and doctors and hospitals wanted to maximize revenues. One study indicated that changing incentives may have reduced cost growth. From 2006 to 2010, the share of workers with deductibles exceeding $1,000 grew from 10 percent to 27 percent. Increased out-of-pocket expenses have made patients and physicians more cost conscious. Further, a combination of prior notification, higher patient co-payments and restrained reimbursements may have contributed to slowing cost growth.Washington Post-Samuelson-Curbing the Costs of High-Tech Health-July 2012 Motivation Medicare and Medicaid Spending as % GDP (data from the CBO) International comparisons of healthcare have found that the United States spends more per-capita than other similarly developed nations but falls below similar countries in various health metrics, suggesting inefficiency and waste. In addition, the United States has significant underinsurance and significant impending unfunded liabilities from its aging demographic and its social insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid (Medicaid provides free long-term care to the elderly poor). The fiscal and human impact of these issues have motivated reform proposals. PPP-adjusted, compared amongst various first world nations. According to 2009 World Bank statistics, the U.S. had the highest healthcare costs relative to the size of the economy (GDP) in the world, even though estimated 50.2 million citizens (approximately 15.6% of the September 2011 estimated population of 312 million) lacked insurance. In March 2010, billionaire Warren Buffett commented that the high costs paid by U.S. companies for their employees' health care put them at a competitive disadvantage. Life expectancy compared to healthcare spending from 1970 to 2008, in the US and the next 19 most wealthy countries by total GDP. Further, an estimated 77 million Baby Boomers are reaching retirement age, which combined with significant annual increases in healthcare costs per person will place enormous budgetary strain on U.S. state and federal governments, particularly through Medicare and Medicaid spending (Medicaid provides long-term care for the elderly poor). Maintaining the long- term fiscal health of the U.S. federal government is significantly dependent on healthcare costs being controlled. Insurance cost and availability In addition, the number of employers who offer health insurance has declined and costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising: from 2001 to 2007, premiums for family coverage increased 78%, while wages rose 19% and prices rose 17%, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Even for those who are employed, the private insurance in the US varies greatly in its coverage; one study by the Commonwealth Fund published in Health Affairs estimated that 16 million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003. The underinsured were significantly more likely than those with adequate insurance to forgo health care, report financial stress because of medical bills, and experience coverage gaps for such items as prescription drugs. The study found that underinsurance disproportionately affects those with lower incomes ‚Äî 73% of the underinsured in the study population had annual incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level. However, a study published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2008 found that the typical large employer preferred provider organization (PPO) plan in 2007 was more generous than either Medicare or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Standard Option.Dale Yamamoto, Tricia Neuman and Michelle Kitchman Strollo, How Does the Benefit Value of Medicare Compare to the Benefit Value of Typical Large Employer Plans?, Kaiser Family Foundation, September 2008 One indicator of the consequences of Americans' inconsistent health care coverage is a study in Health Affairs that concluded that half of personal bankruptcys involved medical bills, although other sources dispute this.Todd Zywicki, \\"An Economic Analysis of the Consumer Bankruptcy Crisis\\", 99 NWU L. Rev. 1463 (2005) There are health losses from insufficient health insurance. A 2009 study found more than 44,800 excess deaths annually in the United States due to Americans lacking health insurance. More broadly, estimates of the total number of people in the United States, whether insured or uninsured, who die because of lack of medical care were estimated in a 1997 analysis to be nearly 100,000 per year.A 1997 study carried out by Professors David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler (New England Journal of Medicine 336, no. 11 1997) \\"concluded that almost 100,000 people died in the United States each year because of lack of needed care‚Äîthree times the number of people who died of AIDs.\\" The Inhuman State of U.S. Health Care, Monthly Review, Vicente Navarro, September 2003. Retrieved September 10, 2009 A study of the effects of the Massachusetts universal health care law (which took effect in 2006) found a 3% drop in mortality among people 20‚Äì64 years old - 1 death per 830 people with insurance. Other studies, just as those examining the randomized distribution of Medicaid insurance to low-income people in Oregon in 2008, found no change in death rate. The cost of insurance has been a primary motivation in the reform of the US healthcare system, and many different explanations have been proposed in the reasons for high insurance costs and how to remedy them. One critique and motivation for healthcare reform has been the development of the medical‚Äìindustrial complex. This relates to moral arguments for health care reform, framing healthcare as a social good, one that is fundamentally immoral to deny to people based on economic status. The motivation behind healthcare reform in response to the medical-industrial complex also stems from issues of social inequity, promotion of medicine over preventative care. The medical-industrial complex, defined as a network of health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and the like, plays a role in the complexity of the US insurance market and a fine line between government and industry within it. Likewise, critiques of insurance markets being conducted under a capitalistic, free-market model also include that medical solutions, as opposed to preventative healthcare measures, are promoted to maintain this medical-industrial complex. Arguments for a market-based approach to health insurance include the Grossman model, which is based on an ideal competitive model, but others have critiqued this, arguing that fundamentally, this means that people in higher socioeconomic levels will receive a better quality of healthcare. Uninsured rate Another concern is the rate of uninsured people in the US. In June 2014, Gallup‚ÄìHealthways Well‚ÄìBeing conducted a survey and found that the uninsured rate is going down. 13.4 percent of U.S. adults are uninsured in 2014. This is a decrease from the percentage at 17.1 percent in January 2014 and translates to roughly 10 million to 11 million individuals who gained coverage. The survey also looked at the major demographic groups and found each is making progress towards getting health insurance. However, Hispanics, who have the highest uninsured rate of any racial or ethnic group, are lagging in their progress. Under the new health care reform, Latinos were expected to be major beneficiaries of the new health care law. Gallup found that the biggest drop in the uninsured rate (2.8 percentage points) was among households making less than $36,000 a year. Waste and fraud In December 2011 the outgoing Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Donald Berwick, asserted that 20% to 30% of health care spending is waste. He listed five causes for the waste: (1) overtreatment of patients, (2) the failure to coordinate care, (3) the administrative complexity of the health care system, (4) burdensome rules and (5) fraud. An estimated 3%‚Äì10% of all health care expenditures in the U.S. are fraudulent. In 2011, Medicare and Medicaid made $65 billion in improper payments (including both error and fraud). Government efforts to reduce fraud include $4.2 billion in fraudulent payments recovered by the Department of Justice and the FBI in 2012, longer jail sentences specified by the Affordable Care Act, and Senior Medicare Patrols‚Äîvolunteers trained to identify and report fraud. International comparisons The International Federation of Health Plans provides a comparative annual survey of costs for drugs, devices and medical services across countries. According to their 2013 report, the U.S. pays considerably more than other countries in 22 of 23 categories. For example, the average cost of a hip replacement in the U.S. was $40,364, with other countries ranging from $3,365 (Argentina) to $27,810 (Australia). An MRI averaged $1,121 in the U.S. versus $280 in France.Washington Post-Ezra Klein-21 graphs that show America‚Äôs health-care prices are ludicrous-March 2013 The reasons for these differences are driven by higher prices per unit of service, rather than a higher volume of usage. In other countries, governments intervene more forcefully in setting prices. In countries such as Canada and Britain, prices are set by the government. In others, such as Germany and Japan, they‚Äôre set by providers and insurers sitting in a room and coming to an agreement, with the government stepping in to set prices if they fail.Washington Post-Ezra Klein-Why an MRI costs $1,080 in America and $280 in France-March 15, 2013 Other topics Importation of prescription drugs Congressional proponents argue that drugs manufactured overseas by U.S. companies could be imported and purchased more cheaply in the U.S. Drug manufacturers argue that certain foreign countries have price controls, which they recoup by charging higher prices in the U.S. Whitehouse spokesman Robert Gibbs said President Obama is supportive of importing drugs, provided safety concerns related to the drugs can be addressed. This is because drugs manufactured outside the country may be held to different standards. According to Bloomberg News, drugmakers agreed in June 2009 to contribute $80 billion over 10 years, largely to help the elderly afford medicines, in return for staving off other profit-endangering proposals such as drug importation.

The WBDOSS receives data about waterborne disease outbreaks and single cases of waterborne diseases of public health importance (for example, Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM)) in the United States and then disseminates information about these diseases, outbreaks, and their causes. WBDOSS was initiated in 1971 by CDC, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Data are reported by public health departments in individual states, territories, and the Freely Associated States (composed of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Palau; formerly parts of the U.S.-administered Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands). Although initially designed to collect data about drinking water outbreaks in the United States, WBDOSS now includes outbreaks associated with recreational water, as well as outbreaks associated with water that is not intended for drinking (non-recreational) and water for which the intended use is unknown.Yoder J, Hlavsa M, Craun GF, et al.

MMWR; 57(No. SS-9): 39-69. Definition of a Waterborne Disease Outbreak Waterborne disease outbreaks may be associated with recreational water, water intended for drinking, water not intended for drinking (non-recreational water, for example, from cooling towers or ornamental fountains) and water of unknown intent. In order for a waterborne disease outbreak to be included in WBDOSS there must be an epidemiologic link between two or more persons that includes a location of water exposure, a clearly defined time period for the water exposure, and one or more waterborne illnesses caused by pathogens such as bacteria, parasites and viruses, or by chemicals/toxins. Common routes of exposure to waterborne pathogens include swallowing contaminated water, inhaling water droplets or airborne chemicals from the water, and direct physical contact with contaminated water. Epidemiologic evidence must implicate water or volatile compounds from the water that have entered the air as the probable source of the illness. WBDOSS outbreaks are further evaluated and classified based on the strength of evidence in the outbreak report that implicates water as the source of the outbreak. Waterborne disease outbreaks that have both strong epidemiologic data and comprehensive water-quality testing data are assigned a higher class than outbreaks with weak epidemiologic data and little or no water-quality testing data. Data Sources for WBDOSS Public health departments investigate waterborne disease outbreaks in states, territories, and Freely Associated States and are essential contributors to the WBDOSS. The primary reporting tool for WBDOSS prior to 2009 was the CDC 52.12 waterborne disease outbreak reporting form. Beginning in 2009, this form was replaced by the electronic National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS). Secondary data sources include case reports of water- associated cases of PAM caused by Naegleria fowleri infections, case reports for chemical/toxin poisoning and wound infections (reported sporadically), data about recreational water-associated Vibrio cases from the Cholera and Other Vibrio Surveillance System, and case reports for pool chemical-related health events not associated with recreational water (reported sporadically. Data Use CDC has published WBDOSS surveillance summaries on an annual or biennial basis since 1971. Summary statistics and descriptions of waterborne disease outbreaks were published in CDC reports until 1984 and have been published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) since 1985. Public health researchers and policy makers use the data to understand and reduce waterborne disease and outbreaks. WBDOSS data are available to support EPA efforts to improve drinking water quality and to provide direction for CDC‚Äôs recreational water activities, such as the Healthy Swimming program.

In this allocution, the Pontiff expressly distinguishes between true and false civilization, and declares that history witnesses to the fact that the Holy See has always been the protector and patron of all genuine civilization; and he affirms that, if a system designed to de-Christianize the world be called a system of progress and civilization, he can never hold out the hand of peace to such a system.

Vuzu is similar to some popular American TV Channels such as Bravo, FX, BET, The CW, NBC, TNT and many others. Overview The channel aires new programs monthly further making it a world class youth channel within the African Television and Broadcasting space. The channel broadcasts on channel 116 on Dstv fusing both local and international programs. The Channel is broadcast throughout Africa to DStv Family, Compact, Compact Plus & Premium subscribers. The channel had a more premium version of the channel called Vuzu Amp broadcasting on DStv channel 103 to premium subscribers only, showcasing mostly HD Programs some directly after U.S airing known as \\"Express From The U.S\\". This was replaced by One Magic. History The channel launched in mid-2009, replacing the popular M-Net channel Go. This occurred during the second phase of the network's reshuffle of its youth channel offering. Vuzu is typically geared towards the 14-23 age demographic. Its launch also coincided with the launch of the virtual social network vuzu.tv in an effort to make the channel far more interactive than its predecessor. The first program to broadcast was the popular show known as Touch TV, which aired at 16:00 (previously 17:00 ). Many Go viewers protested the launch of the channel as it caused a number of go's programs to move to new time slots, channels or disappear completely. In 2013 the channel once more went through a change as its traditional channel number 123 changed to 116. In 2014 a companion channel was created in replacement of M-Net Series Showcase which later was rebranded as Vuzu Amp. On 12 December 2017, it was announced that Vuzu Amp will be rebranding as One Magic as of 29 January 2018, still broadcasting the same content, but will have a more local approach. On 1 September 2018, Vuzu got a new logo and is now family oriented with its lineup mainly consisting of reality and sitcoms with a few drama series. On 1 July 2019, Vuzu celebrated its 10th anniversary.

Discovered in 1926 by Norbert Casteret, it is known for its Gran Sala (Great Hall) which has a frozen lake some in area, its ice formations, and a ice wall into a second chamber. Description The Grotto of Casteret is situated at the top of a scree / snow couloir ESE of the Roland's Breach, and has an impressive entrance porch some wide, and high. After the passage opens out into the vast ice-floored Grande Salle, about long, wide, and high. Its floor is a frozen lake of clear ice with a surface area of about . Large ice columns dominate the end of the chamber. To the left of the chamber an opening leads into the Salle Maude at the base of a ice-wall called Niagara.St. Pierre (2007) Beyond the Grande Salle, the ice floor gives way to a mainly boulder-floored passage which leads after leads to a climb which emerges in a lapiaz field on the surface.

It is deep, with the final being a vertical shaft entering the Grande Salle.St. Pierre (2007), pp. 16 History The cave was first entered by the family Casteret (Norbert Casteret, his mother, his wife, and his brother) in July 1926 when they explored most of the main passage. He and his wife returned in September 1926 when they achieved the through trip.Casteret (2007) The Salle Maude was discovered and explored in August 1950 by Casteret and his daughters Maude and Gilberte. The third entrance, the Puits Florence, was first descended in August 1975 by the Club Martel.St. Pierre (2007), pp. 10 Geology and formation The Grotto of Casteret is formed in Cretaceous limestone. The ice in the Grande Salle is ponded and has formed as the result of cold air flowing through the system, with areas out of the draught being water.Casteret (1950), pp. 133 The deeper ice is considered to be very old, and possibly relict of a cold period of the Quaternary. The volume of ice in the Grande Salle has decreased since its discovery. In 1950 the entry into Salle Maude was a low crawl across the ice floor about high. In 1988 it was reported that the gap was high as a result of the ice floor lowering.St. Pierre (2007), pp. 17‚Äì18 Access Access is controlled by the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park authorities.

Deriving from 'transvestite' the aim was to create interpretive, animalistic and post-modern interpretations of the 'drag queen.' History The term \\"tranimal\\" was coined by artist Jer Ber Jones. Jer Ber Jones is responsible for starting the movement and popularizing the movement in 2006, and again in early 2007 with the original stage production of the dance musical FOWL, a collaboration with choreographer Ryan Heffington, which grew into a drag and performance art scene based in Los Angeles. In contrast to traditional genres of drag such as camp and pageant, tranimal drag de- constructs fashion and make-up, often using found objects, and elements of surrealism. A visual emphasis was placed on hiding or exaggerating male attributes, but not necessarily shaving, tucking or plucking, creating a constant push and pull between the genders. The tranimal movement was inspired by Leigh Bowery, Radical Faeries, the Cockettes, Boy George, Grace Jones, Cindy Sherman and John Waters. Austin Young and collaborators further popularized the look and ethos of Tranimal through portraiture work around the genre. In 2011 the movement reached a mainstream audience when actress Ann Magnuson suggested to the Los Angeles Times that a \\"Tranimal Makeover Station be erected mid-way on the red carpet.\\" (For the televised Oscar Awards Ceremony.) http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/awards/2011/02/if-i-ran-the-oscars- ann-magnuson.html .In 2019, Indian Drag artist Patruni Chidananda Sastry presented tranimal drag with indianism at Hyderabad Literature festival. https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/how-a-27-year-old-queer-indian-brought- drag-to-their-city/https://www.thehansindia.com/featured/sunday-hans/drag- helps-you-be-aware-616811https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/drag- con-hyderabad-2019-patruni-sastry/article29798142.ece Tranimal Workshop The first public Tranimal Workshop event, held at Mark Allen's Machine Project in 2009, contextualized the movement and moved it into a participatory, open- source series of events. Each event culminated in a series of photographs shot by Austin Young. The concept of the Tranimal Workshop was a collaboration between by Austin Young, Squeaky Blonde and Fade-Dra. Participating artists have also included Matthu Andersen, Jer Ber Jones, Andrew Marlin, Jason El Diablo, and many others. The first workshop was co-produced by Austin Young and Saskia Wilson-Brown in conjunction with Ultra Fabulous Beyond Drag, Part Deux in 2007, and Ultra Fabulous Beyond Drag, Part Deux in 2009. These two film programs in Los Angeles were complemented by guest performances from artists such The Steve Lady, Jer Ber Jones, and Squeaky Blonde, among others. The Ultra Fabulous screenings served to coalesce the filmic elements of the movement in one place, for the first time.http://www.laweekly.com/2009-12-10/music/drag-hagging-with-the-best-of- em/ Since the initial event, the workshop has been further developed by many of the original organizers with Austin Young at the helm, and has expanded to various venues including Los Angeles' Hammer Museum in 2010 and the Berkeley Art Museum in 2011.

Plot  The story involves Bugs Bunny eluding the Big Bad Wolf and his nephew. After the elder wolf is unable to catch Bugs through traditional means, he gets inspiration from his nephew, who gives him ideas for catching Bugs based on nursery rhymes. First, the wolves lure Bugs into playing Little Red Riding Hood so the Big Bad Wolf, who is playing Grandma, can trap Bugs. But Bugs escapes by putting hot coals from a fireplace into the bed that Big Bad is in. Next, Bugs plays Goldilocks in The Story of the Three Bears. Big Bad thinks that he has Bugs trapped again, and tries to get revenge by using hot coals on the bed that Bugs is supposed to be in. But instead Big Bad lights a dynamite stick attached to fake rabbit ears and the dynamite explodes in his face. Bugs then proceeds to explain to the exasperated Big Bad how he can have a rabbit for dinner, and the cartoon concludes with Big Bad and his nephew sharing dinner with Bugs, who says, \\"If you can't eat 'em, join 'em\\", as the cartoon fades out.

The hamlet sits on a minor road off the A6105 Duns to Greenlaw road at . Gavinton in Berwickshire History Gavinton is a relatively new settlement, having been established as a planned estate village in 1759 when David Gavin, the local landowner, decided to demolish the village and the church of Langton, which were situated on his estate, and rebuild them outwith the walls on Crimson Hill. The first records of the area came in the reign of David I of Scotland when Roger d'Eu, the king's retainer, was in possession of lands and church of Langton. Richard was succeeded at Langton by William de Veteriponte (Vipont) and that family were the lairds until 1314 when Sir William, Lord of Langton, died at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. The lordship at Langton Tower passed to Sir Alexander Cockburn when he married Mary, the Vipont heiress. In 1496, King James IV of Scotland sent his artillery to Langton to prepare for an English incursion then Mary, Queen of Scots was believed to have spent a night at Langton Tower during a survey of the border lands. The old village of Langton, so called because of its straggling layout (Longtown) was attacked and razed to the ground in 1558 by Sir Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland. Parish Church of Langton Sir Alexander Cockburn, 7th. Baronet of Langton, died at the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745 and another chapter of the Langton story came to an end. In 1758 David Gavin bought Langton and wasted no time in demolishing the historic old tower and building a new house. David married the daughter of the Earl of Lauderdale and their daughter married the Earl of Breadalbane. In 1886 another Earl of Breadalbane bought Langton House and immediately set about building a magnificent new home. The Breadalbanes lived there until 1920 when they decided to abandon it. The roof was removed and the house was partially demolished in 1930. The house was finally demolished in 1950 though the farm buildings remain and are still used Like the ancient tower, church and village, Langton House has disappeared below the fields. The name, Langton, though lives on in the parish and the church.

Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Juvenile convicts working in the fields in a chain gang, photo taken circa 1903 The system that is currently operational in the United States was created under the 1974 Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act called for a \\"deinstitutionalization\\" of juvenile delinquents. The act required that states holding youth within adult prisons for status offenses remove them within a span of two years (this timeframe was adjusted over time). The act also provided program grants to states, based on their youth populations, and created the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). Through reauthorization amendments, additional programs have been added to the original Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. The following list highlights a few of these additions: 1975 ‚Äì Programs were developed to assist children with learning disabilities who entered the juvenile justice system. 1984 ‚Äì A new missing and exploited children program was added. 1984 ‚Äì Strong support was given to programs that strengthened families. 1988 ‚Äì Studies on prison conditions within the Indian justice system. 1990 ‚Äì The OJJDP began funding child abuse training programs to instruct judicial personnel and prosecutors. 1983 ‚Äì A juvenile boot camp program was designed to introduce delinquent youth to a lifestyle of structure and discipline. 1992 ‚Äì A community prevention grants program gave start-up money to communities for local juvenile crime prevention plans. Types of incarceration Mount Meigs Campus in Mount Meigs, unincorporated Montgomery County, Alabama, of the Alabama Department of Youth Services Some inmates of the juvenile system are or were \\"status offenders\\", children who committed acts that are not crimes for adults, but can get juveniles in trouble with the law. Status offenses include consensual sexual acts, truancy from school, smoking cigarettes, curfew violations, drinking alcohol, running away from one's residence, chronic disobedience of parents, guardians, and/or other authority figures, waywardness, and ungovernability.Williams, Vergil L. Dictionary of American Penology. Second Edition. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996. 213\\\\. Retrieved from Google Books on August 23, 2010. , . Trends as of 2000 Recently, forty seven states have made it easier to be tried as an adult,Snyder, H., & Sickmund, M. (1999). Juvenile offenders and victims: 1999 National Report.: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Page 89. calling attention to the growing trend away from the original model for treatment of juveniles in the justice system. A recent study of pretrial services for youth tried as adults in 18 of the country's largest jurisdictions found that the decision to try young offenders as adults was made more often by legislators and prosecutors (at a rate of 85%) than by judges, the people originally endowed with the responsibility for such discretion. The decreasing distinction between how youth and adults are tried in the criminal justice system has caused many within the legal system, as well as other activists and organizers, to criticize the juvenile justice system. The \\"tough on crime\\" attitudes of these recent legislative events reflect the stance's popularity in public opinion. This is true of the majority of criminal justice reform policies in the past couple decades, including California's infamous Three Strikes Law. Reforms in criminal justice reforms, and juvenile justice in particular, are often fought in the court of public opinion. The popular news media plays a crucial role in promoting the myth of a new generation of young \\"super-predators\\" threatening the public. Despite documented decreases in youth crime, particularly in violent crime which indicate a 68% decline in youth homicide in the 1990s, overall media coverage of youth crime is increasing. Despite evidence to the contrary, 62% of respondents in a 1999 survey on youth delinquency believed that youth crime increased. Advocates for juvenile justice reform focus considerable attention on amending public opinion and adjusting the gap between the threats people perceive and the reality of juvenile crime. Profiles of youth in custody A report by the federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and U.S. Department of Justice, \\"Survey of Youth in Residential Placement: Youth's Needs and Services\\", used data from more than 7,000 youth in custody gathered during interviews. The report's findings include: 70% of youth in custody reported that they had \\"had something very bad or terrifying\\" happen to them in their lives. 67% reported having seen someone severely injured or killed; 26% of those surveyed said felt as if \\"life was not worth living\\", and 22% reported having tried to commit suicide at some point in their lives; 84% of the youth surveyed said they had used marijuana, compared to a rate of 30% among their peers in the general population; 30% reported having used crack or cocaine, compared with only 6% in the general population. The report noted a significant gap between the profiles of boys and girls, with girls often reporting more pronounced difficulties: 63% of girls reported having problems with anger, whereas 47% of boys did; 49% of girls reported having hallucinatory experiences, whereas only 16% of boys did; 37% of girls reported having suicidal thoughts and feelings, whereas only 18% of boys did. Facilities that treat such youth also were shown to be inadequate in some core areas, according to the Justice Department. Among youth who reported four or more recent substance-related problems, only about 60% said they had been provided with substance abuse counseling in their current facility. Many youth in custody reported having attention problems and difficulties in school. Once in custody, only 45% report spending 6 hours a day or more in school, meaning that their learning time is below that of the general population. Criticism of juvenile justice Juvenile crime poster, c. 1913 Critics of the juvenile justice system, like those in the wider prison abolition movement, identify three main markers of the system for critique and reform. They hold that the juvenile justice system is unjust, ineffective, and counter-productive in terms of fulfilling the promise of the prison system, namely the protection of the public from violent offenders. Criticisms of racism Critics of the juvenile justice system believe that the system is unfairly stacked against minority youth. Minority youth are disproportionately represented in incarcerated populations relative to their representation in the general population. A recent report from the National Council on Crime and delinquency found that minority youth are treated more severely than white youth at every point of contact with the system‚Äîfrom arrest, to detention, to adjudication, to incarceration‚Äîeven when charged with the same crime. In 1995, African American youths made up 12% of the population, but were arrested at rates double those for Caucasian youths. The trend towards adult adjudication has had implications for the racial make-up of the juvenile prison population as well. Minority youth tried in adult courts are much more likely to be sentenced to serve prison time than white youth offenders arrested for similar crimes. Criticisms based on adverse effects Juvenile detention facilities are often overcrowded and understaffed. The most infamous example of this trend is Cheltenham center in Maryland, which at one point crowded 100 boys into cottages sanctioned for maximum capacity of 24, with only 3‚Äì4 adults supervising. Young people in these environments are subject to brutal violence from their peers as well as staff, who are often overworked, underpaid and under stress. The violence that incarcerated youth experience‚Äîfights, stabbings, rapes‚Äîis well known to those who work in the criminal justice system, and those who oppose it. Congregating delinquent youth has a negative impact on behavior‚Äîit actually serves to make them more deviant and more of a threat to themselves and others. Social scientists call the phenomenon \\"peer delinquency training\\", and have found significantly higher levels of substance abuse, school difficulties, delinquency, violence, and adjustment difficulties in adulthood for offenders detained in congregated settings versus those that were offered treatment in another setting.Dishion, T.J., McCord, J & Poulin F. (1999), \\"When interventions Harm: Peer groups and Problem Behavior.\\" American Psychologist Vol. 54, No. 9 p. 755-764. Incarceration can aggravate mental illness. According to detention center administrators who testified to United States Congress in a 2004 Special Investigation by the House of Representatives, many incarcerated youths could have avoided incarceration had they received mental health treatment. Prepared for Sen. Susan Collins, and Rep. Henry A. Waxman. Detention centers do not promote normal cognitive and emotional development. A recent report indicated that for up to one-third of incarcerated youth suffering from depression, the onset of depression occurred after their transfer to a detention center.Kashani, J.H., Manning, G.W., McKnew, D.H., Cytryn, L., Simonds, J.F., and Wooderson, P.C. (1980) \\"Depression Among Incarcerated Delinquents\\", Psychiatry Research Vol. 3 p. 185-191. These youth face a greater risk of self-injury and suicide. Researchers have found that incarcerated youth engage in self-injurious behaviors at a rate two to four times higher than the general youth population.Parent, D.G., Leiter, V., Kennedy, S., Livens, L., Wentworth, D. & Wilcox, S. (1994) Conditions of Confinement: Juvenile Detention and Corrections Facilities. Washington, DC: U.S. department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Furthermore, prison administrative policy often intensifies the risk by responding to suicidal threats in ways that endanger the detainees, such as putting them in solitary confinement.Hayes, L.M. (1999) Suicide Prevention in Juvenile Correctional Facilities Washington DC: Department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Detained youth with special needs often fail to return to school upon release. Among those young students receiving remedial education during their detention, roughly 43% do not return to school. Among those that do re-enroll, between two-thirds to three-quarters drop out within a year. Not only does this pose a serious threat to the ex-offender's well- being‚Äîhigh school drop-outs face high unemployment, poor health, shorter life spans, and low income‚Äîit also poses a threat to public safety. According to the United States Department of Education, high school drop-outs are 3.5 times more likely to be arrested than High School Graduates. Formerly incarcerated youth face less success in the labor market. On average youth that have spent any amount of time in a youth detention facility work 3‚Äì5 weeks less than the average employee over the course of a year. Their interrupted education makes them less competitive, and their experience of incarceration may change them into less stable employees. This lack of success in the workplace is a threat to personal well-being as well as to communities whose youth are incarcerated in large numbers, such as African Americans. Criticisms based on effectiveness Studies indicate that incarcerating young offenders is not the most effective way of curbing delinquency and reducing crime. The relationship between detention of young offenders and the rate of overall youth criminality is not evident. A study of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's arrest data for the 1990s reveals that the rise in detention was unrelated to crime rates. That is, detention as a tactic of controlling young offenders has little to nothing to do with the rate of crime or the \\"threat\\" that youth pose to the public.Sickmund, M. (2007). Juveniles in Corrections. Washington DC: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. While there may be an individual need to incarcerate violent or high-risk youth, most of the young people in prisons, jails and detention centers today‚Äîup to 70%‚Äîare serving time for nonviolent offenses. Not all delinquent youth are incarcerated‚Äîin fact, as many as one-third of all Americans might engage in delinquent behavior at some point in their youth. But those that are detained or imprisoned are less likely to grow out of their delinquency than those that are not. Criminologists recognize a natural process of desistance called \\"aging out\\" of delinquency, through which a person desists their delinquent behavior through maturation and experience. Detaining or incarcerating youth can interrupt or slow down the aging out process, resulting in a longer period of delinquency. The harm done to the emotional, mental and social development of incarcerated youth, combined with the separation from family and community and the congregation of offenders makes previous incarceration the leading indicator for a repeat offence among young offenders. It is a greater predictor even than weapon possession, gang membership and bad relationships with parents.Benda, B.B. & Tollet, C.L. (1999), \\"A Study of Recidivism of Serious and Persistent Offenders Among Adolescents.\\" Journal of Criminal Justice, Vol. 27, No. 2. Pages 111-126. What these studies tell us is that, far from increasing the public safety and curbing youth crime, detaining and incarcerating young offenders is actually leading to more criminality among youth, and more serious crimes. As the country grapples with the impact of a growing recession, a cost-benefit analysis of our criminal justice system is especially germane. The cost effectiveness of detention and incarceration scores very low compared with alternative approaches to youth delinquency in a cost-benefit analysis. A 2002 government commissioned study in Washington state revealed that for every one dollar spent on juvenile detention systems, a benefit return of $1.98 in terms of reduced crime and cost of crime to taxpayers was achieved. They found benefit returns ranging from $3.36- $13 for a series of detention alternatives.Aos, S. (2002) The Juvenile Justice System in Washington State: recommendations to improve Cost-Effectiveness. Olympia, WA: Washington State Institute for Public Policy. This study indicates that alternative models are more effective in reducing youth offending in practical and economic terms. The movement to end youth incarceration The movement to reduce and end youth incarceration is a widespread collection of thousands of activists, lawyers, community organizers, educators, artists, and youth working on specific legislative and localized initiatives. Movement goals include shutting down particularly bad prisons and detention centers, demanding better treatment for youth in the system, providing and demanding better representation for young people in court, affecting legislation to curb youth incarceration, working to abolish arrest warrants for young people, and promoting alternatives to incarceration. There are national organizations and local ones, opposition from inside the criminal justice system and from outside of it. The movement is diverse in many ways, and is difficult to encapsulate in a single entry. Listed below are some examples of movement struggles: The Maryland campaign to Close Cheltenham The Cheltenham Juvenile Detention Center in Maryland was one of the nation's most infamous prisons for boys. Started in 1872 as the House of Reformation for Colored Boys, Cheltenham was home to a wildly overrepresented population of minority youth. But the racial injustice inside the notorious prison was not what ultimately led to its demise. The conditions at Cheltenham were deplorable. Overcrowded and understaffed, Cheltenham was also flagged by fire safety inspectors as one of the least safe buildings in the state. The antiquated prison structure‚Äîeach cell had to be individually unlocked, and at times prison staff could not present keys to some cells‚Äîwas also the site of an enormous amount of brutality and violence. Local citizens in the Maryland Juvenile Justice Coalition developed the Maryland Campaign to Close Cheltenham in 2001. The campaign involved parents of incarcerated youth, youth activists, and faith leaders from across the state. Through a targeted media campaign to shift public opinion, the campaign succeeded in passing legislation through the annual budget to phase out and close Cheltenham, and to increase state spending on community-based alternative programs for youth offenders. Taking on Tallulah The Tallulah Correction Center for Youth in Louisiana had been open for only three years when it was first sued by the United States Department of Justice (in collaboration with local activists in the Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana) for violating the civil rights of youth held in its confines‚Äîmarking the first time in U.S. history that the federal government has actively sued a state over the conditions of its juvenile detention facilities. That same year the filthy conditions, brutal violence and chronic understaffing earned the center a citation as \\"the worst in the nation.\\" In 1999, even after the federal government had taken over partial responsibility for improving conditions, things were so unsafe for the youth that the staff of the center walked out, leaving 400 boys completely unsupervised. Youth and adult activists appealed to the state legislature to shut down the prison once and for all. But their aspirations didn't stop with the abolition of one prison‚Äîthey sought to redefine the juvenile justice system in the state, to change it from one based almost entirely on incarceration and punishment to a new system focusing on community-based alternatives to incarceration. In 2003 the state of Louisiana became nationally recognized for its leadership in reforming a broken juvenile justice system. With the passage of the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2003 (Act 1225), then Governor Kathleen Blanco and the Louisiana State Legislature ushered in a period of reform in which the notoriously brutal Tallulah prison for youth was shut down, conditions were improved in other abusive youth prisons throughout the state, and a commitment was made to both the increased use of alternatives to incarceration for youth and to revamping secure care prisons to be small, therapeutic facilities that were regionalized to keep children closer to their families. Before the passage of Act 1225, over two thousand children were held in prison in Louisiana. Today the system holds just over 500 children statewide. In 1998 the rate of recidivism, or children returning to prison after release, was 56% as compared to 11% today. This decrease in the number of children incarcerated has contributed to an increase in public safety. Proposition 21 in California In 2001 California residents passed Proposition 21, a multi-faceted proposition designed to be tough on youth crime, incorporating many youth offenders into the adult criminal justice jurisdiction. Opponents to this law included activists from Californians for Justice, Critical Resistance, the Youth Force Coalition, the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, and the American Civil Liberties Union. Advocates in the ACLU challenged many portions of the law, including a provision automatically sentencing youth 14‚Äì17 years old in adult court. This portion of the law was struck down by the California Courts of Appeal in 2001. Opposing zero-tolerance policies The term \\"zero tolerance\\" is not defined in law or regulation; nor is there a single widely accepted practice definition. The United States Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, defined zero tolerance as \\"a policy that mandates predetermined consequences or punishments for specified offenses\\".Anne J. Atkinson, Ph.D (2005)\\"ZERO TOLERANCE POLICIES: AN ISSUE BRIEF\\" Prepared for the Virginia Department of Education. Richmond, VA: PolicyWorks, Ltd. The purpose of zero-tolerance policies, according to their proponents, is to send a message that certain kinds of behaviors are not tolerable on school grounds. About 94% of public schools in the United States have zero-tolerance policies for guns; 91% for other weapons; 88% for drugs; 87% for alcohol and 79% for tobacco. Opposition to zero-tolerance policies, especially at the local level, focus on critiques including charges that the program is discriminatory, unconstitutional, harmful to schools and students, ineptly implemented, and provides harsh punishment (suspension of education) for minor offenses (possession of tobacco). A few infamous cases have been used by opposition groups, such as Amnesty International, to further their case against the policy. The Center for Juvenile and Criminal Justice released a story in 2003 about a 13-year-old girl in Tuscaloosa, Alabama arrested and detained for 5 weeks for possession of what was thought to be marijuana, but turned out to be oregano. The zero-tolerance practice in Illinois of sending any youth charged with drug crimes within 1,000 feet of any school or public housing project directly to adult court has resulted in the largest racial disparity in the country‚Äîover 99% of youth affected by this policy were minority youth. Opposition to zero-tolerance policies nationwide and locally is broad and growing. Organizational leadership has been provided nationally by Amnesty International and the American Bar Association, who has officially opposed such policies since 2001. Promoting alternatives: the JDAI Most activists in the movement to end youth incarceration believe that the best way to mitigate the impact of detention and incarceration on our youth is to reduce the number of youth that pass through the system. By providing credible alternatives to incarceration, this portion of the movement provides opportunities for communities to treat, rather than punish, young offenders‚Äîmuch the way that the juvenile justice system was founded to do. The Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI) is a private-public partnership being implemented nationwide, with pilot programs in California, Oregon, New Mexico and Illinois. Their goal is to make sure that locked detention is used only when absolutely necessary. The JDAI has produced some promising results from their programs. Detention center populations fell by between 14% and 88% in JDAI counties over the course of 7 years (1996‚Äì2003). These same counties saw declines in juvenile arrests (an indicator of overall juvenile crime rates) during the same time period ranging from 37‚Äì54%. Alternatives for juvenile detention centers for rehabilitation and reentry processes for those already incarcerated requires the work of counselors who understand the psychology of these individuals from law enforcement bodies to develop effective diversion programs are the best strategy to ensure children and youth to stay away from detention centers. Diversion programs could include everything from counseling to peer mentoring in order to improve the relationship in the community and remove the stigma of criminal youth. There are solutions proven effective for those communities that impose them. For example, intervention centers are a progressive solution where trouble kids get the opportunity to be disciplined to correct behavior but the process involves family involvement, community service activities, and one-on-one therapy. Legislation work such as Colorado's Smart School Discipline Law work to implement prevention strategies in an early stage starting in school, revise and provide adequate training to police officers in order to find proper disciplinary practice when dealing with trouble students. The initiative is now part of a bigger network to be implemented nationwide.

During World War II he filmed activities of the US Army, meeting director George Stevens, whom he soon followed to Hollywood and assisted at Paramount Pictures. In the 1950s, between his two marriages, Moffat had a string of love affairs, notably with Elizabeth Taylor and Lady Caroline Blackwood. Beginning in 1956 he wrote or co-wrote screenplays for a number of well-known films, in addition to Giant, and in the 1970s wrote for television. Early life Ivan Moffat was born in Havana, Cuba, the son of the British actress and poet Iris Tree and her American husband, artist and photographer Curtis Moffat.Curtis Moffat: biography on the Victoria & Albert Museum website He was the grandson of actor-manager Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree.\\"Ivan Moffat\\", obituary in The Telegraph, 3 August 2002, accessed 18 April 2012Ivan Moffat on the 'Genealogy of the Moffat Family' website The family lived, among other places, in America and Australia, and moved to London when Moffat was 8 years old. There, Moffat attended Dartington Hall School, in Totnes, Devon, befriending Michael Young. Moffat then studied at the London School of Economics. As an undergraduate, he joined the Communist Party, which caused him later to be blacklisted for a time in Hollywood. Jessica Mitford once described Moffat as \\"spanning the gap between Left-wing politics and the deb dance scene\\". By 1938, after his father moved back to America, Moffat joined the Gargoyle Club in Soho, hosting frequent parties in his father's famously decorated house, meeting Philip Toynbee and Dylan Thomas and working for Strand Films, where he helped to make documentaries for the government to promote the war effort. In 1943, after America entered World War II, Moffat enlisted in the US Army, serving as a writer in the Signal Corps, a special unit known as the \\"Hollywood Irregulars\\". There, he served for the first time under the director George Stevens as a writer and assistant director. After filming and photographing allied forces in D-Day landings and at the Battle of the Bulge, among other events, the unit filmed the liberation of Paris and of Dachau concentration camp.Bergan, Ronald. \\"Ivan Moffat\\", obituary in The Guardian, 22 July 2002, accessed 18 April 2012 Film and television After the war, Moffat settled in Hollywood, joining Stevens as an assistant producer at Liberty Films, which was soon purchased by Paramount Pictures. There he assisted Stevens on such movies as I Remember Mama (1948), Shane (1951) and A Place in the Sun (1953). In 1956, Moffat worked on the screenplays for Bhowani Junction, D-Day the Sixth of June and Giant. The screenplay for Giant brought Moffat and co-writer Fred Guiol an Oscar nomination. During the filming of the latter Moffat, unlike Stevens, was friendly with the film's star James Dean. He also renewed his friendship with Elizabeth Taylor, with whom he had earlier had a brief affair during the filming of A Place in the Sun. Among other screenplays that Moffat wrote or co-wrote were The Wayward Bus and Boy on a Dolphin (both 1957), They Came to Cordura (1959), Tender Is the Night (1962), The Heroes of Telemark and The Greatest Story Ever Told (both 1965), and Black Sunday (1977), as well as revising the screenplay for The Great Escape (1963) and The Chase (1966). In the 1970s, Moffat wrote episodes of the television series Colditz, and in 1985 he wrote the story and co-wrote the script for the television film Florence Nightingale, which starred Jaclyn Smith. Moffat is interviewed extensively in the documentary George Stevens: A Filmmaker's Journey (1985) and on the DVDs of Shane and Giant. Personal life Moffat became friends with Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre in Paris, marrying their protege Natasha Sorokin at the end of World War II, with whom he had one daughter, Lorna Moffat. The marriage soon collapsed. Moffat had a string of love affairs with beautiful women in the 1950s. Moffat's friend Christopher Isherwood wrote in his diary that Moffat \\"is always so pretty and bright eyed and clean ‚Äì he has to be for I imagine his evenings usually end, if they don't begin, visiting some girl\\". In 1956 he began a long on again, off again affair with then-married Lady Caroline Blackwood, fathering her daughter Ivana Lowell in 1966, after he was remarried.Gaines, Steven. \\"Ivana Lowell, Sober Guinness Heiress Raised by Poet, Says What Happened\\". New York magazine, 19 September 2010 In 1961, Moffat married The Hon. Katharine Smith (1933‚Äì2002),Lundy, Darryl. \\"Hon.

Through the Pembroke family, Katharine descended from Countess Catherine Vorontsov.Woronzow, HumphrysFamilyTree, accessed 4 April 2012. Her father, Count Semyon Vorontsov, the Russian ambassador to Britain, brought the family to London in 1785. During the marriage, the couple moved back to London when Moffat was hired to \\"doctor\\" the screenplay for The Great Escape (1963), and partly so his wife could fulfil her responsibilities as lady-in-waiting to the Queen Mother. With Katharine, he had two sons, Jonathan and Patrick Moffat. The marriage was dissolved in 1972.Lundy, Darryl. \\"Jonathan David Moffat: Person Page 2753\\", ThePeerage.com, accessed 8 April 2012 Moffat died on 4 July 2002, aged 84, in Los Angeles, California, from a stroke.

They are descendants of King Gcaleka's brother Rharhabe. The major and most well-known component of the Rharhabe are the Ngqika (\\"Gaika\\") grouping. The descendants of Rharhabe have a long and proud history of colonial resistance. History of the Rharhabe The Xhosa royal blood line stretches from King Xhosa, who fathered Malangana, who fathered Nkosiyamntu, who fathered Tshawe, who fathered Ngcwangu, who fathered Sikhomo, who fathered Togu, who fathered Ngconde, who fathered Tshiwo, who fathered Phalo. The reason the Xhosa nation is divided can be traced to the time of King Phalo, who had both his intended wives arriving on the same day for their wedding, as he had already paid lobola for one from the Mpondo royal family, and for one from the Thembu royal family. In Xhosa tradition the first wife, as declared on arrival, would be the one whose sons would be heirs to the throne. This situation caused a great dilemma and a great outcry ‚Äì some called this the ancestors' punishment ‚Äì because a first wife could not be declared. As the two young princesses were of equal status, by choosing one as the Great Wife, King Phalo stood to offend the father of the other. This dilemma was solved by an old wise man called Majeke, who said: \\"What is greater than the head of the king, and what is stronger than his right hand? Let the one be the head wife and the other the wife of the right hand\\". So a secondary yet autonomous house was then created, being the Right Hand House. The Mpondo princess was chosen as his Great Wife and the Thembu princess as his Right Hand Wife. So there was a Right Hand House and the Great House. Phalo had two sons, Rharhabe, the eldest son born from his Right Hand House and Gcaleka, born from the Great House. Rharhabe was by birth older than Gcaleka having been born around 1722, with Gcaleka born in 1730. He displayed signs of bravery and wisdom from a very young age, traits which made him by far the superior of Phalo's sons. This caused great friction between the brothers, as Gcaleka feared that his brother with his popularity may one day seek to claim the throne for himself. After Gcaleka had reached manhood, conflict arose when Gcaleka tried to usurp the throne from his father but failed. Rarabe who had assisted his father against his brother's designs for the throne, decided to leave Phalo's Great Place with a group of followers and crossed the Kei River and settled at Amabele, near present-day Stutterheim. This move had the blessing of Phalo, as he accompanied his son in his search for a new home. On arrival in these new lands he encountered the KhoiKhoi (whom the Dutch named the Hottentots) and against whom fierce battles were fought over cattle and land. In the end and after killing the KhoiKhoi leader Hinsati, Rharhabe reached an amicable arrangement and negotiated with Hinsati's widow, Queen Hoho, for sale of land between the Keiskamma and Buffalo rivers. The Amathole Forests and Hoho Hills between Middle Drift and King William's Town were also sold to Rharhabe. Thus the Xhosa monarchy was, and still is, divided into the amaGcaleka and the amaRharhabe kingdoms. Rarabe's children from his great wife Nojoli kaNdungwana of the Thembu are Ntsusa ka Rharhabe (daughter), Mlawu ka Rarabe (his great son), Ndlambe ka Rarabe, Nukwa ka Rarabe and Khinzela ka Rharhabe (daughter). In the Right Hand House he fathered Cebo ka Rarabe who died without male heirs, but whose house was placed under Mdushane, Ndlambe's eldest son, to be the successor of Cebo. Rharhabe's other sons are Mnyaluza ka Rharhabe, Siko ka Rharhabe, Sigcawu ka Rarabe, Nzwane ka Rharhabe and Hlahla ka Rarabe. In 1782 his great son Mlawu ka Rharhabe died, but he had fathered two boys Ngqika and Ntimbo, who were infants at their father's death. Mlawu's councillors (amaphakathi) were then placed under Ndlambe who then became regent for the young Ngqika. Rarabe's daughter Ntsusa married the Qwathi chief Mdandala, who as dowry sent a miserable hundred head of cattle to Rharhabe. This was seen by Rharhabe as a great insult for someone of his stature, so that he sent his Right Hand son Cebo to Thembuland to demand more cattle. When Cebo arrived at Mdandala's homestead to demand the cattle as instructed by Rharhabe, the Qwathis fell upon this prince and killed him. These events enraged Rharhabe so that he at once entered Thembuland to remedy the affront at the tip of an assegai (spear). War broke out where Rharhabe scattered the Thembus and seized many of their cattle. But at the affair near the Xuka River, Rharhabe was fatally wounded and died. This battle is estimated to have occurred around 1787. Rharhabe's grave is near present-day Dohne in the Eastern Cape Province. Ciskei The Rharhabe had held out against colonial invaders for more than a century, longer than any other Southern African anti-colonial resistance. With the Apartheid government's policy of re-tribalisation, and the creation of the Ciskei Bantustan, a political rivalry between the Rharhabe and the Fengu-who had traditionally been better educated and tended to hold salaried positions- arose. This culminated in the election of Rharhabe Lennox Sebe as leader of the territory in 1973, although Sebe subsequently abandoned his anti-Fengu rhetoric. The Rharhabe today The Rharhabe were under the leadership of their regent Queen Noloyiso Sandile Aah! Noloyiso, daughter of King Cyprian Bhekuzulu Nyangayezizwe kaSolomon and sister to the current reigning Zulu monarch King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu. She was married to King Maxhob'ayakhawuleza Sandile Aah! Zanesizwe who died in July 2011. She was regent for her son Prince Jonguxolo Sandile and had 40 Traditional Councils under her jurisdiction, stretching out from King Williamstown, Peddie, Whittlesea and the Great Fish River areas, including Alice. The Queen Regent died on 8 July 2020 of COVID-19 , at the age of 56. The son of King Maxhob'ayakhawuleza Sandile King Jonguxolo Sandile Aa! Vululwandle! took over as the king after his father following his mother's death who was Queen Regent, and kingdom is under King Jonguxolo Sandile.

The incident is also known by its military operation name, Operation Four Species. Operation Israeli commanders had received intelligence reports that the ship was carrying weapons originating from Iran, which were to be transferred to Hezbollah. The ship was about off the coast of Israel, near Cyprus, when it was stopped. On November 4, 2009, the ship was radioed by an Israeli Navy missile boat, which ordered it to halt and prepare for inspection. Shayetet 13 naval commandos then boarded the ship without resistance. The navy said that the crew was not aware of the purported smuggling and cooperated with the commandos. The commandos broke open the shipping containers and discovered crates of weapons and munitions hidden between sacks of polyethylene stacked along the openings and sides. A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the ship was carrying \\"dozens of shipping containers, carrying numerous weapons, disguised as civilian cargo among hundreds of other containers on board\\". After boarding, the Israeli navy directed the ship to the Israeli port of Ashdod where a thorough inspection was held. According to the IDF, the ship picked up the cargo in Damietta, Egypt; the cargo arrived in Egypt on a ship that sailed from Bandar Abbas, Iran on October 25. The ship was then set to sail to Limassol, Cyprus and then Latakia, Syria. The IDF suspects that the cargo was intended for Hezbollah, which fought Israel in the 2006 Lebanon War. Following the war, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 forbade the shipments of arms to Hezbollah. In 2010, the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929 authorized states to seize items, including arms, that Iran is forbidden from exporting. An Israeli naval chief said that the amount of weapons found is ten times more than that found during Operation Noah's Ark. The arms shipment weighed 320 tons and were held in containers marked with Iranian shipping codes. The seized weaponry consisted of 9,000 mortar shells, 2,125 107-mm Katyusha rockets, 685 rocket fuses, 690 122-mm rockets, 21,100 F-1 fragmentation hand grenades, and 566,220 AK-47 rounds. The Israeli military said that the shipment was equivalent to about ten percent of Hezbollah's stocks. The arms shipment was the largest ever seized by Israel. On November 5, 2009, ambassadors and diplomats from 44 countries, military attaches from 27 armies in the world, and the international media were invited by the IDF and the Foreign Ministry to show them the weapons and munitions seized from the Francop ship. Reactions Ambassadors and military attaches witness weapons seized from Francop President of Israel Shimon Peres said, \\"Today the whole world can see the large gap between Syria and Iran's statements and their actual activities. The ship's arrest is not only of critical military importance, but also of political importance. Facts cannot be argued with.\\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it \\" a war crime that the UN Security Council should have a special meeting over\\". Hezbollah made a statement to the press in which it denied \\"any connection with the weapons which the Zionist enemy claims it seized aboard the Francop ship\\". Palestinian Authority spokesperson Ghassan Khatib stated that \\"Since the Israeli leadership and society are not ready for peace, they are using any pretext to shun peace obligations, and one is the issue of the Iranian shipment\\". An Iranian media source commentary claimed that \\"Israeli propaganda\\" was aimed at diverting attention from U.N. allegations of Israeli war crimes during the Gaza War. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said, \\"Unfortunately, some official pirates in the seas, sometimes in the name of the navy, sometimes in the name of inspection, obstruct trade movement between Syria and Iran. This ship does not carry Iranian weapons to Syria and does not contain military material to manufacture weapons in Syria. This ship carries imported goods from Syria to Iran.\\" After photos of the shipment was released by Israel the IRNA news agency claimed the shipping manifest from the \\"Ministry of Sepah\\" was forged citing that the Sepah ministry was renamed to \\"Defense Ministry\\" more than 20 years ago and that \\"if a country plans to send a secret arms cargo to another, it will not brand the shipment with a full description\\".Press TV: Israel gaffe reveals 'Iran ship photos' were forgedIsrael faked Francop arms claims -- Iran UPI November 16, 2009 In response the Israel MFA say that those 'Sepah' customs labels were found on some old crates of ammunition (7.62mm bullets, 122mm rockets and 106mm anti-tank shells).Ship of fools ctd.: The Israeli government response November 17, 2009 See also *Operation Full Disclosure- Similar seizure of Iranian weaponry on the high seas in 2014 *Karine A Affair - Similar seizure of Iranian weaponry on the high seas in 2002 *Gaza flotilla raid - Where a ship attempting to break the blockade of Gaza was boarded and seized *Victoria Affair - Ship carrying Iranian weapons bound from Syria to Hamas in Gaza and captured by Israel References Category:International maritime incidents Category:Iran‚ÄìIsrael relations Category:Israeli‚ÄìHezbollah conflict Category:Maritime incidents in 2009 Category:Operations involving Israeli special forces Category:Hezbollah Category:Counter-terrorism in Israel Category:Arms trafficking Category:Battles and conflicts without fatalities Category:Israeli Navy Category:Iran‚ÄìIsrael proxy conflict ","title":"Francop Affair"},{"id":"24988667","text":"The Very Reverend Edward Shotter receiving his Beecher Award on 9 December 2016, following the 2016 Lewis Headley Public Lecture at the Royal Society of Medicine, London Edward Frank Shotter (29 June 1933 - 3 July 2019) was an Anglican priest and author.Among other books, he has written or edited Matters of Life and Death (1970); Life Before Birth (1986); and The Saints of Rochester (2003).

Campaign Important issues in the campaign included the Liberal demands for disestablishment of the Church of England, school building, and payment for Members of Parliament. According to The Times, \\"One of the Unionist placards told the electorate if they wanted their rates and taxes raised, if they wished to pay members of Parliament, and to build Board schools where they were not required, they must vote for Mr Trevelyan; but if they wanted peace, good trade, and their rates and taxes raised, then they ought to vote for Mr Foster\\".The Times, \\"Election Intelligence\\", 9 March 1899 Result When the count, which took just two hours and seven minutes, was completed, the result was as expected: a hold for the Liberal Party, with a majority of around three times what it had been in the last election.

Its theme is mainly the marvelous effects of devotion to the Holy Eucharist in the moral and spiritual life of the faithful. The Pope explores several aspects of eucharistic theology, citing the Eucharist as the source of life, a mystery of faith, a bond of charity, and the sacrifice of the Mass.Casarella, Peter J., \\"Eucharist and Sacrifice: Spiritual Renewal in Early Twentieth Century\\", The Oxford Handbook of Sacramental Theology, (Hans Boersma, Matthew Levering, eds.), OUP Oxford, 2015 > \\"For as men and states alike necessarily have their being from God, so they > can do nothing good except in God through Jesus Christ, through whom every > best and choicest gift has ever proceeded and proceeds.\\"Pope Leo XIII. > \\"Mirae caritatis\\", ¬ß5, May 28, 1902, Libreria Editrice Vaticana ...whereas > God has subordinated the whole supernatural order to the Incarnation of His > Word, in virtue whereof salvation has been restored to the human race, ... > the Eucharist, according to the testimony of the holy Fathers, should be > regarded as in a manner a continuation and extension of the Incarnation. As in previous encyclicals, Leo continues his call for social renewal, which source is found in the Holy Eucharist. He maintains that the sacrament fosters mutual charity that will promote Christian brotherhood and social equality. Having extolled the many benefits of the Eucharist, Leo then encourages frequent reception of same, a matter that was the subject of some debate at the time. > Away then with the widespread but most mischievous error of those who give > it as their opinion that the reception of the Eucharist is in a manner > reserved for those ... who rid themselves of the cares of the world in order > to find rest in some kind of professedly religious life. For this gift, than > which nothing can be more excellent or more conducive to salvation, is > offered to all those, whatever their office or dignity may be, ....\\"Pope Leo > XIII. \\"Mirae caritatis\\", ¬ß6, May 28, 1902, Libreria Editrice Vaticana Leo's successor, Pope Pius X, reiterated this in his 1905 motu proprio Sacra Tridentina Synodus, and the 1910 Quam singulari, which established the \\"age of reason\\" (about seven years of age) as the threshold for children to be admitted to the sacrament. The expression mirror of charity itself was popularized by Ailred of Rievaulx during the Middle Ages.

A modified version was built as the Yak-210 for navigator training, but only one example of each was built before the program was cancelled in 1956. Development The Yakovlev OKB began work in February 1951 on an aircraft that could be used as a cheap bomber trainer as the Yak- UTB (oochebnotrenirovochnyy bombardirovshchik ‚Äî bomber trainer), but this was quickly split into two closely related versions, the Yak-200 for pilot training and the Yak-210 for navigator/bombardier training. The primary difference between them was in equipment; the Yak-200 lacked all of the specialized navigation and bombardier gear.Gordon, p. 248 The Yak-200 was a mid-winged, twin-engined monoplane with a tricycle undercarriage. The metal- skinned, semi-monocoque fuselage was built in three sections with side-by-side seating for the crew. The nose was glazed with an optically flat panel and lacked a seat or any equipment. The control surfaces of the tail were fabric- covered although the tail itself was metal-skinned. The one-spar metal wing was made in three pieces with detachable trapezoidal outer panels. The ailerons were covered with fabric, as were the flaps in the outer wing panels, but the flaps in the center section were metal-skinned. The main undercarriage legs retracted forward into the engine nacelles, while the nose leg retracted backwards. Two Shvetsov ASh-21 radial engines powered the Yak-200 and drove variable-pitch VISh-11V-20A propellers.Gordon, pp. 246‚Äì47 The Yak-210 carried a full suite of navigation equipment with which to train navigators. The main distinguishing characteristic between it and the Yak-200 was an external radome under the rear fuselage for the PSBN-M (pribor slepovo bombometahniya i navigahtsii‚Äîblind-bombing and navigational device) search/bomb-aiming radar as was fitted on the Ilyushin Il-28. An OPB-6SR (opticheskiy pritsel bombardirovochnyy‚Äîoptical synchronized bombsight) and an AFA-BA-40 camera were also fitted; the latter could tilt 15¬∞ aft to record bomb impacts. All this equipment weighed which forced the fuel load to be reduced by in compensation. Seats were fitted in the nose for the trainee navigator and his instructor. The Yak-200 prototype made its first flight on 10 April 1953 and it underwent its State acceptance trials between 29 July and 10 September. These revealed a number of problems including poor handling, insufficient longitudinal stability and significant changes in trim as engine power was changed. Other problems included the lack of anti-icing devices for the windshield and the propeller blades. Remedies included adding a extension in the fuselage and a dorsal fillet to correct the stability issues. The wings were raised by and their dihedral was reduced. These changes moved the aircraft's center of gravity forward and it became simple and pleasant to fly, even though its empty weight increased by and its gross weight by which did include some additional fuel.Gordon, pp. 247‚Äì48 The Yak-210 first flew on 1 August 1953 and it received some of the improvements given to the Yak-200 including the dorsal fin. Its radome was changed from its initial oval shape to a teardrop during testing. It could carry of practice bombs.Gunston, p. 483 All these modifications required time and the VVS ultimately decided that the Il-28U trainer met its requirements, despite the extra costs involved, but the program was cancelled.

History A native of Penzance (Cornwall, UK), David Mark Pearce began playing the guitar in earnest at the age of 15 after first learning to play the drums. His first experience as part of a band came at 18, followed by several more until he left to attend the London College of Music and Media. Upon completion, he received a diploma in Music Technology and began his career as a much sought-after engineer and producer. His band affiliations include the UK melodic indie band Union Jane and the Cornwall- based folk rock group Naked Feet. He left the group in the early 2000s. In 2002, when one of his Allen and Heath colleagues, who was a friend of keyboardist Oliver Wakeman, asked Pearce to listen to some of Wakeman's tunes, he was impressed. He jokingly inquired as to whether Wakeman needed a guitarist, to which the answer was a surprising yes. After submitting his own work, in addition to several ideas he had for the band, he was hired. The first project that he and Wakeman worked on was the Anam Cara album mix, upon which he also contributed acoustic guitar support. It was the first of many projects with Oliver and the band; other projects have included: mixing and electric/acoustic guitar support for the CD single \\"The View from Here\\"; mixing Oliver's last commissioned album Angels and the relaxation albums Purification by Sound and Enlightenment and Inspiration; as well as electric guitar support on the OWB‚Äôs latest release, Mother‚Äôs Ruin. Since his debut with the band at the Oakwood Center in December 2002, his association with the band has taken many interesting twists and turns, including support work with Arjen Luccassen's band Stream of Passion, appearing at the prestigious Fordhamfest and an appearance with Oliver at one of the UK Classic Rock Society's acoustic evenings, where he showed off his talent on classical guitar. A big highlight was the 2008 performance and filming of the Coming to Town ‚Äì Live in Katowice DVD and cd (Metal Mind Productions) at the Wyspianski Theater in Katowice, Poland. Of his live performances it has been stated that Pearce \\"through his poseur look and attitude stole the show that evening\\" and that he \\"often stole the spotlight with a colorful outfit and impressive solos\\". Another seminal event for Dave was supporting Steve Howe at Oliver and Lisa Wakeman's wedding reception. Pearce wrote and recorded his own EP, 1997, which was also included on his debut album Pleasure Palace. He has been co- producer, sound engineer and provided guitar support to keyboardist Lisa LaRue on her album Lisa LaRue Project 2K9 World Class (Finger Woven Records), released in November 2009. He also co-wrote the song 'There Are No Words' with LaRue for the project. His own tune on the album, 'Tell Me Why', will also be included on his own melodic rock album entitled \\"Strangeang3ls,\\" (Pleasure Palace Records), set to be released in spring 2010. John Payne will be providing the vocals. It will be available as an EP in November 2009, along with the EP \\"Shelter Me from the Rain\\", released earlier the same year. Recognition David Mark Pearce was also named 2008's eighth \\"Best Guitarist'\\" by Classic Rock Society Magazine in the UK for his work with the Oliver Wakeman Band.

Early life Foster was the only son of Abraham Briggs Foster, chairman of the alpaca and mohair spinning firm of John Foster and Son of Black Dyke Mills, Queensbury, near Bradford. The firm had been founded by Philip's great-grandfather. He went to Eton College in 1879 and Magdalen College, Oxford in 1884, leaving with a degree three years later. In the late 1880s he held a commission in the 6th West Yorkshire Militia, and from 1890 in the Staffordshire Yeomanry, where he was promoted to Major in 1900. Parliamentary career After running unsuccessfully for Parliament in 1899 in a by-election to the Elland seat in West Yorkshire, he was elected for the constituency of Stratford-on-Avon in a by-election in June 1901, a seat he held until the election of 1906. Re-elected in 1909, he held the seat until its abolition in 1918. Public life He became a director and later, a firm chairman of the family firm John Foster and Sons. He was also chairman of the Air League, and chairman of the Midland Automobile Club. A keen angler and farmer, he became High Sheriff of Sussex for 1931.

Aircraft in fiction covers various real-world aircraft that have made significant appearances in fiction over the decades, including in books, films, toys, TV programs, video games, and other media. These appearances spotlight the popularity of different models of aircraft, and showcase the different types for the general public. Origins The first aviation film was the 1911 William J. Humphrey‚Äìdirected two-reeler, The Military Air-Scout, shot following an Aero Club of America flying meet at Long Island, New York, with Lt. Henry Arnold doing the stunt flying. \\"Arnold, who picked up 'a few extra bucks' for his services, became so excited about movies that he almost quit the Army to become an actor.\\" The years between World War I and World War II saw extensive use of the new technology, aircraft, in the new medium, film. In the early 1920s Hollywood studios made dozens of now- obscure \\"aerial Westerns\\" with leads such as Tom Mix and Hoot Gibson, where the role of the horse was taken by aircraft, or used aircraft as nothing more than vehicles for stunts to excite audiences. In 1926 the first \\"proper\\" aviation film was made; Wings is a story of two pilots who sign up to fly and fight in The Great War. Made with the co-operation of the United States' then- Department of War (a relationship that continues to this day), it used front- line military aircraft of the day such as the Thomas-Morse MB-3 and Boeing PW-9, flown by military pilots. Future US Air Force Generals Hap Arnold and Hoyt Vandenberg were among the military officers involved with the production, Arnold as a technical consultant and Vandenberg as one of the pilots. Wings was a box-office hit when it achieved general release in 1929 and went on to win the award for Best Production at the first Academy Awards. In Fascist Italy in the 1930s, aviation-themed films were used as propaganda tools to complement the massed flights led by Italo Balbo in promoting the regime domestically and abroad. One such film was the most successful Italian film of the pre-World War II era; Luciano Serra pilota (Luciano Serra, Pilot) was inextricably linked to the Fascist government via Mussolini's son Vittorio, who was the driving force behind the film's production. The film, set between 1921 and the Italo-Abyssinian War, was used to compare the allegedly moribund state of aviation in pre-Fascist Italy with the purported power of the Regia Aeronautica and Italian aviation in general in the 1930s. However, by the time that Luciano Serra pilota was shown at the 1938 Venice Film Festival, the link between aviation and Fascism had already been firmly established in the minds of the Italian people through widespread depictions of aircraft in a variety of media. For example, there was an entire branch of the Futurist Art movement devoted to aviation, known as Aeropittura (\\"Aeropainting\\"). While many of the Aeropittura works were devoted to flight rather than aircraft per se, some did celebrate Italian aviation exploits, such as Alfredo Ambrosi's Il volo su Vienna (The Flight over Vienna) which depicted in Futurist style the World War I exploit of Gabriele d'Annunzio; although the city of Vienna is shown in abstract in accordance with the aims of Aeropittura ‚Äì namely to show the dynamism and excitement of flight ‚Äì the Ansaldo SVA aircraft are very carefully and accurately rendered. In the US the use or denial of use of current military aircraft in films is determined by the US military itself. The armed services review all requests for the use of aircraft, by examining the scripts to ensure that aircraft will only be used in films that show the US military in a positive light. Because alternatives to using real military aircraft can be expensive, films that do not get US military approval often do not get financed or made. Sean McElwee, writing for Salon.com concluded of this problem, \\"This is a prima facie case for de facto censorship...If the government wants to allow its equipment to be used by studios, it needs to grant access to anyone who wants to use it ‚Äì that is the meaning of pluralism. The Pentagon fears that some of the movies may hurt the military's reputation and recruiting efforts. These concerns are legitimate, but it's more important that we allow John Stuart Mill's 'market place of ideas' to be a place for free trade, rather than favoring some over others.\\" Since the advent of television, aircraft have been featured in numerous miniseries and series around the world. These include the American productions Twelve O'Clock High, Airwolf, Baa Baa Black Sheep, Sky King and Wings; the Australian series Big Sky, Chopper Squad and The Flying Doctors, and the miniseries The Lancaster Miller Affair; British shows such as Airline, Piece of Cake and Squadron, the Canadian series Arctic Air; JETS ‚Äì Leben am Limit and Medicopter 117 ‚Äì Jedes Leben z√§hlt from Germany; and the Canadian‚ÄìBritish‚ÄìGerman co-production Ritter's Cove. A-1 Skyraider In the 1953 James A. Michener novel The Bridges at Toko-Ri a number of Douglas AD-1 Skyraiders fly RESCAP missions over a downed McDonnell F2H Banshee and Sikorsky HO3S-1 during the Korean War. This is also the case in the 1954 film of the same name, but with the Banshee replaced by a Grumman F9F Panther. The Skyraider was also featured as one of the many aircraft providing close air support during the First Battle of the Ia Drang Valley Campaign in Mel Gibson's 2002 film We Were Soldiers, based on the non-fiction book We Were Soldiers Once‚Ä¶ And Young by Lieutenant General (Ret.) Hal Moore and reporter Joseph L. Galloway. A-6 Intruder The 1986 Stephen Coonts novel Flight of the Intruder is about two naval aviators who take their Grumman A-6 Intruder on an unauthorized bombing raid on Hanoi during the Vietnam War. It was made into a 1991 film of the same name. The A-6 was also featured in the 1990 video game, Flight of the Intruder, and the Flight of the Intruders 1995 sequel, The Intruders. A-10 Thunderbolt II A-10 Thunderbolt II The popularity of the A-10s in the 2007 Transformers film led to the toy company releasing a minor character named Wingblade that turned into an A-10. The A-10 is one of the player-flyable aircraft in the 1989 video game U.N. Squadron. The aircraft is also featured in the 1989 video game A-10 Tank Killer. Since then, it has made appearances in the Ace Combat series. A-10s were also featured in the 2005 film Jarhead, where they attack U.S. Marine forces in a friendly fire incident. In the 2009 film Terminator Salvation, several A-10s are sent to support the ground troops led by John Connor in the opening sequence of the film. Later, two Resistance A-10s are shot down when trying to intercept the machine transport in which Marcus Wright and Kyle Reese were captive. Three A-10s using the call sign \\"Thunder\\" are sent to Smallville to kill both Superman and General Zod and his henchmen in the 2013 film Man of Steel but are attacked by Zod's forces, resulting in the destruction of two of the jets. A-26/B-26 Invader Two A-26s firebombers were prominently featured in the 1989 Steven Spielberg film, Always. Attempts to use radio-controlled models for special effects shots were abandoned as unworkable and models \\"flown\\" from wire rigs were utilized instead. A6M Zero The Mitsubishi A6M Zero was featured in the films The Final Countdown, Pearl Harbor, and Tora! Tora! Tora!. The Zero was also depicted in the 1976 film Midway; however real Zeros were not used. Modified T-6 Texans were used in both Tora! Tora! Tora! and Midway to depict A6M2 Type 21 Zero fighters, and some footage from the former was reused in the latter. Three Type 52 Zeros were used in Pearl Harbor. Two restored aircraft operated by Flight Magic, and one in the Planes of Fame Air Museum collection were barged to Hawaii where \\"all three aircraft were extensively flown with few problems until NX6528L suffered a gear-up landing. Fortunately, this was near the end of filming. NX6528L was shipped to Pete Regina Aviation at Van Nuys, California where it was returned to flying condition. This aircraft is now with the Commemorative Air Force Southern California Wing at Camarillo Airport.\\" The A5M and A6M are both featured in The Wind Rises, a 2013 Studio Ghibli animated fictionalized biopic of Zero designer Jiro Horikoshi. Zero fighters are a major feature in the 2013 Japanese novel Eien No Zero (The Eternal Zero) by Naoki Hyakuta. It was made into a 2013 film of the same name directed by Takashi Yamazaki. A√©rospatiale Gazelle An A√©rospatiale SA341G Gazelle played a role in the 1982 telemovie Deadly Encounter starring Larry Hagman. A heavily modified Gazelle was the centerpiece of the 1983 John Badham action film Blue Thunder. The same helicopter appeared in the short-lived 1984 TV series by the same name starring James Farentino. The modified Gazelle went on to be used in the TV mini-series Amerika. A modified Gazelle was used as a light attack helicopter in the 1988 Sylvester Stallone film, Rambo III. The helicopter was shot down by the main character, using a bow and arrow. A√©rospatiale Puma Modified A√©rospatiale SA 330 Pumas were used to depict Mil Mi-24 helicopter gunships, in the films Red Dawn, Rambo: First Blood Part II, and Rambo III, in 1984, 1985 and 1988, respectively. AH-64 Apache The Boeing AH-64 Apache had a major role in the 1990 action-thriller film directed by David Green, Fire Birds (or Wings of the Apache). The 1992 shooter game Desert Strike has the main character flying the AH-64 to complete various missions. Gunship is an AH-64 Apache helicopter simulation that was released by Microprose in 1986. The sequel Gunship 2000 was released in 1991. An AH-64 was used in an attempt to suppress the Hulk in the 2008 film, The Incredible Hulk. Although it has the standard, nose-mounted M230 Chain Gun, it instead attacks with the unusual configuration of twin, pylon-mounted miniguns. In the 2009 film G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, Apaches provide air cover for a convoy carrying nanotechnology-based weapons.  Airbus A320  An Airbus A320 aircraft appeared in the 2016 Clint Eastwood film, Sully: Miracle on the Hudson. The film is based on the true story of how Capt. Chesley \\"Sully\\" Sullenberger and the crew of US Airways Flight 1549 made an emergency landing in New York's Hudson River after the aircraft was struck by a flock of geese which disabled both engines. Airspeed Horsa The assault on what would later be known as the Pegasus Bridge over the Caen Canal in France by British commandos landing in Airspeed Horsa gliders was depicted in the 1962 war epic The Longest Day. Only one Horsa replica was actually constructed. Ten mockup Airspeed Horsa gliders were fabricated for the filming of the 1977 film A Bridge Too Far, but they were non-flyable. Albatros fighter (generic) An Albatros fighter appears in the 1966 novel In the Company of Eagles by Ernest K Gann. The novel is set in 1916 during the First World War and features a German ace pilot Lt Sebastian Kupper of Jasta 76 who, flying an Albatros scout, pursues a burning French aircraft and, in what was intended as an act of mercy, kills the pilot so as to spare him from slowly burning to death. The gesture is misinterpreted as an act of murder by one of the French pilot's comrades, Sgt. Paul Chamay who vows to seek and kill the German pilot.Muhlfeld, Edward. D. Flying Magazine Ziff Davis Publishing Company, NY. February 1967. Volume 80, No 2. p. 104. American Eagle A-1 At least two American Eagle A-1s were employed in the production of the 1930 film Young Eagles which was directed by William A. Wellman and starred Buddy Rogers and Jean Arthur. The film portrayed American pilots serving in France during the Great War. Although the A-1 was a post-WW1 trainer, the film-makers considered it suitable to portray wartime aircraft. One Eagle was painted with USAS insignia while a second was painted with German markings. Stunt pilot Dick Grace was hired to deliberately crash-land both of them in separate scenes, which severely damaged both aircraft. Grace escaped injury on both occasions.Carlson, Mark. Flying on Film: A Century of Aviation in the Movies 1912-2012 Bearmanor Media, 2012 pp. 56-58. Avro Anson This Avro Anson was used in the Australian television miniseries The Great Air Race as a \\"stand- in\\" to represent the Boeing 247 flown by Roscoe Turner in the MacRobertson Air Race. An Avro Anson was used as a \\"stand-in\\" to represent the Boeing 247 Race 57 flown in the 1934 England-to-Australia MacRobertson Air Race by Roscoe Turner, in the 1991 Australian television miniseries The Great Air Race. Turner was played by Barry Bostwick in the miniseries. Avro Ashton An Avro Ashton, in its six-engined, Olympus testbed form appeared as the fictitious Phoenix airliner in Cone of Silence (1960), based on the novel of the same name by David Beaty, a former BOAC pilot. This concerned the takeoff problems of the Phoenix, and the subsequent accident investigation; it was based on two takeoff accidents to the de Havilland Comet. Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow The Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow makes a prominent appearance in Daniel Wyatt's 1990 novel, The Last Flight of the Arrow. In the novel, the real-life destruction of the fighter is a cover for a secret US-Canadian continental air-defense initiative that fields a fleet of Arrows. A Polish-Canadian Royal Canadian Air Force pilot flies one Arrow on a high-speed reconnaissance flight over Russia to find proof that the Soviet Union is planning an airstrike on North America. Avro Lancaster Avro Lancaster The Avro Lancaster was perhaps the most well-known and successful Royal Air Force heavy bomber of World War II.RAF BBMF - The Lancaster Retrieved 14 March 2017 As such it has appeared in many works of fiction related to Bomber Command and its night raids over Germany and occupied Europe. Lancasters appeared in the 1952 British war film Appointment in London (released in the US as Raiders in the Sky) directed by Philip Leacock and starring Dirk Bogarde. Three Lancasters were used in the production‚ÄîNX673, NX679 and NX782, the same three that were used in the filming of The Dam Busters three years later. The Lancaster was central to the second half of the 1955 British film The Dam Busters. This is a dramatisation of the real-life Operation Chastise, which included the forming of No. 617 Squadron RAF commanded by Wing Commander Guy Gibson, who was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC), and the bombing of the M√∂hne, Eder and Sorpe Dams in Germany to interrupt water and hydro-electric power supplies to German munitions factories. The film is based on the books The Dam Busters by Paul Brickhill and Enemy Coast Ahead by Guy Gibson. A number of B VII Lancasters in storage were modified to the original configuration of the B III (Special) for use on screen. The Lancaster also appeared in The Guns of Navarone (1961). A 1989 British commercial for Carling Black Label lager reused Avro Lancaster footage in a Dam Busters parody sequence where a German soldier on top of a dam catches the Lancaster's bombs like a football goalkeeper. The pilot of the attacking Lancaster then delivers the brand slogan: \\"I bet he drinks Carling Black Label!\\" The commercial ran for many years, frequently appearing in commercial breaks during broadcasts of both The Dam Busters and documentaries about Operation Chastise.\\"\\"Carling Black Label ad.\\" YouTube. Retrieved: 6 August 2013. Len Deighton's 1970 novel Bomber describes an attack by Royal Air Force Lancasters on Krefeld, Germany, during which a series of unplanned incidents leads to the carpet bombing of a small town nearby. The Avro Lancaster was also featured in the UK television series Pathfinders, aired in 1972, concentrating on the lives of the aircrew of a fictional Pathfinder squadron during the Second World War.Alsop, Neil. \\"Scheduled Flight Disappears from Screen: Neil Alsop Recalls the Forgotten Heroes of TV's Pathfinders.\\" Action TV Online.

Avro Vulcan Avro Vulcans are the central feature of the 2008 aviation novel by English author Derek Robinson, titled Hullo Russia, Goodbye England. A British RAF pilot named Silk, a veteran of Bomber Command in the Second World War, rejoins the service at the height of the Cold War. The 1965 James Bond film Thunderball features the hijacking of an Avro Vulcan, although Ian Fleming‚Äôs book used an experimental Villiers Vindicator instead. B-1 Lancer A B-1B Lancer drops numerous bombs during the climactic battle scene in the 2009 film Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. B-2 Spirit Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit was featured in the 1996 20th Century Fox film Independence Day. B-2 deploys the nuclear missile at the saucer over Houston but fails because the saucer has a deflector shield. B-17 Flying Fortress Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses of the 132nd Bomb Squadron, 9th Bomb Group from March Field, California, (\\"Land of the Flying Fortress\\") were featured in the 1941 Paramount Pictures film I Wanted Wings, based on the novel of the same title by 1st Lt. Beirne Lay Jr. The 1943 Warner Bros. film Air Force, directed by Howard Hawks, used at least nine B-17B, C and D model Flying Fortresses to depict the early years of World War II, including the attack on Pearl Harbor. In William Wyler's 1946 film The Best Years of Our Lives, B-17s are prominently featured. The primary male characters hitch a cross country ride in a B-17E Flying Fortress early in the story, and at the conclusion the scrapyard at Chino, California, is shown full of disposal B-17s and YB-40 gunship versions of the B-17. B-17s also figured prominently in the Oscar- winning 1949 film Twelve O'Clock High starring Gregory Peck. The film concerns aviation leadership and the human toll in the USAAF strategy of daylight precision bombing. The US Air Force cooperated in the production of the film, lending aircraft to the producers and allowing filming at Eglin Air Force Base and at Ozark Army Air Field. The film featured an actual crash landing of a B-17, piloted by veteran stunt pilot Paul Mantz. B-17s feature in the 1951 novel The Sun is Silent by Saul Levitt which traces the journey of a B-17 crew from their training through to their daylight bombing missions over Germany. The author himself had served as a radioman/gunner in a B-17 during the war.Wald, Alan M. Trinity of Passion: The Literary Left and the Anti-Fascist Crusade, p. 197. University of North Carolina Press, 2011. For the 1954 film The Glenn Miller Story, directed by Anthony Mann, a wartime performance set in a UK air base hangar was shot in Hangar No. 1 at Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado, on 10 July 1953, with the late-production B-17G command aircraft of Gen. John G. Sprague, commanding officer of Lowry, as a backdrop. It received a wartime coat of olive drab paint for the appearance, but the chin turret was removed. Anachronistic B-29 engine cowlings line the back wall of the hangar, although B-29s were not used in the ETO. The 1958 Universal Pictures love triangle film The Lady Takes a Flyer about a woman involved with two pilots who trade in war-surplus aircraft, featured at least two B-17s. A B-17G operated by Intermountain Airlines, an actual Central Intelligence Agency front company, fitted with the Fulton recovery system, drops rescue gear to James Bond and his Bond girl in the Bahamas at the conclusion of the 1965 film Thunderball. This aircraft had actually been used by the CIA to insert and recover agents in the Arctic that had checked on an abandoned Soviet ice station under Project COLDFEET in 1963. Two DB-17P former drone-controllers and one B-17F were featured in the 1969 film The Thousand Plane Raid. Five flyable B-17s were secured by producer Elmo Williams for use in the filming of the 1970 motion picture Tora! Tora! Tora!. During filming, one B-17 suffered a malfunction in its landing gear, forcing it to land on one wheel. Williams ordered a camera crew to film the landing and incorporated the footage into the film's script. The \\"Pacific Pearl\\", an ill-fated B-17, is the setting of one segment of the 1981 animated film Heavy Metal. The B-17 Flying Fortress was the subject of the 1990 Warner Bros. film Memphis Belle. During filming, one of the five vintage B-17s was destroyed in an accidental crash and a second was damaged when an engine cowling detached in flight, tearing a chunk out of the aircraft's tail. There were no injuries in either incident. B-17s are the main aircraft featured in two novels depicting fictional characters in the US daylight bombing offensive over Germany and Occupied Europe, American writer Sam Helpert's A Real Good War (1997) and UK author Robert Radcliffe's Under an English Heaven (2004). For George Lucas' 2012 film Red Tails about the 332d Fighter Group, the Tuskegee Airmen, the B-17G \\"Pink Lady\\" operated by the Association Forteresse Toujours Volante, appeared as a 351st Bomb Group aircraft named \\"Yankee\\", coded ED-N. Filmed in the Czech Republic in 2010, the film company funding allowed the warbird to fly for an additional year before being retired to museum status. Other Flying Fortresses were rendered through CGI. B-17s feature in the 2014 graphic novel mini-series Castles in the Sky, published by Avatar, written by Garth Ennis and illustrated by Matt Martin & Keith Burns. The story features a gunner named Leonard Wetmore who is one of the crew of the B-17 'Buffalo Gal' during the US daylight bombing offensive against Germany. The story was one of Ennis' War Stories series. B-18 Bolo Douglas B-18 Bolos are prominently featured in the 1943 RKO picture Bombardier, filmed at Kirtland Field, New Mexico. B-24 Liberator A Consolidated B-24 Liberator was featured in the 1977 Telemovie Young Joe, the Forgotten Kennedy. B-24s feature in the 1944 20th Century Fox film Winged Victory which was directed by George Cukor and which portrayed cadets undergoing training as aircrew in the USAF during WW2. The USAF loaned several B-24s to the production which was filmed at Santa Ana army airfield in California.Carlson, Mark. Flying on Film: A Century of Aviation in the Movies, 1912-2012. Bearmanor Publishing, 2012. p95-96. The novel Face of a Hero (1950) tells the story of a B-24 crew operating from an airport in Apulia, Italy, in 1944; it is based on the real experiences of its author, Louis Falstein, who had been a tail gunner on a USAAF B-24. The novel describes in detail the raids of the B-24 bombers on Romania, Yugoslavia, northern Italy, southern France, and Germany. B-24s are a central feature in the 1952 novel Angle of Attack by Joseph Landon. The story concerns navigator Irwin 'Win' Hellman, whose B-24 is attacked by enemy fighters and badly damaged over Vienna. The B-24's pilot signals to the enemy fliers that he wishes to surrender but Hellman, who is Jewish and dreads being captured alive, believes they can still escape and, with the backing of the other crew, he takes command.Harap, Louis. Creative Awakening: The Jewish Presence in Twentieth Century American Literature, 1900-1940s. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1987. p. 145. B-24s also feature in the 1957 novel The Damned Wear Wings by David Camerer, a work that portrays B-24s of the 473rd Bomb Group based in Italy tasked with bombing the oil refineries at Ploesti, Romania. The story of the \\"Lady Be Good\\" inspired a 1970 television movie titled Sole Survivor, with a North American B-25 Mitchell playing the B-24D role. In the young adult novel Under a War-Torn Sky, the main character Henry Forester co-pilots Out of the Blue, a US B-24 Liberator serving in the Royal Air Force. B-24s feature in the 1979 novel The White Sea Bird by David Beaty, a story about an RAF bomber unit whose commander becomes obsessed with hunting a German surface raider lurking in a secret base in a Norwegian Fjord and menacing Allied convoys at sea. B-25 Mitchell The North American B-25 Mitchell had feature roles in the films Thirty Seconds over Tokyo (1944) (pilot Ted Lawson's account of the Doolittle Raid), Hanover Street (1979) based on a fictional B-25 unit stationed in England, and Forever Young (1992), following a B-25 test pilot's story both in the past and present. A B-25 features in the 1965 World War II film In Harm's Way directed by Otto Preminger and starring John Wayne and Kirk Douglas. The Sole Survivor, a 1970 telemovie, was also based loosely on the \\"Lady Be Good\\", and also featured a B-25 in the Liberator role. It first aired 9 January 1970. The B-25 is featured in the 1970 Mike Nichols film Catch-22, which had 17 film unit B-25s in flying condition. Like the Battle of Britains resurrection and ultimate preservation of German and British aviation combatants, the Catch-22 air force helped form a nucleus of the nascent warbirds movement. Fifteen of the 18 bombers used in the film still remain intact, including one on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum. B-25s feature in the 1976 novel Whip by Martin Caidin, which portrays a B-25 unit based in Australia and commanded by Captain 'Whip' Russell and they are employed in low-level bombing missions against Japanese convoys carrying reinforcements to Guadalcanal and Rabaul in 1942. The B-25 was the focus of the second half of the 2001 film Pearl Harbor, although critics complained that the bomber and its role were being depicted inaccurately. A B-25 is used in the 2011 film Sucker Punch. B-25s appear in the 2019 Hulu mini-series Catch-22 directed by George Clooney. Two vintage B-25s were used in the production and other B-25s were re-created with CGI. B-29 Superfortress The Boeing B-29 Superfortress has played an important role in several Hollywood films, particularly the Enola Gay, which dropped the first atomic bomb. The Enola Gay was depicted in Above and Beyond and The Beginning or the End. B-29s feature in the 1951 novel Don't Touch Me by Mackinlay Kantor which depicted a B-29 unit based in Nyoka air-base, Japan and tasked with flying bombing missions to Korea.Bright, Charles D.

The first Hollywood retelling of the 509th Composite Group's preparation for the atomic missions was Above and Beyond, released by MGM in 1953, with Robert Taylor portraying Col. Paul Tibbetts, and Jim Backus as Gen. Curtis LeMay. Filmed at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. A B-29 features in the 1954 Cold War drama Hell and High Water directed by Samuel Fuller and starring Richard Widmark. The film's plot concerns a plan by the Chinese to use a captured B-29 to launch an atomic strike on Korea and then let the US take the blame for it. B-29s feature in the 1956 novel Roll Back the Sky by Ward Taylor which portrayed B-29 crews bombing Japan during 1945.Call, Steven. Selling Air Power: Military aviation & American popular culture after World War Two. Texas A&M; University Press, 2009, pp. 53-55. The B-29 also played the titular role in the 1980 Disney film The Last Flight of Noah's Ark. Film makers also used the only B-29 still flying in 1983 in the film The Right Stuff to recreate the launch of the Bell X-1 for the first supersonic flight. B-36 Peacemaker The Convair B-36 featured prominently in Paramount's 1955 film Strategic Air Command starring James Stewart, who plays a World War II bomber pilot and member of the Air Force Reserve and is forced to crash land in the Arctic. The film features many good aerial shots of B-36s and was primarily filmed at Carswell AFB, Texas, and MacDill AFB in Tampa, Florida, and Al Lang Field in nearby St. Petersburg, Florida. One particularly difficult shot was that of Stewart's character, a baseball player, standing on the baseball field at Al Lang Field while a B-36 flies overhead and casts a shadow over him, foreshadowing his imminent recall to active service. B-47 Stratojet B-47 Stratojet The Boeing B-47 Stratojet gets a secondary role in Paramount's 1955 film Strategic Air Command, starring James Stewart, as the new jet that is nothing like the old Convair B-36 he is used to. The film features good aerial footage of both the B-47 and the B-36. The majority of B-47 scenes were filmed at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, using aircraft from the 306th Bombardment Wing. Ejection seat testing of B-47s performed at Eglin AFB, Florida, in 1953 and 1954 as part of aeromedical research was recreated in the 1955 20th Century Fox film On the Threshold of Space starring Guy Madison, and in a 1957 Pine-Thomas Productions drama Bailout at 43,000.\\"Bailout at 43,000 (1957) - Overview\\".

The B-52 was also a key part of Stanley Kubrick's 1964 black comedy film Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. A B-52 was a focal point of the 1983 novel Trinity's Child, by William Prochnau, and the 1990 telemovie adaptation, By Dawn's Early Light. Bell 47 The 1950s syndicated American television series Whirlybirds, produced by Desilu Studios, starred a pair of Bell 47 helicopters. The association with Whirlybirds continues to be used to promote helicopters and the Bell 47 in particular. A Bell 47 was also one of the 'stars' of the Australian television series Skippy the Bush Kangaroo. In the opening scenes of Federico Fellini's 1960 comedy-drama film La Dolce Vita a Bell 47 transports a statue of Christ across the city of Rome. A second Bell 47 in pursuit contains the reporter Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni) and his sidekick Papparazo. A Bell 47J equipped with floats was used in the 1965 James Bond film Thunderball. The helicopter lands on the water as Bond searches for an Avro Vulcan bomber that has gone missing. A Bell 47G3B-1 was used as the \\"Batcopter\\" in the 1966 Batman film. This airframe had previously appeared in Lassie Come Home. A Bell 47 depicted a supposed German helicopter in the 1968 action film Where Eagles Dare. Although experimental German helicopter types did exist in this time period, the Focke-Achgelis Fa 223 was a larger, twin-rotor machine, which was used on only a limited basis. The Bell 47, in its military configuration as a H-13 Sioux, was central to the 1970 film M*A*S*H, as well as the 1972‚Äì1983 M*A*S*H television series based on it. In the 1979 Norman Jewison film, ...And Justice For All, the main characters go for a ride in a Bell 47G-2 that ends up ditching in Baltimore's Inner Harbor when it runs out of fuel. Bell 206 Chopper Squad was a 1970s Australian television series about a Bell 206 JetRanger used for rescue work in Sydney. The helicopter used was an actual rescue helicopter operated by the Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service. A Bell 206B was one of the helicopters that attacks the oil rig control center of Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the climactic scenes of the 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever. The Jet Ranger also appeared in the 1977 Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me In the 1983 film Blue Thunder, a Jet Ranger is portrayed as a LAPD helicopter flying for the Astro division. Also appears in the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, as another LAPD helicopter, which is stolen by the T-1000 Terminator and flown under an expressway to pursue John Connor, Sarah Connor and the T-800 Terminator protecting them. Bell 222 A Bell 222A was featured in the telemovie Airwolf, which starred Jan-Michael Vincent and Ernest Borgnine. Within the year, the film was made into a TV series which aired from 1984 to 1986. Bell AH-1 Cobra In the 1990 film Fire Birds, a Bell AH-1 Cobra of the United States Army emerges in the opening sequence, when it is ambushed by a drug runner's Scorpion helicopter portrayed by a McDonnell Douglas MD 500 Defender. A pair of AH-1s appear in Simon West's 1997 film Con Air. The helicopters are used in an attempt to bring down a hijacked Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS) aircraft. In J. J. Abrams 2006 film Mission: Impossible III, the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) team use a Bell 204 to escape after rescuing one of their team members. They must evade an AH-1 Cobra, which pursues them through a wind farm, firing heat seeking rockets at them. Bell UH-1 Iroquois The Bell UH-1 Iroquois The Bell UH-1 Iroquois (commonly called the Huey) was the most common helicopter during the Vietnam War, as an aircraft used to insert and remove troops from the field, transport casualties for medical treatment and as a gunship.UH-1 Iroquois \\"Huey\\" Helicopter Vietnam Helicopters Museum Retrieved 14 March 2017 As such, it has appeared in many works of fiction related to the war. The UH-1 was an important part of the 1968 film The Green Berets. The production company paid $18,623.64 for the material, the eighty-five hours of flying time by UH-1 helicopters, and thirty-eight hundred man-days for military personnel taken away from their regular duties. Two UH-1H Hueys make up part of the attack package on Ernst Stavro Blofeld's oil rig command center at the climax of the 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever. The UH-1 was in Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 film Apocalypse Now. Several Hueys were rented from the Philippine Air Force. The distinct and iconic sound of the helicopters was featured prominently in the film's sound design of the soundtrack. UH-1s were prominently featured in Oliver Stone's 1986 film Platoon. The 1990 film Air America, about the CIA's proprietary airline during the war in Southeast Asia, featured the ubiquitous Huey helicopter. A Bell 205 is used as a mountain rescue helicopter in the 1993 film Cliffhanger. The aircraft is used to locate a missing jet and then employed to find stolen money. Towards the film's end the helicopter is dangling upside down against a cliff, where the hero (Sylvester Stallone) and villain (John Lithgow) brawl on the belly of the aircraft. In the 1997 disaster film Dante's Peak, a UH-1 transports a group of scientists into the crater of a volcano, and is ultimately destroyed in an ensuing eruption. The UH-1 is a central part of the 2002 Vietnam war film We Were Soldiers. The helicopter is shown ferrying troops into the Ia Drang valley as part of the then-new concept of air cavalry. The film particularly focused on the flights of Major Bruce Crandall, who was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions while piloting his UH-1 during the battle depicted in the film. Four of the UH-1s used were provided by the Georgia Army National Guard. The slaying of Israeli athletes by Black September terrorists and the destruction of a Bundesgrenzschutz Bell/Dornier UH-1D during the 1972 Summer Olympics was depicted in the 2005 Steven Spielberg film Munich. UH-1 helicopters are seen as the primary transport aircraft in the 2017 film Kong: Skull Island, and are attacked by Kong after launching seismic bombs in an attempt to map the Island's caves. Bell X-1 Bell X-1 The Bell X-1 was depicted early in the film The Right Stuff. The film showed the historic flight of the X-1 becoming the first aircraft to break the sound barrier in level flight under its own propulsion. This achievement helped usher in the US space program that was the subject of the rest of the film. A mock-up built for the film is now displayed at the Planes of Fame Museum, Chino, California. Bell X-2 A Bell X-2 mock-up was built for the pilot-film of the TV series Quantum Leap. It is now on display at the Planes of Fame Museum, Chino, California.

The Boeing 247D flown by Turner and Clyde Edward Pangborn in the 1934 MacRobertson Trophy Air Race, was portrayed by an Avro Anson, VH-BAF, in the 1991 Australian mini-series The Great Air Race, also known as Half a World Away. The 1936 movie Without Orders centers on the emergency landing of a Boeing 247 by the stewardess. The 1936 movie 13 Hours by Air takes place largely aboard a transcontinental Boeing 247 flight and includes significant historically interesting second-unit footage of actual terminal facilities on United Air Lines's then-new transcontinental route network. Boeing 707 The 1961 episode \\"The Odyssey of Flight 33\\" of television series The Twilight Zone takes place on a Boeing 707 with the aircraft traveling through various periods of history. A Boeing 707-349C leased from Flying Tiger Line portrayed two aircraft in the 1970 film Airport, based on the 1968 Arthur Hailey novel of the same name. The Boeing 707 is featured as the titular aircraft in Airplane!, a 1980 disaster-parody film by Jon Davison. In 2011, the American television series Pan Am took place in the early and mid-1960s and featured interior sets and exterior CGI representations of the 707 on the ground and in flight; it was Pan Am's flagship airliner during that time. Additional footage of John Travolta's Boeing 707 in Pan Am livery has also been used in the TV series. Boeing 720 A former United Airlines Boeing 720B stood in for a Boeing VC-137C, Air Force One, serialled 62-6001, in the 1971 ABC Entertainment Group telemovie The President's Plane Is Missing, based on the 1967 novel of the same title by Robert J. Serling, in which the SAM flight carrying the US president crashes in a storm in Arizona. Boeing 727 Industrial Light and Magic constructed a large-scale model of a Boeing 727 of fibreglass and aluminum for use in the 1990 action film Die Hard 2. The 1996 film Eraser includes an elaborate action sequence involving a parachute jump from a crippled Boeing 727. The 1998 film U.S. Marshals depicts the crash of a 727 from the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS). Boeing 737 In the 2008 TV series Breaking Bad, the mid-air crash between two Boeing 737 over Albuquerque, referred as the Wayfarer 515 disaster, takes an important part in the plot. Because of it, this model is featured and mentioned several times during the second season. Also, the episode \\"Seven Thirty-Seven\\" is named for the aircraft; and is the first of several episode titles that foreshadow the Wayfarer 515 disaster. When placed together, they read \\"Seven Thirty-Seven Down Over ABQ\\". Boeing 747 Boeing VC-25 Air Force One A redressed Boeing 747 of American Airlines was featured extensively in the 1974 film Airport 1975, and the sequel Airport 77. A Boeing 747 is the aircraft flown by passengers in the 1975 made for telemovie Murder on Flight 502. A Moonraker Space Shuttle is stolen in mid-air from the back of a Boeing 747 at the start of the 1979 James Bond film Moonraker. A Boeing 747 featured in the 1981 Australian film The Survivor, a supernatural horror film directed by David Hemmings about an airline pilot (played by Robert Powell) who mysteriously survives a 747 crash that wipes out all of the other occupants. The film was based on the novel by English author James Herbert.Beck, Simon. D. The Aircraft-Spotter's Film & Television Companion, p. 185. McFarland Press, 2016. In the 1990 action film Die Hard 2, a 747 that has been hijacked by terrorists is destroyed by John McClane. Three 23-foot models were fabricated by Industrial Light and Magic with one destroyed during filming done at a remote airstrip in the Mojave Desert of California. The effects were matched to a real 747 filmed taxiing at Alpena, Michigan. The cost of the special effects pushed the film's production costs towards the then-record of $70 million. The Boeing 747 was featured in the 1996 film Executive Decision as the location of a terrorist hijacking. A 747‚Äì212B, rented from Kalitta Air, was the title subject of the 1997 film Air Force One, portraying the real 747-200-based VC-25 that transports the US president. The 747 was also prominent in the novel and the 2002 film The Sum of All Fears as the National Airborne Operations Center during a nuclear showdown with Russia. A 747 in- flight is also the setting for the 2006 horror-thriller film Snakes on a Plane in which a large number of venomous snakes wriggle loose on the large jet. An All Nippon Airways Boeing 747-400 was featured in the 2008 Japanese movie Happy Flight. Boeing 757 United Airlines Boeing 757 A Boeing 757 is the setting of the 2006 film United 93, that is based on the events on board United Airlines Flight 93 which was hijacked during the September 11 attacks in 2001.Heath, Iver (January 1, 2006). \\"Four Years On, a Cabin's-Eye View of 9/11\\".

The movie is based on the Cessna 188 Pacific rescue that took place in 1978. The plane in the actual rescue was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 and the Boeing 767 was not introduced into the Air New Zealand fleet until 1985. The Boeing 767 is the setting of the 2014 action film Non-Stop in which a killer onboard is executing passengers and crew. Boeing 777 A modified Boeing 777 was used as the United States Air Force mothership for an experimental NASA spaceplane in the 2006 film Superman Returns. Boeing-Stearman Model 75 In 1950, Paul Mantz tore the wings off a Boeing PT-13D (Model 75) Stearman by flying between two oaks for the 1950 film When Willie Comes Marching Home.Editors, Air Classics, Challenge Publications, Canoga Park, California, July 1972, Volume 8, Number 8, p. 39. A crop-dusting Stearman, N6340, was featured early in the 1963 Elvis Presley film It Happened at the World's Fair.Beck, Simon D., The Aircraft-Spotter's Film and Television Companion, p. 326. McFarland & Company, Inc., Jeffferson, North Carolina, 2016, . A Boeing Stearman appears in the climactic scene of the Disney Sci-Fi film The Cat from Outer Space (1978). The scene involves a mid-air transfer of characters between the Stearman and a Gazelle helicopter. The Stearman is a wreck but is flown by the powers of the magic necklace belonging to the cat Jake. More recently, Model 75s have appeared in a number of films including Independence Day (1996), The English Patient (1997), and Pearl Harbor (2001). Bristol Beaufighter Bristol Beaufighter Graphic novelist Garth Ennis' 2007 revival of the old British war comic hero Battler Britton: Bloody Good Show, featured the ace fighter pilot commanding a squadron of Bristol Beaufighters in North Africa during the Second World War.  Bristol Blenheim  Bristol Blenheims appear in the 1945 British film The Way to the Stars (released in the US as Johnny in the Clouds). In the early part of the film, Pilot Officer Peter Penrose (John Mills), a '15-hour sprog' (rookie) arrives at Halfpenny Field, a Royal Air- Force aerodrome, in the summer of 1940 and joins B-Flight of No 72 Squadron, equipped with Blenheims and commanded by Flight-Lieutenant David Archdale (Michael Redgrave).Rowan, Terry.

Another passenger, rendered mentally unstable by the loss of his daughter, releases a toxic gas on board the aircraft, rendering the flight crew unconscious, leaving the prisoner as the only person capable of flying the aircraft. Despite the film's title, the Bristol Type 175 was a turbo-prop engined aircraft rather than a jet-powered plane.Beck, Simon D. The Aircraft-Spotter's Film and Television Guide. McFarland Publishers, 2016. p129-130. Bristol F2B In the long-running British First World War comic strip Charley's War, published in Battle Picture Weekly 1979‚Äì1986 and written by Pat Mills and illustrated by Joe Colquhoun, the storyline goes on a tangent when Charley Bourne's younger brother Wilf enlists under-age and becomes an observer/gunner in a Bristol F2B squadron in France in early 1918. A replica Bristol F2B mounted on skis was featured in the 1981 film Death Hunt which starred Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin. The replica, which was constructed in the US and had an inverted Ford Ranger engine instead of a Rolls-Royce, was originally commissioned in 1979 to appear in the film High Road to China (1983), but was not used in that production. The fictional RFC unit featured in Derek Robinson's 1999 novel Hornet's Sting, set in 1917 over the Western Front, exchange their outdated Sopwith Pups for the new Bristol F2Bs.

Bristol Type 170 Freighter A Bristol Type 170 Freighter Mk. 11A played a major role in the 1957 British film The Man in the Sky directed by Charles Crichton and starring Jack Hawkins who played a test pilot. A major sequence of the film features Hawkins testing a Bristol Type 170 when one of the engines catches fire and he has to stay aloft long enough to use up enough fuel to make an emergency landing with one engine and one wheel. The film was distributed in the US under the title Decision Against Time. The Bristol Freighter that starred in the film was damaged in a crash during filming. After repairs it returned to service with Silver City Airways until it was retired and scrapped in 1962.  Britten- Norman BN-2 Islander  A BN-2 Islander features in the 2015 James Bond film Spectre.

B√ºcker B√º 181 In the 1963 epic film The Great Escape, the prisoners of war played by James Garner and Donald Pleasence steal a Luftwaffe B√ºcker B√º 181, a plot invention for the movie. In the actual escape from Stalag Luft III, no aircraft were involved. Pleasence, an aircraft wireless operator with No. 166 Squadron, however, was imprisoned in Stalag Luft I after his Lancaster was shot down over Germany on 31 August 1944.Chorley, W.R.

Campbell, Jr. In the 1955 British film The Night My Number Came Up directed by Leslie Norman and starring Michael Redgrave and Denholm Elliott, a man tells guests at a dinner party of a dream he had of a Tokyo-bound Dakota that crashes in the Japanese mountains. Some of the guests board such a flight the next day and they begin to fear the dream is coming true. Eleven aircraft were gathered for airdrop scenes in the 1977 film A Bridge Too Far, all of which had to be of a paratroop configuration, representing the C-53 Skytrooper variant. A Douglas C-47 DL Skytrain featured in the climatic scenes of the 1982 film The Wild Geese which starred Richard Burton and Roger Moore as the leaders of a group of British mercenaries sent to rescue a deposed African leader. The C-47 used in the film belonged to United Air of South Africa and was nick-named 'The Wild Goose' after its film role. The aircraft was destroyed in a crash in South Africa in 1988 which claimed the lives of all 24 people on board.Beck, Simon D. The Aircraft-Spotter's Film & Television Guide, pp. 216-217. McFarland Publishers, 2016. C-54 Skymaster The 20th Century Fox production The Big Lift (originally titled Quartered City), set during the Berlin Airlift, was filmed in Berlin at a former German studio near Tempelhof in 1949 and Douglas C-54 Skymasters were prominently featured. Military personnel from Rhein-Main Air Base appeared as extras. C-74 Globemaster A Douglas C-74 Globemaster appeared in the 1969 Michael Caine film The Italian Job. C-82 Packet The crash of a Fairchild C-82 Packet in the North African desert is central to the plot of the 1965 film The Flight of the Phoenix drawn from a 1964 novel by Elleston Trevor of the same title.

C-123 Provider In the 1990 action film Die Hard 2, John McClane ejects from the cockpit of a grounded Fairchild C-123 Provider for a parachute recovery just before terrorists destroy it. A full-scale fuselage mock-up, molded from a real Provider, was rigged with 3,000 bullet hits, each one drilled and loaded with a charge, tapped, and wired to discharge in sequence. Actual pyrotechnics work was done at Indian Dunes, California, with actor Bruce Willis' ejection composited into the shot later. The 1990 film Air America loosely recounted the exploits of the Central Intelligence Agency proprietary airline in Southeast Asia in the 1960s and early 1970s and featured Fairchild C-123K Providers leased from the Royal Thai Air Force. The C-123 was featured in the 1997 film Con Air, with much of the film's action taking place in and around the aircraft. Three C-123s were used in the production of the film. One aircraft was used for all of the flying sequences. Another was used for the taxiing scenes and the third Provider, non-airworthy and in poor condition, was dismantled and its fuselage used for the filming of the climatic crash scene. C-130 Hercules Lockheed AC-130 The 1976 film Raid on Entebbe was based on a real-life Israeli military rescue mission which relied on the unique short-field capabilities of the C-130. In the place of a Soviet transport plane, a Lockheed C-130 Hercules (or Lockheed L-100 Hercules civilian model in military markings) was featured in the 1987 James Bond film The Living Daylights; a C-123K Provider was used for some tail ramp fight scene close-ups. The special operations variant, the Lockheed MC-130 Combat Talon, was featured as the rescue aircraft in the 1997 film Air Force One, performing a daring mid-air rescue of the President and his family as Air Force One is failing and going into the water. In the 2007 film Transformers a close air support variant of the C-130, the AC-130 gunship, is used to drive off the Decepticons after the military base in Qatar is attacked, by executing a pylon turn to deliver ground fire. In the 2007 game Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, the player uses an AC-130H for support. The AC-130H is also playable during the mission \\"Death from Above\\" and during online multiplayer. In the 2013 film Olympus Has Fallen, a C-130 armed with multi-barrel cannons attacks Washington, D.C. and shoots down two USAF F-22 Raptor fighters sent to intercept it. The C-130 is shot down by another F-22 and crashes into the Washington Monument, causing part of it to collapse. In the 2013 film Lone Survivor, an AC-130 variant provides firepower as Luttrell is extracted from the village towards the end of the film. CAC Wirraway A restored Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation Wirraway, an Australian production variant of the North American NA-16 Harvard, appeared in the beach landing scenes in the 1998 war film The Thin Red Line directed by Terence Malick and based on the 1962 James Jones novel of the same name.

In the film, the Italian aeronautical designer Giovanni Caproni appears as a mentor to Horikoshi in several dream sequences, one of which features a tour of the Ca.60. CASA 2.111 Several ex-Spanish Air Force CASA 2.111s were used as \\"stand-ins\\" to depict German Heinkel He 111 bombers in the 1969 film Battle of Britain. Four ex-Spanish CASA 2.111s, playing the role of Luftwaffe Heinkel He 111s, were also used in the production of the 1970 Oscar-winning film Patton, starring George C. Scott. Caudron 277 A Caudron 277 was used to play the role of both British and German two-seaters in the 1966 First World War aerial epic The Blue Max directed by John Guillermin and based on the 1964 novel of the same name by Jack D.

These were recreated using measurements taken from a surviving example at the Museum of Army Flying, Middle Wallop, Hampshire, England. CH-34 Choctaw / Westland Wessex A surplus US Army Sikorsky S-58DT (a converted UH-34D) was prominently featured as Screaming Mimi in the 1984‚Äì86 television series Riptide, and remains in service. Westland Wessex helicopters portrayed CH-34 Choctaws in Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket. Turbine- repowered Sikorsky S-58Ts portrayed CH-34 Choctaws in the 1990 film Air America about the exploits of the Central Intelligence Agency proprietary airline during the war in Southeast Asia. CH-46 Sea Knight / Boeing-Vertol 107 In the 1967 James Bond film You Only Live Twice a KV-107 has an electromagnet slung loaded underneath, and is used to airlift an antagonist's car off the road, thereby freeing up 007 from their pursuit. A Kawasaki-built KV-107 portrays a UH-46 Sea Knight of the United States Navy that airlifts a team of hijackers aboard the in the 1992 film Under Siege, and is later depicted being blown up on the ship's fantail. Filming was done aboard the museum ship. CH-47 Chinook / Boeing-Vertol 234 In the 2000 film Rules of Engagement two Boeing-Vertol 234 Chinook helicopters are portrayed as Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knights of the United States Marine Corps. The helicopters transport a rescue team to evacuate personal from a fallen embassy in Yemen. A CH-47D performs the rescue mission by pulling up a wrecked Super Puma in the film Rescue Under Fire. Cirrus SR22 Starting in 2007, the Cirrus SR22 became one of two aircraft (along with the F-16 Fighting Falcon) to be featured in Google Earth Flight Simulator.

In the 1982 episode \\"Time-Flight\\" of the BBC sci fi series Doctor Who a Concorde, its passengers, and crew are pulled through time to a prehistoric version of Earth. The Aerialbot Silverbolt of the Transformers turns into a Concorde. In the 2010 Charles Stross novel The Fuller Memorandum, the occult arm of the British government maintains four Concordes for use as supersonic reconnaissance aircraft to monitor the Sleeper in the Pyramid. In the event of the Black Pharaoh awakening, the Concordes are to be used as nuclear bombers to attempt to contain the threat before it manifests on Earth. In the 2017 film The Wife, two significant scenes, including the final one in the movie, take place on Concorde flights transporting a Nobel Prize winner. They were shot in the aircraft displayed at Scotland's National Museum of Flight. Consolidated NY United States Navy Consolidated NY trainers from Floyd Bennett Field appeared as some of the biplanes that attack King Kong atop the Empire State Building in the 1933 original film. Convair XF-92 The Convair XF-92, an experimental delta-wing interceptor, played the role of an F-102 Delta Dagger in the 1956 film Toward the Unknown starring William Holden. Curtiss JN-4 Jenny A pair of Curtiss JN-4 Jenny biplanes featured in the 1919 silent film The Grim Game which starred Harry Houdini. In the film, the script originally called for a mid-air transfer of one of the characters between the two Jennys but while filming the scene, the two aircraft collided. Both pilots managed to safely crash-land and there were no injuries. The producers subsequently altered the script and incorporated the footage into the final cut.Carlson, Mark. Flying on Film: A Century of Aviation in the Movies 1912-2012, pp. 34-35. Bearmanor Media, 2012. A Curtiss JN-4 featured in the 1921 silent film Stranger than Fiction which starred Katherine MacDonald. The Jenny features in a major sequence in which the aircraft takes off from the roof of a 10-storey building in downtown Los Angeles. To film the scene, stunt pilot Frank Clarke took off from a wooden ramp. Prior to launching, the Jenny was fixed to an anchor with a rope which was cut after Clarke revved the engine to full power. Nonetheless, the Jenny dropped five storeys before Clarke was able to level out and fly along the length of Broadway street. It is not known if the producers asked permission from city officials prior to performing the stunt.Carlson, Mark. Flying on Film: A Century of Aviation in the Movies 1912-2012, pp. 31-32. Bearmanor Media, 2012. A pair of JN-4s also featured in the 1925 film The Cloud Rider. In one major scene, one of the Jennys flown by the film's female lead (played by Virginia Lee Corbin) loses a wheel (her plane having been sabotaged by the film's villains) and has to be assisted mid-air by the male lead (played by Al Wilson) who has another JN-4 pilot fly him alongside so he can climb onto the former's wing to render assistance. To film the scene, pilot Frank Clarke wore a wig to resemble the actress and after the aerial shots were completed, he was required to safely land his JN-4 with only one wheel.Carlson, Mark Flying on Film: A Century of Aviation in the Movies 1912-2012, pp. 37-38. Bearmanor Media, 2012. A JN-4 appeared in the 1926 film The Woman with Four Faces directed by Herbert Brenon. Once again, Frank Clarke was employed as a stunt pilot. For one scene, he was required to double as the male lead and, while landing his aircraft, wave at actress Betty Compson. However, when Clarke took his eyes off the runway, his Jenny crashed into a tree but the pilot escaped without injury.Carlson, Mark.

During the filming the aircraft actually crashed while landing on a lake and sank. This accident was not in the original script, but the footage was retained and incorporated into the film's plot. The aircraft was recovered from the lake, repaired, restored and exported to the US. The DHC-2 was central to the 1998 film Six Days Seven Nights. The actual flying in the film was done by its star, Harrison Ford, who enjoyed flying the Beaver so much that he bought one after filming was completed. Three flying Beavers and four non-flyable were used in the production, all detailed to exactly match one another. de Havilland Comet The de Havilland Comet airliner is featured in the 1952 British film The Sound Barrier.

F4U Corsair F4U Corsair Vought F4U Corsairs featured in the latter part of the 1951 RKO war movie Flying Leathernecks which was directed by Nicholas Ray and starred John Wayne & Robert Ryan. The film's fictional Marine Air Corps unit exchange their older fighters for new F4Us as they support the drive across the Pacific in the latter stages of the war. For the film, the producers borrowed a number of flying F4Us which were then serving as trainers at the Marine Air Base at El Toro, California, and they also incorporated some wartime colour footage of F4Us taken during WW2.Carlson, Mark. Flying on Film: A Century of Aviation in the Movies, 1912-2012, pp. 225-227. Bearmanor Media, 2012. F4Us also featured in the 1952 Monogram film Flat Top which was directed by Lesley Selander and starred Sterling Hayden. In the film, Hayden plays Commander Dan Collier who takes command of a squadron of un-disciplined fighter pilots on board an aircraft carrier and is tasked with getting them combat-ready before the invasion of the Japanese-occupied Philippines in 1944. The film made extensive use of colour wartime footage of carrier-borne F4Us.Carlson, Mark. Flying on Film: A Century of Aviation in the Movies, 1912-2012, pp. 224-225. Bearmanor Media, 2012. The F4U Corsair was a regularly featured aircraft of VMF-214 in the 1976‚Äì1978 television series Baa Baa Black Sheep, based on the experiences of Pappy Boyington. The series was later renamed Black Sheep Squadron. Computer-generated images of F4U Corsairs appear in the 2006 Second World War drama Flags of Our Fathers directed by Clint Eastwood. An F4U Corsair named Skipper Riley (voiced by Stacy Keach) is one of the characters in Disney's animated TV series and films \\"Air Mater\\" (2011), Planes (2013). F-5 Freedom Fighter/Tiger II Northrop F-5s played the part of the fictional MiG-28 enemy aircraft in the 1986 film Top Gun. F5F Skyrocket The sole Grumman XF5F-1 Skyrocket, which never entered production or squadron service, was incorporated as the primary mount for Blackhawk and the Blackhawk Squadron in wartime editions of the anthology series Military Comics published by Quality Comics, the first issue of which was published in August 1941. The long-running title was later acquired by DC Comics, with the squadron upgrading to more modern types. F6F Hellcat Grumman F6F Hellcats appeared in the 1951 motion picture Flying Leathernecks directed by Nicholas Ray and starring John Wayne. One of the pilots who flew aircraft for the aerial scenes in the production was Marine Captain Phil De Groot who, after completing work on the film, flew in the Korean War and was wounded in action. The production was filmed at a small airstrip at Camp Pendleton, California. De Groot said, \\"They put some sand all over the strip, and some palm trees, and built a little pagoda there, simulating Guadalcanal...\\" F6Fs appear in the 1964 novel The Last Tallyho by Richard Newhafer, a work inspired by the author's real-life experiences as a Hellcat pilot during WW2.Reynolds, Clark. The Fast Carriers: The Forging of an Air Navy, pp. 435‚Äì436. Naval Institute Press, 2015. F6Fs also feature in the 1978 novel Wingmen by Ensan Case, a novel depicting US Navy fighter pilots serving on a fictional aircraft carrier- the 'USS Constitution'. The carrier's fighter squadron- VF-20- takes part in the Pacific War 1943-1944 and it centres on the experiences of two of its members- ensign Fred Trusteau and the squadron- commander, Lt Jack Hardigan. Computer-generated images of F6F Hellcats appear in the 2002 Second World War drama Windtalkers directed by John Woo and starring Nicolas Cage. F9F Panther Grumman F9F Panthers The Grumman F9F-2 Panther was prominently featured in the 1954 films Men of the Fighting Lady and The Bridges at Toko-Ri, although the protagonist instead flew a McDonnell F2H Banshee in the 1953 novel of the same name on which the latter film was based. Footage of the famous non-fatal F9F-5 Panther ramp strike accident that occurred on 23 June 1951 as Commander George Chamberlain Duncan attempted to land on in BuNo 125228, in which the forward fuselage broke away and rolled down the deck, has been used in several films including Men of the Fighting Lady, Midway (1976), and The Hunt For Red October (1990). F11F Tiger In Alas, Babylon, the post-apocalyptic 1959 novel by Pat Frank, a heat-seeking missile launched by a Grumman F11F Tiger that accidentally strikes the port area of Latakia, Syria, sets off secondary explosions and gives the Soviet Union the casus belli for preemptive nuclear strikes against the US. F-14 Tomcat Grumman F-14D Tomcat The Grumman F-14 Tomcat was central to the 1986 film Top Gun. The aviation-themed film was such a success in creating interest in naval aviation that the US Navy, which assisted with the film, set up recruitment desks outside some theaters. Producers paid the US Navy $886,000 as reimbursement for flight time of aircraft in the film with an F-14 billed at $7,600 per flight hour. Two F-14As of VF-84 from the appeared in the 1980 film The Final Countdown, with four from the squadron in the 1996 release Executive Decision, the Jolly Rogers' final film appearance before being disestablished. The military legal drama TV series JAG (1995‚Äì2005) featured lead character Harmon Rabb, a Tomcat pilot-turned-lawyer, and the Tomcat was a central part of the Stephen Coonts novel Final Flight. The F-14 Tomcat is the primary focus of the 1987 Williams pinball machine \\"F-14 Tomcat\\". F-15 Eagle An F-15J and F-15DJ of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force The McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle is one of the most recognized modern fighters; this has led to, or perhaps even been aided by, its common use in children's toys. Leader-1 of the Gobots turns into an F-15. The Transformers toy line and media have featured numerous characters who turn into F-15 Eagles, the most notable being the villain Starscream in 1984 and a group of similar Decepticons, the Seekers: Acid Storm, Thundercracker, Skywarp and Sunstorm. Although a completely unrelated design to the others, the Aerialbot Air Raid also disguises himself as an F-15. F-15s feature in the 1980 novel Eagles by M H Davis, a work which portrays pilots of the USAF.Bright, Charles. D. \\"Aviation Literature-A Changing Art\\". Journal Article in Aerospace Historian, Vol 31, No.1, p. 73. Air-Force Historical Foundation, Spring/March 1984. The F-15 is featured in the 1997 film Air Force One. The Eagle was also shown in advertisements for the 2000 film Thirteen Days. The ads were withdrawn when it came to the attention of New Line Cinema that the F-15, which first flew in 1972, was out of place for a film set in 1962. This was problematic for New Line, who had termed the film a \\"by-the-numbers recreation\\" and \\"close to perfect.\\" \\"Every ship, plane, truck and craft that moves in the film is absolutely authentic to the time period\\", said Steve Elzer, a spokesman for New Line. Mr. Elzer said the advertisement was created by an outside agency. F-15Js and F-15DJs appear prominently in the 2004 film ULTRAMAN. The film's protagonist, Shunichi Maki, is a prestigious pilot of the F-15, and encounters the enigmatic Ultraman 'The Next' while flying the aircraft.TokuNet Film Club: Ultraman The Next, Tokusatsu Network The F-15 has appeared in numerous video games, including the 1985 Microprose title F-15 Strike Eagle and its two sequels, F-15 Strike Eagle II (1989) and F-15 Strike Eagle III (1992). F-16 Fighting Falcon Thunderbirds display team A number of video games have featured the F-16: the Falcon series (1984-2005), F-16 Combat Pilot (1989), F-16 Multirole Fighter (1998), F-16 Aggressor (1999) and many others. The Transformers Aerialbot Skydive and Decepticon Dreadwind disguise themselves as F-16 Fighting Falcons. The Transformers character Needlenose disguises himself as an F-16XL. The Falcon was one of the stars of the 1986 film Iron Eagle. The US Air Force refused to assist with production of the film because it found the plot about a teenager flying an F-16 into a foreign country to be \\"a little off the wall\\". The 1986 action-adventure romantic comedy film The Jewel of the Nile featured a brutal dictator's personal F-16 as the key element in the protagonists (played by Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas) escaping from a fortified town. The aircraft was also featured in the HBO 1992 production Afterburn. A dramatization of true events, the F-16 was the subject of a protracted legal battle over the safety of the design. The F-16 was featured in the 2002 film The Sum of All Fears. Starting in 2007, the F-16 became one of two aircraft (along with the Cirrus SR22) to be featured in Google Earth Flight Simulator. F/A-18 Hornet The McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet appears in the 1994 film Clear and Present Danger which was directed by Phillip Noyce. The jet drops a laser-guided bomb on a car at a drug lord's villa, being laser designated by a special forces team. In the 1996 Michael Bay-directed film The Rock, F/A-18s attack the prison on Alcatraz Island in the final scenes. The F/A-18 Hornet was prominently featured in the 1996 film Independence Day and was filmed using F/A-18 squadrons belonging to the 3rd Marine Corps Aircraft Wing at El Toro and Miramar, in California. F/A-18s successfully attack the famous Japanese monster Godzilla („Ç¥„Ç∏„É© Gojira) with AGM-84 Harpoons in the 1998 remake film Godzilla. The updated two-seater F/A-18F Super Hornet variant was featured in the 2001 film Behind Enemy Lines, directed by John Moore, and starring Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman. The plot begins with a Super Hornet being shot down over Bosnia. The F/A-18 Hornet appeared briefly in the 2003 film Tears of the Sun in the final, climactic battle, helping to save the surviving SEAL team members. In the 2013 Disney animated film Planes, the characters Bravo and Echo are based on the F/A-18E Super Hornet. The F/A-18 Super Hornet is to be featured in the upcoming film, Top Gun: Maverick. F-20 Tigershark The Northrop F-20 Tigershark appears a number of times in Kaoru Shintani's manga/animated franchise Area 88, as a personal unit of main character Shin Kazama.Shintani, Kaoru. Area 88 Vol. 3. Shonen Sunday Wide Comics, 1990.Area 88. Act 2: Requirements of Wolves. Studio Pierrot, 1985‚Äì1986. Although the F-20 never entered service, in Barrett Tillman's 1991 novel Warriors, the Royal Saudi Air Force orders over a hundred of them. The RSAF assigns the fighter to select pilots who graduate from a localized version of Top Gun established by former USAF and USN pilots. The bigger plot of the novel involves the Saudi pilots joining a pan-Arab attack against Israel. F-22 Raptor The F-22 Raptor is heavily featured in the 1998 Stephen Coonts novel Fortunes of War. This novel sees Japan invade Russia with a fictional airplane they developed called the \\"Zero\\". While not wanting to directly come to the aid of the Russians, the US lends a squadron of F-22 Raptors to the Russian Air Force and hires American pilots to fly as sworn-in members of the Russian military. After appearing briefly in the 2003 Hulk film, the F-22 made its major Hollywood debut in the 2007 film Transformers and its 2009 sequel as the form taken by the Decepticon character Starscream in addition to numerous USAF fighters that engaged during the initial and climactic battles. The film crew was allowed to film actual Raptors in flight, unlike previous computer-generated appearances, because of the military's support of director Michael Bay. The Raptors were filmed at Edwards Air Force Base.Michael Bay's DVD audio commentary for Transformers, 2007, Paramount/DreamWorks. The real Raptor made its next big screen appearance in Iron Man, in which a Raptor call sign \\"Whiplash 1\\" lost its left wing during a mid-air collision with the Iron Man armor. Toys released for Starscream were replica F-22 Raptor models. These models were reused for other characters in the line, like Thundercracker, Skywarp and Ramjet, that also turned into F-22 Raptors. Although the live-action 2007 film Transformers made Starscream the best-known Transformer that turns into an F-22, there were other F-22 Transformers before it. For instance the 1997 Machine Wars versions of Megatron and Megaplex transformed into F-22s. In the 2013 film Olympus Has Fallen, computer animation was used to depict F-22 Raptors intercepting an armed AC-130 attacking Washington, D.C.; two F-22s are shot down before a third hits the AC-130 with a missile, causing it to crash. The plane is the subject of a flight-simulation video game, F-22 Interceptor, which was released by Electronic Arts and Ingram Entertainment for the Sega Mega Drive console in 1991. F-35 Lightning II Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II The first major film appearance of a representation of a Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II was 2006's Superman Returns. During this film, a pair of F-35A fighters escorted the modified Boeing 777 mothership for an experimental NASA spaceplane. This visualization was a combination of an actual cockpit and CGI for the aircraft in flight. The next major film appearance of an F-35 was in Live Free or Die Hard (released as Die Hard 4.0 outside North America) in 2007. The film used a combination of a full-scale model and CGI effects. The Transformers character of the Autobot Breakaway and its redeco the Decepticon Thrust from the Revenge of the Fallen toy both disguise themselves as F-35s. Breakaway appears as a playable character in the 2009 Revenge of the Fallen video game. F-35s are depicted in the 2012 film The Avengers. The film was originally intended to include real F-35s, but the United States Department of Defense objected to the depiction of F-22s and F-35s as under the control of S.H.I.E.L.D., a covert, \\"extra-governmental\\" organization whose loyalties are unclear, so CGI aircraft were substituted instead. Hal Jordan and Carol Ferris fly F-35s in a simulated dogfight against the UCAVs Carol's company is trying to sell to the US Department of Defense in the 2011 film Green Lantern. A squadron of F-35s engages General Zod's ship in the 2013 film Man of Steel. F-84 Thunderjet, Thunderstreak For the 1955 biographical film The McConnell Story about ace Joseph C. McConnell, eight Republic F-84s of the 614th Fighter-Bomber Squadron donned dark blue paint with red stars to portray MiG-15s doing mock battle for the cameras with F-86 Sabres of the 366th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, both units based at Alexandria AFB, Louisiana. Air Defense Command headquarters notified its pilots in January 1955 that the mock MiGs would be operating over portions of the southwestern US.Associated Press, \\"Don't Shoot at Those MiGs! - They're Disguised F84s Flying for Movie\\". The Sun-Telegram, San Bernardino, California, Sunday 9 January 1955, Volume VIII, Number 40, p. 1. F-86 Sabre The North American F-86 Sabre appears in the 1956 novel The Hunters by James Salter, and the 1958 film of the same name, set in Korea, features North American F-86 Sabres. F-86s feature in the 1957 junior fiction novel Sabre Pilot by Stephen W. Meader about a youngster named Kirk Owen who enlists in the USAF and serves as a fighter pilot in the Korean War.Aviation Bookshelf. Flying Magazine. Ziff-Davis Publishing Company. January, 1957. Vol 60, No 1. p. 81. F-86s were a feature in the 1958 film Jet Attack which was directed by Edward L. Cahn and starred John Agar and Audrey Totter. The film, also released as Jet Alert and Through Hell to Glory, was a drama set in the Korean War about a pair of pilots who parachute behind North Korean lines to rescue a captured scientist. The film, a low budget production, relied heavily on stock footage of F-86s for the aerial scenes.Beck, Simon D. The Aircraft-Spotter's Film and Television Companion. McFarland Publishers, 2016. p-129. F-86s appear in the 1959 novel MiG Alley by Robert Eunson which portrays a pilot Captain Homer 'Mac' McCullough who flies F-86s during the Korean War and is frustrated at being forbidden to engage enemy MiGs beyond the Yalu River.Merritt, Jonathan C. The Remembered War: The Korean War in American Culture, 1953‚Äì1995, pp. 46-47. University of Alabama, 2017. Desmond Bagley's 1965 novel High Citadel features F-86 Sabres, which make up the frontline equipment of the air force of the fictional South American country in which the book is set. There are four squadrons of Sabres; two are loyal to the current corrupt government; one is secretly loyal to a reformist politician who is returning from exile to take over the country; and the fourth is secretly loyal to Communist forces who are attempting to kill the politician. The latter part of the novel features a dogfight between a Sabre flown by one of the main characters‚Äîa CIA agent and former Sabre pilot who fought in the Korean War‚Äîand aircraft of the Communist squadron. F-86F Sabres of the JASDF regularly feature in the Showa era of kaiju films produced by Toho, with the aircraft appearing most prominently during a sequence in Godzilla where two Sabres attack the titular monster after he leaves the devastated city of Tokyo. In the 1981 dystopian film The Last Chase, retired pilot J.G. Williams (played by Burgess Meredith) and his F-86 Sabre play the antagonist in attempting to track down and destroy the protagonist Franklyn Hart (played by Lee Majors). After becoming sympathetic to Hart's cause, Williams sacrifices himself in a kamikaze-style attack against a laser installation to protect Hart. A Sabre plays an important role in the 1999 film comedy Blast from the Past which stars Brendan Fraser and Christopher Walken. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, a Sabre pilot is forced to eject over a residential area in the US and the aircraft just happens to crash onto the house of an eccentric father who is sheltering with his family in a large underground bomb shelter he has constructed. Believing the crash to be the impact of a nuclear bomb, the family remain underground for 35 years. F-101 Voodoo McDonnell F-101B Voodoo A pair of McDonnell F-101B Voodoos fly over the Russian submarine –°–ø—Ä—É—Ç at the end of the 1966 comedy The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming, directed by Norman Jewison. Although the film is set in New England, it was filmed on the West Coast and the fighters were from the 84th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, based at the now-closed Hamilton Air Force Base, California. F-104 Starfighter Gen. Charles \\"Chuck\\" Yeager's 10 December 1963 flying accident during a test flight in a modified rocket-boosted Lockheed NF-104A Starfighter was featured in The Right Stuff motion picture. The aircraft used for filming was a standard German Luftwaffe F-104G, flying with its wingtip fuel tanks removed; it otherwise lacked any of the NF-104A's modifications, most visibly the rocket engine pod at the base of the vertical stabilizer. The F-104 is featured heavily in the 1964 film The Starfighters, directed by Will Zens and starring future US Congressman Bob Dornan. The film later appeared on the Comedy Central series Mystery Science Theater 3000 as the subject of episode #612. An F-104 Starfighter flown by Captain John Christopher, USAF, intercepts the USS Enterprise after the ship is thrown back in time by an encounter with a previously unmapped \\"black star\\" in first season episode 1/19, Tomorrow Is Yesterday, as the starship is struggling to climb out of Earth's atmosphere over Omaha, Nebraska.Fontana, Dorothy C. Star Trek, Episode 1/19, \\"Tomorrow Is Yesterday.\\" First aired January 26, 1967. Footage of an F-104 featured in the opening scenes of the science-fiction motion picture The Bamboo Saucer (1968), playing the role of an experimental jet called the \\"X-109\\" whose pilot Fred Norwood (John Ericson) encounters a UFO while carrying out a test flight. An F-104 made regular appearances on the 1960s television sitcom I Dream of Jeannie. Leading man Major Anthony Nelson (Larry Hagman), a pilot in the US Air Force, was often to be seen landing and climbing out of the cockpit of an F-104A. That particular aircraft ‚Äì 56-817 ‚Äì later became part of the collection of the Pacific Aviation Museum on Ford Island, Oahu, Hawaii. Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters is a 1974 satirical concept album by Robert Calvert and others, telling an absurdly fictionalized tale of the F-104G's acquisition by and service with the German Air Force. The album included tracks with names such as \\"the Widowmaker\\" and \\"Catch a Falling Starfighter\\". F-117 Nighthawk Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk The Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk was the subject of the 1991 MicroProse game F-117A Nighthawk Stealth Fighter 2.0 and the 1993 Sega Mega Drive-exclusive F-117 Night Storm. Fairchild UC-61 Forwarder A former US Army Air Force Fairchild UC-61A Forwarder, painted in USAAF colours, makes a brief appearance to represent the Noorduyn UC-64A Norseman in which big band leader Glenn Miller disappeared in December 1944, in the 1954 Universal International Pictures film The Glenn Miller Story. The same aircraft was also featured in a 1964 episode of Michael Bentine's BBC TV comedy programme, It's a Square World, about a shoestring airline with a staff of two. Filming took a day at Elstree Aerodrome, Herts. In 1965, it appeared in an episode of the ITV programme, The Moonraker. Fairchild Hiller FH-227 When the Fairchild Hiller FH-227D operating as Uruguayan Air Force (Fuerza A√©rea Uruguaya) Flight 571 T-571 crashed in the Argentine Andes on 13 October 1972, it began a tale of amazing human survival for the 16 of the 45 on board who were rescued over two months later, after two passengers walked to civilization. The survivors' story was published in Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors, a critically acclaimed book by Piers Paul Read, in 1974. When the story was filmed in 1992 as Alive, directed by Frank Marshall, a similar FH-227 marked as the doomed aircraft was used for some shots, while Industrial Light and Magic depicted the crash using an eight-foot breakaway model, designed to shear at mid- fuselage. The nose and tail were heavily reinforced while a non-reinforced midsection was built up of plastic, foil, wires and metals so that when it broke it would have the layered metal look of a real airframe breaking up. A cable system was rigged to fly the model, which was on an aligned track, into the miniature mountain, hitting the \\"sweet spot\\" on the fuselage, a weakened area barely three inches long. Fairey Fox The Fairey Fox I, G-ACXO, race number 35, which participated in the 1934 London to Melbourne MacRobertson Trophy Air Race, was portrayed in the 1991 Australian mini-series The Great Air Race, also known as Half a World Away, by an unlikely Boeing Stearman. Fairey Swordfish Fairey Swordfish Two Fairey Swordfish starred in the 1960 film Sink the Bismarck!. Swordfish LS326 was marked as \\"5A\\" of 825 Naval Air Squadron, while NF389 was marked as LS423 / \\"5B\\". Focke-Wulf Fw 190 Focke- Wulf Fw 190s feature in the 1970 novel Betrayed Skies by Rudolf Braunburg which depicts a Luftwaffe fighter unit based in Poland in 1944.Bright, Charles. D. Aviation Literature-A Changing Art. Journal Article in Aerospace Historian, Vol 31, No.1. Air-Force Historical Foundation, Spring/March 1984. p. 72. Modified North American T-6 Texans portrayed Focke-Wulf Fw 190s in the 1977 film A Bridge Too Far. A new-build Fw 190 A-8/N participated in the 2007 Finnish war film Tali-Ihantala 1944, painted in the same markings as Oberst Erich Rudorffer's aircraft in 1944. Fw 190s feature in the French graphic novel The Grand Duke (2012) written by Yann, illustrated by Romain Hugault and depicting aerial combat between the Soviet air force and the German Luftwaffe over the Eastern Front in the latter stages of the Second World War. Focke- Wulf Triebfl√ºgel A Focke-Wulf Fw Triebfl√ºgel aircraft was featured in the 2011 American superhero film Captain America: The First Avenger, with the supervillain Red Skull making his first escape in this rocket-aircraft. The scene accurately depicts the rocket and ramjet start and initial climb out of the Triebfl√ºgel. Historically, the Triebfl√ºgel had only reached wind-tunnel testing when the Allied forces reached the production facilities, and no complete prototype was ever built. CGI vehicles designed for the film were based on real historical aircraft such as the Triebfl√ºgel. Fokker Eindecker A Fokker E.III Eindecker appeared in the BBC TV series Wings (1977‚Äì1978), a drama series about pilots of the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War.Beck, Simon.D. The Aircraft-Spotter's Film & Television Companion. McFarland Press, 2016. pp. 233‚Äì234. Fokker Dr.I Fokker Dr.I A scarlet-painted Fokker Dr.I triplane featured in the DC comic Enemy Ace and was the mount of the central character Baron Hans von Hammer, a German fighter pilot in the First World War. Debuting in 1965, the comic was written by Robert Kanigher and drawn by Joe Kubert and the character has been revived several times since by other writers & artists. A pair of Dr.Is are featured in the 1966 film epic The Blue Max, directed by John Guillermin and based on the 1964 novel of the same name by Jack D. Hunter. In the film, rival pilots Bruno Stachel (George Peppard) and von Klugermann (Jeremy Kemp) try to out-do one another in a test of nerves by flying their triplanes under a bridge. The scene was filmed at Formoy Viaduct in Ireland and stunt pilot Derek Piggott was obliged to fly a Dr.I under the bridge, through either the wide or narrow spans, a total of 32 times. A Dr.I appears in the 1971 film Von Richthofen and Brown (released in the US as The Red Baron) which was directed by Roger Corman and starred John Phillip Law as the famous German ace. The aircraft makes its first appearance at a cocktail party thrown by the aircraft's designer Anthony Fokker (played by Hurd Hatfield) who shows off his creation to guest of honour Manfred von Richthofen (Law) but the latter's eyes are drawn more to Fokker's attractive mistress.Riper, A. Bowdoin Van. A Biographical Encyclopedia of Scientists and Inventors in American Film and TV since 1930. Scarecrow Press, 2011. pp. 215-216. Fokker Dr.Is appear en masse in the 2006 aerial film Flyboys directed by Tony Bill and starring James Franco. Fokker Dr.Is also appear in the 2008 German film Der Rote Baron, a biopic about the famous First World War ace Manfred von Richthofen. Fokker D.VII The 1927 William Wellman film Wings featured a Fokker D.VII among many types depicting World War I aircraft. A Fokker D.VII is flown in a dogfight by Baron Heinrich von Frohleich versus Race Bannon in a SPAD S.XIII in episode 10 of Jonny Quest, \\"Shadow of the Condor\\", first aired 20 November 1964. Folland Gnat Folland Gnats portray the fictional carrier-based fighters in the 1991 comedy film Hot Shots!. Ford Trimotor Ford Trimotor John Wayne was depicted piloting a Ford Trimotor in several episodes of the 1932 serial film Hurricane Express. A Ford Trimotor appeared in Chapter 1 of Flash Gordon (Universal, 1936).\\"American Cinematographer,\\" Vol. 64, p. 57. American Society of Cinematographers (ASC Holding Corp). Retrieved; 28 February 2011. Director Howard Hawks' 1939 film Only Angels Have Wings features a Trimotor that catches fire after a freak accident with a condor, eventually performing an emergency landing on an airfield.

The aircraft featured in the film belonged to the Golden Wings Museum, Minnesota. GAF Nomad The Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) Nomad, an Australian-built twin-engine STOL (Short Take-Off and Landing) aircraft, was a regular feature on the successful Australian TV series The Flying Doctors which aired on the Nine Network 1986‚Äì1993. The GAF Nomad had a controversial history with a high accident rate. Of the 172 that were constructed, 32 were involved in major hull-loss accidents, resulting in 76 fatalities including GAF test pilot Stuart Pearce (father of actor Guy Pearce). Gee Bee Racer Two Gee Bee Model Z Super Sportster racing aircraft were featured in the 1991 Walt Disney film The Rocketeer. Kermit Weeks, founder of Fantasy of Flight, used a Gee Bee Model Z as his main character \\"Zee\\" in a 2008 series of children's books set in the interwar period. A Mexican Gee Bee Racer named \\"El Chupacabra\\" is one of the characters in the 2013 Disney animated film Planes. Gloster Gladiator Gloster Gladiators feature in the Second World War novel Signed with their Honour, written in 1942 by Australian author and war correspondent James Aldridge. The novel is set during the Axis invasion of Greece in 1940‚Äì41 and the central character is a British pilot named John Quayle who flies Gladiators with No. 80 Squadron RAF.

Hawker Hurricane A Hawker Hurricane Mk.I Along with the Supermarine Spitfire,Craig, Olga Battle of Britain: the spitfire, envy of the enemy June 28, 2010 The Telegraph Retrieved 14 March 2017 the Hawker Hurricane is very strongly linked to the Battle of Britain in summer 1940, where the Royal Air Force fought the German Luftwaffe over the skies of Britain for air superiority.Battle of Britain: without the hurricane the battle would have been lost June 28, 2010 The Telegraph As such it has been featured in many works of fiction related to the Battle of Britain. A number of Hawker Hurricanes, including the last one built, registered G-AMAU, \\"The Last of the Many\\", and five provided by the Portuguese Air Force, which flew the type until mid-1954, were utilized in the making of the Templar Productions Ltd. production provisionally titled \\"Hawks in the Sun\\", based on the book What Are Your Angels Now? by Wing Commander A. J. C. Pelham Groom, then released in March 1952 as Angels One Five. Hurricanes were featured in the 1956 British film Reach For the Sky starring Kenneth More and directed by Lewis Gilbert and based on the biography of Douglas Bader by Paul Brickhill. One Hurricane which featured in a static role in the film was the Mk. I, P2617, now preserved at the Royal Air Force Museum, Hendon. Another, which flew in the aerial scenes, was the Mk-IIc, LF363, now operated by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight based at Conningsby, UK. The Hawker Hurricane was featured in the 1969 film Battle of Britain. Three airworthy Hurricanes were located and used for the filming. A Hawker Hurricane was the fighter flown by the Second World War character Johnny Redburn in the long- running British comic strip Johnny Red which was published in Battle Picture Weekly 1977‚Äì1987. The storyline featured Redburn, having been discharged from the RAF and joining the Merchant Navy, commandeers a CAM ship's Hurricane during an attack on a convoy (after the official pilot is killed), and ends up stranded in Soviet Russia at the height of the war against the Germans in which he fights alongside Russian pilots. The comic was written by Tom Tully and illustrated by Joe Colquhoun, John Cooper and Carlos Pino. The character was revived in 2017 for the graphic novel mini-series Johnny Red: The Hurricane written by Garth Ennis and illustrated by Keith Burns. The Hawker Hurricane Mk. I features as the aircraft for the fictional RAF pilots depicted in the 1983 novel Piece of Cake by Derek Robinson. The 1988 miniseries based on the novel featured Supermarine Spitfires instead of Hurricanes. The 2006 novel Blue Man Falling by Frank Barnard also featured Hurricanes.

Internet Movie Planes Database Hispano Aviaci√≥n HA-1112 Hispano Aviaci√≥n Ha 1112 Buch√≥n Twenty- eight former Spanish Air Force Hispano Aviaci√≥n HA-1112s were used in the 1969 film Battle of Britain as \\"stand-ins\\" to depict Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters of the Luftwaffe, 27 single-seat M1Ls, and one two-seat M4L. Eighteen were flown, six could taxi, the rest used to dress sets. In the mid-1960s at the time aircraft began to be collected for the film to be made, the only genuine Bf 109s known to exist were unairworthy examples in museums such as the Imperial War Museum and the South African National Museum of Military History or in private hands; whereas the HA-1112 was just being retired from service with the Spanish Air Force and several airframes in flyable condition and some 50 dismantled Buch√≥ns were up for disposal bid. The four airframes acquired by the Confederate Air Force just prior to the start of filming \\"were the first Buch√≥ns in truly civilian ownership, early members of the fledgling warbird preservation movement.\\" Several Buch√≥ns were painted in RAF markings for the 1969 Italian \\"macaroni combat\\" war film Eagles Over London, also known as Battle Squadron and Battle Command (), directed by Enzo G. Castellari.Severin Films DVD Case, 2009. Retrieved: September 2009. \\"In 1979, much of the footage shot for Eagles Over London appeared in the dire George Peppard film Hell to Victory\\". Three of the Buch√≥ns were \\"hastily converted into P-51B Mustangs for the 1970 film Patton. This involved the attachment of a large Mustang-esque fibreglass air intake to the underside of the fuselage.\\" One CAF Buch√≥n flew as a Bf 109B in Condor Legion markings for the film The Hindenburg which began filming in August 1974. Buch√≥ns, again depicting Bf 109s, made an appearance on the 1980 ABC-network TV sci-fi series Galactica 1980, a short-lived spin- off from the original Battlestar Galactica series. The heroes travel back in time in their space Vipers to Earth during the Second World War and encounter the Luftwaffe. The footage of Buch√≥ns consisted of out-takes from the 1969 film Battle of Britain. One Buch√≥n, which had taxied in The Battle of Britain, flew in the 1988 LWT miniseries Piece of Cake, and was one of three flyable HA-1112s used to depict Bf 109s in the 1990 film Memphis Belle. The Piece of Cake Buch√≥n also appeared in the 1991 ITV television miniseries A Perfect Hero. A Buch√≥n now with the Planes of Fame Air Museum, Chino, California, is under repair after a landing accident at Lydd in Kent during filming of the 2001 film Pearl Harbor in 2000. A former training airframe that did not appear in the Battle of Britain but which was restored to Bf 109G-10 standard in the early 1990s, and operated by the Old Flying Machine Company, appeared in the 1995 telemovie Over Here starring Martin Clunes. A Buchon features in the 2017 Christopher Nolan film Dunkirk.  Hughes 500 / OH-6 / MH-6 / MD 500  In the 1983 film Blue Thunder, the antagonist Colonel Cochrane flew a heavily armed MD 500.

A pair of Hughes 500 helicopters appear in the 1978 film Capricorn One, near the climactic ending where they get entangled with a crop duster biplane. \\"240-Robert\\" is an American television series that ran on ABC from 1979 to 1981. The series was about a specialized unit of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD), that used four‚Äìwheel drive vehicles and a Hughes 500 helicopter. In the 1980s television series Magnum, P.I., Thomas Magnum's friend and fellow war veteran T.C. (for Theodore Calvin) flies a civilian Hughes 500D as a tourist charter Island Hoppers business. MD Helicopters MH-6 Little Bird helicopters provided air support for the downed Blackhawk's crash site in the 2001 film Black Hawk Down. In the film Fire Birds (1990), a drug runner's Scorpion helicopter (portrayed by an MD 500) ambushes a US Army AH-1 Cobra during the opening sequence. Hughes H-4 Hercules (Spruce Goose) The sole Hughes H-4 Hercules Also known as the Hercules HK-1 and \\"The Spruce Goose\\", this gigantic flying boat has made a number of appearances in fiction. The aircraft was central to the plot of the 1987 Hanna-Barbera animated film Yogi Bear and the Magical Flight of the Spruce Goose. In the 1988 biopic Tucker: The Man and His Dream, a pivotal meeting between automaker Preston Tucker and Howard Hughes takes place in front of the Hercules, within its hangar, where Hughes briefly tells Tucker that whether the Hercules flies is not the point, as well as how to circumvent the \\"establishment\\" and Senator Ferguson. In the 1991 adventure film The Rocketeer, hero Cliff Secord uses a large-scale model of the Hughes H-4 Hercules to escape some eager federal agents and Howard Hughes himself. After Secord glides the model to safety, Hughes expresses relief that the craft would actually fly. The production and sole test flight of the H-4 Hercules was depicted in the 2004 Martin Scorsese film The Aviator. A flying large-scale model was used for the film, and it is now displayed next to the original aircraft at the Evergreen Aviation Museum in McMinnville, Oregon. In the video game L.A. Noire (2011) the player is able to enter the aircraft. Additionally, exterior and interior views of the H-4 Hercules aircraft are featured in the opening introduction of the DLC mission, \\"Nicholson Electroplating\\". The aircraft was the center of a con job in TNT's drama series Leverage, Episode 5.01 \\"The Very Big Bird Job\\", which aired 15 July 2012, involved \\"selling\\" the Hercules. Part of the con involves convincing the mark that Hughes secretly gave the aircraft stealth capabilities. Hughes XF-11 The 7 July 1946 maiden flight of the Hughes XF-11 reconnaissance design which ended in a crash in Beverly Hills, California, severely injuring pilot Howard Hughes was depicted in a 1977 telemovie, The Amazing Howard Hughes (with a P-38 Lightning standing in for the XF-11), and again in the 2004 Martin Scorsese film, The Aviator, with the aircraft depicted by a mock- up with flight rendered through CGI.

He engages and shoots down a Bf-110 over the airfield and is later seen proudly inspecting the crashed aircraft although Baird is later reprimanded by his CO because during the battle, he carelessly left his radio stuck on 'transmit', preventing other pilots from communicating.MacKenzie, S.P. Battle of Britain on Screen:'The Few' in British Film and Television Drama. Edinburgh University Press, 2007. p. 51-52. The Messerschmitt used in the film was a captured Bf-110G-4 which was later scrapped after filming.Beck, Simon. D. The Aircraft-Spotter's Film and Television Companion. McFarland Publishers, 2016. p. 26. Messerschmitt Me 262 Messerschmitt Me 262 replica The American hard rock band Blue √ñyster Cult portrayed a Messerschmitt Me 262A on the cover of their third album Secret Treaties (1974). The album also contains a song, \\"Me 262\\", written from the point of view of a Luftwaffe pilot on a bomber interception mission in April 1945. In the 2000 alternate history novel Fox on the Rhine, by Douglas Niles and Michael Dobson, the Luftwaffe, under Adolf Galland's command, prioritizes the development of the Me 262. A number of squadrons are used to maul a heavy bomber raid in concert with other, propeller-driven, fighters, but worker sabotage of the engines affects their operational performance. In the second and last issue of the 2001 DC Vertigo miniseries Enemy Ace: War in Heaven, lead character Hans von Hammer leads a Luftwaffe flight against USAAF bomber formations with him piloting a scarlet red Me 262 that has no swastika tail insignia. Seeing the hopelessness of the war, he and his men later destroy the remaining 262s in their control before surrendering to a US Army unit.Ennis, Garth, and Kanigher, Robert. Enemy Ace: War in Heaven No. 2, DC/Vertigo Comics, May 2001. Me 262s feature in the 2012 Second World War film, Red Tails, directed by Anthony Hemingway. MiGs (generic) As was common in the 1950s, \\"MiGs\\" (presumably ‚àí15s, as the story is set in Korea) appear in the 1956 novel The Hunters by James Salter about USAF fighter pilots. As was common in the 1950s, the MiGs are portrayed by Republic F-84F Thunderstreaks in the 1958 film The Hunters More recently the part of MiGs has been played on screen by the F-5 Tiger II in 1986's Top Gun and the 1998 JAG episode 3.24. MiGs feature in the 2007 novel Ascent by UK author Jed Mercurio, a fictional work about a Soviet pilot Yefgeni Yeremin covertly flying MiGs during the Korean War. The book was later adapted into a graphic novel in 2011, illustrated by Wesley Robins. Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 The Indian (Hindi) films Silsila (1981), Border and Rang De Basanti (2006) depicted the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21. Mikoyan MiG-29 The MiG-29 is the alternate form of the figure Dreadwing as well as its redecos Overcast and Fearswoop from the 2007 and 2009 Transformers film toy lines. Mil Mi-8/-17 A Mil Mi-17 is used in the 2001 film Behind Enemy Lines as a NATO combat search and rescue (CSAR) helicopter that makes an attempt to rescue a downed airman. At the beginning of the 2002 film Die Another Day, a Mil Mi-8T is commandeered by James Bond, to infiltrate the antagonists' base. The aircraft also appeared in the 2006 film Blood Diamond, directed by Edward Zwick; it was used by the protagonist to reach a refugee camp. An Mil Mi-8 helicopter features in a major sequence in the 2019 Netflix film Triple Frontier directed by J C Chandor and starring Ben Affleck. Mi-8s appear in the 2019 HBO mini-series Chernobyl. Mi-8s were among the Soviet helicopters used to firefight and monitor the exploded reactor in 1986. In the series, helicopters are seen dropping sand-bags onto the fire and one helicopter is destroyed in a crash. The series portrays the incident as taking place shortly after the initial explosion at the reactor but in reality, the crash occurred some weeks later. Mil Mi-24 'Hind' A Mil Mi-24 helicopter A Mil Mi-24 helicopter appears in the 1997 film Air Force One. The aircraft is used to retrieve a Russian prisoner in exchange for the US President, who is being held captive. It is featured numerous times in the Metal Gear video game series, starting from the 1987 MSX original. Its appearance as a boss battle in the 1998 game Metal Gear Solid is probably the most famous instance. The helicopter is used extensively in the 2005 film The 9th Company, which fictionally depicts the Battle for Hill 3234 where Soviet Army paratroopers defend their post against Mujahideen fighters. It was especially employed to eliminate the Mujahideen's last wave of attack in the film's climactic battle. In the 2006 film Blood Diamond, a Mi-24 is employed to attack a rebel village. The 2007 film Charlie Wilson's War portrays the Mi-24 as used in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. Mujahideen use FIM-92 Stinger missiles supplied through US Congressman Charlie Wilson's efforts to shoot down Soviet Mi-24s. The helicopter is used by the antagonist to flee a Moscow rooftop in the 2013 film A Good Day to Die Hard. Mil Mi-26 In the 2013 Bruce Willis action film A Good Day to Die Hard, a Mil Mi-26T, leased from the Belarus Ministry for Emergency Situations and painted in washable military camouflage, was used in various scenes. Miles Falcon For the 1991 Australian mini-series The Great Air Race, about the 1934 London to Melbourne MacRobertson Trophy Air Race, also known as Half a World Away, Miles Falcon, VH-AAT, played Miles M.3 Falcon, G-ACTM, the prototype fitted with extra fuel tanks, race number 31. Mitsubishi A5M The Mitsubishi A5M Type 96 fighter, known to the Allies as the 'Claude', features prominently in the 2013 Studio Ghibli animated feature The Wind Rises directed by Hayao Miyazaki. The film is a semi-fictionalised lyrical portrayal of the famous Japanese aircraft designer Jiro Horikoshi and depicts him designing the A5M in the 1930s. Moller M400 Skycar The Moller M400 Skycar was featured in the 2010 telemovie The Jensen Project with LeVar Burton and Kellie Martin. It also appears in Clive Cussler's novel Atlantis Found, where it is flown by Dirk Pitt. Morane-Saulnier MS.230 The Morane-Saulnier MS.230 featured as the fictional 'new monoplane' in the 1966 World War I epic The Blue Max and was the aircraft in which the central character Bruno Stachel (George Peppard) meets his demise. Peppard purchased the aircraft and took it back to the US where it joined the collection of the San Diego Aerospace Museum. The plot, which has Stachel wringing-out a new design until it sheds its wings, is based on the experience with the late-war Fokker E.V, a parasol design, three of six of which crashed within a week of being delivered to Jasta 6 in August 1918. Grounded for investigation, the problem was traced to shoddy workmanship at the Mecklenburg factory where defective wood spars, water damage to glued parts, and pins carelessly splintering the members instead of securing them were discovered. Upon return to service two months later, the design was renamed the Fokker D.VIII in an effort to avoid the type's reputation as a killer. N3N Canary Naval Aircraft Factory N3N Canarys were shown in the 1941 Warner Bros. film Dive Bomber. Nakajima Ki-27 Nakajima Ki-27 Nakajima Ki-27s, lifted from Japanese film, appeared in the 1942 Republic film Flying Tigers.

North American AT-6 Texan The 1941 Paramount Pictures film I Wanted Wings featured flights of more than 50 North American T-6 Texans from Kelly Field, Texas. An SNJ-5 Texan, a naval variant of the AT-6, appeared in several television productions. It was modified to play the role of a Japanese Zero in the TV series Baa Baa Black Sheep (1977) and the mini-series Pearl (1979) and it played the roles of both a Zero and an SBD Dauntless in the 1987 mini-series War and Remembrance. North American BT-9 / BT-16 North American BT-9 and BT-16 basic trainers were filmed at Randolph Field, Texas, for the 1941 Paramount Pictures film I Wanted Wings, based on the 1937 novel of the same title by 1st Lt.

Not designed to land with fuel on board, the X-15 landed with a heavy load of propellants and broke its back, grounding it for three months. Footage of this accident was later incorporated in The Outer Limits episode \\"The Premonition\\", first aired 9 January 1965. The rocket craft is also the subject of the 1961 Essex Productions film X-15, a fictionalized account of the program, directed by Richard Donner in his first outing, and narrated by USAF Brigadier General (Reserve) James Stewart in an uncredited role. In the opening scene of the 2018 film First Man, Neil Armstrong, played by Ryan Gosling, is seen piloting a North American X-15 during a test flight. Northrop A-17 The Northrop A-17 makes an appearance at March Field at the conclusion of the 1941 Paramount Pictures film I Wanted Wings.  Northrop M2-F2  The Northrop M2-F2, a NASA research aircraft, was featured in the 1970s TV series The Six Million Dollar Man, starring Lee Majors. In the first episode the main character Steve Austin crashes the aircraft during a test flight and is severely injured. The footage used was from a real M2-F2 accident that took place on 10 May 1967 in the California desert. The clip of the crash was also used in the opening titles of each episode. The opening titles also used footage of the later Northrop HL-10 aircraft. Northrop YB-49 Paramount Pictures' 1953 film, The War of the Worlds incorporates color footage of a Northrop YB-49 test flight, originally used in one of Paramount's Popular Science theatrical shorts. In the George Pal film, the Flying Wing is used to drop an atomic bomb on the invading Martians.  Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye  In the film The Final Countdown (1980) a Grumman E-2 Hawkeye is used by the USS Nimitz as an airborne command and radar facility to track the Japanese Fleet heading to attack Pearl Harbour. O-1 Bird Dog The 1990 film Air America, which loosely recounted the exploits of the Central Intelligence Agency proprietary airline in Southeast Asia in the 1960s and early 1970s, featured Cessna O-1 Bird Dogs. O2C Helldiver United States Navy Curtiss O2C-2 Helldivers from Floyd Bennett Field were used in filming King Kong in 1933, but as Carl Denham observed, \\"Oh no, it wasn't the airplanes. It was beauty killed the beast.\\" Writer and director Merian C. Cooper, who was shot down in World War I in an Airco DH.4 and made a prisoner of war by the Germans, and who later flew with the Kosciuszko Squadron, portrayed the pilot who kills Kong, while director Ernest B. Schoedsack plays his gunner, in uncredited roles. In the 2005 remake of the film, director Peter Jackson plays one of the gunners while the pilot is portrayed by Rick Baker, who played Kong (in a rubber suit) in the 1976 remake. P-1 Hawk The 1927 William Wellman film Wings featured Curtiss P-1 Hawks among many types depicting World War I aircraft. The P-1s were used to portray German Albatros D.V fighters.Carlson, Mark Flying on Film: A Century of Aviation in the Movies 1912-2012 Bearmanor Media, 2012 p. 47. P-35 A civilianized Seversky P-35, the Seversky S2, which won the 1937 Bendix Trophy race, appeared as the \\"Drake Bullet\\" in the 1938 MGM film Test Pilot. P-38 Lightning A Guy Named Joe (1943) has Spencer Tracy returning as a guiding spirit looking after young Lockheed P-38 Lightning pilot Van Johnson. The 1944 short feature P-38 Reconnaissance Pilot, starring William Holden as Lt. \\"Packy\\" Cummings, dramatises the work of photo reconnaissance pilots in World War II. The 1965 film Von Ryan's Express begins with main protagonist, USAAF Colonel Joseph Ryan (Frank Sinatra), crash landing a P-38 Lightning in World War II Italy and being held as a prisoner of war. P-38s feature in the 1968 novel Order of Battle by Alfred Coppel, a work that portrays US P-38Fs in the fighter-bomber role over Europe in WW2.Caidin, Martin. Fork-tailed Devil: The P-38. Ballantine Books, 1990. p. 22. In the 1992 action film Aces: Iron Eagle III, the main character, Brig. Gen. Chappy Sinclair (Louis Gossett Jr.), pilots a P-38J as part a mission to field old Second World War airshow aircraft against a drug cartel in Peru. The aircraft, registration N38BP, came from the Planes of Fame museum. P-40 Curtiss P-40 Warhawks In the 1942 John Wayne film Flying Tigers, real Curtiss P-40 Warhawks are featured. The New York Times critic called the P-40s \\"the true stars\\" of the film. Republic Studios also built replicas for the film due to material shortages during the war. These can be identified by the fairings hiding the cylinder heads of the automotive V-8 engines installed in them, and the lack of elevators on the horizontal stabilizer. Future US President Ronald Reagan appears in the Recognition of the Japanese Zero Fighter (training film, 1942) as a young pilot learning to recognize the difference between a P-40 and a Japanese Zero. In this film Reagan mistakes a friend's P-40 for a Japanese Zero and tries to shoot it down. In the end, Reagan gets a chance to shoot down a real Zero. In the 1945 film God is My Co-Pilot, based on Robert Lee Scott, Jr's book about the Flying Tigers and the USAAF pilots who replaced them in the Republic of China and Burma, a mix of real P-40 and \\"film\\" P-40s are featured. A P-40E appeared in the 1967 World War II film Tobruk directed by Arthur Hiller and starring Rock Hudson and George Peppard. The P-40, a Mk 1a Kittyhawk s/n 18796, had formerly served in the RCAF, and later was used in the filming of Tora! Tora! Tora!. The aircraft is now owned by the War Eagles Air Museum in New Mexico. In the 1969 Twentieth Century Fox film Tora! Tora! Tora!, P-40s are shot up on the ground and shoot down attacking Japanese aircraft at the attack on Pearl Harbor. A P-40 featured in the 1973 made-for- TV film Death Race (also known as State of Division) which starred Lloyd Bridges and Doug McClure. The film featured a damaged Allied fighter, unable to take off but still able to taxi, being pursued across North Africa by a German tank. (Not to be confused with the 1975 sci-fi film Death Race 2000.) Former American Volunteer Group (AVG) pilots are involved in the helicopter- chase film Birds of Prey, a 1973 telemovie starring David Janssen. Opening credits run over footage from 1942's Flying Tigers, and a sharkmouthed Warhawk is prominent in opening scenes. In Steven Spielberg's 1979 film 1941, a P-40 Tomahawk was used as actor John Belushi's fighter, with scenes at the \\"Barstow Munitions Depot\\" filmed at Indian Dunes, California. In the 2001 film Pearl Harbor the characters played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett manage to get two P-40s into the air during the Japanese attack. In the 2004 film Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow the title character (played by Jude Law) pilots a heavily modified P-40. In the 2012 George Lucas film about the 332d Fighter Group, Red Tails, the story opens with the Tuskegee Airmen forced to fly obsolescent P-40 Warhawks and given missions far from the hot war zones. Czech composer Bohuslav Martin≈Ø paid a tribute to the aircraft with his scherzo for orchestra. It was premi√®red 19 December 1945 in Washington, D.C. Steve Earle's 1988 song \\"Johnny Come Lately\\" from the album Copperhead Road is about an American P-47 pilot in World War II; it contains a verse \\"My P-47 is a pretty good ship. She took a round comin' cross the channel last trip.\\" Modified T-6 Texans depicted P-47s in the 1977 film A Bridge Too Far. P-51 Mustang North American P-51 Mustang P-51 Mustangs featured in the 1948 Warner Bros. film Fighter Squadron which was directed by Raoul Walsh and starred Edmond O'Brien & Robert Stack. In this film, P-51Ds belonging to the California Air National Guard actually played the role of German Me-109 fighters to which the P-51 bore some resemblance from certain angles. For the production, P-51s were coated with acrylic Luftwaffe paint-schemes and the aerial sequences were filmed near Van Nuys in LA, California.Carlson, Mark. Flying on Film: A Century of Aviation in the Movies, 1912-2012. Bearmanor Media, 2012. pp. 134-136. P-51s (postwar designation F-51) appear in the 1957 Universal Studios film Battle Hymn. P-51s feature in the 1982 novel Goodbye, Mickey Mouse by Len Deighton which portrays US Mustang pilots operating out of England during WW2. The Steven Spielberg film Empire of the Sun (1987), based on the J.G. Ballard novel of the same name, featured models and restored Mustangs in an attack on a Japanese airstrip next to the internment camp where the story's protagonist is imprisoned. This was the most complex and elaborately staged sequence of the film, requiring over 10 days of filming and 60 hours of aerial footage of Mustangs. Film historians and reviewers regard the scene as a significant cinematic achievement: \\"Spielberg's most emotionally reverberant moment, and one of the rare movie scenes that can truly be called epiphanies.\\"Denby, David. \\"Empire Builders: Empire of the Sun is Spielberg's most psychologically complex work.\\" New York Magazine, 14 December 1987. Retrieved: 22 November 2014. The North American P-51 Mustang was featured in the 1995 HBO telemovie The Tuskegee Airmen. Two P-51Ds appear briefly at the end of Steven Spielberg's 1998 film Saving Private Ryan as \\"tank-busters\\" (although P-47 Thunderbolts would have been the more likely type in this role). \\"Big Beautiful Doll\\" of the Old Flying Machine Company, Cambridge, England, and \\"Old Crow\\" of the Scandinavian Historic Flight were used. The P-51 Mustang is prominently featured in the 2012 George Lucas film about the 332d Fighter Group, the Tuskegee Airmen, Red Tails. P-51Cs feature in the graphic novel mini-series Dreaming Eagles, published in 2016 by Aftershock comics, written by Garth Ennis and illustrated by Simon Coleby. The story portrayed the Tuskegee Airmen of the 99th Fighter Squadron as viewed through the memories of veteran pilot Reggie who describes his experiences to his son in the 1960s. Panavia Tornado The Transformers character Darkwing disguises itself as a Panavia Tornado. The Royal Air Force's ground attack aircraft, the Panavia Tornado, featured extensively in the television pilot Strike Force, produced in the 1990s for ITV in the UK. Strike Force did not enter series production. RAF Tornadoes featured in the 1998 BBC science fiction TV mini-series Invasion Earth written & co-produced by Jed Mercurio. In the series, Tornado jets are scrambled to intercept a UFO. PBY Catalina A PBY Catalina features in the 1947 film High Barbaree (also released under the title Enchanted Island) which was directed by Jack Conway, starred Van Johnson and was based on the 1945 novel of the same name by Charles Nordhoff & James Norman Hall. The film portrays a PBY crew during WW2 in the Pacific. During a depth-charge attack on a Japanese submarine, the PBY is damaged and crash-lands in enemy waters, leaving only two survivors, pilot Lt. Brooke (Johnson) and navigator Lt. Moore (Cameron Mitchell).Carlson, Mark. Flying on Film: A Century of Aviation in the Movies, 1912-2012. Bearmanor Media, 2012. pp. 228-229. A former Royal Danish Air Force PBY-6A Catalina appeared in the 1976 film Midway.

In the 2002 submarine film Below, the is directed to pick up three survivors of a torpedoed hospital ship by a Consolidated PBY-5A Catalina, marked as AH545, 'WQ-Z' of No. 209 Squadron. The PBY-5A was marked as the Catalina that had a decisive role in the sinking of the . PB4Y Privateer United States Navy PB4Y-2M Privateers of VP-23, based at Naval Air Station Miami, Florida, were filmed at the close of the 1948 hurricane season and the footage used in the 1949 20th Century-Fox film Slattery's Hurricane. Percival Proctor Percival Proctor The most prominent of the real aircraft in Nevil Shute's 1951 novel Round the Bend is a war- surplus Percival Proctor, which is used by the protagonist Constantine Shak Lin (also known as Connie Shaklin) to tour Asia to spread his teachings. At the end of the book the Proctor is the basis of a shrine to Shaklin and his new creed, laid up in a hangar in a state of uncompleted maintenance for pilgrims to view. In 1968, three Proctors were remodelled with inverted gull wings and other cosmetic alterations to represent Junkers Ju 87s in the film Battle of Britain but, in the event, radio-controlled models were used instead. Pfalz D.III A pair of flying replica Pfalz D.IIIs were constructed to appear in the 1966 epic First World War film The Blue Max, based on the novel of the same name by Jack D. Hunter. The aircraft subsequently appeared in Darling Lili (1970) and Von Richthofen & Brown (1971). Pfalz D.XII A Pfalz D.XII which is now in the National Air and Space Museum, Washington, D.C., was flown in The Dawn Patrol (1930), Hell's Angels (1930), and Men with Wings (1938).

Pilatus Porter/Fairchild AU-23 The STOL-capable Pilatus PC-6 Porter was depicted in the 1990 film Air America, loosely recounting the exploits of the Central Intelligence Agency proprietary airline in Southeast Asia in the 1960s and early 1970s. The PC-6s in this film were actually Fairchild AU-23A Peacemakers, the US-built version of the aircraft. Five examples were used in the production, four of them belonging to the Royal Thai Air-Force and a fifth which was a hybrid re-constructed from a number of derelict Porters. The latter was used for the filming of a landing on a hill-top airstrip because the Thai Air-Force refused to risk one of their own Porters in the filming of that scene.Beck, Simon D. The Aircraft-Spotter's Film & Television Companion. McFarland Publishers, 2016. p11-12. A Pilatus PC-6 Porter was used for the first jump and training scenes in the 1994 film Drop Zone. Piper Cherokee The character Pussy Galore in the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger is the leader of \\"Pussy Galore's Flying Circus\\", a group of women who fly Piper Cherokees, trained acrobats turned cat burglars, in the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming.

RAH-66 Comanche The cancelled Boeing-Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche appeared in director Ang Lee's Hulk film in 2003. The 1993 shooter game Jungle Strike has the main character flying the RAH-66 Comanche to complete various missions.Adrian Pitt & Mat Yeo, \\"Reviewed! Jungle Strike\\" Sega Force July 93 (issue 19), pp. 58‚Äì59.  Republic RC-3 Seabee  The Republic RC-3 Seabee is an amphibious aircraft which James Bond uses in the 1974 film The Man With the Golden Gun, to get to the island lair of villain Francisco Scaramanga. Bond lands the plane at the island, but it is later destroyed by Scaramanga's solar-powered laser gun.  RF-8 Crusader  The RF-8 is a reconnaissance version of the Vought F-8 Crusader carrier-based air superiority aircraft. In the 1980 film The Final Countdown an RF-8 is used by the USS Nimitz to overfly the Pearl Harbor naval base. The photos taken during that mission of the US Navy Fleet prior to the 1941 Japanese attack, convince the Nimitz's commanders that somehow they have gone back in time from the 1980s to the 1940s. Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 A Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 A replica Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c was used in the production of the BBC Great War drama series Wings which aired in 1977‚Äì1978. The replica was originally commissioned in 1969 by Universal Studios for a proposed big-budget film Biggles Sweeps the Skies but the project was cancelled after the aircraft was built. The replica was constructed by engineer and pilot Charles Boddington who was later killed during the making of the 1971 film Von Richthofen & Brown. His son Matthew recently rebuilt the aircraft (after it was badly damaged in an accidental crash in the US) and it flew again at Sywell aerodrome, UK, in 2011. Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 The 1927 William Wellman film Wings featured a Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a among many types depicting World War I aircraft. Ryan NYP The 1938 Paramount film Men with Wings, starring Ray Milland, featured a reproduction of the Spirit of St. Louis fashioned from a Ryan B-1 Brougham.

Saab JAS 39 Gripen In the 2017 film Transformers: The Last Knight the Decepticon Nitro Zeus transforms into a Saab JAS 39 Gripen. In the 2019 Anime series Girly Air Force, Gripen is one of the main fighter aircraft featured in the series along with Kei Narutani, the main protagonist of the series. SBD Dauntless A Douglas SBD Dauntless was used in the production of the 1976 motion picture Midway. An SBD-5, which had formerly served in the RNZAF and which was (in 1976) non-airworthy and wingless, was used in the filming of the cockpit close-ups for actors such as Charlton Heston. Later in 1987, the same aircraft (BuNo 28536), now in airworthy condition, was used in the production of the epic 1988‚Äì1989 TV mini-series War & Remembrance. The aircraft appeared in the sequence depicting the Battle of Midway and during filming, was flown off the the first time an SBD had taken off from a carrier in 42 years. Douglas SBDs are a major feature in the 2019 film Midway directed by Roland Emmerich. The aircraft were recreated digitally and at least one full-scale static replica was built. SB2C Helldiver / A-25 Shrike The loss of a US Navy Curtiss SB2C-1 Helldiver, BuNo 00154, of VB-5, during launch near Trinidad on 28 May 1943 during the shakedown cruise of the was incorporated by 20th Century Fox into the 1944 film Wing and a Prayer: The Story of Carrier X. Two USAAF Curtiss RA-25A Shrikes collided during a flypast for an air show near Spokane, Washington, on 23 July 1944, the accident filmed by a Paramount Pictures newsreel crew.

SB2U Vindicator Vought SB2U Vindicators were featured in the 1941 Warner Bros. film Dive Bomber. Short Sunderland The Short Sunderland flying boat patrol bomber takes a key part in Ivan Southall's autobiographical 1974 novel Fly West, where the writer tells his life as a RAF Coastal Command Sunderland pilot during World War II. Many details about the aircraft looks, performance and procedures are given throughout the book, and as almost the entirety of the book is set inside Sunderlands, the warplane practically becomes a character. Other aircraft, both from Allied and German origin, are also featured and mentioned. A Short Sunderland was the setting for much of the 1980 novel The Flying Porcupine by Richard Haligon. The novel takes its title from a nickname reputedly given to the Sunderland by German pilots thanks to its defensive armament of as many as 16 machine guns. Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King CIA officer Jack Ryan (played by Alec Baldwin) is flown from an aircraft carrier to the submarine in a Sikorsky SH-3H Sea King in the 1990 film Hunt for Red October, based on the Tom Clancy's novel of the same title. At the end of the successful rescue mission for Apollo 13, two SH-3 Sea Kings, historically painted as Helos 66 and 406, retrieve the astronauts from their spacecraft after splashdown in the 1995 Ron Howard film. Sikorsky H-5 / R-5 / HO2S / HO3S / S-51 Sikorsky H-5 The 1954 film The Bridges at Toko-Ri, based on the 1953 James A.

A Westland Widgeon, a UK-built version of the Sikorsky S-51, appears in the 1971 British film When Eight Bells Toll, starring Anthony Hopkins, directed by √âtienne P√©rier and based on the Alistair MacLean novel of the same name. Aerial scenes were filmed over the Scottish islands of Staffa and Mull. Sikorsky H-19 / Westland Whirlwind The 1955 Warner Bros. film The McConnell Story, about Capt. Joseph C. McConnell, Jr., the top American ace of the Korean War, includes footage of a Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaw rescuing a downed B-29 crew in that conflict, while under heavy fire. A Chickasaw was furnished by the 48th Air Rescue Squadron, Eglin AFB, Florida, for seven days of filming at Alexandria AFB, Louisiana, in February 1955. The character of \\"Harold the Helicopter\\" from the British children's program Thomas & Friends is based on the Sikorsky S-55, built in the UK as the Westland Whirlwind. The Sikorsky S-55 appeared in Irwin Allen's 1960 film, The Lost World. The book, Retreat Hell, by W. E. B. Griffin, takes place in Korea during the Korean War. It centers on the use of a Sikorsky H-19A helicopter during the fall of 1950. Much of the action is driven forward by the abilities of the helicopter. Sikorsky S-58 A Sikorsky S-58 appears as the \\"Screaming Mimi\\" in the 1980s television series Riptide. This S-58 is still in service as a heavy lift helicopter. Sikorsky H-53 series A HH-53B Sea Stallion appears in the 1974 film Airport 1975, where a pilot is lowered on a tether from the helicopter to a damaged Boeing 747 in flight. The HH-53C variant was used in the combined combat search and rescue and VIP delivery sequences in the 1982 Malpaso Productions spy and action film Firefox, produced, directed by, and starring Clint Eastwood, based on the 1977 novel of the same name by Craig Thomas. The Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion appears in the 2002 film The Sum of All Fears, based on the Tom Clancy novel of the same title. A CH-53E Super Stallion is featured in the 1997 film The Jackal, where it flies over Washington D.C. and hovers between buildings during a fast rope sequence. The Sikorsky MH-53J is featured in the 2007 Transformers film as the alternate mode of Blackout. Production designer Jeff Mann stated \\"the Pave Low looks butch... the size made it the logical choice.\\" Toys for Blackout were MH-53 replicas, which were reused for the characters of Evac, Spinister and Whirl. The heavier CH-53E Super Stallion is the alternate form for the Decepticon Grindor in the 2009 film Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The Sikorsky MH-53 appears in the 2009 video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, referred to simply as the \\"Pave Low\\". Sikorsky CH-54 Tarhe/Sikorsky S-64 In the 1996 film Independence Day a Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane is fitted with an array of flashing lights to communicate with an alien spaceship. A Skycrane also appears in the 2001 film Swordfish, near the climactic ending in which it has a bus full of hostages slung loaded underneath, and is flying through downtown Los Angeles. Sikorsky H-60 series In the 1994 film Clear and Present Danger a pair of MH-60K Black Hawks are used to insert a special ops team, into a Colombian jungle. Black Hawks were also featured in the 1997 film Air Force One, having been rented from the US military. The Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk was the title aircraft in the 2001 film Black Hawk Down. For this film too the film makers rented the aircraft, paying the US Department of Defense about $3 million to ship eight helicopters and about 100 crew members to the film location in Morocco. In the 2003 film Tears of the Sun three SH-60 Seahawk helicopters bring evacuated US embassy staff and their SEAL team rescuers from Nigeria to the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman. Two SH-60 Seahawk helicopters are used to retrieve a SEAL team and refugees in Nigeria. Sikorsky S-29-A Igor Sikorsky's Sikorsky S-29-A, previously owned by Roscoe Turner, doubled for a Gotha bomber in Howard Hughes' 1930 aerial epic Hell's Angels. It was destroyed during filming. At the time of the aircraft's demise it had flown 500,000 miles.Jackson, Joe, \\"Atlantic Fever: Lindbergh, His Competitors, and the Race to Cross the Atlantic\\", Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York, 2012, Library of Congress card number 2011046068, , Note 38 on Chapter Two - \\"The Sure Thing\\", p. 422. Sikorsky S-38 Replicas of the Sikorsky S-38 were used in the filming of the 2004 Martin Scorsese biopic of Howard Hughes, The Aviator.Lerner, Preston, \\"Howard Hughes' Top Ten,\\", November 2004, Air & Space magazine, retrieved 2 February 2017 (NOTE: This link is to the first web page of a four-page article) Sikorsky VS-44 When MGM produced the 1959 film The Gallant Hours, based on the life of US Navy Admiral William \\"Bull\\" Halsey, the studio rented a Sikorsky VS-44A, N41881, named \\"Mother Goose\\", from Catalina Air Lines, Inc., and painted it in wartime camouflage to depict a secret flight that Halsey had made to the South Pacific in a Consolidated PB2Y-1 Coronado. Although the studio had promised to repaint the flying boat after the production, this did not happen, and the airline had to restore the civilian livery itself. Sopwith Camel Sopwith Camel replica The First World War Sopwith Camel fighter features prominently in the Biggles stories of W. E. Johns such as the collections: The Camels Are Coming (1932), and Biggles of the Camel Squadron (1934). The 1934 novel Winged Victory by Victor M. Yeates features the Sopwith Camel in action during the Great War. Sopwith Camels feature in the 2013 novel A Splendid Little War by Derek Robinson which depicts a fictional RAF unit ‚Äì Merlin Squadron ‚Äì flying Camels in support of the White forces during the Russian Civil War in 1919. Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter A 1/6 scale radio-controlled model of a Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter was constructed by Proctor Enterprises to appear in the ABC television series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles episode \\"Attack of the Hawkmen\\" (1995) produced by George Lucas. A replica Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter featured in the 2006 film Flyboys, a drama about the Lafayette Escadrille. The replica, built in 1992, was purchased from a private museum in Alabama. Sopwith Pup The fictional RFC squadron in Derek Robinson's 1999 First World War novel Hornet's Sting flies the Sopwith Pup. Space Shuttle orbiter The Transformers Combaticon named Blast Off, the Autobot Sky Lynx, and triple-changer Astrotrain all disguise themselves as Space Shuttle orbiters. In Payne Harrison's 1990 novel Storming Intrepid, the shuttle Intrepid ‚Äì one of four new shuttles built by the US government ‚Äì is hijacked by its mission commander, who is a Russian agent. The plot revolves around American efforts to prevent the agent from landing the shuttle in the USSR with its advanced SDI system intact. In the 2000 film Space Cowboys, four retired astronauts launch into space aboard the shuttle Daedalus to repair a crippled Russian satellite. In Jon Amiel's 2003 film The Core space shuttle Endeavour is sent off course by a disruption in the Earth's magnetic field, forcing it to land in the concrete-lined channel of the Los Angeles River. In the 2013 film Gravity, space shuttle Explorer is destroyed by an out of control satellite in the early portion of the film. SPAD The 1927 William Wellman film Wings featured a SPAD S.VII among many types depicting World War I aircraft. Race Bannon, flying a SPAD S.XIII, fights a dogfight with a Fokker D.VII, flown by Baron Heinrich von Frohleich in Episode 10 of Jonny Quest, \\"Shadow of the Condor\\", first aired 20 November 1964. Stampe SV.4 The 1976 film Aces High uses several modified Stampe SV.4 aircraft made to look like Royal Flying Corps Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 aircraft. These were prepared by Bianchi Aviation Film Services and flown by well-known pilots including Neil Williams. Standard J A Standard J-1 appeared in the 1923 film The Eleventh Hour which starred Alan Hale Sr.. During the film, a J-1 attacks a submarine on the surface but the aircraft is hit by return fire from the vessel and it explodes in mid-air. To film the scene, stunt pilot Dick Kerwood was required to fly over the submarine (loaned by the US Navy) in San Diego Bay and, at about 3,000 feet, parachute out of his plane after setting the timer to explosives which would detonate ten seconds later. However the timer proved faulty and the aircraft exploded before Kerwood could bale out. He was seriously concussed but otherwise escaped injury and he managed to open his chute in time.Carlson, Mark. Flying on Film: A Century of Aviation in the Movies 1912-2012 Bearmanor Media, 2012 p35. Stearman C3 A Stearman C3R featured in the 1958 film No Place to Land directed by Albert C. Gannaway and starring John Ireland. The film was a drama about crop-duster pilots in post-war rural California competing with each other for work.Beck, Simon D. The Aircraft-Spotter's Film and Television Companion. McFarland Publishers, 2016. p. 149. Stinson Model A A static replica of a Stinson Model A was featured in the 1988 Australian TV-film The Riddle of the Stinson which starred Jack Thompson. The film was a dramatisation of the true-life crash of an Australian Airlines Stinson in Queensland in 1937 which claimed the lives of 5 men and the subsequent rescue of two survivors ten days later by local Bernard O'Reilly who treked into the rainforest and found the crash-site. Supermarine Attacker The Supermarine Attacker appears in two flying sequences in the 1952 film The Sound Barrier (released in the US as Breaking the Sound Barrier), directed by David Lean and starring Nigel Patrick and Ralph Richardson. The aerial footage was filmed by Jack Hildyard. Supermarine Spitfire Supermarine Spitfire Mk.VB Along with the Hawker Hurricane, the Supermarine Spitfire fighter is very strongly linked to the Battle of Britain in summer 1940, where the Royal Air Force fought the German Luftwaffe over the skies of Britain for air superiority. As such it has been featured in many works of fiction related to the Battle of Britain. The 1942 film The First of the Few is a dramatization of the life of R. J. Mitchell, mostly concerning his work on the Supermarine Spitfire. The 1951 film Malta Story is about Spitfires and their pilots defending Malta in 1942. A clipped-wing Spitfire features in the opening sequence of David Lean's 1952 film The Sound Barrier (released in the US as Breaking the Sound Barrier). In the scene, which takes place over Dover in 1945, the Spitfire's pilot Philip Peel (John Justin) dives his aircraft at such a high speed, that he encounters a 'barrier' of dense air, causing such severe buffeting that he almost loses control of his machine. British writer Elleston Trevor's best-selling 1955 novel Squadron Airborne depicted a fictional RAF squadron flying Spitfires at the height of the Battle of Britain in 1940. A Spitfire IXc was one of at least two used in the production of the 1962 World War II epic film The Longest Day. The same aircraft also appeared in Von Ryan's Express (1965), Night of the Generals (1967), and Battle of Britain (1969). In John Frankenheimer's 1964 film, The Train, a Royal Air Force Spitfire is shown attempting to shoot up a locomotive traveling light on the French railway system, which gains safety in a tunnel. The Spitfire was a central part of the 1969 Guy Hamilton-directed film Battle of Britain, a fictionalized account of the real Battle of Britain that one critic called \\"the definitive depiction of war in the air\\". The film led to an increase in the popularity of the aircraft among collectors of warbirds. According to one property dealer the appearance \\"did for Spitfires what the James Bond films did for the Aston Martin.\\" Producers secured 35 Spitfires for use in the film. A Spitfire Mk. IXc (MH434/G-ASJV) depicted an aerial reconnaissance variant in the 1977 film A Bridge Too Far. A Spitfire was the main character's aircraft in Iron Maiden's song \\"Aces High\\". A Spitfire (MH434/G-ASJV again) appears in a low-flying sequence in John Boorman's 1987 film Hope and Glory. The Spitfire was also the main aircraft used in the 1988 miniseries Piece of Cake. The series was based on a novel by the same name. Pilots in the novel flew the Hawker Hurricane, but the lack of airworthy Hurricanes forced the producers to change aircraft types, using five privately owned airworthy Spitfires and a collection of static and taxiing replicas. Real-life World War II RAF ace Douglas Bader was portrayed as a night-flying Spitfire pilot during The Blitz in the animated Disney series Gargoyles second-season episode \\"M.I.A\\", and was saved from losing his life in air combat by Goliath and by Griff, a British gargoyle of the London Clan. The 2001 Czech film Dark Blue World, a World War II drama about Czech pilots who flew with the Royal Air Force directed by Jan Svƒõr√°k, featured Spitfires. The vintage Spitfires cost the film-makers US$7,500 an hour to use. The aerial sequences were a combination of live aerial footage, CGI and out-takes from the 1969 film The Battle of Britain. The film Pearl Harbor (2001), directed by Michael Bay, included a sequence which featured Spitfires. A Spitfire Mk Vb featured in at least three episodes of the British ITV television series Foyle's War (2002‚Äì2015). The central character Detective Foyle has a son Andrew, who is a pilot in the Royal Air Force during WW2. One episode to feature the Spitfire was Among the Few in season 2 where one of Andrew's fellow pilots is revealed to be a secret homosexual and guilty of manslaughter.Mackenzie, S.P. Battle of Britain on Screen: The 'Few' in British Film and Television Drama. Edinburgh University Press, 2007. pp. 147, 150. Spitfires starred in the 2006 seven-minute short film/commercial Pilots produced by the Swiss-German watch manufacturer IWC Schaffhausen to promote its Big Pilot's Watch Collection. John Malkovich featured in the film. The more recent novel Band of Eagles (2007) by Frank Barnard featured Spitfires engaged in the defence of Malta in 1941. Two vintage Spitfires were used in the filming of the 2010 BBC television docu-drama First Light, based on the memoir of the same name by Second World War RAF pilot Geoffrey Wellum. A Spitfire features in the 2011 animated short film Paths of Hate by Polish film-maker Damian Nenow, a war and supernatural horror film in which two fighter pilots fight a vicious duel to the death. The film was short-listed for best short film at the 2012 Academy Awards. Spitfires play a significant role in the 2017 film Dunkirk, a Second World War drama directed by Christopher Nolan. Supermarine Swift The second prototype Supermarine Swift appeared as the \\"Prometheus\\" in the 1952 film The Sound Barrier. TBD Devastator Douglas TBD Devastators were featured in the 1941 Warner Bros. film Dive Bomber. Douglas TBDs feature in the 2019 film Midway directed by Roland Emmerich. To portray the aircraft, the producers recreated TBDs digitally and also constructed a full-scale static replica which, after filming was completed, was donated to the USS Midway Museum in San Diego. In the film, TBDs are in-correctly depicted as carrying a pair of 500-pound bombs on wing racks in addition to a torpedo at the same time whereas in reality, the under-powered TBDs struggled enough with the weight of just a torpedo. Thomas-Morse MB-3 The 1927 William Wellman film Wings featured Thomas- Morse MB-3As among many types depicting World War I aircraft. Thomas-Morse S-4 Thomas-Morse S-4 Scouts were employed in the filming of the 1933 Paramount film The Eagle and the Hawk directed by Stuart Walker and starring Fredric March and Cary Grant. The film features two American-born pilots, Young and Crocker, serving in a Royal Flying Corps reconnaissance squadron during the Great War and portrays the initial hostility between the two which is gradually replaced by mutual respect before one succumbs to combat fatigue.Carlson, Mark. Flying on Film: A Century of Aviation in the Movies 1912-2012 Bearmanor Media, 2012 p63-65. Thurston Teal The 1973 film The Wicker Man featured a Thurston Teal. Tupolev Tu-154 A Tupolev Tu-154B was in the centre of the plot of the 1979 Soviet film Air Crew. The film is a recognized classic in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. UFM Easy Riser The UFM Easy Riser was one of two ultralight aircraft that lead the Canada geese south in the 1996 film Fly Away Home. The film was a highly fictionalized account based on Bill Lishman's autobiography and work with Operation Migration, but both Lishman's real-life migratory experiments teaching birds to migrate and the film used the Easy Riser, due to its low cruising speed, which allowed the birds to pace the aircraft in flight. USS Macon In the 1934 Warner Bros. film Here Comes the Navy, directed by Lloyd Bacon, the first of nine films in which James Cagney and Pat O'Brien appeared together, the US Navy dirigible is shown late in the production after Cagney's character transfers to a lighter-than-air unit after a falling out with his shipmates aboard the . Vickers FB5 Gunbus Vickers FB5 A replica Vickers FB5 was constructed to appear in the 1986 film Sky Bandits (also released under the title Gunbus) which was about a pair of cowboys who flee the US to escape prison for a bank robbery and end up serving in the RFC during the Great War. The replica, built as a taxiing prop for the film, is currently housed at Sywell Aerodrome in the UK. Another Vickers FB5 replica was built to appear in the 1976 film Shout at the Devil which starred Lee Marvin and Roger Moore and was based on the Wilbur Smith novel of the same name. Vickers Wellington The Vickers Wellington features in the 1941 film Target for Tonight. Nevil Shute's romance Pastoral is a war time story of a pilot and his crew of a Wellington bomber based at a fictional RAF station called \\"Hartley Magna\\". A Vickers Wellington features in the 1961 comedy film Very Important Person (released in the US as A Coming Out Party). In the film, the central character, a military scientist named Sir Ernest Pease (James Robertson Justice) is taken over Germany during WW2 to test a top-secret apparatus. However the Wellington is hit by anti-aircraft fire and Pease is sucked out through a hole in the fuselage, parachuting into enemy territory and ending up in a POW camp.Ashley, Mark. Flying Film Stars: The Directory of British Aircraft in World War Two Films. Air Research Publications, UK 2014. p. 174. The 1968 Czechoslovak film Nebe≈°t√≠ jezdci (Sky Riders) about Czechoslovak airmen in RAF Bomber Command featured a Vickers Wellington. It was depicted by a taxiing replica based on an extensively modified Lisunov Li-2. Flight sequences were shot with large scale replicas and the film also incorporated wartime stock footage, including scenes from Target for Tonight. A haunted Vickers Wellington is the subject of Robert Westall's macabre, and critically appreciated, 1982 short story Blackham's Wimpy. Irish graphic novelist Garth Ennis chose the Wellington to be the aircraft flown by the Australian crew of RAF Bomber Command in his 2010 graphic novel Happy Valley, set in 1942 during the early phase of the night bombing offensive and one of his Battlefields series. Vultee V-1 A Vultee V-1 makes a brief appearance as wealthy banker Alexander Andrews' (Walter Connolly) private plane in the 1934 screwball comedy It Happened One Night.https://www.impdb.org/index.php?title=It_Happened_One_Night V-22 Osprey In the 2005 TV miniseries The Triangle, V-22 Ospreys armed with torpedoes confront and sink the protagonists' boat on the ocean as they approach the exclusion zone around the temporal phenomenon. Two Bell-Boeing CV-22 Ospreys (of only three in the USAF inventory at the time) were filmed in flight at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, in May 2006 for the 2007 Transformers film. This would inspire a host of Transformers toys and characters based on the Osprey including the Decepticons Incinerator and Ruination as well as the Autobots Springer and Blades. The 2011 film Transformers: Dark of the Moon features the CV-22 Osprey. Waco 10 At least seven Waco 10 biplanes were employed in the production of the 1928 film Lilac Time, a romantic drama about a British pilot in the Royal Flying Corps in WW1. The film was directed by George Fitzmaurice and starred Gary Cooper (being a silent film, Cooper did not have to fake a British accent). Wacos played the role of generic RFC planes and three were deliberately crashed during filming of the aerial combat scenes. Dick Grace, only just recovered from injuries he sustained while working on the film Wings the previous year, was the stunt pilot for two of the crash-landing scenes.Carlson, Mark. Flying on Film: A Century of Aviation in the Movies 1912-2012 Bearmanor Media, 2012 pp. 53-54. Wallis Autogyro Developed in the 1960s by former RAF Wing Commander Ken Wallis, the Wallis WA-116 Agile was an improved, more stable autogyro design. Following a prototype, five WA-116s were built by Beagle Aircraft at Shoreham, three of which were for evaluation by the British Army Air Corps. In 1966, one of the Beagle-built WA-116s, registered G-ARZB, was modified for use in the 1967 James Bond film You Only Live Twice, dubbed \\"Little Nellie\\" and flown by Wallis, doubling for Sean Connery's 007.  Westland Lysander  In the 2016 film Allied, the main character, Canadian intelligence officer Max Vatan undertook a covert mission in a Westland Lysander to find a French Resistance fighter behind enemy lines. Wright Flyer The Wright brothers' Wright Flyer is featured in the Season Seven episode of The Simpsons \\"Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming\\". In the episode, first aired 26 November 1995, Sideshow Bob steals the Flyer, which is on loan from the Smithsonian Institution, while it is on display at an airshow. He then flies it into a shack from which Krusty the Clown is making a television broadcast to put Krusty off the air; however, instead of demolishing the building the frail Flyer merely bounces off the wall undamaged. Wright Model B Several replicas of the Wright Model B were constructed for the filming of the 1978 telemovie The Winds of Kitty Hawk. One of the replicas is now owned and preserved by Wright B Flyers Inc. based in Dayton, Ohio. XB-51 A Martin XB-51 in Toward the Unknown The Martin XB-51 depicted the fictional Gilbert XF-120 in the 1956 film Toward the Unknown, starring William Holden as a test pilot. On 25 March 1956, the first XB-51 prototype, 46-0685, crashed in sand dunes near Biggs Air Force Base, El Paso, Texas, killing both crew, while staging to Eglin AFB, Florida, for filming of scenes for the motion picture. XB-70 Valkyrie The Transformers character of Silverbolt was upgraded to a North American XB-70 Valkyrie for the Universe line as an Ultra class toy. Zeppelin A Zeppelin appears in the 1929 Fox Corporation film The Sky Hawk which was directed by John G. Blystone. The film portrayed an aristocratic Englishman Jack Bardell (played by John Garrick) who joins the Royal Flying Corps during the Great War. In the film, Bardell is badly injured in a crash in France which leaves him with only partial use of his legs. The unclear circumstances surrounding the crash lead him to suffer accusations of cowardice. Determined to reclaim his honour, Bardell secretly rebuilds a derelict aircraft and attachs special stirrups to the rudder pedals so he is able to fly it. He takes off on an un-authorised patrol over London and destroys a Zeppelin raider, restoring his reputation in the process.Carlson, Mark. Flying on Film: A Century of Aviation in the Movies 1912-2012 Bearmanor Media, 2012 pp. 57-58. A German Zeppelin is shot down in the 1930 Howard Hughes film Hell's Angels. A bombing raid by a Zeppelin comprises a major plot point in the Elsie McCutcheon novel Summer of the Zeppelin. Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI In the 2017 film, Wonder Woman, a Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI is loaded with 4,500 pounds of bombs filled with poisonous gas intended for London. Steve Trevor destroys it by detonating the payload mid flight, sacrificing himself.

It condemned ancient pluralistic spiritual tradition along with other Christian creeds such as Arianism as heresies of madmen, and authorized their persecution. Background In 313 the emperor Constantine I, together with his eastern counterpart Licinius, issued the Edict of Milan, which granted religious toleration and freedom for persecuted Christians. By 325 Arianism, a school of christology which contended that Christ did not possess the divine essence of the Father but was rather a primordial creation and an entity subordinate to God, had become sufficiently widespread and controversial in Early Christianity that Constantine called the Council of Nicaea in an attempt to end the controversy by establishing an empire-wide, i.e., \\"ecumenical\\" orthodoxy. The council produced the original text of the Nicene Creed, which rejected the Arian confession and upheld that Christ is \\"true God\\" and \\"of one essence with the Father.\\"Williams & Friell, (1994) pp. 46‚Äì53 However, the strife within the Church did not end with Nicaea, and the Nicene credal formulation remained contentious even among anti-Arian churchmen. Constantine, while urging tolerance, began to think that he had come down on the wrong side, and that the Nicenes -- with their fervid, reciprocal persecution of Arians -- were actually perpetuating strife within the Church. Constantine was not baptized until he was near death (337), choosing a bishop moderately sympathetic to Arius, Eusebius of Nicomedia, to perform the baptism. Constantine's son and successor in the eastern empire, Constantius II was partial to the Arian party, and even exiled pro-Nicene bishops. Constantius' successor Julian (later called \\"The Apostate\\") was the only emperor after the conversion of Constantine to reject Christianity, attempting to fragment the Church and erode its influence by encouraging a revival of religious diversity, calling himself a \\"Hellene\\" and supporting forms of Hellenistic religion. He championed the traditional religious cultus of Rome as well as Judaism, and furthermore declared toleration for all the various unorthodox Christian sects and schismatic movements. Julian's successor Jovian, a Christian, reigned for only eight months and never entered the city of Constantinople. He was succeeded in the east by Valens, an Arian. By 379, when Valens was succeeded by Theodosius I, Arianism was widespread in the eastern half of the Empire, while the west had remained steadfastly Nicene. Theodosius, who had been born in Hispania, was himself a Nicene Christian and very devout. In August, his western counterpart Gratian promoted persecution of heretics in the west. Edict The Edict of Thessalonica was jointly issued by Theodosius I, Gratian, and Valentinian II on 27 February 380. The edict came after Theodosius had been baptized by the bishop Ascholius of Thessalonica upon suffering a severe illness in Thessalonica. Importance The edict was issued under the influence of Ascholius, and thus of Pope Damasus I, who had appointed him. It re-affirmed a single expression of the Apostolic Faith as legitimate in the Roman Empire, \\"catholic\\" (that is, universal)(cf. Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon) and \\"orthodox\\" (that is, correct in teaching).orthodox. Dictionary.com. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. Dictionary definition (accessed: March 03, 2008). After the edict, Theodosius spent a great deal of energy trying to suppress all non- Nicene forms of Christianity, especially Arianism, and in establishing Nicene orthodoxy throughout his realm. The edict was followed in 381 by the First Council of Constantinople, which affirmed the Nicene Symbolum and gave final form to the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed.Boyd (1905), p. 45 In 383, the Emperor ordered the various non-Nicene sects (Arians, Anomoeans, Macedonians, and Novatians) to submit written creeds to him, which he prayerfully reviewed and then burned, save for that of the Novatians. The other sects lost the right to meet, ordain priests, or spread their beliefs.Boyd (1905), p. 47 Theodosius forbade heretics to reside within Constantinople, and in 392 and 394 confiscated their places of worship.Boyd (1905), p. 50 See also * Ancient Roman Christianity * Decline of Greco-Roman paganism * History of late ancient Christianity * Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire * Restoration and tolerance of Paganism from Julian until Valens  References   Bibliography   Category:Religion and politics Category:Christian terminology Category:380 Category:4th-century Christianity Category:Christianity in Roman Macedonia Category:Roman Thessalonica Thessalonica Category:380s in the Roman Empire ","title":"Edict of Thessalonica"},{"id":"24989330","title":"Air Niger"},{"id":"24989346","text":"Ultimate S'Express is a compilation album by English dance music act S'Express.

Howard. It is the first book of an ongoing series chronicling the ventures of Johannes Cabal, a necromancer of some little infamy. Summary Johannes Cabal is a necromancer who has sold his soul to Satan in order to gain his abilities. His goal has always been to completely restore the dead to their previous living state, but Cabal has now found that his lack of a soul is standing in the way of his research. Bored with running Hell and dealing with bureaucracy, Satan offers Cabal a deal: if Cabal can get 100 souls, Satan will return his. However, this deal is not without its difficulties: Cabal only has one year to gather these souls, and he must run a carnival during this time as well. Reception Critical opinion has been mixed. The Wisconsin State Journal was mixed in their opinion, as they felt that the work had some initial promise but \\"loses a bit of steam partway through\\".

Founded in August 2008, the green party advocates environmental protection, sustainable development, and human rights in Lebanon. It is the first Lebanese party to focus primarily on Green politics. History Environmental concerns in Lebanon have been overshadowed by the sectarian nepotist political system and consigned to the bottom of the political agenda. This is despite the fact that Lebanon's tourism industry - a key part of its economy - relies heavily on the green spaces and woodlands that distinguish Lebanon from neighboring countries. The Green Party of Lebanon was founded on 20 August 2008 at a conference in Beirut's Monroe Hotel. The three-hour conference, which assembled 65 members of the Lebanese elite, presented the party's charter and political and economic work plan followed by the election of its 20-member executive board. The executive board elected Philip Skaf, chief executive and creative officer at Grey Worldwide MENA, an advertising agency, as party president. In March 2009, the Green Party declared a state of environmental emergency and announced the launching of an \\"environmental pact\\". Skaf declared that the Party would not run candidates in the 2009 Lebanese general election but stressed that the document will be presented to all Lebanese political parties in order for them to adopt its goals. With electing Nada Zaarour as president in 2011 the Green Party is the first party in Lebanon with a female leader. Lately, in June 2018, Mr Toufic Souk was elected as a new president for the GPL with a new political bureau succeeding Mrs. Zaarour.

She debuted in 1959 and \\"ruled the country's entertainment scene\\" in 1960s and 1970s. She was the first South Korean singer to perform in Japan (following the end of the Japanese occupation of Korea), in Las Vegas, and on The Johnny Carson Show. Kim retired in 2013.  Career  In 1959, one year after Kim graduated from Seoul Jungang Girls' High School, she debuted as a singer at a stage of the Eighth United States Army. In 1963, as a recommendation by composer, Park Chun-seok, Kim sang Pledge of Love (Sarangui maengse), an adapted song of Till and gained a popularity. In the same year, she got a chance to sing at a stage in Las Vegas, United States. With the collaboration with Gil Ok-yun, a renowned composer and her first husband, Kim announced a lot of hit songs, and albums including \\"Sawori gamyeon\\" (literally, Once the April is gone), \\"Sarangui changa\\" (Song in praise of Love), \\"Saranghaneun Maria\\" (Dear Maria), \\"Motiteo\\" (Don't forget you) which are still favored by mid aged fans. During the marriage until 1972, they produced about 70 albums, and 500 to 600 songs. In 1978 Patti Kim became the first Korean pop singer who showed her singing performance at the stage of Sejong Center, which only allowed for classical musicians at that time. In 1989, she had a performance in Carnegie Hall, New York City. In 1996, she was honored the prestigious Hwagwan Cultural Merit by the South Korean government as the third singer after Kim Jeong-gu, and Lee Mi-ja.

A young horse with a parrot mouth. An equine malocclusion is a misalignment between the upper and lower jaws of a horse or other equine. It results in a faulty bite with the upper and lower teeth failing to meet correctly.http://www.dictionary.com Malocclusions can cause pain to the horse and may also lead to weight loss and other eating problems related to poor chewing or loss of appetite. In addition, discomfort can lead to poor behavior when the animal is ridden or driven, particularly if a bit is used in the horse's mouth.  Equine dental malocclusions in the molars  Caudal hooks A caudal hook is characterized by the posterior molar developing a growth which overhangs and ‚Äúhooks‚Äù around the adjacent tooth. This diagram depicts a caudal hook on the lower last molar, however the upper last molar can also develop a caudal hook. Caudal hooks are defined as when the dominant lower or upper last molar overhang the opposing molar. They can be hereditary and may result because a horse is born either parrot-mouthed or monkey- mouthed. They can also be caused secondary to another molar malocclusion that forces the jaw to disalign. This malocclusion results in problems for the horse when eating. It prevents the horse from chewing side to side freely which causes incorrect and excessive tooth wear. The soft tissues of the mouth can be damaged because the hooks are sharp and can cut them. Caudal hooks will also cause discomfort to the horse during riding. To fix caudal hooks, the dominant molar must be reduced, preventing extreme wear to the opposing molar, and rounded so that the soft tissue is not traumatized.http://www.discerninghandsequinedentistry.com/malocclusions.html Rostral hooks A rostral hook is characterized by the first premolar developing a growth that precedes the adjacent tooth. This diagram depicts a rostral hook of the upper first premolar, however a rostral hook can also affect the lower first premolar as well. Rostral hooks occur when the dominant upper front premolars overhang the lower premolars. They can be hereditary or developmental meaning that the horse can have an overbite at birth or can have another malocclusion that forces the disalignment of the jaw. Rostral hooks can result in improper and extreme molar wear especially to the opposing lower premolar. Other problems include bit problems and soft tissue damage. Fixing Rostral hooks requires that you reduce the dominant portion of the upper premolar and round the unopposed portion smoothly towards the gum. Preventive maintenance is required to prevent recurring Rostral hooks. Ramps When there is excessive height to the lower premolars, the horse has a condition known as ramps. They occur when the upper from the premolar deciduous cap or baby tooth is kept resulting in the abnormal growth of the permanent premolar. The problem with ramps is that they prevent the horse from freely chewing side-to-side. This causes improper and over wear of the molars. It will also, along with an underbite, cause severe discomfort when a bit is placed in the horses mouth. To solve the problem, the dominant tooth must be reduced to allow the opposing one to recover. Enamel points Enamel points are sharp points that develop on the inside of the lower molars and outside of the upper molars. They occur over time as the horse stops chewing as far sideways. This makes the unopposed edge tooth get longer. When the edge tooth gets longer it forms razor sharp points. They cause pain to the horse because they irritate the soft tissue of the gums when the horse eats and when certain equipment is used in the mouth resulting in the tongue and cheeks being pulled into these points. To resolve this problem the points must be filed off. Sheared molar table A sheared molar table is the extreme angulation of the chewing surface of the molars. It is caused by a lack of side-to-side chewing. It is a very severe problem because the horse cannot chew sideways. This results in the horse not being able to break down its food properly leading to malnutrition. This malocclusion can be resolved by correcting the angle of the molar table. Wave complexes Wave complexes occur when the molar arcade develops an uneven surface with a wave-like appearance. It usually occurs in the pre-molars and molars. It generally occurs secondarily to other malocclusions. It results in prematurely worn out teeth, periodontal pocketing, decay, and tooth loss. It also prevents the horse from properly grinding its food as it makes side-to-side chewing difficult. A resolution for this problem is the reduction of the high complexes. This allows and encourages the horse to chew side-to-side. Stepped molars These occur when the molar arcade develops a stepped appearance. Its main cause is a missing tooth which allows the opposing teeth to grow into the gap, but it can occur because of uneven wear or if the deciduous cap or baby tooth is retained too long preventing normal tooth growth. It can prevent the horse from freely chewing and cause the improper wear of the molars and incisors. A solution is to reduce the high molar allowing proper chewing. Preventative maintenance must be used to stop this from happening again in the event that it was caused by a lost tooth. Accentuated transverse ridges These are enlarged ridges that run across the chewing surfaces of the molars. They can result from the disalignment of the jaw or the horse is not chewing in a proper sideways motion. They are caused when a hard spot on one tooth digs into and wears out a soft spot on another tooth. They interfere with normal chewing and cause excessive wear to the opposing molars. They can also result in periodontal disease and diastema. To resolve these you must reduce the enlarged ridges to let the opposing teeth recover and allow the horse to chew correctly. Periodontal pockets Periodontal pockets occur when gum disease makes pockets around the teeth. Food gets caught in these pockets and causes even more decay. The disease progresses as the horse is unable to chew properly. It can lead to infection, abscesses in the mouth, and tooth loss. It should be corrected as early as possible, and it is very difficult to stop. If the disease is caught early it can be prevented. Diastema Diastema is defined as a space between two adjoining teeth. Food can be trapped between teeth leading to severe periodontal disease and poor dental health overall. It is very difficult to correct. The unopposed overgrowth of the opposing teeth must be reduced.

It was built in 1903 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. History The congregation was founded in 1871 by the Rev. Dr. Ferdinand C. Ewer, as part of the Anglo-Catholic movement. The rather unusual choice of titular saint, the first-century bishop and martyr Ignatius of Antioch, seems to have been motivated by Ignatius' emphasis on the centrality of the Eucharist and on the unifying role of the bishop.http://anglicanhistory.org/essays/hacking1.html Ironically, the parish was to have somewhat rocky relations with the bishops of New York in its first several decades due to tensions over its Anglo-Catholic practices. The parish first met in the former Holy Light Church (New York City) (a parish for the blind), at 437 Seventh Avenue, then in the former St. Paul's Dutch Reformed Church, located at 54-56 West 40th Street and facing what is now Bryant Park, before erecting the present building.http://www.nycago.org/Organs/NYC/html/StIgnatiusAntioch.html The present church, built under the parish's second rector, the Rev. Arthur Ritchie, was designed to ritualist standards, including features such as a permanent stoup for holy water at the entrance and a built-in confessional.https://saintignatiusnyc.org/Pages/ParishLife/Tour/index.html The first services were held in the new building in 1902. The Bishop of New York, the Rt. Rev. Henry Codman Potter, expressed his disapproval of the parish's ritualist tendencies by his absence from the opening; Bishop Charles C. Grafton of Fond du Lac, a noted leader of the Anglo-Catholic party in the Episcopal Church, presided in his stead.http://anglicanhistory.org/usa/ignatius/gray1946.pdf St. Ignatius of Antioch was among the first Anglo-Catholic parishes to welcome the ministry of ordained women. In 1980 the Rev. Ellen Barrett, the first openly gay woman ordained in the Episcopal Church, preached at Good Friday services; she was later invited to become an associate priest of the parish. This move was controversial at the time, and it tended to divide St. Ignatius from many of its sister Anglo-Catholic parishes that were slower to welcome and affirm the ministry of women.https://www.saintignatiusnyc.org/Pages/Liturgy&Music;/Sermons/Sermons/2015-2016/160821_Blume.html Around the same time, the parish moved from using various editions of the Anglican Missal to using Rite I of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, with the continuation of traditional ritualist features, such as the Angelus, the Asperges, and minor propers chanted in Latin to Gregorian chant tones.http://anglicanhistory.org/usa/ignatius/gray1946.pdfhttps://saintignatiusnyc.org/Pages/Liturgy&Music;/Liturgy.html Architecture St. Ignatius' graceful English Gothic building was completed in 1902SERVICES IN A NEW EDIFICE.; Opening of St. Ignatius P.E.

Goodell was born in Utica, New York, to prominent abolitionist William Goodell. She worked at her father's newspaper, The Principia, and at Harper's Magazine before moving to Janesville, Wisconsin in 1871. She studied law on her own and was admitted to the Rock County, Wisconsin bar in 1874. After her petition for admission to the bar of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin was denied in 1876, Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly John B. Cassoday sponsored a bill expressly authorizing women to be admitted to the state bar. The bill passed in 1877, and Goodell was admitted to practice before the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 1879. In 1880, Goodell argued and won her first case in the Wisconsin Supreme Court, shortly before she died of cancer in Janesville, Wisconsin. Legacy Betty Diamond's play Lavinia is about Goodell. Wisconsin Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson, the State Court‚Äôs Office, and several notable professors of women‚Äôs studies brought Goodell's story to the Wisconsin Humanities Council for grant funding in 2012. The WHC first funded Diamond‚Äôs research and writing of the play, and then with a second grant in 2014 funded the performance of the play throughout Wisconsin.

The would-be combatants were provisional Mexican Army troops and the American Army's \\"Mormon Battalion\\". Tucson temporarily 'fell' in December 1846 without resistance but was immediately reoccupied two days later by the Mexican forces once the US troops moved on. Capture The Mexican War overview map. The Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War began after Thornton's Defeat in 1846. This same year a battalion of Mormon men was recruited by the United States Army in western Iowa and dispatched with General Steven Watts Kearny's \\"Army of the West\\" across what they considered the \\"Great Western Desert\\". The mission assigned to the Mormon Battalion was to create a continuous wagon road from Santa Fe to San Diego‚Äîthe first into southern California. See Southern Emigrant Trail. The American force, of around 499 riflemen and officers, were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Philip St. George Cooke. Only an effective force of 360 took part in the trek across the Arizona desert. Previously, about 150 physically unfit men and some eighty-four women and children family members trailing the Battalion towards Santa Fe had been sent to the trapper/trader compound 'el pueblo' (modern Pueblo Colorado) on the Arkansas River.Tyler, Daniel (1881). A Concise History of the Mormon Battalion in the Mexican War, 1846‚Äì1847. pp. 224‚Äì231 Marching towards Tucson in November 1846, the Mormon Battalion fought their only battle and it was against wild cattle which attacked them near the San Pedro River. After the \\"Battle of the Bulls\\", as it is humorously known, the force turned west towards Tucson, where it seemed they might have to really fight the Mexican garrison of Fort Tucson, a former Spanish presidio. Philip Cooke in his general's uniform during the American Civil War. The Mexican force consisted of around 200 men, most likely infantry and cavalry plus two small brass cannons, as well as an unknown force of men from the garrisons of Tubac, Santa Cruz and Fronteras. The Mexican Captain Antonio Comaduron had received about three days warning of the approaching Americans.Tyler, p 224 Following an exchange of information between the two commanders and parlays regarding safe passage on the 100-mile shorter and easier route through Tucson, Comaduran refused permission to the US Army to enter Tucson, much less would he agree to surrender the presidio. Each side took token prisoners, then released them as tokens of good faith. Tensions were running high and getting higher as Cooke's force approached. Realizing he was outnumbered, Captain Comaduron decided to withdraw without fighting. He also advised many civilians to abandon Tucson with him. The Mexican forces retreated to San Xavier about 8 1/2 miles southwest of Tucson. On December 16, 1846, the US Army unit arrived at the south end of Tucson and prepared to enter the town. Even though the muskets were loaded and bayonets affixed, Col Cooke paused to remind his troops of his Order No 19, given 13 December: \\"We came not to make war against Sonora, and less still to destroy an unimportant outpost of defense against Indians. But we will take the straight course before us and overcome all resistance. But, shall I remind you that the American soldier ever shows justice and kindness to the unarmed and unresisting; the property of individuals you will hold sacred - the people of Sonora are not our enemies.\\"Cooke's Journal of the March, US Senate Documents, January 1849, page 39 No fighting occurred as the small army entered Tucson, passed along the west wall of the Mexican military compound, then camped a half-mile north of town on a small flowing creek.Journals of Robert S. Bliss, Henry G. Boyle, Lt Col P Cooke, William Hyde The Americans began to assure the frightened and staring population of their friendly intentions. Many of the Mormon men were interested in trading for food and clothing. One man related later that a twenty-eight star American flag temporarily flew over Tucson for the first time though neither Cooke nor any other journalist makes any mention of it.Philemon Merrill, adjutant to Cooke is reported to have claimed this later in life, but it is unsubstantiated by any other source. \\"The author (Sgt. Daniel Tyler) remembers, with much gratitude, the silver-haired Mexican, of perhaps more than three score years and ten, who, when signs of thirst were given, ran to the brook ..., dipped up his water, and ... with cheerful countenance, delivered the refreshing and much needed draught. He has doubtless, long since, been gathered to his fathers; if so, peace to his ashes. Surely, 'I was athirst, and he gave me drink.'\\"Tyler, p 227 Lieutenant Colonel Cooke's soldiers had been low on food, so the Mexicans bartered meat and bread for cloth, buttons and pins, but only a little food was transferred to the Mormons through trade. Cooke estimated about 1,500 bushels of wheat grain had been left behind by the Mexican garrison as 'public' (government) property. Cooke ordered 25 bushels of this confiscated for his command's wagon mules and two quarts as food for every three soldiers. All told, Cooke appropriated about 30 bushels of wheat‚Äîabout 2% of the Mexican 'public' wheat stores. None was taken from private families. Tyler goes on to relate that, \\"Quinces and semi-tropical fruits were also purchased here, as well as beans, corn, etc.\\" On 17 December, Cooke determined to make an expedition to the Catholic Indian Mission San Xavier del Bac with about 50 armed men, but they were spotted, prompting the Mexican Army to retreat further south towards the Tubac presidio to avoid an unnecessary fight. That night, some of the sentries created a temporary excitement by signaling that Mexican troops were attempting to attack. Within the hour it was determined to be a false alarm and most of the men tried to get a little more rest.Tyler, p 228‚Äì229 The morning of the 18th, Cooke ended their temporary occupation and continued his march towards the next settlement, the Pima Villages, 75 miles distant across a nearly water-less flat plain. The Mexican forces and inhabitants returned to their unmolested and undespoiled city. Tucson, with about 400-500 inhabitants in 1846,Tyler, pages 224‚Äì231 would officially become an American community ten years later in 1856, following the Gadsden Purchase.

John Dutton had the house re-faced in 1651-53,Verey, 1970, page 396 and James Dutton, 1st Baron Sherborne had alterations made to the church between 1743 and 1776, including the addition of a Doric portico. In 1850-59 John Baron Dutton, 2nd Baron Sherborne had the medieval nave and aisle of the church demolished to allow more light into Sherborne House, and had a new nave and sanctuary built further north. The church contains numerous ornate monuments to members of the Dutton family. The tower has a ring of six bells.The Gloucester & Bristol Diocesan Association of Church Bell Ringers, Cirencester Branch The oldest is medieval; three more were cast in 1653 and the remaining two are 18th-century. In 1624-40 John Dutton acquired land southwest of the village to create a deer park. He had The Lodge built as a viewing stand to watch deer being coursed by greyhounds. In 1898 it was extended for Susan, Lady Sherborne and converted into a house.Verey, 1970, page 397 The National Trust now owns the Lodge Park and Sherborne Estate.https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lodge-park-and-sherborne- park-estate Sherborne House is converted into privately owned apartments and is not open to the public. Economic and social history In 1086 the village had four watermills on Sherborne Brook. By the end of the 19th century only Duckleston Mill, at the west end of the village, remained, and it was disused. In 1961 it was still standing but had been converted into a farmhouse. The Astronomer Royal James Bradley was born in Sherborne in 1693. More than half of the parish was farmed under an open field system until 1777, when the common lands were enclosed. The farmhouse at Stones Farm at the east end of Sherborne village was designed by Richard Pace and built in 1818. The 2nd Baron Sherborne established two schools for boys in 1824. They were merged in 1862, and a schoolhouse was built for them in 1868. By 1906 it had been enlarged to take 165 pupils, but by 1938 attendance had fallen to 80. By 1961 it was a junior school. It is now a Church of England primary school.Sherborne Church of England Primary School Until the 1880s Sherborne was noted as a centre of Morris dancing. Sherborne still has an attractive Village shop and Tea Room which incorporates an outreach Post Office.

The philosopher Spinoza had joined the Collegiants and his ideas became the source of a division in the membership so that they broke into two parties. The Spinozist party was led by Bredenburg and the opponents by Frans Kuyper. These two parties were reunited on the death of their leaders. Bredenberg is known for having written a rebuttal of Spinoza in 1675. His rebuttal apparently explained Spinoza's philosophy so clearly that others accused him of disseminating Spinozism. In the end, he was dissatisfied by his own rebuttal, refuted it, and came to adopt Spinoza's ideas.

While living in Greece, he also used the pseudonyms Nikitas Randos () and M. Spieros (). Biography Nicolas Calas was born Nikos Kalamaris in Lausanne, Switzerland, May 27, 1907, but grew up in Athens, the only son of Ioannis Kalamaris who descended from a family of ship-owners and landowners from the island Syros, and Rosa Caradja who was the great-granddaughter of Markos Botsaris, the military leader and hero of the Greek War of Independence, and a descendant from the Phanariot Caradja family, a noble family which supplied high officials to the Ottoman Empire and rotating rulers to Danubian principalities. Calas later rebelled against his wealthy family background by becoming a Trotskyist, strongly influenced in his turn to radical politics by witnessing the human tragedy of the refugees of the 1922 Asia Minor catastrophe flooding the streets of Athens. Greece Calas studied Law and Political Science at the University of Athens between 1925 and 1930 and became active in the radical Student Society. Although he worked in a law office between 1930 and 1934, he soon abandoned this career to concentrate on his writing, both poetry and literary and political critique, often highly polemical in both style and content. Calas's critical work, mostly published under the pseudonym M. Spieros (influenced by the French revolutionary Maximilien Robespierre), was published in a string of literary and political journals in Greece between 1929 and 1938. He covered a wide range of subjects, such as cinema, politics and literary criticism, and he was the first critic to analyze the poetry of Constantine Cavafy from a Freudo-Marxist perspective. Calas's poetry, published under the pseudonym Nikitas Randos, went through several stylistic changes which reflected his artistic curiosity and interest in the modernist trends of the early 20th century, such as futurism, expressionism and surrealism. In 1932, Calas's debut Poems (Œ†ŒøŒπŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒ±) was published. One of the first true modernists in Greece, Calas was clearly ahead of his time and suffered some negative criticism. His debut was followed by four poetry \\"notebooks\\" (Tetradia, Greek: Œ§ŒµœÑœÅŒ¨Œ¥ŒπŒ± Œë‚Äô-Œî‚Äô) which circulated hors de commerce between 1933 and 1936. France Between 1934 and 1937, Calas split his time between Athens and Paris, where he soon became a member of the surrealist group attached to Andr√© Breton. The politically repressive climate in Greece after the 1936 coup of the dictator General Metaxas necessitated his permanent abandonment of Greece and he thus settled permanently in Paris in 1937. He continued writing poems, now in French, which were highly influenced by his immersion in surrealist poetics. Unpublished at the time, Calas's French poems finally appeared in a bilingual edition (French-Greek) in 2002 in Greece. In 1938, Calas published a book of Freudo‚ÄìSurrealist‚ÄìTrotskyist criticism in French, Foyers d‚Äôincendie (Hearths of Arson) which revealed his influence by theoreticians of the Frankfurt School, especially Wilhelm Reich, as well as the manifesto \\"Towards a Free Revolutionary Art\\" formulated by Leon Trotsky, Diego Rivera and Andr√© Breton in Mexico in 1938. Portugal Forced to leave France at the eruption of World War II, Calas reached Lisbon in October 1939 where he waited for an opportunity to get on a boat to USA. During the few months he stayed in the Portuguese capital, he studied the baroque architecture of the city apart from trying to form a group of surrealists. He was finally able to leave Europe behind in the beginning of 1940 after receiving a visa through the help of his friend Sherry Mangan, an American Trotskyist poet and journalist working for Time magazine. New York Calas arrived in New York as one of the first √©migr√© surrealists in 1940 and ended up living there until his death in 1988, working mainly as an art critic for several leading art journals, such as View, Village Voice, Arts Magazine and Artforum. Before Calas was able to carve a niche for himself as an art critic and lecturer, he earned his living from a number of odd jobs. From 1942 to 1945 he worked in the French and Greek sections of the Office of War Information as well as in the Balkan section of the Intelligence Service. His first book in English, a collection of essays on poetry, Portuguese Baroque, portrait painting and modern architecture, Confound the Wise, was published in 1942. In 1943 he married the divorcee Elena von Hoershelman, a Russian-born psychoanalyst with whom he would go on to collaborate on a number of research projects, articles and books. For some years they worked together at the Columbia University Project of Studies in Contemporary Cultures. During this time Calas became a research-associate and consultant for the renowned anthropologist Margaret Mead and in 1953 their collaboration resulted in the publication of an anthropological anthology entitled Primitive Heritage. Calas received three successive grants from the Bollingen Foundation (1949‚Äì1951) to write a study of the triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch but failed to get it published and continued rewriting the manuscript until his death. From the 1960s onwards Calas pursued a career as an art critic and as a lecturer of art history at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey. As one of the few surrealists, Calas showed an interest in the new American art movements of the 1960s and wrote extensively on the subject of Pop Art apart from advocating a redefinition of surrealist goals and expressions. Many of his essays were collected in the volumes Art in the Age of Risk (1968), Icons and Images of the Sixties (1971) and Transfigurations (1985). Following the coup of the Colonels in Greece in 1967, Calas collaborated with the exiled Greek revolutionary Trotskyist Michalis Raptis (Pablo) who was active in the resistance abroad. Greek comeback After spending some time in Greece during the 1950s, sorting out the family affairs after the death of his father, Calas began to write poems again in Greek in a cryptic and satirical style. These poems were first published in the avant-garde journal Pali (Œ†Œ¨ŒªŒπ) in the 1960s. This led to a comeback in Greece where he had previously been ignored or neglected as a poet. His old poems were republished together with his new poetry in the two collections Nikitas Randos Street (ŒüŒ¥œåœÇ ŒùŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÑŒ± Œ°Œ¨ŒΩœÑŒøœÖ), which won the State Prize for poetry in 1977, and Scripture and Light (ŒìœÅŒ±œÜŒÆ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÜœâœÇ) in 1983. Interest in his writings has been steadily increasing in Greece and he is now acknowledged as a groundbreaking poet and an important representative of modernism and a forerunner to Greek surrealism. After the death of Nicolas Calas in 1988 and his wife Elena Calas one year later, their art collection was inherited by the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebaek, Denmark. The Nicolas and Elena Calas Archives are located at the Nordic Library in Athens.

Early life, career and family Roscoe (he did not use his given first name of Paris) Vanover, Sr. was born in the Cumberland Mountain district of Wise County, Virginia. He was the son of John and Keziah (Landreth) Vanover. His father was a deputy county clerk and Justice of the Peace in Pike County, Kentucky. His mother was a relative of the Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Roscoe was the youngest of ten children. Roscoe attended a small pine- log school house as a young boy. When he was eighteen, he began teaching school in the rural districts of Pike County, where he remained for fourteen years. His interest in the law began at this time, when he started writing legal papers for his father and neighbors. He was a self-taught student and was admitted to the bar in 1895. He taught Sunday school and served as an elder for twenty-five years in the Christian Church of Pikeville. He was married to Martha Potter in 1885. They had thirteen children. His wife Martha Jane Potter is mentioned in Kerr's History of Kentucky (under Judge Roscoe Vanover's article) and given the honor of knitting more wool sock for the soldiers during World War l than any other female in the United States. Before being elected to District Court Judge, Vanover served as Deputy Sheriff of Pike County, Kentucky and was a practicing attorney-at-law. As a lawyer he was regarded as one of the leading members of the Pike County bar and his impartiality and thorough knowledge and application of the law made his position a permanent one in the judicial history of Kentucky. During his legal career, he conducted as many cases than any other attorney in eastern Kentucky. As a Trustee, he helped to establish Christian Normal Institute (now known as Kentucky Christian University) in Grayson, Kentucky. A tribute page was given to him in their 1927‚Äì28 yearbook, the Graysonian, at the time of his death. He helped students financially, who wanted to pursue a legal education and also helped students attend the Christian Normal Institute who could not afford to do so. In 1919, he was elected Judge of the Circuit Court of Pike and Letcher counties of Kentucky. Circuit Court Judge for Pike and Letcher County, Kentucky As a judge, he established an enviable record for his fight against the illegal whisky interests. He destroyed over 150 illegal moonshine stills. His slogan when he was running for office was \\"Destroy the Stills and Save the BOYS\\". Judge Vanover's fight against illegal moonshine was so successful he managed to jail a wealthy local contractor, and even the county's deputy sheriff and the deputy sheriff's two teenage sons, for whisky violations. Instead of making and running moonshine, Judge Vanover told the guilty they should join up and fight in World War I. His impartiality was unlimited; he sent two of his own sons to jail for being mixed up in a whisky selling scheme. Of the twenty-six murder cases tried in Pike and Letcher county, Kentucky in 1921, twenty-five were directly caused by whisky according to Judge Vanover, \\"Stamp out whisky and you put down murder and other forms of lawlessness\\". His goal was to stamp out bootlegging in the two counties. In 1920, his Letcher County grand juries had returned more than 400 true bills against whiskey traffickers. He served as circuit court judge for only two years, 1919 through 1921, but in these two years he was able to accomplish more in ridding Pike and Letcher Counties of their illegal moonshine business than any other judge. He had a good record as a trial judge and the record of his services, as revealed by the decisions of the Court of Appeals, shows that reversals of his rulings were rare. As Judge of Pike and Letcher Counties, one of his first duties, for the first time in history, was to open each session of court with prayer for the court and the juries. He himself would lead the court in prayer. At the time of his death, in September 1927, he was the eldest member of the bar in active practice. A street in downtown Pikeville was named in his honor. He remained a law student all his life, as he was constantly reading law books. He only stopped studying the law two weeks prior to his death, because he was too ill to continue. His knowledge of the law was so great that he memorized all the Statutes and Code of Practice and could describe from memory the indexes and tables of contents. Any particular section he wished to find was fixed in his memory.http://www.kykinfolk.com/pulaski/news/2_21/2_11_1921.htm References Kerr's History of Kentucky https://www.kcu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/For- the-Good-of-the-Cause-x.pdf Further reading *The Political Graveyard: Index to Politicians *RootsWeb; SE-Kentucky-L Judge Roscor Vanover 1921 *News; Excerpts from the Somerset Journal, 5 March 1920 *The Somerset Journal February 11, 1921 *Resolution of the Pike County Bar Association on the Death of Judge Vanover, Christian Normal Institute *The Graysonian Yearbook (1928). \\"Our Tribute of Respect to Judge Roscoe Vanover\\" External links *http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com *http://Pikecounty.potterflats.com/photos13.htm *http://listsearches.rootsweb.com/th/read/KY-FOOTS/STEPS/2003-10/1067181145 *http://files.usgwarchives.net/ky/pulaski/newspapers/sj3_12_1920.txt *http://www.usgwarchives.net *http://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Vanover-79 Category:1863 births Category:1927 deaths Category:Circuit court judges in the United States Category:American justices of the peace Category:People from Wise County, Virginia Category:People from Grayson, Kentucky ","title":"Roscoe Vanover"},{"id":"24989865","text":"All Saints' Episcopal Church is a historic Episcopal church in Briarcliff Manor, New York. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. John David Ogilby, whose summer estate and family home in Ireland were the namesakes of Briarcliff Manor, founded the church in 1854. The church was built on Ogilby's summer estate in Briarcliff Manor. Richard Upjohn designed the church building, which was constructed from 1848 to 1854 and expanded in 1911. The church has several memorial windows, including one by John LaFarge and a rose window by Frederick Wilson of Tiffany Studios. History The church's opening service was held on December 13, 1854, and Ogilby donated the church's current building and grounds in 1863. He gave the church its first name, \\"All Saints' Church, Brier Cliff, Sing Sing, N. Y.\\", naming his property Brier Cliff after his family home in Ireland. In 1910, the church building was enlarged to the present cruciform shape, and it was consecrated on November 1, 1911. In 1945, the church purchased property to the north and east of the building; a parish hall was built there in 1949 and dedicated on January 29, 1950. In the 2000s, photographer Mark Sadan informally led the Sunday Photo Group, which had about 24 members and met at All Saints', on the second Sunday of each month. In late 2006, the church was featured on Nightline and USA Today for hosting U2charists, Eucharists accompanying U2 songs; the church has held two such services. The church estimated that of the people to attend one of their U2charists, 70 percent were visitors. Notable rectors include Thomas Hazzard and John Adams Howell. Hazzard was the founder of Hope Farm, and was a football player and coach, as well as a minister, dairy farmer, treasurer, and missionary in Liberia. John Adams Howell invented the Howell torpedo and other naval devices; he was also a rear admiral in the US Navy. Design John David Ogilby, founder of the church The church building was designed by architect Richard Upjohn and built between 1848 and 1854. The church was modeled on Saint Andrew's in Bemerton, England, and it is an example of the modest English Gothic parish church popular in the region during the mid-19th century. The building was originally designed with a simple rectangular nave with a high-pitched slate-covered gable roof and exterior walls of random- coursed granite ashlar in the Gothic Revival style. A transept and enlarged chancel were added in 1911. There is a metal steeple at the gable crossing. Memorial windows include one by John LaFarge (1889) and a rose window \\"Adoration of the Magi\\" (1911) by Frederick Wilson of Tiffany Studios. Also on the property is a Stick Style rectory dated to 1883 and an Arts and Crafts- style Old Parish Hall built in 1904. All Saints' Preschool All Saints runs a preschool program for children two to five years old. The program involves spiritual and ethical teaching, class trips, and activities including gym, music, playground, art, cooking, and drama.

It is a timber frame structure built in the 1830s. In 1989 it and its adjoining cemetery were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Quakers had been active in north central Westchester County since the mid-18th century. The current meeting house was the third they built; fire destroyed both predecessors. Not only is it one of the most well-preserved and intact in the county, it is a rare surviving meeting house built by a Hicksite meeting during that schism in American Quakerism. Architecturally the meeting house shows some signs of Greek Revival influence, also unusual for Quaker buildings. The addition of a porch later in the 19th century also brought in some Victorian touches, again unusual. Its interior was renovated and the building resided when meetings were revived after a brief period of dormancy. However, many of its original furnishings remain. Taking up most of the property is the meeting's cemetery, which contains many graves of its members from the earlier years, along with that of Robert Capa, the accomplished mid-century war photographer, and his brother Cornell, although neither were members of the meeting, much less Quakers. The headstones of those graves strongly reflect Quaker burial practices, and thus the cemetery is included in the listing as a contributing resource. An architecturally sympathetic First Day School building added when meetings resumed in the 1970s is non-contributing due to its newness. Buildings and grounds The lot on which the meeting house, First Day school and cemetery are located is on the west side of Quaker Church Road, also at that point the boundary between the towns of Yorktown and Somers to its east. It is located north of Quaker Church's southern end at Saw Mill River Road (also U.S. Route 202, New York State Route 35 and New York State Route 118). This area was formerly the hamlet of Amawalk, which still lends its name not just to the meeting house but to the Amawalk Reservoir, part of the New York City water supply system, a half-mile (800 m) to the east. Topographically the area consists of small low hills with occasional narrow depressions, often filled by creeks or wetlands, in between. The meeting house property slopes upward to the west, draining into the valley of an unnamed tributary of Hallocks Mill Brook, a tributary of the Muscoot River, which drains Amawalk Reservoir on its way to Muscoot Reservoir. Its neighborhood is residential, with most houses on large mostly wooded lots. Across Quaker Church are two houses on such lots. Behind them is a cleared power line right-of-way closely paralleled by the North County Trailway rail trail. To the meeting house's west is Amawalk Hill Cemetery, with another cemetery, Carpenter Hill, to the north, buffered by a woodlot. Meeting house A short gravel driveway gives access to the property from the road, passing under the century-old oak and maple trees that shade and screen most of the lot. The meeting house is on the north of the parking area at its end. It is a two-and-a-half-story rectangular wood frame building measuring , with one bay per 10 feet (3 m) of space on the facades. Wooden shingles make up most of the siding of the main block, with a small section of clapboard below the roofline. At its base is a fieldstone foundation; a single brick chimney pierces the center of the slate-shingled gable roof. A hip roofed porch runs the length of the first story's south (front) facade at ground level; on the west end is a small shed-roofed clapboard-sided one-story one-bay addition. Two separate entrances with paneled wooden double doors are located just inside the outermost windows of the ground floor underneath the porch. The windows themselves are six-over-six double-hung sash windows in plain wooden surrounds with paneled wooden shutters echoing the doors. On the east facade's first story are similarly treated six-over-six double-hung windows. The western addition has a single similar window but without shutters, as does the northern facade. The porch has a low concrete deck. In its middle are three plain wooden benches with curved backs arranged in a square pattern, facing outward. At its west end a single paneled wooden door leads into the shed-roofed addition. The roof is supported by seven square wooden pillars with curved brackets at the top. It has a molded cornice. On the second story all windows are two-over-two double- hung sash, set in plain wooden surrounds without shutters. A smaller two-over- two is set in the apex of both gables at the attic level. On the south, scrolled brackets against the clapboard section support a molded cornice similar to that on the porch. =Interior= Both entrances open into the main meeting room, with cushioned wooden benches similar to those on the porch arranged facing the center. Some, meant for the meeting's, are fixed in place; The elders' benches, fixed in place, are arranged in three ascending steps; the other benches are not and can be reconfigured as necessary. Two small collapsible tables for the recording of minutes are located at either end of the first elders' bench. In the middle of the benches are two small wood- burning stoves, one of which dates to the late 19th century. The building otherwise has no heating, plumbing or electricity. The room is floored in linoleum. On the plain plaster walls traces of the wall that partitioned the meeting room into separate sections for men and women are still visible. The frame of a door that once breached that wall is also present, on the south side. A door in the west wall leads to the addition, which serves as a cloakroom and privy. Inside, the meeting house's hand-hewn pegged structural beams are exposed. Several wooden pillars, some with original kerosene lamps attached, hold up the wooden gallery, reached by stairs in the southern corners. It is 8 feet () above the ground floor, deep on the southern side and on the east and west sides. The former has loose benches while the latter sections have fixed ones. A ladder on the east side climbs to the full-length attic. There, as in the cloakroom, the building's structural beams are exposed. First Day School and cemetery On the south side of the parking lot is the First Day School building. It is a smaller timber frame gable- roofed structure with the same siding and color treatment as the meeting house. Since it was built on the site of the meeting's stable in the 1970s, it is considered a non-contributing resource to the property's historic character. alt=A smaller building with a pointed roof in the same colors as the meeting house. It has wooden steps in the front at the center and a wooden ramp at the right Conversely, the cemetery, rising up the hillside to the west, is considered a contributing site. Its graves, some of which are thickly overgrown, date from the late 18th century when the meeting was established to the present. The oldest with an identifiable name on its marker is that of Eugent Weeks, who died in 1805. Early markers are of sandstone, giving way to marble for later burials. Many of the headstones reflect the Quaker virtue of simplicity and are devoid of funerary art, save for some on the southwest corner with a weeping willow design. They simply list the deceased's name, relationship to any others nearby, date of birth and date of death on the side facing away from the meeting house. Some graves have no markers at all. History From its emergence in the mid-17th century, the Religious Society of Friends, later known as the Quakers, faced religious persecution in England. As Dissenters, their opposition to maintaining a leadership hierarchy or indeed any clergy at all was considered blasphemous and heretical, and members often met in secret. Many emigrated to the American colonies, where they could be a little more relaxed, but although their numbers grew they did not feel safe being open in their meetings until the mid-18th century. 1760‚Äì1797: Establishment of Amawalk Meeting With the new tolerance came a growth in Quaker meetings. Northern Westchester County was one of the hotbeds of that growth. Quakers established Chappaqua's original center around a 1754 meeting house that remains in use. The Amawalk meeting seems to have gotten its start around 1760. Six years later, the Purchase Monthly Meeting's minutes note that the \\"Cortlands Manor\\" meeting had sustained itself for at least a year, and the following year formally extended it for another year. Growth continued, and the Amawalk meeting requested and received permission to build its first meeting house, on the current site, in 1772. It was completed the following year, and Amawalk was granted Preparative Meeting status in 1774. Five years later, the first meeting house was damaged by fire. Repairs were not done until 1783, and by that time the meeting had already decided to build a new house. The new meeting house was completed and paid for two years later. It was described as being of similar dimensions to the current building, with timber posts and cedar facing. While the new house was being built, the Amawalk Quakers met in Chappaqua. In 1785 it was merged with that Monthly Meeting for administrative purposes. The meeting began establishing itself in the community‚Äîit started educating its children. In 1791 it started a school but had to close it down two years later when it could not find enough qualified teachers. In its stead, the meeting decided in 1796 to support a boarding school being planned by the Nine Partners Meeting outside the village of Millbrook in Dutchess County to the north. The meeting engaged in social activism as well. In 1783 a member who had bought a slave in order to set him free asked the meeting to consider whether such an act was appropriate; the next month it was decided that it was not. The Amawalk meeting nevertheless followed the strong and growing abolitionist stance of American Quakers; by the next year it reported that none of its members owned slaves. 1798‚Äì1839: Growth and schism At the end of the century, in 1798, Amawalk finally received its own status as a Monthly Meeting. With the newer, bigger meeting house, members kept being added. By 1828, Amawalk had had under its care five Preparative Meetings: Peach Pond (discontinued 1811), Salem- Bedford, Peekskill and Croton. alt=An engraved portrait of a man's head and shoulders in early 19th-century attire That same year, the meeting had to make a choice between two sides in a schism dividing American Quakers. In response to the growing fervor among evangelical Protestants in the country as a whole that has since come to be known as the Second Great Awakening, many orthodox Quaker meetings adopted practices similar to more mainstream Protestant denominations, adding rituals like hymns and prayers to their services. This was opposed by Elias Hicks, a Long Island Quaker influenced by the freethought movement, who not only reaffirmed the inner light as the traditional Quaker path to the divine but held it superior to the Bible. Many meetings chose one side or the other, and Amawalk's Quakers went with Hicks. The Orthodox members, who at one point had barred the Hicksites from the building, left to build their own meeting house closer to contemporary Yorktown Heights in 1832; it is no longer extant. Near the end of 1830, the Amawalk meeting house burned. This time the damage was complete. The following year the current meeting house was built. Its construction costs came in slightly over the budgeted $1,250 ($ in modern dollars). It stands out from other Quaker meeting houses in two ways. Since the Orthodox meetings had, like the Amawalk splinter group, generally been the ones to leave and build their own meeting houses, while the Hicksites stayed in the existing buildings, the Amawalk meeting house is a rare meeting house built by a Hicksite meeting. Also, its design shows some of influence of the contemporary Greek Revival style, in the use of clapboard siding below the roof eave on the south (front) facade, creating a frieze. Quaker meeting houses built by the meetings, as opposed to structures adapted for their use, usually shun any architectural influences of their time in favor of a restrained plainness. Originally the meeting house's interior had a wall to allow for separate men's and women's business meetings, since women sometimes felt overwhelmed in the presence of men; this is the reason for the two entrances as well. By the mid-1830s the minutes record that 74 families were members of the meeting. There was turnover among them‚Äîsome members left the area or were disowned for alcohol use, marrying non-Quakers, or failure to attend meetings; but they were replaced by members who moved in from other areas and new converts. Activism continued; one member was imprisoned for 16 days in 1839 over his refusal to pay a \\"military demand\\" of $5. 1840‚Äì1903: Decline Membership began to decline in the 1840s, due in part to the effects of the schism on the meetings and the general fragmentation of society. In 1848 the Croton meeting was dissolved. At some point around this time, the shed addition was built on to the western side of the meeting house to serve as a cloakroom and privy. A belief that the building was a station on the Underground Railroad during this era has never been substantiated. The Civil War, fought over slavery, tested the beliefs of all Quakers, including Amawalk. Near the war's end in 1865, the meeting's minutes record that \\"Friends have not been as careful to bear our testimony against war as the discipline requires.\\" A footnote clarifies this, noting that five members had paid for substitutes to go into the Union Army in their stead, and at least one had enlisted himself. In the years after the Civil War, the meeting's decline continued. Realizing that its insularity and withdrawal from society at large had been part of the reason for this, in 1869 the Society stopped discouraging its members from holding public office. The Amawalk meeting also improved its amenities, purchasing two wood-burning stoves, one of which remains, to heat the building during colder weather in 1883. Another 19th-century addition, the porch, reflects contemporary architectural trends in the curved brackets that connect its roof and the wooden support pillars, a Victorian touch that like the clapboard frieze reflects contemporary architectural trends, unusually for Quaker meeting houses. While the members remained politically and socially active, writing the state legislature in 1882 in support of prohibition, these measures were not enough to stop the decline. Although Amawalk was able to sustain itself, its remaining preparative meetings, in Peekskill and Salem, could not. They were discontinued in 1883 and the remaining members merged into Amawalk. Even so, two years later the separate men's and women's meetings were merged. By the end of 1886 Amawalk's records indicate that it had just 96 members; no new members joined that year. Three years later, the land that had been purchased to build a meeting house in Peekskill was sold, followed by the Salem property in 1891. The remaining members continued their activism, again writing the legislature in protest of its passage of legislation that lowered New York's age of consent to 13 later that year, and urging that it replace the death penalty with life imprisonment. Amawalk became an executive meeting in 1897, and it was incorporated in 1903. 1904‚Äì1976: Capa burial and closure Meetings continued despite the continuing decline in members, although they were not held regularly. In 1920 Hicksite and Orthodox Quakers reached out to each other and began the long process of reconciling; it would take almost a half-century. Ten years later the carpet in the interior was taken up and replaced by linoleum. The Amawalk meeting remained active, becoming involved in activities that were more supportive than advocacy. They collected books for Faith Cabin Libraries serving African-American communities in Georgia and South Carolina. During World War II, they knitted patchwork quilts to be sent overseas and, afterwards, sponsored two of the Hiroshima Maidens who came to the United States for plastic surgery on their injuries. alt=A black-and-white picture of a man from his left, in profile, with short dark hair holding a large black device to his face. In 1954 war photographer Robert Capa, whose gritty \\"Magnificent Eleven\\", taken under heavy German fire, are considered iconic images of the Normandy landings during World War II, died after he stepped on a land mine in Vietnam while covering the First Indochina War. John Morris, Capa's editor at Life magazine in London during the Normandy landings and at Magnum Photos at the time of his death, felt that a Quaker funeral would be a fitting tribute to Capa, a nonobservant Jew who had immigrated from Hungary. Morris' reasoning was that, even though Capa had not been a Quaker, he sought to promote peace through his depictions of the horrors of war. As a member of the Purchase Quarterly Meeting, which oversaw Amawalk, he arranged for a Quaker service there. At the service, Capa's brother Cornell said Kaddish. A young Dirck Halstead was among the attendees. The few remaining members of the Amawalk meeting allowed Capa to be buried in their cemetery. Later his mother and sister-law were buried in the same plot, and Capa's biographer Richard Whelan joined them when he died. In 2008 Cornell, who had founded the International Center for Photography during the intervening years, was laid to rest alongside his brother. None of them were Quakers. Ten years later, the meeting no longer had enough members to sustain itself. In 1964 it was officially closed. The house remained, suffering from neglect. What members there had been remained socially active, helping a Vietnamese family resettle in the area. 1977‚Äìpresent: Revival and renovation Four years after Amawalk closed, the Hicksites and Orthodox Quakers fully reconciled and ended the schism after a century and a half. Along with the spiritual quests by baby boomers that have been called the Fourth Great Awakening, that helped rekindle interest in the Society. Meetings began being held again in 1977, and shortly afterward the window was added to the south side of the cloakroom, the most recent change to the meeting house's exterior. The new members made the property their priority. The First Day School building was completed in 1987, with full modern amenities, on the site of a former horse stall. During the week it was used by a local nursery school. That same year, Amawalk had enough members to become a monthly meeting again. In 1993, four years after the property was listed on the National Register, the meeting secured a $50,000 matching grant from the state's Historic Preservation Office to renovate the interior of the building, which had suffered from insect infiltration and water seepage over the years. The meeting raised its half through an auction of historic photos organized by Cornell Capa.

Background Chief Adebisi Akande was born in Ila Orangun on 16 January 1939 in what is now the Osun Central Senatorial district. . He was elected on the Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) platform. Akande was described as the nephew of Chief Bola Ige. Governorship Osun State, Nigeria Akande was elected governor of Osun State in April 1999, running for the Alliance for Democracy (AD) party, which had recently formed as a political arm of the Yoruba socio-cultural organization Afenifere. He succeeded Col. Theophilus Bamigboye, who had been named as the military administrator of the State in August 1998, and who handed over power on 29 May 1999. On 31 May 1999, Akande inaugurated the second Assembly in Osun State. In January 2000, the Osun State government sacked 143 staff of the Osun State Broadcasting Corporation, following the governor‚Äôs earlier vow to trim the state‚Äôs work force. Akande dissolved the state Council of Obas and Chiefs in 2001, on the ground that it was too large. The dissolution may have been caused by a dispute between the then head of the royal council, the Ooni of Ile-Ife and Akande, in turn part of a face-off between Akande and the deputy governor, Iyiola Omisore. A November 2001 appraisal of Osun State said that Akande was battling an unfriendly work force, and the state was also troubled by long-standing violence between the Ife and Modakeke clans. However, Akande had implemented his party's programs for providing free education and free medical care, and had improved water supplies. A different appraisal, two months later, noting the governor had recently survived an impeachment attempt, said that rather than improving social services and generating employment, after two years in power Akande had implemented massive staff lay offs in the public service, and had caused virtual collapse of public infrastructure. On 24 December 2001, Akande's supporter, Bola Ige, the minister of justice, was murdered in his house in Ibadan. A national daily, ThisDay newspaper said that the murder could have been linked to the feud between Akande and the deputy governor, Iyiola Omisore. The murder followed another murder the previous week of Osun State legislator Odunayo Olagbaju, who was bludgeoned to death outside his home. Olagbaju was a supporter of Omisore. Akande ran for re-election in 2003, but was defeated by Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola of the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Later career In late 2003, rival factions of the AD held separate conventions. In the Lagos convention, Akande was elected as AD chairman. In January 2006, the convoy of AD leaders who supported Chief Mojisoluwa Akinfenwa faction instead of Akande as the party's national chairman was attacked by thugs in Osogbo, the capital of Osun State. In a February 2006 interview, former Senator Moji Akinfenwa verbally attacked Akande and denied that he was head of the AD. Discussing Akande's feud with his deputy, Iyiola Omisore, he acknowledged that most of the funding for Akande‚Äôs governorship campaign was donated by Omisore, but said it was a serious error to have accepted him as a running mate. In June 2005, Akande attended an International Conference on Sustainable Democracy in Nigeria held at the Imperial College, London. In October 2005, Akande visited the US to meet with AD supporters in the Nigerian diaspora. Speaking in July 2006, Akande attacked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, which he implied was not acting impartially. He defended the AD, which he said was stronger even than it had been in 1999. He called for a more decentralized, federal form of government. Speaking in February 2009, Akande said the only solution to hostage-taking in the Niger Delta area was to give youths employment opportunities, and to involve them in decision making. He cautioned against a military solution, saying in the past the military had looted the nation's treasury and impoverished the people. Speaking in favour of democracy, he stated that when the AD governors accepted President Olusegun Obasanjo's request to avoid local council polls, they fell into a trap. Obasanjo was able to select delegates who helped him win the 2003 elections. In October 2009, the Osun State Commissioner for Education, Alhaji Jelili Adesiyan, blamed the poor performance of Osun State students in examinations on the administration of Akande, whom he asserted had neglected the schools. In September 2006, the Akande faction merged with other opposition parties to form the Action Congress Party, which later changed their name to the Action Congress of Nigeria. In February 2013 the party announced plans to merge with the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), and a faction of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to form the All Progressives Congress (APC).Maram, Mazen (7 February 2013). \\"Nigerian Biggest Opposition Parties Agree to Merge\\".

It was built in the early years of the 20th century on land donated by Horace Greeley's daughter Gabrielle and her husband, himself a priest of the Episcopal Church. In 1979 it was one of several properties associated with Greeley in Chappaqua listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Church of Saint Mary Virgin and Greeley Grove. During his 1872 campaign for President, in which he ran unsuccessfully as the first and only nominee of the Liberal Republican Party against eventual winner Ulysses S. Grant, Greeley, then editor of the New York Tribune, had hosted a massive lunch and reception on the property. He had planted the large grove of evergreen trees 16 years earlier as a windbreak for his farm, part of his campaign to promote reforestation and conservation. After the election but before the counting of the electoral votes, Greeley died, and Gabrielle inherited the farm, which at the time covered most of what is now downtown Chappaqua. When Gabrielle's daughter Muriel died in childhood in 1903, she and her husband, The Rev. Dr. Frank Clendenin, built the church as a private chapel. Architect Morgan O'Brien designed a stone Gothic Revival building that closely copied the 15th-century Church of Saint Mary the Virgin in Monken Hadley, England. Two years later, an original stained glass window from that church was given to the Chappaqua copy. In 1916 the Clendenins transferred it to the Diocese of New York, with some stipulations in the deed, among them that they and their children remain buried in a small plot at the rear of the church. It has since become a parish church; its annual Strawberry Festival is one of Chappaqua's most popular events. Buildings and grounds The church is located just south of downtown Chappaqua, on a parcel on the east side of South Greeley Avenue. It is in a level area along the headwaters of the Saw Mill River between the hills that otherwise dominate northern Westchester County. To its north is Robert E. Bell Middle School. Both buildings have large lawns on their deep setbacks from the street. Greeley Grove, with many evergreen trees over high, is to the south, east and some of the west. In the former direction it provides a buffer between the church and the more modern Chappaqua library; in the latter the ground rises sharply to residential property along Aldridge Road. Across the street is a baseball diamond, providing open space between the church and the New Castle town hall to the southwest. Beyond it, and beyond the diamond's outfield fence, are the parking lots of the Chappaqua station on Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line, whose tracks parallel both the Saw Mill River and eponymous parkway to their west. The old stone station building, currently used as a waiting area and caf√©, is also listed on the Register along with the semicircular plaza across from it, which features a statue of Horace Greeley since his daughter and son- in-law also donated the land for the station. From the middle school parking lot a driveway goes south to the church building. It is a cruciform-plan one- and-a-half-story fieldstone structure topped by a steeply pitched gabled roof covered in shingles. At the west (front) end is a three-story square tower with a round turret on its northwest corner. On its north side is a small one- story flat-roofed extension. A parish hall, with a gabled roof pierced by gabled dormer windows, is off to the northeast. alt=An L-shaped stone building with a pointed roof and a red door at the right end, similar to the tower shown above, which is visible in the left rear The church's corners have stone buttresses, alternately smooth-faced and fieldstone. At the main and rear (east) end are entrances with a pointed-arched wooden door set in a gray square surround; a set of stone steps with iron railings lead to the main entrance from the driveway, flanked by rhododendrons and other trimmed shrubbery. Its windows are either round-arched or pointed-arched, with sills and lintels of smooth stone. The east end is set with a single round oculus. At the gables a low parapet marks the roofline. On the tower, the buttresses rise two stories to a stone cornice, which separates the two stages. It has a slight rise above the pointed-arch window below corresponding to the width of the round-arched window above. Above that story, another cornice sets off the battlements at the roofline. The turret has two narrow windows. It, too, is topped by battlements but not divided into stages. The extension on the north wall also has battlements. History From its settlement by Quakers in the early 18th century, Chappaqua had been a small self-sufficient farming community clustered around the meetinghouse, today at the center of the Register-listed Old Chappaqua Historic District a half-mile (800 m) north of downtown along King Street (New York State Route 120). The construction of the New York and Harlem Railroad through the area in the middle of the 19th century changed that. The farmers started growing cash crops for the New York City market newly available to them, and the city began coming to Chappaqua. Its first commuter was Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune. He saw a chance to distance himself from his professional life in the city and give his wife and daughter a quiet life in the country. In addition, he wanted to test out the experimental farming techniques he advocated in his column, widely read in much of rural America. One of them was the planting of the grove, which in addition to being visually appealing also fit in with his support for conservation and reforestation. By 1872, it had grown so large and impressive he held a large reception there in support of his candidacy for president that year on the Liberal Republican and Democratic lines. He ultimately lost that year, as Ulysses S. Grant was re-elected. After the election but before the Electoral College voted, he died. His daughter Gabrielle inherited the family farm, which then consisted of in what is now downtown Chappaqua. alt=A tower similar to the one in the article infobox, with lighter stone, more quoining, different window designs and its turret on a different corner Later in the century Gabrielle and her husband, The Rev. Dr. Frank Clendenin, priest rector of St. Peter's Episcopal Church in the city, began subdividing the property. When their daughter Muriel died of polio in 1903 at the age of five, they commissioned a memorial chapel next to the grove Horace Greeley had planted. Architect Morgan O'Brien produced a Gothic Revival design that closely copied Saint Mary the Virgin Church, a parish church built in 1494 in Monken Hadley, England, on the outskirts of London. It was completed in 1904 and consecrated in 1906, with a stained glass window, now in the north transept, donated from the English church. In 1913 the church became a mission church of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. Three years later, the Clendenins transferred title of the four-acre (1.6-ha) parcel to the Diocese. They made several stipulations: * that the church would forever remain free, * that it always be named Saint Mary the Virgin, * that no mortgage or other legal or financial encumbrance be placed on the property, and * the family retain the rights to a burial plot behind the church. In the event the diocese failed to meet any of those conditions, ownership would revert to the Clendenins or any living heirs. They are still in force today; an heir, Gabrielle and Frank's grandson, lives in Germany. Three years later, in 1919, a malfunctioning basement furnace caused a fire which did significant damage to the interior. In its aftermath several changes were made. Large screens and a baldachin which had closed off the transepts were never replaced. Instead a large pulpit was installed, with altar rails and prayer stalls lining the sanctuary. A carillon, dedicated to the memory of Alfred Smith Holland, a railroad executive close to the Clendenins, was added to the tower in 1924. alt=Several gravestones between buttresses against a stone wall. The one in the right is taller, narrow with some ornate decoration and a red area near the bottom. The others are small crosses Frank Clendenin had retired from St. Peter's in 1917. Gabrielle Clendenin Stahl, another daughter, died three years later, in 1920. The family continued to worship at the church they had built through their deaths in the 1930s. The Clendenins and all four of their children are buried in the small plot they arranged for, per their stipulations with the diocese. Sometime later in that decade, the pulpit installed after the 1919 fire was removed. In 1938 the church's women's auxiliary organized the first Strawberry Festival. It has been held ever since, featuring many events for children, including rides and walks through the paths of Greeley Grove. The following year it organized a social event for adults that also became an annual tradition, the Black Tie Dance. In 1943, the church was incorporated as a parish; the following year it was admitted into the diocese. The new parish took over the diocese's title to the property in 1949, with the Clendenins' stipulations remaining in effect. As the only Episcopal church in Chappaqua, Saint Mary's needed to be able to serve the needs of its new parish. Construction began on the parish hall in the 1950s. The first floor was done in 1951 and the entire building was complete three years later. In 1955 a baptistry, copied from the original in Monken Hadley and made in England, was installed. The church building remained unchanged, save for a replacement organ in the mid-1960s, until 1982. Renovations to the sanctuary that year removed the altar rails and prayer stalls installed after the fire over 60 years earlier. The masonry altar and altar stone were replaced with a freestanding altar and moved to the outdoors, where they were placed on the hillside. Programs and services On Sunday mornings the church offers two services. The Holy Eucharist is performed using Rite I at the earlier time, and Rite II at the later. An extensive lay ministry assists the pastor, currently Father Joel Mason, with the ceremonies. The church also has an extensive music program. A senior choir of adults performs at the later morning service every week, daily during Holy Week and four times a year during Evensong services. Its repertoire is mainly focused on traditional Anglican music, but also includes more modern work by Igor Stravinsky and John Tavener. The children's choir sings at services once a month. The religious music is supplemented by Ars Antiqua secular performances held three times a year at the church. Every June, the church holds its annual Strawberry Festival, considered the longest-running community event of its kind in Westchester County, attracting visitors from all over the county. The main attraction is food prepared by the church's members based around the titular fruit, such as strawberry shortcake, strawberry pancakes, chocolate-coivered strawberries and strawberry smoothies. Other traditional summertime festival fare, such as ice cream donated by Ben & Jerry's, hot dogs, hamburgers, popcorn and cotton candy, is also available. Craft vendors sell hand-made textile and wooden items. There are also attractions for children like bouncy houses, pony rides in the Grove, and face painting. Money raised by the festival goes to support the church's involvement in local charitable programs like food pantries. While not affiliated with the church, Chappaqua's popular farmer's market is held in the parish house during the winter months.

Overview As one of the earliest interdisciplinary arts programs in the United States, it was an incubator for new approaches towards art-making that has shaped the development of arts professionals for over thirty-three years. Guided by the principle that interdisciplinarity \\"is a defining characteristic of contemporary art practice\\" and \\"a necessary prerequisite for those artists who will shape the future of creative practice\\", the artists who work in the Interdisciplinary Arts department investigate new terrain. Examining concepts, forms and techniques from across the fine, performing and media arts, students work with a diverse array of unique and experimental approaches that interrogate artist books, installations, gesture and movement, sound art, durational performance, interactive media, video, performance media, papermaking, letterpress, etching and offset printing, electronically controlled artworks, online artwork, performance in artificial spaces, democratic multiples, written, spoken and performed text, dramatic forms, DIY/DIT collaborative strategies and relational art forms. History Interdisciplinary Arts was formulated in Chicago in 1976, by Suzanne Cohan- Lange, Jean Unsworth, and Rebecca Ruben. Originally accepted by the Chicago Consortium of Colleges as a program taught across several universities, in 1981, it was established as a department with a permanent home at Columbia College Chicago.Columbia College Oral History Project, \\"Columbia College Oral History Project\\", Retrieved 9 November 2009. At that time, the Interdisciplinary Arts MA program was formalized within the context of the department. Since then, two MFA degrees were added: the Interdisciplinary Book & Paper Arts MFA, launched in 1994; and the Interdisciplinary Arts & Media MFA, launched in 2002. The founding of the Interdisciplinary Arts program is preceded by the undergraduate program in the Studio for Interrelated Media program founded by Harris Barron in 1969 at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston. Programs The Interdisciplinary Arts MA is for art teachers who want to expand their repertoire of techniques, as well as assist practicing artists in expanding their practice to include new media. It is immersed in the five traditional art media that make up the heart of the program: visual art, movement, sound, writing, and drama. The Interdisciplinary Book & Paper Arts MFA program enables students to participate in the contemporary art world by encouraging them to consider book and paper as a site for interdisciplinary practice. It promotes the understanding of hand papermaking and the book arts as artistic media with applications in cultural discourse, community building, and collaborative practice. The Interdisciplinary Arts & Media MFA fosters an innovative dialog between the fine, performing and media arts. It is a graduate program for traditional and performing artists who want to incorporate media into their artistic practice and for media artists who want to expand into areas such as performance, installation, interactive, and relational art forms. Facilities In the 916 S. Wabash building are housed the departmental offices, faculty offices, conference room, lecture hall, two smart classrooms, large computer lab, three installation labs and the media equipment center. Additionally, the Center for Book and Paper Arts is part of the Interdisciplinary Arts department. The Center for Book and Paper Arts occupies the entire second floor of the historic Ludington Building at 1104 South Wabash and includes a papermaking studio, a letterpress facility, a bookbindery, a gallery, a smart classroom, a multi-purpose space for performance and lectures, a computer laboratory, a critique room, studio space for artists, a resource room, and offices for the staff. Also at 1104 South Wabash are studio spaces for MFA students.

It was designed by architect Richard M. Upjohn (1828 ‚Äì 1903) and built in 1883 in an eclectic Victorian Gothic Revival style. It was built in four phases: The original 1883 chapel, the 1901 addition, the addition in 1953 of a ground floor meeting room, and an enlargement and remodeling of the 1953 addition in 1990. The original chapel and 1901 addition are built of random-coursed, rock faced ashlar with corner buttresses, and high pitched gable roof with low parapets. The chapel is cruciform in plan and features a three-story bell tower with large segmental arched opening and a conical roof. A large three-part stained glass window and smaller three part windows in the two transepts are attributed to John La Farge (1835 ‚Äì 1910) and installed around 1883. It was originally built by the family of pump manufacturer Henry Rossiter Worthington (1817-1880) as a chapel and crypt. See also: It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.
