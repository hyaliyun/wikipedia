Keeley, a professor of archaeology at the University of Illinois at Chicago who specializes in prehistoric Europe. The book deals with warfare conducted throughout human history by societies with little technology. In the book, Keeley aims to stop the apparent trend in seeing modern civilization as bad, by setting out to prove that prehistoric societies were often violent and engaged in frequent warfare that was highly destructive to the cultures involved.Helms, M. W. (1999). War before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage/Blood Rites: Origins and History of the Passions of War. Journal of World History, 10(2), 431. Summary J√≠varo, Yanomamo, Mae Enga, Dugum Dani, Murngin, Huli, Gebusi) with Europe and the US in the 20th century. The chart is based on War before Civilization. Keeley conducts an investigation of the archaeological evidence for prehistoric violence, including murder and massacre as well as war. He also looks at nonstate societies of more recent times ‚Äî where we can name the tribes and peoples ‚Äî and their propensity for warfare. It has long been known, for example, that many tribes of South America's tropical forest engaged in frequent warfare. Keeley says peaceful societies are an exception. About 90-95% of known societies engage in war. Those that did not are almost universally either isolated nomadic groups (for whom flight is an option), groups of defeated refugees, or small enclaves under the protection of a larger modern state. The attrition rate of numerous close-quarter clashes, which characterize warfare in tribal warrior society, produces casualty rates of up to 60%, compared to 1% of the combatants as is typical in modern warfare. Despite the undeniable carnage and effectiveness of modern warfare, the evidence shows that tribal warfare is on average 20 times more deadly than 20th-century warfare, whether calculated as a percentage of total deaths due to war or as average deaths per year from war as a percentage of the total population. \\"Had the same casualty rate been suffered by the population of the twentieth century,\\" writes Nicholas Wade, \\"its war deaths would have totaled two billion people.\\" In modern tribal societies, death rates from war are four to six times the highest death rates in 20th-century Germany or Russia. One half of the people found in a mesolithic cemetery in present-day Jebel Sahaba, Sudan dating to as early as 13,000 years ago had died as a result of warfare between seemingly different racial groups with victims bearing marks of being killed by arrow heads, spears and club, prompting some to call it the first race war. The Yellowknives tribe in Canada was effectively obliterated by massacres committed by Dogrib Indians, and disappeared from history shortly thereafter.See pp. 67-69 of the 1996 Oxford University Press edition of War Before Civilization Similar massacres occurred among the Eskimos, the Crow Indians, and countless others. These mass killings occurred well before any contact with the West. In Arnhem Land in northern Australia, a study of warfare among the Australian Aboriginal Murngin people in the late-19th century found that over a 20-year period no less than 200 out of 800 men, or 25% of all adult males, had been killed in intertribal warfare.See pp. 118-119 of the 1996 Oxford University Press edition of War Before Civilization The accounts of missionaries to the area in the borderlands between Brazil and Venezuela have recounted constant infighting in the Yanomami tribes for women or prestige, and evidence of continuous warfare for the enslavement of neighboring tribes such as the Macu before the arrival of European settlers and government. More than a third of the Yanomamo males, on average, died from warfare. According to Keeley, among the indigenous peoples of the Americas, only 13% did not engage in wars with their neighbors at least once per year. The natives' pre-Columbian ancient practice of using human scalps as trophies is well documented. Iroquois routinely slowly tortured to death captured enemy warriors (see Captives in American Indian Wars for details). In some regions of the American Southwest, the violent destruction of prehistoric settlements is well documented and during some periods was even common. For example, the large pueblo at Sand Canyon in Colorado, although protected by a defensive wall, was almost entirely burned, artifacts in the rooms had been deliberately smashed, and bodies of some victims were left lying on the floors. After this catastrophe in the late thirteenth century, the pueblo was never reoccupied. For example, at the Crow Creek massacre site (in the territory of the Crow Creek Reservation in South Dakota), archaeologists found a mass grave containing the remains of more than 500 men, women, and children who had been slaughtered, scalped, and mutilated during an attack on their village a century and a half before Columbus's arrival (ca. 1325 AD). The Crow Creek massacre seems to have occurred just when the village's fortifications were being rebuilt. All the houses were burned, and most of the inhabitants were murdered. This death toll represented more than 60% of the village's population, estimated from the number of houses to have been about 800. The survivors appear to have been primarily young women, as their skeletons are underrepresented among the bones; if so, they were probably taken away as captives. Certainly, the site was deserted for some time after the attack because the bodies evidently remained exposed to scavenging animals for a few weeks before burial. In other words, this whole village was annihilated in a single attack and never reoccupied.http://www.usd.edu/anth/crow/crow1.html Chapter 5, compares civilized soldiers with primitive warriors. Keeley observes that tactical methods by civilized soldiers were not very good and that primitive methods were actually better. Indigenous groups in many areas of the world successfully defended and defeated multiple European colonization campaigns for decades due to primitive unorthodox warfare techniques like smaller mobile units, using small arms as opposed to artillery, open formations, frequent uses of ambushes and raids, surprise attacks, destruction of infrastructure (e.g. villages, habitations, foodstores, livestock, means of transportation), extensive uses of scouts. European conquests were greatly helped by ecological changes like diseases, viruses, and bacteria in defeating many indigenous groups since such conditions eliminated more indigenous people than did any armed conflict. The defeat of the Inca and the Aztecs are examples. Sometimes, primitive groups had better military foresight than civilized counterparts. Keeley relates an incident in which an Eipo tribal leader of highland Irian (in Western New Guinea) quickly thought of -- and wanted to immediately use -- aerial bombardment of enemies shortly after seeing an airplane for the first time. Keeley says the Western developers of planes took years to develop similar ideas. Many primitive techniques are preserved in modern times as guerrilla warfare. He makes three conclusions which the New York Times considers unexpected: *that the most important part of any society, even the most war-like ones, are the peaceful aspects such as art *that neither frequency nor intensity of war is correlated with population density *that societies frequently trading with one another fight more wars with one another Reception The New York Times said that \\"the book's most dramatic payoff is its concluding explanation for the recent \\"pacification of the past\\" by scholars\\" and that \\"...revulsion with the excesses of World War II has led to a loss of faith in progress and Western civilization....\\". American political scientist Eliot A. Cohen described the book as \\"At once scholarly and lucid, he paints a dark picture of human nature, although he does not believe humankind is doomed to a perpetual striving for mutual extinction. A sobering, grim, and important book.\\" Anthropologist R. Brian Ferguson gave a mostly positive review but argued that Keeley overstated the commonality of ancient warfare and that aversion by academics to the existence of pre-historical warfare was misrepresented.Ferguson, R. B. (1997). War before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage. American Anthropologist, 99(2), 424-425.

Almost 20 years later, the Chemins de fer de Paris √† Lyon et √† la M√©diterran√©e (PLM) opened an office at 179 Piccadilly, London. In 1937 France nationalised its rail network and the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Chemins de Fer Fran√ßais (SNCF) was created by the merger of the state railway company with five other principal operators. SNCF created French Railways, incorporating the UK operations of its predecessors. In 1995 French Railways opened a larger public call centre in Leake Street (near Waterloo station) in London, and two years later acquired British Rail International. SNCF subsequently merged French Railways and British Rail International to form Rail Europe Limited. In 2002 Rail Europe merged its head office operations from Piccadilly and the call centre from Leake Street into new premises in Kings Hill, Kent, and in December 2007 the travel centre in Piccadilly moved to new premises shared with VisitBritain at British Columbia House in Regent Street, London.

Rail Europe Chartered Operations French Motorail Service in Marseille French Motorail loaded with cars in Calais As well as selling and distributing tickets for SNCF and other European railways, until 2009 Rail Europe organised two chartered rail services in France. Operated by SNCF using standard French rolling stock, both services were aimed at the UK market and staffed by both French personnel (driver and guard) and English-speaking Rail Europe representatives (\\"Rail Travel Supervisors\\"). The Rail Europe Snowtrain This chartered service operated between December or January and April to transport passengers directly to the ski resorts of the French Alps. The journey took place in two stages; the Eurostar on a Friday from London or Ashford International to Paris, followed by a transfer to an overnight sleeper service composed of 10 Vu-84 Corail coaches with sleeping accommodation consisting of six berth \\"couchette\\" compartments. The train included a Bar/Disco coach, with disco lighting and DJ booth. This overnight service called at Chamb√©ry, Albertville, Aime la Plagne and Landry, terminating at Bourg St Maurice early Saturday morning. The return service departed from Bourg St Maurice on Saturday evenings, with passengers arriving by Eurostar in London or Ashford on Sunday morning. The Rail Europe Snowtrain was suspended in 2009 due to economic uncertainty.Snow Train statement by Rail Europe Snow Carbon July 2009 British skiers wishing to travel by train to the French Alps during the winter can now instead take the Eurostar to Paris and change for high-speed or overnight services to stations like Chamonix, Bourg St Maurice, Brian√ßon, Mo√ªtiers and Meg√®ve. Eurostar also runs Direct Ski services during the ski season, calling at Mo√ªtiers, Bourg St Maurice and Aime-la-Plagne, stations which serve ski resorts including Courchevel, Les Arcs, Tignes, M√©ribel, Aime la Plagne and Val d'Is√®re. French Motorail Motorail services carry cars and motorbikes using car transporters attached to the train. Operating from May to September, Rail Europe's French Motorail service was aimed at travellers wishing to take their cars to the South of France and onwards with a minimum amount of driving. The train departed from Calais several times every week during the summer months, terminating at Nice (calling at Avignon and Frejus) and Narbonne (calling at Brive la Gaillarde and Toulouse.) The service was cancelled in 2009 due to economic uncertainty. Those wishing to take their cars to France can now drive to Paris and pick up an 'Auto-Train' service, whereby cars are transported on overnight trains to Avignon, Bordeaux, Brive la Gaillarde, Fr√©jus/St Rapha√´l, Lyon, Marseille, Narbonne, Nice, Toulon and Toulouse. Unlike on the Motorail service, passengers may then either travel on the same route with a Lun√©a sleeping-car ticket or on a different train such as a daytime TGV. Rail Europe 4A Created in 1995, Rail Europe 4A is a joint venture between SNCF and Swiss Federal Railways. The head office of Rail Europe 4A is located in Paris. The company has several local offices and General Sales Agents in Asia, Australasia, Africa and South America. Rail Europe 4A is a leading distributor of point to point tickets and rail passes. In 2012, Rail Europe 4A launched the Rail Europe Connexion , a magazine and website for inspirational trips in Europe. Rail Europe Continentale This wholly owned subsidiary of the French Railways is responsible for the marketing and distribution of French domestic and international rail products in continental Europe. Rail Europe Continentale has its headquarters in Brussels and offices in Cologne, Milan, Geneva and Madrid. Criticisms Outages The website saw several outages in its history, which were criticized by French medias. Anti- competitive behavior On 5 February 2009, SNCF was fined ‚Ç¨ 5 million by the French Conseil de la concurrence for \\"giving a preferential treatment to its subsidiary voyages-sncf.com, created with the American online travel agency Expedia\\".

Biography  John Douglas Gamley was born on 13 September 1924 in Melbourne to John McKenzie Gamley and his wife, Helen \\"Nellie\\" (nee Patrick). Note: Contains entries for both birth notice for John Douglass Gamley, and death notice for Helen \\"Nellie\\" Gamley (nee Patrick). Less than a fortnight later, Nellie died on 26 September 1924. One of Gamley's early teachers was Waldemar Seidel in Melbourne. In September 1944 Gamley appeared as a solo pianist with the ABC Symphony Orchestra at the Melbourne Town Hall. His performance was described by The Argus reviewer: he \\"showed brilliance\\" including his effort on \\"Liszt's A major concerto (No 2) [which] had an assured technique, but can still go a long way before his powers as an interpreter of his composer are fully used.\\" In November of that year, as a student at the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music, he played piano alongside Ann Molan on violin for C√©sar Franck's Violin Sonata and √âdouard Lalo's Symphonie espagnole. Gamley was particularly influenced by Modest Mussorgsky, creating a full orchestral version of his Pictures at an Exhibition, and adapting his Night on Bald Mountain for his score for the horror feature film Asylum (1972). David Nice reviewed \\"The Bogatyr (Heroes') Gate at Kiev\\" from Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and felt that \\"few have gone quite as far as the brilliant Australian-born arranger and film-score composer [Gamley]\\", and that he provided \\"a happier meeting\\" with Mussorgsky's work than that in Asylum. Gamley adapted Gabriel Faur√©'s Pavane for The Monster Club (1980). Gamley worked as an accompanist with guest conductor Michael Moores on a recording of the Elston Hall Choir singing Sacred and Secular Music. It is assumed the recording was made available on a very-limited vinyl release in 1967 bearing the catalogue number \\"E.H. 67-3\\". One 33 1/3 rpm mono example of the record, made in England, is known to exist. The recording features on side one: 1. O Esca Viatorum (Philips), 2. I Waited for the Lord (Mendelssohn), 3. The Lord's My Shepherd (Bain), 4. Rejoice Greatly (Handel); and on side two: 1. Bald prangt, den Morgen zu verk√ºnden (Mozart), 2. Spinning Chorus (Wagner), 3. Non lo dir√≤ col labbro (Handel), 4. Nymphs and Shepherds (Purcell).Sacred and Secular Music details, 1borneveryminute.com According to AllMusic's Bruce Elder, Gamley wrote \\"'stock music' for the BBC library\\" including for the Doctor Who TV series; he also wrote for the soundtrack of the Disney feature film, Tron (1982). Douglas Gamley died on 5 February 1998 in Highgate, London.

Kaserne is a German loanword that means \\"barracks.\\" It was a United States military base 1945-1994\\\\. Since then it is a German base, most of which has closed. The base still has some US military operations and German military storage.  Location  It is at the Northern edge of the city of Pirmasens, approximately from the French border. It is bordered on the east by the Bundesstra√üe 270 and the west by Landesstra√üe 482.  Construction  Originally built in place of an apple orchard, the Husterhoeh Kaserne covered a large plateau to the North of the city of Pirmasens, as well having an extremely large system of caves and tunnels that ran to adjacent townships. The facility was initially started by the Germans during the 1930s; above- ground facilities were built to house Wehrmacht soldiers manning the Siegfried Line along the French border and included tunneling extensive underground facilities. Work was stopped in 1941 due to the war needs for personnel and resumed minorly in 1944. The facility was captured on 21 March 1945 by the 71st Infantry Division, used as a war materials storage center, then was expanded by additional construction from the late 1950s through mid 1970s; in 1976 it was officially created as a full army base of its own right (US Military Community, Pirmasens). The last construction under US Military control was construction of replacement motor pool facilities for the 59th MP Co, in 1986-1987 and a new Electronic Equipment repair facility on the Kaserne and an underground Circuit Card repair facility in one of the tunnels originally constructed by the German Army. Since return to German control of the majority of the base, additional construction, removal and modification of existing buildings has occurred. Current use Most of the facility is now used as commercial property, with multiple car dealerships and commercial companies on the site. The city has also located a major soccer stadium on the site. The US Army Medical Materiel Center - Europe (USAMMCE) is still operational and continues to occupy its former location. The heliport landing strip has been removed and is a grass field; numerous other buildings have been removed or re-engineered for other uses including the former US Army fire station (removed), the motorpool buildings to the north of the 76th Transportation Company (Medium Truck)'s motorpool (removed), etc. The buildings, which have neither been re-inhabited/re-used nor demolished, are in very poor condition (source: personal visits, 1999, 2005, 2008). The curved \\"Banana\\" Building has been modified with a museum and related entrance at the center, the entrance of which now faces outwards. The POMCUS storage facilities are now used by the German military for POMCUS storage. The American street names have been retained.

A small unit, specializing in convoy escort, was also stationed at the kaserne, though for a brief period. It was the 511th MP platoon, housed in a 2-story building well to the rear of the facility. The unit guided, managed traffic control and served as a lightly armed escort for convoys carrying exotic weapons and their parts throughout Germany. Later (not sure of dates) the unit was transferred to Ma√üweiler, then disbanded and the unit's members were portioned out as security guards at Dahn and Fischbach. The unit also served as OPFOR (then called something \\"aggressors\\" or something like that) for ordnance units when they went to the field. The US Army's 636th Ordnance Company (EOD) (with a housing base at Muenchweiler) guarded and maintained the then classified stocks of GB and VX nerve gas located at Site 59 in Clausen. This unit became the 330th Ordnance Company, 110th MP Company, 763rd Medical Det., and 98th Chemical Det. The nerve agents at Site 59, were removed under Operation Steel Box in 1990. These agents were transported by truck, rail and ship ultimately ending up at Johnston Atoll for incineration at the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System facility.

It tells of the destruction of the fianna and the deaths of most of its warriors in a battle against the forces of High King Cairbre Lifechair. It is notable for depicting the fianna, the heroes of the cycle, in a negative light.MacKillop, p. 78. Cath Gabhra exists in many versions, and is referenced often in other works, including poems about Cairbre Lifechair in the Book of Leinster and in the long narrative Acallam na Sen√≥rach. Cairbre's daughter Sgiam Sholais is betrothed to Maolsheachlainn, prince of the D√©isi, whose father Oengus has been killed by Cairbre's sons F√≠acha Sroiptine and Eochaid Doimlen. However, the fianna and Fionn mac Cumhaill demand a large tribute for the marriage, and Cairbre decides their power has corrupted them. He raises a vast army from Ulster, Leinster, and Connacht, which is joined by the faction of the fianna loyal to Fionn's enemy Goll mac Morna. Fionn and the fianna are aided by the men of Munster and the D√©isi. Cairbre starts the final battle by killing Fionn's servant Ferdia, and the armies meet at Gabhair for the final confrontation. The fianna's greatest warrior, Fionn's grandson Oscar (the son of Ois√≠n), slays Cairbre, but dies of his wounds, thereby sealing the fianna's fate. In some versions, Fionn himself is slain by Aichlech while he weeps over the death of his grandson. Cairbre's forces ultimately triumph, and the only survivors of the fianna are Ois√≠n and Ca√≠lte mac R√≥n√°in, who live long enough to recount their tale to Saint Patrick two centuries later, according to Acallam na Sen√≥rach. The location of the battle varies from text to text.

He was heavily influenced by the liberal theology of Anton G√ºnther. Life In 1801 he took the philosophical course at the University of Prague, and later studied medicine. In 1808 he obtained a degree in medicine at Vienna; in a short time he was professor and then director of the school of veterinary medicine. He wrote poetry, and a play of his was acted in one of the theatres of Vienna. He also published a compendium in two volumes of veterinary surgery, and an outline of botanical medicine. In 1816 he became a Christian convert, and in 1817 began the study of theology. He also became a personal friend of Father Hofbauer, was his physician, and was urged by him to devote himself to preaching, after ordination. Veith was ordained, 26 August 1821, and the next month joined the Redemptorists at Maria Stiegen. He was a Redemptorist preacher at Maria Stiegen, 1821‚Äì30; preacher at the Cathedral of St. Stephen, 1831‚Äì45; retired cathedral preacher, until his total blindness, 1845‚Äì63; finally, a writer of ascetic devotional works until his death. Veith was buried in the Matzleinsdorf Protestant Cemetery of Vienna. Works His sermons exist in manuscript up to 1825; their publication began with: *\\"Die Leidenswerkzeuge Christi\\" (1826); *\\"Die Worte der Feinde Christi\\" (1827); *\\"Das Friedensopfer\\" (1828); *\\"Lebensbilder aus der Passionsgeschichte\\" (1829); *\\"Das Vater Unser\\" (1830); *\\"Die heiligen Berge\\" (1821); *\\"Der verlorne Sohn\\" (1832); *\\"Die Samaritin\\" (1833); *\\"Die Erweckung des Lazarus\\" (1842); *\\"Mater dolorosa\\" (1843); *\\"Die Heilung des Blindgeborenen\\" (1844); *\\"Eucharistia\\" (1846); *\\"Die S√§ulen der Kirche\\" (1847); *\\"Misericordia\\" (1848); *\\"Politische Passionspredigten\\" (1849); *\\"Weitleben und Christentum\\" (1850); *\\"Charitas\\" (1851); *\\"Der Weg, die Wahrheit, und das Leben\\" (1854); *\\"Prophetie und Glaube\\" (1855); *\\"Die sechs Fastensonntage nach ihren Kalendernamen\\" (1857); *\\"Die Perikopen-Reihen der sechs Fastwochen\\" (1858); *\\"Die M√§chten des Unheils\\" (1859); *\\"Die zw√∂lf Stufenpsalmen\\" (1862); *\\"Die Anfange der Menschenweit\\" (1863).

Moreover, the increase of number of teams in Copa Libertadores also triggered some changes. could also participate in next year's Copa Libertadores. In 1967, the qualifying criteria were changed. Winning the Metropolitano did not gain eligibility in the Copa Libertadores. Instead, from 1967 to 1970, the champion and runner-up in the Nacional would be eligible to take part in the Copa Libertadores of the next year. In 1971, the winner of the Nacional qualified to the Copa Libertadores directly. The winner of the Metropolitano regained the chance of qualification, as the Metropolitano champion would play against the runner-up of the Nacional in a Pre Libertadores Tournament to determine the allocation of the second spot in Copa Libertadores. The Metropolitano champion Independiente won San Loranzo 1‚Äì0 in the tournament.Argentina 1971 In 1972, the qualifying method was changed back to the system of 1968‚Äì70. The winner and runner-up of the Nacional, San Loranzo and River Plate respectively, represented Argentina to play in the Copa Libertadores 1973.Argentina 1972 In 1973, the champion of the Metropolitano and Nacional qualified to 1974 Copa Libertadores directly. Hurac√°n and Rosario Central qualified by winner each tournament respectively.Argentina 1973 In 1974, a Pre Libertadores Tournament was held to determine the qualifying teams. The tournament was contested by Rosario Central, as the runner-up of both Metropolitano and Nacional, Newell's Old Boys, as the champion of Metropolitano and San Lorenzo, as the champion of Nacional.Argentina 1974 The tournament was held in a single round-robin format. Rosario Central and Newell's Old Boys, the first two teams in the table, qualified to Copa Libertadores 1975. Starting from 1975, the qualifying method of 1967 was re-adopted. The winner of the Metropolitano and Nacional would automatically qualify to participate the Copa Libertadores in the following year. When the same team had won both tournaments, a Pre- Libertadores Tournament played by the runners-up of each tournament was held to determine the qualification. This scenario happened three times, namely in 1975,Argentina 1975 1976Argentina 1976 and 1979.Argentina 1979 In 1975 and 1976, a single-legged match was played, while in 1979, the tournament was contested in two legs. In 1985, only the Nacional was held. The Metropolitano was not held, paving the way for the new European style seasons. The champion of Nacional 1985 and the new tournament 1985-86 would qualify to the Copa Libertadores 1986. Argentinos Juniors won the Nacional 1985, so it gained the eligibility for the 1986 edition. However, it also won the 1985 edition, and thus qualified to next season's tournament automatically, along with River Plate, who won the 1985-86 title. Therefore, the runner-up of the 1985 Nacional, V√©lez S√°rsfield, qualified for a Liguilla Pre-Libertadores tournament with the second to seventh-placed teams from the new double round- robin domestic 1985-96 league (together with 6 provincial qualifiers), to compete for the remaining qualification, and this tournament was won by Boca Juniors.Argentina 1985/86  Liguilla Pre-Libertadores  From 1986 to 1990, the champion of the Primera Divisi√≥n earned a place directly, whilst a Liguilla Pre-Libertadores tournament was held every year to determine the second qualifying team. Eight teams participated in the Pre-Libertadores tournament, and it was competed under a two-legged knock-out format with the winner qualifying to the Copa Libertadores. Teams participating in this tournament were not solely drawn from the Primera Divisi√≥n in the early years. A few teams from the Primera B Nacional, whose number varied each year, also took part in the competition. *In 1986/87, the second to sixth teams in the Primera Divisi√≥n competed in the tournament with the first three placed teams in the Nacional B. *In 1987/88, the second to eighth teams joined the competition alongside the champion of Nacional B. The winner of the Liguilla Classificaci√≥n tournament this season, which was competed by the Primera Division teams that had not qualified to the Liguilla Pre-Libertadores tournament (excepting the two relegated teams), also qualified to the Liguilla Pre-Libertadores tournament of the following year. *In 1988/89, this season qualified teams to 1989 Copa Libertadores as well as 1990 edition, as a result of the Libertadores changing format so that it was played in the first half of the calendar year. The first half of the season was regarded as a tournament in itself, named \\"Apertura\\" tournament. The top two teams after the first half of the season qualified to 1989 Copa Libertadores.Argentina 1988/89 *After the end of the overall season of 1988-89, as in previous years, the champion of the league qualified directly and a Liguilla Pre-Libertadores tournament was held to decide the second qualifying team to 1990 Copa Libertadores. The only difference was that the qualifying teams participate in Copa Libertadores of the next season instead of the same one. The second to seventh teams from the whole season tournament, as well as Platense, the champion of the Liguilla Classificaci√≥n tournament of previous season, competed in the tournament, plus the Nacional B champion. This was a double-elimination tournament and the best placed team in this season's Liguilla Classificaci√≥n tournament, which was the losers bracket of the Liguilla Pre-Libertadores tournament, got the opportunity to participate in the Liguilla Pre-Libertadores tournament in the following season. * In 1989-90, the normal method was reused except qualifications were now for the 1991 Copa Libertadores. The champion of the Primera Divisi√≥n gained direct qualification and a Liguilla Pre-Libertadores tournament was contested for the other spot. The number of teams in the Liguilla Pre-Libertadores tournament was reduced to four, with all of them coming from the Primera Divisi√≥n. The second to fourth teams in the Primera Divisi√≥n entered this tournament, as well as Deportivo Espa√±ol, the best placed team in the previous season's Liguilla Classificaci√≥n tournament.Argentina 1989/90 In the 1990-91 season, the format of Argentine football changed again. Since this season, instead of playing only one double round-robin tournament, two competitions have been held each year, namely, the Apertura and Clausura. In 1990‚Äì91, a final was played between the champions of these tournaments, to determine the ultimate winner of the season. The ultimate winner was also eligible for the Copa Libertadores, while the loser needed to play in the Liguilla Pre-Libertadores tournament to compete for qualification. In this season, the Liguilla Pre-Libertadores tournament also featured the second to fourth teams in the Apertura and the second to fifth teams in the Clausura. This practice was very controversial, especially since Boca Juniors lost the final against Newell's Old Boys, costing Boca Juniors its first official championship since 1981 despite an unbeaten run in the 1991 Clausura. As a result, in the following season, the winner of the Apertura and Clausura tournaments did not compete in a Final but both of them were crowned the champions. However, a three-legged Liguilla Pre-Libertadores tournament between the winners was contested, and the winner of the tournament would qualify directly to Copa Libertadores. The second to fifth teams in both the Apertura and Clausura entered an Octagonal tournament, which was a one-legged knock-out tournament. As the second to fifth team in the Apertura finished second, fourth, fifth and eighth in the Clausura, the sixth, seventh and ninth teams in the Clausura were eligibile to play in the Octagonal tournament. The winner of the tournament, V√©lez S√°rsfield then played against the loser of the Liguilla Pre-Libertadores tournament, Newell's Old Boys, to compete for the second spot of Copa Libertadores. Newell's Old Boys won the match 1‚Äì0.Argentina 1991/92 From 1992-93 (for 1994 Copa Libertadores), the champions of the Apertura and Clausura tournaments got the eligibility for Copa Libertadores directly. When the same team won both tournaments, as was the case in 1995/96, 1996/97 and 1998/99, the runner-up of each tournament played a one-legged play-off to decide the qualification. Since 1999, the champions of each tournament, Apertura and Clausura and the best teams in the aggregate table qualified to play the Libertadores. The number of seats for Argentine clubs increased to four in 1998-99 (for 2000 Copa Libertadores) and a new method was adopted in this season, which was used until 2007. The places of Copa Libertadores are allocated to the champions of Apertura and Clausura of the previous season, as well as the two best teams which have gained the highest number of points considering the combined table of Apertura and Clausura besides the two champions. The number of representatives increased to five in the 2003/04 season and the third team in the aggregate table also qualifies. For example, 2008 Copa Libertadores was represented by the 2006 Apertura champion Estudiantes (LP), 2007 Clausura champion San Lorenzo de Almagro, and the three best placed teams in the combined table of both tournaments. Though 2007 Apertura was held much closer to 2008 Copa Libertadores, the champion of that season cannot get the place because it was considered to be the same season of 2008 Copa Libertadores. So, champions of the Apertura have to wait for more than a year to play in the Copa Libertadores. When the same team wins both tournaments, as in 2005-06, the fourth team in the aggregate table also gets the eligibility.Final Tables Argentina 2001-2010 Moreover, since the inauguration session, the Copa Libertadores champion has qualified automatically to the following session's tournament, like Boca Juniors in 2007. However, unlike the European practice, the nation receives an extra place in the tournament to accommodate the holder. So there were six Argentine teams playing in 2008 Copa Libertadores instead of five. For the 2008 Apertura, champions and teams with best average in the last three championships were eligible to play the Cup. After employing the old method for nearly a decade, a new method was adopted in season 2007‚Äì08, qualifying for Copa Libertadores 2009. The method is transitional, as it was used to prepare for the employment of the system that would be used in the following season. In that season, the champion of Apertura 2007, Clausura 2008 and also Apertura 2008 (i.e. the champion of the first half of the next season) would gain a place in Copa Libertadores 2009. Moreover, the best two teams having the best average points in 2007 Apertura, 2008 Clausura, and 2008 Apertura would also gain a place. After the reform, the champions of Apertura could play immediately in the Copa Libertadores in the next calendar year, instead of waiting for a year in the past. This is regarded as a major improvement of the system. In the 2009-10 season, champions and teams with best average in the aggregate table in a calendar year were eligible for the tournament. Since 2009 Clausura, the champions of Clausura and Apertura in the same calendar year (though they are in different seasons) would qualify for the Copa Libertadores in the coming calendar year. The other three places would be gained by the teams with best aggregate points in the Clausura and Apertura in the same calendar year. For example, the best three non-champions teams of the aggregate table of Clausure 2009 and Apertura 2009 would gain the berths of Copa Libertadores 2010. In 2011 Copa Libertadores, the most recent Copa Sudamericana champion would earn a berth in the tournament. However, the country of the Copa Sudamericana champion would not gain an extra berth. The Copa Sudamericana champion would take the lowest-placed berth already assigned to the country if they did not qualify for the Copa Libertadores through domestic performance. Since 2010 Copa Sudamericana was won by Independiente, Independiente got the last berth and the team with the third highest point in the aggregate table lost the place. Since 2010 to 2012, the champions of each tournament and two teams with best average points in the aggregate table and the best Argentine team in Copa Sudamericana not yet qualified, were eligible to play the Copa Libertadores. The system change again in 2010. Gaining idea from the arrangement of last year, the third team in the aggregate table could not qualify for the competition. Its place was taken by the best performing Argentine team in the Copa Sudamericana in the last year. Since the league format of Divisi√≥n Argentina changed in 2013 Final, and the Copa Argentina was put into circulation again (the last edition had been played in 1969), the qualifying method was amended once more. Besides the champion of 2013 Torneo Inicial and Final, which gained a place as usual, the champion of so-called \\"Super Final\\", i.e. the winning team between the champion of 2012 Torneo Inicial and 2013 Torneo Final, would also gain a place. Furthermore, the champion of Copa Argentina would also gain a place in the following season. The best performing Argentine team in the Copa Sudamericana still retained its place. If the above places were occupied by the same team, the best team in the aggregate table, which was still not yet qualified, would gain the berth.

He is famed for a series of fine Gothic Revival churches built between about 1890 and 1917 and also restored many churches and designed church fittings. He did some work on domestic properties, and also designed memorial crosses. Life and career RMS Leinster. Temple Moore was born in Tullamore, County Offaly, Ireland, and was the son of an army officer. He was educated at Glasgow High School, then from 1872 privately by the Revd Richard Wilton in Londesborough in the East Riding of Yorkshire. In 1875, he moved to London and was articled to architect George Gilbert Scott, Jr. Although Moore set up his own practice in 1878, he continued to work closely with Scott, helping to complete his works when Scott's health deteriorated. From the early 1880s he travelled widely studying buildings on the continent, chiefly in Germany, France and Belgium. He was particularly impressed by the great medieval brick churches of north Germany, echoes of which can be found in some of his own impressively austere brick churches In 1884 he married Emma Storrs Wilton, the eldest daughter of the Revd Wilton and thus was related to Canon Horace Newton for whom he undertook church restoration work and a large house, Holmwood, Redditch, Worcestershire. Moore's pupils included Giles Gilbert Scott, son of George Gilbert Scott, Jr. In 1905 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Moore's only son, Richard (1891-1918), was articled to his father and it was expected that he would continue the practice. However he pre-deceased his father, being killed in 1918 when RMS Leinster was torpedoed and sunk off Dublin. Temple Moore's son-in-law, Leslie Thomas Moore, joined the practice during the following year. Temple Moore died at his home in Hampstead in 1920, and was buried at St John's Church, Hampstead. His estate amounted to a little over ¬£5,635 (). Leslie Moore continued the practice, completing some of Temple Moore's commissions. () Works St. Mark's Church, Mansfield, listed at Grade II* The high altar in the Church of St Mary and All Saints, Chesterfield showing the reredos designed by Temple Moore Moore's main contributions to architecture were his churches; he designed about 40 new churches, and the cathedral in Nairobi. He also restored older churches, and made alterations and additions to others. In addition he designed fittings and items of furniture for the interiors of churches. In other fields, he designed and altered country houses, and other buildings including schools, vicarages, parish halls, a court house, and memorial and churchyard crosses. He was also a contributor to English Domestic Architecture of the XVII & XVIII Centuries by Horace Field and Michael Bunney (1905). In 1908, Moore made the organ case, choir stalls, reredos and communion rail for St Michael and All Angels Church, Badminton.St. Michael and All Angels, Great Badminton (webpage), 19 July 2013. Also Moore's career spanned the closing years of the Gothic Revival, but he developed the style rather than merely continuing it. In his entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography the author states that his \\"artistic destiny was not to preserve an attenuating tradition but to bring to maturity a development which otherwise would have remained incomplete\\", and also expresses the opinion that he was \\"England's leading ecclesiastical architect from the mid-Edwardian years\\". Of his work, the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner said that he \\"is always sensitive in his designs and often interesting\\". Moore was an Anglican in the Anglo-Catholic tradition, which prefers its churches to have beautiful surroundings and fine fittings to enhance worship; Moore's designs reflect this. The National Heritage List for England shows that at least 34 of Moore's new churches are designated as listed buildings. Two of these, St Wilfrid, Harrogate, and All Saints, Stroud, are listed at Grade I, and at least 16 of the others are at Grade II*. For his secular works, Moore received praise from his contemporaries for remodelling South Hill Park in Berkshire, and for restoring the Treasurer's House and St William's College in York.

It runs for through forest and dunes areas, providing access to scenic overlooks of the Lake Michigan shoreline and the surrounding park land. Interpretive markers along the roadway are keyed to the National Park Service's printed guide to the drive. Over 80,000 vehicles make the trip, in addition to bicyclists, hikers and skiers who use the road each year. The road was built in the 1960s and finished in 1967 by Pierce Stocking. A lumberman with road-building experience, he wanted to share the beauty of the area with others. He operated the facility until his death in 1976; afterwards it was purchased by the National Park Service and added to the park. In the 1980s, a two-year program reconstructed the roadway and added a number of features for visiting tourists. In 2011, the morning show Good Morning America named the Sleeping Bear Dunes, and Pierce Stocking Drive, as the \\"Most Beautiful Place in America\\" after a viewer poll on its website; publicity since the award has increased traffic along the roadway. Route description alt=Photograph of the The road is a loop that can be driven or bicycled. Hiking the roadway is permitted, but not encouraged because of the traffic. The roadway starts at an entrance off M-109 (DH Day Highway) south of Glen Lake. There is a parking lot inside the entrance for visitors who wish to bike or hike the road. From there, the drive continues as a two-way road to the entrance gate before turning northward as a one-way road. There are 12 numbered locations along the road that are listed in the drive's interpretive brochure. The first of these is a covered bridge. After this point, the drive ascends a steep hill to an overlook of Glen Lake. The area around this location includes \\"heavily forested areas, sand plains and scrub growth among the rock outcrops\\". The next stop is the Dune Overlook and Picnic Mountain picnic area. From this vantage point, tourists can view both North and South Manitou islands, also part of the park, as well as Pyramid Point and Sleeping Bear Bay. As the drive approaches this stop and the fourth, the Cottonwood Trail, it emerges from the forest into the sandy dune area next to Lake Michigan. Several more stops are noted in the guide before Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive heads back inland through the beech and maple forest. alt=Photograph of The roadway turns back to the shore and two overlooks next to the lake. Overlook 9 is next to the bluff on Lake Michigan, above the water, and overlook 10 is for views of the Sleeping Bear Dune. From overlook 9, visitors can see Platte Bay some to the south on a clear day. These two locations are considered especially hazardous because of the heights involved. In 2002, the Detroit Free Press noted that a half-dozen visitors have to be rescued by paramedics at these two overlooks after falls. The community of Glen Arbor has a special off-road vehicle to effect rescues from the base of the cliffs. The penultimate stop along the drive is the North Bar Overlook and Picnic Area, which provides vistas of North Bar Lake. After this stop, the drive descends into maple and pine forests before coming back to the starting point. This area follows an old logging road under the forest canopy. The drive has been called \\"the best way to see Lake Michigan from top of the dune elevations\\", and \\"one of the nation's most fascinating landscapes\\". A Park Pass fee is required for using the Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive (except for Golden Age Passport/Senior Pass holders). A free interpretive guide for the scenic drive is available at the visitor center in Empire or at the entrance gate. The road is open to cars generally from the middle of April into November. During the operating season, the road is open starting at 9:00 a.m. until 30 minutes after sunset. After late December, the drive is used as a cross-country ski trail. The park service combines the unplowed roadway with the Shauger Hill Trail to form an system of trails of various ratings. The speed limit on the Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive is . In 2008, there were 82,527 vehicles that circled the drive, a 4.7% increase over the previous year. History alt=Photograph of the Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive showing a The road is named after Pierce Stocking, who spent his youth working as a Michigan lumberman and used to walk the bluffs above Lake Michigan near Empire. As a lumberman he had experience building roads. Stocking began building a road to the top of the dunes in the difficult terrain around the early 1960s. According to National Geographic, Stocking was \\"so awed by the beauty of the dunes that ... he built the road in order to share them with visitors.\\" The road was originally known as the Sleeping Bear Dunes Park when he first opened it to the public in 1967. He operated the scenic drive until his death in 1976, charging $2 per car (equivalent to $ in ) at the end. The area around the roadway became part of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore when the park was created in 1970, and the road became part of the park itself in 1977 when purchased by the park service. The name was later changed to Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive in honor of the man. alt=Photograph showing the Starting in 1984, the National Park Service reconstructed the drive. It was paved for the first time, and a bicycle lane was added. The service also moved the entrance to the road and built the observation platforms. An original section of the road was closed because it was susceptible to drifting sands from the dunes. Stocking built the covered bridge, but the \\"NPS has maintained it and increased its vertical clearance to 13 feet 6 inches [].\\" The renovations to the drive were completed in 1986. In August 2011, the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore was named by Good Morning America as the \\"Most Beautiful Place in America\\"; the designation came after a social media campaign to capitalize on the show's website poll. Since the park was awarded the title, attendance has increased. Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive, featured in the morning show's broadcast, had lines of cars waiting to get onto the drive on September 3, 2011,September 3, 2011, was the Saturday of Labor Day Weekend that year. an uncommon sight for a day in September.

Corpo d'aria (\\"Body of Air\\"; plural Corpi d'aria) is an artist's multiple by the Italian artist Piero Manzoni. Manufactured between October 1959 and March 1960, the pieces are a box, a tripod base, a deflated balloon and a mouthpiece. 45 copies were made and sold at 30,000 lire each. Originally, any buyer could ask Manzoni to inflate the balloon himself, but would be charged an extra Deutschmark for every litre of air expanded. When fully expanded, the balloons measured 80 cm in diameter.Piero Manzoni Catalogue Raison√©, Battino & Palazzoli Public presentation The Corpi d'aria were first exhibited at the Galleria Azimut, run by Manzoni and his friend, the Italian artist Enrico Castellani, from May 3 to May 9, 1960. Manzoni organised an elaborate photo shoot and a short film to publicise the event. He was to write later in the year that the bodies had sold well.Letter to Heinz Mack, quoted in Piero Manzoni Catalog Generale, vol 1, Celant, p. 84. By making a purely transient work, that would deflate before the buyer‚Äôs eyes, Manzoni was parodying the traditional sculptural emphasis on permanence and mocking the traditional emphasis on the artist‚Äôs creative force. He was also using modern materials to suggest an aggressively modern aesthetic whilst creating a poetic metaphor for the transience of life itself.  Related works Fiato d‚Äôartista The most famous related work is the Fiato d‚Äôartista (Artist‚Äôs Breath), involving red, blue or white balloons inflated by Manzoni himself, closed with string and lead, with the name \\"Piero Manzoni\\" punched into it, then attached to a wooden base with a plaque on it using gesso. The pieces were made in 1960, and 11 examples are known to have survived, although all are now in an extreme state of decomposure. When exhibited now, the works inevitably assume the aura of a modern memento mori,Manzoni at the Serpentine Gallery, London, 1998 featuring a rotting plastic membrane stuck to a polished wooden base, with a brass plaque commemorating the original act. Placentarium The largest variation on the theme was a giant double-skinned Placentarium, filled with compressed air to keep the balloon inflated. Manzoni designed especially for the projection of Otto Piene's Light Ballets, but also referred to the building housing a giant maze, made up of 60 cells controlled by \\"an electric brain\\".\\"Placentarium\\" typescript published in Piero Manzoni, Catalogo Generale, Celant, Prearo Editions Equipped with 73 alcoves for viewers, the Placentarium was intended to be silver on the outside and white internally. Designs and a photograph of a small architectural model survive.Manzoni, Celant, Electa 2007 pp. 242-245 Manzoni simultaneously planned a series of public sculptures, of balloons 2.5 m diameter, to be installed in parks. These were to be fitted with air compressor to slowly pulsate ‚Äòwith a slow unsynchronized rhythm of breathing.‚Äô He never took this idea further than a small experimental version. The final experiment was for a sphere held suspended by a jet of air. Again, this never advanced beyond a small experimental maquette, but emphasises Manzoni‚Äôs conception of balloons representing freedom and weightlessness.  Influences  Manzoni is known to have been heavily influenced by Yves Klein,Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p82 who had released 1001 blue balloons on the opening night of his \\"Proposition: Monochrome\\" exhibition at Iris Clert‚Äôs gallery, 1957.Yves Klein, Weitemeier, Taschen 2001, p. 20 Andy Warhol would later use balloons in a similar way, but filled with helium rather than suspended in a stream of compressed air. Indeed, his first balloon, made in 1965, corresponded to an unfulfilled project described by Manzoni in a letter as ‚Äòa cluster of pneumatic cylinders, elongated in shape, like steel, which would vibrate in the blowing of the wind.‚ÄôPaintings & Sculptures, The Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonne 02B, Phaidon, p. 222 Damien Hirst has used ping pong balls suspended in compressed air, but within the context of floating above a bed of sharp knives or a skeleton. His most lasting influence, however, was on Arte Povera, a group of Italian artists, including Luciano Fabro and Alighiero e Boetti, who brought everyday materials into their work in a movement analogous to contemporary radical politics.

History 1978-1983 Demob formed in late 1978 by guitarist Terry Elcock and drummer Johnny Melfah, and they were soon joined by Mike Howes (vocals), Tony Wakefield (bass) and Chris Rush (guitar). Howes ex-army skinhead friend Andy Kanonik soon joined, also on vocals. It was this line-up that first rehearsed and played the first gigs in and around Gloucester, the Viking youth club becoming the main place of rehearsals and Tracy's night club was the first venue that Demob played in 1978, and became the local night club hangout for all the band and punks at that time. Elcock had previous experience on guitar as a member of a church band. Demob's first big break came in the summer of 1979 when they fooled the authorities into letting them have a place in the Gloucester annual carnival parade. The ever-increasing support for the band resulted in a mass riot between the punks and the bikers and, ultimately, the suspension of the carnival. The riot made national press and attracted the interest of the local record label, Round Ear Records.\\"Twenty years on and Demob re-form - but have they reformed?\\", BBC Gloucester, In 1980, Howes was sacked from the band, and Kanonik was imprisoned for three months, leaving the band without a singer. The band had just recruited Mark \\"Miff\\" Smith to replace Rush, and he took over the role of singer, with Paul \\"Fatty\\" Price also replacing Wakefield on bass. Smith soon become an integral part, arranging and organizing gigs. With the line-up now comprising Mark Smith (vocals), Terry Elcock (guitar), Paul Price & Barry Philips (bass guitar), and Johnny Melfah (drums), the band worked on their first recordings. \\"Anti- Police\\" was Demob's first release on the independent Round Ear Records, the record supported by the late John Peel, and journalist Garry Bushell. The record spent over two months in the UK Indie Chart, peaking at number 34. On the back of the success of \\"Anti-Police\\", Demob supported many acts around the punk circuit at this time, including U2, UK Subs, The Angelic Upstarts, Discharge and The Beat. Most performances ended with a police presence and inevitable violence with their notorious hardcore followers, the 'Demob Riot Squad'. The band's multi-racial line-up sometimes attracted hostility from Nazi skinheads who attended their gigs, and the band would play several concerts in aid of the Anti-Nazi League. A second single, \\"No Room For You\\" quickly followed to add to the success, but like so many punk acts of the era, musical differences soon developed amongst the line-up and Demob split to pursue other musical avenues in 1983.[ Harris, Craig, \\"Demob - Biography\\"], AllMusic Re-formation Since 1983, some of the band members had gone on to other bands, while others had given up on music. Melfah had some success as a boxer and opened a boxing gym in Gloucester. Smith formed a new band called Garrison Damn. Elcock had played with several bands, including Kiss The Blade. Spurred on by interest from American label Grand Theft Audio in re-releasing the old material, in 2001 Elcock reformed Demob with a revised line-up to tour the United States, Japan and Europe. The revised line-up consisted of Terry Elcock (guitar), Andrew Kanonik (vocals), Richard Baldwin (bass), and Timothy Howkins (drums). They were involved in recording * below. This line-up split, but in 2005, Elcock and Kanonik reformed the band again with Natalie Porter (bass) and Marcus Harley (drums), Porter soon replaced by the returning Baldwin,. In 2006, a US tour was planned, but fell apart due to the line-up's curious business practices, well-documented by tour manager Brian GTA and booker Mish Bondage. In October 2007, the band split with Elcock leaving. Kanonik and Baldwin formed a new line-up which continued as Demob for one gig. Kanonik used various session musicians for a short while after. Elcock described them as a 'tribute act', pointing out that the band now contains none of the original Demob line-up. Kanonik and Harley went on to form the Noise Agents in 2009. In 2011, Demob again went through another change in line-up with Elcock returning and the introduction of Steve Zuki on bass, this current line-up continues to play regularly on the punk scene.

After studying at Eton College and Cambridge University, he was ordained as a priest in 1877, and was a curate at St Mary's in Reading. He later served as vicar in Eccles, before being appointed as the third Suffragan Bishop of Southampton. He gave and published a number of lectures relating to his faith, and was the Hulsean Lecturer in 1891. He was also one of eleven members of the Lyttelton family to play first-class cricket. After a short time as a tutor at Keble College, Oxford, he became the first Master of Selwyn College, Cambridge. Early life and education Arthur Lyttelton was born in Westminster, London, on 12 June 1847, the fifth son of George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton and his first wife Mary Glynne. He attended Eton College, followed by Trinity College, Cambridge from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1874. He was awarded his MA degree in 1877. School and university cricket Lyttelton played a match for the \\"Gentlemen of Worcestershire\\" in 1866, when he was 14, playing alongside two of his older brothers, Charles and George. The Lyttelton family was closely associated with cricket in Worcestershire, and most of the family appeared for the county at some time. He played for Eton in his final year at the school, and appeared in the annual fixture against Harrow that year, his performance being of little note. Eton won the match by 21 runs, in which Lyttelton scored two runs in the first innings and remained not out with five runs in the second. He batted at number ten in both innings, and did not bowl. He suffered a pair during a match between Worcestershire and Herefordshire in 1871. During his time at Cambridge University, Lyttelton frequently appeared for the \\"Quidnuncs\\", a cricket club generally populated by former university cricketers who had earnt a blue. Lyttelton (centre of back row) in 1873, Shakespeare Society, Trinity College, Cambridge He never played first-class cricket for the university, but did appear against them in one match in 1872; his only first-class appearance. Lyttelton was part of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team which played the university at Lord's Cricket Ground in June that year. He batted at number seven, and after scoring a duck in the first innings, he scored four runs in the second of a low-scoring match in which only W. G. Grace passed 50 runs in an innings. He made a second appearance for the MCC that summer, as part of a side which beat a Worcestershire team containing two of his brothers by three wickets. He played little more notable cricket, turning out for the Quidnuncs and the Free Foresters infrequently. He was described in Scores and Biographies as being \\"Like the rest of the family he is a fine free hitter, and an excellent field at long-leg, or middle- wicket-off.\\" After graduation Lyttelton was ordained as a deacon in Oxford in 1876, and as a priest the following year. He began his career with a Curacy at St Mary's, Reading, and in 1879 became a tutor at Keble College, Oxford, a post he retained until 1882. Shortly after his marriage in 1880 In 1880 he married the women's activist Mary Kathleen Clive, daughter of the Liberal politician George Clive; they had three children: Margaret Lucy, Archer Geoffrey, and Stephen Clive. Selwyn College In 1882 Lyttelton moved with his wife to Cambridge to take up the post of first Master of Selwyn College. When they arrived, the college was still a building site with only the West front completed. Initially, they made do with a suite of adapted student rooms until the Master's Lodge was built. Lyttelton's moderate political views along with his political connections to the prime minister (his aunt was Gladstone's wife, and his brother served as his Private Secretary) helped ensure acceptance of the new institution within the university. However, he did cause some consternation when he ruled that in general only members of the Church of England would be admitted to the college, despite government acts of 1856 and 1871 which allowed undergraduates and faculty members of any religion, or no religion, to be admitted. He was described in a history of the college as a \\"fine teacher and a reserved, aloof-seeming man of judgement, decision and piety.\\" Return to church work In 1893 Lyttelton returned to ecclesiastical work, taking up the post of Vicar of Eccles. He was an Honorary Chaplain to Queen Victoria from 1895 until the following year when he was appointed as Chaplain in Ordinary to the Queen, a position in which he served until 1898. He was Lady Margaret's Preacher in each of 1885 and 1897, delivering the Hulsean Lectures in 1891. He was briefly named as an Honorary Canon of Manchester in 1898, but later that year ascended to the Episcopate as the Bishop of Southampton, suffragan to the Bishop of Winchester. In the same year, he was appointed Provost of St. Nicholas College, Lancing, West Sussex. In 1900 he was appointed Archdeacon of Winchester. Lyttelton was one of a number of contributors to Lux Mundi. He was granted a Doctorate in Divinity from the University of Cambridge in 1899. Death Lyttelton's grave at St John the Baptist Church, Hagley Lyttelton died at his home in Petersfield, Hampshire on 19 February 1903.

The studio considered firing Bennett after the film lost $100,000 at the box office. Plot With the outbreak of World War I, a young woman is unable to purchase a train ticket from Luxembourg to Austria. However, Rudolph \\"Rudy\\" Ritter is attracted to her and gets her aboard a train to Bern, Switzerland. Later, when the train is stopped short of their destination, she slips away while he goes in search of a car. He does not even know her name. Rudy turns out to be a captain in the Austrian Ministry of War assigned to deal with Russian spies, particularly the very successful K-14. He gets a lead when a secret message is intercepted; it contains information about a newly improved flamethrower. Rudy is assigned to Major Lieber, the man in charge of the unit developing the weapon. Rudy is delighted when Lieber introduces him to nurse Karen Sch√∂ntag, his former traveling companion. Rudy sees Karen every night, and the pair fall in love. However, Karen is actually K-14. She narrowly escapes being caught by Rudy and his men, then is brought in for questioning when she goes to a certain staircase that Rudy knows is being used by the Russians to transfer messages. Rudy refuses to believe she is a spy and does not even search her. Major Lieber, however, notices something odd about one of the books she had with her; one page has been freshly torn out (the one with an invisible message). Faced with the mounting evidence, Rudy sets a trap. He has Russian-speaking Private Muller sent to K-14's hospital masquerading as a prisoner of war. Muller gives K-14 the Russian recognition signal (two circles) and passes her a message, ordering her to meet an agent at a deserted house at nine o'clock that night. K-14 is suspicious, but feels she must go. Her contact insists on taking her there. After she incriminates herself to \\"Russian\\" agent Lehan, Rudy is forced to arrest her. K-14's associate shoots Rudy and knocks out Lehan. He has to drag K-14 away from the wounded Rudy, who also urges her to flee. After the war ends, the two meet by chance at a Swiss train station. This time, Rudy does not let her get away. Cast Production Working titles for the film were \\"Free Lady\\", \\"The Woman Spy\\" and \\"Without Glory\\".\\"Notes\\" on TCM.com In 1934, Daily Variety reported that a plagiarism suit had been filed against the film by Baroness Carla Jenssen, who claimed that the story of the film wa an unauthorized version of her own story, \\"She Spys\\", but the outcome of the suit is unknown. Reception Mordaunt Hall was unimpressed with the film, writing in The New York Times that it \\"taxes one's credulity\\" and that Roland's performance was \\"hardly satisfactory\\", though he thought \\"Miss Bennett does her work as well as it is possible in the circumstances.\\" RKO lost $100,000 on the film.

To the east of the hill is Poƒç√°tky originally K√°men u Kraslic (German: Stein am Hohen Stein) and Kosteln√≠ (German: Kirchberg am Hohen Stein), and to the west lies Erlbach with it hamlet Eubabrunn. The ridge of rocks at the summit resemble a ruined castle. It is the western rocks that are used by climbers. They are ideal for beginners, with some low difficulty routes. It is also in the west that one finds the highest point, which rises to 773m. It can be reached by means of a bridge and steel steps- forming a popular panorama point, (German:Aussichtsfelsen) or (Czech:Vyhlidkov√° sk√°la). The ridge continues in a wall like formation, terminating at the eastern end with the Felsturm Zob√°k (Schnabel) and the monumental Felsen V√™trn√° sk√°la (Windfelsen).

Rhoades and R.B. Rimler, Avian pasteurellosis, in \\"Diseases of poultry\\", ed. by M.S. Hofstad, Iowa State University Press, Ames, Iowa, USA , p. 141. It is the most common pasteurellosis of poultry. As the causative agent is Pasteurella multocida, it is considered to be a zoonosis. Adult birds and old chickens are more susceptible. In parental flocks, cocks are far more susceptible than hens.Hassan Iraqui, Observation on an outbreak of fowl cholera in a parental broiler flock, Azrou, Morocco, October 2007, unpublished data. Besides chickens, the disease also concerns turkeys, ducks, geese, raptors, and canaries. Turkeys are particularly sensitive, with mortality ranging to 65%.Alberts and Graham (1948), quoted in \\"Diseases of poultry\\", op. cit. The recognition of this pathological condition is of ever increasing importance for differential diagnosis with avian influenza. History The disease was first recorded in the 18th century. However it was not until the 1880s that Louis Pasteur first isolated and grew it in pure culture. Originally a disease of fowl in Europe, it was first recorded in North America in 1943‚Äì44. Since then outbreaks have been recorded almost annually in wild birds. Today, this disease is most prevalent in wild waterfowl of North America.Botzler. 1991. Epizootiology of Avian Cholera in Wildfowl. Journal of Wildlife Diseases. Chicken Cholera was Observed by Louis pasteur by luck because it was only when he went on holiday and left his chicken with some cold vaccine to come home to find it dead he realise then the potential opportunaty to make a new vaccine 27:367-395 Before the work of Pasteur, chicken cholera often killed 90% of a flock. Pasteur discovered that a tiny drop of culture (biology) on a few crumbs of bread would suffice to kill a chicken. He observed that when he inoculated his hens with an untended and denatured batch of culture they became ill and then recovered. When he exposed these hens to a fresh and potent culture, they survived although others were killed. In some histories, the idea of vaccination was remarked by Pasteur in this work. In 2011 an outbreak of avian cholera killed thousands of eider ducks in Arctic regions of Canada. Scientists are studying the outbreak and its potential to spread to Greenland. In March 2015, another outbreak of avian cholera killed roughly 2,000 snow geese in northern Idaho while flying their spring migration to Canada. Epidemiology Outbreaks occur in cold and wet weather (in late summer, fall and winter). The outbreaks are often traced back to the presence of rodents in the breeding houses. These are thought to spread the disease from carcasses of dead birds (possibly from neighboring backyards), improperly disposed of. Once the disease is introduced to a flock, it will stay until culling. Chronic carriers can always lead to re-emerging of the disease in susceptible birds... In wild birds, this disease is most commonly associated with wetlands. Blanchong et al.Blanchong et al. 2006. Persistence of Pasteurella multocida in Wetlands Following Avian Cholera Outbreaks. Journal of Wildlife Diseases. 42: 33-39 determined that wetlands act as short term reservoirs, recording large amounts of the bacterium in the soil and water through the duration of the outbreak. Wetlands, however, are not long term reservoirs. The disease presents in two very different forms: acute and chronic. Birds with chronic avian cholera, more common in domestic fowl, exhibit prolonged illness with more localized infections. Chronic infection has been demonstrated in snow geese, and these individuals are believed to be long term migrating reservoirs for the disease. Once the bacteria gets introduced into a population of susceptible birds, an outbreak of acute avian cholera follows. Infected birds will die 6‚Äì12 hours after contracting the bacterium, and very few ill birds have been described.Samuel et al. 2005. Avian Cholera in Waterfowl: The role of Lesser Snow Geese and Ross's Geese Carriers in the Playa Lakes Region. Journal of Wildlife Diseases Due to association and dense aggregations, waterfowl are most commonly affected by P. multocida, however scavengers and other water birds are often affected in large multi-species outbreaks.Blanchong et al. 2006. Multi-species patterns of avian cholera mortality in Nebraska's rainwater basin. Journal of Wildlife Diseases. 42: 81-91 Clinical signs and post-mortem lesions Necrotic foci on liver In acute cases, a green diarrhea can be an early symptom. The most typical symptom, in chronic cases, is the swelling of the wattles. It is more frequent in resistant local breeds. Rather than a general infection, localized infections are more characteristic. These often occur in the respiratory tract including the sinuses and pneumatics bones, hock joints, sternal bursa, foot pads, peritoneal cavity and oviducts.K.R. Rhoades and R.B. Rimler, Avian pasteurellosis, in \\"Diseases of poultry\\", ed. by M.S. Hofstad, Iowa State University Press, Ames, Iowa, USA , p. 141 In acute cases, the most typical p.m. lesion is the petechiae observed in the epicardial fatty tissue. Necrotic foci on liver are usually found and general hyperemia is common. Due to the speed of infection and mortality, birds are in good body condition and do not exhibit the signs of prolonged illness. Treatment The most efficient treatment in breeding flocks or laying hens is individual intramuscular injections of a long-acting tetracycline, with the same antibiotic in drinking water, simultaneously. The mortality and clinical signs will stop within one week, but the bacteria might remain present in the flock.

He was beatified in 1929. Life He was a native of Essex, but little is known of his family or early life. He was educated at St. Omer's, and entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus on 7 September 1635. Coming upon the English mission in 1647, he worked in England for more than thirty years, mostly in the eastern counties. On 8 December 1652, he was professed of the four vows. Twice he was superior of the Suffolk District, once of the Lincolnshire District, and finally in 1678 he was declared Provincial. In this capacity he refused to admit Titus Oates as a member of the Society, on the grounds of his ignorance, blasphemy and sexual attraction to young boys, and expelled him forthwith from the seminary of St Omer; shortly afterwards Titus, motivated largely by personal spite against Whitbread, fabricated the Popish Plot.Kenyon, J.P. The Popish Plot Phoenix Press reissue 2000 p.50 It was said later that Whitbread had a miraculous presentiment of the Plot, and undoubtedly he preached a celebrated sermon at Liege in July 1678, on the text \\"Can ye drink of the cup that I drink of?\\", in which he warned his listeners that the present time of tranquility would not last, and that they must be willing to suffer false accusations, imprisonment, torture and martyrdom.Kenyon p.50 Having completed a tour of his Flanders province, he went to England but at once fell ill with plague.Kenyon p.50 Arrest, trial and execution Whitbread was arrested in London on Michaelmas Day, 1678, but was so ill that he could not be moved to Newgate till three months later. He was first indicted at the Old Bailey, 17 December 1678, but the evidence against him and his companions broke down.Kenyon p.144 Given the state of public opinion, it was unthinkable to the Government that Whitbread, whom Oates and the other informers had identified as one of the originators of the Plot, should be allowed to escape punishment.Kenyon p.50 Accordingly he was remanded and kept in prison till 13 June 1679, when he was again indicted for treason, and with four others was found guilty on the perjured evidence of Oates, William Bedloe and Stephen Dugdale.Kenyon pp.180-185 The importance of the trial is shown by the fact that it was heard by a bench of seven judges, headed by the Lord Chief Justice, Sir William Scroggs, who was a firm believer in the Plot and deeply hostile to Catholic priests.Kenyon p.180 In the circumstances Whitbread could not have hoped to escape, and, although he strongly maintained his innocence, Kenyon suggests that he had resigned himself to death.Kenyon p.181 Certainly the sermon he had preached at Liege the previous year suggests that he expected to suffer the death of a martyr, whether sooner or later.Kenyon p.50 He was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn. The King, who knew that he and his fellow victims were innocent, ordered that they be allowed to die before being mutilated. The crowd showed that on this occasion its sympathies were with the victims, and it listened in respectful silence as Whitbread and the others made lengthy speeches protesting their innocence.Kenyon p.206 The others executed with him were John Gavan, John Fenwick, William Harcourt and Anthony Turner. After the execution his remains, and those of his companions, were buried in St. Giles's in the Fields.

It is a Grade I listed building, the only such building in Harrogate. It was designed by the architect Temple Lushington Moore and is his most famous work. It is designated as a \\"Major Parish Church\\" and is the 38th largest parish church in England. History The chancel The construction of the church started in 1904 following a bequest of ¬£3,485 from the estate of the late Bishop of Ripon to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. This allocation was instrumental in procuring an Order in Council on 12 August 1904 for the formation of the new district of St Wilfrid, Harrogate. The church was estimated to cost around ¬£24,000. The Bishop of Knaresborough dedicated the Nave and Baptistry on 4 January 1908 which had consumed ¬£11,000. Two sisters, Elizabeth Sophia and Jean Trotter gave large donations to fund the completion. The first gift of ¬£10,000 (), allowed the nave to be completed by 1914. The church was consecrated on Thursday 11 June 1914 by the Bishop of Ripon at which point the initial estimated cost of ¬£24,000 had already been spent. The church had to be guarded all night by a band of church workers to prevent it being the object of attention on the part of militant Suffragettes. Temple Moore died in 1920 and a bequest from Jean Trotter in 1924 of ¬£32,000 (), allowed the completion of the north and south transepts. The work was completed in 1927 by Temple Moore's son-in-law, Leslie Moore. In 1928, the organ was installed in the North Transepts. The organ and transepts were dedicated by the Bishop of Oxford on 18 July 1928. William Gunn left ¬£9,000 (), in his will of 1932 and this allowed the church hall to be built. The hall features a lamella roof, the only example of such a construction in the United Kingdom. In 1935, the generosity of Sir William Nicholson allowed the Lady Chapel to be built by William Nicholson and Son of Leeds at a cost of ¬£10,000 {). The Calvary was the work of Alfred Southwick. While most of the work after Temple Moore's death in 1920 had been sympathetic to his sketches, Leslie Moore's design for the Lady Chapel was radically different from the small chapel proposed by this father-in-law. Reception The church is widely considered to be Temple Moore's greatest work. It subtly dominates the Harrogate skyline, and Pevsner considers it to be \\"the biggest and by far the best of Harrogate's churches, the masterwork of Temple Moore\\". Sir Aston Webb highlights its national importance, and goes as far as to say it is \\"perhaps the most beautiful of all parish churches I know\\" (Yorkshire Post, 8 June 1935). The church is subject of Sir John Betjeman's poem \\"Perp. Revival i' the North\\", in which its elegant grandeur and traditional liturgy are identified. Elsewhere, he remarks how the building seems vast in every direction, enhanced by what he describes as \\"Edwardian vistas\\". Leslie Moore's faithful completion of his father-in-law's masterpiece is a great credit to him. His skill as an architect is further credited by the Church Times for February 24, 1950, which writes \\"Mr Leslie Moore has outdone his uncle by adding the loveliest part of the building - the Lady Chapel\\". In a local newspaper, reviewing the dedication of the Lady Chapel, it was described as a \\"glorious pageant in Christian architecture\\". On 4 February 1975, St Wilfrid's Church was designated a Grade I listed building. Music Musicians Since the dedication of the building, there has been an uninterrupted choral tradition in the parish. A Music Foundation was established in 2015 to enhance the musical life of the parish, and improve the musical facilities available. Former Directors of Music and organists include David Halls, now of Salisbury Cathedral, James McDonald, now of St Giles Pontefract, Leonard Sandermann and Simon Lindley. The current Director of Music is Anthony Gray, formerly of Southwell Minster and Robinson College, Cambridge. Organ The Harrison and Harrison organ The Harrison and Harrison organ in the North Transept was installed in 1928 upon completion of this part of the church. Its outline form is based on a 1912 sketch by Temple Moore, with minor alterations by Leslie Moore and Harry Harrison. Due to a lack of funds, no case proper was realised. The instrument was voiced by Arthur Harrison, and is one of the best preserved examples of his work. As such, the organ received Grade II*-listing from the British Institute of Organ Studies. Due to lack of funds, eight stops, three chests, and one reservoir were not installed in 1928. Generations since have displayed a continuous commitment to the completion of the organ, with additions (mostly sympathetic) in 1942, 1968, 1972, 1982, and 2011. A restoration project is currently in the consultation phase. Bells St Wilfrid's Church has eight bells, for change-ringing, in the central tower. The heaviest six bells, cast from redundant bells from High Hoyland, were installed in 1973. The [tenor] of the peal weighs 6cwt and 3lbs and is tuned to C. In 1976 two redundant bells were obtained and the ring was increased to eight in 1977. Additionally there is a Sanctus bell in the South-East tower.

It usually awakens the person from sleep, and may be quite frightening. Though simple orthopnea may be relieved by sitting upright at the side of the bed with legs dangling, in those with PND, coughing and wheezing often persist in this position. Mechanisms PND is caused in part by the depression of the respiratory center during sleep, which may reduce arterial oxygen tension, particularly in patients with interstitial lung disease and reduced pulmonary compliance. Similar to orthopnea, in the horizontal position there is redistribution of blood volume from the lower extremities to the lungs. In normal individuals this has little effect on lungs, but in patients in whom the additional volume cannot be pumped out by the left ventricle due to left ventricular weakness, there is a significant reduction in lung capacity which results in shortness of breath. Additionally, in patients with congestive heart failure the pulmonary circulation may already be overloaded because of the failing left ventricle. When a person lies down, the left ventricle is unable to match the output of a more normally functioning right ventricle on increased venous return to the lungs; causing pulmonary congestion. Pulmonary congestion decreases when the patient assumes a more erect position, and this is accompanied by an improvement in symptoms. Diagnosis Evaluation should begin with a detailed cardiac history and physical exam; echocardiography and CXR may be used though the diagnostic workup varies depending on the suspected cause.  Treatment  Treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea depends on the underlying cause. Options often include oxygen, diuretics, heart medications, antihypertensives, and bronchodilators to reverse wheezing.

The Next Best Action (an offer, proposition, service, etc.) is determined by the customer's interests and needs on the one hand, and the marketing organization's business objectives, policies on the other. This is in sharp contrast to traditional marketing approaches that first create a proposition for a product or service and then attempt to find interested and eligible prospects for that proposition. This practice, direct marketing, typically automated in the form of a campaign management tool, is often product-centric, and usually always marketing-centric.  Further positioning  The next-best-action paradigm is suited to inbound customer communication because a customer making contact will accept a considered response from the company to his or her request, complaint, inquiry, etc. Leveraging Next Best Action will enable the company to respond to the customer's needs during the interaction, while ensuring that the action taken also benefits the company. Without a next best action capability in place, a call center or branch agent would be enabled to follow a script in their communication with the customer, which, while perhaps furthering the company's marketing goals, would most likely be impervious to customer context. Notwithstanding its relevance to inbound customer communication next-best-action marketing is equally applicable to outbound communication. In this case the next-best-action strategy is applied in batch, overnight for instance, after which customers that have been assigned the same action (i.e. make proposition X) are aggregated.  Enabling technology  Since early this century, the technology has been available to allow a company to achieve next-best-action capabilities in high volumes as well as in real-time. Typically, this requires a multi- channel, centralized decisioning authority that dispenses all decisions with regard to the customer (see Enterprise decision management). This ‚Äúdecisioning hub‚Äù leverages ‚Äúdecision logic‚Äù that combines the company's business rules with predictive and adaptive (aka self-learning) decisioning models to help determine how to approach a customer prior to as well as during an interaction. The decisioning authority takes into account each customer's expectations, propensities and likely behavior through the use of predictive modeling. Interfaces that can leverage this intelligence must also be in place to externalize the logic and guide an agent (or the system itself) in how the customer would prefer to be treated at any given moment, continuously recalibrating the approach based on customer responses. The approach taken may be to make an offer, resolve a complaint, or to make some other kind of recommendation (or a combination of all of these). Another approach to next- best-action is using machine learning to access the impact of specific activities on Consumer Experience (CX) or measuring the impact of actions on latent affinity for brands or their products. It is widely understood that superior customer experience drives revenue growth. A CX based Next -Best- Action AI system can be developed and deployed at scale. A traditional measure of CX is the Net Promoter Score (NPS) introduced by Frederick Reichheld. Using supervised AI techniques where the desired outcome is a high CX, Next-Best- Action recommendation engine can be implemented.  History  The Next Best Action paradigm is not new nor is it only applicable in marketing. A similar concept was suggested by John Boyd of the United States Airforce (OODA Loop). In a military context it describes thinking on the fly with distributed, local decision-making versus planned campaigns and objectives. In marketing it has only recently been possible to make decisions fast enough on an enterprise scale to build a ‚Äòmini-business case‚Äô in real-time, considering many courses of action before deciding on the best one. From a business perspective, the rise of the next-best-action paradigm has in part been triggered by an increasing emphasis on inbound marketing. Organizations have found that volume in the inbound channels (web, call center, ATM, branch, etc.) is increasing in recent years, while outbound channels (direct mail, cold calling, etc.) are increasingly challenged. The reason for this is threefold: 1) customers have become less tolerant of receiving outbound marketing solicitations; 2) new regulations limit spam or spam-like activities, telemarketing calls and direct mail; and 3) customers are increasingly Internet savvy.  Benefits and drawbacks  A first complication is that most companies are organized in a product-oriented way. This means that product managers have specific volume or revenue targets. Traditional campaign management is very much aligned with this. The Next Best Action paradigm, although capable of reflecting the same priorities, is normally used for bottom line optimization. Organizationally this means that different lines of business will need to collaborate to define next-best-action strategies, and goals may need to be reset to better reflect the customer-centric nature of the new processes. The second complication is its unpredictability. Although overall it will optimize the bottom line and have other attractive features (like built-in customer centricity), the ‚Äòon the fly‚Äô decision-making makes it harder to know in advance what the results will be. There are implications for supply chain management, staff incentive schemes, budgeting, and service level agreements. Next-best-action strategies can be made predictable again by simulating them in advance.

She married Domenico Taigi, a brash and impulsive individual though devoted to his wife. St. Anna Maria experienced a series of ecstasies during her life and was reported to have heard the voices of God and Jesus Christ on several occasions. She became a Secular Trinitarian after experiencing a sudden religious conversion. That happened in the winter of 1790 at Saint Peter's Basilica when St. Anna Maria came into contact with a range of cardinals and luminaries, which included Vincent Strambi and the bishop Benedict Joseph Flaget. The beatification process opened in 1863 under Pope Pius IX after she was titled as a Servant of God and Pope Benedict XV later beatified her in mid-1920. Life Childhood and education Anna Maria Giannetti was born in Siena, Italy on May 29, 1769 as an only child to Luigi Giannetti and Maria Masi. On May 30, 1769, she was baptized in her local parish church as \\"Anna Maria Gesualda Antonia Giannetti\\". Her father served as a pharmacist in a small store in Siena. However, he lost his fortune. In 1774, the family moved to Rome where Luigi found work as a household servant. From 1774 - 1776, St. Anna Maria attended a school, managed by the Filippini Sisters. After graduation, Anna Maria worked as a domestic servant to help provide for her family. While living in Rome, she was nicknamed \\"Annette\\". In 1780, she received her Confirmation in the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran and, in 1782, received her First Communion in her parish church of San Francesco di Paola. Marriage On January 7, 1789, Anna Maria married the Milanese Domenico Taigi (1761-1850s). Mr. Taigi served as a butler for the noble House of Chigi in the church of San Marcello al Corso. The couple had seven children, three of whom died in infancy. Their children were: * Camillo (died aged 42) * Alessandro (died aged 35) * Luigi (died at 18 months) * Pietro (died 2 years and 1 month) * Maria (unmarried) * Sofia (widow of the late Paolo Micali of Mantua and had six children) * Margherita (died in infancy) When Sofia was about to be married, her fianc√©e, Micali, was allowed to frequent the house. For 2 months prior to the marriage, the couple could meet, but only in the presence of her parents. Sofia's son, Camillo, was conscripted into the armed service. When Sofia was widowed, Anna Maria allowed Sofia and her six children to move into her home. Although Anna Maria's husband, Domenico, could be ill-tempered and caustic, he was devoted to his wife. It was alleged that Anna Maria had an adulterous affair with an older man. After her father died, Anna Maria's mother moved in with the family. In winter 1790, Anna Maria and Domenico visited Saint Peter's Basilica. She was leaning on his arm in an extravagant dress. A large throng saw her bump into the Servite priest, Father Angelo Verandi, in the piazza. Anna Maria went to confession and felt a strong inspiration to renounce her vanities. She cried to the priest: \\"Father; you have at your feet a great sinner.\\" The priest replied, \\"Go away; you are not one of my penitents.\\" Finally, the priest relented and allowed Anna Maria to confess. After he absolved her, the priest curtly slammed the confessional slide shut. On another occasion, Anna Maria entered the church of San Andrea della Valle. Before the Crucifix, Anna Maria heard the voice of Jesus Christ, \\"What is your wish? To follow Jesus poor and naked and stripped of all? Or to follow Him in His triumph and glory? Which do you choose?\\" Anna Maria replied, \\"I embrace the cross of my Jesus. I will carry it like Him in pain and ignominy. I await at His hands triumph and glory in the hereafter.\\" On December 26, 1802, Anna Maria became a professed member of the Secular Trinitarians in the church of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane. She frequented hospitals and especially liked to visit and aid patients at San Giacomo of the Incurables. Sister Anna Maria experienced a series of ecstasies and frequent visions in which she foresaw the future. She knew a range of religious individuals, including Cardinal Carlo Maria Pedicini. Their friendship lasted three decades. One evening, Sr. Anna Maria drifted off to sleep with a serene expression on her face. Her eyes drifted upwards, towards Heaven, which alarmed her daughter, Maria, who tearfully proclaimed, \\"Mamma is dead; Mamma is dead.\\" Her sister, Sofia, corrected Maria, \\"No! She is praying,\\" but Domenico said to them, \\"Be quiet! She's asleep. Leave her alone. She had no sleep last night.\\" Before Sr. Anna Maria died, she met with the first Bishop of Louisville Benedict Joseph Flaget. She praised the Bishop and the United States of America. Napoleon's mother, Letizia Ramolino, learned of Sr. Anna Maria and sought her spiritual advice. Some of Sr. Anna Maria's spiritual advisors were Raffaele Natali, the secretary of Pope Pius VII and Vincent Strambi. Later life Sr. Anna Maria became acquainted with Cardinal Luigi Ercolani, and Monsignor Mastai who became the future Pope Pius IX. Pope Pius VII often asked Monsignor Strambi how Sr. Anna Maria was doing and would send his blessings to her. Pope Leo XII and the Venerable Giuseppe Bartolomeo Menocchio both held her in high esteem. Sr. Anna Maria composed a prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Cardinal Pedicini took this prayer to Pius VII who, in a rescript on 6 March 1809, granted an indulgence. For 100 days, those who recited it, a plenary indulgence once a month on the usual conditions. Sr. Anna Maria was devoted to the following saints: * Saint Joseph * Saint Philip Neri * Saint Francis of Paola * Saint Aloysius Gonzaga * Saint Felix of Valois * Saint John of Matha * Saint Filomena Sr. Anna Maria attended the 1825 Jubilee which Pope Leo XII had summoned. She knew of the latter pope's ill health. Before he died, in 1829, she saw the morning sun and prayed for him. St Anna Maria heard a heavenly voice say, \\"Arise and pray. My Vicar is on the point of coming to render an account to Me.\\" Pope Leo's successor Pope Pius VIII lived in the shadow of ill health. Sr. Anna Maria foresaw his death and prayed for his soul as she did with his predecessor. She had predicted the pontificate of Pius VIII would be a short one. She successfully foresaw that Cardinal Bartolomeo Alberto Cappellari would be elected as Pope Gregory XVI. Before Pius VIII died, Sr. Anna Maria and Monsignor Natali went to San Paolo fuori le Mura. When Cardinal Cappellari arrived, she was in a small chapel which the Monsignor tried to have her vacate for the Cardinal. Sr. Anna Maria would not leave. The Cardinal told the Monsignor not to disturb her so the Monsignor went to kneel elsewhere in reflection. When Sr. Anna Maria emerged, she fixated her eyes on the Cardinal. When the Monsignor asked why she was doing that, she frankly responded, \\"That is the future pope.\\" Final year and death On May 20, 1836, Sr. Anna Maria went to San Paolo fuori le Mura. She had confided in Monsignor Natali this would be her final visit there. Monsignor Natali celebrated Mass with her before reflecting in front of the crucifix. On October 24, 1836, Sr. Anna Maria fell ill. She was confined to her bed and would never rise again. On June 2, 1837, her fever slightly declined but a few days later, her fever rose. On June 5, Sr. Anna Maria bid farewell to those who visited her bedside. On June 8, she received the last rites of Extreme Unction. Sr. Anna Maria received the Viaticum and the Anointing of the Sick from the local curate. On June 9, 1837, at 4 a.m., she died. Cardinal Pedicini sent a letter at once to Cardinal Carlo Odescalchi to inform him of her death. Sr. Anna Maria's remains were exposed until June 11th in the church of Santa Maria in Via Lata. Monsignor Natali asked for a death mask to be made before her burial. She was buried at Campo Verano where, on the orders of Pope Gregory XVI, her remains were enclosed in a leaden sepulcher with seals affixed to it. Cardinal Odescalchi asked Cardinal Natali to compile all documents so that Monsignor Luquet could publish her biography. Cardinal Pedicini was a frequent visitor to St. Anna Maria's tomb. The Capuchin Cardinal Ludovico Micara always kept an image of her on his person. The Minim priest Venerable Bernardo Clausi said of St. Anna Maria, \\"If she is not in Heaven, there is no room there for anybody.\\" Vincent Pallotti praised her after she died for her saintliness and life of holiness. It was learned that St. Anna Maria had wanted to be buried in San Crisogono Rome. So, on August 18, 1865, St. Anna Maria's remains were transferred there. In 1868, her remains were found intact; however, her clothes had decayed and were replaced. In 1920, her remains were found no longer incorrupt. Beatification In 1852, in Rome, the beatification opened in an informative process. It concluded sometime later. The spiritual works of St. Anna Maria had to receive approval so that the cause could continue. Theologians could approve her writings which were orthodox in nature. It was an apostolic process which later received validation from the Congregation of Rites. On January 8, 1863, the official start to the cause came under Pope Pius IX. She was titled as a Servant of God. On August 30, 1904, an antepreparatory congregation met to discuss the cause. On June 27, 1905,a preparatory committee met. On January 30, 1906, a general congregation met. On March 4, 1906, the confirmation of St.Anna Maria's heroic virtue allowed for Pope Pius X to name her as Venerable. Two of her miracles (required for St. Anna Maria's beatification) were investigated and validated. On July 27, 1909, approval was received by an antepreparatory congregation. On April 5, 1910, approval was received by a preparatory committee. On December 3, 1918, approval was received by a general congregation. On January 6, 1919, Pope Benedict XV approved the two miracles. On May 30, 1920, the Pope presided over St. Anna Maria's beatification in Saint Peter's Basilica. The current postulator assigned to the cause is Javier Carnerero Pe√±alver. A total of 30 witnesses were summoned to testify for the cause. Included were her two daughters as well as many cardinals and bishops. St. Anna Maria's 92 year-old husband, Domenico, testified in favor. His shoulder's were hunched and leaned on a walking stick.

Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) is a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). History Cricket was introduced to Rhodesia in the 19th century and the Rhodesian Cricket Union was formed in 1898. Rhodesia participated in the Currie Cup, the South African inter- province competition in 1904/05 and then again from 1929/30 until 1979/80. In May 1980, the new post-colonial country of Zimbabwe severed its cricketing ties with South Africa and it became an Associate Member of the then \\"International Cricket Conference\\". Zimbabwe became a full member of the ICC on 6 July 1992 and played its first Test match on 18‚Äì22 October the same year, against India at the Harare Sports Club in Harare. The match was drawn. Political issues During the 2003 cricket World Cup, the political situation in Zimbabwe came to the fore on the cricket field. Two Zimbabwean players, Andy Flower (white) and Henry Olonga (black), defied orders and wore black armbands during matches in protest against the \\"death of democracy in Zimbabwe\\" ‚Äì a reference to their concern over the political actions of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. Both players subsequently retired from cricket and emigrated from Zimbabwe. On 2 April 2004, Zimbabwe announced that test captain Heath Streak had resigned the captaincy and retired from cricket. Over the following days it became clear that Streak had been dismissed. The fellow white players submitted a list of demands to Zimbabwe Cricket, including the reinstatement of Streak and a review of the team selection process with a view to eliminating political and racial bias imposed by the Mugabe government. The ZC ignored the demands and fielded a team of inexperienced youths in two Tests and three One Day Internationals against the touring Sri Lankan side. The understrength Zimbabwe team was resoundingly defeated, resulting in calls from many players, ex-players, commentators, and fans for the ICC to strip the ZC of Test status until the internal crisis could be resolved. The matter reached a climax when ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed flew to Harare on 17 May to meet with ZC officials and discuss the crisis. The ZC refused to see him. Speed called an emergency meeting of the ICC Board to vote on the issue of Zimbabwe's suspension as a Test nation. On 21 May, with the vote just hours away, the ZC contacted Cricket Australia with an offer to cancel the two Test matches against Australia, due to begin the next day. Cricket Australia accepted the offer, thus averting the vote against the ZCU. On 10 June, representatives of the ZC, Cricket Australia, the United Cricket Board of South Africa, and the Board of Control for Cricket in India met and agreed that all remaining Test matches involving Zimbabwe for 2004 would be cancelled. In November 2005, Tatenda Taibu the young captain of the Zimbabwe national team resigned citing the Current Situation in Zimbabwe Cricket as the main reason.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/other_international/zimbabwe/4467062.stm In March 2007, ZC ordered national team members participating in the Cricket World Cup in to remove their dreadlocks. In May 2007, the Australian Prime Minister John Howard declared his opposition to the political situation in Zimbabwe and the conduct of the Mugabe government by formally blocking the proposed tour to Zimbabwe in September 2007, by the Australian cricket team after discussions with Australian players. Governing body Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) (formerly known as the Zimbabwe Cricket Union) is the governing body for the sport of cricket in Zimbabwe. It is a full member of the International Cricket Council and African Cricket Association, and operates the Zimbabwean cricket team, organising Test tours and One Day Internationals with other nations. It also organises domestic cricket in Zimbabwe. Domestic competitions The Logan Cup is the premier domestic first-class cricket competition in Zimbabwe. It has been contested on a provincial basis since the 1903‚Äì04 season, when the country was still called Rhodesia, but has only attained first-class status since Zimbabwe became a full member of the ICC in 1992. Zimbabwe's List A competition is the Pro50 Championship. The Twenty20 competition is the Stanbic Bank 20 Series. Teams Zimbabwean domestic first-class cricket involved the following teams before the introduction of the franchise system in Zimbabwe Cricket: * Centrals * Northerns * Southerns * Westerns * Easterns The newly introduced five franchise sides are as follows: * Matabeleland Tuskers * Mashonaland Eagles * Mid West Rhinos * Mountaineers * Rangers Southern Rocks dropped out after the 2013-14 season.

He was a longtime professor emeritus at University of California-Los Angeles, where he taught as a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology for many years.  Personal life Murray Jarvik was born in the Bronx, New York City on June 1, 1923. He was the son of Minnie (Haas) and Jacob Jarvik, an upholsterer. Jarvik suffered from lifelong heart problems, which began with a severe case of rheumatic fever when he was twelve years old. He later developed polio at the age of 28 and was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1992, which was cured. He was never a smoker. Jarvik received his undergraduate bachelor's degree at the City College of New York before earning his master's degree in science at U.C.L.A.. He received his doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley and his medical degree from the University of California, San Francisco. He was married to his wife, Dr. Lissy Feingold Jarvik, for 53 years, and the couple had two sons. His son Laurence Jarvik made the documentary film Who Shall Live and Who Shall Die about the inaction of the Roosevelt Administration during the time of the Holocaust. His other son, Dr. Jeffrey G. Jarvik is Professor of Neuroradiology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. His nephew Robert Jarvik developed the first artificial heart, called Jarvik-7.  Nicotine patch  Murray Jarvik began research into the absorption of tobacco contents through the skin and its effects on the human body. His initial exploration into this field began by studying farmers and farmhands in the American South who harvest tobacco by hand for a living. However, Jarvik and his colleague, then UCLA postdoctoral fellow Jed Rose, could not get approval to conduct their research into tobacco absorption through the skin on human subjects. Instead, Jarvik and Rose began testing the effects of absorption of tobacco contents on themselves. The effects of the tobacco was immediately measurable. In an interview with UCLA Magazine, Jarvik remembered, \\"We put the tobacco on our skin and waited to see what would happen. Our heart rates increased, adrenaline began pumping, all the things that happen to smokers.\\" Jarvik and Rose's research led to their invention of the nicotine patch in the early 1990s. The nicotine patch is a transdermal patch that delivers nicotine directly through the skin and into the body to alleviate the urge to smoke and, hopefully, ultimately quit smoking. (Rose now serves as the director of the Center for Nicotine and Smoking Cessation Research at Duke University.) The nicotine patch became available by prescription for smoking cessation in the United States in 1992. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its sale as an over-the- counter treatment in 1996.  Death  Murray Jarvik died at his home in Santa Monica, California, on May 8, 2008, at the age of 84 from a pulmonary edema from congestive heart failure.

Wilhelm Josef Oomens was born in The Hague, Netherlands. He studied mathematics, physics and psychology. In 1949, he entered the congregation of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) and begun a study of philosophy and Catholic theology. In 1957 he was ordained as a priest. From then on he acted as teacher and director of a grammar school and was longstanding director of the centre of orientation and cultural studies in Limburg. Following heart surgery (1978), he was compelled to leave teaching, but continued as a priest in pastoral care in Sittard, Netherlands, near the border with Germany. He enjoyed the work, so he asked the Bishop of Aachen, Klaus Hemmerle, to assign him a rectorate. Thus, the Bishop of Aachen appointed him as pastor at St. Antony, Eschweiler-Roehe, where he served until 2005. Here, he worked closely with the composer and church musician Franz Surges. Meanwhile, continued as a painter. He died 27 June 2008 in Nijmegen. Works The emphasis of his art was the rendering and interpretation of biblical motifs. He painted mythological scenes (for example, \\"Phaeton\\", 1978,; \\"The three Graces\\", 1983), but this was of less importance that his historic and scriptural motifs. He painted the Christmas story (\\"In dulci jubilo\\", 1991, \\"The Adoration of the Magi\\") and the history of Jesus' suffering (for example \\"Man of Sorrows\\", \\"Stations of the Cross\\", 1994, \\"The body of Jesus taken off the cross\\", 1981 and 1992 and of particular importance \\"Ecce Homo\\") and his resurrection and the coronation of the Eucharist (\\"The doubting Thomas\\", 1993; \\"The path to the Light\\", 1998) The manner of painting shows the clear influence of such classical Dutch masters as Lucas van Leiden and Hieronymus Bosch. Philosophy A focus of Wilhelm Joseph Oomens was the idea of wondering (in the tradition of Aristotle and Fathers of the church). The importance of this he accentuated in a multiplicity of homilies and unpublished writings). For him, he function of painting derived from his confidence in the importance of wondering and reverence. Literature * Wilhelm Josef Oomens: Worte in Bildern erleben.

(JUH; German for \\"St. John Accident Assistance\\"), commonly referred to as Die Johanniter, is a voluntary humanitarian organisation affiliated with the Brandenburg Bailiwick of the Order of St John, the German Protestant descendant of the Knights Hospitaller. The organisation was founded in 1952 in Hanover under the leadership of Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff. One of the main reasons for its creation was the rise in injuries and deaths from road traffic accidents (hence the word \\"accident\\" in its name). JUH participates in international aid efforts together with its sister organisations in other countries as part of the Johanniter International partnership; it also works with the German Malteser Hilfsdienst, affiliated to the Catholic Sovereign Military Order of Malta. As of 2017 the organisation had 37,000 active volunteers and youth members and around 1,300,000 registered members. Among recent developments of JUH in Germany is the establishment of local and regional groups that provide first responder services on horseback (see mounted search and rescue). Overview Germany Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe in Germany is organised in nine state chapters which comprise more than 200 associations on district and local levels. It has about 22,000 full-time and part-time employees and is supported by roughly 1.3 million financial donors. The Brandenburg Bailiwick of the Order of St John has been certified as a recipient of donations by Deutsches Zentralinstitut f√ºr soziale Fragen (German Central Institute for Social Matters), a Berlin-based private organisation. Civil servants are another factor that contributes to JUH's economic success. More than 10,000 children and youths are engaged in the organisation's youth chapter Johanniter-Jugend. This youth chapter is a member of the Evangelical youth consortium in Germany and also of the European Movement Germany. Since 2017 Dr. h. c. Frank-J√ºrgen Weise is president of Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe. Joerg Oberfeld is the federal chief physician. Austria Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe in Austria was founded on 21 June 1974 in Vienna, where it first conducted patient transport together with the Austrian Red Cross with a single van. Today JUH in Austria is member of the Vier for Wien ambulance association. Vienna's four largest ambulance services, Red Cross, Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund Austria, JUH and Malteser Hilfsdienst, have been cooperating for a few years now in the ambulance sector. JUH serves areas in Vienna, Orth an der Donau, Tyrol and Carinthia. These regions have different focuses though. While JUH in Vienna is primarily tasked with emergency medical service, the Johanniters in Tyrol are mainly employed with home nursing and patient transport. There is an acute nursing service A.I.D that is specific to Vienna. Poland The Brandenburg Bailiwick of the Order of St John has been active for more than 20 years in neighbouring Poland where it has established 21 social care points. In the course of the eastward expansion of the European Union in 2004, the relief organisation Joannici Dzie≈Ço Pomocy was founded, which became active on 31 August 2004. Together with the Polish Johanniter foundation (established 2003) it engages primarily in ambulance services, nursing and youth work. Since its foundation, Joannici Dzie≈Ço Pomocy has recorded a constant growth which is thought to continue due to high requests in first aid courses. Tasks of Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe A Johanniter patient transport ambulance Johanniter paramedics on a quad bike Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe has bound itself to Christian charity. As a work of the Order of St John it sees its challenge in the needs and dangers of the people. The central motivation is humanitarian aid. The statutory tasks of JUH include *Training: Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe participates in public first aid training, e.g. for driving licence candidates, for companies, etc., as well as in the special training of nurses and emergency medical technicians. *Emergency medical service: JUH operates 210 ambulance stations in Germany which are equipped with patient transport ambulances, emergency ambulances and emergency physician vehicles. *Civil defence and disaster relief: this task involves the response to major disasters. JUH therefore mans vehicles and stations provided by the federal and state governments of Germany. These tasks are mainly handled by voluntary personnel, e.g. all search and rescue dog squadrons are based on volunteers. JUH also maintains a network of crisis intervention and post-trauma support teams. *Social care: Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe provide care for children and youths (also by training student first responders at schools), for disabled and elderly persons. They operate social centres, kindergartens, stationary institutions for the elderly, medical alarms and provide meals on wheels. In 2005 the first stationary hospice was established and furthermore ambulatory hospice is provided. Moreover, JUH engages in caring for dementia patients and the support of relatives. *International aid: the Brandenburg Bailiwick of the Order of St John is engaged in 30 countries of the world. Medical treatment is thereby based on the experience of Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe in Germany. This brings about the core tasks of JUH abroad: medical relief in response to disasters, support in restoring civilian everyday life in crisis areas, establishing health care, medical training and skill enhancement, fighting of infectious diseases and epidemia, and orthopaedic treatment for disabled persons and war casualties. The focus remains on basic health care for people in areas affected by disasters and otherwise aggrieved regions of the world. Together with Cyprus Civil Defense the European Technical Assistance Cooperation ist formed. Its purpose is to operate a Technical Assistance and Support Team. Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe e.V. is a registered charity association in accordance with German law. It is an association within Diakonisches Werk of the Evangelical Church in Germany and is an acknowledged voluntary relief organisation in accordance with article 26 the first Geneva convention of 12 August 1949.

(Croatian) He has been the lead singer of the vocal group The Lettermen since 1958, and is now the only original member. Early life Butala was born in Sharon, Pennsylvania, of Croatian descent, the eighth of eleven children of Mary Ann (Ference) and John George Butala.https://variety.com/1999/scene/people-news/mary-ference- butala-1117883402/ He spent much of his early years on a farm owned by his grandparents, enjoying a rural upbringing which included deer hunting. Butala said in a radio interview that hunting in those days was done more out of survival, rather than sport as it is today. He shot his first deer at the age of 12. Career Butala began his professional singing career in 1948, when he appeared on \\"Starlets on Parade\\", a Saturday morning show on KDKA radio in Pittsburgh. He quickly became a favorite in and around his hometown of Sharon during his pre-teen years. In 1951, Butala's mother, who was a nurse, was called to California to assist her sister, who had been stricken with pneumonia and needed assistance with her children while she recovered. Butala's father, believing that there could be opportunities for his son on the West Coast, suggested that Tony accompany his mother to California, where he joined the Robert Mitchell Boys Choir and performed with the choir through 1954. His notable works during this period included providing the singing voice for Lost Boy Slightly in the Disney animated film Peter Pan (1953). Butala's tenure with the boys' choir ended as his voice naturally changed as he entered his teen years. However, Mitchell, retained him as assistant choir director and paid for his private education as he continued his show business career. As a teenager, Butala sang with a quartet called \\"The Fourmost\\", which included Concetta Ingolia, who would later be known as Connie Stevens. Though the group would later disband, for Tony, it laid the foundation of what would become known as The Lettermen. The first unofficial incarnation of The Lettermen came in 1958, with Butala, Mike Barnett, and Talmadge Russell, who would later be replaced by Jerry Paul. That same year, Gary Clark and Jimmy Blaine followed, and that combination made its first recording, but it was not successful. Butala tried again with two new singers, Bob Engemann and Jim Pike. This lineup brought the group its first success, as The Lettermen scored their first Top 40 hit at #13 on the US charts in 1961 with \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\". This cover of a 1936 song went gold in the U.S. The Lettermen's pop music chart success ended in 1969, but they continued to record and appear live in concert since then, and continue to enjoy success. Business interests Butala also owns Butala Vineyards, which he started from a Chatsworth, California ranch he purchased and planted grapes in, in 1969. Less than twenty years later, he purchased another ranch along the southern Vaca Mountain Range, which is the eastern border of the Napa Valley. He first began selling wine commercially in 1992 under the Castlebrooke label, and continues to produce both wine and grapes for other winemakers as well. Personal life Butala married the former Judith Ann Blaskovich in 1969. The marriage ended in divorce, but both remained friendly until Judith's death in a car accident on October 10, 2006, one day after her 60th birthday. Together they had four children: Anthony, Rebecca, Lisa and Regina, and five grandchildren.

S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia. In The Voyage of the Dawn Treader he is the captain of the Dawn Treader and a close friend of King Caspian X. In The Silver Chair, he has remained a trusted advisor of the king, and has also become a close friend of Caspian's son, Prince Rilian.  The Voyage of the Dawn Treader  In The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, one of the first new characters to be introduced is Lord Drinian, the captain of the Dawn Treader. He is described as a dark- haired young man who loyally serves Caspian on his voyage to the end of the world. Although the seafaring trade in Narnia was severely limited by King Miraz's fear of the sea, Caspian, through his influence as the king, resurrects Narnia's interest in navigation and sailing. As a result, Drinian is one of a few Narnians with a vast knowledge of seafaring. Armed with these skills and his friendly sense of humor, Drinian greatly aids Caspian and his crew in their search for the seven lost lords. Though Drinian is one of the most experienced sailors from Narnia, even he is occasionally surprised throughout the course of their journey. For example, when they reach the island that they later rename Dragon Island, they encounter a creature that most of the crew has never seen before: a dragon. Skeptical, Drinian asserts that dragons, like crocodiles, cannot be trusted and refuses to let his guard down. In fact, it is only upon discovering the dragon's identity (Eustace) that Drinian is able to trust it. This cautiousness proves useful on another occasion. Later in their journey, Drinian spots something that turns out to be a sea serpent. Surviving the sea serpent's attack, Drinian and the ship head for a welcome respite in an approaching harbor. When Caspian suggests that they anchor in a different section of the harbor, Drinian obeys patiently but with a little reluctance at having his own choice for their resting place denied. As they near the edge of the world, Lucy spots a fantastic view of merpeople who are unlike those she had seen in Narnia. Drinian realizes the possible danger they pose to his crew, as any of the men might fall in love with a mermaid or even in love with the world under the water itself and fall overboard; as a result, he orders Lucy to ignore the merpeople and act as if she had not seen them. When Reepicheep falls overboard, Drinian berates him out of worry because he fears for both Reepicheep's safety as well as the possibility that the crew may discover the merpeople. After Reepicheep, Lucy, Eustace, and Edmund continue on their journey to the very edge of the world, Drinian successfully returns Caspian and the crew safely home to Narnia.  The Silver Chair  In The Silver Chair, Lord Drinian has remained a good friend and trusted advisor of King Caspian X. Though Caspian is depicted as being significantly older in this work than in the previous one, Drinian is not described in the same manner and appears to be very active for his age (Caspian is now 66); he still rides a horse despite clearly being in his seventies or eighties. In fact, Drinian has even become a close friend of Caspian's son Rilian. After Caspian's wife is fatally bitten by a serpent, Rilian engages in highly enigmatic activities which he reveals to no one - his constant journeys into the forest on horseback are widely believed to be attempts to track down and kill the serpent which killed his mother. Drinian speaks to Rilian, however, and convinces him to divulge his secret. When Rilian leads Drinian to the very place where his mother died, Drinian discovers the source of Rilian's behaviour - they spot a beautiful but, in Drinian's opinion, evil woman. Although Drinian puzzles over the obsessive attraction Rilian has for this woman, he also, against his better judgment, succumbs to his friendship with Rilian, and allows him to continue visiting the woman. Rilian rides out the next day without anyone accompanying him but he never returns. Lamenting his grave mistake, Drinian approaches Caspian. When Drinian presents his knowledge of Rilian's disappearance to Caspian, he begs Caspian to condemn him as a traitor, for he has allowed the son of his good friend to disappear. Though Drinian implores Caspian for death as punishment for his treachery, Caspian is unable to kill him, not wanting to lose his friend as he has already lost his queen and his son, and the two mourn the loss of Rilian as friends. The serpent which killed the Queen was in fact the Lady of the Green Kirtle, who ruled the underworld beneath Narnia and was intent on breaking through to invade it. She later lured Rilian into the underworld. A decade later, Eustace Scrubb and Jill Pole entered Narnia and along with their guide, Puddleglum the marshwiggle, they found their way into the underworld to save Rilian, who then killed the Lady of the Green Kirtle, and returned to Narnia. During the primary narrative of The Silver Chair, which takes place ten years after Rilian's disappearance, Drinian accompanies Caspian as he voyages through the seas explored in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; Caspian had wanted to make this voyage to see again the place of his youth, but many believed that he had gone to seek Aslan to ask who could be the next King of Narnia after his death. But the voyage is disrupted by Aslan before they reach the end of the world, who explains to Caspian that he must return home to Narnia. When Caspian is reunited with his lost son Rilian, Drinian is there to rejoice in the efforts of Eustace and Jill. He is also at Caspian's side when the king dies soon after, and witnesses the declaration of Rilian as King of Narnia. Film adaption In the 1989 BBC miniseries presentation of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, Drinian is played by John Hallam (who was by then in his late forties), whereas in the 1990 BBC miniseries presentation of The Silver Chair (as an elderly man in a scene from some 40 years later) he is played by Roy Boyd, who was 52 at the time but was perhaps portraying a much older man who was relatively active and young- looking for his age; for instance, Drinian was still riding a horse. In the 2010 Walden/Fox film, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, he is played by Gary Sweet. Conception When he was at school in his younger days, C.S. Lewis studied classic Greek works including the Odyssey. One of the iconic scenes from the Odyssey is repeated in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, in which Drinian fears his crew's sanity and safety when Lucy discovers merpeople (although Drinian does not resort to using wax on his crew to block out their noise like Odysseus). Indeed, Dawn Treader follows in the same sea saga as the Odyssey, with the crew encountering mythical creatures and mysterious islands. Although Drinian is highly proficient in nautical expertise, he is not depicted as being noble or as having an inextinguishable desire for glory and, as a result, does not exhibit any other trait similarities with Odysseus. Similar to the mythology and archaic material within the Greek works, Lewis also enjoyed Arthurian myths. Lastly, Lewis suggested that he was greatly influenced by dreams when creating the characters and situations within his works. In conclusion, Drinian is a compilation of Odysseus from the Odyssey and the heroes of the Arthurian myths.

Carl Ernst was the constructor and first owner of the hotel, which was formerly called \\"Hotel Ernst\\".  History  Eight years later, in 1871, Carl Ernst sold the hotel to Friedrich Kracht. Four years after buying the hotel, Kracht died and his wife and son, Carl Kracht, had to manage the Innenstadt hotel. Meanwhile, the hotel had become part of Cologne's better society, and in 1884, Carl Kracht was appointed Prince of the Cologne Carnival - a big honor in Cologne. From early times, the hotel had famous guests, such as German Emperor William I and American artist Andy Warhol.Excelsior Hotel Ernst on koelntourismus.de In 1889, Carl Kracht married Emma Pauline Baur of the Swiss Hoteliers family Baur, who owned both the famous Hotel Baur au Lac and the Savoy Baur en Ville. Carl Kracht and his family lived in Zurich and he managed the Hotel Baur au Lac. After his wedding, he appointed a general manager to take care of the Hotel Ernst's operations. From 1908 to 1910 the Hotel Ernst was rebuilt and re-opened as Grand-Hotel Excelsior Hotel Ernst with at the time unparalleled comfort: 100 rooms out of 250 had a private bathroom. In 1918, after World War I, the British Army moved into the hotel and used it as their headquarters during the occupation of the Rhineland. On 31 December 1926 Excelsior Hotel Ernst celebrated its second re-opening after the British army left. During World War II, a part of the hotel was damaged and the owner family was very concerned to rebuild it as soon as the war was over. So, another re-opening took place after the end of World War II. In 1986 a new wing was constructed, the \\"Neubau\\", with 29 rooms and suites. All renovations were done under the supervision of the interior designer Count Siegwart Pilati. In addition to French cuisine restaurant Hanse Stube, a second restaurant was opened in 2001: the taku, offers Asian cuisine in a contemporary atmosphere. In 2007, 45 rooms were turned into 35 more spacious rooms in the \\"Hanse Fl√ºgel\\".

Most commonly this causes skin symptoms (usually livedo reticularis), gangrene of the extremities and sometimes kidney failure; problems with other organs may arise, depending on the site at which the cholesterol crystals enter the bloodstream. When the kidneys are involved, the disease is referred to as atheroembolic renal disease. The diagnosis usually involves biopsy (removing a tissue sample) from an affected organ. Cholesterol embolism is treated by removing the cause and giving supportive therapy; statin drugs have been found to improve the prognosis. Signs and symptoms The symptoms experienced in cholesterol embolism depend largely on the organ involved. Non-specific symptoms often described are fever, muscle ache and weight loss. Embolism to the legs causes a mottled appearance and purple discoloration of the toes, small infarcts and areas of gangrene due to tissue death that usually appear black, and areas of the skin that assume a marbled pattern known as livedo reticularis. The pain is usually severe and requires opiates. If the ulcerated plaque is below the renal arteries the manifestations appear in both lower extremities. Very rarely the ulcerated plaque is below the aortic bifurcation and those cases the changes occur only in one lower extremity. Kidney involvement leads to the symptoms of kidney failure, which are non-specific but usually cause nausea, reduced appetite (anorexia), raised blood pressure (hypertension), and occasionally the various symptoms of electrolyte disturbance such as an irregular heartbeat. Some patients report hematuria (bloody urine) but this may only be detectable on microscopic examination of the urine. Increased amounts of protein in the urine may cause edema (swelling) of the skin (a combination of symptoms known as nephrotic syndrome). If emboli have spread to the digestive tract, reduced appetite, nausea and vomiting may occur, as well as nonspecific abdominal pain, gastrointestinal hemorrhage (vomiting blood, or admixture of blood in the stool), and occasionally acute pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). Both the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system may be involved. Emboli to the brain may cause stroke-like episodes, headache and episodes of loss of vision in one eye (known as amaurosis fugax). Emboli to the eye can be seen by ophthalmoscopy and are known as plaques of Hollenhorst. Emboli to the spinal cord may cause paraparesis (decreased power in the legs) or cauda equina syndrome, a group of symptoms due to loss of function of the distal part of the spinal cord - loss of control over the bladder, rectum and skin sensation around the anus. If the blood supply to a single nerve is interrupted by an embolus, the result is loss of function in the muscles supplied by that nerve; this phenomenon is called a mononeuropathy. Causes It is relatively unusual (25% of the total number of cases) for cholesterol emboli to occur spontaneously; this usually happens in people with severe atherosclerosis of the large arteries such as the aorta. In the other 75% it is a complication of medical procedures involving the blood vessels, such as vascular surgery or angiography. In coronary catheterization, for instance, the incidence is 1.4%. Furthermore, cholesterol embolism may develop after the commencement of anticoagulants or thrombolytic medication that decrease blood clotting or dissolve blood clots, respectively. They probably lead to cholesterol emboli by removing blood clots that cover up a damaged atherosclerotic plaque; cholesterol-rich debris can then enter the bloodstream. Diagnosis Micrograph of a cholesterol embolus showing the characteristic cholesterol clefts (biconvex white spaces) and a giant cell reaction. Kidney biopsy. H&E; stain. Differential diagnosis Findings on general investigations (such as blood tests) are not specific for cholesterol embolism, which makes diagnosis difficult. The main problem is the distinction between cholesterol embolism and vasculitis (inflammation of the small blood vessels), which may cause very similar symptoms - especially the skin findings and the kidney dysfunction. Worsening kidney function after an angiogram may also be attributed to kidney damage by substances used during the procedure (contrast nephropathy). Other causes that may lead to similar symptoms include ischemic kidney failure (kidney dysfunction due to an interrupted blood supply), a group of diseases known as thrombotic microangiopathies and endocarditis (infection of the heart valves with small clumps of infected tissue embolizing through the body). Blood and urine Tests for inflammation (C-reactive protein and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate) are typically elevated, and abnormal liver enzymes may be seen. If the kidneys are involved, tests of kidney function (such as urea and creatinine) are elevated. The complete blood count may show particularly high numbers of a type of white blood cell known as eosinophils (more than 0.5 billion per liter); this occurs in only 60-80% of cases, so normal eosinophil counts do not rule out the diagnosis. Examination of the urine may show red blood cells (occasionally in casts as seen under the microscope) and increased levels of protein; in a third of the cases with kidney involvement, eosinophils can also be detected in the urine. If vasculitis is suspected, complement levels may be determined as reduced levels are often encountered in vasculitis; complement is a group of proteins that forms part of the innate immune system. Complement levels are frequently reduced in cholesterol embolism, limiting the use of this test in the distinction between vasculitis and cholesterol embolism. Tissue diagnosis The microscopic examination of tissue (histology) gives the definitive diagnosis. The diagnostic histopathologic finding is intravascular cholesterol crystals, which are seen as cholesterol clefts in routinely processed tissue (embedded in paraffin wax). The cholesterol crystals may be associated with macrophages, including giant cells, and eosinophils. The sensitivity of small core biopsies is modest, due to sampling error, as the process is often patchy. Affected organs show the characteristic histologic changes in 50-75% of the clinically diagnosed cases. Non-specific tissue findings suggestive of a cholesterol embolization include ischemic changes, necrosis and unstable-appearing complex atherosclerotic plaques (that are cholesterol-laden and have a thin fibrous cap). While biopsy findings may not be diagnostic, they have significant value, as they help exclude alternate diagnoses, e.g. vasculitis, that often cannot be made confidently based on clinical criteria. Treatment Treatment of an episode of cholesterol emboli is generally symptomatic, i.e. it deals with the symptoms and complications but cannot reverse the phenomenon itself. In kidney failure resulting from cholesterol crystal emboli, statins (medication that reduces cholesterol levels) have been shown to halve the risk of requiring hemodialysis. History The phenomenon of embolisation of cholesterol was first recognized by the Danish pathologist Dr. Peter Ludvig Panum and published in 1862. Further evidence that eroded atheroma was the source of emboli came from American pathologist Dr. Curtis M. Flory, who in 1945 reported the phenomenon in 3.4% of a large autopsy series of older individuals with severe atherosclerosis of the aorta.

History The band was established in September 2007 as the Fife Constabulary Pipe Band, and was placed in the senior grade by the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association in February the following year. Their first competition, at the Dunbar Highland Games in May 2008, saw them awarded first prize. In August of the same year they made their first appearance at the World Pipe Band Championships and gained entry into the grade one final, having achieved second place among fourteen bands in the morning qualifying round. The first Pipe Major was James Murray, with Andrew Mathieson starting as Pipe Sergeant, both having left Grade 1 band Shotts and Dykehead. When James Murray announced he was to emigrate to Australia, Mathieson took over as Pipe Major. Douglas Murray became Pipe Major in July 2013 after Andrew Mathieson stepped down, citing time constraints as a result of increasing family commitments and his work with the junior band. In September 2008 the drum corps was replaced by that of the Clan Gregor Society Pipe Band, resulting in the disbandment of the Clan Gregor band. Following the merger of Scottish territorial forces and the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency into Police Scotland, the band's name was changed from the Fife Constabulary Pipe Band to the Police Scotland Fife Pipe Band. Results The band received its first placing in a Major championship when in 2011 it was placed 6th in the Scottish Pipe Band Championships. In 2012 and 2013, the band was placed mid-table in most of the Major championships. 2018 has been the most successful season to date. The Band finished in the top 6 in all major championships, placed 6th at the Worlds with 3rd place in the MSR final and finished 5th in the Champions of Champions table for 2018. http://www.rspba.org/results/displaybanddetail.php?Year=2018&Band;=Police Scotland Fife Concerts The Police Scotland Fife Pipe Band celebrated their 10years jubilee with the first major concert in Aberdeen - \\"Decade on the Beat\\".

Auburn was a steel-hulled freighter built for the United States Shipping Board (USSB) at Chester, Pennsylvania, by the Chester Shipbuilding Company and completed in 1918. She was delivered to the Navy by the USSB for service in the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS). Assigned the identification number 3842, Auburn was commissioned at Philadelphia on the afternoon of 24 January 1919, Lieutenant Commander Fred L. Moulton, USNRF, in command. Two days later, the cargo ship got underway for New York harbor; proceeded down Delaware Bay; and ultimately dropped anchor off Tompkinsville, Staten Island, on the morning of 27 January. After initially shifting to Bush Terminal pier, South Brooklyn, on the 29th, she moored at pier 61, North River, New York City, on 2 February. There, she loaded 5,236 tons of general cargo (including a large quantity of wheat flour) and prepared for her maiden voyage. However, her engineers discovered several split condenser tubes in her boilers before the trip could begin, and an inspection board convened and visited the ship on 15 February. After a brief period of repairs, Auburn shifted to pier 16, South Brooklyn, on the 17th. By that point, the Navy had apparently decided to demobilize the ship; and, on the afternoon of 22 February 1919, representatives of the USSB accepted custody of the ship when she was decommissioned. Auburn's subsequent career, like hers under the aegis of NOTS, was brief. She remained in the USSB fleet into the early 1930s, very probably laid up due to postwar austerity measures in the American merchant marine. Then, around 1932-1933, she was \\"abandoned . . . due to age and deterioration.\\" Category:1918 ships Category:Cargo ships of the United States Navy Category:Ships built in Chester, Pennsylvania Category:World War I cargo ships of the United States ","title":"USS Auburn (ID-3842)"},{"id":"17621029","text":"Chakraval Daily is a Khmer language newspaper published in Cambodia with its headquarters in Phnom Penh.

Opened in 1992, it was built for the 1994 Winter Olympics. The venue consists of three hills‚Äîone each for aerials, moguls and ski ballet. The moguls hill has a capacity for 12,000 spectators while the other two have a 15,000-person capacity. The arena is designated as Norway's national venue for freestyle skiing. It hosted the FIS Freestyle Skiing World Cup in 1993 and 1995, and is scheduled to host freestyle skiing and snowboarding at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics. The arena is owned by Lillehammer Olympiapark and is located adjacent to the ski jumping hill Lysg√•rdsbakken. Construction The ski lift Kanthaugen has traditionally served as a recreational area for Lillehammer, and has in particular been used for alpine skiing. In 1946, Norway's then-largest ski lift was installed between Stampesletta and Kanthaugen.F√•berg Historielag (1999): 120 It remained in use until the late 1970s. At the time of the closing, a local businessman proposed that it be renovated and that a tobogganing slide be built from Kanthaugen to Stampesletta. The plans were met by local opposition and were not carried through.F√•berg Historielag (1999): 206 Venue planning started after Lillehammer was awarded the Olympics in 1988. In the bid, Kanthaugen had been envisaged as the site of the sliding center. In 1989, the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) proposed that the ski jumping hill and ski stadium instead be located there. Placing venues at Kanthaugen was controversial, as it would result in permanent encroachments in the one of the town's main recreational areas.F√•berg Historielag (1999): 231 Ultimately, only the freestyle arena and ski jump were placed at Kanthaugen, with the ski stadium placed further away from town.F√•berg Historielag (1993): 67 Kanthaugen Freestyle Arena was along with Lysg√•rdsbakken designed by √òkaw Arkitekter. The area development plan was passed in August 1991. The responsibility for construction originally rested on Lillehammer Municipality, but LOOC took over responsibility in November 1991.LOOC (III): 23 The decision to include aerials in the Olympic program was made in October 1992. Tore L√∏kke was selected as the main contractor. Construction cost 20.3 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which NOK 3.3 million was paid for by the municipality and NOK 17 million was paid for by LOOC. The venue was completed in the fall of 1992 and was the first freestyle skiing arena in the world to feature a common spectator area for all three event hills. The temporary structures used during the Olympics were completed in December 1993. A jibbing park was installed in 2008. Facilities Philippe LaRoche during the men's moguls at the 1994 Winter Olympics The venue consists of three hills, each tailor-made for aerials, moguls and ski ballet, respectively. Above the Olympic hills is a long tobogganing hill which uses the competitive area as a finish. At the base of the hill is the spectator area, which featured temporary bleachers during the Olympics. The spectator capacity for aerials and ski ballet is 15,000, while it is 12,000 for moguls. Also at the foot of the hill is a jury tower overlooking the aerials hill. The venue is equipped with snowmaking equipment, a T-bar lift and floodlights. The arena is located next to the ski jumping hill Lysg√•rdsbakken, with which it shares some broadcasting and telecommunications facilities. During the Olympics, of temporary buildings, including tents, were erected at the venue. Kanthaugen is one kilometer (half a mile) east of Lillehammer's town center and owned and operated by Lillehammer Olympiapark, a subsidiary of Lillehammer Municipality.

It also hosted the Norwegian Freestyle Skiing Championships in 1993 and 1996. Lillehammer is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, with Kanthaugen to host freestyle skiing and half-pipe snowboarding. The venue is designated a Norway's national freestyle skiing venue and is the main training ground for the national team. The area around the venue is a popular recreational area for Lillehammer. Since 1995, Lillehammer Olympiapark has rented out toboggans for use in the hill, including use of the ski lift.

Emmet \\"Snags\\" Heidrick (July 29, 1876https://www.mlb.com/player/emmet- heidrick-115702 ‚Äì January 20, 1916) was an outfielder in Major League Baseball from 1898 to 1908. He played for the Cleveland Spiders, St. Louis Cardinals, and St. Louis Browns. He was known as a good defensive player who hit for a high batting average but he missed a great deal of playing time due to injuries. Heidrick stood out among early baseball players because he came from a wealthy family. His father, Levi Heidrick, was a successful businessman, and his son, Gardner Heidrick, co-founded an executive search firm. Biography Heidrick came from an affluent family. His father Levi owned a successful lumber business. Heidrick's background was even noted on an early-career scouting report about him, with the scout opining that Heidrick did not need to play baseball to earn money. He had a strong throwing arm and good defensive ability. After spending his first major-league season with the Cleveland Spiders in 1898. Frank Robison and Stanley Robison had purchased the St. Louis Perfectos after the 1898 season but had not given up control of the Spiders. Feeling that a good team could draw better attendance in St. Louis than in Cleveland, the Robison brothers traded Heidrick and several other Spiders players to the Perfectos. The 1899 Perfectos finished in fifth place that year, while the Spiders had the worst record in baseball history, 20-134. Early in his career, he hit for a high batting average and he was fast. Injuries usually caused him to miss at least 20 games in each season. Fans and teammates often felt that Heidrick's heart was not in baseball. Though he often had physicians who documented his injuries, he seemed to be injured more often during the hot summer months. In 1901, Heidrick's father accidentally killed himself when he knocked over a loaded gun in his closet at home. Before the 1902 season, Heidrick was part of a dispute that was heard before the Supreme Court of Missouri. Heidrick, Bobby Wallace and Jack Harper signed with the St. Louis Browns, but Frank Robison claimed to still have them under contract. Robison took the matter of Wallace's contract to court. The Supreme Court of Missouri ruled against Robison, and the ruling was understood to apply to the other two players as well. After three years with the Browns, Heidrick retired in 1904 and joined the lumber business run by his family. He returned to the field with the Browns briefly in 1908. As late as 1911, he was playing for a local team in Brookville, Pennsylvania. In 757 games played, Heidrick batted .300 (914-3047) with 468 runs scored, 16 home runs, 342 RBI, 186 stolen bases, an on-base percentage of .333 and slugging percentage of .399 in eight seasons. Heidrick died of influenza in 1916. His son Gardner was one of the two founders of the executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles.

His surname was, in all probability, the result of misspelling the Cornish surname \\"Quintrell\\". He was the last of the mutineers to be murdered on Pitcairn Island. He was murdered or executed by Ned Young and John Adams, leaving them the last two mutineers alive on the island. Quintal was the first crew member punished by flogging \\"for insolence and mutinous behaviour.\\" He readily joined the mutiny. Five days after landing on Pitcairn Island, Quintal burned the Bounty, before the settlers had had a chance to remove everything of value from the ship, as a safety precaution to avoid the ship giving their location away to the British Navy. It is not known if he took the action on his own or if he was ordered to. He led the others in oppressing the Polynesians. On 20 September 1793, the four remaining Polynesian men stole muskets and killed Christian, Mills, Brown, Martin, and Williams. Quintal barely escaped being one of the victims by hiding in the mountains with William McCoy. McCoy discovered a means of distilling alcohol from one of the island's fruits. He and Quintal quickly descended into alcoholism, often abusing and bullying both the Polynesian men and women, including his consort Tevarua. Rosalind Young, a descendant of Ned Young, relayed a story handed down to her that Tevarua went fishing one day failed to catch enough fish to satisfy him. He punished her by biting off her ear. He may have been drunk at the time, because he and William McCoy were drunk most of the time, consuming the ti-root brandy that McCoy had succeeded in distilling. Tevarua fell ‚Äì or, some believe, killed herself by leaping ‚Äì off a cliff in 1799. After McCoy killed himself, Quintal became increasingly erratic. He demanded to take Isabella, Fletcher Christian's widow, as his wife, and threatened to kill Christian's children if his demands were not granted.

Owned by Lillehammer Municipality, it operates five sports venues: Birkebeineren Ski Stadium, H√•kons Hall, Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track, Kanthaugen Freestyle Arena and the ski jumping hill of Lysg√•rdsbakken. In addition to serving sports events, the company provides tourist and group activities at the venues as well as catering to larger events. In the Lillehammer bid for the 1994 Winter Olympics, the agreement between Lillehammer Municipality and the state specified that the municipality was responsible for financing all necessary sports venues. However, after the games were awarded the responsibility was taken over by Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) and the town's five venues were ultimately funded through state grants. To allow for post-Olympic use, a fund was created by the state, of which Lillehammer Olympiapark received 146 million Norwegian krone (NOK). Unlike the Hamar venues, which survive on their fund's yield, the Lillehammer venues have used up their capital. From 2014 the post-Olympic use fund will be depleted and alternative organization and funding is being looked into. A leading proposal is that the bobsleigh and luge track be taken over by the state, while the remaining venues be retained by the company and jointly funded by the municipality and Oppland County Municipality. History Lysg√•rdsbakken As part of the 1985 and 1987 agreements with the Parliament of Norway ahead of the 1994 Winter Olympics bid, Lillehammer Municipality was responsible for financing and building all Olympic venues and associated facilities. To fulfill their obligation, the municipality established Lillehammer Olympiske Anlegg (LOA) in 1989. Mr. Haavind was hired as the company's first managing director. At the same time the Post-Olympics Use Committee was established to ensure activity at the venues after the Olympics. LOA's first task was, in cooperation with local and national authorities and LOOC, to decide on locations and budgets.LOOC (I): 19 By 1989, political discussions had started regarding the creation of a fund to finance post- Olympic use. The sledding track, especially, would incur high operating costs, estimated at between NOK 5 and 6 million per year. Total deficits for the five Lillehammer venues were in 1990 estimated at ca. NOK 15 million per year. Initially the government offered to grant NOK 55 million for the fund, but the Post-Olympic Use Committee estimated that NOK 215 million would be necessary. They further proposed that the capital could be used as share capital in the proposed company Olympia Vekst, which would be jointly privately and publicly owned and operate the venues. The budgets were reviewed by Parliament on 23 April 1990. They also decided to re-organize the Olympics into a concern model, which saw both LOA and the Post-Olympics Use Committees becoming subsidiaries of LOOC, and the Post-Olympics Use Committees changing its name to Lillehammer Olympiavekst (LOV). Separate companies were established to construct the venues in Hamar and Gj√∏vik, owned by the respective municipalities. The municipal governments of √òyer and Ringebu each received a 24.5-percent stake in LOV. Lillehammer Municipality gained a 24.5-percent stake in the new holding company, Lillehammer '94 AS. Gerhard Heiberg, President of LOOC, was appointed chair of both LOV and LOA.LOOC (I): 20 LOV was given the responsibility for operating the venues after the Olympics. LOOC and the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development started negotiations concerning the fund in October 1990. The government increased the fund size to NOK 130 million in January 1991, as well as allocating NOK 70 of the reserve funding to post-Olympic use. Lillehammer Municipality stated that they wanted a disproportionate share of the funding, but this was rejected by Minister Kjell Borgen. The fund would be insufficient, which caused a conflict between the five municipalities. Gj√∏vik and Hamar chose not to take an ownership stake in LOV as they did not want a Lillehammer-based company to manage the towns' main venues. At the same time, Lillehammer Municipality did not want the two other towns to own part of LOV, as they hoped the entire fund would be used to finance the five venues in Lillehammer. Gj√∏vik and Hamar took steps to create their own joint venture to operate their three arenas, while Borgen stated that all the venues should be allocated to one company. Ringebu Mayor Erik Winther stated that he felt that his municipality had been tricked into joining LOV and that they were not allowed to participate as an equal partner. Haavind was replaced by Bj√∏rn Sund in 1991. The post-use funds were distributed such that LOA received NOK 76 million. It also acquired a thirty- percent stake in Hamar Olympiske Anlegg, which operates Vikingskipet and Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre in Hamar, and Gj√∏vik Olympiske Anlegg, which operates Gj√∏vik Olympic Cavern Hall in Gj√∏vik. Lillehammer was the only of the five host municipalities to not use municipal grants to build their venues. By late 1991, LOOC desired a closer cooperation, resulting in a merger between LOA and Lillehammer '94 which took the latter's name.LOOC (I): 21 By 1 January 1993 also LOV and LOOC had also been merged to a single entity.LOOC (I): 21 Planning of post-Olympic use and demobilization started in early 1993.LOOC (I): 23 Kurt Nilsen performing at H√•kons Hall during Idrettsgallaen 2010 LOOC transferred the ownership of the Olympic venues in Lillehammer to the municipality for NOK 1 million on 7 September 1993. By then the government had increased the post-Olympic fund to NOK 200 million. Ownership of the Hamar and Gj√∏vik venues had previously been transferred to the respective municipal governments. The fund was established in September and is managed by a separate foundation, Stiftelsen Lillehammer Etterbruksfond. Additional capital for the fund was secured through LOOC's financial buffers not being used and the surplus transferred to the funds. In June 1994 the fund was set to NOK 401.3 million. Minister of Local Government and Regional Development, Gunnar Berge, stated in January 1995 that he was concerned that the post-Olympic use funds were being used up too quickly and that money was being used for unsuitable projects. However, he rejected that the state should take control over the venues or the money. After one year, Lillehammer Olympiapark had used NOK 32 of 146 million, while the company Olympia Utvikling/Troll Park had used NOK 14 of 95 million. For the Lillehammer companies, this meant that the fund was estimated to run out after ten instead of twenty years. In contrast, Hamar Olympiske Anlegg had only used the fund's yield. LOOC criticized the post- Olympic use companies, stating that they were too bureaucratic, that their combined 100 employees were too many, and that one or two companies would be sufficient. By 1999, Lillehammer Olympiapark had an annual revenue of NOK 20 million, of which a third came from the fund. Commercial activities contributed half the revenue, while the remaining fraction came from sports activities. Between 80 and 90 percent of the rental time went to sports activities. A report published by Lillehammer University College in 2007 concluded that all the 260 permanent jobs created in the Lillehammer area as a result of the Olympics were directly dependent on subsidies from the post- Olympic use funds. In the late 2000s, Lillehammer Olympiapark was using between NOK 8 and 12 million per year. There was NOK 25 million left in the fund in 2012, which was scheduled to be closed in 2014, after it has served for 20 years. Lillehammer Olympiapark started planning the organization of the venues in 2010. The company recommended that the subsidies be equally funded between Lillehammer Municipality, Oppland County Municipality and the Ministry of Culture. Specifically it recommended that the state take over ownership of the bobsleigh and luge track, while the county took partial ownership of Lillehammer Olympiapark. The state would thus continue to finance the track, which is the only such venue in Northern Europe, while the municipality and county finance the other four venues. The venues are recommended held to such a standard that they can host world cup and world championships in relevant sports. Operations As of 2010, the company had a revenue of NOK 56 million, up NOK 10 million from 2009, yielding a profit of NOK 2 million. The company employed between 51 and 55 people, it is based at H√•kons Hall and is entirely owned by Lillehammer Municipality. The company's revenue comes from a series of sources, the most important being events and tourists. At Lysg√•rdsbakken, the company operates a chairlift and viewing platform at the top of the tower, as well as a downhill and bobsleigh simulator. The company tailors events to companies with various activities at the hill, including a ceremony to light to Olympic Flame. Kanthaugen and its lift is rented out for tobogganing. The sledding track serves groups and tourists with activities such as wheelbob and for-man bobsleigh with an authorized pilot, bobrafting, skeleton and skeleton rafting. Next to the track is an activity park with activities such as snowmobile and all-terrain vehicle tracks. Venues Birkebeineren Ski Stadium The arena covers an area of ,LOOC (III): 33 and is from the town center.LOOC (III): 31 For the Olympics, of cross-country tracks and of biathlon tracks were built.

Typically, a vestibule has doorways on either side to allow passenger entry and egress at stations, a door into the body of the car, and, at the car end, a doorway to allow access to the next car through a flexible gangway connection. The first vestibuled train was introduced on June 15, 1887, on the inaugural run of the Pennsylvania Limited of the Pennsylvania Railroad, forerunner of the famous Broadway Limited. The railway car vestibule as a concept had been tried in various primitive forms during the latter part of the 19th century, but the first viable form was invented by H. H. Sessions and his staff at the Pullman Car Works in Chicago. Sessions' patent was challenged by others and reduced in litigation to the spring mechanism of his vestibule design. Further litigation by Pullman was successful in modifying the earlier rulings. Prior to the development of vestibules, passage between cars when a train was underway was both dangerous --stepping over a shifting plate between swaying cars with nothing on either side but chain guard rails--and unpleasant, due to being exposed to the weather, as well as soot, red-hot cinders and fly ash raining down from the exhaust of the steam locomotive hauling the train. As passengers were mostly confined to a single car during the trip, trains had regular meal stops built into their schedules, and sleeping cars were uncommon. The introduction of the vestibuled train in the late nineteenth century led to dining cars, lounge cars, and other specialized cars.Douglas, p. 219 Vestibuled cars allowed the development of luxury trains during the golden age of rail travel, trains like the Union Pacific's Overland Limited (1890), the Pennsylvania Railroad's Pennsylvania Limited (later renamed the Pennsylvania Special, then the Broadway Limited), and the New York Central's 20th Century Limited (1902). The Southern's Crescent was introduced in 1891 as the Washington and Southwestern Vestibuled Limited, and widely known as The Vestibule because it was the first all-year train south of Washington with vestibuled equipment.

It has a population of 138,Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Doncaster Retrieved 2009-08-27 increasing slightly to 146 at the 2011 Census. It was in the historical county of the West Riding and is listed in the Domesday Book (Domesday Book 307d) compiled in 1086 at the command of William the Conqueror at reference 307d. During feudal times, and even beyond, the manor was the basic administrative unit of the kingdom. The lord would be granted the land by a higher magnate in return for services - and that magnate would in turn receive his land from someone higher, all the way up to the king. Some manors were owned by abbeys, which were powerful landowners. Marr stands on the main road between Barnsley and Doncaster (A635 Barnsley Road) and also 5 minutes drive from the A1 (M) junction 37. Marr, although now mainly modern, does have a number of outstanding features; there remains an Iron Age barrow at the junction of Barnburgh, Marr and High Melton which can be seen through aerial photographs. Seventy Roman coins were found recently as evidence of the boundary line which Marr formed at Rickneild Street. The Gothic-style church of St Helens has original herringbone masonry, early Norman chancel and nave, 13th/14th century short spire tower, 15th stone-ribbed porch and font and the pulpit has fine medieval woodwork. The church also contains figures of John Lewis and wife dated from 1579 in Brass and pieces of funeral armour. There are two further buildings of note in the Marr Hall Farm. Parts of the farm buildings are original (1800s) and fairly unusual, the Hall itself retains an Elizabethan/ Jacobean west side with a semi-circular entrance porch. This building is now the farmhouse and has a Georgian style overall. The farm also maintains over 14 arched openings which would have been used for storage of carts, drays etc. The arches stand on solid stone piers and is thought to have been designed by Charles Sabine Augustus Thellusson an Italian architect who died in 1885. The story of how Charles Thellusson (The Landed Gentry, Burke pages 598-600) gained control over the Brodsworth Estate (including the farm) is a saga in itself. The Thellusson family was involved in a long-running feud over inheritance money and Brodsworth Estates belonging originally to Peter Thellusson, a city merchant who died leaving the equivalent of ¬£50 million in trust (see Thellusson Will Case). The money was put aside to gather interest during his own lifetime and the lifetime of his sons and grandsons (who were living at the time of his own death) only to be divided up between his remaining male descendants when the last of his three sons/grandsons died. The will and its subsequent litigation case (brought by his family) may even have inspired Charles Dickens for Bleak House (Jarndyce v Jarndyce) such was the controversy.

Background Voy Por Ustedes is owned by Sir Robert Ogden and trained by Nicky Henderson. He was originally trained by Guillaume Macaire in France and was subsequently sold to the Million in Mind Partnership in December 2004. Racing career The horse made his French debut when unseating his rider in a 3-year-old hurdle at Compeigne in France in September 2004 and raced four more times in France. Voy Por Ustedes made his English debut at Lingfield on the 11 December 2004, when still trained by Guillaume Macaire and unseated his rider in a Grade 2 Novice Hurdle. Million in Mind then purchased the gelding as a replacement for Massac, who was trained for the Partnership by Alan King. Massac died in a fall at Cheltenham - the same day that Voy por Ustedes unseated his rider at Lingfield.. As with all Million in Mind Partnership horses, Voy por Ustedes was sold by auction at the Doncaster Bloodstock Sales at the end of the National Hunt Season in May 2005. He was purchased by Sir Robert Ogden for 106,000 guineas, and remained in training with Alan King at Burbury Castle until 2011 when he moved to the yard of Nicky Henderson. Steeplechasing Vor Por Ustedes made his chasing debut at Warwick on 5 November 2005 and won in impressive style and proceeded to win three more novice chases at Plumpton, Warwick and Wincanton before winning the Arkle Challenge Trophy at the 2006 Cheltenham Festival defeating Monets Garden. His final run of the season was at Aintree but lost his unbeaten record over fences when finishing 2nd to Foreman. His first run of the 2006‚Äì07 season was in the Grade 1 Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown but he was easily brushed aside by Kauto Star but still ran well to finish a clear 2nd. He won his next race at Kempton in December before unseating his rider at Newbury but made up for that slip-up when winning the Queen Mother Champion Chase at the Cheltenham Festival. That was his last run of the 2006/07 season but was more aggressively trained in the 2007‚Äì08 season and finished 2nd in desperate conditions at Cheltenham in November 2007 before again finishing second to Twist Magic in the Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown. He then went on to win the Desert Orchid Chase for the second time at Kempton then completing his preparation for the 2008 Queen Mother Champion Chase when a well beaten second to Master Minded at Newbury. There wasn't to be a second victory in the Queen Mother Champion Chase as Master Minded put up one of the most impressive performances of all time when slamming Voy Por Ustedes by 19 lengths though Voy Por Ustedes still finished 16 lengths ahead of the third horse and possibly put up a better performance than when winning in 2007. He gained his revenge over Master Minded when running away with the Melling Chase at Aintree in what was his first run over 2m 4f and the step-up in trip obviously brought out considerable improvement. This was his last run of the 2007‚Äì08 season.

He is one of the founding fathers of econophysics. Education Stanley obtained his B.A. in physics at Wesleyan University in 1962. He performed biological physics research with Max Delbr√ºck in 1963 and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University in 1967. Stanley was a Miller Fellow at University of California, Berkeley with Charles Kittel, where he wrote an Oxford monograph Introduction to Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena which won the Choice Award for Outstanding Academic Book of 1971. Academic career Stanley was appointed Assistant Professor of Physics at MIT in 1969 and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1971. He was appointed Hermann von Helmholtz Associate Professor in 1973, in recognition of his interdepartmental teaching and research with the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology. In 1976, Stanley joined Boston University as Professor of Physics, and Associate Professor of Physiology (in the School of Medicine). In 1978 and 1979, he was promoted to Professor of Physiology and University Professor, respectively. Since 2007 he holds joint appointments with the Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering Departments. In 2011, he was made William F. Warren Distinguished Professor. In the spring of 2013, he will hold the Lorentz Professorship at the University of Leiden. Research and achievements Stanley had fundamental contributions to several topics in statistical physics, such as the theory of phase transitions, percolation, disordered systems, aggregation phenomena, polymers, econophysics and biological physics.

In 1992 he developed the liquid-liquid critical point hypothesis, that offered a quantitative understanding of water‚Äôs anomalies, applying to all liquids with tetrahedral symmetry (such as silicon and silica). Direct experimental proof for his proposal was obtained by recent experiments in Tsukuba, MIT, and Stanford. Stanley coined the term ‚Äòeconophysics‚Äô in 1994 to denote the field of physics dealing with economic phenomena. His group has found empirical laws governing economic fluctuations, and proposed statistical mechanics models to explain their origins. The ISI Web of Science, lists 76,778 citations to Stanley's work (excluding 33 books). Using the Hirsch H Index metric for publication impact [PNAS 102, 16569 (2005)], Stanley has authored 129 papers with a citation count equal to or greater than 129, so H = 129. Google Scholar lists 134,130 citations, of which 162 have a citation count equal to or greater than 162, so H = 162. Stanley is committed to education at all levels, from high school to graduate studies. He has served as thesis advisor to 114 Ph.D. students and has collaborated with 211 postdoctoral fellows and visiting faculty. He is also active in worldwide efforts for achieving gender balance in the physical sciences. Honors and awards Stanley has been elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (2004), the Brazilian Academy of Sciences. He is an Honorary Member of the Hungarian Physical Society. He is currently Honorary Professor at the Institute for Advanced Studies, University of Pavia (Pavia, Italy), and at E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University (Budapest, Hungary). Stanley awarded the 2004 APS Nicholson Medal for Humanitarian Service, \\"For his extraordinary contributions to human rights, for his initiatives on behalf of female physicists, and for his caring and supportive relationship with those who have worked in his laboratory.\\"aps.org For his contributions to phase transitions Stanley received the 2004 Boltzmann Medal, awarded by International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), and the American Physical Society 2008 Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize.

Imaged from Family History Library microfilm. Lynn accepted an appointment as a prohibition agent assigned to the town of Cromwell, Oklahoma. Prohibition agent, Cromwell, Oklahoma In 1924, Cromwell was a seedy and extremely dangerous town, which thrived on the many brothels and saloons that were located there. The town was out of control by that time, with no law in force. Wiley Lynn, the prohibition agent assigned to the area, was a big part of the problem. For a number of years, Lynn worked deals with bootleggers and other illegal factions, keeping them out of jail in exchange for money paid to him. Bill Tilghman, a former Deputy US Marshal, was retired from law enforcement by 1910, and was 70 years old in 1924. However, he had a stellar reputation, and was a legend for his part in bringing down the Doolin Dalton Gang in the 1890s. Tilghman had been elected to the Oklahoma Senate. He also accepted the position of police chief of Oklahoma City in 1911. In 1915, he co-wrote, directed, and starred in the movie The Passing of the Oklahoma Outlaws, which dramatized the law enforcement activities of Tilghman and the other members of the Three Guardsmen, which included Heck Thomas and Chris Madsen. The film is noted as an early attempt to de-glamorize the image of outlaws. In 1924, Tilghman accepted a position as marshal of Cromwell, Oklahoma, to \\"clean up the town\\". From early on in the job, he and Lynn were clearly rivals. Tilghman made several arrests for prohibition violations, only to have Lynn step in and set his prisoners free. Despite Tilghman suspecting Lynn, he had no definite proof with which to expose Lynn. Tilghman had been welcomed in by the towns non-criminal element, but was not popular with the brothel and saloon owners or patrons. On November 1, 1924, Tilghman was seated inside Murphy's Cafe with a friend and his Deputy Marshal, Hugh Sawyer. Wiley Lynn pulled up outside in a vehicle along with prostitute Eva Caton and her companion, a US Army sergeant named Thompson, as well as prostitute Rose Lutke. Lynn exited the vehicle, and discharged his pistol into the street. He was obviously intoxicated, and Tilghman immediately responded. Tilghman grabbed Lynn, and along with Sawyer disarmed him. However, Lynn had a second pistol which he quickly drew and shot Tilghman twice in the stomach and chest at point blank range. Tilghman slumped, then fell into the street. Wiley Lynn then fled the scene, turning himself in at the Federal District Headquarters in Holdenville, Oklahoma, pleading self defense. Deputy Hugh Sawyer never fired a shot. If Sawyer had been a more experienced deputy, Lynn would have likely been killed on the spot. However, Deputy Marshal Sawyer was inexperienced, and froze when the shot was fired, watching Lynn as he fled, then going to Tilghman's aid. He also later testified that he could not see clearly exactly what happened. Remarkably, Lynn was acquitted after a trial. One key eyewitness failed to appear in court for the trial, having fled to Florida after being threatened and in fear of his life if he testified. The witness did write a letter to former U.S. Marshal Evett Dumas Nix, in Guthrie, Oklahoma, in which he stated there was no doubt what he saw, and that there was no doubt that Wiley Lynn murdered Tilghman. However, a letter would not suffice. Also, eyewitness Rose Lutke had disappeared, and never resurfaced. To make matters worse for the prosecution, Deputy Marshal Hugh Sawyer, whether he was coerced or incompetent, testified that he could not see clearly as to what actually happened. One month after the murder, the town of Cromwell was burned to the ground, with every brothel and saloon being torched. There was no investigation into the arson, and no arrests were made. It was always suspected that lawmen who were friends to Tilghman torched the town. Cromwell never recovered, dwindling to just over 300 residents. Shootout in Madill Wiley Lynn survived the trial, and amazingly continued to work in his prohibition agent position for a very short time, but eventually lost his job. He was married, and had two sons, but his life went into a downward spiral after the Tilghman shooting. His wife took their children and left him. He was arrested several times for drunkenness in Wewoka, Oklahoma and Shawnee, Oklahoma, as well as other minor offenses. Years passed, and by 1932 he was in Madill, Oklahoma, living five miles out of town with his parents. He clashed on more than one occasion with Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation Agent Crockett Long, who was assigned to that area, and who had made no secret that he disliked Lynn, Long having known and been friends with Tilghman. Agent Long arrested Lynn several times, and Lynn blamed Long for his failure to be hired by the State Bureau of Investigations. Crockett Long had a substantial reputation for being good in a gunfight. He had previously that same year been involved in a gunfight with Pretty Boy Floyd, with Floyd escaping. On the night of July 17, Wiley Lynn came into Madill, apparently searching for night watchman John Glenn initially, with whom he'd argued previously. Lynn entered the Corner Drug Store, intoxicated, where Long was visiting with stock buyer Bill Baker, and the local undertaker Paul Watts. Lynn approached the men with his pistol in his hand, and stated to Long \\"Put 'em up, you son of a bitch, I'm going to get you sometime so it might as well be now\\". Long, who was hard of hearing, actually didn't hear Lynn at first. However, when he noticed that several store patrons were scrambling to leave the store, Long turned to see Wiley Lynn with his pistol pointed at him. Long quickly and calmly said \\"Put that gun down, Lynn\\". Despite Lynn having his pistol pointed at Long, the latter drew his own gun and the two men fired simultaneously, with witnesses saying it sounded like only one shot, despite there having been two. By that time, the store owners Forney Keller and Jack Blalock had fled, and patron Knute Turley had dropped to his hands and knees crawling outside. Rody Watkins and John Hilburn, two young men who were standing at the soda fountain, were both hit by the bullet fired by Wiley Lynn, which had passed through the body of Crockett Long. Patron W. C. Wynne was standing at the door when the shooting started, and saw the first exchange. Both men continued to fire at one another until their weapons were emptied. Both were hit five times each, at close range, and while advancing on one another. Wiley Lynn staggered out of the store and across the street to a service station, where citizen Clyde Lewis took him to a doctor. Agent Crockett Long was taken by ambulance to the Von Keller Hospital in Ardmore, Oklahoma. John Hilburn was not seriously wounded, but Rody Watkins was also rushed to the hospital. Agent Long, Wiley Lynn, and bystander Rody Watkins all died while in surgery.

Orlin Grabbe, or just JOG, was an American economist and prolific writer with contributions in the theory and practice of finance. He was known by his book International Financial Markets, and for mathematical models for options and derivatives used in international finance and foreign exchange. Grabbe wrote articles and essays about personal freedom and governmental abuse, and was an editor of Internet magazines such as the Laissez Faire City Times. Born and educated in the U.S., he pursued his business interests around the world. He died from heart failure around March 15, 2008 in San Jos√©, Costa Rica. Early life Orlin Grabbe was born October 8, 1947, in Hale County, Texas, and grew up on a farm in Briscoe County in the Texas Panhandle. He showed great academic prowess in his youth and in response, he was invited to participate in nationwide, specialized education in mathematics. Two of his brothers also achieved doctorates and became professors. His brother Lester was a professor of theology at the University of Hull in England, while his brother Crockett was a professor of physics at the University of Iowa.Crockett L. Grabbe In the fall of 1966, Grabbe joined an older brother at the Worldwide Church of God's Ambassador College, based in Pasadena, California. He graduated in 1970 and served on the teaching staff until 1973. During this time, he was the editor of the student newspaper. In his memoir, written later in his life, he described not only his own experiences and thought processes, but also the atmosphere that permeated the college, its students, and the organization as a whole. After leaving Ambassador, Grabbe enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, to pursue his interests in research and science, with an emphasis in mathematics. In 1976, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. He continued his education at Harvard University where he was awarded a Ph.D. in economics in 1981. Grabbe specialized in the study of financial derivative instruments and published important pricing models for futures, forward contracts and options, especially in the foreign exchange (FX) markets. In 1995, Grabbe moved to Reno, Nevada.  Professional career   Wharton School of Business  After graduating from Harvard, Grabbe accepted a position at the Wharton School of Business (University of Pennsylvania), working in the capacity of assistant professor in economics. Grabbe discovered that there was a lack of educational material for the emerging field of international finance and for the increased trading in financial derivatives created by this market. In 1986, he wrote International Financial Markets, which is used worldwide as an educational and professional reference of trading in derivatives. In the 1991 second edition of his International Financial Markets, Grabbe introduced the term regulatory arbitrage in the context of eurocurrency markets. One of Grabbe's students, Andrew Krieger, became a Bankers Trust FX trader and the author of The Money Bazaar.  FX Systems  As assistant professor in economics at Wharton, teaching traders, MBAs, financial regulators, policy makers, and \\"operatives of the future\\", Grabbe continued to develop the mathematical models of financial derivatives. In 1985, Grabbe transformed his informal interactions and founded FX Systems Inc. with one of his students, Farid Naib. When FX Systems continued to grow, Grabbe resigned from Wharton, in order to focus on the further development of the software. FX Systems stayed at the forefront of the emerging markets for financial derivatives, acquiring financial institutions as customers. In 1990, Grabbe sold his share of the company. The new owner, who was now partnered with Naib, ended up in disagreements, leading to a split of the company and the formation of FNX Limited, led by Naib. Until his death, Grabbe worked as a part-time consultant with FNX Limited. Under the umbrella of FNX, Grabbe created pricing models for complex derivatives, which were used by major banks around the world. FNX Limited has since become very successful in the market.  Kalliste Inc.  Based in the New York City neighborhood of Greenwich Village, Grabbe continued his professional career as a financial market consultant. He interspersed this time and furthered his interests in cultural expression by pursuing a formal education in media. In 1993, he created the company Kalliste Inc. and produced experimental films, as well as shows of fractal computer graphics. He also produced a CD, Cuba di mi Amor, featuring the Cuban pianist, Danilo Pina.  \\"The End of Ordinary Money\\"  Grabbe's cryptology-focused \\"The End of Ordinary Money\\" was published in the July 1995 edition of Liberty. In a second article, \\"Digital Cash and the Future of Money\\", Grabbe explored routes toward digital finance.  60 Minutes Grabbe was not especially impressed by the efforts of market regulators and authorities, made apparent by the textual content in his book International Financial Markets. Grabbe reported that he received information from highly credible sources about unsavory acts made by highly placed persons in the marketplace. He stated that he was approached by official representatives seeking his assistance by covertly gathering financial information from his network of customers. Grabbe responded by gathering facts about these activities, albeit from the mindset of a researcher with an intent to reveal the activities of the market manipulators. His research led him to the serious study of cryptography, in an effort to discover ways to protect individuals from interference. Some of Grabbe's investigations surrounding controversial current events, made direct contact with sources in government essential, which led to further investigations. The increasing popularity of the Internet made his articles (and essays) widely spread. Some of those published investigations are recognized today still as relevant, including his article \\"When Osama Bin Ladin Was Tim Osman\\". Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes, produced an investigative segment about misinformation on the Internet that aired on March 2, 1997. Grabbe was interviewed on the show and presented as a representation of misinformation found online. Her comments about the dangers of anyone being able to create content on the Internet, rather than relying on mass media, led to further commentary online. In parallel, Grabbe also published philosophical essays written from a libertarian/rational-anarchist viewpoint about personal freedom and the perceived increasing threats. This was exemplified in 1993, in a speech to the Eris Society, entitled \\"In Praise of Chaos\\".  Life in Costa Rica   Laissez Faire City Times  In November 1997, Orlin Grabbe was invited to edit an online weekly newspaper called the Laissez Faire City Times. The newspaper was loosely connected to the Laissez Faire City project based in Costa Rica. Grabbe relocated to Costa Rica the following year. The Laissez Faire City Times grew in prominence, with many of its articles quoted and referenced by others, some even by mainstream media and academic papers. In line with his work on Digital Finance and its dependence on cryptography, Grabbe published several articles and tutorials in the Laissez Faire City Times and on his Internet homepage. The tutorials and especially the Java Encryption Source Code have been referenced by academic institutions and scholarly papers as recommended reading.  Digital Monetary Trust  In November 1999, a series of articles in the Laissez Faire City Times presented the Digital Monetary Trust project, which was a proposed financial trust providing private, anonymous accounts for individuals and entities within the DMT system, in order to securely store anonymous capital or to make anonymous monetary transactions. :That is, the DMT will be in the business of providing privacy, and doing so in a cryptographical framework which provides a more solid basis for customer anonymity than the traditional ones of (allegedly) tight-lipped bankers or (often-leaky) banking secrecy laws. :‚ÄîOrlin Grabbe  Laissez Faire Electronic Times  In January 2002, Grabbe resigned as editor of the City Times and started a new weekly online newspaper, Laissez Faire Electronic Times, sponsored by the newly operational DMT. Grabbe continued publishing the same type of essays as before, with many of the same authors. In October 2001, he separated himself from connections to the Laissez Faire City project, which ended in spring 2002. As a consequence of the closure of Laissez Faire City, its participants dispersed and services to the group of initial users of DMT were discontinued. Both DMT and the Laissez Faire Electronic Times were discontinued in 2004. At that time, the technological viability of Grabbe's proposals had been proven, not only in theory, but also in practice. The Laissez Faire City Times and Laissez Faire Electronic Times paid writers for the right to edit and publish their articles, while each author retained the full copyright. When the publishers' sites were taken offline, in 2002 and 2004 respectively, direct access to these newspapers and all the articles ceased.Copies of some articles can still be found via search engines, or via web.archive.org, where an incomplete archive of these weekly newspapers can be found by searching for http://www.zolatimes.com , http://www.zolatimes2.com and http://freedom.orlingrabbe.com/lfetimes/lfetimes_index.htm . Many still see these newspapers as important resources for highly valuable articles of philosophical and political significance in freedom-related and especially (but not exclusively) libertarian thought.  Chaos  Throughout Grabbe's works, \\"chaos\\" remained a recurring underlying theme. The study of chaotic disorder in the form of noise in market prices, guided his works on statistically based mathematical models for option pricing. The structured disorder of fractals fascinated him deeply and led him to begin writing a series of essays about Chaos & Fractals in Financial Markets, intended to be part of a future book; a sequel to International Financial Markets. In the last years, when heart problems began to dominate his life, he wrote and published his studies on e.g. game theory in the framework of quantum mechanics, itself a mathematical model of chaos in nature. The unpredictability of random numbers was the basis for the cryptology needed for implementing the Digital Monetary Trust, as well as the basis for his politics and philosophy. The false dichotomy between Order and Chaos, where induced fears of the horrors of total chaos is the favorite tool of those who seek power to enforce their own order on others. Grabbe's position was made very clear in his own writings, as well as in his selection of articles and images from the web. His homepage was headed by deeply symbolic declarations, such as \\"Opposition to tyrants is obedience to God,\\" or the summary of his mission statement, \\"... inspecting the global underbelly: privacy, money laundering, espionage.\\" The speech In Praise of Chaos at the Eris Society, published on his Kalliste homepage was a personal declaration of independence, where if perhaps not seeking order out of chaos, at least the search of energy from the chaos was the choice apart from being subdued into lethargic subservience by the lack of entropy in stasis. Grabbe underlined the importance of this anarchistic independence repeatedly on his homepage, showing his closeness to Discordianism and Church of the SubGenius, by the headline, \\"What forbids us to tell the truth, laughingly?\\" ‚Äî Horace, Satires, I.24.  Physics  In 2005, Grabbe published a number of papers on quantum physics in arXiv.  Notes  References External links * The J. Orlin Grabbe Memorial Archive * Former Homepage of J.

He was a noted writer on various theological and biblical matters and was known for his great breadth of theological knowledge that characterized his religious life. Pope Pius VI beatified the Franciscan friar on 1 April 1775. Life Francesco Venimbeni was born in Fabriano in the Papal States on 2 September 1251 to pious and humble parents. His father was a prominent doctor well-loved for his abilities and his love of the poor and ill. He recited the Divine Office in his childhood and knew Latin at the time he turned ten in 1261. In 1268 he knew he would pursue the religious life and his pleased parents consented to this. He suffered a severe illness in his childhood but healed fast after his mother took him on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Francis of Assisi. It was there that Angelo da Clareno - an associate of the late Francis - saw him and foretold to his mother that little Francesco would become a Franciscan in the future. He completed his humanities and philosophical studies before asking for admission into the Order of Friars Minor at their local convent in 1267 where he was under the direction of Father Gartian. He applied himself to theological studies as well. He purchased - with his father's own funds - a handsome scale of books and other publications for the convent and this was the first on an extended scale established in the order itself. He loved to call it the \\"best workshop in the convent\\" and its catalogue - of which Luke Wadding mentioned - contains works of the Church Fathers as well as mathematicians and preachers. There was also works of theological and biblical commentators. Mark of Lisbon dubbed the friar as a \\"most learned man and renowned preacher\\". Francesco was convinced that the order had to announce well-grounded and authentic doctrine in unambiguous language and he soon became viewed as a far-sighted and progressive member of the order with an emphasis on the promotion of theological education. Little of his spiritual writings has been published and these include: * Chronica Marchi√¶ et Fabriani * De veritate et excellenti√¢ Indulgenti√¶ S. Mari√¶ de Portiuncula * Opusculum de serie et gestis Ministrorum Generalium These three particular writings all perhaps formed one extensive chronicle but have disappeared save a few fragments bearing on Franciscan historical accounts. He also published an \\"Ars Pr√¶dicantium\\" and numerous sermons as well as one he gave upon the death of Giovanni di Fidanza. His book on the Portiuncula came about when he travelled to Assisi to receive the indulgence; he learned there that Brother Leo - companion of Francis of Assisi - was still alive. The friar died on 22 April 1322 and had predicted the date of his own death. He is buried in Fabriano. Beatification The beatification for the late friar was celebrated on 1 April 1755 after Pope Pius VI approved the late friar's \\"cultus\\" - otherwise known as popular and longstanding devotion.

It was a part of Warren Consolidated Schools. It was located on Arden just west of Mound. It was also known as Warren Senior. History In 1926, William E. Murthum School was built on the corner of Seventh Avenue and Arden. It was the first brick school in Warren and housed Grades K-12. In 1931, an addition was built which housed the high school. Due to the increasing enrollment, a cinder block building was constructed in 1944 paid for with World War II bonds and was named the \\"Victory Wing.\\" Warren High School was housed in the Victory Building from 1944-1950. Once again, the enrollment grew and a new high school building was constructed on land next to Murthum. Murthum was then K-7 and Warren was 8-12. This arrangement lasted until 1958 when John C. Fuhrmann Junior High opened. It was then Murthum (K-6), Fuhrmann (7-9) and Warren (10-12). Murthum was closed at the end of the 1977-78 school year. The Victory wing (1-3) was torn down a few years after closing. The kindergarten and 4-6 grade wing were torn down in 1988. The last remaining parts, library, upstairs and gym were demolished in 1992. An inline skating rink now sits on the site. Fuhrmann was finally closed at the end of the 2002-03 school year and was just torn down July 2012, the site was on 14 Mile, halfway between Mound and Ryan. Warren High School closed at the end of 1991-92 school year. In 2002, the Warren High school building was renovated and turned into the Warren Community Center and houses the Miller Branch of the Warren Public Libraries, the Parks and Recreation Department for the city and the Warren Historical Society. Sports The school nickname was the Orioles and the colors were black and orange. The Orioles had their share of success over the years. In football, Warren won 14 conference championships and twice (1953, 1957) had undefeated seasons. In track and field from 1962‚Äì65, the Orioles won 33 consecutive dual meets. In basketball,they won seven district championships. In 1963-64,they beat Lakeshore, 65-56, to win the only Regional championship in school history.

Although trains still pass on the now electrified railway the station closed in 1958. Due to the position of the station in a cutting, it had two platforms which were staggered. These served the fast lines only, though the goods lines ran around the back of each. History The station was opened by the Great Northern Railway (GNR) on 1 November 1885 as Abbotts Ripton. The GNR became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) during the Grouping on 1 January 1923. Renamed Abbots Ripton in 1938, the station then passed on to the Eastern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948, and was closed by the British Transport Commission on 15 September 1958. Abbots Ripton rail disaster An accident occurred at the future site of the station on 21 January 1876, when the southbound Flying Scotsman express train from Edinburgh to London was involved in a double collision during a blizzard. Heavy snow had frozen around the semaphore signal arms, causing them to stick in the \\"clear\\" position, as a result of which the driver of the express was not warned of the presence of a coal train which was backing from the main line into a siding. A collision occurred, and not long after, a northbound express from London to Leeds ran into the wreckage. There were thirteen fatalities, and 53 passengers and 6 traincrew members were injured.

The parkway, built between 1909 and 1919 and now designated as part of Route 145, runs for about , from Eliot Circle (the junction with the Revere Beach Parkway and Revere Beach Boulevard) southeast to the Revere-Winthrop line. Acquisitions for its construction represent the last public purchase of oceanfront lands in Revere. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. History Winthrop Parkway was one of several parkways proposed in the coastal area north of Boston, Massachusetts in 1895. Although plans were drafted for it a few years later by the Metropolitan Parks Commission (MPC, predecessor to the Metropolitan District Commission), these plans were shelved while the commission focused on the construction of Winthrop Shore Drive and Revere Beach Parkway. Its development was also complicated by the need to develop a complete new right of way, whereas the other two parkways were built largely on existing alignments. In 1905 the Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad gave a stretch of right of way to the MPC between Eliot Circle, terminus of the Revere Beach Parkway, and Leverett Street. This part of the road was built in 1909, cutting through the Beachmont neighborhood of Revere. With the original plan to build to roadway all the way to Winthrop Beach, the MPC in 1914 proposed to lengthen the parkway to the city line. Land acquisition and construction followed, and that section of the road, which runs along the coast, was completed by 1919. The MPC then built the adjacent seawall. Discussions to further extend the parkway never resulted in further development. The roadway was widened in 1946, apparently to facilitate parking. Some time before then, tidal gates were added on either side of the parkway near Leverett Street to regulate the passage of water in and out of Belle Isle Marsh.

The B08/80 is optimised for the smaller engines and lighter weight of the LMP2 category in comparison to the larger and heavier B08/60. Ray Mallock Ltd.'s MG-Lola EX265C The first chassis of the B08/80 is used by the joint Speedy Racing Team and Sebah Automotive outfits in the Le Mans Series as well as at 24 Hours of Le Mans. The team's car uses the latest V8 engine from Judd. A second car was entered by B-K Motorsports and Mazda in the American Le Mans Series, debuting at the Petit Le Mans in October 2008, while a third B08/80 chassis was sold to Ray Mallock Ltd. and completed with parts from the team's former B05/40 to create the MG-Lola EX265C for the Le Mans Series. B-K Motorsports closed shop in late 2008 and sold their car to Dyson Racing. 2009 LMS season saw the B08/80 being the 2nd fastest LMP2, behind the Essex Porsche. Competition Dyson Racing runs two upgraded B09/86s in the 2009 American Le Mans Series in the LMP2 class. The #20 car enjoyed their first class win in the new Lola/Mazda coupe at the Lime Rock Park race. For 2010, Dyson scaled back to one car but was arguably more successful, bringing the Lola B09/86 its first overall pole at Laguna Seca and its first overall win at Mid-Ohio. In the Le Mans Series in Europe, RML won the 2010 Le Mans Series LMP2 Teams and Drivers' Championships with their Lola B08/80, highlighted by a LMP2 class win at the 2010 1000 km of Algarve. In the 2011 American Le Mans Series season Dyson racing upgraded their B09/86s to LMP1 standard and started the season with the #16 car. The #20 car returned from the 2011 Northeast Grand Prix onwards and they scored an overall win at the 2011 Baltimore Grand Prix. Even though they never won a race, the #16 car won the ALMS LMP1 championship. Level 5 Motorsports ran their upgraded B11/80's in the 2011 Intercontinental Le Mans Cup and the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans except for Silverstone and Zhuhai. They finished third in LMP2 and tenth overall at Le Mans. Level 5 switched to the HPD ARX-01g for Petit Le Mans and continued with Honda power in 2012. Until recently, the Lola B12/80 was still common in Le Mans Prototype racing.

It seats 125, and measures 30 by . The Nelke Theatre, named for one of BYU's first drama teachers, is used largely for instruction in experimental theater. It seats 280.  Student housing  Single students have four options for on-campus housing: Heritage Halls, Helaman Halls, Wyview Park, and the FLSR. Married students can live in Wymount Terrace. Heritage Halls is a twenty-four building housing complex on campus which offers apartment-style living. The halls house both male and female students, divided by gender into separate buildings. Each building has ten to fourteen units capable of housing six people each. Helaman Halls is a slightly newer complex which has recently undergone a 12-year renovation spanning 1991 and through 2004. Helaman Halls is a six building, dormitory style living area. Residents share a room (larger than Heritage Halls) with one other resident, but do not have their own kitchen and use shared bathrooms. Residents are required to have a meal plan, and eat at the newly remodeled Commons at the Cannon Center. Wyview Park was originally built for families in 1996, but this changed in 2006 when the complex began housing single students in order to counteract loss of singles' housing in other areas. Wyview Park has 30 buildings that offer apartment-style living for students, along with the option for shared or single rooms. The Foreign Language Student Residence complex has twenty-five apartments where students speak exclusively in a selected foreign language. The immersion experience is available in nine languages, and students are accompanied by a native resident throughout the year to enhance the experience. Married students can house in Wymount Terrace, which contains a total of 898 apartments in 72 buildings. Branches of the BYU Creamery provide basic food and general grocery products for students living in Heritage Halls, Wymount, Wyview, and the FLSR. Helaman Halls is served by a central cafeteria called the Cannon Center. The creamery, begun in 1949, has become a BYU tradition and is also frequented by visitors to the university and members of the community. It was the first on-campus full-service grocery store in the country.  BYU Salt Lake Center  BYU also has an extension campus, the BYU Salt Lake Center in Salt Lake City, which began in 1959. On 20 August 2007, the Salt Lake Center moved to a new Campus located on Salt Lake's North Temple street. The campus now occupies three floors of the Triad Center, and has a total of 28 classrooms. Admitted BYU students may register for classes the same way as with any class on the main Provo campus. Also, with proper clearance, non-admitted students may also register for classes. However, while these credits can be applied at BYU or transferred to other universities, registration does not constitute admittance to BYU. The Salt Lake Center has some advantages over the Provo Campus, with its tendency toward smaller class sizes. Previous to the move, most classes were held in the evening, and the curriculum was limited in size. Changes are underway to expand class offerings and times. Physical Science taught by David Bierman only at BYU SLC has several demonstrations every class. This class is one any student would not want to miss. On September 15, 2012, BYU Salt Lake Center held their first tailgate party for the BYU vs. Utah rivalry game. Over three hundred people watched the game on an 18-foot blow up screen and ate hotdogs, BYU brownies, and washed them down with free soda provided by BYU Salt Lake. LDS Business College provided hotdogs and chips to the first 200 people. Other sponsors included BYU Athletics, Deseret First Credit Union and the BYU Tailgating Club.

On the title-page it is described as a \\"Folk-Song (Eastern Europe),\\"Folk-Song\\" probably fictitious paraphrased by Pietro d‚ÄôAlba and Edward Elgar\\".Pietro d‚ÄôAlba (alias Peter Rabbit) was Elgar‚Äôs pseudonym for himself It was one of a set of a cycle of four songs that he planned, to his own words. It was shortly after writing the song A Child Asleep for Muriel Foster, a few days before the Christmas of 1909 that Elgar received the news of the death of a friend the soprano Olga Ouroussoff, the young wife of Henry Wood. The inspiration for the songs was the result of this news. Only the first song of the cycle, The Torch and the last, The River were written. It was orchestrated in July 1912 and, with its companion song The Torch, it was first performed by Muriel Foster at the Hereford Music Festival on 11 September 1912. A footnote to the poem explains the personification of the invoked river. The tempo of the music is an appropriately dramatic Allegro con fuoco. The song was written by Elgar at his home \\"Plas Gwyn\\" outside Hereford, very close to the River Wye and it is likely that the song was inspired by the sight of the river which had flooded the fields that Christmas. At the end of the manuscript Elgar wrote (Leyrisch-Turasp 1909), which mysterious \\"place- name\\" Jerrold Northrop MooreJ. N. Moore (‚ÄúEdward Elgar: a creative life‚Äù) suggests was Elgar's anagram of a German version of Peter Rabbit: Petrus Has[e] Lyric.Moore does not say whence came this information. This seems an ingenious but weak solution, since the German \\"Hase\\" = \\"Hare\\", not \\"Rabbit\\". However Garry Humphreys points outElgar Society Journal, September 1984 that Elgar's home was not far from the flood-meadows at Tupsley, and Leyrisch- Turasp is another (loose) anagram of Tupsley Parish.Mock-German \\"Tusley- Parrisch\\" could become \\"Leyrisch-Turasp\\" Another of Elgar's riddles.

Giles of Santar√©m (Gil) (about 1185 - 14 May 1265) was a Portuguese Dominican scholar. Life He was born Gil Rodrigues de Valadares at the castle of Vouzela. His father, Rui Pais de Valadares, was alcaide of Coimbra and councillor of Sancho I. It was the wish of his parents that Giles should enter the ecclesiastical state, and the king was very lavish in bestowing ecclesiastical benefices upon him: still a boy, he already held prebends at Braga, Coimbra, Idanha, and Santar√©m. Ott, Michael. \\"Blessed Gil of Santarem.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 May 2018 Giles, however, wished to become a physician. After devoting some time to the study of philosophy and medicine at Coimbra he set out for Paris. According to a popular story, he was accosted on his journey by a courteous stranger who promised to teach the art of magic at Toledo. As payment, so the legend runs, the stranger required that Giles should make over his soul to the devil and sign the compact with his blood. Giles obeyed and after devoting himself seven years to the study of magic under the direction of Satan, went to Paris, easily obtained the degree of doctor of medicine, and performed many wonderful cures. One night while he was locked up in his library a gigantic knight, armed head to foot, appeared to him and, with his sword drawn, demanded that Giles should change his wicked life. The same spectre appeared a second time, and threatened to kill Giles if he would not reform. Giles returned to Portugal, after taking the habit of St. Dominic in the newly erected monastery at Palencia, about 1221. Shortly after, his superiors sent him to the Dominican house at Santar√©m. Here he led a life of prayer and penance, and for seven years his mind was tormented by the thought of the compact which was still in the hands of Satan. Finally, his biographer narrates, the devil was compelled to surrender the compact and place it before the altar of the Blessed Virgin. Giles returned to Paris to study theology and on his return to Portugal became famous for his piety and learning. He was twice elected provincial of his order in Castile. He died at Santar√©m, Portugal. Pope Benedict XIV ratified his cult on 9 March 1748. The story did not appear until 300 years after his death, and is rejected by Dominican historians. It was revived in the mid-nineteenth century is some popular accounts of the lives of Dominican saints.Gumbley, Walter. ‚ÄúBlessed Giles Of Santarem, Confessor (Died 1765.

Under these regulations, the Crown collects mineral core and rock samples from companies working on mineral permits and makes these materials publicly available for use by prospectors, mineral exploration companies and academia for mineral exploration and research purposes. The MCRF is a large warehouse complex for core storage with two viewing/display areas and a visitors office. The facility is 1235 square metres plus 310 square metres on the mezzanine, located in the Capital Industrial Park of Edmonton, Alberta. The MCRF contains more than 58,572 metres of mineral core and 17,000 rock samples, primarily from the exposed Canadian Shield in northeast Alberta. History A diamond drillcore selection and storage program was started by the Alberta Energy and Natural Resources Department in 1979. The submission of core drilled during exploration for metallic or industrial minerals is required by the Metallic and Industrial Mineral Regulations, as part of the exploration approval process. Alberta Geological Survey was contracted to prepare a facility to store and manage the core and to select core and samples on behalf of the Alberta Energy. The original facility was called the Mineral Exploration Core and Sample Storage. In the early 1980s, a research component was added to the function and the facility named was changed to the Mineral Core Research Facility (MCRF). In 1995, the activity ceased as a contracted function and became an integrated activity of the Mineral Agreements Branch and AGS. Activities Mineral core and rock samples are collected by AGS geologists and exploration companies and sent to the MCRF. The core is catalogued, stored and available for logging or sampling by the public, industry or scientific community. Mineral Assessment Reports Assessment reports are the record of geological, geochemical, geophysical and other exploration work completed on mineral claims (exploration permits). Assessment reports are useful to subsequent property holders because they provide information that can be used to advance the prospect, rather than duplicating work already done by a previous mineral rights holder. Due to regulations, assessment reports remain confidential for one year after submission. AGS has 675 assessment reports on file, dating from 1949 to 2002. All non-confidential reports are available for viewing.

Wiik was director of DESY, in Hamburg, Germany, from 1993 until his death.  Biography  Bj√∏rn Wiik lived in his home town Bruvik until he began his physics studies at Germany's Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. In 1965, he got his doctorate degree there. Two years later he began working at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in Menlo Park, California. In 1972, Wiik returned to Germany, to the German Electron Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg where, four years later, he was appointed lead scientist. In 1978, Wiik and his collaborators began using DESY's newly commissioned PETRA electron‚Äìpositron storage ring to look for hard-gluon bremsstrahlung events that would provide experimental support for the existence and role of gluons in mediating strong interactions among quarks. Wiik and his team soon observed and reported a type of event never described before: three particle-jets whose momenta lay in a plane. These results, widely believed to represent the after-effects of two quarks plus a gluon, were soon confirmed by many other groups. In 1995, the European Physical Society awarded its Prize for High Energy and Particle Physics to four physicists representing the TASSO collaboration (Paul S√∂ding, Bj√∏rn Wiik, G√ºnter Wolf, and Sau Lan Wu) for demonstrating the existence of the gluon.\\"Twenty-five years of gluons\\", CERN Courier, November 12, 2004. Retrieved on 2008-05-28. Already during his stay at SLAC, Wiik had proposed a new type of particle accelerator, which would be based on colliding a beam of protons with a beam of electrons. In 1980, this idea took concrete form with the creation at DESY of the hadron-electron ring facility HERA). Wiik was also responsible for proposing and overseeing the implementation of a superconducting linear accelerator for Tera-electronvolt energies, TESLA. Wiik was chairman of the Super Proton Synchrotron Experiments Committee (SPSC) at CERN from 1979-80.

The castle stands on a hill above the town of Javorn√≠k in the north-western edge of Czech Silesia, in area what was a part of the Duchy of Nysa. For most of its history the castle belonged to the Prince-bishops of Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw) in Silesia. History The castle is first mentioned in written sources in 1307, when it was still the property of the Princes of ≈öwidnica. In 1348, Bolko II of ≈öwidnica sold it to the Prince- bishop Preczlaus of Pogarell (1341‚Äì1376), and since that time, the castle belonged to Breslau bishops. During the 15th century, the castle was considerably damaged by the Hussites and therefore large-scale repairs were needed. The rebuilding of the castle took place under the rule of Bishop Jan IV Roth, at the end of the 15th century, and it was completed in 1509 by his successor ‚Äì Prince-bishop John V Thurz√≥ (1506‚Äì1520). At that time, the castle was also renamed as Johannesberg (\\"John's Hill\\"), to honor the patron of the Bishops of Breslau, John the Baptist. The original fortified castle was later rebuilt in the Baroque style under the rule of Philipp Gotthard von Schaffgotsch (1716‚Äì1795), who made it his primary residence. During this time, Johannesberg castle and the town Javorn√≠k also became the cultural center of Upper Silesia. Among the most famous personalities living there, was August Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf, renowned Viennese composer and violinist. Following the death of Prince-Bishop Philipp Gotthard von Schaffgotsch, the castle was once again rebuilt as a summer residence by Bishop Joseph Christian Reichsf√ºrst von Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Bartenstein. It remained an important centre of cultural life in the region until the beginning of the 20th century. In 1959, the castle J√°nsk√Ω Vrch was loaned to the State and recovered by the Czechoslovak government in 1984, following a property agreement between the Polish and Czechoslovak Catholic archdioceses. It is now under the administration of the National Monument Institute in Olomouc and since 1 January 2002, it is on the list of Czech national cultural monuments.

De Thame contracted glandular fever at age 15, and chose to give up her dream of a dancing career at age 19. She then undertook a course in Drama at Southgate College in 1979‚Äì80 and studied History of Art at London's City Lit, after which she worked for a short period for Colnagi, a well-respected international firm of art dealers in London. She then married for the first time. While pregnant with her first baby, de Thame was recruited by a modelling agency and went on to enjoy a successful modelling career. A major part of de Thame's modelling included appearances in TV ads. Casting agents began to suggest de Thame for acting roles. By 1998, she had appeared in the mini-series Merlin and in the British feature film Bodywork; credited in both productions as Rachel Colover. However, de Thame decided not to continue pursuing an acting career and in 1998, indulging a passion for plants and gardening inherited from her father, she enrolled for two years at the English Gardening School, studying Practical Horticulture and Plants & Plantsmanship, shortly after de Thame auditioned for BBC2‚Äôs Gardeners' World. Initially presenting on the programme every week, following the birth of her second child from her second marriage she now (as of 2014) makes occasional appearances on the programme. She has also filmed her own series' for the BBC, Small Town Gardens and Gardening with the Experts. De Thame also co-presents the BBC's annual coverage of the Chelsea Flower Show, Hampton Court Palace Flower Show as part of the Royal Horticultural Society output on BBC Two. Other gardening series include Gardeners' World Top Tips and Great British Garden Revival for the BBC, and Countrywise for ITV1. Non- gardening related television appearances include Going for a Song and Call My Bluff, both for the BBC.

The network, of which certain sections were on reserved track, was far more extensive than that of the proposed Leeds Supertram, which has not been built after a funding shortfall from central government. Trams The earliest trams were single decker horsedrawn trams, but later purchases were double deckers, operated by Leeds Tramways Company. The last of these ran in 1901. Steam trams were also used until full electrification. Throughout most of the twentieth century the tramway used a mixture of bus style and balloon trams, both in double-decker formation.http://johnlawontherails.fotopic.net/p24610499.html The system of collection by trams from the overhead wiring was unusual in that it used bow collectors rather than poles, obviating the need to turn the pole round at each terminus. Even when other cities were abandoning their tramways in the 1940s, Leeds continued to modernise its system. Two prototype modern single- deck trams (somewhat similar to those used in continental European cities) were built in the early 1950s, in particular two single deck trams painted purple for the coronation, was in operation on route 3 to Roundhay in 1953 ‚Äì perhaps because this followed a segregated track along Roundhay Road to the popular attraction of Roundhay Park. These two were a conventional air and magnetic braked vehicle (601) and an all electric \\"vambac\\" car (602). The latter resides in the Crich tramway museum. In the early 1950s (1951), Leeds purchased 90 \\"Feltham\\" secondhand trams (dating from 1931), from London Transport. By this period, Leeds tramcars were normally painted in red. Closure After the closure of the Leeds system on 7 November 1959, Sheffield became the last city in England operating trams (closing in 1960), with Glasgow (Scotland) the last in the UK (closing in 1962). The Blackpool tramway then became the UK's only commercial tramway, until the opening of the Manchester Metrolink in 1992. It is argued that the closure of the tramway was shortsighted, particularly given the fact that the majority of the network ran on reserved track, and as such did not interfere with the road system. Leeds had one of largest and most advanced urban transport systems in the UK, and was developing new tramcars and opening new lines right until its closure. The people of Leeds have now tried multiple times since the 1980s to get their tramway back, with no success. Preservation Several Leeds electric trams are now preserved at the National Tramway Museum at Crich.

The operation was conducted by Axis forces under the command of Colonel Maximilian von Herff and British forces under Lieutenant-General William \\"Strafer\\" Gott. A counter- attack was made on British positions at Halfaya Pass in north-western Egypt, which had been captured during Operation Brevity was the second offensive operation commanded by Rommel in Africa (apart from the Siege of Tobruk). pushed the British out of Halfaya Pass and forced them to retire to the area from Buq Buq to Sofafi. The Germans and Italians fortified the pass and built other strong points back towards Sidi Azeiz as tank killing zones, ready to meet another British attack. The British continued with preparations for Operation Battleaxe (15‚Äì17 June) but it was another costly British failure that led to the sacking of General Sir Archibald Wavell, Commander-in-Chief Middle East and other senior officers. Background  After the great British victory over the Italian 10th Army in Operation Compass, (OKW, armed forces high command) began (Operation Sunflower), the dispatch of the (DAK, Erwin Rommel) to Libya to reinforce the remnants of the 10th Army. Rommel attacked at once, driving the British from Cyrenaica and across the Egyptian border, except for the port of Tobruk, where a nine-month siege began. By 8 April, advanced German units had reached Derna east of the Jebel Akhdar but some units had run out of water and fuel at Tengeder. A column of reconnaissance, anti-tank, machine-gun and artillery units was sent ahead to block the eastern exit from Tobruk and on 10 April, Rommel made the Suez Canal the DAK objective. A break-out from Tobruk was to be prevented and next day the port was invested; Reconnaissance Unit 3 went on to Bardia and a composite force was sent to Sollum, about into Egypt, to try to reach Mersa Matruh. The improvised Mobile Force (Brigadier William Gott) conducted a delaying-action against the Axis on the frontier around Sollum and Fort Capuzzo and from Halfaya Pass eastwards to Sidi Barrani. The first Italo-German offensive had been an operational success but supply constraints made it impossible to advance further than the Egyptian border. The Axis forces were distracted by the siege of Tobruk, while the British began to rebuild their strength in Egypt. Halfaya Pass The Western Desert, is about wide, from Mersa Matruh in Egypt to Gazala on the Libyan coast. The Sand Sea inland to the south, marks the limit of the desert, which is widest at Giarabub and Siwa Oasis. In British parlance, the Western Desert came to include eastern Cyrenaica in Libya. From the coast, extending inland lies a raised, flat plain of stony desert about above sea level, wide, with the Sand Sea beyond. Westwards from Sofafi in Egypt, there are few places where the escarpment can be traversed north‚Äìsouth by wheeled or tracked vehicles. The Litoranea Balbo (Via Balbia) was the only paved road. Scorpions, vipers and flies populate the region, which is inhabited by a small number of Bedouin nomads. Halfaya Pass is a gap in the escarpment near Sollum, about inland. In Operation Brevity British forces attacked through Halfaya Pass, against the desert flank of the Axis forces. The attack was intended to reach Sidi Azeiz, beyond Fort Capuzzo in Libya and destroy any Axis forces met during the advance. The attack was repulsed except at the pass, which was captured by the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards and then garrisoned by the 3rd Battalion Coldstream Guards (Lieutenant- Colonel J. Moubray), a squadron of Infantry tanks from the 4th Royal Tank Regiment (4th RTR, Major C. G. Miles), field, anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns, with the 7th Support Group of the 7th Armoured Division on the southern flank. Prelude Operation Brevity Operation Brevity was a limited British offensive, planned as a rapid blow against weak Axis front-line forces around Sollum, Fort Capuzzo and Bardia on the Egyptian‚ÄìLibyan frontier. The port garrison of Tobruk, to the west, had resisted Axis attacks and its Australian and British troops endangered the Axis supply line from Tripoli, which led Rommel to give priority to the siege, leaving the front line thinly held. The British objectives were to capture ground from which to begin an offensive toward Tobruk and to inflict losses on the German and Italian forces. On 15 May, Gott attacked with a mixed infantry and armoured force in three columns. Halfaya Pass was taken against determined Italian opposition and in Libya, the British captured Fort Capuzzo but German counter-attacks regained the fort during the afternoon, causing many casualties among the defenders. The operation had begun well and had thrown the Axis commanders into confusion but most of its early gains were lost to counter-attacks and with German reinforcements arriving from Tobruk, the operation was called off. Gott became concerned that his forces risked being caught in the open by German tanks and conducted a staged withdrawal to the Halfaya Pass on 16 May. Plan was intended to recapture Halfaya Pass by a demonstration on a wide front, bluffing the British into a withdrawal. On the frontier, ( Maximilian von Herff), included Panzer Regiment 8 and troops from Motorised Infantry Regiment 15, Reconnaissance Battalion 33 and a battalion of Rifle Regiment 104. The panzer regiment had but insufficient fuel and only were used in the attack. The was divided into on the right, with much of the artillery that was to perform a flanking move to the right towards Deir el Hamra. In the centre, with most of the tanks, was to advance on Sidi Suleiman to the south-west of the pass and on the left (coastal) flank, was to advance close to the escarpment against the British infantry positions, where there was bad going for tanks. was held in reserve and if the British stood their ground, and were to concentrate before attacking. Battle During the evening of 26 May, assembled on the coast at the foot of Halfaya Pass. The attacked the next morning, intending to bluff the British into retiring from the plateau above the escarpment. A panzer battalion west of Fort Capuzzo manoeuvred as a decoy, to give the British the impression that an outflanking move was under way on the desert flank. Only encountered opposition and in the afternoon, Herff ordered the tanks of to move northwards to defeat the British at Halfaya. The move took place during the night and at dawn on 27 May, attacked the head of the pass, attacked the foot and the panzers appeared at the top of the escarpment and bombarded the coastal plain. The commander of the nine 4th RTR tanks at Halfaya ordered an advance to engage the German tanks and during the morning, Gott authorised a withdrawal. Moubray managed to extricate the battalion, although some Guards were captured at the bottom of the pass by . There were no British forces near enough to reinforce and the pass was re- occupied by Axis troops. Aftermath Analysis The Axis victories during Operation Brevity and were a consequence of the technical superiority of some German equipment, particularly in anti-tank guns and wireless. German field intelligence gleaned and exploited quickly, tactically useful information from British wireless signals and captured documents. British intelligence had the advantage of Ultra decrypts, particularly from signals but the time taken to send the information from England to Cairo and then deliver it to the commanders on the frontier, made much of it obsolete, even when it contained useful tactical information. Rommel was able secretly and rapidly to reinforce the frontier posts from Tobruk when Operation Brevity began and then spring the surprise at Halfaya Pass on 27 May. (The garrison at Tobruk had made two small raids during Operation Brevity but the commander had not been informed of the operation until 17 May.) Casualties British casualties were four 25-pounder field guns, eight 2-pounder anti-tank guns and five Infantry tanks. Herff reported that forty prisoners, nine 25-pounder field guns, seven Matilda tanks and two other tanks had been captured. Tiger Convoy On 12 May, the Tiger convoy arrived in Alexandria with and fighters. The tanks included (including fifty of the new Crusader tanks) and There were delays in unloading the tanks, which also had to be adapted for desert use and Battleaxe was postponed until 10 June. The tanks were intended for the 7th Armoured Division, which had been out of action since February after most of its tanks had been worn out during Operation Compass. Subsequent operations Axis defensive preparations After the re- capture of Halfaya Pass, the Axis forces fortified the Gazala line and the siege lines around Tobruk in Libya. The 5th Light Afrika Division was withdrawn on 8 June, to refit at El Adem near Tobruk and replaced on the frontier with the 15th Panzer Division (Generalmajor Walter Neumann-Silkow), with three Italian infantry battalions and an artillery regiment from the 102nd Motorised Division Trento in support at Sollum, Musaid and Capuzzo. The Axis troops built a defensive line just over the border in Egypt, based on Halfaya Pass, in an arc through Qalala and Hafid Ridge south-west of Fort Capuzzo to Sidi Azeiz. Rommel adopted the defensive tactics which had been used to defeat the Axis attack on Tobruk at Ras el Medauar in late April. Six strong points were built in which guns and anti-tank guns were dug in down to their barrels, camouflaged and organised for all-round defence. Even with a relatively small force on the frontier, supply difficulties made stocking the defences with water, fuel and ammunition difficult. Wilhelm Bach, the commander of the anti-tank unit that contained most of the in North Africa, sited five of the and several anti-tank guns in the new fortifications at Halfaya, held by a battalion of Rifle Regiment 104. Turrets were removed from knocked-out Matildas and dug in; the bottom of the pass was sown with anti- tank and anti-personnel mines. Four guns were dug in behind minefields on Hafid Ridge and Sidi Azeiz Ridge covering the Sidi Azeiz crossroads; the last four guns remained mobile with the 15th Panzer Division. The British made preparations for Operation Battleaxe, which was due to begin as soon as tank reinforcements were ready from the Tiger convoy, which had arrived from Britain on 12 May. Operation Battleaxe On 15 June, the Axis garrisons of Halfaya Pass, Bardia, Sollum, Capuzzo and Sidi Aziez were to be destroyed by XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Noel Beresford-Peirse) with the 4th Indian Division, 7th Armoured Division and the 22nd Guards Brigade, which were then to capture the area around Tobruk and El Adem and advance further west to take Derna and Mechili. Poor British signals security gave Rommel notice of the operation and its course; during the battle, captured documents were exploited. The 5th Light Afrika Division was moved to the south of Tobruk, ready for operations in the Sollum area or Tobruk and Rommel ordered a big artillery bombardment of Tobruk, the night before the operation, to prevent the Allied garrison from breaking out. On 17 June, XIII Corps was ordered to retire before the 22nd Guards Brigade was trapped; by dark, the British had withdrawn to the area of Sidi Barrani‚ÄìSofafi and the Axis troops had returned to their positions on the frontier. The British suffered Cruiser tanks and Infantry tanks which had started the operation. German casualties were destroyed, about (excluding vehicles repaired during the battle) and ten aircraft. British troops captured about but let most go when they withdrew. On 1 July, Wavell was sacked and replaced by General Claude Auchinleck, the Commander-in-Chief, India; Beresford-Pierce was sacked and replaced by Lieutenant-General Reade Godwin-Austen.

Life Cottages at Oxford (undated), Yale Center for British Art Trees with felled timber Henry Bright was born on 5 June 1810 in Saxmundham, Suffolk, the third son of some nine children of Jerome Bright (1770‚Äì1846), a clockmaker, and Susannah Denny, of Alburgh in Norfolk, who were married on 28 June 1790. Jerome and Susannah Bright attended services in the Congregational chapel at Rendham, a few miles from Saxmundham. Bright was apprenticed by his family to a chemist in Woodbridge, Suffolk, but was then transferred to a Norwich chemist, Paul Squires. During this apprenticeship, or perhaps afterwards, he became a dispenser at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital. During this period he is said to have spent all his free time sketching. His obvious artistic talents were finally recognised and he became a pupil of Alfred Stannard. He is also said to have been trained by John Berney Crome and John Sell Cotman, both of whom were members of the Norwich Society of Artists. About 1833 Bright returned to Saxmundham to marry a local girl, Eliza Brightley, on 8 May. Two of their children are known to have survived into adulthood. Bright moved with his family to Paddington in 1836. In 1848, the year they moved to Ealing, his wife Eliza died. By 1854, Bright was living in St John's Wood, but left London in 1858 because of health reasons and settled with his daughters in his brother's house in Saxmundham. Bright continued to visit London for business reasons and to view exhibitions. From 1860, he lived at Redhill in Surrey. He also spent some time in Maidstone. He died in Ipswich in 1873. Works Effect after rain Bright painted in various locations in England, Scotland, Wales and across Europe, working in oils, watercolour, chalk and pencil. During a few of these sketching expeditions he was accompanied by J M W Turner, with whom he had struck up a friendship. Bright's work was also highly regarded by John Ruskin. Bright's first major exhibition was at the British Institution, London in 1836. He exhibited at the Liverpool Academy exhibition that year as \\"Draughtsman in crayons to her Royal Highness the Langravine of Hesse Hamberg\\". He became a member of the New Society of Painters in Watercolours in 1839, where he exhibited until 1844. Although his obituary in The Art Journal stated that he did not exhibit in oils until the Royal Academy exhibition of 1845, this is not known for certain.Obituary, The Art Journal, November 1873, p. 327. Bright developed friendships with other leading artists, including Samuel Prout, Henry Jutsum, David Cox, George Lance, William Collingwood Smith, William Leighton Leitch and James Duffield Harding. He was influenced by Harding's oil and pencil technique and, like him, issued a number of drawing-books in the 1840s. His use of chalk and stump on buff paper is similar to that of Robert Leman (1799‚Äì1863), while John Middleton strongly influenced his use of watercolour, particularly in around 1847. Bright's name was also associated with the manufacture of coloured crayons. He established a profitable career teaching the titled and well-to-do, many of whom became his patrons. In 1844 Queen Victoria purchased Bright's Entrance to an Old Prussian Town (London, Royal Collection) from the New Society of Painters in Watercolours. He also received several commissions from the Grand Duchess Marie of Russia. His professional success extended to working collaboratively with other artists, including John Frederick Herring and William Shayer, where Bright usually contributed the background. Throughout his career in London, Bright maintained links with the artists of the Norwich School of painters. Public collections There is an extensive collection of Bright's paintings at the Norwich Castle Museum. He is also represented at major art galleries in London, Boston and San Francisco.

He financed the Biosphere 2 project, an artificial closed ecological system, which was built between 1987 and 1991. He is the chairman of Fine Line, an investment and venture-capital management firm in Fort Worth,Chronicle of Philanthropy; November 23, 2006, Vol. 19 Issue 4, p6-6. Retrieved May 26, 2008. and Chairman of the board of directors of the Sid W. Richardson Foundation, a philanthropic organization. He was listed as #239 on the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans in 2012, with an estimated net worth of $2 billion. Early life and education Bass was born in Fort Worth, Texas to Perry R. (1914‚Äì2006) and Nancy Lee (n√©e Muse) Bass (1917-2013), the second- oldest of four sons; his brothers are Lee Marshall Bass, Sid Richardson Bass, and Robert Muse Bass. His father, Perry, was an adviser and later partner of his own bachelor uncle, Sid W. Richardson (1891‚Äì1959), starting in the 1930s. When Richardson died, he left each of the Bass brothers $2.8 million, and Perry managed the bulk of the family oil fortune, which was initially beset by legal problems. Ed Bass attended Phillips Academy, and graduated from Yale in 1967 with a bachelor's degree in administrative science. He served for a short time in the United States Coast Guard and returned to Yale, studying for a master's degree in architecture, which he did not complete. All four brothers attended Yale, from which their father had also graduated in 1937. He has one child Henry Richardson Bass (January 1993).https://www.star- telegram.com/news/local/fort-worth/article193286574.html Early projects After leaving Yale, Bass \\"set out to explore the world\\". He moved to New Mexico and spent some time with \\"an unusual counterculture group at Synergia Ranch\\", run by John P. Allen. While in New Mexico, Bass built the Llano Compound, a condominium in Santa Fe and began an association with Allen that focused on ecology projects. He later spent money on a hotel in Nepal, a Australian ranch, a Puerto Rican rainforest, and the now-defunct Caravan of Dreams performing arts center in Fort Worth. Biosphere 2 In 1984, Bass and Allen founded the Biosphere 2 project, which Bass funded with an initial commitment of $30 million. The project was part of a ranch in the Santa Catalina Mountains in Oracle, Arizona, near Tucson. The purpose of its 3 acre living space was to be an experiment in \\"recreating the earth\\" and as a possible way to settle Mars. The project began with eight people living inside in an attempt to be a self-contained settlement, raising food and recycling air and water. After the environment was sealed in 1991, noxious gases built up, and while some of the 4,000 species thrived, the water and crops failed in 1994. In April 1994 Bass obtained a court order to \\"formally oust the key managers of the Biosphere and seize the premises,\\" and he dissolved Space Biospheres Ventures, a partnership, which the Los Angeles Times called a \\"volatile blend of New Age idealism and corporate sophistication.\\" The Biosphere project had in 1992 installed an independent Science Advisory Committee (SAC), chaired by Thomas E. Lovejoy, a senior official at the Smithsonian Institution, and the members came to be at odds with Bass \\"on questions of scientific standards,\\" and the science committee was dissolved in February 1993. Bass attempted to make Steve Bannon the interim chief executive officer. The existing management, however, refused Bannon admittance to the property, according to an affidavit Bass later submitted to a Fort Worth court, where he filed his dissolution suit. In 1995, it was turned into a research facility overseen by Columbia University, which declined to provide funding for continued research after June 2003. In 2007, Bass sold some of the land adjacent to the project, and the building was leased to the University of Arizona. The total cost of the privately funded Biosphere project has been variously reported as $150 million to $200 million. The University of Arizona announced a full acquisition of the Biosphere buildings and grounds in June 2011. Conservation efforts Bass has funded numerous projects focused on environmental conservation, and has stated that he feels conservation \\"most effective when approached as an enterprise\\". His investment in Nepal also included conservation efforts for rhinos and tigers. He has supported and worked with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the New York Botanical Garden, the Jane Goodall Institute, and the National Environmental Education and Training Foundation. He is currently the vice chairman of the Botanical Research Institute of Texas and is the founder of the ecological nonprofit Philecology Trust, which he created in 1986. Urban redevelopment Bass is a long-time supporter of downtown redevelopment, and has been described as a \\"leader in what is recognized as one of the most successful urban revitalization efforts in America\\". He and his family began the Sundance Square development in 1982. It combines commercial and residential space in the central business area of Fort Worth, and it received the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce's Spirit of Enterprise award in 2004. He led the development of Bass Performance Hall, financed without public funding, which opened in 1998. Philanthropy *2002: Established the Edward P.

He was the inventor of the Allison Perfection Fountain Pen and, with Carl G. Fisher, founded Prest-O-Lite, a manufacturer of automobile headlights. Also with Fisher, Frank H. Wheeler, and Arthur C. Newby he was a founder of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race. Allison formed the Indianapolis Speedway Team Company later known as the Allison Experimental Company, and later as the Allison Engine Company which was eventually purchased by General Motors after Allison's death becoming the Allison Division of General Motors, a manufacturer of automotive transmissions (Allison Transmission), aircraft engines (Allison Engine Company), truck engines, and other products. Allison died of pneumonia in 1928 at the age of 56 and was buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis. His Indianapolis home, Riverdale, is now part of Marian University. Early years James Allison moved to Indianapolis with his parents, Noah and Myra, in 1880. He left school and joined his father's business, Allison Coupon Company, at age 12 in 1884. Just six years later, with the untimely death of his father, James assumed the vice-presidency of the company at age 18 in 1890. Allison Coupon Company still exists today as Allison Payment Systems. During the 1890s Allison became intrigued by the bicycle craze that was sweeping the nation. He joined the Indianapolis-based bicycle \\"Zig-Zag Club,\\" where he met future business partners Carl G. Fisher and Arthur C. Newby. Fisher and Allison would remain confidants the rest of their lives. Prest-O-Lite Allison, just 32 years old and already an executive at two companies, Allison Coupon and Allison Perfection Fountain Pens, was drawn into forming yet another when Fisher called in 1904. The new company would prove to be the biggest yet, the producer of the first viable headlight for automobiles. Based on compressed acetylene gas as electric headlights were years from introduction, the new technology utilized brass canisters of the compressed gas funneled to the headlight through tubing. Fisher had met Percy \\"Fred\\" Avery, the holder of the patent for the product, and the three of them formed Concentrated Acetylene Company in September 1904. They called their product \\"Prest-O-Lite,\\" which became the company's name when Avery parted with the firm in 1906. The partners hit the market with perfect timing as the automobile industry was growing rapidly and the ability to see at night was naturally a great benefit. Prest-O-Lite brought the already successful Allison and Fisher wealth well beyond what they had enjoyed earlier. When they sold the firm to Union Carbide in 1917 Allison reaped several million dollars. Allison and Fisher Allison and Fisher continued to build businesses together throughout their lives. Their styles complemented each other famously. Fisher was the fountain of ideas, but impetuous. Allison was the steady hand and an outstanding manager. Lem Trotter, a mutual business colleague, said of Allison, \\"Fisher was the dreamer but Allison had the most brilliant mind of any man I ever knew. He was the industrialist.\\" Allison supported Fisher's efforts to lead the development of transcontinental highways, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Miami Beach. The two men were the senior partners in establishing the Indianapolis Motor Speedway with junior partners Newby and Wheeler. Allison and Fisher built mansions near each other on the then-rural Cold Springs Road in Indianapolis. The Allison mansion, named \\"Riverdale,\\" and later, the Fisher mansion were acquired by the Sisters of St. Francis and became the beginnings of what is now Marian University. Allison (who had a heart condition) and Fisher also were responsible for the building of a hospital in Miami Beach, Fla. The Hospital opened in 1926 as the Allison Hospital. Several years later it was run by the Sisters of St. Francis and eventually became St. Francis Hospital. It closed in 1992 after being purchased for real estate development. Legacy Allison formed the Indianapolis Speedway Team Company to engineer race cars for the Indianapolis 500. The machine shop was located on the same grounds as Prest-O-Lite (directly across the street from the Speedway) until Prest-O-Lite was sold in 1917. The company engineered the car that won the 1919 race with driver Howdy Wilcox. The company re-tooled for World War I, becoming a major defense contractor as Allison Experimental Company. Renamed as Allison Engineering Company in the 1920s, the company was acquired by General Motors in 1929 after Allison's death in 1928. Allison Engineering became two divisions of GM, one of which was sold to Rolls-Royce Aerospace in 1995. The other division, Allison Transmission, was acquired by a private equity firm in 2007, but still has a close affiliation with GM. Allison was inducted in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame in 1964.

She was awarded the International Master title in March 2009, having earned the norms at the French Club Championship (2005), the Swiss Championship at Lenzerheide (2006) and the B√©thune Open (2008). She was raised in the French town of Castelnau-le-Lez and learned to play chess at the age of four. Her endeavours at junior level showed good promise and catapulted her Elo rating over the 2100 mark by the time she was seventeen years of age. Consequently, she played top board for the French Girls team at the Faber Cup in Dublin in 2000 and contributed to winning the event. However, it was at Aix-les-Bains in 2003 that she showed her greatest progress, winning the French Women's Championship with 9/11, an impressive 1¬Ω points clear of the field. The result sealed her qualification for the Woman Grandmaster (WGM) title, awarded the same year. At the 2004 event, she came close to repeating her previous success, for a while leading the competition in Val d'Is√®re and eventually taking second place behind Almira Skripchenko. Due to the strength of this contest, she gained many rating points. In 2006, she made a foray to the Swiss Open Championship in Lenzerheide and placed a creditable third. Competing at the Baku 2007 Women's International she faced a tough test, losing her first 3 games, then resourcefully climbing back to 4/9 in what was a first class line-up. Pia Cramling was just one notable scalp along the way. The French championship returned to Aix-les-Bains in 2007 and once again she finished in first place, this time on equal points with Silvia Collas. A rapidplay play-off was used to determine the champion and Milliet narrowly missed out. At Pau in 2008, she claimed a second triumph in the French Women's Championship. At N√Æmes in 2009 she won her third title with the score of 7/10 (+5 ‚àí1 =4). In October 2015, Milliet became the Mediterranean Women's Champion in Beirut.10th Mediterranean Individual Championships 2015 - Beirut ‚Äì Lebanon Chess-Results At Agen in 2016 and 2017, she again won the French Women's national championship, the latter being in convincing fashion, after finishing 2.5 points above runner-up Cecile Haussernot. A keen exponent of team chess, she represented France in the Chess Olympiads of 2004 and 2006, notching up a healthy, cumulative plus score of +11 ‚àí4 =6. She also participated at the European Team Chess Championships of 2003, 2005 and 2007. As a player of league chess, she is extremely active and has participated in the French Nationale for three teams; Bischwiller, Clichy and latterly, Montpellier. Between 2003 and 2005 she was a frequent visitor to the German Women's Bundesliga and in respect of the UK's 4NCL, has occasionally appeared for the largely female-populated Pride and Prejudice team in 2007/08.

Most primates are sexually dimorphic for different biological characteristics, such as body size, canine tooth size, craniofacial structure, skeletal dimensions, pelage color and markings, and vocalization.Flores D, Casinos A. 2011. Cranial ontogeny and sexual dimorphism in two New World monkeys: Alouatta caraya (Atelidae) and Cebus apella (Cebidae). Journal of Morphology 272: 744-757. However, such sex differences are primarily limited to the anthropoid primates; most of the strepsirrhine primates (lemurs and lorises) and tarsiers are monomorphic.Plavcan JM. 2001. Sexual dimorphism in primate evolution. American Journal of Physical Anthropology 33:25-53. Sexual dimorphism can manifest itself in many different forms. In male and female primates there are obvious physical difference such as body size or canine size. Dimorphism can also be seen in skeletal features such as the shape of the pelvis or the robustness of the skeleton. There are two mating systems in the sexual selection of primates. Types Body size Extant primates exhibit a broad range of variation in sexual size dimorphism (SSD), or sexual divergence in body size.Dunham AE, Maitner BS, Razafindratsima OH, Simmons MC, Roy CL. 2013. Body size and sexual size dimorphism in primates: influence of climate and net primary productivity. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 26: 2312-2320. It ranges from species such as gibbons and strepsirrhines (including Madagascar's lemurs) in which males and females have almost the same body sizes to species such as chimpanzees and bonobos in which males‚Äô body sizes are larger than females‚Äô body sizes. In extreme cases, males have body sizes that are almost twice as large as those of females, as in some species including gorillas, orangutans, mandrills, hamadryas baboons, and proboscis monkeys.Dixson A, Dixson B, Anderson M. 2005. Sexual selection and the evolution of visually conspicuous sexually dimorphic traits in male monkeys, apes, and human beings. Annual Review of Sex Research 16:1-19. Patterns of size dimorphism exhibited in primates may correspond to the intensity of competition between members of the same sex for access to mates‚Äìintrasexual competition,Gordon AD. 2006. Scaling of size and dimorphism in Primates II: Macroevolution. International Journal of Primatology 27(1):63-105. counteracted by fecundity selection on the other sex. Some callitrichine and strepsirrhine primates are, however, characterized by the reverse dimorphism, a phenomenon in which females are larger than males. For lemurs, for example, females‚Äô dominance over males accounts for the reverse dimorphism.Lindenfors P, Tullberg BS. 1998. Phylogenetic analyses of primate size evolution: the consequences of sexual selection. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 64:413-447. Tooth size Canine sexual dimorphism is one particular type of sexual dimorphism, in which males of a species have larger canines than females. Within primates, the male and female canine tooth size varies among different taxonomic subgroups, yet canine dimorphism is most extensively found in catarrhines among haplorhine primates. For example, in many baboons and macaques, the size of male canines is more than twice as large as that of female canines. It is rare, yet females in some species are known to have larger canines than males, such as the eastern brown mouse lemur (Microcebus rufus).Thoren S, Lindenfors P, Kappeler PM. 2006. Phylogenetic analyses of dimorphism in primates: evidence for stronger selection on canine size than on body size. American Journal of Physical Anthropology 130:50-59. Sexual dimorphism in canine tooth size is relatively weak or absent in extant strepsirrhine primates. The South American titi monkeys (Callicebus moloch), for instance, do not exhibit any differences in the size of canine teeth between the sexes.Kinzey WG. 1972. Canine teeth of the monkey, Callicebus moloch: lack of sexual dimorphis m. Primates 13(4):365-369. Among different types of teeth constituting the dentition of primates, canines exhibit the greatest degree of variation in tooth size, whereas incisors have less variation and cheek teeth have the least.Gingerich PD, Schoeninger MJ. 1979. Patterns of tooth size variability in the dentition of primates. American Journal of Physical Anthropology 51(3):457-465. A canine dimorphism is also more widely seen in maxillary canines than in mandibular canines. Craniofacial structure Craniofacial sex differentiation among anthropoid primates varies in a wide range and is known to arise primarily through ontogenetic processes.Hens SM. 2005. Ontogeny of craniofacial sexual dimorphism in the orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus). I: Face and palate. American Journal of Primatology 65:149-166. Studies on hominids have shown that, in general, males tend to have a greater increase of facial volume than of neurocranial volume, a more obliquely oriented foramen magnum, and a more pronounced rearrangement of the nuchal region.Berge C, Penin X.2004. Ontogenetic allometry, heterochrony, and interspecific differences in the skull of African apes, using tridimensional procrustes analysis. American Journal of Physical Anthropology 124:124-138. The breadth, length and height of the neurocranium in adult male macaques, guenons, orangutans and gorillas are about nine percent larger than the neurocranial dimensions in adult females, whereas in spider monkeys and gibbons the sex differences is on a general average about 4 to 5 percent.Schultz AH. 1962. Metric age changes and sex differences in primate skulls. Zeitschrift fur Morphologie und Anthropologie 52(3):239-255. In orangutans, males and females share similarities in facial dimensions and growth in terms of orbits, nasal width, and facial width. They tend to have some significant differences, however, in various facial heights (e.g., height of the anterior face, premaxilla, and nose). Skeletal structure Primates also exhibit sexual dimorphism in skeletal structures. In general, skeletal dimorphism in primates is primarily known as a product of body mass dimorphism. Hence, males have proportionally larger skeletons compared to females due to their larger body masses.Wood BA. 1976. The nature and basis of sexual dimorphism in the primate skeleton. Journal of Zoology 180(1):15-34. Larger and more robust skeletal structures in males is also attributable to better developed muscle scarring, and more intense cresting of bones compared to those of females. Male gorillas, for example, possess large sagittal and nuchal crests, which correspond to their large temporalis muscles and nuchal musculature. Also, an unusual skeletal dimorphism includes enlarged, hollow hyoid bones found in males of gibbons and howler monkeys, which contribute to the resonation of their voices. Pelage color and markings Sex differences in pelage, such as capes of hair, beards, or crests, and skin can be found in several species among adult primates. Several species (e.g., Lemur macaco, Pithecia pithecia, Alouatta caraya) show an extensive dimorphism in pelage colors or patterning. For example, in mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx), males display extensive red and blue coloration on their face, rump and genitalia as compared to females. Male mandrills also possess a yellow beard, nuchal crest of hair, and pronounced boney paranasal ridges, all of which are absent or vestigial in females. Studies have shown that male color in mandrills serves as a badge of social status in the species.Setchell JM, Wickings EJ. 2005. Dominance, status signals, and coloration in male mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx). Ethology 111:25-50. Temporary sexual dimorphism Some sexual dimorphic traits in primates are known to appear on a temporary basis. In squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), males can gain fat as much as 25 percent of the body mass only during the breeding season, specifically in their upper torso, arms, and shoulders. This seasonal phenomenon, known as ‚Äúmale fattening,‚Äù is associated with both male-male competition and female choice for larger males.Plavcan JM. 2012. Sexual size dimorphism, canine dimorphism, and male-male competition in primates: where do humans fit in? Human Nature 23:45-67.Stone AI. 2014. Is fatter sexier? Reproductive strategies of male squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus). International Journal of Primatology 35:628-642. Orangutan males tend to gain weight and develop large cheek flanges, when they achieve dominance over other group members. Vocalization In many adult primates, dimorphism in the vocal repertoire can appear in both call production (e.g., calls with a particular set of acoustic traits) and usage (e.g., call frequency and context-specificity) between the sexes.Bouchet H, Blois-Heulin C, Lemasson A. 2012. Age- and sex-specific patterns of vocal behavior in De Brazza‚Äôs monkeys (Cercopithecus neglectus). American Journal of Primatology 74:12-28. Sex-specific calls are commonly found in Old World monkeys, in which males produce loud calls for intergroup spacing and females produce copulation calls for sexual activity. Forest guenons also tend to display strong vocal divergences between sexes, with mostly sex-specific call types.Bouchet H, Pellier A, Blois-Heulin C, Lemasson A. 2010. Sex differences in the vocal repertoire of adult red-capped mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus): A multi-level acoustic analysis. American Journal of Primatology 72:360-375. Studies on De Brazza's monkeys (Cercopithecus neglectus), one of the African guenon species, have shown that call rates in adult females (24 call.hr-1) are more than seven times higher than in adult males (2.5call.hr-1). A usage of different call types also differs between sexes, in that females mostly utter contact(-food) calls, whereas males produce a great number of threat calls. Such difference in vocal usage is associated with social roles, with females being involved in more social tasks within the group and males being responsible for territory defense. Ultimate mechanisms Ultimate mechanisms for sexual dimorphism in primates explain the evolutionary history and functional significance of the sexual dimorphism expressed among primates.Watkins GG. 1996. Proximate causes of sexual size dimorphism in the Iguanian lizard Microlophus occipitalis. Ecology 77(5):1473-1482. Sexual selection In primates, sexual dimorphism including body size, canine tooth size, and morphological characteristics is often attributed to sexual selection, which is believed to act through two mechanisms: intrasexual competition and female mate choice. Most male anthropoid primates increase their potential reproductive output by directly engaging in agonistic (contest) competition for gaining access to females. Any weaponry or other physical characteristics that allow males to win intrasexual combat are therefore strongly favored for the selection. Larger body size has been thought to confer advantages to males in competition for access to females, which is consistent with sexual selection hypothesis.Plavcan JM, Van Schaik CP. 1997. Intrasexual competition and body weight dimorphism in anthropoid primates. American Journal of Physical Anthropology 103:37-68. Males with a larger canine tooth also tend to be competitively superior to males with a smaller canine, which explain a dimorphism in canine size between the sexes.Mitani JC, Gros-Louis J, Richards AF. 1996. Sexual dimorphism, the operational sex ratio, and the intensity of male competition in polygynous primates. The American Naturalist 147(6):966-980. For example, baboons are highly dimorphic in both body mass and canine size, where males are actively engaged in fights for increasing their mating success and defending females against other males. Differential parental investment between the sexes accounts for female mate choice.Craul M, Zimmermann E, Radespiel U. 2004. First experimental evidence for female mate choice in a nocturnal primate. Primate 45:271-274. The number of offspring produced by female primates is often limited due to the small litter size, long intervals between births, relatively slow-growing offspring, and energetically expensive costs of pregnancy, lactation, and child care. Females thus choose their mates possessing certain preferable traits, which could possibly provide genetic or direct phenotypic benefits.Muller MN, Thompson ME, Kahlenberg SM, Wrangham RW. 2011. Sexual coercion by male chimpanzees show that female choice may be more apparent than real. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 65:921-933. For example, the large mane found in male gelada (Theropithecus) is assumed to be a preferable pelage condition favored by females, who primarily control and select their mates. Such preference leads the increase in size dimorphism across primate species, which may be favorable in an environment where resources are limited.  Intrasexual selection  Also known as male-male competition, intra-sexual selection occurs between males over a specific mate. This selection determines the reproductive success of the male by his athletic capabilities. The winning male in this combat will be rewarded in mating with the opposite sex primate. There is variation in the types of intra-sexual selection that occurs between primates. Dominant males are physically larger and stronger, which allows them to be fierce competition for females. = Verreaux's Sifaka = Verreaux's Sifaka is a medium-sized primate of the Lemur family that resides in Madagascar. Living in groups, they are social creatures. This species is known for its casual mating style and vicious male- male competition. There are two basic forms of male to male competition in these primates: Verreaux's Sifaka  Agonistic episodes  The male will bite, lunge, or attack an opponent during a brawl. These episodes are highly aggressive, ending in bloodshed.  Endurance episodes  Involved chasing and lunging between male primates. This will continue to go on until one of the parties collapses from exhaustion. The basis of this sexual selection relies on Verreaux's Sifaka's body and canine size. Sexual selection in this specific primate may favor a smaller, more agile male due to its ability to move quicker in the forest environment. Larger, more stocky males will be unable to move as quickly which gives the upper hand to smaller, more athletic males. Due to the survival of intermediate body size primates, this affects the evolution of the species type. Intermediate males mating with similarly sized females will not evolve the body size of these primates. This primate is just one example of the different forms of Intrasexual selection that is possible.  Intersexual selection  Mandrill showing brightly colored face used for sexual selection. This form of sexual selection differs from intra-sexual selection as it focuses on the mutual participation from both sexes. This typically focuses on the female choosing the best mate rather than the male. This selection could include flashy colors, energetic displays of activity from the male species, valuable resources, or friendly behavior to the female. The individuals with these valued characteristics will have the best opportunity of finding a mate. = Mandrill = The mandrill can be found in tropical rain forest environments, usually in the thick bush but have also adapted to life on the ground. The sexual dimorphism in this animal focuses less on male-male competition but instead on physical attributes such as their body size and ornamentation. Their faces are brightly colored and stand out when looking for their female mate. When they find their mate, these primates typically remain involved in the offspring's life, offering grooming, protection, or entertainment to their offspring. Mating system A strong association between polygynous mating system and dimorphism in primates has been observed. Monogamous species tend to show lower degree of sexual dimorphism than polygynous species, since monogamous males have a lower differential reproductive success. Monogamous mating system seems to account for minimal dimorphism in hylobatids, in which females are codominant with males.Leigh SR, Shea BT. 1995. Ontogeny and the evolution of adult body size dimorphism in apes. American Journal of Primatology 36:37-60. As an exception, among polygynous primates, colobines as a group consistently exhibit a low level of sexual size dimorphism for unclear reasons. In terms of canine dimorphism, males in polygynous species tend to have larger and relatively stronger canines than males in monogamous and polyandrous species.Plavcan JM, Ruff CB. 2008. Canine size, shape, and bending strength in primates and carnivores. American Journal of Physical Anthropology 136:65-84. Phylogeny Similar magnitudes of body weight dimorphism have been observed in all species within several taxonomic groups such as callitrichids, hylobatids, Cercopithecus, and Macaca. Such correlation between phylogenetic relatedness and sexual dimorphism across different groups reflects similarities in their behaviors and ecological conditions, but not in independent adaptations. This idea is referred to as ‚Äúphylogenetic niche conservatism.\\" Terrestriality Terrestrial primates tend to show a greater degree of dimorphism than arboreal primates. It has been hypothesized that larger sizes of body mass and canine tooth are favored among males of terrestrial primates due to the likelihood of higher vulnerability to predators. Another hypothesis suggests that arboreal primates have limitations on their upper body size, given that larger body size could disrupt their usage of terminal branches for locomotion. However, among some species of guenons (Cercopithecus), arboreal blue monkeys (C. mitis) appear to be more sexually dimorphic than terrestrial vervet monkeys (C. aethiops).Cardini A, Elton S. 2008. Variation in guenon skulls (II): sexual dimorphism. Journal of Human Evolution 54:638-647. Niche divergence It has been hypothesized that niche divergence between the sexes attributes to the evolution of size dimorphism in primates. Males and females are known to have different preferences for ecological habitat due to different reproductive activities, which could possibly lead to dietary differences, followed by dimorphic morphological traits.Shine R. 1989. Ecological causes for the evolution of sexual dimorphism: a review of the evidence. The Quarterly Review of Biology 64(4):419-461. This niche divergence hypothesis, however, has never been strongly supported due to the lack of compelling data.

It is a part of the M3 highway which continues from Moscow to Kaluga and Bryansk to the border with Ukraine, and provides connections with Kiev and Odessa. It is also a part of the European route E101 connecting Moscow and Kiev. It is the second-widest street in Moscow after Leningradsky Avenue. Its width varies between 108 and 120 metres. Location Leninsky Avenue continues north beyond Kaluzhskaya Square as Yakimanka Street and southwest beyond the Ring Road as Kievskoye Highway. Oktyabrskaya, Leninsky Prospekt, and Troparyovo are the only three metro stations located at the avenue, the second one being named after the avenue itself. Troparyovo is located at the southern end of the avenue, at the intersection with Ostrovityanova Street. The major intersections are with the Zhitnaya Street/Krymsky Val (Kaluzhskaya Square), Avenue of 60th Anniversary of October Revolution and Kosygina Street (Gagarin Square, where the avenue also crosses the Moscow Little Ring Railway and the Third Ring Road), Universitetsky Avenue, Lomonosovsky Avenue, Obrucheva Street/Lobachevskogo Street, as well as Vernadsky Avenue. In terms of the administrative division, Leninsky Avenue runs through Yakimanka, Gagarinsky, Lomonosovsky, Obruchevsky, Prospekt Vernadskogo, Tyoply Stan, and Troparyovo-Nikulino Districts. History The location of the current avenue has been a road since before the 18th century. Only the area between Kaluzhskaya Square and Kaluzhskaya Zastava Square (currently Gagarin Square) was then included into Moscow, and the name of this stretch was Bolshaya Kaluzhskaya Street. Construction was active in that area between the 18th century and the 1940s. The road continued further as Kaluzhskoye Highway, and then as the highway from Moscow to Kiev. The three stretches were merged in 1957, and the street was given the name of Vladimir Lenin. In the 1940s and the 1950s construction took place along the stretch between Gagarin Square and Kravchenko Street. Notable landmarks In the vicinity of the avenue there are landmarks as such as Palace of Pioneers and Lebedev Physical Institute. Public transportation The stretch between Kaluzhskaya Square and Miklukho-Maklay Street is covered by trolleybus traffic. The whole avenue is covered by public bus traffic, though the routes typically take short stretches of the avenue, and there is no single route which travels through the whole length of the avenue.

It was inhabited from 1870 to 1929, and later used as a filming location. History The area was first settled in 1865 by a Mormon group led by Peter Shirts. This early settlement was named Rockhouse, for Shirts's strongly built sandstone house. After the end of the Black Hawk War in 1867 settlers began to arrive at a rapid pace. Farming produced good crops for several years, but irrigation was very difficult; each spring the surface runoff water was absorbed into the desert soil too quickly to properly water the fields. In 1870 the residents agreed to move the settlement. They divided in two groups; half the people went about upstream and founded the town of Pahreah. In 1871, John D. Lee came to the Paria area, fleeing investigators of the Mountain Meadows massacre. He constructed a dam and irrigation ditches with the help of many locals and passersby, including members of John Wesley Powell's second Colorado River expedition. Pahreah grew through the 1870s, gaining a general store, a church, a number of sandstone houses, and many log houses. The population grew to 47 families. The town hit hard times in the 1880s, however. The Paria River flooded every year from 1883 to 1888, washing away fields and even some buildings. People started to move away. By 1892 there were only eight families left, but for some reason the town was granted a post office that year, under the name Paria. Not much changed until a small gold mining operation was established here in 1911. Within a year, that too was wiped out by flooding. The post office closed in 1914. A lone bachelor prospector held out until 1929, then Paria was empty. Filming location Old Paria movie set In later years the film industry became interested in using the picturesque ghost town, with its canyon vista background, as a location for making Westerns. Several scenes for Buffalo Bill were shot here in 1943, but crews were in a constant struggle against the flooding Paria River. Producers of other movies and television programs used Paria more or less throughout the 1950s. Then in 1961 the old ghost town was used as a major location for the Rat Pack film Sergeants 3, the largest western ever filmed in Kane County. Not satisfied with what remained of Paria, the film's creators constructed an imitation Old West town about a mile to the west. Visitors often confused this movie set with the real Paria, as it fell into disuse after the filming of The Outlaw Josey Wales in 1976. After more flash flooding severely damaged the set in 1998, a team of volunteers and employees of the Bureau of Land Management disassembled the wreckage and replaced the structures in 1999-2001\\\\. New interpretive signs explained the movie set's significance and distinguished it from Paria itself. Then in 2006 the rebuilt set was destroyed by a suspicious fire. In 2007, Paria was used as a filming location by the independent film The Attic Door. A facade of a house was built in the footprint of the previous set, then moved to the nearby town of Kanab.

In 1990, the Company acquired Golf Card International, Inc. for approximately $18 million. Subsequently, in May 1994, AGI acquired Woodall Publishing Company, L.P. and Woodall World of Travel, L.P. (collectively Woodall's) for approximately $11.5 million. In October 1993, AGI completed a leveraged recapitalization consisting of a $50 million credit facility and a $120 million of 11¬Ω% AGI senior subordinated notes due 2003. As part of the recapitalization, Stephen Adams increased his fully diluted ownership from approximately 71% to approximately 97%. In 1995, AGI acquired San Francisco Thrift and Loan (founded in 1982) and the company's headquarters were relocated to Ventura, California.

Affinity Bank had 10 branches. The FDIC estimates Affinity's failure will cost its deposit insurance fund $254 million. In March 1997, as part of the Company's $130 million offering of the holding company notes due 2007, AGI acquired Camping World, Inc. and Ehlert Publishing for approximately $123 million and $22.3 million, respectively.Just About Everything in the World You Would Ever Want to Know About Affinity Group‚Äôs Acquisition of Camping World (RV News Online, 1997)Affinity Group to Acquire a Retailer and a Publisher (The New York Times, March 4, 1997)Affinity Group to Buy Ehlert Publishing.

In October 1998, the Company issued $200 million of senior secured credit facilities to repay its then existing senior credit facility as well as the AGI Subordinated Notes, and in December 2001 the Company completed a $52.3 million property sale / leaseback transaction, the proceeds of which were used to repay senior indebtedness. On August 15, 2009, AGI failed to make a $6.2 million interest payment to bondholders, and Standard & Poors subsequently lowered AGI's credit rating to D. Standard & Poor reported that they had taken this view because bondholders will be receiving less than par value for the notes and because of the company's highly leveraged financial profile, weak operating outlook, and limited liquidity given the near-term maturity of its senior credit facility. In May 2011, AGI announced that it was changing the company's name to Good Sam Enterprises. Ehlert Publishing was spun off by 2013 as a separate company under the control of the Adams family.

He has published more than 620 scientific papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals that are indexed in the most referent biomedical scientific database Medline. He has been author and co-author of more than 20 books relevant to the fields of neuroscience, psychiatry and neurology. Biography Peter Franz Riederer was born in K√∂nigsberg, then part of Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia). He holds bachelor‚Äôs and doctorate degrees in Technical Chemistry from the Technical University of Vienna. Before he embraced neuroscience he had completed scientific studies at the Nuclear reactor Center Seibersdorf in Austria. At the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute in Vienna he was introduced to the field of neurochemistry and neuroscience by Walther Birkmayer, who was a head of the L. Boltzmann Institute of Neurochemistry and head of the Department of Neurology at Lainz Hospital. Birkmayer was the first doctor who was administering Levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. From 1971 to 1986 Riederer served as Chief of Clinical Neurochemistry at the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute conducting numerous studies on postmortem brains of patients with neurological and psychiatric diseases.

The U.S. Army equivalent unit is the headquarters and headquarters company. Introduction In identifying a specific headquarters unit, it is usually referred to by its abbreviation as H&S; company. While a line company is formed of three or four platoons, a headquarters and service company is made up of the battalion headquarters, which includes the battalion or regimental command section and the battalion/regimental headquarters executive staff, and headquarters support personnel of a battalion, or regiment. As these personnel do not fall inside one of the line companies of the battalion or regiment, the H&S; company is the unit to which they are administratively assigned. The typical personnel strength of an average H&S; company for a Marine infantry battalion is 269 personnel. A headquarters and service battery is found in most Marine units. Battalion headquarters Inside a typical battalion H&S; company, the battalion headquarters command section (CO, XO, and SgtMaj) and the battalion headquarters executive staff will usually include the following key personnel and primary staff officers: { * a battalion commander, usually a lieutenant colonel * a battalion executive officer, usually a major * a battalion sergeant major, (the senior enlisted advisor to the battalion commander on enlisted personnel matters, especially those involving discipline and morale). * a manpower officer (administration and personnel) with the title of \\"adjutant\\" (S1), usually a first or second lieutenant * an intelligence and counterintelligence officer (S2), usually a captain * an operations and training officer (S3), usually a major * a logistics officer (S4), usually a captain * a communications and information officer (S6), usually a first or second lieutenant } Most of the executive staff sections (the \\"S\\" sections) contain at least one additional officer (S-1 & S-2) or up to several additional officers (S-3 has seven and S-4 has three) who serve as assistant staff officers or as functional managers within the staff section. An infantry battalion has one Navy Chaplain Corps officer (chaplain) and two Navy Medical Corps officers (surgeons), collectively referred to as the \\"special staff,\\" as well as essential Navy and Marine Corps staff non-commissioned officers (SNCOs), chief petty officers (CPOs), non-commissioned officers, petty officers, and junior enlisted Marines and Navy hospital corpsmen who serve as support personnel in the occupational specialities of the executive staff sections (S1 through S4 and the S6) and special staff sections (chaplain and medical). Battalion H&S; company The H&S; company is commanded by a company commander (usually a captain) who is supported by a company executive officer (usually a first lieutenant), a company first sergeant, and a company gunnery sergeant. All personnel in H&S; fall under the administrative command of the H&S; company commander (dual-hatted as the \\"headquarters commandant\\") who is responsible for managing the physical support of the battalion headquarters including security, billeting, messing, facilities, and utilities. In practice, the battalion executive officer and sergeant major, as well as the primary and special staff officers, report directly to the battalion commander. While the battalion commander is administratively assigned to H&S;, he or she is the H&S; company commander's immediate higher commander and thus the H&S; company commander operationally answers directly to the battalion commander. The mission of the H&S; company commander is to run the administrative and Marine training aspects of H&S;, and to support the battalion primary staff by facilitating the environment in which they operate and in turn support the battalion commander in commanding the battalion. To perform this service and support mission, the H&S; company of an infantry battalion contains additional personnel assigned to support and sustain the mission of the battalion headquarters and provide general support services to the entire battalion. These personnel are organized into a scout sniper platoon (organic to the S-2/Intelligence section, commanded by the assistant intelligence officer), a communications platoon (commanded by the S-6), a service platoon (including supply, armory, motor transport, TOW anti-tank missile system maintenance, and dining facility sections, with the battalion supply officer as the service platoon commander), and a medical platoon (consisting entirely of Navy personnel and commanded by the senior ranking officer of the battalion's two surgeons). Regimental headquarters company At the regimental level, the headquarters company is significantly smaller, having an authorized strength of only 182 members. The reason for the smaller manpower is that the regimental H&S; Company does not have subordinate companies to support as does the battalion H&S.; Therefore, its S-1 section and service platoon are significantly smaller, and there is no medical platoon, as it is only supporting the regimental headquarters company rather than an entire infantry battalion consisting of several companies and almost 1,000 members. Also, there is no scout sniper platoon in the regimental H&S; Company, making the S-2 section smaller, further reducing manpower totals. (When task organized into a Regimental Combat Team as part of a MAGTF, the regiment is usually supported by an attached reconnaissance company from the regiment's parent Marine Division's reconnaissance battalion, as well as by other ground combat support assets allocated from its parent MARDIV.) While the company commander of a regimental H&S; company remains as a captain, the ranks of many of the staff and support personnel are typically higher than those found at the battalion level to reflect the greater degree of responsibility and authority resident in a higher echelon of command. The S-3 and S-4 sections are slightly larger (perhaps reflecting the greater responsibility for planning and supervising current and future operations inherent in these staff sections) and there is a somewhat larger communications platoon (largely due to significantly greater allocation of manpower in the regimental communications center as compared to the battalion's message center). Headquarters battery (field artillery) and headquarters and service battery (LAADBn) In keeping with the long-standing practice of referring to company-sized artillery units as \\"batteries\\" the headquarters company equivalent element of an artillery battalion or regiment, or a low altitude air defense battalion, is referred to as a headquarters battery (field artillery) or a headquarters and service battery (-) (LAAD) / headquarters and service battery detachment. Each Marine artillery battalion has a 199-member battalion headquarters battery that contains the battalion headquarters, an operations platoon, a service platoon, a communications platoon, and the battery headquarters (T/O 1142G). A Marine artillery regiment has a 380-member regimental headquarters battery consisting of the regimental headquarters, an operations platoon, a communications platoon, the battery headquarters, an artillery electronic maintenance section, an engineer equipment platoon, a motor transport section, and a counter battery radar platoon (T/O 1101H). Additionally, some headquarters elements for certain units, particularly MAGTFs or Marine Aviation units, are not officially designated as a \\"company\\" and are sometimes informally referred to as \\"detachments.\\" as a result, these units are usually referred to as headquarters and service, or headquarters detachments. Headquarters battalion, Marine division A Marine division has instead a headquarters (HQ) battalion commanded by a colonel. The HQ battalion consists of the division headquarters command and general staff (\\"G\\" sections), battalion headquarters command and executive staff (\\"S\\" sections), a headquarters company (including the division band), a communications company and a truck company.

Cadogan later served as aide-de-camp to successive British monarchs and received promotion to full admiral. The son of Charles Cadogan, 3rd Baron Cadogan and his second wife Mary Churchill, Cadogan inherited his father's titles from his half brother Charles in 1832 and became the third Earl Cadogan. He was also created 1st Baron Oakley of Caversham on 10 September 1831. Later in life, Cadogan was elected to become a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London and died in 1864. Life George Cadogan was born in 1783 at St James's Square in London, the eighth son of Charles Cadogan, 3rd Baron Cadogan and the second son of Mary Churchill, the Baron's second wife. George would follow his brother Thomas, 29 years his senior, into the Royal Navy, although Thomas had drowned in an accident in 1782. Joining the Navy aged 13 in 1796, Cadogan served in the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1804 Commander Cadogan was captain of the 18-gun ship-sloop .

Summary  The main character of the story, who seems to have no actual name. He is Don Coladangelo's personal \\"clean-up guy\\". He has no remorse for cold-blooded murder as long as it serves his boss' desires. His reasons for blindly serving the Don are never revealed, only that he has \\"some ties\\" to the mob boss. He is only called \\"The Trigger Man\\". The game opens with Don Coladangelo holding a meeting between him, his capo Ralph Borrello, and the game's protagonist, The Trigger Man. He relays the information that the Montagano family is moving against the Coladangelos due to the murder of Tony Montagano, Don Montagano's only son and successor to the Montagano Family. The Trigger Man proclaims his readiness to \\"deal with\\" the Montagano's any way the Don sees fit. Don Coladangelo then asks his favorite assassin to convince the Montagano's of their innocence in Tony's murder, and to persuade them to call off the vendetta with an apology. Ralph Borrello then informs Trigger Man of a diamond smuggling operation being used to finance the Montagano's new casino, and that the diamonds are more than likely being moved fast, as their funds have been drastically depleted, and proclaiming war amongst mob families is anything but cheap. The Don seems certain they're keeping the diamonds in a high-tech vault inside the casino, and hires you to steal them, in order to cut out the Montagano's income, and possibly ending the war before it starts.

Upper and lower halves Clear Creek is neatly divided by the bluffs of the Mississippi into two sections: nearer its headwaters it is a relatively clean and swift-flowing hill river, and in its lower half, below the bluff, it has become a channelized ditch, the Clear Creek Ditch (coordinates: ). Clear Creek rises in the uplands of the Shawnee Hills near Cobden, Illinois. In its upper reaches, Clear Creek is an unusually clean and undisturbed stream for Illinois, as its watershed includes two of the largest wilderness areas in Illinois, Bald Knob Wilderness and Clear Springs Wilderness. Another section of the creek's watershed is protected by the Trail of Tears State Forest, and most of the remainder of the watershed is protected by the non-wilderness parcels of Shawnee National Forest. West of Jonesboro, Illinois, Clear Creek descends from the Shawnee Hills into the bottomland of the Mississippi River. In historical times, the stream fed a ribbon-shaped wetland that ran southward and parallel to the Mississippi River for approximately before discharging into a former watercourse of the main river, the Picayune Chute, east of Cape Girardeau, Missouri. Part of this wetland has been conserved as the Union County State Fish and Wildlife Area, but during the 20th century most of it was extensively ditched and drained for mosquito abatement and to promote agriculture. Engineers dug a ditch that carries Clear Creek's drainage southward a further and takes in further runoff from adjacent Shawnee Hills creeks. The creek/ditch currently discharges into the Mississippi close to Thebes, Illinois.

His mother, Maria Michiel, and his wife Regina Gradenigo, both came from Dogal families. He had served as Venetian Procurator in Rome, and his brief reign was largely concerned with the end of the Second Turkish‚ÄìVenetian War. He probably died of plague. The process of his election as Doge resulted in a divisive split in the Council, that resulted in bad feelings: in 1477 Antonio Feleto was imprisoned, then banished, for remarking in public that the Council of the Forty-One must have been hard-pressed to elect a cheesemonger Doge.According to Domenico Malipiero. The diarist Malipiero noted that Andrea Vendramin at the time of his election was worth 160,000 ducats, after allowing for 6 to 7000 ducats with which he had endowed each of six daughters, in order to procure politically influential sons-in- law.

Intensifiers are grammatical expletives, specifically expletive attributives (or, equivalently, attributive expletives or attributive-only expletives; they also qualify as expressive attributives), because they function as semantically vacuous filler. Characteristically, English draws intensifiers from a class of words called degree modifiers, words that quantify the idea they modify. More specifically, they derive from a group of words called adverbs of degree, also known as degree adverbs. When used grammatically as intensifiers, these words cease to be degree adverbs, because they no longer quantify the idea they modify; instead, they emphasize it emotionally. By contrast, the words moderately, slightly, and barely are degree adverbs, but not intensifiers. The other hallmark of prototypical intensifiers is that they are adverbs which lack the primary characteristic of adverbs: the ability to modify verbs. Intensifiers modify exclusively adjectives and adverbs, but this rule is insufficient to classify intensifiers, since there exist other words commonly classified as adverbs that never modify verbs but are not intensifiers, e.g. questionably. For these reasons, Huddleston argues that intensifier not be recognized as a primary grammatical or lexical category. Intensifier is a category with grammatical properties, but insufficiently defined unless its functional significance is also described (what Huddleston calls a notional definition). Technically, intensifiers roughly qualify a point on the affective semantic property, which is gradable. Syntactically, intensifiers pre-modify either adjectives or adverbs. Semantically, they increase the emotional content of an expression. The basic intensifier is very. A versatile word, English permits very to modify adjectives and adverbs, but not verbs. Other intensifiers often express the same intention as very. Examples of English intensifiers Syntax Not all intensifiers are the same syntactically‚Äîthey vary on whether they can be used attributively or predicatively. For example, really and super can be used in both ways:Tagliamonte, Sali A. (2012). Variationist Sociolinguistics. UK: Wiley-Blackwell. p.9 ::a. The car is really expensive. \\\\- Predicative intensifier ::b. the really expensive car \\\\- Attributive intensifier ::a. Today was super cold. \\\\- Predicative intensifier ::b. a super cold day \\\\- Attributive intensifier Words such as so can only occur as predicative intensifiers while others, such as -ass, typically are only attributive intensifiers: ::a. The car is so expensive. \\\\- Predicative intensifier ::b. *the so expensive car \\\\- Attributive intensifier (not grammatical) ::a. *Today was cold-ass. \\\\- Predicative intensifier (not grammatical)The exception to this is badass which appears to be the source of this intensifier rather than an instance of it. ::b. a cold-ass day \\\\- Attributive intensifier There is dialectal variation in the \\"correctness\\" of certain forms. Illocutionary force Use of an intensifier subtly suggests to the reader what emotion he should feel. By naming an emotion within the predicate, the writer compels the reader to consider this emotion and hence he begins to feel it. Persuasiveness, credibility  Legal  In general, overuse of intensifiers negatively affects the persuasiveness or credibility of a legal argument. But if a judge's authoritative written opinion uses a high rate of intensifiers, a lawyer's written appeal of that opinion that also uses a high rate of intensifiers is associated with an increase in favorable outcomes for such appeals. Also, when judges disagree with each other in writing, they tend to use more intensifiers.  Business  A 2010 Stanford Graduate School of Business study found that, in quarterly earnings conference calls, deceptive CEOs use a greater percent quantity of \\"extreme positive emotions words\\" than CEOs telling the truth. This finding agrees with the presumption that a CEO attempting to hide poor performance exerts herself more forcefully to persuade her listeners. David F. Larcker and Zakolyukinaz give a list of 115 extreme positive emotions words, including intensifiers: awful, deucedly, emphatically, excellently, fabulously, fantastically, genuinely, gloriously, immensely, incredibly, insanely, keenly, madly, magnificently, marvelously, splendidly, supremely, terrifically, truly, unquestionably, wonderfully, very [good]. A 2013 Forbes Magazine article about counterproductive modes of expression in English specifically discouraged use of really, observing that it provokes doubt and degrades the speaker's credibility: \\"'Really' ‚Äì Finder calls this a 'poor attempt to instill candor and truthfulness' that makes clients and coworkers question whether you're really telling the truth.\\" Quotes Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, in Human, All Too Human (1878), wrote: > The narrator.

Personal communication Gaynor Whyles JERA Consulting Ltd  The EIAG Forward Commitment Procurement Project  The Forward Commitment Procurement project (managed on behalf BERR and DEFRA by Gaynor Whyles of JERA Consulting Ltd (previously JPS Consulting) from June 2005) set out to design and test a supply chain management tool for the public sector, in line with public procurement regulations, that would create the necessary market pull for environmental products and services and hence create the conditions that would support investment in the environmental industries sector. The project involved: ‚Ä¢ designing a supply chain management approach and procurement process that was in line with public procurement regulations ‚Ä¢ testing this through a demonstration project ‚Ä¢ designing a mechanism to enable the scale up and replication of the approach The EIAG FCP demonstration project was undertaken in partnership with Her Majesties Prison Services (HMPS) and the Office of Government Commerce (OGC). The role of OGC was to provide professional public procurement expertise and advice to the EIAG Project Manager to ensure that the FCP model was compliant with public procurement regulations and reflected best practice. The FCP model built upon and made practical guidance published by OGC in its information leaflet entitled Capturing Innovation (OGC, 2004)  FCP Demonstration Project: Zero Waste Prison Mattress  HMPS were buying in the order of 60,000 highly flame retardant, polyurethane foam mattresses and pillows per year and disposing of around 40,000, mainly to landfill, but with a significant number also being disposed of as clinical waste. The combined cost of supply and disposal was estimated to be well in excess of ¬£3 million per year. In short, the way in which mattresses were disposed of was costly and environmentally unsustainable and out of step with HMPS sustainable development policy. There had been several attempts to find a solution none of which had delivered a meaningful result. HMPS had an 'unmet need' for a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable solution. Further consideration of the problem led HMPS to identify the following requirement: ‚ÄúHMPS aspires to a zero waste prison mattress that meets or exceeds current operational requirements and delivers whole life cycle cost efficiencies. By 2012, HMPS wants all its mattresses and pillows not classified as hazardous waste to be recycled, repurposed or reused instead of going to landfill; and to reduce to 2 per cent pa the number of mattresses disposed of as hazardous or clinical waste‚Äù.Call for innovative solutions and information. PROSPECTUS for the market sounding exercise regarding: A Zero Waste Mattress System for HM Prison Services (HMPS. Innovation in the delivery of environmental sustainability throughout the life cycle of prison mattresses This requirement was then communicated to the market in a market sounding exercise in the form of a 'call for innovation and information', designed and managed by the EIAG FCP team. (Market sounding is a way of ‚Äúassessing the reaction of the market to a proposed requirement and procurement approach, in order to bring supplier perspectives to public sector procurements at an early stage‚Äù.Early Market Engagement: principles and examples of best practice, Office of Government Commerce Guide 2006 This exercise involved the publication of a Prior Information Notice in the Official Journal of the European Union and the engagement of intermediaries, such as the BERR funded Knowledge Transfer Networks, trade bodies and similar, to communicate notification of the call to the potential supply chain. Detailed information on the requirement, the context for the call and the scale of the market opportunity were provided in a market sounding prospectus, and HMPS offered to consider a ‚Äòforward commitment contract‚Äô to enable the take up of innovative solutions.Call for innovative solutions and information. PROSPECTUS for the market sounding exercise regarding: A Zero Waste Mattress System for HM Prison Services (HMPS). Innovation in the delivery of environmental sustainability throughout the life cycle of prison mattresses Over 36 high quality responses were received, and from which a range of options were identified. A directory of companies and organisations that responded to the call was published on the HMPS procurement website to assist supply chain development and a 'Concept Viability' workshop involving a cross section of the supply chain that submitted responses was held to discuss the options available and inform the HMPS mattress procurement strategy. The market engagement process led HMPS to adopt a completely different approach to the procurement of its mattresses and pillows. HMPS is at the concluding stages of a procurement exercise for a 'cradle to cradle' managed service to supply zero waste mattress and pillows. The final stage of evaluation is underway and HMPS is confident that all of the shortlisted bids will be able to deliver the requirement (see above), and in addition estimates that it will save between ¬£3-¬£5 million over the life of the contract. > ‚ÄúSustainable procurement has been talked about for years but the Prison > Service launching a competition for zero waste mattresses was one of the few > truly innovative examples CEMEP came across‚Äù Julie Hill, Member of the > Commission on Environmental Markets and Economic Performance, from issue 18 > of Inside Track magazine, Autumn 2007.

It was completed in 1991 and has 54 floors. Frank Williams and Associates, headed by architect Frank Williams, designed the building, which is the 114th tallest building in New York, and was tallest in the Upper East Side for 26 years, until surpassed in 2017 by 520 Park Avenue. History The property had previously been occupied by the New York Foundling Hospital, which businessman Donald Trump purchased in 1985. Prior to the sale, community groups had unsuccessfully lobbied city agencies to prevent a high-rise building from being constructed on the site. Construction of the 55-floor Trump Palace began in April 1989, with a planned completion date of 1991, at a cost of $185 million. Community groups had also made an unsuccessful attempt to have the building's 623-foot height decreased, although Trump had initially planned for a larger building to go on the site, and decided against including a five- screen movie theater on the property. The tower, made of granite, was designed by architect Frank Williams to resemble Art Deco buildings of the 1920s and 1930s. The New York Times gave the building a mixed review: \\"On the positive side, Trump Palace's central tower, rising 54 stories from a base of low-rise shops and town houses, is a skillful composition of brick and glass. Shallow set-backs and the organization of windows and balconies into neat horizontal and vertical bands compress the tower's mass into crystalline contours. Corner windows, borrowed from the Century and the Majestic, adorn the edges of the tower like faceted gems . . . Trump Palace makes little effort to fit into its surroundings. It wants to stick out on the skyline like a prima donna.\\" The newspaper wrote that the high-rise, rather than a homage to the architecture of the 1920s and 1930s, was more of a \\"hangover\\" from the 1980s: \\"That is its true period style. And the staggering views from the apartments bring that period deliriously back to life. Gazing out their windows, a visitor comes face to face with the soaring designer skyscrapers of those gilded years, each tower trying to upstage the others like sumptuously costumed guests at a charity ball.\\" Low-rise townhouses are located at the tower's base along with a small plaza, both of which were part of a zoning requirement.

Role in growth of home video industry Blay co-founded Stereodyne, the nation's first eight-track and cassette duplication company, in 1966. Blay then founded an audio/video production and duplication company in 1968 called Magnetic Video. He also started the Video Club of America, a direct-mail sales operation through which he offered the video cassettes produced and duplicated at Magnetic Video. He advertised the club through TV Guide, and nine thousand users initially joined the club. That subsequently provided the model for and enabled the creation of the first video rental stores, many of which were soon started thereafter. He was later recognized by the Consumer Electronics Association as creating the idea that \\"sparked a retail revolution as hundreds of mom-and-pop video rental and sales stores popped up in every community in America.\\" In 1987, home video rental income surpassed movie theater revenues for the first time. Today, movie studios routinely make more money on video rentals and sales than from the box office of theaters. CEO of 20th Century Fox Video In the late 1970s, Blay paid a flat fee of $300,000 plus $500,000 yearly to 20th Century Fox to license movies from their catalogue, which he then duplicated and distributed, earning a royalty generated per video rented. This proved so successful that 20th Century Fox quickly bought Magnetic Video in 1979 to form the 20th Century Fox Video unit, for $7.2 million. Blay then served as the first CEO of 20th Century Fox Video. Blay Video Blay left Fox in 1981 and subsequently formed Andre Blay Corporation, a video software firm. Through this newly formed company, Blay acquired the home video rights to 90 feature films.

Featuring a mostly female cast, Breathful is meant to promote gender equality and women's rights, particularly the rights of women from Shokof's homeland, Iran. Shokof has said that the word was created by himself and that the film was a homage to the film Breathless by Jean-Luc Godard. Plot synopsis Two friends, Berta Taies Farzan and Fuss Narges Rashidi, get drugs on credit from the drug lord Sigi (Monika Schubert) in an attempt to get rich. When they are unable to sell the drugs they bring them back to Sigi and ask her to forget the deal. Still needing money, Berta continues to hold up store clerks while Fuss leisurely calls on her society friends, much to Berta's aggravation. Fuss soon suggests that they become painters and sell their art for a living, so that Berta may stop her dangerous store robberies. The two friends try out Fuss‚Äô plans, and put on a show exhibiting their paintings. Their newly found success ends abruptly, however, when Fuss has an affair with Naomi (Tina McErvale), Sigi's daughter, provoking the drug lord and causing her to kill the two artists. The film ends in a shootout, and the bloody bodies of Berta and Fuss are carried off the screen by the mysterious taxi-driver, Benny Hur (Souzan Alavi). Cast * Taies Farzan * Narges Rashidi * Jasmin Wagner * Tina Mcervale * Souzan Alavi * Barbara Kowa * Marina Welsch * Monika Schubert * Daryush Shokof Art Design * Daryush Shokof Background Shokof cast two Iranian lead actresses, Taies Frazan and Narges Rashidi, to enhance Breathful's message of gender equality. In his native country of Iran, women are unjustly treated by the country's leaders, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, influential religious officials, and the traditional Muslim society as a whole. By adapting a genre that is usually dominated by men, the gangster film, and not making use of a single male actor throughout, Shokof shows that women are just as capable as their male counterparts. Production The film was produced by Daryush Shokof, Taies Farzan, Shahin Shokoofandeh entirely in Berlin, Germany.

They were closely associated and often shared bills with those and other Chicago acts such as Triple Fast Action, Smoking Popes, and Hushdrops. The band's name was said to have been chosen for its resemblance, when pronounced, to the vulgar German phrase fick dich. That‚Äôs What Love Songs Often Do, Fig Dish's 1995 major label debut album which had been out of print for years, was re-released in April 2013. Chicago Magazine wrote that the band was a \\"folkloric Chicago outfit,\\" and quoted Blake Smith's summary of the band's career: \\"We were too busy being the underdog Midwestern raging partying guys, and it killed us.... We just weren‚Äôt very good at playing the game, and we drank a lot back in those days.\\" The band reportedly \\"blew their first big chance at a signing when they opted to play an entire set of Neil Diamond covers at an A&R; showcase at the now-defunct Avalon nightclub.\\" Live shows by Fig Dish in Chicago became popular with a small devoted fan base due to the inclusion of goofy banter and audience interaction, and an apparent embrace of a drunken rock club party atmosphere. Fig Dish participated in the first and many subsequent Halloween shows at Chicago's Double Door. Some live shows included an encore of classic rock numbers that showcased guest vocalist Wes Kidd of Triple Fast Action, who performed apparently intoxicated and dressed in a pink bunny suit. In September 1998, the band broke with their recording label, A&M; Records. According to Rolling Stone, the band considered its lack of widespread recognition to be the fault of the label's \\"zero effort\\" to provide exposure outside of Chicago, concluding, \\"The final straw was an estimated $80,000 soft-porn music video the quartet made for the single 'When Shirts Get Tight,' which featured a handful of elite porn stars. The band reportedly picked up the tab for both clean and dirty versions of the video, but neither of them received any airplay on MTV.\\" In contrast to the comedic video, the song's lyrics showcased the depth of the band's musical knowledge with lines quoted from Game Theory's song \\"Friend of the Family,\\" from Real Nighttime (1985). Musical careers after Fig Dish Several members of Fig Dish have gone on to form or work with other bands: * Blake Smith and Mike Willison formed Caviar in 1999. They later joined forces with Local H frontman Scott Lucas in the electronica project The Prairie Cartel. As of 2015, Smith was the lead singer for Chicago-based noise-pop band Forgotten Species, which released its debut EP, Hades Fades, in January 2015. * Rick Ness went on to play with The Cells and The Webb Brothers. He also started his own project, Ness, with Veruca Salt's Jim Shapiro. * Bill Swartz was also a member of Ness, along with John San Juan from The Hushdrops, and Jonny Polonsky. * Brian Nolan joined drummer Stacy Jones in 1998 to form BMX Girl, which later became American Hi- Fi.

In 1985, the skyscraper was renamed for its new owners, The Bartlett Company. The company sold the building for $8 million in 2006. At the time, it was also home to Fosdick & Hilmer (engineering firm), an American Airlines reservation center, CVS Pharmacy, Phillip Bortz Jewelers, and Jimmy John's among many others. In June 2010, after a second failed sale of the building, Fifth Third Bank foreclosed on the property and all tenants vacated the building. An affiliate of Columbus real estate firm E.V. Bishoff Co. acquired the building on February 8, 2013 for $535,000, ending more than five years of legal limbo for the vacant tower. In May of that same year, it was announced that the building would be converted into a $33 million hotel.

The film is about a man named Archie, portrayed by Anthony Quinn, who wishes to unite and \\"connect\\" the races until his last breath. The film premiered at the 1996 Locarno Film Festival. Plot A wealthy old man named Archie hires seven servants of both genders and different races to get connected to him by plugging his body openings and remain connected to him until his last breath. The servants are to stay connected to the old man's body for the next ten days. They eat, sleep, and even use the bathroom and fight thieves together. The party for his reunion with old friends is a lavish one. It includes the once love of his life (Hilda, portrayed by Alexandra Stewart), the one and only true friend he ever had (David Warner), and the Opera singer (Audra McDonald in her film debut) plus the maid (Sonja Kirchberger). The servants overcome many difficulties by staying \\"united which is the core reason for the whole ritual\\". The best friends are asked to fill up the remaining openings of his body. Hilda is set upon him to do the final act of love between the two of them, something they never ever did though they have loved each other most of their lives. She commits to the act. Then it is time for David Warner to plug up his rear hole, an act he refuses to deliver and the beautiful maid takes the responsibility on her shoulders and does the impossible act of filling his rear end hole instead of David Warner having to go through the pain. In the final scene where all his openings are filled up except for his mouth, it is time for the opera singer to plug up his facial opening while singing a most beautiful opera piece. She sings with the greatest heavenly voice by Audra McDonald into his mouth and thus takes the last breath away from him as she blocks his mouth with her lips hence delivering the last kiss of death and preventing Archie from ever breathing again. Archie dies in peace, in pleasure and harmony for he achieved unity of the races around him though he pays for this eternal obsession and desire with his life. The plot is in actuality Shokof's own manifest of yekishim with which he believes the human beings have only come to earth to unite both in heart and mind. Archie ascends to the heavens while his round bed turns in circle and joins the skies and the stars in the universe peacefully. Unification prevails amongst the servants even though it is just a bodily experience and through him as the catalyst.

Reception American Cinematographer wrote that it \\"presents a truly eccentric premise ... Seven Servants Iranian born director, Daryush Shokof, is a former painter whose experimental art videos were, he admits, 'too conceptual or philosophical to win mainstream acclaim.' This video work, however, gave him tremendous freedom to experiment with the camera, framing and lighting techniques that he applied to his first celluloid project.\\" David Rooney of the magazine Variety wrote, \\"If it didn't lapse midway into monotony, Seven Servants might have made its mark as a camp classic of high-art folly. This twaddle about an oldster drawing on youth and vitality by having an ethnically balanced bunch of hired hands jam their fingers in his ears and nostrils is just an elaborately embroidered account of going out with a bang.\\" MovieWeb wrote, \\"In this film from Iranian director Daryush Shokof, Anthony Quinn plays an elderly man who wants to exit earth in a state of unity with all creatures. To that end, he hires a quartet of manservants to plug his facial orifices with their fingers. Not your typical solution, but it seems to work for Archie (Quinn), who moves through the rest of the film thus connected. Audra McDonald appears in the final moments to sing a \\"death aria\\" into his mouth.\\"http://movieweb.com/movie/seven-servants/ After Quinn's death, Contactmusic.com quoted Quinn as saying that Seven Servants was \\"really a film for the 21st century\\". According to them, Quinn felt that the film was \\"too visionary\\" and should be withheld from release until the 21st century. Referring to the film's delayed release, they said that it was \\"worth the wait\\".

The Portuguese police investigation into her disappearance closed in July 2008. Scotland Yard began a review of the investigation, known as Operation Grange, in May 2011, and announced in April 2012 that they believed Madeleine might still be alive. Since the disappearance, there have been many reported sightings of Madeleine in Portugal and elsewhere. Portugal 3 May 2007 =Tanner, 21:15= The first possible sighting was around 21:15 on 3 May, 45 minutes before Madeleine's mother raised the alarm. Jane Tanner, who was travelling with the McCanns, noticed a man walking along the road on which the McCanns' holiday apartment was situated.Caroline Gammell, \\"Madeleine McCann: Map 'shows where abductor was spotted'\\", The Daily Telegraph, 5 August 2008. She said he was carrying a barefoot child who was wearing light-coloured pink pyjamas with a floral pattern.Michelle Pauli, \\"Is this Madeleine McCann's abductor?\\", The Guardian, 26 October 2007. *Martin Hodgson, \\"McCanns release sketch of man seen near apartment\\", The Guardian, 26 October 2007. Scotland Yard has since ruled this out, saying in October 2013 that a British holidaymaker who was carrying his child home at that time had been identified, was believed to be the man seen by Tanner, and was not involved in the abduction. =Smith, 22:00= A second sighting is being taken seriously by Scotland Yard. At around 22:00, an Irish family saw a man carrying a young girl on Rua da Escola Prim√°ria. They described her as four years old, wearing light-coloured pyjamas, with blonde hair and pale skin. They said the man was in his mid-30s, 1.75‚Äì1.80 m in height, with a slim-to-normal build, short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers with a black leather jacket.\\"Stranger may hold key to Madeleine McCann's disappearance, says ex-RUC man\\", Belfast Telegraph, 7 May 2009. Scotland Yard issued an efit of the man on 13 October 2013.Sandra Laville, \\"British detectives release efits of Madeleine McCann suspect\\", The Guardian, 14 October 2013. *\\"Madeleine McCann search: E-fit man 'was seen carrying child'\\", BBC News, 14 October 2013. 4‚Äì17 May On the evening of 4 May, Antonio Castela, a taxi driver, took three men, a woman, and a girl resembling Madeleine from Monte Gordo to the Hotel Apolo in Vila Real de Santo Ant√≥nio, where they drove away in a blue Jeep. He said that he had recorded the sighting with the PJ but that they had not contacted him again. A Portuguese trucker telephoned the M√©todo 3 helpline in November reporting that he had seen a blonde woman pass a child wrapped in a blanket to a man, who then 'bundled' her into a car. He said this took place two days after the disappearance, in the Algarve town of Silves. Police in the mountainous town of Nelas, northern central Portugal, received information of a girl matching Madeleine's description who was seen with a man in a supermarket on 8 May. The man, a Belgian citizen, stopped at the supermarket with his daughter and left the place in a car before police were contacted, but police later confirmed that the sighting had been a false alarm. People in the resort came forward to report unusual incidents including a woman who noticed a man trying to take away a pram and a man who caught a stranger taking photographs of young blonde girls on a beach. Portuguese police also investigated a report by holidaymaker Andre van Wyk. Van Wyk claimed that, shortly after the disappearance, he had seen a girl resembling Madeleine being taken in a cart to a gypsy camp near Portim√£o, about from where Madeleine disappeared. On 9 May, the 24 Horas newspaper reported that police had found a vehicle near Praia da Luz that may have been used by the kidnapper. Further, CCTV video from a petrol station near Lagos showed a child matching Madeleine's description with a woman and two men. The child was having an altercation with the woman. The following day it was reported that the car from the petrol station had British number plates and it was claimed that the person caught taking photographs was one of the men on the CCTV footage. An anonymous witness contacted police claiming to have spotted a Fiat Marea with a forged license plate in Pinhal Novo, Palmela, Set√∫bal, on May 17, which allegedly transported the missing child. Spain Two women reported seeing a child who looked like Madeleine with a man at a petrol station near Cartagena, Spain, on 21 August 2007. This was discounted after a thorough investigation by the Spanish National Police and Civil Guard. There was a further reported sighting, in early April 2012, on the Costa del Sol. Morocco Marie Olli, a Norwegian woman living in the Spanish town of Fuengirola, contacted the police on 10 May 2007, claiming she had seen a girl matching Madeleine's description in a petrol station in Marrakech, Morocco. The girl, who was said to have appeared sad, was allegedly accompanied by a man in his late 30s. At about the same time, a British tourist reported seeing Madeleine near the Marrakech Ibis hotel. Although Interpol subsequently discounted these sightings, officers from Leicestershire police remained in Morocco for some days afterwards. A Spanish tourist saw a girl resembling Madeleine as she drove through the town of Zaio in northern Morocco at the end of May. Attention switched back to Morocco on 4 June, after GCHQ in Cheltenham picked up phone intercept messages in Arabic referring to \\"the little blonde girl\\", a German man, and a ferry from Tarifa in Spain. Another Spanish tourist, Isabel Gonzalez, has said that she saw a girl fitting Madeleine's description being dragged across a street, also in Zaio, by a North African woman on 15 June. Naoual Malhi, a Spanish woman of Moroccan origin, claimed to have spotted the girl with a woman in the village of Fnideq, on 21 August, but private investigators were unable to substantiate the lead. A photograph of a blonde girl being carried on the back of a North African woman was taken on 31 August by Clara Torres, another Spanish tourist, in Zinat in northern Morocco, but it turned out to be a Moroccan girl. A school inspector claimed to have seen the child in Karia Ba Mohamed around the start of October, but after enquiries, the local police were adamant that she was not there. Additionally, the Moroccan Interior Minister Chakib Benmoussa said on 4 November that there was no evidence to suggest that Madeleine was in Morocco. Elsewhere There were two reported sightings in Belgium. The first was during May 2007 in Li√®ge and the second occurred on 28 July on a caf√© terrace in Tongeren. In the latter case, children's therapist Katleen Sampermans said that Madeleine was in the company of a Dutch man and an English woman.; However, the girl turned out to be the 4-year-old daughter of a Belgian man.https://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/08/08/madeleine.dna/index.html Security was tightened in Valletta, Malta, on 21 June 2007 following five reported sightings on the island. The total sightings had risen to 29 by 27 June. In New Zealand, CCTV video from a department store in southern Dunedin showed a girl who looked like Madeleine being led into the store by a man at around 9:00pm on 5 December 2007, seven months after her disappearance. Dutch student Melissa Fiering claimed that she saw Madeleine with a 'tall, swarthy man', at the L'Arche motorway service station restaurant in the south of France, on 15 February 2008. However, the French police, after examining CCTV evidence, determined that the sighting was not of the missing child. The first reported sighting in Britain occurred in Dorset in February 2008. Retired civil servant Alan Cameron said that she was with a Portuguese couple who came to the door. A sighting of Madeline McCann was reported in the Sydney central business district on 17 March 2008. The reported sighting, of a middle-aged man carrying a blonde girl, turned out to be a false alarm. There have been six reported sightings in Brazil. A witness reported seeing Madeleine on a plane flying to S√£o Paulo, in late March 2008. Five earlier reports had been investigated and discounted. The release of the Portuguese police case files in August 2008 revealed a possible sighting in Amsterdam, Netherlands, in early May 2007. Anna Stam reported to Dutch police that a girl of three or four years of age, who resembled Madeleine, had come into her shop and had told her that the adult she was with was \\"a stranger\\" who \\"took me from my mummy\\" while she was on holiday. She added that her name was \\"Maddy\\". The McCanns' spokesman Clarence Mitchell said that it was a \\"disgrace\\" that they had not been told by police about the reported sighting at the time. The files included a 14-volume annexe of reported sightings, of Madeleine, across the world. The Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet published, in October 2009, a photograph of a girl, seen in Sweden, who bore a great similarity to Madeleine. The photographer claimed that the girl only spoke English, and was accompanied by a man who spoke Swedish. A sighting in Leh, India, was reported on 28 July 2011. British and American tourists reportedly saw a young girl with a French/Belgian couple, who claimed that the child was theirs. The chief of police in Leh, Vivek Gupta, denied the reports and stated that no DNA test had been undertaken by the police. New Zealand police were informed of a possible sighting in Queenstown, on 31 December 2012. The informant said that the girl she had seen had the same coloboma of the iris as Madeleine. After investigation, police identified the girl and stated that they were \\"absolutely satisfied\\" that the girl was not Madeleine. Disclosure of official information Leicestershire Police agreed, in the High Court on 7 July 2008, to disclose the content of files related to sightings and tip-offs. They handed over 81 pieces of information to Madeleine's parents.

While he was with the band, they had a #5 UK/#1 US hit single with \\"Make It With You\\". He was replaced by Larry Knechtel in 1971. In 1970, Royer and Jimmy Griffin, under the pseudonyms Robb Wilson and Arthur James, wrote the lyrics for \\"For All We Know,\\" featured in the film Lovers and Other Strangers. It won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Before co- founding Bread, Royer had been a member of the band The Pleasure Fair, whose only album in 1967 was produced and arranged by David Gates, Royer's future bandmate in Bread. Now living and working in Nashville, his songwriting credits include works for Jimmy Griffin, The Remingtons, Mary Chapin Carpenter, John Michael Montgomery, Randy Travis, Billy Burnette, The Finnigan Brothers (Mike Finnigan) and others. Musical career Early interests in music Robb Royer was exposed to recordings of classical music from early childhood and in Junior High school he pursued playing clarinet in the band. He attended and graduated from Sierra High School in Tollhouse, CA. While there he briefly participated in marching band but preferred to focus on the music rather than the marching. During his senior year he participated in concert band playing alto saxophone. Royer obtained his first guitar when he was a 19-year-old sophomore at San Fernando Valley State College (now California State University, Northridge). He met Tim Hallinan at the school. \\"Finally, when I began playing guitar, the scales tipped and Tim saw reason to talk to me. He liked to sing and I liked to play.\\" The two began to perform together as \\"Robb & Tim\\" and then later added the talent of Michele Cochrane. Hallinan recalled \\"What I remember best about Michele was, first, that she could actually sing. I was just faking it, doing what I‚Äôve done since I was born, an approach to life that begins with the words, 'Act like you can ‚Äì' In this case, it was sing. But Michele actually could; she had a glorious voice.\\" The Pleasure Fair Soon the trio became a quartet with the addition of Stephen Cohn, who had previously graduated from Valley State's music department, giving a senior recital in classical guitar. The group called themselves by various names, the most notable being \\"The Pleasure Fair\\" and by 1966 they managed to obtain a recording contract for a single with Hanna Barbera Records under the name \\"The Rainy Day People\\". \\"Junior Executive\\" was the \\"A\\" side, backed with \\"I'm Telling It To You\\" (both songs written by Cohn, Hallinan and Royer) A year later the group signed a recording contract with Uni Records in 1967 David Gates was hired as the arranger and conductor for the Pleasure Fair's self-titled album. Royer's song \\"Say What You See\\" (co- written with Tim Hallinan) would end up in 1968 being produced by Jimmy Griffin and arranged by David Gates. It was sung by a trio calling themselves \\"The Curtain Calls.\\" Soon afterward in the same year the three founding members of Bread (Royer, Griffin and Gates) would combine forces as their own group. Jimmy Griffin collaborations Robb Royer met Jimmy Griffin through a mutual friend, Maria Yolanda Aguayo, who would later become Griffin's wife. Initially Griffin asked Royer to help with writing horn parts for a music course that Griffin was taking. Soon Royer and Griffin were working together as staff songwriters for Viva Publishing. Jimmy Griffin had been hired by Viva first and was originally supposed to write with another Viva writer, but preferred working with Royer. Griffin soon forced the issue with Viva when he asked if they wanted only half of the publishing rights or all of the rights, resulting in Viva hiring Royer by 1967. Griffin earned $75 a week, Royer received $50 a week but those salaries were sufficient to pay the rent at that time (Royer's rent for his L.A. apartment was $80 a month in 1967). Royer and Griffin, using the pseudonyms Robb Wilson and Arthur James, wrote the lyrics for \\"For All We Know,\\" featured in the film Lovers and Other Strangers, which won the Academy Award for Best Song. The song has charted three times: The Carpenters (1971) reached number one on the Adult Contemporary charts (#3 in the Billboard Hot 100); Shirley Bassey (1971) reached number six on the UK charts; Nicki French (1995) reached number 42 on the UK charts. Royer and Griffin would continue to write and collaborate on various projects until Griffin's death in 2005. =Bread= Robb Royer and Jimmy Griffin co-founded Bread with David Gates in 1968. Maria Yolanda Aguayo once again contributed to the band's history when she revealed a trend she noticed as (Record Producer) Gary Usher‚Äôs desk girl at CBS Records ‚Äì band managers generally waited in the lobby but attorneys generally had immediate access to the executives at CBS. The trio quickly hired Al Schlesinger to represent them and he pitched their group to three labels in their search of a recording contract: Elektra Records, The Beatles' Apple Records and Atlantic Records, but Apple did not have clear leadership and was quickly eliminated from the process while Atlantic had recently signed two supergroups ‚Äì Crosby Stills & Nash and Led Zeppelin ‚Äì and they were based on the East Coast. Elektra was the label for The Doors, but were becoming embroiled in Jim Morrison‚Äôs legal battles. When both Atlantic and Elektra offered recording deals to Bread, the group chose the Elektra deal because they had a local headquarters in Los Angeles and the group felt Elektra would more actively promote them, given Atlantic‚Äôs other recent signings. The first album made use of Jimmy Gordon‚Äôs drumming and Gordon also performed drums with the group during their initial gigs, but due to Gordon‚Äôs high demand among multiple recording artists and his participation with the artists that eventually became Derek and the Dominos, he was replaced with Mike Botts as the group‚Äôs regular drummer, thus expanding the band to a quartet. After three years, Robb Royer and David Gates came to a breaking point because Gates wanted more control of the group, so Royer left the group in 1971 after its third album Manna and was replaced with famous session keyboardist/bassist/guitarist Larry Knechtel, who had previously contributed the piano performance on Simon and Garfunkel‚Äôs ‚ÄúBridge Over Troubled Water‚Äù. Royer continued to write with Griffin and Bread continued to record Royer/Griffin collaborations. =Griffin and Knechtel= Bread disbanded in 1973 and Jimmy, Larry and Robb ended up working together, releasing one album with Polydor records in 1973 under the name ‚ÄúJames Griffin & Co.‚Äù although none of the songs charted. The trio began work on a second album but it was completed by other producers and released in Europe. =Toast/Radio Dixie= In 1982 Royer wrote the song ‚ÄúQuittin‚Äô Time‚Äù (co-written with Roger Linn) which eight years later was recorded by Mary Chapin Carpenter and won an ASCAP Airplay award. Royer traveled to Nashville to receive the award and stayed with Griffin, who had previously relocated from L.A. to Nashville. Larry Knechtel had also been living and working as a session musician in Nashville. Royer relocated to Nashville in 1994. Todd Cerney was already a grammy- nominated songwriter when Royer met him in 1994 at Jim Della Croce's house. Cerney had written two top-forty songs (Loverboy‚Äôs ‚ÄúNotorious‚Äù and Restless Heart‚Äôs ‚ÄúI'll Still Be Loving You,‚Äù which reached number one on the Country charts). Cerney had established a private recording studio in his home where he engineered a number of other singer-songwriters‚Äô albums. Griffin, Royer and Cerney first collaborated by co-writing the song ‚ÄúKyrie‚Äù in 1994. Knechtel later joined the trio and together they performed and co-wrote songs (including the 1995 song ‚ÄúSlow Train‚Äù) under the band name ‚ÄúToast‚Äù. Toast performed at various Nashville venues including the Bluebird, Third and Lindsley, and 12th & Porter. They wrote and performed their own songs including such titles as ‚ÄúRoad Kill,‚Äù ‚ÄúKnechtelodeon,‚Äù ‚ÄùNo More Smokin‚Äô,‚Äù ‚ÄúGrenadine,‚Äù ‚ÄúMagdelena,‚Äù and ‚ÄúRadio Dixie.‚Äù The group used session drummers for their recordings and performances. The group would later be known as Radio Dixie in 1998. The name change was intended to help with promotion of the group, but the group disbanded by the end of 1998. Royer and Cerney continued to write together, generating additional titles including ‚ÄùHurtin‚Äô Cowboy,‚Äù ‚ÄùNew Orleans Prayer,‚Äù ‚ÄúI Believe I Kissed an Angel,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBeside Myself.‚Äù =Cosmo and Robetta= Robb Royer, fulfilling a deathbed wish from Jimmy Griffin, completed in 2010 a project begun by the two in 1973 after Bread's first breakup. A mix of rock opera and radio \\"Theater of the Mind,\\" the project is a dramatic narration completed with sound effects and music which tells the story of Cosmo, an electronics whiz who is the sole human employee of Savage motors. In his spare time he has built Robetta, a robot who later becomes nearly human in appearance and abilities. The project was an expansion of an earlier work, \\"The Plastic Sibling\\", co-written by Robb alongside a number of college friends, including Tim Hallinan. Additional songwriting Royer collaborated with Richard Fagan to write \\"Sold (The Grundy County Auction Incident)\\" which was recorded by John Michael Montgomery and became a number one Billboard Country chart hit in 1995.

During these years, twenty-seven numbers and some special numbers were published, and the average edition was five hundred copies. Some of their subscribers were prominent figures as the important intellectual Ramon Pi√±eiro, the historian Ram√≥n Villares, the politician Manuel Fraga Iribarne, the player of the Deportivo da Coru√±a Vicente Celeiro or the Cardinal Antonio Maria Rouco Varela. In 2007 the Rey Juan Carlos University, of Madrid, and the Institute of Estudos Chairegos, of Vilalba, edited, with the sponsorship of the Consellar√≠a de Innovaci√≥n e Industria and the Sociedade de Xesti√≥n do Xacobeo, the complete facsimile edition of the newspaper. The volume, with a preface by Ram√≥n Villares, Chairman of the Consello da Culture Galega (Galician Culture Council), and presented by the teacher and chairman of the Iescha, Jose Luis Novo Caz√≥n, contains a wide introductory study done by the teacher Felipe R. Debasa Navalpotro, of the URJC, the philosopher Ant√≥n Baamonde, the provincial deputy Xos√© Gonz√°lez Barcia and the former editors of the publication, Moncho Paz, Paulo Naseiro and Mario Paz Gonz√°lez.  History  The date of its founding (29 June 1983) almost coincided with the approval in Parliament of Galicia of the Law on Language Normalisation, which was enacted two weeks before, on 15 June. This information is not coincidental if we think that from the very moment of its appearance, A Voz de Vilalba would become a symbol, among others, of how the use of a language can be extended to all areas of life, and not only confined, because of the diglossia, to a plot exclusively linked to the traditional life. To this consolidation of the publication as a small landmark in the task of building a cultural environment suitable and an own identity, necessary for the community in those years of political transition, was a help, no doubt, the Exposition of World Press which was organized by the three founders in collaboration with Xos√© S√°nchez Dom√≠nguez, from A Coru√±a, in the summer of 1985 and which reached an enormous impact, and was echoed by the media in Galicia. The three founders of the newspaper (Moncho Paz, Paulo Naseiro and Mario Paz Gonz√°lez) were in 1983 only eleven and twelve years old. This unusual precocity makes them, in the words of the professor at the Rey Juan Carlos University, of Madrid, Felipe R. Debasa, \\"probably the youngest editors in the Spanish National Library\\". In 2008, twenty-five years after the birth of the newspaper, his spirit was recovered through new technologies in a website (www.avozdevilalba.com) in which they want to maintain the eagerness to inform and the defense freedom of expression that always characterized the publication.

Dummy tanks emerged soon after the introduction of real tanks in World War I, but were not widely used until World War II. __TOC__ World War I During World War I, Allied forces made use of dummy versions of the British heavy tanks. These were constructed from a wooden framework and covered with painted Hessian cloth. The tracks were non-functional so some were fitted with concealed wheels underneath and were towed from place to place by a pair of horses. Dummy tanks, representing Allied models, were also found to have been constructed by the Germans, even though they deployed only a small number of real tanks. It is possible they were used in training, rather than for military deception. World War II Dummy tanks, mounted on trucks, going to the forward areas in the Western Desert, 13 February 1942 Dummy tanks saw significantly more use during World War II by both the Allies and the Axis. German forces utilized mock tanks prior to the start of the war for practice and training exercises. Their use in military deception was pioneered by British forces, who termed them \\"spoofs.\\" One of the first uses of dummy tanks during the Second World War was in the North African Campaign. The Royal Engineers stationed there constructed two per day; between April and June 1941, they were able to build three dummy Royal Tank Regiments, and another in November that same year. These were foldable, and thus portable; and the Royal Engineers improved them further. Jeeps were used to make the \\"spoofs\\" more mobile: a steel frame covered with canvas was placed on them, making a self-propelled dummy tank. The Jeep did not realistically simulate the noise or movement of a tank, but allowed the dummy to be deployed quickly. Meanwhile, the reverse was also done, to make tanks look like trucks. A further device was put into use that both created simulated tank tracks and erased real ones. An inflatable dummy tank, modeled after the M4 Sherman Inflatable dummies consisted of a fabric covering supported by a network of pressurized rubber tubes that formed a kind of \\"pneumatic skeleton\\". These were generally preferred in the field, despite their tendency to rapidly deflate if punctured by accident or shellfire. In one operation in September 1944, the British deployed 148 inflatable tanks close to the front line and around half were \\"destroyed\\" by fragments from German mortar and artillery fire, and by Allied bombs falling short. Dummy tanks were used in Operation Fortitude prior to the landings at the Normandy Beaches. During this operation, they were used to confuse German intelligence in two ways: first, by making it seem that the Allies had more tanks than they did; and second, to hide and downplay the importance of the location of their real tanks in order to make it seem that the invasion would occur at the Pas-de-Calais rather than at Normandy. However, dummy vehicles played only a small part of the overall deception plan as, at that stage of the war, the Germans were unable to fly reconnaissance planes over England and such effort would have been wasted. Dummy landing craft were stationed at ports in eastern and southeastern England where they might be observed by the Germans but the Fortitude deception was largely carried out using double agents and false radio traffic. A dummy Sherman tank under construction by 6 Field Park Company, Royal Engineers, in the Anzio bridgehead, 29 April 1944. During Operation Shingle at Anzio, Italy, inflatable Sherman tanks were deployed when the real tanks were elsewhere. In the Pacific Theater of Operations, the Japanese also utilized decoys; one recorded instance was during the Battle of Iwo Jima. A \\"tank\\" was surrounded by American infantry, which had been under artillery bombardment: they found it was not real, but merely a sculpture carved out of volcanic ash. The Red Army employed dummy tanks to increase their apparent numbers and mask their true movements. Modern era Inflatable mock-up of a T-72 tank During the Kosovo War, the Yugoslav Army regularly placed dummy tanks in Kosovo which misled NATO forces into thinking that they were destroying far more real tanks than actually occurred.BBC On The Record - Broadcast: 28.10.01 The United States Army has developed a modern dummy tank. It imitates the M1 Abrams tank not only in appearance, but also in its heat signature, in order to appear real to infrared detectors. One of these decoys can take fire from the enemy and still appear to be operational, thus delaying the enemy by as much as an hour, as they are forced to destroy the decoy. These M1 decoys cost only $3,300, compared to $4.35 million for a real M1. The decoy is also practical: when disassembled, it weighs only fifty pounds, and is roughly the same size as a duffel bag. Its generator--about the size of a 12 inch television-- facilitates inflation, so that two people can erect the decoy in a few minutes. Occasionally, real tanks carry a dummy on board, to deploy when needed.Dunnigan, p. 21.

This hymn is chanted at the end of the Second Antiphon during the Divine Liturgies of St John Chrysostom, St Basil the Great and of St Gregory the Illuminator (Armenian Divine Liturgy) . Attribution This hymn is sometimes ascribed to Pope Athanasius I of Alexandria. It was written after the First Ecumenical Council at Nicea as an affirmation of the Christological Formula set down by Athanasius. It was first used in the Church of Alexandria but was distributed by Athanasius to all the churches of the world. It is still currently used as a mournful hymn during the service of Great Friday in the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, with its length exceeding 10 minutes due to its long and deep melismatic nature. It is also chanted in the introductory portion of the Divine Liturgy of the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which observe the Byzantine Rite. The hymn is a theological statement of faith in the dogma of the Incarnation. There is also a tradition that Emperor Justinian is the person responsible for the hymn's spread and popularity. During the controversy caused by the Origenists, Emperor Justinian declared that this hymn should be sung in all Christian Churches. Due to this tradition, the hymn is sometimes referred to as \\"Justinian's Hymn\\".

Variant text as > sung in some Eastern Churches in the United States. Theology The key word, Monogenƒìs, is drawn from the Gospel of John , , and 3:16. The first of these verses describes the pre-incarnate Logos as being \\"only-begotten of the Father\\"; the second speaks of Jesus' earthly ministry; and the third describes the offering of the Incarnate Christ for the salvation of those who believe.

Grand Admiral Erich Raeder's orders to the task force commander, Admiral G√ºnther L√ºtjens, the Chief of Fleet aboard the Bismarck, were that \\"the objective of the Bismarck is not to defeat enemies of equal strength, but to tie them down in a delaying action, while preserving combat capacity as much as possible, so as to allow Prinz Eugen to get at the merchant ships in the convoy\\" and \\"The primary target in this operation is the enemy's merchant shipping; enemy warships will be engaged only when that objective makes it necessary and it can be done without excessive risk.\\"Boyne 1997, pp. 53‚Äì54. Events At 02:00 on 19 May 1941, Bismarck and Prinz Eugen left Gotenhafen and proceeded through the Baltic Sea and out towards the Atlantic. Unknown to L√ºtjens, the British had intercepted enough signals to infer that a German naval operation might occur in the area. The German task force was first encountered by the Swedish seaplane-cruiser on 20 May heading north-west, past G√∂teborg. The British Admiralty was informed through a Norwegian officer in Stockholm who had learned of the sighting from a Swedish military intelligence source. Alerted by this report, British Admiralty requested air reconnaissance of the Norwegian coast. A Spitfire reconnaissance aircraft found and photographed the German task force in the Grimstad fjord (), near Bergen, at 13:15 on 21 May. On the evening of 23 May at 19:22, the German force was detected by the heavy cruisers and that had been patrolling the Denmark Strait in the expectation of a German breakout. Bismarck fired five salvos without scoring a direct hit. The heavily outgunned British cruisers retired to a safe distance and shadowed the enemy until their own heavy units could draw closer. However, Bismarcks forward radar had failed as a result of vibration from the heavy guns firing during this skirmish, and L√ºtjens was obliged to order Prinz Eugen to move ahead of Bismarck in order to provide the squadron with forward radar coverage.Boyne 1997, pp. 56‚Äì58. =Battle= The hydrophones on Prinz Eugen detected a foreign ship to port at 05:00. The Germans sighted the smokestacks of two ships at 05:45. The British ships started firing at the German task force at 05:53. Vice-Admiral Lancelot Holland planned on targeting Bismarck first, but due to the reversed battle order, and opened fire on the Prinz Eugen instead. The commander of the Prince of Wales, Captain John Leach, detected this error and ordered his guns swung around to fire on Bismarck. The German task force was still waiting for the order to commence firing, which Admiral L√ºtjens did not give immediately. Two minutes into the battle Bismarck and Prinz Eugen started firing at Hood. At 05:57 Hood was hit by Prinz Eugen, igniting reserve ammunition stored on deck, and starting a fire. The fifth salvo by Bismarck, fired at a range of about at 06:01, was seen to hit Hood abreast her mainmast. It is likely that one shell struck somewhere between Hood's mainmast and 'X' turret aft of the mast. A huge jet of flame burst out from Hood from the vicinity of the mainmast. This was followed by a devastating magazine explosion that destroyed the aft part of the ship. This explosion broke the back of Hood, and she sank in only three minutes, her nearly vertical bow last to descend into the water.Boyne 1997, pp. 59‚Äì60. Afterwards Following the explosion, Prince of Wales was targeted by both German ships and disengaged from combat after seven direct hits, four by Bismarck and three by Prinz Eugen, at about 06:09. In the afternoon of 24 May, Admiral L√ºtjens, ordered Prinz Eugen to break away from the battleship Bismarck and operate independently against the enemy's merchant shipping. Prinz Eugen and Bismarck separated at 18:14 that evening. Bismarck was sunk by the concentrated effort of the Royal Navy on 27 May 1941 while Prinz Eugen arrived safely at Brest, France on 1 June 1941.Boyne 1997, pp. 61‚Äì63.

Leary‚Äôs Book Store was a landmark in downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for nearly one hundred years. In 1969, when it closed, it was known as the ‚Äúoldest book store in the United States.‚Äù Business Leary‚Äôs Book Store was in the business of buying and selling used books. It purchased large collections of books from private libraries and offered them individually for sale. It claimed to have \\"twenty thousand square feet of books, representing nearly five hundred thousand volumes.\\" There is evidence Leary‚Äôs Book Store also published books, such as: *The Talmud: Selections from the Contents of that Ancient Book, Its Commentaries, Teachings, Poetry, and Legends. Also, Brief Sketches of the Men who made and commented upon it. Translated from the Original By H. Polano, Philadelphia: Leary's Book Store, 1876. *Leary's Ready Reckoner: Form Book & Wages Calculator. Philadelphia: Leary, Stuart & Co., 1904. Location Leary‚Äôs Book Store was located in the heart of the downtown district of Philadelphia at 9 South 9th Street, a short distance from Market Street. The very large Gimbel‚Äôs Department Store occupied the corner of 9th and Market, and the relatively tiny Leary‚Äôs Book Store on 9th Street was separated from it by a small cobble stoned alleyway. Leary‚Äôs Book Store was contained in a large three-story building with basement and sloped roof. The building consisted of three floors and a basement full of books. On the third floor, an opening in the floor allowed a view of the mezzanine down below. Additional books were placed outside on shelves on the Leary‚Äôs side of the alleyway separating it from Gimbels. Some provision was made to shelter the books and the readers in the alley way, but, most of the time, the books and browsers, suffered the inclemency of the outdoor Philadelphia weather. Throughout the building, numerous used books were everywhere: on wall shelves and piled high on tables for readers to browse through. The policy of the bookstore was not to interfere with readers and browsers, but simply to direct customers to their areas of interest if asked. History In 1836, William A. Leary established a sidewalk book stall on North Second Street in Philadelphia, in close proximity to the Old Market, eventually acquiring a location at No. 138. After the death of Leary, the business was acquired in 1876 by Edwin S. Stuart and Charles Mann and eventually renamed Leary, Stuart, and Co. Stuart moved the business to 9 South Ninth Street in September 1877 to benefit from the relocation of the city government. Leary‚Äôs heyday was during the Golden Age of Books, a period during the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century when books were the key source of entertainment and enlightenment. After World War II consumers for books moved to suburbia where competing book stores and distance to Leary‚Äôs resulted in a declining demand for Leary‚Äôs used books. The bookstore closed on 20 November 1968 because the shift of population to the suburbs diminished its customer base. During the final cataloging of its remaining book stock for sale at the Freeman auction house, a number of ancient documents, reported to have languished in the stock for 100 years or more, were found among its contents, including an original broadside of the Declaration of Independence dated to 1776. This proved to be a John Dunlap first printing and it sold for over $400,000 at auction. The buyers, two wealthy Texas businessmen, donated it to the city of Dallas, Texas; it is now on permanent display at the Dallas Public Library. Leary‚Äôs Book Store and the adjoining Gimbels department store, originally acquired by Gimbels in 1894, were demolished by the late 1970s. Various redevelopment proposals for the site have failed and the ground has been used mostly as a parking lot. A famous trademark, of sorts The Carl Spitzweg image strongly associated with Leary‚Äôs Book Store. Leary‚Äôs Book Store tied its advertising to The Bookworm, an 1850 painting by the German painter and poet Carl Spitzweg. The owners had the picture repainted on the outside of the store for the Centennial Exhibition to attract visitors. A cropped portion of this painting, showing the bookworm on a ladder, was used in Leary‚Äôs advertising and commercial signage. Customers and visitors were routinely given bookmarks containing this image as well as informative posters related to the bookstore and its history.

History The Network was founded in February 2001 at the Second National Organizing Conference on Iraq, held in Denver, Colorado and hosted by the Colorado Campaign for Middle East Peace. The first National Organizing Conference on Iraq had been held in October 1999 at Ann Arbor, Michigan, where proposals for the formation of the Network had produced ambiguous results. Subsequent national organizing conferences on Iraq were held in 2002 (Palo Alto, California), 2003 (College Park, Maryland) and 2004 (Bloomington, Indiana). After the 2003 conference, held during the US invasion of Iraq, the Network's name was officially changed to the National Grassroots Peace Network (NGPN), but the new name never gained much currency. During its three and a half year history, the Network grew from around 70 to over 350 member organizations in 48 states. During each year of its existence, the Network co- ordinated nationwide protests, vigils and other actions conducted locally by member groups. The Network supported the global day of protest against the impending invasion of Iraq on February 15, 2003, the largest protest action in history. On February 15, 2004, the Network independently organized a Vigil for Peace in 120 cities in a dozen countries. Mission: Opposition to Sanctions The primary cause that brought Network members together was the humanitarian crisis in Iraq resulting from the trade embargo imposed through the United Nations at the urging of the United States and the United Kingdom. Network members were appalled at studies by UNICEF and other UN agencies that showed that the combined effects of the 1991 bombing campaign and sanctions had led to as many as 1.5 million additional Iraqi deaths by 1995, including more than 500,000 children. Organizing Philosophy Tensions between local member groups and existing national organizations existed within the Network throughout its existence. The Network represents one in a long line of efforts to build a grassroots, \\"bottom-up\\" structure of organization to operate within the peace movement. This left the Network with a weak center. While the emergence of half a dozen or more national coalitions opposing the US invasion and occupation of Iraq from late 2002 may have made the Network's continuation impossible, the Network's collapse in late 2004 was primarily due to the inability of member groups to agree on a fundraising strategy to sustain the national office, or whether to pursue incorporation.

History The pools, which consist of Grove Pool, Middle Pool and Fens Pool, were originally constructed by the Stourbridge Canal Company. The canal was opened in 1779,Jim Shead's Waterways History: Stourbridge Canal and the lake reservoirs fed into a navigable branch which joined the canal's main line at Leys Junction, close to the top of the Stourbridge Flight of 16 locks, through which the level of the canal falls by 145 feet (44.2m).Nicholson Waterways Guide, Volume 2 (2006), Harper Collins Publishing Ltd, The reservoirs formed the main source of water supply for these locks, until it was supplemented by water leaving the Dudley Canal, with which the Stourbridge Canal made an end- on junction in 1792. Location The area is situated between Pensnett and Brierley Hill in the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. It forms part of the larger Buckpool and Fens Pool Local Nature Reserve. Wildlife The site includes open water, swamps, fens and flood vegetation, unimproved grassland and scrub. It is the best place in the West Midlands for amphibians, with the common frog, common toad, smooth newt and great crested newt breeding here, this site having the largest population of great crested newts in the West Midlands. As well as a variety of grasses and sedges, there are mare‚Äôs-tail, common club-rush, orange foxtail and lesser water-parsnip. Some unimproved natural grassland shows signs of ancient ridge and furrow cultivation and supports the rare adder‚Äôs-tongue fern. At least ten species of dragonfly have been observed here, and over twenty species of butterfly. Birds that breed here include the reed warbler, the sedge warbler, the lesser whitethroat and the great crested grebe, and sometimes the little ringed plover. The pools provide a large expanse of open water, and form an important habitat for over- wintering and migrating birds. Shovelers and gadwalls can regularly be seen, while bitterns have also been observed.Dudley MB Council Parks and Nature Reserves See also *List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in the West Midlands References Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1989 Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in the West Midlands (county) Category:Canal reservoirs in England ","title":"Fens Pools"},{"id":"17624176","text":"The Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) are all the current codified laws of the State of Nevada.

(Previously Lezgin was written in Arabic script.) \\"The New World\\" was the first Lezgin-language publication using its own alphabet. The newspaper changed names several times.

In 1951, the Soviet Union required all non-Russian newspapers to rely on the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's newspaper, Pravda, for their content. The Lezgi newspaper was renamed Dagestani Truth (–î–∞–≥—ä—É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–¥–∏–Ω –≥—å–∞–∫—ä–∏–∫—ä–∞—Ç), and almost all of its content consisted of translated articles published in the Russian-language Dagestani Truth (–î–∞–≥–µ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–∞). Agariza Saidov, editor of the Lezgi Gazet since 1994, said, \\"This decision was ill-conceived and erroneous, since it hindered the development of the culture, language and literature in native languages.\\" In 1957, the Communist Party reversed its decision and the newspaper resumed publication of its own content under the name, Kommunist (–ö–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∏—Å—Ç).

According to Jean Abou Rached, the chairman of As-Salam company and the real estate developer behind the project, Sannine Zenith would cost $1.4 billion. The environment will be the main theme behind Sannine Zenith, since 70 percent of the land will be completely free of construction and some one million trees will be planted. The project as planned includes three separate villages: the International Sports Village, the Eco Farm Village and the Lake View Village; each will be architecturally distinctive from the others. Project Located within a mountain range, Sannine Zenith Lebanon is a four-season resort destination in the Middle East. The community harbors a variety of family and sports activities geared for all seasons. By using both natural and man-made snow the project produces the largest and skiing facilities, encompassing 59 skiing slopes levelled towards professionals as well as leisure skiers, but also a ski resort with stunning scenery. The mountain peaks vary between the summits; ranging in altitude between 2,000 meters and 2,600 meters and will contain a high altitude golf course. Location Mount Sannine is geographically placed in the centre of Lebanon. The site of Sannine Zenith Lebanon covers approximately 50 million square meters of the Western and Eastern peaks and plateaus of Mount Sannine. The site spreads over a variety of altitudes that range between 1,400 meters to 2,600 meters above sea level. Development Vineyards near Zahl√©, in the central Beqaa Valley where the project ends The Master Plan brings forth a study of both environment and water management, a detailed study of ski slopes with an area requirement study, and a pair of golf courses and area requirement study. A market study and a feasibility study have been concluded while additional market studies are continuously conducted to update data and follow market trends in real estate as they emerge. A sizeable portion of the land will be treated as a natural reserve zone for reforestation and will be equipped with various outdoor activities such as hiking, trekking, mountain climbing, camping, activities for scouts, cycling and many other activities. The Central Hub Geographically located in the centre of the site, this area is planned as the project‚Äôs prime public attraction, and a destination for non-residents. Housing a series of small hotels, commercial facilities, restaurants, nightclubs, bars, and movie theatres. The central hub will assure parking facilities within touching distance of the main ski lifts. The Villages Several villages will be developed each with a particular and distinctive character; in contrast, with the main node these villages will ensure more privacy, a higher degree of exclusivity and seclusion to the residents. All villages will contain a center affording common activities. Infrastructure Right from the very onset of the project the infrastructure studies conducted were aimed at ensuring that infrastructure items could be constructed, as well as developing a budget for feasibility studies. In addition, the project is equipped with one central heliport located within the Mountain Village vicinity and is designed to maintain comfort and practicality for project users. Equipment Sannine Zenith Lebanon will be equipped with a snow clearing station and snowplows. This is in line with other ski resorts in the area and where procedures laid down by the Ministry of Public Works for the clearance of snow from public roads and private resort roads in winter are carried out in full accordance. The Sannine project reaches to Lebanon's capital, Beirut Skiing Slopes The Northern part of the site equipped with the most appropriate skiing slopes, will be completely dedicated to skiing activities and preserved as virgin land. Offering a variety of skiing activities the ski slopes will extend their pleasures with slopes ranging from those for beginners to those for advanced skiing, for cross-country skiing and for snowboarding and from elevations ranging from 2,000 meters of altitude to 2,500 meters of altitude. A technical study was conducted to test the viability of the ski slopes and to assess the technical feasibility of skiing on the site. These studies also revealed that the length and slope variety of Sannine Zenith Lebanon are comparable to international ski resorts worldwide.

The assignment of income doctrine seeks to \\"preserve the progressive rate structure of the Code by prohibiting the splitting of income among taxable entities.\\"David Mattingly, Empty Forms: Applying the Assignment of Income Doctrine to Contingent Liability Tax Shelters, 94 Georgetown Law Journal 1993, 2015. History The United States Supreme Court created the assignment of income doctrine in the Lucas v. Earl decision. . The Supreme Court held that income from services is taxed to the party who performed the services.Lucas v. Earl, 281 U.S. at 115. To elaborate on this principle, the decision used the metaphor that \\"the fruits cannot be attributed to a different tree from that on which they grew.\\" The case is used to support the proposition that the substance of the transaction, rather than the form, is controlling for tax purposes.See IRS article. The doctrine was later expanded in the Helvering v. Horst decision to include income from property.. The decision relied on the principle that the power to dispose of income and the enjoyment of property's economic benefits is the equivalent of ownership. Impact This doctrine has important implications for taxpayers trying to shift their tax burden to another person. When assigning income to another person (particularly a family member) in the form of a gift, the courts will usually see it as a way to avoid tax and thus consider it ‚Äúfruit.‚Äù Only in an arms-length sale do the courts see the ‚Äútree‚Äù itself being moved.Donaldson, Samuel A., Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials 155 (2d ed. 2007).

One of the major benefits of this type of advertising is that advertisers can take advantage of the users' demographic information and target their ads appropriately. Social media targeting combines current targeting options (such as geotargeting, behavioral targeting, socio- psychographic targeting, etc.), to make detailed target group identification possible. With social media targeting, advertisements are distributed to users based on information gathered from target group profiles. Social network advertising is not necessarily the same as social media targeting. Social media targeting is a method of optimizing social media advertising by using profile data to deliver advertisements directly to individual users. Social network advertising refers to the process of matching social network users to target groups that have been specified by the advertiser.  Application  People who use social networking sites get their various information about themselves, including their age, gender, interests, and location stored on the servers of the social media companies. This stored information allows advertisers to create specific target groups and individualize their advertisements. The advantage for advertisers is that their ads can reach to a specific set of audience who are interested in the product or service. The advantage for users is that they can see ads that are relevant to their interest.  Facebook  Facebook, the most popular social network, has developed a targeting technology which allows advertisements to reach a specific audience. This is within the Facebook product called Facebook Ads, which is available to users and businesses alike. While posting an ad through the Facebook Ad Manager, an advertiser is provided a set of characteristics that will define his target market. Facebook calls this audience targeting. These traits include geographical location, gender, age, work, relationship status, and interests such as music, among others. Facebook claims that advertisers can even customize their target audience based on their behavior such as purchasing patterns, device usage, and other activities. This is why Facebook users see advertisements on their profile page that are relevant to their preferences and interests. This allows the ads to be less intrusive and more successful in delivering the appropriate content to the right audience. The advertisement algorithm is also capable of monitoring performance so that advertisers or Facebook marketers are able to modify their audience as well as the nature, budget, and duration of the ads based on its performance.  Instagram  Instagram is a social media app that is created as an outlet to share photos with followers. While it is mainly used for friends and family and sometimes a broad following if you are an influencer, smaller companies use their platform to also advertise to the public as well as using influencers to promote certain products. Social media programs, such as Instagram, uses digital engagement to allow companies to advertise different products. The programs evaluate how a consumer engages with the content based on the amount of likes, amount of follows, and certain interests based on preference of the user. The program (Instagram) takes the information gathered about the consumer and creates an environment for the advertisement. Since Instagram is mainly used by ages 18-24 and on average is used by each person around 72 minutes a day the way advertisements are presented is key because if they are not effective they will be disregarded and the advertisement would not be effective.  Snapchat  Snapchat is a multimedia messaging app developed by Snap Inc., originally Snapchat Inc. One of the principal features of Snapchat is that pictures and messages are usually only available for a short time before they become inaccessible to their recipients. Facebook is the most popular social advertising platforms by far, but an increasing number of young people use Snapchat. Pew Research Center data show that 78% percent of young Americans (18-24 years old) use Snapchat (the number goes down to 54% in the 25 to 29 years old group).  Twitter  Twitter is a social networking service where individuals post \\"tweets\\" about anything. Twitter first known as Twtter was found July 15, 2006. As of May 28, 2020 a source called Hootsuite states, \\"More than 80% of Twitter's global population is under 50 years old.\\", Twitter is an app that is mainly used by teenagers. Advertising on Twitter is based solely on interacts an individual makes on the app. Advertisements that are shown on an individual's twitter feed is based on the information provided from that individuals profile. Advertisements that are shown on twitter are classified under three names: Promoted Tweets, Promoted Accounts, and Promoted Trends. Certain advertisements that are placed on an individual's feed can be based on what is popular around the world, or even local to that individual's location, if location services are on.  Operation  Within social communities users provide demographic information, interests, and images. This information is accessed by social media targeting software and enables advertisers to create display ads with characteristics that match those of social network users. The important component of social media targeting is the provision of the users' socio- demographic and interest information. By using this information, social media targeting makes it possible for users to see advertisements that might actually interest them. The availability of user data allows for detailed analysis and reporting, which is a big part of social media targeting and what makes it more effective than statistical projections alone.  Demographics  About three-quarters of Internet users are members of at least one social network. 49% of U.S. adult women visit social media sites a few times a day, whereas only 34% of men visit them. The fastest-growing age group on Twitter is 55- to 64-year-old, up 79% since 2012. And the 45-54 age group is the fastest-growing on Facebook and Google+. Social media use is still more common among the 89% of Internet users aged 18‚Äì29, versus 43% of those who are 65 and older.Pick  Types of advertising  Popular social media sites, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, offer different ways to advertise brands. Facebook gives advertisers options such as promoted posts, sponsored stories, page post ads, Facebook object (like) ads, and external website (standard) ads. To advertise on Twitter there are promoter tweets, trends, and promoted accounts that show up on users newsfeed. For advertising on YouTube there are branded channels, promoted videos, an in video advertising.Goyal 2013, p. 222. In July 2015, during their Q2 earnings call, Facebook revealed that it has achieved $2.9B in mobile revenue, amounting to over 76% of its overall quarterly revenue. A large portion of this revenue was from app install ads, of which developers buy on a Cost per Install basis. Another type of advertising is using a tool called \\"buy buttons\\". Some networks are already getting involved with \\"buy buttons', or being direct marketers for various products a business wishes to promote on their social media platform. Social networks like Facebook and Twitter are already involved with such partnerships, and this is still just the beginning. The \\"buy button\\" is the gateway to impulsive online shopping. These advertisements pop up in the news feed of social media interfaces and also give you the option to click a button and purchase the item right then and there. These account for just under 2% of online sales. The \\"buy button\\", which can be traced back to the system being patented by Amazon in 1997, plays not only a circumstantial part in internet sales but internet life. Even though the realm of social media advertising can be used for sales, it can be for more than just that. For example, social media played a significant role in the 2008 presidential race. Videos that involved both Obama and McCain were able to garner 1.45 billion views. Some of those views and videos could have wavered one's voting decision. Social media advertising also plays a huge role in a brand's or company's reputation and reception. The way a company presents itself can determine its popularity and audience. This tactic is even proven in some studies to be played out on a global scale.

They were named for historic regions and kingdoms of Spain.  Description  Construction of the Aragon-class cruisers as armored corvettes with a central battery ironclad design began in 1869, with plans to give them 890 tons of armor and of armor at the waterline. In 1870, their design was changed to that of an unprotected cruiser or wooden corvette; political events delayed their construction, but they finally were launched in this form in the years between 1879 and 1881 and completed in 1880 and 1882.The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Centennial Website: Spanish Wooden Cruisers; The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Centennial Website: Castilla Their original conception as armored ships and the change to an unarmored one during construction left them with an overly heavy wooden hull that was obsolescent by the time they were launched.Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860‚Äì1905, p. 383 The ships had two funnels and were rigged as barques. The lead unit's machinery was manufactured by the John Penn Company in the United Kingdom, while her sisters' was manufactured at the naval shipyard at Ferrol following John Penn's pattern. The original main battery of Armstrong-built guns was obsolescent when the ships were completed, and were quickly replaced with more modern guns mounted in sponsons, with Aragon more heavily armed than her sisters. Designed for colonial service, they were never intended to fight the kind of heavily armed, armored, steel-hulled warships Castilla would face in the Battle of Manila Bay.The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Centennial Website: Castilla  History  Much of the operational history of the Aragon-class cruisers is obscure. Castilla served in home waters and then in the Philippines, where she was sunk, but it is known only that the other two were in home waters in the 1890s. Sources differ on whether Aragon and Navarra were hulked and then scrapped in the 1890s or survived into the early 20th century in non-combat roles.See The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Centennial Website: Spanish Wooden Cruisers and Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860‚Äì1905, p. 383, for differing information on the fates of Aragon and Navarra  Ships in class   Aragon  , the lead unit, was under construction for eleven years before commissioning in 1880.The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Centennial Website: Spanish Wooden Cruisers In home waters in the 1890s, she either was hulked in 1896 and sold for scrap in 1900 or survived until stricken around 1905.

In home waters in the 1890s, she either was hulked in 1896 and sold for scrap in 1899 or survived to become a cadet training ship in 1900.  Castilla  was under construction for thirteen years before commissioning in 1882.

Bernardi ad Scaldim, ordinis Cisterciensis, in dioecesi Antverpiensi also known as St. Bernard's Abbey on the Scheldt (Sint- Bernardusabdij van Hemiksem; Abdij Sint-Bernaerdts aan de Schelde), located in Hemiksem in the province of Antwerp in Belgium, was a Cistercian monastery founded in 1243 and dissolved during the French Revolution. The buildings are now the property of the municipality of Hemiksem. History The establishment of the abbey at Hemiksem, named after Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, was the result of the efforts of Duke Henry I of Brabant and after his death by his son, Duke Henry II, who saw the actual foundation of the abbey in 1243, which was confirmed by Pope Urban IV. The monastic community at Hemiksem, like all Roman Catholic clergy in the region, came under pressure in the late 16th century and in 1578, at the height of the iconoclastic movement (Beeldenstorm), the abbey stood entirely deserted for a time. From 1570 to 1649 the position of abbot was held ex officio by the bishops of Antwerp. In 1672 most of the buildings burnt down; the present buildings date from the late 17th and 18th centuries. The impressive western facade with tower of 42m high, was completed during the abatiat of Joannes van Heymissem. The ca 30 monks were chased out of their abbey in 1797, the community was suppressed. Their important grounds, estates and rights were abolished during the French Revolution and the church demolished. In 1836 the surviving members of the community bought the recently empty premises of Bornem Abbey and leaving Hemiksem for good, re-settled it as the still-extant Bornem Abbey. Premises after the French Revolution From 1811 the buildings were used as a naval hospital. In 1821, the Antwerp architect Pierre Bruno Bourla converted the abbey for use as a house of correction, with large dormitories, for the accommodation of over 1500 men, 450 women and a large number of children. The use of dormitories later fell out of favour, and from 1867, after conversion of the large open rooms into individual cells, the premises were reused as a military depot. Immediately after World War II the building was used as an internment facility for collaborators. From 1948 to 1977 it was again used by the military, and from 1977 stood empty. The building was legally protected from 1973 and was bought by the municipality in 1988. After the west and east wings were restored they now accommodate the administrative centre of the municipality of Hemiksem, local police headquarters and service flats; a local history museum and the Roelants Museum are located in the north wing. The distinctive silhouette of the principal range has become a symbol of the town.

Early voyages  The most northerly point of Europe, Knivskjellodden in Norway, lies at . War and trade had led to voyages between western Norway and Northern Russia around Knivskjellodden and the North Cape since at least the 15th Century.

In 1607, Henry Hudson probably reached Hakluyt's Headland (a little south of the latitude reached by Barentz), but could not proceed further as ice lay packed along Spitsbergen's north coast. In 1612, an explorer from Hull, Thomas Marmaduke, claimed to have reached 82¬∞N, while Dutch explorers in 1614 and 1624 claimed to have sailed even further north to 83¬∞N.

In 1707, the Dutch whaler Cornelis Giles rounded the northernmost point of Nordaustlandet in Svalbard, passing 81¬∞N. In 1806, the Resolution of Whitby, under William Scoresby, Sr, was said to have sailed north of the Seven Islands and reached .

Cook and Peary  Two American explorers claimed to reach the North Pole; Frederick Cook in 1908 and Robert Peary in 1909. Cook's claim was soon judged to be fraudulent, and Peary was credited as the discoverer of the North Pole for much of the 20th century. In recent decades, however, Peary's claim has become the subject of controversy, though he did set a new record for Farthest North ‚Äì his support party was dismissed at . With Peary's claim accepted at the time, overland expeditions to the North Pole came to an end. Roald Amundsen of Norway redirected his planned Arctic expedition and instead aimed for the South Pole, which he achieved in 1911.  Wilkins‚ÄìEllsworth expedition  In 1931, an expedition led by Sir Hubert Wilkins and Lincoln Ellsworth and partly financed by William Randolph Hearst, attempted to reach the North Pole with a leased US Navy submarine named Nautilus. The Nautilus was modified for under ice operations by submarine designer Simon Lake so it could detect openings (or, if necessary, drill them) in the ice pack and surface to recharge her batteries. While the expedition was a failure, the Nautilus did reach a latitude of 82 degrees north. In accordance with the lease agreement, the Nautilus was scuttled after the expedition to prevent her reuse as a warship.  Conquest  Navigator's report: Nautilus, , On 9 May 1926, Richard Evelyn Byrd attempted to fly over the North Pole in an airplane. He was widely credited with achieving this, but his claim subsequently became subject to doubt. Finally, on , the airship Norge carried Roald Amundsen and fifteen other men including the craft's designer and pilot Umberto Nobile, helmsman Oscar Wisting, navigator Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen, and the expedition's sponsor, Lincoln Ellsworth, over the North Pole, en route from Spitsbergen to Alaska, the first achievement of the Pole about which there is no controversy. The first person definitely to set foot on the Pole was the Russian Alexander Kuznetsov, who landed an aircraft there in 1948. On , a US Navy submarine, also named , was the first to sail under the ice pack to reach the North Pole. On , the became the first submarine to surface at the North Pole. Ralph Plaisted and his three companions, Walt Pederson, Gerry Pitzl and Jean-Luc Bombardier, are regarded by most polar authorities to be the first to succeed in a surface traverse by snowmobile across the ice to the North Pole on 20 April 1968, making the first confirmed surface conquest of the Pole before being airlifted out. On 6 April 1969, British explorer Sir Wally Herbert became the first person to indubitably reach the Pole on foot, having sledged from Alaska. His expedition was supported by air drops.

Edd Mayfield and two of his brothers, Smokey Mayfield (1924‚Äì2008) of Spearman and Herbert E. Mayfield (1920‚Äì2008) of Dimmitt, were part of the Mayfield Brothers Country band in West Texas. Biography Mayfield was born in Dawn in Deaf Smith County, southwest of Amarillo, to William Fletcher Mayfield (died 1952) and the former Penelope Drake (died 1937). The family was involved in music, rodeo, and ranching. Mayfield served in the Pacific Theater of World War II. The Mayfield Brothers were offered a recording contract, but turned it down because of the business of the family's Green Valley Ranch. In the summer of 1951, Bill Monroe's guitarist, Carter Stanley, left the band, and Monroe, who had heard of Mayfield, offered him the vacant slot as guitarist in the Bluegrass Boys. At the time he joined the Bluegrass Boys, Edd Mayfield was described as \\"a handsome, tough-as-barbed-wire cowpuncher, who literally grew up on a ranch, who could ride hard, lasso accurately, and literally toss and tie up a bull. . . and had the wiry strength of a gymnast.\\"Google Books, Can't You Hear Me Callin'? On October 28, 1951, Mayfield made the first of his 19 recordings with Bill Monroe and His Bluegrass Boys, but he left the group within a year and was replaced by Jimmy Martin. In 1954, when Martin had left the band, Mayfield rejoined the Bluegrass Boys. A few months later he again quit. In early 1958, Mayfield returned to Monroe for the last time. He contracted leukemia, became ill while on the road with the band, and within 3 days of being stricken, died at a hospital in Bluefield, West Virginia. He was 32.

It lies, as its name suggests, on the River Wye, just downstream from the market town of Rhayader, and in the community of Llanyre.  Location  Newbridge-on-Wye is located roughly in the middle of Wales, and lies 7.1 miles south of Rhayader. The main road running through the village is the A470, running from Rhayader to the north and Builth Wells to the south. The B4358 also passes through the village; it runs from Beulah in the west through to Llandrindod Wells in the east. This road system is useful for commuters traveling from west and north- west Wales to areas in the south.  History  Newbridge-on-Wye was historically a stop off point for drovers, who moved livestock from place to place. Newbridge-on-Wye proved to be an ideal location for drovers to stop and rest because it afforded a safe crossing-point on the river Wye. This led to a settlement forming, including a large number of pubs. This fact is celebrated by the statue of a drover on the village green. Newbridge-on-Wye also sited a railway station on the Mid-Wales Railway, until its closure on 31 December 1962. The site of the station is now occupied by a housing estate, although the old railway bridge still remains.  Newbridge-on-Wye Football Club  Newbridge-on-Wye Football Club plays in the Spar Mid Wales League Division Two. The team's greatest success was during the 2004/2005 season where they won the Mid Wales South League.  Newbridge-on-Wye Church In Wales Primary School  There has been a primary school present in Newbridge-on-Wye since 1868. The original school was subsequently replaced by a larger school in 1962. The second school was larger than the previous one, although it still remained relatively small, educating around 80 children in four main classrooms. It is situated just off the main road (A470) and has a large grass playing area at the back of the school. In March 2008 Powys County Council announced that the second school was to be demolished, and a ¬£2.5-million replacement to be built at the same site. Although the initial plan was to renovate the old school the council concluded that it would be more cost effective to build an entirely new one, that will accommodate around 118 pupils and will acquire a lower environmental impact (purportedly a 40% reduced energy consumption). Demolition of the old building started in the summer of 2008, and the new school opened in 2009. Across the road is the All Saints Church, with which the school is linked. The school holds festivals and services in the church throughout the year.

Born in Rahealty, County Tipperary, McLoughlin first played competitive hurling during his schooling at Thurles CBS. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Tipperary minor team. He joined the senior panel during the 1958 championship. McLoughlin went on to play a key role for during a hugely successful era for the team, and won four All-Ireland medals, seven Munster medals and two National Hurling League medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, McLoughlin won one Railway Cup medal. At club level he is a ten-time championship medallist with Thurles Sarsfields. Throughout his career McLoughlin made 26 championship appearances. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1969 championship. Playing career Inter-county =Senior= Beginnings McLoughlin joined the Tipperary senior team in 1958, however, he remained a peripheral figure on the team for a number of years. On 17 July 1960 McLoughglin made his senior championship debut in a 6-9 to 2-7 Munster semi-final defeat of reigning champions Waterford. He later won his first Munster medal following a narrow 4-13 to 4-11 defeat of Cork in what has been described as the toughest game of hurling ever played. This victory allowed Tipperary to advance directly to an All-Ireland final meeting with Wexford on 4 September 1960. A certain amount of over-confidence was obvious in the Tipperary camp, particularly in trainer Phil Purcell's comment that no player was capable of marking star forward Jimmy Doyle. The game ended in remarkable circumstances as the crowd invaded the pitch with a minute to go, mistaking the referee's whistle for the end of the game. When the crowd were finally moved off the pitch Tipperary continued playing with only twelve men, but Wexford won on a score line of 2-15 to 0-11. It was McLoughlin's first All-Ireland defeat. Total dominance 1961 saw McLoughlin add a second Munster medal to his collection, as old rivals Cork were downed by 3-6 to 0-7. The absence of the All-Ireland semi-final allowed Tipperary to advance directly to the final itself, with Dublin's first native hurling team providing the opposition on 3 September 1961. The game was a close run thing, however, Tipperary held on to win by 0-16 to 1-12. It was McLoughlin's first All-Ireland medal. In 1962 Tipperary were still the kingpins of Munster. A 5-14 to 2-3 trouncing of Waterford in the decider gave McLoughlin a third successive Munster medal. Tipperary's nemesis of two years earlier, Wexford, waited in Croke Park to test them once again in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 2 September 1962. Wexford, however, were not the force of old and the side got off to possibly the worst start ever by a team in a championship decider. After just ninety seconds the Leinster champions were down by two goals, however, the game turned out to be much closer than people expected. Tipperary eventually secured the win on a score line of 3-10 to 2-11, giving McLoughlin a second All-Ireland medal. After losing the following year's Munster final to Waterford in one of the hurling shocks of the decade, Tipperary bounced back in 1964. Tipperary later cantered casually past Cork by fourteen points in the provincial decider, giving McLoughlin a fourth Munster medal. The All-Ireland final on 6 September 1964 saw Kilkenny enter the game as firm favourites against Tipperary. John \\"Mackey\\" McKenna scored Tipp's first goal after ten minutes as the Munster champions took a 1-8 to 0-6 interval lead. The second half saw Tipperary score goals for fun, with Donie Nealon getting a hat-trick and McLoughlin another. Kilkenny were humiliated at the full-time whistle as Tipperary triumphed by 5-13 to 2-8. It was McLoughlin's third All-Ireland medal. In 1965 McLoughlin won a first National Hurling League medal as New York were narrowly defeated on an aggregate score of 6-19 to 5-20. Tipperary demolished all opposition in the provincial championship once again and a 4-11 to 0-5 trouncing of Cork gave him a fifth Munster medal. Wexford were Tipperary's opponents in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 5 September 1965, however, the game failed to live up to the two classic games between the two sides in 1960 and 1962. Victory went to Tipperary on that occasion by 2-16 to 0-10, courtesy of a brace of goals by McLoughlin. The win gave him a fourth All-Ireland medal. Decline After surrendering their provincial crown in 1966, Tipperary bounced back the following year, with McLoughlin winning a seventh Munster medal following a 4-12 to 2-6 defeat of Clare. 3 September 1967 saw Kilkenny face Tipperary in the All-Ireland decider. Tipperary looked like continuing their hoodoo over their near rivals as they took a 2-6 to 1-3 lead at half- time. Goalkeeper Ollie Walsh was the hero for Kilkenny as he made a series of spectacular saves, however, the team lost Eddie Keher and Tom Walsh to injury in the second half. In spite of this, Kilkenny laid to rest a bogey that Tipperary had over the team since 1922, and a 3-8 to 2-7 victory resulted in defeat for McLoughlin's team. McLoughlin won a second National League medal in 1968 as New York were defeated on an aggregate score of 6-27 to 4-22. Tipperary retained their status as provincial kingpins once again and a 2-13 to 1-7 trouncing of Cork gave McLoughlin a seventh Munster medal. For the fourth time of the decade, Wexford were Tipperary's opponents in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 1 September 1968. At half-time it looked as if Tipperary were cruising to another victory as they took an eight-point lead. Just after the restart Wexford had a Christy Jacob goal disallowed before Tony Doran scored a goal after just six minutes. Tipperary fought back, however, it was too late as Wexford won by 5-8 to 3-12. On 27 July 1969 McLoughlin played his last game for Tipperary in a 4-6 to 0-9 Munster final defeat by Cork.

Concept and presentation To Be Alive! was produced by the S.C. Johnson & Son for presentation at the Johnson Wax pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair. The film was designed to celebrate the common ground between different cultures by tracing how children in various parts of the world mature into adulthood. The film was shot over an 18-month period in various locations across the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa. In screening To Be Alive!, it was decided to use an experimental method consisting of three separate 18-foot screens. Unlike the Cinerama process that joined three screens into a single unbroken entity, the three screens for To Be Alive! were separated by one foot of space.New York Times obituary of Alexander Hamid In 1966, a book based on the film was released by S.C.

Pontyclun RFC is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and is a feeder club for the Cardiff Blues. Early history Although it is believed that rugby had been played in Pontyclun from the early 1880s; a game between a team from Pontyclun and Pentyrch was called off after crowd trouble in 1884,David (1987), pg 21. it is thought the rugby club was not created until 1886.Pontyclun and Talygarn, a History & Topography, J. Barry Davies The club accepts its creation date as 1887 as proof that Pontyclun played as a RFC during the 1887/88 season, recorded in the Pontypridd Chronicle on 11 November 1887. The match was recorded as Pontypridd Juniors against Pontyclown (a common misspelling of the town during the late 1800s) which Pontyclun won. There is also a report in the South Wales Daily News for 12 November 1888 of a match between Bridgend and Pontyclown which was news-worthy due to Pontyclun taking offence at the referee, resulting in the team leaving the pitch eight minutes before the end of the match. In September 1887 Pontyclun RFC applied for membership to the Welsh Rugby Union along with Llandovery, Chepstow and Brecon. The membership was granted in a meeting held at the Queen's Hotel in Cardiff later that year. Unfortunately for Pontyclun in 1886 the WRU appointed a new secretary, Walter E. Rees, and he brought an element of financial stability to an organisation that was once wasteful. Where clubs were once able to miss membership subscription fees with little reprise, Rees ensured that this was no longer the case and Pontylcun lost their WRU membership in 1888 due to missed subscriptions.David (1987), pg 24. Pontyclun RFC re-applied for Welsh Rugby Union membership in 1919 along with Llanharan and Taffs Well.

It was later extended to Karachi in India (now part of Pakistan), which was the terminus for the BOAC service from England. The name of the service was derived from the crew and passengers observing two sunrises on each flight. History In 1943, Royal Australian Air Force personnel were seconded to operate Consolidated PBY Catalina seaplane aircraft under the banner of Qantas. The plan called for flights between Crawley, Western Australia, and RAF Base Koggala in southern Ceylon. The flights were (then) the longest non-stop air route of any airline, over 3,500 nautical miles (6,480 km, 4,020 mi) across the Indian Ocean. Navigating without the aid of radio, the crews relied solely on rudimentary navigation by compass and stars during the trip. Five aircraft obtained under Lend-Lease were supplied by the British Air Ministry, and were named after stars used for navigation en route: Rigel Star, Spica Star, Altair Star, Vega Star and Antares Star. The first flight took place on 29 July 1943. Taking between 27 and 33 hours, with departure timed so that the flight crossed Japanese occupied territory during darkness, the crews would observe the sunrise twice, which led to the service being known as \\"The Double Sunrise\\". The flight route flown was along the coast from Crawley to Exmouth then setting out towards Cocos (Keeling) Island or Christmas Island (though neither was actually sighted during the flight) and onto Galle, a journey of approximately . After the success of the initial flights, it was decided to run a weekly service, with some services flying over Rottnest Island and then taking a direct line to Galle. As part of the Australia-England air route there was a surface component from Galle to Karachi that added considerable time to the service. This was later replaced by the Double Sunrise service, with Karachi to England flown by BOAC. Air crews would change in Galle taking the next plane in either direction minimizing the time taken to complete the journey. Though stripped of all non- essential equipment, including de-icing equipment and insulation, the average takeoff weight was (maximum takeoff weight for a PBY Catalina was ); this included of fuel, which gave the Catalina a range of . The service made 271 crossings, delivered over of mail and carried 860 passengers, including among them British MP Edith Summerskill and the journalist Keith Murdoch. Due to the weight of the auxiliary fuel, an average flight carried only 3 passengers and of essential mail. Starting in June 1944, Qantas augmented the Catalinas with the first of two converted Consolidated Liberator bombers. The Liberators flew a shorter over-water route from Learmonth to an airfield northeast of Colombo, but they could make the journey in 17 hours with of payload, whereas the Catalinas usually required at least 27 hours and their payload was limited to only . The route was named Kangaroo Service and marked the first time that Qantas's now-famous Kangaroo logo was used; passengers received a certificate proclaiming them as members of The Order of the Longest Hop. In June 1945, Avro Lancastrians were introduced on the England‚ÄìAustralia service, and the Liberators and Catalinas were soon shifted to other Qantas routes. Double Sunrise service ended on 18 July 1945. After the war, in accordance with the terms of the Lend-Lease agreement, the five modified Catalinas that had flown The Double Sunrise service were scuttled.

He was well known for his work on attitudes and intergroup relations. He earned his Ph.D. from Yale University. Research A major debate among attitude researchers in the 1970s concerned whether cognitive dissonance theory or self-perception theory best accounted for how people's attitudes change. While at Princeton University, Zanna and Joel Cooper conducted a landmark experiment that resolved the discrepancy in favor of cognitive dissonance. They demonstrated that arousal is necessary for some instances of attitude change‚Äîa precondition specified by dissonance theory but not by self-perception theory.Zanna, M. & Cooper, J. (1974). Dissonance and the pill: An attribution approach to studying the arousal properties of dissonance. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 29, 703-709. Zanna also demonstrated the existence of self-fulfilling prophecies within intergroup interactions.Word, C. O., Zanna, M. P., & Cooper, J., (1974). The nonverbal mediation of self-fulfilling prophecies in interracial interaction. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 10, 109‚Äì120. At the time, one explanation for why white Americans tended to be hired more often than African Americans was that African American candidates tended to perform poorly in job interviews (i.e., that it was due to actual performance, not prejudice on the part of white interviewers). Zanna and his fellow researchers demonstrated that it was actually non-verbal cues on the part of white interviewers that elicited poor performance from African American candidates. That is, interviewers expected African American candidates to perform poorly and treated them more coldly, causing poor performance in response. In a subsequent experiment, the researchers demonstrated that white candidates performed just as poorly when the interviewer treated them the way the previous African American candidates had been treated.

Today the hotel, since reopened with a restaurant and pub, and one of the orchard-era mansions remain, and the locality is a farming and recreational community. Climate Seymour Arm has a humid continental climate (Dfb) with warm, sometimes hot summers coupled with cool nights, and cold, rainy winters, though mild by Canadian standards.

Types include: * Transfusion hemosiderosis * Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis * Transfusional diabetes Hemosiderin deposition in the lungs is often seen after diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, which occurs in diseases such as Goodpasture's syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis. Mitral stenosis can also lead to pulmonary hemosiderosis. Hemosiderin collects throughout the body in hemochromatosis. Hemosiderin deposition in the liver is a common feature of hemochromatosis and is the cause of liver failure in the disease. Selective iron deposition in the beta cells of pancreatic islets leads to diabetes due to distribution of transferrin receptor on the beta cells of islets and in the skin leads to hyperpigmentation. Hemosiderin deposition in the brain is seen after bleeds from any source, including chronic subdural hemorrhage, cerebral arteriovenous malformations, cavernous hemangiomata. Hemosiderin collects in the skin and is slowly removed after bruising; hemosiderin may remain in some conditions such as stasis dermatitis. Hemosiderin in the kidneys has been associated with marked hemolysis and a rare blood disorder called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Hemosiderin may deposit in diseases associated with iron overload. These diseases are typically diseases in which chronic blood loss requires frequent blood transfusions, such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, though beta thalassemia minor has been associated with hemosiderin deposits in the liver in those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease independent of any transfusions. Iron overload occurs when iron intake is increased over a sustained period of time due to regular transfusion of whole blood and red cells or because of increased absorption of iron through the gastrointestinal tract (GI). Both these phenomena occur in thalassaemias, with blood transfusion therapy being the major cause of iron overload in thalassaemia major and increased GI absorption being more important in patients with intermedia thalassaemia who are not frequently transfused. Each unit of blood contains about 200mg iron. After 50 units have been transfused, or earlier in children, siderosis develops, with increased pigmentation of skin exposed to light and susceptibility to infection, reduced growth and delayed sexual development and puberty(24). The recommended red cell transfusion scheme for patients with Œ≤-thalassaemia amounts to 116-232 mg iron per Kg weight on an annual basis (0.32-0.64 mg/Kg/day). The human body lacks a mechanism to excrete excess iron. Iron accumulation is toxic to many tissues, causing heart failure, cirrhosis, liver cancer, growth retardation and endocrine abnormalities. In the absence of regular iron chelation therapy, the iron loading rates vary. Monitoring of transfusion iron overload is essential for effective and safe iron chelation tailored to the individual‚Äôs specific needs. Serum ferritin (SF) measured at least every 3 months (the currently accepted target value is between 500-1000 mg/L) should also be evaluated along with the liver iron concentration (LIC) assessed using a validated and standardized MRI technique and myocardial iron as measured by MRI-based methods with specific software T2*. For monitoring of transfusion iron overload, other organ function and iron-mediated damage, surveillance of the patient for diabetes, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism and hypoponadotropic hypogonadism is recommended. Diagnosis There are several methods available for diagnosing and monitoring hemosiderosis including: * Serum ferritin * Liver biopsy * MRI Serum ferritin is a low cost, readily available, and minimally invasive method for assessing body iron stores. However, the major problem with using it as an indicator of hemosiderosis is that it can be elevated in a range of other medical conditions unrelated to iron levels including infection, inflammation, fever, liver disease, renal disease and cancer. While liver biopsies provide a direct measure of liver iron concentration, the small sample size relative to the size of the liver can lead to sampling errors given the heterogeneity of iron concentration within the liver. Furthermore, the invasive nature of liver biopsy and the associated risks of complications (which can range from pain, haemorrhage, gallbladder perforation and other morbidities through to death in approx 1 in 10,000 cases) prevent it being used as a regular monitoring tool. MRI is emerging as an alternative method for measuring liver iron loading because it is non- invasive, safer and generally cheaper to perform than liver biopsy; does not suffer from problems with sampling variability; and can be used more frequently than performing liver biopsies.  Treatment  Treatment for hemosiderin focuses on limiting the effects of the underlying disease leading to continued deposition. In hemochromatosis, this entails frequent phlebotomy granulomatosis, immune suppression is required. Limiting blood transfusions and institution of iron chelation therapy when iron overload is detected are important when managing sickle-cell anemia and other chronic hemolytic anemias. The aims of iron chelation therapy include (a) prevention therapy in order to minimize the risk of onset of iron-mediated complications, (b) rescue therapy for the removal of storage iron and (c) emergency therapy if heart failure develops or if there is a downward trend of left ventricular (LV) function that requires hospitalisation using continuous intravenous desferrioxamine (DFO), possibly combined with deferiprone (DFP). It aims to balance the rate of iron accumulation from blood transfusion by increasing iron excretion in urine and in faeces with chelators. There are currently three licensed iron chelators, DFO, DFP and Deferasirox (DFX). The Guide for the Management of Transfusion Dependent Thalassaemia (TDT) issued by the Thalassaemia International Federation (TIF Publication No23, 2017) contains details of dose and regimen adjustment of iron chelation therapy, adherence to therapy and use of combination therapies as well as monitoring of chelation therapy in special circumstances such as pregnancy, renal impairment and summary recommendations.

It is a remake of Giuseppe Tornatore's Italian film Everybody's Fine. In Brazil, Russia and Japan the film was released direct-to-DVD. Plot Frank Goode, a recently widowed retiree, is getting ready for his children to come visit him. One by one though, each of his children calls to cancel on him at the last minute. Feeling a bit down by the rejections, Frank decides to head out on a cross-country trip, visiting each of his kids. Despite warnings from his doctor, Frank takes a train to New York City, to see one of his sons, David. David does not appear to be home and never shows up so Frank leaves him a card and leaves town to see his other children. While he is waiting for David, he sees one of David's paintings in a nearby art gallery window. His next visit is to daughter Amy in Chicago, who tells him it is a bad time to visit. She had turned down her father's earlier invitation to visit, saying that her son Jack was sick. However, once he gets to Amy's house, Frank realizes Jack was not sick and Amy was just making up an excuse. Frank hits a few golf balls with Jack in the yard of their impressive suburban home. Dinner is uncomfortable with tension between Jack and his father. The next morning, Frank accompanies Amy to her fancy downtown office and hears her agency's pitch for a TV ad. She takes him to the train station to visit his son Robert in Denver. While waiting, Amy introduces her father to a male co- worker. As Frank travels to each of his children's homes, the film cuts to phone conversations between the siblings. David is in some type of trouble in Mexico, and Amy is going there to find out what is happening; the sisters and Robert agree to not tell their father about David until they know for sure. Frank arrives in Denver expecting to see Robert conduct the city's orchestra. It turns out Robert is \\"only\\" a percussionist. Robert also tells Frank his visit is at a bad time, as the orchestra is flying to Europe the next day, but this is a lie. So within hours Frank prepares to take a bus to Las Vegas to visit his daughter Rosie. Frank is adamant that each visit be a surprise, but Robert calls Rosie to warn her of his arrival. After missing his train, Frank arrives in Las Vegas late, catching a ride part-way from a female truck driver. In a lonely hall of the bus station, during an encounter with a drug addict, Frank offers money to the drug addict. He takes it but they get into a quarrel about him being grateful for Frank's gesture. Through physical force, the drug addict tries to take all of Frank's money but fails. As a result, Frank's medicine bottle falls on the floor. To retaliate, the drug addict stomps on the medicine and crushes them. Frank scrapes up some of the crushed pills because he must take his medicine on a daily basis. He calls his doctor for a prescription refill but does not tell the doctor that he is hundreds of miles from home, traveling against doctor's advice. He has a dream that David is in trouble. Rosie meets him at the station in a stretch limo and tells him she was in a big show that ended the previous week. She takes him to her huge, fancy apartment, where her friend Jilly brings over her baby for babysitting. Frank overhears a message being left on an answering machine, indicating the apartment is actually borrowed from Rosie's friend. During dinner, Frank asks Rosie why his adult children never talked to him and told him things, when they told their mother everything. She reveals that they were not comfortable opening up to him because he always expected too much of them and he was never a good listener. Frank is not comfortable, having a feeling that all his kids are lying to him and that something is wrong about David. Frank flies back home but ‚Äî without any more pills ‚Äî he has a heart attack in the plane's lavatory. Frank has another dream of his kids as young children and deduces each of their secrets by way of confronting them: Amy is separated from her husband which caused the tension between him and his son, Robert lied about going to Europe with his orchestra and Rosie is really bisexual, as well as the mother of the child Jilly brought over. Frank awakens in hospital, with Amy, Robert and Rosie around his bedside. Frank confronts his children about their lies and they finally reveal him that David had died from an overdose and that he had been depressed. During the night, Frank has a vision about a young David being in his hospital room. Frank tells him that he would have been happy about him no matter how he turned out to be and that he was sorry. David reassures him that it was not his fault and leaves. After recovering Frank visits his wife's grave and talks to her. He tells her all about the kids and his regrets about pushing them too much and not trying to understand them more. Frank goes back to the Art Gallery below David's apartment to buy David's painting, but it has already been sold. The girl at the desk tells him that if any of David's art comes through, she would let him know. After leaving, she runs out to tell Frank about how great his son was, upon realizing the family connection after reading the contact info he left. She shows him another painting by David that is more appropriate to him ‚Äî a landscape showing PVC-covered power lines made out of glue and macaroni in homage to Frank's career. The last scene shows the family at Christmas. All three children are around the house helping cook and decorate the tree. It is also revealed that Rosie and Jilly are a couple and are raising the baby together. Frank finally walks into the dining room and they happily eat together.

Reception Critical reaction The film received mixed reviews from film critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 47% based on reviews from 141 critics, with a rating average of 5.34/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"A calm, charismatic performance from Robert De Niro nearly saves the movie, but ultimately, Everybody's Fine has the look and feel of a stereotypical Christmas dramedy.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from film critics, the film has a rating score of 47 based on 25 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Michael Medved gave Everybody's Fine two stars (out of four), calling the film \\"...bleak, deeply depressive, and utterly depressing...\\" But he also added that \\"DeNiro's acting is intense and moving as always.\\" Overall, the critic's consensus praises Robert De Niro for having \\"intensity and presence that shines through even when he's not playing Travis Bickle/Jake LaMotta types, \\"but the movie becomes overly sentimental, and the supporting players aren't given three-dimensional characters to play.\\" Box office The film \\"unspooled in 10th [place] with $4 million.\\" As of December 6, the film has grossed $4,027,000. It closed on December 24, 2009 after a brief three-week run. Awards Everybody's Fine was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film ‚Äì Wide Release. Drew Barrymore also received the Vanguard Award at the 21st GLAAD Media Awards ceremony, in part due to her performance in the film. Soundtrack Paul McCartney wrote the ballad \\"(I Want to) Come Home\\" for the film after seeing an advance screening. Though he wrote the song from the perspective of De Niro's character, afterwards, he realized it could also be heard from the adult children's view. It led to a Golden Globe nomination for Best Song.

His father Spencer Perceval, a son of the 2nd Earl of Egmont, was a lawyer and politician who became prime minister in 1809. Perceval was the tenth of thirteen children (of whom twelve survived infancy). When Perceval was nine his father was shot dead in the lobby of the House of Commons. The assassin, John Bellingham, was a merchant with a grievance against the government and was widely believed to be insane (although at his trial he pleaded injustice rather than insanity and was executed).M. Gillen 1972 Assassination of the prime minister: the shocking death of Spencer Perceval. London: Sidgwick and Jackson. Press reports described how one of the Perceval boys had been in Parliament and had seen his father's body moments after the shooting, and a psychoanalyst has suggested that this child was Perceval and that witnessing the scene may have been the cause of his subsequent regressive experience.J.W. Hamilton 2004 Perceval's psychosis revisited. Free Associations 11A: 89-103. Perceval himself recognised the loss of his father - along with mercury poisoning and over- study of religion - as a contributory factor in his breakdown. Perceval attended Harrow School and spent a year with a private tutor before obtaining an army commission, first in a cavalry regiment and then as a captain in the First Foot or Grenadier Guards. Much of his army career was spent on tours of duty in Portugal and Ireland; he did not see combat. A sober and religious man, Perceval felt increasingly out of place in the army and, in 1830, sold his commission and enrolled at Hertford College, Oxford. Although he found university life more to his liking than the army, Perceval didn't return for a second term in the autumn of 1830. Instead he embarked on a spiritual journey to Scotland, visiting a radical evangelical sect at Row who spoke in tongues and were said to perform miracles. Perceval came to believe he was guided by the holy spirit. He left Scotland to visit friends in Ireland, where he became disillusioned with religion, had sex with a prostitute, and was treated with mercury for a sexually transmitted infection. At this stage - it was December 1830 and he was 27 years old - his behaviour became so bizarre that his friends had him restrained and his eldest brother Spencer came to take him back to England and put him in a lunatic asylum. \\"Narrative of the treatment of a gentleman\\" After the murder of Perceval's father, Parliament had voted the family a sum of money of over ¬£50,000. It enabled Perceval's mother, who was his guardian when he became insane, to have him confined in two of England's most expensive private asylums. He spent about a year at Brislington House, Brislington near Bristol, followed by two years at Ticehurst House, Ticehurst in Sussex. In Brislington Asylum Perceval experienced, in spite of the expense, a regime of deprivation, brutality and degradation. For eight months, during which time he was completely under the control of his voices, spirits and presences, he was kept under restraint, either in a straitjacket or tied down in bed. Treatment consisted of cold baths and an operation to sever his temporal artery. When his reason began to return he was allowed more freedom and he eventually persuaded his mother to take him away from Brislington House. He was taken to Ticehurst Asylum, where he was treated better. Perceval spent his time in Ticehurst Asylum trying to obtain his release, something he finally achieved in early 1834. One of his first actions on release was to marry Anna Lesley Gardner, a cheesemonger's daughter, who was described by his family as \\"quite out of his station in life\\".D. Gray 1963 Spencer Perceval: the evangelical prime minister 1762-1812. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 52-3 fn5. The couple were to have four daughters: *Jane Beatrice, 1835‚Äì1893. *Alice Frederica, 1836‚Äì1941. *Selina Maria, 1838‚Äì1925, married her cousin Sir Horatio George Walpole, assistant under- secretary of state for India. *Fanny Louisa Charlotta, 1845‚Äì1862. Perceval and his wife then went to Paris, where their two eldest daughters were born. In Paris Perceval started working on a book about his experiences. It was published in 1838 under the title \\"A narrative of the treatment experienced by a Gentleman during a state of mental derangement designed to explain the causes and nature of insanity, and to expose the injudicious conduct pursued towards many unfortunate sufferers under that calamity.\\" The book begins: > \\"In the year 1830, I was unfortunately deprived of the use of my reason. > This calamity befel me about Christmas. I was then in Dublin. The Almighty > allowed my mind to become a ruin under sickness - delusions of a religious > nature and treatment contrary to nature. My soul survived that ruin.\\" It goes on to give a brief account of Perceval's early life, and then covers his treatment in Edward Long Fox's asylum at Brislington, ending with Fox's parting words \\"Goodbye Mr ---, I wish I could give you hopes of recovery\\". Although the Narrative was published anonymously, there were clues to the author's identity, and it was given away by the Edinburgh Review. So Perceval decided to publish another volume, this time under his own name, describing how he fought to obtain his freedom while confined in Ticehurst Asylum, and including correspondence with his family and others that his publisher, Effingham Wilson, had persuaded him to leave out of the first volume. The second volume was published in 1840. Recovery and campaign work Perceval spent the rest of his life campaigning for the reform of the lunacy laws and for better treatment of asylum inmates, once referring to himself as \\"the attorney general of Her Majesty's madmen\\".Report of the select committee on lunatics. 1859 Parliamentary papers, second session, volume 7. He joined a small group of ex-inmates, their relatives and supporters to form the Alleged Lunatic's Friend Society in 1845. The following year he became their honorary secretary and remained in this position until the Society ceased to function about twenty years later. The aims of the Society, as set out in their first annual report, were to protect people from wrongful confinement or cruel and improper treatment, and bring about reform of the law. The Society campaigned via Parliament, the courts, local magistrates and public meetings and lectures.N. Hervey 1986 Advocacy or folly? The Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society, 1845-1863. Medical History 30: 245-75. They took up the cases of over 70 patients and exposed abuses in a number of asylums, including Bethlem Hospital, and asylums in Northampton and Gloucester.R. Hunter and I. Macalpine 1962 John Thomas Perceval (1803-1876): patient and reformer. Medical History 6: 391-5. Perceval combined \\"public agitation\\" with \\"private philanthropy to individual patients\\". Patients he helped included the German academic Edward Peithman who had been locked up in Bethlem for 14 years after annoying Prince Albert. Perceval obtained his provisional release and took him home to Herne Bay. When Peithman was detained again after another attempt to approach Prince Albert, Perceval once more secured his release and accompanied him to Germany (a condition of his release).J. Perceval 1854 Case of Dr. Peithman, LL.D.: the petition of Dr. Peithman... as presented to Her Majesty in 1854, containing a brief account of his history, and of the circumstances of his confinement for nearly sixteen years, without any trial, or public examination before a magistrate; together with letters, certificates, and testimonials to his sanity. London. Perceval befriended another Bethlem inmate, surgeon Arthur Legent Pearce, and published a volume of his poetry.F. Winslow 1851 An appeal from Bethlem. Journal of Psychological Medicine 4: 231. As well as publishing books and pamphlets on asylums, Perceval published a pamphlet criticising the new Poor Law and was elected to the Kensington Board of Guardians, a position which gave him access to asylums. He also delivered lectures; 1 May 1854 at the Kings Arms Tavern in Kensington High Street he addressed 24 respectable- looking people and an undercover policeman on the need for reform of the lunacy laws. In 1859, after many years of petitioning the government, the Alleged Lunatic's Friend Society finally achieved one of its main aims, a parliamentary hearing. Perceval gave evidence to the select committee on the care and treatment of lunatics on 11 July 1859. His brother-in-law and cousin, Spencer Horatio Walpole, was in the chair (one of Perceval's daughters would later marry one of Walpole's sons). Perceval argued for: better protection against wrongful confinement and medical experiments; safeguards on invasive treatment without consent; abolition of private asylums; greater rights for patients; more say for patients in decisions about their treatment; a better class of attendants in asylums; freedom of correspondence for patients; and greater involvement of clergy in asylums. To the disappointment of the Society, the select committee did not result in new legislation, and the Society appears to have lost its impetus in the following years. Writing to the John Bull magazine in 1862, about abuses in asylums, Perceval said the Society was lacking support and in disarray.John Bull, 25 January 1862, p. 54. Nothing more is heard of the Society. The cause for lunacy law reform was taken up by Louisa Lowe's Lunacy Law Reform Association, which had similar aims to the Alleged Lunatic's Friend Society.L. Lowe 1883 The Bastilles of England: or, the lunacy laws at work. London: Crookenden, p. 155. A letter to William Ewart Gladstone in 1868 about Ireland appears to be Perceval's last publication. He died in Munster House asylum in 1876 aged 73 and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.J.J. Howard and F.A. Crisp (eds.) 1898 Visitation of England and Wales, volume 6. Legacy Perceval was rediscovered when anthropologist Gregory Bateson published an edited version of the two volumes of the Narrative in 1962, under the title Perceval's narrative: a patient's account of his psychosis 1830-32. This was followed by an article by psychiatrists Richard A. Hunter and Ida Macalpine who concentrated on Perceval's activism, describing him as someone who \\"played a significant role at a crucial period in psychiatric history by his fearless and honest exposure of himself as well as what he considered the shortcomings of his time\\" and whose work was \\"prophetic in the accuracy of its prevision of present-day developments in mental health policy\\". It may have taken decades - sometimes more than a century - but many of the changes Perceval called for in evidence to the select committee 150 years ago were eventually legislated for. Perceval's Narrative continues to be studied by those interested in what it reveals about psychosis and recovery;E.

In addition to the long land border, India and Myanmar also share a maritime border along India's Andaman Islands.  History  Burmese ambassadors at Calcutta in 1882 India - Myanmar/Burmese relations date to antiquity and cultural exchanges included Buddhism and the Burmese script, which was based on the Indian Grantha script. In particular, Theravada Buddhism has tremendously influenced Burmese society and culture for millennia, with around 90% of Burma's population continuing to follow the religion. Myanmar (formerly Burma) was made a province of British India by British rulers and again separated in 1937. It was in Japanese-occupied Burma that Indian nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose delivered his \\"Give me blood and I will give you freedom!\\" slogan, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted Burma's role in the Indian independence movement. Jawaharlal Nehru with U Win, Burmese High Commissioner in India, on October 23,1947. India established diplomatic relations after Myanmar's independence from Great Britain in 1948. For many years, Indo- Burmese relations were strong due to Myanmar previously having been a province of India, due to cultural links, flourishing commerce, common interests in regional affairs and the presence of a significant Indian community in Myanmar. India provided considerable support when Myanmar struggled with regional insurgencies. However, the overthrow of the democratic government by the Military of Myanmar led to strains in ties. Along with much of the world, India condemned the suppression of democracy and Myanmar ordered the expulsion of the Burmese Indian community, increasing its own isolation from the world. Only China maintained close links with Myanmar while India supported the pro- democracy movement.Realism in India-Myanmar relations Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Myanmar President Thein Sein, 2014 A major breakthrough occurred in 1987 when the then-Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi visited Myanmar, but relations worsened after the military junta's reaction towards pro-democracy movements in 1988, which resulted in an influx of Burmese refugees into India. However, since 1993 the governments of the Indian Prime Ministers P. V. Narasimha Rao and Atal Bihari Vajpayee changed course and began to establish warmer relations between the two nations, as part of a wider foreign policy of increasing India's participation and influence in Southeast Asia, in light of the growing influence of the People's Republic of China, an India-Myanmar joint operation destroyed several militant camps of Arakan Army on the Indo- Myanmar border. The action averted a possible threat to the ambitious Kaladan transit and transport project which is important for improving the connectivity in the Northeast. Myanmar is important for India because of the geographic, historical, cultural and economic linkages/ties that span centuries as well as for the overall development of North-Eastern Indian states. India and Myanmar relationship officially got underway after the Treaty of Friendship was signed in 1951.. Economic relations India is Burma's 4th largest trading partner after Thailand, China and Singapore, and second largest export market after Thailand, absorbing 25 percent of its total exports. India is also the seventh most important source of Burma's imports. The governments of India and Myanmar had set a target of achieving $1 billion and bilateral trade reached US$1.3 billion by 2017. The Indian government has worked to extend air, land and sea routes to strengthen trade links with Myanmar and establish a gas pipeline. While the involvement of India's private sector has been low and growing at a slow pace, both governments are proceeding to enhance cooperation in agriculture, telecommunications, information technology, steel, oil, natural gas, hydrocarbons and food processing. The bilateral border trade agreement of 1994 provides for border trade to be carried out from three designated border points, one each in Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland.  Infrastructure initiatives  On 13 February 2001 India and Myanmar inaugurated 250 kilometre Tamu-Kalewa-Kalemyo highway, popularly called the Indo-Myanmar Friendship Road, built mainly by the Indian Army's Border Roads Organisation and aimed to provide a major strategic and commercial transport route connecting North-East India, and South Asia as a whole, to Southeast Asia. =India-Myanmar-Thailand Friendship Highway= India and Myanmar have agreed to a 4-lane, 3200 km triangular highway connecting India, Myanmar and Thailand. The route, which is expected to have completed during 2016,runs from India's northeastern states into Myanmar, where over 1,600 km of roads were built or improved. The route begins from Guwahati in India and connects to Mandalay in Myanmar, route continues to Yangon in Myanmar and then to Mae Sot in Thailand, which then continues to Bangkok. India is undertaking two sections of the Trilateral Highway namely, (i) construction of Kalewa-Yagyi road section in Myanmar, and (ii) construction of 69 bridges on the Tamu-Kyigone-Kalewa (TKK) road section in Myanmar. The work on both these sections has been awarded on Engineering, Procurement and Construction mode and is underway since May 2018 for Kalewa- Yagyi section and November 2017 for the TKK section.{{cite weburl= https://www.mea.gov.in/rajya- sabha.htm?dtl/30799/QUESTION+NO1127+STATUS+OF+TRILATERAL+HIGHWAY+PROJECTtitle= QUESTION NO.1127 STATUS OF TRILATERAL HIGHWAY PROJECTwork=mea.gov.inaccessdate=20 December 2018 The first phase connecting Guwahati to Mandalay will eventually be extended to Cambodia and Vietnam under Mekong-Ganga Cooperation within the wider framework of Asian Highway Network. This is aimed at creating a new economic zone ranging from Kolkata on the Bay of Bengal to Ho Chi Minh City on the South China Sea. =Kaladan Multi-modal Transit Route= The Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project will connect the eastern Indian seaport of Kolkata with Sittwe seaport in Myanmar by sea; it will then link Sittwe seaport to Lashio in Myanmar via Kaladan river boat route and then from Lashio on to Mizoram in India by road transport. The project was scheduled to be completed by 2014 according to Governor of Mizoram Vakkom Purushothaman., but as of Nov 2014 it is likely to be completed by 2016. Visas During a 2017 visit to Nay Pyi Taw, Prime Minister Modi announced that India would offer gratis/no-cost visas to all Myanmar citizens visiting India. Strategic cooperations India's move to forge close relations with Myanmar are motivated by a desire to counter China's growing influence as a regional leader and enhance its own influence and standing. Concerns and tensions increased in India over China's extensive military involvement in developing ports, naval and intelligence facilities and industries, specifically the upgrading of a naval base in Sittwe, a major seaport located close to the eastern Indian city of Kolkata. India's engagement of the Burmese military junta has helped ease the regime's international isolation and lessen Burma's reliance on China. Both nations sought to cooperate to counteract drug trafficking and insurgent groups operating in the border areas. India and Myanmar are leading members of BIMSTEC and the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation, along with Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand, helping India develop its influence and ties amongst Southeast Asian nations. In 2013, India provided a loan of about US$500million.Myanmar to use Indian bank loans for development to Myanmar for its development; India and Myanmar have also agreed to cooperate militarily in order to help modernize Myanmar's military. In 2020, India gifted the Myanmar navy its first ever submarine, a kilo class (INS Sindhuvir) attack submarine which has been refurbished and modernised by Hindustan Shipyard Limited. Security ties Indian and Myanmar troops carried out jointly Operation Sunrise and Operation Sunrise 2 in 2019 in their respective territories to destroy several insurgent camps. However the threat to the Kaladan multi-modal transit transport project, India's gateway to Southeast Asia continues.https://web.archive.org/web/20190619131007/https://www.financialexpress.com/defence/operation- sunrise-2-several-insurgent-camps-destroyed-along-indo-myanmar-border-myanmar- army-suffers-losses/1610987/ Indian has also supported Myanmar in its efforts to combat Rohingya insurgent groups like the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) and Aqa Mul Mujahideen (AMM), after Indian intelligence agencies found the ARSA and AMM to have links with terror groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) as well as reported Rohingya terrorists fighting alongside Pakistani extremists in Kashmir. Disaster relief India responded promptly and effectively in rendering assistance after natural disaster in Myanmar such as the earthquake in Shan state (2010) Cyclone Mora (2017), and Komen (2015). India offered to help in capacity building in disaster risk mitigation as well as strengthening Myanmar's National Disaster Response Mechanism. Human rights India was hesitant in reacting to the 2007 Burmese anti-government protests that had drawn overwhelming international condemnation. India also declared that it had no intention of interfering in Burma's internal affairs and that the Burmese people would have to achieve democracy by themselves as it respects the sovereignty of Myanmar. This low-key response has been widely criticised both within India and abroad as weakening India's credentials as a leading democratic nation. In contrast to much of the international community, Prime Minister Modi declined to criticize Suu Kyi's handling of the 2016‚Äì17 Northern Rakhine State clashes or Myanmar's government's treatment of its Rohingya people. India also announced plans to deport its Rohingya refugee population. Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju described the refugees as \\"illegal immigrants\\", echoing the Myanmar government position. Although the Rohingya have fought deportation in the Indian courts (partly on humanitarian grounds), in September 2017 the Indian government responded that India did not sign the 1951 Refugee Convention and most Rohingya arrived in India before the August 2017 violence. Some Indian media have reported that the country's intelligence agencies suspect militant Royhinga leaders of conspiring with Pakistani terrorists and planning to incite violence in India.\\"Varun Gandhi's View On Rohingya Draws Big Put-Down From Government\\" 26 September 2017, NDTV.com, retrieved 26 September 2017 See also * Arunachal Border Highway * Asian Highway Network * Foreign relations of Burma * India-Myanmar-Thailand Friendship Highway * India‚ÄìMyanmar barrier * India‚ÄìMyanmar border * Kha Maung Seik massacre  References  Further reading * * *Lokesh, Chandra, & International Academy of Indian Culture.

It also participated in military conflicts like the Western Sahara war. Additionally, they contribute to maintaining order and they are also present as border watch, and are the main backup force for firefighters during forest fires. During the Years of Lead, custody facilities such as Tazmamart and Agdz were mainly operated by elements of the auxiliary forces. The Auxiliary forces are a continuation of a low-rank military unit composed of Senegalese Tirailleurs and Goumiers, used by the French during the protectorate area, to repress Moroccans. Since the official French police patrolled only in the European area, this unit was responsible for maintaining order in the Moroccan neighbourhoods. They are known colloquially as the mroud (a Berber word for a type of Grasshopper), mkhaznia (from Makhzen) or as imkhazniyn in Berber. Mission Auxiliary Forces' missions are to support security forces and the army, maintain public security, and participate in operational missions of territory defense. History After the Second World War, France is recovering from war and instead of releasing wounded goumiers or those who have reached retirement age, the French army preferred to redeploy them in a subsidiary body. They performed odd jobs and assisted regular troops when needed. Officially named the mokhaznis they are placed under the Ministry of Interior. Their missions were to suppress the various demonstrations and riots that shook newly independent Morocco. In \\"time of peace,\\" the mokhaznis provided security of official buildings and assisted in the delivery of mail in remote regions. In 1971 and 1972, King Hassan II barely escaped two coup attempts by the Moroccan Army which climate of distrust evident between the monarchy and the army. This climate encouraged the growing strength of the police and the revival of the Auxiliary, put on hold since independence. The king personally nominated two senior members of the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces to head the Auxiliary Forces in 1974. The Auxiliary Forces were designated to lead in the maintenance of order and quick restoration of order in effected areas. The Auxiliary Forces were given a special status and a budget of nine billion centimes (a fortune at the time). Two thirds of the force were virtually incapable of military service due to age and or health reasons, the King had to recruit again and rebuild the whole force, \\"recalls one officer who served at that time. There was no shortage of candidates but they needed to be disciplined and healthy. Initial recruitment was conducted primarily in the regions of Ouarzazate and Errachidia. The king then created two areas of operation, North and South. In 1975, the Auxiliary Forces was at the front of the Green March. Western Sahara War When war broke out in the Sahara in 1976, the Auxiliary Forces are once again first in line. They were armed only with a locally manufactured version of the Beretta M3 sub-machine guns and received very little combat training and were confined by higher to their isolated bases in the middle of the desert and prevented from changing location. Consequently, they were an easy prey for the Polisario fighters and whole companies of them were slaughtered and captured. In fact, Moroccan army supreme command (General Dlimi, and Hassan II) underestimated the strength of the enemy and knew nothing of the nature of this region. In addition, King was always afraid to put weapons in the hands of the military but finally, after personally interviewing two Polisario fighters, was the king finally convinced of the military capability of Polisario. Only then did the Moroccan armed forces commit heavily in the Sahara. But the auxiliary forces, serving under the army officers acted as scouts, the camp guards and support troops. Almost two thirds of the casualties of the War of the Sahara belong to the Auxiliary Forces. From 1982, the Auxiliary Forces garrisons stationed at the Sahara participated, alongside the army, in the construction of the wall of defense. Later, operated and secured prisons like Kelaat mgoun or Agdz. Several years after the 1991 cease-fire the Auxiliary Forces remained essential in the management of the Sahara issue. In the mid-'90s, King Hassan II decided to give the region its first football team, he went to the local Auxiliary Forces. Founded in 1978, the Auxiliary Forces of Settat is better known as Bir Baouch, named after a village near Settat. In 1983, the team was transferred to mroud Benslimane before being called again in 1995 the Youth Sports Al Massira, the team that is now the Sahara in the national football championship. Years of Lead In the northern part of the kingdom, during the Years of Lead, the khaki uniformed Auxiliary Forces were seen as a force of repression. In Fes, Nador, Casablanca the Auxiliary Forces were accused of being responsible for several atrocities. There was much confusion as the Moroccan Army was often accused of dressing as Auxiliary Forces as they did not think the Auxiliary Forces would fire on unruly crowds because their own children were often in the crowd. Unlike the military, Auxiliary Forces barracks are typically located in the city center. They can be mobilized by the Governor or the Inspector General. citation needed In the early 80s, the Auxiliary Forces were hated by the population. They represented the authority in its most abusive, more brutal form. In addition to the repression of demonstrations, the Auxiliary Forces remain close and daily contact with the street. They are everywhere: in the souks, the prefectures, hospitals, post office, stadiums and even at the entrance of cinemas. More simply, they are the eyes and ears of the system. Administration In the prefectures, much of the administrative Makhzen is available to the mayors and governors. these are the found today at the entrance of buildings and doors of the important people. They do everything, for example they serve tea, introduce guests, collect the mail, track vendors and chase children playing soccer near the recently renovated public parks by the municipality. When not used at events or in the prefectures and wilayas, the Auxiliary Forces are assigned to border surveillance. Along the Mediterranean coast to the north, then along the berm to the south and south-west, several units of mobile Auxiliary Forces stand guard. In the early 90s, the units stationed north have gained importance, since Morocco embarked on the fight against illegal immigration and drug trafficking. Personnel posted to monitor the border is risen from 3000 in 1992 to 4,500 in 2004. Morocco is under a lot of pressure from the European Union to combat drug trafficking. In 2001, Spanish television showed a member of the Auxiliary Forces helping load their drug cargo and then to push their boat to the sea. Multi-capability General Laanigri, former head of the DGSN, was appointed the head of the Auxiliary Forces. He was charged with the modernization of the Auxiliary Forces and prepare it to assume new missions. Following his installation as the Inspectorate General located in Rabat, he created a third operational area which would extend to the borders of Agadir Mauritania. \\"The geographical distribution that exists today was adopted in 1974. At that time, the Sahara was not yet safe in the geography. Today the region accounts for nearly one third of the national territory. Create a third area is therefore obvious, \\"said a commander of the Auxiliary Forces. Since the end of the 1990s, nearly 6,000 Auxiliary Forces men are stationed along the berm or in the barracks in the south. The Sahara is still a sensitive area where law enforcement is a major challenge. Another challenge to General La√¢nigri, like all security officials of the country: the fight against terrorism. Last year, Cherki Drais, newly appointed head of the DGSN, had requested reinforcements for La√¢nigri. Thus, joint patrols of police and auxiliary forces of elements have emerged in major cities. Between officers of FA, there is even talk of preparing a new status for their bodies, with new missions and new ways (including weapons and dogs). According to cross the Mobile Intervention Unit (the famous CMI) should be dissolved in the DGSN, to be replaced by units of the Auxiliary Forces. \\"The units to be trained at the highest level, insists this specialist in military matters. Since Morocco is recycle the body of FA as much to do in depth. An element of the FA should be perfectly versatile intervene with gendarmes, police, military, customs or brigades of Water and Forests. \\" According to some of his collaborators, La√¢nigri floor on the thorny issue of image mroud. Further held, communication campaign, training abroad ...\\"None of these tracks is excluded\\", they say within the Inspectorate General. But how he campaigns will it take to change an image as tenacious, and the disappearance of reflexes that have the particularity of this body so special? The new chief mokhazni it holds the magic to conjure a curse dating back 50 years? Composition The auxiliary forces are composed of 45,000 men. In urban areas and cities, they are armed as needed. Their command at national level is organized in two geographic areas 1 : * North Zone (El Jadida - Tanger ) * South Zone (Safi-Lagouira) : The auxiliary forces are divided into two parts: * Auxiliary forces \\"administrative\\" deployed in administrations, ensuring their safety in collaboration with the Police (in urban areas) and the gendarmerie (in rural areas). * Auxiliary forces 'mobile' deployed in barracks throughout the country, having as main mission rapid response, in collaboration with territorial governments , the brigade of water and forests , the Civil Protection , the Moroccan Customs and the Royal Armed Forces .

Plot outline The story concerns a trapeze artist who wants to remain on his trapeze at all times, and never come down to the ground. He is faced with difficulties when the circus he belongs to must travel from place to place. The trapeze artist is said to be dedicated solely to perfecting his art. The theatrical group and the manager do not object to this as they proceed to accommodate his every demand, which Kafka notes is never refused. As such, when the artist does travel, he is said to get his own accommodation: for in- town shows, he is taken to performances in a race car so as to not prolong his sufferings, or, if travelling by train, a whole compartment is reserved and he travels atop the luggage. Upon arrival, the artist takes his place, hanging aloft the trapeze. Even during the performances of the theatrical group, he remains in public view but remains perfectly still. One day, as the group travels to another destination, the trapeze artist captures his manager's attention with a barely audible voice that is about to ask a question. The manager is immediately all attention and the artist tells the manager that in the future he would prefer to have a second trapeze. The manager agrees with the idea but it is not one that would have been otherwise refused. At this moment, however, the trapeze artist bursts into tears and says \\"Only the one bar in my hand--how can I go on living!\\" (448). The manager then assures him that he will get his second trapeze and the artist returns to his place atop the luggage and sleeps. But the manager now worries about the future of the artist as he has, for the first time, begun to question the nature of the art that is his profession: \\"Once such ideas began to torment him, would they ever quite leave him alone? Would they not threaten his very existence? And indeed the manager believed he could see, during the apparently peaceful sleep which had succeeded the fit furrows of care engraving themselves upon the trapeze artist's smooth, childlike forehead\\" (ibid).

The 152nd is equipped with the F-16 Fighting Falcon. History Origins In 1956, the United States Air Force, in an effort to upgrade to an all jet fighter force, required Air National Guard Aerospace Defense Command units to upgrade to jet-powered aircraft. The Rhode Island Air National Guard, 152d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, stationed at T.F. Green Municipal Airport in Warwick, was scheduled to replace its aging F-51D Mustang interceptors to F-84 Thunderjets. However, National Guard authorities found themselves in a conflict over the use of T.F. Green Municipal Airport in Warwick with its controlling Airport Commission with regards to using the airport for tactical jet operations. Unable to resolve these differences and no suitable location in the state to move the squadron, the Air Force removed the jets from the state and the National Guard Bureau transferred the 152d Fighter Interceptor Squadron to the Arizona Air National Guard. However, the National Guard Bureau's desire to have an Air National Guard flying unit located in every state brought a new mission and the numeric designation to the Rhode Island Air National Guard, the 143d Air Resupply Squadron using propeller-driven aircraft. The \\"new\\" 152d FIS was activated as a new Arizona Air National Guard organization with no prior history or lineage; the 143d Air Resupply Squadron was bestowed the lineage and history of the inactivated Rhode Island ANG 152d Fighter Interceptor Squadron. Arizona Air National Guard =Air Defense= 152d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron ‚Äì F-100A 53-1639 Upon the unit's activation in Tucson, the 152d was equipped with F-86A Sabre day fighters to use as interceptors. Its mission was the air defense of Southern Arizona. At that time of its arrival, its facilities at Tucson Municipal Airport consisted of an old adobe farmhouse and a dirt-floor hangar with enough space for three aircraft. In 1958, the F-100A Super Sabre arrived to supplement the F-86s. Despite the facility limitations, the Air Defense Command's Headquarters 4th Air Force judged the 152nd FIS outstanding in accomplishing its air defense mission. It declared the unit \\"Best in the West\\" in the 1950s and the early 1960s. Late in 1968 the unit received its first of five Air Force Outstanding Unit Citations for converting from the F-100-day- fighter to the all-weather F-102 \\"Delta Dagger\\" interceptor aircraft in just 10 months. The unit did it faster and better than any other Air National Guard unit converting to the F-102. =Fighter Training= On 1 July 1969, the Arizona Air National Guard 152d Fighter Interceptor Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 162d Tactical Fighter Training Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. With the change of status, the new 162d TFTG was assigned to Tactical Air Command. The re-designated 152d Tactical Fighter Training Squadron became the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 162d Headquarters, 162d Material Squadron (Maintenance), 162d Combat Support Squadron, and the 162d USAF Dispensary. With the United States withdrawal from the Vietnam War commencing in 1970, the North American F-100 Super Sabre was being retired from its active-duty mission, being replaced by either the F-4 Phantom II tactical fighter and A-7D Corsair II close air support aircraft. The F-100s were being transferred to the Air National Guard, which was upgrading from Republic F-84 Thunderjets and North American F-86 Sabres. The 162d Tactical Fighter Training Group was designated as the Air National Guard training unit with the mission of the unit to train combat-ready pilots for the Air National Guard (Replacement Training Unit or RTU). The 152d TFTS was equipped with the F-100C Super Sabre aircraft with a few dual-control twin-seat F-100F trainers. The unit graduated their first students in 1970. In 1972 the F-100C was replaced by the more advanced F-100D. Shortly afterward, the unit formed the Air National Guard F-100 Fighter Weapons School in Tucson. This school taught Air Guard and Reserve fighter pilots from throughout the country to effectively use advanced tactics and weapons technology. A-7D Corsair II aircraft (s/n 70-1006, 70-1013, 71-0342) from the 152d Tactical Fighter Squadron, fly in formation over the desert near Tucson, Arizona on 19 September 1981. The aircraft, each in a different paint scheme, were being tested against desert and forest background for visibility. In 1977, with the transfer of the A-7D Corsair IIs to the Air National Guard beginning in large numbers, 152d TFTS, along with its F-100s, began to receive twelve aircraft, primarily from the active-duty 354th Tactical Fighter Wing which was the first TAC wing to transition to the A-10 Thunderbolt II. The F-100 flight would continue to train F-100 students while the A-7 flight began to develop training syllabus for Corsair II students. In 1978 the F-100s were retired and the squadron became the A-7D training school for the ANG. For this transition, the unit received its second Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for successfully continuing to train F-100 students while completing the most challenging conversion in the unit's history. During the transition from F-100 to A-7D training in 1978, the squadron became a checkout and modification organization for new A-7D aircraft being produced by LTV. These new aircraft were produced due to a Congressional mandate to maintain the A-7D production line in Dallas, and the new aircraft were flown to Tucson for acceptance inspection. Upon receipt of the aircraft, the aircraft would be fully inspected and all discrepancies noted and repaired, being brought up to ANG standards. It would actually take about five or six months for the squadron to fly a series of check flights and work all the kinks out of the aircraft. Once completed, the squadron would transfer the aircraft to its assigned ANG squadron around the United States. Between 1978 and 1980 a total of 24 new A-7D aircraft were received, of which the squadron increased in size from 12 to a total of 24 aircraft. Because the unit was a training school, its aircraft were flown much heavily than other ANG squadrons which were also more demanding and stressful on the airframes. In order to keep the maximum number of aircraft fully operational, many aircraft were transferred to Tucson from other squadrons and the training aircraft in Tucson were sent to other units to insure all aircraft did not have excessive hours or stress on them. 152nd TFS A-7D 73-1008 modified to the twin-seat A-7K configuration. This aircraft was received by the squadron in 1989, after being used by the F-117A Nighthawk Stealth Fighter program as a training aircraft. In 1981, the squadron began receiving new A-7K a twin-seat dual-control trainer for the A-7D from LTV. The A-7K was a fully combat-capable aircraft and the squadron continued its acceptance inspection mission as well as its training mission. Eventually 20 A-7K aircraft were added to the squadron, along with its A-7Ds. The last of the A-7Ks were received in 1983, and with the shutdown of the assembly line in Dallas, the inspection and acceptance mission came to a close. The unit received its third Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for this and began another dimension in training in 1983 when the unit added the A-7 Fighter Weapons School, which replaced the F-100 FWS that was closed in 1978. In 1984, the 195th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron was activated as a 2nd RTU. In addition to the normal stream of Air National Guard pilots, during the early 1980s, the 152nd became a covert training unit for active-duty F-117A Nighthawk pilots. The A-7's cockpit layout and avionics were considered similar to those in the F-117. Pilots assigned to the F-117 program required a minimum of 1,000 fighter hours, and nearly all of the initial cadre for the F-117 were A-7D pilots due to the similar flight characteristics of the A-7D and F-117. Initially pilots in the program were sent to Tucson for a quick refresher course in A-7Ds that included academics, simulator time and six or seven flights to re-qualify them in the Corsair. When other fighter pilots began to be assigned, they were assigned to either a three or six-month course. depending on their experience in fighters. In 1988, the unit began converting to the Block 10 F-16A Fighting Falcon, which active-duty units were transferring to the ANG with the delivery of the more advanced F-16C. This transition took several years, with the last Corsairs being transferred out in 1990. The training mission remained after the conversion, but the older F-16A Block 10 airframes were not quite suited to fulfill this mission. Therefore, a number of more modern F-16A Block 15 airframes were introduced in the squadron after 1989 to be able to maintain a more modern training syllabus. In 1992 the ANG Staff decided to modernize the training that the squadron was providing to ANG crews as well as regular USAF units or NATO F-16 pilots. Therefore, more modern F-16C Block 42 airframes were delivered to the squadron. This opened a lot of opportunities. This block is specifically designed for attack operations during day and nighttime. It uses the advanced LANTIRN pod and the squadron has been training other crews in the usage of these systems. In recent years these airframes have been further upgraded with the CCIP program to make it possible for them to reach 8,000 flying hours easily. A number of additions (like a new MMC, an advanced AIFF system, etc.) were added to these airframes to further modernize their operations and make it possible to adjust the training sequence to include these advanced electronics.

The agreement marked the end of an 18-month-long political crisis in Lebanon. After battles broke out in Lebanon because of the ongoing political crisis, Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani (ruling Emir of Qatar from 1995 to 2013) invited all Lebanese political parties to its capital Doha to seek an agreement, to end the ongoing political crisis and avoid an eventual civil war.  Before Doha Agreement  Lebanon's ongoing political crisis suddenly exploded when the government made two decisions to remove Hezbollah's telecommunications network and dismiss the Rafik Hariri International Airport's head of security after finding out about a Hezbollah surveillance camera monitoring the western runway number 17, which is used primarily for executive jets.http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-05/2008-05-06-voa20.cfm?CFID=5455137&CFTOKEN;=96996524 In response to these decisions, mushrooming riots swept across Beirut resulting in heavy clashes between Hezbollah and the majority, afterwards Hezbollah forces invaded and took control of western Beirut. This was the first time since the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990) that weapons were used by Hezbollah on the internal front. Battles moved to several areas in the country including Mount Lebanon and the North, and 300 people are estimated to have died in the operation. The Arab council quickly acted to stop the violence. Based on the Arab initiative regarding containment of the Lebanese crisis, and in pursuance of the agreement concluded among the Lebanese parties in Beirut on 15 May 2008, under the aegis of the Arab Ministerial Committee an agreement was reached.  Lebanese national dialogue  The Lebanese National Dialogue Conference was held in Doha between 16 May and 21 May 2008, with the participation of the Lebanese political leaders who are members of the National Dialogue Conference and who have asserted their commitment to saving Lebanon and ending the current political crisis and its dangerous consequences for the coexistence formula and civil peace among the Lebanese, as well as their commitment to the principles enshrined by the Lebanese constitution and the Taif Agreement; and as a result of this Conference, as well as of the bilateral and collective meetings and consultations between the president and members of the Arab Ministerial Committee and all parties that took part in this Conference the parties were able to reach an agreement.  Provisions  First: The parties have agreed on having the Lebanese parliament speaker, based on the rules in effect, invite the parliament to convene within 24 hours to elect consensus candidate General Michel Suleiman, knowing that this is the best constitutional method to elect the president under these exceptional circumstances. Second: forming a national unity government composed of 30 ministers distributed among the majority (16 ministers), the opposition (11 ministers) and the president (3 ministers), and by virtue of this agreement, all parties commit not to resign or obstruct the government's actions. Third: adopting the kaza as an electoral constituency in conformity with the 1960 law, whereby the districts of Marjayoun-Hasbaya, Baalbek-Hermel and West Bekaa-Rashaya remain as a single electoral constituency each. As for Beirut, it was divided in the following manner: The first district: Achrafieh ‚Äì Rmeil ‚Äì Saifi The second district: Bachoura ‚Äì Medawar ‚Äì the Port The third district: Minet al-Hosn ‚Äì Ain al-Mreisseh ‚Äì Al-Mazraa ‚Äì Mousseitbeh ‚Äì Ras Beirut ‚Äì Zoqaq al-Blat Agreeing on referring the reform clauses mentioned in the draft law prepared by the National Commission on Electoral Law Reform, which was headed by Minister Fouad Boutros, to the parliament in order to examine and discuss them in accordance with the rules in effect. Fourth: Pursuant to the above- mentioned Beirut Agreement, especially Paragraphs 4 and 5, which stated the following: Paragraph 4: The parties commit to abstain from having recourse or resuming the use of weapons and violence in order to record political gains. Paragraph 5: Initiate a dialogue on promoting the Lebanese state's authority over all Lebanese territory and their relationship with the various groups on the Lebanese stage in order to ensure the state's and the citizens‚Äô security. Hence, the dialogue was initiated in Doha on promoting the state's authority according to Paragraph 5 of the Beirut Agreement, and an agreement was reached on the following: \\\\- Prohibiting the use of weapons or violence or taking refuge in them in any dispute whatsoever and under any circumstances, in order to ensure respect for the national partnership contract, based on the Lebanese people's commitment to live with one another within the framework of the Lebanese system, and to restrict the security and military authority over Lebanese nationals and residents to the state alone so as to ensure the continuity of the coexistence formula and civil peace among all the Lebanese; and the parties pledge to all of the above. \\\\- Implementing the law and upholding the sovereignty of the state throughout Lebanon so as not to have regions that serve as safe havens for outlaws, out of respect for the supremacy of the law, and referring all those who commit crimes and contraventions to the Lebanese judiciary. This dialogue is to be resumed under the aegis of the president as soon as he is elected and a national unity government is formed, and with the participation of the Arab League in such a way as to boost confidence among the Lebanese. Fifth: Reasserting the commitment of the Lebanese political leaders to immediately abstain from resorting to the rhetoric of treason or political or sectarian instigation. The Arab Ministerial Committee undertakes to register this agreement before the Arab League General Secretariat as soon as it is signed. The agreement was signed in Doha on May 21, 2008 by the Lebanese political leaders participating in the Conference and in the presence of the president and members of the Arab Ministerial Committee.‚Äù  International support  The UN Security Council welcomed the deal reached by Lebanon's majority and opposition blocs to end an 18-month political standoff and elect a new president. The UN ‚Äúwelcomes and strongly supports the agreement reached by Lebanese leaders in Doha on May 21..., which constitutes an essential step towards the resolution of the current crisis... and the complete restoration of Lebanon's unity, stability and independence.‚Äù In a non-binding statement adopted by all 15 members, the Security Council also ‚Äúwelcomes the agreement to ban the use of weapons and violence as a means to settle disputes, irrespective of their nature and under any circumstances.‚Äù It hailed the agreement between the Western-backed majority and the Hezbollah-led opposition, backed by Syria and Iran, to elect a new president, establish a national unity cabinet and address Lebanon's electoral law. The Council reaffirmed ‚Äúits strong support for the territorial integrity, sovereignty, unity and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized borders and under the sole and exclusive authority of the government of Lebanon over all Lebanese territory.‚Äù The statement also recalled previous Security Council resolutions calling for the dismantling and the disarming of all Lebanese and foreign militias. Individual countries also supported the agreement: *The agreement was welcomed by France, with President Nicolas Sarkozy saying that it was \\"great success for Lebanon and all the Lebanese, whose courage and patience never failed despite the ordeals they have been through.\\"Naharnet Newsdesk - Sarkozy Describes Qatar Accord as 'Great Success' French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said though the agreement failed to tackle the root of the political crisis, yet was a first step. \\"It goes in the right direction, but none of the essence (of the crisis) appears to have been resolved. Yet, it is better to have a president and a (functioning) government,\\" he said.Naharnet Newsdesk - Kouchner: Doha Accord Doesn't Tackle Crisis Roots France's UN Ambassador Jean-Maurice Ripert, for his part, saw the deal as ‚Äúa foundation upon which Lebanon and its national unity can be rebuilt and its sovereignty as well as territorial integrity reinforced.‚Äù *Germany welcomed the agreement. *Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson welcomed the agreement and said ‚ÄúIran hopes the Doha agreement will give the Lebanese a bright future.‚Äù *Saudi Arabia supported the agreement and its ambassador to Lebanon said \\"Saudi Arabia announces its support for the agreement. We are very happy that this accord has been reached.‚Äù *Syria welcomed the agreement. *The United States praised the agreement. \\"The United States welcomes the agreement reached by Lebanese leaders in Doha, Qatar. We view this agreement as a positive step towards resolving the current crisis by electing a President, forming a new government, and addressing Lebanon‚Äôs electoral law, consistent with the Arab League initiative. The United States supports the government of Lebanon and its complete authority over the entire territory of the country,\\" U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told reporters. US President George Bush released a statement saying he hoped the new agreement would ‚Äúusher in an era of political reconciliation to the benefit of all Lebanese.‚Äù *Britain's UN Ambassador John Sawers, the council chair this month, expressed hope that the Doha deal ‚Äúwill bring to an end a dispute that has being going on for far too long.‚Äù He also hoped that ‚Äúin the coming days, we will see implementation of this agreement and that the painstaking process of rebuilding Lebanese unity can begin.‚Äù  After Doha Agreement  The opposition ended its sit-in which had begun on 1 December 2006 in Beirut. On 25 May 2008, Lebanon's parliament elected General Michel Sleiman as the new president of the country, a post that had been vacant since November.  Lebanese reaction to agreement  After the agreement the opposition barricades were dismantled and so were the opposition protest camps in Martyrs' Square.A Political Breakthrough In Doha Lebanese across the political spectrum have greeted it with relief and joy. After electing President Michel Suleiman, fireworks erupted all over the country, and festivals were held all over Beirut such as the festivals in the Beirut Central District which was the first large non-political gathering in the district for months with Haifa Wehbe, Ragheb Alama, and Assi Al Hillany performing.

Kazadi was a founding member of the College of Commissioners where he had been appointed General Commissioner of National Defense by President Joseph Mobutu, during the Congo Crisis in 1960. In 1969, he was appointed Commissioner of State for Public Matters and Territorial Management. He was elected Deputy Commissioner of the People on three occasions (1966, 1972 and 1977).  Early life  Kazadi was born in Katende wa Bakwa Mwanza, north of Demba in the Kasa√Ø-Central region on April 24, 1925. His parents, Helene Ngalula Mulanga and Jean Dibomba Kabongo, had four children, of which Kazadi was the only son. Higher education was mainly provided by Catholic and Protestant missionaries. Kazadi had successfully completed high school at the Scheut Mission of Kabwe from 1934 to 1939. He distinguished himself through his abilities and the conspicuous influence of a Catechist father, so he was sent to the Small Seminary of Kabwe Ste Therese in December 1939, as few other choices were available to the elite. After six years of higher education, in 1946 he was admitted to the Large Seminary of Kabwe, in order to pursue studies in philosophy and theology for the next eight years. Kazadi was on the path to enter priesthood after 14 years of seminary studies, but he abandoned to protect his clan's lineage. Therefore, in 1952, he undertook career in public service. Kazadi first became the Official to the Provincial Secretariat, and later became a Specialist at the Governor Cabinet of the Kasai Province. In parallel with his administrative career, Kazadi participated in the independence struggle. Using the pen name \\"Kazadi wa Kabwe\\", he distinguished himself through his writings. In 1954, the first Congolese university, Lovanium University, opened in Leopoldville (Kinshasa). His ambition to acquire a better education despite his familial duties, led him to enroll in 1955 in the Political and Social Sciences Department. He received a degree in sociology in 1960. He wrote a memoir upon completing his studies, entitled The Life of An Unemployed in Kinshasa in 1960. During his years at Lovanium, he was nicknamed \\"Bismarck\\" due to his loyalty and firmness, based on German chancellor Otto von Bismarck. Kazadi was fluent in Chinese, Dutch, French, English, Latin, Swahili, Kikongo, Lingala, and Ciluba. He read extensively and loved classical music, which he was also able to read. He was a proficient harmonium player. He married Madeleine Mianda Ngadu in 1953. Political career  General Commissioner of Defense  On 14 September 1960, colonel Mobutu took over for the first time, neutralizing President Kasa-Vubu, arresting Prime Minister Lumumba and seizing power. Mobutu called upon the people's elite, the few university graduates still residing in the country, to form a government: the College of Commissioners-General. These individuals were in charge until February 1961. Kazadi was one of these individuals and was placed as General Commissioner of National Defense.  In South Kasai  The Lulua‚ÄìBaluba conflicts were stimulated by the colonizers and Lumumba's refusal of a resolution on behalf of the MNC. The exodus of the Balubas ensued, led them to relocate to southern Kasai. Kasai seceded as did Katanga. The Independent State of Southern Kasai existed from August 1960 to July 1961. Kazadi was its Police Force Minister. At the end of the Independent State of Southern Kasai, he escaped to Brazzaville.  Under Mobutu  Two years after the resumption of power by Mobutu in 1964, elections took place and Kazadi was elected National Deputy in 1966. Following this, he became Head of Research at the Office of National Research and Development. The creation of the Popular Movement of the Revolution in 1967, a party led by President Mobutu, effectively provoked the closing and dismissal of Parliament. In 1969, he was named Commissioner of State for Public Matters and Territorial Management. In the course of his passage, he founded the School of Truck-Driving Engineers in Kingabwa, Kinshasa. In 1970, he was promoted to Commander of National Order of the Leopard and was later appointed as Minister of State. Kazadi retired from political affairs in 1980.

Originally opened in 1902, the main hospital building was closed in 1997 and the site has since been redeveloped. History The hospital was designed by George Thomas Hine using an \\"echelon layout\\". Construction began in 1897 and it was officially opened as Kesteven County Asylum on 20 June 1902. The gardens were designed under a separate contract by William Goldring. An isolation unit, built in 1919 on the western edge of the site was never used as such; instead it housed those residents working on the farm. The facility became Kesteven Mental Hospital in 1924 and Rauceby Mental Hospital in 1933. In 1940 the building was taken over by the Royal Air Force; renamed as No.4 RAF Hospital Rauceby, it became a crash and burns unit under the control of nearby RAF Cranwell. During its tenure as a burns unit plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe worked at the facility, along with other members of the \\"Guinea Pig Club\\". The wartime Burns Unit was situated in Orchard House, built alongside the hospital orchard. There was a major fire in the hall in 1945 and it was badly damaged although it was subsequently restored. The RAF handed the hospital back for civilian use in 1947 and it joined the National Health Service as Rauceby Hospital in 1948 although patients did not actually return until 1949. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went through a period of decline and finally closed in December 1997. The site was subsequently developed for residential use by David Wilson Homes as \\"Greylees\\". The former isolation unit, now known as Ash Villa, functions as a 12-bedded in-patient unit for age 12‚Äì18 years within the child and adolescent mental health services under the control of the Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust.

The database storing the association's resource information is located in Gothenburg, Sweden. The group's goal was twofold: to serve as a reference guide to those researching sleep disorders, and to compile information about how different caregivers treat patients suffering from sleep apnea. 5,103 patients were tracked from March 2007 to August 2009. Data collected on these patients included symptoms suffered, medication, medical history, and sleep data, all inputted into an online format for further analysis. Database researchers reported on their methodology and results in 2010 to the American Thoracic Society, on their observed findings regarding percentages of metabolic and cardiovascular changes related to patients with obstructive sleep apnea.Hedner 2010 The 2010 research resulted from collaboration between 22 study centres across 16 countries in Europe involving 27 researchers. The primary participants who presented to the American Thoracic Society included researchers from: Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden; Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel; National TB & Lung Diseases Research Institute, Warsaw, Poland; CNR Institute of Biomedicine and Molecular, Palermo, Italy; Instituto Auxologico Italiano, Ospedale San Luca, Milan, Italy; and St. Vincent University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Their analysis was published in 2010 in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 2011 ‚Äì present In 2011 there were 22 sleep disorder centres in Europe involved in the collaboration. The group published research in 2011 analyzing the percentage of patients suffering from sleep apnea that have obesity. By 2012 the database maintained information on over 12,500 patients in Europe; it also contained DNA samples of 2,600 individuals. ESADA was represented in 2012 at the 21st annual meeting of the European Sleep Research Society in Paris, France, and was one of four European Sleep Research Networks that held a session at the event.ESRS Newsletter 2012, p. 8. Pierre Escourrou and Fadia Jilwan wrote a 2012 article for the European Respiratory Journal after studying data from ESADA involving 8,228 total patients from 23 different facilities.

They reported on the average age of patients in the database, and the prevalence by region of performing sleep study with cardiorespiratory polygraphy. The database added a centre in Hamburg, Germany in 2013 managed by physician Holger Hein. The group's annual meeting in 2013 was held in Edinburgh, United Kingdom and was run by Renata Riha. By March 2013, there were approximately 13,000 total patients being studied in the program, with about 200 additional patients being added into the database each month. Analysis published by researchers from Italy and Sweden in September 2013 in the European Respiratory Journal analyzed if there was a correlation between renal function problems and obstructive sleep apnea.Marrone 2013 They analyzed data from 17 countries in Europe representing 24 sleep centres and 8,112 total patients. They tested whether patients of different types of demographics with other existing health problems had a change in probability of kidney function problems, if they concurrently suffered from obstructive sleep apnea.

Fliper became more popular in 2002 when they released their debut album Wypas and MTV Polska, VIVA Polska and other music TV stations begun to air Fliper‚Äôs first videoclip ‚ÄúKocham Ciƒô i Kocham‚Äù, which was also the first single promoting the album. The third single from the album, which was a parody of the popular talent TV show Idol series, has encountered a big interest due to this fact. Fliper has given several hundred concerts around the country so far. The sound of the group is a mixture of guitar, bass and drums together with the brass section, consisting of a trumpet, trombone and occasionally saxophone. After three- year-long break they have returned in 2008 with a single ‚ÄúWirtualna mi≈Ço≈õƒá‚Äù which has been supported by a videoclip. Prior to that Fliper was a regular guest to a popular TV show ‚ÄúPodr√≥≈ºe z ≈ºartem‚Äù broadcast on TVP2 in 2006, 2007 and 2008.

This shrine was founded in the mid-17th century. Hanazono Jinja nestled in the heart of Tokyo's Shinjuku ward, Hanazono Jinja is a small and unobtrusive structure that, according to Fodor's, just happens to be one of the most historical shrines in Japan. Constructed in the Edo period by the Hanazono family, this Inari shrine‚Äîa shrine dedicated to Inari, the androgynous god of fertility and worldly success‚Äîis a favorite place for businessmen to pray for successful ventures. History Hanazono Shrine was originally founded before the start of the Edo period, about 250 meters south of its present-day location. In the Kan'ei era, the shrine was relocated to the gardens of the Owari-Tokugawa family, in an area that had until then been a prolific flower garden, to make space for the villa of a shogun‚Äôs vassal. Before the Meiji period, a branch temple of a Shingon Buddhism sect was enshrined with Hanazono‚Äôs Shinto shrine, and the Buddhist chief priest served as the manager of both. During the Meiji Restoration that began in March of 1868, the Buddhist object of worship was abolished from Hanazono, and the religious space returned to only a Shinto shrine. At the time, it was named simply ‚Äútown Inari shrine‚Äù because of a mistake in the submission to the official list of names. It was officially named \\"Hanazono Shrine\\" in 1965.

The 195th is equipped with the F-16 Fighting Falcon. History World War II : see: 373d Fighter Group for expanded World War II history Formed at Westover Field, Massachusetts in August 1943. During World War II the 410th Fighter Squadron was assigned to the European Theater of Operations (ETO), Ninth Air Force in Western Europe. It was equipped with P-47 Thunderbolts. The 410th flew its first combat mission on 8 May 1944, a fighter sweep over Normandy. It then took part in preinvasion activities, e.g., escorting B-26 Marauders to attack airdromes, bridges and railroads in Occupied France. The squadron patrolled the air over the beachhead when the Allies launched the Normandy invasion on 6 June 1944, and hit troops, tanks, roads, fuel depots and other targets in the assault area until the end of the month. The 410th moved to the Continent in July 1944 where it struck railroads, hangars, boxcars, warehouses and other objectives to prevent reinforcements from reaching the front at St. Lo, where the Allies broke through on 25 July 1944. The squadron bombed such targets as troops in the Falaise-Argentan area in August 1944. During the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 ‚Äì January 1945, the 410th concentrated on the destruction of bridges, marshalling yards and highways. It flew reconnaissance missions to support ground operations in the Rhine Valley in March 1945, hitting airfields, motor transports, etc. The squadron continued tactical air operations until 4 May 1945. Returned to the United States and prepared for transfer to the Pacific Theater during the Summer of 1945, the Japanese Capitulation in August led to the squadron's inactivation in November 1945. California Air National Guard 195th Fighter-Bomber Squadron ‚Äì North American F-86A Sabre Formation over Los Angeles, 1954 The wartime 410th Fighter Squadron was re-activated and re- designated as the 195th Fighter Squadron. It was allotted to the California Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Van Nuys Airport, California on 16 September 1946. The 195th Fighter Squadron was entitled to the history, honors, and colors of the 410th. The squadron was equipped with F-51D Mustangs and was assigned to the 146th Fighter Group, also at Van Nuys Airport by the National Guard Bureau. As part of the Continental Air Command Fourth Air Force, the squadron trained for tactical fighter missions and air- to-air combat. The unit was called to active federal service on 1 March 1951 for duty in the Korean War. Its parent 146th FG was transferred to Moody AFB, Georgia, where it trained pilots for Air Training Command. The 195th FS, however, remained at Van Nuys Airport as part of the Air Defense Command 28th Air Division. It was released from active duty and returned to California state control on 11 December 1952. After the Korean War, the squadron was equipped with the long-range F-51H Mustang and remained a part of Air Defense Command, in February 1954, it was equipped with F-86A Sabre jet interceptors. By July 1955 the transition from the F-51H Mustang to the F-86A Sabre was complete. The squadron was re-designated a Fighter Interceptor unit with an air defense mission for the Los Angeles area. During the 1950s, the squadron received newer F-86F Sabres in 1957 and later F-86H Sabre day interceptors in 1959. 1972 photo of 195th TAS C-130A 56-0468 in Alaska In 1960, the 146th FIG was reassigned to Military Air Transport Service, trading in its Sabre interceptors for 4-engines C-97 Stratofreighter transports. With air transportation recognized as a critical wartime need, the 146th was re- designated the 146th Air Transport Wing (Heavy). During the Berlin Crisis of 1961, both the Wing and squadron were federalized on 1 October 1961. From Van Nuys, the 195th augmented MATS airlift capability worldwide in support of the Air Force‚Äôs needs. It returned again to California state control on 31 August 1962. Throughout the 1960s, the unit flew long-distance transport missions in support of Air Force requirements, frequently sending aircraft to Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, and during the Vietnam War, to both South Vietnam, Okinawa and Thailand. The C-97s were retired in 1970 and the unit was transferred to Tactical Air Command. It transitioned to the C-130A Hercules theater transport, flying missions in support of TAC throughout the United States and Alaska. In 1973 the C-130A models were transferred to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force and they were replaced by the C-130B. During this period, both the 195th and its sister squadron, the 115th Tactical Airlift Squadron shared the same pool of aircraft. With the end of the Vietnam War, the California National Guard bureau decided to downsize the 146th Tactical Airlift Wing. With C-130s units being transferred to Military Airlift Command, the 195th TAS was inactivated on 30 September 1974. Its personnel, equipment and aircraft of the 195th TFS were reassigned to the 115th TAS. Arizona Air National Guard 195th TFS A-7D 71-330, about 1985 In late 1983, the 195th designation was transferred from California to the Arizona Air National Guard. It was formed in January 1984 as the 195 Tactical Fighter Training Squadron and was extended federal recognition on 1 February. The mission of the unit was to train combat-ready pilots for the Air National Guard (Replacement Training Unit or RTU). The 195th TFTS was the second of eventually four squadrons assigned to the 162d Tactical Fighter Training Group at Tucson ANGB. It was equipped with the A-7D/K Corsair II. The squadron was the last of the RTUs in the A-7D aircraft. Conversion from the A-7D/K started in 1991 when the 195th FS started to receive many older F-16A Block 5 aircraft from other USAF units. This mission remained after the conversion, but the older airframes were not quite suited to fulfill this mission. However, this transition was quite short-lived since the squadron had to disperse its airframes already a year later. With the A-7Ds being retired in 1992, the squadron became a strictly ground academic squadron with no aircraft assigned at the time. During the same period the ANG started with training foreign non-NATO pilots. Six aircraft from the 148th FTS were designated to begin a school for those students. This group of aircraft and an initial cadre of instructors formed what would later become IMT (International Military Training). The squadron had no official number or designation. In 1995 the ANG Staff decided to transfer this school into the 195th TFTS. Thus the squadron regained its aircraft and started flying again. This time these airframes were all F-16A block 15 models, giving the squadron a better opportunity in its task. In 2006 the squadron started converting to F-16C block 25 airframes. As one of the last F-16A block 15 airframe squadrons within the ANG and the USAF all together, it was decided to mothball the latter completely. Therefore, the squadron started receiving newer block 25 airframes that were becoming available from other squadrons. The mission of the squadron stayed exactly the same, just being able to perform in a more modern manner with the added capabilities of the block 25 aircraft.

The history of basketball began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts by Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith as a less injury-prone sport than football. Naismith was a 31-year old graduate student when he created the indoor sport to keep athletes indoors during the winters. The game became established fairly quickly and grew very popular as the 20th century progressed, first in America and then in other parts of the world. After basketball became established in American colleges, the professional game followed. The American National Basketball Association (NBA), established in 1946, grew to a multibillion- dollar enterprise by the end of the century, and basketball became an integral part of American culture. Early history Invention of the game The game of basketball as it is known today was created by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, to condition young athletes during cold months. Naismith was a physical education instructor at YMCA International Training School (now known as Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts. Upon the request of his boss, Naismith was tasked to create an indoor sports game to help athletes keep in shape in cold weather. It consisted of peach baskets and a soccer style ball. He published 13 rules for the new game. He divided his class of eighteen into two teams of nine players each and set about to teach them the basics of his new game. The objective of the game was to throw the basketball into the fruit baskets nailed to the lower railing of the gym balcony. Every time a point was scored, the game was halted so the janitor could bring out a ladder and retrieve the ball. After a while, the bottoms of the fruit baskets were removed. The first public basketball game was played in Springfield, Massachusetts, on March 11, 1892. Naismith's original rules An illustration of a basketball game that accompanied Naismith's article from The Triangle in 1892 listing his 13 rules. There were only thirteen rules of \\"basket ball\\": # The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands. # The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands. # A player cannot run with the ball, the player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, allowance to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at good speed. # The ball must be held in or between the hands, the arms or body must not be used for holding it. # No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed. The first infringement of this rule by any person shall count as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made, or if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game, no substitute. # A foul is striking the ball with the fist, violation of rules 3 and 4, and such as described in rule 5. # If either side makes three consecutive fouls it shall count a goal for opponents. # A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from grounds into the basket and stays there. If the ball rests on the edge and the opponent moves the basket it shall count as a goal. # When the ball goes out of bounds it shall be thrown into the field and played by the person first touching it. In case of a dispute, the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The \\"thrower-in\\" is allowed five seconds. If he holds it longer it shall go to the opponent. If any side persists in delaying the game, the umpire shall call a foul on them. # The umpire shall be the judge of the men and shall note the fouls, and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made. # The referee shall be the judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in-bounds, and to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made and keep account of the goals with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee. # The time shall be fifteen-minute halves, with five-minute rests between. # The side making the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner. In the case of a draw, the game may, by agreement of the captains, be continued until another goal is made.Wolff, Alexander. Sports Illustrated 100 Years of Hoops: A Fond Look Back at the Sport of Basketball. New York: Crescent Books;, 1995. The first basketball game The first basketball court: Springfield College On December 21, 1891, Naismith published rules for a new game using five basic ideas and thirteen rules.Arceri-Bianchini, p. 18-19. That day, he asked his class to play a match in the Armory Street court: 9 versus 9, using a soccer ball and two peach baskets. Frank Mahan, one of his students, wasn't so happy. He just said: \\"Harrumph. Another new game\\".Associated Press, Newly found documents shed light on basketball's birth, ESPN.com, 13 November 2006, Sports.espn.go.com. . Someone proposed to call it \\"Naismith Game\\", but he suggested \\"We have a ball and a basket: why don‚Äôt we call it basketball?\\"Arceri-Bianchini, p. 18. The eighteen players were John G. Thompson, Eugene S. Libby, Edwin P. Ruggles, William R. Chase, T. Duncan Patton, Frank Mahan, Finlay G. MacDonald, William H. Davis and Lyman Archibald, who defeated George Weller, Wilbert Carey, Ernest Hildner, Raymond Kaighn, Genzabaro Ishikawa, Benjamin S. French, Franklin Barnes, George Day and Henry Gelan 1‚Äì0.Arceri-Bianchini, p. 21. The goal was scored by Chase.Arceri-Bianchini, p. 22. There were other differences between Naismith's first idea and the game played today. The peach baskets were closed, and balls had to be retrieved manually, until a small hole was put in the bottom of the peach basket to poke the ball out using a stick. Only in 1906 were metal hoops, nets and backboards introduced. Moreover, earlier the soccer ball was replaced by a Spalding ball, similar to the one used today.Arceri-Bianchini, p. 20.Glenn, Dickey. The history of professional basketball since 1896. New York: Stein and Day, 1982. YMCA, U.S. Army spread development YMCA had a major role in spreading basketball throughout the United States, Canada, and the world. In 1893, Mel Rideout arranged the first European match in Paris, in Montmartre. At the same time, Bob Gailey went to Tientsin, China,Arceri- Bianchini, p. 79. Duncan Patton to India, Genzabaro Ishikawa to Japan, and C. Hareek to Persia.Arceri-Bianchini, p. 80. The First World War broke out in 1914, and the U.S. Army started fighting in Europe in 1917. During World War I, the American Expeditionary Force took basketball wherever it went. Together with the troops, there were hundreds of physical education teachers who knew basketball. Naismith also spent two years with YMCA in France in that period.Lesile Colbeck et al., The Basketball World, FIBA, Monaco, 1972, quoted by Arceri-Bianchini, p. 81. Early professional leagues, teams, and organizations Spalding basketball from 1922 The first professional league was founded in 1898. Six teams took part in the National Basketball League, and the first champions were the Trenton Nationals, followed by the New York Wanderers, the Bristol Pile Drivers and the Camden Electrics. The league was abandoned in 1904.Hoosierhistorian, National Basket Ball League, \\"Hoopedia\\", 9 May 2008, in Hoopedia.nba.com Then, many small championships were organized, but most of them were not as important as some teams who played for money against challengers. The Original Celtics, for instance, are considered the \\"fathers of basketball\\"Arceri-Bianchini, p. 37. and were presented as \\"World‚Äôs Basketball Champions\\"; the players had to sign a contract to play with them, and Jim Furey organized matches as a circus, moving daily from town to town. The Celtics became the strongest team, and their successes lasted from 1922 until 1928, when the team disbanded due to ownership problems. The Original Celtics are sometimes incorrectly thought of as forebears of the current Boston Celtics of the NBA; in reality, they share only a name, as today's Celtics were not founded until 1946, nearly two decades after the demise of the Original Celtics. In 1922, the first all-African American professional team was founded: the Rens (also known as New York Renaissance or Harlem Renaissance).Arceri-Bianchini, p. 38. The Rens were the Original Celtics‚Äô usual opponent, and for their matches a ticket cost $1.Arceri-Bianchini, p. 39. They took part in some official championships and won the first World Professional Basketball Tournament in 1939. The team disbanded in 1949.

Basketball in American colleges The greatest level of early basketball activity outside of YMCAs was seen in American colleges. The first known U.S. college to field a basketball team against an outside opponent was Vanderbilt University, which played against the local YMCA in Nashville, Tennessee, on February 7, 1893. The second recorded instance of an organized college basketball game was Geneva College's game against the New Brighton YMCA on April 8, 1893, in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, which Geneva won 3‚Äì0. The first recorded game between two college teams occurred on February 9, 1895, when Hamline University faced Minnesota A&M; (which later became a part of the University of Minnesota). Minnesota A&M; won the game, which was played under rules allowing nine players per side, 9‚Äì3. The first intercollegiate match using the modern rule of five players per side is often credited as a game between the University of Chicago and the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, Iowa, on January 18, 1896. The Chicago team, which was organized by Amos Alonzo Stagg, who had learned the game from James Naismith at Springfield YMCA, won the game 15‚Äì12. (Some sources state the first \\"true\\" five-on-five intercollegiate match was a game in 1897 between Yale and Penn, because the Iowa team, that played Chicago in 1896, was composed of University of Iowa students, but did not officially represent the University of Iowa ‚Äì rather being organized through a YMCA.) By 1900 the game of basketball had spread to colleges across the country . By 1897 the U.S. Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) had taken over oversight of basketball activity from YMCA. In April 1905, representatives of fifteen colleges separately took over control of the college game, creating the collegiate \\"Basket Ball Rule Committee.\\" The Committee was in turn absorbed into the predecessor of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 1909. The extremely popular NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament was started in 1939. First international games After its arrival in Europe, basketball developed very quickly. In 1909 the first international match was held in Saint Petersburg: Mayak Saint Petersburg beat a YMCA American team.Arceri-Bianchini, p. 81. The first great European event was held in 1919 in Joinville-le-Pont, near Paris, during the Inter-Allied Games. United States, led by future Hall of Fame player Max Friedman, won against Italy and France, and then Italy beat France. Basketball soon became popular among French and Italians. The Italian team had a white shirt with the House of Savoy shield and the players were: Arrigo and Marco Muggiani, Baccarini, Giuseppe Sessa, Palestra, Pecollo and Bagnoli.Arceri-Bianchini, p. 133. Formation of FIBA World basketball was growing, but it was on June 18, 1932 that a real international organization was formed, to coordinate tournaments and teams: that day, Argentina, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Romania and Switzerland founded the International Basketball Federation (F√©d√©ration internationale de basketball amateur, FIBA) in Geneva.History of FIBA, in FIBA.com. Its work was fundamental for the first inclusion of basketball in the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936. The first Olympic title was won by the U.S. national team: Sam Balter, Ralph Bishop, Joe Fortenberry, Tex Gibbons, Francis Johnson, Carl Knowles, Frank Lubin, Art Mollner, Donald Piper, Jack Ragland, Willard Schmidt, Carl Shy, Duane Swanson, Bill Wheatley and the trainer James Needles. Canada was runner-up; the games were played on an outdoor clay court. The first World Championship was held in Argentina in 1950.Arceri-Bianchini, p. 185. NBA The Basketball league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946 as the Basketball Association of America (BAA). The league adopted the name National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1949 after merging with the rival National Basketball League (NBL). As of the early 21st century, the NBA is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.Arceri-Bianchini, p. 49. Many rule changes have occurred since the inception of professional basketball that has altered the game to what we now recognize today. These rule changes did not occur all at once but instead evolved to suit the changing style of play. Starting with the widening of the free-throw lane in 1951 and a further extension in 1964, this change was made to reduce the dominant impact of Centres who played with their back facing the basket - otherwise known as Post Position. Then in 1954, the 24-second shot clock was introduced. This was done to increase the speed of the game, by forcing the team with the basketball to shoot the ball before the 24-second timer is up. Finally, the NBA introduced the three-point line, in the 1979-1980 season. This was done to spread out the players, which were predominantly playing underneath the basket at this time as well as add a further degree of difficulty to the game.Mertz, J., Hoover, L., Burke, J., Bellar, D., Jones, M., Leitzelar, B., & Judge, W. (2016). Ranking the Greatest Nba Players: A Sport Metrics Analysis. International Journal of Performance Analysis in Sport, 16(3), 737‚Äì759. https://doi.org/10.1080/24748668.2016.11868925 In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the influx of black athletes increased excitement and revitalized the NBA. By this time, the League was mainly composed of African American players, and most of the top stars were black. However, in the late 1970s, the popularity of the NBA was once again threatened by the decline in attendance and television ratings. In 1979, when the NBA's 40 years old, the TV audience will actually decline by 18% In the 1980s, former university superstar Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson of Los Angeles and Larry Bird of Boston once again gave hope to the league. They changed the way the game was played. That's because Johnson and Bird can do a lot of things that little players of the past could do, but they're six foot nine. They were finally selected as the 50 best players in NBA history. Just when the NBA needed a new force, Johnson and Bird gave the NBA a new big game to restore its low popularity. During and after that, some superstars entered the league, including Charles Barkley, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, and, of course, Michael Jordan, to name a few. American Basketball Association The American Basketball Association (ABA) was founded as an alternative to the NBA in 1967 at a time when the NBA was experiencing a lot of popularity. The ABA offered an alternative ethos and game style as well as some changes in the rules. Julius Erving was the leading player in the league, and helped launch a modern style of play that emphasizes leaping and play above the rim. His playing strength helped legitimize the American Basketball Association. The league emphasized excitement and liveliness, be it in the color of the ball (red, white and blue), the manner of play, wild promotions, or the three-point shot. National recognition and earnings were low, leading the league to look for a way out of its problems. Merger with the more established and very successful NBA was seen as a solution. The ABA was folded into the NBA in the summer of 1976, its four most successful franchises (the New York Nets, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs) being incorporated into the older league. The aggressive, loose style of play and the three-point shot were taken up by the NBA. African Americans in basketball With racial segregation affecting all areas of public life in the U.S. including sports, all-black basketball teams (Black Fives) were established in 1904.\\"How 'Black Fives' led to racial integration in basketball\\". BBC. Retrieved April 6, 2019 Dozens of all-black teams emerged during the Black Fives Era, in New York City, Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and other cities. The Smart Set Athletic Club of Brooklyn and the St. Christopher Club of New York City were established as the first fully organized independent all-black basketball teams in 1906. These teams were amateur. In 1907 the amateur, all-black Olympian Athletic League was formed in New York City consisting of the Smart Set Athletic Club, St. Christopher Club, Marathon Athletic Club, Alpha Physical Culture Club, and Jersey City Colored YMCA. The first inter-city basketball game between two black teams was played in 1907 when the Smart Set Athletic Club of Brooklyn travelled to Washington, DC to play the Crescent Athletic Club. In 1908 Smart Set Athletic Club of Brooklyn, a member of the Olympian Athletic League, was named the first Colored Basketball World's Champion. In 1910 Howard University‚Äôs first varsity basketball team began. In 1922 the Commonwealth Five, the first all-black professional team was founded. The New York Renaissance was founded in 1923. In 1939 the all-black New York Renaissance beat the all-white Oshkosh All-Stars in the World Pro Basketball Tournament. From the late 1920s the African American Harlem Globetrotters were a successful touring team, winning the WPBT in 1940. The all-white National Basketball League began to racially integrate in 1942 with 10 black players joining two teams, the Toledo Jim White Chevrolets, and the Chicago Studebakers. The NBA integrated in 1950‚Äì51 seasons, just two years after its founding, with three black players each achieving a separate milestone in that process. In the draft held immediately prior to that season, Chuck Cooper became the first black player drafted by an NBA team. Shortly after the draft, Nat Clifton became the first black player to sign an NBA contract. Finally, Earl Lloyd became the first black player to appear in an NBA game as his team started its season before either Cooper's or Clifton's. After the integration of the NBA, the Harlem Globetrotters started to focus on international touring and exhibition performances, including comic routines. These tours helped to popularize basketball internationally, and gave the Globetrotters the reputation as Basketball's goodwill ambassadors. Modern-day NBA The NBA has helped popularize basketball in other parts of the world. A large part of this is due to the transcendent stars that have played the game through the years. It was because of the play of Michael Jordan that basketball started to reach international audiences, especially on the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team, known as the Dream Team. After his final championship and second retirement in 1998, there was a void as in who would be the face of basketball. Soon after with the help of Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant would go on to win three straight championships from 2000‚Äì2002 with the Los Angeles Lakers, helping make basketball more popular in many places around the world, most noticeably China. Further championships in 2009 and 2010 helped raise his popularity. In 2015, he announced the following season would be his last. He would have played in 20 seasons by then. Another player who revolutionized the game of basketball was LeBron James. He was taken as the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, and has worked his way to become the face of the NBA and basketball around the world. He left the Cavaliers in 2010 to join the Miami Heat along with fellow stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in what become known as the controversial decision, winning back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013 before returning to the Cavaliers in 2014 where he won a third championship in 2016. He joined the Los Angeles Lakers on July 1, 2018. There have been many international players who helped globalize the game. The most noticeable would be Yao Ming. He was the first ever Chinese player to be selected with the number one overall pick in 2002 by the Houston Rockets. His play and presence in the NBA brought attention to basketball in Asian countries. The style of basketball has evolved over time as well. Basketball, especially in the 1990s and 2000s, used to give importance to big men. Games were slow-paced and very defense-oriented. Now because of teams like the San Antonio Spurs and the Golden State Warriors, ball movement and team play is more common. The game has slowly moved away from this type of play. The game now is up-tempo and teams are starting to involve a lot more three point shooting in their offenses. Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors has been a trendsetter with his shooting abilities. In a way he has popularized and re-energized the notion of shooting among the youth.

Wills' Ida Red served as the primary inspiration for Chuck Berry's first big hit Maybellene. It is chiefly identified by variations of the chorus: :Ida Red, Ida Red, I'm a plumb fool 'bout Ida Red. Verses are unrelated, rather humorous, and free form, changing from performance to performance. Ida Red's identity is unknown, but is feminine in most uses. The earliest recording is a one by Fiddlin' Powers & Family (Victor 19434, 1924), which includes vocals. There is also an early well-known instrumental by Dykes Magic City Trio, (Brunswick 125, 1927).Laird, Brunswick Records, pp 439-440. Like his father and grandfather, Wills, renowned in parts of Texas for his fiddling talents before he formed the Texas Playboys, would have learned this tune in his earliest days of fiddling. Ida Red, the personage, appears in a number of other songs only distantly related to the song \\"Ida Red\\". One, by Charlie Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers whose \\"Shootin' Creek\\" (Columbia 15286-D, 1928), a version of \\"Cripple Creek\\", contains verses from \\"Ida Red\\", i.e.: :Ida Red, she's a darned ol' fool, :Tried to put a saddle on a hump-back mule. Alan Lomax includes another in his collection of \\"Negro Bad Men\\" songs titled \\"Ida Red\\". Other than the title, this song is in no way related to the folk song. This song is of a criminal feeling sorry for himself. In every verse he wails to his woman: :Oh, weep! Oh, my Ida! There are also several songs that share the same tune but unrelated subject matter. These include \\"Down The Road\\" and \\"Over The Road I'm Bound to Go\\". Western swing \\"Sunday Night\\", by F.W. Root, 1878, provided some of the lyrics for the Bob Wills version of \\"Ida Red\\". In the 1930s Bob Wills took the old tune and set it to a 2/4 dance beat to be played by his Western swing dance band, the Texas Playboys. His 1938 recording (Vocalion 05079) became a hit. The song, as originally recorded by Wills, borrowed lyrics from an 1878 popular song written by Frederick W. Root (\\"Sunday Night\\"). The Wills version opens with: :Light's in the parlor, fire's in the grate, :Clock on the mantle says it's a'gettin' late, :Curtains on the window, snowy white, :The parlor's pleasant on Sunday night. \\"Sunday Night\\" opens with: :The light is in the parlor, A fire is in the grate; :The clock upon the mantle Ticks out \\"it's getting late\\" :The curtains at the windows Are made of snowy white, :The parlor is a pleasant place To sit on Sunday night, To sit on Sunday, Sunday night.Root, \\"Sunday Night\\". Wills and his Texas Playboys performed this arrangement of \\"Ida Red\\" in two of his movies; 'Go West, Young Lady (1941) and Blazing the Western Trail (1945). It has been revived by the award-winning Western Swing band The Hot Club of Cowtown and features on four of their albums: Swingin' Stampede (1998), Continental Stomp (2003; live version), Four Dead Batteries (film soundtrack, 2005), and Best Of The Hot Club of Cowtown (2008). \\"Ida Red Likes the Boogie\\" In 1949, Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys brought out a boogie woogie version of \\"Ida Red\\" called \\"Ida Red Likes The Boogie\\" (MGM K10570). In 1950 it spent 22 weeks on the charts, reaching #10.Whitburn, The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country Hits, p. 392. \\"Ida Red Likes The Boogie\\" has been recorded by other artists numerous times since. \\"Maybellene\\" In 1955, Chuck Berry's \\"Maybellene\\", adapted parts of \\"Ida Red\\" as recorded by Bob Wills in 1938 and is believed to be one of the first rock & roll songs ever recorded,NPR. 'Maybellene' by Jesse Wegman, July 2, 2000. reached #10 on the pop charts and #1 on the R&B; charts. As a result, Bob Wills was later posthumously inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as an early influence to rock & roll. Bluegrass and country Bluegrass and country versions, as performed by Bill Monroe and Roy Acuff, use the traditional humorous free floating verses, but in 4/4 time instead of following the easy going Appalachian tempo.

They debuted as an R&B;/Ballad vocal group with \\"Come Closer (Îã§Í∞ÄÏôÄÏÑú)\\" in 2006 and have since performed in a variety of music genres. They rose to popularity in 2008 with \\"L.O.V.E\\" and their retro-dance number \\"How Come,\\" and cemented their position in the K-pop world in 2009 with \\"Abracadabra\\", with its electronica-based genre, pioneering (albeit controversial) concept, along with its iconic and now globally recognized dance entitled 'The Arrogant Dance (ÏãúÍ±¥Î∞©Ï∂§)'‚Äîsuccessfully ingraining themselves into modern popular culture. The group started their venture into the Japanese music market with the release of a Japanese version of their massively successful 3rd Korean album, Sound-G, in late 2010, with full promotions being held throughout early 2011 under Sony Music Japan, where they gained moderate success. They returned to Korea in late 2011, to garner further success and critical acclaim with their 4th album and its title track \\"Sixth Sense\\". Other than promoting as a group, all of the members have released solo albums. History Debut: Your Story and Leave Ms. Kim The group's leader, Jea, was the one responsible of the group's creation and was actively involved in the selection of the other members, picking out Miryo, who was known as a capable female rapper from the hip-hop community having previously worked with other fellow rappers, such as Gil Seong-joon from Leessang, and the main female rapper in well-known hip-hop group Honey Family. Narsha was chosen when Jea remembered her as a \\"talented singer\\" from her high school days, and Ga-in was selected by the three members after she was eliminated from \\"Battle Shin Hwa.\\" According to Ga-in, she was crying in the bathroom after failing the audition, was found by composer Ahn Jung Hoon, and then was chosen through the audition in Brown Eyed Girls' company. Singer Yoari trained with the group until 2006, when it was decided she would be the lead singer for Sprinkler. The four members held several small size concerts, and considered the names \\"Crescendo\\" or \\"Dark Angel\\" before officially debuting as \\"Brown Eyed Girls\\". After more than 3 years of training in singing and holding several small size concerts, the Brown Eyed Girls released their debut album Your Story in South Korea on March 2, 2006, with the ballad track, \\"Come Closer\\" as their single. Debuting as a \\"faceless group\\" they did not appear on any visual media and chose to not even appear in their own music video. The album was well received by critics but did not do as well as expected commercially. The album was later re-released to include \\"Hold The Line\\" (which samples \\"Push The Button\\" by British girl band Sugababes and \\"Technologic\\" by Daft Punk). This song became a hit, further boosting the band's popularity. \\"Hold the Line\\" was disclosed across the world because it was included in the list of songs from the game Pump it Up. After a short break, the group went back into the studio to work on their second album Leave Ms. Kim (), which included their R&B; title track \\"You Got Me Fooled\\" (). Subsequent singles were \\"Oasis\\" () featuring Lee Jae Hoon and \\"It's Mine\\" (), a collaboration with fellow group SeeYa. During the break between their debut and second albums, the Brown Eyed Girls released their first digital single entitled \\"I Am a Summer\\" (), which was later included in their second LP. The first two albums contained typical R&B; ballads which had been very popular in the K-pop scene. However, the commercial success was relatively higher in two singles between the first and second albums. Moreover, the second album containing \\"You Got Me Fooled\\" () was released at nearly the same time as Wonder Girls' \\"Tell Me\\" which received a nationwide success in Korea. Therefore, their second album was once again a commercial disappointment. At the same time, the general K-pop scene was changing from R&B; ballads to dance music. 2008: With Love and My Style mini albums In January 2008, Brown Eyed Girls came back with their first mini-album \\"With L.O.V.E.\\" Their single, \\"L.O.V.E,\\" was a departure from the B.E.G. sound that people had come to know but it became an instant success and Brown Eyed Girls scored their first No. 1 song and also one of the top hit songs in the first half of 2008. \\"Love Action\\" was the second single taken from the mini album. With Love also marked the group's second digital album (after \\"I Am a Summer\\"), though it was released in conventional CD format as well. After the release of their first mini-album, they could achieve the commercial success. \\"Love\\" was composed by Saint-Binary and Min-Soo Lee. Looking to strengthen their success, Brown Eyed Girls returned again in September and released their second mini-album \\"My Style.\\" Title song \\"How Come\\" is a retro-style dance song that has become a popular trend. 2009‚Äì2010: Sound G, Japanese debut and solo activities On July 20, 2009, Brown Eyed Girls released their third full-length album, the double-disc Sound G. Even though \\"Candy Man\\" was the first song unveiled from the album, the first heavily promoted single was \\"Abracadabra,\\" which was composed by Ji-nu and Min-Soo Lee. He composed the first part of \\"Abracadabra,\\" and tried to compose the refrain part. However, he could not think of a good idea to make the refrain part. Therefore, Min-Soo Lee, who worked with BEG previously, helped and composed the refrain part of \\"Abracadabra.\\" The release of this album also saw a shift in the image of the group, as the members redefined themselves as independent and mature city girls. Their music video for their title track sparked controversies. As the group is sporting a substantially more provocative visual style, criticism has arisen for the suggestive and erotic themes that the video presents. They later released a \\"stage version\\" of the video, which focuses only on the choreography. Nevertheless, even with all the controversies they took the Kpop world by storm, snagging awards at music shows and year end music awards. The sexy hip dance became a national dance with a lot of fellow celebrities doing a parody of it. Later on, the group revealed a repackaged version of the album titled Sign that included a new single, \\"Sign,\\" along with \\"Drunk On Sleep\\" and a remix of their previous hit \\"Abracadabra.\\" The repackaged album was released along with the music video for \\"Sign.\\" The music video caused controversy because of its content: it featured scenes of violence and death, including the group members drowning in tanks of water. \\"Sign\\" has reached certain success, but it has not matched the success of the band's previous single \\"Abracadabra.\\" The quartet has been readying for their Japan debut since signing with major record label Sony Music Japan International. In August 2010, the group re-released Sound G in Japanese to promote them in the country, which indeed marks the beginning of their Japanese promotions. After the success of the album, the members concentrated more on their individual activities juggling it with their overseas schedules. In July, Narsha released her first solo album 'NARSHA' to meet certain success, In August, JeA collaborated with Rattpoom, a Thai singer, in his song 'Face to Face'. Later in October, Gain also started her solo activities through her debut album Step 2/4 with a strong interpolation of tango music, featuring 'Irreversible' as the title track. On October 31, she clutched her first win (Mutizen song) in Inkigayo. In December, JeA worked on her ballad single 'Because You Sting' featuring G.O. of MBLAQ. Aside from that they also became part of popular variety shows and sitcom. Ga-in appeared on We Got Married with 2AM's Jo Kwon beginning in September 2009. The couple was very popular in Korea and still is one of the most recognized virtual couples in the country. Regrettably, their virtual marriage came to an end after 15 months in January 2011. She made her acting debut in MBC daily sitcom 'All My Love'. She was the female lead 'Gaumji'. However, owing to schedule conflict, her filming in sitcom ended in May 2011. Narsha has appeared on Invincible Youth (also known as G7) since October 2009. She is known on the show as \\"Sung In Dol\\" (Adult idol) due to her age difference with other members and her funny, but naughty reactions on the show. She was also one of the fixed cast member in SBS's variety show 'Heroes'. In April 2010, she DJed on \\"Pump up the Volume\\" on KBS Cool FM. Due to Brown Eyed Girls' overseas promotions Narsha decided to leave the show, with her last broadcast on December 28, 2010. The group successfully ended the year with a concert entitled \\"Hot Winter Party\\" held in the Ax-Korea Hall in Seoul. 2011: Japanese promotions and return to Korea with Sixth Sense On January 17, the Japanese music video for \\"Sign\\" was released. Its content is completely different from the original Korean version of the song, since the new version focuses on choreography while the original version did not feature any. The group started their promotions in Japan in early 2011. The girls originally planned to hold a concert in Japan in April but due to the T≈çhoku earthquake in March, the concert was postponed to September instead. The band's first Japanese concert at C.C Lemon Hall in Shibuya took place on September 12. There, they unveiled one of their songs in their fourth album An Inconvenient Truth, which was composed by JeA and KZ. On September 6, NegaNetwork released an official comeback date, marking the end of their two- year hiatus. The group was expected to release a single on September 16 titled, \\"Hot Shot,\\" followed by their fourth album and music video \\"Sixth Sense\\" on September 23. The concept for this album is ‚ÄúResistance for freedom of expression through music via sixth sense.‚Äù Representatives of their agency, NegaNetwork explained, > This album focuses not only on their singing and performance. The members > hope to convey their thoughts to the public through music. Their title track > is an expression of the limitations of experiencing music with only five > senses, and it asks people to feel it instead with their sixth sense. The > song itself is very free in style. They kicked off their promotional cycle officially with a double stage performance of \\"Hot Shot\\" and \\"Sixth Sense\\" on September 24 on Music Core. and grabbed the top spot on M! Countdown and Inkigayo. They also broke the jinx of going down a slump after a ‚Äúbig hit‚Äù as they won over their famed song Abracadabra, receiving higher digital sales for Sixth Sense. They concluded their \\"Sixth Sense\\" promotions after a month but it was immediately followed by the release of a repackage of their fourth studio album. On November 4, their repackage album was released. They followed up promotions with their ballad song 'Cleansing Cream'. They officially concluded their promotional activities on November 18 with a final performance on KBS's ‚ÄòMusic Bank'. 2012: Solo activities, digital single and Tonight 37.2 ¬∞C The band in 2012 The members branched out to solo activities once again. Starting with Miryo, releasing her self- produced solo album, MIRYO a.k.a. JOHONEY on February 1. She had a rocky start with two of the songs from her album banned in broadcasting stations. Namely, ‚ÄúRevenger,‚Äù which according to SBS officials has lyrics depicting violence and the title track ‚ÄúDirty‚Äù for the lyrics of the song, containing the word, ‚Äúcross-eyed‚Äù which could be perceived as a derogatory term for the disabled thus forcing Miryo to change the lyrics to be able to perform on music shows. On TV, Narsha made her acting debut with MBC's drama \\"Light and Shadow\\" playing the role of an aspiring singer Lee Jung Ja and followed by Ooh La La Couple as a goddess. The other members participated on reality programs. Gain became a CEO of a public relations company called ‚ÄòMental Breakdown' particularly for the show, \\"OnStyle's Launch My Life ‚Äì Ga In's Fashion King.\\" While Miryo was included in Mnet's hiphop program Show me the Money, collaborating with a rookie rapper to compete against other contestants for the top spot. Jea also became a fixed member of Immortal Songs 2 but she later left the show due to her solo album promotions and was replaced by Narsha which later on left the show also due to her musical \\"When A Man Loves.\\" On July 17, BEG released their digital single \\"The Original\\" of the hybrid soul genre ‚Äì the genre the girls have originally debuted with. It has two tracks Come with me and the title track ‚ÄúA Midsummer Night's Dream‚Äù meant to be a gift to the fans who are still supporting the group despite it not being active at the moment. It was produced and composed by JeA. No promotional activities were done. Gain dropped her second mini-album on October 5 \\"Talk About S\\" with the title track Bloom. The title track and won the top spot in M! Countdown. JeA also pre-released the track \\"Let's Hug\\" on December 28 from her upcoming solo album. Before the year ended, fans of Brown Eyed Girls were finally able to see all four members up on stage together once again for their 19+ Rated ‚ÄòTonight 37.2 ¬∞C‚Äò concert. 2013: Black Box and sub-unit M&N; Brown Eyed Girls performing in 2013 at the World Rowing Championship Event Member JeA started the year by releasing her solo album \\"Just JeA,\\" showing her prowess as a vocalist and also a producer. Gain also surprised everyone by releasing a duet album on April 7 with label-mate Cho Hyung Woo, titled \\"Romantic Spring.\\" The album contains warm, beautiful love songs that perfectly fit the season. On July 4, a teaser image was released via Facebook and Twitter for Brown Eyed Girls' long-awaited comeback. July 9 marked the release of a digital-single: \\"Recipe (Î†àÏãúÌîº).\\" Renowned Korean Hip- Hop producer Primary produced the track \\"Recipe,\\" which served as a pre- release to the upcoming album, with Miryo and Dynamic Duo's Choiza writing the lyrics for the song. After the positive reception of their digital single from the public, they continued by releasing their 5th studio album, Black Box, on July 29, with \\"KILL BILL\\" being announced as the title track, being composed by Lee Gyu Hyun and member JeA. The music video teaser for \\"KILL BILL\\" was released on July 25, with the actual music video being revealed later, on July 28, followed by a special dance version on August 2. They performed their comeback stage on SBS' Inkigayo on July 28, as the opening act for the episode, performing pre-release single \\"Recipe (Î†àÏãúÌîº)\\" before their album title-track later in the show. They continued their promotions for the album throughout various music programmes (with the exception of KBS-run programmes for undisclosed reasons) until August 25 where they brought them to a close. Youngest member Gain also revealed in an interview that she will release another solo album after the Kill Bill promotions. In October 2013, Ga-In also broke onto the CPOP scene, featuring in Show Lo's music video for \\"ÊÑõÊäïÁæÖÁ∂≤ (Cast The Net Of Love).\\" On November 4, multiple sources in the entertainment field revealed that Miryo and Narsha will be forming a sub-unit and plan on releasing music for the unit in mid-November. While Brown Eyed Girls members have been well known to venture into solo activities, this is the first time in which two members will be working together as one team. On November 11, M&N; released their first single, titled \\"Tonight (Ïò§ÎäòÎ∞§),\\" which included two versions of the same track (one Korean, one English version), with the lyrical content to the first version being self-composed between the two members - on a later date during an interview, both members of the sub-unit stated that they had plans to release an album sometime within the next year, with it to feature a strong Hip Hop sound complete with promotional activities. 2014: Special Moments compilation album At the end of January 2014, Gain was revealed to be making a comeback with her 3rd mini album Truth or Dare on February 6, releasing a teaser picture along with the news. On January 22 she released a \\"mysterious and sexy\\" teaser still-cut from her pre-release track 'Fxxk U'. She later released a controversial teaser for the song showing two silhouettes behind a shower curtain and Gain saying \\"Fuck you.\\" Information released with the teaser said the song would feature singer Bumkey and be \\"simple yet melodious\\" and feature a classical guitar. The song and music video were released on January 27. The music video portrayed Gain and actor Joo Ji Hoon in a physically and emotionally abusive relationship. The song was created by lyricist Kim Eana and composer Lee Minsoo (who also worked with Gain on her previous solo single \\"Bloom\\"). The title song \\"Truth or Dare\\" deals with the topic of rumors and their effect on celebrities and their life. On August 6 it was announced that the group would be releasing a \\"greatest hits\\" album titled Special Moments, featuring several songs from the group's eight-year career, as well as a new track \\"Hush,\\" which would serve as the title track to the album. Special Moments has a two-disc format, with the first disc featuring the group's lead singles and promotional tracks, and the second disc focusing mainly on their ballad tracks. The album was released on August 11, 2014. 2015: Departure from Nega Network, contract with Mystic Entertainment and Basic On September 4, 2015, members JeA, Narsha, and Miryo became free agents after deciding not to renew their contracts with Nega Network. On October 1, 2015, all members have signed with Mystic Entertainment. On October 26, Mystic released the first batch of teaser pictures through BEG's official Twitter account. Each girl was shown posing in a desert like landscape, while the concept gave off a futuristic and science fiction feeling. Simultaneously they announced the release date of their upcoming 6th studio album, which was November 5 at midnight. Another batch of teaser pictures was released a day later on the 27th October. The track list was released on October 28 and revealed ten brand new tracks, with Brave New World (Ïã†ÏÑ∏Í≥Ñ) being the title track and Warm Hole (ÏõúÌôÄ) the second title track. Moreover, Jea and Miryo took part in the writing and composing several songs of the album. The title track Brave New World is writing by Kim Eana and composed by Lee Minsoo, who have also worked together on previous Brown Eyed Girls songs. The group appeared on the popular smartphone broadcast V App on the 29th where they stated that Brave New World was a choreography heavy song, couldn't actually reveal any more info about the album. During the course of the next few days they revealed teaser videos for non-title tracks, such as Ice Cream Time, Obsession and Wave. The teaser videos for the two title tracks Warm Hole and Brave New World were the last to be released. The girls held their first showcase of their careers called 'Comeback to the Basic' on November 4 where they also performed the side track Ice Cream Time. Youngest member Gain revealed during the showcase that she took part in choreographing Warm Hole and Brave New World, as well as forming the concept for their 6th album. The album and the music video for Brave New World got released on the same day. The reference to Aldous Huxley's novel Brave New World became obvious, though the theme of music video and song do not refer to discouragement of critical thinking, abundance of material goods and other plots as the novel does. However, the futuristic theme got picked up through time traveling in the music video as well as the idea of a dystopian state through the lyrics. The Warm Hole MV got released on November 5 and sparked a controversy due to the heavy sexual lyrics and references in the MV to a female's reproductive organ. But still they performed Warm Hole on the 5th November on M!Countdown as well as on the 6th on Music Bank. 2016-present: Hiatus, 10th anniversary, Narsha's departure from APOP Entertainment, RE_vive In 2016, it was reported that Brown Eyed Girls were the first girl group without any member changes for 10 years. For their 10th anniversary, the group held a concert with Kero One and KRNFX on March 18 at the Feria (now known as Club Bound LA) in Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA. On December 14, 2018, it was announced that Narsha would be leaving Mystic Story and APOP Entertainment. However, she would continue to promote with Brown Eyed Girls in future activities.https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=421&aid;=0003740980 The statement also revealed the group was preparing for a new comeback. In September 2019, the group set up an official Instagram, where they announced their new album RE_vive released on October 28.https://entertain.naver.com/now/read?oid=609&aid;=0000177293 Other musical efforts The group members have also been featured on several South Korean drama soundtracks including The Vineyard Man (Loving You), Queen of Games (), Dae Jo Yeong (), The Kingdom of The Winds (), My Fair Lady (I Love You), and The Slave Hunters (Stray Child). JeA also participated in OST songs even before Brown Eyed Girls' debut. Also, Miryo and JeA collaborated for the single \\"Love Is...\\" which was released in May 2010. They collaborated with 4minute in 2010 for a World Cup song. Ga-in also participated \\"4Tomorrow Project\\" with Kara's Seung Yeon, After School's Uee, and 4minute's Hyuna.

Permutation graphs may also be defined geometrically, as the intersection graphs of line segments whose endpoints lie on two parallel lines. Different permutations may give rise to the same permutation graph; a given graph has a unique representation (up to permutation symmetry) if it is prime with respect to the modular decomposition., p.191. Definition and characterization If œÉ = (œÉ1,œÉ2, ..., œÉn) is any permutation of the numbers from 1 to n, then one may define a permutation graph from œÉ in which there are n vertices v1, v2, ..., vn, and in which there is an edge vivj for any two indices i and j for which i < j and œÉi > œÉj. That is, two indices i and j determine an edge in the permutation graph exactly when they determine an inversion in the permutation. Given a permutation œÉ, one may also determine a set of line segments si with endpoints (i,0) and (œÉi,1). The endpoints of these segments lie on the two parallel lines y = 0 and y = 1, and two segments have a non-empty intersection if and only if they correspond to an inversion in the permutation. Thus, the permutation graph of œÉ coincides with the intersection graph of the segments. For every two parallel lines, and every finite set of line segments with endpoints on both lines, the intersection graph of the segments is a permutation graph; in the case that the segment endpoints are all distinct, a permutation for which it is the permutation graph may be given by numbering the segments on one of the two lines in consecutive order, and reading off these numbers in the order that the segment endpoints appear on the other line. Permutation graphs have several other equivalent characterizations: * A graph G is a permutation graph if and only if G is a circle graph that admits an equator, i.e., an additional chord that intersects every other chord., Proposition 4.7.1, p.57. *A graph G is a permutation graph if and only if both G and its complement \\\\overline{G} are comparability graphs.. *A graph G is a permutation graph if and only if it is the comparability graph of a partially ordered set that has order dimension at most two.. *If a graph G is a permutation graph, so is its complement. A permutation that represents the complement of G may be obtained by reversing the permutation representing G. Efficient algorithms It is possible to test whether a given graph is a permutation graph, and if so construct a permutation representing it, in linear time.. As a subclass of the perfect graphs, many problems that are NP- complete for arbitrary graphs may be solved efficiently for permutation graphs. For instance: * the largest clique in a permutation graph corresponds to the longest decreasing subsequence in the permutation defining the graph, so the clique problem may be solved in polynomial time for permutation graphs by using a longest decreasing subsequence algorithm.. * likewise, an increasing subsequence in a permutation corresponds to an independent set of the same size in the corresponding permutation graph. * the treewidth and pathwidth of permutation graphs can be computed in polynomial time; these algorithms exploit the fact that the number of inclusion minimal vertex separators in a permutation graph is polynomial in the size of the graph. Relation to other graph classes Permutation graphs are a special case of circle graphs, comparability graphs, the complements of comparability graphs, and trapezoid graphs. The subclasses of the permutation graphs include the bipartite permutation graphs (characterized by ) and the cographs. Notes References *. *. *. *. *. *. *.

He was the self-styled ambassador of the British East India Company in India. His is the first recorded burial of an Englishman in India.  Early life  John Mildenhall was born in 1560 in Little Bedwin, Wiltshire, England. He was the son of Sir John Mildenhall.  Marriage  John Mildenhall married Elizabeth Bates in England in 1579.  Travels to India  Mildenhall was one of the first British travellers to journey overland to India. His name first appears in the Court Records of the British East India Company concerning a letter sent by him \\"to his master Rich Stapers, declaring what privileges he had obtained in the Indies and offering them, and his services to the Company for 1,500 pounds in hand\\". On 21June 1608 the Court decided to consider his demand, and in October nominated Mildenhall as factor along with Lawrence Femell and Edward Abbott. However, Mildenhall demanded even more and as a consequence, negotiations came to an end. Entrusted with the sale of the Company goods in the Levant, Mildenhall, travelled through Eastern Europe, passed through Scio and Smyrna, and reached Constantinople on 29October 1599. After a six-month stay in Constantinople, he continued his journey and arrived at Aleppo on 24May 1600 where he stayed for forty-two days. On 7June 1600 Mildenhall left Aleppo with an entourage of six hundred people and, after travelling through Bir, Urfa, Diarbekir, Bitlis, Van, Nakhichevan, Julfa, Sultanieh, Kazvin, Kum, Kashan, Kirman, Sistan and Kandahar, he reached Lahore in 1603. Mildenhall was entrusted with the sale of the Company's goods in the Levant but he deceived the British East India Company by escaping to Persia instead. A letter from Ajmer dated 20September 1614 informs the British East India Company that an Englishman named Richard Steele had arrived at Aleppo along with another Englishman, Richard Newman, in pursuit of one John Midnall who had tried to flee with the Company's provisions to India but was overtaken and captured at Tombaz and taken back to Isfahan. Mildenhall was released soon afterwards but his goods were confiscated. However, he received compensation of 9,000 dollars in return. Soon after his release, Mildenhall travelled to India and reached Lahore in the company of Newman who had had an altercation with Steele and had chosen to follow Mildenhall. They parted at Lahore but reunited at Agra. Mildenhall reached the court of the Mughal Emperor Akbar and held discussions with him. However, he was regarded as an outlaw by the British East India Company whose exports to the Levant he had diverted to India. Moreover, his journey was not sponsored by the Company. Hence, the British East India Company sent Sir William Hawkins to India in pursuit of Mildenhall and to declare all his dealings null and void.  Burial  Mildenhall's tomb John Mildenhall is interred at the Roman Catholic cemetery in Agra. Originally his grave had a Portuguese inscription which read \\"Joa de Mendenal, Ingles, morreo aos [intelligble] 1614\\". In the 20th century an English inscription was added, probably by the colonial English government: :Here lies John Mildenhall, Englishman, who left London in 1599 and traveling to India through Persian, reached Agra in 1603 and spoke with the Emperor Akbar. On a second visit in 1614 he fell ill at Lahore, died at Ajmer, and was buried here through the good offices of Thomas Kerridge merchant.  References   Further reading  * Blunt, E. A.

It was first recognized by inspecting the intensity of mass-spectrometric signals of rare gas cluster ions. In case a gas condenses into clusters of atoms, the number of atoms in these clusters that are most likely to form varies between a few and hundreds. However, there are peaks at specific cluster sizes, deviating from a pure statistical distribution. Therefore, it was concluded that clusters of these specific numbers of rare gas atoms dominate due to their exceptional stability. The concept was also successfully applied to explain the monodispersed occurrence of thiolate-protected gold clusters; here the outstanding stability of specific cluster sizes is connected with their respective electronic configuration. The term magic numbers is also used in the field of nuclear physics. In this context, magic numbers often represent three-dimensional figurate numbers such as the octahedral numbers: they count the numbers of spheres in sphere packings of Platonic solids and related polyhedra...

Ward's Anti-Suffrage stance, which lasted after many others had dropped their objections, would have been a major liability.

Plot At a medical instrument manufacturing company, timid engineering scientist Michio Hayasaki (K≈çji Yakusho) struggles to develop a robotic chair that could mobilise a clinically paralysed person. He realises he's not getting anywhere with it-- not while his company keeps making demands and issuing deadlines on him. Highly stressed, he bitterly realises he doesn't have the courage to bite back. Whilst arriving home from work, he's startled to find himself waiting on his doorstep. He soon sees it's not him, but a man who's the spitting image of him. Fearing he's having a mental breakdown, he wonders whether a legend that says one is destined to die soon after seeing own doppelganger may be true. His apparent twin (also K≈çji Yakusho) smoothly assures him that he has nothing to fear. He's a doppelganger. Bemused, Hayasaki invites him to his home. He eventually notices that while his doppelganger is identical to his looks, mannerisms and speech, the doppelganger's personality and attitude are drastically different from his own. Where he's too timid to get what he wants, his doppelganger has no qualms in getting what it wants. Where he's too afraid to speak out, his doppelganger speaks its mind. Where he's moderate with drinking, the doppelganger indulges heavily. Where he's detail-oriented, it doesn't pay much attention to details as it is more concerned with the end result. As his doppelganger removes all sources of Hayasaki's stress, reorganises his life for better, acquires all things he's yielded for, does rebellious things Hayasaki couldn't do, and assists with building the robotic chair that frustrates him for so long, Hayasaki learns to enjoy his doppelganger's seemingly nihilistic actions. He soon wonders whether his doppelganger has an agenda when he realises he's being dragged into madness.

Its first emergency mission was to Lesotho in 2003 and Sri Lanka in response to the Asian tsunami in December 2004. Since then it has sent teams to many emergencies all over the world including floods, earthquakes and hurricanes, and humanitarian situations such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria . MapAction works with a range of partners including United Nations agencies, International non-government organisations and the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. It also works with regional inter-state organisations such as the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency, the ASEAN Humanitarian Assistance Centre and the Centre for Emergency Situations and Disaster Risk Reduction. At the national level MapAction uses its experience of humanitarian mapping and information management to help disaster management agencies around the world put in place the data, technology and skills needed to be well-prepared for any type of large-scale emergency. MapAction has a small full-time staff, with most of its work delivered by skilled and trained volunteers. Its volunteers are skilled in geographical information systems, data management and software development and are trained to work in emergencies. As well as responding to emergencies, the volunteers also provide training to others.

It was built in 1911 with construction starting in mid-1909. For around 60 Years it was called Pudsey Grammar School, since then it has been Pudsey Grangefield School. It was later given the status of a specialist college of Maths and Computing. It serves around 1,185 pupils from the surrounding area along with two other Pudsey schools, Crawshaw and Priesthorpe. The school also runs the Pudsey Consortium sixth form with these two schools. History The school's lifelong logo is the official coat of arms of Pudsey, bearing the slogan \\"Be Just and Fear Not\\". The logo is built into the face of the original Grammar School Building; this Grade II listed building at the front of the old site has been converted into flats,with the rest of the site being demolished to allow construction of an open recreational area for the new building.

His career in cycling has frequent claims that he drugged riders to make them ride faster. Origins Warburton was born in Coal Hey, just off Lower Deardengate, in Haslingden, Lancashire, son of James Warburton and Harriet Birtwistle (a widow, her maiden name was Morris), the eldest of 12 children of which six survived. Although the property in which he was born still stands, its blue plaque does not commemorate Warburton. He was once licensee of the Fisher's Arms in Birley Street, Blackburn. Running career Warburton's potential as a runner was identified at 17 by John Duckworth, his employer at Hutch Bank cotton mill. Warburton competed as an amateur athlete between 1866 and 1879 before turning professional at 34. He won more than 500 first prizes, including 75 cups, visiting venues throughout the north of England, running races from one mile to more than 20, all while working full-time as a warehouseman. Warburton visited his brother George in the United States in 1880, entering several competitions and acquiring 80 cups and medals. Chris Aspin, of Haslingden history society, said: > Choppy came from Haslingden (where I live) and became a member of the local > athletic club, founded in 1868. He claimed to be a world-champion long > distance runner. He won more than 700 trophies, 511 before he turned > professional in 1880. As a boy he ran alongside steam trains on the local > line, and was spotted by a wealthy local sports lover, who made a match for > him.Private letter, November 2003 Cycle racing Warburton coached three cycling champions: Jimmy Michael and brothers Thomas Linton and Arthur Linton of Aberaman, in the Cynon Valley. Warburton's success has been questioned, with claims that he drugged his charges. Michael is said to have accused Warburton of poisoning him, before he was taken to court for libel. The writer Rudiger Rabenstein claims that Arthur Linton was \\"massively doped\\" for the 1896 Bordeaux‚ÄìParis.Oddy, Nicholas and van der Plas, Rob (ed) (1998), Cycle History There is in no proof that Linton was doped but his obituary \\"by one who knew him\\" said: > I saw him at Tours, halfway through the race, at midnight, where he came in > with glassy eyes and tottering limbs, and in a high state of nervous > excitement. I then heard him swear ‚Äì a very rare occurrence with him ‚Äì but > after a rest he was off again, though none of us expected he would go very > far.

According to the Lancashire Family History Society: The writer Simon Craig said: > Arthur Linton was not the only Warburton protege to die young, for Jimmy > Michael was only 28 at the time of his rather mysterious death in November > 1904. And there was also Arthur Linton's brother Tom, who died at the age of > 39 in 1914, the cause of death being given, coincidentally, as typhoid > fever.

Warburton appeared in a drawing of Michael by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, the French art nouveau artist, for a poster to advertise Michael's sponsor, the Simpson chain company. The National Museum of Wales bought one of the posters in the 1960s although it is not on display. Nickname Warburton is said to have gained the nickname Choppy from his father, a sailor who always responded with 'choppy', when asked what the weather had been on a voyage, although according to the United Kingdom census in 1871, his father was a power-loom weaver in a cotton mill.United Kingdom census 1871, Coal Hey, Haslingden Lancashire Death Warburton died of a heart attack in Wood Green, London in 1897.

Covilh√£. Playing career Born in Inhambane, Portuguese Mozambique, Faquir√° only played organised football in Portugal, with S.U. Sintrense, signing in 1983 still as a junior. His biggest achievement as a professional happened in the 1989‚Äì90 season as the team competed in the second division, eventually suffering relegation. Having always represented the same club, Faquir√° retired from football in June 1992, still not aged 27. Coaching career Faquir√° started his manager career with his last team, at only 28. In 1999 he signed for another club in the Lisbon area, Odivelas F.C. in the regional leagues, achieving two consecutive promotions and being relieved of his duties five games into the 2002‚Äì03 campaign (one win, four draws). Subsequently, Faquir√° worked with another side in the third division, F.C. Barreirense. After a second place in his first year he led the Set√∫bal District team to the national championship, and promotion. His first coaching experience in the second level happened in 2005 with G.D. Estoril Praia, but he found a club submerged in a deep economic crisis, eventually leaving in December of that year and being one of three managers during that season as they finished in mid-table. Faquir√° made his Primeira Liga debut in 2006‚Äì07 with fellow Lisbon side C.F. Estrela da Amadora, finishing in ninth position and being named Revelation Coach of the Year. In his second season, in spite of tremendous economic problems (up to five months delay in salaries), he managed to maintain the squad in its entirety and lead them to another safe finish (13th). Faquir√° joined Vit√≥ria F.C. for 2008‚Äì09, signing a two-year contract. On 14 January 2009, after a 1‚Äì2 home loss against Acad√©mica de Coimbra in the group stage of the League Cup ‚Äì the Set√∫bal-based team had also been defeated eight times in 14 matches in the league ‚Äì he was sacked. On 1 June 2010, after one year out of football, Faquir√° replaced Acad√©mica-bound Jorge Costa at the helm of S.C. Olhanense. He eventually led the Algarvians out of the relegation zone, but managed to rank as high as third after seven rounds, only behind eventual champions FC Porto. Faquir√° left Olhanense due to poor results on 30 December 2011, despite ranking tenth in the league. His resignation came one week after a loss in the Portuguese Cup against division two club U.D. Oliveirense. On 6 May 2013, Angola's C.D. Primeiro de Agosto announced Faquir√° as Romeu Filem√≥n's replacement after the latter's dismissal. In April of the following year, he was fired due to poor results. After a break of over five years, Faquir√° returned to managing in Portugal's second tier on 22 December 2019, taking over S.C. Covilh√£ until the end of the season. Having finished tenth as the campaign was curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic, he continued in the job. Personal life Faquir√° possessed two university degrees in Physical Education and Sports from the Technical University of Lisbon, with majors in ergonomics and football. In addition, he also achieved the fourth-level degree in the UEFA Pro Licence.

It also portrays her early relationship and marriage with Denis Thatcher. It is directed by Niall MacCormick, produced by Madonna Baptiste and written by Tony Saint - it was made by Great Meadows Productions. Thatcher is played by Andrea Riseborough, Denis by Rory Kinnear and Edward Heath by Samuel West. It was followed in February 2009 by Margaret, a drama on Thatcher's fall from power filmed in 2008-09, with Thatcher played by Lindsay Duncan. Production It was announced in August 2007, and filming began in London in the summer of 2007 (the black-and-white mock-newsreel footage of Roberts' electioneering in Dartford features the Church of Christ the King, and the terraced house from which she is picked up by Denis is the History Department of University College London). It was to have been aired in February 2008, but was postponed to avoid offence to its subject (a scream of \\"fucking establishment!\\" by the Thatcher character had already been cut from the drama at her supporters' request, and replaced with \\"Damn their establishment!\\"). Reception It was eventually broadcast at 9pm on Thursday 12 June 2008. Even prior to broadcast, the drama's portrayal of Thatcher as young and flirtatious has been criticised both by her supporters and opponents (one of the latter called the casting of Riseborough as \\"ludicrously flattering\\" to Thatcher). Reception of the drama after broadcast, however, was generally positive, with particular note taken of tongue-in-cheek references to future events (Margaret promises that, were she in charge, \\"every child in the country would have as much milk as they wanted\\", as against her later reputation as \\"milk-snatcher Thatcher\\"; and the Thatcher children make remarks related to their future notoriety for a Dakar Rally incident and an attempted African coup involving Mark Thatcher and appearance on \\"I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!\\" involving Carol Thatcher in a jungle respectively). Crowder also speaks the line \\"A grocer's daughter. A grocer, Heath?!?\\" to Heath in contempt of Margaret's background, making reference to Heath's later nickname of Grocer Heath. On 27 March 2009 The Long Walk to Finchley won 3 Broadcasting Press Guild Awards - Best Single Drama, Best Multichannel Programme and Best Actress (Andrea Riseborough) Plot Margaret Roberts gains a role as research chemist into ice cream and in her spare time pursues her political ambitions with her father's help and begins her relationship with Denis Thatcher. She is nominated the Conservative candidate for the constituency of Dartford in the run-up to the 1950 election, and is openly optimistic despite most other Conservatives' opinion that no Conservative can win the seat, let alone a woman. During the election campaign she meets Edward Heath, candidate for the key marginal seat of Bexley. He is suspicious of her populist and publicity-seeking style, but less overtly hostile to her than more reactionary figures in the party such as Waldron Smithers. Overall national party strategy is for Roberts to draw Labour attention away from Bexley and Chislehurst (also being fought by a woman, Patricia Hornsby-Smith) to enable these two key marginal seats to be won. This Margaret does, and Bexley and Chislehurst are duly won, but Margaret herself is beaten at Dartford by the Labour candidate (despite reducing his majority). Her relationship with Denis founders and she decides that she must improve her chances of finding a new and winnable seat. To this end she decides to leave science and study for the Bar. At a Conservative ball, Miss Hornsby-Smith engineers a meeting between Margaret and the shy and (it is implied) possibly homosexual Heath. Margaret flirts with him in an attempt to better her political career, and asks him a question which the audience does not hear (though they do hear Heath stating \\"we must never speak of this again\\"). Having failed to begin a relationship with Heath, she recommences her relationship with Denis and pre-empts and accepts his proposal of marriage. Her teetotal father accepts her choice, despite concerns over Denis's status as a non-teetotaller and a divorc√© and the marriage taking place in London not their home town of Grantham. She again fails to win Dartford at the 1951 election and writes to console Heath on the death of his mother, to whom he was close. Even on their honeymoon, Margaret is keen to take on a candidacy for the safe Conservative seat of Canterbury, but in the meantime, Heath convinces the Canterbury Conservative Association not to select her. Margaret finds herself pregnant but takes the Bar exam nevertheless, shortly afterward giving birth to twins. Happy that this provides her with an instant nuclear family for her political ends rather than expressing conventional maternal joy, Margaret then fails to win the candidacy for Smithers's seat of Orpington but is convinced out of a brief exit from the political world by Denis when her frustration at being cut off from that world soon becomes apparent. She tries and fails to gain a candidacy at Beckenham, Hemel Hempstead and Maidstone, up against old boy networks, prejudice against her due to being a woman, a mother and a grocer's daughter and the party's preference for male war veterans. Frustrated at the shattering of her dreams of a political career being meritocratic, Margaret is in despair. Denis, however, suggests that she does not play by the old-boys' rules but instead uses what they perceive as her weakness (being a woman) against them. Margaret takes up his suggestion, going blonde and‚Äîthrough a show of tears in an interview with Kaberry, chairman of candidates‚Äîreceiving information of a possible candidacy in Finchley. The seat has a safe Conservative majority but its present holder John Crowder is not managing that majority well and an alternative holder is being considered. Thatcher is shortlisted for the candidacy and, though the misogynistic Crowder tries to convince Heath (now Chief Whip) to oppose Thatcher, she retains Kaberry's support. She hopes Denis will accompany her to the selection panel, but goes ahead without him when he cannot return from Africa in time. She reaches the final two and on the way to this final hustings silences Crowder's open contempt for her and her chances by pouring scorn on his unremarkable political career. Her speech wins over even the woman in the audience whom Crowder had primed to oppose her and Margaret wins the candidacy. Crowder takes his complaints as to Margaret's takeover of the constituency to Heath, but Heath reveals that instead of warning the Finchley Conservatives off supporting Thatcher as Crowder had asked, he instead threatened them with dire penalties if they did not support her, partly in response to Crowder's slights against her working-class parentage (Heath's father was also working class). Crowder prophesies that, once into the House of Commons, Margaret will \\"never stop\\". Margaret then wins Finchley in the 1959 election and arrives at the House. There, Heath avoids and ignores her and has a flashback to the Conservative ball earlier in the drama‚Äîher question is revealed to have been a request to be helped by him into parliament, to return the favour for her helping him win Bexley. He is stung by her taking credit for his win at Bexley instead of simply taking up the \\"hand of friendship\\" he had been on the verge of offering her. The film then returns to 1959 and fades on Heath walking past her (breaking off ties with her and secretly tormented by Crowder's prophecy and his own forebodings of her future career) and Margaret's impassive, steely but ambiguous reaction to this. An onscreen message then refers to her beating him in the 1975 Conservative leadership election.

Following the World War II German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was partitioned. At the time, Loznica was part of the German- occupied territory of Serbia, which included Serbia proper, with the addition of the northern part of Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat. The Chetniks attacked, led by Lieutenant Colonel Veselin Misita, who was killed during the assault. The Germans surrendered and 93 were captured. This battle was closely followed by the joint Partisan-Chetnik attack on the German garrison at Banja Koviljaƒça. Background alt=a coloured map showing the partition of Yugoslavia In April 1941, Germany and its allies invaded and occupied the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which was then partitioned. Some Yugoslav territory was annexed by its Axis neighbours, Hungary, Bulgaria and Italy. The Germans engineered and supported the creation of the puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH), which roughly comprised most of the pre- war Banovina Croatia, along with rest of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and some adjacent territory. The Italians, Hungarians and Bulgarians occupied other parts of Yugoslavian territory. Germany did not annex any Yugoslav territory, but occupied northern parts of present-day Slovenia and stationed occupation troops in the northern half of the NDH. The German-occupied part of Slovenia was divided into two areas that were placed under the administration of the Gauleiters of the neighbouring Reichsgau K√§rnten and Reichsgau Steiermark. The remaining territory, which consisted of Serbia proper, the northern part of Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat was occupied by the Germans and placed under the administration of a German military government. This was due to the key rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it, and its valuable resources, particularly non- ferrous metals. In May, German troops of the 750th Infantry Regiment of the 704th Infantry Division were stationed in the Maƒçva, Jadra and Pocerina (Cer) districts of the Podrinje region, garrisoning ≈†abac, Banja Koviljaƒça and Loznica. In early July, shortly after the launching of Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union, armed resistance began in the German-occupied territory of Serbia, against both the German Army and the representatives of the German-installed puppet government known as the Commissioner Government. This was a response to appeals from both Joseph Stalin and the Communist International for communist organisations across occupied Europe to draw German troops away from the Eastern Front, and followed a meeting of the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party in Belgrade on 4 July. This meeting resolved to shift to a general uprising, form Partisan detachments of fighters and commence armed resistance, and call for the populace to rise up against the occupiers throughout Yugoslavia. This also coincided with the departure of the last of the German invasion force that had remained to oversee the transition to occupation. From the appearance of posters and pamphlets urging the population to undertake sabotage, it rapidly turned to attempted and actual sabotage of German propaganda facilities and railway and telephone lines. The first fighting occurred at the village of Bela Crkva on 7 July, when gendarmes tried to disperse a public meeting, and two gendarmes were killed. Prelude In the Podrinje region, encompassing the Drina basin, a Partisan district committee had been formed on 29 June, to oversee the local uprising and form Partisan detachments. After collecting weapons and ammunition, the detachment's first action was to attack the gendarmerie station in Bogatiƒá on 7 August, disarming the gendarmes and capturing more weapons. Due to the scope of the local uprising, on 9 August the detachment was renamed the Podrinje Partisan Detachment. They disarmed the re-equipped gendarme platoon at Bogatiƒá on 10 August, and then carried out the destruction of town archives, telephone lines and bridges in the district. By 14 August, the detachment's ranks had swelled to about 360 fighters in six companies, the occupation forces and local collaborators were finding it difficult to use the road from the district centre ≈†abac to Loznica due to Partisan ambushes, and the railway line between the two towns was out of action. alt=a colour image of an old religious building The first royalist Chetnik units were mobilised by order of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá in August 1941. In late July, Mihailoviƒá had sent a regular officer, Lieutenant Colonel Veselin Misita to the Jadar district as his emissary. Misita had established himself at the Trono≈°a Monastery near Loznica. The abbot of the monastery was Georgije Bojiƒá, who was also a captain in the Royal Yugoslav Army reserves. In August, Misita and Bojiƒá held a meeting with pro-Chetnik people from the Jadar district to set up the Jadar Chetnik Detachment. Other key attendees included Nikola Gordiƒá and Mika Komarƒçeviƒá. On 15 August, the 25-strong Cer Chetnik Detachment was formed under the command of a regular artillery officer, Captain First Class Dragoslav Raƒçiƒá. Due to Mihailoviƒá's position that the Chetniks should prepare for an uprising, but not engage in fighting the occupiers until the time was right, some Chetniks left the Jadar detachment and joined the more aggressive Raƒçiƒá or the Partisans. Raƒçiƒá signed a mutual cooperation agreement against the occupation forces with the commander of the Podrinje Partisans, Neboj≈°a Jerkoviƒá. Due to its lack of action against the Germans and puppet government, the Jadar Chetnik Detachment became quite isolated. Their leadership realised that the Partisans were getting stronger with each success against the occupiers, and the Chetnik position was becoming relatively weaker due to their inaction. Misita's decision to attack Loznica was a consequence of the cooperation agreement Raƒçiƒá signed with the Partisans. Battle alt=a colour photograph of an imposing yellow two storey building At the time of the attack on Loznica, the Jadar Chetnik Detachment consisted of a large number of poorly organised peasants, drawn mainly from the villages around the town. The Germans had established strongpoints in the gymnasium, Vuk Karad≈æiƒá Cultural Centre, and the \\"Laze Hajdukoviƒá\\" cafe. The attack commenced at 07:00, with Misita in the vanguard. He was killed at the head of his troops while throwing hand grenades at German positions. Many of the Germans surrendered in the face of the Chetnik assault. During the battle, Misita's Chetniks suffered 18 killed and four wounded, while the Germans incurred several killed and wounded and 93 captured. The remaining Germans fled in the direction of Banja Koviljaƒça. The wounded Germans were taken to hospital, and the rest of the captured troops were escorted to the monastery, and treated humanely. At the same time as the Jadar Chetniks were attacking Loznica, Raƒçiƒá's Cer detachment attacked the village of Bogatiƒá in accordance with the Chetnik-Partisan agreement. The gendarmes had been reinforced by the 6th Company of the German 750th Infantry Regiment with artillery support. On the second day of the attack, the garrison was reinforced by the 7th Company of the 750th Infantry Regiment arriving from Sremska Mitrovica, and an additional platoon sent from ≈†abac. After two days fighting, Raƒçiƒá's Chetniks withdrew to Cer mountain with considerable losses, after which they marched to Loznica to join the Jadar Chetniks. Aftermath and legacy Following its capture, the Chetniks established a command post in the town and mobilised the populace. Supporters of the Partisans formed a local unit and directed workers into the fields and a nearby mine. The Partisans also set up a workshop in the town to manufacture hand grenades. After their failed attack on Bogatiƒá, the two Chetnik detachments decided to attack Banja Koviljaƒça. Launched on 1 September, this attack was initially unsuccessful. After being reinforced by the Podrinje Partisans, the town was captured in the early hours of 6 September. In the meantime, other elements of the Podrinje Partisan Detachment had expelled the German garrison and collaborationist gendarmes from Bogatiƒá on 3 September. On 6 October 1941, Loznica was re-occupied during the German Maƒçva operation. Josip Broz Tito's biographer Vladimir Dedijer described Misita's death as a great loss for the uprising. On 31 August 2008, the deputy speaker of the Serbian National Assembly, Bo≈æidar Deliƒá of the Serbian Radical Party, dedicated a plaque to Misita in the Vuk Karad≈æiƒá Square in Loznica. One of the people present was the man that had applied for the plaque to be installed, Bo≈æidar Paniƒá, who had idolised Misita in his youth, and had lit a candle for him every year.

It lies just within the boundaries of the London Borough of Camden, but is particularly associated with the Italian community of Clerkenwell (whose hub lies within the London Borough of Islington). History The church was built at the request of Saint Vincent Pallotti, and remains under the control of the Pallottines, the religious society which he founded. He had assistance from the politician and activist Giuseppe Mazzini, who was in London at the time.Italian London BBC London, 02/07/2008, 12:25UK (Accessed 27/08/2008) It was intended for the use of the growing number of Italian immigrants in London in the mid-19th century, and was modelled by Irish architect Sir John Miller-Bryson on the Basilica San Crisogono in Rome. It was consecrated on 16 April 1863 as \\"The Church of St Peter of all Nations\\". At the time of consecration, it was the only basilica- style church in the UK. Its organ was built in 1886 by Belgian Anneesen. During World War II, when Italian immigrants were interned, Irish Pallottines made use of the church. In 1953 it was returned to Italian control, since when it has been substantially remodelled, most notably in 1996. The church has been the main gathering and reunion venue for the \\"Little Italy\\" community of Clerkenwell, and is a central feature of the annual processione held in mid- July.Photos of the 2019 \\"Processione\\" Architecture The frontal section of the church consists of a loggia and portico with twin arches, above which are three alcoves. The central alcove contains a statue of Christ, whilst the sides contain statues of St Bede and St George. Between the alcoves are two large mosaics depicting the miracle of the fishes and Jesus giving the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven to St Peter. Photos of the church Memorial to the dead of the Arandora Star In the loggia are two wall memorials: one, installed in 1927, to veterans (mostly Italian Britons) of World War I; and the other, installed in 1960, to 446 Italians who lost their lives on the SS Arandora Star in 1940. Above the fa√ßade is a 33-metre-high bell tower, built in 1891, which houses a bell known as \\"The Steel Monster\\".

Shanahan made his first appearance for the Tipperary team during the 1946 championship and became a regular member of the team over the next decade. During that time he won three All-Ireland winners' medals, three Munster winners' medals and three National League winners' medals. In 1955 and 1956 Shanahan played with the Dublin senior team, however, he returned to Tipperary before his retirement from the inter-county scene after the 1957 championship. At club level Shanahan is a county championship winners' medalist with the Toomevara club in Tipperary. He also played with the Young Irelands club in Dublin. Playing career Club Shanahan showed early promise making his debut at senior level with Toomevara in the 1945 championship, while still only seventeen years of age. The club were back in the senior ranks for the first time since 1938, when they failed to field a team in the first round of the senior championship. In 1946 Shanahan won his first divisional medal when Toomevara defeated Roscrea in the north final, their first such victory since 1931. A move to Dublin in 1950 saw him join the Young Irelands club, however, he enjoyed little success with the Dublin club before moving back to Tipperary in the late fifties. Shanahan played in seven consecutive North Tipperary finals from 1957 to 1963, winning four in 1958, 1960, 1961 and 1962. He captained the team in 1958. There were also three county final appearances, with defeats in 1958 and 1961, and a great victory over Thurles Sarsfields in 1960, a victory that prevented the Thurles club winning six in-a-row. Shanahan eventually retired from club hurling in 1966 after a career of twenty years. Inter-county Shanahan made his inter-county debut with the Tipperary minor hurling team in 1946. In the Munster final against Cork he collected a mis-hit seventy-yard free near the end of the game to score the winning goal and win the match by just a single point. Galway were well-beaten in the All- Ireland semi-final but the final was lost to Dublin in the infamous Billy O'Brien goalmouth incident. In the last few minutes the Dublin forwards succeeded in getting the ball over the goal line for a goal, which was only awarded after a three-minute consultation between the referee M. J. Flaherty and the umpires. Both umpires claimed that the goalie, Billy O'Brien, had been fouled before the goal was scored but the referee didn't see the foul and allowed the goal. Dublin won by 1‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì7. Shanahan's first entry into the senior ranks was when he was selected at midfield for Tipperary's 1948‚Äì49 National League campaign. Tipperary qualified for the final against Cork and won by 3‚Äì5 to 3‚Äì3. It was their first victory in the competition since 1928. Shanahan enjoyed further success later that year when Tipp defeated Limerick by 1‚Äì16 to 2‚Äì10 to take the Munster title. He subsequently lined out in his first All-Ireland final at senior level. Surprisingly, Laois were the opponents on that occasion, however, the result was expected. Tipp opened the floodgates with a Paddy Kenny goal before Jimmy Kennedy added two more goals in the second-half. At the full-time whistle Tipp were the victors by 3‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì3 and Shanahan had captured an All-Ireland winners' medal. He finished off the year by winning his first Oireachtas title. In spite of a move to Dublin 1950, Shanahan added a second National League winners' medal to his collection before further provincial glory followed. A 2‚Äì17 to 3‚Äì11 defeat of Cork gave him a second consecutive Munster medal and an easy passage into another All- Ireland final. Kilkenny provided the opposition on that occasion in a close but uninteresting game. At the final whistle Tipp emerged the victors by 1‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì8 giving Shanahan a second All-Ireland medal. In 1951 Shanhan captured a third successive Munster title following a 2‚Äì11 to 2‚Äì9 defeat of arch-rivals Cork. This victory resulted in Tipp being installed as the favourites for a third consecutive All-Ireland title. Wexford, however, stood in Tipp's way after making a long-awaited breakthrough in Leinster. Nicky Rackard had been Wexford's star goal-poacher throughout the year, however, his artistry was beaten by Tony Reddin in the Tipperary goal-mouth. S√©amus Bannon, Tim Ryan and Paddy Kenny got the goals in the second quarter that did the damage, however, Tipp forged ahead to win by 7‚Äì7 to 3‚Äì9. For the next two years Tipperary were defeated by Cork in the Munster championship. It wasn't the end of his playing days, however, as he captured a third National League title in 1952. Since Shanahan was now based in Dublin, he decided to line out for the Dubs in 1954. His two seasons at midfield resulted in Dublin being beaten by Wexford in the 1954 Leinster final and by Kilkenny in the 1955 Leinster semi-final. In 1956 Shanahan lined out with Tipperary once again. He won a fourth National League medal as a non-playing substitute in 1957, however, Tipperary lost out to in the semi-final of the provincial championship. He retired from inter-county hurling following a tour to the United States at the end of the year. Coaching career With his playing days over Shanahan turned his attention to training and coaching. His training career began with Portlaoise, where he helped the club to five championship football titles between 1966 and 1971. He attained a coaching certificate in hurling in 1977. When he retired from Esso in 1982 he trained and coached Killenaule to win three South Tipperary intermediate championships in hurling in 1983, 1985 and 1986. Personal life Born in Toomevara, County Tipperary, Phil initially worked on the family farm. In 1950 he moved to Dublin where he found work with the Johnston Mooney and O'Brien bakery in Sundrive Road After six years here he moved to Clonmel where he worked with Esso Teoranta. Phil married Joan Power in 1958 and the couple had three sons, Phil, David and Brian. In his final years Shanahan's health deteriorated and he underwent open-heart surgery in 2008. He died on 5 February 2012.

The seminary is a fully accredited member of the Association of Theological Schools of the United States and Canada. St. Peter's Seminary is the major seminary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of London in Ontario. It is affiliated with King's University College, a Catholic affiliate of The University of Western Ontario. The current rector of St. Peter's Seminary is Stevan Wlusek. St. Peter‚Äôs Seminary is Canada's oldest English-speaking Roman Catholic diocesan seminary. Since it was founded by the Diocese of London in 1912, the seminary has produced more than 1,000 priests (including 23 who became bishops) and has educated permanent deacons and lay graduates. History Seminary building c. 2012  Founding  Gates of St. Peter's Seminary c. 2012St. Peter's seminary was founded by the Right Reverend Michael F. Fallon, OMI, who was the bishop of London at the time. The seminary opened its doors on September 15, 1912. The students were initially housed and taught in the Bishop's Residence, which later became the rectory of St. Peter's Cathedral Basilica. However, this building is no longer present. The 25-acre riverside site on which the Seminary stands was donated by Sir Philip Pocock, from a prominent London Catholic family. The Seminary is constructed of Credit Valley stone, and is designed in the Collegiate Gothic style. The cornerstone of the present building was laid by Bishop Fallon on May 31, 1925, and the official opening of the St. Peter's Seminary building was celebrated on September 29, 1926. The main entrance rotunda features a marble statue of St. Michael the archangel, carved in Rome and presented from Bishop Fallon upon the Seminary‚Äôs opening.  Expansion  The Chapel of St. Thomas Aquinas was dedicated on June 18, 1930. A new wing was added to the building in 1957, which houses the auditorium, library and recreational facilities. In 1968 the chapel was renovated. The seminary interior was renovated in 1970. In 1983 the library was doubled in size, and the main floor of the building renovated. In 1987 St. Peter's Seminary purchased the St. Thomas Scholasticate, the former house of formation for students of the Congregation of the Resurrection. The renovated and newly named Aquinas House was opened on the 27 October 1991 and housed transitional deacons in the formation program. Aquinas House currently houses workshops in formation, summer institutes, retreats and other programs for ministry.  Renovation  Bishop Ronald Fabbro, CSB, Bishop of London, announced that St. Peter's Seminary would undergo a full modernization and restoration in 2015. The renovations were to upgrade the interior, including 60 seminarian rooms, as well as new faculty suites, offices, classrooms, and common spaces. In addition, the exterior stonewalls and slate roof were restored, and modern heating and cooling systems were installed. The $30-million renovation was funded by a $23-million contribution from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hamilton, and $7 million of revenue generated from the seminary's land sale to King's University College.

The alliteration in the term is a clear homage to the Busby Babes, the famously youthful Manchester United team assembled by the club's former manager Sir Matt Busby and his assistant coach Jimmy Murphy during the 1950s. The late 1980s Fledglings The term \\"Fergie's Fledglings\\" was first coined by the media in the 1988‚Äì89 season to describe a group of young footballers who were introduced into the Manchester United first team by the manager Alex Ferguson. The group included players from the team which reached the final of the 1986 FA Youth Cup such as Lee Martin, Tony Gill and David Wilson, and other youth team players such as Russell Beardsmore, Mark Robins and Deiniol Graham as well as young players bought from other clubs such as Lee Sharpe (Torquay United) and Giuliano Maiorana (Histon). There was some initial success for the Fledglings; in only his second start, Beardsmore inspired the team to a 3‚Äì1 win over rivals Liverpool, and an injury crisis saw Gill, Graham and Wilson drafted into the first team for an FA Cup third round replay against Queens Park Rangers in which both Gill and Graham scored. However, serious injuries and loss of form meant that most of these players did not build on their initial success and the term \\"Fergie's Fledglings\\" had fallen out of use by the following season. Beardsmore and Robins made over 50 appearances each for Manchester United but were unable to hold down places in the first team. However, Robins did score a winning goal against Nottingham Forest in the Third Round of the 1990 FA Cup. That goal is popularly believed to have saved Ferguson's job at United, as they were struggling in the league at this stage and Ferguson had entered his fourth year as the club's manager having still yet to win a major trophy. Of the original batch of Fledglings, only Martin and Sharpe made more than 100 appearances for Manchester United, making important contributions towards two of Ferguson's first trophies ‚Äì the FA Cup in 1990 and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1991, although Robins was also involved in both of these successes. Martin scored the winning goal in the 1990 FA Cup final replay against Crystal Palace. However, Sharpe was the only one of this group of players left at the club by the end of the 1993‚Äì94 season, and by the time he was sold to Leeds United in August 1996, he had played in three title-winning teams, two FA Cup- winning teams, and also won both a Cup Winners' Cup, a Football League Cup and three FA Community Shields, and he was voted PFA Young Player of the Year in 1991. Mark Robins was the only member of the original batch of fledglings to enjoy any major success with other clubs. After being sold to Norwich City in 1992, he scored 15 goals as his new club finished third in the new Premier League, and also achieved promotion and a Football League Cup triumph with his next club Leicester City. The 1990s Fledglings George Switzer, Ben Thornley and Gary Neville A second wave of young players emerged at Manchester United in the early to mid-1990s. This group proved worthier than the previous generation in comparisons with the Busby Babes in terms of the success they achieved as relatively young footballers. Each one was developed by Manchester United from a very early age, some signing schoolboy forms with the club at the age of just 14. Many of these players were part of the Manchester United team that won the 1992 FA Youth Cup, including future United regulars David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville. Also generally considered in this group are players such as Paul Scholes, an FA Youth Cup finalist in 1993 and Phil Neville ‚Äì Gary's younger brother ‚Äì who was a substitute in the 1993 FA Youth Cup Final and captained the team to the 1995 FA Youth Cup. The six players have since been collectively referred to as the \\"Class of '92\\", a term popularised by the namesake 2013 documentary focusing on their careers with the club. The term \\"Fergie's Fledglings\\" came back into common usage during the 1995‚Äì96 season, after Ferguson largely used this second group of youngsters coming through to replace a number of distinguished older players who had left the club. Following a 3‚Äì1 opening day away defeat to Aston Villa, pundit Alan Hansen commented on Match of the Day \\"You'll never win anything with kids\\". The young side, with an average age of just 24, then went on to overturn Newcastle United's 10-point Christmas lead to win the club's third league title in four years. This was followed up by a 1‚Äì0 win over Liverpool in the 1996 FA Cup Final to secure the Double. A period of great success followed, the most outstanding triumph being The Treble in 1999. Many of the so-called \\"Class of '92\\" became regulars for both club and country during this time. David Beckham, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville moved on in 2003 (to Real Madrid), 2004 (to Newcastle United) and 2005 (to Everton) respectively, with Beckham also captaining England from 2000 to 2006. All three have since retired, with Butt returning to United as member of the coaching staff. Gary Neville remained at United for the rest of his career and held the post of team captain following the departure of Roy Keane in 2005, before injuries considerably reduced his appearances, prompting his retirement in February 2011. Upon the announcement, Sir Alex Ferguson described Neville as \\"the greatest English right-back of his generation\\". Among defenders, only Bill Foulkes made more appearances for the club than Neville. Neville received a testimonial match in 2011, also attended by five other \\"Fergie Fledglings\\": Beckham, Giggs, Scholes, Butt, and Phil Neville. Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes both played their entire Premier League careers for Manchester United. Scholes announced his retirement at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season, remaining at the club as a youth coach, but made a return to playing duties in January 2012 after several United midfielders were brought down by injury before retiring again at the conclusion of the 2012‚Äì13 season. Giggs has now won more trophies than any other player in football history. Coming on as a substitute in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final, he became the club's all-time appearance record holder, surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton, the longest-serving of the Busby Babes. After briefly serving as player-manager at the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season, Giggs went on to hold the post of assistant manager at the club, but left in the summer of 2016. Beckham, Scholes, Butt and Gary Neville returned to play for Manchester United in a friendly match at the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season to mark the 20th anniversary of the Treble campaign in 1999. Beckham and Butt both scored as Manchester United won 5‚Äì0 at Old Trafford on 26 May 2019.

Kept in the Dark is a novel by the 19th-century English novelist Anthony Trollope. One of his lesser and later works, it nonetheless has interest. It was published in eight monthly installments in Good Words in 1882, and also in book form in the same year. Plot  Cecilia Holt ends her engagement to Sir Francis Geraldine because of his indifference to her; she goes abroad and meets Mr. George Western, who has been jilted by a beautiful girl. They marry, but she does not tell him she has been previously engaged, though he has told her his story. When Western is informed of the previous engagement by Sir Francis, he leaves his wife and goes abroad; Cecilia returns to Exeter to live with her mother. Her sister-in-law in the end effects a reconciliation. There is a comic sub-plot, often found in Trollope's work, involving one of Cecilia's friends who attempts to marry Sir Francis. The novel is principally about duty and truth in marriage, and the relationship of a couple to society. Reaction The novel received mediocre reviews.

Ranging from grades 9‚Äì12, students are from the city of Lebanon and the towns of Grantham and Plainfield. The mascot for the LHS Raiders is commonly called the \\"Raider Bird.\\"  History  In the early 1950s, SAU 88 decided to build a new high school for all students in Lebanon. Prior to this decision, students in Lebanon attended high school at what was later the junior high school and is now a luxury apartment building, while West Lebanon high schoolers went to Seminary Hill School in that village. In 195- the high school was completed, and in 195- the first class was graduated. Over the next 20 years, 9th graders in the district would attend the junior high school instead of the high school. In 197- this changed as the first true freshman class entered the school. LHS's first mascot was the Agamek Indian. After complaints in 2001, however, this mascot was replaced with a Raider. After three years, the new mascot was again changed to today's raider bird, fondly referred to as a \\"fawk\\" (from \\"falcon hawk\\"). The LHS Alumni Association still uses the Agamek as its mascot. Curriculum and academics Lebanon offers a variety of classes including Honors and AP courses for all grades. A class unique to Lebanon is \\"Teen Roles\\". This class is designed as a health class, but includes topics such as team building, CPR lessons, and how to respond and react to different high school issues. As part of the class, the students use an outdoor ropes course in which they learn about trust, support, and dependence on one another. It is also an opportunity to experience new things. Activities include being attached to a bungee cord that supports a student's weight and jumping from a ledge in a tree 10 feet out to a hanging bar. Besides Hanover High School, Lebanon is the only school in New Hampshire with a full outdoor ropes course. Rival Lebanon's long-time rival is Hanover High School, in the neighboring town. Athletics Lebanon is well known for their flourishing indoor and outdoor track teams, coached by alum Kevin Lozeau. During the 2010-2011 indoor track season, Lebanon girls won the Class I, M, & S track state championships, and the boys came in fifth. In 2010 the Lebanon varsity football team went undefeated for its first time ever since they left the CVL(Connecticut Valley League) and won the Division IV State Championship. During the 2010 season, the girls varsity soccer team won the state championships, and in 2011 the boys were the runners-up. Lebanon girls basketball, coached by teacher Tim Kehoe, has a longstanding history of excellence making it to at least the quarterfinals in the state playoffs for the last 30+ years. In the last several years, they won the state championship in 2007 and finished off an undefeated season in 2012/13 by defeating Portsmouth in the finals. And both the 2009‚Äì2010 and 2010‚Äì2011 seasons ended with losses in the state championship game. The Lebanon boys basketball team also has a long record of success. Coached for years by legendary coach Lang Metcalf, current coach Keith Matte took the Raiders to the state semi-finals in 2012/13 where they lost to Souhegan High School. Lebanon boys basketball went to the Final Four in the state for five straight years, 2012-2016, with one undefeated regular season and one state championship.

Bulla finished fifth overall and won two stages at the 1935 Vuelta a Espa√±a. He was born in Vienna and died in Pitten. When Bulla won the second stage of the 1931 Tour de France and took the yellow jersey, the cyclists in the Tour de France were divided into national teams and touriste-routiers. The best cyclists were in the national teams, and the semi-amateurs were touriste-routiers. Bulla was a touriste-routier. In that second stage, the touriste-routiers started 10 minutes later than the national teams. Still, Bulla overtook the national teams, won the stage and took the lead, the only time in history that a touriste-routier was leading the Tour de France.

Thetis was built in 1881 at Dundee, Scotland, by Alexander Stephen & Sons. She was acquired by the U.S. Navy on 2 February 1884 to be employed by the expedition to relieve the polar exploration party under the command of Lt. Adolphus W. Greely. She sailed from Dundee under the command of Lt. L. L. Reamey and arrived in New York on 23 March 1884. Rescue The six survivors of the U.S. Army's Greely Arctic expedition with their U.S. Navy rescuers, at Upernavik, Greenland, 2‚Äì3 July 1884. Probably photographed on board Thetis. After more than a month of preparations, Thetis‚Äînow under the command of Commander Winfield Scott Schley, who also headed the relief squadron‚Äîdeparted New York on 1 May. Ice flows and heavy weather hampered the search all along the way. Thetis did not even reach Upernavik, Greenland, her jumping-off point, until the latter part of the month. She departed that port on the 29th in company with and headed north. Along the way, she made stops at the Duck Islands, Cape York, and Littleton Island, arriving at the latter on 21 June. At Littleton Island, her search parties found evidence that Lt. Greely's expedition had stopped there but moved on. They were on the right track. The next day, she moved on to Payer's Harbor and landed search parties on Brevoort Island. More evidence that Greely's party had passed that way also indicated the dire straits in which the expedition found itself. Later that day, the two ships rounded Cape Sabine and, while fighting a howling gale, found Lt. Greely and six companions-alive, but weak from exposure and malnutrition. The other 20 members of the expedition had perished. The following day, the two ships headed south with their precious cargo. After stops at Upernavik, Godhavn, and St. John's, the relief expedition arrived in Portsmouth, N.H., on 1 August. During the five- day stay, rescuers and rescued alike received a tumultuous welcome by the assembled North Atlantic Squadron and enjoyed a warm reception given by the people of Portsmouth. On 6 August, the rescue ships continued south toward New York where they arrived on the 8th. On 20 November 1884, Thetis was placed out of commission and was laid up at New York. Pacific service After more than two years of inactivity, Thetis was recommissioned at New York on 15 January 1887, Lt. William H. Emory, Jr., in command. Between mid January and mid March, the ship was fitted out as a gunboat and prepared for a cruise around Cape Horn to the west coast. She departed New York on 24 March and began an eight-month voyage during which she stopped at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Montevideo, Uruguay; Valpara√≠so, Chile; and Callao, Peru. On 13 October, Thetis sailed into San Francisco for voyage repairs prior to a brief cruise to Alaskan waters. She departed the Mare Island Navy Yard on 16 November and arrived at Sitka, Alaska, on 4 December. She returned to Mare Island on 9 January 1888 and remained there until 8 April when she embarked upon an extended cruise in Alaskan waters. She returned to Sitka on 18 May and, for the next five months, conducted survey work as far north as Point Barrow, visiting Unalaska, St. Michael, East Cape, and Cape Sabine. On 1 November, she headed south from Sitka and entered San Francisco Bay on the 25th. She spent the following five months at the Mare Island Navy Yard, undergoing repairs and preparing for another Alaska survey assignment. Thetis steamed out from the Golden Gate on 20 April and shaped a course north to Sitka, where she arrived on 2 June. Another five months of survey work along the Alaskan coast followed, punctuated again with visits to Unalaska and Point Barrow. She returned to San Francisco on 7 December. Thetis remained at the Mare Island Navy Yard until July 1890, when she sailed for Central America. A revolution had recently broken out in San Salvador, and the insurgents quickly seized power. However, forces of the old government retired to Guatemala which they used as a base for counter-revolutionary operations. This precipitated war between the two countries. By 27 July, Thetis was at San Jos√©, Guatemala, beginning a four-month cruise along the coasts of Guatemala and San Salvador to protect American lives and property during the war. During that period, she called several times at La Libertad and Acajulta in San Salvador and at La Union and Amapala, Honduras, in addition to San Jos√©, Guatemala. By October, conditions in Central America had quieted sufficiently to allow Thetis to return to San Francisco, where she arrived on the 27th. Two days later, she reentered the Mare Island Navy Yard and remained there until the following June At mid-month, she departed San Francisco on a four-month assignment in Alaskan waters conducting survey work and patrolling to protect fur seals from poachers. She returned south to San Francisco late in 1891 and remained until the beginning of 1892. In the late spring, she made a brief voyage to the Hawaiian Islands, returning to San Francisco on 18 June. In January 1893, Thetis began survey work along the coast of the Baja California peninsula. For the next four years, she conducted those operations in waters between Magdalena Bay and the southern tip of the California peninsula. She returned periodically to San Diego and San Francisco for repairs and supplies. She concluded that duty in the spring of 1897 and arrived back in San Francisco on 24 April. In July 1897, the ship was placed \\"in ordinary\\" at Mare Island. Although the information above states that Thetis was equipped with one howitzer, a Hotchkiss Revolving Cannon (mislabeled as a \\"55mm\\") is on display at Mare Island with an inscription indicating that it came from Thetis. Revenue Cutter Service Thetis never again served the Navy. In the spring of 1899, she was transferred temporarily to the United States Revenue Cutter Service for special duty transporting Siberian reindeer to Alaska. This project was instituted through the cooperation of the Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Department of the Interior in an attempt to help Alaskan Natives to learn to herd the animals for food rather than to rely upon hunting for food. Between June and October 1899, she transported 81 reindeer from Siberia to Alaska. In October 1899, she was returned to the Navy briefly but was soon transferred back to the Revenue Cutter Service permanently. As a commissioned revenue cutter in the Revenue Cutter Service, she spent the next 16 years cruising Alaskan waters on law-enforcement duties and carrying supplies to the frontier fringes. During that time, she was based both at Port Townsend, Washington and San Francisco, California. In the spring of 1904, she made a voyage to the Hawaiian Islands to transport illegal Japanese immigrants from Lisianski Island to Honolulu. In 1908, she rescued 11 members of the crew of the Japanese sealing schooner Satsuma Maru who had been stranded at Point Manby () on the south-central coast of Alaska below the Malaspina Glacier since their ship's anchor cable had broken during a gale and she had been driven ashore and wrecked there on 5 November 1907.alaskashipwreck.com Alaska Shipwrecks (S) Late in 1909, she returned to Honolulu. From then until the end of her career, she alternated duty in the Hawaiian Islands with annual cruises to Alaskan waters. The Biological Survey of the United States Department of Agriculture sponsored Thetis on an expedition to the Leeward group of the Hawaiian Islands in 1912-13. On 27 April 1916, Thetis ended her last voyage in United States Government service at San Francisco. On 30 April 1916, she was placed out of commission. On 3 June 1916, she was sold to W. & S. Job & Co. of New York City. Ironically after years of service on the patrol against seal poachers in the Pacific, she was converted into a sealer herself and operated out of Newfoundland for the next 44 years. In 1960, her hulk was purposely grounded off St. John's, Newfoundland, and she remained there until she broke up. References * *Speir, Dean.

Career Fletcher was discovered by Al Lovelock, who wrestled as The Great Bolo. Lovelock trained Fletcher as a wrestler, and Fletcher made his wrestling debut in 1968. He wrestled as a tag team with Haystacks Calhoun, who also weighed over 600 pounds. Their combined weight was over 1200 pounds in the ring. Mike was wrestling with \\"Iron\\" Mike DiBiase on July 2, 1969 in Lubbock, Texas, when DiBiase suffered a fatal heart attack in the ring during the match. DiBiase was pronounced dead at the hospital. DiBiase's death was not related to professional wrestling; he died as a result of high cholesterol. Mike later wrestled in British Columbia, where he had a series of matches against Don Leo Jonathan in 1970 and 1971. Mike wrestled for Championship Wrestling from Florida in the early 1970s. He participated in many battles royal and, because of his size, was difficult for opponents to throw over the top rope and eliminate. As a result, the promotion billed him as \\"the acknowledged king of battles royal\\" and promoted many of these matches as \\"featuring Man Mountain Mike\\". On one occasion in 1972, his participation led to a feud with Buddy Colt, as Colt caused Mike to be eliminated from a battle royal. While competing for NWA Hollywood Wrestling, Mike won the NWA Americas Tag Team Championship with tag team partner Butcher Brannigan on August 31, 1974 at the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles, California. At that time, Brannigan was feuding with Porkchop Cash, Cash teamed up with Victor Rivera to face the champions, who dropped the title belts to the challengers. Man Mountain Mike toured Japan as a wrestler in 1975. He had a series of matches against Antonio Inoki. Mike was unable to defeat Inoki in singles matches or in tag team competitions. He later wrestled for the World Wide Wrestling Federation. He competed in both singles and tag team matches, which included teaming with Crusher Blackwell on February 20, 1976 in a loss to WWWF Tag Team Champions Louis Cerdan and Tony Parisi. Retirement and death After retiring from the ring in 1977, Mike opened Man Mountain Mike's Drycleaners, as well as a taxi service; he also drove a school bus. While working as a bus driver in 1988, because he was a large man, he had to put his seat all the way back, but that day, he banged the back of his leg on the seat track and his leg was cut open. Along with diabetes stemming from his size, he developed a staph infection in the cut on his leg, causing blood clots, which killed him on April 30 at the age of 47. The ring name Man Mountain Mike was later used in the Canadian Maritimes by Mike Shaw, who also competed for the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling as Bastion Booger and Norman the Lunatic, respectively.

It is the most immunodominant KSHV protein identified by Western-blotting as 222‚Äì234 kDa double bands migrate slower than the predicted molecular weight. LANA has been suspected of playing a crucial role in modulating viral and cellular gene expression. It is commonly used as an antigen in blood tests to detect antibodies in persons that have been exposed to KSHV. KSHV or Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) has been identified as the etiological agent of Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma (KS) and certain AIDS-associated lymphomas. As KSHV establishes latent infection in tumorous foci, it invariably expresses high levels of the viral LANA protein, which is necessary and sufficient to maintain the KSHV episome. Encoded by ORF73, LANA-1 is one of few HHV-8 encoded proteins that is highly expressed in all latently infected tumour cells; specifically, it is a phosphoprotein with an acidic internal repeat domain flanked by a carboxy-terminal domain and an amino- terminal domain. LANA-1 acts as a transcriptional regulator, and it has been implicated directly in oncogenesis because of its ability to bind to the tumour-suppressing protein p53 and to the retinoblastoma protein pRb. This leads to the inactivation of p53-dependent promoters and induction of E2F-dependent genes. Studies have also shown that LANA-1 can transactivate the promoter of the reverse transcriptase subunit of the human telomerase holoenzyme, thus overextending a critical step in cellular transformation. Paradoxically, LANA-1 has been shown to be involved in transcriptional repression and can, moreover, interact with the mSin3/HDAC1 co-repressor complex. It has been also shown to interact with and inhibit the ATF4/CREB2 transcription factor that interacts with the basic transcription machinery and to bind with two human chromosome-associated cellular proteins, MeCP2 and DEK. LANA-1 is associated with cellular chromatin and stays on the chromosomes during cell division. It maintains the viral genomes during cell division by tethering the viral episomes to the chromosomes. It binds directly to replication origin recognition complexes (ORCs) that are primarily associated with the terminal repeat (TR) region of the HHV-8 genome.

Drinks served in volcano bowls are typically rum-based, mixed with tropical fruit juices and other liquors such as brandy, vodka, and triple sec, and garnished with fruit. The Flaming Volcano cocktail is especially associated with this drinkware. Background Volcano bowls typically have a large capacity of 32 oz. or more, and are used to serve a communal beverage to a group of two or more friends who share the drink, often sipping simultaneously from the bowl through long, colorful straws. Volcano bowls are designed with a rising central hub feature formed and painted to resemble a crude volcano cone, giving the vessel a topological similarity to a Bundt pan. The central cone, in turn, is topped by a pit or \\"crater\\" which is intended to be filled with overproof rum or other flammable high-alcohol liquor. This \\"crater\\" liquor is ignited just before service, creating a festive, mildly volcanic ambience with its central blue flame. Meanwhile, the drink surrounds the \\"volcano cone\\" in a ring-shaped moat, like a pool of lava or an ocean surrounding a volcanic island. The exterior surfaces of volcano bowls are usually decorated with painted or glazed-on tropical-themed images, such as hula dancers, palm trees, and island landscapes.

Synopsis A plot synopsis issued by the BBC in a press release read as follows: \\"In this drama, a killer has killed once and kidnapped another victim, challenging the investigative and forensic team to work out why. Suddenly everyone's past comes under scrutiny, everyone's version of the truth comes under suspicion. Kay Rousseau (Louise Lombard), who heads up the crime team, is back at work after the death of her child. Suspicion about her involvement in this death remains, not least in her own husband. Only Matt Costello (Danny Dyer), Kay's second-in-command and a dedicated, impassioned copper, is loyal to the core. Dr. George Austen (Lyndsey Marshal), the team's forensic scientist, worked on Kay's case and knows things Kay wished she didn't, and this isn't helped by her own fast increasing addiction to alcohol which puts her evidential work under unwelcome scrutiny. Dr Clive Morrell (Shaun Parkes) is a profiler whose own mood swings and strange behaviour are causing concern within the team. Jude Whiley (Lenora Crichlow) is a rookie cop, who is young, fresh and has an energy and passion for the job that verges on obsession. Miles Trumeman (Ace Bhatti) plays Kay's husband Miles Trueman, who is a lawyer attached to the case.

Although the specification provides for 1200 bit-per-second transmission speeds, modern transmission technology removes any speed limitations. Using fixed metadata fields and a series of control and other special characters, ANPA 1312 was designed to feed text stories to both teleprinters and computer-based news editing systems. Although the specification was based upon the 7-bit ASCII character set, some characters were declared to be replaced by traditional newspaper characters, e.g. small fractions and typesetting code. As such, it was a bridge between older typesetting methods, newspaper traditions and newer technology. Perhaps the best known part of ANPA-1312 was the category code system, which allowed articles to be categorized by a single letter. For example, sports articles were assigned category S, and articles about politics were assigned P. Many newspapers found the system convenient and sorted both incoming news agency and staff articles by ANPA-1312 categories. Superseded in the early 1990s by IPTC Information Interchange Model and later by the XML- based News Industry Text Format, ANPA-1312's popularity in North America remains strong due, in part, to its widespread support by The Associated Press and the reluctance of newspapers to invest in new computers or software modifications.

It is part of the 7.3 hectare Wansford Pasture & Standen's Pasture, a nature reserve managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire (WTBCN). This is a south-facing slope, with Jurassic limestone grassland and a flush lower down which has a wide variety of wet-loving plants, including some which are rare in the county. The ecology is maintained by avoiding the use of fertilisers and herbicides, and by grazing. The WTBCN was enlarged by the donation of Standen's Pasture in 2007. There is access to the site from Old Leicester Road.
