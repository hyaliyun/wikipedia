It is part of the traditional region of Gudbrandsdal. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Lillehammer. As of 2018, the population of the town of Lillehammer was 28,034. The city centre is a late nineteenth-century concentration of wooden houses, which enjoys a picturesque location overlooking the northern part of lake Mj√∏sa and the river L√•gen, surrounded by mountains. Lillehammer hosted the 1994 Winter Olympics and 2016 Winter Youth Olympics.Lillehammer awarded 2016 Winter Youth Olympic Games Before Oslo's withdrawal from consideration, it was included as part of a bid to host events in the 2022 Winter Olympics if Oslo were to win the rights to hold the Games. Populated places Lillehammer Municipality is further subdivided into the following populated places (i.e.: neighborhoods, quarters, villages, localities, settlements, communities, hamlets, etc.): * S√∏re √Öl * Nordre √Öl * Lillehammer Centre ** Nybu * V√•rsetergrenda ** R√∏yslimoen * Vingnes * J√∏rstadmoen ** F√•berg * Rudsbygd * Saksumdal * Vingrom * Nordseter * Busmoen Name The municipality (originally the parish) was named after the old Hamar (Norse Hamarr) farm, since the first church was built there. The name is identical with the word hamarr (rocky hill). To distinguish it from the nearby town and bishopric, both called Hamar, it began to be called \\"little Hamar\\": Lil√æl√¶ Hamar and Litlihamarr, and finally Lillehammer. It is also mentioned in the Old Norse sagas as Litlikaupangr (\\"Little Trading Place\\"). Coat-of- arms The coat-of-arms was granted in 1898 and shows a birkebeiner, carrying a spear and a shield, who is skiing down a mountainside. It symbolizes the historical importance of when the Birkebeiners carried the to-be-King Haakon from Lillehammer to Rena on skis. History A church in Lillehammer The area has been settled since the Norwegian Iron Age. It is also mentioned as a site for Thing assembly in 1390. Lillehammer had a lively market by the 1800s and obtained rights as a market town on 7 August 1827. There were 50 registered residents within its boundaries then. The town of Lillehammer was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838. The rural municipality of F√•berg was merged into the municipality of Lillehammer on 1 January 1964. In 1973, Mossad killed a Moroccan waiter, having mistaken him for Palestinian terrorist Ali Hassan Salameh, which became known as the Lillehammer affair. Lillehammer is known as a typical venue for winter sporting events; it was host city of the 1994 Winter Olympics, and the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, and was part of a joint bid with applicant host city Oslo to host events part of the 2022 Winter Olympics until Oslo withdrew its bid on 1 October 2014. Lillehammer is home to the largest literature festival in the Nordic countries, and in 2017 was designated as a UNESCO City of Literature. Education A number of schools are located in Lillehammer including the Hammartun Primary and Lower Secondary School, S√∏re √Öl Primary School and Kringsj√• Primary and Lower Secondary School. Lillehammer Public High School consists of two branches, North and South, both situated near the city center. The private High school Norwegian College of Elite Sports, NTG, also has a branch in Lillehammer. The Lillehammer campus of Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences is situated just north of the town itself. Lillehammer is also the home of the Nansen Academy - the Norwegian Humanistic Academy. The Nansen Academy is an educational institution for adult students with varied political, religious, and cultural backgrounds. The Academy was founded on the core principles of humanism and aims at strengthening the knowledge of these principles. The 14th World Scout Jamboree was held from 29 July to 7 August 1975 and was hosted by Norway at Lillehammer. Geography Lillehammer is situated in the lower part of Gudbrandsdal, at the northern head of lake Mj√∏sa, and is located to the south of the municipality of √òyer, to the southeast of Gausdal, northeast of Nordre Land, and to the north of Gj√∏vik, all in Oppland county. To the southeast, it is bordered by Ringsaker municipality in Hedmark county. To the northwest is the mountain Sp√•tind. Lillehammer is situated in an inland valley with reliable snow cover in winter = Climate = Lillehammer has a humid continental climate (Dfb), with the Scandinavian mountain chain to the west and north limiting oceanic influences; however, for the latitude, the climate is still relatively mild. The record high of 34 ¬∞C was recorded in June 1970. The record low of -31 ¬∞C was recorded in December 1978 and January 1979, and the same low was recorded in January 1987. There has been no overnight air frost in August since 1978 (the record low for that month being -0.6¬∞ C (30.9¬∞ F), a sufficient temperature for air frost), and the coldest recorded temperature after 2000 is -26.2 ¬∞C in January 2010. The current weather station Lillehammer-S√¶therengen became operational in 1982; extremes are also from two earlier weather stations in Lillehammer. Economy The basis for the city's commerce is its position as the northernmost point of the lake Mj√∏sa and as the gateway for the Gudbrandsdal region, through which the historical highway to Trondheim passes. The Mesna river has provided the basis for several small industries through the years, but Lillehammer is now all but industry-less. Transport One of the major Norwegian rail lines, the Dovre Line, runs from Hamar to the north through Lillehammer on its way up the Gudbrandsdal, to terminate in Trondheim. European route E6 passes through Lillehammer. Attractions Storgata shopping area In addition to the Olympic site, Lillehammer offers a number of other tourist attractions: * Maihaugen, centrally located in Lillehammer, is the largest open-air museum in Norway, with 185 buildings, mostly from Lillehammer and the valley of Gudbrandsdalen. *Garmo Stave Church (built around 1150) * The Norwegian Olympic Museum is the only museum in Northern Europe that shows the whole Olympic history from the ancient times and up to today, including all Summer- and Wintergames.

She brought her children with her for a short rest, planning on returning to Oslo but chose to remain in Lillehammer. She wrote her most famous works there: the three-volume Kristin Lavransdatter, the six-volume Sverkholt tales, and the four-volume Olav Audunss√∏nn. In 1940, because she had expressed strong anti- Nazi sentiments since the early 1930s, she fled Lillehammer before the invading German army reached the town. She returned to Lillehammer after the war and died there in 1949.

He gets a call from a neighbor in his hometown of Lewiston, telling him that his mother has been taken to the hospital after having a stroke. Lacking a functioning car, Parker decides to hitchhike the 120 miles (200 km) south to visit his mother. His first ride is with an old man who continually tugs at his crotch in a car that stinks of urine. Eventually frightened and glad to escape the vehicle, Alan starts walking, thumbing his next ride. Coming upon a graveyard, he begins to explore it and notices a headstone for a stranger named George Staub (in German, Staub means dust), which reads: \\"Well Begun, Too Soon Done\\". Sure enough, the next car to pick him up is driven by George Staub, complete with black stitches around his neck where his head had been sewn on after being severed and wearing a button saying, \\"I Rode The Bullet At Thrill Village, Laconia.\\" During the ride, George talks to Alan about the amusement park ride he was too scared to ride as a kid: The Bullet in Thrill Village, Laconia, New Hampshire. George tells Alan that before they reach the lights of town, Alan must choose who goes on the death ride with George: Alan or his mother. In a moment of fright, Alan saves himself and tells him: \\"Take her. Take my mother.\\" George shoves Alan out of the car. Alan reappears alone at the graveyard, wearing the \\"I Rode The Bullet At Thrill Village\\" button. He eventually reaches the hospital, where he learns that despite his guilt and the impending feeling that his mother is dead or will die any moment, she is fine. Alan takes the button and treasures it as a good (or bad) luck charm. His mother returns to work. Alan graduates and takes care of his mother for several years, and she suffers another stroke. One day, Alan loses the button and receives a phone call; he knows what the call is about. He finds the button underneath his mother's bed and, after a final moment of sadness, guilt, and meditation, decides to carry on. His mother's \\"ride\\" is over. Film A movie adaptation of the story, starring Jonathan Jackson and David Arquette, was released in 2004. Reception F&SF; (The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction) reviewer Charles de Lint praised the novella as \\"a terrific story, highlighting King's gift for characterization and his sheer narrative drive.\\" In contrast, The New York Times Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, who read the book in both available online formats (computer download and an e-book supplied by the publisher, neither of which permitted a user to print out a copy), was more critical. He disliked reading digital content on a backlit monitor (\\"I was also restlessly aware of the unusual effort it was taking to read onscreen\\") and the book's content (\\"after getting off to such a strong start, Mr. King writes himself into a corner that makes Alan's scary adventure seem something of a shaggy dog story\\").

The term also refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor or the ability to allocate tasks between them. There are many variations on this basic theme, and the definition of multiprocessing can vary with context, mostly as a function of how CPUs are defined (multiple cores on one die, multiple dies in one package, multiple packages in one system unit, etc.). According to some on-line dictionaries, a multiprocessor is a computer system having two or more processing units (multiple processors) each sharing main memory and peripherals, in order to simultaneously process programs. A 2009 textbook defined multiprocessor system similarly, but noting that the processors may share \\"some or all of the system‚Äôs memory and I/O facilities\\"; it also gave tightly coupled system as a synonymous term. At the operating system level, multiprocessing is sometimes used to refer to the execution of multiple concurrent processes in a system, with each process running on a separate CPU or core, as opposed to a single process at any one instant. When used with this definition, multiprocessing is sometimes contrasted with multitasking, which may use just a single processor but switch it in time slices between tasks (i.e. a time-sharing system). Multiprocessing however means true parallel execution of multiple processes using more than one processor. Multiprocessing doesn't necessarily mean that a single process or task uses more than one processor simultaneously; the term parallel processing is generally used to denote that scenario. Other authors prefer to refer to the operating system techniques as multiprogramming and reserve the term multiprocessing for the hardware aspect of having more than one processor. The remainder of this article discusses multiprocessing only in this hardware sense. In Flynn's taxonomy, multiprocessors as defined above are MIMD machines. As the term \\"multiprocessor\\" normally refers to tightly coupled systems in which all processors share memory, multiprocessors are not the entire class of MIMD machines, which also contains message passing multicomputer systems.  Pre-history  Possibly the first expression of the idea of multiprocessing was written by Luigi Federico Menabrea in 1842, about Charles Babbage's analytical engine (as translated by Ada Lovelace): \\"the machine can be brought into play so as to give several results at the same time, which will greatly abridge the whole amount of the processes.\\"  Key topics  =Processor symmetry= In a multiprocessing system, all CPUs may be equal, or some may be reserved for special purposes. A combination of hardware and operating system software design considerations determine the symmetry (or lack thereof) in a given system. For example, hardware or software considerations may require that only one particular CPU respond to all hardware interrupts, whereas all other work in the system may be distributed equally among CPUs; or execution of kernel-mode code may be restricted to only one particular CPU, whereas user-mode code may be executed in any combination of processors. Multiprocessing systems are often easier to design if such restrictions are imposed, but they tend to be less efficient than systems in which all CPUs are utilized. Systems that treat all CPUs equally are called symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems. In systems where all CPUs are not equal, system resources may be divided in a number of ways, including asymmetric multiprocessing (ASMP), non-uniform memory access (NUMA) multiprocessing, and clustered multiprocessing. Master/slave multiprocessor system In a master/slave multiprocessor system, the master CPU is in control of the computer and the slave CPU(s) performs assigned tasks. The CPUs can be completely different in terms of speed and architecture. Some (or all) of the CPUs can have share common bus, each can also have a private bus (for private resources), or they may be isolated except for a common communications pathway. Likewise, the CPUs can share common RAM and/or have private RAM that the other processor(s) cannot access. The roles of master and slave can change from one CPU to another. An early example of a master/slave multiprocessor system is the Tandy/Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 16 desktop computer which came out in February 1982 and ran the multi-user/multi-tasking Xenix operating system, Microsoft's version of UNIX (called TRS-XENIX). The Model 16 has 3 microprocessors, an 8-bit Zilog Z80 CPU running at 4MHz, a 16-bit Motorola 68000 CPU running at 6MHz and an Intel 8021 in the keyboard. When the system was booted, the Z-80 was the master and the Xenix boot process initialized the slave 68000, and then transferred control to the 68000, whereupon the CPUs changed roles and the Z-80 became a slave processor that was responsible for all I/O operations including disk, communications, printer and network, as well as the keyboard and integrated monitor, while the operating system and applications ran on the 68000 CPU. The Z-80 could be used to do other tasks. The earlier TRS-80 Model II, which was released in 1979, could also be considered a multiprocessor system as it had both a Z-80 CPU and an Intel 8021 microprocessor in the keyboard. The 8021 made the Model II the first desktop computer system with a separate detachable lightweight keyboard connected with by a single thin flexible wire, and likely the first keyboard to use a dedicated microprocessor, both attributes that would later be copied years later by Apple and IBM. =Instruction and data streams= In multiprocessing, the processors can be used to execute a single sequence of instructions in multiple contexts (single-instruction, multiple- data or SIMD, often used in vector processing), multiple sequences of instructions in a single context (multiple-instruction, single-data or MISD, used for redundancy in fail-safe systems and sometimes applied to describe pipelined processors or hyper-threading), or multiple sequences of instructions in multiple contexts (multiple-instruction, multiple-data or MIMD). =Processor coupling= Tightly coupled multiprocessor system Tightly coupled multiprocessor systems contain multiple CPUs that are connected at the bus level. These CPUs may have access to a central shared memory (SMP or UMA), or may participate in a memory hierarchy with both local and shared memory (SM)(NUMA). The IBM p690 Regatta is an example of a high end SMP system. Intel Xeon processors dominated the multiprocessor market for business PCs and were the only major x86 option until the release of AMD's Opteron range of processors in 2004. Both ranges of processors had their own onboard cache but provided access to shared memory; the Xeon processors via a common pipe and the Opteron processors via independent pathways to the system RAM. Chip multiprocessors, also known as multi-core computing, involves more than one processor placed on a single chip and can be thought of the most extreme form of tightly coupled multiprocessing. Mainframe systems with multiple processors are often tightly coupled. Loosely coupled multiprocessor system Loosely coupled multiprocessor systems (often referred to as clusters) are based on multiple standalone single or dual processor commodity computers interconnected via a high speed communication system (Gigabit Ethernet is common). A Linux Beowulf cluster is an example of a loosely coupled system. Tightly coupled systems perform better and are physically smaller than loosely coupled systems, but have historically required greater initial investments and may depreciate rapidly; nodes in a loosely coupled system are usually inexpensive commodity computers and can be recycled as independent machines upon retirement from the cluster. Power consumption is also a consideration. Tightly coupled systems tend to be much more energy efficient than clusters. This is because considerable economy can be realized by designing components to work together from the beginning in tightly coupled systems, whereas loosely coupled systems use components that were not necessarily intended specifically for use in such systems. Loosely coupled systems have the ability to run different operating systems or OS versions on different systems.

Background The Selkirk Rex is distinct from all other Rex breeds. Unlike the Devon Rex and Cornish Rex, the hair is of normal length and not partly missing. There are longhair and shorthair varieties. It differs from the LaPerm in that the Selkirk Rex coat is plusher and thicker. While the LaPerm gene is a simple dominant, the Selkirk gene (Se) acts as an incomplete dominant; incompletely dominant, allele pairs produce three possible genotypes and phenotypes: heterozygous cats (Sese) may have a fuller coat that is preferred in the show ring, while homozygous cats (SeSe) may have a tighter curl and less coat volume. The Selkirk Rex originated in Montana, USA in 1987, with a litter born to a rescued cat. The only unusually coated kitten in the litter was ultimately placed with breeder, Jeri Newman, who named her Miss DePesto (after a curly-haired character in the TV series Moonlighting played by Allyce Beasley). This foundation cat was bred to a black Persian male, producing three Selkirk Rex and three straight-haired kittens. This demonstrated that the gene had an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. All Selkirk Rex trace their ancestry back to the cat Miss DePesto. Jeri Newman named the breed after her stepfather, \\"Selkirk,\\" making this the first (and currently only) breed of cat to be named after an actual person. The breed has been developed in two coat lengths, long and short. It is a large and solidly built breed, similar to a British Shorthair. The coat is very soft and has a woolly look and feel with loose, unstructured curls. The head is round, with large rounded eyes, medium-sized ears, and a distinct muzzle, whose length is equal to half its width. An extreme break, like that of a Persian, is a disqualifiable fault. A white Selkirk Rex American Shorthairs, Persians, Himalayans, Exotic Shorthairs, and British Shorthairs have been used as outcrosses to develop this breed. The American Shorthair has now been discontinued as an outcross, except in The International Cat Association (TICA). The breed was accepted by The International Cat Association in 1992, the American Cat Fanciers Association in 1998, and the Cat Fanciers' Association in 2000. In Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) and in Australia, all outcrosses are scheduled to be discontinued in 2015. The breed is accepted in all colors, including the pointed, sepia, and mink varieties of albinism; bicolors; silver/smoke; and the chocolate and lilac series. This breed has an extremely dense coat and high propensity for shedding. Unlike other Rex breeds with reduced amounts of hair, the Selkirk Rex is not recommended for those who might be allergic to cat allergens. The temperament of the Selkirk Rex reflects that of the breeds used in its development. They have a lot of the laid-back, reserved qualities of the British Shorthair, the cuddly nature of the Persian, and the playfulness of the Exotic Shorthair. There are no known health problems specific to the Selkirk Rex breed. They are a robust breed. Breeding towards proper head structure is necessary to prevent kinking of the tear ducts, resulting in tear run down the front of the face, or muzzle creases that can result in dermatitis on the face. Like other Rex breeds, irritation of the inside of the ear by curly fur can occur, increasing the production of ear wax. Homozygous cats (with two copies of the dominant Selkirk Rex gene) may have a tendency towards excessive greasiness of the coat, requiring increased frequency of bathing. Other health problems may be inherited from the outcross breeds used, including polycystic kidney disease from Persians and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from British Shorthairs. Responsible breeders screen their breeding cats for these diseases to minimize their impact on the breed. In the UK, all Selkirk Rex registered with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) for breeding are genetically tested for Polycystic Kidney Disease or are from two genetically tested parents.  Genetics  The Selkirk Rex is defined by an autosomal dominant woolly rexoid hair (ADWH) abnormality that is characterized by tightly curled hair shafts.Gandolfi B, Alhaddad H, Joslin SE, Khan R, Filler S, Brem G, Lyons LA. A splice variant in KRT71 is associated with curly coat phenotype of Selkirk Rex cats. Sci. Rep. 2013;3:2000. . A splice variant in the gene KRT71 was found to be associated with the curly coat phenotype. KRT71 is a crucial gene for keratinization of the hair follicle. An allele of this gene is also responsible for the hairless (hr) Sphynx and the Devon Rex (re) hair.Gandolfi, B.et al. The naked truth: Sphynx and Devon Rex cat breed mutations in KRT71.Mamm Genome21, 509‚Äì515 (2010) Three mutations in KRT71 have now been identified in cats, forming the allelic series, KRT71SADRE > KRT71+ > KRT71re > KRT71hr,Gandolfi B, Alhaddad H, Joslin SE, Khan R, Filler S, Brem G, Lyons LA.

Dolores wants to make clear to the police that she did not kill Vera, whom she has looked after for years, but does confess to orchestrating the death of her husband, Joe St. George, almost 30 years before. Dolores's confession develops into the story of her life, her troubled marriage, and her relationship with her employer. She first describes her relationship with her employer, which began when Vera and her millionaire husband purchased a summer home on Little Tall Island in 1949 and hired Dolores as a maid. Able to cope with Vera's brutally exacting standards, Dolores rises from maid to housekeeper at the Donovan home. After her husband's death in a car crash in the late '50s, Vera spends increasing time at her island house, eventually moving in permanently. After Vera suffers a series of strokes in the 1980s, Dolores becomes the woman's live-in caretaker and reluctant companion. As the wealthy woman slips into dementia, Dolores comforts her from terrifying hallucinations of a force she calls \\"the dust bunnies.\\" When Vera is lucid, Dolores combats her increasing mind games and power plays. Dolores further reveals that when began working at the Donovan house, her marriage to Joe St. George was already in distress due to his drinking problem, as well as verbal and physical abuse. Their children, Selena, Joe Jr., and Pete, are unaware of the abuse. The marriage problems come to a head one night in 1960 when Joe viciously hits Dolores in the small of her back with a piece of stove wood over a perceived slight. In retaliation, Dolores smashes a ceramic cream pot over his head and threatens him with a hatchet, swearing she will kill him if he ever strikes her again. This confrontation is witnessed by their teenaged daughter, Selena. Joe stops beating Dolores and she allows him to leave the island community in an effort to save face. Selena does not realize Dolores was abused and acted in self-defense, and Joe uses the hatchet incident to gain sympathy from her. A rift grows between mother and daughter. In 1962, Dolores notices Selena has become increasingly withdrawn, frightened, and unsociable. After speculating she has met a boy or become involved in drugs, Dolores finally confronts her daughter as they return home on the island ferry. She explains the truth of the hatchet incident and, against her wishes, Selena then admits her father molested her. Overwhelmed, Selena nearly jumps off the side of the ferry, but Dolores stops her and comforts her, vowing to protect her. That night, she considers murdering Joe on the spot, describing the urge to kill him as the opening of an \\"inside eye.\\" Instead, she confronts him, promising to have him arrested if he ever touches Selena again. Dolores then resolves to protect her children by leaving Joe. When she attempts to withdraw her children's savings accounts to fund their escape, she discovers Joe has stolen everything she had saved. In despair, she breaks down crying at work, confiding in Vera. An unusually sympathetic Vera reveals she has had some sort of experience with Dolores' \\"inside eye\\", and casually remarks that men like Joe often die in accidents, leaving their wives everything. As she departs, she implies she arranged the car crash that killed her own husband and advises Dolores \\"sometimes, an accident can be an unhappy woman's best friend.\\" Dolores begins plotting Joe's death, but does not find an opportunity to put her plan into action until the summer of 1963. Vera becomes obsessed with a total solar eclipse that will be visible from the island, convinced the event will convince her estranged children to visit her. She plans a massive viewing party on the island ferry. Knowing the island will be mostly empty at that time, Dolores ensures Selena is sent to camp and her sons, Joe Jr. and Pete, are sent on a trip to visit family, and marks the location of a dried-up stone well in a patch of brambles on the edge of their property. When it becomes clear her children will not be joining her during this time, Vera becomes despondent and lashes out at her hired help, calming only after Dolores confronts her over the unjust firing of one of the maids. On the day of the eclipse, Dolores buys Joe a bottle of fine scotch and makes him a sandwich, getting him drunk and comfortable, and they share a moment of physical affection for the first time in many years. As the eclipse begins, Dolores has a vision of a young girl in the path of the eclipse who is being sexually abused by her father at that same moment. Reminded of what she has set out to do, she deliberately enrages Joe by claiming she has recovered the money he had stolen, provoking him into attacking her. She flees into the brambles, leading Joe to the well and tricking him into stepping on the rotted boards that cover it. The planks break and he falls into the well, but is not instantly killed. He calls out for help for some time before eventually falling unconscious. Dolores returns to the house and falls asleep, but has a nightmare and forces herself to check the well. She arrives to discover Joe has regained consciousness and has nearly managed to climb out. He grabs at Dolores and attempts to pull her in with him. She finally kills him by hitting him in the face with a rock, and he falls back into the well. Dolores reports Joe missing, and his body is found after several days of searching. Joe's death is ruled an accident despite the suspicions of the local coroner and the rumor mill of Little Tall Island. Dolores is free of Joe, but her actions damage her relationship with Selena, who also suspects her mother killed her father. The narration finally comes to the circumstances of Vera's death, an incident which has led Dolores to tell her story. She confesses that Vera, in one of her hallucinations, managed to get out of her wheelchair and fled in terror from \\"the dust bunnies\\", falling down a flight of stairs. As Vera falls, Dolores has a terrifying vision of Joe's ghost covered in dust. Somehow alive and lucid despite her injuries, Vera begs Dolores to help end her suffering. Dolores fetches a rolling pin, but Vera dies before she can use it. The incriminating scene is discovered by the local mailman, who suspects Dolores of killing the old woman and forces her to call the police. That night, Dolores is harassed and threatened by members of the island community who believe she has gotten away with murder in the past. The next day, Dolores receives a phone call from Vera's lawyer, who informs a shocked Dolores that she has inherited Vera's entire fortune, which amounts to nearly $30 million. Dolores initially refuses the money in favor of Vera's estranged children but then learns they were killed in a car crash in 1961, and Vera had spent the last 40 years of her life only pretending they were still alive. Knowing the inheritance will be seen as a motive for murder and worsen the case against her, Dolores convinces herself the only way to clear her name is to confess everything. Feeling at peace with herself at long last, she ends her statement. Several newspaper articles provide an epilogue to the story, revealing Dolores was cleared of any blame in Vera's death and anonymously donated Vera's entire fortune to the New England Home For Little Wanderers. The final article implies Dolores and Selena have reconciled and that Selena will be coming home for the first time in 20 years. Style Unlike many other works by King, little focus is given to the supernatural;Gina Wisker, Horror Fiction: An Introduction, p. 20 (The Continuum International Publishing Group Inc., 2005). although several supernatural occurrences are implied, the only such events that clearly occur in the book are two telepathic visions, which, along with the solar eclipse backdrop, form a link to King's novel Gerald's Game.Heidi Strengell, Dissecting Stephen King: From the Gothic to Literary Naturalism, p. 48 (The University of Wisconsin Press, 2005). Characters *Dolores Claiborne - The novel's narrator and protagonist, she is a 65-year old housekeeper. Caustic but not embittered by a lifetime of hard work and suffering, she is forced to confront her past sins to clear her name of a murder she did not commit. *Vera Donovan - Dolores' employer and a demanding, high-handed woman (in Dolores' phrasing, \\"a high-riding bitch\\"), she has a fanatical devotion to her complicated household procedures and will fire her hired help for the smallest of mistakes; Vera unexpectedly becomes Dolores' only ally in her battle to free herself from Joe. Vera is revealed to have orchestrated the car crash that killed her unfaithful husband. As an elderly woman, she suffers a series of strokes and spends the last years of her life in an increasingly addled state, and Dolores' position shifts from housekeeper to caretaker. When lucid, she gains amusement by inconveniencing Dolores anyway she can, even deliberately soiling herself and her bedding so Dolores will be forced to clean her. She suffers from terrifying visions and hallucinations she calls \\"the dust bunnies\\", which she implies take the form of her dead husband and children, and which eventually lead to her death. *Joe St. George - Dolores' husband, she marries him directly out of high school. Inconsistently employed, racist, and both verbally and physically abusive to his family, Joe eventually begins sexually abusing his daughter, which leads Dolores to kill him. His death is significantly more painful and prolonged than Dolores intended, and his suffering weighs heavily upon her. *Selena St. George - Dolores' and Joe's daughter, and extremely bright and friendly as a girl, she is an honor student by the time she is in high school. After witnessing her mother threaten her father at the age of 12, she misunderstands the situation and becomes more sympathetic to Joe, who takes advantage of her kindness and begins molesting her. She becomes withdrawn and verges on the edge of suicide before Dolores manages to put a stop to the abuse. After Joe's death, Selena directly asks her mother if she killed him, which Dolores denies, but Selena is left questioning her mother's guilt. As an adult, Selena moves to New York and becomes a well-known journalist, but struggles with alcoholism and becomes distant from her mother. In the novel's epilogue, they are implied to be beginning to reconcile. *Joe St. George Jr. - Dolores and Joe's older son, he is harassed and belittled by his father for his intelligence, sensitivity, and lack of physical prowess, and by the time of Joe's death, his son actively despises him. When his father dies, he surprisingly takes it the hardest of the three children, struggling with guilt over his hatred for his father. As an adult, he becomes a state senator in Maine and has a close relationship with his mother. *Pete St. George - Dolores' youngest son, nine years old when his father dies, he is referred to as \\"little Pete\\" or \\"Petey\\" by his mother, he idolizes his father and begins to imitate him, getting into fights at school and using racial slurs he does not understand. As an adult, he enlists in the army and is killed in Vietnam shortly before the end of the war. *Michael Donovan - Vera's husband, he is a millionaire airplane manufacturer. He is killed in a car accident outside Baltimore on the way back from his mistress' apartment, in an accident organized by Vera. *Donald and Helga Donovan - Vera's children, they are last seen by Dolores in 1961, when Donald is 16 and Helga is 14, after an argument in which Vera refuses to let Helga get a driver's license. Dolores speculates that they were aware or suspicious of their mother's role in their father's death and may even have been blackmailing her. Vera spends years telling Dolores they are estranged and creates elaborate lies of their current careers and families, but after her death, it emerges that they had died several months after Dolores last saw them, having veered off the road in a car driven by Helga. *Ted Kenopensky - Vera's handyman and occasional lover, Dolores refers to him as \\"the Hunky\\". Dolores believes he conspired with Vera to kill her husband. He is killed in a car crash shortly after Vera's health begins to fail. *Mr. Pease - A banker, he unwillingly helps Dolores discover what Joe has done with the money he has stolen from her children's college funds. In doing so, he shares confidential information with her against regulations, and after Joe's death, he does not come forward to share his knowledge of Dolores' motives for murder, which Dolores believes is out of fear of his job. *Dr. John McAuliffe - The county medical examiner, he examines Joe's body. A small, fastidious Scotsman, he suspects Dolores of killing her husband and harshly interrogates her prior to the official inquest, nearly cornering her with discrepancies in her story. He is eventually forced to enter a verdict of accidental death, which he does unwillingly. *Garrett Thibodeau - The town constable, he investigates Joe's death. Friendly, empathetic, and not too bright, he accidentally derails McAuliffe's interrogation of Dolores and ensures she is not charged with Joe's death. *Sammy Marchant - The island's dimwitted mailman, he discovers Dolores standing over Vera's dead body. He immediately suspects her of murder and is responsible for the rumors that begin to spread, forcing Dolores to make her confession to the police. *Andy Bissette, Nancy Bannister, and Frank Proulx - The police chief, stenographer, and officer, respectively, they are in the room listening to Dolores' confession. None of their dialogue is included in the novel, which is presented as a transcript of Dolores' statement, but Dolores frequently addresses them. Adaptations The novel was adapted into a 1995 film directed by Taylor Hackford.

The story is about a woman whose husband dies of a heart attack while she is handcuffed to a bed, and, following the subsequent realization that she is trapped with little hope of rescue, begins to let the voices inside her head take over. The book is dedicated to King's wife Tabitha and her sisters: \\"This book is dedicated, with love and admiration, to six good women: Margaret Spruce Morehouse, Catherine Spruce Graves, Stephanie Spruce Leonard, Anne Spruce Labree, Tabitha Spruce King, and Marcella Spruce.\\" Originally the book was intended to be a companion piece to King's novel Dolores Claiborne, with the connecting theme of two women in crisis caught in the path of an eclipse, though this aspect was greatly reduced by the time the books were published. The book was adapted into a 2017 film directed by Mike Flanagan. Plot Jessie Burlingame and her husband Gerald, a successful and aggressive lawyer, travel to their secluded lakehouse in western Maine for an unplanned romantic getaway. The titular \\"game\\" involves handcuffing Jessie to the bed for lovemaking, a recent addition to their marriage that both partners find exciting. This time, however, Jessie finds herself reluctant after being handcuffed to the bedposts and asks to stop, only to be ignored by Gerald, who pretends her protests are only part of their game. Realizing her husband is deliberately feigning ignorance and that he plans to rape her, Jessie lashes out, kicking Gerald in the chest. The shock causes him to have a fatal heart attack. He dies, leaving Jessie still handcuffed to the bed. At first Jessie is only horrified at her husband's death and fears the embarrassment of being discovered semi-naked and handcuffed, but she quickly realizes the situation is far more dire: it is unlikely that she or Gerald will be missed for several days, no one will think to look for them at the lakehouse, and all the usual lake residents have gone for the season. There is a real possibility that Jessie will die if she cannot escape. While Jessie frantically explores and rejects plans, a combination of panic and thirst causes her to hallucinate voices: \\"The Goodwife\\" or \\"Goody Burlingame,\\" a Puritanical version of herself that undermines her escape attempts by insisting that things will be fine and that she should wait to be rescued; \\"Punkin,\\" a representation of Jessie as a young girl; Ruth, a college roommate whom Jessie abandoned after a conversation that strayed dangerously close to uncovering Jessie's childhood; and Nora, Jessie's former psychologist with whom she had a similar encounter and who she likewise abandoned. Guided by these voices, Jessie is able to recall the long-repressed memory of being sexually abused by her father during a solar eclipse when Jessie was ten. She also begins to acknowledge how unhappy and controlling her marriage to Gerald was, suspecting that she gave up her independent and courageous spirit for the security of being Gerald's trophy wife. Waking from an imaginary confrontation with all these characters to a dark bedroom, Jessie sees a tall, gaunt apparition in the corner of the room, whom she initially mistakes for the spirit of her long-dead father and whom she nicknames \\"Space Cowboy\\" (after a line from a Steve Miller song, \\"The Joker\\"). The figure shows her a wicker basket of jewelry mixed with human bones. Unsure if the figure is another hallucination, Jessie dismisses it, saying aloud that it is \\"only made of moonlight,\\" which seems to make it vanish. Her inner voices, however, believe that the figure is real and will return to harm Jessie if she does not escape by the next night. The following morning, Jessie manages to secure a drink of water from a glass on the bedside table. Refreshed and encouraged by her own ingenuity in getting the water, she renews her efforts to escape, first by trying to break the headboard, then by trying to slip off the bed and push it to the bureau where the keys are placed. Inspired by her memory of the eclipse, in which her father warned her not to cut herself on the glass panes they used as eclipse viewers, Jessie breaks the water glass and uses a sharp shard to slice her wrist, giving herself a degloving injury to lubricate her skin enough to slide her right hand from the cuff. She is then able to escape the bed, reach the keys, and free her other hand, only to faint from blood loss. When she awakens, it is nearly dark and the Space Cowboy, now undeniably real, has returned. Jessie throws her wedding ring at his box of jewelry and bones, thinking that is what he wanted all along, then runs to her car and drives away, only to discover the Space Cowboy hidden in the back seat. Jessie crashes and is knocked unconscious. Months later, Jessie is still recuperating from her ordeal. An attorney at Gerald's law firm assists her in covering up the incident to protect her and the law firm from scandal, but Jessie feels this is another version of burying her trauma, just as she buried her childhood abuse years before. To free herself, Jessie writes to the real Ruth, with whom she has not spoken in decades, detailing what really happened at the lakehouse and subsequent events. The \\"Space Cowboy\\" was a serial killer and necrophile named Raymond Andrew Joubert who had been living in and robbing lakehouses in the area. Jessie confronted Joubert at his court hearing, where Joubert mocked her \\"made of moonlight\\" statement, confirming that the encounter really occurred and causing Jessie to spit in his face. Being able to directly confront the man who once terrified her allowed her to face the other manipulative men in her life, including her father and Gerald, freeing her of fear and allowing her to deal more honestly with her past. She apologizes for abandoning Ruth, acknowledging that Ruth had confronted her with a truth she could not then face, and hopes they can resume their friendship. After mailing the letter, Jessie is able to sleep without nightmares for the first time since her ordeal at the lakehouse.  Film adaptation  In May 2014, Deadline Hollywood reported that Mike Flanagan had been set to direct a film adaptation. In an interview with Rue Morgue in September 2016, Flanagan said that the film adaptation would premiere on Netflix. In October 2016, Deadline reported that Carla Gugino and Bruce Greenwood would star in the film as Jessie and Gerald Burlingame. On October 17, 2016, Flanagan tweeted indicating the first day of production had begun. The film premiered on Netflix on September 29, 2017.

In 2004, a pop-up book adaptation was released with design by Kees Moerbeek and illustration by Alan Dingman. A film adaptation to be produced by Chris Romero was announced in 2019.  Plot summary  The story is set in motion by a family hiking trip, during which Trisha's brother, Pete, and mother constantly squabble about the mother's divorce from their father, as well as other topics. Trisha falls back to avoid listening and is therefore unable to find her family again after she wanders off the trail to take a bathroom break. Trying to catch up by attempting a shortcut, she slips and falls down a steep embankment and ends up hopelessly lost, heading deeper into the heart of the forest. She is left with a bottle of water, two Twinkies, a boiled egg, a tuna sandwich, a bottle of Surge, a poncho, a Game Boy, and a Walkman. She listens to her Walkman to keep her mood up, either to learn of news of the search for her, or to listen to the baseball game featuring her favorite player, and \\"heartthrob,\\" Tom Gordon. As she starts to take steps to survive by conserving what little food she has with her and consuming edible flora, Trisha's family return to their car without her and call the police to start a search. The rescuers search in the area around the path, but not as far as Trisha has gone. The girl decides to follow a creek because of what she read in Little House on the Prairie (though it soon turns into a swamp-like river), rationalizing that all bodies of water lead eventually to civilization. As the cops stop searching for the night, she huddles up underneath a tree to rest. Eventually, a combination of fear, hunger, and thirst causes Trisha to hallucinate. She imagines several people from her life, as well as her hero, Tom Gordon, appearing to her. It's left unclear whether increasingly obvious signs of supernatural events in the woods are also hallucinations. Hours and soon days begin to pass, with Trisha wandering further into the woods. Eventually she begins to believe that she is headed for a confrontation with the God of the Lost, a wasp-faced, evil entity who is hunting her down. Her trial becomes a test of a 9-year-old girl's ability to maintain sanity in the face of seemingly certain death. Racked with pneumonia and near death, she comes upon a road, but just as she discovers signs of civilization, she is confronted by a bear, which she interprets as the God of the Lost in disguise. Facing down her fear, she realizes it is the bottom of the ninth, and she must close the game. In imitation of Tom Gordon, she takes a pitcher's stance and throws her Walkman like a baseball, hitting the bear in the face, and startling it enough to make it back away. A hunter who has come upon the confrontation between girl and beast frightens the beast away and takes Trisha to safety, but Trisha knows that she earned her rescue. Trisha wakes up in a hospital room. She finds her divorced parents and older brother waiting near her bedside. A nurse tells the girl's family that they must leave so that Trisha can rest because \\"her numbers are up and we don't want that.\\" Her father is the last to leave. Before he does Trisha asks him to hand her a Red Sox hat (autographed by Tom Gordon) and she points towards the sky, just as Tom Gordon does when he closes a game. Film adaptation Although George A.

At the invitation of a senior partner, he joins a strange men's club where the members, in addition to reading, chatting and playing pool and chess, like to tell stories, some of which range into the bizarre and macabre. The club and its butler are also featured in King's short story \\"The Man Who Would Not Shake Hands\\". One Thursday before Christmas, the elderly physician Dr. Emlyn McCarron tells a story about an episode that took place early in his long and varied career: that of a patient, Sandra Stansfield, who was determined to give birth to her illegitimate child, no matter what, despite financial problems and social disapproval. McCarron comes to admire her bravery and humor, and the implication is that he has even fallen a bit in love with her. Sandra masters Dr. McCarron's unusual (for the 1930s) breathing method intended to help her through childbirth. However, when she goes into labor and is on the way to the hospital on an icy winter night, her taxi crashes and she is decapitated. McCarron arrives at the crash site and realizes that Sandra is somehow still alive. Her lungs in her decapitated body are still pumping air, as her head, some feet away, is working to sustain the breathing method so that the baby can be born.

There are two basic types of reference locality temporal and spatial locality. Temporal locality refers to the reuse of specific data, and/or resources, within a relatively small time duration. Spatial locality (also termed data locality\\"NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework: Volume 1\\", [https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1500-1r2 urn:doi:10.6028/NIST.SP.1500-1r2) refers to the use of data elements within relatively close storage locations. Sequential locality, a special case of spatial locality, occurs when data elements are arranged and accessed linearly, such as, traversing the elements in a one-dimensional array. Locality is a type of predictable behavior that occurs in computer systems. Systems that exhibit strong locality of reference are great candidates for performance optimization through the use of techniques such as the caching, prefetching for memory and advanced branch predictors at the pipelining stage of a processor core.  Types of locality  There are several different types of locality of reference: * Temporal locality: If at one point a particular memory location is referenced, then it is likely that the same location will be referenced again in the near future. There is a temporal proximity between the adjacent references to the same memory location. In this case it is common to make efforts to store a copy of the referenced data in faster memory storage, to reduce the latency of subsequent references. Temporal locality is a special case of spatial locality (see below), namely when the prospective location is identical to the present location. * Spatial locality: If a particular storage location is referenced at a particular time, then it is likely that nearby memory locations will be referenced in the near future. In this case it is common to attempt to guess the size and shape of the area around the current reference for which it is worthwhile to prepare faster access for subsequent reference. ** Memory locality (or data locality): Spatial locality explicitly relating to memory. * Branch locality: If there are only a few possible alternatives for the prospective part of the path in the spatial-temporal coordinate space. This is the case when an instruction loop has a simple structure, or the possible outcome of a small system of conditional branching instructions is restricted to a small set of possibilities. Branch locality is typically not a spatial locality since the few possibilities can be located far away from each other. * Equidistant locality: It is halfway between the spatial locality and the branch locality. Consider a loop accessing locations in an equidistant pattern, i.e., the path in the spatial-temporal coordinate space is a dotted line. In this case, a simple linear function can predict which location will be accessed in the near future. In order to benefit from the very frequently occurring temporal and spatial locality, most of the information storage systems are hierarchical. The equidistant locality is usually supported by the diverse nontrivial increment instructions of the processors. For branch locality, the contemporary processors have sophisticated branch predictors, and on the basis of this prediction the memory manager of the processor tries to collect and preprocess the data of the plausible alternatives. Relevance There are several reasons for locality. These reasons are either goals to achieve or circumstances to accept, depending on the aspect. The reasons below are not disjoint; in fact, the list below goes from the most general case to special cases: * Predictability: Locality is merely one type of predictable behavior in computer systems. * Structure of the program: Locality occurs often because of the way in which computer programs are created, for handling decidable problems. Generally, related data is stored in nearby locations in storage. One common pattern in computing involves the processing of several items, one at a time. This means that if a lot of processing is done, the single item will be accessed more than once, thus leading to temporal locality of reference. Furthermore, moving to the next item implies that the next item will be read, hence spatial locality of reference, since memory locations are typically read in batches. * Linear data structures: Locality often occurs because code contains loops that tend to reference arrays or other data structures by indices. Sequential locality, a special case of spatial locality, occurs when relevant data elements are arranged and accessed linearly. For example, the simple traversal of elements in a one-dimensional array, from the base address to the highest element would exploit the sequential locality of the array in memory.Aho, Lam, Sethi, and Ullman. \\"Compilers: Principles, Techniques & Tools\\" 2nd ed. Pearson Education, Inc. 2007 Equidistant locality occurs when the linear traversal is over a longer area of adjacent data structures with identical structure and size, accessing mutually corresponding elements of each structure rather than each entire structure. This is the case when a matrix is represented as a sequential matrix of rows and the requirement is to access a single column of the matrix. * Efficiency of memory hierarchy use: Although random access memory presents the programmer with the ability to read or write anywhere at any time, in practice latency and throughput are affected by the efficiency of the cache, which is improved by increasing the locality of reference. Poor locality of reference results in cache thrashing and cache pollution and to avoid it, data elements with poor locality can be bypassed from cache.\\"A Survey Of Cache Bypassing Techniques\\", JLPEA, vol. 6, no. 2, 2016  General usage  If most of the time the substantial portion of the references aggregate into clusters, and if the shape of this system of clusters can be well predicted, then it can be used for performance optimization. There are several ways to benefit from locality using optimization techniques. Common techniques are: * Increasing the locality of references (generally on the software side) * Exploiting the locality of references: Generally achieved on the hardware side, temporal and spatial locality can be capitalized by hierarchical storage hardware. The equidistant locality can be used by the appropriately specialized instructions of the processors, this possibility is not only the responsibility of hardware, but the software as well, whether its structure is suitable for compiling a binary program that calls the specialized instructions in question. The branch locality is a more elaborate possibility, hence more developing effort is needed, but there is much larger reserve for future exploration in this kind of locality than in all the remaining ones.  Spatial and temporal locality usage  = Hierarchical memory = Hierarchical memory is a hardware optimization that takes the benefits of spatial and temporal locality and can be used on several levels of the memory hierarchy. Paging obviously benefits from temporal and spatial locality. A cache is a simple example of exploiting temporal locality, because it is a specially designed, faster but smaller memory area, generally used to keep recently referenced data and data near recently referenced data, which can lead to potential performance increases. Data elements in a cache do not necessarily correspond to data elements that are spatially close in the main memory; however, data elements are brought into cache one cache line at a time. This means that spatial locality is again important: if one element is referenced, a few neighboring elements will also be brought into cache. Finally, temporal locality plays a role on the lowest level, since results that are referenced very closely together can be kept in the machine registers. Some programming languages (such as C) allow the programmer to suggest that certain variables be kept in registers. Data locality is a typical memory reference feature of regular programs (though many irregular memory access patterns exist). It makes the hierarchical memory layout profitable. In computers, memory is divided into a hierarchy in order to speed up data accesses. The lower levels of the memory hierarchy tend to be slower, but larger. Thus, a program will achieve greater performance if it uses memory while it is cached in the upper levels of the memory hierarchy and avoids bringing other data into the upper levels of the hierarchy that will displace data that will be used shortly in the future. This is an ideal, and sometimes cannot be achieved. Typical memory hierarchy (access times and cache sizes are approximations of typical values used for the purpose of discussion; actual values and actual numbers of levels in the hierarchy vary): * CPU registers (8-256 registers) - immediate access, with the speed of the innermost core of the processor * L1 CPU caches (32 KiB to 512 KiB) - fast access, with the speed of the innermost memory bus owned exclusively by each core * L2 CPU caches (128 KiB to 24 MiB) - slightly slower access, with the speed of the memory bus shared between twins of cores * L3 CPU caches (2 MiB to 32 MiB) - even slower access, with the speed of the memory bus shared between even more cores of the same processor * Main physical memory (RAM) (256 MiB to 64 GiB) - slow access, the speed of which is limited by the spatial distances and general hardware interfaces between the processor and the memory modules on the motherboard * Disk (virtual memory, file system) (1 GiB to 256 TiB) - very slow, due to the narrower (in bit width), physically much longer data channel between the main board of the computer and the disk devices, and due to the extraneous software protocol needed on the top of the slow hardware interface * Remote memory (other computers or the cloud) (practically unlimited) - speed varies from very slow to extremely slow Modern machines tend to read blocks of lower memory into the next level of the memory hierarchy. If this displaces used memory, the operating system tries to predict which data will be accessed least (or latest) and move it down the memory hierarchy. Prediction algorithms tend to be simple to reduce hardware complexity, though they are becoming somewhat more complicated. = Matrix multiplication = A common example is matrix multiplication: for i in 0..n for j in 0..m for k in 0..p C[i][j] = C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]; By switching the looping order for \`j\` and \`k\`, the speedup in large matrix multiplications becomes dramatic, at least for languages that put contiguous array elements in the last dimension. This will not change the mathematical result, but it improves efficiency. In this case, \\"large\\" means, approximately, more than 100,000 elements in each matrix, or enough addressable memory such that the matrices will not fit in L1 and L2 caches. for i in 0..n for k in 0..p for j in 0..m C[i][j] = C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]; The reason for this speedup is that in the first case, the reads of \`A[i][k]\` are in cache (since the \`k\` index is the contiguous, last dimension), but \`B[k][j]\` is not, so there is a cache miss penalty on \`B[k][j]\`. \`C[i][j]\` is irrelevant, because it can be hoisted out of the inner loop -- the loop variable there is \`k\`. for i in 0..n for j in 0..m temp = C[i][j] for k in 0..p temp = temp + A[i][k] * B[k][j]; C[i][j] = temp In the second case, the reads and writes of \`C[i][j]\` are both in cache, the reads of \`B[k][j]\` are in cache, and the read of \`A[i][k]\` can be hoisted out of the inner loop. for i in 0..n for k in 0..p temp = A[i][k] for j in 0..m C[i][j] = C[i][j] + temp * B[k][j]; Thus, the second example has no cache miss penalty in the inner loop while the first example has a cache penalty. On a year 2014 processor, the second case is approximately five times faster than the first case, when written in C and compiled with \`gcc -O3\`. (A careful examination of the disassembled code shows that in the first case, GCC uses SIMD instructions and in the second case it does not, but the cache penalty is much worse than the SIMD gain.) Temporal locality can also be improved in the above example by using a technique called blocking. The larger matrix can be divided into evenly sized sub-matrices, so that the smaller blocks can be referenced (multiplied) several times while in memory. for (ii = 0; ii < SIZE; ii += BLOCK_SIZE) for (kk = 0; kk < SIZE; kk += BLOCK_SIZE) for (jj = 0; jj < SIZE; jj += BLOCK_SIZE) maxi = min(ii + BLOCK_SIZE, SIZE); for (i = ii; i < maxi; i++) maxk = min(kk + BLOCK_SIZE, SIZE); for (k = kk; k < maxk; k++) maxj = min(jj + BLOCK_SIZE, SIZE); for (j = jj; j < maxj; j++) C[i][j] = C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]; The temporal locality of the above solution is provided because a block can be used several times before moving on, so that it is moved in and out of memory less often. Spatial locality is improved because elements with consecutive memory addresses tend to be pulled up the memory hierarchy together.

It is his second book of this type, the first one being Different Seasons. The collection won the Bram Stoker Award in 1990 for Best Collection and was nominated for a Locus Award in 1991. In the introduction, King says that, while a collection of four novellas like Different Seasons, this book is more strictly horror with elements of the supernatural. Contents The four novellas contained in the collection are described here: =The Langoliers=  Plot  On a cross-country red-eye flight from Los Angeles to Boston, ten passengers awaken to find that the crew and most of their fellow passengers have disappeared, leaving the airliner under the control of the autopilot. They realise that only those who were sleeping are now left on the plane. Off-duty airline pilot Brian Engle takes control from the autopilot and lands the plane in Bangor, Maine despite protests from the irritable Craig Toomy, who is obsessed with going to Boston. Upon arrival, they find the airport abandoned with no signs of life. Hearing an approaching sound like radio static, the group agrees to leave before it arrives. Based on the belief that they have flown through a \\"time rip\\" into the past and that flying back into the rip will return them to their own time, the passengers work together to refuel the plane as the noise gets louder. Having lost touch with reality, Craig believes the others to be manifestations of the Langoliers, monsters his now-deceased father described when Craig was a child, chasing and devouring those who are lazy and waste time. He stabs Dinah, a young blind girl with psychic powers, and kills Don Gaffey, before being subdued. Dinah insists that Craig must not be killed as the group needs him alive. While the plane is in its final preparations to depart Bangor, Dinah telepathically communicates with Craig and persuades him that an important board meeting is being held on the runway. Craig hallucinates arriving at the meeting and even confronts his fear of disappointing his father. Then hundreds of monsters arrive, floating spheres with chainsaw-like teeth, which leave trails of black nothingness in their wake. They initially head for the plane, but Craig's presence on the runway (which also results in them erasing Craig) distracts them long enough to allow Engle to start the plane. As they turn to the west, the passengers watch the rest of the land below falling into a formless, black void. Bob Jenkins, a mystery writer, proposes the idea that the Langoliers' purpose is to clean up what's left of the past by eating it. Dinah succumbs to her injuries and the other characters realise that the trip through the rip has allowed them to come to terms with their regrets. Because they need to be asleep to survive the rip again, another passenger, Nick Hopewell, who carries an especially guilty conscience, volunteers to fly the plane through, knowing that this will cost him his life. The cabin pressure is decreased, and everyone falls into a deep sleep, except for Nick, who is wearing an emergency oxygen mask. He flies the plane through the rip and, seconds after restoring the cabin pressure to revive the others, he disappears. The survivors awaken, unharmed except for nosebleeds caused by the drop in air pressure. Seemingly, nothing has changed: the world below shows no signs of life. The plane lands in a deserted Los Angeles. Concluding that now the time rift has brought them a short distance into the future, the group takes shelter against a wall to avoid the airport's human traffic and wait for the present to catch up to them. A wave of rising noise and motion hits them and they find themselves in the present again.  Television film adaptation  The Langoliers was adapted for a two-part TV movie in 1994. The TV movie stars Kate Maberly, Kimber Riddle, Patricia Wettig, Mark Lindsay Chapman, Frankie Faison, Baxter Harris, Dean Stockwell, David Morse, Christopher Collet, and Bronson Pinchot. The movie version of The Langoliers, produced for broadcast on ABC-TV, was filmed almost exclusively in and around the Bangor International Airport in Bangor, Maine (where author Stephen King attended college) during the summer of 1994. King himself, echoing Alfred Hitchcock's famous numerous cameos, made a cameo appearance in the film as Craig Toomy's boss during Toomy's hallucination. =Secret Window, Secret Garden= Secret Window, Secret Garden is similar to King's earlier novel The Dark Half. Both are about authors who are thinly veiled analogues of King himself‚ÄîThad Beaumont in The Dark Half and Mort Rainey in Secret Window, Secret Garden. Plot Mort Rainey is a successful novelist in Maine. One day, he is confronted by a man from Mississippi named John Shooter who claims Mort plagiarized a story he wrote. Mort vehemently denies ever plagiarizing anything. Shooter leaves, but not before leaving his manuscript, \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden.\\" Mort throws the manuscript into the trash can. When Mort's housemaid recovers the manuscript‚Äîthinking it belongs to Mort‚Äîhe finally reads Shooter's story, discovering that it is almost identical to his short story \\"Sowing Season.\\" The only differences are the title, the character's name, the diction, and the ending. Mort is disturbed by these findings. Shooter returns a few days later. Having learned that \\"Sowing Season\\" was published two years before Shooter claimed to have written \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden,\\" Mort confronts Shooter with this information. An enraged Shooter accuses Mort of lying and demands proof, giving Mort three days to show him his published story. Overnight, he kills Mort's cat and burns down the house of Mort's ex-wife, which contained the magazine issue in which \\"Sowing Season\\" was published. Mort orders a new copy of the magazine. He also asks his caretaker Greg Carstairs to tail Shooter and to talk to a man named Tom Greenleaf, who drove past Mort and Shooter. Shooter, angry that Mort has involved other people in their business, kills both men and plants evidence framing Mort for the murders. Upon receiving the magazine and returning home, Mort finds that \\"Sowing Season\\" has been removed. Mort realizes that John Shooter is really his own split personality. Mort had created \\"Shooter\\" out of guilt for stealing a story early in his career titled \\"Crowfoot Mile\\" and had recently been suspected of another act of plagiarism, although he was innocent the second time. Tom had not seen Shooter while driving by‚Äîhe saw Mort, by himself. Mort realizes he burned down his own home, killed his own cat, and murdered two people. He blacks out. Fifteen minutes later he awakens, only to hear who he believes to be Shooter pulling into his driveway. Desperate for any sign of his own sanity, he rushes outside only to find his ex-wife, Amy. Devastated, he loses control of his body and mind to Shooter. Amy discovers that Mort has gone insane, having written the word \\"Shooter\\" all over the house. She goes to Mort's study, where \\"Shooter\\" attempts to kill her in an ambush. She manages to escape. \\"Shooter,\\" chasing Amy outside, is shot by her insurance agent. Mort becomes himself again, addresses Amy, and dies. Later, Amy and Ted Milner‚Äîa man she had an affair with before divorcing Mort‚Äîdiscuss her ex-husband's motives. She insists that Mort had become two people, one of them a character so vivid it became real. She then recalls something Tom witnessed‚Äîwhen he drove past Mort alone, he saw Shooter and Mort in his rear view mirror, but Shooter was transparent. Amy then reveals that while digging through Mort's house, she found Shooter's trademark hat. She left it right- side up on a trash bag. When she returned, she found a note from Shooter inside the overturned hat, revealing that he has traveled back to Mississippi with the story he came for, \\"Crowfoot Mile.\\" Amy remarks that Mort had created a character so vivid, he actually came to life. Adaptations A 2004 film adaptation called Secret Window was made, starring Johnny Depp, John Turturro, Maria Bello and Timothy Hutton. The storyline of the movie differs from that of the novel, most notably in their respective endings. In the movie, Mort kills his wife and her lover, while in the novel he is killed before he has a chance to do so. In the movie, after months it is shown that Mort grew corn in his wife's garden, where it is implied that he buried her and her lover, thus removing any proof that he murdered them. Another difference is the titles of the short stories: in the movie, Mort Rainey wrote a story called \\"Secret Window\\" and John Shooter wrote \\"Sowing Season.\\" The story in the movie version is set in upstate New York instead of Maine. A three-episode radio adaptation was broadcast in 2003 on BBC Radio 4 starring Henry Goodman, William Roberts, Barbara Barnes, Lee Montague and Kerry Shale. Inspiration King has been the subject of unfounded accusations of plagiarism. A woman claimed that King stole several of her story ideas and based characters from his books on her. All of her cases have been dismissed. In another incident, a deranged man broke into King's home, and when discovered by King's wife, claimed that King stole the plot of Misery from the intruder's aunt and that he had a bomb in the shoebox he was holding and was going to blow up the house. The fake bomb was made of pencils with paperclips wrapped around the erasers. =The Library Policeman= The Library Policeman tells of Sam Peebles and his battle against an age-old fear. Peebles is asked to give a speech to his local Rotary Club. An office assistant (Naomi Higgins) directs him to the public library to check out books that might help with his speechwriting. At the library, he receives a library card and assistance in finding books from an elderly librarian, Ardelia Lortz. Having noticed a series of disturbing posters in the children's section, including one featuring a frightening \\"Library Policeman\\" character, he discusses their appropriateness with Ardelia. After being rebuffed by her, Sam checks out the books with the warning that they must be returned on time or else \\"I'll have to send the Library Policeman after you.\\" The speech is a success, but Naomi informs Sam that Ardelia Lortz has been dead for many years. Ardelia, as a young woman, committed suicide in 1960 after murdering two children and a local deputy sheriff. The books are accidentally destroyed and a menacing Library Policeman terrorizes Sam at his house. Through Naomi, Sam meets Dave \\"Dirty Dave\\" Duncan, an alcoholic former sign painter and a former lover of Ardelia's. From Dave's recollections, Sam discovers that Ardelia is not a person but a being which feeds on fear and that Duncan was a sometimes unwilling companion/conspirator in helping her feed from the fear of children. Dave believes Ardelia is seeking revenge and a new host. While the trio attempt to stop Ardelia's return, Sam recalls a repressed memory: a man claiming to be a \\"Library Policeman\\" raped and threatened Sam when he was a young child in St. Louis. However, the new Library Policeman is not just a recreation of the man from Sam's past, but also an embodiment of Ardelia, who wants Sam as her new host. Dave dies defending Sam and Naomi from Ardelia. Sam and Naomi defeat the Library Policeman/Ardelia, only to discover that Ardelia has already attached to Naomi in the form of a blistery growth, \\"covered in a spiderweb skein of crisscrossing white threads ... a lump of pinkish jelly that throbbed and pulsed with the beat of her heart.\\" Sam removes the creature from Naomi's neck and destroys it under the wheels of a passing train. =The Sun Dog= Kevin Delevan receives a Sun 660 Polaroid camera for his fifteenth birthday. He discovers that there is something strange about the camera: the only pictures it produces are of a malicious black dog which seems to move closer with each shot as though to attack the photographer. On a recommendation, Kevin seeks help from Reginald \\"Pop\\" Merrill, the wealthy and unscrupulous owner of a junk shop in the town of Castle Rock, Maine. While just as unsettled by the phenomenon as Kevin, Merrill sees an opportunity to further his own interests; namely, selling the camera to a paranormal enthusiast for a great deal of money. He manages to switch out the camera for another of the same model, which Kevin destroys. Much to his dismay, however, Merrill cannot rid himself of the Sun as his customers either dismiss it as a fake or decline to purchase it due to the discomfort and unease they feel upon viewing the photographs. Furthermore, Merrill finds himself increasingly compelled to use the Sun ‚Äì the dog slowly advancing and transforming into something more savage and monstrous with every picture he takes. In the meantime, Kevin is plagued by recurring nightmares about the dog. Realizing that Merrill tricked him and the Sun was never destroyed, he sets out to prevent Merrill from taking any more pictures for fear that the dog will \\"break through\\" into the real world. By this point, the camera's influence over Merrill has caused him to lose his grip on sanity. After waking up one night to find himself holding the Sun and repeatedly pressing its trigger, Merrill resolves to smash it in the morning. However, he hallucinates that one of the cuckoo clocks hanging on the wall of his store is really the camera, and smashes the clock instead. Under the illusion that he's repairing a clock at his workbench, Merrill starts taking pictures again. At this moment, Kevin and his father arrive to confront Merrill, but they are too late to stop him. The dog tears its way out of the final photograph, killing Merrill in the process. Inspired by his nightmares, Kevin has brought another Sun with him, and just as the dog is about to release itself, he takes its picture, trapping it once more in the \\"Polaroid world\\". In the epilogue, Kevin gets a computer for his following birthday. In order to test its word processor function, he types \\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\\" Rather than a printout of this text, the page reads, \\"The dog is loose again. It is not sleeping. It is not lazy. It's coming for you, Kevin. It's very hungry. And it's VERY angry.\\" Reception Upon its release, Michael A. Morrison in Washington Post called the collection \\"exceptionally well crafted\\" with the exception of Sun Dog, praising King's \\"unexpected similes\\" and his use of \\"dreams to reveal character\\". Robert Chatain called it possibly King's best book and \\"a serious, heavyweight effort\\", characterising the tales as \\"rich\\" as well as \\"fast, tricky, even perverse, like carnival rides that look easy from the ground but turn unexpectedly nasty and vertiginous when we're up in the air\\". However, Josh Rubins in Entertainment Weekly graded the anthology a \\"C+\\" and considered it formulaic with \\"enthusiasm\\" and contemporary setting. Rubins compared a novella \\"The Langoliers\\" to‚Äîquoting characters of the novella‚Äîa \\"stupid disaster [movie]\\" and a \\"bad [television] movie.\\" He found \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden\\" bearably suspenseful with a \\"gimmicky, least convincing [finale].\\" He called \\"The Sun Dog\\" the \\"simplest, most distinctive story\\" and praised it as mostly \\"a delicious black comedy.\\" Andy Solomon in The New York Times commented that King's mass appeal comes \\"ironically from his cliched diction,\\" referring to the anthology's reliance on popular culture for descriptions.

It was collected in 1985 in the hardcover omnibus The Bachman Books, and has seen several reprints since, as both paperback and hardback. Set in a future dystopian America, ruled by a totalitarian and militaristic dictator, the plot revolves around the contestants of a grueling, annual walking contest. In 2000, the American Library Association listed The Long Walk as one of the 100 best books for teenage readers published between 1966 and 2000. While not the first of King's novels to be published, The Long Walk was the first novel he wrote, having begun it in 1966‚Äì67 during his freshman year at the University of Maine some eight years before his first published novel Carrie was released in 1974. Plot summary =Premise= One hundred teenage boys join an annual walking contest called \\"The Long Walk\\" or just \\"The Walk\\". Each contestant, called a \\"Walker\\", must maintain a speed of at least four miles per hour; if he drops below that speed for 30 seconds, he receives a verbal warning. A Walker who slows down again after receiving three warnings is \\"ticketed\\". The meaning of this action is intentionally kept vague at first, but it soon becomes clear that \\"buying a ticket\\" means to be shot dead by soldiers riding in half-tracks along the roadside. Walkers may be shot immediately for certain serious violations, such as trying to leave the road or attacking the half-track, and are given warnings for minor violations such as interfering with one another. The soldiers use electronic equipment to precisely determine a Walker's speed. A Walker clears one warning for every hour that he goes without receiving a new one.Google Books: The Long Walk by Stephen King page 14 The event is run by a character known as \\"The Major\\". The Major appears at the beginning of the Walk to encourage the boys and start them on their way, and then occasionally thereafter. While the Walkers initially greet him with awe and respect, they ridicule him in later appearances. The Walk begins at the Maine/Canada border at 9:00 on the morning of May 1 and travels down the east coast of the United States until the winner is determined. There are no stops, rest periods, or established finish line, and the Walk does not pause for any reason (including bad weather or darkness); it ends only when one last Walker is left alive. According to the rules, the Walkers can obtain aid only from the soldiers, who distribute canteens of water and belts packed with food concentrates just before the Walk begins. They may request a fresh canteen at any time, and new food supplies are distributed at 9:00 every morning. Walkers may bring anything they can carry, including food or additional clothing, but cannot receive aid from bystanders. They are allowed to have bodily contact with onlookers as long as they stay on the road. While they cannot physically interfere with one another to detrimental effect, they can help each other, provided they stay above four miles per hour. The winner receives \\"The Prize\\": anything he wants for the rest of his life. It is implied that many past winners have died soon after the Walk, due to its hazardous mental and physical challenges. The Long Walk is not only a physical trial, but a psychological one, as the Walkers are continually pressed against the idea of death and their own mortality. Furthermore, every step of the way they begin to realize that they are inevitably walking toward their demise. One contestant from past years is described as having actually crawled for a distance of two miles at four miles per hour after suffering cramps in both feet. Several characters suffer mental breakdowns, one of them killing himself by tearing out his throat, and most characters experience some mental degeneration from the stress and lack of sleep. =Story= The protagonist of the novel is Raymond Davis Garraty, a 16-year-old boy from the town of Pownal in Androscoggin County, Maine. Garraty's getting by during the walk knowing that he will eventually see his mom and his girlfriend Jan in the crowd. Early on, he falls in with several other boys‚Äîincluding Peter McVries, Arthur Baker, Hank Olson, Collie Parker, Pearson, Harkness, and Abraham‚Äîwho refer to themselves as \\"The Musketeers\\". Another Walker, Gary Barkovitch, quickly establishes himself as an external antagonist, as he quickly angers his fellow Walkers with multiple taunts of \\"dancing on their graves\\". This results in the death of a fellow Walker, Rank, who is ticketed after repeatedly trying to assault Barkovitch. Lastly, the most charismatic and mysterious Walker is a boy named Stebbins. Throughout the Walk, Stebbins establishes himself as a loner, observing the ground beneath him as he listens to fellow Walkers' complaints, seemingly unaffected by the mental and physical strains. The only character Stebbins truly interacts with is Garraty. In one conversation, Garraty alludes to Alice in Wonderland, likening Stebbins to the Caterpillar. Stebbins, however, corrects him: he believes himself to be more of a White Rabbit type. Along the road, the Walkers learn that one of their number, Scramm‚Äîinitially the heavy odds-on favorite to win the Walk‚Äîis married. When Scramm gets pneumonia, the remaining Walkers agree that the winner will use some of the Prize to take care of his pregnant widow, Cathy. Members of the public interfering with the Walkers can receive an \\"interference\\" ticket. This nearly occurs when the mother of a Walker named Percy tries, on several occasions, to get onto the road and find her son (at her last attempt, he has already been killed for attempting to sneak away). Only the intervention of the local police keeps her from being executed. The second instance is when a spectator's dog runs across the road in front of the Walkers and is shot. However, one man is able to throw the Walkers watermelon slices before being hauled away by the police rather than the soldiers; several Walkers receive third warnings after taking the watermelon, but none of them are shot. Garraty becomes closest to McVries, a boy with a prominent facial scar who speculates that his own reason for joining the Walk is a subconscious death wish. When Garraty suffers a short mental breakdown following the death of one of his friends, McVries takes several warnings in order to get him moving again. By the morning of the fifth day, the Walk has progressed into Massachusetts, the first time in 17 years that it has done so. There are only seven Walkers left. Earlier, Stebbins revealed to Garraty and McVries that he is the illegitimate son of the Major. Stebbins states he used to think the Major was unaware of his existence, but it turns out that the Major has numerous illegitimate children nationwide. Four years earlier, the Major took Stebbins to the finish of a Long Walk; now Stebbins feels that the Major has set him up to be \\"the rabbit\\", motivating others to walk farther to prolong the race, just as rabbits are used in dog races. Stebbins' plan, upon winning the Walk, is to ask to be \\"taken into [his] father's house\\" as his Prize. Finally, Garraty decides to give up after realizing that Stebbins has shown almost no weaknesses over the duration of the Walk. Garraty catches up with Stebbins to tell him this, but before he can speak, Stebbins collapses and dies; thus Garraty is declared the winner. Unaware of the celebration going on around him, Garraty gets up from Stebbins' side and keeps on walking, believing the race to still continue, as he hallucinates a dark figure not far ahead that he thinks is another competitor. He ignores a jeep coming toward him in which the Major comes to award him the victory, thinking it is a trespassing vehicle. When a hand touches his shoulder, Garraty somehow finds the strength to run. Characters ; Raymond \\"Ray\\" Davis Garraty (#47) : The novel's main character, a 16-year-old boy from the town of Pownal, Maine. He has \\"straw- colored\\" hair and is a tall, well-built boy. He knows how to cook, dance, and knit and never did any sort of sports before the Walk. His motivation for participating in the Walk is not as explicit as McVries or Baker and is very much up for interpretation. He is shown to be na√Øve but has a strong will to live and doesn't put up with argumentation from the other Walkers. He is presented multiple times as being the quintessential \\"Maine's Own\\" boy, unlike the others. His father was \\"squaded\\" and his brother died from pneumonia and his mother heavily shelters him. He has a girlfriend by the name of Jan mentioned throughout the novel, culminating in the sight of her and his mother in Freeport, Maine. He is the one who eventually wins the Long Walk, though the novel leaves it ambiguous whether he lives or dies. ; Peter McVries (#61) : Peter McVries is a well-muscled and athletically fit young man with a sardonic sense of humor and a cynical attitude. He is dark-haired and has a large scar on one cheek. He creates the idea for the Musketeer group and is friendly with Garraty, even saving his life several times throughout the Walk. Continually providing advice for Garraty, he admits early that he will probably lose this game, and entered it with suicidal intentions. He reveals that he was once in love with a girl named Priscilla, but the relationship fell apart due to financial differences, leaving him with a prominent facial scar. His masochistic streak manifests several times when McVries incurs the anger of the other Walkers with his \\"musketeer\\" attitude, his random attitude shifts between confiding in others and pushing them away, and an antagonistic relationship to Barkovitch. Pearson remarks that the Walk is a form of self- punishment for McVries and that he should have a \\"Beat Me Hard\\" sign around his neck. During one speculative moment, he tells Garraty that at some point in the game when he can no longer go on, he may simply sit down and wait to die. When the Walk comes down to the final three‚Äîhimself, Garraty, and Stebbins‚Äîhe keeps his word and sits cross-legged in the street. Garraty attempts to save him before he gets killed by the soldiers. ;Stebbins (#88) : Stebbins is the most mysterious of the originally named group. He is an eccentric who wears a bright green sweater and purple pants. He has light blond hair and is described to be very skinny. Throughout the story, he has been noted by Garraty to possess more information about the Walk than the others. Quietly, he establishes himself as a loner and walks separately from the group, at the rear, talking to no one. Garraty is strangely drawn to Stebbins: at first, he is sure Stebbins will be the first Walker to be ticketed, but soon he becomes convinced that Stebbins will win. Stebbins has many strange mannerisms, often talking in riddles to Garraty to teach him a vital lesson‚Äîand then later recanting them as lies. After Scramm's death, Stebbins becomes the odds-on favorite, having shown no sign of fatigue and being described as \\"like diamonds\\" and impossible to wear down. He receives only four warnings throughout the Walk prior to his breakdown at the end. He reveals to Garraty that he is the Major's illegitimate child, and acts as a \\"rabbit\\" to encourage other Walkers to keep running. His goal was to publicly acknowledge him: to \\"be taken into my father's house\\". Stebbins eventually succumbs and falls dead after desperately clawing at Garraty. ; Arthur \\"Art\\" Baker (#3) : Art Baker is one of the first Walkers to befriend Garraty during the Long Walk and is also one of the Musketeers. Friendly and sincere, he is the most honest character during the Walk, and is the least prone to speaking either cryptically or in metaphors. He is incredibly kind and despite the anger the Walk instills in the boys, he is hesitant to actually hurt anyone. He has golden-blond hair and a childlike face. He comes from a lower-class family of undertakers in Louisiana and is mentioned to have several siblings. He is also one of the last Musketeers (aside from Garraty and McVries) to die. After a short bout of delirium, he stumbles to the ground, cutting his forehead and rupturing something internally so that he develops a severe nosebleed. Right before he is killed, he asks Garraty for a final favor if Garraty wins the Long Walk. He wants a \\"lead-lined\\" casket‚Äîa reference to an earlier conversation about Baker's late uncle, an undertaker. Garraty is sobbing and asking him to \\"walk a little longer\\" but Baker can't. He asks Garraty not to watch the soldiers shoot him, then shakes Garraty's hand, turns around, and is killed. Garraty reacts so strongly to his death that he can barely keep walking. ; Hank Olson (#70) : From early on, Hank Olson cracks jokes and insults the other competitors. He believes he has an edge over the other Walkers, having been told by the Major to \\"Give 'em hell.\\" He has a somewhat friendly relationship with the Musketeers but makes fun of Barkovitch from the very start, although he does not hate him to the degree that McVries does. He puts up a front of cockiness but is later subdued by the Walk and the possibility of his imminent death. Olson tires very early in the game, becoming a \\"hollow shell\\". Despite his exhaustion, he continues to walk, seemingly oblivious to the world. Garraty compares Olson's demeanor to that of the Flying Dutchman as he is manned even when \\"the entire crew is dead\\". Stebbins refers to Olson as a demonstration of the power of the mind to control the body, because although he has physically succumbed to fatigue, Olson can still walk. Later, he climbs on top of the half-track, taking a rifle from a soldier. He is repeatedly shot in the abdomen by the soldiers to discourage others from joining him. To the shock of his fellow Walkers, he manages to stand and walk again. Eventually, his intestines begin to spill out of his stomach, and he dies after lifting his hands to the sky and shouting \\"I DID IT WRONG!\\" ; Gary Barkovitch (#5) : Barkovitch is from Washington DC. He is described as being olive-skinned and dark-haired and wears a yellow rain hat multiple times during the book. He cements himself as a loud-mouth Walker whom everyone hopes to outlast. He first provokes another boy named Rank, leading to an altercation resulting in Rank's death. Because of this, the other Walkers turn against Barkovitch and refer to him as \\"killer\\". McVries states several times that his only goal in life is to outlast Barkovitch. Garraty is more understanding of Barkovitch, as he (Barkovitch) begins to lose his mind. Barkovitch admits that he wishes he had friends, and that he just doesn't know how to act any other way. He then agrees to help donate some of the winning proceeds to Scramm's young wife. Later, he reverts to his previous demeanor and hassles the other Walkers. The others realize that Barkovitch has finally lost his mind, the intensity of the Walk being too much for him. At some point during the night, several shots are heard, and a Walker (Pearson) wonders if it is Barkovitch who has been killed. Barkovitch, however, yells from the back of the crowd he's not finished yet. He then screams in agony and tears out his own throat, thereby denying the soldiers their chance to kill him, even though they shoot him anyway in what can be little more than a symbolic gesture. ; Collie Parker (#?) : Parker is from Joliet, Illinois and has an almost ridiculous amount of state pride. Blond and burly, he is the roughneck of the Walkers and repeatedly voices his disgust towards the soldiers, the game, and the crowds. He does not make friends easily because of his \\"tough guy\\" attitude but is very close with Abraham, who loses his will to live after Parker's death. He is shown to be prickly and rude, but unlike Barkovitch, he apologizes for it and says he has a \\"loose lip\\" after realizing he's genuinely hurt Garraty. He continually makes remarks on the \\"damn Maine weather\\", ribs Garraty about coming from \\"the most fucked-up state in the fifty-one\\", and uses excessive profanity. A gunshot awakens Garraty from his doze, and to his surprise, he sees Parker standing atop the half-track, having taken a rifle from a soldier during a shift change and killed him. As he yells for the other boys to join the fight, another soldier shoots him in the back, splattering his internal organs all over his clothes. Parker fires two shots as he falls to the ground, the bullets ricocheting into the crowd, then tries and fails to say \\"bastards\\" before dying. ; Scramm (#85) : A likable young man, depicted as a simple soul who dropped out of school and married early a woman named Cathy, Scramm is the \\"Vegas favorite\\", with nine-to-one odds. Despite being the predicted winner of this year's Long Walk, having been described as \\"moose-like\\" and able to walk long distances with little difficulty, Scramm succumbs to pneumonia. Realizing his time is almost up, he thanks his fellow Walkers for agreeing to help his wife with their financial problems and informs them that he is ready to die. He then catches up to Mike and Joe, two Walkers who are brothers and Hopi Indians. Mike has developed stomach cramps. Scramm, Mike and Joe walk and talk before deciding on a course of action. Scramm and Mike head to the side of the road towards the crowd. They then flip off the crowd, yell insults, and sit in conversation, though speaking different languages, before being killed by the soldiers; Joe is shot sometime later. ; Abraham (#2) : Abraham is introduced early on as his name is one of the first called by The Major, but isn't as big a part of the storyline until later on. He is described as having red hair and a very deep voice. He is good-humored, often making absurd jokes such as commenting what sex might be like in the afterlife. He joined the Long Walk not being serious about it and wrote his essay to get in a joking manner, but was admitted anyway, to his shock. He said that everyone back home thought it was hilarious. He is close friends with Parker and friendly with Baker. He dies by catching Scramm's cold and freezing to death. ; Pearson : Pearson strikes up an early friendship with the Musketeers. He is described as having glasses and dark hair. He cracks jokes and is reasonably cheery. He usually makes commentary on things which Garraty responds to and is often a voice of reason among Garraty and his friends. As he begins to tire out, he mentions that he just wants to lie down in a field and compose a poem. He is shot offscreen. ; Harkness : Harkness establishes himself as unique early on, saying that when or if he wins he is going to write a book about his experiences. He also wears glasses and sports a crew cut. He dies when his feet cramp up as a group of farm kids watch, and Garraty remarks sadly that he'll never get to write his book. ; Davidson : A boy who is described as being very attractive except for some acne on his forehead. He tells stories to Garraty and his friends about his odd past sexual encounters. He is shot and blood stains his face, which Garraty is horrified by because of his initial attractiveness. ; Jan : Ray Garraty's girlfriend from home, with whom he had a steady relationship. He establishes Jan early on as a symbol of his life, and as encouragement to keep walking, but does not talk much about her personality. When the news that Garraty has been picked as a Walker is revealed, Jan is extremely distraught and fights with Garraty in an unsuccessful attempt to have him back out of the event. In the first half of the book he determines to keep walking until he reaches his hometown, so he can see her. When the Walkers finally reach the town, Garraty can only grasp her hand briefly before being ripped away by McVries to save him from being shot by the soldiers. ; Priscilla : McVries' mentioned girlfriend. She is presented as being money-hungry and greedy. McVries proposed to her for the sake of making her feel like a \\"self-centered little bitch\\" because she made him feel like he was a failure; i.e. he was jealous. He felt like that because he made less money than her, even though he worked harder at the same factory. They broke up, and McVries tried taking her to the bed, but she cut his face open with a Paddington Bear letter opener, afraid he was going to rape her. McVries: \\"Like I was germs and I'd infect her\\". ; The Major : Little to no biographical information is presented about the Major within the book, but due to Stebbins' testimony, it is inferred that he is at the very least in his mid-to-late thirties and has been running the Long Walk for at least 13 years, but likely much longer. A pristine, methodical man known for his punctuality and decorum, he is depicted as never appearing in public without wearing reflective sunglasses (it is speculated that a possible reason for this is that his eyes are \\"extremely light-sensitive\\"). According to Garraty's father, he is \\"a society-supported sociopath\\", and he bears a strong physical resemblance to depictions of Big Brother from George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. He strategically reappears whenever the Walkers break a major record and at predetermined sections of the track, and while the Walkers continue to build animosity for the Major, calling him a murderer and sadist, they often cannot help but cheer him during each appearance. He appears at the end of the race, ready to offer Garraty the Prize, but is mostly unrecognizable to Garraty, who initially mistakes him for a \\"damn fool\\" who should not commit a capital crime by driving on the road. ; The crowd : The Long Walk spectators play an increasingly significant role as the Walk progresses. While no one is allowed to witness the beginning of the race (it is rumored to ruin the Walkers' concentration), they are allowed to appear with more frequency by the Squads as the race progresses. Bystanders come from all over the nation to cheer Walkers with signs, and frequently yell slogans to encourage them. Garraty sees several calling him \\"Maine's own\\" and several stating \\"Go Go Garraty\\", which he initially takes as strong encouragement. As the race progresses, the crowd influence becomes more intrusive, with several bystanders trying to give aid to the Walkers by selling cokes, giving away watermelon, or in one case, a Walker's mother attempts to pull her son from the race. The Walkers alternately embrace the crowd and members of it, notably Garraty taking a warning to neck with a girl and Gribble responding to sexual advances that lead to his demise. As the volume, sheer numbers, and intensity of the crowds build, the Walkers become more hostile and paranoid. Finally, as Stebbins predicted, the Walkers begin to ignore the crowds almost completely, as the finalists are focused only on the road and each other. The crowd cheers wildly whenever a Walker is \\"ticketed\\", and eagerly collect any souvenirs they can find from the Walkers, including their excrement. Adaptations In 1988, George A. Romero was approached to direct the film adaptation, but it never happened.Lilja's Library ‚Äì The World of Stephen King ‚Äì Unproduced Screenplays By 2007, Frank Darabont had secured the rights to the film adaptation of the novel. He said that he would \\"get to it one day\\". He planned to make it low- budget, \\"weird, existential, and very self contained\\".Frank Darabont Interview Kirby Heyborne narrated an audiobook adaptation of the novel in 2010 for Blackstone Audio. In April 2018, it was announced that New Line Cinema would develop a film adaptation of the novel. Darabont's rights to the film had lapsed, and filmmaker James Vanderbilt stepped in to write and produce the film with Bradley Fischer and William Sherak of the Mythology Entertainment production company.\\"Stephen King‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Long Walk‚Äô in Development at New Line\\" On May 21, 2019, New Line announced that Andr√© √òvredal would direct the adaptation.

R. R. Tolkien's Middle- earth. It first appeared in print in his high fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings, where the Fellowship of the Ring encounter one known as Durin's Bane in the Mines of Moria. Balrogs appear also in Tolkien's The Silmarillion and other posthumously published books. Balrogs are tall and menacing beings who can shroud themselves in fire, darkness, and shadow. They are armed with fiery whips \\"of many thongs\\",The Silmarillion and its early drafts speak frequently of the whips of fire. The Lays of Beleriand describe Morgoth's prisoners tortured by Balrogs with scourges; and the Balrog in Moria (The Fellowship of the Ring, \\"The Bridge of Khazad-d√ªm\\") is armed explicitly with a \\"whip of many thongs\\" or strands. and occasionally used long swords. In Tolkien's later conception, they could not be readily vanquished‚Äîa certain stature was required by the would-be hero. Only dragons rivalled their capacity for ferocity and destruction,The Book of Lost Tales, Part II, \\"Turambar and the Foal√≥k√´\\", p.85: \\"yet of all are they [dragons] the most powerful, save it be the Balrogs only.\\" and during the First Age of Middle-earth, they were among the most feared of Morgoth's forces. Tolkien invented the name \\"Balrog\\", providing an in-universe etymology for it as a word in his invented Sindarin language. He may have gained the idea of a fire demon from his philological study of the Old English word Sigelwara, which he studied in detail in the 1930s. Balrogs appear in the film adaptations of The Lord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi and Peter Jackson, and in computer and video games based on Middle-earth. Context According to the fictional history in The Silmarillion, the evil Vala Melkor corrupted lesser Maiar (angelic beings) to his service in the days of his splendour before the making of Arda.The Silmarillion, \\"Valaquenta\\"The Silmarillion, ch. 3 \\"Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\\" Upon the awakening of the Elves, the Valar captured Melkor and destroyed his fortresses Utumno and Angband. But they overlooked the deepest pits, where, with many of Melkor's other allies, the Balrogs fled into hiding. When Melkor returned to Middle-earth from Valinor, now bearing the epithet Morgoth, he was attacked by the evil giant spider Ungoliant; his scream drew the Balrogs out of hiding to his rescue. Characteristics Tolkien's conception of Balrogs changed over time. In all his early writing, they are numerous. A host of a thousand is mentioned in the Quenta Silmarillion,The Lost Road and Other Writings, p. 312, \\"there came Balrogs one thousand\\". while at the storming of Gondolin Balrogs in the hundreds ride on the backs of the Dragons.The Book of Lost Tales, Part II, p. 170. They are roughly of twiceThe Book of Lost Tales, Part II, p. 194: \\"... it pierced the Balrog's belly nigh his own face (for that demon was double his stature) ...\\". For comparison, other Maiar are human size: Ol√≥rin (Gandalf), Melian. In Morgoth's Ring p.69, a note by Tolkien states: \\"The Valar.... most often used shapes of 'human' form, though taller (not gigantic) and more magnificent.\\" human size,The Treason of Isengard, p. 197. and were occasionally killed in battle by Elves and Men.The Book of Lost Tales Part II, p.179 \\"the number of Balrogs that perished was a marvel and a dread to the hosts of Melkor, for ere that day never had any of the Balrogs been slain by the hand of Elves or Men.\\" They were fierce demons, associated with fire, armed with fiery whips of many thongs and claws like steel, and Morgoth delighted in using them to torture his captives.The Book of Lost Tales, Part II, p. 169. In the published version of The Lord of the Rings, however, Balrogs became altogether more sinister and more powerful. Christopher Tolkien notes the difference, saying that in earlier versions they were \\"less terrible and certainly more destructible\\". He quotes a very late margin noteMorgoth's Ring, p.80. that was not incorporated into the text saying \\"at most seven\\" ever existed;The Book of Lost Tales, Part II, \\"The Fall of Gondolin\\", p. 212‚Äì3. though in the Annals of Aman, written as late as 1958, Melkor still commands \\"a host of Balrogs\\".Morgoth's Ring, pp. 75, 79 In later writings they ceased to be creatures, but are instead Maiar, lesser Ainur like Gandalf or Sauron, spirits of fire whom Melkor had corrupted before the creation of the World. Power of the order of Gandalf's was necessary to destroy them, as when Gandalf at the Bridge of Khazad-d√ªm tells the others \\"This is a foe beyond any of you.\\"The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 5 \\"The Bridge of Khazad-d√ªm\\" As Maiar, only their physical forms could be destroyed. Tolkien says of the Valar (including the Maiar) that they can change their shape at will, and move unclad in the raiment of the world, meaning invisible and without form.The Silmarillion, \\"Ainulindal√´\\", p. 21. But it seems that Morgoth, Sauron, and their associated Maiar could lose this ability: Morgoth, for example, was unable to heal his burns from the Silmarils or wounds from Fingolfin and the eagle Thorondor;The Silmarillion ch. 18 \\"Of the Ruin of Beleriand and the Fall of Fingolfin\\" and Sauron lost his ability to assume a fair-seeming form after his physical body was destroyed in the downfall of N√∫menor.The Return of the King, Appendix A, Part I, Section (i). Tolkien does not address this specifically for Balrogs, though in his later conception, as at the Bridge of Khazad-d√ªm, the Balrog appears \\"like a great shadow, in the middle of which was a dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater\\". Though previously the Balrog had entered the \\"large square chamber\\" of Mazarbul, at the Bridge of Khazad-d√ªm it \\"drew itself to a great height, and its wings spread from wall to wall\\" in the vast hall. The Balrog's size and shape, therefore, are not given precisely. When Gandalf threw it from the peak of Zirakzigil, the Balrog \\"broke the mountain-side where he smote it in his ruin\\".The Two Towers, book 3, ch. 5 \\"The White Rider\\" Whether Balrogs had wings (and if so, whether they could fly) is unclear. This is due both to Tolkien's changing conception of Balrogs, and to the imprecise but suggestive and possibly figurative description of the Balrog that confronted Gandalf. The Balrog of Moria used a flaming sword (\\"From out of the shadow a red sword leapt flaming\\") and a many- thonged whip that \\"whined and cracked\\" in its battle with Gandalf. In The Silmarillion, they also used black axes and maces.The Silmarillion, \\"Of the Fifth Battle\\", pp. 193-4. Earlier writings also speak of steel claws and iron mail.The Book of Lost Tales, Part II, pp. 169, 181, 194. In earlier drafts of The Lord of the Rings, some further indications of Tolkien's evolving conceptions appear, as when At this writing Tolkien contemplated an edict of the Valar concerning Balrogs, having Gandalf challenge the Balrog by saying \\"It is forbidden for any Balrog to come beneath the sky since Fionw√´ son of Manw√´ overthrew Thangorodrim.\\" Individual Balrogs =Gothmog= Gothmog at the Storming of GondolinThe Book of Lost Tales, Part II, \\"The Fall of Gondolin\\": \\"‚Ä¶ seven dragons of fire are come with Orcs about them and Balrogs upon them ‚Ä¶\\" Gothmog is developed in successive versions of Silmarillion material. He is physically massive and strong, and in one version he is some 12 feet tall.The Book of Lost Tales, Part II, p. 194: \\"... it pierced the Balrog's belly nigh his own face (for that demon was double his stature) ...\\" He wields a black axe and whip of flame as his weapons. He holds the titles of the Lord of the Balrogs, the High Captain of Angband, and Marshal of the Hosts. In the Second Battle, Dagor-nuin-Giliath, he leads a force that ambushes F√´anor and wounds him mortally.The Silmarillion, ch. 13 \\"Of the Return of the Noldor\\" He leads Balrogs, Orc-hosts, and Dragons as Morgoth's commander in the field in the Fifth Battle, N√≠rnaeth Arnoediad, and slays Fingon, High King of the Noldor. In that same battle, he captures H√∫rin of Dor-l√≥min, who had slain his personal guard of Battle-trolls, and brings him to Angband.The Silmarillion, ch. 20, \\"Of the Fifth Battle: Nirnaeth Arnoediad\\" As Marshal of the Hosts, he is in command of the Storming of Gondolin. He is about to kill Tuor when Ecthelion of the Fountain, a Noldorin Elf-lord, intervenes. Gothmog fights Ecthelion in single combat, and they kill each other.The Silmarillion, ch. 23, \\"Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin\\" In The Book of Lost Tales, Tolkien describes Kosomot, the original version of Gothmog, as a son of Morgoth and the ogress Fluithuin or Ulbandi.The Book of Lost Tales, Part I, p. 93. Gothmog is Sindarin for \\"Dread Oppressor\\".The Lost Road and Other Writings, \\"The Etymologies\\", p. 359, 372. Kosomot is often considered Gothmog's Quenya name;The Book of Lost Tales, Part II, p. 216. however, in the Quenya name-list of The Fall of Gondolin another version appears, Kosomoko.Parma Eldalamberon, No. 15, p.26, the 'Name List to The Fall of Gondolin'. In Tolkien's early Lay of the Children of H√∫rin is \\"Lungorthin, Lord of Balrogs\\". This might be another name for Gothmog, though Christopher Tolkien thought it more likely that Lungorthin was simply \\"a Balrog lord\\".The Lays of Beleriand, p. 102. =Durin's Bane= Durin's Bane, the Balrog in Moria This Balrog appears in The Lord of the Rings, encountered by the Fellowship of the Ring in the Mines of Moria. It survived the defeat of Morgoth in the War of Wrath, escaping to hide beneath the Misty Mountains.The Return of the King, Appendix A (III). For more than five millennia, the Balrog remained in its deep hiding place at the roots of Caradhras,The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 4 \\"A Journey in the Dark\\" one of the Mountains of Moria, until in the Third Age, the mithril-miners of the Dwarf-kingdom of Khazad-d√ªm disturbed it. The Balrog killed Durin VI, the Dwarf-King of Khazad-d√ªm, whereafter it was called Durin's Bane by the Dwarves.The Return of the King, Appendix B, \\"The Tale of Years\\", \\"The Third Age\\" entry for 1980. Avarice, principally for mithril, drove the dwarves to go too deep and awaken the Balrog. The Dwarves attempted to fight the Balrog, but its power was far too great for them. In their efforts to hold Khazad-d√ªm against it, many Dwarves were killed: Durin's successor King N√°in ruled for only a year. The survivors were forced to flee. This disaster reached the Silvan Elves of Lothl√≥rien, many of whom fled the \\"Nameless Terror\\". From this time Khazad-d√ªm was known as Moria, Sindarin for \\"Black Pit\\" or \\"Black Chasm\\".The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 3 \\"The Ring Goes South\\"The Return of the King, Appendix F, Part II For another 500 years, Moria was left to the Balrog; though according to Unfinished Tales, Orcs crept in soon after the Dwarves were driven out, leading to Nimrodel's flight.Unfinished Tales, \\"The Tale of Galadriel and Celeborn\\", p. 241. Sauron began to put his plans for war into effect, and he sent Orcs and Trolls to the Misty Mountains to bar the passes During the reign of Thr√°in II, the Dwarves attempted to retake Moria in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, culminating in the Battle of Azanulbizar before the eastern gate of Moria. This was a victory for the Dwarves, but the Balrog prevented them from reoccupying Moria. D√°in II Ironfoot, having slain the Orc Azog near the gate, perceived the terror of the Balrog within and warned Thr√°in that Moria was unachievable until some greater force could remove the Balrog. The Dwarves departed and resumed their exile. Despite D√°in's warning, Balin made another attempt to retake Moria. His party was initially successful in starting a colony, but was massacred a few years later. The Fellowship of the Ring travelled through Moria on the quest to destroy the One Ring in Mount Doom. They were attacked in the Chamber of Mazarbul by Orcs. The Fellowship fled through a side door, but when the wizard Gandalf the Grey tried to place a \\"shutting spell\\" on the door to block the pursuit behind them, the Balrog entered the chamber on the other side and cast a \\"terrible\\" counterspell. Gandalf spoke a word of Command to stay the door, but the door shattered and the chamber collapsed. Gandalf was severely weakened by this encounter. The company fled with him, but the Orcs and the Balrog, taking a different route, caught up with them at the Bridge of Khazad-d√ªm. The Elf Legolas instantly recognized the Balrog and Gandalf tried to hold the bridge against it. As Gandalf faced the Balrog, he proclaimed, \\"You cannot pass, flame of Ud√ªn!\\", and broke the bridge beneath the Balrog. As it fell, the Balrog wrapped its whip about Gandalf's knees, dragging him to the brink. As the Fellowship looked on in horror, Gandalf cried \\"Fly, you fools!\\" and plunged into the darkness below. After a long fall, the two crashed into a deep subterranean lake, which extinguished the flames of the Balrog's body; however it remained \\"a thing of slime, stronger than a strangling snake\\". They fought in the water; the Balrog clutched at Gandalf to strangle him, and Gandalf hewed the Balrog with his sword, until finally the Balrog fled into the primordial tunnels of Moria's underworld. Gandalf pursued the monster for eight days, until they climbed to the peak of Zirakzigil, where the Balrog was forced to turn and fight, its body erupting into new flame. Here they fought for two days and nights. In the end, the Balrog was defeated and cast down, breaking the mountainside where it fell \\"in ruin\\". Gandalf himself died shortly afterwards, but he returned to Middle-earth with greater powers, as Gandalf the White, \\"until his task was finished\\". Critics such as Jerram Barrs have recognised this as a transfiguration similar to that of Jesus Christ, suggesting Gandalf's prophet-like status. The critic Clive Tolley notes that the contest between Gandalf and the Balrog on Durin's bridge somewhat recalls a shamanistic contest, but that a far closer parallel is medieval vision literature, giving the example of St Patrick's Purgatory, and even Dante's Divine Comedy. Origins = In-universe = The name \\"Balrog\\", but not the meaning, emerges early in Tolkien's work: it appears in the Fall of Gondolin, one of the earliest texts Tolkien wrote (ca. 1918). An early list of names described Balrog as \\"an Orc-word with no pure equivalent in Tolkien's invented language of Quenya: 'borrowed Malaroko-' \\".The Lost Road and Other Writings, p. 404. In Gnomish (another of Tolkien's invented languages), Balrog is parsed as balc 'cruel' + graug 'demon', with a Quenya equivalent Malkarauke. Variant forms of the latter include Nalkarauke and Valkarauke.The Book of Lost Tales, Part I, Appendix: Names in the The Book of Lost Tales, p. 250. By the 1940s, when Tolkien began writing The Lord of the Rings, he had come to think of Balrog as Noldorin balch 'cruel' + rhaug 'demon', with a Quenya equivalent Malarauko (from nwalya- 'to torture' + rauko 'demon').The Lost Road and Other Writings, \\"The Etymologies\\", entries for √ëGWAL (p. 377) and RUK (p. 384). The last etymology, appearing in the invented languages Quendi and Eldar, derives Balrog as the Sindarin translation of the Quenya form Valarauko (Demon of Might). This etymology was published in The Silmarillion.The Silmarillion, Index, p. 353.Morgoth's Ring, \\"Annals of Aman\\", Section 2. Gandalf on the bridge of Khazad-d√ªm calls the Balrog \\"flame of Ud√ªn\\" (Ud√ªn being the Sindarin name of Morgoth's fortress Utumno). = Real-world origins = Tolkien's Sigelwara etymologies led to major strands in his writings on Middle-earth, including the idea of the Balrog. Tolkien was a professional philologist, a scholar of comparative and historical linguistics.The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, #165 to Houghton Mifflin, 30 June 1955 The Balrog and other concepts in his writings derived from the Old English word Sigelwara, used in texts such as the Codex Junius to mean \\"Aethiopian\\". He wondered why the Anglo- Saxons would have had a word with this meaning, conjecturing that it had formerly had a different meaning. He emended the word to Sigelhearwan, and in his essay \\"Sigelwara Land\\",J. R. R. Tolkien, \\"Sigelwara Land\\" Medium Aevum Vol. 1, No. 3. December 1932 and Medium Aevum Vol. 3, No. 2. June 1934. explored in detail the two parts of the word. He stated that Sigel meant \\"both sun and jewel\\", the former as it was the name of the Sun rune *sowil≈ç (·õã), the latter connotation from Latin sigillum, a seal. He decided that Hearwa was related to Old English heor√∞, \\"hearth\\", and ultimately to Latin carbo, \\"soot\\". He suggested from all this that Sigelhearwan implied \\"rather the sons of Muspell than of Ham\\", a class of demons in Northern mythology \\"with red-hot eyes that emitted sparks and faces black as soot\\". The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey states that this both \\"helped to naturalise the Balrog\\" and contributed to the Silmarils, which combined the nature of the sun and jewels. The Aethiopians suggested to Tolkien the Haradrim, a dark southern race of men.The Treason of Isengard, ch. 25, pp. 435, 439 note 4 (comments by Christopher Tolkien) A real-world etymological counterpart for the word \\"Balrog\\" existed long before Tolkien's languages: the Norse b√°l \\"fire\\"; an epithet of the Norse god Odin was B√°leygr, \\"fire-eyed\\".Gr√≠mnism√°l, stanzas 46-48 Adaptations The Balrog in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring The Balrog in Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated version had large wings like those of a bat. Peter Jackson's 2001 and 2002 films The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers had similar wings, expressing its \\"satanic, demonic nature\\". Earlier artists such as Ted Nasmith had depicted Balrogs without wings; Jackson's films used the design of Tolkien illustrator John Howe, making wings standard, in the same way that Jackson has made pointed ears standard for elves. Balrogs appear in Middle-earth computer and video games and merchandise. In the real-time strategy game The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth, and its sequel, both based on Jackson's movies, the Balrog can use its wings, although only in short leaps. In the role-playing game The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age, also based on the Jackson movies, the Balrog uses its wings to fly into the air, and comes crashing down, sending a damaging shockwave of flames at the player. In another game based on Jackson's movies, The Lord of the Rings: Conquest, the Balrog is a playable hero. A Balrog features in King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard's 2017 album Murder of the Universe (2017) as a giant reanimated monster. Songwriter Stu Mackenzie explained: \\"It might not be the Balrog from Middle Earth, but he is a sort of fire demon.\\" References =Primary= ::This list identifies each item's location in Tolkien's writings. =Secondary=  Sources     * * Category:Middle-earth Maiar Category:Fictional demons and devils Category:Literary characters introduced in 1954 Category:Literary villains de:Figuren in Tolkiens Welt#Balrogs he:◊û◊ô◊ê◊®#◊ë◊ú◊®◊ï◊í◊ô◊ù ","title":"Balrog"},{"id":"64044","title":"Michael Heseltine"},{"id":"64045","text":"Crossing over occurs between prophase I and metaphase I and is the process where two homologous non-sister chromatids pair up with each other and exchange different segments of genetic material to form two recombinant chromosome sister chromatids. It can also happen during mitotic division, which may result in loss of heterozygosity. Crossing over is essential for the normal segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. Crossing over also accounts for genetic variation, because due to the swapping of genetic material during crossing over, the chromatids held together by the centromere are no longer identical. So, when the chromosomes go on to meiosis II and separate, some of the daughter cells receive daughter chromosomes with recombined alleles. Due to this genetic recombination, the offspring have a different set of alleles and genes than their parents do. In the diagram, genes B and b are crossed over with each other, making the resulting recombinants after meiosis Ab, AB, ab, and aB. Thomas Hunt Morgan's illustration of crossing over (1916) A double crossing over Chromosomal crossover, or crossing over, is the exchange of genetic material during sexual reproduction between two homologous chromosomes' non-sister chromatids that results in recombinant chromosomes. It is one of the final phases of genetic recombination, which occurs in the pachytene stage of prophase I of meiosis during a process called synapsis. Synapsis begins before the synaptonemal complex develops and is not completed until near the end of prophase I. Crossover usually occurs when matching regions on matching chromosomes break and then reconnect to the other chromosome. Crossing over was described, in theory, by Thomas Hunt Morgan. He relied on the discovery of Frans Alfons Janssens who described the phenomenon in 1909 and had called it \\"chiasmatypie\\". The term chiasma is linked, if not identical, to chromosomal crossover. Morgan immediately saw the great importance of Janssens' cytological interpretation of chiasmata to the experimental results of his research on the heredity of Drosophila. The physical basis of crossing over was first demonstrated by Harriet Creighton and Barbara McClintock in 1931. (Original paper) The linked frequency of crossing over between two gene loci (markers) is the crossing-over value . For fixed set of genetic and environmental conditions, recombination in a particular region of a linkage structure (chromosome) tends to be constant and the same is then true for the crossing-over value which is used in the production of genetic maps.King R. C., Stransfield W. D. (1998): Dictionary of genetics. Oxford University Press, New York, Oxford, ; . Origins There are two popular and overlapping theories that explain the origins of crossing- over, coming from the different theories on the origin of meiosis. The first theory rests upon the idea that meiosis evolved as another method of DNA repair, and thus crossing-over is a novel way to replace possibly damaged sections of DNA. The second theory comes from the idea that meiosis evolved from bacterial transformation, with the function of propagating diversity. In 1931, Barbara McClintock discovered a triploid maize plant. She made key findings regarding corn's karyotype, including the size and shape of the chromosomes. McClintock used the prophase and metaphase stages of mitosis to describe the morphology of corn's chromosomes, and later showed the first ever cytological demonstration of crossing over in meiosis. Working with student Harriet Creighton, McClintock also made significant contributions to the early understanding of codependency of linked genes. =DNA repair theory= Crossing over and DNA repair are very similar processes, which utilize many of the same protein complexes. In her report, ‚ÄúThe Significance of Responses of the Genome to Challenge‚Äù, McClintock studied corn to show how corn's genome would change itself to overcome threats to its survival. She used 450 self- pollinated plants that received from each parent a chromosome with a ruptured end. She used modified patterns of gene expression on different sectors of leaves of her corn plants show that transposable elements (‚Äúcontrolling elements‚Äù) hide in the genome, and their mobility allows them to alter the action of genes at different loci. These elements can also restructure the genome, anywhere from a few nucleotides to whole segments of chromosome. Recombinases and primases lay a foundation of nucleotides along the DNA sequence. One such particular protein complex that is conserved between processes is RAD51, a well conserved recombinase protein that has been shown to be crucial in DNA repair as well as cross over. Several other genes in D. melanogaster have been linked as well to both processes, by showing that mutants at these specific loci cannot undergo DNA repair or crossing over. Such genes include mei-41, mei-9, hdm, spnA, and brca2. This large group of conserved genes between processes supports the theory of a close evolutionary relationship. Furthermore, DNA repair and crossover have been found to favor similar regions on chromosomes. In an experiment using radiation hybrid mapping on wheat's (Triticum aestivum L.) 3B chromosome, crossing over and DNA repair were found to occur predominantly in the same regions. Furthermore, crossing over has been correlated to occur in response to stressful, and likely DNA damaging, conditions =Links to bacterial transformation= The process of bacterial transformation also shares many similarities with chromosomal cross over, particularly in the formation of overhangs on the sides of the broken DNA strand, allowing for the annealing of a new strand. Bacterial transformation itself has been linked to DNA repair many times. The second theory comes from the idea that meiosis evolved from bacterial transformation, with the function of propagating genetic diversity. . Thus, this evidence suggests that it is a question of whether cross over is linked to DNA repair or bacterial transformation, as the two do not appear to be mutually exclusive. It is likely that crossing over may have evolved from bacterial transformation, which in turn developed from DNA repair, thus explaining the links between all three processes. Chemistry A current model of meiotic recombination, initiated by a double-strand break or gap, followed by pairing with a homologous chromosome and strand invasion to initiate the recombinational repair process. Repair of the gap can lead to crossover (CO) or non-crossover (NCO) of the flanking regions. CO recombination is thought to occur by the Double Holliday Junction (DHJ) model, illustrated on the right, above. NCO recombinants are thought to occur primarily by the Synthesis Dependent Strand Annealing (SDSA) model, illustrated on the left, above. Most recombination events appear to be the SDSA type. Meiotic recombination may be initiated by double-stranded breaks that are introduced into the DNA by exposure to DNA damaging agents, or the Spo11 protein. One or more exonucleases then digest the 5‚Äô ends generated by the double-stranded breaks to produce 3‚Äô single-stranded DNA tails (see diagram). The meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1 and the general recombinase Rad51 coat the single-stranded DNA to form nucleoprotein filaments. The recombinases catalyze invasion of the opposite chromatid by the single- stranded DNA from one end of the break. Next, the 3‚Äô end of the invading DNA primes DNA synthesis, causing displacement of the complementary strand, which subsequently anneals to the single-stranded DNA generated from the other end of the initial double-stranded break. The structure that results is a cross- strand exchange, also known as a Holliday junction. The contact between two chromatids that will soon undergo crossing-over is known as a chiasma. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral structure which can be 'pulled' by other recombinases, moving it along the four-stranded structure. =MSH4 and MSH5= The MSH4 and MSH5 proteins form a hetero-oligomeric structure (heterodimer) in yeast and humans. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH4 and MSH5 act specifically to facilitate crossovers between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The MSH4/MSH5 complex binds and stabilizes double Holliday junctions and promotes their resolution into crossover products. An MSH4 hypomorphic (partially functional) mutant of S. cerevisiae showed a 30% genome wide reduction in crossover numbers, and a large number of meioses with non exchange chromosomes. Nevertheless, this mutant gave rise to spore viability patterns suggesting that segregation of non-exchange chromosomes occurred efficiently. Thus in S. cerevisiae proper segregation apparently does not entirely depend on crossovers between homologous pairs. =Chiasma= The grasshopper Melanoplus femur-rubrum was exposed to an acute dose of X-rays during each individual stage of meiosis, and chiasma frequency was measured. Irradiation during the leptotene-zygotene stages of meiosis (that is, prior to the pachytene period in which crossover recombination occurs) was found to increase subsequent chiasma frequency. Similarly, in the grasshopper Chorthippus brunneus, exposure to X-irradiation during the zygotene-early pachytene stages caused a significant increase in mean cell chiasma frequency. Chiasma frequency was scored at the later diplotene-diakinesis stages of meiosis. These results suggest that X-rays induce DNA damages that are repaired by a crossover pathway leading to chiasma formation. Consequences The difference between gene conversion and chromosomal crossover. In most eukaryotes, a cell carries two versions of each gene, each referred to as an allele. Each parent passes on one allele to each offspring. An individual gamete inherits a complete haploid complement of alleles on chromosomes that are independently selected from each pair of chromatids lined up on the metaphase plate. Without recombination, all alleles for those genes linked together on the same chromosome would be inherited together. Meiotic recombination allows a more independent segregation between the two alleles that occupy the positions of single genes, as recombination shuffles the allele content between homologous chromosomes. Recombination results in a new arrangement of maternal and paternal alleles on the same chromosome. Although the same genes appear in the same order, some alleles are different. In this way, it is theoretically possible to have any combination of parental alleles in an offspring, and the fact that two alleles appear together in one offspring does not have any influence on the statistical probability that another offspring will have the same combination. This principle of \\"independent assortment\\" of genes is fundamental to genetic inheritance. However, the frequency of recombination is actually not the same for all gene combinations. This leads to the notion of \\"genetic distance\\", which is a measure of recombination frequency averaged over a (suitably large) sample of pedigrees. Loosely speaking, one may say that this is because recombination is greatly influenced by the proximity of one gene to another. If two genes are located close together on a chromosome, the likelihood that a recombination event will separate these two genes is less than if they were farther apart. Genetic linkage describes the tendency of genes to be inherited together as a result of their location on the same chromosome. Linkage disequilibrium describes a situation in which some combinations of genes or genetic markers occur more or less frequently in a population than would be expected from their distances apart. This concept is applied when searching for a gene that may cause a particular disease. This is done by comparing the occurrence of a specific DNA sequence with the appearance of a disease. When a high correlation between the two is found, it is likely that the appropriate gene sequence is really closer.Genetic Recombination Non-homologous crossover Crossovers typically occur between homologous regions of matching chromosomes, but similarities in sequence and other factors can result in mismatched alignments. Most DNA is composed of base pair sequences repeated very large numbers of times. These repetitious segments, often referred to as satellites, are fairly homogenous among a species. During DNA replication, each strand of DNA is used as a template for the creation of new strands using a partially- conserved mechanism; proper functioning of this process results in two identical, paired chromosomes, often called sisters. Sister chromatid crossover events are known to occur at a rate of several crossover events per cell per division in eukaryotes. Most of these events involve an exchange of equal amounts of genetic information, but unequal exchanges may occur due to sequence mismatch. These are referred to by a variety of names, including non- homologous crossover, unequal crossover, and unbalanced recombination, and result in an insertion or deletion of genetic information into the chromosome. While rare compared to homologous crossover events, these mutations are drastic, affecting many loci at the same time. They are considered the main driver behind the generation of gene duplications and are a general source of mutation within the genome. The specific causes of non-homologous crossover events are unknown, but several influential factors are known to increase the likelihood of an unequal crossover. One common vector leading to unbalanced recombination is the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs). DSBs are often repaired using homology directed repair, a process which involves invasion of a template strand by the DSB strand (see figure below). Nearby homologous regions of the template strand are often used for repair, which can give rise to either insertions or deletions in the genome if a non-homologous but complementary part of the template strand is used. Sequence similarity is a major player in crossover ‚Äì crossover events are more likely to occur in long regions of close identity on a gene. This means that any section of the genome with long sections of repetitive DNA is prone to crossover events. The presence of transposable elements is another influential element of non- homologous crossover. Repetitive regions of code characterize transposable elements; complementary but non-homologous regions are ubiquitous within transposons. Because chromosomal regions composed of transposons have large quantities of identical, repetitious code in a condensed space, it is thought that transposon regions undergoing a crossover event are more prone to erroneous complementary match-up; that is to say, a section of a chromosome containing a lot of identical sequences, should it undergo a crossover event, is less certain to match up with a perfectly homologous section of complementary code and more prone to binding with a section of code on a slightly different part of the chromosome. This results in unbalanced recombination, as genetic information may be either inserted or deleted into the new chromosome, depending on where the recombination occurred. While the motivating factors behind unequal recombination remain obscure, elements of the physical mechanism have been elucidated. Mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, for instance, are a well-known regulatory family of proteins, responsible for regulating mismatched sequences of DNA during replication and escape regulation. The operative goal of MMRs is the restoration of the parental genotype. One class of MMR in particular, MutSŒ≤, is known to initiate the correction of insertion-deletion mismatches of up to 16 nucleotides. Little is known about the excision process in eukaryotes, but E. coli excisions involve the cleaving of a nick on either the 5‚Äô or 3‚Äô strand, after which DNA helicase and DNA polymerase III bind and generate single-stranded proteins, which are digested by exonucleases and attached to the strand by ligase. Multiple MMR pathways have been implicated in the maintenance of complex organism genome stability, and any of many possible malfunctions in the MMR pathway result in DNA editing and correction errors. Therefore, while it is not certain precisely what mechanisms lead to errors of non-homologous crossover, it is extremely likely that the MMR pathway is involved.

It was first published in July 1828, thus making it the oldest weekly magazine in the world.Why The Spectator is the world's oldest weekly magazine The Spectator. It is owned by David and Frederick Barclay, who also own The Daily Telegraph newspaper, via Press Holdings. Its principal subject areas are politics and culture. Its editorial outlook is generally supportive of the Conservative Party, although regular contributors include some outside that fold, such as Frank Field, Rod Liddle and Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. Alongside columns and features on current and not-so-current affairs, the magazine also contains arts pages on books, music, opera, and film and TV reviews. Editorship of The Spectator has often been a step on the ladder to high office in the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom. Past editors include Boris Johnson (1999‚Äì2005) and other former cabinet members Ian Gilmour (1954‚Äì1959), Iain Macleod (1963‚Äì1965), and Nigel Lawson (1966‚Äì1970). In late 2008, the weekly Spectator Australia was launched. This offers 12 pages of \\"Unique Australian Content\\" (including a separate editorial page) in addition to the full UK contents. In early 2018, Spectator USA was launched as a website. A monthly US print version debuted in October 2019. In 2020, The Spectator became both the longest-lived current affairs magazine in historyThe Spectator becomes the World's longest lived current affairs magazine and the first magazine ever to publish 10,000 issues.The Spectator's 10,000th issue History The Spectators founder, Scottish reformer Robert Stephen Rintoul, former editor of the Dundee Advertiser and the London-based Atlas, launched the paper on 6 July 1828. Rintoul consciously revived the title from the celebrated, if short- lived, daily publication by Addison & Steele.1711 and All That (Spectator article) As he had long been determined \\"to edit a perfect newspaper\\", Rintoul initially insisted on \\"absolute power\\" over content, commencing a long-lasting tradition of the paper's editor and proprietor being one and the same person. Although he wrote little himself, \\"every line and word passed through the alembic of his brain.\\" The Spectators political outlook in its first thirty years reflected Rintoul's liberal-radical agenda. Despite its political stance it was widely regarded and respected for its non-partisanship, in both its political and cultural criticism. Rintoul initially advertised his new title as a \\"family paper\\", the euphemistic term for a journal free from strong political rhetoric. However, events soon compelled him to confess that it was no longer possible to be \\"a mere Spectator\\". Two years into its existence, The Spectator came out strongly for wide-reaching parliamentary reform: it produced supplements detailing vested interests in the Commons and Lords, coined the well-known phrase \\"The Bill, the whole Bill and nothing but the Bill\\", and helped drive through the Great Reform Act of 1832. Virulently anti- Tory in its politics, The Spectator strongly objected to the appointment of the Duke of Wellington as Prime Minister, condemning him as \\"a Field Marshal whose political career proves him to be utterly destitute of political principle ‚Äì whose military career affords ample evidence of his stern and remorseless temperament.\\".The Spectator, 3 January 1835 Ironically, the paper spent its first century at premises on Wellington Street (now Lancaster Place). However, despite its robust criticism of the Conservative leader Robert Peel for several years, The Spectator rallied behind him when he split the Tory party by successfully repealing the Corn Laws. Rintoul's fundamental principles were freedom of the individual, freedom of the press and freedom of trade, of religious tolerance and freedom from blind political adherence. The magazine was vocal in its opposition to the First Opium War (1839‚Äì1842), commenting: \\"all the alleged aims of the expedition against China are vague, illimitable, and incapable of explanation, save only that of making the Chinese pay the opium-smugglers.\\" and \\"There does not appear to be much glory gained in a contest so unequal that hundreds are killed on one side and none on the other. What honour is there in going to shoot men, certain that they cannot hurt you? The cause of the war, be it remembered, is as disreputable as the strength of the parties is unequal. The war is undertaken in support of a co-partnery of opium-smugglers, in which the Anglo-Indian Government may be considered as the principal partner.\\" In 1853, The Spectators lead book reviewer George Brimley published an anonymous and unfavourable notice of Charles Dickens's Bleak House, typical of the paper's enduring contempt for him as a \\"popular\\" writer \\"amusing the idle hours of the greatest number of readers; not, we may hope, without improvement to their hearts, but certainly without profoundly affecting their intellects or deeply stirring their emotions.\\"The Spectator, 24 September 1853, reprinted in Philip Collins (ed), Charles Dickens: The Critical Heritage, Taylor and Francis, 2005 [1971], pp. 295‚Äì98, 297. Rintoul died in April 1858, having sold the magazine two months earlier. The circulation had already been falling, under particular pressure from its new rival, The Saturday Review. Its new owner, the 27-year-old John Addyes Scott, kept the purchase quiet, but Rintoul's death made explicit the change of guard. His tenure was unremarkable, and subscribers continued to fall.Butterfield, David (2020) 10,000 Not Out: The History of The Spectator 1828‚Äì2020. London: Unicorn, pp.40‚Äì41. By the end of the year Scott sought his escape, selling the title for ¬£4200 in December 1858 to two British-based Americans, James McHenry and Benjamin Moran. While McHenry was a businessman, Moran was an Assistant Secretary to the American ambassador, George M. Dallas; they saw their purchase as a means to influence British opinion on American affairs. The editor was Thornton Hunt, a friend of Moran who had also worked for Rintoul. Hunt was also nominally the purchaser, having been given the necessary monies in an attempt by McHenry and Moran to disguise the American ownership. Circulation declined with this loss of independence and inspirational leadership, as the views of James Buchanan, then president of the US, came to the fore. Within weeks,The last pre-American ownership issue appears to have been that of 25 December 1858. the editorial line followed Buchanan's pronouncements in being \\"neither pro-slavery nor pro-abolitionist. To unsympathetic observers Buchanan's policy seemed to apportion blame for the impasse on the slavery question equally on pro-slavery and abolitionist factions ‚Äì and rather than work out a solution, simply to argue that a solution would take time. The Spectator now would publicly support that 'policy.'\\". This set it at odds with most of the British press but gained it the sympathy of expatriate Americans in the country. Richard Fulton notes that from then until 1861, \\"the Spectators commentary on American affairs read like a Buchanan administration propaganda sheet.\\" and that this represented a volte-face. Under Hunt's tenure, The Spectator may even have been steered by financial support from the court of Napoleon III.Butterfield, David (2020) 10,000 Not Out: The History of The Spectator 1828-2020. London: Unicorn, pp.44-5. =Meredith Townsend, Richard Holt Hutton and St Loe Strachey= The need to promote the Buchanan position in Britain had been reduced as British papers such as The Times and The Saturday Review turned in his favour, fearing the potential effects of a split in the Union. As Abraham Lincoln was set to succeed the vacillating Buchanan, the owners decided to stop pumping money into a loss-making publication: as Moran confided to his diary, \\"it don't pay, never did since Hunt became its owner.\\"S.A. Wallace and F.E. Gillespie (eds), The Journal of Benjamin Moran, 1857‚Äì1865 (Chicago, 1948) Vol. 1, p.763. On 19 January 1861, The Spectator was sold to a journalist, Meredith Townsend, for the marked-down sum of ¬£2000. Though not yet thirty, Townsend had spent the previous decade as an editor in India, and was prepared to restore to the paper an independent voice in a fast-changing world. From the outset, Townsend took up an anti-Buchanan, anti-slavery position, arguing that his unwillingness to act decisively had been a weakness and a contributor to the problems apparent in the US. He soon went into partnership with Richard Holt Hutton, the editor of The Economist, whose primary interests were literature and theology. Hutton's close friend William Gladstone later called him \\"the first critic of the nineteenth century\\". Townsend's writing in The Spectator confirmed him as one of the finest journalists of his day, and he has since been called \\"the greatest leader writer ever to appear in the English Press.\\" The two men remained co-proprietors and joint editors for 25 years, taking a strong stand on some of the most controversial issues of their day. They supported the Federalists against the South in the American Civil War, an unpopular position which, at the time, did serious damage to the paper's circulation, reduced to some 1,000 readers. In time, the paper regained readers when the victory of the North validated its principled stance. They also launched an all-out assault on Benjamin Disraeli, accusing him in a series of leaders of jettisoning ethics for politics by ignoring the atrocities committed against Bulgarian civilians by Turkey in the 1870s.See In 1886, The Spectator parted company with Gladstone when he declared his support for Irish Home Rule. Committed to defending the Union ahead of the Liberal Party line, Townsend and Hutton aligned themselves with the Liberal Unionist wing. As a result, H.H. Asquith (the future Prime Minister), who had served as a leader-writer for ten years, left his post. Townsend was succeeded by a young journalist named John St Loe Strachey, who would remain associated with the paper for the next 40 years. When Hutton died in 1897, Strachey became co-owner with Townsend; by the end of the year Strachey was made sole editor and proprietor. As chief leader-writer, general manager, literary critic and all things beside, Strachey embodied the spirit of The Spectator until the 1920s. Among his various schems were the establishment of a Spectator Experimental Company, to show that new soldiers could be trained up to excellence in six months, the running of a Cheap Cottage Exhibition, which laid the foundations for Letchworth Garden City, and the impassioned defence of Free Trade against Joseph Chamberlain's protectionist 'Tariff Reform' programme. Within two years he had doubled the paper's circulation, which peaked at 23,000. In the early decades of the twentieth century it was heralded as \\"the most influential of all the London weeklies\\". The First World War put the paper and its editor under great strain: after the conflict it seemed to be behind the times, and circulation began to fall away. Even the introduction of signed articles, overturning the paper's fixed policy of anonymity for its first century, did little to help. After years of illness, Strachey decided at the end of 1924 to sell his controlling interest in the paper to his recently appointed business manager, Sir Evelyn Wrench. Though he gained a second wind as a novelist, Strachey died two years later in 1928. 1925‚Äì1975 =Evelyn Wrench and Wilson Harris= For his first year as proprietor, Wrench appointed John (Jack) Atkins his editor, who had worked on the paper for the last two decades, acting as editor during Strachey's recurrent bouts of illness. But the relationship did not work: as Atkins lamented to his long-standing friend, Winston Churchill, Wrench 'continually wants to interfere and he is very ignorant'. Wrench duly took over the editorship in 1926, successfully channeling the enthusiasm of Strachey. His global connections helped secure interviews with Henry Ford, Mahatma Gandhi and Benito Mussolini. Perhaps his most remembered achievement as editor of The Spectator was the campaign to ease unemployment in the mining town of Aberdare, one of the worst hit by the crisis of 1928, when joblessness reached 40% in South Wales. Within three months, the paper's appeal for the town's relief raised over ¬£12,000 (the equivalent of about ¬£500,000 today). A statuette of an Aberdare miner, presented in gratitude to The Spectator, still sits in the editor's office, bearing the inscription: \\"From the Townsfolk of Aberdare in Grateful Recognition: 'The Greatest of These is Love'\\". Wrench retired as editor in 1932 (though he remained the magazine's proprietor), appointing the political editor Wilson Harris his successor. Under Harris The Spectator became increasingly outspoken on developing international politics in the 1930s, in particular on the rise of fascism. Beneath a reader's letter referring to the Nazi Party as \\"peaceful, orderly and kindly\\", Harris printed the following reply: > No facts in recent history are established more incontestably ... than the > numerous cases of murder, assault, and various forms of intimidation for > which the National Socialist Party in Germany has been responsible ... The > organized economic boycott of the Jews is the climax. The Spectator has > consistently shown itself a friend of Germany, but it is a friend of freedom > first. Resort to violence is not condoned by styling it revolution.The > Spectator, 7 April 1933 Harris, however, broadly supported Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement. He praised the Munich agreement, explaining later that he believed \\"even the most desperate attempt to save the peace was worthwhile\\". When the conflict broke, the team abandoned their Gower Street office for Harmondsworth, but within a few days decided to return to London: the basement caught fire from shrapnel, and the printers were bombed, but the paper continued to appear each week. Although the Second World War required The Spectator to downgrade its size and paper quality, its readership doubled during the conflict, exceeding 50,000. From 1945 to 1950, Harris served as MP for Cambridge: although he stood as an independent, this was the first formal overlap between The Spectator and the House of Commons. In February 1947, when a fuel shortage suspended the publication of weekly magazines, The Spectator appeared in an abridged form over two successive Thursdays on page 2 of the Daily Mail. =Ian Gilmour= In 1954, Wrench and his co-owner Angus Watson sold The Spectator to the barrister Ian Gilmour, who restored the Spectator tradition of simultaneously acting as editor. Having a libertarian and pro- European outlook, he \\"enlivened the paper and injected a new element of irreverence, fun and controversy\\". He was critical of both Anthony Eden's and Harold Macmillan's governments, and while supporting the Conservatives was also friendly to the Hugh Gaitskell wing of the Labour Party. Gilmour lent The Spectators voice to the campaign to end capital punishment in Britain, writing an incensed leader attacking the hanging of Ruth Ellis in 1955, in which he claimed \\"Hanging has become the national sport\\", and that the home secretary Gwilym Lloyd George, for not reprieving the sentence, \\"has now been responsible for the hanging of two women over the past eight months\\". The Spectator opposed Britain's involvement in the Suez crisis in 1956, strongly criticising the government's handling of the debacle. The paper went on to oppose Macmillan's government's re-election in 1959, complaining: \\"The continued Conservative pretence that Suez was a good, a noble, a wise venture has been too much to stomach ... the Government is taking its stand on a solid principle: 'Never admit a mistake.'\\" The paper says that it was influential in campaigning for the decriminalisation of homosexuality.How The Spectator fought to decriminalise homosexuality (Spectator article) It gave vocal support to the proposals of the Wolfenden Committee in 1957, condemning the \\"utterly irrational and illogical\\" old laws on homosexuality: \\"Not only is the law unjust in conception, it is almost inevitably unjust in practice\\". In March the same year, Jenny Nicholson, a frequent contributor, wrote a piece on the Italian Socialist Party congress in Venice, which mentioned three Labour Party politicians (Aneurin Bevan, Richard Crossman and Morgan Phillips) \\"who puzzled the Italians by filling themselves like tanks with whisky and coffee \\"The Spectator, 1 March 1957 All three sued for libel, the case went to trial and The Spectator was forced to make a large payment in damages and costs, a sum well over the equivalent of ¬£150,000 today. It has since emerged that \\"all three plaintiffs, to a greater or lesser degree, perjured themselves in court\\". Gilmour gave up the editorship in 1959, in part to abet his chance of selection as a Conservative MP. He appointed his deputy Brian Inglis, who introduced to the magazine a fresh spirit of political and satirical satire. In 1959‚Äîmuch to the embarrassment of Gilmour (who remained the owner)‚ÄîThe Spectator advised either voting for the Liberal Party or tactically abstaining. Despite a marked increase in sales, Gilmour felt that The Spectator was losing its political edge, so replaced him in 1962 with Iain Hamilton. Hamilton successfully balanced a keener focus on current affairs with some more raucous contributions: the young team behind Private Eye were commissioned to write a mock eight-page \\"Child's Guide to Modern Culture\\". Much to the shock of Hamilton and the Spectator staff, Gilmour replaced Hamilton in 1963 with Iain Macleod, the Conservative MP who had resigned from the cabinet on the controversial appointment of Sir Alec Douglas-Home to succeed Harold Macmillan as Prime Minister. A widely circulated letter, signed by Spectator journalists and board members, berated Gilmour for mistreating an admired editor and appointing an active politician who could jeopardise the independence of the magazine: \\"We believe strongly that The Spectator, with its long and honourable history of independent opinion, should not be tossed about at the whim of the proprietor or lose its independence by identification with a narrow political faction.\\"Letter first printed in The Times of 2 Nov. 1963. =\\"The Tory Leadership\\" article= Two months into his post, in January 1964, Macleod intensified the shock by revealing the behind-the-scenes machinations of the Conservative party. In a long article entitled \\"The Tory Leadership\\", ostensibly a review of a new book (The Fight for the Tory Leadership) by Randolph Churchill, Macleod laid out his version of events in great detail. In disclosing, from the horse's mouth, the mysterious circumstances of Douglas-Home's appointment, the article caused an immediate sensation. Churchill's book was all but obliterated by the review, which said that \\"four fifths\\" of it \\"could have been compiled by anyone with a pair of scissors, a pot of paste and a built-in prejudice against Mr Butler and Sir William Haley\\".The Spectator, 17 January 1964 That week's edition, bearing the headline \\"Iain Macleod, What Happened\\", sold a record number of copies. =Nigel Lawson, George Gale and Harry Creighton= The \\"Tory Leadership\\" article prompted a furious response from many Spectator readers and caused Macleod, for a time, to be shunned by political colleagues. He eventually regained his party's favour, however, and rejoined the shadow cabinet in the same year. On his appointment as Shadow Chancellor in 1965, he stepped down as editor on the last day of the year, to be replaced by Nigel Lawson. Sometimes called \\"The Great Procrastinator\\" because of his tendency to leave writing leaders until the last minute, Lawson had been City editor for The Sunday Telegraph and Alec Douglas-Home's personal assistant during the 1964 general election. Largely due to Lawson, in 1966 The Spectator opposed America's increasing military commitment in Vietnam. In a signed article he estimated \\"the risks involved in an American withdrawal from Vietnam are less than the risks in escalating a bloody and brutal war\\". In 1967, Ian Gilmour, who by then had joined parliament and was already finding the proprietorship a hindrance in political life, sold The Spectator to Harry Creighton for ¬£75,000. In 1970, Creighton replaced Lawson as editor (there had been growing resentment between the two men) with George Gale. Gale shared Creighton's political outlook, in particular his strong opposition to the Common Market, and much of the next five years was spent attacking the pro-EEC prime minister Edward Heath, treating his eventual defeat by Margaret Thatcher with undisguised delight. Gale's almost obsessive opposition to the EEC and antagonistic attitude towards Heath began to lose the magazine readers. In 1973 Creighton took over the editorship himself, but was, if possible, even less successful in stemming the losses. Circulation fell from 36,000 in 1966 to below 13,000. As one journalist who joined The Spectator at that time said: \\"It gave the impression, an entirely accurate one, of a publication surviving on a shoestring\\". George Gale later remarked that Creighton had only wanted the job to get into Who‚Äôs Who. 1975‚Äì2005 =Henry Keswick and Alexander Chancellor= In 1975 Creighton sold The Spectator to Henry Keswick, again for ¬£75,000 (Creighton sold the 99 Gower Street premises separately, so the magazine moved to 56 Doughty Street). Keswick was chairman of the Jardine Matheson multinational corporation. He was drawn to the paper partly because he harboured political aspirations (the paper's perk as a useful stepping stone to Westminster was, by now, well established), but also because his father had been a friend of Peter Fleming, its well-known columnist (under the name \\"Strix\\"). Keswick gave the job of editor to \\"the only journalist he knew\\", Alexander Chancellor, an old family friend and his mother's godson, with whom he had been at Eton and Cambridge. Before then, Chancellor had worked at Reuters news agency and had been a scriptwriter and reporter for ITN. In spite of his relative inexperience, he was to become known as \\"one of the best editors in the history of The Spectator\\". Chancellor's editorship of the paper relied principally on a return to earlier values. He adopted a new format and a more traditional weekly style, with the front page displaying five cover lines above the leader. Most significantly, he recognised the need \\"to bring together a number of talented writers and, with the minimal of editorial interference, let them write\\". To this end he persuaded Auberon Waugh (who had been sacked by Nigel Lawson) to return from the New Statesman, and enticed Richard West and Jeffrey Bernard from the same magazine. Another columnist recruited by Chancellor was Taki Theodoracopulos whose column ‚ÄòHigh Life‚Äô was then printed beside Bernard's ‚ÄòLow Life‚Äô. Taki's column, frequently criticised for its content by the press,Matthew Bell \\"What's the point of Taki if he isn't offensive any more?\\", The Independent on Sunday, 16 May 2010; Leader: \\"Selective spectator\\", The Guardian, 21 October 2004. remains in the paper. In September 1978, a 96-page issue was released to mark The Spectators 150th anniversary. William Rees-Mogg congratulated the paper in a Timess leading article, praising it in particular for its important part in \\"the movement away from collectivism\\". Charles Moore Chancellor was replaced by the 27-year-old Charles Moore in February 1984, after the magazine's then owner, Algy Cluff, had become concerned that The Spectator was \\"lacking in political weight\\" and considered Chancellor to be \\"commercially irresponsible\\". Moore had been a leader writer at The Daily Telegraph before Chancellor recruited him to The Spectator as political commentator. Under Moore, the paper became more political than it had been under Chancellor. The new editor adopted an approach that was, in general, pro-Margaret Thatcher, while showing no restraint in opposing her on certain issues. The paper called the Anglo-Irish Agreement \\"a fraudulent prospectus\\" in 1985, came out against the Single European Act, and, in 1989, criticised the handover of Hong Kong to China. Moore wrote that, if Britain failed to allow the city's UK passport holders right of abode in Britain, \\"we shall have to confess that, for the first time in our history, we have forced Britons to be slaves.\\"The Spectator, 10 June 1989 Moore also introduced several new contributors, including a restaurant column by Nigella Lawson (the former editor's daughter), and a humorous column by Craig Brown. When Taki was briefly imprisoned for cocaine possession Moore refused to accept his resignation, explaining publicly: \\"We expect our High Life columnist to be high some of the time.\\" The Spectator changed hands again in 1985, by which time it was facing financial meltdown, having an accumulated an overdraft of over ¬£300,000. Cluff had reached the conclusion that the paper \\"would be best secured in the hands of a publishing group\\", and sold it to Australian company John Fairfax Ltd, which promptly paid off the overdraft. With the support of its new proprietor, the paper was able to widen its readership through subscription drives and advertising, reaching a circulation of 30,000 in 1986, exceeding the circulation of the New Statesman for the first time. The magazine was again sold in 1988, after an uncertain period during which several candidates, including Rupert Murdoch, attempted to buy the magazine. Moore wrote to Murdoch, saying: \\"Most of our contributors and many of our readers would be horrified at the idea of your buying The Spectator. They believe you are autocratic and that you have a bad effect on journalism of quality ‚Äì they cite The Times as the chief example.\\" The Spectator was bought by the Telegraph Group. =Dominic Lawson and Frank Johnson= Moore resigned the editorship in 1990 to become deputy editor of The Daily Telegraph. He was replaced by his own deputy editor, Dominic Lawson‚Äîthe former editor's son. Shortly after becoming editor, Lawson became responsible for the resignation of a cabinet minister when he interviewed the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Nicholas Ridley. During the interview, Ridley described the proposed Economic and Monetary Union as \\"a German racket designed to take over the whole of Europe\\",The Spectator, 14 July 1990 and seemed to draw comparisons between the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, and Adolf Hitler. The interview appeared in the issue of 14 July 1990, the cover of which showed a cartoon by Nicholas Garland that showed Ridley painting a crude comb-over and a Hitler moustache onto a poster of Kohl. Ridley resigned from Thatcher's government immediately. The Spectator caused controversy in 1994 when it printed an article entitled \\"Kings of the Deal\\" on a claimed Jewish influence in Hollywood, written by William Cash, who at the time was based in Los Angeles and working mainly for The Daily Telegraph. The Telegraph had considered the article too risky to publish, but Lawson thought Cash's idea was as old as Hollywood itself and that Lawson's being Jewish would mitigate adverse reactions to publication. There was, however, considerable controversy. Although owner Conrad Black did not personally rebuke Lawson, Max Hastings, then editor of The Daily Telegraph, wrote with regard to Black, who also owned The Jerusalem Post at the time, \\"It was one of the few moments in my time with Conrad when I saw him look seriously rattled: 'You don't understand, Max. My entire interests in the United States and internationally could be seriously damaged by this'.\\"\\"If Conrad Black was a bully ‚Äì I never saw it\\", The Telegraph. The article was defended by some conservatives. John Derbyshire, who says he has \\"complicated and sometimes self-contradictory feelings about Jews\\", wrote on National Review Online regarding what he saw as the Jewish overreaction to the article that \\"It was a display of arrogance, cruelty, ignorance, stupidity, and sheer bad manners by rich and powerful people towards a harmless, helpless young writer, and the Jews who whipped up this preposterous storm should all be thoroughly ashamed of themselves\\". Lawson left in 1995 to become editor of The Sunday Telegraph, and was replaced by a deputy editor of the same newspaper, Frank Johnson. After the 1997 election, Johnson averted a decline in The Spectator sales by recruiting \\"New Labour contributors\\", and shifting the magazine's direction slightly away from politics. In 1996 the magazine's Christmas issue featured an interview with The Spice Girls, in which the band members gave their \\"Euro- sceptic and generally anti-labour\\" views on politics. Shortly before her death Diana, Princess of Wales, was depicted on the magazine's cover as the figurehead of Mohamed Al-Fayed's boat, The Jonikal.The Spectator, 16 August 1997 =Boris Johnson= Before joining The Spectator as editor, Boris Johnson had worked for The Times, the Wolverhampton Express & Star, and The Daily Telegraph. He had also briefly been political commentator for The Spectator under Dominic Lawson, but Frank Johnson replaced him with Bruce Anderson in 1995. Succeeding Frank Johnson in 1999, Johnson soon established himself as a competent and \\"colourful\\" editor. In the 2001 general election, Johnson was elected MP for Henley, and by 2004 had been made vice-chairman of the Conservative party, with a place in Michael Howard's shadow cabinet. In 2003 he explained his editorial policy for The Spectator would \\"always be roughly speaking in favour of getting rid of Saddam, sticking up for Israel, free- market economics, expanding choice\\" and that the magazine was \\"not necessarily a Thatcherite Conservative or a neo-conservative magazine, even though in our editorial coverage we tend to follow roughly the conclusions of those lines of arguments\\". In October 2004, a Spectator editorial suggested that the death of the hostage Kenneth Bigley was being over-sentimentalised by the people of Liverpool, accusing them of indulging in a \\"vicarious victimhood\\" and of possessing a \\"deeply unattractive psyche\\".‚ÄôThe Spectator, 16 October 2004 Simon Heffer had written the leader but, as editor, Johnson took full responsibility for it. Michael Howard subsequently ordered him to visit Liverpool on a \\"penitential pilgrimage\\".The Spectator, 23 October 2004 At this time the paper began jokingly to be referred to as the 'Sextator', owing to the number of sex scandals connected with the magazine during his editorship. These included an affair between columnist Rod Liddle and the magazine's receptionist, and Johnson's own affair with another columnist, Petronella Wyatt. Johnson at first denied the relationship, dismissing the allegations as \\"an inverted pyramid of piffle\\", but was sacked from the Shadow Cabinet in November 2004 when they turned out to be true. In the same year David Blunkett, the Home Secretary, resigned from the government after it emerged he had been having an affair with the publisher of The Spectator, Kimberly Quinn, and had fast-tracked her nanny's visa application. In 2005, circulation was as high as 60,000 by the time Johnson left to be the Shadow Minister for Higher Education. On the announcement of his departure, Andrew Neil paid tribute to his editorship. During Johnson's editorship, Mary Wakefield began working at the magazine: she is now the magazine's commissioning editor and is married to Johnson's political advisor Dominic Cummings. 2006‚Äìpresent =Matthew d'Ancona= D‚ÄôAncona had been Deputy Editor at The Sunday Telegraph, and before that an assistant editor at The Times. During his four years as editor of The Spectator, he made several editorial and structural changes to the magazine, \\"not all of which were universally popular with readers\\". He ended the traditional summary of the week's events, \\"Portrait of the Week\\", and, in 2006, launched a new lifestyle section entitled \\"You Earned It\\". He removed Peter Oborne as political editor, and appointed Fraser Nelson in his place. He decided not to appoint a new media columnist to succeed Stephen Glover, explaining, \\"I do not think The Spectator needs a media columnist. Our pages are precious and I do not think the internal wranglings of our trade are high on the list of Spectator readers‚Äô priorities.\\" Perhaps the magazine's most important innovation under d‚ÄôAncona was the Coffee House blog, led by Peter Hoskin and James Forsyth, launched in May 2007. In 2007 The Spectator moved its offices from Doughty Street, which had been its home for 32 years, to 22 Old Queen Street in Westminster. =Fraser Nelson= The Spectators current editor is Fraser Nelson, who replaced d'Ancona in August 2009. In 2010 he unveiled a slight redesign of the paper, shrinking the cover illustration slightly, shifting the cover lines, in general, to the bottom, and spreading the contents section over a double-page. Playing down the changes, Nelson described the new look as \\"a tidy-up ... rather like restoring an old painting.\\" An article in November 2011 by Rod Liddle on the trial of two men eventually convicted for the murder of Stephen Lawrence led to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) deciding to prosecute the magazine for breaching reporting restrictions.Owen Boycott \\"Spectator magazine to face charge over article on Stephen Lawrence trial\\", The Guardian, 9 May 2012. The magazine chose not to contest the case,\\"Spectator charged over Stephen Lawrence article\\", BBC News, 9 May 2012. and the publisher Spectator 1828 Ltd pleaded guilty at the court hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court on 7 June 2012.\\"Spectator magazine fined ¬£5,000 over Stephen Lawrence\\", Daily Telegraph, 7 June 2012. The magazine was fined ¬£3,000, with ¬£2,000 compensation awarded to Stephen Lawrence's parents and ¬£625 costs.Josh Halliday \\"Spectator to pay out ¬£5,625 over Rod Liddle's Stephen Lawrence article\\", The Guardian, 7 June 2012. According to Nelson, readers' most common reaction to the columnist was \\"don't tone down Rod\\", but \\"our non-readers don't like\\" him.Dan Sabbagh \\"Fraser Nelson: The Spectator is more cocktail party than political party\\", The Guardian, 17 February 2013. In June 2013, The Spectator Archive was launched,its online archive \\"Welcome to The Spectator Archive: 180 years of history now online\\", Sebastian Payne, 10 June 2013. containing 1.5 million pages from 180 years of published articles. In August 2015, The Spectator received media attention and criticism after publishing an article by Charles Moore regarding the 2015 Labour Party leadership election titled \\"Have Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall got the looks for a leadership contest?\\", in which he wrote \\"there is an understanding that no leader ‚Äì especially, despite the age of equality, a woman ‚Äì can look grotesque on television and win a general election\\" and discussed the looks of the two female candidates in detail. The article was condemned by Liz Kendall; First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon; Candidate for Labour nomination for Mayor of London and former Minister and MP Tessa Jowell; along with several journalists and MPs from various parties. Political ideology and policy positions The Spectator is politically conservative and supports the Conservative Party. In the past, it has always had liberal leanings: over the course of its first century it supported the Radical wing of the Whigs, the Liberal Party, and the Liberal Unionists, who eventually merged with the Conservatives. As with its sister publication The Daily Telegraph, The Spectator is generally Atlanticist and Eurosceptic in outlook, favouring close ties with the United States rather than with the European Union, and tends to be supportive of Israel. It also strongly opposes Scottish independence. Cultural positions The magazine has popularised the phrases \\"The Establishment\\" (1955), \\"nanny state\\" (1965),\\"pseud\\" (1960s), \\"young fogey\\" (1984) and \\"virtue signalling\\" (2015).

The population at the 2011 Census was 11,619. History Henley does not appear in Domesday Book of 1086; often it is mistaken for Henlei in the book which is in Surrey. The first record of Henley is from 1179, when it is recorded that King Henry II \\"had bought land for the making of buildings\\". King John granted the manor of Benson and the town and manor of Henley to Robert Harcourt in 1199. A church at Henley is first mentioned in 1204. In 1205 the town received a paviage grant, and in 1234 the bridge is first mentioned. In 1278 Henley is described as a hamlet of Benson with a chapel. The street plan was probably established by the end of the 13th century. As a demesne of the crown it was granted in 1337 to John de Molyns, whose family held it for about 250 years. It is said that members for Henley sat in parliaments of Edward I and Edward III, but no writs have been found to substantiate this. The existing Thursday market, it is believed, was granted by a charter of King John. A market was certainly in existence by 1269; however, the jurors of the assize of 1284 said that they did not know by what warrant the earl of Cornwall held a market and fair in the town of Henley. The existing Corpus Christi fair was granted by a charter of Henry VI. During the Black Death pandemic that swept through England in the 14th century, Henley lost 60% of its population. A variation on its name can be seen as \\"Henley up a Tamys\\" in 1485. By the beginning of the 16th century, the town extended along the west bank of the Thames from Friday Street in the south to the Manor, now Phyllis Court, in the north and took in Hart Street and New Street. To the west, it included Bell Street and the Market Place. Henry VIII granted the use of the titles \\"mayor\\" and \\"burgess\\", and the town was incorporated in 1568 in the name of the warden, portreeves, burgesses and commonalty. The original charter was issued by Elizabeth I but replaced by one from George I in 1722. Henley suffered at the hands of both parties in the Civil War. Later, William III rested here on his march to London in 1688, at the nearby recently rebuilt Fawley Court, and received a deputation from the Lords. The town's period of prosperity in the 17th and 18th centuries was due to manufactures of glass and malt, and trade in corn and wool. Henley-on-Thames supplied London with timber and grain. A workhouse to accommodate 150 people was built at West Hill in Henley in 1790, and was later enlarged to accommodate 250 as the Henley Poor Law Union workhouse. Prior to 1974 Henley was a municipal borough with a Borough Council comprising twelve Councillors and four Aldermen, headed by a Mayor. The Local Government Act 1972 resulted in the re-organisation of local government in that year. Henley became part of Wallingford District Council, subsequently re-named South Oxfordshire District Council. The borough council became a town council but the role of mayor was retained. Landmarks and structures Henley Bridge over the River Thames Henley Bridge is a five arched bridge across the river built in 1786. It is a Grade I listed historic structure. During 2011 the bridge underwent a ¬£200,000 repair programme after being hit by the boat Crazy Love in August 2010. About a mile upstream of the bridge is Marsh Lock. J. P. Neale, and published in The Beauties of England and Wales Chantry House is the second Grade I listed building in the town. It is unusual in having more storeys on one side than on the other. Chantry House, next to the church The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin is nearby and has a 16th-century tower. The Old Bell is a pub in the centre of Henley on Bell Street. The building has been dated from 1325: the oldest-dated building in the town. To celebrate Queen Victoria's Jubilee, 60 oak trees were planted in the shape of a Victoria Cross near Fairmile, the long straight road to the northwest of the town.

Transport Henley-on-Thames from the playground near the railway station The town's railway station is the terminus of the Henley Branch Line from Twyford. In the past there have been direct services to London Paddington. There are express mainline rail services from Reading (6 miles or 10 km away) to Paddington. Trains from High Wycombe (12 miles or 20 km away) go to London Marylebone. The M4 motorway (junction 8/9) and the M40 motorway (junction 4) are both about 7 miles (12 km) away.

It was established in 1998, and officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II. The museum, designed by the architect David Chipperfield, features information on the River Thames, the sport of rowing, and the town of Henley itself. The University of Reading's Henley Business School is near Henley, as is Henley College. Rupert House School is a preparatory school located in Bell Street. Rowing A race during the Henley Royal Regatta Henley is a world-renowned centre for rowing. Each summer the Henley Royal Regatta is held on Henley Reach, a naturally straight stretch of the river just north of the town. It was extended artificially. The event became \\"Royal\\" in 1851, when Prince Albert became patron of the regatta. Other regattas and rowing races are held on the same reach, including Henley Women's Regatta, the Henley Boat Races for women's and lightweight teams between Oxford and Cambridge University, Henley Town and Visitors Regatta, Henley Veteran Regatta, Upper Thames Small Boats Head, Henley Fours and Eights Head, and Henley Sculls. These \\"Heads\\" often attract strong crews that have won medals at National Championships. Local rowing clubs include: * Henley Rowing Club (located upstream of Henley Bridge) * Leander Club (world-famous, home to Olympic and World Champions, near Henley Bridge) * Phyllis Court Rowing Club (part of the Phyllis Court Club and set up for recreational rowing) * Upper Thames Rowing Club (located just upstream from the 3/4-mile mark/Fawley/Old Blades) * Henley Whalers (associated with UTRC) focus on fixed-seat rowing and sailing. The regatta depicted throughout Dead in the Water, an episode of the British detective television series Midsomer Murders, was filmed at Henley. Other sports Henley has the oldest football team Henley Town F.C. recognised by the Oxfordshire Football Association, they play at The Triangle ground.

The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is the United States federal government's official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance. A property listed in the National Register, or located within a National Register Historic District, may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property. The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it. Of the more than one million properties on the National Register, 80,000 are listed individually. The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts. For most of its history, the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service (NPS), an agency within the United States Department of the Interior. Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups, such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation, as well as to coordinate, identify and protect historic sites in the United States. While National Register listings are mostly symbolic, their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties. Protection of the property is not guaranteed. During the nomination process, the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation, as well as the public and politicians. Occasionally, historic sites outside the country proper, but associated with the United States (such as the American Embassy in Tangiers) are also listed. Properties can be nominated in a variety of forms, including individual properties, historic districts and multiple property submissions (MPS). The Register categorizes general listings into one of five types of properties: district, site, structure, building or object. National Register Historic Districts are defined geographical areas consisting of contributing and non- contributing properties. Some properties are added automatically to the National Register when they become administered by the National Park Service. These include National Historic Landmarks (NHL), National Historic Sites (NHS), National Historical Parks, National Military Parks, National Memorials and some National Monuments. (Federal properties can be proclaimed National Monuments under the Antiquities Act because of either their historical or natural significance. They are managed by multiple agencies. Only monuments that are historic in character and managed by the National Park Service are listed administratively in the National Register.) History George B.

The 1966 act required those agencies to work in conjunction with the SHPO and an independent federal agency, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), to confront adverse effects of federal activities on historic preservation. U.S. Secretary of the Interior (1977‚Äì1981) Cecil Andrus removed the National Register from the jurisdiction of the National Park Service in 1978 To administer the newly created National Register of Historic Places, the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior, with director George B. Hartzog Jr., established an administrative division named the Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP).Scarpino, Philip V. \\"Planning for Preservation: A Look at the Federal-State Historic Preservation Program, 1966‚Äì1986 (in The Intergovernmental Politics of Preservation)\\" (JSTOR), The Public Historian, Vol. 14, No. 2.

The division administered several existing programs, including the Historic Sites Survey and the Historic American Buildings Survey, as well as the new National Register and Historic Preservation Fund. The first official Keeper of the Register was William J. Murtagh, an architectural historian. During the Register's earliest years in the late 1960s and early 1970s, organization was lax and SHPOs were small, understaffed and underfunded. However, funds were still being supplied for the Historic Preservation Fund to provide matching grants-in-aid to listed property owners, first for house museums and institutional buildings, but later for commercial structures as well. A few years later in 1979, the NPS history programs affiliated with both the U.S. National Parks system and the National Register were categorized formally into two \\"Assistant Directorates.\\" Established were the Assistant Directorate for Archeology and Historic Preservation and the Assistant Directorate for Park Historic Preservation. From 1978 until 1981, the main agency for the National Register was the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service (HCRS) of the United States Department of the Interior.Hertfelder, Eric. \\"The National Park Service and Historic Preservation: Historic Preservation beyond Smokey the Bear (in Commentary: How Well Is the National Park Service Doing?)\\" (JSTOR), The Public Historian, Vol. 9, No. 2, The National Park Service and Historic Preservation.

Jerry L. Rogers was selected to direct this newly merged associate directorate. He was described as a skilled administrator, who was sensitive to the need for the NPS to work with SHPOs, academia and local governments. Although not described in detail in the 1966 act, SHPOs eventually became integral to the process of listing properties on the National Register. The 1980 amendments of the 1966 law further defined the responsibilities of SHPOs concerning the National Register. Several 1992 amendments of the NHPA added a category to the National Register, known as Traditional Cultural Properties: those properties associated with Native American or Hawaiian groups. The National Register of Historic Places has grown considerably from its legislative origins in 1966. In 1986, citizens and groups nominated 3,623 separate properties, sites and districts for inclusion on the National Register, a total of 75,000 separate properties. Of the more than one million properties on the National Register, 80,000 are listed individually. Others are listed as contributing members within historic districts. Nomination process Any individual can prepare a National Register nomination, although historians and historic preservation consultants often are employed for this work. The nomination consists of a standard nomination form and contains basic information about a property's physical appearance and the type of significance embodied in the building, structure, object, site, or district. The State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) receives National Register nominations and provides feedback to the nominating individual or group. After preliminary review, the SHPO sends each nomination to the state's historic review commission, which then recommends whether the State Historic Preservation Officer should send the nomination to the Keeper of the National Register. For any non-Federally owned property, only the State Historic Preservation Officer may officially nominate a property for inclusion in the National Register. After the nomination is recommended for listing in the National Register by the SHPO, the nomination is sent to the National Park Service, which approves or denies the nomination. If approved, the property is entered officially by the Keeper of the National Register into the National Register of Historic Places. Property owners are notified of the nomination during the review by the SHPO and state's historic review commission. If an owner objects to a nomination of private property, or in the case of a historic district, a majority of owners, then the property cannot be listed in the National Register of Historic Places. =Criteria= The Robie House, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, is an example of a property listed by means of criterion C.\\"Robie House \\", (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency.

Each nomination contains a narrative section that provides a detailed physical description of the property and justifies why it is significant historically with regard either to local, state, or national history. The four National Register of Historic Places criteria are the following. * Criterion A, \\"Event\\", the property must make a contribution to the major pattern of American history. * Criterion B, \\"Person\\", is associated with significant people of the American past. * Criterion C, \\"Design/Construction\\", concerns the distinctive characteristics of the building by its architecture and construction, including having great artistic value or being the work of a master. * Criterion D, \\"Information potential\\", is satisfied if the property has yielded or may be likely to yield information important to prehistory or history.\\"Criteria Bulletin,\\" National Register of Historic Places, Official site. Retrieved March 21, 2007. The criteria are applied differently for different types of properties; for instance, maritime properties have application guidelines different from those of buildings. =Exclusions= There are specific instances where properties usually do not merit listing in the National Register. As a general rule, cemeteries, birthplaces, graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, moved structures, reconstructed historic buildings, commemorative properties and properties that have achieved significance during the last fifty years are not qualified for listing on the Register. There are, however, exceptions to all the preceding; mitigating circumstances allow properties classified in one of those groups to be included. =Properties listed= A typical plaque found on properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

A listing on the National Register of Historic Places is governmental acknowledgment of a historic district, site, building, or property. However, the Register is mostly \\"an honorary status with some federal financial incentives.\\" The National Register of Historic Places automatically includes all National Historic Landmarks as well as all historic areas administered by the National Park Service. Landmarks such as these include National Historic Sites (NHS), National Historical Parks, National Military Parks/Battlefields, National Memorials and some National Monuments.

Retrieved April 11, 2007. Listing in the National Register does not restrict private property owners from the use of their property. Some states and municipalities, however, may have laws that become effective when a property is listed in the National Register. If federal money or a federal permitting process is involved, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 is invoked. Section 106 requires the federal agency involved to assess the effect of its actions on historic resources. Statutorily, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) has the most significant role by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The section requires that the director of any federal agency with direct or indirect jurisdiction of a project that may affect a property listed or determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, must first report to the Advisory Council. The director of said agency is required to \\"take into account the effect of the undertaking\\" on the National Register property, as well as to afford the ACHP a reasonable opportunity to comment.Gray, Oscar S. \\"The Response of Federal Legislation to Historic Preservation\\" (JSTOR), Law and Contemporary Problems, Vol. 36, No. 3, Historic Preservation. (Summer, 1971), pp. 314‚Äì328. Retrieved March 21, 2007. While Section 106 does not mandate explicitly that any federal agency director accept the advice of the ACHP, their advice has practical influence, especially given the statutory obligations of the NHPA that require federal agencies to \\"take into account the effect of the undertaking.\\" In cases where the ACHP determines federal action will have an \\"adverse effect\\" on historic properties, mitigation is sought. Typically, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) is created by which the involved parties agree to a particular plan. Many states have laws similar to Section 106.\\"Section 106 Summary \\", Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, Official site, April 26, 2002. In contrast to conditions relating to a federally designated historic district, municipal ordinances governing local historic districts often restrict certain kinds of changes to properties.

The Department of Transportation Act, passed on October 15, 1966, the same day as the National Historic Preservation Act, included provisions that addressed historic preservation. The DOT Act is much more general than Section 106 NHPA in that it refers to properties other than those listed in the Register. The more general language has allowed more properties and parklands to enjoy status as protected areas by this legislation, a policy developed early in its history.

A multiple property submission (MPS) is a thematic group listing of the National Register of Historic Places that consists of related properties that share a common theme and can be submitted as a group. Multiple property submissions must satisfy certain basic criteria for the group of properties to be included in the National Register. The process begins with the multiple property documentation forms, which acts as a cover document rather than the nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The purpose of the documentation form is to establish the basis of eligibility for related properties. The information of the multiple property documentation form can be used to nominate and register related historic properties simultaneously, or to establish criteria for properties that may be nominated in the future. Thus, additions to an MPS can occur over time. The nomination of individual properties in an MPS is accomplished in the same manner as other nominations. The name of the \\"thematic group\\" denotes the historical theme of the properties. It is considered the \\"multiple property listing.\\" Once an individual property or a group of properties is nominated and listed in the National Register, the multiple property documentation form, combined with the individual National Register of Historic Places nomination forms, constitute a multiple property submission.Lee, Antoinette J. and McClelland Linda F. \\"How to Complete the National Register Multiple Property Documentation Form, (PDF), National Register Bulletin, National Park Service.

Examples of MPS include the Lee County Multiple Property Submission, the Warehouses in Omaha, the Boundary Markers of the Original District of Columbia and the Illinois Carnegie Libraries.

Listed properties are generally in one of five broad categories, although there are special considerations for other types of properties that in any one, or into more specialized subcategories. The five general categories for National Register properties are: building, structure, site, district and object. In addition, historic districts consist of contributing and non-contributing properties. The Liberty Ship SS Jeremiah O'Brien, an example of a ship listed in the National Register. This ship is also a National Historic Landmark. Buildings, as defined by the National Register, are distinguished in the traditional sense. Examples include a house, barn, hotel, church, or similar construction. They are created primarily to shelter human activity. The term building, as in outbuilding, can be used to refer to historically and functionally related units, such as a courthouse and a jail or a barn and a house. Structures differ from buildings in that they are functional constructions meant to be used for purposes other than sheltering human activity. Examples include an aircraft, a grain elevator, a gazebo and a bridge. Objects are usually artistic in nature, or small in scale compared to structures and buildings. Although objects may be movable, they are generally associated with a specific setting or environment. Examples of objects include monuments, sculptures and fountains. Sites are the locations of significant events, which can be prehistoric or historic in nature and represent activities or buildings (standing, ruined, or vanished). When sites are listed, it is the locations themselves that are of historical interest. They possess cultural or archaeological value regardless of the value of any structures that currently exist at the locations. Examples of types of sites include shipwrecks, battlefields, campsites, natural features and rock shelters. Historic districts possess a concentration, association, or continuity of the other four types of properties. Objects, structures, buildings and sites in a historic district are united historically or aesthetically, either by choice or by the nature of their development. There are several other different types of historic preservation associated with the properties of the National Register of Historic Places that cannot be classified as either simple buildings and historic districts. Through the National Park Service, the National Register of Historic Places publishes a series of bulletins designed to aid in evaluating and applying the criteria for evaluation of different types of properties. Although the criteria are always the same, the manner they are applied may differ slightly, depending upon the type of property involved. The National Register bulletins describe application of the criteria for aids to navigation, historic battlefields, archaeological sites, aviation properties, cemeteries and burial places, historic designed landscapes, mining sites, post offices, properties associated with significant persons, properties achieving significance within the last fifty years, rural historic landscapes, traditional cultural properties and vessels and shipwrecks. Property owner incentives NRHP marker Properties are not protected in any strict sense by the Federal listing. States and local zoning bodies may or may not choose to protect listed historic places. Indirect protection is possible, by state and local regulations on development of National Register properties and by tax incentives.By contrast, the state of Colorado, for example, does not set any limits on owners of National Register properties. See \\"National and state registers\\", at Colorado Office of Archeology & Historic Preservation Until 1976, federal tax incentives were virtually non-existent for buildings on the National Register. Before 1976 the federal tax code favored new construction rather than the reuse of existing, sometimes historical, structures. In 1976, the tax code was altered to provide tax incentives that promote preservation of income-producing historic properties. The National Park Service was given the responsibility to ensure that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building would qualify for federal tax incentives. A qualifying rehabilitation is one that the NPS deems consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Properties and sites listed in the Register, as well as those located in and contributing to the period of significance of National Register Historic Districts, became eligible for the federal tax benefits. Owners of income-producing properties listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places or of properties that are contributing resources within a National Register Historic District may be eligible for a 20% investment tax credit for the rehabilitation of the historic structure. The rehabilitation may be of a commercial, industrial, or residential property, for rentals. The tax incentives program is operated by the Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program, which is managed jointly by the National Park Service, individual State Historic Preservation Offices and the Internal Revenue Service.\\"Historic Preservation Tax Incentives\\", Technical Preservation Services, National Park Service, Official site. Retrieved March 22, 2007. Aside from the 20% tax credit, the tax incentive program offers a 10% tax credit for rehabilitation to owners of non-historic, non-residential buildings constructed before 1936.About the Historic Preservation Tax Incentives, Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives, Technical Preservation Services, National Park Service, Official site. Retrieved March 22, 2007. Some property owners may also qualify for grants, like the now-defunct Save America's Treasures grants, which apply specifically to properties entered in the Register with national significance or designated as National Historic Landmarks.\\"Save America's Treasurers: FAQ\\" National Park Service. Retrieved March 23, 2007. The NHPA did not distinguish between properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places and those designated as National Historic Landmarks concerning qualification for tax incentives or grants. This was deliberate, as the authors of the act had learned from experience that distinguishing between categories of significance for such incentives caused the lowest category to become expendable. Essentially, this made the Landmarks a kind of \\"honor roll\\" of the most significant properties of the National Register of Historic Places. Recent past In American historic preservation, the 50-year rule is the generally held belief that a property must be at least 50 years old to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places.https://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/guidance/50_year_rule_history.pdf Of Exceptional Importance: The Origins of the Fifty-Year-Rule in Historic Preservation. Actually, there is no hard rule. As stated by John H. Sprinkle, Jr., Deputy Director of the Federal Preservation Institute, \\"this 'rule' is only an exception to the criteria that shape listings within the National Register of Historic Places. Of the eight 'exceptions' [or criteria considerations], Consideration G, for properties that have achieved significance within the past fifty years, is probably the best-known, yet also misunderstood preservation principle in America.\\" Each year, a new group of resources crosses the 50-year threshold. The preservation of these \\"underage\\" resources has gained attention in recent years.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics on December 10, 2000.The Nobel Prize in Physics 2000. Nobelprize.org. Retrieved on 2013-11-21. Kilby was also the co-inventor of the handheld calculator and the thermal printer, for which he had the patents. He also had patents for seven other inventions.  Early life  Kilby was born in 1923 in Jefferson City, Missouri to Hubert and Vina Freitag Kilby. Both parents had Bachelor of Science degrees from the University of Illinois, but it was his father's job as a manager of a local power company that brought the family from Jefferson City to Kansas, where he went from manager to president of the utility.https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/jack-st-clair-kilby/12125 Kilby grew up and attended school in Great Bend, Kansas, graduating from the Great Bend High School. (Road signs at the entrances to the town commemorate his time there, and the Commons Area at Great Bend High School has been named The Jack Kilby Commons Area.) Kilby received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, where he was an honorary member of Acacia fraternity. In 1947, he received a degree in electrical engineering. He earned his Master of Science in electrical engineering from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1950https://news.wisc.edu/microchip-inventor-and-uw- engineering-alumnus-kilby-dies/, while working at Centralab, a division of Globe-Union corporation in Milwaukee. Career In mid-1958, Kilby, a newly employed engineer at Texas Instruments (TI), did not yet have the right to a summer vacation. He spent the summer working on the problem in circuit design that was commonly called the \\"tyranny of numbers\\", and he finally came to the conclusion that the manufacturing of circuit components en masse in a single piece of semiconductor material could provide a solution. On September 12, he presented his findings to company's management, which included Mark Shepherd. He showed them a piece of germanium with an oscilloscope attached, pressed a switch, and the oscilloscope showed a continuous sine wave, proving that his integrated circuit worked, and thus that he had solved the problem. U.S. Patent 3,138,743 for \\"Miniaturized Electronic Circuits\\", the first integrated circuit, was filed on February 6, 1959. Along with Robert Noyce (who independently made a similar circuit a few months later), Kilby is generally credited as co-inventor of the integrated circuit. Jack Kilby went on to pioneer military, industrial, and commercial applications of microchip technology. He headed teams that created the first military system and the first computer incorporating integrated circuits. He invented the handheld calculator (along with Jerry Merryman and James Van Tassel). He was also responsible for the thermal printer that was used in early portable data terminals. In 1970, he took a leave of absence from TI to work as an independent inventor. He explored, among other subjects, the use of silicon technology for generating electrical power from sunlight. From 1978 to 1984 he held the position of Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering at Texas A&M; University. In 1983, Kilby retired from Texas Instruments. Jack Kilby's original integrated circuit Later life He died of cancer June 20, 2005 at the age of 81, in Dallas, Texas. On December 14, 2005, Texas Instruments created the Historic TI Archives. The Jack Kilby family donated his personal manuscripts and his personal photograph collection to Southern Methodist University (SMU). The collection will be cataloged and stored at DeGolyer Library, SMU. In 2008, the SMU School of Engineering, with the DeGolyer Library and the Library of Congress, hosted a year-long celebration of the 50th anniversary of the birth of the digital age with Kilby's Nobel Prize-winning invention of the integrated circuit. Symposia and exhibits examined the many ways in which technology and engineers shaped the modern world. Kilby held an honorary doctorate of science from SMU and was a longtime associate of SMU through the Kilby Foundation. Awards and honors Recognition of Kilby's outstanding achievements have been made by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), including the election to IEEE Fellow in 1966, the IEEE David Sarnoff Award in 1966, co- recipient of the first IEEE Cledo Brunetti Award in 1978, the IEEE Centennial Medal in 1984 and the IEEE Medal of Honor in 1986. He was co-recipient of the Franklin Institute‚Äôs Stuart Ballantine Medal in 1966. In 1982 and 1989, he received the Holley Medal from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). He was elected to member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in 1967 and received the Academy's Vladimir K. Zworykin Award in 1975. Kilby received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1970 and was co-recipient of the first NAE's Charles Stark Draper Prize in 1989. The Kilby Award Foundation was founded in 1980 in his honor, and the IEEE Jack S. Kilby Signal Processing Medal was created in 1995. Kilby is also the recipient of the America's most prestigious honors in science and engineering: the National Medal of Science in 1969, and the National Medal of Technology in 1990. In 1982, he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1993, he was awarded the Kyoto Prize by the Inamori Foundation. He was awarded both the Washington Award, administered by the Western Society of Engineers and the Eta Kappa Nu Vladimir Karapetoff Award in 1999. In 2000, Kilby was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his breakthrough discovery, and delivered his personal view of the industry and its history in his acceptance speech. Kilby was awarded nine honorary doctorate degrees from universities including Southern Methodist University, the University of Miami, University of Illinois, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, Texas A&M; University, Yale and Rochester Institute of Technology. The National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) in Taiwan awarded Kilby with a certificate of Honorary Professorship in 1998. The Kilby Labs, TI's research laboratory for silicon manufacturing and integrated circuit design, is named after him. The Jack Kilby Computer Centre at the Merchiston Campus of Edinburgh Napier University in Edinburgh is also named in his honor.

He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta and first appeared on television, along with the rest of his family, in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip Life in Hell but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his father, Homer Groening. After appearing for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, the Simpson family got their own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989. As patriarch of the eponymous family, Homer and his wife Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies many American working class stereotypes: he is obese, immature, outspoken, altruistic, aggressive, balding, lazy, ignorant, unprofessional, and addicted to beer, junk food and watching television. However, he's a good man and is staunchly protective of his family, especially when they need him the most. Despite the suburban blue- collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, fighting former President George H. W. Bush and winning a Grammy Award as a member of a barbershop quartet. In the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of Walter Matthau; however, during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the expression of a fuller range of emotions. He has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons‚Äîincluding video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials, and comic books‚Äîand inspired an entire line of merchandise. His signature catchphrase, the annoyed grunt \\"D'oh!\\", has been included in The New Oxford Dictionary of English since 1998 and the Oxford English Dictionary since 2001. Homer is one of the most influential characters in the history of television, and is widely considered to be an American cultural icon. The British newspaper The Sunday Times described him as \\"The greatest comic creation of [modern] time\\". He was named the greatest character \\"of the last 20 years\\" in 2010 by Entertainment Weekly, was ranked the second-greatest cartoon character by TV Guide, behind Bugs Bunny, and was voted the greatest television character of all time by Channel 4 viewers. For voicing Homer, Castellaneta has won four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance and a special-achievement Annie Award. In 2000, Homer and his family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Role in The Simpsons Homer Jay Simpson is the bumbling husband of Marge, and father to Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. He is the son of Mona and Abraham \\"Grampa\\" Simpson. Homer held over 188 different jobs in the first 400 episodes of The Simpsons. In most episodes, he works as the nuclear safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position which, whilst being wholly unsuitable for, he has held since \\"Homer's Odyssey\\", the third episode of the series. At the nuclear plant, Homer is often ignored and completely forgotten by his boss Mr. Burns, and he constantly falls asleep and neglects his duties. Matt Groening has stated that he decided to have Homer work at the power plant because of the potential for Homer to wreak severe havoc. Each of his other jobs has lasted only one episode. In the first half of the series, the writers developed an explanation about how he got fired from the plant and was then rehired in every episode. In later episodes, he often began a new job on impulse, without any mention of his regular employment. The Simpsons uses a floating timeline in which the characters never physically age, and, as such, the show is generally assumed to be always set in the current year. Nevertheless, in several episodes, events in Homer's life have been linked to specific time periods. \\"Mother Simpson\\" (season seven, 1995) depicts Homer's mother, Mona, as a radical who went into hiding in 1969 following a run-in with the law; \\"The Way We Was\\" (season two, 1991) shows Homer falling in love with Marge Bouvier as a senior at Springfield High School in 1974; and \\"I Married Marge\\" (season three, 1991) implies that Marge became pregnant with Bart in 1980. However, the episode \\"That '90s Show\\" (season 19, 2008) contradicted much of this backstory, portraying Homer and Marge as a twentysomething childless couple in the early 1990s. Due to the floating timeline, Homer's age has changed occasionally as the series developed; he was 34 in the early episodes, 36 in season four, 38 and 39 in season eight, and 40 in the eighteenth season, although even in those seasons his age is inconsistent. During Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein's period as showrunners, they found that as they aged, Homer seemed to become older too, so they increased his age to 38. His height is 6' (1.83 m). Other television appearances =2019 Emmy Awards= During the opening of the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards broadcast on Fox on September 22, 2019, Homer Simpson was introduced as the host of the show. However, after some brief opening comments, a piano fell on him. The remainder of the award show was then broadcast without a host. =Duckman= Homer Simpson made a cameo appearance in the episode, \\"Duckman and Cornfed in 'Haunted Society Plumbers\\", where Duckman and Cornfed try to recover a stolen jewel. They believe there is a ghost involved, who at the end happens to be Homer. While the credits roll, Homer fails several times trying to repeat his line. Dan Castellaneta was the guest star voice for this episode. =The Critic= In the episode, \\"Dial M for Mother\\", Homer and Bart made a brief appearance. During an interview with Geraldo Rivera, Jay is asked about talking over the heads of his audience and does just that in his answer. An annoyed family watching changes the channel to The Simpsons, where Homer‚Äîafter stepping on a rake‚Äîexclaims, \\"D'oh!\\" and Bart replies, \\"¬°Ay, caramba!\\" The family's father comments, \\"Now, this I understand\\". Character =Creation= Naming the characters after members of his own family, Groening named Homer after his father, who himself had been named after the ancient Greek poet of the same name. Very little else of Homer's character was based on him, and to prove that the meaning behind Homer's name was not significant, Groening later named his own son Homer. According to Groening, \\"Homer originated with my goal to both amuse my real father, and just annoy him a little bit. My father was an athletic, creative, intelligent filmmaker and writer, and the only thing he had in common with Homer was a love of donuts.\\" Although Groening has stated in several interviews that Homer was named after his father, he also claimed in several 1990 interviews that a character in the 1939 Nathanael West novel The Day of the Locust was the inspiration for naming Homer. Homer's middle initial \\"J\\", which stands for \\"Jay\\", is a \\"tribute\\" to animated characters such as Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, who got their middle initial from Jay Ward. Homer made his debut with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\". In 1989, the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons, a half-hour series airing on the Fox Broadcasting Company. Homer and the Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show. =Design= As currently depicted in the series, Homer's everyday clothing consists of a white shirt with short sleeves and open collar, blue pants, and gray shoes. He is overweight and bald, except for a fringe of hair around the back and sides of his head and two curling hairs on top, and his face always sports a growth of beard stubble that instantly regrows whenever he shaves. Homer's design has been revised several times over the course of the series. Left to right: Homer as he appeared in \\"Good Night\\" (1987), \\"Bathtime\\" (1989), and \\"Bart the Genius\\" (1990). The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette.Groening, Matt. (2005). Commentary for \\"Fear of Flying\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The family was crudely drawn because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. By coincidence or not, Homer's look bears a resemblance to the cartoon character Adamsson, created by Swedish cartoonist Oscar Jacobsson in 1920. Homer's physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no characters other than Homer, Grampa Simpson, Lenny Leonard, and Krusty the Clown have a similar beard line. When Groening originally designed Homer, he put his initials into the character's hairline and ear: the hairline resembled an 'M', and the right ear resembled a 'G'. Groening decided that this would be too distracting and redesigned the ear to look normal. However, he still draws the ear as a 'G' when he draws pictures of Homer for fans. The basic shape of Homer's head is described by director Mark Kirkland as a tube-shaped coffee can with a salad bowl on top. During the shorts, the animators experimented with the way Homer would move his mouth when talking. At one point, his mouth would stretch out back \\"beyond his beardline\\"; but this was dropped when it got \\"out of control.\\" In some early episodes, Homer's hair was rounded rather than sharply pointed because animation director Wes Archer felt it should look disheveled. Homer's hair evolved to be consistently pointed. During the first three seasons, Homer's design for some close-up shots included small lines which were meant to be eyebrows. Groening strongly disliked them and they were eventually dropped. In the season seven (1995) episode \\"Treehouse of Horror VI\\", Homer was computer animated into a three-dimensional character for the first time for the \\"Homer3\\" segment of the episode. The computer animation directors at Pacific Data Images worked hard not to \\"reinvent the character\\". In the final minute of the segment, the 3D Homer ends up in a real world, live-action Los Angeles. The scene was directed by David Mirkin and was the first time a Simpsons character had been in the real world in the series.Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh; Johnson, Tim; Silverman, David; Mirkin, David; Cohen, David X. \\"Homer in the Third Dimpension\\" (2005), in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Because \\"Lisa's Wedding\\" (season six, 1995) is set fifteen years in the future, Homer's design was altered to make him older in the episode. He is heavier; one of the hairs on top of his head was removed; and an extra line was placed under the eye. A similar design has been used in subsequent flashforwards. =Voice= \\"I was trying to find something I was more comfortable with that had more power to it, so I had to drop the voice down. ... People will say to me, 'Boy, I'm glad they replaced the guy that was there that first season.' That was me!\\" ‚ÄîDan Castellaneta Homer's voice is performed by Dan Castellaneta, who voices numerous other characters, including Grampa Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Barney Gumble, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby and Hans Moleman. Castellaneta had been part of the regular cast of The Tracey Ullman Show and had previously done some voice-over work in Chicago alongside his wife Deb Lacusta. Voices were needed for the Simpsons shorts, so the producers decided to ask Castellaneta and fellow cast member Julie Kavner to voice Homer and Marge rather than hire more actors. In the shorts and first season of the half-hour show, Homer's voice is different from the majority of the series. The voice began as a loose impression of Walter Matthau, but Castellaneta could not \\"get enough power behind that voice\\", or sustain his Matthau impression for the nine- to ten- hour-long recording sessions, and had to find something easier. During the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Castellaneta \\"dropped the voice down\\" and developed it as more versatile and humorous, allowing Homer a fuller range of emotions. Castellaneta's normal speaking voice does not bear any resemblance to Homer's. To perform Homer's voice, Castellaneta lowers his chin to his chest and is said to \\"let his I.Q. go\\". While in this state, he has ad-libbed several of Homer's least intelligent comments,Mirkin, David. (2004). Commentary for \\"Bart's Inner Child\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. such as the line \\"S-M-R-T; I mean, S-M- A-R-T!\\" from \\"Homer Goes to College\\" (season five, 1993) which was a genuine mistake made by Castellaneta during recording. Castellaneta likes to stay in character during recording sessions, and he tries to visualize a scene so that he can give the proper voice to it. Despite Homer's fame, Castellaneta claims he is rarely recognized in public, \\"except, maybe, by a die-hard fan\\". \\"Homer's Barbershop Quartet\\" (season five, 1993) is the only episode where Homer's voice was provided by someone other than Castellaneta. The episode features Homer forming a barbershop quartet called The Be Sharps; and, at some points, his singing voice is provided by a member of The Dapper Dans. The Dapper Dans had recorded the singing parts for all four members of The Be Sharps. Their singing was intermixed with the normal voice actors' voices, often with a regular voice actor singing the melody and the Dapper Dans providing backup. Until 1998, Castellaneta was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing for casting of new voices. However, the dispute was soon resolved and he received $125,000 per episode until 2004 when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode. The issue was resolved a month later, and Castellaneta earned $250,000 per episode. After salary re-negotiations in 2008, the voice actors receive approximately $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Castellaneta and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode. =Character development= Executive producer Al Jean notes that in The Simpsons' writing room, \\"everyone loves writing for Homer\\", and many of his adventures are based on experiences of the writers. In the early seasons of the show, Bart was the main focus. But, around the fourth season, Homer became more of the focus. According to Matt Groening, this was because \\"With Homer, there's just a wider range of jokes you can do. And there are far more drastic consequences to Homer's stupidity. There's only so far you can go with a juvenile delinquent. We wanted Bart to do anything up to the point of him being tried in court as a dad. But Homer is a dad, and his boneheaded-ness is funnier. [...] Homer is launching himself headfirst into every single impulsive thought that occurs to him.\\" Homer's behavior has changed a number of times through the run of the series. He was originally \\"very angry\\" and oppressive toward Bart, but these characteristics were toned down somewhat as his persona was further explored. In early seasons, Homer appeared concerned that his family was going to make him look bad; however, in later episodes he was less anxious about how he was perceived by others. In the first several years, Homer was often portrayed as sweet and sincere, but during Mike Scully's tenure as executive producer (seasons nine, 1997 to twelve, 2001), he became more of \\"a boorish, self-aggrandizing oaf\\". Chris Suellentrop of Slate wrote, \\"under Scully's tenure, The Simpsons became, well, a cartoon. ... Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset ... now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge's neck.\\" Fans have dubbed this incarnation of the character \\"Jerkass Homer\\". At voice recording sessions, Castellaneta has rejected material written in the script that portrayed Homer as being too mean. He believes that Homer is \\"boorish and unthinking, but he'd never be mean on purpose.\\" When editing The Simpsons Movie, several scenes were changed to make Homer more sympathetic. The writers have made Homer's intelligence appear to decline over the years; they explain this was not done intentionally, but it was necessary to top previous jokes. For example, in \\"When You Dish Upon a Star\\", (season 10, 1998) the writers included a scene where Homer admits that he cannot read. The writers debated including this plot twist because it would contradict previous scenes in which Homer does read, but eventually they decided to keep the joke because they found it humorous. The writers often debate how far to go in portraying Homer's stupidity; one suggested rule is that \\"he can never forget his own name\\". =Personality= The comic efficacy of Homer's personality lies in his frequent bouts of bumbling stupidity, laziness and his explosive anger. He has a low intelligence level and is described by director David Silverman as \\"creatively brilliant in his stupidity\\". Homer also shows immense apathy towards work, is overweight, and \\"is devoted to his stomach\\". His short attention span is evidenced by his impulsive decisions to engage in various hobbies and enterprises, only to \\"change ... his mind when things go badly\\". Homer often spends his evenings drinking Duff Beer at Moe's Tavern, and was shown in the episode \\"Duffless\\" (season four, 1993) as a full-blown alcoholic. He is very envious of his neighbors, Ned Flanders and his family, and is easily enraged by Bart. Homer will often strangle Bart on impulse upon Bart angering him (and can also be seen saying one of his catchphrases, \\"Why you little!\\") in a cartoonish manner. The first instance of Homer strangling Bart was in the short \\"Family Portrait\\". According to Groening, the rule was that Homer could only strangle Bart impulsively, never with premeditation, because doing so \\"seems sadistic. If we keep it that he's ruled by his impulses, then he can easily switch impulses. So, even though he impulsively wants to strangle Bart, he also gives up fairly easily.\\" Another of the original ideas entertained by Groening was that Homer would \\"always get his comeuppance or Bart had to strangle him back\\", but this was dropped. Homer shows no compunction about expressing his rage, and does not attempt to hide his actions from people outside the family. The first sketch of Homer strangling Bart, drawn in 1988. Homer has complex relationships with his family. As previously noted, he and Bart are the most at odds; but the two commonly share adventures and are sometimes allies, with some episodes (particularly in later seasons) showing that the pair have a strange respect for each other's cunning. Homer and Lisa have opposite personalities and he usually overlooks Lisa's talents, but when made aware of his neglect, does everything he can to help her. The show also occasionally implies Homer forgets he has a third child, Maggie; while the episode \\"And Maggie Makes Three\\" suggests she is the chief reason Homer took and remains at his regular job (season six, 1995). While Homer's thoughtless antics often upset his family, he on many occasions has also revealed himself to be a caring and loving father and husband: in \\"Lisa the Beauty Queen\\", (season four, 1992) he sold his cherished ride on the Duff blimp and used the money to enter Lisa in a beauty pageant so she could feel better about herself; in \\"Rosebud\\", (season five, 1993) he gave up his chance at wealth to allow Maggie to keep a cherished teddy bear; in \\"Radio Bart\\", (season three, 1992) he spearheads an attempt to dig Bart out after he had fallen down a well; in \\"A Milhouse Divided\\", (season eight, 1996) he arranges a surprise second wedding with Marge to make up for their unsatisfactory first ceremony; and despite a poor relationship with his father Abraham \\"Grampa\\" Simpson, whom he placed in a nursing home as soon as he could while the Simpson family often do their best to avoid unnecessary contact with Grampa, Homer has shown feelings of love for his father from time to time. Homer is \\"a (happy) slave to his various appetites\\". He has an apparently vacuous mind, but occasionally exhibits a surprising depth of knowledge about various subjects, such as the composition of the Supreme Court of the United States, Inca mythology, bankruptcy law, and cell biology. Homer's brief periods of intelligence are overshadowed, however, by much longer and consistent periods of ignorance, forgetfulness, and stupidity. Homer has a low IQ of 55, which has variously been attributed to the hereditary \\"Simpson Gene\\" (which eventually causes every male member of the family to become incredibly stupid), his alcohol problem, exposure to radioactive waste, repetitive cranial trauma, and a crayon lodged in the frontal lobe of his brain. In the 2001 episode \\"HOMR\\", Homer has the crayon removed, boosting his IQ to 105; although he bonds with Lisa, his newfound capacity for understanding and reason makes him unhappy, and he has the crayon reinserted. Homer often debates with his own mind, expressed in voiceover. His mind has a tendency to offer dubious advice, which occasionally helps him make the right decision, but often fails spectacularly. His mind has even become completely frustrated and, through sound effects, walked out on Homer. These exchanges were often introduced because they filled time and were easy for the animators to work on. They were phased out after the producers \\"used every possible permutation\\". Producer Mike Reiss said Homer was his favorite Simpsons character to write: \\"Homer's just a comedy writer's dream. He has everything wrong with him, every comedy trope. He's fat and bald and stupid and lazy and angry and an alcoholic. I'm pretty sure he embodies all seven deadly sins.\\" John Swartzwelder, who wrote 60 episodes, said he wrote for Homer as if he were \\"a big dog\\". Reiss felt this was insightful, saying: \\"Homer is just pure emotion, no long-term memory, everything is instant gratification. And, you know, has good dog qualities, too. I think, loyalty, friendliness, and just kind of continuous optimism.\\" Reception =Commendations= In 2000, Homer, along with the rest of the Simpson family, was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Homer's influence on comedy and culture has been significant. In 2010, Entertainment Weekly named Homer \\"the greatest character of the last 20 years\\". He was placed second on TV Guide's 2002 Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters, behind Bugs Bunny; fifth on Bravo's 100 Greatest TV Characters, one of only four cartoon characters on that list; and first in a Channel 4 poll of the greatest television characters of all time. In 2007, Entertainment Weekly placed Homer ninth on their list of the \\"50 Greatest TV icons\\" and first on their 2010 list of the \\"Top 100 Characters of the Past Twenty Years\\". Homer was also the runaway winner in British polls that determined who viewers thought was the \\"greatest American\\" and which fictional character people would like to see become the President of the United States. His relationship with Marge was included in TV Guide list of \\"The Best TV Couples of All Time\\". Dan Castellaneta has won several awards for voicing Homer, including four Primetime Emmy Awards for \\"Outstanding Voice-Over Performance\\" in 1992 for \\"Lisa's Pony\\", 1993 for \\"Mr. Plow\\", in 2004 for \\"Today I Am a Clown\\", and in 2009 for \\"Father Knows Worst\\". Although in the case of \\"Today I Am a Clown\\", it was for voicing \\"various characters\\" and not solely for Homer. In 2010, Castellaneta received a fifth Emmy nomination for voicing Homer and Grampa in the episode \\"Thursdays with Abie\\". In 1993, Castellaneta was given a special Annie Award, \\"Outstanding Individual Achievement in the Field of Animation\\", for his work as Homer on The Simpsons. In 2004, Castellaneta and Julie Kavner (the voice of Marge) won a Young Artist Award for \\"Most Popular Mom & Dad in a TV Series\\". In 2005, Homer and Marge were nominated for a Teen Choice Award for \\"Choice TV Parental Units\\". Various episodes in which Homer is strongly featured have won Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program, including \\"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\\" in 1991, \\"Lisa's Wedding\\" in 1995, \\"Homer's Phobia\\" in 1997, \\"Trash of the Titans\\" in 1998, \\"HOMR\\" in 2001, \\"Three Gays of the Condo\\" in 2003 and \\"Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind\\" in 2008. In 2000, Homer and the rest of the Simpson family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard. In 2017, Homer Simpson was celebrated by the National Baseball Hall of Fame, to honor the 25th anniversary of the episode \\"Homer at the Bat\\". =Analysis= Homer is an \\"everyman\\" and embodies several American stereotypes of working class blue-collar men: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, dim-witted, childish, clumsy and a borderline alcoholic. Matt Groening describes him as \\"completely ruled by his impulses\\". Dan Castellaneta calls him \\"a dog trapped in a man's body\\", adding, \\"He's incredibly loyal ‚Äì not entirely clean ‚Äì but you gotta love him.\\" In his book Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner describes Homer as \\"the most American of the Simpsons\\" and believes that while the other Simpson family members could be changed to other nationalities, Homer is \\"pure American\\". In the book God in the Details: American Religion in Popular Culture, the authors comment that \\"Homer's progress (or lack thereof) reveals a character who can do the right thing, if accidentally or begrudgingly.\\" The book The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer includes a chapter analyzing Homer's character from the perspective of Aristotelian virtue ethics. Raja Halwani writes that Homer's \\"love of life\\" is an admirable character trait, \\"for many people are tempted to see in Homer nothing but buffoonery and immorality. ... He is not politically correct, he is more than happy to judge others, and he certainly does not seem to be obsessed with his health. These qualities might not make Homer an admirable person, but they do make him admirable in some ways, and, more importantly, makes us crave him and the Homer Simpsons of this world.\\"Halwani, pp. 22‚Äì23 In 2008, Entertainment Weekly justified designating The Simpsons as a television classic by stating, \\"we all hail Simpson patriarch Homer because his joy is as palpable as his stupidity is stunning\\". In the season eight episode \\"Homer's Enemy\\" the writers decided to examine \\"what it would be like to actually work alongside Homer Simpson\\". The episode explores the possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic named Frank Grimes placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; however, in some scenes his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted. By the end of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering \\"real American hero\\", has become the villain; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious. In Gilligan Unbound, author Paul Arthur Cantor states that he believes Homer's devotion to his family has added to the popularity of the character. He writes, \\"Homer is the distillation of pure fatherhood. ... This is why, for all his stupidity, bigotry and self-centered quality, we cannot hate Homer. He continually fails at being a good father, but he never gives up trying, and in some basic and important sense that makes him a good father.\\" The Sunday Times remarked \\"Homer is good because, above all, he is capable of great love. When the chips are down, he always does the right thing by his children‚Äîhe is never unfaithful in spite of several opportunities.\\" Cultural influence Homer Simpson is one of the most popular and influential television characters by a variety of standards. USA Today cited the character as being one of the \\"top 25 most influential people of the past 25 years\\" in 2007, adding that Homer \\"epitomized the irony and irreverence at the core of American humor\\". Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse University's Center for the Study of Popular Television, believes that \\"three centuries from now, English professors are going to be regarding Homer Simpson as one of the greatest creations in human storytelling.\\" Animation historian Jerry Beck described Homer as one of the best animated characters, saying, \\"you know someone like it, or you identify with (it). That's really the key to a classic character.\\" Homer has been described by The Sunday Times as \\"the greatest comic creation of [modern] time\\". The article remarked, \\"every age needs its great, consoling failure, its lovable, pretension-free mediocrity. And we have ours in Homer Simpson.\\" Despite Homer's partial embodiment of American culture, his influence has spread to other parts of the world. In 2003, Matt Groening revealed that his father, after whom Homer was named, was Canadian, and said that this made Homer himself a Canadian. The character was later made an honorary citizen of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, because Homer Groening was believed to be from there, although sources say the senior Groening was actually born in the province of Saskatchewan. In 2007, an image of Homer was painted next to the Cerne Abbas Giant in Dorset, England as part of a promotion for The Simpsons Movie. This caused outrage among local neopagans who performed \\"rain magic\\" to try to get it washed away. In 2008, a defaced Spanish euro coin was found in Avil√©s, Spain with the face of Homer replacing the effigy of King Juan Carlos I. On April 9, 2009, the United States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44-cent stamps featuring Homer and the four other members of the Simpson family. They are the first characters from a television series to receive this recognition while the show is still in production. The stamps, designed by Matt Groening, were made available for purchase on May 7, 2009. Homer has appeared, voiced by Castellaneta, in several other television shows, including the sixth season of American Idol where he opened the show; The Tonight Show with Jay Leno where he performed a special animated opening monologue for the July 24, 2007, edition; and the 2008 fundraising television special Stand Up to Cancer where he was shown having a colonoscopy. On February 28, 1999, Homer Simpson was made an honorary member of the Junior Common Room of Worcester College, Oxford. Homer was granted the membership by the college's undergraduate body in the belief that ‚Ä≥he would benefit greatly from an Oxford education‚Ä≥. Homer has also been cited in the scientific litterature, in relation to low intelligence or cognitive abilities. A 2010 study from the Emory university showed that the RGS14 gene appeared to be impairing the development of cognitive abilities in mice (or, rather, that mice with a disabled RGS14 gene improved their cognitive abilities), prompting the authors to dub it the \\"Homer Simpson gene\\". =D'oh!= Homer's main and most famous catchphrase, the annoyed grunt \\"D'oh!\\", is typically uttered when he injures himself, realizes that he has done something stupid, or when something bad has happened or is about to happen to him. During the voice recording session for a Tracey Ullman Show short, Homer was required to utter what was written in the script as an \\"annoyed grunt\\". Dan Castellaneta rendered it as a drawn out \\"d'ooooooh\\". This was inspired by Jimmy Finlayson, the mustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in 33 Laurel and Hardy films. Finlayson had used the term as a minced oath to stand in for the word \\"Damn!\\" Matt Groening felt that it would better suit the timing of animation if it were spoken faster. Castellaneta then shortened it to a quickly uttered \\"D'oh!\\" The first intentional use of D'oh! occurred in the Ullman short \\"The Krusty the Clown Show\\" (1989), and its first usage in the series was in the series premiere, \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\". \\"D'oh!\\" was first added to The New Oxford Dictionary of English in 1998. It is defined as an interjection \\"used to comment on an action perceived as foolish or stupid\\". In 2001, \\"D'oh!\\" was added to the Oxford English Dictionary, without the apostrophe (\\"Doh!\\"). The definition of the word is \\"expressing frustration at the realization that things have turned out badly or not as planned, or that one has just said or done something foolish\\". In 2006, \\"D'oh!\\" was placed in sixth position on TV Land's list of the 100 greatest television catchphrases. \\"D'oh!\\" is also included in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. The book includes several other quotations from Homer, including \\"Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is never try\\", from \\"Burns' Heir\\" (season five, 1994) as well as \\"Kids are the best, Apu. You can teach them to hate the things you hate. And they practically raise themselves, what with the Internet and all\\", from \\"Eight Misbehavin'\\" (season 11, 1999). Both quotes entered the dictionary in August 2007. =Merchandising= Homer's inclusion in many Simpsons publications, toys, and other merchandise is evidence of his enduring popularity. The Homer Book, about Homer's personality and attributes, was released in 2004 and is commercially available. It has been described as \\"an entertaining little book for occasional reading\\" and was listed as one of \\"the most interesting books of 2004\\" by The Chattanoogan. Other merchandise includes dolls, posters, figurines, bobblehead dolls, mugs, alarm clocks, jigsaw puzzles, Chia Pets, and clothing such as slippers, T-shirts, baseball caps, and boxer shorts. Homer has appeared in commercials for Coke, 1-800-COLLECT, Burger King, Butterfinger, C.C. Lemon, Church's Chicken, Domino's Pizza, Intel, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Ramada Inn, Subway and T.G.I. Friday's. In 2004, Homer starred in a MasterCard Priceless commercial that aired during Super Bowl XXXVIII. In 2001, Kelloggs launched a brand of cereal called \\"Homer's Cinnamon Donut Cereal\\", which was available for a limited time. In June 2009, Dutch automotive navigation systems manufacturer TomTom announced that Homer would be added to its downloadable GPS voice lineup. Homer's voice, recorded by Dan Castellaneta, features several in-character comments such as \\"Take the third right. We might find an ice cream truck! Mmm... ice cream.\\" Homer has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons. He has appeared in every one of The Simpsons video games, including the most recent, The Simpsons Game. Homer appears as a playable character in the toys-to-life video game Lego Dimensions, released via a \\"Level Pack\\" packaged with Homer's Car and \\"Taunt- o-Vision\\" accessories in September 2015; the pack also adds an additional level based on the episode \\"The Mysterious Voyage of Homer\\". Alongside the television series, Homer regularly appears in issues of Simpsons Comics, which were first published on November 29, 1993, and are still issued monthly. Homer also plays a role in The Simpsons Ride, launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood. References =Citations= =Sources=  * Further reading Fink, Moritz (2019).

It became the world's leading manufacturer of book and newspaper typesetting equipment; outside North America, its only serious challenger for book production was the Anglo-American Monotype Corporation. It also offered phototypesetting and digital products before being taken over by Monotype Imaging in 2006. Since March 2013, its legal name has been changed to Monotype GmbH. Founding An 1896 Mergenthaler Linotype stock certificate The invention of a machine to replace the labor-intensive task of setting type by hand had been tackled by many inventors during the 19th century. The most time consumed was not in creating the text, but in returning the characters to their proper position for future use. Mergenthaler solved this problem by placing a type mold for a letter on the side of a specially keyed matrix (with multiple matrix/molds available for any given letter). The linotype operator would type in a line of text. The machine would drop each matrix with its mold into place, assembling the matrices into a line of text that was needed. Hot lead alloy was then forced into the molds of matrices, creating the fresh line of type. The linotype operator would then go on to type in the next line. Multiple lines would be stacked into blocks, sometimes paragraphs, to be set in place in the proper column of the page layout. Meanwhile, back inside the linotype machine, the matrices used for a line would progress through the machine, where the special keying system on one end of the matrix, unique for each character, would allow the matrix to drop back only into the correct storage slot, ready for the next use. Another benefit of this overall process was that each edition of the paper was created from a fresh casting of metal, thus avoiding problems of type wear. Another problem Mergenthaler solved was in justifying the type, or ensuring that in a column of print, there were flush margins on the left and right. Hand compositors had previously done this by using spaces of different widths in a line, to ensure that the lines all ended at the same point. Mergenthaler adapted the \\"space band\\" (patented by J. W. Schuckers), a device consisting of two wedges of metal connected loosely. When a line of type was being justified, all the space band wedges would be pushed up in two passes to spread the line out to the full measure being cast. The space bands were stored for reuse in a different location from the matrices. History The invention of the first working Linotype was a long, arduous and intricate process that involved many players and the creation of a long succession of companies. In 1877, the National Printing Company was organized under the laws of the District of Columbia and Lewis Clephane, the brother of James O. Clephane, was elected president. After the first successful trial of the Linotype in October, 1885, the Merganthaler Printing Company was established to raise fresh capital from the shareholders of the National Printing Company.. Finally, The Merganthaler Linotype Company was formed in New York in 1895. Philip Tell Dodge served as its first president until 1928 when his son Norman Dodge replaced him. In 1889 The Linotype Company, a British offshoot of the firm, was formed by Joseph Lawrence, publisher of The Railway Magazine. In 1899, a new factory in Broadheath, Altrincham was opened. In 1903, the British company merged with Machinery Trust to form Linotype & Machinery Ltd. Mergenthaler Linotype dominated the printing industry through the twentieth century. The machines were so well designed, major parts remained virtually unchanged for nearly 100 years. A particularly notable success was Linotype's Legibility Group of typefaces, used by most of the world's (Latin-alphabet) newspapers for much of the twentieth century. The ruggedness of the Linotype system, which cast lines as solid bars of type, aided this dominance. Linotype Company was merged with Merganthaler acquisition K. S. Paul to form Linotype-Paul Ltd which developed a range of Linotron phototypesetters using K. S. Paul's cathode ray tube technology.https://www.gxpress.net/derek-kyte-uk-pioneer-of-crt-typesetting- dies-at-90-cms-10813 A woman operates a Linotron 505, a cathode ray tube phototypesetting machine. Dresden, 1983. The company, as so many in the printing industry, endured a complex post-war history, during which printing technology went through two revolutions -- first moving to phototypesetting, then to digital. During the 1950s, the Davidson Corporation, which manufactured a series of small offset presses, was a subsidiary of Linotype. This was later sold to American Type Founders and operated under the name ATF- Davidson. Through a series of mergers and reorganizations, the business of Mergenthaler Linotype Company ultimately vested in Linotype-Hell AG, a German company. In April 1997, Linotype-Hell AG was acquired by Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG. The following month certain divisions of Linotype-Hell AG were spun off into new companies, one of which was Linotype Library GmbH with headquarters at Bad Homburg vor der H√∂he. This new company was responsible solely for the acquisition, creation and distribution of digital fonts and related software. This spin-off effectively divorced the company's font software business from the older typesetting business which was retained by Heidelberg. In 2005, Linotype Library GmbH shortened its name to Linotype GmbH, and in 2007, Linotype GmbH was acquired by Monotype Imaging Holdings, Inc., the parent of Monotype Imaging, Inc. and others. Typefaces The typefaces in the Linotype type library are the artwork of some of the most famous typeface designers of the 20th century. The library contains such famous trademarked typefaces as Palatino and Optima by Hermann Zapf; Frutiger, Avenir and Univers by Adrian Frutiger; and Helvetica by Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffman. Linotype GmbH frequently brings out new designs from both established and new type designers. Linotype has also introduced FontExplorer X for Mac OS X. It is a well-reviewed font manager that allows users to browse and purchase new fonts within the program ‚Äî a business model similar to that used by iTunes and the iTunes Store. The simplified Arabic typeface Yakout, named for the 13th-century Islamic calligrapher Yaqut al-Musta'simi, was released by Linotype in 1956, and remains one of the most common Arabic typefaces for books and newspapers.

Junk food is unhealthful food that is high in calories from sugar or fat, with little dietary fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals, or other important forms of nutritional value. Precise definitions vary by purpose and over time. Some high-protein foods, like meat prepared with saturated fat, may be considered junk food. The term HFSS foods (high in fat, salt and sugar) is used synonymously. Fast food and fast food restaurants are often equated with junk food, although fast foods cannot be categorically described as junk food. Most junk food is highly processed food. Concerns about the negative health effects resulting from a junk food-heavy diet, especially obesity, have resulted in public health awareness campaigns, and restrictions on advertising and sale in several countries. Junk food is a pejorative dating back at least to the 1950s. Origin of the term The term junk food dates back at least to the early 1950s, although its coinage has been credited to Michael F. Jacobson of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in 1972. In 1952, the phrase appeared in a headline in the Lima, Ohio, News, \\"'Junk Foods' Cause Serious Malnutrition\\", over a reprint of a 1948 article from the Ogden, Utah, Standard-Examiner, originally titled, \\"Dr. Brady‚Äôs Health Column: More Junk Than Food\\". In the article, Dr. Brady writes, \\"What Mrs. H calls 'junk' I call cheat food. That is anything made principally of (1) white flour and or (2) refined white sugar or syrup. For example, white bread, crackers, cake, candy, ice cream soda, chocolate malted, sundaes, sweetened carbonated beverages.\\" \\"Barry Popik is a contributor to the Oxford English Dictionary, Dictionary of American Regional English, Historical Dictionary of American Slang, Yale Book of Quotations and Dictionary of Modern Proverbs. Since 1990 he has also been a regular contributor to Gerald Cohen's Comments on Etymology. He is recognized as an expert on the origins of the terms Big Apple, Windy City, hot dog, hamburger and many other food terms, and he is an editor of the Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink.\\" - The Big Apple: About The term cheat food can be traced back in newspaper mentions to at least 1916. Definitions Whether foods such as pizza are considered junk food depends upon how they are made. In Andrew F. Smith's Encyclopedia of Junk Food and Fast Food, junk food is defined as \\"those commercial products, including candy, bakery goods, ice cream, salty snacks and soft drinks, which have little or no nutritional value but do have plenty of calories, salt, and fats. While not all fast foods are junk foods, most are. Fast foods are ready-to-eat foods served promptly after ordering. Some fast foods are high in calories and low in nutritional value, while other fast foods, such as salads, may be low in calories and high in nutritional value.\\" Junk food provides empty calories, supplying little or none of the protein, vitamins, or minerals required for a nutritious diet. Many foods, such as hamburgers, pizza, and tacos, can be considered either healthy or junk food, depending on their ingredients and preparation methods. The more highly processed items usually fall under the junk food category, including breakfast cereals that are mostly sugar or high fructose corn syrup and white flour or milled corn. The United Kingdom's Advertising Standards Authority, the self-regulatory agency for the UK ad industry, uses nutrient profiling to define junk food. Foods are scored for \\"A\\" nutrients (energy, saturated fat, total sugar and sodium) and \\"C\\" nutrients (fruit, vegetables and nut content, fiber and protein). The difference between A and C scores determines whether a food or beverage is categorized as HFSS (high in fat, salt and sugar; a term synonymous with junk food). In Panic Nation: Unpicking the Myths We're Told About Food and Health, the junk food label is described as nutritionally meaningless: food is food, and if there is zero nutritional value, then it isn't a food. Co-editor Vincent Marks explains, \\"To label a food as 'junk' is just another way of saying, 'I disapprove of it.' There are bad diets - that is, bad mixtures and quantities of food - but there are no 'bad foods' except those that have become bad through contamination or deterioration.\\" Vincent Marks is an Emeritus Professor of Clinical Biochemistry at the University of Surrey. History According to an article in the New York Times, \\"Let Us Now Praise the Great Men of Junk Food\\", \\"The history of junk food is a largely American tale: It has been around for hundreds of years, in many parts of the world, but no one has done a better job inventing so many varieties of it, branding it, mass-producing it, making people rich off it and, of course, eating it.\\" Cracker Jack, the candy-coated popcorn-and-peanuts confection, is credited as the first popular name brand junk food; it was created in Chicago, registered in 1896, and became the best-selling candy in the world 20 years later. Popularity and appeal Junk food in its various forms is extremely popular, and an integral part of modern popular culture. In the US, annual fast food sales are in the area of $160 billion, compared to supermarket sales of $620 billion (a figure which also includes junk food in the form of convenience foods, snack foods, and candy). In 1976, the US Top 10 pop song, \\"Junk Food Junkie\\", described a junk food addict who pretends to follow a healthy diet by day, while at night gorges on Hostess Twinkies and Fritos corn chips, McDonald's and KFC. Thirty-six years later, Time placed the Twinkie at #1 in an article titled, \\"Top 10 Iconic Junk Foods\\": \\"Not only...a mainstay on our supermarket shelves and in our bellies, they've been a staple in our popular culture and, above all, in our hearts. Often criticized for its lack of any nutritional value whatsoever, the Twinkie has managed to persevere as a cultural and gastronomical icon.\\" America also celebrates an annual National Junk Food Day on July 21. Origins are unclear; it is one of around 175 US food and drink days, most created by \\"people who want to sell more food\\", at times aided by elected officials at the request of a trade association or commodity group. \\"In honor of the day,\\" Time in 2014 published, \\"5 Crazy Junk Food Combinations\\". Headlines from other national and local media coverage include: \\"Celebrate National Junk Food Day With‚Ä¶ Beer-Flavored Oreos?\\" (MTV); \\"National Junk Food Day: Pick your favorite unhealthy treats in this poll\\" (Baltimore); \\"Celebrities' favorite junk food\\" (Los Angeles); \\"A Nutritionist's Guide to National Junk Food Day\\" with \\"Rules for Splurging\\" (Huffington Post); and \\"It's National Junk Food Day: Got snacks?\\" (Kansas City). As for junk food's appeal, there is no definitive scientific answer, both physiological and psychological factors are cited. Food manufacturers spend billions of dollars on research and development to create flavor profiles that trigger the human affinity for sugar, salt, and fat. Consumption results in pleasurable, likely addictive, effects in the brain. At the same time, massive marketing efforts are deployed, creating powerful brand loyalties that studies have shown will trump taste. It is well-established that the poor eat more junk food overall than the more affluent, but the reasons for this are not clear. \\"A large body of epidemiologic data show that diet quality follows a socioeconomic gradient. Whereas higher-quality diets are associated with greater affluence, energy- dense diets that are nutrient-poor are preferentially consumed by persons of lower socioeconomic status (SES) and of more limited economic means. ... However, a convincing causal relation between SES indicators and diet quality still remains to be established.\\" Few studies have focused on variations in food perception according to socio-economic status (SES); some studies that have differentiated based on SES suggest that the economically challenged don't perceive healthy food much differently than any other segment of the population. \\"This article‚Äôs aim is to review and summarize the literature on the perceptions of healthy eating ... Databases, the worldwide web, selected journals and reference lists were searched for relevant papers from the last 20 years. Reviewed articles suggest relative homogeneity in the perceptions of healthy eating despite the studies being conducted in different countries and involving different age groups, sexes and socio-economic status.\\" Also, \\"...the small number of studies that focused on variations in perceptions according to socio-economic status...\\" Recent research into scarcity, combining behavioral science and economics, suggests that, faced with extreme economic uncertainty, where even the next meal may not be a sure thing, judgment is impaired and the drive is to the instant gratification of junk food, rather than to making the necessary investment in the longer-term benefits of a healthier diet.  Health effects  When junk food is consumed very often, the excess fat, simple carbohydrates, and processed sugar found in junk food contributes to an increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and many other chronic health conditions. A case study on consumption of fast foods in Ghana suggested a direct correlation between consumption of junk food and obesity rates. The report asserts that obesity resulted in related complex health concerns such upsurge of heart attack rates. Studies reveal that as early as the age of 30, arteries could begin clogging and lay the groundwork for future heart attacks. Consumers also tend to eat too much in one sitting, and those who have satisfied their appetite with junk food are less likely to eat healthy foods like fruit or vegetables.Junk-Food Facts Testing on rats has indicated negative effects of junk food that may manifest likewise in people. A Scripps Research Institute study in 2008 suggested that junk food consumption alters brain activity in a manner similar to addictive drugs like cocaine and heroin. After many weeks with unlimited access to junk food, the pleasure centers of rat brains became desensitized, requiring more food for pleasure; after the junk food was taken away and replaced with a healthy diet, the rats starved for two weeks instead of eating nutritious fare. A 2007 study in the British Journal of Nutrition found that female rats who eat junk food during pregnancy increased the likelihood of unhealthy eating habits in their offspring.Craving for junk food 'inherited' Mothers who eat junk food during pregnancy may be condemning their children to crave the same diet, according to animal tests. BBC News. 14 August 2007. Study title: \\"A maternal ‚Äòjunk food‚Äô diet in pregnancy and lactation promotes an exacerbated taste for ‚Äòjunk food‚Äô and a greater propensity for obesity in rat offspring.\\" Other research has been done on the impact of sugary foods on emotional health in humans, and has suggested that consumption of junk food can negatively impact energy levels and emotional well-being. In a study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the frequency of consumption of 57 foods/drinks of 4000 children at the age of four and a half were collected by maternal report. At age seven, the 4000 children were given the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), with five scales: hyperactivity, conduct problems, peer problems, emotional symptoms and pro-social behavior. A one standard deviation increase in junk food was then linked to excessive hyperactivity in 33% of the subjects, leading to the conclusion that children consuming excess junk food at the age of seven are more likely to be in the top third of the hyperactivity scale. There was no significant correlation between junk food and the other scales. Anti-junk food measures A number of countries have taken, or are considering, various forms of legislative action to curb junk food consumption. In 2014, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to health, Anand Grover, released his report, \\"Unhealthy foods, non-communicable diseases and the right to health\\", and called for governments to \\"take measures, such as developing food and nutrition guidelines for healthy diets, regulating marketing and advertising of junk food, adopting consumer-friendly labeling of food products, and establishing accountability mechanisms for violations of the right to health.\\" An early, high-profile and controversial attempt to identify and curb junk food in the American diet was undertaken by the McGovern Committee (United States Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, chaired by Senator George McGovern) between 1968 and 1977. Initially formed to investigate malnutrition and hunger in the US, the committee's scope progressively expanded to include environmental conditions that affected eating habits, such as urban decay, then focused on the diet and nutritional habits of the American public. The committee took issue with the use of salt, sugar and fat in processed foods, noted problems with overeating and the high percentage of ads for junk food on TV, and stated that bad eating habits could be as deadly as smoking. The findings were heavily criticized and rebutted from many directions, including the food industry, the American Medical Association, and within the committee itself. In 1977, the committee issued public guidelines under the title, Dietary Goals for the United States, which became the predecessor to Dietary Guidelines for Americans, published every five years beginning in 1980 by the US Department of Health and Human Services.Warren Belasco (1989) Appetite for Change: how the counterculture took on the food industry 1966 ‚Äî 1988, page 148-153, Pantheon Books =Taxation= In an attempt to reduce junk food consumption through price control, forms of Pigovian taxation have been implemented. Targeting saturated fat consumption, Denmark introduced the world's first fat-food tax in October, 2011, by imposing a surcharge on all foods, including those made from natural ingredients, that contain more than 2.3 percent saturated fat (not a Cancer causing Food according to American Institute for Cancer Research), an unpopular measure that lasted a little over a year. Hungary has imposed taxes on foods and beverages high in added sugar, fat, and salt. Norway taxes refined sugar, and Mexico has various excises on unhealthy food. On April 1, 2015, the first fat tax in the US, the Navajo Nation's Healthy Din√© Nation Act of 2014, mandating a 2% junk food tax, came into effect, covering the of Navajo reservation; the Act targeted problems with obesity and diabetes among the Navajo population. =Restriction on advertising to children= Some governments have considered taxes and limits on advertising or displaying junk food for sale. Junk food that is targeted at children is a contentious issue. In \\"The Impact of Advertising on Childhood obesity\\", the American Psychological Association reports: \\"Research has found strong associations between increases in advertising for non-nutritious foods and rates of childhood obesity.\\" The World Health Organization recommends that governments take action to limit children's exposure to food marketing, stating, \\"Many advertisements promote foods high in fats, sugar and salt, consumption of which should be limited as part of a healthy diet. ... Food advertising and other forms of marketing have been shown to influence children‚Äôs food preferences, purchasing behaviour and overall dietary behaviour. Marketing has also been associated with an increased risk of overweight and obesity in children. The habits children develop early in life may encourage them to adopt unhealthy dietary practices which persist into adulthood, increasing the likelihood of overweight, obesity and associated health problems such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\\" In the UK, efforts to increasingly limit or eliminate advertising of foods high in sugar, salt or fat at any time when children may be viewing are ongoing. The UK government has been criticized for failing to do enough to stop advertising and promotion of junk food aimed at children.Supermarkets must stop discounting unhealthy foods to tackle child obesity, say MPs The Guardian A UK parliamentary select committee recommended that cartoon characters advertising unhealthy food to children should be banned, supermarkets should have to remove unhealthy sweets and snacks from ends of aisles and checkout areas, local authorities should be able to limit the number of fast food outlets in their area, brands associated with unhealthy foods should be banned from sponsoring sports clubs, youth leagues and tournaments, and social media like Facebook should cut down junk food advertising to children‚Äîall are currently just recommendations.'Ban cartoon characters' on unhealthy food, MPs say BBC In Australia, a Wollongong University study in 2015 showed that junk food sponsors were mentioned over 1,000 times in a single Australian cricket match broadcast, which included ads, and branding worn on players' uniforms and on the scoreboard and pitch. A coalition of Australian obesity, cancer and diabetes organizations called on Cricket Australia, the sport's governing body, to \\"phase out sponsorships with unhealthy brands\\", emphasizing that cricket is a \\"healthy, family-oriented sport\\" with children in the audience.

It can be used as a flavoring in puddings and desserts, as a filling in bonbons, or as a topping for ice cream and custard. The process of caramelization consists of heating sugar slowly to around . As the sugar heats, the molecules break down and re-form into compounds with a characteristic color and flavor. A variety of candies, desserts, toppings, and confections are made with caramel: brittles, nougats, pralines, flan, cr√®me br√ªl√©e, cr√®me caramel, and caramel apples. Ice creams sometimes are flavored with or contain swirls of caramel. Etymology The English word comes from French caramel, borrowed from Spanish caramelo (18th century), itself possibly from Portuguese caramel.American Heritage Dictionary, 5th edition, 2011, s.v. Most likely that comes from Late Latin calamellus 'sugar cane', a diminutive of calamus 'reed, cane', itself from Greek Œ∫Œ¨ŒªŒ±ŒºŒøœÇ. Less likely, it comes from a Medieval Latin cannamella, from canna 'cane' + mella 'honey'.Oxford English Dictionary, 1st edition, 1888, s.v. Finally, some dictionaries connect it to an Arabic kora-moƒßall√°h 'ball of sweet'.Littr√©, Dictionnaire de la langue fran√ßaise, s.v.The arguments are summarized in Paget Toynbee, \\"Cennamella\\"--\\"Caramel\\"--\\"Canamell\\", The Academy, 34:864:338, November 24, 1888. Caramel sauce Caramel sauce is made by mixing caramelized sugar with cream. Depending on the intended application, additional ingredients such as butter, fruit purees, liquors, or vanilla can be used. Caramel sauce is used in a variety of desserts, especially as a topping for ice cream. When it is used for cr√®me caramel or flan, it is known as clear caramel and only contains caramelized sugar and water. Butterscotch sauce is made with brown sugar, butter, and cream. Traditionally, butterscotch is a hard candy more in line with a toffee. Toffee Milk caramel manufactured as square candies, either for eating or for melting down. Toffee, sometimes called \\"caramel candy\\", is a soft, dense, chewy candy made by boiling a mixture of milk or cream, sugar(s), glucose, butter, and vanilla (or vanilla flavoring). The sugar and glucose are heated separately to reach ; the cream and butter are then added which cools the mixture. The mixture is then stirred and reheated until it reaches . Upon completion of cooking, vanilla or any additional flavorings and salt are added. Adding the vanilla or flavorings earlier would result in them burning off at the high temperatures. Adding salt earlier in the process would result in inverting the sugars as they cooked. Alternatively, all ingredients may be cooked together. In this procedure, the mixture is not heated above the firm ball stage (), so that caramelization of the milk occurs. This temperature is not high enough to caramelize sugar and this type of candy is often called milk caramel or cream caramel. Salted caramel Salted caramel was invented in 1977 by the French pastry chef Henri Le Roux in Quiberon, Brittany, in the form of a salted butter caramel with crushed nuts (caramel au beurre sal√©), using Breton demi-sel butter.Brian Edwards, \\"Salted Caramel - that ubiquitous flavour which is actually only as old as Star Wars\\", Mirror, Feb 25, 2015 It was named the \\"Best confectionery in France\\" (Meilleur Bonbon de France) at the Paris Salon International de la Confiserie in 1980. He registered the trademark \\"CBS\\" (caramel au beurre sal√©) the year after.\\"Henri Le Roux: L'histoire d'un Ma√Ætre Chocolatier-Caram√©lier\\", web site of Maison Le Roux In the late 1990s, the Parisian pastry chef Pierre Herm√© introduced his salted butter and caramel macaroons and, by 2000, high-end chefs started adding a bit of salt to caramel and chocolate dishes. In 2008 it entered the mass market, when H√§agen-Dazs and Starbucks started selling it.Kim Severson, \\"How Caramel Developed a Taste for Salt\\", The New York Times, December 30, 2008 Originally used in desserts, the confection has seen wide use elsewhere, including in hot chocolate and spirits such as vodka. Its popularity may come from its effects on the reward systems of the human brain, resulting in \\"hedonic escalation\\". Caramel colouring Caramel colouring, a dark, bitter liquid, is the highly concentrated product of near total caramelization, used commercially as food and beverage colouring, e.g., in cola. Chemistry Caramelization is the removal of water from a sugar, proceeding to isomerization and polymerization of the sugars into various high-molecular-weight compounds. Compounds such as difructose anhydride may be created from the monosaccharides after water loss. Fragmentation reactions result in low-molecular-weight compounds that may be volatile and may contribute to flavor. Polymerization reactions lead to larger-molecular-weight compounds that contribute to the dark-brown color. In modern recipes and in commercial production, glucose (from corn syrup or wheat) or invert sugar is added to prevent crystallization, making up 10%‚Äì50% of the sugars by mass. \\"Wet caramels\\" made by heating sucrose and water instead of sucrose alone produce their own invert sugar due to thermal reaction, but not necessarily enough to prevent crystallization in traditional recipes.

FontForge, an open source application for developing digital fonts Type design is the art and process of designing typefaces. It is often used synonymously with the term \\"font design,\\" because most non-designers refer to fonts, rather than typefaces. A typeface differs from other modes of graphic production such as handwriting and drawing in that it is the mechanical storage and dispensation of alphanumeric characters. Each of the characters is stored in a master archetype form and then a user, by means of hand picking (handset metal type), a keyboard (linotype and desktop publishing) or other means (voice recognition) selects individual characters to \\"set\\" into the text.  History  The technology of printing text using movable type was invented in China, but the vast number of Chinese characters, and the esteem with which calligraphy was held, meant that few distinctive, complete fonts were created in China in the early centuries of printing. Gutenberg's most important innovation in the mid 15th century development of his press was not the printing itself, but the casting of Latinate types. Unlike Chinese characters, which are based on a uniform square area, European Latin characters vary in width, from the very wide \\"M\\" to the slender \\"l\\". Gutenberg developed an adjustable mold which could accommodate an infinite variety of widths. From then until at least 400 years later, type started with cutting punches, which would be struck into a brass \\"matrix\\". The matrix was inserted into the bottom of the adjustable mold and the negative space formed by the mold cavity plus the matrix acted as the master for each letter that was cast. The casting material was an alloy usually containing lead, which had a low melting point, cooled readily, and could be easily filed and finished. In those early days, type design had to not only imitate the familiar handwritten forms common to readers, but also account for the limitations of the printing process, such as the rough papers of uneven thicknesses, the squeezing or splashing properties of the ink, and the eventual wear on the type itself. Beginning in the 1890s, each character was drawn in a very large size for the American Type Founders Corporation and a few others using their technology‚Äîover a foot (30 cm) high. The outline was then traced by a Benton pantograph-based engraving machine with a pointer at the hand-held vertex and a cutting tool at the opposite vertex down to a size usually less than a quarter-inch (6 mm). The pantographic engraver was first used to cut punches, and later to directly create matrices. In the late 1960s through the 1980s, typesetting moved from metal to photo composition. During this time, type design made a similar transition from physical matrixes to hand drawn letters on vellum or mylar and then the precise cutting of \\"rubyliths.\\" Rubylith was a common material in the printing trade, in which a red transparent film, very soft and pliable, was bonded to a supporting clear acetate. Placing the ruby over the master drawing of the letter, the craftsman would gently and precisely cut through the upper film and peel the non-image portions away. The resulting letterform, now existing as the remaining red material still adhering to the clear substrate, would then be ready to be photographed using a reproduction camera. With the coming of computers, type design became a form of computer graphics. Initially, this transition occurred with a program called Ikarus around 1980, but widespread transition began with programs such as Aldus Freehand and Adobe Illustrator, and finally to dedicated type design programs called font editors, such as Fontographer and FontLab. This process occurred rapidly: by the mid-1990s, virtually all commercial type design had transitioned to digital vector drawing programs. Each glyph design can be drawn or traced by a stylus on a digitizing board, or modified from a scanned drawing, or composed entirely within the program itself. Each glyph is then in a digital form, either in a bitmap (pixel-based) or vector (scalable outline) format. A given digitization of a typeface can easily be modified by another type designer; such a modified font is usually considered a derivative work, and is covered by the copyright of the original font software. Type design could be copyrighted typeface by typeface in many countries, though not the United States. The United States offered and continues to offer design patents as an option for typeface design protection. Principles The design of a legible text-based typeface remains one of the most challenging assignments in graphic design. The even visual quality of the reading material being of paramount importance, each drawn character (called a glyph) must be even in appearance with every other glyph regardless of order or sequence. Also, if the typeface is to be versatile, it must appear the same whether it is small or large. Because of optical illusions that occur when we apprehend small or large objects, this entails that in the best fonts, a version is designed for small use and another version is drawn for large, display, applications. Also, large letterforms reveal their shape, whereas small letterforms in text settings reveal only their textures: this requires that any typeface that aspires to versatility in both text and display, needs to be evaluated in both of these visual domains. A beautifully shaped typeface may not have a particularly attractive or legible texture when seen in text settings. Spacing is also an important part of type design. Each glyph consists not only of the shape of the character, but also the white space around it. The type designer must consider the relationship of the space within a letter form (the counter) and the letter spacing between them. Designing type requires many accommodations for the quirks of human perception, \\"optical corrections\\" required to make shapes look right, in ways that diverge from what might seem mathematically right. For example, round shapes need to be slightly bigger than square ones to appear \\"the same\\" size (\\"overshoot\\"), and vertical lines need to be thicker than horizontal ones to appear the same thickness. For a character to be perceived as geometrically round, it must usually be slightly \\"squared\\" off (made slightly wider at the shoulders). As a result of all these subtleties, excellence in type design is highly respected in the design professions. Profession Type design is performed by a type designer. It is a craft, blending elements of art and science. In the pre-digital era it was primarily learned through apprenticeship and professional training within the industry. Since the mid-1990s it has become the subject of dedicated degree programs at a handful of universities, including the MA Typeface Design at the University of Reading (UK) and the Type Media program at the KABK (Royal Academy of Art in the Hague). At the same time, the transition to digital type and font editors which can be inexpensive (or even open source and free) has led to a great democratization of type design; the craft is accessible to anyone with the interest to pursue it, nevertheless, it may take a very long time for the serious artist to master. Israeli typographer Henri Friedlaender examines Hadassah Hebrew typeface sketches. The sequence was shot in his study in Motza-Illit (near Jerusalem) in 1978.

Corn syrup, also known as glucose syrup to confectioners, is used in foods to soften texture, add volume, prevent crystallization of sugar, and enhance flavor. Corn syrup is distinct from high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is manufactured from corn syrup by converting a large proportion of its glucose into fructose using the enzyme D-xylose isomerase, thus producing a sweeter compound due to higher levels of fructose. The more general term glucose syrup is often used synonymously with corn syrup, since glucose syrup in the United States is most commonly made from corn starch.Structure of the world starch market, European Commission - Directorate Agricultural and Rural development, Evaluation of the Community Policy for Starch and Starch Products, Final report 2002, Chapter 1, page 3 Technically, glucose syrup is any liquid starch hydrolysate of mono-, di-, and higher-saccharides and can be made from any source of starch; wheat, tapioca and potatoes are the most common other sources.Wheat starch, Application, International Starch Institute DenmarkGlobal casave outlook; Guy Henry, Andrew Westby; 2007; page 600  Commercial preparation  Historically, corn syrup was produced by combining corn starch with dilute hydrochloric acid, and then heating the mixture under pressure. The process was invented by the German chemist Gottlieb Kirchhoff in 1812. Currently, corn syrup is obtained through a multi-step bioprocess. First, the enzyme Œ±-amylase is added to a mixture of corn starch and water. Œ±-amylase is secreted by various species of the bacterium genus Bacillus and the enzyme is isolated from the liquid in which the bacteria were grown. The enzyme breaks down the starch into oligosaccharides, which are then broken into glucose molecules by adding the enzyme glucoamylase, known also as \\"Œ≥-amylase\\". Glucoamylase is secreted by various species of the fungus Aspergillus; the enzyme is isolated from the liquid in which the fungus is grown. The glucose can then be transformed into fructose by passing the glucose through a column that is loaded with the enzyme D-xylose isomerase, an enzyme that is isolated from the growth medium of any of several bacteria.Martin Chaplin and Christopher Bucke, Enzyme Technology (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1990), pages 146-154. Available on-line at: London South Bank University: Enzyme Technology. See \\"Chapter 4: The large-scale use of enzymes in solution\\", sections: * The use of enzymes in starch hydrolysis * Production of glucose syrup Corn syrup is produced from number 2 yellow dent corn.\\"Dent corn\\" (Zea mays var. indentata) is so called because the tops of its kernels are slightly indented. See Merriam-Webster dictionary. When wet milled, about 2.3 litres of corn are required to yield an average of 947g of starch, to produce 1 kg of glucose syrup. A bushel (25 kg) of corn will yield an average of 31.5 pounds (14.3 kg) of starch, which in turn will yield about 33.3 pounds (15.1 kg) of syrup. Thus, it takes about 2,300 litres of corn to produce a tonne of glucose syrup, or 60 bushels (1524 kg) of corn to produce one short ton.Trends in U.S. production and use of glucose syrup and dextrose, 1965-1990, and prospects for the future - U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Economic Research Service report The viscosity and sweetness of the syrup depends on the extent to which the hydrolysis reaction has been carried out. To distinguish different grades of syrup, they are rated according to their dextrose equivalent (DE). Most commercially available corn syrups are approximately 1/3 glucose by weight. Two common commercial corn syrup products are light and dark corn syrup. *Light corn syrup is corn syrup seasoned with vanilla flavor and salt. Light corn syrup is clear and tastes moderately sweet. *Dark corn syrup is a combination of corn syrup and molasses (or Refiners' syrup), caramel color and flavor, salt, and the preservative sodium benzoate. Dark corn syrup is a warm brown color and tastes much stronger than light corn syrup. Molasses in dark corn syrup enhances its flavor and color.  Uses  Karo advertisement, 1917. Corn syrup's major uses in commercially prepared foods are as a thickener, a sweetener, and as a humectant - an ingredient that retains moisture and thus maintains a food's freshness. Corn syrup (or HFCS) is the primary ingredient in most brands of commercial \\"pancake syrup\\", as a less expensive substitute for maple syrup. In the United States, cane sugar quotas raise the price of sugar; hence, domestically produced corn syrup and high-fructose corn syrup are less costly alternatives that are often used in American-made processed and mass-produced foods, candies, soft drinks, and fruit drinks. Glucose syrup was the primary corn sweetener in the United States prior to the expanded use of high fructose corn syrup production. HFCS is a variant in which other enzymes are used to convert some of the glucose into fructose. The resulting syrup is sweeter and more soluble. If mixed with sugar, water, and cream of tartar, corn syrup can be used to make sugar glass.

Demand for such a typeface was recognized by Virginia Howlett of Microsoft's typography group and commissioned by Steve Ballmer. The name \\"Verdana\\" is based on verdant (something green), and Ana (the name of Howlett's eldest daughter). Bearing similarities to humanist sans-serif typefaces such as Frutiger, Verdana was designed to be readable at small sizes on the low-resolution computer screens of the period. Like many designs of this type, Verdana has a large x-height (tall lower-case characters), with wider proportions and looser letter-spacing than on print-orientated designs like Helvetica. The counters and apertures are wide, to keep strokes clearly separate from one another, and similarly-shaped letters are designed to appear clearly different to increase legibility for body text. The bold weight is thicker than would be normal with fonts for print use, suiting the limitations of onscreen display. Carter has described spacing as an area he particularly worked on during the design process. Distinctive visual identifiable characteristics The comparison of Tahoma and Verdana Characteristics of the typeface are: ;Lower case *there is a square dot over the letter i *the lowercase j has a serif on top that protrudes left *the a is double-story ;Upper case *the capital Q's tail is centered under the figure *the uppercase J has a serif on the top that protrudes left *the uppercase I has two serifs on the top and bottom As an example of the approach of making similar characters easily distinguishable, the digit 1 (one) in Verdana was given a horizontal base and a hook in the upper left to distinguish it from lowercase l (L) and uppercase I (i). This is similar to the digit \\"1\\" found in Morris Fuller Benton's sans-serif typefaces News Gothic and Franklin Gothic. Prevalence Released in 1996, Verdana was bundled with subsequent versions of the Windows operating system, as well as their Office and Internet Explorer software on Windows, classic Mac OS, and Mac OS X. Since at least Mac OS X 10.4 it is even bundled with Mac OS itself. In addition, up until 2002 it was available for download from Microsoft's web site as freeware (\\".exe\\" files for Microsoft Windows and in \\".sit.hqx\\" archives for Mac OS) under a proprietary license imposing some restrictions on usage and distribution, allowing it to be used by end users in any system supporting installation of \\"exe\\" or \\".sit.hqx\\" files and supporting TrueType fonts. The downloadable files are still available legally from third-party web sites; see the External links section. However, these files include only old versions of Verdana and updated versions are not available as a freeware. According to one long-running survey, the availability of Verdana is 99.70% on Windows, 98.05% on computers running Mac OS, and 67.91% on free operating systems like Linux.Code Style: Most common fonts for Windows, Mac and Linux, full font survey results According to a study of online fonts by the Software Usability and Research Laboratory at Wichita State University, participants preferred Verdana to be the best overall font choice and it was also perceived as being among the most legible fonts.A Comparison of Popular Online Fonts: Which Size and Type is Best? However, Microsoft's font manager Bill Hill wrote that \\"with its large x-height and very generous spacing, it never felt comfortable as an eBook font\\". He noted that Microsoft had commissioned an alternative version of the pre-existing typefaces Berling and Frutiger for its Microsoft Reader e-book product. Despite this, Verdana was initially used as one of the bundled book- reading fonts on the iPad before an update in 2011. Microsoft variants Verdana Ref is a custom version of Verdana for use with Microsoft Reference. It is used in Microsoft Bookshelf 2000, Encarta Encyclopedia Deluxe 99, Encarta Virtual Globe 99, Office 2000 Premium, Publisher 2000. MS Reference Sans Serif is a derivative of Verdana Ref with bold and italic fonts. This font family is included with Microsoft Encarta. Tahoma is similar to Verdana but with tighter letter spacing. The Windows Mobile core font Nina is a more condensed version of Tahoma and Verdana. Verdana Pro Microsoft licensed rights to Verdana to Font Bureau for a new Verdana Pro release, published in 2013. Verdana Pro adds correct German closing quotation marks, light, semi- bold and black styles with italics, as well as condensed styles with italics across all weights. The expanded family was designed for organisations which had made extensive use of Verdana due to its availability but desired additional versions for greater flexibility. It is sold separately through print and web licenses, being sold by Font Bureau and Ascender, although the Windows 10 users can acquire it free of charge from Microsoft Store or by activating the Pan-European Supplemental Fonts optional resource on the Settings app. A similar Georgia Pro release was announced at the same time. Combining characters bug In the past, Verdana (v. 2.43) had an incorrect position for combining diacritical marks, causing them to display on the following character instead of the preceding. This made it unsuitable for Unicode-encoded text such as Cyrillic or Greek. This bug did not usually reveal itself with Latin letters. This is because some font display engines substitute sequences of base character + combining character with a precomposed character glyph. This bug was subsequently fixed in the version issued with Windows Vista. It is also fixed in Verdana version 5.01 font on Windows XP by installing the European Union Expansion Font Update from Microsoft. Awards In 2006, the Verdana typeface was named in the list of British design icons in the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum. Carter's typeface appeared on a list which included Concorde, Mini, Jaguar E-Type, Aston Martin DB5, Supermarine Spitfire, World Wide Web, London tube map, AEC Routemaster bus and the K2 telephone box. Usage In 2009, IKEA changed the typeface used in its catalog from Futura to Verdana, expressing a desire to unify its branding between print and web media. The controversy has been attributed to the perception of Verdana as a symbol of homogeneity in popular typography.\\"Verdanagate,\\" by \\"Armin\\" in \\"Brand New\\" blog, August 31, 2009 Time magazine and the Associated Press ran articles on the controversy including a brief interview with an IKEA representative, focusing on the opinions of typographers and designers.The Font War: Ikea Fans Fume over Verdana. Time, (August 28, 2009) Design and advertising industry-focused publications such as Business Week joined the fray of online posts. The branding critic blog Brand New was one of those using the Verdanagate name. The Australian online daily news site Crikey also published an article on the controversy.Mel Campbell and Jeremy Wortsman, \\"The Full Fonty: Why Type Nerds Went Mental Over Ikea\\", \\"Crikey,\\" September 1, 2009 The Guardian ran an article asking \\"Ikea is changing its font to Verdana‚Äîcausing outrage among typomaniacs. Should the rest of us care? Absolutely.\\"Verdana: Ikea's flat-pack font, Simon Garfield, The Guardian, 2 September 2009. The New York Times said the change to Verdana \\"is so offensive to many because it seems like a slap at the principles of design by a company that has been hailed for its adherence to them.\\"\\"Typography Fans Say Ikea Should Stick to Furniture\\", Edward Rothstein, The New York Times, September 4, 2009. Carter addressed this controversy during an interview in 2013: > Ever since there was that big ruckus about the IKEA catalog changing from > Futura to Verdana, which I had nothing to do with and didn‚Äôt even know > about, people ask me about that everywhere I go.

In 2019, with its logo refresh, IKEA again changed their corporate typeface, from Verdana to a customized version of Noto Sans under the name Noto IKEA and is used in pair with standard versions of Noto Sans.

The small island was developed with facilities for a lighthouse, a military fortification, a military prison, and a federal prison from 1934 until 21 March 1963. The water currents around the island were high at all times, which presumably decreased the chance of an inmate escaping. Beginning in November 1969, the island was occupied for more than 19 months by a group of Native Americans from San Francisco, who were part of a wave of Native American activism across the U.S., with public protests through the 1970s. In 1972, Alcatraz became part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area and received designation as a National Historic Landmark in 1986. Today, the island's facilities are managed by the National Park Service as part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area; it is open to tours. Visitors can reach the island in a little under 15 minutes by ferry ride from Pier 33, located between the San Francisco Ferry Building and Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco. Hornblower Cruises and Events, operating under the name Alcatraz Cruises, is the official ferry provider to and from the island. Alcatraz Island is home to the abandoned prison, the site of the oldest operating lighthouse on the West Coast of the United States, early military fortifications, and natural features such as rock pools and a seabird colony (mostly western gulls, cormorants, and egrets). According to a 1971 documentary on the history of Alcatraz, the island measures by and is at highest point during mean tide. The total area of the island is reported to be . Landmarks on the island include the Main Cellhouse, Dining Hall, Lighthouse, the ruins of the Warden's House and Social Hall, Parade Grounds, Building 64, Water Tower, New Industries Building, Model Industries Building, and the Recreation Yard. History Alcatraz Island, 1895. Alcatraz in the dawn mist, from the east. The \\"parade ground\\" is at left. Alcatraz Island and lighthouse at sunset The water tower and powerhouse (at right), which generated electricity for the island. A model of Military Point Alcatraz, 1866‚Äì1868, now on display at Alcatraz Island The first European to document the island was Spanish naval officer and explorer Juan Manuel de Ayala during Spanish rule of California, who charted San Francisco Bay in 1775. He named one of the three islands \\"La Isla de los Alcatraces\\", which translates as \\"The Island of the Gannets\\" but is commonly believed to translate as \\"The Island of the Pelicans (Spanish for Pelicans is Pel√≠canos)\\", from the archaic Spanish ' (\\"pelican\\"). Over the years, the Spanish version \\"Alcatraz\\" became popular and is now widely used. In August 1827, French Captain Auguste Bernard Duhaut-Cilly wrote \\"... running past Alcatraze's (Pelicans) Island ... covered with a countless number of these birds. A gun fired over the feathered legions caused them to fly up in a great cloud and with a noise like a hurricane.\\" The California brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis californicus) is not known to nest on the island today. The Spanish built several small buildings on the island and other minor structures. =Fort Alcatraz= The earliest recorded private owner of the island of Alcatraz is Julian Workman, to whom it was given by Mexican governor Pio Pico in June 1846, with the understanding that Workman would build a lighthouse on it. Julian Workman is the baptismal name of William Workman, co-owner of Rancho La Puente and personal friend of Pio Pico. Later in 1846, acting in his capacity as Military Governor of California, John C. Fr√©mont, champion of Manifest Destiny and leader of the Bear Flag Republic, bought the island for $5,000 in the name of the United States government from Francis Temple. In 1850, President Millard Fillmore ordered that Alcatraz Island be set aside specifically as a United States military reservation, for military purposes based upon the U.S. acquisition of California from Mexico following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Fr√©mont had expected a large compensation for his initiative in purchasing and securing Alcatraz Island for the U.S. government, but the U.S. government later invalidated the sale and paid Fr√©mont nothing. Fr√©mont and his heirs sued for compensation during protracted but unsuccessful legal battles that extended into the 1890s. The lighthouse tower adjacent to the prison cell house Following the acquisition of California by the United States as a result of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) which ended the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and the onset of the California Gold Rush the following year, the U.S. Army began studying the suitability of Alcatraz Island for the positioning of coastal batteries to protect the approaches to San Francisco Bay. In 1853, under the direction of Zealous B. Tower, the United States Army Corps of Engineers began fortifying the island, work which continued until 1858, when the initial version of Fort Alcatraz was complete. The island's first garrison, numbering about 200 soldiers, arrived at the end of that year. When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, the island mounted 85 cannons (increased to 105 cannons by 1866) in casemates around its perimeter, though the small size of the garrison meant only a fraction of the guns could be used at one time. At this time it also served as the San Francisco Arsenal for storage of firearms to prevent them falling into the hands of Confederate sympathizers. Alcatraz, built as a \\"heavily fortified military site on the West Coast\\", was to form a \\"triangle of defense\\" with Fort Point and Lime Point, but the contemplated work on Lime Point was never built. The first operational lighthouse on the West Coast of the United States was also built on Alcatraz. During the war, Fort Alcatraz was used to imprison Confederate sympathizers and privateers on the west coast, but never fired its guns at an enemy. ‚ÄúBinghamton University archaeologist Timothy de Smet and colleagues located historical remains beneath the former recreation yard of the Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary.‚Äù Using ground-penetrating radar data and georectifications, Smet and colleagues uncovered structures, including ‚Äúa ‚Äúbombproof‚Äù earthwork traverse along with its underlying vaulted brick masonry tunnel and ventilation ducts,‚Äù in surprisingly good condition. Archaeologists also found the remains of ammunition magazines, and tunnels below the penitentiary that was built later. Military prison Because of its isolation from the outside by the cold, strong, tremendous currents of the waters of San Francisco Bay, Alcatraz was used to house soldiers who were guilty of crimes as early as 1859. By 1861, the fort was the military prison for the Department of the Pacific and housed Civil War prisoners of war (POWs) as early as that year. Alcatraz citadel built in the early 1850s; 1908 photo Starting in 1863, the military also held private citizens accused of treason, after the writ of habeas corpus in the United States was suspended. The Civil War era saw rapid changes in artillery and fortification. Alcatraz's defences were obsolete. Modernization efforts, including an ambitious plan to level the entire island and construct shell-proof underground magazines and tunnels, were undertaken between 1870 and 1876 but never completed (the so-called \\"parade ground\\" on the southern tip of the island represents the extent of the flattening effort).Alcatraz Preservation Project: Exposing the Layers of An American Landmark (pamphlet), Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, 2003. Instead, the army switched the focus of its plans for Alcatraz from coastal defense to detention, a task for which it was well suited because of its isolation. In 1867, a brick jailhouse was built (previously inmates had been kept in the basement of the guardhouse), and in 1868, Alcatraz was officially designated a long-term detention facility for military prisoners. The facility was later discontinued for POWs in 1946. Among those incarcerated at Alcatraz were Confederates caught on the West Coast and some Hopi Native American men in the 1870s.\\"The most painful story of resistance to assimilation programs and compulsory school attendance laws involved the Hopis in Arizona, who surrendered a group of men to the military rather than voluntarily relinquish their children. The Hopi men served time in federal prison at Alcatraz\\". In 1898, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War increased the prison population from 26 to over 450, and from 1905 to 1907 it was commanded by U.S. Army General George W. McIver. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, civilian prisoners were transferred to Alcatraz for safe confinement. On March 21, 1907, Alcatraz was officially designated as the Western U.S. Military Prison, later Pacific Branch, U.S. Disciplinary Barracks, 1915. In 1909 construction began on the huge concrete main cell block, designed by Major Reuben Turner, which remains the island's dominant feature. It was completed in 1912. To accommodate the new cell block, the Citadel, a three-story barracks, was demolished down to the first floor, which was actually below ground level. The building had been constructed in an excavated pit creating a defensive dry moat. The first floor was then incorporated as a basement to the new cell block, giving rise to the popular legend of \\"dungeons\\" below the main cell block. The US Disciplinary Barracks was deactivated in October 1933 and transferred to the Bureau of Prisons. During World War I, the prison held conscientious objectors, including Philip Grosser, who wrote a pamphlet entitled Uncle Sam's Devil's Island about his experiences.Grosser, P., Block, H., Blackwell, A. S., & Berkman, A. (1933). Uncle Sam's Devil's Island: Experiences of a Conscientious Objector in America during the World War. Boston =Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary= main cell block from the exercise yard. The United States Disciplinary Barracks on Alcatraz were acquired by the United States Department of Justice on October 12, 1933, and the island became a federal prison in August 1934. Alcatraz was designed to hold prisoners who continuously caused trouble at other federal prisons. At 9:40 am on August 11, 1934, the first batch of 137 prisoners arrived at Alcatraz, arriving by railroad from the United States Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas to Santa Venetia, California, before being escorted to Alcatraz, handcuffed in high security coaches and guarded by 60 special FBI agents, U.S. Marshals and railway security officials. Most of the prisoners were notorious bank robbers and murderers. The prison initially had a staff of 155, including the first warden James A. Johnston and associate warden J. E. Shuttleworth, both considered to be \\"iron men\\". The staff were highly trained in security, but not rehabilitation. Cell 181 in Alcatraz where Al Capone was imprisoned During the 29 years it was in use, the jail held some of the most notorious criminals in American history, such as Al Capone, Robert Franklin Stroud (the \\"Birdman of Alcatraz\\"), George \\"Machine Gun\\" Kelly, Bumpy Johnson, Rafael Cancel Miranda (a member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party who attacked the United States Capitol building in 1954),\\"Former Alcatraz inmate speaks about his time\\", San Francisco Examiner, by D. Morita; October 9, 2009 Mickey Cohen, Arthur R. \\"Doc\\" Barker, and Alvin \\"Creepy\\" Karpis (who served more time at Alcatraz than any other inmate). It also provided housing for the Bureau of Prisons staff and their families. During its 29 years of operation, the penitentiary claimed that no prisoner successfully escaped. A total of 36 prisoners made 14 escape attempts, two men trying twice; 23 were caught alive, six were shot and killed during their escape, two drowned, and five are listed as \\"missing and presumed drowned\\". The most violent occurred on May 2, 1946, when a failed escape attempt by six prisoners led to the Battle of Alcatraz. Perhaps the most famous is the intricate escape carried out on June 11, 1962, by Frank Morris, John Anglin, and Clarence Anglin; the three men are believed to have drowned in their attempt. Contrary to popular belief, it was possible to escape and swim all of the way to shore. Although most men were caught or drowned before reaching shore, in 1962 prisoner John Paul Scott escaped, and made it to the shore. However, upon reaching the shore he was so weary that he was found unconscious by police and in hypothermic shock. To this day, people compete in the Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon and swim the 1.5 miles to shore. Post-prison years =Closing of the prison= There are several reasons that Alcatraz closed as a penitentiary in 1963: The penitentiary cost much more to operate than other prisons (nearly $10 per prisoner per day, as opposed to $3 per prisoner per day at Atlanta); half a century of salt water saturation had severely eroded the buildings; and three people had escaped in 1962. =Native American occupation= 1969‚Äì71 Native American occupation Alcatraz Island was occupied by Native American activists for the first time on March 8, 1964. The protest, proposed by Sioux activist Belva Cottier and joined by about 35 others, lasted four hours and was reported by, among others, the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Francisco Examiner. Beginning on November 20, 1969, a group of Native Americans called United Indians of All Tribes, mostly college students from San Francisco, occupied the island to protest federal policies related to American Indians. Some of them were children of Native Americans who had relocated in the city as part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs' (BIA) Indian termination policy, which was a series of laws and policies aimed at the assimilation of Native Americans into mainstream American society, particularly by encouraging Native Americans to move away from the Indian reservations and into cities. A number of employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs also occupied Alcatraz at that time, including Doris Purdy, an amateur photographer, who later produced footage of her stay on the island. The occupiers, who stayed on the island for nearly two years, demanded the island's facilities be adapted and new structures built for an Indian education center, ecology center and cultural center. The American Indians claimed the island by provisions of the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) between the US and the Sioux; they said the treaty promised to return all retired, abandoned, or out-of-use federal lands to the native peoples from whom they were acquired. Indians of All Tribes then claimed Alcatraz Island by the \\"Right of Discovery\\", as indigenous peoples knew it thousands of years before any Europeans had come to North America. Begun by urban Indians of San Francisco, the occupation attracted other Native Americans from across the country, including American Indian Movement (AIM) urban activists from Minneapolis. The Alcatraz cellhouse, lighthouse, and Warden's House, which was burned out during the 1969‚Äì71 Native American occupation The Native Americans demanded reparation for the many treaties broken by the US government and for the lands that were taken from so many tribes. In discussing the Right of Discovery, the historian Troy R. Johnson states in The Occupation of Alcatraz Island, that indigenous peoples knew about Alcatraz at least 10,000 years before any European knew about any part of North America. During the nineteen months and nine days of occupation by the American Indians, several buildings at Alcatraz were damaged or destroyed by fire, including the lighthouse keeper's home, the warden's home, the Officers' Club, the recreation hall and the Coast Guard quarters. The origin of the fires is disputed. The U.S. government demolished a number of other buildings (mostly apartments) after the occupation had ended. Graffiti from the period of Native American occupation is still visible at many locations on the island.Alcatraz Island , California State University Long Beach During the occupation, President Richard Nixon rescinded the Indian termination policy, designed by earlier administrations to end federal recognition of tribes and their special relationship with the US government. He established a new policy of self- determination, in part as a result of the publicity and awareness created by the occupation. The occupation ended on June 11, 1971.Indians of All Tribes, Alcatraz Is Not an Island, Berkeley, Wingbow Press, 1972 Landmarks Part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area since 1972, the entire Alcatraz Island was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and was further declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986. and In 1993, the National Park Service published a plan entitled Alcatraz Development Concept and Environmental Assessment.https://web.archive.org/web/20061015075505/https://www.nps.gov/archive/goga/admin/planning/alca- eis/doc/chap1.doc This plan, approved in 1980, doubled the amount of Alcatraz accessible to the public to enable visitors to enjoy its scenery and bird, marine, and animal life.Adams, Gerald D., Alcatraz Proposal Highlights Wildlife Plan Would Open Up More of Rock, San Francisco Examiner (July 27, 1993), News section, p.

The Global Peace Foundation proposed to raze the prison and build a peace center in its place. During the previous year, supporters collected 10,350 signatures that placed it on the presidential primary ballots in San Francisco for February 5, 2008. The proposed plan was estimated at $1 billion. For the plan to pass, Congress would have to have taken Alcatraz out of the National Park Service. Critics of the plan said that Alcatraz is too rich in history to be destroyed. On February 6, 2008, the Alcatraz Island Global Peace Center Proposition C failed to pass, with 72% of voters rejecting the proposition. The coastal environment of the San Francisco Bay Area has caused deterioration and corrosion of building materials throughout Alcatraz. Beginning in 2011, the National Park Service began major renovations on the island, including the installation of solar panels on the cell house roof, slope stabilization near the Warden's House and the stabilization and rehabilitation of the outer cell house walls. thumb One of San Francisco's major tourist attractions, Alcatraz drew some 1.7 million visitors annually according to a 2018 report. Visitors arrive by ferry, operated under contract by Alcatraz Cruises LLC at Pier 33. The 2018 report indicated that \\"former prison buildings are being conserved and seismically upgraded and additional areas of the Island are opened to the public as safety hazards are removed\\". Art Alcatraz has been home to several art installations. In 2014, Chinese artist/dissident Ai Weiwei staged an exhibition which explored \\"questions about human rights and freedom of expression\\" called @Large. This exhibit included Lego portraits of famous political prisoners. In 2016, Nelson Saiers used math and prison slang as central elements in a six-month installation that called attention to the imposition of long prison sentences. Fauna and flora =Habitat= Brandt's cormorant nesting on Alcatraz Island * Cisterns. A bluff that, because of its moist crevices, is believed to be an important site for California slender salamanders. * Cliff tops at the island's north end. Containing a onetime manufacturing building and a plaza, the area is listed as important to nesting and roosting birds. * The powerhouse area. A steep embankment where native grassland and creeping wild rye support a habitat for deer mice. * Tide pools. One of the only complexes in the San Francisco Bay, the island's tide pools were created by quarrying activities, and contain a variety of typical invertebrate species. * Western cliffs and cliff tops. Rising to heights of nearly , they provide nesting and roosting sites for seabirds including pigeon guillemots, cormorants, Heermann's gulls, and western gulls. Harbor seals can occasionally be seen on a small beach at the base. * The parade grounds. Carved from the hillside during the late 19th century and covered with rubble since the government demolished guard housing in 1971, the area has become a habitat and breeding ground for black-crowned night herons, western gulls, slender salamanders, and deer mice. * The Agave Path, a trail named for its dense growth of agave. Located atop a shoreline bulkhead on the south side, it provides a nesting habitat for night herons. * Alcatraz prison and its surroundings. =Flora= Flowers on Alcatraz Gardens planted by families of the original Army post, and later by families of the prison guards, fell into neglect after the prison closure in 1963. After 40 years, they are being restored by a paid staff member and many volunteers, thanks to funding by the Garden Conservancy and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy. The untended gardens had become severely overgrown and had developed into a nesting habitat and sanctuary for numerous birds. Now, areas of bird habitat are being preserved and protected, while many of the gardens are being restored to their original state. In clearing out the overgrowth, workers found that many of the original plants were growing where they had been planted ‚Äì some more than 100 years ago. Numerous heirloom rose hybrids, including a Welsh rose (Bardou Job) that had been believed to be extinct, have been discovered and propagated. Many species of roses, succulents, and geraniums are growing among apple and fig trees, banks of sweet peas, manicured gardens of cutting flowers, and wildly overgrown sections of native grasses with blackberry and honeysuckle. In popular culture Alcatraz Island appears often in media and popular culture, including films dating from 1962: The Book of Eli (2010), X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), Catch Me If You Can (2002), The Rock (1996), Murder in the First (1995), Escape from Alcatraz (1979), The Enforcer (1976), Point Blank (1967) , Birdman of Alcatraz (1962) and J. J. Abrams' 2012 television series Alcatraz. It also was featured in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters anime, in the book Al Capone Does My Shirts, in the video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 as a playable level. It is also showcased as a playable racetrack in the 1997 arcade racing video game San Francisco Rush the Rock - Alcatraz Edition. Alcatraz has also been portrayed often as a safe haven or base of operations in many post-apocalyptic movies, such as The Book of Eli. Alcatraz was featured in the video game Call of Duty: Black Ops II in a downloadable zombie survival map called \\"Mob of the Dead\\" in which players could explore the Main Cellhouse, the Boat Dock, and a fictional area called the Catacombs which runs through the island. A segment of Alcatraz' Cellhouse makes a cameo appearance in Call of Duty: Black Ops III in the downloadable zombies survival map \\"Revelations\\". The map was then remastered in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4's zombie mode as \\"Blood of the Dead\\" in which the playable area of the map was expanded to include the Model Industries Building, New Industries Building, and the Warden's House. Alcatraz even appears in The Alchemyst and The Sorceress by author Michael Scott and is depicted as a prison for the immortal Perenelle Flamel. Alcatraz is featured in the episode \\"Bird Mummy of Alcatraz\\" in the children's program, Mummies Alive! and was also featured in a mission in the video game Watch Dogs 2. Alcatraz is also featured as a downloadable map in the video game The Escapists. \\"Escape from Alcatraz\\" and \\"The Rock\\" are both movies that show how inescapable the island is. \\"Escape from Alcatraz\\" is based on the true story of a few inmates trying to flee the island. \\"The Rock,\\" on the other hand, just depicts life in Alcatraz.

The first ice skates were made from leg bones of horse, ox or deer, and were attached to feet with leather straps. These skates required a pole with a sharp metal spike that was used for pushing the skater forward, unlike modern bladed skates. Modern skates come in many different varieties, which are chosen depending on the nature of the requirements needed for the skating activity. They are worn recreationally in ice rinks or on frozen bodies of water across the globe and are used as footwear in many sports, including figure skating, ice hockey, bandy, speed skating and tour skating. History Ice skating in Graz in 1909 Medieval bone skates on display at the Museum of London German ice skates from the 19th century, the boot came separately According to a study done by Federico Formenti, University of Oxford, and Alberto Minetti, University of Milan, Finns were the first to develop ice skates some 5,000 years ago from animal bones.Bone Ice Skates Invented by Ancient Finns, Study Says , nationalgeographic.com This was important for the Finnish populations to save energy in harsh winter conditions when hunting in Finnish Lakeland. The earliest known skate to use a metal blade was found in Fennoscandia and was dated to 200 A.D., and was fitted with a thin strip of copper folded and attached to the underside of a leather shoe. William Fitzstephen, writing in the 12th century, described the use of bone skates in London. The following seems to be an Early Modern English translation of the Latin original: Types of ice skates There are five main types of ice skates: the figure skate, the hockey skate, the bandy skate, the racing skate, and the touring skate. =Figure skates= Figure skate Figure skates are used in the sport of figure skating. As these blades and boot shape differentiate them from other types of skates, they must be taken care of for optimum skating performance. The blades must be relatively sharp as well as cleaned regularly. Unlike hockey skates, they have toe picks on the front of the blade, which are usually made out of stainless steel or aluminium with a steel runner. The toe pick has a variety of uses, but is most commonly used for certain jumps in figure skating, such as the Lutz jump and toe loop, or starting a backspin. Figure skating boots are typically made of several layers of leather and the leather is very stiff to provide ankle support. In addition, the figure skate's blade is curved, allowing for minute adjustments in balance and weight distribution. The base of the figure-skate blade is slightly concave, or \\"hollow ground\\". The hollow, which runs the length of the blade, creates two edges, which come in contact with the ice. The forward part of the blade, the toe-rake, is saw-toothed and is used for jumps and spins on the toes. =Ice hockey skates= Ice hockey skate Hockey skates are used for playing the games of ice hockey and ringette. The boot is generally made of molded plastic, leather (often synthetic), ballistic nylon, or a thermoformed composite material.https://www.bauer.com/en-US/sale-skates/vapor-1x-skate-623598.html Skates used in competitive hockey rarely use molded plastic for the upper boot, as this results in limited mobility. The skates used by goaltenders are cut lower in the anklehttps://www.purehockey.com/c/goalie-skates-vs-hockey- skates than a normal hockey skate and the boot sits closer to the ice for a lower center of gravity. The boot itself is encased in hardened plastic, called a \\"cowling\\", protecting the toe, ankle and heel from the force of the shot puck. The blade is usually longer and has less rocker (curvature to the blade) to make it easier for the goalie to move side to side in the crease. Goalie skates lack a tendon guard. Unlike regular hockey skates, goalie skates are usually protected by a synthetic material covering the toe-part of the skate. This is to prevent damage from the puck. The blade of the goalie skate is not as useful in turning as regular hockey skates, because the blade is rockered less, thus making turns slightly inconvenient. The material used to make the boot of the goalie skate historically was is a harder synthetic material than regular hockey boots. Hockey skate being sharpened Sharpening ice hockey skates plays a key factor in a player‚Äôs ability to skate and players will sharpen their skates hundreds of times throughout their career. Similar to figure skates, the blade is hollow ground in cross section, creating two edges that contact and cut into the ice, allowing increased maneuverability. The blades are sharpened with round-edged grinding wheels that create the two edges. The wheels grind out a hollow semi-circle along the length of the underside of the blade, forming the sharp edge on each side. Skate blade sharpness is measured by the thickness of the round-edged grinding wheel being used, the smaller the radius, the sharper the edge will be. The sharpness chosen by a player is based completely upon preference, not player size or level of play. While a radius of hollow is the most common and standard sharpening for most players, the standard radius of hollow for goalies is . =Bandy skates= Bandy skates are used for playing the game of bandy. The boot is generally made of leather (often synthetic). The boot is lower than the hockey version, often not covering the ankles. All bandy skates are designed such that they will not cause injury to an opponent. The blade is generally an inch longer than the hockey skates, allowing for higher speeds at the large bandy rink.\\"Bandy Skate profile vs Hockey Ice skate\\" (video), 27 December 2016 , retrieved 20 October 2017 The Russian bandy skates have an even longer blade and a very low cut shoe. =Racing skates= Modern \\"Comfort\\" speed skates Racing clap skates Short track speed skates Racing skates, also known as speed skates, have long blades and are used for speed skating. A clap skate (or clapper skate) is a type of skate where the shoe is connected to the blade using a hinge. Short track racing skates have a longer overall height to the blade to allow for deep edge turns without the boot contacting the ice. For better turning ability, racing skates may have a radius, from for short track to for long track. Racing skates have a completely flat bottom. There is no hollow, only a squared off bottom with two edges. This improves glide time, by not cutting into the ice. =Touring skates= Fixed heel binding and \\"duckbill boot\\" Touring skate with Multiskate binding for hiking boots Touring skate for ski boots and free-heel binding on ice Touring skates (or Nordic skates) are long blades that can be attached, via bindings, to hiking or cross-country ski boots and are used for long distance tour skating on natural ice. The blades are approximately long with a radius of curvature (or rocker) of about . The blades are from wide, with a flat cross-section. The length and long radius of the blades makes touring skates more stable on uneven natural ice than skates with shorter, more rockered blades. Since tour skating often involves walking (Kluning) between lakes or around unskateable sections, the fact that the blades can be easily removed from one's boots is an asset. Thus, these skates are often called kluunschaats in the Netherlands. With most modern models of skates, the blades are bonded to the bottom of an aluminum foot-plate. A binding for a specific type of boot is mounted on the top of the foot-plate. Traditionally, the bindings held down both toe and heel of the boot (fixed-heel). Some bindings require special boots like telemark ski boots with a \\"duck-bill\\" shaped toe, others, like the Multiskate, have padded adjustable straps that will attach to most hiking boots. Since the early 1990s, models have been designed for mounting free-heel cross-country ski bindings to the skates, and thus attach matching ski boots to the skates. The free-heel models give the equivalent effect as the klap skate form of speed skates.There are several makers of these skates in Sweden, Netherlands, and Finland. Skaters in a marathon race on Weissensee (Carinthia), using nordic skates Although mainly used for non- competitive touring, nordic skates are sometimes used in marathon speed skating races on natural ice, such as Vikingar√§nnet (The Viking Run), a long distance tour skating event in Sweden  Historical wooden touring skates Before 1970, most touring skates had a wooden foot-plate which was attached to the boot with leather straps. Examples were the Gillbergs skate from Sweden, and the Stheemann \\"wooden Norwegian\\" from the Netherlands. Even earlier, in the years 1870 to 1900, there were very similar models made in North America, like the Donaghue from the U.S. = Recreational skates = Inexpensive skates for recreational skaters usually resemble either figure skates or hockey skates, but recreational ice skates resembling inline skates with a molded plastic boot are also available. These recreational skates are commonly rented from ice rinks by beginners who do not own their own skates. In the non-American English-speaking world, they are sometimes called 'death wellies' by skaters who own their own equipment because of their appearance and their reputation for giving the wearer blisters. People who own their own skates may further reduce the risk of blisters by adding a friction management patch to areas inside the skate that could rub or chafe. =Double runner= Also known as twin blade skates, cheese cutters, bob skates, or bobby skates, these skates are worn by young children who are learning. The double blades increase stability and help the child to balance.

Extending south from the Barri√®re d'Enfer (\\"Gate of Hell\\") former city gate, this ossuary was created as part of the effort to eliminate the city's overflowing cemeteries. Preparation work began not long after a 1774 series of gruesome Saint Innocents-cemetery-quarter basement wall collapses added a sense of urgency to the cemetery-eliminating measure, and from 1786, nightly processions of covered wagons transferred remains from most of Paris' cemeteries to a mine shaft opened near the Rue de la Tombe-Issoire. The ossuary remained largely forgotten until it became a novelty-place for concerts and other private events in the early 19th century; after further renovations and the construction of accesses around Place Denfert-Rochereau, it was open to public visitation from 1874. Since 2013, the Catacombs number among the 14 City of Paris Museums managed by Paris Mus√©es. Although the ossuary comprises only a small section of the underground \\"carri√®res de Paris\\" (\\"quarries of Paris\\"), Parisians currently often refer to the entire tunnel network as the catacombs. History =Paris' cemeteries = Les Innocents cemetery during 1550. Paris' earliest burial grounds were to the southern outskirts of the Roman-era Left Bank city. In ruins after the Western Roman Empire's 5th-century end and the ensuing Frankish invasions, Parisians eventually abandoned this settlement for the marshy Right Bank: from the 4th century, the first known settlement there was on higher ground around a Saint- Etienne church and burial ground (behind the present H√¥tel de Ville), and urban expansion on the Right Bank began in earnest after other ecclesiastical landowners filled in the marshlands from the late 10th century. Thus, instead of burying its dead away from inhabited areas as usual, the Paris Right Bank settlement began with cemeteries near its centre. The most central of these cemeteries, a burial ground around the 5th-century Notre-Dame-des-Bois church, became the property of the Saint-Opportune parish after the original church was demolished by the 9th-century Norman invasions. When it became its own parish associated with the church of the \\"Saints Innocents\\" from 1130, this burial ground, filling the land between the present rue Saint-Denis, rue de la Ferronnerie, rue de la Lingerie and the rue Berger, had become the City's principal cemetery. By the end of the same century \\"Saints Innocents\\" was neighbour to the principal Parisian marketplace Les Halles, and already filled to overflowing. To make room for more burials, the long-dead were exhumed and their bones packed into the roofs and walls of \\"charnier\\" galleries built inside the cemetery walls. By the end of the 18th century, the central burial ground was a two-metre-high () mound of earth filled with centuries of Parisian dead, plus the remains from the H√¥tel-Dieu hospital and the Morgue; other Parisian parishes had their own burial grounds, but the conditions in Les Innocents cemetery were the worst. A series of ineffective decrees limiting the use of the cemetery did little to remedy the situation, and it was not until the late 18th century that it was decided to create three new large-scale suburban burial grounds on the outskirts of the city, and to condemn all existing parish cemeteries within city limits. =The future ossuary: Paris' former mines= Map of former underground mine exploitations in Paris (1908). Much of the Left Bank area rests upon rich Lutetian limestone deposits. This stone built much of the city, but it was extracted in suburban locations away from any habitation. Because of the post 12th-century haphazard mining technique of digging wells down to the deposit and extracting it horizontally along the vein until depletion, many of these (often illicit) mines were uncharted, and when depleted, often abandoned and forgotten. Paris had annexed its suburbs many times over the centuries, and by the 18th century many of its arrondissements (administrative districts) were or included previously mined territories. The undermined state of the Left Bank was known to architects as early 17th-century construction of the Val-de-Gr√¢ce hospital (most of its building expenses were due to its foundations), but a series of mine cave-ins beginning 1774 with the collapse of a house along the \\"rue d'Enfer\\" (near today's crossing of the Avenue Denfert-Rochereau and the boulevard Saint-Michel) caused King Louis XVI to name a commission to investigate the state of the Parisian underground. This resulted in the creation of the inspection G√©n√©rale des Carri√®res (Inspection of Mines) service. =Ossuary creation= The need to eliminate Les Innocents gained urgency from May 31, 1780, when a basement wall in a property adjoining the cemetery collapsed under the weight of the mass grave behind it. The cemetery was closed to the public and all intra muros (Latin: \\"within the [city] walls\\") burials were forbidden after 1780. The problem of what to do with the remains crowding intra muros cemeteries was still unresolved. Mine consolidations were still occurring and the underground around the site of the 1777 collapse ¬´ Par commission du , M. Guillaumot, architecte du Roi, fut nomm√© au poste de contr√¥leur et inspecteur g√©n√©ral en chef des Carri√®res. Signe du destin, une nouvelle maison s'effondra le jour m√™me dans les carri√®res de la rue d'Enfer ! ¬ª Histoire de l'IGC. that had initiated the project had already become a series of stone and masonry inspection passageways that reinforced the streets above. The mine renovation and cemetery closures were both issues within the jurisdiction of the Police Prefect Police Lieutenant-General Alexandre Lenoir, who had been directly involved in the creation of a mine inspection service. Lenoir endorsed the idea of moving Parisian dead to the subterranean passageways that were renovated during 1782. After deciding to further renovate the \\"Tombe-Issoire\\" passageways for their future role as an underground sepulchre, the idea became law during late 1785. A well within a walled property above one of the principal subterranean passageways was dug to receive Les Innocents' unearthed remains, and the property itself was transformed into a sort of museum for all the headstones, sculptures and other artifacts recuperated from the former cemetery. Beginning from an opening ceremony on 7 April the same year, the route between Les Innocents and the \\"clos de la Tombe-Issoire\\" became a nightly procession of black cloth-covered wagons carrying the millions of Parisian dead. It would take two years to empty the majority of Paris's cemeteries. Cemeteries whose remains were moved to the Catacombs include Saints-Innocents (the largest by far with about 2 million buried over 600 years of operation), Saint-√âtienne-des- Gr√®s]https://darkhistoricalsites.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/catacombs-of- paris_1.jpg (one of the oldest), Madeleine Cemetery, Errancis Cemetery (used for the victims of the French Revolution), and Notre-Dame-des-Blancs- Manteaux.http://en.parisinfo.com/what-to-see-in-paris/info/guides/plunge-into- the-heart-of-the-catacombes-de-paris =Renovation and ossuary decor= Wall made of skulls Catacombs in their first years were a disorganized bone repository, but Louis-√âtienne H√©ricart de Thury, director of the Paris Mine Inspection Service from 1810, had renovations done that would transform the caverns into a visitable mausoleum. In addition to directing the stacking of skulls and femurs into the patterns seen in the catacombs today, he used the cemetery decorations he could find (formerly stored on the Tombe-Issoire property, many had disappeared after the 1789 Revolution) to complement the walls of bones. Also created was a room dedicated to the display of the various minerals found under Paris, and another showing various skeletal deformities found during the catacombs' creation and renovation. He also added monumental tablets and archways bearing ominous warning inscriptions, and also added stone tablets bearing descriptions or other comments about the nature of the ossuary, and to ensure the safety of eventual visitors, it was walled from the rest of the Paris's Left Bank already-extensive tunnel network. = Modern = Bodies of the dead from the riots in the Place de Gr√®ve, the H√¥tel de Brienne, and Rue Mesl√©e were put in the catacombs on 28 and 29 August 1788. The tomb of the Val-de-Gr√¢ce hospital doorkeeper Philibert Aspairt, lost in the catacombs during 1793 and found 11 years later, is located in the catacombs on the spot where his body was found. During 1871, communards killed a group of monarchists there. During World War II, Parisian members of the French Resistance used the tunnel system. The Nazis established an underground bunker below Lyc√©e Montaigne, a high school in the 6th arrondissement. During 1974, the film The Holes was set within the Catacombs of Paris. During 1954, the film Father Brown had pivotal scenes set within the Catacombs of Paris. During 2004, police discovered a fully equipped movie theater in one of the caverns. It was equipped with a giant cinema screen, seats for the audience, projection equipment, film reels of recent thrillers and film noir classics, a fully stocked bar, and a complete restaurant with tables and chairs. The group les UX took responsibility for the installation. The film As Above, So Below, released in 2014, was the first production that secured permission from the French government to film in the catacombs. They aimed to use no alterations to the environment with the exception of a piano and a car which were hauled into the catacombs and set on fire. During 2015, Airbnb paid ‚Ç¨350,000 as part of a publicity stunt offering customers the chance to stay overnight in the Catacombs. In August 2017, thieves broke into a cellar from the catacombs and stole more than ‚Ç¨250,000 of wine. Visits Entrance to the Catacombs The Catacombs of Paris became a curiosity for more privileged Parisians from their creation, an early visitor being the Count of Artois (later Charles X of France) during 1787. Public visits began after its renovation into a proper ossuary and the 1814‚Äì1815 war. First allowed only a few times a year with the permission of an authorized mines inspector, but later more frequently and permitted by any mine overseer, a flow of visitors degraded the ossuary to a point where the permission-only rule was restored from 1830, and the catacombs were closed completely from 1833 because of church opposition to exposing human remains to public display. Open again for four visits a year from 1850, public demand caused the government to allow monthly visits from 1867, bi- weekly visits on the first and third Saturday of each month from 1874 (with an extra opening for the November 1 toussaint holiday), and weekly visits during the 1878, 1889 (the most visitors yet that year) and 1900 World's Fair Expositions. Later they opened for regular daily visits. After an incident of vandalism, the Catacombs were closed to the public during September 2009 and reopened on 19 December of the same year. The Catacombs were reopened to the public on June 16, 2020 with new rules and guidelines for visitors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.They have also adopted strict practices to monitor crowd numbers and have made it obligatory to wear masks. Plan of the visitable Catacombes, drawn by the IGC (Inspection G√©n√©rale des Carri√®res) during 1858. Disruption of surface structures Although the catacombs offered space to bury the dead, they presented disadvantages to building structures; because the catacombs are directly under the Paris streets, large foundations cannot be built and cave-ins have destroyed buildings. For this reason, there are few tall buildings in this area.  References  Further reading * Quigley, Christine (2001) Skulls and skeletons: human bone collections and accumulations.

For more than 30 years, he was one of the highest profile individuals of the white nationalist movement. A physicist by profession, he was author of the novels The Turner Diaries and Hunter under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. The former has inspired multiple hate crimes and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Pierce founded the National Alliance, a white nationalist organization, which he led for almost thirty years. Born in Atlanta to a Presbyterian family of Scotch- Irish American and English descent, Pierce was a descendant of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. As a child, Pierce did well academically, graduating from high school in 1952. He received a bachelor's degree in physics from Rice University in 1955, earned a doctorate from University of Colorado at Boulder in 1962, and became an assistant professor of physics at the Oregon State University in that year. In 1965 he left his tenure at Oregon State University and became a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney in Connecticut. In 1966 Pierce moved to the Washington, D.C. area and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party, who was assassinated in 1967. Pierce became co-leader of the National Youth Alliance, which split in 1974, with Pierce founding the National Alliance. Pierce's novel The Turner Diaries (1978) depicts a violent revolution in the United States, followed by world war and the extermination of non-white races. Another novel by Pierce, Hunter (1984) portrays the actions of a lone-wolf white supremacist assassin. In 1985, Pierce relocated the headquarters of the National Alliance to Hillsboro, West Virginia where he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church to receive tax exemption for his organization. Pierce spent the rest of his life in West Virginia hosting a weekly show, American Dissident Voices, publishing the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and overseeing his publications, National Vanguard magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. At the time of Pierce's death in 2002, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members and a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials and was better known than at any time in its history. Subsequently, it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.  Life and career  = Early life and education = Pierce in a high school military academy uniform William Luther Pierce III was born in Atlanta. The son of William Luther Pierce Jr. and Marguerite Farrell, his Presbyterian family was of English and Scotch-Irish descent. Pierce's younger brother, Sanders, an engineer, was born in 1936, and later assisted Pierce in his political activities. His father was born in Christiansburg, Virginia in 1892. His mother was born in Richland, Georgia in 1910, with her family being part of the aristocracy of the Old South, descendants of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America. After the American Civil War, the family lived a working-class existence. Pierce's father once served as a government representative on ocean-going cargo ships and sent reports back to Washington, D.C.; he later became manager of an insurance agency but was killed in a car accident in 1942. After the elder Pierce's death, the family moved to Montgomery, Alabama and after that to Dallas. Pierce performed well in school, skipping one grade. His last two years in high school were spent at the Allen Military Academy in Bryan, Texas. As a teenager his hobbies and interests were model rockets, chemistry, radios, electronics, and reading science fiction. After finishing military school in 1951, Pierce worked briefly in an oil field as a roustabout. He was injured when a four-inch (10 cm) pipe fell on his hand, and he spent the rest of that summer working as a shoe salesman. Pierce earned a scholarship to attend Rice University in Houston. He graduated from Rice in 1955 with a bachelor's degree in physics. He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before attending graduate school, initially at Caltech during 1955‚Äì56. At the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, he earned a master's degree and a doctorate in 1962. He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965. = Early political activities = His tenure as assistant professor at Oregon State University coincided with the rise of the Civil Rights Movement and later the counterculture. The former, along with the protests against the Vietnam war he regarded as being Jewish-led. In 1965 to finance his political ambitions, Pierce left his tenure at Oregon State University and relocated to North Haven, Connecticut to work as a senior researcher at the Advanced Materials Research and Development Laboratory of aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney. After a brief membership of the anti-communist John Birch Society in 1962, he resigned because the Society was uninvolved in race issues or Jews. After he moved to Washington, D.C. he became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party. During this time he was the editor of the party's quarterly ideological journal, National Socialist World. When Rockwell was murdered in 1967, Pierce became one of the leading members of the National Socialist White People's Party, the successor to the ANP. In 1968, Pierce left the NSWPP and joined Youth for Wallace, an organization supporting the bid for the presidency of George Wallace, the former Governor of Alabama. In 1970, along with Willis Carto he reconfigured Youth for Wallace into the National Youth Alliance. However, a complex dispute between the two men had begun by the late 1960s. By 1971, Pierce and Carto were openly feuding with the latter accusing the former of the theft of the Liberty Lobby mailing list. These issues caused the NYA to split, and by 1974 Pierce's wing became known as the National Alliance. Among the founding members of the board of the National Alliance was a University of Illinois professor of classics, Revilo P. Oliver, who was to have major impact of Pierce's life both as an adviser and friend. = National Alliance = The National Alliance was organized in 1974. Pierce intended the organization to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist overthrow of the United States Federal Government. Pierce spent the rest of his life living in West Virginia. From this location, he hosted a weekly radio show, American Dissident Voices from 1991, the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and oversaw his publications, National Vanguard magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. (many of which promoted Holocaust denial) and the \\"white power\\" record company, Resistance Records, which Pierce supported from its inception around 1993 and purchased outright in 1999. On the topic of the Holocaust, he believed that the number of deaths has been exaggerated, and that many of the details had been fabricated.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Gf6A1x2LM In 1978, claiming that the National Alliance was an educational organization, Pierce applied for and was denied, tax exemption by the Internal Revenue Service. Pierce appealed, but an appellate court upheld the IRS decision. Around the same time, he was interviewed by Herbert Poinsett on Race and Reason, a public-access television cable TV talk show. Accessed on YouTube. An anti-zionist, he attempted during the Yom Kippur War to force McDonnell Douglas into canceling military contracts that sent armaments to Israel by buying shares of the company's stock and putting forward the motion at the national shareholder's meeting. The company rejected the motion and continued supplying Israel with weapons. Some of Pierce's later speeches on American Dissident Voices concerning the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict were reprinted in Muslim publications and on websites, including that of the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah. In 1985, Pierce moved his operations from Arlington, Virginia, to a location in Mill Point, West Virginia, that he paid for with $95,000 in cash. At this location, he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church. In 1986, the church applied again, this time successfully, for federal, state, and local tax exemptions, however lost its state tax exemption for all but 60 out of nearly 400 acres which had to be exclusively used for religious purposes. The other were used for both the National Alliance headquarters and the National Vanguard Books business and warehouse, and were denied tax exemption. In 1990, the documentary series Different Drummer produced a portrait of Pierce, which was aired on PBS. Accessed on YouTube. He later participated twice on a public-access television cable TV live talk show hosted by Ron Doggett, Race and Reality and aired from Richmond, Virginia. Accessed on Vimeo. Accessed on Vimeo. Pierce was frequently described as a neo-Nazi, although he personally rejected this label. When confronted with the issue by Mike Wallace on 60 minutes, Pierce described the term as a slander: :I admire many things that Hitler wrote, many of the programs and policies that he instituted in Germany, but we do not blindly copy anyone else's policies or programs. We've formulated our own program in view of the situation that we face here in America today. In 1998, Pierce was a contributor to a documentary produced by the Discovery Channel about white nationalism in the United States. Accessed on YouTube. As the leader of the National Alliance, Pierce established contacts with other nationalist groups in Europe, including the National Democratic Party of Germany and the Greek Golden Dawn party. Pierce's other recruiting efforts included a 51-minute informational video titled America is a Changing Country, Accessed on Vimeo. and forming an anti-globalization group ‚Äì the Anti- Globalization Action Network ‚Äì to protest at the G8 summit in Canada in June 2002. Pierce's last public speech was made in Cleveland, Ohio on April 28, 2002. Accessed on YouTube. On July 23, 2002, he died of renal failure, three weeks after being diagnosed with cancer which had spread through his body. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members, a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.  Novels  = The Turner Diaries = Pierce gained attention following the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing as the individual responsible, Timothy McVeigh was influenced by The Turner Diaries (1978), the novel written by Pierce under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. The book is a graphically violent depiction of a future race war in the United States, which includes a detailed description of the \\"Day of the Rope\\" mass hangings of many \\"race traitors\\" (especially Jews, gay people, and those in interracial marriages or relationships) in the public streets of Los Angeles, followed by the systematic ethnic cleansing of the city, and eventually the entire world. This violence and killing is called \\"terrible yet absolutely necessary\\". The story is told through the perspective of Earl Turner, an active member of the white revolutionary underground resistance, called The Organization, led by the secret inner circle known as The Order (a reorganized SS). The part most relevant to the McVeigh case is in an early chapter, when the book's main character is placed in charge of bombing the FBI headquarters. Some have pointed out similarities between the bombing in the book and the actual bombing in Oklahoma City that damaged the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and killed 168 people on April 19, 1995. When McVeigh was arrested later that day, pages from the book were found in his car, with several phrases highlighted, including \\"But the real value of all of our attacks today lies in the psychological impact, not in the immediate casualties\\" and \\"We can still find them and kill them.\\" The Turner Diaries also inspired a group of white revolutionary nationalists in the early 1980s who called themselves the Silent Brotherhood, or sometimes simply The Order. The Order was an offshoot of the Aryan Nations. They were tired of being merely \\"armchair revolutionaries\\". The Order was connected to numerous crimes, including counterfeiting and bank robbery, and supposedly gave money to the Alliance. The Order's leader, Robert Jay Mathews, died in a stand-off with police and federal agents on Whidbey Island, Washington when police fired flares into his hideout, igniting a fire. Other Order members including David Lane were captured and sent to federal prisons. In 1996 Pierce sold the rights to The Turner Diaries to the Jewish publisher Lyle Stuart.Lyle Stuart, Publisher of Renegade Titles, Dies at 83 On May 19, 1996, Pierce was interviewed on 60 Minutes, Accessed on YouTube. during which Pierce was asked by Mike Wallace if he approved of the Oklahoma City bombing, and he replied \\"No. No, I don't. I've said that over and over again, that I do not approve of the Oklahoma City bombing because the United States is not yet in a revolutionary situation.\\" A year earlier in a telephone interview with The Washington Post, he was quoted as saying: \\"the Oklahoma City bombing didn't make sense politically. Terrorism only makes sense if it can be sustained over a period of time. One day there will be real, organized terrorism done according to plan, aimed at bringing down the government.\\" = Hunter = In 1989, again under the Andrew Macdonald pen name, Pierce published another novel, Hunter, which tells the story of a man named Oscar Yeager, a veteran of the Vietnam War who begins by killing multiple interracial couples. He then assassinates liberal journalists, politicians and bureaucrats in the D.C. area. In interviews, Pierce called Hunter more realistic, and described his rationale for writing it as taking the reader through \\"an educational process\\".Gardell, Mattias. (2003) Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism, Duke University Press. p.360.  Religion  In the 1970s, Pierce created the religious philosophy of cosmotheism, based on a mixture of German romanticism, the Darwinian concept of natural selection, and Pierce's interpretation of George Bernard Shaw's play, Man and Superman. The Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center assert that Pierce created cosmotheism in order to acquire tax-exempt status for the National Alliance after he had failed to do so earlier, and the SPLC refers to it as a \\"bogus religion\\".  Personal life  Pierce at a 1999 National Alliance meeting in Hillsboro, West Virginia Pierce was married five times. His first marriage was to Patricia Jones, a mathematician whom he met while attending the California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957 and had twin sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1960. Kelvin was an aerospace engineer, while Erik is a computer scientist. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982. The same year, Pierce married Elizabeth Prostel whom he met in the National Alliance office in Arlington. The marriage ended in 1985 and Pierce moved his headquarters to southern West Virginia. In 1986, Pierce married a Hungarian, Olga Skerlecz. She is a relative of Iv√°n Skerlecz, Governor of Croatia-Slavonia; the marriage lasted until 1990. Olga moved to California after their divorce. Pierce then married another Hungarian woman named Zsuzsannah in early 1991. They met through an advertisement that Pierce placed in a Hungarian women's magazine aimed at arranging international marriages. Leaving him in the summer of 1996, Zsuzsannah moved to Florida. His last marriage in 1997, which ended with his death was to another Hungarian woman, Irena.  Death  Pierce died from kidney failure at his Hillsboro, West Virginia base on July 23, 2002.

Scarver used a 20-inch (51 cm) metal bar, which he had removed from a piece of exercise equipment in the prison weight room, to beat Dahmer and Anderson. Both Dahmer and Anderson later died from their injuries. Scarver was sentenced to two further life sentences for the killings. Early life Scarver is the second of five children and was born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He attended James Madison High School before dropping out in the eleventh grade. Eventually, his mother forced him to leave the house because of his increasing alcoholism. Scarver was hired as a trainee carpenter at a Wisconsin Conservation Corps job program. He said that he had been promised by Edward Patts, a supervisor, that upon completion of this program he would be hired full-time, but Patts was dismissed, and as a result, Scarver's full-time position never materialized. Murder conviction On June 1, 1990, Scarver went to the Wisconsin Conservation Corps training program office and found Steve Lohman, the supervisor who had replaced Edward Patts. Scarver demanded money from Lohman: upon receiving only $15 from Lohman, Scarver shot him in the head. At the same time, he demanded money from site manager John Feyen. According to authorities, Scarver said, \\"Do you think I'm kidding? I need more money.\\" Scarver shot Lohman twice more before Feyen gave a $3,000 check to Scarver and ran away. Scarver was convicted and sentenced to life in prison and sent to the Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, Wisconsin, in 1992. Murders in prison On the morning of November 28, 1994, Scarver was assigned to a work detail with two other inmates, Jesse Anderson and Jeffrey Dahmer; the detail included him cleaning the prison gymnasium toilet. When corrections officers left the three unsupervised, Scarver beat the other two men with a metal bar that he had removed from a piece of exercise equipment in the prison weight room. When he returned to his cell early, an officer asked him why he was not still working. During that time two officers found Dahmer and Anderson. Dahmer was declared dead an hour after arriving at the hospital; Anderson died two days later. After being found competent to stand trial, Scarver received two more life sentences for these murders. In 2005, Scarver brought a federal civil rights suit against officials of the Wisconsin Secure Program Facility in which he argued that he had been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment, contrary to his constitutional rights. Scarver stated that he spent 16 years in solitary confinement as a result of the Dahmer killing. A district court judge dismissed the suit against several of the defendants and ruled that the actions of the remaining officials could not be considered unlawful. Scarver unsuccessfully appealed the decision in 2006. Later, federal district court judge Barbara Crabb ordered that Scarver and about three dozen other seriously mentally ill inmates be relocated from the Wisconsin facility. Scarver was eventually relocated to the Centennial Correctional Facility in Colorado. In 2012, an agent representing Scarver announced that Scarver was willing to write a tell-all book about the killing of Dahmer. In 2015, Jamie Schram of the New York Post reported that Scarver had believed that Dahmer was unrepentant for his crimes. Schram reported that Dahmer would taunt fellow inmates by shaping his prison food into severed limbs and drizzling packets of ketchup on them to simulate blood. It also reported that, although Scarver had not interacted with Dahmer before killing him, he knew that Dahmer was very unpopular with fellow inmates and had seen him get into several altercations with other prisoners. Scarver was reported to have said that he was revolted by Dahmer's crimes and that he carried a news article in his pocket detailing the crimes. Immediately before murdering Dahmer, Scarver allegedly presented the newspaper clipping to him and asked him whether it was true. Scarver was reported to have said that prison staff left him alone with Dahmer because they wanted Dahmer dead and they knew that Scarver hated him. In a 2015 blog post, Scarver disputed some of these statements. References External links *Court TV's Crime Library *The Child Left Behind, The Words and Poetry of Christopher J.

He is best remembered for his theories of atmospheric electric currents that elucidated the nature of the aurora borealis. In order to fund his research on the aurorae, he invented the electromagnetic cannon and the Birkeland‚ÄìEyde process of fixing nitrogen from the air. Birkeland was nominated for the Nobel Prize seven times. Life and death Birkeland was born in Christiania (Oslo today) to Reinart Birkeland and Ingeborg (n√©e Ege) and wrote his first scientific paper at the age of 18. Birkeland married Ida Charlotte Hammer in May 1905. They had no children and, due to Birkeland's preoccupation with his work, they divorced in 1911. Suffering from severe paranoia due to his use of Veronal as a sleeping aid, he died under mysterious circumstances in his room in the Hotel Seiyoken in Tokyo while visiting colleagues at the University of Tokyo. A post-mortem revealed that Birkeland had taken 10 g of veronal the night he died, instead of the 0.5 g recommended. The time of death was estimated at 7am on 15 June 1917. Some authors have claimed that he committed suicide. \\"On the nightstand lay a revolver\\". Research Kristian Birkeland Birkeland organized several expeditions to Norway's high-latitude regions where he established a network of observatories under the auroral regions to collect magnetic field data. The results of the Norwegian Polar Expedition conducted from 1899 to 1900 contained the first determination of the global pattern of electric currents in the polar region from ground magnetic field measurements. The discovery of X-rays inspired Birkeland to develop vacuum chambers to study the influence of magnets on cathode rays. Birkeland noticed that an electron beam directed toward a magnetised terrella was guided toward the magnetic poles and produced rings of light around the poles and concluded that the aurora could be produced in a similar way. He developed a theory in which energetic electrons were ejected from sunspots on the solar surface, directed to the Earth, and guided to the Earth's polar regions by the geomagnetic field where they produced the visible aurora. This is essentially the theory of the aurora today. Birkeland proposed in 1908 in his book The Norwegian Aurora Polaris Expedition 1902‚Äì1903 out-of- print, full text online that polar electric currents, today referred to as auroral electrojets, were connected to a system of currents that flowed along geomagnetic field lines into and away from the polar region. Such field- aligned currents are known today as Birkeland currents in his honour. He provided a diagram of field-aligned currents in the book, and this diagram was reproduced on the back of the Norwegian 200 kroner 7th series banknote in the lower right corner, and his terrella experiment is shown on the front at the left with a portrait of Birkeland on the right. The book on the 1902‚Äì1903 expedition contains chapters on magnetic storms on the Earth and their relationship to the Sun, the origin of the Sun itself, Halley's comet, and the rings of Saturn. Birkeland's vision of what are now known as Birkeland currents became the source of a controversy that continued for over half a century, because their existence could not be confirmed from ground-based measurements alone. His theory was disputed and ridiculed at the time as a fringe theory by mainstream scientists, most notoriously by the eminent British geophysicist and mathematician Sydney Chapman who argued the mainstream view that currents could not cross the vacuum of space and therefore the currents had to be generated by the Earth. Birkeland's theory of the aurora continued to be dismissed by mainstream astrophysicists after his death in 1917. It was notably championed by the Swedish plasma scientist Hannes Alfv√©n,Alfv√©n, Hannes (1939), \\"Theory of Magnetic Storms and of the Aurorae\\", K. Sven. Vetenskapsakad. Handl., ser. 3, vol. 18, no. 3, p. 1, 1939. Reprinted in part, with comments by A. J. Dessler and J. Wilcox, in Eos, Trans. Am. Geophys. Un., vol. 51, p. 180, 1970. but Alfv√©n's work in turn was also disputed by Chapman.Chapman, S. and Bartels, J. (1940) Geomagnetism, Vols. 1 and 2, Clarendon Press, Oxford. Proof of Birkeland's theory of the aurora only came in 1967 after a probe was sent into space. The crucial results were obtained from U.S. Navy satellite 1963-38C, launched in 1963 and carrying a magnetometer above the ionosphere. Magnetic disturbances were observed on nearly every pass over the high-latitude regions of the Earth. These were originally interpreted as hydromagnetic waves, but on later analysis it was realized that they were due to field-aligned or Birkeland currents. The scale of Birkeland's research enterprises was such that funding became an overwhelming obstacle. Recognizing that technological invention could bring wealth, he developed an electromagnetic cannon and, with some investors, formed a firearms company. The coil-gun worked, except the high muzzle velocities he predicted (600 m/s) were not produced. The most he could get from his largest machine was 100 m/s, corresponding to a disappointing projectile range of only 1 km. So he renamed the device an aerial torpedo and arranged a demonstration with the express aim of selling the company. At the demonstration, one of the coils shorted and produced a sensational inductive arc complete with noise, flame, and smoke. This was the first failure of any of the launchers that Birkeland had built. It could easily have been repaired and another demonstration organized. However, fate intervened in the form of an engineer named Sam Eyde. At a dinner party only one week later, Eyde told Birkeland that there was an industrial need for the biggest flash of lightning that can be brought down to Earth in order to make artificial fertilizer. Birkeland's reply was, \\"I have it!\\" There were no more attempts to sell the firearms company, and he worked with Eyde only long enough to build a plasma arc device for the nitrogen fixation process. The pair worked to develop the prototype furnace into a design that was economically viable for large-scale manufacture. The resulting company, Norsk Hydro, hugely enriched Norway, and Birkeland then enjoyed adequate funding for research, his only real interest. The Birkeland‚ÄìEyde process is relatively inefficient in terms of energy consumption. Therefore, in the 1910s and 1920s, it was gradually replaced in Norway by a combination of the Haber process and the Ostwald process. In 1913, Birkeland may have been the first to predict that plasma was ubiquitous in space. He wrote: \\"It seems to be a natural consequence of our points of view to assume that the whole of space is filled with electrons and flying electric ions of all kinds. We have assumed that each stellar system in evolutions throws off electric corpuscles into space. It does not seem unreasonable therefore to think that the greater part of the material masses in the universe is found, not in the solar systems or nebulae, but in 'empty' space.\\" In 1916, Birkeland was probably the first person to successfully predict that the solar wind behaves as do all charged particles in an electric field: \\"From a physical point of view it is most probable that solar rays are neither exclusively negative nor positive rays, but of both kinds\\". In other words, the Solar Wind consists of both negative electrons and positive ions. Kristian Birkeland and his terrella experiment The first complete map of the statistical location of Birkeland currents in the Earth's polar region was developed in 1974 by A.J. Zmuda and J.C. Armstrong and refined in 1976 by T. Iijima and T.A. Potemra As a scholar with wide interests, Birkeland joined the control commission of NSFPS (= Norwegian Society For Psychic Research). The 299 members of the society included, by 1922, people like prime minister Gunnar Knudsen, as well as a wide range of doctors, professors and shipowners. The society arranged circles experimenting with dancing tables and automatic writing, but attracted more attention arranging controlled experiments with invited foreign mediums. In 1912 it was the alleged medium Etta Wriedt from Detroit, famous for her \\"spirit trumpet\\", who was exposed as a fraud. Mrs Wriedt's \\"trumpet\\" should have been speaking with the \\"spirit voice\\" of, among others, Hypatia,King, John S. (1920) Dawn of the Awakened Mind. New York, The James A. McCann Company but in Norway the \\"trumpet blows\\" were exposed as explosions produced by potassium and water. Professor Birkeland exclaimed on that occasion, \\"I'm supposedly against all witch burnings, but a teeny weeny one in honour of Mrs Wriedt would not have been in the way.\\" Emberland, Terje and Pettersen, Arnfinn (2006) \\"Religion for en ny tid\\", pp. 257‚Äì8 in √Öpent sinn eller h√∏l i hue?, Humanist, Oslo, Legacy Birkeland's theory of the aurora was eventually confirmed and accepted as correct. An example of one of his experiments is depicted on the left front of a previous version of the Norwegian 200 kroner note; it shows a magnetized terrella, simulating the Earth, suspended in an evacuated chamber. Birkeland's face appears a second time in a watermark in the blank space above the drawing of the Terrella, and his rudimentary magnetosphere appears on the back, but is only visible under ultraviolet light. The ring encircling the magnetic pole depicted on the back of the bank note is similar to the patterns predicted by Birkeland and shown more recently by satellites.

Hairlessness in cats is a naturally occurring genetic mutation; however, the Sphynx cat, as a breed, was developed through selective breeding, starting in the 1960s. The skin should have the texture of chamois leather, as it has fine hairs, or the cat may be completely hairless. Whiskers may be present, either whole or broken, or may be totally absent. The cats have a narrow, long head, and webbed feet. Their skin is the color that their fur would be, and all the usual cat markings (solid, point, van, tabby, tortie, etc.) may be found on the Sphynx cat's skin. Because they have no fur they lose more body heat than coated cats; this makes them warm to the touch, and prone to finding warm places. Breed standards These breed standards are defined by The International Cat Association (TICA): * Wedge-shaped heads with prominent cheekbones * Large, lemon-shaped eyes * Very large ears with no hair on inside, but soft down on outside base * Well-muscled, powerful neck of medium length * Medium length torso, barrel-chested, and full, round abdomen, sometimes called a pot belly * Paw pads thicker than other cats, giving the appearance of walking on cushions * Whiplike, tapering tail from body to tip, (sometimes with fur all over tail or a puff of fur on the tip, like a lion) * Muscular body Behavior A male purebred Sphynx in the \\"mink\\" pattern. Like a pointed cat, the mink pattern also exhibits darker points: the ears, tips of tail, feet and nose. However, whereas the pointed pattern is entirely colorless everywhere else on the body, the mink coloration has some color throughout the body and just slightly darker points in adulthood. The mink pattern can be combined with any color. Sphynx are known for their extroverted behavior. They display a high level of energy, intelligence, curiosity, and affection for their owners. They are one of the more dog-like breeds of cats, frequently greeting their owners at the door and friendly when meeting strangers. History of the cat breed The contemporary breed of Sphynx cat, also known as the Canadian Sphynx, is distinct from the Russian hairless cat breeds, like Peterbald and Donskoy. Although hairless cats have been reported throughout history, breeders in Europe have been developing the Sphynx breed since the early 1960s. Two different sets of hairless felines discovered in North America in the 1970s provided the foundation cats for what was shaped into the existing Sphynx breed. The current American and European Sphynx breed is descended from two lines of natural mutations: * Dermis and Epidermis (1975) barn cats from the Pearson family of Wadena, Minnesota * Bambi, Punkie, and Paloma (1978) stray cats found in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and raised by Shirley Smith = Toronto = The Canadian Sphynx breed was started in 1966 in Toronto when a hairless kitten named Prune was born to a black and white domestic shorthair queen (Elizabeth). The kitten was mated with its mother (something called backcrossing), which produced one more naked kitten. Together with a few naked kittens found later, the cat Prune marked the first attempt to create a hairless breed. After purchasing these cats in 1966 and initially referring to them as \\"Moonstones\\" and \\"Canadian Hairless,\\" Ridyadh Bawa, a science graduate of the University of Toronto, combined efforts with his mother Yania, a longtime Siamese breeder, and Keese and Rita Tenhoves to develop a breed of cats which was subsequently renamed as Sphynx. The Bawas and the Tenhoves were the first individuals able to determine the autosomal recessive nature of the Sphynx gene for hairlessness while also being successful in transforming this knowledge into a successful breeding program with kittens which were eventually capable of reproducing. The Tenhoves were initially able to get the new breed provisional showing status through the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) but ultimately had the status revoked in 1971, when it was felt by the CFA Board that the breed had concerns over fertility. The first breeders had rather vague ideas about Sphynx genetics and faced a number of problems. The genetic pool was very limited and many kittens died. There was also a problem with many of the females suffering convulsions. In 1978, cat breeder Shirley Smith found three hairless kittens on the streets of her neighborhood. In 1983 she sent two of them to Dr. Hugo Hernandez in the Netherlands to breed the two kittens, named Punkie and Paloma, to a white Devon Rex named Curare van Jetrophin. The resulting litter produced five kittens: two males from this litter (Q. Ramses and Q. Ra) were used, along with Punkie's half-sister, Paloma. = Minnesota = The first noted naturally occurring foundation Sphynx originated as hairless stray barn cats in Wadena, Minnesota, at the farm of Milt and Ethelyn Pearson. The Pearsons identified hairless kittens occurring in several litters of their domestic shorthair barn cats in the mid-1970s. Two hairless female kittens born in 1975 and 1976, Epidermis and Dermis, were sold to Oregon breeder Kim Mueske, and became an important part of the Sphynx breeding program. Also working with the Pearson line of cats was breeder Georgiana Gattenby of Brainerd, Minnesota, who outcrossed with Cornish Rex cats. Genetics and breeding Two-week-old Sphynx kitten alt= Other hairless breeds might have body shapes or temperaments that differ from those described above. There are, for example, new hairless breeds, including the Don Sphynx and the Peterbald from Russia, which arose from their own spontaneous gene mutations. The standard for the Sphynx differs between cat associations such as The International Cat Association (TICA), F√©d√©ration Internationale F√©line (FIFE) and Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA). = Breeding = In 2010, DNA analysis confirmed that Sphynx hairlessness was produced by a different allele of the same gene that produces the short curly hair of the Devon Rex (termed the \\"re\\" allele), with the Sphynx's allele being incompletely dominant over the Devon allele and both being recessive to the wild type. The Sphynx's allele is termed \\"hr\\", for hairless. The only allowable outcross breeds in the CFA are now the American Shorthair and Domestic Shorthair. Other associations may vary, and the Russian Blue is a permitted outcross in the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). In Europe, mainly the Devon Rex has been used for outcrosses. = Genetics = The Sphynx's hairlessness is produced by a mutation in the same gene that produces the short curly coat of the Devon Rex. Moreover, it was found that the curly coat of Selkirk Rex cats is also associated with this gene. The gene encodes keratin 71 (KRT71) and is responsible for the keratinization of the hair follicle. The Sphynx's mutation leads to a complete loss of function where the structure of the hair is damaged so that i.e. the hair can be formed but is easily dislodged. In the Devon Rex mutation, a residual activity of the protein still exists. The Selkirk Rex allele (sadr) is dominant over the wild type gene, which is dominant over the Devon Rex allele (re) and the Sphynx (hr), which forms an allelic series of : KRT71SADRE > KRT71+ > KRT71re > KRT71hr. Care alt=Two Sphynx females sleeping, black and white colors A Sphynx cat wearing commercially available clothes Though Sphynx cats lack a coat to shed or groom, they are not maintenance-free. Body oils, which would normally be absorbed by the hair, tend to build up on the skin. As a result, regular bathing is usually necessary weekly or bi-weekly. Care should be taken to limit the Sphynx cat's exposure to outdoor sunlight at length, as they can develop sunburn and skin damage similar to that of humans. In general, Sphynx cats should never be allowed outdoors unattended, as they have limited means to conserve body heat when it is cold. In some climates, owners provide coats or other clothing in the winter to help them conserve body heat. While they lack much of the fur of other cat breeds, Sphynxes are not necessarily hypoallergenic. Allergies to cats are triggered by a protein called Fel d1, not cat hair itself. Fel d1 is a protein primarily found in cat saliva and sebaceous glands. Those with cat allergies may react worse to direct contact with Sphynx cats than other breeds; even though reports exist that some people with allergies successfully tolerate Sphynx cats, they are fewer than those who have allergic reactions, according to David Rosenstreich, MD, the director of the Division of Allergy and Immunology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, New York City, New York. These positive reports may be cases of desensitizing, wherein the \\"hairless\\" cat gave the owner optimism to try to own a cat, eventually leading to the positive situation of their own adaptation. Sphynx cats can also have more ear wax than most hairy domestic cats because they have little to no hair in their ears. Dirt, skin oils (sebum), and ear wax accumulates in the ears, and needs to be cleaned out on a weekly basis, usually before bath time. The Sphynx breed also tends to accumulate oils and debris under their nails as well as the skin fold above the nail due to the lack of fur, so, like the ears, the nails and surrounding skin folds need to be cleaned properly as well. Due to these factors the breed may require more grooming than a typical domestic cat with fur. Specialty products for this cat have been developed, though they still require more grooming than most breeds. Health issues The Canadian Sphynx face challenges because of their lack of protective fur, skin cancer may be a problem if exposed to sunlight for long durations of time. The lack of hair can cause health issues with kittens in the first weeks of life because of susceptibility to respiratory infections. Reputable breeders should not let their kittens go to new homes without being at least 14 weeks of age to ensure the kitten is mature enough to cope in a new environment. = Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy = The breed does have instances of the genetic disorder hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Other domestic cat breeds prone to HCM include Persian , Ragdoll, Norwegian Forest cat, Siberian cats, British Shorthair, and Maine Coon; however, any domestic cat including mixed breeds can acquire HCM. Studies are being undertaken to understand the links in breeding and the disorder. Cats are screened for HCM disease with echocardiography (ultrasound of the heart), as well as with additional tests determined by the veterinarian cardiologist including electrocardiogram (EKG, ECG), chest radiographs (X-rays), and/or blood tests. The Sphynx cat has a high rate of heart disease, either as HCM or mitral valve dysplasia. In a 2012 study of 114 Sphynx cats, 34% were found to have an abnormal heart, with 16 cats having mitral valve dysplasia and 23 cats having HCM. These prevalences were found in cats with an average age of 2.62 years. Males cats developed more severe disease than female cats and often developed it earlier, average age of 19 months for males versus 29 months for females. Since the prevalence of genetic heart disease is high in this breed, many breeders will recommend screening for HCM yearly. As HCM progresses into an advanced stage, cats may experience congestive heart failure (CHF) or thromboembolism. = Congenital myasthenic syndrome = Congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) (previously referred to as muscular dystrophy, myopathy or spasticity) is a type of inherited neuromuscular disorder associated with alpha-dystroglycan deficiency, found in Sphynx and in Devon Rex cats as well as variants of these breeds. This condition has also been described, but is rarely seen. Cats affected by CMS show generalized muscle weakness and fatigue, as well as ventroflexion of the head and neck, head bobbing, and scapulae protrusion.

These orders include the Order of Friars Minor, the Order of Saint Clare, and the Third Order of Saint Francis. They adhere to the teachings and spiritual disciplines of the founder and of his main associates and followers, such as Clare of Assisi, Anthony of Padua, and Elizabeth of Hungary. Francis began preaching around 1207 and traveled to Rome to seek approval from Pope Innocent III in 1209 to form a new religious order. The original Rule of Saint Francis approved by the Pope did not allow ownership of property, requiring members of the order to beg for food while preaching. The austerity was meant to emulate the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. Franciscans traveled and preached in the streets, while staying in church properties. Saint Clare, under Francis's guidance, founded the Poor Clares (Order of Saint Clare) in 1212, which remains a Second Order of the Franciscans. The extreme poverty required of members was relaxed in the final revision of the Rule in 1223. The degree of observance required of members remained a major source of conflict within the order, resulting in numerous secessions. The Order of Friars Minor, previously known as the \\"Observant\\" branch, is one of the three Franciscan First Orders within the Catholic Church, the others being the \\"Conventuals\\" (formed 1517) and \\"Capuchins\\" (1520). The Order of Friars Minor, in its current form, is the result of an amalgamation of several smaller orders completed in 1897 by Pope Leo XIII. The latter two, the Capuchin and Conventual, remain distinct religious institutes within the Catholic Church, observing the Rule of Saint Francis with different emphases. Conventual Franciscans are sometimes referred to as minorites or greyfriars because of their habit. In Poland and Lithuania they are known as Bernardines, after Bernardino of Siena, although the term elsewhere refers to Cistercians instead. The Lutheran and Anglican traditions have Protestant Franciscan religious orders in their Churches also. Name and demographics , the rule confirmed by Pope Honorius III The name of the original order, (Friars Minor, literally 'Order of Lesser Brothers') stems from Francis of Assisi's rejection of extravagance. Francis was the son of a wealthy cloth merchant, but gave up his wealth to pursue his faith more fully. He had cut all ties that remained with his family, and pursued a life living in solidarity with his fellow brothers in Christ.Schwaller, J. F. (2014). Francis of Assisi: The Life by Augustine Thompson (review). The Americas 71(2), 379-380. Cambridge University Press. Retrieved November 2, 2017, from Project MUSE database. http://muse.jhu.edu/article/555981 Francis adopted the simple tunic worn by peasants as the religious habit for his order, and had others who wished to join him do the same. Those who joined him became the original Order of Friars Minor. ;First Order The First Order or the Order of Friars Minor are commonly called simply the Franciscans. This order is a mendicant religious order of men, some of whom trace their origin to Francis of Assisi. Their official Latin name is the . St. Francis thus referred to his followers as \\"Fraticelli\\", meaning \\"Little Brothers\\". Franciscan brothers are informally called friars or the Minorites. The modern organization of the Friars Minor comprises three separate families or groups, each considered a religious order in its own right under its own minister General and particular type of governance. They all live according to a body of regulations known as the Rule of St Francis. These are * The Order of Friars Minor, also known as the Observants, are most commonly simply called Franciscan friars, official name: Friars Minor (OFM). * The Order of Friars Minor Capuchin or simply Capuchins, official name: Friars Minor Capuchin (OFM Cap.). * The Conventual Franciscans or Minorites, official name: Friars Minor Conventual (OFM Conv.). ;Second Order The Second Order, most commonly called Poor Clares in English-speaking countries, consists of religious sisters. The order is called the Order of St. Clare (OSC), but in the thirteenth century, prior to 1263, this order was referred to as \\"The Poor Ladies\\", \\"The Poor Enclosed Nuns\\", and \\"The Order of San Damiano\\".See ;Third Order The Franciscan third order, known as the Third Order of Saint Francis, has many men and women members, separated into two main branches: * The Secular Franciscan Order, OFS, originally known as the Brothers and Sisters of Penance or Third Order of Penance, try to live the ideals of the movement in their daily lives outside of religious institutes. * The members of the Third Order Regular (TOR) live in religious communities under the traditional religious vows. They grew out of the Secular Franciscan Order. The 2013 gave the following figures for the membership of the principal male Franciscan orders:.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 1422 * Order of Friars Minor (OFM): 2,212 communities; 14,123 members; 9,735 priests * Franciscan Order of Friars Minor Conventual (OFM Conv.): 667 communities; 4,289 members; 2,921 priests * Franciscan Order of Friars Minor Capuchin (OFM Cap.): 1,633 communities; 10,786 members; 7,057 priests * Third Order Regular of Saint Francis (TOR): 176 communities; 870 members; 576 priests The coat of arms that is a universal symbol of Franciscans \\"contains the Tau cross, with two crossed arms: Christ‚Äôs right hand with the nail wound and Francis‚Äô left hand with the stigmata wound.\\" History The Confirmation of the Franciscan Rule by Domenico Ghirlandaio (1449‚Äì1494), Capella Sassetti, Florence =Beginnings= A sermon Francis heard in 1209 on Mt 10:9 made such an impression on him that he decided to devote himself wholly to a life of apostolic poverty. Clad in a rough garment, barefoot, and, after the Evangelical precept, without staff or scrip, he began to preach repentance. He was soon joined by a prominent fellow townsman, Bernard of Quintavalle, who contributed all that he had to the work, and by other companions, who are said to have reached the number of eleven within a year. The brothers lived in the deserted leper colony of Rivo Torto near Assisi; but they spent much of their time traveling through the mountainous districts of Umbria, always cheerful and full of songs, yet making a deep impression on their hearers by their earnest exhortations. Their life was extremely ascetic, though such practices were apparently not prescribed by the first rule which Francis gave them (probably as early as 1209) which seems to have been nothing more than a collection of Scriptural passages emphasizing the duty of poverty. In spite of some similarities between this principle and some of the fundamental ideas of the followers of Peter Waldo, the brotherhood of Assisi succeeded in gaining the approval of Pope Innocent III.Chesterton(1924), pp. 107‚Äì108 What seems to have impressed first the Bishop of Assisi, Guido, then Cardinal Giovanni di San Paolo and finally Innocent himself, was their utter loyalty to the Church and the clergy. Innocent III was not only the pope reigning during the life of St. Francis of Assisi, but he was also responsible for helping to construct the church Francis was being called to rebuild. Innocent III and the Fourth Lateran Council helped maintain the church in Europe. Innocent probably saw in them a possible answer to his desire for an orthodox preaching force to counter heresy. Many legends have clustered around the decisive audience of Francis with the pope. The realistic account in Matthew Paris, according to which the pope originally sent the shabby saint off to keep swine, and only recognized his real worth by his ready obedience, has, in spite of its improbability, a certain historical interest, since it shows the natural antipathy of the older Benedictine monasticism to the plebeian mendicant orders. The group was tonsured and Francis was ordained as a deacon, allowing him to proclaim Gospel passages and preach in churches during Mass.Galli(2002), pp. 74‚Äì80 =Francis's last years= Francis had to suffer from the dissensions just alluded to and the transformation they effected in the original constitution of the brotherhood making it a regular order under strict supervision from Rome. Exasperated by the demands of running a growing and fractious Order, Francis asked Pope Honorius III for help in 1219. He was assigned Cardinal Ugolino as protector of the Order by the pope. Francis resigned the day-to-day running of the Order into the hands of others but retained the power to shape the Order's legislation, writing a Rule in 1221 which he revised and had approved in 1223. After about 1221, the day-to-day running of the Order was in the hands of Brother Elias of Cortona, an able friar who would be elected as leader of the friars a few years after Francis's death (1232) but who aroused much opposition because of his autocratic leadership style.Robinson, Paschal. \\"Elias of Cortona.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 28 December 2019 He planned and built the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi in which Saint Francis is buried, a building which includes the friary Sacro Convento, still today the spiritual centre of the Order. Honorius III Approving the Rule of St. Francis of Assisi, Bartolome del Castro, c. 1500 (Philadelphia Museum of Art) In the external successes of the brothers, as they were reported at the yearly general chapters, there was much to encourage Francis. , the first German provincial, a zealous advocate of the founder's strict principle of poverty, began in 1221 from Augsburg, with twenty-five companions, to win for the Order the land watered by the Rhine and the Danube. In 1224 Agnellus of Pisa led a small group of friars to England. The branch of the Order arriving in England became known as the \\"greyfriars\\".Greyfriars in England Beginning at Greyfriars at Canterbury, the ecclesiastical capital, they moved on to London, the political capital, and Oxford, the intellectual capital. From these three bases the Franciscans swiftly expanded to embrace the principal towns of England. Dissensions during Francis's life The controversy about how to follow the Gospel life of poverty, which extends through the first three centuries of Franciscan history, began in the lifetime of the founder. The ascetic brothers Matthew of Narni and Gregory of Naples, a nephew of Cardinal Ugolino, were the two vicars-general to whom Francis had entrusted the direction of the order during his absence. They carried through at a chapter which they held certain stricter regulations in regard to fasting and the reception of alms, which departed from the spirit of the original rule. It did not take Francis long, on his return, to suppress this insubordinate tendency but he was less successful in regard to another of an opposite nature which soon came up. Elias of Cortona originated a movement for the increase of the worldly consideration of the Order and the adaptation of its system to the plans of the hierarchy which conflicted with the original notions of the founder and helped to bring about the successive changes in the rule already described. Francis was not alone in opposition to this lax and secularizing tendency. On the contrary, the party which clung to his original views and after his death took his \\"Testament\\" for their guide, known as Observantists or , was at least equal in numbers and activity to the followers of Elias. Custody of the Holy Land After an intense apostolic activity in Italy, in 1219 Francis went to Egypt with the Fifth Crusade to announce the Gospel to the Saracens. He met with the Sultan Malik al-Kamil, initiating a spirit of dialogue and understanding between Christianity and Islam. The Franciscan presence in the Holy Land started in 1217, when the province of Syria was established, with Brother Elias as Minister. By 1229 the friars had a small house near the fifth station of the Via Dolorosa. In 1272 sultan Baibars allowed the Franciscans to settle in the Cenacle on Mount Zion. Later on, in 1309, they also settled in the Holy Sepulchre and in Bethlehem. In 1335 the king of Naples Robert of Anjou () and his wife Sancha of Majorca () bought the Cenacle and gave it to the Franciscans. Pope Clement VI by the Bulls Gratias agimus and Nuper charissimae (1342) declared the Franciscans as the official custodians of the Holy Places in the name of the Catholic Church. The Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land is still in force today. =Development after Francis's death= Development to 1239 Anthony of Padua () with the Infant Christ, painting by Antonio de Pereda () Elias was a lay friar, and encouraged other laymen to enter the order. This brought opposition from many ordained friars and ministers provincial, who also opposed increased centralization of the Order. Gregory IX declared his intention to build a splendid church to house the body of Francis and the task fell to Elias, who at once began to lay plans for the erection of a great basilica at Assisi, to enshrine the remains of the Poverello. In order to build the basilica, Elias proceeded to collect money in various ways to meet the expenses of the building. Elias thus also alienated the zealots in the order, who felt this was not in keeping with the founder's views upon the question of poverty. The earliest leader of the strict party was Brother Leo, a close companion of Francis during his last years and the author of the , a strong polemic against the laxer party. Having protested against the collection of money for the erection of the basilica of San Francesco, it was Leo who broke in pieces the marble box which Elias had set up for offertories for the completion of the basilica at Assisi. For this Elias had him scourged, and this outrage on St Francis's dearest disciple consolidated the opposition to Elias. Leo was the leader in the early stages of the struggle in the order for the maintenance of St Francis's ideas on strict poverty.Robinson, Paschal. \\"Brother Leo.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 28 December 2019 At the chapter held in May 1227, Elias was rejected in spite of his prominence, and Giovanni Parenti, Minister Provincial of Spain, was elected Minister General of the order. In 1232 Elias succeeded him, and under him the Order significantly developed its ministries and presence in the towns. Many new houses were founded, especially in Italy, and in many of them special attention was paid to education. The somewhat earlier settlements of Franciscan teachers at the universities (in Paris, for example, where Alexander of Hales was teaching) continued to develop. Contributions toward the promotion of the Order's work, and especially the building of the Basilica in Assisi, came in abundantly. Funds could only be accepted on behalf of the friars for determined, imminent, real necessities that could not be provided for from begging. When in 1230, the General Chapter could not agree on a common interpretation of the 1223 Rule it sent a delegation including Anthony of Padua to Pope Gregory IX for an authentic interpretation of this piece of papal legislation. The bull of Gregory IX declared that the Testament of St. Francis was not legally binding and offered an interpretation of poverty that would allow the Order to continue to develop. Gregory IX, authorized agents of the Order to have custody of such funds where they could not be spent immediately. Elias pursued with great severity the principal leaders of the opposition, and even Bernardo di Quintavalle, the founder's first disciple, was obliged to conceal himself for years in the forest of Monte Sefro. The conflict between the two parties lasted many years and the won several notable victories in spite of the favor shown to their opponents by the papal administration, until finally the reconciliation of the two points of view was seen to be impossible and the order was actually split into halves. 1239‚Äì1274 Mafra in Portugal Elias governed the Order from the center, imposing his authority on the provinces (as had Francis). A reaction to this centralized government was led from the provinces of England and Germany. At the general chapter of 1239, held in Rome under the personal presidency of Gregory IX, Elias was deposed in favor of Albert of Pisa, the former provincial of England, a moderate Observantist. This chapter introduced General Statutes to govern the Order and devolved power from the Minister General to the Ministers Provincial sitting in chapter. The next two Ministers General, Haymo of Faversham (1240‚Äì44) and Crescentius of Jesi (1244‚Äì47), consolidated this greater democracy in the Order but also led the Order towards a greater clericalization. The new Pope Innocent IV supported them in this. In a bull of November 14, 1245, this pope even sanctioned an extension of the system of financial agents, and allowed the funds to be used not simply for those things that were necessary for the friars but also for those that were useful. The Observantist party took a strong stand in opposition to this ruling and agitated so successfully against the lax General that in 1247, at a chapter held in Lyon, France‚Äîwhere Innocent IV was then residing‚Äîhe was replaced by the strict Observantist John of Parma (1247‚Äì57) and the Order refused to implement any provisions of Innocent IV that were laxer than those of Gregory IX. Bonaventure (1221‚Äì1274), painting by Claude Fran√ßois () Elias, who had been excommunicated and taken under the protection of Frederick II, was now forced to give up all hope of recovering his power in the Order. He died in 1253, after succeeding by recantation in obtaining the removal of his censures. Under John of Parma, who enjoyed the favor of Innocent IV and Pope Alexander IV, the influence of the Order was notably increased, especially by the provisions of the latter pope in regard to the academic activity of the brothers. He not only sanctioned the theological institutes in Franciscan houses, but did all he could to support the friars in the Mendicant Controversy, when the secular Masters of the University of Paris and the Bishops of France combined to attack the mendicant orders. It was due to the action of Alexander IV's envoys, who were obliged to threaten the university authorities with excommunication, that the degree of doctor of theology was finally conceded to the Dominican Thomas Aquinas and the Franciscan Bonaventure (1257), who had previously been able to lecture only as licentiates. The Franciscan Gerard of Borgo San Donnino at this time issued a Joachimite tract and John of Parma was seen as favoring the condemned theology of Joachim of Fiore. To protect the Order from its enemies, John was forced to step down and recommended Bonaventure as his successor. Bonaventure saw the need to unify the Order around a common ideology and both wrote a new life of the founder and collected the Order's legislation into the Constitutions of Narbonne, so called because they were ratified by the Order at its chapter held at Narbonne, France, in 1260. In the chapter of Pisa three years later Bonaventure's was approved as the only biography of Francis and all previous biographies were ordered to be destroyed. Bonaventure ruled (1257‚Äì74) in a moderate spirit, which is represented also by various works produced by the order in his time‚Äîespecially by the written by David of Augsburg soon after 1260. =14th century= 1274‚Äì1300 The successor to Bonaventure, Jerome of Ascoli or Girolamo Masci (1274‚Äì79), (the future Pope Nicholas IV), and his successor, Bonagratia of Bologna (1279‚Äì85), also followed a middle course. Severe measures were taken against certain extreme Spirituals who, on the strength of the rumor that Pope Gregory X was intending at the Council of Lyon (1274‚Äì75) to force the mendicant orders to tolerate the possession of property, threatened both pope and council with the renunciation of allegiance. Attempts were made, however, to satisfy the reasonable demands of the Spiritual party, as in the bull Exiit qui seminat of Pope Nicholas III (1279), which pronounced the principle of complete poverty to be meritorious and holy, but interpreted it in the way of a somewhat sophistical distinction between possession and usufruct. The bull was received respectfully by Bonagratia and the next two generals, Arlotto of Prato (1285‚Äì87) and Matthew of Aqua Sparta (1287‚Äì89); but the Spiritual party under the leadership of the Bonaventuran pupil and apocalyptic Pierre Jean Olivi regarded its provisions for the dependence of the friars upon the pope and the division between brothers occupied in manual labor and those employed on spiritual missions as a corruption of the fundamental principles of the Order. They were not won over by the conciliatory attitude of the next general, Raymond Gaufredi (1289‚Äì96), and of the Franciscan Pope Nicholas IV (1288‚Äì92). The attempt made by the next pope, Celestine V, an old friend of the order, to end the strife by uniting the Observantist party with his own order of hermits (see Celestines) was scarcely more successful. Only a part of the Spirituals joined the new order, and the secession scarcely lasted beyond the reign of the hermit-pope. Pope Boniface VIII annulled Celestine's bull of foundation with his other acts, deposed the general Raymond Gaufredi, and appointed a man of laxer tendency, John de Murro, in his place. The Benedictine section of the Celestines was separated from the Franciscan section, and the latter was formally suppressed by Pope Boniface VIII in 1302. The leader of the Observantists, Olivi, who spent his last years in the Franciscan house at Tarnius and died there in 1298, had pronounced against the extremer \\"Spiritual\\" attitude, and given an exposition of the theory of poverty which was approved by the more moderate Observantists, and for a long time constituted their principle. Persecution Under Pope Clement V (1305‚Äì14) this party succeeded in exercising some influence on papal decisions. In 1309 Clement had a commission sit at Avignon for the purpose of reconciling the conflicting parties. Ubertino of Casale, the leader, after Olivi's death, of the stricter party, who was a member of the commission, induced the Council of Vienne to arrive at a decision in the main favoring his views, and the papal constitution (1313) was on the whole conceived in the same sense. Clement's successor, Pope John XXII (1316‚Äì34), favored the laxer or conventual party. By the bull he modified several provisions of the constitution , and required the formal submission of the Spirituals. Some of them, encouraged by the strongly Observantist general Michael of Cesena, ventured to dispute the pope's right so to deal with the provisions of his predecessor. Sixty-four of them were summoned to Avignon and the most obstinate delivered over to the Inquisition, four of them being burned (1318). Shortly before this all the separate houses of the Observantists had been suppressed. Renewed controversy on the question of poverty Franciscan friary in Katowice, Poland A few years later a new controversy, this time theoretical, broke out on the question of poverty. In his 14 August 1279 bull , Pope Nicholas III had confirmed the arrangement already established by Pope Innocent IV, by which all property given to the Franciscans was vested in the Holy See, which granted the friars the mere use of it. The bull declared that renunciation of ownership of all things \\"both individually but also in common, for God's sake, is meritorious and holy; Christ, also, showing the way of perfection, taught it by word and confirmed it by example, and the first founders of the Church militant, as they had drawn it from the fountainhead itself, distributed it through the channels of their teaching and life to those wishing to live perfectly.\\"English translation 1; cf. English translation 2 and another translation in Rosalind B. Brooke, The Image of St Francis (Cambridge University Press, 2006 ), p. 98. Although Exiit qui seminat banned disputing about its contents, the decades that followed saw increasingly bitter disputes about the form of poverty to be observed by Franciscans, with the Spirituals (so called because associated with the Age of the Spirit that Joachim of Fiore had said would begin in 1260) pitched against the Conventual Franciscans.Brooke, The Image of St Francis, p. 100 Pope Clement V's bull of 20 November 1312 failed to effect a compromise between the two factions. Clement V's successor, Pope John XXII was determined to suppress what he considered to be the excesses of the Spirituals, who contended eagerly for the view that Christ and his apostles had possessed absolutely nothing, either separately or jointly, and who were citing in support of their view. In 1317, John XXII formally condemned the group of them known as the Fraticelli. On 26 March 1322, with , he removed the ban on discussion of Nicholas III's bullBrooke, p. 100 and commissioned experts to examine the idea of poverty based on belief that Christ and the apostles owned nothing. The experts disagreed among themselves, but the majority condemned the idea on the grounds that it would condemn the Church's right to have possessions. The Franciscan chapter held in Perugia in May 1322 declared on the contrary: \\"To say or assert that Christ, in showing the way of perfection, and the Apostles, in following that way and setting an example to others who wished to lead the perfect life, possessed nothing either severally or in common, either by right of ownership and or by personal right, we corporately and unanimously declare to be not heretical, but true and catholic.\\" By the bull of 8 December 1322, John XXII, declaring it ridiculous to pretend that every scrap of food given to the friars and eaten by them belonged to the pope, refused to accept ownership over the goods of the Franciscans in the future and granted them exemption from the rule that absolutely forbade ownership of anything even in common, thus forcing them to accept ownership.Brooke, pp. 100-101 And, on 12 November 1323, he issued the short bull English translation 1 ; English translation 2 which declared \\"erroneous and heretical\\" the doctrine that Christ and his apostles had no possessions whatever. John XXII's actions thus demolished the fictitious structure that gave the appearance of absolute poverty to the life of the Franciscan friars.Brooke, p. 101 Influential members of the order protested, such as the minister general Michael of Cesena, the English provincial William of Ockham, and Bonagratia of Bergamo. In 1324, Louis the Bavarian sided with the Spirituals and accused the pope of heresy. In reply to the argument of his opponents that Nicholas III's bull was fixed and irrevocable, John XXII issued the bull on 10 November 1324English translation 1 ; English translation 2 in which he declared that it cannot be inferred from the words of the 1279 bull that Christ and the apostles had nothing, adding: \\"Indeed, it can be inferred rather that the Gospel life lived by Christ and the Apostles did not exclude some possessions in common, since living 'without property' does not require that those living thus should have nothing in common.\\" In 1328, Michael of Cesena was summoned to Avignon to explain the Order's intransigence in refusing the pope's orders and its complicity with Louis of Bavaria. Michael was imprisoned in Avignon, together with Francesco d'Ascoli, Bonagratia, and William of Ockham. In January of that year Louis of Bavaria entered Rome and had himself crowned emperor. Three months later he declared John XXII deposed and installed the Spiritual Franciscan Pietro Rainalducci as antipope. The Franciscan chapter that opened in Bologna on 28 May reelected Michael of Cesena, who two days before had escaped with his companions from Avignon. But in August Louis the Bavarian and his pope had to flee Rome before an attack by Robert, King of Naples. Only a small part of the Franciscan Order joined the opponents of John XXII, and at a general chapter held in Paris in 1329 the majority of all the houses declared their submission to the Pope. With the bull of 16 November 1329, John XXII replied to Michael of Cesena's attacks on , , and . In 1330, Antipope Nicholas V submitted, followed later by the ex-general Michael, and finally, just before his death, by Ockham. =Separate congregations= A Christian missionary friar landing in southern India (14th Century) Out of all these dissensions in the 14th century sprang a number of separate congregations, or almost sects, to say nothing of the heretical parties of the Beghards and Fraticelli, some of which developed within the Order on both hermit and cenobitic principles and may here be mentioned: Clareni The Clareni or Clarenini was an association of hermits established on the river Clareno in the march of Ancona by Angelo da Clareno (1337). Like several other smaller congregations, it was obliged in 1568 under Pope Pius V to unite with the general body of Observantists. Minorites of Narbonne As a separate congregation, this originated through the union of a number of houses which followed Olivi after 1308. It was limited to southwestern France and, its members being accused of the heresy of the Beghards, was suppressed by the Inquisition during the controversies under John XXII. Reform of Johannes de Vallibus Franciscan convent at Lopud in Croatia This was founded in the hermitage of St. Bartholomew at Brugliano near Foligno in 1334. The congregation was suppressed by the Franciscan general chapter in 1354; reestablished in 1368 by Paolo de' Trinci of Foligno; confirmed by Gregory XI in 1373, and spread rapidly from Central Italy to France, Spain, Hungary, and elsewhere. Most of the Observantist houses joined this congregation by degrees, so that it became known simply as the \\"brothers of the regular Observance.\\" It acquired the favor of the popes by its energetic opposition to the heretical Fraticelli, and was expressly recognized by the Council of Constance (1415). It was allowed to have a special vicar-general of its own and legislate for its members without reference to the conventual part of the Order. Through the work of such men as Bernardino of Siena, Giovanni da Capistrano, and Dietrich Coelde (b. 1435? at Munster; was a member of the Brethren of the Common Life, died December 11, 1515), it gained great prominence during the 15th century. By the end of the Middle Ages, the Observantists, with 1,400 houses, comprised nearly half of the entire Order. Their influence brought about attempts at reform even among the Conventuals, including the quasi-Observantist brothers living under the rule of the Conventual ministers (Martinianists or Observantes sub ministris), such as the male Colletans, later led by Boniface de Ceva in his reform attempts principally in France and Germany; the reformed congregation founded in 1426 by the Spaniard Philip de Berbegal and distinguished by the special importance they attached to the little hood (); the Neutri, a group of reformers originating about 1463 in Italy, who tried to take a middle ground between the Conventuals and Observantists, but refused to obey the heads of either, until they were compelled by the pope to affiliate with the regular Observantists, or with those of the Common Life; the Caperolani, a congregation founded about 1470 in North Italy by Peter Caperolo, but dissolved again on the death of its founder in 1481; the Amadeists, founded by the noble Portuguese Amadeo, who entered the Franciscan order at Assisi in 1452, gathered around him a number of adherents to his fairly strict principles (numbering finally twenty-six houses), and died in the odor of sanctity in 1482. Unification Franciscan Church from 15th century in Przeworsk, Poland Projects for a union between the two main branches of the Order were put forth not only by the Council of Constance but by several popes, without any positive result. By direction of Pope Martin V, John of Capistrano drew up statutes which were to serve as a basis for reunion, and they were actually accepted by a general chapter at Assisi in 1430; but the majority of the Conventual houses refused to agree to them, and they remained without effect. At John of Capistrano's request Eugene IV issued a bull (, 1446) aimed at the same result, but again nothing was accomplished. Equally unsuccessful were the attempts of the Franciscan Pope Sixtus IV, who bestowed a vast number of privileges on both of the original mendicant orders, but by this very fact lost the favor of the Observants and failed in his plans for reunion. Julius II succeeded in reducing some of the smaller branches, but left the division of the two great parties untouched. This division was finally legalized by Leo X, after a general chapter held in Rome in 1517, in connection with the reform-movement of the Fifth Lateran Council, had once more declared the impossibility of reunion. The less strict principles of the Conventuals, permitting the possession of real estate and the enjoyment of fixed revenues, were recognized as tolerable, while the Observants, in contrast to this , were held strictly to their own or pauper. All of the groups that followed the Franciscan Rule literally were united to the Observants, and the right to elect the Minister General of the Order, together with the seal of the Order, was given to this united grouping. This grouping, since it adhered more closely to the rule of the founder, was allowed to claim a certain superiority over the Conventuals. The Observant general (elected now for six years, not for life) inherited the title of \\"Minister-General of the Whole Order of St. Francis\\" and was granted the right to confirm the choice of a head for the Conventuals, who was known as \\"Master-General of the Friars Minor Conventual\\"--although this privilege never became practically operative. =New World missions= Franciscans and the Inquisition About 1236, Pope Gregory IX appointed the Franciscans, along with the Dominicans, as Inquisitors. The Franciscans had been involved in anti-heretical activities from the beginning simply by preaching and acting as living examples of the Gospel life.Prudlo, Donald S., The Origin, Development, and Refinement of Medieval Religious Mendicancies (Brill, 2011) p 144 As official Inquisitors, they were authorized to use torture to extract confessions, as approved by Innocent IV in 1252. The Franciscans were involved in the torture and trials of heretics and witches throughout the Middle Ages and wrote their own manuals to guide Inquisitors, such as the 14th century Codex Casanatensis for use by Inquisitors in Tuscany. Contemporary organizations =First Order= Order of Friars Minor The Order of Friars Minor (OFM) has 1,500 houses in about 100 provinces and , with about 16,000 members. In 1897, Pope Leo XIII combined the Observants, Discalced (Alcantarines), Recollects, and Riformati into one order under general constitutions. While the Capuchins and Conventuals wanted the reunited Observants to be referred to as The Order of Friars Minor of the Leonine Union, they were instead called simply the Order of Friars Minor. Despite the tensions caused by this forced union the Order grew from 1897 to reach a peak of 26,000 members in the 1960s before declining after the 1970s. The Order is headed by a Minister General, who since May 2013 is Father Michael Anthony Perry.http://press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/30743.php?index=30743‚ü®=en Order of Friars Minor Conventual The Order of Friars Minor Conventual (OFM Conv.) consists of 290 houses worldwide with a total of almost 5000 friars. They have experienced growth in this century throughout the world. They are located in Italy, the United States, Canada, Australia, and throughout Latin America, and Africa. They are the largest in number in Poland because of the work and inspiration of St. Maximilian Kolbe. Order of Friars Minor Capuchin Bernardino Ochino (1487‚Äì1564), co-founder of the Capuchin Order The Order of Friars Minor Capuchin (OFM Cap.) are the youngest branch of Franciscans, founded in 1525 by Matteo Serafini (Matteo Bassi, Matteo da Bascio), an Observant friar, who felt himself called to an even stricter observance of Franciscan austerity. With the support of the Papal Court, the new branch received early recognition and grew fast, first in Italy and after 1574 all over Europe and throughout the world. The Capuchins eventually became a separate order in 1619. The name Capuchins refers to the particular shape of the long hood or ; originally a popular nickname, it has become a part of the official name of the order. The order now exists in 106 countries all over the world, with around 10,500 brothers living in more than 1700 communities known as fraternities or friaries. =Second Order= Poor Clares Clare of Assisi (1194‚Äì1253), founder of the Poor Clares, in a painting by Simone Martini (1284‚Äì1344) in the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi The Poor Clares, officially the Order of Saint Clare, are members of a contemplative order of nuns in the Catholic Church. The Poor Clares were the second Franciscan order to be established. Founded by Saints Clare of Assisi and Francis of Assisi on Palm Sunday in the year 1212, they were organized after the Order of Friars Minor (the first order), and before the Third Order of Saint Francis. As of 2011 there were over 20,000 Poor Clare nuns in over 75 countries throughout the world. They follow several different observances and are organized into federations. The Poor Clares follow the Rule of St. Clare which was approved by Pope Innocent IV the day before Clare's death in 1253. The main branch of the Order (OSC) follows the observance of Pope Urban. Other branches established since that time, who operate under their own unique constitutions, are the Colettine Poor Clares (PCC ‚Äì founded 1410), the Capuchin Poor Clares (OSC Cap. ‚Äì founded 1538), and the Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration (PCPA ‚Äì founded 1854). =Third Order= The Blessed Luchesius Modestini, honored as the first Franciscan tertiary The Third Order of Saint Francis comprises people who desired to grow in holiness in their daily lives without entering monastic life. After founding the Friars Minor and seeing a need, Francis created the Secular Franciscan Order, also known as Brothers and Sisters of Penance. During his lifetime, many married men and women and even clergy and hermits were drawn to the vision of life offered by Francis, but due to their life commitments they were not able to enter the Friars Minor or the Poor Clares. For this reason, he founded a way of life to which married men and women, as well as the single and the secular clergy, could belong and live according to the Gospel. According to the traditions of the Order, the original Rule was given by St. Francis in 1221 to a married couple, Luchesius Modestini and his wife, Buonadonna, who wished to follow him but did not feel called to separate as a married couple. Secular Franciscan Order The Secular Franciscan Order, prior to 1978 also known as the Third Order Secular of Saint Francis, is an order founded by St. Francis in 1212 for brothers and sisters who do not live in a religious community. Members of the order continue to live secular lives, however they do gather regularly for fraternal activities. In the United States alone there are 17,000 professed members of the order. Members of the Order live according to a Rule composed by St Francis in 1221. The Rule was slightly modified through the centuries and was replaced at the turn of the 20th century by Pope Leo XIII, himself a member of the Order. A new and current Rule was approved by Pope Paul VI in 1978, and the Third Order was renamed the Secular Franciscan Order. It is an international organization with its own Minister General based in Rome. Third Order Regular Blessed Mary Frances Schervier (1819‚Äì1876) was a member of the Third Order of St. Francis who became the foundress of the Poor Sisters of St. Francis, founded to serve the needy. Within a century of the death of St. Francis, members of the Third Order began to live in common, in an attempt to follow a more ascetical way of life. The Blessed Angela of Foligno (+1309) was foremost among those who achieved great depths in their lives of prayer and service of the poor, while living in community with other women of the Order. Among the men, the Third Order Regular of St. Francis of Penance was formed in 1447 by a papal decree that united several communities of hermits following the Third Order Rule into a single Order with its own Minister General. Today it is an international community of friars who desire to emphasize the works of mercy and on-going conversion. The community is also known as the Franciscan Friars, TOR, and they strive to \\"rebuild the Church\\" in areas of high school and college education, parish ministry, church renewal, social justice, campus ministry, hospital chaplaincies, foreign missions, and other ministries in places where the Church is needed. After the formal recognition of the members of religious tertiary communities, the following centuries saw a steady growth of such communities across Europe. Initially, the women's communities took a monastic form of life, either voluntarily or under pressure from ecclesiastical superiors. The great figure of this development was St. Hyacintha Mariscotti, TOR. As Europe entered the upheavals of the modern age, new communities arose which were able to focus more exclusively on social service, especially during the immediate post-Napoleonic period which devastated much of Western Europe. An example of this is the Blessed Mary Frances Schervier, SPSF. =Third Order Regular in North America= This movement continued in North America as various congregations arose from one coast to another, in answer to the needs of the large emigrant communities that were flooding the cities of the United States and Canada. The Third Order Regular of the Brothers of the Poor of St. Francis of Assisi, CFP, are an active community based in the United States with houses in Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany, and Brazil. These Franciscans strive to live an integrated life through prayer, community, and ministry to the poor, neglected and disadvantaged youth, the powerless, people in need, and the elderly. The Brothers of the Poor live by their vows of poverty (living a simple lifestyle), consecrated chastity (loving all, possessing no one, striving sincerely, for singleness of heart, a celibate way of loving and being loved), and obedience (to God, to the community, to the Church, and to self). The Brothers of the Poor also serve persons with AIDS and people who ask for help, regardless of their religion or their social/economic background. They are teachers, childcare workers, social workers, counselors, pastoral ministers, retreat ministers, religious educators, and school administrators, along with other tasks. The Regular Tertiaries, officially the Third Order Regular of St. Francis of Penance, who operate the Franciscan University of Steubenville, follow a rule approved by Pope Leo X. Today this group is present in 17 countries: Italy, Croatia, Spain, France, Germany, Austria, USA, India, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Brazil, Paraguay, Mexico, Peru, Sweden, Bangladesh, and the Philippines.  Brothers and Sisters of Penance of St. Francis  Oswald Staniforth, a 19th-century friar The Brothers and Sisters of Penance of St. Francis, is a private confraternity of the Roman Catholic Church whose members strive to model their lives according to the Rule and Statutes of the Primitive Rule of the Third Order of St. Francis, which was written for lay people in 1221 by St. Francis of Assisi. Right now there are several hundred members within the United States and a few hundred more throughout the world. The order was originally started in 1996 by members of the Archdiocese of St. Paul in Minnesota. Other tertiaries * In 1435, Saint Francis of Paola founded the \\"Poor Hermits of Saint Francis of Assisi\\", later known as the \\"Hermits of the Order of Minims\\", and then renamed the \\"Order of Minims\\" in 1506 by Pope Julius II. There are mendicant friars, contemplative nuns, and lay tertiaries. * The Society of the Atonement, also known as Graymoor Friars and Graymoor Sisters, started in 1898 as a religious community in the Episcopal Church, and came into union with the Holy See in 1909. * The Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate started in 1970, and became an institute with Pontifical Right in 1998. In that same year, the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate also became an institute with Pontifical Right. There are also Third Order Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate, an offshoot of the Franciscan Tertiaries of the Immaculate. =Other Franciscan organizations= * The Community of the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal started in 1987, and the Franciscan Sisters of the Renewal in 1988. * The Franciscan Missionaries of the Eternal Word started in 1987, and are now a Public Clerical Association of the Faithful. * Franciscans International is a Non-governmental organization (NGO) with General Consultative status at the United Nations, uniting the voices of Franciscan brothers and sisters from around the world. It operates under the sponsorship of the Conference of the Franciscan Family (CFF) and serves all Franciscans and the global community by bringing grassroots Franciscans to the United Nations forums in New York City and Geneva. It brings the spiritual and ethical values of the Franciscans to the United Nations and international organisations. =Other Christian traditions= One of the results of the Oxford Movement in the Anglican Church during the 19th century was the re- establishment of religious orders, including some of Franciscan inspiration. The principal Anglican communities in the Franciscan tradition are the Community of St. Francis (women, founded 1905), the Poor Clares of Reparation (PCR), the Society of Saint Francis (men, founded 1934), the Community of St. Clare (women, enclosed), and the Order of St. Francis (men, founded in 2003). There is also a Third Order known as the Third Order Society of St Francis (TSSF). There is also an order of Sisters of St. Clare in the Puget Sound area of Washington state (Diocese of Olympia), the Little Sisters of St. Clare. There are further some small Franciscan communities within European Protestantism and the Old Catholic Church.For example, the OSFOC. There are some Franciscan orders in Lutheran Churches, including the Order of Lutheran Franciscans, the Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary, and the Evangelische Kanaan Franziskus-Bruderschaft (Kanaan Franciscan Brothers). In addition, there are associations of Franciscan inspiration not connected with a mainstream Christian tradition and describing themselves as ecumenical or dispersed. Distinguishing characteristics =Spirituality= Franciscan theology conforms to broader doctrine with the Catholic Church, but involves several unique emphases. Franciscan theologians view creation, the natural world, as good and joyous, and avoid dwelling on the \\"stain of original sin.\\" Saint Francis expressed great affection towards animals and inanimate natural objects as fellow inhabitants of God's creation, in his work Canticle of the Creatures. Special emphasis is put on the Incarnation of Christ viewed as a special act of humility, as Francis was struck by God's great charity in sacrificing his son for our salvation; they also exhibit great devotion to the Eucharist. The Rule of Saint Francis calls for members to practice simple living and detachment from material possessions in emulation of Jesus' life and earthly ministry. The simple lifestyle helps members of the order, in whichever branch, to experience solidarity with the poor and to work for social justice. Franciscan spirituality also strongly emphasizes working to preserve the Church, and remain loyal to it. =Visions and stigmata= stigmatization of St. Francis Among Catholic religious, Franciscans have proportionally reported higher ratios of stigmata and have claimed proportionally higher ratios of visions of Jesus and Mary. Saint Francis of Assisi himself was one of the first reported cases of stigmata, and perhaps the most famous stigmatic of modern times is Saint Padre Pio, a Capuchin, who also reported visions of Jesus and Mary. Pio's stigmata persisted for over fifty years and he was examined by numerous physicians in the 20th century, who confirmed the existence of the wounds, but none of whom could produce a medical explanation for the fact that his bleeding wounds would never get infected. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, his wounds healed once, but reappeared.Britannica Online Encyclopedia, Padre Pio According to the Columbia Encyclopedia some medical authorities who examined Padre Pio's wounds were inclined to believe that the stigmata were connected with nervous or cataleptic hysteria. According to Answers.com the wounds were examined by Luigi Romanelli, chief physician of the City Hospital of Barletta, for about one year; Giorgio Festa, a private practitioner who examined them in 1920 and 1925; Giuseppe Bastianelli, a physician to Pope Benedict XV, who agreed that the wounds existed but made no other comment; and pathologist Amico Bignami who also observed the wounds but made no diagnosis. =Contributions to biblical scholarship= Blessed Gabriele Allegra (1907‚Äì1976) of the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum The Franciscans established the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum as an academic society based in Jerusalem and Hong Kong for the study of scripture. The Hong Kong branch founded by the Blessed Gabriele Allegra produced the first complete translation of the Catholic Bible in Chinese in 1968 after a 40-year effort. The Studium Biblicum Translation is often considered the authoritative Chinese Bible among Catholics. The early efforts of another Franciscan, namely Giovanni di Monte Corvino who had attempted a first translation of the Bible in Beijing in the 14th century, provided the initial spark for Gabriele Allegra's 40 year undertaking, when at the age of 21 he happened to attend the 6th centenary celebration for Monte Corvino. =Notable members= Roger Bacon (), statue from the 19th century in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History The Franciscan order boasts a number of distinguished members. From its first century can be cited the three great scholastics Alexander of Hales, Bonaventure, and John Duns Scotus, the \\"Doctor of Wonders\\" Roger Bacon, and the well-known mystic authors and popular preachers David of Augsburg and Berthold of Regensburg. Bernardino of Siena (1380‚Äì1440), painted by Jacopo Bellini () During the Middle Ages noteworthy members included Nicholas of Lyra, Biblical commentator Bernardino of Siena, philosopher William of Ockham, preachers John of Capistrano, Oliver Maillard, and Michel Menot, and historians Luke Wadding and Antoine Pagi. In the field of Christian art during the later Middle Ages, the Franciscan movement exercised considerable influence, especially in Italy. The influence of Franciscan ideals shows in several great painters of the 13th and 14th centuries, especially Cimabue and Giotto, who, though they were not friars, were spiritual sons of Francis in the wider sense; it is also seen in the plastic masterpieces of the latter, as well as the architectural conceptions of both himself and his school. The Italian Gothic style, whose earliest important monument is the great convent church at Assisi (built 1228‚Äì53), was cultivated as a rule principally by members of the order or men under their influence. The early spiritual poetry of Italy was partially inspired by Francis himself, who was followed by Thomas of Celano, Bonaventure, and Jacopone da Todi. Through a tradition which held him to have been a member of the Franciscan Third Order, even Dante may be included within this artistic tradition (cf. especially Paradiso, xi. 50). Other famous members of the Franciscan family include Anthony of Padua, Fran√ßois Rabelais, Alexander of Hales, Giovanni da Pian del Carpini, Pio of Pietrelcina, Maximilian Kolbe, Pasquale Sarullo, Mamerto Esqui√∫, Gabriele Allegra, Junipero Serra, Father Simpliciano of the Nativity, Mychal F. Judge, Fray Angelico Chavez, Anton Docher, Joseph of Cupertino, Benedict Groeschel and Leonard of Port Maurice. During the \\"spiritual conquest\\" of New Spain, 1523‚Äì1572, the arrival of the first group of Franciscans, the Twelve Apostles of Mexico, included Fray Mart√≠n de Valencia, but more prominently for his corpus of writings on the earliest years was Fray Toribio de Benavente Motolinia. Other important Franciscans are Fray Alonso de Molina, Fray Andres de Olmos, and Fray Bernardino de Sahag√∫n, who all created texts in indigenous language of Nahuatl to aid friars in the evangelization of Mexico. Fray Geronimo de Mendieta, Fray Augustin de Vetancourt, and Fray Juan de Torquemada are important contributors to the history of the Franciscans in central Mexico.Handbook of Middle American Indians, Vol. 13: Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources, Pt. 2.

He has been nominated for several awards, including an Academy Award for Best Actor, a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and three Golden Globe Awards for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama. Empire magazine ranked Neeson among both the \\"100 Sexiest Stars in Film History\\" and \\"The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time\\". He is one of the highest grossing actors of all time. In 1976, Neeson joined the Lyric Players' Theatre in Belfast for two years. He then acted in the Arthurian film Excalibur (1981). Between 1982 and 1987, Neeson starred in five films, most notably alongside Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins in The Bounty (1984), and Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons in The Mission (1986). He landed a leading role alongside Patrick Swayze in Next of Kin (1989). Neeson rose to prominence when he starred as Oskar Schindler in Schindler's List (1993). He has since starred in other successful films, including the drama Nell (1994), the historical biopic Michael Collins (1996), the 1998 film adaptation of Victor Hugo's Les Mis√©rables, the epic space opera Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace (1999), the biographical drama Kinsey (2004), the superhero film Batman Begins (2005), the action thriller series Taken (2008‚Äì2014), the survival film The Grey (2011), and the historical drama Silence (2016). He also provided the voices of Aslan in The Chronicles of Narnia trilogy (2005‚Äì2010) and the titular monster in A Monster Calls (2016). In 2020, he was listed at number 7 on The Irish Times list of Ireland's greatest film actors. Early life Liam John Neeson was born in Ballymena on 7 June 1952, the son of Katherine \\"Kitty\\" Neeson (n√©e Brown), a cook, and Bernard \\"Barney\\" Neeson, a caretaker at the Ballymena Boys All Saints Primary School. Raised Roman Catholic,: (Commentary;\\"Hollywood superstar Liam Neeson has told how he grew up in a religious Catholic background untouched by the Troubles.\\") he was named Liam after the local priest. The third of four siblings, he has three sisters: Elizabeth, Bernadette, and Rosaleen. Neeson said growing up as a Catholic in a predominantly Protestant town made him cautious, and once said he felt like a \\"second-class\\" citizen there, but has also said he was never made to feel \\"inferior or even different\\" at the town's predominantly Protestant technical college. Neeson has described himself as out of touch with the politics and history of Northern Ireland until becoming aware of protests by fellow students after Bloody Sunday in 1972, during the Troubles. That experience encouraged him to learn more local history. In a 2009 interview, Neeson said, \\"I never stop thinking about it [the Troubles]. I've known guys and girls who have been perpetrators of violence and victims. Protestants and Catholics. It's part of my DNA.\\" At age nine, Neeson began boxing lessons at the All Saints Youth Club, going on to win a number of regional titles before discontinuing at age 17. He acted in school productions during his teens. Neeson's interest in acting and decision to become an actor were also influenced by Ian Paisley, founder of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), into whose Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster Neeson would sneak. Neeson has said of Paisley, \\"He had a magnificent presence and it was incredible to watch him just Bible-thumping away... it was acting, but it was also great acting and stirring too.\\" In 1971, Neeson was enrolled as a physics and computer science student at Queen's University Belfast, before leaving to work for the Guinness Brewery. At Queen's, he discovered a talent for football and was spotted by Se√°n Thomas at Bohemian FC. There was a club trial in Dublin, and Neeson played one game as a substitute against Shamrock Rovers FC but was not offered a contract. Career =1976‚Äì1993: Early career = After leaving university, Neeson returned to Ballymena, where he worked in a variety of casual jobs, from a forklift operator at Guinness to a truck driver. He also attended teacher training college for two years in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, before again returning to his hometown. In 1976, Neeson joined the Lyric Players' Theatre in Belfast, where he performed for two years. He got his first film experience in 1977, playing Jesus Christ and Evangelist in the religious film Pilgrim's Progress (1978). Neeson moved to Dublin in 1978 after he was offered a part in Ron Hutchinson's Says I, Says He, a drama about The Troubles, at the Project Arts Centre. He acted in several other Project productions and joined the Abbey Theatre (the National Theatre of Ireland). In 1980, he performed alongside Stephen Rea, Ray McAnally and Mick Lally, playing Doalty in Brian Friel's play Translations, the first production of Friel's and Rea's Field Day Theatre Company, first presented in the Guildhall, Derry, on 23 September 1980. In 1980, filmmaker John Boorman saw him on stage as Lennie Small in Of Mice and Men and offered him the role of Sir Gawain in the Arthurian film Excalibur. After Excalibur, Neeson moved to London, where he continued working on stage, in small budget films and in television. He lived with the actress Helen Mirren at this time, whom he met working on Excalibur. Between 1982 and 1987, Neeson starred in five films, most notably alongside Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins in 1984's The Bounty and Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons in 1986's The Mission. Neeson guest-starred in the third season of the television series Miami Vice in 1986 and moved to Hollywood to star in more high-profile roles in the next year. That year, he starred alongside Cher and Dennis Quaid in Suspect, a role that brought him critical acclaim. In 1988, he starred alongside Clint Eastwood in the fifth Dirty Harry film, \\"The Dead Pool\\", in the role of Peter Swan, a horror film director. In 1990, he followed this with a starring role in Sam Raimi's Darkman. Although the film was successful, Neeson's subsequent years did not bring him the same recognition. In 1993, he joined Ellis Island co-star and future wife Natasha Richardson in the Broadway play Anna Christie. They also worked together in Nell, released the following year. =1993‚Äì2000: Rise to prominence = Director Steven Spielberg offered Neeson the role of Oskar Schindler in his film about the Holocaust, Schindler's List, after seeing him in Anna Christie on Broadway. Kevin Costner, Mel Gibson and Warren Beatty all expressed interest in portraying Schindler, (the last auditioning), but Neeson was cast in December 1992 after formally auditioning for the role. Neeson read the Keneally book and concluded that his character \\"enjoyed fookin' with the Nazis. In Keneally's book, it says he was regarded as a kind of a buffoon by them... if the Nazis were New Yorkers, he was from Arkansas. They don't quite take him seriously, and he used that to full effect.\\" His critically acclaimed performance earned him a nomination for a Best Actor Oscar, and helped the film earn Best Picture of 1993. (The best actor award went to Tom Hanks for his performance in Philadelphia.) Neeson also garnered BAFTA and Golden Globes nominations for his performance as Schindler. Soon after these accolades, Neeson became an in-demand leading actor. He starred in the subsequent period pieces Rob Roy (1995) and Michael Collins (1996), the latter earning him a win for Best Starring Role at the Venice Film Festival and another Golden Globe nomination. He went on to star as Jean Valjean in the 1998 adaptation of Victor Hugo's Les Mis√©rables and in The Haunting (1999) as Dr. David Marrow. In 1999, Neeson starred as Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace. Director George Lucas cast Neeson in the role because he considered him a \\"master actor, who the other actors will look up to, who has got the qualities of strength that the character demands.\\" As the first Star Wars film to be released in 16 years, it was surrounded by a large amount of media anticipation. Neeson's connection to Star Wars started in the Crown Bar, Belfast. He told Ricki Lake, \\"I probably wouldn't have taken the role if it wasn't for the advice of Peter King in the Crown during a Lyric reunion.\\" Despite mixed reviews from critics and fans, The Phantom Menace was an enormous box-office success and remained the most financially successful Star Wars film unadjusted for inflation until Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). Neeson's performance as Qui-Gon received positive reviews and a Saturn Award nomination. A stock recording of his voice from The Phantom Menace can be heard during a scene in Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones (2002). Neeson was later reported to be appearing in Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith (2005), but ultimately did not. In the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008‚Äì14), Neeson reprised the role of Qui-Gon by voicing the character in two episodes of the third season and one episode of the sixth season. He recently made a voice cameo as Qui-Gon in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019), among other veteran Star Wars actors. =2001‚Äì2007: Mainstream roles = Neeson and Ralph Fiennes at a U2 concert in Madison Square Garden, October 2005 Neeson narrated the 2001 documentaries Journey into Amazing Caves, a short film about two scientists who travel around the world to search for material for potential cures, and The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Adventure. The latter won awards at a number of film festivals including Best Documentary from both the Chicago Film Critics Association and the National Board of Review. After being nominated for a Tony Award for his role opposite Laura Linney in The Crucible, Neeson appeared with Harrison Ford in Kathryn Bigelow's 2002 submarine thriller K-19: The Widowmaker as Captain Mikhail Polenin. He was also on the cast of Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York with Leonardo DiCaprio, Brendan Gleeson, Cameron Diaz and Daniel Day-Lewis, and played a recently widowed writer in Richard Curtis's ensemble comedy Love Actually (2003). His role as Alfred Kinsey in Kinsey again put Neeson up for nomination for a Golden Globe Award, but he lost to Leonardo DiCaprio for The Aviator. In 2004, Neeson hosted an episode of the NBC sketch show Saturday Night Live. He starred as a redneck trucker, Marlon Weaver, in an \\"Appalachian Emergency Room\\" sketch and as a hippie in a one-off sketch about two stoners (the other played by Amy Poehler) who attempt to borrow a police dog to find their lost stash of marijuana. Despite vowing not to play any Irish stereotypes, Neeson did play a stereotypically Irish man named Lorcan McArdle in the home makeover show parody \\"You Call This A House, Do Ya?\\" In 2005, Neeson played Godfrey of Ibelin in Ridley Scott's epic adventure Kingdom of Heaven; Ra's al Ghul, one of the main villains in Batman Begins; and Father Bernard in Neil Jordan's adaptation of Patrick McCabe's novel Breakfast on Pluto. In The Simpsons episode \\"The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star\\" (2005), he voiced the kindly priest who (briefly) converts Bart and Homer to Catholicism. That same year, he gave his voice to the lion Aslan in the blockbuster fantasy film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. In 2007, he starred in the American Civil War epic Seraphim Falls. Neeson voiced the main character's father, James, in the video game Fallout 3. Executive producer Todd Howard said, \\"This role was written with Liam in mind, and provides the dramatic tone for the entire game\\". Fallout 3, the third game in the Fallout series, was extremely well received by critics and shipped 4.7 million copies by the end of 2008, the year it was released. In the director's commentary of the 2007 Transformers DVD, Michael Bay said he had told the animators to seek inspiration from Neeson in creating Optimus Prime's body language. Neeson appeared as Alistair Little in the BBC Northern Ireland/Big Fish Films television drama Five Minutes of Heaven, which tells the true story of a young Protestant man convicted of murdering a Catholic boy during The Troubles. =2008‚Äìpresent: Later success = Neeson attending the premiere of The Other Man, September 2008 In 2008, Neeson starred in the action film Taken, a French-produced film also starring Famke Janssen and Maggie Grace, based on a script by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen and directed by Pierre Morel. Neeson plays a retired CIA operative from the elite Special Activities Division who sets about tracking down his teenage daughter after she is kidnapped. Taken was a worldwide box office hit, grossing $223.9 million worldwide, making almost $200 million more than its production budget. Neeson has said in interviews that he believed that Taken had put some people off the idea of actually travelling to Europe. Taken brought Neeson back into the center of the public eye and resulted in his being cast in many more big-budget Hollywood movies. That year he also narrated the documentary Black Holes: The Other Side of Infinity and again lent his voice to Aslan in The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008). He also provided a voice for Hayao Miyazaki's anime film Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea, which received an August 2009 release. In 2010, Neeson played Zeus in the remake of the 1981 film, Clash of the Titans. The film was a huge box- office hit, grossing $475 million worldwide. Neeson also starred in Atom Egoyan's erotic thriller Chloe, theatrically released by Sony Pictures Classics on 26 March 2010. Chloe had enjoyed commercial success and became the Canadian director's biggest money maker ever. Later the same year, he played John \\"Hannibal\\" Smith in the spin-off movie from the television series The A-Team. Neeson continued to voice Aslan in the sequel The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (2010). In 2011, Neeson starred in the action-thriller Unknown, a German-British-American co-production of a French book filmed in Berlin in early 2010, and directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. This film led to a collaboration between Neeson and Collet-Serra on a series of similar action films including Non-Stop (2014), Run All Night (2015) and The Commuter (2018). Neeson reunited with Steven Spielberg with plans to star as Abraham Lincoln in the 2012 film Lincoln, based on the book Team of Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin. In preparation for the role, Neeson visited the District of Columbia and Springfield, Illinois, where Lincoln lived before being elected, and read Lincoln's personal letters. Neeson eventually declined the role, claiming he was \\"past his sell date\\" and had grown too old to play Lincoln. He was replaced by Daniel Day-Lewis. Deauville Film Festival, 2012. It was announced in July 2010 that Neeson would guest-star on the new Showtime series The Big C. In 2011, he played himself in BBC2's series Life's Too Short. In late 2011, Neeson was cast to play the lead character, a journalist, in a new album recording and arena production of Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds. He replaced Richard Burton, who had posthumously appeared in the arena production through CGI animation. Neeson did not physically appear on the stage, instead playing the role through the use of 3D holography. In 2012, Neeson starred in Joe Carnahan's The Grey. The film received mostly positive reviews and Neeson's performance received critical acclaim. He also starred in Taken 2, a successful sequel to his 2008 blockbuster. That year, he once again played Ra's al Ghul in The Dark Knight Rises, the third and final film in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy. He narrated the first trailer for the film. On 31 January 2014, it was reported that Neeson would work with director Martin Scorsese again in an adaptation of the novel Silence. Neeson had a supporting role as the henchman Bad Cop/Good Cop in the animated film The Lego Movie, which was a critical and commercial success. Neeson later played Bill Marks in the 2014 action film Non-Stop. The film was released on 28 February 2014. He also appeared, uncredited, as God in the BBC2 series Rev.. Neeson stars in the 2014 film A Walk Among the Tombstones, an adaption of the best-selling novel of the same name, in which he plays former cop Matthew Scudder, a detective hired to hunt the killers of a drug dealer's wife. During Super Bowl XLIX, Supercell did a Clash of Clans commercial with Neeson playing the game as \\"AngryNeeson52\\" and vowing revenge on his opponent \\"BigBuffetBoy85\\" while waiting for his scone at a bakery. The appearance was a parody of his role in Taken. In 2016, Neeson narrated the RT√â One three-part documentary on the Easter Rising, 1916. In 2016, he voiced the Monster in the Spanish film A Monster Calls. Politics Neeson opposes what he sees as the unrestricted right to own firearms in the United States and has made calls for gun control. In January 2015, he repeated his views, calling US gun laws a \\"disgrace\\" in an interview with Emirati newspaper Gulf News when replying to a question about the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris earlier that month. In response, U.S gun manufacturer Para USA, which provided the weapons used by Neeson in the Taken film series, expressed regret at working with him, saying: \\"We will no longer provide firearms for use in films starring Liam Neeson and ask that our friends and partners in Hollywood refrain from associating our brand and products with his projects.\\" In 2014, he protested against the anti- carriage horse campaign of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said he would outlaw horse-drawn carriages in Central Park once he took office. Neeson wrote an opinion page published in The New York Times citing the carriage trade as a safe one for employees, horses and tourists and noted it was a livelihood for many immigrants. Neeson narrated a video for Amnesty International in favour of the legalisation of abortion in Ireland, which some conservative and pro-life commentators criticised, calling it \\"creepy\\" and \\"anti-Catholic\\". During the Brexit campaign, Liam Neeson revealed his opposition to the British exit from the European Union, claiming that an exit would be truly \\"a shame to sacrifice all the progress that has been made by the peace process regarding border controls.\\" In September 2017, Liam Neeson compared the presidency of Donald Trump to the Watergate scandal of Richard Nixon, saying: \\"Democracy works and no man‚Äîand certainly not the President‚Äîis above the law. He has to be accountable.\\" In January 2018, Neeson raised concerns over the Me Too movement on Ireland's The Late Late Show, describing the movement as a \\"witch hunt\\", and citing Garrison Keillor's dismissal from Minnesota Public Radio. In February 2019, Neeson gained public and media controversy after a press junket interview he had conducted with The Independent, while promoting his film Cold Pursuit, about a father seeking revenge for his son's murder. Neeson explained his character's \\"primal\\" anger by recounting an experience he had 40 years ago. A woman close to him had been raped by a stranger. After learning the attacker was black, Neeson said that for about a week, he \\"went up and down areas with a cosh ... hoping some 'black bastard' would come out of a pub and have a go\\" so that Neeson \\"could kill him\\". In the interview, Neeson also said he was ashamed to recount the experience and that it was \\"horrible\\" that he did what he did. \\"It's awful ... but I did learn a lesson from it, when I eventually thought, 'What the fuck are you doing?'\\" In an appearance on Good Morning America, Neeson elaborated on his experience while denying being a racist, saying the incident occurred nearly 40 years ago, that he asked for physical attributes of the rapist other than race, that he would have done the same if the rapist was \\"a Scot or a Brit or a Lithuanian\\", that he had purposely gone into \\"black areas of the city\\", and that he \\"did seek help\\" and counseling from a priest, as well as friends after coming to his senses. Neeson said that the lesson of his experience was \\"to open up, to talk about these things\\", including toxic masculinity, and underlying \\"racism and bigotry\\" in both the United States and Northern Ireland. The controversy Neeson's comments caused led to the cancellation of the red carpet event for the premiere of Cold Pursuit. Trevor Noah defended Neeson, calling it a \\"powerful admission\\", elaborating saying, \\"I want to live in a world where a person who said something like that is ashamed of it and they are telling it to you and you aren't catching them out\\". Michelle Rodriguez, Whoopi Goldberg, and Ralph Fiennes have also defended Neeson. Personal life Neeson lived with actress Helen Mirren during the early 1980s. They met while working on Excalibur (1981). Interviewed by James Lipton for Inside the Actors Studio, Neeson said Mirren was instrumental in his getting an agent. Neeson met actress Natasha Richardson while performing in a revival of the play Anna Christie on Broadway in 1993. They were married on 3 July 1994 and had two sons together. In October 1998, they won ¬£50,000 ($85,370) in libel damages after the Daily Mirror wrongly claimed that their marriage was suffering. They donated the money to victims of the August 1998 Omagh bombing. In August 2004, they purchased an estate in Millbrook, New York. On 18 March 2009, Richardson died when she suffered a severe head injury in a skiing accident at the Mont Tremblant Resort, northwest of Montreal. Neeson donated her organs following her death. Neeson holds British, Irish and American citizenship, having been naturalised as an American citizen in 2009. In 2009, nearly four decades after he was an undergraduate in physics and computer science at Queen's University, Belfast, Neeson was awarded an honorary doctorate. It was presented to him in New York by Vice-Chancellor Professor Peter Gregson. In March 2011, he was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF. Neeson is a patron of Belfast- based charity and film festival CineMagic, which encourages and helps young people to get involved in the movie industry. A heavy smoker earlier in his career, Neeson quit smoking in 2003 while working on Love Actually. When he took the role of Hannibal for the 2010 film adaptation of The A-Team, Neeson had reservations about smoking cigars (a signature trait of the character) in the film due to being an ex-smoker, but agreed to keep that trait intact for the film. In June 2012, Neeson's publicist denied reports that Neeson was converting to Islam. Neeson has expressed an affection for the adhan, the Islamic call to prayer, that he grew accustomed to while filming Taken 2 in Istanbul: \\"By the third week, it was like I couldn't live without it. It really became hypnotic and very moving for me in a very special way. Very beautiful.\\" He also expressed admiration for the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. His mother Kitty died in June 2020, but because of travel restrictions due to COVID-19, he was unable to travel to Ballymena for the funeral.\\"Funeral of Liam Neeson's mother held in Ballymena\\" Belfast Telegraph Honours and awards In the year 2000, Neeson was offered the \\"Freedom of the Town of Ballymena\\" by the Ballymena Borough Council, but because of objections made by members of the Democratic Unionist Party regarding his comments that he had felt like a \\"second-class citizen\\" growing up as a Catholic in the town, he declined the award, citing tensions. Following the controversy, Neeson wrote a letter to the council, stating; \\"I will always remain very proud of my upbringing in, and association with, the town and my country of birth, which I will continue to promote at every opportunity. Indeed, I regard the enduring support over the years from all sections of the community in Ballymena as being more than sufficient recognition for any success which I may have achieved as an actor.\\" Subsequently, on 28 January 2013, Neeson received the Freedom of the Borough from Ballymena Borough Council at a ceremony in the town. Neeson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in her 2000 New Year Honours. The American Ireland Fund honoured Neeson with their Performing Arts Award for the great distinction he has brought to Ireland at their 2008 Dinner Gala in New York City. In 2009, at a ceremony in New York, Neeson was awarded an honorary doctorate by Queen's University, Belfast. On 9 April 2016, he was honoured with the Outstanding Contribution to Cinema Award by the Irish Film and Television Academy (IFTA) at the Mansion House, Dublin, with Irish President Michael D. Higgins presenting the award. In 2017, Neeson was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 74 in the list of 200 Most Influential Philanthropists and Social Entrepreneurs Worldwide. In January 2018, he was awarded the Distinguished Service for the Irish Abroad Award by Irish President Michael D. Higgins, who described it as an award \\"for Irish people abroad who are making a contribution to humanity\\".

Dahl was a professor of computer science at the University of Oslo and is considered to be one of the fathers of Simula and object-oriented programming along with Kristen Nygaard.  Career  Dahl was born in Mandal, Norway. He was the son of Finn Dahl (1898‚Äì1962) and Ingrid Othilie Kathinka Pedersen (1905‚Äì80). When he was seven, his family moved to Drammen. When he was thirteen, the whole family fled to Sweden during the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. After the end of the war, Dahl studied numerical mathematics at the University of Oslo. Dahl became a full professor at the University of Oslo in 1968 and was a gifted teacher as well as researcher. Here he worked on Hierarchical Program Structures, probably his most influential publication, which appeared co-authored with C.A.R. Hoare in the influential book Structured Programming of 1972 by Dahl, Edsger Dijkstra and Hoare, perhaps the best-known academic book concerning software in the 1970s. As his career progressed, Dahl became increasingly interested in the use of formal methods, to rigorously reason about object-orientation for example. His expertise ranged from the practical application of ideas to their formal mathematical underpinning to ensure the validity of the approach. Dahl is widely accepted as Norway's foremost computer scientist. With Kristen Nygaard, he produced the initial ideas for object-oriented (OO) programming in the 1960s at the Norwegian Computing Center (NR) as part of the Simula I (1961‚Äì1965) and Simula 67 (1965‚Äì1968) simulation programming languages. Dahl and Nygaard were the first to develop the concepts of class, subclass (allowing implicit information hiding), inheritance, dynamic object creation, etc., all important aspects of the OO paradigm. An object is a self-contained component (with a data structure and associated procedures or methods) in a software system. These are combined to form a complete system. The object-oriented approach is now pervasive in modern software development, including widely used imperative programming languages such as Java and C++. He received the Turing Award for his work in 2001 (with Kristen Nygaard). He received the 2002 IEEE John von Neumann Medal (with Kristen Nygaard)Recipients IEEE John von Neumann Medal and was named Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 2000.

Bloodletting, whether by a physician or by leeches, was based on an ancient system of medicine in which blood and other bodily fluids were regarded as \\"humours\\" that had to remain in proper balance to maintain health. It is claimed to have been the most common medical practice performed by surgeons from antiquity until the late 19th century, a span of over 2,000 years. In Europe the practice continued to be relatively common until the end of the 18th century.B.) Anderson, Julie, Emm Barnes, and Enna Shackleton. \\"The Art of Medicine: Over 2,000 Years of Images and Imagination [Hardcover].\\" The Art of Medicine: Over 2, 000 Years of Images and Imagination: Julie Anderson, Emm Barnes, Emma Shackleton: : The Ilex Press Limited, 2013. The practice has now been abandoned by modern-style medicine for all except a few very specific medical conditions. It is conceivable that historically, in the absence of other treatments for hypertension, bloodletting sometimes had a beneficial effect in temporarily reducing blood pressure by reducing blood volume. However, since hypertension is very often asymptomatic and thus undiagnosable without modern methods, this effect was unintentional. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the historical use of bloodletting was harmful to patients. Today, the term phlebotomy refers to the drawing of blood for laboratory analysis or blood transfusion. Therapeutic phlebotomy refers to the drawing of a unit of blood in specific cases like hemochromatosis, polycythemia vera, porphyria cutanea tarda, etc., to reduce the number of red blood cells. The traditional medical practice of bloodletting is today considered to be a pseudoscience. In the ancient world A chart showing the parts of the body to be bled for different diseases, c. 1310‚Äì20 Hans von Gersdorff, Field book of wound medicine, 1517 Passages from the Ebers Papyrus may indicate that bloodletting by scarification was an accepted practice in Ancient Egypt. Egyptian burials have been reported to contain bloodletting instruments. According to some accounts, the Egyptians based the idea on their observations of the Hippopotamus, confusing its red sweat with blood, and believing that it scratched itself to relieve distress. In Greece, bloodletting was in use in the fifth century BC during the lifetime of Hippocrates, who mentions this practice but generally relied on dietary techniques. Erasistratus, however, theorized that many diseases were caused by plethoras, or overabundances, in the blood and advised that these plethoras be treated, initially, by exercise, sweating, reduced food intake, and vomiting. Herophilus advocated bloodletting. Archagathus, one of the first Greek physicians to practice in Rome, also believed in the value of bloodletting. \\"Bleeding\\" a patient to health was modeled on the process of menstruation. Hippocrates believed that menstruation functioned to \\"purge women of bad humours\\". During the Roman Empire, the Greek physician Galen, who subscribed to the teachings of Hippocrates, advocated physician-initiated bloodletting. The popularity of bloodletting in the classical Mediterranean world was reinforced by the ideas of Galen, after he discovered that not only veins but also arteries were filled with blood, not air as was commonly believed at the time. There were two key concepts in his system of bloodletting. The first was that blood was created and then used up; it did not circulate, and so it could \\"stagnate\\" in the extremities. The second was that humoral balance was the basis of illness or health, the four humours being blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile, relating to the four Greek classical elements of air, water, earth, and fire respectively. Galen believed that blood was the dominant humour and the one in most need of control. In order to balance the humours, a physician would either remove \\"excess\\" blood (plethora) from the patient or give them an emetic to induce vomiting, or a diuretic to induce urination. Galen created a complex system of how much blood should be removed based on the patient's age, constitution, the season, the weather and the place. \\"Do-it-yourself\\" bleeding instructions following these systems were developed. Symptoms of plethora were believed to include fever, apoplexy, and headache. The blood to be let was of a specific nature determined by the disease: either arterial or venous, and distant or close to the area of the body affected. He linked different blood vessels with different organs, according to their supposed drainage. For example, the vein in the right hand would be let for liver problems and the vein in the left hand for problems with the spleen. The more severe the disease, the more blood would be let. Fevers required copious amounts of bloodletting.  Middle Ages  The Talmud recommended a specific day of the week and days of the month for bloodletting, and similar rules, though less codified, can be found among Christian writings advising which saints' days were favourable for bloodletting. During medieval times bleeding charts were common, showing specific bleeding sites on the body in alignment with the planets and zodiacs. Islamic medical authors also advised bloodletting, particularly for fevers. It was practised according to seasons and certain phases of the moon in the lunar calendar. The practice was probably passed by the Greeks with the translation of ancient texts to Arabic and is different than bloodletting by cupping mentioned in the traditions of Muhammad. When Muslim theories became known in the Latin-speaking countries of Europe, bloodletting became more widespread. Together with cautery, it was central to Arabic surgery; the key texts Kitab al-Qanun and especially Al-Tasrif li-man 'ajaza 'an al-ta'lif both recommended it. It was also known in Ayurvedic medicine, described in the Susruta Samhita. Use through the 19th century Ioannis Sculteti, Armamentium Chirugiae, 1693 ‚Äì Diagrammed transfusion of sheep's blood A barber surgeon's bloodletting set, beginning of the 19th century, M√§rkisches Museum Berlin Even after the humoral system fell into disuse, the practice was continued by surgeons and barber-surgeons. Though the bloodletting was often recommended by physicians, it was carried out by barbers. This led to the distinction between physicians and surgeons. The red-and-white-striped pole of the barbershop, still in use today, is derived from this practice: the red symbolizes blood while the white symbolizes the bandages. Bloodletting was used to \\"treat\\" a wide range of diseases, becoming a standard treatment for almost every ailment, and was practiced prophylactically as well as therapeutically. Scarificator Scarificator mechanism Scarificator, showing depth adjustment bar Diagram of scarificator, showing depth adjustment A number of different methods were employed. The most common was phlebotomy, or venesection (often called \\"breathing a vein\\"), in which blood was drawn from one or more of the larger external veins, such as those in the forearm or neck. In arteriotomy, an artery was punctured, although generally only in the temples. In scarification (not to be confused with scarification, a method of body modification), the \\"superficial\\" vessels were attacked, often using a syringe, a spring-loaded lancet, or a glass cup that contained heated air, producing a vacuum within (see fire cupping). There was also a specific bloodletting tool called a scarificator, used primarily in 19th century medicine. It has a spring-loaded mechanism with gears that snaps the blades out through slits in the front cover and back in, in a circular motion. The case is cast brass, and the mechanism and blades steel. One knife bar gear has slipped teeth, turning the blades in a different direction than those on the other bars. The last photo and the diagram show the depth adjustment bar at the back and sides. Leeches could also be used. The withdrawal of so much blood as to induce syncope (fainting) was considered beneficial, and many sessions would only end when the patient began to swoon. William Harvey disproved the basis of the practice in 1628, and the introduction of scientific medicine, la m√©thode num√©rique, allowed Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis to demonstrate that phlebotomy was entirely ineffective in the treatment of pneumonia and various fevers in the 1830s. Nevertheless, in 1838, a lecturer at the Royal College of Physicians would still state that \\"blood-letting is a remedy which, when judiciously employed, it is hardly possible to estimate too highly\\", and Louis was dogged by the sanguinary Broussais, who could recommend leeches fifty at a time. Some physicians resisted Louis' work because they \\"were not prepared to discard therapies 'validated by both tradition and their own experience on account of somebody else's numbers'.\\" Bloodletting was used to treat almost every disease. One British medical text recommended bloodletting for acne, asthma, cancer, cholera, coma, convulsions, diabetes, epilepsy, gangrene, gout, herpes, indigestion, insanity, jaundice, leprosy, ophthalmia, plague, pneumonia, scurvy, smallpox, stroke, tetanus, tuberculosis, and for some one hundred other diseases. Bloodletting was even used to treat most forms of hemorrhaging such as nosebleed, excessive menstruation, or hemorrhoidal bleeding. Before surgery or at the onset of childbirth, blood was removed to prevent inflammation. Before amputation, it was customary to remove a quantity of blood equal to the amount believed to circulate in the limb that was to be removed.Carter (2005) p. 6 There were also theories that bloodletting would cure \\"heartsickness\\" and \\"heartbreak\\". A French physician, Jacques Ferrand wrote a book in 1623 on the uses of bloodletting to cure a broken heart. He recommended bloodletting to the point of heart failure (literal).Lydia Kang MD & Nate Pederson, Quackery: A Brief History of the Worst Ways to Cure Everything \\"Bleed Yourself to Bliss\\" (Workman Publishing Company; 2017) Leeches became especially popular in the early nineteenth century. In the 1830s, the French imported about forty million leeches a year for medical purposes, and in the next decade, England imported six million leeches a year from France alone. Through the early decades of the century, hundreds of millions of leeches were used by physicians throughout Europe.Carter (2005) p. 7 One typical course of medical treatment began the morning of 13 July 1824. A French sergeant was stabbed through the chest while engaged in single combat; within minutes, he fainted from loss of blood. Arriving at the local hospital he was immediately bled twenty ounces (570 ml) \\"to prevent inflammation\\". During the night he was bled another 24 ounces (680 ml). Early the next morning, the chief surgeon bled the patient another 10 ounces (285 ml); during the next 14 hours, he was bled five more times. Medical attendants thus intentionally removed more than half of the patient's normal blood supply‚Äîin addition to the initial blood loss which caused the sergeant to faint. Bleedings continued over the next several days. By 29 July, the wound had become inflamed. The physician applied 32 leeches to the most sensitive part of the wound. Over the next three days, there were more bleedings and a total of 40 more leeches. The sergeant recovered and was discharged on 3 October. His physician wrote that \\"by the large quantity of blood lost, amounting to 170 ounces [nearly eleven pints] (4.8 liters), besides that drawn by the application of leeches [perhaps another two pints] (1.1 liters), the life of the patient was preserved\\". By nineteenth-century standards, thirteen pints of blood taken over the space of a month was a large but not an exceptional quantity. The medical literature of the period contains many similar accounts- some successful, some not.During the Yellow Fever this practice was also used by Dr. Rush. Read the book Fever 1793 for more info of look up Yellow Fever or Dr. Ben Rush quoted in Carter (2005):7‚Äì8 Bloodletting was also popular in the young United States of America, where Benjamin Rush (a signatory of the Declaration of Independence) saw the state of the arteries as the key to disease, recommending levels of bloodletting that were high even for the time. George Washington asked to be bled heavily after he developed a throat infection from weather exposure. Within a ten-hour period, a total of 124‚Äì126 ounces (3.75 liters) of blood was withdrawn prior to his death from a throat infection in 1799.The Permanente Journal Volume 8 No. 2: The asphyxiating and exsanguinating death of president george washington, p. 79, Spring, 2004, retrieved on November 11, 2012 Bloodsticks for use when bleeding animals One reason for the continued popularity of bloodletting (and purging) was that, while anatomical knowledge, surgical and diagnostic skills increased tremendously in Europe from the 17th century, the key to curing disease remained elusive, and the underlying belief was that it was better to give any treatment than nothing at all. The psychological benefit of bloodletting to the patient (a placebo effect) may sometimes have outweighed the physiological problems it caused. Bloodletting slowly lost favour during the 19th century, after French physician Dr. Pierre Louis conducted an experiment in which he studied the effect of bloodletting on pneumonia patients. A number of other ineffective or harmful treatments were available as placebos‚Äîmesmerism, various processes involving the new technology of electricity, many potions, tonics, and elixirs. Yet, bloodletting persisted during the 19th century partly because it was readily available to people of any socioeconomic status. Controversy and use into the 20th century Bloodletting gradually declined in popularity over the course of the 19th century, becoming rather uncommon in most places, before its validity was thoroughly debated. In the medical community of Edinburgh, bloodletting was abandoned in practice before it was challenged in theory, a contradiction highlighted by physician-physiologist John Hughes Bennett. Authorities such as Austin Flint I, Hiram Corson, and William Osler became prominent supporters of bloodletting in the 1880s and onwards, disputing Bennett's premise that bloodletting had fallen into disuse because it did not work. These advocates framed bloodletting as an orthodox medical practice, to be used in spite of its general unpopularity. Some physicians considered bloodletting useful for a more limited range of purposes, such as to \\"clear out\\" infected or weakened blood or its ability to \\"cause h√¶morrhages to cease\\"‚Äîas evidenced in a call for a \\"fair trial for blood-letting as a remedy\\" in 1871. Some researchers used statistical methods for evaluating treatment effectiveness to discourage bloodletting. But at the same time, publications by Philip Pye-Smith and others defended bloodletting on scientific grounds. Bloodletting persisted into the 20th century and was recommended in the 1923 edition of the textbook The Principles and Practice of Medicine. The textbook was originally written by Sir William Osler and continued to be published in new editions under new authors following Osler's death in 1919. Phlebotomy Bloodletting is used today in the treatment of a few diseases, including hemochromatosis and polycythemia; however, these rare diseases were unknown and undiagnosable before the advent of scientific medicine. It is practiced by specifically trained practitioners in hospitals, using modern techniques, and is also known as a therapeutic phlebotomy. In most cases, phlebotomy now refers to the removal of small quantities of blood for diagnostic purposes. However, in the case of hemochromatosis, bloodletting (by venipuncture) has become the mainstay treatment option. In the U.S., according to an academic article posted in the Journal of Infusion Nursing with data published in 2010, the primary use of phlebotomy was to take blood that would one day be reinfused back into a person. In alternative medicine Though bloodletting as a general health measure has been shown to be pseudoscience, it is still commonly indicated for a wide variety of conditions in the Ayurvedic, Unani, and traditional Chinese systems of alternative medicine.Unani System of Medicine Practice, Globinmed.com.Ayurveda ‚Äì Panchakarma , holistic- online.com.Ayurveda, Cancer.org.Bleeding Peripheral Points: An Acupuncture TechniqueTreating Herpes Zoster (Shingles) with Bloodletting Therapy: Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine Unani is based on a form of humorism, and so in that system, bloodletting is used to correct supposed humoral imbalance.

It follows a crew of scientists on a research station as they attempt to understand an extraterrestrial intelligence, which takes the form of a vast ocean on the titular alien planet. The novel is among Lem's best- known works.Ben√©t‚Äôs Reader‚Äôs Encyclopedia, fourth edition (1996), p. 590. The book has been adapted numerous times for film, radio, and theater. Prominent film adaptations include Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 version and Steven Soderbergh's 2002 version, although Lem later remarked that none of these films reflected the book's thematic emphasis on the limitations of human rationality. Plot summary Solaris chronicles the ultimate futility of attempted communications with the extraterrestrial life inhabiting a distant alien planet named Solaris. The planet is almost completely covered with an ocean of gel that is revealed to be a single, planet-encompassing entity. Terran scientists conjecture it is a living and a sentient being, and attempt to communicate with it. Kris Kelvin, a psychologist, arrives aboard Solaris Station, a scientific research station hovering near the oceanic surface of Solaris. The scientists there have studied the planet and its ocean for many decades, mostly in vain. A scientific discipline known as Solaristics has degenerated over the years to simply observing, recording and categorizing the complex phenomena that occur upon the surface of the ocean. Thus far, the scientists have only compiled an elaborate nomenclature of the phenomena, and do not yet understand what such activities really mean. Shortly before Kelvin's arrival, the crew exposed the ocean to a more aggressive and unauthorized experimentation with a high-energy X-ray bombardment. Their experimentation gives unexpected results and becomes psychologically traumatic for them as individually flawed humans. The ocean's response to this intrusion exposes the deeper, hidden aspects of the personalities of the human scientists, while revealing nothing of the ocean's nature itself. It does this by materializing physical simulacra, including human ones; Kelvin confronts memories of his dead lover and guilt about her suicide. The \\"guests\\" of the other researchers are only alluded to. All human efforts to make sense of Solaris's activities prove futile. As Lem wrote, \\"The peculiarity of those phenomena seems to suggest that we observe a kind of rational activity, but the meaning of this seemingly rational activity of the Solarian Ocean is beyond the reach of human beings.\\"Stanis≈Çaw Lem, Fantastyka i Futuriologia, Wydawnictwo Literackie, 1989, vol. 2, p. 365 He also wrote that he deliberately chose to make the sentient alien an ocean to avoid any personification and the pitfalls of anthropomorphism in depicting first contact. Characters *The protagonist, Dr. Kris Kelvin, is a psychologist recently arrived from Earth to the space station studying the planet Solaris. He had previously been cohabiting with Harey (\\"Rheya\\" in the Kilmartin‚ÄìCox translation), who committed suicide when he abandoned their relationship. Her exact double is his visitor aboard the space station and becomes an important character. *Snaut (\\"Snow\\" in the Kilmartin‚ÄìCox translation) is the first person Kelvin meets aboard the station, and his visitor is not shown. *Gibarian, who had been an instructor of Kelvin's at university, commits suicide just hours before Kelvin arrives at the station. Gibarian's visitor was a \\"giant Negress\\" who twice appears to Kelvin; first in a hallway soon after his arrival, and then while he is examining Gibarian's cadaver. She seems to be unaware of the other humans she meets, or she simply chooses to ignore them. *The last inhabitant Kelvin meets is Sartorius, the most reclusive member of the crew. He shows up only intermittently and is always suspicious of the other crew members. His visitor remains anonymous; Kelvin only gets a glimpse of a straw hat. *Harey (\\"Rheya\\" in the Kilmartin‚ÄìCox translation, an anagram of Harey), who killed herself with a lethal injection after quarreling with Kelvin, returns as his visitor. Overwhelmed with conflicting emotions after confronting her, Kelvin lures the first Harey visitor into a shuttle and launches it into outer space to be rid of her. Her fate is unknown to the other scientists. Snaut suggests hailing Harey's shuttle to learn her condition, but Kelvin objects. Harey soon reappears but with no memory of the shuttle incident. Moreover, the second Harey becomes aware of her transient nature and is haunted by being Solaris' means-to-an- end, affecting Kelvin in unknown ways. After listening to a tape recording by Gibarian, and so learning her true nature, she attempts suicide by drinking liquid oxygen. This fails because her body is made of neutrinos, stabilized by some unknown force field, and has both incredible strength and the ability to quickly regenerate from all injuries. She subsequently convinces Snaut to destroy her with a device developed by Sartorius that disrupts the subatomic structure of the visitors. Criticism and interpretations In an interview, Lem said that the novel \\"has always been a juicy prey for critics\\", with interpretations ranging from that of Freudism to anticommunism, the latter stating that the Ocean represents the USSR and the people on the space station represent the Soviet satellites. He also commented on the absurdity of the book cover blurb for the 1976 edition, which said the novel \\"expressed the humanistic beliefs of the author about high moral qualities of the human\\".Lem's FAQ Lem noted that the critic who promulgated the Freudian idea actually blundered by basing his psychoanalysis on dialogue from the English translation, whereas his diagnosis would fail on the idioms in the original Polish text.Lem's commentary on Solaris.

The size of helium atoms relative to their spacing is shown to scale under 1950 atmospheres of pressure. The atoms have a certain, average speed, slowed down here two trillion fold from room temperature. The kinetic theory of gases is a historically significant, but simple, model of the thermodynamic behavior of gases, with which many principal concepts of thermodynamics were established. The model describes a gas as a large number of identical submicroscopic particles (atoms or molecules), all of which are in constant, rapid, random motion. Their size is assumed to be much smaller than the average distance between the particles. The particles undergo random elastic collisions between themselves and with the enclosing walls of the container. The basic version of the model describes the ideal gas, and considers no other interactions between the particles and, thus, the nature of kinetic energy transfers during collisions is strictly thermal. The kinetic theory of gases explains the macroscopic properties of gases, such as volume, pressure, and temperature, as well as transport properties such as viscosity, thermal conductivity and mass diffusivity. The model also accounts for related phenomena, such as Brownian motion. History In approximately 50 BCE, the Roman philosopher Lucretius proposed that apparently static macroscopic bodies were composed on a small scale of rapidly moving atoms all bouncing off each other. This Epicurean atomistic point of view was rarely considered in the subsequent centuries, when Aristotlean ideas were dominant. Hydrodynamica front cover In 1738 Daniel Bernoulli published Hydrodynamica, which laid the basis for the kinetic theory of gases. In this work, Bernoulli posited the argument, still used to this day, that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the gas pressure that we feel, and that what we experience as heat is simply the kinetic energy of their motion. The theory was not immediately accepted, in part because conservation of energy had not yet been established, and it was not obvious to physicists how the collisions between molecules could be perfectly elastic. Other pioneers of the kinetic theory (whose work was largely neglected by their contemporaries) were Mikhail Lomonosov (1747),Lomonosov 1758 Georges- Louis Le Sage (ca. 1780, published 1818),Le Sage 1780/1818 John Herapath (1816)Herapath 1816, 1821 and John James Waterston (1843),Waterston 1843 which connected their research with the development of mechanical explanations of gravitation. In 1856 August Kr√∂nig (probably after reading a paper of Waterston) created a simple gas-kinetic model, which only considered the translational motion of the particles.Kr√∂nig 1856 In 1857 Rudolf Clausius, according to his own words independently of Kr√∂nig, developed a similar, but much more sophisticated version of the theory which included translational and contrary to Kr√∂nig also rotational and vibrational molecular motions. In this same work he introduced the concept of mean free path of a particle. Clausius 1857 In 1859, after reading a paper on the diffusion of molecules by Rudolf Clausius, Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell formulated the Maxwell distribution of molecular velocities, which gave the proportion of molecules having a certain velocity in a specific range.See: * Maxwell, J.C. (1860) \\"Illustrations of the dynamical theory of gases. Part I. On the motions and collisions of perfectly elastic spheres,\\" Philosophical Magazine, 4th series, 19 : 19‚Äì32. * Maxwell, J.C. (1860) \\"Illustrations of the dynamical theory of gases. Part II. On the process of diffusion of two or more kinds of moving particles among one another,\\" Philosophical Magazine, 4th series, 20 : 21‚Äì37. This was the first-ever statistical law in physics. Maxwell also gave the first mechanical argument that molecular collisions entail an equalization of temperatures and hence a tendency towards equilibrium. In his 1873 thirteen page article 'Molecules', Maxwell states: \\"we are told that an 'atom' is a material point, invested and surrounded by 'potential forces' and that when 'flying molecules' strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called pressure of air and other gases.\\"Maxwell 1875 In 1871, Ludwig Boltzmann generalized Maxwell's achievement and formulated the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution. Also the logarithmic connection between entropy and probability was first stated by him. In the beginning of the twentieth century, however, atoms were considered by many physicists to be purely hypothetical constructs, rather than real objects. An important turning point was Albert Einstein's (1905)Einstein 1905 and Marian Smoluchowski's (1906)Smoluchowski 1906 papers on Brownian motion, which succeeded in making certain accurate quantitative predictions based on the kinetic theory. Assumptions The theory for ideal gases makes the following assumptions: * The gas consists of very small particles known as molecules. This smallness of their size is such that the total volume of the individual gas molecules added up is negligible compared to the volume of the smallest open ball containing all the molecules. This is equivalent to stating that the average distance separating the gas particles is large compared to their size. * These particles have the same mass. * The number of molecules is so large that statistical treatment can be applied. * The rapidly moving particles constantly collide among themselves and with the walls of the container. All these collisions are perfectly elastic. This means the molecules are considered to be perfectly spherical in shape and elastic in nature. * Except during collisions, the interactions among molecules are negligible. (That is, they exert no forces on one another.) :This implies: ::1. Relativistic effects are negligible. ::2. Quantum-mechanical effects are negligible. This means that the inter-particle distance is much larger than the thermal de Broglie wavelength and the molecules are treated as classical objects. ::3. Because of the above two, their dynamics can be treated classically. This means that the equations of motion of the molecules are time-reversible. * The average kinetic energy of the gas particles depends only on the absolute temperature of the system. The kinetic theory has its own definition of temperature, not identical with the thermodynamic definition. * The elapsed time of a collision between a molecule and the container's wall is negligible when compared to the time between successive collisions. * Because they have mass, gravity will accelerate molecules. (If this were not the case then there would be no density gradient in a planet's troposphere and it would collapse to the surface.) More modern developments relax these assumptions and are based on the Boltzmann equation. These can accurately describe the properties of dense gases, because they include the volume of the molecules. The necessary assumptions are the absence of quantum effects, molecular chaos and small gradients in bulk properties. Expansions to higher orders in the density are known as virial expansions. An important book on kinetic theory is that by Chapman and Cowling.Chapman, S., Cowling, T.G. (1939/1970). An important approach to the subject is called Chapman‚ÄìEnskog theory.Kauzmann, W. (1966). Kinetic Theory of Gasses, W.A. Benjamin, New York, pp. 232‚Äì235. There have been many modern developments and there is an alternative approach developed by Grad based on moment expansions.Grad 1949 In the other limit, for extremely rarefied gases, the gradients in bulk properties are not small compared to the mean free paths. This is known as the Knudsen regime and expansions can be performed in the Knudsen number. Equilibrium properties = Pressure and kinetic energy= In kinetic model of gases, the pressure is equal to the force exerted by the atoms hitting and rebounding from a unit area of the gas container surface. Consider a gas of N molecules, each of mass m, enclosed in a cube of volume V = L3. When a gas molecule collides with the wall of the container perpendicular to the x axis and bounces off in the opposite direction with the same speed (an elastic collision), the change in momentum is given by: :\\\\Delta p = p_{i,x} - p_{f,x} = p_{i,x} - (-p_{i,x}) = 2 p_{i,x} = 2 mv_x, where p is the momentum, i and f indicate initial and final momentum (before and after collision), x indicates that only the x direction is being considered, and v is the speed of the particle (which is the same before and after the collision). The particle impacts one specific side wall once every :\\\\Delta t = \\\\frac{2L}{v_x}, where L is the distance between opposite walls. The force due to this particle is :F = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta p}{\\\\Delta t} = \\\\frac{m v_x^2}{L}. The total force on the wall is :F = \\\\frac{Nm\\\\overline{v_x^2}}{L}, where the bar denotes an average over the N particles. Since the motion of the particles is random and there is no bias applied in any direction, the average squared speed in each direction is identical: :\\\\overline{v_x^2} = \\\\overline{v_y^2} = \\\\overline{v_z^2}. By Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions the total squared speed v is given by :\\\\overline{v^2} = \\\\overline{v_x^2} + \\\\overline{v_y^2} + \\\\overline{v_z^2}, :\\\\overline{v^2} = 3\\\\overline{v_x^2}. Therefore: :\\\\overline{v_x^2} = \\\\frac{\\\\overline{v^2}}{3}, and the force can be written as: :F = \\\\frac{Nm\\\\overline{v^2}}{3L}. This force is exerted on an area L2. Therefore, the pressure of the gas is :P = \\\\frac{F}{L^2} = \\\\frac{Nm\\\\overline{v^2}}{3V}, where V = L3 is the volume of the box. In terms of the kinetic energy of the gas K: :PV = \\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\times{K}. This is a first non-trivial result of the kinetic theory because it relates pressure, a macroscopic property, to the (translational) kinetic energy of the molecules N\\\\frac{1}{2} m\\\\overline{v^2}, which is a microscopic property. =Temperature and kinetic energy= Rewriting the above result for the pressure as PV = {Nm\\\\overline{v^2}\\\\over 3} , we may combine it with the ideal gas law where \\\\displaystyle k_B is the Boltzmann constant and \\\\displaystyle T the absolute temperature defined by the ideal gas law, to obtain :k_B T = {m\\\\overline{v^2}\\\\over 3} , which leads to simplified expression of the average kinetic energy per molecule,The average kinetic energy of a fluid is proportional to the root mean-square velocity, which always exceeds the mean velocity - Kinetic Molecular Theory : \\\\displaystyle \\\\frac {1} {2} m\\\\overline{v^2} = \\\\frac {3} {2} k_B T. The kinetic energy of the system is N times that of a molecule, namely K= \\\\frac {1} {2} N m \\\\overline{v^2} . Then the temperature \\\\displaystyle T takes the form which becomes Eq.() is one important result of the kinetic theory: The average molecular kinetic energy is proportional to the ideal gas law's absolute temperature. From Eq.() and Eq.(), we have Thus, the product of pressure and volume per mole is proportional to the average (translational) molecular kinetic energy. Eq.() and Eq.() are called the \\"classical results\\", which could also be derived from statistical mechanics; for more details, see: Configuration integral (statistical mechanics) Since there are \\\\displaystyle 3N degrees of freedom in a monatomic-gas system with \\\\displaystyle N particles, the kinetic energy per degree of freedom per molecule is In the kinetic energy per degree of freedom, the constant of proportionality of temperature is 1/2 times Boltzmann constant or R/2 per mole. In addition to this, the temperature will decrease when the pressure drops to a certain point. This result is related to the equipartition theorem. As noted in the article on heat capacity, diatomic gases should have 7 degrees of freedom, but the lighter diatomic gases act as if they have only 5. Monatomic gases have 3 degrees of freedom. Thus the kinetic energy per kelvin (monatomic ideal gas) is 3 [R/2] = 3R/2: * per mole: 12.47 J * per molecule: 20.7 yJ = 129 ŒºeV. At standard temperature (273.15 K), we get: * per mole: 3406 J * per molecule: 5.65 zJ = 35.2 meV. =Collisions with container= The velocity distribution of particles hitting the container wall can be calculated based on naive kinetic theory, and the result can be used for analyzing effusive flow rate: Assume that, in the container, the number density is n and particles obey Maxwell's velocity distribution: :f_{Maxwell}(v_x,v_y,v_z)dv_xdv_ydv_z=\\\\left(\\\\frac{m}{2 \\\\pi kT}\\\\right)^{3/2}\\\\, e^{- \\\\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}} dv_xdv_ydv_z Then the number of particles hitting the area dA with speed v at angle \\\\theta from the normal, in time interval dt is: :nv\\\\cos{\\\\theta}dAdt{\\\\times}\\\\left(\\\\frac{m}{2 \\\\pi k_BT}\\\\right)^{3/2}\\\\, e^{- \\\\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}} (v^2\\\\sin{\\\\theta}dv{d\\\\theta}d\\\\phi). Integrating this over all appropriate velocities within the constraint v>0,0<\\\\theta<\\\\pi/2,0<\\\\phi<2\\\\pi yields the number of atomic or molecular collisions with a wall of a container per unit area per unit time: :J_{collision} = \\\\frac{1}{4}n \\\\bar v = \\\\frac{n}{4} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{8 k_{B} T}{\\\\pi m}}. This quantity is also known as the \\"impingement rate\\" in vacuum physics. If this small area A is punched to become a small hole, the effusive flow rate will be: :\\\\Phi_{effusion} = J_{collision} A= nA \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{k_{B} T}{2 \\\\pi m}}. Combined with ideal gas law, this yields: :\\\\Phi_{effusion} = \\\\frac{P A}{\\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi m k_{B} T}}. The velocity distribution of particles hitting this small area is: :\\\\begin{align} f(v,\\\\theta,\\\\phi)dv{d\\\\theta}d\\\\phi &=const.{\\\\times}(v\\\\cos{\\\\theta}){\\\\times}e^{- \\\\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}}{\\\\times}(v^2\\\\sin{\\\\theta}dv{d\\\\theta}d\\\\phi)  &=const.{\\\\times}(v^3e^{- \\\\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}}dv){\\\\times}(\\\\cos{\\\\theta}\\\\sin{\\\\theta}{d\\\\theta}){\\\\times}d\\\\phi \\\\end{align} with the constraint v>0,0<\\\\theta<\\\\pi/2,0<\\\\phi<2\\\\pi, and const. can be determined by normalization condition to be \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\left(\\\\frac{m}{k_BT}\\\\right)^2. =Speed of molecules= From the kinetic energy formula it can be shown that :v_\\\\text{p} = \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{k_B T}{m}}, : \\\\bar v = \\\\frac {2}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}} v_p = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac {8}{\\\\pi} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{k_B T}{m}}, :v_\\\\text{rms} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{3}{2}} v_p = \\\\sqrt{{3} \\\\cdot \\\\frac {k_B T}{m}}, where v is in m/s, T is in kelvins, and m is the mass of one molecule of gas. The most probable (or mode) speed v_\\\\text{p} is 81.6% of the rms speed v_\\\\text{rms}, and the mean (arithmetic mean, or average) speed \\\\bar v is 92.1% of the rms speed (isotropic distribution of speeds). See: * Average, * Root-mean-square speed * Arithmetic mean * Mean * Mode (statistics) Transport properties The kinetic theory of gases deals not only with gases in thermodynamic equilibrium, but also very importantly with gases not in thermodynamic equilibrium. This means using Kinetic Theory to consider what are known as \\"transport properties\\", such as viscosity, thermal conductivity and mass diffusivity. =Viscosity and kinetic momentum= In books on elementary kinetic theory one can find results for dilute gas modeling that has widespread use. Derivation of the kinetic model for shear viscosity usually starts by considering a Couette flow where two parallel plates are separated by a gas layer. The upper plate is moving at a constant velocity to the right due to a force F. The lower plate is stationary, and an equal and opposite force must therefore be acting on it to keep it at rest. The molecules in the gas layer have a forward velocity component u which increase uniformly with distance y above the lower plate. The non-equilibrium flow is superimposed on a Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution of molecular motions. Let \\\\sigma be the collision cross section of one molecule colliding with another. The number density n is defined as the number of molecules per (extensive) volume n = N/V . The collision cross section per volume or collision cross section density is n \\\\sigma , and it is related to the mean free path l by \\\\quad l = \\\\frac {1} {\\\\sqrt{2} n \\\\sigma} Notice that the unit of the collision cross section per volume n \\\\sigma is reciprocal of length. The mean free path is the average distance traveled by a molecule, or a number of molecules per volume, before they make their first collision. Let u_{0} be the forward velocity of the gas at an imaginary horizontal surface inside the gas layer. The number of molecules arriving at an area dA on one side of the gas layer, with speed v at angle \\\\theta from the normal, in time interval dt is \\\\quad nv\\\\cos{\\\\theta}dAdt{\\\\times}\\\\left(\\\\frac{m}{2 \\\\pi k_BT}\\\\right)^{3/2}\\\\, e^{- \\\\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}} (v^2\\\\sin{\\\\theta}dv{d\\\\theta}d\\\\phi) These molecules made their last collision at a distance l\\\\cos \\\\theta above and below the gas layer, and each will contribute a forward momentum of \\\\quad p_{x}^{\\\\pm} = m \\\\left( u_{0} \\\\pm l \\\\cos \\\\theta {d u \\\\over dy} \\\\right), where plus sign applies to molecules from above, and minus sign below. Note that the forward velocity gradient du/dy can be considered to be constant over a distance of mean free path. Integrating over all appropriate velocities within the constraint \\\\quad v>0,0<\\\\theta<\\\\pi/2,0<\\\\phi<2\\\\pi yields the forward momentum transfer per unit time per unit area (also known as shear stress): \\\\quad \\\\tau^{\\\\pm} = \\\\frac {1}{4} \\\\bar v n \\\\cdot m \\\\left( u_{0} \\\\pm \\\\frac {2}{3} l {d u \\\\over dy} \\\\right) The net rate of momentum per unit area that is transported across the imaginary surface is thus \\\\quad \\\\tau = \\\\tau^{+} - \\\\tau^{-} = \\\\frac {1}{3} \\\\bar v n m \\\\cdot l {d u \\\\over dy} Combining the above kinetic equation with Newton's law of viscosity \\\\quad \\\\tau = \\\\eta {d u \\\\over dy} gives the equation for shear viscosity, which is usually denoted \\\\eta_{0} when it is a dilute gas: \\\\quad \\\\eta_{0} = \\\\frac {1} {3} \\\\bar v n m l Combining this equation with the equation for mean free path gives \\\\quad \\\\eta_{0} = \\\\frac {1} {3 \\\\sqrt{2} } \\\\frac {m \\\\cdot \\\\bar v} {\\\\sigma} Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution gives the average (equilibrium) molecular speed as \\\\quad \\\\bar v = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}} v_{p} = 2 \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\cdot \\\\frac {k_{B}T}{m_{}}} where v_{p} is the most probable speed. We note that \\\\quad k_{B} \\\\cdot N_{A} = R \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad M = m \\\\cdot N_{A} and insert the velocity in the viscosity equation above. This gives the well known equation for shear viscosity for dilute gases: \\\\quad \\\\eta_{0} = \\\\frac {2} {3 \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi} } \\\\cdot \\\\frac {\\\\sqrt{m k_{B} T}} { \\\\sigma } = \\\\frac {2} {3 \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi} } \\\\cdot \\\\frac {\\\\sqrt{MRT}} { \\\\sigma \\\\cdot N_{A} } and M is the molar mass. The equation above presupposes that the gas density is low (i.e. the pressure is low). This implies that the kinetic translational energy dominates over rotational and vibrational molecule energies. The viscosity equation further presupposes that there is only one type of gas molecules, and that the gas molecules are perfect elastic and hard core particles of spherical shape. This assumption of elastic, hard core spherical molecules, like billiard balls, implies that the collision cross section of one molecule can be estimated by \\\\quad \\\\sigma = \\\\pi \\\\left( 2 r \\\\right)^2 = \\\\pi d^2 The radius r is called collision cross section radius or kinetic radius, and the diameter d is called collision cross section diameter or kinetic diameter of a molecule in a monomolecular gas. There are no simple general relation between the collision cross section and the hard core size of the (fairly spherical) molecule. The relation depends on shape of the potential energy of the molecule. For a real spherical molecule (i.e. a noble gas atom or a reasonably spherical molecule) the interaction potential is more like the Lennard-Jones potential or Morse potential which have a negative part that attracts the other molecule from distances longer than the hard core radius. The radius for zero Lennard-Jones potential is then appropriate to use as estimate for the kinetic radius. =Thermal conductivity and heat flux= Following a similar logic as above, one can derive the kinetic model for thermal conductivity of a dilute gas: Consider two parallel plates separated by a gas layer. Both plates have uniform temperatures, and are so massive compared to the gas layer that they can be treated as thermal reservoirs. The upper plate has a higher temperature than the lower plate. The molecules in the gas layer have a molecular kinetic energy \\\\varepsilon which increases uniformly with distance y above the lower plate. The non-equilibrium energy flow is superimposed on a Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution of molecular motions. Let \\\\varepsilon_{0} be the molecular kinetic energy of the gas at an imaginary horizontal surface inside the gas layer. The number of molecules arriving at an area dA on one side of the gas layer, with speed v at angle \\\\theta from the normal, in time interval dt is \\\\quad nv\\\\cos{\\\\theta}dAdt{\\\\times}\\\\left(\\\\frac{m}{2 \\\\pi k_BT}\\\\right)^{3/2}\\\\, e^{- \\\\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}} (v^2\\\\sin{\\\\theta}dv{d\\\\theta}d\\\\phi) These molecules made their last collision at a distance l\\\\cos \\\\theta above and below the gas layer, and each will contribute a molecular kinetic energy of \\\\quad \\\\varepsilon^{\\\\pm} = \\\\left( \\\\varepsilon_{0} \\\\pm m c_v l \\\\cos \\\\theta {d T \\\\over dy} \\\\right), where c_v is the specific heat capacity. Again, plus sign applies to molecules from above, and minus sign below. Note that the temperature gradient dT/dy can be considered to be constant over a distance of mean free path. Integrating over all appropriate velocities within the constraint \\\\quad v>0,0<\\\\theta<\\\\pi/2,0<\\\\phi<2\\\\pi yields the energy transfer per unit time per unit area (also known as heat flux): \\\\quad q_y^{\\\\pm} = -\\\\frac {1}{4} \\\\bar v n \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\varepsilon_{0} \\\\pm \\\\frac {2}{3} m c_v l {d T \\\\over dy} \\\\right) Note that the energy transfer from above is in the -y direction, and therefore the overall minus sign in the equation. The net heat flux across the imaginary surface is thus \\\\quad q = q_y^{+} - q_y^{-} = -\\\\frac {1}{3} \\\\bar v n m c_v l {d T \\\\over dy} Combining the above kinetic equation with Fourier's law \\\\quad q = -\\\\kappa {d T \\\\over dy} gives the equation for thermal conductivity, which is usually denoted \\\\kappa_{0} when it is a dilute gas: \\\\quad \\\\kappa_{0} = \\\\frac {1} {3} \\\\bar v n m c_v l = Diffusion Coefficient and diffusion flux = Following a similar logic as above, one can derive the kinetic model for mass diffusivity of a dilute gas: Consider a steady diffusion between two regions of the same gas with perfectly flat and parallel boundaries separated by a layer of the same gas. Both regions have uniform number densities, but the upper region has a higher number density than the lower region. In the steady state, the number density at any point is constant (that is, independent of time). However, the number density n in the layer increases uniformly with distance y above the lower plate. The non-equilibrium molecular flow is superimposed on a Maxwell- Boltzmann equilibrium distribution of molecular motions. Let n_{0} be the number density of the gas at an imaginary horizontal surface inside the layer. The number of molecules arriving at an area dA on one side of the gas layer, with speed v at angle \\\\theta from the normal, in time interval dt is \\\\quad nv\\\\cos{\\\\theta}dAdt{\\\\times}\\\\left(\\\\frac{m}{2 \\\\pi k_BT}\\\\right)^{3/2}\\\\, e^{- \\\\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}} (v^2\\\\sin{\\\\theta}dv{d\\\\theta}d\\\\phi) These molecules made their last collision at a distance l\\\\cos \\\\theta above and below the gas layer, where the local number density is \\\\quad n^{\\\\pm} = \\\\left( n_{0} \\\\pm l \\\\cos \\\\theta {d n \\\\over dy} \\\\right) Again, plus sign applies to molecules from above, and minus sign below. Note that the number density gradient dn/dy can be considered to be constant over a distance of mean free path. Integrating over all appropriate velocities within the constraint \\\\quad v>0,0<\\\\theta<\\\\pi/2,0<\\\\phi<2\\\\pi yields the molecular transfer per unit time per unit area (also known as diffusion flux): \\\\quad J_y^{\\\\pm} = -\\\\frac {1}{4} \\\\bar v \\\\cdot \\\\left( n_{0} \\\\pm \\\\frac {2}{3} l {d n \\\\over dy} \\\\right) Note that the molecular transfer from above is in the -y direction, and therefore the overall minus sign in the equation. The net diffusion flux across the imaginary surface is thus \\\\quad J = J_y^{+} - J_y^{-} = -\\\\frac {1}{3} \\\\bar v l {d n \\\\over dy} Combining the above kinetic equation with Fick's first law of diffusion \\\\quad J = -D {d n \\\\over dy} gives the equation for mass diffusivity, which is usually denoted D_{0} when it is a dilute gas: \\\\quad D_{0} = \\\\frac {1} {3} \\\\bar v l See also * Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood- Yvon hierarchy of equations * Boltzmann equation * Collision theory * Critical temperature * Gas laws * Heat * Interatomic potential * Magnetohydrodynamics * Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution * Mixmaster dynamics * Thermodynamics * Vicsek model * Vlasov equation Notes References * * de Groot, S.

Between dams it follows a very constricted course, but after Almourol, Portugal it has a wide alluvial valley, prone to flooding. Its mouth is a large estuary culminating at the major port, and Portuguese capital, Lisbon. The source is specifically: in political geography, at the Fuente de Garc√≠a in the Fr√≠as de Albarrac√≠n municipality; in physical geography, within the notably high range, the Sistema Ib√©rico (Iberian System), of the Sierra de Albarrac√≠n Comarca. All the major tributaries are right bank, which is locally to the north. The river flows in Spain, along the two countries' border and in Portugal. The main cities the rivers passes through consecutively are Aranjuez, Toledo and Talavera de la Reina in Spain, and Abrantes, Santar√©m, Almada and Lisbon in Portugal. The Spanish capital, Madrid, lies in the upper drainage basin. Course Map of the drainage basin =In Spain= Guadarrama and Tagus rivers The first notable city on the Tagus is Saced√≥n. Below Aranjuez it receives the combined flow of the Jarama, Henares, Algodor and Taju√±a. Below Toledo it receives the Guadarrama River. Above Talavera de la Reina it receives the Alberche. At Valdeverdeja is the upper end of the long upper reservoir, the Embalse de Valdeca√±as, beyond which are the Embalse de Torrejon, into which flow the Ti√©tar, and the lower reservoir, the Alc√°ntara Dam into which flows the Alag√≥n at the lower end. A canal and aqueduct are between the Tagus and the Segura for the Tagus-Segura Water Transfer. =In Portugal= After forming the border it enters Portugal, passing Vila Velha de R√≥d√£o, Abrantes, Const√¢ncia, Entroncamento, Santar√©m and Vila Franca de Xira at the head of the long narrow estuary, which has Lisbon at its mouth. The estuary is protected by the Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve. There is a large bridge across the river, the Vasco da Gama Bridge, which with a total length of is the second longest bridge in Europe. The Port of Lisbon, straddling its mouth, is one of Europe's busiest. The Portuguese Alentejo region and former Ribatejo Province take their names from the river; Alentejo, from al√©m Tejo \\"Beyond the Tejo\\" and Ribatejo likely from arriba Tejo, an archaic way of saying \\"Upper Tejo\\". However Spanish means riverside, or riviera. If from that root Ribatejo would mean very generically \\"Tejo-side\\". Many instances of towns in Spain have this prefix. Name The river's Latin name is Tagus and it is known under different names in the languages of Iberia:   *. It is known in Italian as and Greek as (T√°gos). Geology The lower Tagus is on a fault line. Slippage along it has caused numerous earthquakes, the major ones being those of 1309, 1531 and 1755. Downloadable Internet Archive History Tagus river seen from the Castle of Almourol (Portugal) The Pepper Wreck, properly the wreck of the Nossa Senhora dos M√°rtires, is a shipwreck located and excavated at the mouth of the Tagus between 1996 and 2001. The river had strategic value to the Spanish and Portuguese empires, as it guarded the approach to Lisbon. For example, in 1587, Francis Drake briefly approached the river after his successful raid at Cadiz. Popular culture A major river, the Tagus is brought to mind in the songs and stories of the Portuguese. A popular fado song in Lisbon notes that while people get older, the Tagus remains young (\\"My hair getting white, the Tagus is always young\\"). The author, Fernando Pessoa, wrote a poem that begins: :\\"The Tagus is more beautiful than the river that flows through my village. But the Tagus is not more beautiful than the river that flows through my village...\\" Richard Crashaw (died 1649) wrote a poem \\"Saint Mary Magdalene, or the Weeper\\". This refers to the \\"Golden\\" Tagus as wanting Mary Magdalene's silver tears. In classical poetry the Tagus was famous for its gold-bearing sands (the catalogued works of: Catullus 29.19; Ovid's Amores 1.15.34; Juvenal's Satires 3.55; and others).

Incorporating both physical and artistic elements, it was created in Japan in the 1960s. Its roots lay in the traditional Japanese martial arts, Chinese medicine and Buddhist meditation techniques, while its creator Hiroyuki Aoki was also influenced by modern Western art and Christianity. As well as being a practical martial art Shintaido aims to be a form of artistic expression, a healthy exercise, and a path of self-discovery and transformation. Shintaido is practised with bare hands, but the curriculum also includes bojutsu (Ê£íË°ì), involving the use of the long staff (or b≈ç, Ê£í), and kenjutsu (Ââ£Ë°ì), using a wooden sword (or bokuto, Êú®ÂàÄ). Origins =Bud≈ç for the modern age= Hiroyuki Aoki's spiritual and artistic aspirations were not satisfied by karate as it existed in the 1960s. Striving for beauty and peace, he was searching for ‚Äòboth soft and expansive movement, spreading out to the ends of the earth ‚Äì and power which could be used comfortably without turning against nature or the body.‚Äô While studying karate under Shigeru Egami, he created his own research group which, as well as including karate practitioners, included others who had abandoned it as being too severe and unsparing, and also people with physical limitations. Then in 1964 he reached his goal of discovering a way of moving the body in a more natural, beautiful and effective manner. Yet he believed it might have taken a beginner 20 years of study to achieve this kind of movement. If it were to spearhead the new culture that he aspired for, Aoki realised that he needed system that could be learned relatively easily. He wanted to create an entire martial art that would convince the public at large ‚Äì but one capable of revitalising both the body and the spirit, giving energy, refreshment and the hope of living a more colourful life, of restoring the soul day by day. Aoki has said that he wanted to bring martial arts to the same level of attainment as the works of great Western artists such as Beethoven, Van Gogh or Dostoyevsky, or the American writers he admired, notably Henry Miller, Jackson Pollock or Walt Whitman. =Rakutenkai (Ê•ΩÂ§©‰ºö)= To this end, on 23 September 1965, he collected an informal group around him which he called ‚ÄòRakutenkai‚Äô, which had as its aim to pursue truth in daily life, acquire perfect liberty, live within the light of liberty, and become the light of the world. The only requirement was that members should practise with the group at least twice a year; among its members were active high-ranking martial artists, others who had given up their practice, women, children, old people and people with physical disabilities. Aoki wanted even the least strong people to be able to enjoy the fruits of his study even though the traditional processes of the martial arts tended to be selective and exclusive. From his own experience and careful study of the texts, Aoki believed that anyone, if properly supported, could reveal him- or herself as a ‚Äòliving treasure‚Äô. So he set the group five rules: # Stick to your own morality # Never forget your original self # Never judge others # Love your neighbour as yourself # - (the last was left blank, to be filled in by each person according to their own beliefs). From this group he chose a team of around 30 instructors to conduct deep research into technique. From their experimental practice, Hiroyuki Aoki selected certain movements and techniques, and introduced them into his new system. Three fundamental kata emerged during this period: Tenshingoso (which Aoki had created by April 1966), Eiko (which the Rakutenkai discovered during a late-night practice on 1 December 1966; and Hikari (see below). In 1970 he set up his own school, Sogobudo (holistic martial art) Renmei, to revive traditional Bud≈ç by developing and teaching Shintaido. After Rakutenkai had been disbanded a number of Aoki's leading practitioners and teachers, who had helped him create Shintaido, left the group. Among these were Master Egamis son Masatake Egami, Kato Tomorori, Hokari Shikoh and his brother, Ito Juguro, Toshima Shigeiko and Chieko Kato. With this passing much of the creative energy left the Shintaido organisation and practice. Claimed Benefits Shintaido assumes that the challenges facing modern people are more rooted in emotional and psychological matters than physical. Shintaido offers body movements that aim to build resources to live better and develop a new 'way of being' that is more intuitive, aware, and less tense; this stems from the belief that the freer the body, the more effective its movements can be. The hope of founder Hiroyuki Aoki was to create a martial art that could reach the level of great art. How Shintaido was born so beauty and fluidity are essential aspects. The practice of Shintaido brings with it a bodily awareness and receptivity to the many messages the body transmits so that it can be used as a tool to explore the individual's inner state of being, evolution, limitations and resources. The partner exercises aim to provide an opportunity to discover and develop the ability to communicate and affirm oneself. The dojo (ÈÅìÂ†¥, practice space) is a place in which to explore this concept in safety. Basic Forms Every Shintaido practice begins with warming-up exercises designed to soften and extend the body until it can move naturally, without the tensions of everyday life. This may be followed by a period of more vigorous exercises, designed to open of the body. These exercises, like everything in Shintaido, are based on effective martial arts technique. Most of these exercises can be practised alone, with a single partner or in a group; they can be performed dynamically, formally or slowly and meditatively. Some require use of the voice. =Tenshingoso (Â§©Áúü‰∫îÁõ∏)= Tenshingoso (five expressions of cosmic truth) is one of the essential forms (or kata, Âûã) of Shintaido. Its significance can vary depending on the context in which it is performed. As a martial technique, it is a distillation of all the principal techniques (attacks, cuts and throws) of bud≈ç. As an artistic symbol, it is a metaphor of the life-cycle, from birth to death. As a technique of personal development, it is an encyclopedia of meditation positions (mudras). =Eiko (Ê†ÑÂÖâ)= Adapted from the art of swordsmanship, Eiko (glory) is a hymn to the glory of the human adventure, taking the practitioner between earth and heaven, ideal and reality. If done with conviction, it can bring practitioners out of their ‚Äòsmall world‚Äô and plunge them into a whirl of new sensations. To do Eiko is open up the space around and within oneself; with a partner, it develops a sense of timing, concentration and gives a chance to go far beyond one's normal limits. =Hikari (ÂÖâ)= Hikari (playing with light), though virtually indescribable, can be considered Shintaido's artistic masterpiece. It is a unique form of personal expression: its movements are totally free, so it has no form, and cannot be taught. Hikari to tawamureru In Wakame taiso („Çè„Åã„ÇÅ‰ΩìÊìç, seaweed exercise) two people, face to face, alternately take the role of the seaweed and the ocean. The seaweed, rooted on the seabed, waves sinuously in response to the gentle touch of the ocean around it. This exercise can quickly induce a state of deep intensity. It also helps develop a sensitivity to attack and allows a fluid, centred response. =Taimyo (Â§ßÂ¶ô)= The gentlest and most recent of the Shintaido kata, Taimyo (great mystery) was developed to allow older, less robust people or pregnant women to build up their strength and experience the beauty of Shintaido practice. A long and gentle kata, it contains elements of many aspects of Shintaido practice, has a therapeutic dimension, and builds a state of deep meditation. From relaxation and stretching to openness and freedom The first objective of Shintaido is to make the body and mind completely relaxed, fluid and flexible. Next it develops large movements through which we can express our vital energy and talents. Many exercises open the body, especially the hips, the stomach, chest and hands. Practitioners aim to develop an open spirit with which to approach life at large, and other people. Kumite (ÁµÑ„ÅøÊâã, partner practices) allow us to test the effectiveness of the techniques we have learned: an open body, large movements and clear intention make the techniques effective. There is no competition. Each participant is encouraged to express him or herself freely and to discover his or her potential in a spirit of cooperation with, respect for and confidence in one another. A kumite may begin with a formal movement but is transformed progressively into a kind of free dance between two partners. On tenshingoso kumite Applied Shintaido =Shintaido bojutsu (Êñ∞Ê£íË°ì)= The bojutsu curriculum is one of the most popular aspects of Shintaido, and for many people provided and point first contact. Students use a long staff (or b≈ç, Ê£í) to extend their movement, and later progress to the more difficult short staff (or j≈ç, Êùñ). Beginners study a range of basic movements as well as three short kata which are based on traditional Japanese bojutsu practice. These kata are: * Hino kata (ÁÅ´„ÅÆÂûã, kata of fire), derived from Sakugawa (‰Ωê‰πÖÂ∑ù) * Kazeno kata (È¢®„ÅÆÂûã, kata of wind), derived from Matsukaze (ÊùæÈ¢®, the wind in the pines) * Mizuno kata (Ê∞¥„ÅÆÂûã, kata of water), derived from Hakuson (ÁôΩÊ®Ω) There is also a kumibo kata called shinjo (ÁúüÂ∏∏), offered in sho (Â∞è, correct, or formal) & dai (Â§ß, big, or expressive) forms. Advanced students (from shodan and above) study the 3 long kata from which the basic kata were derived. At the highest level there is a longer kata (known colloquially as \\"Go Down Moses\\") in which all 3 kata are combined into a single form. =Shintaido karate (Êñ∞Á©∫Êâã)= The Shinatido karate curriculum is based on a cut down version of the shotokai karate curriculum, which is the school run by Egami sensei at the time Shintaido was created. The study of karate is meant to complement the study of Shintaido itself, and is most often taken up by Shintaido students of many years experience who wish to study the history and origins of Shintaido movement. Beginners study two taikyoku (Â§™Ê•µ) and two heian (Âπ≥ÂÆâ) katas (each is offered in sho & dai forms) as well as variety of strikes, kicks and kumite arrangements. Advanced students (from shodan and above) study a range of traditional karate kata, culminating in a revisiting of the original taikyoku kata at the highest level. Curriculum and organisation Shintaido offers five Dan (ÊÆµ, higher level) grades: currently just four people in the world hold the highest grade (5th Dan). On average it takes ten years of practice to reach 1st Dan (the grade of Shintaido instructor). Equivalent grades are also offered in the Shintaido forms of bojutsu & karate. In Europe Kyu (Á¥ö, lower level) examinations are conducted in each country. For 1st Dan and above, they are held at a European workshop organised by the European Shintaido College (ESC). Exams of 3rd Dan and above are held at international festivals held every four years at varying locations around the world. The International Shintaido College (ISC) is the main organisation of Shintaido instructors. It meets every four years, when it also holds exams, of 3rd dan and above. Its Technical Committee (ISC-TC) comprises nine members, drawn from Shintaido's three regions: Europe, the Americas (including Australia) and Japan. This committee aims to harmonise practice and technique around the world. Japan, the country of Shintaido's origin, has many instructors, most working within a national organisation (NPO). In the Western hemisphere, Shintaido is practised in USA, Canada and Brazil. The US instructors operate under the auspices of Shintaido of America. In Europe, The European Shintaido College (ESC) includes most of the Shintaido instructors in Europe, based in Germany, Belgium, Spain, France, Britain, Italy, the Czech Republic and Switzerland. ESC meets annually at a ‚Äòforum‚Äô, when exams of 1st and 2nd Dan are also held. The European Technical Committee (ETC) oversees the examinations and establishes the curriculum for all examinations in Europe. Kyu grade exams can be held nationally or locally, twice a year.

Corral was a 30-second shootout between lawmen led by Virgil Earp and members of a loosely organized group of outlaws called the Cowboys including Ike Clanton that took place at about 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday, October 26, 1881, in Tombstone, Arizona Territory, United States. It is generally regarded as the most famous shootout in the history of the American Wild West. The gunfight was the result of a long-simmering feud, with Cowboys Billy Claiborne, Ike and Billy Clanton, and Tom and Frank McLaury on one side; and Town Marshal Virgil Earp, Special Policemen Morgan and Wyatt Earp, and temporary policeman Doc Holliday on the other side. Billy Clanton and both McLaury brothers were killed. Ike Clanton, Billy Claiborne, and Wes Fuller ran from the fight. Virgil, Morgan, and Holliday were wounded, but Wyatt was unharmed. Wyatt is often erroneously regarded as the central figure in the shootout, although his brother Virgil was Tombstone town marshal and Deputy U.S. Marshal that day and had far more experience as a sheriff, constable, marshal, and soldier in combat.Frontier Lawman Virgil Earp The shootout has come to represent a period of the American Old West when the frontier was virtually an open range for outlaws, largely unopposed by law enforcement officers who were spread thin over vast territories. It was not well known to the American public until 1931, when Stuart Lake published the initially well- received biography Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal two years after Earp's death. The book was the basis for the 1946 film My Darling Clementine, directed by John Ford, and the 1957 film Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, after which the shootout became known by that name. Since then, the conflict has been portrayed with varying degrees of accuracy in numerous Western films and books, and has become an archetype for much of the popular imagery associated with the Old West. Despite its name, the gunfight did not take place within or next to the O.K. Corral, which fronted Allen Street and had a rear entrance lined with horse stalls on Fremont Street. The shootout actually took place in a narrow lot on the side of C. S. Fly's Photographic Studio on Fremont Street, six doors west of the O.K. Corral's rear entrance. Some members of the two opposing parties were initially only about apart. About 30 shots were fired in 30 seconds. Ike Clanton subsequently filed murder charges against the Earps and Holliday. After a 30-day preliminary hearing and a brief stint in jail, the lawmen were shown to have acted within the law. The gunfight was not the end of the conflict. On December 28, 1881, Virgil Earp was ambushed and maimed in a murder attempt by the Cowboys. On March 18, 1882, a Cowboy fired from a dark alley through the glass door of Campbell & Hatch's saloon and billiard parlor, killing Morgan Earp. The suspects in both incidents furnished alibis supplied by other Cowboys and were not indicted. Wyatt Earp, newly appointed as Deputy U.S. Marshal in Cochise County, then took matters into his own hands in a personal vendetta. He was pursued by county sheriff Johnny Behan, who had received a warrant from Tucson for Wyatt's killing of Frank Stilwell.  Background  Southeastern Arizona near Tombstone in 1887 Tombstone, located in Arizona Territory near the Mexican border, was founded in March 1879 after silver was discovered in the area. Like many frontier mining boomtowns, Tombstone grew rapidly. At its founding, it had a population of just 100, and only two years later, in late 1881, the population was more than 7,000 (excluding Chinese, Mexicans, women, and children), making it the largest boomtown in the American Southwest. Silver mining and its attendant wealth attracted many professionals and merchants, who brought their wives and families. With them came churches and ministers. By 1881 the town boasted fancy restaurants, a bowling alley, four churches, an ice house, a school, an opera house, two banks, three newspapers, and an ice cream parlor, along with 110 saloons, 14 gambling halls, and numerous brothels, all situated among a number of dirty, hardscrabble mines. Horse rustlers and bandits from the countryside often came to town, and shootings were frequent. In the 1880s, illegal smuggling and theft of cattle, alcohol, and tobacco smuggling across the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border, about from Tombstone, were common. The Mexican government assessed heavy export taxes on these items, and smugglers earned a handsome profit by stealing them in Mexico and selling them across the border. James, Virgil, and Wyatt Earp arrived in Tombstone on December 1, 1879, when the small town was mostly composed of tents as living quarters, a few saloons and other buildings, and the mines. Virgil had been hired as Deputy U.S. Marshal for eastern Pima County, with his offices in Tombstone, only days before his arrival. In June 1881 he was also appointed as Tombstone's town marshal (or police chief). Though not universally liked by the townspeople, the Earps tended to protect the interests of the town's business owners and residents; even so, Wyatt helped protect Cowboy \\"Curly Bill\\" Brocius from being lynched after he accidentally killed Tombstone town marshal Fred White. In contrast, Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan was generally sympathetic to the interests of the rural ranchers and members of the loosely organized outlaw group called the Cochise County Cowboys, or simply the Cowboys. (In that time and region, the term cowboy generally meant an outlaw; legitimate cowmen were instead referred to as cattle herders or ranchers.) Fire insurance map of Tombstone in 1886  Conflicting versions of events  Newspaper coverage of the fight Many of the sources describing the events leading up to the gunfight, and details of the gunfight itself, conflict with each other. Newspapers of the day were not above taking sides, and news reporting often editorialized on issues to reflect the publisher's interests. John Clum, publisher of The Tombstone Epitaph, had helped organize a \\"Committee of Safety\\" (a vigilance committee) in Tombstone in late September 1881. He was elected as Tombstone's first mayor under the new city charter of 1881. Clum and his newspaper tended to side with the interests of local business owners and supported Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp. Harry Woods, the publisher of the other major newspaper, The Daily Nugget, was an undersheriff to Behan. He and his newspaper tended to side with Behan, the Cowboys (some of whom were part-time ranchers and landowners), and the rural interests of the ranchers. Much of what is known of the event is based on month-long preliminary hearings held afterward, generally known as the Spicer hearings. Reporters from both newspapers covered the hearings and recorded the testimony there and at the coroner's inquest, but only the reporter from the Nugget knew shorthand. The testimony recorded by the court recorder and the two newspapers varied greatly. According to the Earps' version of events, the fight was in self-defense because the Cowboys, armed in violation of local ordinance, defied a lawful order to hand over their weapons and drew their pistols instead. The Cowboys maintained that they raised their hands, offered no resistance, and were shot in cold blood by the Earps. Sorting out who was telling the truth was difficult then and remains so to this day. Though usually opposing each other in their reporting of events, reporting by both the Epitaph and the Nugget initially supported the lawmen's version of events. Woods, the publisher of the pro-Cowboy Nugget, was out of town during the hearings, and an experienced reporter, Richard Rule, wrote the story. The Nugget staff had a close relationship with Behan, but Rule's story, as printed in the Nugget the day after the shootout, backed up the Earps' version of events. This varied widely from Behan's and the Cowboys' later court testimony.Behan's Lies Subsequent stories about the gunfight published in the Nugget after that day supported Behan's and the Cowboys' view of events. Other stories in the Epitaph countered the Nuggets later view entirely and supported the lawmen. In addition, Dr. George Goodfellow, who examined the Cowboys after their deaths, told the court that the angle of the wound in Billy Clanton's wrist indicated that his hands could not have been in the air, or holding his coats open by the lapels, as witnesses loyal to the Cowboys testified. Part- time newspaper reporter Howell \\"Pat\\" Hayhurst transcribed the testimony from the hearings in the early 1930s as part of a Federal Writers' Project, which was part of the Works Progress Administration. According to one report, Hayhurst was a friend of the Behan family. After he completed his transcription, he kept the original document in his home, where it was destroyed in a house fire.  Origins of the conflict  = Earps versus Cowboys = Virgil Earp Wyatt Earp The interpersonal conflicts and feuds leading to the gunfight were complex. Each side had strong family ties. The brothers James, Virgil, Wyatt, Morgan, and Warren Earp were a tight-knit family, working together as lawmen, pimps, and saloon owners in several frontier towns, among other occupations, and had moved together from one town to another. Virgil served in the Union Army during the American Civil War and in 1877 became a police officer in Prescott, Arizona Territory. He followed that with a job as a night watchman before he became a constable. Wyatt had held two jobs as a police officer in the cattle-drive towns of Wichita and Dodge City, Kansas. James, Virgil, and Wyatt Earp, together with their wives, arrived in Tombstone on December 1, 1879, during the early period of rapid growth associated with mining, when there were only a few hundred residents. Virgil was appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal shortly before he arrived in Tombstone. In the summer of 1880, Morgan and Warren Earp also moved to Tombstone. Wyatt arrived hoping he could leave \\"lawing\\" behind. He bought a stagecoach, only to find the business was already very competitive. The Earps invested together in several mining claims and water rights. The Earps were Republicans and Northerners who had never worked as cowmen or ranchers. The Earps quickly came into conflict with Frank and Tom McLaury, Billy and Ike Clanton, Johnny Ringo, and William \\"Curly Bill\\" Brocius, among others. They were part of a large, loose association of cattle smugglers and horse thieves known as the Cowboys, outlaws who had been implicated in various crimes. Ike Clanton was prone to drinking heavily and threatened the Earp brothers numerous times. Tombstone resident George Parson wrote in his diary, \\"A Cowboy is a rustler at times, and a rustler is a synonym for desperado‚Äîbandit, outlaw, and horse thief.\\" The San Francisco Examiner wrote in an editorial, \\"Cowboys [are] the most reckless class of outlaws in that wild country ... infinitely worse than the ordinary robber.\\" At that time during the 1880s in Cochise County, it was an insult to call a legitimate cattleman a \\"Cowboy.\\" The Cowboys teamed up for various crimes and came to each other's aid. Virgil thought that some of the Cowboys had met at Charleston and taken \\"an oath over blood drawn from the arm of Johnny Ringo, the leader, that they would kill us.\\" = The Earps as lawmen = Among the lawmen involved in the O.K. Corral shooting, only Virgil had any real experience in combat, and he had far more experience than any of his brothers as a sheriff, constable, and marshal. The Earps' work as lawmen was not welcomed by the Cowboys, who viewed the Earps as badge-toting tyrants who ruthlessly enforced the business interests of the town. In direct conflict with the Earps' roles as lawmen, Johnny Behan was Cochise County Sheriff. Virgil Earp had served for three years during the Civil War and had also been involved in a police shooting in Prescott, Arizona Territory. He was appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal for eastern Pima County by U.S. Marshal Crawley Dake, on November 27, 1879, before the Earps arrived in Tombstone on December 1, 1879. He was appointed as Tombstone's acting town marshal on September 30, 1880, after popular Tombstone town marshal Fred White was shot and killed by Brocius. Only six weeks later, Virgil ran for the office on November 12, 1880 but lost to Ben Sippy. However, on June 6, 1881, Sippy asked for a two-week leave of absence. The city soon discovered $3,000 () in financial improprieties in Sippy's records. A few days later Virgil was appointed as town marshal in his place. At the time of the gunfight, Virgil was both Deputy U.S. Marshal and town marshal. The city suspended him as town marshal after Ike Clanton filed murder charges. After Wyatt Earp first arrived in Tombstone, his business efforts yielded little profit, and he took a job as a stagecoach shotgun messenger for Wells Fargo, guarding shipments of silver bullion. On July 28, 1880 Wyatt was appointed Pima County Deputy Sheriff. He held this position for only three months, until after the election of November 9, 1880, when he resigned. When Virgil was maimed by an assassination attempt, Wyatt was appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal in his place. He held that position until he left Cochise County in April 1882. Wyatt Earp was an imposing, handsome man: blond, tall, weighing , broad-shouldered, long-armed, and muscular. He had been a boxer and was reputed to be an expert with a pistol. According to author Leo Silva, Earp showed no fear of any man. Wyatt had been an assistant marshal when he and policeman James Masterson, along with a few other citizens, fired their pistols at several cowboys who were fleeing town after shooting up a theater. A member of the group, George Hoyt (sometimes spelled Hoy), was shot in the arm and died of his wound a month later. Wyatt always claimed to have been the one to shoot Hoyt, although it could have been anyone among the lawmen. Wyatt had developed a reputation as a no-nonsense, hard-nosed lawman, but prior to the gunfight in October 1881, he had been involved in only one other shooting, in Dodge City, Kansas during the summer of 1878. The 1931 book Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal was a best-selling biography by Stuart N. Lake. It established Wyatt Earp's role as a fearless lawman in the American Old West and the legend of the \\"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\\" in the public consciousness. But Lake and many others in the popular media wildly exaggerated Wyatt's role as the central figure in the gunfight. It was only discovered much later that Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal, based on eight interviews with Earp, was largely fictional. The book and later Hollywood portrayals embellished Wyatt's reputation and magnified his mystique as a western lawman. Morgan Earp had no known experience with gunfighting prior to their arrival in Tombstone. While Wyatt was Pima County Deputy Sheriff on July 27, 1880, Morgan Earp took over his job as shotgun messenger for Wells Fargo. Morgan also occasionally assisted Virgil and at the time of the gunfight was wearing a deputy city marshal's badge and drawing pay. Doc Holliday had a reputation as a gunman and had reportedly been in nine shootouts during his life, although it has only been verified that he killed three men. One well-documented episode occurred on July 19, 1879, when Holliday and his business partner, former deputy marshal John Joshua Webb, were seated in their saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. Former U.S. Army scout Mike Gordon got into a loud argument with one of the saloon girls whom he wanted to take with him. Gordon stormed from the saloon and began firing his revolver into the building. Before Gordon could get off his second shot, Holliday killed him. Holliday was tried for the murder but acquitted, mostly based on the testimony of Webb. Holliday had saved Wyatt Earp's life at one time and had become a close friend. He had been living in Prescott, Arizona Territory and making a living as a gambler since late 1879. There, he first met future Tombstone sheriff Johnny Behan, a sometime gambler and saloon owner. In late September 1880, Holliday followed the Earps to Tombstone. = Rural Cowboys vs. Tombstone interests = Ike Clanton The ranch owned by Newman Haynes Clanton near Charleston, Arizona was believed to be the local center for the Cowboys' illegal activities. Tom and Frank McLaury worked with the rustlers buying and selling stolen cattle. Many of the rural ranchers and Cowboys resented the growing influence of the city residents over county politics and law enforcement. The ranchers largely maintained control of the country outside Tombstone, due in large part to the sympathetic support of Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, who favored the Cowboys and rural ranchers, and who also grew to intensely dislike the Earps. Behan tended to ignore the Earps' complaints about the McLaurys' and Clantons' horse thieving and cattle rustling. The Earps were known to bend the law in their favor when it affected their gambling and saloon interests, which earned them further enmity with the Cowboy faction. = Relevant law in Tombstone = To reduce crime in Tombstone, on April 19, 1881, the city council passed ordinance 9, requiring anyone carrying a bowie knife, dirk, pistol or rifle to deposit their weapons at a livery or saloon soon after entering town. The ordinance was the legal basis for City Marshal Virgil Earp's decision to confront the Cowboys on the day of the shootout. From Turner, Alford (ed.) (1992), The O. K. Corral Inquest. = Smuggling and stock thefts = In the borderlands south of Tombstone there was only one passable route between Arizona and Mexico, a passage known as Guadalupe Canyon. In August 1881, 15 Mexicans carrying gold, coins and bullion to make their purchases were ambushed and killed in Skeleton Canyon. The next month Mexican Commandant Felipe Neri dispatched troops to the border, where they killed five Cowboys, including Old Man Clanton, in Guadalupe Canyon. The Earps knew that the McLaurys and Clantons were reputed to be mixed up in the robbery and murder in Skeleton Canyon. Wyatt Earp said in his testimony after the shootout, \\"I naturally kept my eyes open and did not intend that any of the gang should get the drop on me if I could help it.\\" = Earp loses sheriff's office to Behan = Pima County Sheriff Charles A. Shibell appointed Wyatt Earp as deputy sheriff over eastern Pima County. On July 27, 1880, Pima County Sheriff Charles A. Shibell, whose offices were in the county seat of Tucson, appointed Wyatt Earp as deputy sheriff. On October 28, 1880, Tombstone Marshal Fred White attempted to disarm some late-night revelers who were shooting their pistols in the air. When he attempted to disarm Curly Bill Brocius, the gun discharged, striking White in the abdomen. Wyatt saw the shooting and pistol-whipped Brocius, knocking him unconscious, and arrested him. Wyatt later told his biographer John Flood that he thought Brocius was still armed at the time, and didn't see Brocius' pistol on the ground.John H. Flood Manuscript, 1926, p.85 Brocius waived the preliminary hearing so he and his case could be immediately transferred to Tucson. Wyatt and a deputy took Brocius in a wagon the next day to Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from being lynched. Wyatt testified that he thought the shooting was accidental. It was also demonstrated that Brocius's pistol could be fired from half-cock. Fred White left a statement before he died two days later that the shooting was not intentional. Based on the evidence presented, Brocius was not charged with White's death. The Tombstone council convened and appointed Virgil Earp as \\"temporary assistant city marshal\\" to replace White for a salary of $100 per month () until an election could be held on November 12. For the next few weeks, Virgil represented federal and local law enforcement and Wyatt represented Pima County. In the November 2, 1880 election for Pima County sheriff, Democrat Shibell ran against Republican Bob Paul, who was expected to win. Votes arrived as late as November 7, and Shibell was unexpectedly reelected. He immediately appointed Johnny Behan as the new deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County, a job that Wyatt wanted. A controversy ensued when Paul uncovered ballot-stuffing by Cowboys and he sued to overturn the election. Paul finally became sheriff in April 1881, but it was too late to reappoint Wyatt Earp as deputy sheriff because on January 1, 1881, the eastern portion of Pima County containing Tombstone had been split off into the new Cochise County, which would need its own sheriff, based in the county's largest city, Tombstone. This position was filled by a political appointment from the governor, and Wyatt and Behan both wanted the job. The Cochise County sheriff's position was worth more than $40,000 a year (equivalent to $ million in ) because the office holder was also county assessor and tax collector, and the board of supervisors allowed him to keep ten percent of the amounts paid. Behan utilized his existing position and his superior political connections to successfully lobby for the position. He also promised Wyatt a position as his undersheriff if he was appointed over Wyatt. Wyatt withdrew from the political contest and the governor and legislature appointed Behan to the job of Cochise County sheriff on February 10, 1881. Behan reneged on his deal with Earp and appointed Harry Woods as undersheriff instead. Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because Wyatt Earp used Behan's name to threaten Ike Clanton when Wyatt recovered his stolen horse from Clanton.  Earp conflicts with Cowboys  Tensions between the Earp family and both the Clanton and McLaury clans increased through 1881. On July 25, 1880, Captain Joseph H. Hurst, of Company A, 12th Infantry, and Commanding Officer of Fort Bennett, asked Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp to help him track Cowboys who had stolen six U.S. Army mules from Camp Rucker. This was a federal matter because the animals were U.S. property. Hurst brought four soldiers, and Virgil invited Wyatt and Morgan Earp, as well as Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams. The posse found the mules on the McLaury's Ranch on Babacomari Creek, northwest of Tombstone, as well as the branding iron used to change the \\"US\\" brand to \\"D8.\\" To avoid bloodshed, Cowboy Frank Patterson promised Hurst they would return the mules and Hurst persuaded the posse to withdraw. Hurst went to nearby Charleston, but the Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules, laughing at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Hurst had printed and distributed a handbill in which he named Frank McLaury as specifically assisting with hiding the mules. He reprinted this in The Tombstone Epitaph on July 30, 1880. Virgil later said that McLaury had asked him if he had posted the handbills. When Virgil said he had not, McLaury said if Virgil had printed the handbills it was Frank's intention to kill Virgil. He warned Virgil, \\"If you ever again follow us as close as you did, then you will have to fight anyway.\\" This incident was the first run-in between the Clantons and McLaurys and the Earps. = March stagecoach robbery and murder = A Kinnear Express stagecoach operating from Tombstone to Bisbee in the 1880s. This thoroughbrace stagecoach used thick leather straps to support the body of the carriage and serve as shock- absorbing springs. On the evening of March 15, 1881, a Kinnear & Company stagecoach carrying $26,000 in silver bullion () was en route from Tombstone to Benson, Arizona, the nearest freight terminal. Bob Paul, who had run for Pima County Sheriff and was contesting the election he lost due to ballot- stuffing, was temporarily working once again as the Wells Fargo shotgun messenger. He had taken the reins and driver's seat in Contention City because the usual driver, a well-known and popular man named Eli \\"Bud\\" Philpot, was ill. Philpot was riding shotgun. Near Drew's Station, just outside Contention City, a man stepped into the road and commanded them to \\"Hold!\\" Three Cowboys attempted to rob the stage. Paul, in the driver's seat, fired his shotgun and emptied his revolver at the robbers, wounding a Cowboy later identified as Bill Leonard in the groin. Philpot, riding shotgun, and passenger Peter Roerig, riding in the rear dickey seat, were both shot and killed. The horses spooked and Paul wasn't able to bring the stage under control for almost , leaving the robbers with nothing. Paul, who normally rode shotgun, later said he thought the first shot killing Philpot had been meant for him.  Suspects identified  Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson in 1876 as lawmen in Dodge City, Kansas Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp, along with temporary federal deputies Wyatt and Morgan Earp, Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams, former Kansas Sheriff Bat Masterson (who was dealing faro at the Oriental Saloon), and County Sheriff Behan set out to find the robbers. Wells Fargo issued a wanted poster offering a $3,600 reward () for the three robbers ($1,200 each), dead or alive. Robbery of a mail-carrying stagecoach was both a federal crime and territorial crime, and the posse consisted of both county and federal authorities and deputies. The posse trailed the robbers to a nearby ranch where they found a drifter named Luther King. He wouldn't tell who his confederates were until the posse lied and told him that Doc Holliday's girlfriend had been shot. Fearful of Holliday's reputation, he confessed to holding the reins of the robbers' horses, and identified Bill Leonard, Harry \\"The Kid\\" Head and Jim Crane as the robbers. They were all known Cowboys and rustlers. Behan and Williams escorted King back to Tombstone.  Suspect escapes Behan's jail  Somehow King walked in the front door of the jail and a few minutes later out the back. King had arranged with Undersheriff Harry Woods (publisher of the Nugget) to sell the horse he had been riding to John Dunbar, Sheriff Behan's partner in the Dexter Livery Stable. On March 19, King conveniently escaped while Dunbar and Woods were making out the bill-of-sale. Woods claimed that someone had deliberately unlocked a secured back door to the jail. The Earps and the townspeople were furious at King's easy escape. Williams was later dismissed from Wells Fargo, leaving behind a number of debts, when it was determined he had been stealing from the company for years.  Earp pursues suspects  The Earps pursued the other two men for 17 days, riding for 60 hours without food and 36 hours without water, during which Bob Paul's horse died, and Wyatt and Morgan's horses became so weak that the two men walked back to Tombstone to obtain new horses. After pursuing the Cowboys for over they could not obtain more fresh horses and were forced to give up the chase. They returned to Tombstone on April 1. Behan submitted a bill for $796.84 () to the county for posse expenses, but he refused to reimburse the Earps for any of their costs. Virgil was incensed. They were finally reimbursed by Wells, Fargo & Co. later on, but the incident caused further friction between county and federal law enforcement, and between Behan and the Earps.  Wyatt offers Ike reward money  After he was passed over by Johnny Behan for the position of undersheriff, Wyatt thought he might beat him in the next Cochise County election in late 1882. He thought catching the murderers of Bud Philpot and Peter Roerig would help him win the sheriff's office. Wyatt later said that on June 2, 1881 he offered the Wells, Fargo & Co. reward money and more to Ike Clanton if he would provide information leading to the capture or death of the stage robbers. According to Wyatt, Ike was initially interested, but the plan was foiled when the three suspects‚ÄîLeonard, Head and Crane‚Äîwere killed in unrelated incidents. Ike began to fear that word of his possible cooperation had leaked, threatening to compromise his standing among the Cowboys. Undercover Wells Fargo Company agent M. Williams suspected a deal, and said something to Ike, who was fearful that other Cowboys might learn of his double-cross. Ike now began to threaten Wyatt and Doc Holliday (who had learned of the deal) for apparently revealing Ike's willingness to help arrest his friends.  Earp, Cowboy fallout  The fallout over the Cowboys' attempt to implicate Holliday and the Earps in the robbery, along with Behan's involvement in King's escape, was the beginning of increasingly bad feelings between the Earp brothers and Cowboy factions. = Earp and Behan attracted to Josephine Marcus = Wyatt Earp and Cochise County sheriff Johnny Behan were interested in the same sheriff's position and also may have shared an interest in the same woman, Josephine Marcus, known as Sadie. Citizens of Tombstone believed that Behan and Sadie were married, but Behan was a known womanizer and had sex with prostitutes and other women. In early 1881, Sadie ended the relationship after she came home and found Behan in bed with the wife of a friend and kicked him out, although she used the Behan surname through the end of that summer. She rented her home sometime before April 1881 to Dr. George Goodfellow. Wyatt Earp lived with Mattie Blaylock, who was listed as his wife in the 1880 census. She had a growing addiction to the easily available opiate laudanum. Earp remained with Blaylock until he left Tombstone in April 1882. There are no contemporary Tombstone records that indicate a relationship between Sadie and Earp, but Earp certainly knew her, because both Behan and Earp had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon. Sadie, traveling as either Mrs. J. C. Earp or Mrs. Wyatt Earp, left for Los Angeles on March 25, 1882, and then returned to her family in San Francisco. In July 1882, Wyatt left Colorado and went to San Francisco, where he sought out Sadie and his brother Virgil, who was seeking treatment for his arm. In February or March 1883, Sadie and Earp left San Francisco for Gunnison, where Earp ran a Faro bank until he received a request in April for assistance from Luke Short in Dodge City. Sadie was his common-law wife for the next 46 years. = September stage holdup = Tensions between the Earps and the McLaurys further increased when another passenger stage on the 'Sandy Bob Line' in the Tombstone area, bound for Bisbee, was held up on September 8, 1881. The masked bandits robbed all of the passengers of their valuables since the stage was not carrying a strongbox. During the robbery, the driver heard one of the robbers describe the money as \\"sugar\\", a phrase known to be used by Frank Stilwell. Stilwell had until the prior month been a deputy for Sheriff Behan but had been fired for \\"accounting irregularities\\". Tom McLaury Wyatt and Virgil Earp rode with a sheriff's posse and tracked the Bisbee stage robbers. Virgil had been appointed Tombstone's town marshal (i.e., chief of police) on June 6, 1881, after Ben Sippy abandoned the job. However, Virgil at the same time continued to hold his position of deputy U.S. marshal, and it was in this federal capacity that he continued to chase robbers of stage coaches outside Tombstone city limits. At the scene of the holdup, Wyatt discovered an unusual boot print left by someone wearing a custom-repaired boot heel. The Earps checked a shoe repair shop in Bisbee known to provide widened boot heels and were able to link the boot print to Stilwell.  Stilwell and Spence arrests  Frank Stilwell had just arrived in Bisbee with his livery stable partner, Pete Spence, when the two were arrested by Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp for the holdup. Both were friends of Ike Clanton and the McLaurys. At the preliminary hearing, Stilwell and Spence were able to provide several witnesses who supported their alibis. Judge Spicer dropped the charges for insufficient evidence just as he had done for Doc Holliday earlier in the year. Released on bail, Spence and Stilwell were re-arrested October 13 by Marshal Virgil Earp for the Bisbee robbery on a new federal charge of interfering with a mail carrier. The newspapers, however, reported that they had been arrested for a different stage robbery that occurred on October 8 near Contention City. Ike and other Cowboys believed the new arrest was further evidence that the Earps were illegally persecuting the Cowboys. They told the Earps that they could expect retaliation. While Virgil and Wyatt were in Tucson for the federal hearing on the charges against Spence and Stilwell, Frank McLaury confronted Morgan Earp. He told him that the McLaurys would kill the Earps if they tried to arrest Spence, Stilwell, or the McLaurys again. The Tombstone Epitaph reported \\"that since the arrest of Spence and Stilwell, veiled threats [are] being made that the friends of the accused will 'get the Earps.'\\"  Cowboys accuse Holliday of robbery  Milt Joyce, a county supervisor and owner of the Oriental Saloon, had a contentious relationship with Doc Holliday. In October 1880, Holliday had trouble with a gambler named Johnny Tyler in Milt Joyce's Oriental Saloon. Tyler had been hired by a competing gambling establishment to drive customers from Joyce's saloon. Holliday challenged Tyler to a fight, but Tyler ran. Joyce did not like Holliday or the Earps and he continued to argue with Holliday. Joyce ordered Holliday removed from the saloon but would not return Holliday's revolver. But Holliday returned carrying a double-action revolver. Milt brandished a pistol and threatened Holliday, but Holliday shot Joyce in the palm, disarming him, and then shot Joyce's business partner William Parker in the big toe. Joyce then hit Holliday over the head with his revolver.The Daily Nugget, October 12, 1880 Holliday was arrested and pleaded guilty to assault and battery. Holliday and his on-again, off-again mistress Big Nose Kate had many fights. After a particularly nasty, drunken argument, Holliday kicked her out. County Sheriff John Behan and Milt Joyce saw an opportunity and exploited the situation. They plied Big Nose Kate with more booze and suggested to her a way to get even with Holliday. She signed an affidavit implicating Holliday in the attempted stagecoach robbery and murders. Holliday was a good friend of Bill Leonard, a former watchmaker from New York, one of three men implicated in the robbery. Judge Wells Spicer issued an arrest warrant for Holliday. The Earps found witnesses who could attest to Holliday's location at the time of the murders and Kate sobered up, revealing that Behan and Joyce had influenced her to sign a document she didn't understand. With the Cowboy plot revealed, Spicer freed Holliday. The district attorney threw out the charges, labeling them \\"ridiculous.\\" Doc gave Kate some money and put her on a stage out of town. = Ike Clanton's conflict with Doc Holliday = Wyatt Earp testified after the gunfight that five or six weeks prior he had met Ike Clanton outside the Alhambra Hotel. Ike told Wyatt that Doc Holliday had told him he knew of Ike's meetings with Wyatt and about Ike providing information on Head, Leonard, and Crane, as well as their attempted robbery of the stage. Ike now accused Earp of telling Holliday about these conversations. Earp testified that he told Ike he had not told Holliday anything. Wyatt Earp offered to prove this when Holliday and the Clantons next returned to town. A month later, the weekend before the shootout, Morgan Earp was concerned about possible trouble with the Cowboys. He asked Doc Holliday to come back to Tombstone from a fiesta celebration in Tucson where Holliday had been gambling. Upon his return, Wyatt Earp asked Holliday about Ike's accusation. On the morning of Tuesday, October 25, 1881, the day before the gunfight, Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury drove in a spring wagon from Chandler's Milk Ranch at the foot of the Dragoon Mountains to Tombstone. They were in town to sell a large number of beef stock, most of them owned by the McLaurys. Fred Dodge, an undercover detective for Wells Fargo, heard from J.B. Ayers, another undercover Wells Fargo man in Contention, that Frank MacLaury, Billy Clanton, and Billy Claiborne were in town and planning to join Ike and Tom in Tombstone Wednesday afternoon. Dodge, who had been sick, got up and went looking for city marshal Virgil Earp. He found Tombstone Deputy City Marshal Morgan Earp at the Alhambra Saloon instead and told him the news. Near midnight, Holliday saw Clanton in the Alhambra Saloon and confronted Ike, accusing him of lying about their previous conversations. They got into a heated argument. Wyatt Earp (who was not wearing a badge) encouraged his brother Morgan to intervene. Morgan took Holliday out onto the street and Ike, who had been drinking steadily, followed them. City Marshal Virgil Earp arrived a few minutes later and threatened to arrest both Holliday and Clanton if they did not stop arguing. Wyatt Earp walked over to the Oriental Saloon and Ike followed him. They talked again, and Ike threatened to confront Holliday in the morning. Ike told Earp that the fighting talk had been going on for a long time and that he intended to put an end to it. Ike told Earp, \\"I will be ready for you in the morning.\\" Wyatt told Ike to go home \\"because there was no money in it.\\" Ike sat down near Wyatt, his revolver in plain sight, and told Earp \\"You must not think I won't be after you all in the morning.\\" Virgil Earp went to the Occidental Saloon across the street.  Morning of the gunfight  = Events leading up to the Ike Clanton court hearing = O.K. Corral after a fire in 1882 After Holliday's confrontation with Ike Clanton, Wyatt Earp took Holliday back to his room at Camillus Sidney \\"Buck\\" Fly's Lodging House to sleep off his drinking, then went home and to bed. Tombstone Marshal Virgil Earp played poker with Ike Clanton, Tom McLaury, Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan and a fifth unnamed man in a back room of the Occidental Saloon until morning. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) At about dawn on October 26, the card game broke up and Behan and Virgil Earp went home to bed. Ike Clanton testified later he saw Virgil take his six-shooter out of his lap and stick it in his pants when the game ended. Not having rented a room, Tom McLaury and Ike Clanton had no place to go. Shortly after 8:00 am barkeeper E. F. Boyle spoke to Ike Clanton in front of the telegraph office. Clanton had been drinking all night and Boyle encouraged him to get some sleep, but Ike insisted he would not go to bed. Boyle later testified he noticed Ike was armed and covered his gun for him. Boyle later said that Ike told him, \\"'As soon as the Earps and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street, the ball would open‚Äîthat they would have to fight' ... I went down to Wyatt Earp's house and told him that Ike Clanton had threatened that when Wyatt, his brothers, and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street that the ball would open.\\" From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) Ike said in his testimony afterward that he remembered neither meeting Boyle nor making any such statements that day. Deputy Marshal Andy Bronk also heard the talk around town. He woke Virgil, who listened, and went back to sleep. Ike's ongoing threats were not worth losing sleep. Later in the morning, Ike picked up his rifle and revolver from the West End Corral, where he had deposited his weapons and stabled his wagon and team after entering town. By noon that day, Ike was still drinking and once again armed, in violation of the city ordinance against carrying firearms in the city. He told anyone who would listen he was looking for Holliday or an Earp. At Fly's boarding house where Holliday and his common-law wife Mary Katharine Horony were sleeping, proprietor Mary Fly heard Clanton's threats and banged on Holliday's door. Fly told Horony, \\"Ike Clanton was here looking for [Holliday], and he had a rifle with him.\\" Horony woke Holliday and relayed the threat, who replied, \\"If God will let me live to get my clothes on, he will see me.\\" At about 1:00 pm, Marshal Virgil and his Deputy Morgan Earp found Ike on 4th Street, still armed, and Virgil pistol whipped him from behind. Disarming him, the Earps took Ike to appear before Justice of the Peace A.O. Wallace for violating the ordinance. Wyatt waited with Clanton while Virgil went to find Justice Wallace so a court hearing could be held. = Ike Clanton court hearing = Morgan Earp While Wyatt waited for Virgil to return with Justice Wallace, witnesses overheard Wyatt tell Clanton, \\"You cattle thieving son-of-a-bitch, and you know that I know you are a cattle thieving son-of-a-bitch, you've threatened my life enough, and you've got to fight!\\", Ike Clanton was hear to reply, \\"Fight is my racket, and all I want is of ground!\\" From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) Ike reported in his testimony afterward that Wyatt Earp cursed him. He said Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan offered him his rifle and to fight him right there in the courthouse, which Ike declined. Ike also denied ever threatening the Earps. Justice Wallace fined Ike $25 () plus court costs. Ike paid the fine and Virgil told Ike he could pick up his confiscated rifle and revolver at the Grand Hotel, which was favored by Cowboys when in town. Ike testified that he picked up the weapons from William Soule, the jailer, a couple of days later. = Tom McLaury's concealed weapon = Pete Spence, an alias for Elliot Larkin Ferguson, in an 1893 Yuma Penitentiary prison mugshot Outside the court house where Ike was being fined, Tombstone Deputy Marshal Wyatt almost walked into 28 year-old Tom McLaury as the two men were brought up short nose-to-nose. Tom, who had arrived in town the day before, was required by the well-known city ordinance to deposit his pistol when he first arrived in town. When Wyatt demanded, \\"Are you heeled or not?\\", McLaury said he was not armed. Wyatt testified that he saw a revolver in plain sight on the right hip of Tom's pants. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) As an unpaid deputy marshal for Virgil, Wyatt habitually carried a pistol in his waistband, as was the custom of that time. Witnesses reported that Wyatt drew his revolver from his coat pocket and pistol whipped Tom McLaury with it twice, leaving him prostrate and bleeding on the street. Saloon-keeper Andrew Mehan testified at the Spicer hearing afterward that he saw McLaury deposit a revolver at the Capital Saloon sometime between 1:00‚Äì2:00 pm, after the confrontation with Wyatt, which Mehan also witnessed. Wyatt said in his deposition afterward that he had been temporarily acting as city marshal for Virgil the week before while Virgil was in Tucson for the Pete Spence and Frank Stilwell trial. Wyatt said that he still considered himself a deputy city marshal, which Virgil later confirmed. Since Wyatt was an off-duty officer, he could not legally search or arrest Tom for carrying a revolver within the city limits-‚Äîa misdemeanor offense. Only Virgil or one of his city police deputies, including Morgan Earp and possibly Warren Earp, could search him and take any required action. Wyatt, who was portrayed as a non-drinker, testified at the Spicer hearing that he went to Haffords and bought a cigar and went outside to watch the Cowboys. At the time of the gunfight about two hours later, Wyatt could not know if Tom was still armed. It was early afternoon by the time Ike and Tom had seen doctors for their head wounds. The day was chilly, with snow still on the ground in some places. Both Tom and Ike had spent the night gambling, drinking heavily, and without sleep. Now they were both out-of-doors, both wounded from head beatings, and at least Ike was still drunk. = More Cowboys enter town = Frank McLaury At around 1:30‚Äì2:00 pm, after Tom had been pistol-whipped by Wyatt, Ike's 19-year-old younger brother Billy Clanton and Tom's older brother Frank McLaury arrived in town. They had heard from their neighbor, Ed \\"Old Man\\" Frink, that Ike had been stirring up trouble in town overnight, and they had ridden into town on horseback to back up their brothers. They arrived from Antelope Springs, east of Tombstone, where they had been rounding up stock and had breakfasted with Ike and Tom the day before. Both Frank and Billy were armed with a revolver and a rifle, as was the custom for riders in the country outside Tombstone. Apache warriors had engaged the U.S. Army near Tombstone just three weeks before the O.K. Corral gunfight, so the need for weapons outside of town was well established and accepted. Billy and Frank stopped first at the Grand Hotel on Allen Street, and were greeted by Doc Holliday. They learned immediately after of their brothers' beatings by the Earps within the previous two hours. The incidents had generated a lot of talk in town. Angrily, Frank said he would not drink, and he and Billy left the saloon immediately to seek Tom. By law, both Frank and Billy should have left their firearms at the Grand Hotel. Instead, they remained fully armed. = Virgil and Wyatt Earp's reactions = Wyatt said that he saw Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury in Spangenberger's gun and hardware store on 4th Street filling their gun belts with cartridges. Ike testified afterward that Tom was not there and that he had tried to buy a new revolver but the owner saw Ike's bandaged head and refused to sell him one. Ike apparently had not heard Virgil tell him that his confiscated weapons were at the Grand Hotel around the corner from Spangenberger's shop. When Virgil Earp learned that Wyatt was talking to the Cowboys at Spangenberg's gun shop, he went there himself. Virgil testified afterward that he thought he saw all four men, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury, buying cartridges. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) Virgil went around the corner on Allen Street to the Wells Fargo office, where he picked up a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun. It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat. To avoid alarming Tombstone's public, Virgil hid the shotgun under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford's Saloon. From Spangenberg's, the Cowboys moved to the O.K. Corral where witnesses overheard them threatening to kill the Earps. For unknown reasons the Cowboys then walked out the back of the O.K. Corral and then west, stopping in a narrow, empty lot next to C. S. Fly's boarding house. Virgil initially avoided a confrontation with the newly arrived Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton, who had not yet deposited their weapons at a hotel or stable as the law required. The statute was not specific about how far a recently arrived visitor might \\"with good faith, and within reasonable time\\" travel into town while carrying a firearm. This permitted a traveler to keep his firearms if he was proceeding directly to a livery, hotel or saloon. The three main Tombstone corrals were all west of 4th street between Allen and Fremont, a block or two from where Wyatt saw the Cowboys buying cartridges. Miner Ruben F. Coleman later told The Tombstone Epitaph: = Behan attempts to disarm Cowboys = Johnny Behan Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, a friend of the Cowboys, later testified that he woke up about 1:30 pm after the late-night card game, and went to get a shave at a barbershop. That's where he first learned that the Cowboys were armed. Behan stated he quickly finished his shave and went to locate the Cowboys. At about 2:30 pm he found Frank McLaury holding a horse and talking to someone on Fourth Street near the corner of Fremont. When he saw Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury near C. S. Fly's photography studio, he walked there with Frank. He told the Cowboys that they must give up their arms. Ike Clanton said he was not armed, and Tom McLaury pulled his coat open to show he was not carrying a weapon. The Cowboys were located in a narrow lot between the Harwood house and Fly's 12-room boarding house and photography studio at 312 Fremont Street, where Doc Holliday roomed. Behan later said he attempted to persuade Frank McLaury to give up his weapons, but Frank insisted that he would give up his guns only after City Marshal Virgil Earp and his brothers were first disarmed. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) The Cowboys were about a block and a half from the West End Corral at 2nd Street and Fremont, where Ike and Tom's wagon and team were stabled. Virgil Earp later testified that he thought Ike and Tom were stabled at the O.K. Corral on Allen between 3rd and 4th, from which he thought they would be departing if they were leaving town. While Ike Clanton later said he was planning to leave town, Frank McLaury reported that he had decided to remain behind to take care of some business. Will McLaury, Tom and Frank's brother and a judge in Fort Worth, Texas, claimed in a letter he wrote during the preliminary hearing after the shootout that Tom and Frank were still armed because they were planning to conduct business before leaving town to visit him in Texas. He wrote that Billy Clanton, who had arrived on horseback with Frank, intended to go with the McLaurys to Fort Worth. Will McLaury came to Tombstone after the gun fight and joined the prosecution team in an attempt to convict the Earps and Holliday for his brothers' murder. Paul Johnson told a different story, that the McLaurys were about to leave for Iowa to attend the wedding of their sister, Sarah Caroline, in Iowa. Tom and Frank were especially close to Sarah, one of their 14 siblings and half-siblings. Caroline married James Reed in Richland, Iowa at the end of November that year. = Virgil decides to disarm Cowboys = Citizens reported to Virgil on the Cowboys' movements and their threats told him that Ike and Tom had left their livery stable and entered town while armed, in violation of the city ordinance. Virgil Earp was told by several citizens that the McLaurys and the Clantons had gathered on Fremont Street. Virgil decided he had to disarm the Cowboys. His decision to take action may have been influenced by the Cowboy's repeated threats to the Earps, their proximity to Holliday's room in Fly's boarding house, and their location on the route the Earps usually took to their homes two blocks further west on Fremont Street. Several members of the citizen's vigilance committee offered to support him with arms, but Virgil refused. He had during the prior month appointed Morgan as a Special Policeman. He had also appointed Wyatt as a Special Policeman while Virgil had been in Prescott on business. He had also called on Doc Holliday that morning for help with disarming the Clantons and McLaurys. Wyatt spoke of his brothers Virgil and Morgan as the \\"marshals\\" while he acted as \\"deputy.\\" Virgil Earp picked up the shotgun he had retrieved from the Wells Fargo office earlier. He gave the shotgun to Doc Holliday who hid it under his overcoat. He took Holliday's walking-stick in return. As usual, the Earps carried their revolvers in their coat pockets or in their waistbands. Wyatt Earp was carrying a .44 caliber American 1869 Smith & Wesson revolver. Holliday was carrying a nickel-plated pistol in a holster, but this was concealed by his long coat, as was the shotgun. The Earps and Holliday walked west, down the south side of Fremont Street past the rear entrance to the O.K. Corral, but out of visual range of the Cowboys' last reported location. Near the corner of Fourth St. and Fremont St., the Earps ran into Sheriff Behan. He had left the Cowboys and came toward them, though he looked nervously backward several times. Virgil testified afterward that Behan told them, \\"For God's sake, don't go down there or they will murder you!\\" Wyatt said Behan told him and Morgan, \\"I have disarmed them.\\" Behan testified afterward that he'd only said he'd gone down to the Cowboys \\"for the purpose of disarming them,\\" not that he'd actually disarmed them. One eyewitness, laundryman Peter H. Fallehy, wrote in his testimony afterward that Virgil Earp told Behan, \\"those men have made their threats and I will not arrest them but I will kill them on sight.\\" When Behan said he had disarmed them, Virgil attempted to avoid a fight. \\"I had a walking stick in my left hand and my hand was on my six-shooter in my waist pants, and when he said he had disarmed them, I shoved it clean around to my left hip and changed my walking stick to my right hand.\\" Wyatt said I \\"took my pistol, which I had in my hand, under my coat, and put it in my overcoat pocket.\\" The Earps walked further down Fremont street and came into full view of the Cowboys in the lot. Wyatt testified he saw \\"Frank McLaury, Tom McLaury, and Billy Clanton standing in a row against the east side of the building on the opposite side of the vacant space west of Fly's photograph gallery. Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne and a man I don't know [Wes Fuller] were standing in the vacant space about halfway between the photograph gallery and the next building west.\\" From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) Addie Bourland corroborated Wyatt's testimony, stating that she saw \\"five men opposite my house, leaning against a small house west of Fly's Gallery and one man was holding a horse, standing a little out from the house.\\"  The Gunfight  Annotated 1886 fire map of Tombstone indicating the actual shootout location (in green) and the O.K. Corral (in yellow) on the other side of the block Third St. in Tombstone, Arizona in 1909 from the roof of the Cochise County Courthouse. The O.K. Corral was located on Allen St., the first right turn off Third St. The white building at the center right is Schiefflin Hall on Fremont St. Martha J. King was in Bauer's butcher shop located on Fremont Street. She testified that when the Earp party passed by her location, one of the Earps on the outside of the group looked across and said to Doc Holliday nearest the store, \\"... let them have it!\\" to which Holliday replied, \\"All right.\\" From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) = Physical proximity = When the Earps approached the lot, the four law men initially faced six Cowboys: Frank McLaury, Tom McLaury, Billy Clanton, Billy Claiborne, Wes Fuller, and Ike Clanton. When the Cowboys saw the officers, they stepped away from the Harwood house. In testimony given by witnesses afterward, they disagreed about the precise location of the men before, during and after the gunfight. The coroner's inquest and the Spicer hearing produced a sketch showing the Cowboys standing, from left to right facing Fremont Street, with Billy Clanton and then Frank McLaury near the Harwood house and Tom McLaury and Ike Clanton roughly in the middle of the lot. Opposite them and initially only about away, Virgil Earp was on the left end of the Earp party, standing a few feet inside the vacant lot and nearest Ike Clanton. Behind him a few feet near the corner of C. S. Fly's boarding house was Wyatt. Morgan Earp was standing on Fremont Street to Wyatt's right, and Doc Holliday anchored the end of their line in Fremont Street, a few feet to Morgan's right. Wyatt Earp drew a sketch in 1924 and another with John Flood on September 15, 1926 that depicted Billy Clanton near the middle of the lot, close to the Harwood house. Tom and Frank McLaury stood deeper in the lot. Frank was in the center between the two buildings, holding the reins of his horse. Tom was closer to C. S. Fly's boarding house. According to Wyatt's sketches, Morgan was on the right of the lawmen, close to the Harwood house, opposite Billy Clanton near the Harwood house and close to Fremont St. Virgil was deeper in the lot, opposite Frank and Ike Clanton. Wyatt was to Virgil's left, opposite Tom. Doc Holliday hung back a step or two on Fremont Street. Neither of Wyatt's sketches included Ike Clanton or Billy Claiborne, who ran from the fight. = Gun battle begins = Wyatt Earp 19 months after the famous gunfight, during the bloodless Dodge City War Virgil Earp was not expecting a fight. Once Behan said that he'd disarmed the Cowboys, Virgil traded the short, double-barreled shotgun he was carrying for Holliday's cane. Virgil carried the cane in his right hand and shifted the pistol in his waistband from the right side to his left. Holliday concealed the short shotgun under his long jacket. Wyatt too was not expecting a fight and put his pistol in his overcoat pocket. Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury wore revolvers in holsters on their belts and stood alongside their saddled horses with rifles in their scabbards, possibly in violation of the city ordinance prohibiting carrying weapons in town. When Virgil saw the Cowboys, he testified, he immediately commanded the Cowboys to \\"Throw up your hands, I want your guns!\\" Wyatt said Virgil told the Cowboys, \\"Throw up your hands; I have come to disarm you!\\" Virgil and Wyatt both testified they saw Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton draw and cock their single action six shot revolvers. Virgil yelled: \\"Hold! I don't mean that!\\" or \\"Hold on, I don't want that!\\" Jeff Morey, who served as the historical consultant on the film Tombstone, compared testimony by partisan and neutral witnesses and came to the conclusion that the Earps described the situation accurately. Who started shooting first is not certain; accounts by both participants and eyewitnesses are contradictory. The smoke from the black powder used in the weapons added to the confusion of the gunfight in the narrow space. Those loyal to one side or the other told conflicting stories, and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first. The six or seven men with guns fired about 30 shots in around 30 seconds. ; First two shots Virgil Earp reported afterward, \\"Two shots went off right together. Billy Clanton's was one of them.\\" Wyatt testified, \\"Billy Clanton leveled his pistol at me, but I did not aim at him. I knew that Frank McLaury had the reputation of being a good shot and a dangerous man, and I aimed at Frank McLaury.\\" He said he shot Frank McLaury after both he and Billy Clanton went for their revolvers: \\"The first two shots were fired by Billy Clanton and myself, he shooting at me, and I shooting at Frank McLaury.\\" Morey agreed that Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp fired first. Clanton missed, but Earp shot Frank McLaury in the stomach. All witnesses generally agreed that the first two shots were almost indistinguishable from each other. General firing immediately broke out. Virgil and Wyatt thought Tom was armed. When the shooting started, the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw his hand to his right hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse's movement, hiding behind it, and fired once or twice over the horse's back. ; Holliday shoots Tom According to one witness, Holliday drew a \\"large bronze pistol\\" (interpreted by some as Virgil's coach gun) from under his long coat, stepped around Tom McLaury's horse, and shot him with the double-barreled shotgun in the chest at close range. Witness C. H. \\"Ham\\" Light saw Tom running or stumbling westward on Fremont Street towards Third Street, away from the gunfight, while Frank and Billy were still standing and shooting. Light testified that Tom fell at the foot of a telegraph pole on the corner of Fremont and 3rd Street and lay there, without moving, through the duration of the fight. Fallehy also saw Tom stagger across the street until he fell on his back. After shooting Tom, Holliday tossed the empty shotgun aside, pulled out his nickel-plated revolver, and continued to fire at Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton. ; Cowboys run Ike Clanton had been publicly threatening to kill the Earps for several months, including very loud threats on the day before. Wyatt told the court afterward that Clanton had bragged that he would kill the Earps or Doc Holliday at his first opportunity. But when the gunfight broke out, Clanton ran forward and grabbed Wyatt, exclaiming that he was unarmed and did not want a fight. To this protest Wyatt said he responded, \\"Go to fighting or get away!\\" Clanton ran through the front door of Fly's boarding house and escaped, unwounded. Other accounts say that Ike drew a hidden pistol and fired at the Earps before disappearing. Like Ike, Billy Claiborne was unarmed. He and Cowboy Wes Fuller, who had been at the rear of the lot, also ran from the fight as soon as the shooting began. ; Billy Clanton shot According to The Tombstone Epitaph, \\"Wyatt Earp stood up and fired in rapid succession, as cool as a cucumber, and was not hit.\\" Morgan Earp fired almost immediately, as Billy Clanton drew his gun right-handed. Morgan's shot hit Billy in the right wrist, disabling his hand. Forced to shift the revolver to his left hand, Clanton continued shooting until he emptied the gun. Virgil and Wyatt were now firing. Morgan Earp tripped and fell over a newly buried waterline and fired from the ground. Wyatt shot Frank McLaury in the abdomen, and Frank took his horse by its reins and struggled across Fremont Street. He tried and failed to grab his rifle from the scabbard but lost control of the horse. Frank crossed Fremont Street firing his revolver instead. Frank and Holliday exchanged shots as Frank moved across Fremont Street, and Frank hit Holliday in his pistol pocket, grazing him. Holliday followed him, exclaiming, \\"That son of a bitch has shot me and I am going to kill him.\\" Morgan Earp picked himself up and also fired at Frank. Frank fell to the sidewalk on the east side of Fremont Street. A number of witnesses observed a man leading a horse into the street and firing near it and Wyatt in his testimony thought this was Tom McLaury. Claiborne said only one man had a horse in the fight, and that this man was Frank, holding his own horse by the reins, then losing it and its cover, in the middle of the street. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) Wes Fuller also identified Frank as the man in the street leading the horse. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) ;Morgan Earp wounded Though wounded, Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury kept shooting. One of them, perhaps Billy, shot Morgan Earp across the back in a wound that struck both shoulder blades and a vertebra. Morgan went down for a minute before picking himself up. Either Frank or Billy shot Virgil Earp in the calf (Virgil thought it was Billy). Virgil, though hit, fired his next shot at Billy Clanton. Frank, now entirely across Fremont street and still walking at a good pace according to Claiborne's testimony, fired twice more before he was shot in the head under his right ear. Both Morgan and Holliday apparently thought they had fired the shot that killed Frank, but since neither of them testified at the hearing, this information is only from second-hand accounts. A passerby testified to having stopped to help Frank, and saw Frank try to speak, but he died where he fell, before he could be moved. Billy Clanton was shot in the wrist, chest and abdomen, and after a minute or two slumped to a sitting position near his original position at the corner of the Harwood house in the lot between the house and Fly's Lodging House. Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the pistol supported on his leg. After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended. A few moments later, Tom McLaury was carried from the corner of Fremont and Third into the Harwood house on that corner, where he died without speaking. Passersby carried Billy Clanton to the Harwood house, where Tom had been taken. Billy was in considerable pain and asked for a doctor and some morphine. He told those near him, \\"They have murdered me. I have been murdered. Chase the crowd away and from the door and give me air.\\" Billy gasped for air, and someone else heard him say, \\"Go away and let me die.\\" Ike Clanton, who had repeatedly threatened the Earps with death, was still running. William Cuddy testified that Ike passed him on Allen Street and Johnny Behan saw him a few minutes later on Toughnut Street.  Outcome of the battle  Both Wyatt and Virgil believed Tom McLaury was armed and testified that he had fired at least one shot over the back of a horse. Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury exchanged gunfire with the lawmen. During the gunfight, Doc Holliday was bruised by a bullet fired by Frank that struck his holster and grazed his hip. Virgil Earp was shot through the calf, he thought by Billy Clanton. Morgan Earp was struck across both shoulder blades by a bullet that Morgan thought Frank McLaury had fired. Wyatt Earp was unhurt. Tom McLaury, his brother Frank, and Billy Clanton were killed. = Behan attempts arrest = As the wounded lawmen were carried to their homes, they passed in front of the Sheriff's Office, and Johnny Behan told Wyatt Earp, \\"I will have to arrest you.\\" Wyatt paused two or three seconds and replied very forcibly: \\"I won't be arrested today. I am right here and am not going away. You have deceived me. You told me these men were disarmed; I went to disarm them.\\" Dr. George Goodfellow treated the Earps' wounds. = Cowboy wounds = Dr. Henry M. Mathews examined the dead Cowboys late that night. He found Frank McLaury had two wounds: a gunshot beneath the right ear that horizontally penetrated his head, and a second entering his abdomen to the left of his navel. Mathews stated that the wound beneath the ear was at the base of the brain and caused instant death. Sheriff Behan testified that he had heard Morgan Earp yell \\"I got him\\" after Frank was shot. However, during the gunfight, Frank moved across Fremont street, putting Holliday on Frank's right and Morgan on his left. This makes it much more likely that Holliday shot the fatal round that killed Frank.The Daily Nugget, October 27, 1881 When he examined Tom McLaury's body, Mathews found twelve buckshot wounds from a single shotgun blast on the right side under his arm, between the third and fifth ribs. The wound was about across. The nature and location of the wound indicated that it could not have been received if Tom's hands were on his coat lapels as the Cowboys later testified. Both Virgil and Wyatt stated that Holliday had shot Tom, which the coroner's exam supported. Dr. George Goodfellow testified about Billy Clanton's wounds at the Spicer hearing. He stated that the angle of the wrist wound indicated that Billy's hand could not have been raised over his head as claimed by Cowboy witnesses. In his coroner's report, Mathews did not mention Billy's arm wound, but witness Keefe, who examined the arm closely, testified later that Clanton was shot through the right arm, close to the wrist joint and \\"the bullet passed through the arm from \\"inside to outside,\\" entering the arm close to the base of the thumb, and exiting \\"on the back of the wrist diagonally\\" with the latter wound larger. This indicated to the judge that Billy could not have been holding his coat's lapels open, his arms raised, as the Cowboys testified. Dr. Mathews found two other wounds on Billy's body. The first was from Clanton's left nipple, penetrated his lung. The other was in the abdomen beneath the twelfth rib, to the right of the navel. Both were fired from the front. Neither passed completely through his body. The wound to Billy Clanton's right wrist may have been inflicted by Morgan Earp or Doc Holliday immediately at the outset of the fight as Billy was drawing his gun. = Weapons carried by the Cowboys = ; Billy Clanton Billy Clanton was armed with Colt Frontier 1873 revolvers which were identified by their serial numbers at the Spicer hearing. C.S. Fly found Billy Clanton's empty revolver in his hand where he lay and took it from him. ; Frank McLaury Frank McLaury was also armed with a Colt Frontier 1873 revolver which was recovered by laundryman Fallehy on the street about from his body with two rounds remaining in it. Fallehy placed it next to Frank's body before he was moved to the Harwood house. Dr. Mathews laid Frank's revolver on the floor while he examined Billy and Tom. Cowboy witness Wes Fuller said he saw Frank in the middle of the street shooting a revolver and trying to remove a Winchester rifle from the scabbard on his horse. The two Model 1873 rifles were still in the scabbards on Frank and Tom McLaury's horses when they were found after the gunfight. If, as was customary, Frank carried only five rounds, then he had fired only three shots. ; Tom McLaury Witnesses differed about whether Tom McLaury was carrying a weapon during the shootout or not. No revolver or rifle was found near his body and he was not wearing a cartridge belt. Wyatt testified that he had arrested Tom earlier that day when he found him carrying a weapon earlier in violation of a city ordinance. He pistol-whipped him and took him to the courthouse where he was fined. Saloon-keeper Mehan testified that Tom had deposited his revolver at the Capital Saloon on 4th Street and Fremont after his arrest and before the fight, between 1 and 2 p.m. Several Cowboy witnesses testified that Tom was unarmed and claimed that the Earps had murdered a defenseless man. Behan testified that when he searched Tom McLaury for a weapon prior to the gunfight, he was not thorough, and that Tom might have had a pistol hidden in his waistband. Behan's testimony was significant, since he was a prime witness for the prosecution but had equivocated on this point. Behan's sympathy to the Cowboys was well known, and during the trial he firmly denied he had contributed money to help Ike with his defense costs. However, documents were located in 1997 that showed Behan served as guarantor for a loan to Ike Clanton during the Spicer hearing. Since Wyatt planned to run against Behan for County Sheriff, Behan had an incentive to help convict Wyatt. A story by Richard Rule in the Cowboy-friendly newspaper, the Nugget, told the story in the manner of the day, without attribution. Rule wrote, \\"The Sheriff stepped out and said [to the Earps]: 'Hold up boys, don't go down there or there will be trouble; I have been down there to disarm them.'\\" In his testimony, Behan repeatedly insisted he told the Earps that he only intended to disarm the Cowboys, not that he had actually done so. The article said that Behan \\"was standing near by commanding the contestants to cease firing but was powerless to prevent it.\\" The Nugget had a close relationship to Behan; it was owned by Harry Woods, who was also undersheriff to Behan, but Woods was collecting prisoners in El Paso, Texas, that day. So it is extremely likely that Rule interviewed Behan. Both Virgil and Williams' testified that Behan visited Virgil Earp that evening and said, ‚ÄúI am your friend, and you did perfectly right.‚Äù This corroborated the initial Nugget report, which upon Wood's return was altered to a version that favored the Cowboys and which Behan later supported in his testimony at the hearing. Though saloon-keeper Andrew Mehan had seen Tom deposit his pistol after his beating by Earp and before the gunfight, none of the Earps had any way of knowing that Tom had left his revolver at the saloon. Hotel keeper Albert \\"Chris\\" Billickie, whose father Charles owned the Cosmopolitan Hotel, saw Tom McLaury enter Bauer's butcher shop about 2:00 p.m. He testified that Tom's right-hand pants pocket was flat when he went in but protruded, as if it contained a pistol (so he thought), when he emerged. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) Retired army surgeon Dr. J. W. Gardiner also testified that he saw the bulge in Tom's pants. However, the bulge in Tom's pants pocket may have been the nearly $3,300 () in cash and receipts found on his body, perhaps in payment for stolen Mexican beef purchased by the butcher. Wyatt and Virgil Earp and Doc Holliday believed that Tom had a revolver at the time of the gunfight. Wyatt thought Tom fired a revolver under the horse's neck and believed until he died that Tom's revolver had been removed from the scene by Wesley Fuller. Witness Fallehy wrote that he saw Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday shooting at a man who was using a horse to barricade himself, and once shot the man fell. In his statement, Fallehy wrote that the man still held his pistol in his hand. Although he did not see him shoot, he thought Tom McLaury was armed. Ruben F. Coleman also said afterward that he thought Tom was armed, though he later equivocated on this point. He was quoted in the October 27 issue of The Tombstone Epitaph in which he said, \\"Tom McLaury fell first, but raised and fired again before he died.\\" Coleman also testified at the coroner's inquest one day later. Part-time newspaper reporter Howell 'Pat' Hayhurst transcribed all of the testimony from the hearing in the early 1930s as part of the Federal Writers' Project, in the Works Progress Administration. When he transcribed Coleman's second testimony, he quoted Coleman as saying, \\"Tom McLaury, after the first two shots were fired, ran down Fremont Street and fell ... I think that the report I gave to the Epitaph was pretty near correct as published.\\" However, it's known that Hayhurst arbitrarily removed text that he decided was not relevant. Author Stuart N. Lake later said Hayhurst 'mutilated' the transcription. The documents were subsequently lost and are still unaccounted for. Even if Tom wasn't armed with a revolver, Virgil Earp testified Tom attempted to grab a rifle from the scabbard on the horse in front of him before he was killed. Judge Spicer ruled afterward that \\"if Thomas McLaury was one of a party who were thus armed and were making felonious resistance to an arrest, and in the melee that followed was shot, the fact of his being unarmed, if it be a fact, could not of itself criminate the defendants [Earps], if they were not otherwise criminated.\\" ; Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne both said they were unarmed when they fled the gunfight.  Public reaction  Tom McLaury, Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton (left to right) in the window of the undertakers. This is the only known photo of 19-year-old Billy. Graves of Tom McLaury, Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton at Boot Hill The bodies of the three dead Cowboys were displayed in a window at Ritter and Reams undertakers with a sign: \\"Murdered in the Streets of Tombstone.\\" = Sympathy for Cowboys = The funerals for Billy Clanton (age 19), Tom McLaury (age 28) and his older brother Frank (age 33) were well attended. About 300 people joined in the procession to Boot Hill and as many as two thousand watched from the sidewalks. Both McLaurys were buried in the same grave, and Billy Clanton was buried nearby. The story was widely printed in newspapers across the United States. Most versions favored the lawmen. The headline in the San Francisco Exchange was, \\"A Good Riddance\\". Three days after the shootout, the ruling of the Coroner's Jury convened by Dr. Henry Matthews neither condemned nor exonerated the lawmen for shooting the Cowboys. \\"William Clanton, Frank and Thomas McLaury, came to their deaths in the town of Tombstone on October 26, 1881, from the effects of pistol and gunshot wounds inflicted by Virgil Earp, Morgan Earp, Wyatt Earp, and one‚ÄîHolliday, commonly called 'Doc Holliday'.\\" = Spicer hearings = Four days after the shootout, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against Doc Holliday and the Earps. Wyatt and Holliday were arrested and brought before Justice of the Peace, Wells Spicer. Morgan and Virgil were still recovering at home. Only Wyatt and Holliday were required to post $10,000 bail (), which was paid by their attorney Thomas Fitch, local mine owner E.B. Gage, Wells Fargo undercover agent Fred Dodge, and other business owners appreciative of the Earps' efforts to maintain order. Virgil Earp was suspended as town marshal pending the outcome of the trial. Justice Spicer convened a preliminary hearing on October 31 to determine if there was enough evidence to go to trial. The prosecution was led by Republican District Attorney Lyttleton Price, assisted by John M. Murphy, James Robinson, and Benoodrich. They were joined by William McLaury, Frank and Tom's older brother, he also being an able attorney, who played a key role on the prosecutor's team. The Earps' attorney Thomas Fitch was an experienced trial lawyer and had earned a reputation as the \\"silver-tongued orator of the Pacific.\\" Spicer took written and oral testimony from a number of witnesses over more than a month. Accounts by both participants and eye-witnesses were contradictory. Those loyal to one side or the other told conflicting stories and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first. Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan testified on the third day of the hearing. During two days on the stand, he gave strong testimony that the Cowboys had not resisted but either threw up their hands and turned out their coats to show they were not armed. Behan's views turned public opinion against the Earps, who were free on bail. He and other prosecution witnesses testified that Tom McLaury was unarmed, that Billy Clanton had his hands in the air, and that neither of the McLaurys were troublemakers. They portrayed Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury as being unjustly bullied and beaten by the vengeful Earps on the day of the gunfight. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) On the strength of the prosecution case, Spicer revoked the bail for Doc and Wyatt Earp and had them jailed on November 7. They spent the next 16 days in jail. Defense accounts contradicted the testimony of Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who all said that a man had fired a nickel-plated pistol first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun. (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing. Three witnesses gave key evidence that swayed Justice Spicer to hold that Virgil had acted within his capacity as town marshal and that there was insufficient evidence to indict the Earps and Doc Holliday for murder. H.F Sills was an AT&SF; RR engineer who had just arrived in town and knew none of the parties involved. He testified that he saw \\"the marshal go up and speak to this other party. I ... saw them pull out their revolvers immediately. The marshal had a cane in his right hand at the time. He throwed up his hand and spoke. I did not hear the words though. By that time Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp had fired their guns off.\\" Grilled by the prosecution, he corroborated virtually all of the defense's testimony. Addie Bourland was a dressmaker whose residence was across Fremont Street from Fly's Boarding House. She testified that she saw both sides facing each other, that none of the Cowboys had held their hands up, that the firing was general, and that she had not seen Billy Clanton fall immediately as the Cowboys had testified. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) Judge J.H. Lucas of the Cochise County Probate Court had offices in the Mining Exchange Building about from the shootout. Lucas' corroborated Addie Bourland's testimony that Billy Clanton was standing throughout the fight, which contradicted prosecution witnesses who maintained he went down immediately after being shot at close range in the belly. Spicer noted that no powder burns were found on his clothing. These witnesses' testimony, especially that of H.F. Sills, a disinterested party, discredited much of the testimony given by Sheriff Johnny Behan, Ike Clanton and the other Cowboy witnesses. After hearing all the evidence, Justice Spicer ruled on November 30 that Virgil, as the lawman in charge that day, had acted within his office and that there was not enough evidence to indict the men. He described Frank McLaury's insistence that he would not give up his weapons unless the marshal and his deputies also gave up their arms as a \\"proposition both monstrous and startling!\\" He noted that the prosecution claimed that the Cowboys' purpose was to leave town, yet Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne did not have their weapons with them. Spicer noted that the doctor who examined the dead Cowboys established that the wounds they received could not have occurred if their hands and arms had been in the positions that prosecution witnesses described. Spicer did not condone all of the Earps' actions and criticized Virgil Earp's use of Wyatt and Holliday as deputies, but he concluded that no laws were broken. He said the evidence indicated that the Earps and Holliday acted within the law and that Holliday and Wyatt had been properly deputized by Virgil Earp. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992)  In popular culture  The public perceptions were controversial concerning the Earp brothers' actions, and especially those of Wyatt. Even today, the brothers have strongly opinionated admirers and detractors. = Gunfight sketch = A hand-drawn sketch of the gunfight was made by John Flood with Wyatt Earp's assistance on September 15, 1921; it was sold at auction in October 2010 for $380,000. The map describes the position of a number of witnesses and all of the participants with the exception of Ike Clanton, who fled from the gunfight. = Paintings = In 1952, Victor Clyde Forsythe, a popular painter of desert scenes and cowboy artist, painted \\"Gunfight at O.K. Corral\\", a oil painting regarded by some as the most accurate depiction of the gunfight for many years. Forsythe's father William Bowen Forsyth and uncle Ira Chandler owned the store Chandler & Forsyth C.O.D. at 328 Fremont Street, west of the back entrance to the O.K. Corral and half a block from the site of the gunfight. They claimed that they had been present and witnessed the shootout. Newspaper accounts of the painting reported that Forsythe had interviewed Tombstone residents and examined many of the existing buildings before beginning to plan his painting. In May 1988, his studio printed and sold a limited edition of 390 copies of the painting. John Gilchriese became friends with John Flood, who had been Wyatt Earp's secretary, confidante, and best friend for many years. When Earp died, Flood inherited many of his personal belongings. Flood in turn willed them to Gilchriese, who amassed over a number of years one of the largest collections of personal items belonging to Wyatt and Virgil Earp, along with many unpublished photos of them and their family. Gilchriese opened the Wyatt Earp Museum in Tombstone in 1966 and commissioned Western artist Don Perceval to paint the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The oil on masonite painting titled The Street Fight is . It was the largest work ever executed by Perceval. He referred to original documents in Gilchriese's collection, including Wyatt Earp's own diagram of the shootout, and unpublished notes made by John Flood, to create what is regarded as the most accurate depiction of the shootout. Gilchreise had 500 lithographic prints reproduced from the original, which Perceval signed. The prints were sold by the museum for $10 (). After Gilchriese closed his museum, the painting and other contents of the museum were sold at auction by John's Western Gallery of San Francisco. The estimated auction price for the painting had been $200,000 to $300,000; the final sale price on June 25, 2004 was $40,250. It was put up for auction again on June 14, 2014 with an estimated selling price of $40,000‚Äì$60,000 but failed to sell. = Origin of the gunfight's name = Less than a month after the shootout it was described by a local newspaper as the \\"Gunfight at The O.K. Corral\\". William Breakenridge in his 1928 book Helldorado: Bringing Law to the Mesquite described it as \\"The Incident Near the O.K. Corral.\\" Stuart Lake titled his chapter about the conflict \\"At the O.K. Corral\\" in his popular book Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal. But it was the popular movie Gunfight at the O.K. Corral that cemented the incident and its erroneous location in popular consciousness. The movie and accompanying mythologizing also altered the way that the public thought of the Earps and the outlaws. Prior to the movie, the media often criticized the Earps' actions in Tombstone. In the movies, they became the good guys, always ready to stand for what is right. The incident has become a fixture in American history due to the personal nature of the feud between the Earps and the McLaury and Clanton brothers and the symbolism of the fight between lawmen and the Cowboys. The Cowboys maimed Virgil and murdered Morgan but escaped prosecution, and Wyatt's extra-legal campaign for revenge captured people's attention. The gunfight and its aftermath stand for the change overcoming America as the Western frontier ceased to exist, as a nation that was rapidly industrializing pushed out what had been a largely agrarian economy. Daily reenactment at the O.K. Corral The town of Tombstone has capitalized on interest in the gunfight. A portion of the town is a historical district that has been designated a National Historic Landmark and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places by the U.S. National Park Service. A local company produces daily theatrical re-enactments of the gunfight. = Film and television = With the widespread sales of televisions after World War II, producers spun out a large number of western-oriented shows. At the height of their popularity in 1959, there were more than two dozen \\"cowboy\\" programs on each week. At least six of them were directly or indirectly connected with Wyatt Earp: The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Tombstone Territory, Broken Arrow, Johnny Ringo, and Gunsmoke. Hugh O'Brian portrayed Earp on the namesake show Wyatt Earp which ran for six seasons, and he was forever associated with that role. A 2003 episode of Discovery Channel's Unsolved History used modern technology to attempt to re-enact the gunfight. They utilized a movie set to recreate a space similar to the lot where the original gun fight took place. They confirmed that the front-to-back wrist wound suffered by Billy Clanton could only have occurred if his arm was raised in the manner of one holding a pistol, and that the black powder may have obscured the shooters' view of each other. The episode concluded that the three eyewitnesses for the prosecution (Sheriff Behan, Ike Clanton, and Billy Claiborne) likely offered perjured testimony. They found that Tom McLaury may have been hit by the shotgun round under his armpit as he reached over his horse for a rifle in his scabbard, as the horse turned away from him at the same time. The stories about the gunfight written in the 20th century affected American culture. Numerous dramatic, fictional, and documentary works have been produced about or in reference to the event, with widely varying degrees of accuracy. These works include: * Law and Order (1932) with Walter Huston, the first film to depict the gunfight * Tombstone, the Town Too Tough to Die (1942) with Richard Dix * My Darling Clementine (1946) with Henry Fonda * The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp (1955‚Äì1961), TV series with Hugh O'Brian, season 6 episode 36 * Gunfight at the O.K.

It is an ionic salt of potassium ions K+ and nitrate ions NO3‚àí, and is therefore an alkali metal nitrate. It occurs in nature as a mineral, niter. It is a source of nitrogen, and nitrogen was named after niter. Potassium nitrate is one of several nitrogen-containing compounds collectively referred to as saltpeter or saltpetre. Major uses of potassium nitrate are in fertilizers, tree stump removal, rocket propellants and fireworks. It is one of the major constituents of gunpowder (black powder). In processed meats, potassium nitrate reacts with hemoglobin and generates a pink color. Etymology Potassium nitrate, because of its early and global use and production, has many names. Hebrew and Egyptian words for it had the consonants n-t-r, indicating likely cognation in the Greek nitron, which was Latinised to nitrum or nitrium. Thence Old French had niter and Middle English nitre. By the 15th century, Europeans referred to it as saltpeter and later as nitrate of potash, as the chemistry of the compound was more fully understood. The Arabs called it \\"Chinese snow\\" ( '). It was called \\"Chinese salt\\" by the Iranians/Persians or \\"salt from Chinese salt marshes\\" ( '). Properties Potassium nitrate has an orthorhombic crystal structure at room temperature, which transforms to a trigonal system at . Potassium nitrate is moderately soluble in water, but its solubility increases with temperature. The aqueous solution is almost neutral, exhibiting pH 6.2 at for a 10% solution of commercial powder. It is not very hygroscopic, absorbing about 0.03% water in 80% relative humidity over 50 days. It is insoluble in alcohol and is not poisonous; it can react explosively with reducing agents, but it is not explosive on its own. =Thermal decomposition= Between , potassium nitrate reaches a temperature-dependent equilibrium with potassium nitrite: :2 KNO3 2 KNO2 \\\\+ O2 History of production =From mineral sources= In Ancient India, saltpeter manufacturers formed the Nuniya caste. Saltpeter finds mention in Kautilya's Arthashastra (compiled 300BC - 300CE), which mentions using its poisonous smoke as a weapon of war, although its use for propulsion did not appear until medieval times. A purification process for potassium nitrate was outlined in 1270 by the chemist and engineer Hasan al-Rammah of Syria in his book al- Furusiyya wa al-Manasib al-Harbiyya (The Book of Military Horsemanship and Ingenious War Devices). In this book, al-Rammah describes first the purification of barud (crude saltpeter mineral) by boiling it with minimal water and using only the hot solution, then the use of potassium carbonate (in the form of wood ashes) to remove calcium and magnesium by precipitation of their carbonates from this solution, leaving a solution of purified potassium nitrate, which could then be dried.Ahmad Y Hassan, Potassium Nitrate in Arabic and Latin Sources , History of Science and Technology in Islam. This was used for the manufacture of gunpowder and explosive devices. The terminology used by al-Rammah indicated a Chinese origin for the gunpowder weapons about which he wrote. At least as far back as 1845, Chilean saltpeter deposits were exploited in Chile and California. =From caves= A major natural source of potassium nitrate was the deposits crystallizing from cave walls and the accumulations of bat guano in caves. Extraction is accomplished by immersing the guano in water for a day, filtering, and harvesting the crystals in the filtered water. Traditionally, guano was the source used in Laos for the manufacture of gunpowder for Bang Fai rockets. =LeConte= Perhaps the most exhaustive discussion of the production of this material is the 1862 LeConte text. He was writing with the express purpose of increasing production in the Confederate States to support their needs during the American Civil War. Since he was calling for the assistance of rural farming communities, the descriptions and instructions are both simple and explicit. He details the \\"French Method\\", along with several variations, as well as a \\"Swiss method\\". N.B. Many references have been made to a method using only straw and urine, but there is no such method in this work. French method Turgot and Lavoisier created the R√©gie des Poudres et Salp√™tres a few years before the French Revolution. Niter-beds were prepared by mixing manure with either mortar or wood ashes, common earth and organic materials such as straw to give porosity to a compost pile typically high, wide, and long. The heap was usually under a cover from the rain, kept moist with urine, turned often to accelerate the decomposition, then finally leached with water after approximately one year, to remove the soluble calcium nitrate which was then converted to potassium nitrate by filtering through potash. Swiss method LeConte describes a process using only urine and not dung, referring to it as the Swiss method. Urine is collected directly, in a sandpit under a stable. The sand itself is dug out and leached for nitrates which were then converted to potassium nitrate using potash, as above. =From nitric acid= From 1903 until the World War I era, potassium nitrate for black powder and fertilizer was produced on an industrial scale from nitric acid produced using the Birkeland‚ÄìEyde process, which used an electric arc to oxidize nitrogen from the air. During World War I the newly industrialized Haber process (1913) was combined with the Ostwald process after 1915, allowing Germany to produce nitric acid for the war after being cut off from its supplies of mineral sodium nitrates from Chile (see nitratite). Production Potassium nitrate can be made by combining ammonium nitrate and potassium hydroxide. :NH4NO3 (aq) + KOH (aq) ‚Üí NH3 (g) + KNO3 (aq) + H2O (l) An alternative way of producing potassium nitrate without a by-product of ammonia is to combine ammonium nitrate, found in instant ice packs, and potassium chloride, easily obtained as a sodium-free salt substitute. :NH4NO3 (aq) + KCl (aq) ‚Üí NH4Cl (aq) + KNO3 (aq) Potassium nitrate can also be produced by neutralizing nitric acid with potassium hydroxide. This reaction is highly exothermic. :KOH (aq) + HNO3 ‚Üí KNO3 (aq) + H2O (l) On industrial scale it is prepared by the double displacement reaction between sodium nitrate and potassium chloride. :NaNO3 (aq) + KCl (aq) ‚Üí NaCl (aq) + KNO3 (aq) Uses Potassium nitrate has a wide variety of uses, largely as a source of nitrate. =Nitric acid production= Historically, nitric acid was produced by combining sulfuric acid with nitrates such as saltpeter. In modern times this is reversed: nitrates are produced from nitric acid produced via the Ostwald process. =Oxidizer= A demonstration of the oxidation of a piece of charcoal in molten potassium nitrate The most famous use of potassium nitrate is probably as the oxidizer in blackpowder. From the most ancient times until the late 1880s, blackpowder provided the explosive power for all the world's firearms. After that time, small arms and large artillery increasingly began to depend on cordite, a smokeless powder. Blackpowder remains in use today in black powder rocket motors, but also in combination with other fuels like sugars in \\"rocket candy\\". It is also used in fireworks such as smoke bombs.Amthyst Galleries, Inc . Galleries.com. Retrieved on 2012-03-07. It is also added to cigarettes to maintain an even burn of the tobaccoInorganic Additives for the Improvement of Tobacco , TobaccoDocuments.org and is used to ensure complete combustion of paper cartridges for cap and ball revolvers. It can also be heated to several hundred degrees to be used for niter bluing, which is less durable than other forms of protective oxidation, but allows for specific and often beautiful coloration of steel parts, such as screws, pins, and other small parts of firearms. =Meat processing= Potassium nitrate has been a common ingredient of salted meat since antiquity or the Middle Ages.\\"Meat Science\\", University of Wisconsin. uwex.edu. The widespread adoption of nitrate use is more recent and is linked to the development of large-scale meat processing. The use of potassium nitrate has been mostly discontinued because of slow and inconsistent results compared to sodium nitrite compounds such as \\"Prague powder\\" or pink \\"curing salt\\". Even so, potassium nitrate is still used in some food applications, such as salami, dry-cured ham, charcuterie, and (in some countries) in the brine used to make corned beef (sometimes together with sodium nitrite).Corned Beef , Food Network When used as a food additive in the European Union,UK Food Standards Agency: the compound is referred to as E252; it is also approved for use as a food additive in the United StatesUS Food and Drug Administration: and Australia and New ZealandAustralia New Zealand Food Standards Code (where it is listed under its INS number 252). =Food preparation= In West African cuisine, potassium nitrate (saltpetre) is widely used as a thickening agent in soups and stews such as okra soup and isi ewu. It is also used to soften food and reduce cooking time when boiling beans and tough meat. Saltpetre is also an essential ingredient in making special porridges, such as kunun kanwa literally translated from the Hausa language as 'saltpetre porridge'. In the Shetland Islands (UK) it is used in the curing of mutton to make reestit mutton, a local delicacy. =Fertilizer= Potassium nitrate is used in fertilizers as a source of nitrogen and potassium ‚Äì two of the macronutrients for plants. When used by itself, it has an NPK rating of 13-0-44.Michigan State University Extension Bulletin E-896: N-P-K Fertilizers =Pharmacology= * Used in some toothpastes for sensitive teeth. Recently, the use of potassium nitrate in toothpastes for treating sensitive teeth has increased. * Used historically to treat asthma. Used in some toothpastes to relieve asthma symptoms. * Used in Thailand as main ingredient in kidney tablets to relieve the symptoms of cystitis, pyelitis and urethritis.LOCAL MANUFACTURED DRUG REGISTRATION FOR HUMAN (COMBINE). fda.moph.go.th * Combats high blood pressure and was once used as a hypotensive. =Other uses= * Electrolyte in a salt bridge * Active ingredient of condensed aerosol fire suppression systems. When burned with the free radicals of a fire's flame, it produces potassium carbonate. * Works as an aluminium cleaner. * Component (usually about 98%) of some tree stump removal products. It accelerates the natural decomposition of the stump by supplying nitrogen for the fungi attacking the wood of the stump. * In heat treatment of metals as a medium temperature molten salt bath, usually in combination with sodium nitrite. A similar bath is used to produce a durable blue/black finish typically seen on firearms. Its oxidizing quality, water solubility, and low cost make it an ideal short-term rust inhibitor. * To induce flowering of mango trees in the Philippines. * Thermal storage medium in power generation systems. Sodium and potassium nitrate salts are stored in a molten state with the solar energy collected by the heliostats at the Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant. Ternary salts, with the addition of calcium nitrate or lithium nitrate, have been found to improve the heat storage capacity in the molten salts. * As a source of potassium ions for exchange with sodium ions in chemically strengthened glass. * As an oxidizer in model rocket fuel called Rocket candy. In folklore and popular culture Potassium nitrate was once thought to induce impotence, and is still rumored to be in institutional food (such as military fare) as an anaphrodisiac; however, there is no scientific evidence for such properties. in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film), Randall is asked by the nurses to take his medications, but not knowing what they were, he mentioned he didn't want anyone to 'slip me saltpeter'. He then proceeds to imitate the motions of masturbation in reference to its supposed effects as an anaphrodisiac In 1776 (musical), John Adams asks his wife Abigail to make saltpeter for the Continental Army. She, eventually, is able to do so in exchange for pins for sewing. In the Star Trek episode \\"Arena\\", Captain Kirk injures a gorn using a rudimentary cannon that he constructed using potassium nitrate as a key ingredient. In 21 Jump Street, Jenko, played by Channing Tatum, gave a rhyming presentation about potassium nitrate for his chemistry class.

United Kingdom: Hachette. . and it ruled from the Balkans to North Africa and also Central Asia, spanning three continents, from their seat of power in Persis (Persepolis). It was the largest empire yet seen and the first world empire. The Achaemenid Empire was the only civilization in all of history to connect over 40% of the global population, accounting for approximately 49.4 million of the world's 112.4 million people in around 480 BC. They were succeeded by the Seleucid, Parthian, and Sasanian Empires, who successively governed Iran for almost 1,000 years and made Iran once again as a leading power in the world. Persia's arch-rival was the Roman Empire and its successor, the Byzantine Empire. The Iranian Empire proper begins in the Iron Age, following the influx of Iranian peoples. Iranian people gave rise to the Medes, the Achaemenid, Parthian, and Sasanian Empires of classical antiquity. Once a major empire, Iran has endured invasions too, by the Macedonians, Arabs, Turks, and the Mongols. Iran has continually reasserted its national identity throughout the centuries and has developed as a distinct political and cultural entity. The Muslim conquest of Persia (633‚Äì654) ended the Sasanian Empire and is a turning point in Iranian history. Islamization of Iran took place during the eighth to tenth centuries, leading to the eventual decline of Zoroastrianism in Iran as well as many of its dependencies. However, the achievements of the previous Persian civilizations were not lost, but were to a great extent absorbed by the new Islamic polity and civilization. Iran, with its long history of early cultures and empires, had suffered particularly hard during the late Middle Ages and the early modern period. Many invasions of nomadic tribes, whose leaders became rulers in this country, affected it negatively. Iran was reunified as an independent state in 1501 by the Safavid dynasty, which set Shia Islam as the empire's official religion,R.M.

Coon in Bisitun Cave. Evidence for Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic periods are known mainly from the Zagros Mountains in the caves of Kermanshah, Piranshahr and Khorramabad and a few number of sites in the Alborz and Central Iran. During this time, people began creating rock art. =Neolithic to Chalcolithic= Early agricultural communities such as Chogha Golan in 10,000 BC along with settlements such as Chogha Bonut (the earliest village in Elam) in 8000 BC, began to flourish in and around the Zagros Mountains region in western Iran. Around about the same time, the earliest- known clay vessels and modelled human and animal terracotta figurines were produced at Ganj Dareh, also in western Iran. There are also 10,000-year-old human and animal figurines from Tepe Sarab in Kermanshah Province among many other ancient artefacts. The south-western part of Iran was part of the Fertile Crescent where most of humanity's first major crops were grown, in villages such as Susa (where a settlement was first founded possibly as early as 4395 cal BC)The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State ‚Äì by D.

The general perception among archaeologists is that Susa was an extension of the Sumerian city state of Uruk, hence incorporating many aspects of mesopotamian culture.Algaze, Guillermo. 2005. The Uruk World System: The Dynamics of Expansion of Early Mesopotamian Civilizationhttp://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/saoc63.pdf In its later history, Susa became the capital of Elam, which emerged as a state founded 4000 BC. There are also dozens of prehistoric sites across the Iranian plateau pointing to the existence of ancient cultures and urban settlements in the fourth millennium BC, One of the earliest civilizations in Iranian plateau was the Jiroft culture in southeastern Iran in the province of Kerman. It is one of the most artefact-rich archaeological sites in the Middle East. Archaeological excavations in Jiroft led to the discovery of several objects belonging to the 4th millennium BC. There is a large quantity of objects decorated with highly distinctive engravings of animals, mythological figures, and architectural motifs. The objects and their iconography are unlike anything ever seen before by archaeologists. Many are made from chlorite, a grey-green soft stone; others are in copper, bronze, terracotta, and even lapis lazuli. Recent excavations at the sites have produced the world's earliest inscription which pre-dates Mesopotamian inscriptions.Cultural Heritage news agency retrieved 27 March 2008 There are records of numerous other ancient civilizations on the Iranian Plateau before the emergence of Iranian peoples during the Early Iron Age. The Early Bronze Age saw the rise of urbanization into organized city states and the invention of writing (the Uruk period) in the Near East. While Bronze Age Elam made use of writing from an early time, the Proto-Elamite script remains undeciphered, and records from Sumer pertaining to Elam are scarce. Russian historian Igor M. Diakonoff states that the modern inhabitants of the Iranian Plateau are descendants of mainly non-Persian groups: \\"It is the autochthones of the Iranian plateau, and not the Proto-Indo-European tribes of Europe, which are, in the main, the ancestors, in the physical sense of the word, of the present-day Iranians.\\"Diakonoff, I., M., \\"Media\\", Cambridge History of Iran, II, Cambridge, 1985, p.43 [within the pp.36‚Äì148]. This paper is cited in the Journal of Eurasian Studies at page 51. =Early Iron Age= A gold cup at the National Museum of Iran, dating from the first half of 1st millennium BC Records become more tangible with the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and its records of incursions from the Iranian plateau. As early as the 20th century BC, tribes came to the Iranian Plateau from the Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe. The arrival of Iranians on the Iranian plateau forced the Elamites to relinquish one area of their empire after another and to take refuge in Elam, Khuzestan and the nearby area, which only then became coterminous with Elam. Bahman Firuzmandi say that the southern Iranians might be intermixed with the Elamite peoples living in the plateau.^ Bahman Firuzmandi \\"Mad, Hakhamanishi, Ashkani, Sasani\\" pp. 20 By the mid-first millennium BC, Medes, Persians, and Parthians populated the Iranian plateau. Until the rise of the Medes, they all remained under Assyrian domination, like the rest of the Near East. In the first half of the first millennium BC, parts of what is now Iranian Azerbaijan were incorporated into Urartu.

For over 150 years Assyrian kings of nearby Northern Mesopotamia had been wanting to conquer Median tribes of Western Iran. Under pressure from Assyria, the small kingdoms of the western Iranian plateau coalesced into increasingly larger and more centralized states. In the second half of the seventh century BC, the Medes gained their independence and were united by Deioces. In 612 BC, Cyaxares, Deioces' grandson, and the Babylonian king Nabopolassar invaded Assyria and laid siege to and eventually destroyed Nineveh, the Assyrian capital, which led to the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Urartu was later on conquered and dissolved as well by the Medes.Urartu ‚Äì Lost Kingdom of Van The Medes are credited with founding Iran as a nation and empire, and established the first Iranian empire, the largest of its day until Cyrus the Great established a unified empire of the Medes and Persians, leading to the Achaemenid Empire (c.550‚Äì330 BC). The Achaemenid Empire at its greatest extent. Cyrus the Great overthrew, in turn, the Median, Lydian, and Neo-Babylonian Empires, creating an empire far larger than Assyria. He was better able, through more benign policies, to reconcile his subjects to Persian rule; the longevity of his empire was one result. The Persian king, like the Assyrian, was also \\"King of Kings\\", x≈°ƒÅyaŒ∏iya x≈°ƒÅyaŒ∏iyƒÅnƒÅm (shƒÅhanshƒÅh in modern Persian) ‚Äì \\"great king\\", Megas Basileus, as known by the Greeks. Cyrus's son, Cambyses II, conquered the last major power of the region, ancient Egypt, causing the collapse of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt. Since he became ill and died before, or while, leaving Egypt, stories developed, as related by Herodotus, that he was struck down for impiety against the ancient Egyptian deities. The winner, Darius I, based his claim on membership in a collateral line of the Achaemenid Empire. Darius' first capital was at Susa, and he started the building programme at Persepolis. He rebuilt a canal between the Nile and the Red Sea, a forerunner of the modern Suez Canal. He improved the extensive road system, and it is during his reign that mention is first made of the Royal Road (shown on map), a great highway stretching all the way from Susa to Sardis with posting stations at regular intervals. Major reforms took place under Darius. Coinage, in the form of the daric (gold coin) and the shekel (silver coin) was standardized (coinage had already been invented over a century before in Lydia c. 660 BC but not standardized),FORGOTTEN EMPIRE the world of Ancient Persia  The Persian Empire  Darius I and administrative efficiency increased. The Old Persian language appears in royal inscriptions, written in a specially adapted version of the cuneiform script. Under Cyrus the Great and Darius I, the Persian Empire eventually became the largest empire in human history up until that point, ruling and administrating over most of the then known world, as well as spanning the continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The greatest achievement was the empire itself. The Persian Empire represented the world's first superpower that was based on a model of tolerance and respect for other cultures and religions.Benevolent Persian Empire alt= In the late sixth century BC, Darius launched his European campaign, in which he defeated the Paeonians, conquered Thrace, and subdued all coastal Greek cities, as well as defeating the European Scythians around the Danube river.Joseph Roisman, Ian Worthington. A Companion to Ancient Macedonia, John Wiley & Sons, 2011. pp 135‚Äì138, pp 343‚Äì345 In 512/511, Macedon became a vassal kingdom of Persia. In 499 BC, Athens lent support to a revolt in Miletus, which resulted in the sacking of Sardis. This led to an Achaemenid campaign against mainland Greece known as the Greco-Persian Wars, which lasted the first half of the 5th century BC, and is known as one of the most important wars in European history. In the First Persian invasion of Greece, the Persian general Mardonius re-subjugated Thrace and made Macedon a full part of Persia. The war eventually turned out in defeat however. Darius' successor Xerxes I launched the Second Persian invasion of Greece. At a crucial moment in the war, about half of mainland Greece was overrun by the Persians, including all territories to the north of the Isthmus of Corinth,Brian Todd Carey, Joshua Allfree, John Cairns. Warfare in the Ancient World, Pen and Sword, 19 jan. 2006 however, this was also turned out in a Greek victory, following the battles of Plataea and Salamis, by which Persia lost its footholds in Europe, and eventually withdrew from it. During the Greco-Persian wars Persia gained major territorial advantages capture and razed Athens in 480 BC. However, after a string of Greek victories the Persians were forced to withdraw thus losing control of Macedonia, Thrace and Ionia. Fighting continued for several decades after the successful Greek repelling of the Second Invasion with numerous Greek city states under the Athens' newly formed Delian League, which eventually ended with the peace of Callias in 449 BC, ending the Greco-Persian Wars. In 404 BC, following the death of Darius II, Egypt rebelled under Amyrtaeus. Later pharaohs successfully resisted Persian attempts to reconquer Egypt until 343 BC, when Egypt was reconquered by Artaxerxes III.

Alexander's empire broke up shortly after his death, and Alexander's general, Seleucus I Nicator, tried to take control of Iran, Mesopotamia, and later Syria and Anatolia. His empire was the Seleucid Empire. He was killed in 281 BCE by Ptolemy Keraunos. Greek language, philosophy, and art came with the colonists. During the Seleucid era, Greek became the common tongue of diplomacy and literature throughout the empire. =Parthian Empire (248 BC‚Äì224 AD)= alt= The Parthian Empire, ruled by the Parthians, a group of northwestern Iranian people, was the realm of the Arsacid dynasty, who reunited and governed the Iranian plateau after the Parni conquest of Parthia and defeating the Seleucid Empire in the later third century BC, and intermittently controlled Mesopotamia between ca 150 BC and 224 AD. The Parthian Empire quickly included Eastern Arabia. Bagadates I, first native Persian ruler after Greek rule Parthia was the eastern arch-enemy of the Roman Empire and it limited Rome's expansion beyond Cappadocia (central Anatolia). The Parthian armies included two types of cavalry: the heavily armed and armoured cataphracts and the lightly-armed but highly-mobile mounted archers. For the Romans, who relied on heavy infantry, the Parthians were too hard to defeat, as both types of cavalry were much faster and more mobile than foot soldiers. The Parthian shot used by the Parthian cavalry was most notably feared by the Roman soldiers, which proved pivotal in the crushing Roman defeat at the Battle of Carrhae. On the other hand, the Parthians found it difficult to occupy conquered areas as they were unskilled in siege warfare. Because of these weaknesses, neither the Romans nor the Parthians were able completely to annex each other's territory. The Parthian empire subsisted for five centuries, longer than most Eastern Empires. The end of this empire came at last in 224 AD, when the empire's organization had loosened and the last king was defeated by one of the empire's vassal peoples, the Persians under the Sasanians. However, the Arsacid dynasty continued to exist for centuries onwards in Armenia, the Iberia, and the Caucasian Albania, which were all eponymous branches of the dynasty. =Sasanian Empire (224‚Äì651 AD)= Rock- face relief at Naqsh-e Rustam of Iranian emperor Shapur I (on horseback) capturing Roman emperor Valerian (kneeing) and Philip the Arab (standing). Hunting scene on a gilded silver bowl showing king Khosrau I. The first shah of the Sasanian Empire, Ardashir I, started reforming the country economically and militarily. For a period of more than 400 years, Iran was once again one of the leading powers in the world, alongside its neighbouring rival, the Roman and then Byzantine Empires.Norman A. Stillman The Jews of Arab Lands pp 22 Jewish Publication Society, 1979 International Congress of Byzantine Studies Proceedings of the 21st International Congress of Byzantine Studies, London, 21‚Äì26 August 2006, Volumes 1‚Äì3 pp 29. Ashgate Pub Co, 30 sep. 2006 The empire's territory, at its height, encompassed all of today's Iran, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Abkhazia, Dagestan, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, parts of Afghanistan, Turkey, Syria, parts of Pakistan, Central Asia, Eastern Arabia, and parts of Egypt. Most of the Sassanian Empire's lifespan it was overshadowed by the frequent Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian wars, a continuation of the Roman‚ÄìParthian Wars and the all-comprising Roman‚ÄìPersian Wars; the last was the longest-lasting conflict in human history. Started in the first century BC by their predecessors, the Parthians and Romans, the last Roman‚ÄìPersian War was fought in the seventh century. The Persians defeated the Romans at the Battle of Edessa in 260 and took emperor Valerian prisoner for the remainder of his life. Eastern Arabia was conquered early on. During Khosrow II's rule in 590‚Äì628, Egypt, Jordan, Palestine and Lebanon were also annexed to the Empire. The Sassanians called their empire Er√¢nshahr (\\"Dominion of the Aryans\\", i.e., of Iranians).Garthwaite, Gene R., The Persians, p. 2 A chapter of Iran's history followed after roughly six hundred years of conflict with the Roman Empire. During this time, the Sassanian and Romano-Byzantine armies clashed for influence in Anatolia, the western Caucasus (mainly Lazica and the Kingdom of Iberia; modern-day Georgia and Abkhazia), Mesopotamia, Armenia and the Levant. Under Justinian I, the war came to an uneasy peace with payment of tribute to the Sassanians. However, the Sasanians used the deposition of the Byzantine emperor Maurice as a casus belli to attack the Empire. After many gains, the Sassanians were defeated at Issus, Constantinople, and finally Nineveh, resulting in peace. With the conclusion of the over 700 years lasting Roman‚ÄìPersian Wars through the climactic Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 602‚Äì628, which included the very siege of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople, the war-exhausted Persians lost the Battle of al-QƒÅdisiyyah (632) in Hilla (present day Iraq) to the invading Muslim forces. The Sasanian era, encompassing the length of Late Antiquity, is considered to be one of the most important and influential historical periods in Iran, and had a major impact on the world. In many ways the Sassanian period witnessed the highest achievement of Persian civilization, and constitutes the last great Iranian Empire before the adoption of Islam. Persia influenced Roman civilization considerably during Sassanian times,J. B. Bury, p.109. their cultural influence extending far beyond the empire's territorial borders, reaching as far as Western Europe,Durant. Africa, China and IndiaSarfaraz, pp. 329‚Äì330. and also playing a prominent role in the formation of both European and Asiatic medieval art. This influence carried forward to the Muslim world. The dynasty's unique and aristocratic culture transformed the Islamic conquest and destruction of Iran into a Persian Renaissance. Much of what later became known as Islamic culture, architecture, writing, and other contributions to civilization, were taken from the Sassanian Persians into the broader Muslim world.Zarinkoob, p.305. Battle between Heraclius' army and Persians under Khosrow II. Fresco by Piero della Francesca, c. 1452. Medieval Iran =Early Islamic period= Islamic conquest of Persia (633‚Äì651) Phases of the Islamic conquest In 633, when the Sasanian king Yazdegerd III was ruling over Iran, the Muslims under Umar invaded the country right after it had been in a bloody civil war. Several Iranian nobles and families such as king Dinar of the House of Karen, and later Kanarangiyans of Khorasan, mutinied against their Sasanian overlords. Although the House of Mihran had claimed the Sasanian throne under the two prominent generals BahrƒÅm Ch≈çbin and Shahrbaraz, it remained loyal to the Sasanians during their struggle against the Arabs, but the Mihrans were eventually betrayed and defeated by their own kinsmen, the House of Ispahbudhan, under their leader Farrukhzad, who had mutinied against Yazdegerd III. Yazdegerd III, fled from one district to another until a local miller killed him for his purse at Merv in 651. By 674, Muslims had conquered Greater Khorasan (which included modern Iranian Khorasan province and modern Afghanistan and parts of Transoxiana). The Muslim conquest of Persia ended the Sasanian Empire and led to the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Persia. Over time, the majority of Iranians converted to Islam. Most of the aspects of the previous Persian civilizations were not discarded, but were absorbed by the new Islamic polity. As Bernard Lewis has commented: Umayyad era and Muslim incursions into the Caspian coast After the fall of the Sasanian Empire in 651, the Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate adopted many Persian customs, especially the administrative and the court mannerisms. Arab provincial governors were undoubtedly either Persianized Arameans or ethnic Persians; certainly Persian remained the language of official business of the caliphate until the adoption of Arabic toward the end of the seventh century,Hawting G., The First Dynasty of Islam. The Umayyad Caliphate AD 661‚Äì750, (London) 1986, pp. 63‚Äì64 when in 692 minting began at the capital, Damascus. The new Islamic coins evolved from imitations of Sasanian coins (as well as Byzantine), and the Pahlavi script on the coinage was replaced with Arabic alphabet. During the Umayyad Caliphate, the Arab conquerors imposed Arabic as the primary language of the subject peoples throughout their empire. Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, who was not happy with the prevalence of the Persian language in the divan, ordered the official language of the conquered lands to be replaced by Arabic, sometimes by force.Cambridge History of Iran, by Richard Nelson Frye, Abdolhosein Zarrinkoub, et al. Section on The Arab Conquest of Iran and . Vol 4, 1975. London. p.46 In al-Biruni's From The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries for example it is written: There are a number of historians who see the rule of the Umayyads as setting up the \\"dhimmah\\" to increase taxes from the dhimmis to benefit the Muslim Arab community financially and by discouraging conversion.Fred Astren pg.33‚Äì35 Governors lodged complaints with the caliph when he enacted laws that made conversion easier, depriving the provinces of revenues. In the 7th century, when many non-Arabs such as Persians entered Islam, they were recognized as mawali (\\"clients\\") and treated as second-class citizens by the ruling Arab elite until the end of the Umayyad Caliphate. During this era, Islam was initially associated with the ethnic identity of the Arab and required formal association with an Arab tribe and the adoption of the client status of mawali. The half-hearted policies of the late Umayyads to tolerate non-Arab Muslims and Shias had failed to quell unrest among these minorities. However, all of Iran was still not under Arab control, and the region of Daylam was under the control of the Daylamites, while Tabaristan was under Dabuyid and Paduspanid control, and the Mount Damavand region under Masmughans of Damavand. The Arabs had invaded these regions several times, but achieved no decisive result because of the inaccessible terrain of the regions. The most prominent ruler of the Dabuyids, known as Farrukhan the Great (r. 712‚Äì728), managed to hold his domains during his long struggle against the Arab general Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, who was defeated by a combined Dailamite-Dabuyid army, and was forced to retreat from Tabaristan.Pourshariati (2008), pp. 312‚Äì313 With the death of the Umayyad Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al- Malik in 743, the Islamic world was launched into civil war. Abu Muslim was sent to Khorasan by the Abbasid Caliphate initially as a propagandist and then to revolt on their behalf. He took Merv defeating the Umayyad governor there Nasr ibn Sayyar. He became the de facto Abbasid governor of Khurasan. During the same period, the Dabuyid ruler Khurshid declared independence from the Umayyads, but was shortly forced to recognize Abbasid authority. In 750, Abu Muslim became leader of the Abbasid army and defeated the Umayyads at the Battle of the Zab. Abu Muslim stormed Damascus, the capital of the Umayyad caliphate, later that year.  Abbasid period and autonomous Iranian dynasties  The Saffarid dynasty in 900 AD. Map of the Iranian dynasties in the mid 10th-century. The Abbasid army consisted primarily of Khorasanians and was led by an Iranian general, Abu Muslim Khorasani. It contained both Iranian and Arab elements, and the Abbasids enjoyed both Iranian and Arab support. The Abbasids overthrew the Umayyads in 750. According to Amir Arjomand, the Abbasid Revolution essentially marked the end of the Arab empire and the beginning of a more inclusive, multi-ethnic state in the Middle East.Sa√Ød Amir Arjomand, Abd Allah Ibn al-Muqaffa and the Abbasid Revolution. Iranian Studies, vol. 27, #1‚Äì4. London: Routledge, 1994. One of the first changes the Abbasids made after taking power from the Umayyads was to move the empire's capital from Damascus, in the Levant, to Iraq. The latter region was influenced by Persian history and culture, and moving the capital was part of the Persian mawali demand for Arab influence in the empire. The city of Baghdad was constructed on the Tigris River, in 762, to serve as the new Abbasid capital. The Abbasids established the position of vizier like Barmakids in their administration, which was the equivalent of a \\"vice- caliph\\", or second-in-command. Eventually, this change meant that many caliphs under the Abbasids ended up in a much more ceremonial role than ever before, with the vizier in real power. A new Persian bureaucracy began to replace the old Arab aristocracy, and the entire administration reflected these changes, demonstrating that the new dynasty was different in many ways to the Umayyads. By the 9th century, Abbasid control began to wane as regional leaders sprang up in the far corners of the empire to challenge the central authority of the Abbasid caliphate. The Abbasid caliphs began enlisting mamluks, Turkic- speaking warriors, who had been moving out of Central Asia into Transoxiana as slave warriors as early as the 9th century. Shortly thereafter the real power of the Abbasid caliphs began to wane; eventually, they became religious figureheads while the warrior slaves ruled. alt= The 9th century also saw the revolt by native Zoroastrians, known as the Khurramites, against oppressive Arab rule. The movement was led by Persian freedom fighter Babak Khorramdin. Babak's IranianizingBernard Lewis (1991), \\"The Political Language of Islam\\", University of Chicago Press, pp 482):\\"\\"Babak's Iranianizing rebellion in Azerbaijan gave occasion for sentiments at the capital to harden against men who were sympathetic to the more explicitly Iranian tradition\\" rebellion, from its base in Azerbaijan in northwestern Iran,F.

The Khorramdin rebellion of Babak spread to the Western and Central parts of Iran and lasted more than twenty years before it was defeated when Babak was betrayed by Afshin, a senior general of the Abbasid Caliphate. As the power of the Abbasid caliphs diminished, a series of dynasties rose in various parts of Iran, some with considerable influence and power. Among the most important of these overlapping dynasties were the Tahirids in Khorasan (821‚Äì873); the Saffarids in Sistan (861‚Äì1003, their rule lasted as maliks of Sistan until 1537); and the Samanids (819‚Äì1005), originally at Bukhara. The Samanids eventually ruled an area from central Iran to Pakistan. By the early 10th century, the Abbasids almost lost control to the growing Persian faction known as the Buyid dynasty (934‚Äì1062). Since much of the Abbasid administration had been Persian anyway, the Buyids were quietly able to assume real power in Baghdad. The Buyids were defeated in the mid-11th century by the Seljuq Turks, who continued to exert influence over the Abbasids, while publicly pledging allegiance to them. The balance of power in Baghdad remained as such ‚Äì with the Abbasids in power in name only ‚Äì until the Mongol invasion of 1258 sacked the city and definitively ended the Abbasid dynasty.

Islamic golden age, Shu'ubiyya movement and Persianization process Qotbeddin Shirazi (1236‚Äì1311), a Persian astronomer, depicting an epicyclic planetary modelalt= Islamization was a long process by which Islam was gradually adopted by the majority population of Iran. Richard Bulliet's \\"conversion curve\\" indicates that only about 10% of Iran converted to Islam during the relatively Arab-centric Umayyad period. Beginning in the Abassid period, with its mix of Persian as well as Arab rulers, the Muslim percentage of the population rose. As Persian Muslims consolidated their rule of the country, the Muslim population rose from approximately 40% in the mid-9th century to close to 100% by the end of the 11th century. Seyyed Hossein Nasr suggests that the rapid increase in conversion was aided by the Persian nationality of the rulers.Nasr, Hoseyn; Islam and the pliqht of modern man Although Persians adopted the religion of their conquerors, over the centuries they worked to protect and revive their distinctive language and culture, a process known as Persianization. Arabs and Turks participated in this attempt.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Seljuq\\", Online Edition, (LINK)Richard Frye, The Heritage of Persia, p. 243.Rayhanat al- adab, (3rd ed.), vol. 1, p. 181. In the 9th and 10th centuries, non-Arab subjects of the Ummah created a movement called Shu'ubiyyah in response to the privileged status of Arabs. Most of those behind the movement were Persian, but references to Egyptians, Berbers and Aramaeans are attested.Enderwitz, S. \\"Shu'ubiyya\\". Encyclopedia of Islam. Vol. IX (1997), pp. 513‚Äì14. Citing as its basis Islamic notions of equality of races and nations, the movement was primarily concerned with preserving Persian culture and protecting Persian identity, though within a Muslim context. The Samanid dynasty led the revival of Persian culture and the first important Persian poet after the arrival of Islam, Rudaki, was born during this era and was praised by Samanid kings. The Samanids also revived many ancient Persian festivals. Their successor, the Ghaznawids, who were of non- Iranian Turkic origin, also became instrumental in the revival of Persian culture. chess to the Persian court The culmination of the Persianization movement was the Shahnameh, the national epic of Iran, written almost entirely in Persian. This voluminous work, reflects Iran's ancient history, its unique cultural values, its pre-Islamic Zoroastrian religion, and its sense of nationhood. According to Bernard Lewis: > \\"Iran was indeed Islamized, but it was not Arabized. Persians remained > Persians. And after an interval of silence, Iran re-emerged as a separate, > different and distinctive element within Islam, eventually adding a new > element even to Islam itself.

Inheriting a heritage of thousands of years of civilization, and being at the \\"crossroads of the major cultural highways\\",Caheb C., Cambridge History of Iran, Tribes, Cities and Social Organization, vol. 4, p305‚Äì328 contributed to Persia emerging as what culminated into the \\"Islamic Golden Age\\". During this period, hundreds of scholars and scientists vastly contributed to technology, science and medicine, later influencing the rise of European science during the Renaissance.K√ºhnel E., in Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenl√§ndischen Gesell, Vol. CVI (1956) The most important scholars of almost all of the Islamic sects and schools of thought were Persian or lived in Iran, including the most notable and reliable Hadith collectors of Shia and Sunni like Shaikh Saduq, Shaikh Kulainy, Hakim al-Nishaburi, Imam Muslim and Imam Bukhari, the greatest theologians of Shia and Sunni like Shaykh Tusi, Imam Ghazali, Imam Fakhr al- Razi and Al-Zamakhshari, the greatest physicians, astronomers, logicians, mathematicians, metaphysicians, philosophers and scientists like Avicenna, and Nasƒ´r al-Dƒ´n al-T≈´sƒ´, the greatest Shaykh of Sufism like Rumi, Abdul-Qadir Gilani. Persianate states and dynasties (977‚Äì1219) Kharaghan twin towers, built in 1067, Persia, contain tombs of Seljuq princes. In 977, a Turkic governor of the Samanids, Sabuktigin, conquered Ghazna (in present-day Afghanistan) and established a dynasty, the Ghaznavids, that lasted to 1186. The Ghaznavid empire grew by taking all of the Samanid territories south of the Amu Darya in the last decade of the 10th century, and eventually occupied parts of Eastern Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and north-west India. The Ghaznavids are generally credited with launching Islam into a mainly Hindu India. The invasion of India was undertaken in 1000 by the Ghaznavid ruler, Mahmud, and continued for several years. They were unable to hold power for long, however, particularly after the death of Mahmud in 1030. By 1040 the Seljuqs had taken over the Ghaznavid lands in Iran. The Seljuqs, who like the Ghaznavids were Persianate in nature and of Turkic origin, slowly conquered Iran over the course of the 11th century. The dynasty had its origins in the Turcoman tribal confederations of Central Asia and marked the beginning of Turkic power in the Middle East. They established a Sunni Muslim rule over parts of Central Asia and the Middle East from the 11th to 14th centuries. They set up an empire known as Great Seljuq Empire that stretched from Anatolia in the west to western Afghanistan in the east and the western borders of (modern-day) China in the north-east; and was the target of the First Crusade. Today they are regarded as the cultural ancestors of the Western Turks, the present-day inhabitants of Turkey and Turkmenistan, and they are remembered as great patrons of Persian culture, art, literature, and language.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Seljuq\\", Online Edition, (LINK): \\"... Because the Turkish Seljuqs had no Islamic tradition or strong literary heritage of their own, they adopted the cultural language of their Persian instructors in Islam. Literary Persian thus spread to the whole of Iran, and the Arabic language disappeared in that country except in works of religious scholarship ...\\"O.√ñzg√ºndenli, \\"Persian Manuscripts in Ottoman and Modern Turkish Libraries\\", Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, Online Edition, (LINK)M. Ravandi, \\"The Seljuq court at Konya and the Persianisation of Anatolian Cities\\", in Mesogeios (Mediterranean Studies), vol. 25‚Äì6 (2005), pp. 157‚Äì69 alt= The founder of the dynasty, Tughril Beg, turned his army against the Ghaznavids in Khorasan. He moved south and then west, conquering but not wasting the cities in his path. In 1055 the caliph in Baghdad gave Tughril Beg robes, gifts, and the title King of the East. Under Tughril Beg's successor, Malik Shah (1072‚Äì1092), Iran enjoyed a cultural and scientific renaissance, largely attributed to his brilliant Iranian vizier, Nizam al Mulk. These leaders established the observatory where Omar Khayy√°m did much of his experimentation for a new calendar, and they built religious schools in all the major towns. They brought Abu Hamid Ghazali, one of the greatest Islamic theologians, and other eminent scholars to the Seljuq capital at Baghdad and encouraged and supported their work. When Malik Shah I died in 1092, the empire split as his brother and four sons quarrelled over the apportioning of the empire among themselves. In Anatolia, Malik Shah I was succeeded by Kilij Arslan I who founded the Sultanate of R√ªm and in Syria by his brother Tutush I. In Persia he was succeeded by his son Mahmud I whose reign was contested by his other three brothers Barkiyaruq in Iraq, Muhammad I in Baghdad and Ahmad Sanjar in Khorasan. As Seljuq power in Iran weakened, other dynasties began to step up in its place, including a resurgent Abbasid caliphate and the Khwarezmshahs. The Khwarezmid Empire was a Sunni Muslim Persianate dynasty, of East Turkic origin, that ruled in Central Asia. Originally vassals of the Seljuqs, they took advantage of the decline of the Seljuqs to expand into Iran. In 1194 the Khwarezmshah Ala ad-Din Tekish defeated the Seljuq sultan Toghrul III in battle and the Seljuq empire in Iran collapsed. Of the former Seljuq Empire, only the Sultanate of Rum in Anatolia remained. A serious internal threat to the Seljuqs during their reign came from the Nizari Ismailis, a secret sect with headquarters at Alamut Castle between Rasht and Tehran. They controlled the immediate area for more than 150 years and sporadically sent out adherents to strengthen their rule by murdering important officials. Several of the various theories on the etymology of the word assassin derive from these killers. Parts of northwestern Iran were conquered in the early 13th century AD by the Kingdom of Georgia, led by Tamar the Great.Lordkipanidze, Mariam (1987), Georgia in the XI-XII Centuries. Tbilisi: Ganatleba, p. 154. =Mongol conquest and rule (1219‚Äì1370)= Mongol invasion (1219‚Äì1221) Eurasia on the eve of the Mongol invasions, c. 1200 The Mongol Empire's expansion The Khwarazmian dynasty only lasted for a few decades, until the arrival of the Mongols. Genghis Khan had unified the Mongols, and under him the Mongol Empire quickly expanded in several directions. In 1218, it bordered Khwarezm. At that time, the Khwarazmian Empire was ruled by Ala ad-Din Muhammad (1200‚Äì1220). Muhammad, like Genghis, was intent on expanding his lands and had gained the submission of most of Iran. He declared himself shah and demanded formal recognition from the Abbasid caliph Al-Nasir. When the caliph rejected his claim, Ala ad-Din Muhammad proclaimed one of his nobles caliph and unsuccessfully tried to depose an-Nasir. The Mongol invasion of Iran began in 1219, after two diplomatic missions to Khwarezm sent by Genghis Khan had been massacred. During 1220‚Äì21 Bukhara, Samarkand, Herat, Tus and Nishapur were razed, and the whole populations were slaughtered. The Khwarezm-Shah fled, to die on an island off the Caspian coast. During the invasion of Transoxiana in 1219, along with the main Mongol force, Genghis Khan used a Chinese specialist catapult unit in battle, they were used again in 1220 in Transoxania. The Chinese may have used the catapults to hurl gunpowder bombs, since they already had them by this time. While Genghis Khan was conquering Transoxania and Persia, several Chinese who were familiar with gunpowder were serving in Genghis's army. \\"Whole regiments\\" entirely made out of Chinese were used by the Mongols to command bomb hurling trebuchets during the invasion of Iran. Historians have suggested that the Mongol invasion had brought Chinese gunpowder weapons to Central Asia. One of these was the huochong, a Chinese mortar. Books written around the area afterward depicted gunpowder weapons which resembled those of China.  Destruction under the Mongols  Before his death in 1227, Genghis had reached western Azerbaijan, pillaging and burning cities along the way. The Mongol invasion was disastrous to the Iranians. Although the Mongol invaders were eventually converted to Islam and accepted the culture of Iran, the Mongol destruction of the Islamic heartland marked a major change of direction for the region. Much of the six centuries of Islamic scholarship, culture, and infrastructure was destroyed as the invaders burned libraries, and replaced mosques with Buddhist temples.The Il- khanate The Mongols killed many Iranian civilians. Destruction of qanat irrigation systems destroyed the pattern of relatively continuous settlement, producing numerous isolated oasis cities in a land where they had previously been rare.Water, ch. 3 A large number of people, particularly males, were killed; between 1220 and 1258, 90% of the total population of Iran may have been killed as a result of mass extermination and famine.  Ilkhanate (1256‚Äì1335) Mongol successor khanates After Genghis's death, Iran was ruled by several Mongol commanders. Genghis' grandson, Hulagu Khan, was tasked with the westward expansion of Mongol dominion. However, by time he ascended to power, the Mongol Empire had already dissolved, dividing into different factions. Arriving with an army, he established himself in the region and founded the Ilkhanate, a breakaway state of the Mongol Empire, which would rule Iran for the next eighty years and become Persian in the process. Hulagu Khan seized Baghdad in 1258 and put the last Abbasid caliph to death. The westward advance of his forces was stopped by the Mamelukes, however, at the Battle of Ain Jalut in Palestine in 1260. Hulagu's campaigns against the Muslims also enraged Berke, khan of the Golden Horde and a convert to Islam. Hulagu and Berke fought against each other, demonstrating the weakening unity of the Mongol empire. The rule of Hulagu's great-grandson, Ghazan (1295‚Äì1304) saw the establishment of Islam as the state religion of the Ilkhanate. Ghazan and his famous Iranian vizier, Rashid al-Din, brought Iran a partial and brief economic revival. The Mongols lowered taxes for artisans, encouraged agriculture, rebuilt and extended irrigation works, and improved the safety of the trade routes. As a result, commerce increased dramatically. Items from India, China, and Iran passed easily across the Asian steppes, and these contacts culturally enriched Iran. For example, Iranians developed a new style of painting based on a unique fusion of solid, two-dimensional Mesopotamian painting with the feathery, light brush strokes and other motifs characteristic of China. After Ghazan's nephew Abu Said died in 1335, however, the Ilkhanate lapsed into civil war and was divided between several petty dynasties ‚Äì most prominently the Jalayirids, Muzaffarids, Sarbadars and Kartids. The mid-14th-century Black Death killed about 30% of the country's population.Q&A; with John Kelly on The Great Mortality on National Review Online.  Sunnism and Shiism in pre-Safavid Iran  Imam Reza shrine, the tomb of the eighth Imam of the twelver Shiites Prior to the rise of the Safavid Empire, Sunni Islam was the dominant religion, accounting for around 90% of the population at the time. According to Mortaza Motahhari the majority of Iranian scholars and masses remained Sunni until the time of the Safavids. The domination of Sunnis did not mean Shia were rootless in Iran. The writers of The Four Books of Shia were Iranian, as well as many other great Shia scholars. The domination of the Sunni creed during the first nine Islamic centuries characterized the religious history of Iran during this period. There were however some exceptions to this general domination which emerged in the form of the Zaydƒ´s of Tabaristan (see Alid dynasties of northern Iran), the Buyids, the Kakuyids, the rule of Sultan Muhammad Khudabandah (r. Shawwal 703-Shawwal 716/1304-1316) and the Sarbedaran. Apart from this domination there existed, firstly, throughout these nine centuries, Shia inclinations among many Sunnis of this land and, secondly, original Imami Shiism as well as Zaydƒ´ Shiism had prevalence in some parts of Iran. During this period, Shia in Iran were nourished from Kufah, Baghdad and later from Najaf and Hillah. Shiism was the dominant sect in Tabaristan, Qom, Kashan, Avaj and Sabzevar. In many other areas merged population of Shia and Sunni lived together. During the 10th and 11th centuries, Fatimids sent Ismailis Da'i (missioners) to Iran as well as other Muslim lands. When Ismailis divided into two sects, Nizaris established their base in Iran. Hassan-i Sabbah conquered fortresses and captured Alamut in 1090 AD. Nizaris used this fortress until a Mongol raid in 1256. After the Mongol raid and fall of the Abbasids, Sunni hierarchies faltered. Not only did they lose the caliphate but also the status of official madhhab. Their loss was the gain of Shia, whose centre wasn't in Iran at that time. Several local Shia dynasties like Sarbadars were established during this time. The main change occurred in the beginning of the 16th century, when Ismail I founded the Safavid dynasty and initiated a religious policy to recognize Shi'a Islam as the official religion of the Safavid Empire, and the fact that modern Iran remains an officially Shi'ite state is a direct result of Ismail's actions. = Timurid Empire (1370‚Äì1507) = A map of the Timurid Empire.

Like its predecessors, the Timurid Empire was also part of the Persianate world. After establishing a power base in Transoxiana, Timur invaded Iran in 1381 and eventually conquered most of it. Timur's campaigns were known for their brutality; many people were slaughtered and several cities were destroyed.This section incorporates test from the public domain Library of Congress Country Studies Facial reconstruction of alt= His regime was characterized by tyranny and bloodshed, but also by its inclusion of Iranians in administrative roles and its promotion of architecture and poetry. His successors, the Timurids, maintained a hold on most of Iran until 1452, when they lost the bulk of it to Black Sheep Turkmen. The Black Sheep Turkmen were conquered by the White Sheep Turkmen under Uzun Hasan in 1468; Uzun Hasan and his successors were the masters of Iran until the rise of the Safavids. Sufi poet Hafez's popularity became firmly established in the Timurid era that saw the compilation and widespread copying of his divan. Sufis were often persecuted by orthodox Muslims who considered their teachings blasphemous. Sufism developed a symbolic language rich with metaphors to obscure poetic references to provocative philosophical teachings. Hafez concealed his own Sufi faith, even as he employed the secret language of Sufism (developed over hundreds of years) in his own work, and he is sometimes credited with having \\"brought it to perfection\\". His work was imitated by Jami, whose own popularity grew to spread across the full breadth of the Persianate world. =Kara Koyunlu= The Kara Koyunlu were TurkmenEncyclopedia Iranica Subsequently, it came under the control of Turkmen dynasties like the ƒÄq Qoyunl≈´ and Qara Qoyunl≈´ and then of local khanates like those of Qara BƒÅ·∏° and Na·∏µ«∞avƒÅn which formed a buffer region between the Ottomans and Safavids. ‚Äú\\" \\"In a state of demographic stagnation or downturn, the region was an easy prey for nomadic Turkmen.

Aq Qoyunlu emerged when Timur granted them all of Diyar Bakr in present-day Turkey. Afterward, they struggled with their rival Oghuz Turks, the Kara Koyunlu. While the Aq Qoyunlu were successful in defeating Kara Koyunlu, their struggle with the emerging Safavid dynasty led to their downfall.Woods, John E. (1999) The Aqquyunlu: Clan, Confederation, Empire, University of Utah Press, Salt Lake City, p. 128, Early modern era (1502‚Äì1925) Persia underwent a revival under the Safavid dynasty (1502‚Äì1736), the most prominent figure of which was Shah Abbas I. Some historians credit the Safavid dynasty for founding the modern nation-state of Iran. Iran's contemporary Shia character, and significant segments of Iran's current borders take their origin from this era (e.g. Treaty of Zuhab). =Safavid Empire (1501‚Äì1736)= The Safavid Empire at its greatest extent The Safavid dynasty was one of the most significant ruling dynasties of Persia (modern Iran), and \\"is often considered the beginning of modern Persian history\\".

The Safavids ruled from 1501 to 1722 (experiencing a brief restoration from 1729 to 1736) and at their height, they controlled all of modern Iran, Azerbaijan and Armenia, most of Georgia, the North Caucasus, Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan, as well as parts of Turkey, Syria, Pakistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Safavid Iran was one of the Islamic \\"gunpowder empires\\", along with its neighbours, its archrival and principal enemy the Ottoman Empire, as well as the Mughal Empire. The Safavid ruling dynasty was founded by IsmƒÅil, who styled himself ShƒÅh IsmƒÅil I.\\"Ismail Safavi\\" Encyclop√¶dia Iranica. Practically worshipped by his QizilbƒÅsh followers, IsmƒÅil invaded Shirvan to avenge the death of his father, Shaykh Haydar, who had been killed during his siege of Derbent, in Dagestan. Afterwards he went on a campaign of conquest, and following the capture of Tabriz in July 1501, he enthroned himself as the ShƒÅh of Iran,Richard Tapper. \\"Shahsevan in Safavid Persia\\", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 37, No. 3, 1974, p. 324Lawrence Davidson, Arthur Goldschmid, A Concise History of the Middle East, Westview Press, 2006, p. 153\\"Safavid Dynasty\\" , Britannica Concise. Online Edition 2007 minted coins in this name, and proclaimed Shi'ism the official religion of his domain. Although initially the masters of Azerbaijan and southern Dagestan only, the Safavids had, in fact, won the struggle for power in Persia which had been going on for nearly a century between various dynasties and political forces following the fragmentation of the Kara Koyunlu and the Aq Qoyunlu. A year after his victory in Tabriz, IsmƒÅil proclaimed most of Persia as his domain, and quickly conquered and unified Iran under his rule. Soon afterwards, the new Safavid Empire rapidly conquered regions, nations, and peoples in all directions, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, parts of Georgia, Mesopotamia (Iraq), Kuwait, Syria, Dagestan, large parts of what is now Afghanistan, parts of Turkmenistan, and large chunks of Anatolia, laying the foundation of its multi-ethnic character which would heavily influence the empire itself (most notably the Caucasus and its peoples). Portrait of Shah Abbas I Tahmasp I, the son and successor of Ismail I, carried out multiple invasions in the Caucasus which had been incorporated in the Safavid empire since Shah Ismail I and for many centuries afterwards, and started with the trend of deporting and moving hundreds of thousands of Circassians, Georgians, and Armenians to Iran's heartlands. Initially only solely put in the royal harems, royal guards, and minor other sections of the Empire, Tahmasp believed he could eventually reduce the power of the Qizilbash, by creating and fully integrating a new layer in Iranian society. As Encyclop√¶dia Iranica states, for Tahmasp, the problem circled around the military tribal elite of the empire, the Qizilbash, who believed that physical proximity to and control of a member of the immediate Safavid family guaranteed spiritual advantages, political fortune, and material advancement. With this new Caucasian layer in Iranian society, the undisputed might of the Qizilbash (who functioned much like the ghazis of the neighbouring Ottoman Empire) would be questioned and fully diminished as society would become fully meritocratic. Shah Abbas I and his successors would significantly expand this policy and plan initiated by Tahmasp, deporting during his reign alone around some 200,000 Georgians, 300,000 Armenians and 100,000‚Äì150,000 Circassians to Iran, completing the foundation of a new layer in Iranian society. With this, and the complete systematic disorganisation of the Qizilbash by his personal orders, he eventually fully succeeded in replacing the power of the Qizilbash, with that of the Caucasian ghulams. These new Caucasian elements (the so- called ghilman / ÿ∫ŸêŸÑŸíŸÖŸéÿßŸÜ / \\"servants\\"), almost always after conversion to Shi'ism depending on given function would be, were unlike the Qizilbash, fully loyal only to the Shah. The other masses of Caucasians were deployed in all other possible functions and positions available in the empire, as well as in the harem, regular military, craftsmen, farmers, etc. This system of mass usage of Caucasian subjects remained to exist until the fall of the Qajar Dynasty. Rostom (also known as Rustam Khan), viceroy of Kartli, eastern Georgia, from 1633‚Äì1658alt= The greatest of the Safavid monarchs, Shah Abbas I the Great (1587‚Äì1629) came to power in 1587 aged 16. Abbas I first fought the Uzbeks, recapturing Herat and Mashhad in 1598, which had been lost by his predecessor Mohammad Khodabanda by the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1578‚Äì1590). Then he turned against the Ottomans, the archrivals of the Safavids, recapturing Baghdad, eastern Iraq and the Caucasian provinces and beyond by 1618. Between 1616‚Äì1618, following the disobedience of his most loyal Georgian subjects Teimuraz I and Luarsab II, Abbas carried out a punitive campaign in his territories of Georgia, devastating Kakheti and Tbilisi and carrying away 130,000Eskandar Beg, pp. 900‚Äì901, tr. Savory, II, p. 1116 ‚Äì 200,000Malek≈°ƒÅh ·∏§osayn, p. 509 Georgian captives towards mainland Iran. His new army, which had dramatically been improved with the advent of Robert Shirley and his brothers following the first diplomatic mission to Europe, pitted the first crushing victory over the Safavids' archrivals, the Ottomans in the above mentioned 1603‚Äì1618 war and would surpass the Ottomans in military strength. He also used his new force to dislodge the Portuguese from Bahrain (1602) and Hormuz (1622) with aid of the English navy, in the Persian Gulf. He expanded commercial links with the Dutch East India Company and established firm links with the European royal houses, which had been initiated by Ismail I earlier on by the Habsburg‚ÄìPersian alliance. Thus Abbas I was able to break the dependence on the Qizilbash for military might and therefore was able to centralize control. The Safavid dynasty had already established itself during Shah Ismail I, but under Abbas I it really became a major power in the world along with its archrival the Ottoman Empire, against whom it became able to compete with on equal foot. It also started the promotion of tourism in Iran. Under their rule Persian Architecture flourished again and saw many new monuments in various Iranian cities, of which Isfahan is the most notable example. Except for Shah Abbas the Great, Shah Ismail I, Shah Tahmasp I, and Shah Abbas II, many of the Safavid rulers were ineffectual, often being more interested in their women, alcohol and other leisure activities. The end of Abbas II's reign in 1666, marked the beginning of the end of the Safavid dynasty. Despite falling revenues and military threats, many of the later shahs had lavish lifestyles. Shah Soltan Hosain (1694‚Äì1722) in particular was known for his love of wine and disinterest in governance.Mottahedeh, Roy, The Mantle of the Prophet : Religion and Politics in Iran, One World, Oxford, 1985, 2000, p.204 The declining country was repeatedly raided on its frontiers. Finally, Ghilzai Pashtun chieftain named Mir Wais Khan began a rebellion in Kandahar and defeated the Safavid army under the Iranian Georgian governor over the region, Gurgin Khan. In 1722, Peter the Great of neighbouring Imperial Russia launched the Russo-Persian War (1722‚Äì1723), capturing many of Iran's Caucasian territories, including Derbent, Shaki, Baku, but also Gilan, Mazandaran and Astrabad. At the mids of all chaos, in the same year of 1722, an Afghan army led by Mir Wais' son Mahmud marched across eastern Iran, besieged and took Isfahan. Mahmud proclaimed himself 'Shah' of Persia. Meanwhile, Persia's imperial rivals, the Ottomans and the Russians, took advantage of the chaos in the country to seize more territory for themselves.Michael Axworthy, biography of Nader, The Sword of Persia (I.B. Tauris, 2006) pp. 17‚Äì56 By these events, the Safavid dynasty had effectively ended. In 1724, conform the Treaty of Constantinople, the Ottomans and the Russians agreed to divide the newly conquered territories of Iran amongst themselves.Alexander Mikaberidze. Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World ABC-CLIO 2011. p 726 =Nader Shah and his successors= Nader Shah Iran's territorial integrity was restored by a native Iranian Turkic Afshar warlord from Khorasan, Nader Shah. He defeated and banished the Afghans, defeated the Ottomans, reinstalled the Safavids on the throne, and negotiated Russian withdrawal from Iran's Caucasian territories, with the Treaty of Resht and Treaty of Ganja. By 1736, Nader had become so powerful he was able to depose the Safavids and have himself crowned shah. Nader was one of the last great conquerors of Asia and briefly presided over what was probably the most powerful empire in the world. To financially support his wars against Persia's arch-rival, the Ottoman Empire, he fixed his sights on the weak but rich Mughal Empire to the east. In 1739, accompanied by his loyal Caucasian subjects including Erekle II,David Marshall Lang.

On his way back, he also conquered all the Uzbek khanates ‚Äì except for Kokand ‚Äì and made the Uzbeks his vassals. He also firmly re-established Persian rule over the entire Caucasus, Bahrain, as well as large parts of Anatolia and Mesopotamia. Undefeated for years, his defeat in Dagestan, following guerrilla rebellions by the Lezgins and the assassination attempt on him near Mazandaran is often considered the turning point in Nader's impressive career. To his frustration, the Dagestanis resorted to guerrilla warfare, and Nader with his conventional army could make little headway against them.Spencer C. Tucker. \\"A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East\\" p 739 At the Battle of Andalal and the Battle of Avaria, Nader's army was crushingly defeated and he lost half of his entire force, as well forcing him to flee for the mountains.Ramazan Gadzhimuradovich Abdulatipov. \\"Russia and the Caucasus: On the Arduous Path to Unity\\" Edwin Mellen Press, 2000. p 15 Though Nader managed to take most of Dagestan during his campaign, the effective guerrilla warfare as deployed by the Lezgins, but also the Avars and Laks made the Iranian re-conquest of the particular North Caucasian region this time a short lived one; several years later, Nader was forced to withdraw. Around the same time, the assassination attempt was made on him near Mazandaran which accelerated the course of history; he slowly grew ill and megalomaniac, blinding his sons whom he suspected of the assassination attempts, and showing increasing cruelty against his subjects and officers. In his later years this eventually provoked multiple revolts and, ultimately, Nader's assassination in 1747.Axworthy Iran: Empire of the Mind (Penguin, 2008) pp. 152‚Äì167 Nader's death was followed by a period of anarchy in Iran as rival army commanders fought for power. Nader's own family, the Afsharids, were soon reduced to holding on to a small domain in Khorasan. Many of the Caucasian territories broke away in various Caucasian khanates. Ottomans regained lost territories in Anatolia and Mesopotamia. Oman and the Uzbek khanates of Bukhara and Khiva regained independence. Ahmad Shah Durrani, one of Nader's officers, founded an independent state which eventually became modern Afghanistan. Erekle II and Teimuraz II, who, in 1744, had been made the kings of Kakheti and Kartli respectively by Nader himself for their loyal service,Ronald Grigor Suny. \\"The Making of the Georgian Nation\\" Indiana University Press, 1994. p 55 capitalized on the eruption of instability, and declared de facto independence. Erekle II assumed control over Kartli after Teimuraz II's death, thus unifying the two as the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti, becoming the first Georgian ruler in three centuries to preside over a politically unified eastern Georgia,Yar-Shater, Ehsan. Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. 8, parts 4-6 Routledge & Kegan Paul (original from the University of Michigan) p 541 and due to the frantic turn of events in mainland Iran he would be able to remain de facto autonomous through the Zand period. From his capital Shiraz, Karim Khan of the Zand dynasty ruled \\"an island of relative calm and peace in an otherwise bloody and destructive period,\\"Axworthy p.168 however the extent of Zand power was confined to contemporary Iran and parts of the Caucasus. Karim Khan's death in 1779 led to yet another civil war in which the Qajar dynasty eventually triumphed and became kings of Iran. During the civil war, Iran permanently lost Basra in 1779 to the Ottomans, which had been captured during the Ottoman‚ÄìPersian War (1775‚Äì76), and Bahrain to Al Khalifa family after Bani Utbah invasion in 1783. =Qajar dynasty (1796‚Äì1925)= File:Mihr 'Ali (Iranian, active ca. 1800-1830).

Agha Mohammad Khan emerged victorious out of the civil war that commenced with the death of the last Zand king. His reign is noted for the reemergence of a centrally led and united Iran. After the death of Nader Shah and the last of the Zands, most of Iran's Caucasian territories had broken away into various Caucasian khanates. Agha Mohammad Khan, like the Safavid kings and Nader Shah before him, viewed the region as no different than the territories in mainland Iran. Therefore, his first objective after having secured mainland Iran, was to reincorpate the Caucasus region into Iran. Georgia was seen as one of the most integral territories. For Agha Mohammad Khan, the resubjugation and reintegration of Georgia into the Iranian Empire was part of the same process that had brought Shiraz, Isfahan, and Tabriz under his rule. As the Cambridge History of Iran states, its permanent secession was inconceivable and had to be resisted in the same way as one would resist an attempt at the separation of Fars or Gilan. It was therefore natural for Agha Mohammad Khan to perform whatever necessary means in the Caucasus in order to subdue and reincorporate the recently lost regions following Nader Shah's death and the demise of the Zands, including putting down what in Iranian eyes was seen as treason on the part of the wali (viceroy) of Georgia, namely the Georgian king Erekle II (Heraclius II) who was appointed viceroy of Georgia by Nader Shah himself. Agha Mohammad Khan subsequently demanded that Heraclius II renounce its 1783 treaty with Russia, and to submit again to Persian suzerainty, in return for peace and the security of his kingdom. The Ottomans, Iran's neighboring rival, recognized the latter's rights over Kartli and Kakheti for the first time in four centuries.Donald Rayfield. Edge of Empires: A History of Georgia Reaktion Books, 15 feb. 2013 p 255 Heraclius appealed then to his theoretical protector, Empress Catherine II of Russia, pleading for at least 3,000 Russian troops, but he was ignored, leaving Georgia to fend off the Persian threat alone.Lang, David Marshall (1962), A Modern History of Georgia, p. 38. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. Nevertheless, Heraclius II still rejected the Khan's ultimatum.Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994), The Making of the Georgian Nation, p. 59. Indiana University Press, As a response, Agha Mohammad Khan invaded the Caucasus region after crossing the Aras river, and, while on his way to Georgia, he re-subjugated Iran's territories of the Erivan Khanate, Shirvan, Nakhchivan Khanate, Ganja khanate, Derbent Khanate, Baku khanate, Talysh Khanate, Shaki Khanate, Karabakh Khanate, which comprise modern-day Armenia, Azerbaijan, Dagestan, and Igdir. Having reached Georgia with his large army, he prevailed in the Battle of Krtsanisi, which resulted in the capture and sack of Tbilisi, as well as the effective resubjugation of Georgia.Michael Axworthy. Iran: Empire of the Mind: A History from Zoroaster to the Present Day Penguin UK, 6 nov. 2008 Upon his return from his successful campaign in Tbilisi and in effective control over Georgia, together with some 15,000 Georgian captives that were moved back to mainland Iran, Agha Mohammad was formally crowned Shah in 1796 in the Mughan plain, just as his predecessor Nader Shah was about sixty years earlier. Agha Mohammad Shah was later assassinated while preparing a second expedition against Georgia in 1797 in Shusha (now part of the Republic of Azerbaijan) and the seasoned king Heraclius died early in 1798. The reassertion of Iranian hegemony over Georgia did not last long; in 1799 the Russians marched into Tbilisi.Alekseƒ≠ I. Miller. Imperial Rule Central European University Press, 2004 p 204 The Russians were already actively occupied with an expansionist policy towards its neighboring empires to its south, namely the Ottoman Empire and the successive Iranian kingdoms since the late 17th/early 18th century. The next two years following Russia's entrance into Tbilisi were a time of confusion, and the weakened and devastated Georgian kingdom, with its capital half in ruins, was easily absorbed by Russia in 1801. As Iran could not permit or allow the cession of Transcaucasia and Dagestan, which had been an integral part of Iran for centuries, this would lead directly to the wars of several years later, namely the Russo-Persian Wars of 1804-1813 and 1826-1828. The outcome of these two wars (in the Treaty of Gulistan and the Treaty of Turkmenchay, respectively) proved for the irrevocable forced cession and loss of what is now eastern Georgia, Dagestan, Armenia, and Azerbaijan to Imperial Russia.

Following the 1804-1814 War, but also per the 1826-1828 war which ceded the last territories, large migrations, so-called Caucasian Muhajirs, set off to migrate to mainland Iran. Some of these groups included the Ayrums, Qarapapaqs, Circassians, Shia Lezgins, and other Transcaucasian Muslims. After the Battle of Ganja of 1804 during the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813), many thousands of Ayrums and Qarapapaqs were settled in Tabriz. During the remaining part of the 1804-1813 war, as well as through the 1826-1828 war, a large number of the Ayrums and Qarapapaqs that were still remaining in newly conquered Russian territories were settled in and migrated to Solduz (in modern-day Iran's West Azerbaijan province). As the Cambridge History of Iran states; \\"The steady encroachment of Russian troops along the frontier in the Caucasus, General Yermolov's brutal punitive expeditions and misgovernment, drove large numbers of Muslims, and even some Georgian Christians, into exile in Iran.\\" From 1864 until the early 20th century, another mass expulsion took place of Caucasian Muslims as a result of the Russian victory in the Caucasian War. Others simply voluntarily refused to live under Christian Russian rule, and thus departed for Turkey or Iran. These migrations once again, towards Iran, included masses of Caucasian Azerbaijanis, other Transcaucasian Muslims, as well as many North Caucasian Muslims, such as Circassians, Shia Lezgins and Laks.–ê. –ì. –ë—É–ª–∞—Ç–æ–≤–∞. –õ–∞–∫—Ü—ã (XIX ‚Äî –Ω–∞—á.

Many of these migrants would prove to play a pivotal role in further Iranian history, as they formed most of the ranks of the Persian Cossack Brigade, which was established in the late 19th century. The initial ranks of the brigade would be entirely composed of Circassians and other Caucasian Muhajirs. This brigade would prove decisive in the following decades in Qajar history. Furthermore, the 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay included the official rights for the Russian Empire to encourage settling of Armenians from Iran in the newly conquered Russian territories.\\"Griboedov not only extended protection to those Caucasian captives who sought to go home but actively promoted the return of even those who did not volunteer. Large numbers of Georgian and Armenian captives had lived in Iran since 1804 or as far back as 1795.\\" Fisher, William Bayne;Avery, Peter; Gershevitch, Ilya; Hambly, Gavin; Melville, Charles.

At the close of the fourteenth century, after Timur's campaigns, the Timurid Renaissance flourished, and Islam had become the dominant faith, and Armenians became a minority in Eastern Armenia. After centuries of constant warfare on the Armenian Plateau, many Armenians chose to emigrate and settle elsewhere. Following Shah Abbas I's massive relocation of Armenians and Muslims in 1604‚Äì05,Arakel of Tabriz. The Books of Histories; chapter 4. Quote: \\"[The Shah] deep inside understood that he would be unable to resist Sinan Pasha, i.e. the Sardar of Jalaloghlu, in a[n open] battle. Therefore he ordered to relocate the whole population of Armenia - Christians, Jews and Muslims alike, to Persia, so that the Ottomans find the country depopulated.\\" their numbers dwindled even further. At the time of the Russian invasion of Iran, some 80% of the population of Iranian Armenia were Muslims (Persians, Turkics, and Kurds) whereas Christian Armenians constituted a minority of about 20%. As a result of the Treaty of Gulistan (1813) and the Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828), Iran was forced to cede Iranian Armenia (which also constituted the present-day Armenia), to the Russians. After the Russian administration took hold of Iranian Armenia, the ethnic make-up shifted, and thus for the first time in more than four centuries, ethnic Armenians started to form a majority once again in one part of historic Armenia. The new Russian administration encouraged the settling of ethnic Armenians from Iran proper and Ottoman Turkey. As a result, by 1832, the number of ethnic Armenians had matched that of the Muslims. It would be only after the Crimean War and the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, which brought another influx of Turkish Armenians, that ethnic Armenians once again established a solid majority in Eastern Armenia. Nevertheless, the city of Erivan retained a Muslim majority up to the twentieth century. According to the traveller H. F. B. Lynch, the city was about 50% Armenian and 50% Muslim (Azerbaijanis and Persians) in the early 1890s. Fath Ali Shah's reign saw increased diplomatic contacts with the West and the beginning of intense European diplomatic rivalries over Iran. His grandson Mohammad Shah, who succeeded him in 1834, fell under the Russian influence and made two unsuccessful attempts to capture Herat. When Mohammad Shah died in 1848 the succession passed to his son Nasser-e-Din, who proved to be the ablest and most successful of the Qajar sovereigns. He founded the first modern hospital in Iran.Azizi, Mohammad-Hossein. \\"The historical backgrounds of the Ministry of Health foundation in Iran.\\" Arch Iran Med 10.1 (2007): 119-23. =Constitutional Revolution and deposition= The Great Persian Famine of 1870‚Äì1871 is believed to have caused the death of two million people. A new era in the history of Persia dawned with the Persian Constitutional Revolution against the Shah in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Shah managed to remain in power, granting a limited constitution in 1906 (making the country a constitutional monarchy). The first Majlis (parliament) was convened on October 7, 1906. The discovery of petroleum in 1908 by the British in Khuzestan spawned intense renewed interest in Persia by the British Empire (see William Knox D'Arcy and Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, now BP). Control of Persia remained contested between the United Kingdom and Russia, in what became known as The Great Game, and codified in the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, which divided Persia into spheres of influence, regardless of her national sovereignty. During World War I, the country was occupied by British, Ottoman and Russian forces but was essentially neutral (see Persian Campaign). In 1919, after the Russian revolution and their withdrawal, Britain attempted to establish a protectorate in Persia, which was unsuccessful. Finally, the Constitutionalist movement of Gilan and the central power vacuum caused by the instability of the Qajar government resulted in the rise of Reza Khan, who was later to become Reza Shah Pahlavi, and the subsequent establishment of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1925. In 1921, a military coup established Reza Khan, an officer of the Persian Cossack Brigade, as the dominant figure for the next 20 years. Seyyed Zia'eddin Tabatabai was also a leader and important figure in the perpetration of the coup. The coup was not actually directed at the Qajar monarchy; according to Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, it was targeted at officials who were in power and actually had a role in controlling the government; the cabinet and others who had a role in governing Persia.\\"COUP D‚ÄôETAT OF 1299/1921\\". Encyclop√¶dia Iranica. In 1925, after being prime minister for two years, Reza Khan became the first shah of the Pahlavi dynasty. Pahlavi era (1925‚Äì1979) = Reza Shah (1925‚Äì1941) = Reza Shah ruled for almost 16 years until September 16, 1941, when he was forced to abdicate by the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran. He established an authoritarian government that valued nationalism, militarism, secularism and anti-communism combined with strict censorship and state propaganda.Michael P. Zirinsky; \\"Imperial Power and Dictatorship: Britain and the Rise of Reza Shah, 1921‚Äì1926\\", International Journal of Middle East Studies 24 (1992), 639‚Äì663, Cambridge University Press Reza Shah introduced many socio-economic reforms, reorganizing the army, government administration, and finances.The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition: Reza Shah To his supporters his reign brought \\"law and order, discipline, central authority, and modern amenities ‚Äì schools, trains, buses, radios, cinemas, and telephones\\".Ervand, History of Modern Iran, (2008), p.91 However, his attempts of modernisation have been criticised for being \\"too fast\\"The Origins of the Iranian Revolution by Roger Homan.

For example, mosques were required to use chairs; most men were required to wear western clothing, including a hat with a brim; women were encouraged to discard the hijab; men and women were allowed to freely congregate, violating Islamic mixing of the sexes. Tensions boiled over in 1935, when bazaaris and villagers rose up in rebellion at the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad, chanting slogans such as 'The Shah is a new Yezid.' Dozens were killed and hundreds were injured when troops finally quelled the unrest.Bakhash, Shaul, Reign of the Ayatollahs : Iran and the Islamic Revolution by Shaul, Bakhash, Basic Books, c1984, p.22 =World War II= German interests held great influence within Iran in 1941, with the Germans staging a coup in an attempt to overthrow the Pahlavi dynasty. With German armies highly successful against Russia, the Iranian government expected Germany to win the war and establish a powerful force on its borders. It rejected British and Russian demands to expel the Germans. In response the Allies invaded in August 1941, and easily overwhelmed the weak Iranian army in Operation Countenance. Iran became the major conduit of Allied Lend-Lease aid to the Soviet Union. The purpose was to secure Iranian oil fields and ensure Allied supply lines (see Persian Corridor) . Iran remained officially neutral. Its monarch RezƒÅ ShƒÅh was deposed during the subsequent occupation and replaced with his young son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.Richard Stewart, Sunrise at Abadan: the British and Soviet invasion of Iran, 1941 (1988). At the Tehran Conference of 1943, the Allies issued the Tehran Declaration guaranteed the post-war independence and boundaries of Iran. However, when the war actually ended, Soviet troops stationed in northwestern Iran not only refused to withdraw but backed revolts that established short-lived, pro-Soviet separatist national states in the northern regions of Azerbaijan and Iranian Kurdistan, the Azerbaijan People's Government and the Republic of Kurdistan respectively, in late 1945. Soviet troops did not withdraw from Iran proper until May 1946 after receiving a promise of oil concessions. The Soviet republics in the north were soon overthrown and the oil concessions were revoked.Louise Fawcett, \\"Revisiting the Iranian Crisis of 1946: How Much More Do We Know?.\\" Iranian Studies 47#3 (2014): 379‚Äì399.Gary R. Hess, \\"the Iranian Crisis of 1945‚Äì46 and the Cold War.\\" Political Science Quarterly 89#1 (1974): 117‚Äì146. online =Mohammad-Reza Shah (1941‚Äì1979)= Tehran men celebrating the 1953 Iranian coup d'√©tat Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Initially there were hopes that post-occupation Iran could become a constitutional monarchy. The new, young Shah Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi initially took a very hands-off role in government, and allowed parliament to hold a lot of power. Some elections were held in the first shaky years, although they remained mired in corruption. Parliament became chronically unstable, and from the 1947 to 1951 period Iran saw the rise and fall of six different prime ministers. Pahlavi increased his political power by convening the Iran Constituent Assembly, 1949, which finally formed the Senate of Iran‚Äîa legislative upper house allowed for in the 1906 constitution but never brought into being. The new senators were largely supportive of Pahlavi, as he had intended. In 1951 Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq received the vote required from the parliament to nationalize the British-owned oil industry, in a situation known as the Abadan Crisis. Despite British pressure, including an economic blockade, the nationalization continued. Mosaddeq was briefly removed from power in 1952 but was quickly re-appointed by the shah, due to a popular uprising in support of the premier and he, in turn, forced the Shah into a brief exile in August 1953 after a failed military coup by Imperial Guard Colonel Nematollah Nassiri. 1953: U.S. organized coup removes Mosaddeq Shortly thereafter on August 19 a successful coup was headed by retired army general Fazlollah Zahedi, organized by the United States (CIA) with the active support of the British (MI6) (known as Operation Ajax and Operation Boot to the respective agencies). The coup‚Äîwith a black propaganda campaign designed to turn the population against Mosaddeq G√∂lz, \\"The Dangerous Classes and the 1953 Coup in Iran.

Mosaddeq was arrested and tried for treason. Found guilty, his sentence reduced to house arrest on his family estate while his foreign minister, Hossein Fatemi, was executed. Zahedi succeeded him as prime minister, and suppressed opposition to the Shah, specifically the National Front and Communist Tudeh Party. 1971 film about Iran under the Shah Iran was ruled as an autocracy under the shah with American support from that time until the revolution. The Iranian government entered into agreement with an international consortium of foreign companies which ran the Iranian oil facilities for the next 25 years splitting profits fifty-fifty with Iran but not allowing Iran to audit their accounts or have members on their board of directors. In 1957 martial law was ended after 16 years and Iran became closer to the West, joining the Baghdad Pact and receiving military and economic aid from the US. In 1961, Iran initiated a series of economic, social, agrarian and administrative reforms to modernize the country that became known as the Shah's White Revolution. The core of this program was land reform. Modernization and economic growth proceeded at an unprecedented rate, fueled by Iran's vast petroleum reserves, the third- largest in the world. However the reforms, including the White Revolution, did not greatly improve economic conditions and the liberal pro-Western policies alienated certain Islamic religious and political groups. In early June 1963 several days of massive rioting occurred in support of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini following the cleric's arrest for a speech attacking the shah. Two years later, premier Hassan Ali Mansur was assassinated and the internal security service, SAVAK, became more violently active. In the 1970s leftist guerilla groups such as Mujaheddin-e-Khalq (MEK), emerged and attacked regime and foreign targets. Nearly a hundred Iran political prisoners were killed by the SAVAK during the decade before the revolution and many more were arrested and tortured.Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions (1999), pp. 135‚Äì6, 167, 169 The Islamic clergy, headed by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (who had been exiled in 1964), were becoming increasingly vociferous. Iran greatly increased its defense budget and by the early 1970s was the region's strongest military power. Bilateral relations with its neighbor Iraq were not good, mainly due to a dispute over the Shatt al-Arab waterway. In November 1971, Iranian forces seized control of three islands at the mouth of the Persian Gulf; in response, Iraq expelled thousands of Iranian nationals. Following a number of clashes in April 1969, Iran abrogated the 1937 accord and demanded a renegotiation. In mid-1973, the Shah returned the oil industry to national control. Following the Arab-Israeli War of October 1973, Iran did not join the Arab oil embargo against the West and Israel. Instead, it used the situation to raise oil prices, using the money gained for modernization and to increase defense spending. A border dispute between Iraq and Iran was resolved with the signing of the Algiers Accord on March 6, 1975. Revolution and the Islamic Republic (1979‚Äìpresent) Ayatollah Khomeini returns to Iran after 14 years exile in France on 1 February 1979. The Iranian Revolution, also known as the Islamic Revolution,Islamic Revolution, Iran Chamber. was the revolution that transformed Iran from an absolute monarchy under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, to an Islamic republic under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, one of the leaders of the revolution and founder of the Islamic Republic. Its time span can be said to have begun in January 1978 with the first major demonstrations,The Iranian Revolution. and concluded with the approval of the new theocratic Constitution‚Äîwhereby Ayatollah Khomeini became Supreme Leader of the country‚Äîin December 1979.Ruhollah Khomeini , Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. In between, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi left the country for exile in January 1979 after strikes and demonstrations paralyzed the country, and on February 1, 1979 Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Tehran. The final collapse of the Pahlavi dynasty occurred shortly after on February 11 when Iran's military declared itself \\"neutral\\" after guerrillas and rebel troops overwhelmed troops loyal to the Shah in armed street fighting. Iran officially became an Islamic Republic on April 1, 1979, when Iranians overwhelmingly approved a national referendum to make it so.Iran Islamic Republic, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. = Ideology of the 1979 Iranian Revolution = The ideology of revolutionary government was populist, nationalist and most of all Shi'a Islamic. Its unique constitution is based on the concept of velayat-e faqih the idea advanced by Khomeini that Muslims ‚Äì in fact everyone ‚Äì requires \\"guardianship\\", in the form of rule or supervision by the leading Islamic jurist or jurists.Dabashi, Theology of Discontent (1993), p.419, 443 Khomeini served as this ruling jurist, or supreme leader, until his death in 1989. Iran's rapidly modernising, capitalist economy was replaced by populist and Islamic economic and cultural policies. Much industry was nationalized, laws and schools Islamicized, and Western influences banned. The Islamic revolution also created great impact around the world. In the non-Muslim world it has changed the image of Islam, generating much interest in the politics and spirituality of Islam,Shawcross, William, The Shah's Last Ride (1988), p. 110. along with \\"fear and distrust towards Islam\\" and particularly the Islamic Republic and its founder.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p.138 =Khomeini Takes Power (1979‚Äì1989)= Khomeini served as leader of the revolution or as Supreme Leader of Iran from 1979 to his death on June 3, 1989. This era was dominated by the consolidation of the revolution into a theocratic republic under Khomeini, and by the costly and bloody war with Iraq. The consolidation lasted until 1982‚Äì3,Encyclopedia of Islam and Muslim World, Thomson Gale, 2004, p.357 (article by Stockdale, Nancy, L.)Keddie, Modern Iran, (2006), p.241 as Iran coped with the damage to its economy, military, and apparatus of government, and protests and uprisings by secularists, leftists, and more traditional Muslims‚Äîformerly ally revolutionaries but now rivals‚Äîwere effectively suppressed. Many political opponents were executed by the new regimes. Following the events of the revolution, Marxist guerrillas and federalist parties revolted in some regions comprising Khuzistan, Kurdistan and Gonbad-e Qabus, which resulted in severe fighting between rebels and revolutionary forces. These revolts began in April 1979 and lasted between several months to over a year, depending on the region. The Kurdish uprising, led by the KDPI, was the most violent, lasting until 1983 and resulting in 10,000 casualties. In the summer of 1979 a new constitution giving Khomeini a powerful post as guardian jurist Supreme Leader and a clerical Council of Guardians power over legislation and elections, was drawn up by an Assembly of Experts for Constitution. The new constitution was approved by referendum in December 1979.  Iran hostage crisis (1979‚Äì1981) An early event in the history of the Islamic republic that had a long-term impact was the Iran hostage crisis. Following the admitting of the former Shah of Iran into the United States for cancer treatment, on November 4, 1979, Iranian students seized US embassy personnel, labeling the embassy a \\"den of spies.\\"PBS, American Experience, Jimmy Carter, \\"444 Days: America Reacts\\", retrieved 1 October 2007 Fifty-two hostages were held for 444 days until January 1981.Guests of the Ayatollah: The Iran Hostage Crisis: The First Battle in America's War with Militant Islam, Mark Bowden, p. 127, 200 An American military attempt to rescue the hostages failed. The takeover was enormously popular in Iran, where thousands gathered in support of the hostage takers, and it is thought to have strengthened the prestige of the Ayatollah Khomeini and consolidated the hold of anti-Americanism. It was at this time that Khomeini began referring to America as the \\"Great Satan.\\" In America, where it was considered a violation of the long-standing principle of international law that diplomats may be expelled but not held captive, it created a powerful anti-Iranian backlash. Relations between the two countries have remained deeply antagonistic and American international sanctions have hurt Iran's economy.History Of US Sanctions Against Iran, Middle East Economic Survey, 26 August 2002  Iran‚ÄìIraq War (1980‚Äì1988)  An Iranian soldier with gas mask during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War During this political and social crisis, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein attempted to take advantage of the disorder of the Revolution, the weakness of the Iranian military and the revolution's antagonism with Western governments. The once-strong Iranian military had been disbanded during the revolution, and with the Shah ousted, Hussein had ambitions to position himself as the new strong man of the Middle East, and sought to expand Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf by acquiring territories that Iraq had claimed earlier from Iran during the Shah's rule. Of chief importance to Iraq was Khuzestan which not only boasted a substantial Arab population, but rich oil fields as well. On the unilateral behalf of the United Arab Emirates, the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs became objectives as well. With these ambitions in mind, Hussein planned a full-scale assault on Iran, boasting that his forces could reach the capital within three days. On September 22, 1980, the Iraqi army invaded Iran at Khuzestan, precipitating the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. The attack took revolutionary Iran completely by surprise. Although Saddam Hussein's forces made several early advances, Iranian forces had pushed the Iraqi army back into Iraq by 1982. Khomeini sought to export his Islamic revolution westward into Iraq, especially on the majority Shi'a Arabs living in the country. The war then continued for six more years until 1988, when Khomeini, in his words, \\"drank the cup of poison\\" and accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations. Tens of thousands of Iranian civilians and military personnel were killed when Iraq used chemical weapons in its warfare. Iraq was financially backed by Egypt, the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf, the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact states, the United States (beginning in 1983), France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China (which also sold weapons to Iran). There were more than 182.000 Kurdish victimsCentre for Documents of The Imposed War, Tehran. (ŸÖÿ±⁄©ÿ≤ ŸÖÿ∑ÿßŸÑÿπÿßÿ™ Ÿà ÿ™ÿ≠ŸÇ€åŸÇÿßÿ™ ÿ¨ŸÜ⁄Ø) of Iraq's chemical weapons during the eight-year war. The total Iranian casualties of the war were estimated to be between 500,000 and 1,000,000. Almost all relevant international agencies have confirmed that Saddam engaged in chemical warfare to blunt Iranian human wave attacks; these agencies unanimously confirmed that Iran never used chemical weapons during the war. Starting on 19 July 1988 and lasting about five months the government systematically executed thousands of political prisoners across Iran. This is commonly referred to as the 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners or the 1988 Iranian Massacre. The main target was the membership of the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), although a lesser number of political prisoners from other leftist groups were also included such as the Tudeh Party of Iran (Communist Party).Iranian party demands end to repression Abrahamian, Ervand, Tortured Confessions, University of California Press, 1999, 209‚Äì228 Estimates of the number executed vary from 1,400Massacre 1988 (Pdf) to 30,000. =Rule under Khamenei (1989‚Äìpresent)= The first eight years (1989‚Äì1997)  On his deathbed in 1989, Khomeini appointed a 25-man Constitutional Reform Council which named then president Ali Khamenei as the next Supreme Leader, and made a number of changes to Iran's constitution.Abrahamian, History of Modern Iran, (2008), p.182 A smooth transition followed Khomeini's death on June 3, 1989. While Khamenei lacked Khomeini's \\"charisma and clerical standing\\", he developed a network of supporters within Iran's armed forces and its economically powerful religious foundations.\\"Who's in Charge?\\" by Ervand Abrahamian London Review of Books, 6 November 2008 Under his reign Iran's regime is said ‚Äì by at least one observer ‚Äì to resemble more \\"a clerical oligarchy ... than an autocracy.\\" Succeeding Khamenei as president was pragmatic conservative Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who served two four-year terms and focused his efforts on rebuilding Iran's economy and war-damaged infrastructure though low oil prices hampered this endeavor. He sought to restore confidence in the government among the general population by privatizing the companies that had been nationalized in the first few years of the Islamic Republic, as well as by bringing in qualified technocrats to manage the economy. The state of their economy also influenced the government to move towards ending their diplomatic isolation. This was achieved through the reestablishment of normalized relations with neighbors such as Saudi Arabia and an attempt to improve its reputation in the region with assertions that its revolution was not exportable to other states.Treacherous Alliance : the secret dealings of Israel, Iran and the United States by Trita Pasri, Yale University Press, 2007, p.145 During the Persian Gulf War in 1991 the country remained neutral, restricting its action to the condemnation of the U.S. and allowing fleeing Iraqi aircraft and refugees into the country. Iran in the 1990s had a greater secular behavior and admiration for Western popular culture than in the previous decades, it had become a way in which the urban population expressed their resentment at the invasive Islamic policies of the government. The pressures from the population placed on the new Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led to an uneasy alliance between him and President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Through this alliance they attempted to hinder the ulama's ability to gain further control of the state. In 1989, they created a sequence of constitutional amendments that removed the office of prime minister and increased the scope of presidential power. However, these new amendments did not curtail the powers of the Supreme Leader of Iran in any way; this position still contained the ultimate authority over the armed forces, the making of war and peace, the final say in foreign policy, and the right to intervene in the legislative process whenever he deemed it necessary. Reforms and consequences (1997‚Äì2005) Mohammad Khatami, reformist President of Iran from 1997 to 2005 President Rafsanjani's economic policies that led to greater relations with the outside world and his government's relaxation on the enforcement certain regulations on social behavior were met with some responses of widespread disenchantment among the general population with the ulama as rulers of the country. This led to the defeat of the government's candidate for president in 1997, who had the backing of the supreme Islamic jurist. He was beaten by an independent candidate from the reformist, Mohammad Khatami. He received 69% of the vote and enjoyed particular support from two groups of the population that had felt ostracized by the practices of the state: women and youth. The younger generations in the country had been too young to experience the shah's regime or the revolution that ended it, and now they resented the restrictions placed on their daily lives under the Islamic Republic. Mohammad Khatami's presidency was soon marked by tensions between the reform-minded government and an increasingly conservative and vocal clergy. This rift reached a climax in July 1999 when massive anti-government protests erupted in the streets of Tehran. The disturbances lasted over a week before police and pro-government vigilantes dispersed the crowds. Khatami was re-elected in June 2001 but his efforts were repeatedly blocked by the conservatives in the parliament. Conservative elements within Iran's government moved to undermine the reformist movement, banning liberal newspapers and disqualifying candidates for parliamentary elections. This clampdown on dissent, combined with the failure of Khatami to reform the government, led to growing political apathy among Iran's youth. In June 2003, anti-government protests by several thousand students took place in Tehran.Uprising in Iran Several human rights protests also occurred in 2006.  2005 presidential election and consequences (2005‚Äì2009)  In 2005 Iranian presidential election, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, mayor of Tehran, became the sixth president of Iran, after winning 62 percent of the vote in the run- off poll, against former president Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. During the authorization ceremony he kissed Khamenei's hand in demonstration of his loyalty to him. During this time, the American invasion of Iraq, overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime and empowerment of its Shi'a majority, all strengthened Iran's position in the region particularly in the mainly Shi'a south of Iraq, where a top Shia leader in the week of September 3, 2006 renewed demands for an autonomous Shi'a region. At least one commentator (Former U.S. Defense Secretary William S. Cohen) has stated that as of 2009 Iran's growing power has eclipsed anti-Zionism as the major foreign policy issue in the Middle East. During 2005 and 2006, there were claims that the United States and Israel were planning to attack Iran, with the most cited reason being Iran's civilian nuclear energy program which the United States and some other states fear could lead to a nuclear weapons program. China and Russia opposed military action of any sort and opposed economic sanctions. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei issued a fatwa forbidding the production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons. The fatwa was cited in an official statement by the Iranian government at an August 2005 meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna.Iran, holder of peaceful nuclear fuel cycle technology In 2009, Ahmadinejad's reelection was hotly disputed and marred by large protests that formed the \\"greatest domestic challenge\\" to the leadership of the Islamic Republic \\"in 30 years\\". The resulting social unrest is widely known as the Iranian Green Movement. Reformist opponent Mir-Hossein Mousavi and his supporters alleged voting irregularities and by 1 July 2009, 1000 people had been arrested and 20 killed in street demonstrations. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and other Islamic officials blamed foreign powers for fomenting the protest.  2013 presidential election and improving US‚ÄìIran relations (2013‚Äìpresent)  On 15 June 2013, Hassan Rouhani won the presidential election in Iran, with a total number of 36,704,156 ballots cast; Rouhani won 18,613,329 votes. In his press conference one day after election day, Rouhani reiterated his promise to recalibrate Iran's relations with the world. On April 2, 2015, following eight days of tortuous discussions in Switzerland, which lasted through the night to Thursday, Iran and six world powers (United States, United Kingdom, France, China and Russia plus Germany) agreed on the outlines of an understanding to limit Iran's nuclear programs, negotiators indicated, as both sides prepared for announcements. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted: \\"Found solutions. Ready to start drafting immediately.\\" European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini tweeted that she would meet the press with Zarif after a final meeting of the seven nations in the nuclear talks. She wrote: \\"Good news.\\" Reading out a joint statement, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini hailed what she called a \\"decisive step\\" after more than a decade of work. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif followed with the same statement in Persian. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and the top diplomats of Britain, France and Germany also briefly took the stage behind them. The deal is intended to be a provisional framework for a comprehensive agreement and was signed in 2015, and marked a significant breakthrough in the 12-year history of negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme. When Donald Trump was campaigning to become President of the US, he repeatedly said he would abandon the Iran nuclear deal. After he was appointed[elected] president, the USA announced to withdraw from the agreement on the 8th of May 2018. The Iranian backed group known as Kataib Hezbollah attacked the United States embassy in Baghdad on December 31, 2019. On January 3, 2020, the United States military executed a drone strike at Baghdad Airport, killing Qasem Soleimani, the leader of the Quds Force, an elite branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Like the rest of the Mediterranean side of the Iberian Peninsula, the area was occupied by the Iberians and several Greek colonies were established on the coast before the Roman conquest. It was the first area of Hispania conquered by the Romans. It then came under Visigothic rule after the collapse of the western part of the Roman Empire. In 718, the area was occupied by the Umayyad Caliphate and became a part of Muslim ruled al-Andalus. The Frankish Empire conquered the area from the Muslims, ending with the conquest of Barcelona in 801, as part of the creation of a larger buffer zone of Christian counties against Islamic rule known as the Marca Hispanica. In the 10th century the County of Barcelona became progressively independent from Frankish rule. In 1137, Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona accepted King Ramiro II of Aragon's proposal to marry Queen Petronila, establishing the dynastic union of the County of Barcelona with the Kingdom of Aragon, creating the Crown of Aragon, while the County of Barcelona and the other Catalan counties adopted a common polity known as Principality of Catalonia,Sesma Mu√±oz, Jos√© Angel. La Corona de Arag√≥n. Una introducci√≥n cr√≠tica. Zaragoza: Caja de la Inmaculada, 2000 (Colecci√≥n Mariano de Pano y Ruata - Dir. Guillermo Fat√°s Cabeza). . which developed an institutional system (Courts, constitutions, Generalitat) that limited the power of the kings. Catalonia contributed to the expansion of the Crown's trade and military, most significantly their navy. The Catalan language flourished and expanded as more territories were added to the Crown of Aragon, including Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Sardinia, Sicily, Naples, and Athens. The crisis of the 14th century, the end of the reign of House of Barcelona and a civil war (1462‚Äì1472) weakened the role of the Principality in Crown and international affairs. The marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in 1469 created a dynastic union between the Crowns of Aragon and Castile, and both realms kept their own laws, institutions, borders and currency. In 1492 the Spanish colonization of the Americas began, political power began to shift away towards Castile. Tensions between Catalan institutions and the Monarchy, alongside the economic crisis and the peasants' revolts, caused the Reapers' War (1640‚Äì1652), being briefly proclaimed a Catalan Republic. The Principality of Catalonia retained its political status, but this came to an end after the War of Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì1714), in which the Crown of Aragon supported the claim of the Archduke Charles of Habsburg. Following Catalan surrender on 11 September 1714, the king Philip V of Bourbon, inspired by the model of France imposed a unifying administration across Spain, suppressing the Crown of Aragon and enacted the Nueva Planta decrees, banning the main Catalan political institutions and rights and merged into Castile as a province. These led to the eclipse of Catalan as a language of government and literature. Catalonia experienced economic growth, reinforced in the late 18th century when C√°diz's trade monopoly with American colonies ended. In the 19th century Catalonia was severely affected by the Napoleonic and Carlist Wars. The Napoleonic occupation and subsequent war in Spain began a period of political and economic turmoil. In the second third of the century, Catalonia became a center of industrialization. As wealth from the industrial expansion grew, Catalonia saw a cultural renaissance coupled with incipient nationalism while several workers movements (particularly anarchism) appeared. In the 20th century, Catalonia enjoyed and lost varying degrees of autonomy. The Second Spanish Republic established Catalan self- governance and the official use of the Catalan language. Like much of Spain, Catalonia fought to defend the Republic in the Civil War of 1936‚Äì1939. The Republican defeat established the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, which unleashed a harsh repression and suppressed the autonomy. With Spain devastated and cut off from international trade and the autarkic politics of the regime, Catalonia, as an industrial center, suffered severely; the economic recovery was slow. Between 1959 and 1974 Spain experienced the second-fastest economic expansion in the world known as the Spanish Miracle, and Catalonia prospered as Spain's most important industrial and tourist destination. In 1975 Franco died, bringing his regime to an end, and the new democratic Spanish constitution of 1978 recognised Catalonia's autonomy and language. It regained considerable self-government in internal affairs and is now one of the most economically dynamic communities of Spain. In the 2010s there have been growing calls for Catalan independence.  Prehistory  The caves of El Cogul contain paintings protected as part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site The first known human settlements in what is now Catalonia were at the beginning of the Middle Palaeolithic. The oldest known trace of human occupation is a mandible found in Banyoles, described by some sources as pre- Neanderthal some 200,000 years old; other sources suggest it to be only about one third that old.. Some of the most important prehistoric remains were found in the caves of Mollet (Seriny√†, Pla de l'Estany), the Cau del Duc in the Montgr√≠ mountain (\\"cau\\" meaning \\"cave\\" or \\"lair\\"), the remains at Forn d'en Sugranyes (Reus) and the shelters Roman√≠ and Agut (Capellades), while those of the Upper Paleolithic are found at Reclau Viver, the cave of Arbreda and la Bora Gran d'en Carreres, in Seriny√†, or the Cau de les Goges, in Sant Juli√† de Ramis. From the next prehistoric era, the Epipaleolithic or Mesolithic, important remains survive, the greater part dated between 8000 BC and 5000 BC, such as those of Sant Gregori (Falset) and el Filador (Margalef de Montsant).Garc√≠a-Arg√ºelles, P.; Nadal, J.; Fullola, J.M (2005). El abrigo del filador (Margalef de Montsant, Tarragona) y su contextualizaci√≥n cultural y cronol√≥gica en el nordeste peninsular, Trabajos de Prehistoria 62, num. 1, 2005, pp. 65‚Äì83. The Neolithic era began in Catalonia around 4500 BC, although the population was slower to develop fixed settlements than in other places, thanks to the abundance of woods, which allowed the continuation of a fundamentally hunter-gatherer culture. The most important Neolithic remains in Catalonia are the Cave of Fontmajor (l'Espluga de Francol√≠), The Cave of Toll (Mor√†), the caves Gran and Freda (Montserrat), the shelters of Cogul and Ulldecona, or La Draga, an early Neolithic village which dates from the end of the 6th millennium BC.Tarrus, Josep. ‚ÄúLa Draga (Banyoles, Catalonia), an Early Neolithic Lakeside Village in Mediterranean Europe.‚Äù CATALAN HISTORICAL REVIEW, vol. 1, 2008, pp. 17‚Äì33. The Chalcolithic or Eneolithic period developed in Catalonia between 2500 and 1800 BC, with the beginning of the construction of copper objects. The Bronze Age occurred between 1800 and 700 BC. There are few remnants of this era, but there were some known settlements in the low Segre zone. The Bronze Age coincided with the arrival of the Indo- Europeans through the Urnfield Culture, whose successive waves of migration began around 1200 BC, and they were responsible for the creation of the first proto-urban settlements.J. Maluquer de Motes: \\"Late Bronze and Early Iron in the valley of the Ebro\\" (The Europea Community in Later Prehistory. Studies in honour of C. F. C. Hawkes; Routledge & Kegan 1971, pp. 107‚Äì120) Around the middle of the 7th century BC, the Iron Age arrived in Catalonia. = Archaeology = A group of archaeologists team headed by Josep Maria Verg√®s revealed a cave full of prehistoric carvings of horses, bulls and some symbols dated 15,000 years back at Cave Font Major in 2020. The extraordinary aspect of the discovered cave is that it is directly carved onto the soft surface of the rock.  Ancient history  = The rise of the Iberian culture = Ethnology of Iberia before the Roman conquest, c. 300 BC Ancient silver vessel from the Tivissa Treasure, c. 500 BC. Archaeology Museum of Catalonia An iron using culture first appeared in eastern Iberia in the 8th century BC. By the 5th century BC, the Iron Age Iberian civilization had become consolidated on the eastern side of the Iberian Peninsula. What is now the Catalan territory was home to several distinct tribes of Iberians: the Indigetes in Empord√†, the Ceretani in Cerdanya and the Airenosins in the Val d'Aran. Some urban agglomerations became relevant, including Ilerda (Lleida) inland, Hibera (perhaps Amposta or Tortosa) or Indika (Ullastret). The settlement of Castellet de Banyoles in Tivissa was one of the most important ancient Iberian settlements. This, situated in the northeast of the peninsula, was discovered in 1912. Also, the 'Treasure of Tivissa', a unique collection of silver Iberian votive offerings was found here in 1927.Castellet de Banyoles (Tivissa) Museu d'Arqueologia de Catalunya Iberian society was divided into different classes, including kings or chieftains, nobles, priests, artisans and slaves. Iberian aristocracy, often called a \\"senate\\" by the ancient sources, met in a council of nobles. Kings or chieftains would maintain their forces through a system of obligation or vassalage that the Romans termed \\"fides\\". The Iberians adopted wine and olives from the Greeks; Horse breeding was of particular importance to the Iberian nobility. Mining was a major contributor to the economy, from which fine metalwork and high-quality iron weapons could be produced. The Iberian language was a Paleohispanic language. The oldest inscriptions are dated from the end of the 5th century BC, and the most recent of the end of the first century BC, even at the beginning of the 1st century AD, after being gradually replaced by Latin. In its different variants, the Iberian language was spoken in a broad coastal strip stretching from southern Languedoc to Alicante. At this time, the Greek trading city of Emp√∫ries (in Greek Emporion, meaning market, in Latin Emporiae), was founded on the coast by the Greek city of Phocaea in the 6th century BC. Situated on the coastal commercial route between Massalia (Marseille) and Tartessos in the far south of Hispania, the city became a center of economic and commercial activity. Another known Greek colony was Rhode (Roses), located on the coast at the northern end of the Gulf of Roses. = Roman times (200 B.C‚Äì400 A.D) = Arc de Ber√† (Roda de Ber√†, Tarragona) Romanization brought a second, distinct stage in the ancient history of Catalonia. Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus arrived in Emp√∫ries in 218 BC, with the objective of cutting off the sources of provisions of Hannibal's Carthaginian army during the Second Punic War. After the Carthaginian defeat, and the defeat of various Iberian tribes who rose up against Roman rule, 195 BC saw the effective completion of the Roman conquest of the territory that later became Catalonia. Romanization of the region began in earnest. The various tribes were absorbed into a common Roman culture and lost many distinct characteristics, including differences of language. Most local leaders were later admitted into the Roman aristocratic class. Most of what is now Catalonia first became part of the Roman province of Hispania Citerior; after 27 BC, they became part of Tarraconensis, whose capital was Tarraco (now Tarragona). Other important cities of the Roman period are Ilerda (Lleida), Dertosa (Tortosa), Gerunda (Girona) as well as the ports of Empuri√¶ (former Emporion) and Barcino (Barcelona). As for the rest of Hispania, Latin law was granted to all cities under the reign of Vespasian (69-79 AD), while Roman citizenship was permitted to all free men of the Empire by the Edict of Caracalla in 212 AD (Tarraco, the capital, was already a colony of Roman law since 45 BC). It was a rich agricultural province (olive oil, vine, wheat), and the first centuries of the Empire saw the construction of roads (the most important being the Via Augusta, parallel to Mediterranean coastline) and infrastructure like aqueducts. The Crisis of the Third Century affected the whole Roman Empire, and gravely affected the Catalan territory, where there is evidence of significant levels of destruction and abandonment of Roman villas. This period also provides the first documentary evidence of the arrival of Christianity. Conversion to Christianity, attested in the 3rd century, was completed in urban areas in the 4th century. The first Christian communities in the Tarraconense were founded during the 3rd century, and the diocese of Tarraco was already established by 259, when the bishop Saint Fructuosus (Fructu√≥s) and the deacons Augurius and Eulogius were burned alive on the orders of the governor Aemilianus, under an edict issued by the emperor Valerian. Although Hispania remained under Roman rule and did not fall under the rule of Vandals, Swabians and Alans in the 5th century, the main cities suffered frequent sacking and some deurbanization. While archaeological evidence shows the recovery of some urban nuclei, such as Barcino (later Barcelona), Tarraco (later Tarragona), and Gerunda (later Girona), the previous situation was not restored: the cities became smaller, and constructed defensive walls.  From late antiquity to feudalism (400‚Äì1100)  = Visigothic and Muslim rule = Military fortress (suda) of Tortosa In the 5th century, as part of the invasion of the Roman Empire by Germanic tribes, the Visigoths led by Athaulf, installed themselves in the Tarraconensis (Ebro basin, 410) and when in 475 the Visigothic king Euric formed the kingdom of Tolosa (modern Toulouse), he incorporated the territory equivalent to present- day Catalonia. Later, the Visigothic kingdom lost most of its territory north of the Pyrenees and shifted its capital to Toledo. The Visigothic Kingdom in Hispania lasted until the early 8th century. The Visigothic Kingdom respected and adopted the provincial system inherited from the Romans, the Tarraconense was maintained, but after the establishment of the new province of Cantabria its extension was reduced to the Valley of the Ebro and the current Catalonia. Beginning in 654, king Recceswinth ordered the promulgation of the Liber Iudiciorum (\\"Book of the Judges\\"), which was the first law code that applied equally to the Goths and to the Hispano-Roman population. This compilation will be in vigor in Catalan counties until the compilation of the Usages of Barcelona by count Ramon Berenguer I, largely based on the same Liber Iudiciorum. Between 672 and 673, the eastern part of the Tarraconenis (modern Catalonia) and the province of Septimania rebelled against king Wamba, appointing dux Flavius Paulus as king in Narbonne.Bishop Julian of Toledo, in his History of King Wamba, accuses Paul of crowning himself with a votive crown King Reccared (the king who converted the Visigoths from Arianism to Catholicism) had dedicated to the body of St. Felix in Girona. Historia Wambae Regis in MGH, Scriptorum rerum Merovingicarum t. V, p. 522. The rebellion was crushed by Wamba. In 714, the Umayyad forces reached the northeastern part of the peninsula, where some important clashes took place (Zaragoza, possibly Barcelona). In 720, Narbonne fell to the joint Arab-Berber forces, followed by the conquest of what remained of the Visigothic kingdom, Septimania. The last Visigothic king Ardo died in battle in 721 and N√Æmes was captured four years later. In the time of the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba in the 10th century, the northern border stabilized against the Frankish-ruled counties along the Llobregat and Cardener rivers and the Montsec Range. Lleida and Tortosa, the two main cities of the Muslim ruled area of today's Catalonia (historiographically known as \\"New Catalonia\\"), formed the centers of defense. Many of the predominantly Christian inhabitants of these Muslim border regions converted to Islam. Especially the inhabitants of the valleys of Ebro, Segre, and Cinca as well as the plain of Lleida took over the way of life and achievements of the Muslims like the highly developed irrigation techniques. The most important Muslim cities in Catalonia were Lleida, Balaguer and Tortosa. They developed an old town (Medina) in North African style with mosque, administrative headquarters and court. They also had large markets (Suq) with workshops and homes of artisans. In some cities there were open places of worship (MusallƒÅ) and ‚Äì as in Tortosa ‚Äì including a military fortress. Goods were exported via the port of Tortosa. Although there were peace treaties between the caliph in C√≥rdoba and some Catalan counts, the mutual attacks accumulated so, in 985 Almanzor, de facto ruler of the Caliphate, sacked Barcelona and captured thousands of its inhabitants.Roger Collins, Caliphs and Kings, 796-1031, (Blackwell Publishing, 2012), 191. = Carolingian conquest = Evolution of the Catalan counties between the 8th and the 12th centuries After repelling Muslim incursions as far north as Tours in 732, the expanding Frankish Empire set about creating a buffer zone of Christian counties in the south that became historiographically known as the Marca Hispanica or the Spanish March. The first county to be conquered from the Moors was Septimania which became Roussillon (with Vallespir), following the conquest of Narbonne (759).Hern√†ndez Cardona, Francesc Xavier. Hist√≤ria militar de Catalunya, vol. I, dels √≠bers als carolingis. 1a ed. Rafael Dalmau Editor, 2001, p.145. . Origins of the blason of the County of Barcelona, by Claudi LorenzaleIn 785 the County of Girona (with Besal√∫) on the south side of the Pyrenees was captured. Ribagor√ßa and Pallars were linked to Toulouse and were added to this county around 790. Urgell and Cerdanya were added in 798. The first records of the county of Emp√∫ries (with Perelada) are from 812, but the county was probably under Frankish control before 800. After a series of struggles, Charlemagne's son Louis took Barcelona from the Moorish emir in 801 and set up the County of Barcelona. The counts of the Marca Hispanica had small outlying territories, each ruled by a lesser miles with armed retainers, who owed allegiance through the Count to the Carolingian Emperor and later to the kings of West Francia. At the end of the 9th century, the Carolingian monarch Charles the Bald designated Wilfred the Hairy ‚Äî a noble descendant of a family from Conflent and son of the earlier Count of Barcelona Sunifred I ‚Äî as Count of Cerdanya and Urgell (870). After Charles's death (877), Wilfred became the Count of Barcelona and Girona (878) as well, bringing together the greater part of what was later to become Catalonia. On his death the counties were divided again among his sons, however, since then, the counties of Barcelona, Girona and Ausona (he repopulated the last one after a revolt) remained under the rule of the same person, becoming the core of the future Principality. Upon his death in 897 Wilfred, making their titles hereditaries founded the dynasty of the House of Barcelona, which ruled Catalonia until the death of Martin I, its last ruling member, in 1410. = The rise and fall of the aloers = Liber feudorum maior, compilation of documents related to the domains of the Counts of Barcelona and its vassals. Frontispiece During the 10th century, the counts became increasingly independent of the weakening Carolingians. This was publicly acknowledged in 988 when the Count of Barcelona Borrell II declined to swear fealty to Hugh Capet, the first Capetian monarch of the emerging French kingdom. Borell was motivated by Capet's failure to address Borrell's petitions to Capet for assistance against Muslim incursions. During this period, the population of the Catalan counties began to increase for the first time since the Muslim invasion. During the 9th and 10th centuries, the counties increasingly became a society of aloers, peasant proprietors of small, family-based farms, who lived by subsistence agriculture and owed no formal feudal allegiance.* Sadurn√≠ i Puigb√≤, N√∫ria. Diccionari de l'any 1000 a Catalunya. Edicions 62, Col¬∑lecci√≥ El Cangur / Diccionaris, n√∫m. 280. (Barcelona, 1999) p. 18 . The 11th century was characterized by the development of feudal society, as the miles formed links of vassalage over this previously independent peasantry. The middle years of the century were characterized by virulent class warfare. Seigniorial violence was unleashed against the peasants, utilizing new military tactics, based on contracting well-armed mercenary soldiers mounted on horses. By the end of the century, most of the aloers had been converted into vassals.Bisson, Thomas No√´l. Tormented voices. Power, crisis and humanity in rural Catalonia 1140‚Äì1200 (Harvard University Press, 1998) This coincided with a weakening of the power of the counts and the division of the Spanish Marches into more numerous counties, which gradually became a feudal state based on complex fealties and dependencies. During the regency of countess Ermesinde of Carcassonne the disintegration of central power was evident. From the time of the triumph of the grandson of Ermessinde, Ramon Berenguer I overlords and surrounding counts, the counts of Barcelona stood firmly as the link in a web of fealty between the counts and the Crown. Ramon Berenguer I began the codification of Catalan law in the written Usages of Barcelona which was to become the first full compilation of feudal law in Western Europe. Legal codification was part of the count's efforts to forward and somehow control the process of feudalization. The response of the Catholic Church to the feudal violence was the establishment of the sagreres around churches and the movement of Peace and Truce of God.Head, Thomas F.; Landes, Richard Allen (1992). The Peace of God: Social Violence and Religious Response in France Around the Year 1000. Cornell University Press. The first assembly of Peace and Truce was presided by Abbot Oliba in Toulouges, Roussillon in 1027. = First references to the name Catalonia = The term \\"Catalonia\\" is first documented in an early 12th-century Latin chronicle called the Liber maiolichinus, where Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona is referred to as catalanicus heroes, rector catalanicus, and dux catalanensis.Latin text of the Liber maiolichinus with Spanish introduction Some manuscripts suggest that Catalunya (Latin Gathia Launia) Gothia (or Gauthia), \\"Land of the Goths\\", since the origins of the Catalan counts, lords and people were found in the ancient March of Gothia, known as Gothia, whence Gothland > Gothlandia > Gothalania from which Catalonia has been theoretically derived. During the Middle Ages, Byzantine chroniclers claimed that Catalania derives from the local medley of Goths with Alans, initially constituting a Goth-Alania.The Sarmatians: 600 BC-AD 450 (Men-at-Arms) by Richard Brzezinski and Gerry Embleton, Aug 19, 2002. Alternatively, the name may come from the word \\"ca(s)telan\\" (inhabitant of the castle) as the area had many fortifications. Besides, the names Catalonie or Cathalania (Catalonia) and catalanenses (Catalans) are easily found referring to a geographical area and its inhabitants related to the people of the Languedoc.  Catalonia and Aragon (1100‚Äì1469)  = Dynastic union with Aragon = Petronilla of Aragon and Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona, dynastic union of the Crown of Aragon Until the middle of the 12th century, the successive counts of Barcelona tried to expand their domain in multiple directions. Ramon Berenguer III incorporated the County of Besal√∫, part of the County of Emp√∫ries, all of the County of Cerdanya, and also the County of Provence through his marriage to Douce of Provence. The Catalan church, for its part, became independent of the bishopric of Narbonne by restoring the archiepiscopal see of Tarragona (1118).History of the Archdiocese of Tarragona. The Middle Ages Archdiocese of Tarragona Official Website. In 1137 the Crown of Aragon was created by the marriage of Queen Petronilla of Aragon and Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona, after Ramiro II of Aragon ceded the potestas of his kingdom and his daughter Petronilla to Barcelona's Count,Bofarull, Pr√≥spero: Colecci√≥n de documentos in√©ditos de la Corona de Arag√≥n. Vol IV: Orden del mismo don Ramiro, para que en adelante todos los que hab√≠an sido sus vassallos obedeciesen al conde de Barcelona avoiding and protecting Aragon from a potential invasion and annexion by Castile. Ramon Berenguer IV used the title \\"comes Barchinonensis\\" (count of the Barcelonians) as his primary title and \\"princeps Aragonensis\\" (prince of the Aragonians) as his second title, beside his wife who retained her title of Regina (\\"queen\\"). Their son and heir, Alfonso II of Aragon consolidated the dynastic union as Rex Aragonum, Comes Barchinone et Marchio Provincie (\\"king of Aragon, count of Barcelona, and marquis of Provence\\").E. Bagu√©, J. Cabestany & P. Schramm, Els Primers Comtes- Reis, Vicens-Vives, 3rd. Edition, Barcelona, 1985, pp. 15‚Äì77. Catalonia and Aragon retained their distinct traditional rights, and Catalonia its own personality with one of the first parliaments in Europe, the Catalan Courts (Catalan: Corts Catalanes). In addition, the reign of Ramon Berenguer IV saw the Catalan conquest of Lleida and Tortosa, completing the unification of all of the territory that comprises modern Catalonia. This included a territory to the south of the historic Spanish Marches, which became known as Catalunya Nova (\\"New Catalonia\\") and which was repopulated with Catalans by the end of the 12th century. = Expansion and institutionalization of the Principality = James I of Aragon with the bishop of Barcelona Berenguer de Palou, Bernat de Centelles and Gilabert de Cru√Ølles during the conquest of Majorca (1229) Catalonia became the base for the Aragonese Crown's sea power, which came to dominate a maritime empire that extended across the western Mediterranean after the conquest of Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Sardinia, and the accession in Sicily of the kings of Aragon. This period saw a large increase of maritime trade in Catalan ports, particularly of the Aragonese Crown's leading city, Barcelona. At the end of the 12th century, a series of pacts between the crowns of Aragon and Castile delimited the zones that the two would each attempt to conquer from Muslim-ruled kingdoms, (the \\"Reconquista\\"); to the east, in 1213, the defeat and death of Peter II of Aragon (\\"Peter the Catholic\\") in the Battle of Muret put an end to the project of consolidating the Aragonese influence and power over Provence and the County of Toulouse.A Global Chronology of Conflict, Vol. I, ed. Spencer Tucker, (ABC-CLIO, 2010), 269. His successor James I of Aragon did not fully consolidate his power until 1227; once he consolidated his inherited realm, he began a series of new conquests. Over the course of the next quarter-century he conquered Majorca and Valencia.Mata, Jordi. Jaume I. Rei i Mite. S√†piens (Barcelona), num. 121, October 2012, pp. 8‚Äì14. ISSN 1695-2014. The latter became a new state, the third kingdom associated with the Crown of Aragon, with its own court and a new fuero (code of laws): the Furs de Valencia. In contrast, the Majorcan territory together with that of the counties of Cerdanya, Vallespir, Capcir and Roussillon and the city of Montpellier were left as a kingdom for his son James II of Majorca as the Kingdom of Majorca. This division began a period of struggle that ended with the annexation of that kingdom by the Crown of Aragon in 1344 by Peter IV \\"the Ceremonious\\". In 1258, James I and Louis IX of France signed the Treaty of Corbeil: the French king, as the heir of Charlemagne, renounced his claims of feudal overlordship over Catalonia, which it was effectively independent from French rule since the end of the 10th century, while James renounced his claims in Occitania. Miniature (15th century) of the Catalan Courts, presided over by Ferdinand II At the same time, the Principality of Catalonia developed a complex institutional and political system based on the concept of a pact between the estates of the realm and the king. Laws had to be approved in the General Court of Catalonia, one of the first parliamentary bodies of Europe that banned the royal power to create legislation unilaterally, since 1283. The Courts were composed of the three estates, were presided over by the king of Aragon, and approved the constitutions, which created a compilation of rights for the citizenship of the Principality. In order to collect general taxes, the Courts of 1359 established a permanent representation of deputies, called Deputation of the General (Catalan: Diputaci√≥ del General) and later usually known as Generalitat, which gained an important political power in the next centuries.History of the Generalitat gencat.cat The Crown of Aragon (15th century) Coll de Panissars during the Aragonese Crusade The Principality of Catalonia saw a prosperous period during the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th. The population increased; Catalan culture expanded into the islands of the Western Mediterranean. The reign of Peter III of Aragon (\\"the Great\\") included the conquest of Sicily and the successful defense against a French crusade; his son and successor Alfonso (\\"the Generous\\") conquered Menorca; and Peter's second son James II, who first acceded to the throne of Sicily and then succeeded his older brother as king of Aragon, conquered Sardinia; under James II, and Catalonia was the center of the flourishing empire. Barcelona, then the most frequent royal residence, was consolidated as the administrative center of the domains with the establishment of the Royal Archives in 1318. The Catalan Company, mercenaries led by Roger de Flor and formed by Almogavar veterans of the War of the Sicilian Vespers, were hired by the Byzantine Empire to fought the Turks, defeating them in several battles. After the assassination of Roger de Flor by orders of the emperor's son Michael Palaiologos (1305),Burns, R. Ignatius (1954). \\"The Catalan Company and the European Powers, 1305-1311\\". Speculum.

Catalan rule over the Greek lands lasted until 1390. The Crown became the protector of the united Albanian principalities after the Treaty of Gaeta. This territorial expansion was accompanied by a great development of the Catalan trade, centered in Barcelona, creating an extensive trade network across the Mediterranean which competed with those of the maritime republics of Genoa and Venice. In this line, institutions were created that would give legal protection to merchants, such as the Consulate of the Sea and the Book of the Consulate of the Sea, one of the first compilations of maritime law.History of maritime law www.historyoflaw.info The trade allowed the formation of banking, while at the beginning of the 15th century the response of the local authorities of Barcelona to the crisis was to create the first public bank of Europe, the Taula de Canvi, in 1401.Thomas Henry Dyer The history of modern Europe: from the fall of Constantinople in 1453 to the war in the Crimea in 1857, Volume 2 John Murray, 1861 Retrieved 2012-05-14La Vanguardia - El Banco de Barcelona financia el segundo viaje de Col√≥n The second quarter of the 14th century saw crucial changes for Catalonia, marked by a succession of natural catastrophes, demographic crises, stagnation and decline in the Catalan economy, and the rise of social tensions. In 1333, known as Lo mal any primer (\\"The first bad year\\"), a severe famine affected the lands of the Crown. Between 1347 and 1497 the Principality of Catalonia lost 37 percent of its population.According to John Huxtable Elliott, \\"Between 1347 and 1497 the Principality [Catalonia] had lost 37% of its inhabitants, and was reduced to a population of something like 300,000.\\" The reign of Peter the Ceremonious was a time of war: the annexation of Majorca, the quelling of a rebellion in Sardinia, a rebellion by an Aragonese faction who wished to extinguish local Catalan privileges in favor of a more centralized kingdom of Aragon, and an Aragonese-Castilian war. These wars created a delicate financial situation, in a framework of demographic and economic crisis, to which was added a generation later a crisis of succession generated by the death in 1410 of Martin I without a descendant or a named successor. A two-year interregnum progressively evolved in favor of a candidate from the Castilian Trast√°mara dynasty, Ferdinand of Antequera, who after the Compromise of Caspe (1412), was named Ferdinand I of Aragon. =The 15th century= Masia of Heretat de Gu√†rdia (La Baronia de Rialb). After the Sentencia of Guadalupe, the masies ruled by emphyeutic system became one the basis of prosperity in Catalan countryside Ferdinand's successor, Alfonso V (\\"the Magnanimous\\"), promoted a new stage of Aragonese expansion, this time over the Kingdom of Naples, over which he finally gained dominion in 1443. At the same time, though, he aggravated the social crisis in the Principality of Catalonia, both in the countryside and in the cities. Alfonso's brother, John II (\\"the Unreliable\\"), was an exceptionally deeply hated and opposed regent and ruler - both in the Basque kingdom of Navarre and in Catalonia. The outcome of these conflicts was the 1462 \\"remen√ßa\\" (serfs') rebellion, a peasant rebellion against seignorial pressures, which led to a ten-year civil war that left the country exhausted. In 1472, the last separate ruler of Catalonia, the king Ren√© of Anjou (\\"the Good\\"), lost the war against King John. The remen√ßa conflict did not reach any definitive conclusion and in 1493 France returned the counties of Roussillon and Cerdagne, which it had occupied during the conflict. Ferdinand II of Aragon (\\"the Catholic\\") profoundly reformed Catalan institutions, recovered without war the northern Catalan counties, increased active involvement in Italy and finally resolved the major grievances of the remences with the Sentencia Arbitral de Guadalupe in 1486, in exchange for a payment. The Sentencia allowed the beginning of the right to freely contract emphyteutic agreements, which led to general prosperity in the Catalan countryside throughout the next centuries. In 1481, the Catalan Courts approved the Constituci√≥ de l'Observan√ßa, which established the submission of royal power to the laws of the Principality of Catalonia.Ferro, V√≠ctor: El Dret P√∫blic Catal√†.

Early modern period (1469‚Äì1808) = Crown of Aragon union with Crown of Castile = Ferdinand's 1469 marriage to Isabella I of Castile brought about a dynastic union of the Crown of Aragon with Castile. After the 1512 invasion of the Kingdom of Navarre, in 1516 the monarchies were formally united into a single Monarchy of Spain (\\"Kingdom of the Spains\\", as it was sometimes known). Each kingdom of the Monarchy conserved its political institutions and maintained its own courts, laws, public administration, and separate coinage of money. Charles V's European territories. The Principality of Catalonia was included in the domains of the Crown of Aragon (in red) When Christopher Columbus made his discovery in The Americas during a Spanish-sponsored expedition, and began to shift Europe's trade and economic centre of gravity (and the focus of Spain's ambitions) from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean, undermining Catalonia's economic and political importance. Aragonese and Catalan power in the Mediterranean would continue, but efforts to achieve further Spanish conquests in Europe itself largely stopped and the maritime expansion into the Atlantic and the conquest of territories in the Americas was not a Catalan enterprise. Castile and the realms of Aragon were separate states until 1716 in spite of a shared crown and the newly established colonies in the Americas and Pacific were Castilian, administered as appendages of Castile, until in 1778 Seville was the only port authorized to trade in America, Book online and despite the dynastic union Catalans, as subjects of the Crown of Aragon, had no right to trade directly with the Castilian-ruled Americas. By virtue of descent from his maternal grandparents, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, in 1516 Charles I of Spain became the first king to rule the Crowns of Castile and Aragon simultaneously by his own right. Following the death of his paternal (House of Habsburg) grandfather, Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, he was also elected Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1519. In the 16th century, the Catalan population began a demographic recovery and some measure of economic recovering. The reign of Charles V was a relative harmonious period, during which Catalonia generally accepted the new structure of Spain, despite its own marginalization. As the focus of Spanish maritime power and of European rivalry shifted to the Atlantic, the Kingdom of Valencia became the most important kingdom of the Aragonese Crown, eclipsing Barcelona. The reign of Philip II marked the beginning of a gradual process of stagnation of Catalan economy, language, and culture. Among the most negative elements of the period were a rise in piracy along the coasts and banditry in the interior.Mestre, 1998. p. 92 = The Reapers' War = The Reapers' War \\"Corpus of Blood\\" (1640). Painted in 1910 Pau Claris, President of the Generalitat during the Reaper's War The Reapers' War (, 1640‚Äì52) started as an uprising of peasants in Barcelona. Conflicts had already arisen between Catalonia and the monarchy in the time of Philip II. Having exhausted the economic resources of Castile, Philip wished to avail himself of those of Catalonia; the Catalan governmental institutions and laws were well protected by the terms of union of the kingdoms, and were jealously guarded by the Catalan population, who during those times increased its participation in the local and general government of the Principality. After Philip IV acceded to the throne in 1621, the Count-Duke of Olivares attempted to sustain an ambitious foreign policy by taxing the kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula and establishing a military contribution to the Empire in each one of them (the Uni√≥n de Armas, \\"Union of Arms\\"),J.H. Elliott, The Count-Duke Olivares: The Statesman in an Age of Decline. New Haven: Yale University Press 1966, pp. 244‚Äì77. which meant laying aside the until-then-prevailing principles of the composite monarchy, in favor of an increased centralization. Resistance in Catalonia was especially strong, given the lack of any significant apparent regional return for the sacrifices. The Catalan Courts of 1626 and 1632 were never concluded, due to the opposition of the estates against the economical and military measures of Olivares, many of which violated the Catalan constitutions. The failure of the Courts aggravated the tensions between Catalan institutions and Monarchy, favoring a scenario of rupture. When Spanish tercios (military corps) concentrated in Roussillon at the end of the 1630s, because of the Thirty Years' War with France, the local peasants were required to lodge and provision the troops, creating a large tension and discomfort, and reporting events such as religious sacrileges, destruction of personal properties and rape of women by the soldiers. On 7 June 1640 an uprising in Barcelona known as the Corpus de Sang, led by reapers, took the lives of various royal functionaries, not all of them Castilian; Dalmau de Queralt, Count of Santa Coloma and viceroy of Catalonia was assassinated during the events. Mutinies continued; few weeks later Pau Claris, president of the Generalitat of Catalonia, called the politician members from all the Principality in order to form a Junta de Bra√ßos or Bra√ßos Generals (States-General), a consultive body similar to the Courts. Partition of Catalonia (1659) The calling was a success, and the presence of cities and feudal villages was exceptionally large. This assembly worked with individual voting and began to create and apply various revolutionary measures, such as the establishment of a Council of Defense of the Principality, a special tax for the nobility (the Batall√≥) L'impost del Batall√≥ and maintained contacts with the Kingdom of France, while the rupture with the Spanish Monarchy was evident and the military clashes began. With the Spanish troops approaching Barcelona, on 17 January 1641 the States-General declared the Catalan Republic under the protection of France, but a week later the Catalan institutions, needing more French military aid, accepted King Louis XIII of France as Count of Barcelona.Gelderen, Martin van; Skinner, Quentin (2002). Republicanism: Volume 1, Republicanism and Constitutionalism in Early Modern Europe: A Shared European Heritage. Cambridge University Press. p. 284. This allowed the French army to cross the Pyrenees into the Iberian peninsula during the long Franco-Spanish War, defeating together the Spanish army at the battle of Montju√Øc, close to Barcelona, on 26 January 1641. The French general Philippe de La Mothe- Houdancourt was appointed viceroy of Catalonia, and the Franco-Catalan forces obtained victories in Montmel√≥ and Lleida. However, the French administration increased its control over the Principality, and the same conflicts between peasants and soldiers (but this time French) erupted. After major setbacks, from 1644 Spanish forces had driven out the French and crushed the Catalan forces, and by 1652 Barcelona and most of Catalonia was once under control of the Monarchy of Spain, but Catalonia gained recognition of its rights from the Spanish Habsburg monarchy, with few exceptions. When the war between Spain and France ended in 1659, the peace treaty ceded the Catalan-speaking territories north of the Pyrenees, Roussillon, Conflent, Vallespir, Capcir, and the northern half of Cerdanya, to France. = War of the Spanish Succession = Catalan Constitutions (1702) Fall of Barcelona, 11 September 1714 In the last decades of the 17th century during the reign of Spain's last Habsburg king, Charles II, despite intermittent conflict between Spain and France, the population increased to approximately 500,000 inhabitantsSimon i Tarr√©s, Antoni. La poblaci√≥ catalana a l'epoca moderna. S√≠ntesi i actualitzaci√≥. Barcelona, 1992 pp. 217‚Äì258 (in Catalan) and the Catalan economy recovered, not only in Barcelona, but also along the Catalan coast and even in some inland areas. This economic growth was boosted by the export of wine to England and the Dutch Republic. However, due to the trade war of French minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert against the Dutch and later to the participation of these countries in the Nine Years' War against France, the Catalans were not able to trade with the French. This new situation caused many Catalans to look to England and, especially, the Netherlands as political and economic models for Catalonia. However, at the end of the century, after the death of the childless Charles II (1700), the Crown of Spain went to his chosen successor, Philip V of the House of Bourbon. The Grand Alliance of Austria, England and the United Provinces gave military support to a Habsburg claimant of the crown, Archduke Charles as Charles III of Spain. Catalonia initially accepted Philip V following prolonged negotiations between Philip V and the Catalan Courts between 12 October 1701 and 14 January 1702, which resulted in an agreement where the Principality of Catalonia retained all its previous privileges and gained a Court of Contraventions (Tribunal de Contrafaccions), the status of free port (Port Franc) for Barcelona as well as the limited right to commerce with America, but this did not last. In 1705 the Archduke entered Barcelona, which recognized him as King in 1706; thus breaking an oath of loyalty to the Bourbon claiment, which had negative repercussions for Catalonia when Philip V eventually lost the war - he ceded Belgium and Southern Italy to the Austrians - but retained the Catalan territory. The resulting Spanish War of Succession (1701‚Äì14) may have benefitted Charles's foreign allies but was a disaster for the Catalans, Valencians and Aragonese. The Treaty of Utrecht (1713) ended the possibility of Catalonia's resistance to Bourbon rule, which its capital, Barcelona, surrendered on 11 September 1714. The Bourbon king, determined to punish what he saw as sedition from Catalonia, Valencia and Aragon, established the Nueva Planta decrees (1716),Mercader, J. Felip V i Catalunya. (Barcelona, 1968) abolishing the Catalan, Valencian and Aragonese institutions and rights, and with it the Catalan Courts, the Generalitat, the Council of One Hundred of Barcelona and the Catalan constitutions, except the civil law, replacing them with the Castilian ones and establishing absolutism as the new form of government. In order to ensure it, he created a new Royal Audience as seat of government of the province and replaced the traditional vegueries with corregimientos as the territorial division of Catalonia. He suppressed the Catalan universities (the University of Barcelona moved to Cervera) and abolished the administrative use of the Catalan language; half a century later, under the reign of Charles III of Bourbon, the Catalan language would also be banned from primary and secondary schools.Francisco A.

The population and the economy both grew, agricultural production increased, and trade increased, complemented during the last quarter of the century with the opening of trade with America; all of these transformations tended, as in France, to undermine the Old Regime and lay the groundwork for the rise of industrialization, the first signs of which appeared in the 18th-century manufacture of cotton goods and other textiles. By the end of the 18th century, the popular classes began to experience the first effects of proletarianization.https://e-archivo.uc3m.es/bitstream/handle/10016/11165/subcontracting_roses_EHR_2009.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y In the 1790s, new conflicts arose on the French border, due to the French Revolution and the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1793, after the execution of Louis XVI of France, Spain signed with Great Britain his adhesion to the First Coalition against the French Republic, and soon after, France declared war on Spain. The War of the Pyrenees, known in Catalonia as the Guerra Gran (\\"Great War\\") has two main fronts: the eastern and the western Pyrenees. At first, the Spanish army entered in the Roussillon, reaching Perpignan, but the French army reacted and defeated them in Le Boulou and Colliure, penetrating in Catalonia and occupied the Empord√†. The Sant Ferran Castle in Figueres (the largest fortress of the border) fell to the French after a brief siege. In 1795, after the stagnation of the front, France and Spain signed the Peace of Basel, restoring the status quo.Gim√©nez L√≥pez, Enrique (1996). El fin del Antiguo R√©gimen. pp. 58‚Äì60  Modern period (1808‚Äì1939)  = Napoleonic Wars = Third Siege of Girona (1809), Peninsular War In 1808, during the Napoleonic Wars, Catalonia was occupied by the troops of General Guillaume Philibert Duhesme. The official Spanish army had evaporated, but popular resistance against the French occupation occurred in Catalonia as in other parts of Spain, and eventually developed into the Peninsular War. A local army defeated the French in a series of battles at El Bruc, near Barcelona. Meanwhile, Girona was besieged by the French and defended by its inhabitants under the direction of general and military governor Mariano √Ålvarez de Castro.Griffin, Julia Ortiz; Griffin, William D. (2007). Spain and Portugal: A Reference Guide From The Renaissance To The Present. p. 204. Under the military governor Mariano √Ålvarez de Castro the resistance was carried on by regular troops, including a large contingent of Spain's Irish Brigade, and civilian volunteers, among whom women grouped in the Company of St. Barbara... The French finally took the city on 10 December 1809, after many deaths on both sides from hunger, epidemics, and cold; √Ålvarez de Castro died in prison one month later. The rejection to French dominion was institutionalized with the creation of \\"juntas\\" (councils) across Spain who, remaining loyal to the Bourbons, exercised the sovereignty and representation of the territory due to the disappearance of the old institutions, and sending delegates to the Cortes of C√°diz. In Catalonia, the juntas of Catalan corregimientos established in Lleida the Superior Junta of the Government of the Principality of Catalonia which it declared itself as depositary of the faculties of the Royal Audience of Catalonia, as well as the legislative power. At the same time, Napoleon took direct control of Catalonia to establish order, creating the Government of Catalonia under the rule of Marshall Augereau, and making Catalan briefly an official language again.Moreno Cullell, Vicente: La Guerra del Franc√®s: la Catalunya napole√≤nica Between 1812 and 1813, Catalonia was directly annexed to France itself, and organized an ordinary civil administration in the form of four (later two) d√©partements: Bouches-de-l'√àbre (prefecture: Lleida), Montserrat (Barcelona), S√®gre (Puigcerd√†), and Ter (Girona).Les modifications int√©rieures de la France French dominion in parts of Catalonia lasted until 1814, when the British General Wellington signed the armistice by which the French left Barcelona and the other strongholds that they had managed to keep until the last. = The Carlist wars and the liberal state = The reign of Ferdinand VII (reigned 1808‚Äì33) saw several Catalan uprisings and after his death, the conflict over the succession between the absolutist \\"Carlist\\" partisans of Infante Carlos and the liberal partisans of Isabella II led to the First Carlist War, which lasted until 1840 and was especially virulent in the Catalan territory. Catalonia was divided. The most industrialized areas support liberalism and the Catalan bourgeoisie tries to contribute to the construction of the new liberal state. As with the Basques, many Catalans fought on the Carlist side, not necessarily because they supported absolute monarchy, but because some of them hoped that restoration of the Old Regime would mean restoration of their fueros and recovery of regional autonomy. Catalan uprising of 1842 Proclamation of the First Spanish Republic in Barcelona, 1873 The victory of the liberals over the absolutists led to a \\"bourgeois revolution\\" during the reign of Isabella II. In 1834, by decree of minister Javier de Burgos, Spain was organized into provinces, included Catalonia, which was divided in four provinces (Barcelona, Girona, Lleida and Tarragona) without a common administration. The reign of Isabella II was marked by corruption, administrative inefficiency, centralism, and political and social tensions. The liberals soon divided into \\"moderates\\" and \\"progressives\\", and in Catalonia a republican current began to develop; also, inevitably, Catalans generally favored a more federal Spain. During the second third of the century, there were various progressive uprisings in Barcelona and other places, known as bullangues. The last insurrection of the period, the Jam√†ncia (1843), which tried to expel the government of General Espartero and proposed a progressive program and postulates close to federalism, ended with Barcelona blocked and bombed by the army, representing the triumph of the moderates and its centralist politics.Enciclop√®dia.cat Jam√†ncia The Second Carlist War (1846‚Äì1849) took place fundamentally in Catalonia, largely promoted by the displeasure of large sectors of the population with the moderate model of the liberal state that was being established at that time. This explains the collaboration of the progressives and republicans with the Carlists in 1848, coinciding with the democratic revolutions in France and the rest of Europe.Noticias de Cabrera (L'Union. Diari de Paris 18 de novembre de 1848. n√∫m. 323 p. 2) When General O'Donnell, leader of the Liberal Union, was appointed as Prime Minister in 1856 seems that the relationship between Catalan society and the Spanish government became more hopeful. Surprisingly, the reaction in Catalonia to the Hispano-Moroccan War was enthusiastic, and it was organized a company of Catalan volunteers that were received in Africa by the General Joan Prim, born in Reus. The fall of the government of the Liberal Union without being able to accomplish the expected reforms and the return of the moderates to power ended the hopes of Catalan society. In September 1868, Spain's continuing economic crisis triggered the September Revolution or La Gloriosa, resulting in the deposition of Isabella II and beginning the so- called Sexenio Democr√°tico, the \\"six democratic years\\" (1868‚Äì1874). As usual, popular revolts and juntas were formed across the country, until the new government ordered its dissolution. General Joan Prim was appointed Prime Minister of the Provisional Government (1869‚Äì1870), his government called to a parliamentary election by universal manhood suffrage for the first time in order to establish the political future of Spain. In Catalonia, federalists republicans won the overall majority of seats, while the general results in Spain gave a victory to a progressive monarchist coalition. Spain was declared a democratic monarchy and Amadeo of Savoy elected new king. Few days before the arrival of Amadeo, Prim was assassinated. Meanwhile, the federalists republicans of Catalonia, Aragon, Valencia and Balearic Islands signed the Federal Pact of Tortosa (1869)Federalismo y cuesti√≥n federal en Espa√±a, Manuel Chust Calero, p100 and there was a federalist revolt at the same year.Sobre els al√ßaments federals del 1869. raco.cat The rise of Amadeo I to the throne of Spain (1870‚Äì1873) proved unstable, his reign saw the outbreak of the Third Carlist War (1872‚Äì1876), Cuba's fight for independence, the spread of the ideas of the First International and economic troubles, ending with the resignation of the king.Bahamonde, √Ångel (1996). Espa√±a en democracia. El Sexenio, 1868-1874. Madrid: Historia 16-Temas de Hoy, pp. 72‚Äì73, This decision allowed the proclamation of the First Spanish Republic (1873‚Äì1874). The Republic fought against the inherited problems and with others like the cantonal insurrection. During its short existence it was unable to establish a federal republic and it had four presidents. Its first presidents, Estanislau Figueras and Francesc Pi i Margall, were Catalans. Along the period there were attempts from radical federalists to proclaim a federated Catalan State. After the fall of president Emilio Castelar, the General Pavia made a coup d'√©tat, disbanding the Cortes and appointed General Serrano as president without parliamentary control.Mart√≠ Gilabert, Francisco. Primera Rep√∫blica Espa√±ola 1873-1874. Ediciones Rialp, 2007. In Google Books. = Industrialization, Renaixen√ßa and Modernisme = Col√≤nia Sed√≥, Company Town Since the 1830s, boosted by the conditions of proto-industrialization of the prior two centuries of the Catalan urban areas and its countryside, Catalonia became a centre of Spain's industrialization and it became one of the largest textile producers in the Mediterranean. In 1832 it was inaugurated in Barcelona the factory Bonaplata, the first of the country which worked with steam engine. Catalonia had to contend with a grave shortage of energy resources and the weakness of the domestic Spanish market. To encourage industrial expansion, Spain established protectionist policies which reduced foreign competition domestically (although the policy of Spanish government during those times changed many times between free trade and protectionism). Catalonia saw the first railway construction in the Iberian Peninsula in 1848, linking Barcelona with Matar√≥, built with private capital. These initiatives partially benefitted the country's industrial regions, Catalonia, the Basque Country and later Asturias. As in much of Europe, the working class was molded into an industrial proletariat, living and working in often inhuman conditions. As a response to the lack of energy resources, a large number of factories were installed on the margins of the rivers when the use of the water turbine widespread. Usually, the factories included a Company town; Catalonia has a high density of this kind of settlements, known locally as industrial colonies (col√≤nies industrials). They are especially concentrated in river basins along the Ter and Llobregat. In the comarca of Bergued√†, for example, within 20 km there are 14 colonies. These were small towns created around a factory, built in a rural area and, therefore, separate from any other population. They housed between 100 and 500 inhabitants, and in some cases around 1000 people. These industrial colonies were a typical aspect of industrialization in Catalonia, specifically the second industrialization, which resulted in certain areas that were once purely rural becoming industrial. They were first created in the second half of the nineteenth century, especially from the 1870s onwards. The last colonies were created in the early years of the twentieth century. There are more than 75 textile colonies recorded; although there were also mining, metallurgy and agricultural colonies. The second third of the 19th century saw a Catalan cultural renaissance (Renaixen√ßa), a cultural movement to recover Catalan language and culture after a long period of decay. As with most of the other Romantic movements, it was noted for its admiration of the Middle Ages, which was often reflected in art and, in Barcelona, the literary contest known as Floral Games (Jocs Florals) was revived. The historical research of Antoni de Capmany, the interest in normalizing the Catalan language and the emergence of an incipient intellectuality interested in popular culture are already produced during the Enlightenment. Josep Pau Ballot wrote \\"Gramatica y apolog√≠a de la llengua cathalana\\" between 1810 and 1813, during the French occupation. This work is realized with patriotic intention and disseminator of the use of Catalan. Between 1833 and the reestablishment of the Floral Games in 1859, the Catalan language lives in a situation of disglossy: many authors of the Renaixen√ßa wrote some literature and poetry in Catalan, but they will continue to use Spanish in their main works. However, the popular classes continued to use Catalan, and during this period popular theater in Catalan became relevant, unlike the representations of the Liceu addressed to the bourgeoisie, which used Spanish. = Catalan nationalism and the workers movement = Valent√≠ Almirall Tragic Week, 1909 In 1874, a coup by General Mart√≠nez Campos in Sagunto led to a restoration of the Bourbon dynasty in the person of Alfonso XII. A period of political stability, of repression of the workers movement, and of a slow growth in Catalan nationalist identity extended to the early years of the 20th century, when once again political opposition broke to the fore, especially republicanism and Catalan nationalism, but also class-based politics reflecting social tensions. The following decades saw the rise of the political Catalanism still prevalent today: the first formulations of the modern Catalan national identity can be seen in Valent√≠ Almirall, a relevant federalist republican. Almirall, despite being a left-wing republican, tried to unite the Catalan left and right, but he did not succeed because there were too many divergences between the two currents. He promoted the First Catalanist Congress, held in 1880, in which the different Catalanist groups were united: federal republicanism and the apolitical current, the literary one, from La Renaixen√ßa magazine, but the leftist tendencies of Almirall caused that the group of the Renaixen√ßa left the Congress and broke the agreement. However, the Congress took three fundamental agreements: creating an entity that brings together Catalanism (the Centre Catal√†, \\"Catalan Center\\"), the beginning of efforts to establish the Academy of the Catalan Language, and the drafting of a document on defense of Catalan as official language.De la Granja, Jos√© Luis; Beramendi, Justo; Anguera, Pere (2001). La Espa√±a de los nacionalismos y las autonom√≠as. pp. 62‚Äì64, Madrid: S√≠ntesis. The crisis of the Centre Catal√† was shown due the differences around the position about the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition. The opposite positions led to the dissolution of the group, and the left-wing Catalan nationalism was seriously weakened for decades. The conservative elements of Catalan nationalism founded the League of Catalonia in 1887 who, in 1891, were united with the group La Renaixen√ßa, creating the Uni√≥ Catalanista (Catalanist Union). The Uni√≥ redacted, in 1892, the Basis of Catalan regional autonomy, also known as Basis of Manresa, a program that demanded a specific autonomy for Catalonia. In 1901 Enric Prat de la Riba and Francesc Camb√≥ formed the Regionalist League (Lliga Regionalista), which in 1906 led the successful electoral coalition Solidaritat Catalana, created by diverse Catalan political groups (from conservative to Catalan left-wing nationalists and from republicanism to carlism) as a response to Cu-Cut! affair, in which officers of the Spanish Army, angry with this satirical magazine for publish an offending joke about the war in Morocco, stormed the Cu-Cut! offices, and the subsequent \\"Ley de Jurisdicciones\\", that punish the \\"crimes\\" and \\"insults\\" against the army and the symbols of the nation, putting them under military trials.Mata, Jordi. ¬´Solidaritat Catalana: la gran il¬∑lusi√≥¬ª.

Diari Ara. 18 December 2013 In 1919 the Commonwealth promoted the first project of Statute of Autonomy, but the disagreements with the government of Madrid, the opposition of sectors of Spanish society and the coincidence with the rise of the workers movement provoked the fall of the project.Camb√≥, Francesc (1991). Obres de Francesc Camb√≥. Editorial Alpha, p. 599 Estelada, flag used by Estat Catal√† and the most visible symbol of Catalan independentism, even today The Catalan workers movement at the turn of the twentieth century consisted of three tendencies: syndicalism, socialism, and anarchism, part of the last openly embracing \\"propaganda of the deed\\" as advocated by Alejandro Lerroux. Along with Asturias, Catalonia in general and Barcelona in particular was a center of radical labor agitation, marked by numerous general strikes, assassinations (especially in the late 1910s), and the rise of the anarchism Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour, CNT, founded in Barcelona in 1910).Que es CNT CNT website Growing resentment of conscription and of the military culminated in the Tragic Week in Barcelona in 1909, resulting in the deaths of over 100 citizens. The anarchists had been active throughout the early 20th century, achieving, after a successful strike which paralyzed much of the industry of Catalonia, the first eight-hour workday of Western Europe in 1919. The escalating violence between Catalan workers and the Catalan bourgeoisie (Pistolerismo) led the latter to embrace the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, despite his centralizing tendencies. (See also Anarchism in Spain).Ben-Ami, Shlomo (2012). El cirujano de hierro. La dictadura de Primo de Rivera (1923-1930). Barcelona: RBA, p. 45 The initial acceptance of the Dictatorship by the conservative League made the Catalan nationalism progressively more leftist (with the rise of parties as Acci√≥ Catalana, Catalan Republican Party or the Socialist Union of Catalonia) and, some of them, also pro-independence (Estat Catal√†). Despite this tolerance, Primo de Rivera abolished the Commonwealth of Catalonia in 1925 and started a policy of repression against the Catalan nationalism, Catalan language and labour movement (especially anarchism and communism). In 1926, Estat Catal√† tried to liberate Catalonia with a little army (established in the town of Prats de Moll√≥ in Roussillon, France), led by Francesc Maci√†, and proclaim the independent Catalan Republic, but the complot was discovered by the French police. Maci√† and the Catalan issue gained popularity all over the world.Jordi Finestres and Giovanni Cattini (2009). Qui va trair Maci√†? S√†piens, vol. 84 During the last steps of the Dictatorship, Barcelona celebrated the 1929 International Exposition, while Spain started to suffer an economical crisis caused by the economical policy of the government and the Wall Street Crash. = Republic and autonomy = Proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic on 14 April 1931 in Barcelona After the fall of Primo de Rivera, the Catalan left made great efforts to create a united front under the leadership of left-wing independentist leader Francesc Maci√†, founder of Estat Catal√†. The Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (Republican Left of Catalonia, or ERC) represented a break with the electoral abstentionism that, until then had been characteristic of the Catalan workers. Advocating moderate socialism, republicanism and Catalan self-determination, the party achieved a spectacular victory in the municipal elections of 12 April 1931, which preceded the 14 April proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic. After a brief proclamation of the Catalan Republic (14‚Äì17 April) by the ERC leader, Francesc Maci√†,Roglan, Joaquim (2006). 14 d'abril: la Catalunya republicana (1931-1939). Cosset√†nia Edicions, p. 13 the Generalitat of Catalonia was revived as an autonomous government, and a Statute of Autonomy for Catalonia was approved on 9 September 1932 by the Cortes of the Republic after many discussions and political difficulties that considerably amended the original project. The Statute gave a strong, though not absolute, grant of self-government, and declared Catalan as official language in Catalonia alongside Spanish.Abell√≥ G√ºell, Teresa: El debat estatutari del 1932 Parliament of Catalonia A similar statute granted autonomy to the Basque Country, few years later. The Parliament of Catalonia was elected on 20 November 1932, and ERC won a large majority of seats, while the Regionalist League, almost hegemonic during the Monarchy, came in second place but far behind ERC.* 1932 Parliament of Catalonia election in Historia Electoral Under its two presidents, Francesc Maci√† (1931‚Äì1933) and Llu√≠s Companys (1934‚Äì1939), the Republican Generalitat, democratically led by the left, carried out a considerable task in different areas such as culture, health, education and civil law, despite the serious economic crisis that the Republic inherited, its social repercussions, the low fiscal autonomy granted by the Statute, and the political vicissitudes of the period. On December 25, 1933 Maci√† died and the Parliament appointed Companys as new president. Under his presidency, the Parliament continued to legislate in order to improve the living conditions of the popular classes and the petite bourgeoisie, approving laws like the Crop Contracts Law, which protected the tenant farmers and granted access to the land they were cultivating, but it was contested by the Regionalist League and provoking a legal dispute with the Spanish government led by Ricardo Samper, rising the tensions. Meanwhile, the Generalitat established its own Court of Appeal (Catalan: Tribunal de Cassaci√≥)Roca i Trias, Encarna. El tribunal de Cassaci√≥ de la Generalitat republicana: La hist√≤ria d'una tradici√≥ prohibida, 2009, 18 pages from a conference and assumed executive powers in public order. The Statute was suspended in 1934, due to an uprising in Barcelona on 6 October of that year. President Companys proclaimed the Catalan State of the Spanish Federal Republic, as a response to the accession of right-wing Spanish nationalist party CEDA to the government of the Republic. The CEDA was considered close to fascism and, therefore, they feared that it was the first step of this party to suppress the autonomy and take the power in Spain as Hitler and Dollfuss made in Germany and Austria. The proclamation was quickly suppressed by the Spanish army, and the Catalan Government members were arrested. As for the workers' movement, there was a crisis in the CNT (the greatest trade union in Catalonia at the time) with the break-away faction in the 1930s and its hostility against the Republic as a bourgeoisie regime growth, realizing demonstrations, general strikes and proclamations of the libertarian communism in some places like in the Alt Llobregat mining area in 1932, while the Marxist parties were progressively unified with the formation of the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (, POUM) in September 1935 and Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (Catalan: Partit Socialista Unificat de Catalunya, PSUC) in July 1936.History psuc.cat After the electoral victory of the left in the Spanish general election of February 1936 the government of the Generalitat was pardoned and reinstated in their functions. The period between that event and the military rebellion of July 1936 is considered as relatively peaceful in Catalonia, in contrast with the rest of Spain. The Parliament restored their legislative activities and the government prepared the People's Olympiad in Barcelona, as a response against the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin, which was then under control of Nazi Germany, but the same day of its planned inauguration (19 July), the Spanish Army carried out a partially failed coup d'√©tat which led to the Spanish Civil War. = Civil War = Francoist offensives during the occupation of Catalonia The defeat of the initial military rebellion against the Republican government in Barcelona by forces of the Generalitat and workers' militias placed Catalonia firmly in the Republican camp. The loyalist victory allowed to the workers' self-armed militias, predominantly anarchists, to become the real power of the streets, which meant the beginning of a harsh repression in Catalonia against those elements of being \\"fascist\\" or right-wing simpatizers. Both the Generalitat and the central government were unable to stop the arbitrary revolutionary violence. During the war, there were two powers coexisting in Catalonia: the de jure power of the Generalitat and the de facto power of the armed popular militias. In order to begin the recovering of some control of the situation, Companys authorized on July 21 the establishment of a joint body by the different Catalan republican parties and the anarchist CNT and socialist UGT trade unions, The Central Committee of Antifascist Militias of Catalonia (CCMA), becoming the effective Catalan government until its dissolution, two months later, replaced by a new government of the Generalitat which included anarchist ministers. Throughout Catalonia many sectors of the economy fell under the control of the CNT and the UGT, where workers' self-management was implemented. These included any kind of industry and services and thousands of dwellings previously owned by the upper classes. Initially, the newly collectivized factories encountered various problems. In response to these problems, the Generalitat, backed by the CNT approved a decree on \\"Collectivization and Workers' Control\\" on 24 October 1936. Under this decree all firms with more than 100 workers were to be collectivized and those with 100 or less could be collectivized if a majority of workers agreed. Violent confrontations between the workers' parties culminated in the defeat of the CNT-FAI and POUM in the 1937 May Days, against whom the PSUC unleashed strong repression. The local situation resolved itself progressively in favor of the Generalitat, but at the same time the Generalitat partially lost its autonomous power within republican Spain. The military forces of the Generalitat, weakly structured between December 1936 and May 1937 in the People's Army of Catalonia (Ex√®rcit Popular de Catalunya), were concentrated on two fronts: Aragon and Majorca. The latter was an utter disaster. The Aragon front resisted firmly until 1938, when the occupation of Lleida and Balaguer destabilized it. Finally, Franco's troops broke the republican territory in two by occupying Vinar√≤s, isolating Catalonia from the rest of republican Spain. The defeat of the Republican armies in the Battle of the Ebro led in 1938 and 1939 to the occupation of Catalonia by Franco's forces, who abolished completely the Catalan self-government and brought in a dictatorial regime, which took strong measures against Catalan nationalism and culture. Only forty years later, after Franco's death (1975) and the adoption of a democratic constitution in Spain (1978), did Catalonia recover its autonomy and reconstitute the Generalitat (1977). George Orwell served with the POUM in Catalonia from December 1936 until June 1937. His memoir of that time, Homage to Catalonia, was first published in 1938 and foreshadowed the causes of Second World War. It remains one of the most widely read books on the Spanish Civil War.Homage to Catalonia by George Orwell (1938) Contemporary period (1939‚Äìpresent) = Franco's dictatorship = Francisco Franco in Reus, 1940 As in the rest of Spain, the Franco era (1939‚Äì1975) in Catalonia saw the annulment of democratic liberties, the prohibition and persecution of parties, the rise of thoroughgoing censorship, and the banning of all leftist institutions. In Catalonia it also meant, yet again, the annulment of the Statute of Autonomy, the banning of the whole specifically Catalan institutions and legislation. Catalan was subject to oppression and was reduced to family use. Castilian (Spanish) became the only language of education, administration and the media. During the first years, all resistance was energetically suppressed, the prisons filled up with political prisoners, and thousands of Catalans went into exile. In addition, 4000 Catalans were executed between 1938 and 1953, among them the former president of the Generalitat Llu√≠s Companys (taken to Spain from his exile in the German-occupied France).Preston, Paul (2012). The Spanish Holocaust. Harper Press, London p. 493 The Civil War had ravaged the Spanish economy. Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed and daily business severely hampered. The economic recovery was very slow and it was not until the second half of the 1950s that the economy of Catalonia reached the prewar levels of 1936. After an initial period in which Spain tried to build an autarky, in which the economy improved little, Franco's regime changed its economic policies in 1959 and in the 1960s and early 1970s the economy entered a period of rapid economic expansion that became known as the Spanish Miracle. International firms established their factories in Spain: salaries were relatively low, strikes were forbidden, labour health or real state regulations were unheard of and Spain was virtually a virgin market. The period was marked by agricultural modernization, a massive expansion of industry and the start of mass tourism, which it was concentrated on the coast (Costa Brava in Girona and Costa Daurada in Tarragona). As industry in Catalonia expanded, workers migrated from rural areas across Spain (particularly Andalusia, Extremadura, Murcia and Galicia), to work in Barcelona and its surrounding area, turning it into one of Europe's largest industrial metropolitan areas, which in turn led to dramatic urbanisation. Working-class opposition to Franco began to appear, usually clandestinely, and most notably in the form of the Comisiones Obreras (\\"Workers Commissions\\"), a return of trade union organizing, and the revival of the PSUC, while the students' protests turned frequent. In the 1970s democratic forces united under the banner of the Assemblea de Catalunya (\\"Assembly of Catalonia\\"), demanding political and social freedom, amnesty for the political prisoners, the reestablishment of the autonomy of Catalonia and the collaboration with the democratic forces of the rest of Spain.Neixement i mort de l'Assemblea de Catalunya. La Vanguardia, 08-11-2011Batista, Antoni. ¬´L'assemblea de Catalunya, el primer gra√≥ de la transici√≥ ¬ª, S√†piens, n. 109, October 2011 During later stages of Francoist Spain, folkloric and religious celebrations in Catalan resumed and were tolerated. Use of Catalan in the mass media had been forbidden, but was permitted from the early 1950s in the theatre. During the 60s and 70s the Catalan music entered into a period of renewal and growth known as Nova Can√ß√≥. Initially appeared with Els Setze Jutges group, it quickly became a mass phenomenon that incorporated the protest song against the Dictatorship and helped bring forth prominent singers and groups such as Joan Manuel Serrat, Llu√≠s Llach, Raimon, Maria del Mar Bonet, Ovidi Montllor or Grup de Folk. = Democracy restored = Generalitat (Government) of Catalonia Federica Montseny speaks at the meeting of the CNT in Barcelona in 1977 after 36 years of exile Jordi Pujol, one hundred twenty-sixth president of the Generalitat of Catalonia (1980‚Äì2003) Franco's death initiated a period that came to be known as the \\"democratic transition\\", during which democratic liberties were restored, culminating in the Spanish Constitution of 1978. This constitution recognized the existence of multiple national communities within the Spanish State, which proposed the division of the country into autonomous communities. After the first general election in 1977 it was restored the Generalitat as a provisional government, headed by its president in exile Josep Tarradellas, and including representatives of the various leading forces of the time. In 1979, the new Statute of Autonomy was finally approved delegating more autonomy in matters of education and culture than the Republican 1932 Statute, but less in terms of the systems of justice and public order. In it, Catalonia is defined as a \\"nationality\\", Catalan is recognized as Catalonia's own language, and became co-official with Spanish. First election to the Parliament of Catalonia under this Statute gave the Catalan presidency to Jordi Pujol, a position he would hold until 2003. During this time he also led Converg√®ncia i Uni√≥ (Convergence and Unity, CiU) a center-right Catalan nationalist electoral coalition consisting of his own Converg√®ncia Democr√†tica de Catalunya (Democratic Convergence of Catalonia, CDC) and the smaller and more conservative Uni√≥ Democr√†tica de Catalunya (Democratic Union of Catalonia, UDC). Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the institutions of Catalan autonomy continued to develop, among them an autonomous police force (called Mossos d'Esquadra, officially refunded as the police of Catalonia in 1983),History of the Mossos d'Esquadra mossos.gencat.cat the restoration of the comarcal administrations (roughly equivalent to United States \\"counties\\" or United Kingdom \\"shires\\" or \\"counties\\", but distinct from the historical Catalan counties) and a High Court in the form of the High Court of Justice of Catalonia (Catalan: Tribunal Superior de Just√≠cia de Catalunya).History of the High Court of Justice of Catalonia poderjudicial.es Catalonia's Law of Linguistic Normalization promoted Catalan-language media. The broadcasting network Televisi√≥ de Catalunya and its first channel TV3, which broadcast mainly in Catalan, were created in 1983.History of Televisi√≥ de Catalunya ccma.cat The Catalan government also provides subsidies to various means of promoting Catalan culture, including for example the making of Catalan-language films or the subtitling of foreign-language films in Catalan. In 1992 Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics, which brought international attention to Catalonia. During the 1990s, the absence of absolute majorities in the Spanish parliament made governments reliant on support from the various nationalist parties (Catalan, Basque, Canary Islands, etc.) which was leveraged by CiU, to broaden the scope of Catalan autonomy during the last government of Felipe Gonz√°lez (1993‚Äì1996) and the first of Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar (1996‚Äì2000). In November 2003, elections to the Generalitat gave the plurality, but not the majority of seats to CiU. Three other parties (Socialists' Party of Catalonia‚ÄìSpanish Socialist Workers' Party, PSC-PSOE, Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Initiative for Catalonia Greens (ICV)) united to take the government into a left-wing nationalist coalition, making Pasqual Maragall, (PSC-PSOE) the new president of Catalonia. This government proved unstable, especially on the issue of reforming the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia. The Statute was approved by the Parliament of Catalonia on September 30, 2005, and subsequently it was sent to the Cortes Generales for review and discussion. They approved the law on May 10, 2006, on June 18 Catalan citizens ratified the Statute, and have been in force since August 9, 2006. The new Statute of Autonomy consolidated the self-government, and included the definition of Catalonia as a nation in the preamble.Catalonia endorses autonomy plan news.bbc.co.uk The internal tensions of Catalan Government provoked new elections, held in autumn 2006. The result was again a plurality, but not a majority, for CiU, and PSC-PSOE, ERC and ICV again formed a coalition, with Jos√© Montilla (PSC-PSOE) as president.PSC, ERC e ICV-EUiA llegan a un acuerdo para reeditar el tripartito. actualidad.terra.es On 16 September 2005, the ICANN officially approved the domain.cat, the first domain for a language community.History of the domanin .cat Fundaci√≥ .cat = Independence process = The 2012 Catalan independence demonstration Presidents Puigdemont and Forcadell after the Catalan parliament approved the independence The new Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, approved by referendum, was contested by important sectors of the Spanish nationalism and the conservative People's Party, sending the law to the partisan Constitutional Court of Spain which, in 2010, decided to declare nonvalid some of the articles that established an autonomous Catalan system of Justice, aspects of the financing, the status of the Catalan language or the references of Catalonia as a nation.Els articles anul¬∑lats per inconstitucionals. ccma.cat As a response, on 10 July 2010, a successful demonstration was held, and the civil society started a process of organization in order to exert the right of self-determination. While the economic crisis affected profoundly Spain, CiU win the Catalan election of 2010, promising a fiscal agreement similar to the Basque. Its leader, Artur Mas, was appointed as president. Initially supported by the PP, his government carried out a program of austerity. During the National Day of Catalonia, on 11 September 2012, a massive demonstration in the streets of Barcelona organized by the organization Catalan National Assembly (Assemblea Nacional Catalana, ANC) claimed for independence and a referendum of self-determination. On 23 January 2013, parliament approved a Declaration on the Sovereignty and right to decide of the people of Catalonia asserting that Catalonia is a sovereign entity and calls for a referendum on independence. After the impediments of Spanish institutions, on 9 November 2014 the Government of Catalonia organized the independence referendum, in which allegedly 1.6 million out of potential 5.4 million voters or 80.8% of the 2.25 million cast votes supported the independence option (as per unofficial records). On 9 November 2015, parliament approved a Declaration to start the independence process of Catalonia asserting the start of the process to create an independent Catalan state in the form of a republic. A controversial independence referendum was held in Catalonia on 1 October 2017, using a disputed voting process. It was declared illegal on 6 September 2017 and suspended by the Constitutional Court of Spain because it breached the Spanish Constitution. Subsequently, the European Commission agreed that the referendum was illegal. The referendum asked the question: \\"Do you want Catalonia to become an independent state in the form of a republic?\\". More than 2,020,000 voters (91.96%) answered \\"Yes\\" and around 177,000 answered \\"No\\", on a turnout of 43.03%. The Catalan government estimated that up to 770,000 votes were not cast due to polling stations being closed off during the police crackdown, although the \\"universal census\\" system introduced earlier in the day allowed electors to vote in any given polling station. Catalan government officials have argued that the turnout would be higher were it not for Spanish police suppression of the vote of the illegal referendum, and that were it not for closures and police successful intervention to siege the illegal votes. Up to 770,000 votes were lost as a result of the crackdowns at police stations, the Catalan government estimated.}} and that were it not for closures and police pressure and disproportionate violence (it is estimated that around 1,000 people were injured during that day), turnout could have been as high as 55%. On the other hand, many voters who did not support Catalan independence did not turn out. Catalonia declared independence. The independence motion was passed on 27 October 2017 in the Catalan assembly. The results of the parties remaining were with 70 votes in favour, 10 against and two blank ballots. Just hours after the Catalan declaration of independence, the Spanish Senate invoked Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution and authorised Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government to impose direct rule over Catalonia. Rajoy declared the dissolution of the Catalan Parliament and dismissed Catalonia's Government, including its president, Carles Puigdemont. Rajoy called a snap Catalan parliamentary election for 21 December 2017. Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria was chosen to assume the functions of the President of Catalonia, as part of the actions that resulted after the activation of Article 155. Santamaria was vested total control over the Catalan administration in addition to being appointed president. Josep Llu√≠s Trapero was also relieved of his duty as chief of the Catalan police force.\\"Spanish PM removes Catalan regional premier from post, calls December 21 polls\\", elpais.es, 28 October 2017 On 1 May 2018 Quim Torra was elected President of Catalonia after the Spanish courts blocked the election of Carles Puigdemont, who had the support of the Catalan Parliament after the December election. Carles Puigdemont was declared non-legible after fleeing the Spanish judiciary system. On 1 June 2018 a motion of no confidence in the Spanish government was successful, and resulted in the downfall of Mariano Rajoy and in socialist leader Pedro S√°nchez becoming new Prime Minister of Spain. Catalan nationalist parties were a key support to the downfall of Rajoy.

The idea was developed by Wilhelm Fliess in the late 19th century, and was popularized in the United States in late 1970s. The proposal has been independently tested and, consistently, no validity for it has been found. Hypothesis The theory was developed by Wilhelm Fliess in the late 19th century, and was popularized in the United States in late 1970s. Basic rhythm details  * Physical cycle ** 23 days; Circavigintan ** coordination ** strength ** well-being * Emotional cycle ** 28 days; Circatrigintan ** creativity ** sensitivity ** mood ** perception ** awareness * Intellectual cycle ** 33 days; Circatrigintan ** alertness ** analytical functioning ** logical analysis ** memory or recall ** communication thumbAccording to the theory of biorhythms, a person's life is influenced by rhythmic biological cycles that affect his or her ability in various domains, such as mental, physical and emotional activity. These cycles begin at birth and oscillate in a steady (sine wave) fashion throughout life, and by modeling them mathematically, it is suggested that a person's level of ability in each of these domains can be predicted from day to day. The theory is built on the idea that the biofeedback chemical and hormonal secretion functions within the body could show a sinusoidal behavior over time. Most biorhythm models use three cycles: a 23-day physical cycle, a 28-day emotional cycle, and a 33-day intellectual cycle.These cycles are to be adjusted based on the person's personal day clock which may run from 22 hours to 27 hours although 23-25 is the norm. Two ways you can find your personal day clock is grip test and body temperature every 15 minutes for a few days or easier same time each day for a few months. Although the 28-day cycle is the same length as the average woman's menstrual cycle and was originally described as a \\"female\\" cycle (see below), the two are not necessarily in synchronization. Each of these cycles varies between high and low extremes sinusoidally, with days where the cycle crosses the zero line described as \\"critical days\\" of greater risk or uncertainty. The numbers from +100% (maximum) to -100% (minimum) indicate where on each cycle the rhythms are on a particular day. In general, a rhythm at 0% is crossing the midpoint and is thought to have no real impact on your life, whereas a rhythm at +100% (at the peak of that cycle) would give you an edge in that area, and a rhythm at -100% (at the bottom of that cycle) would make life more difficult in that area. There is no particular meaning to a day on which your rhythms are all high or all low, except the obvious benefits or hindrances that these rare extremes are thought to have on your life. In addition to the three popular cycles, various other cycles have been proposed, based on linear combination of the three, or on longer or shorter rhythms.http://www.skepdic.com/biorhyth.html =Calculation= Theories published state the equations for the cycles as: * physical: \\\\sin(2\\\\pi t/23), * emotional: \\\\sin(2\\\\pi t/28), * intellectual: \\\\sin(2\\\\pi t/33), where t indicates the number of days since birth. Basic arithmetic shows that the combination of the simpler 23- and 28-day cycles repeats every 644 days (or 1-3/4 years), while the triple combination of 23-, 28-, and 33-day cycles repeats every 21,252 days (or 58.18+ years). History Kosmos 1 Casio Biolator Japanese Biomate biorhythm calculator The 23- and 28-day rhythms used by biorhythmists were first devised in the late 19th century by Wilhelm Fliess, a Berlin physician and patient of Sigmund Freud. Fliess believed that he observed regularities at 23- and 28-day intervals in a number of phenomena, including births and deaths. He labeled the 23-day rhythm \\"male\\" and the 28-day rhythm \\"female\\", matching the menstrual cycle. In 1904, Viennese psychology professor Hermann Swoboda came to similar conclusions. Alfred Teltscher, professor of engineering at the University of Innsbruck, developed Swoboda's work and suggested that his students' good and bad days followed a rhythmic pattern; he believed that the brain's ability to absorb, mental ability, and alertness ran in 33-day cycles. One of the first academic researchers of biorhythms was Estonian-born Nikolai P√§rna, who published a book in German called Rhythm, Life and Creation in 1923. The practice of consulting biorhythms was popularized in the 1970s by a series of books by Bernard Gittelson, including Biorhythm ‚Äî A Personal Science, Biorhythm Charts of the Famous and Infamous, and Biorhythm Sports Forecasting. Gittelson's company, Biorhythm Computers, Inc., made a business selling personal biorhythm charts and calculators, but his ability to predict sporting events was not substantiated.Hoffmann, Frank W., and William G. Bailey, Mind and Society Fads, 1992. Charting biorhythms for personal use was popular in the United States during the 1970s; many places (especially video arcades and amusement areas) had a biorhythm machine that provided charts upon entry of date of birth. Biorhythm programs were a common application on personal computers; and in the late 1970s, there were also handheld biorhythm calculators on the market, the Kosmos 1 and the Casio Biolator.http://www.vintage- technology.info/pages/calculators/k/kosmos1.htm Critical views There have been some three dozen published studies of biorhythm theory, but according to a study by Terence Hines, all of those either supported the null hypothesis that there is no correlation of human experience and the supposed biorhythms beyond what can be explained by coincidence, or, in cases where authors claimed to have evidence for biorhythm theory, methodological and statistical errors invalidated their conclusions. Hines therefore concluded that the theory is not valid. Supporters continued to defend the theory in spite of the lack of corroborating scientific evidence, leading to the charge that biorhythm theory had become a kind of pseudoscience due to its proponents' rejection of empirical testing: The physiologist Gordon Stein in the book Encyclopedia of Hoaxes (1993) has written: \\"Both the theoretical underpinning and the practical scientific verification of biorhythm theory are lacking. Without those, biorhythms became just another pseudoscientific claim that people are willing to accept without required evidence. Those pushing biorhythm calculators and books on a gullible public are guilty of making fraudulent claims. They are hoaxers of the public if they know what they are saying has no factual justification.\\"Stein, Gordon. (1993). Encyclopedia of Hoaxes. Gale Group. p. 161. A 1978 study of the incidence of industrial accidents found neither empirical nor theoretical support for the biorhythm model. In Underwood Dudley‚Äôs book, Numerology: Or What Pythagoras Wrought, he provides an example of a situation in which a magician provides a woman her biorhythm chart that supposedly included the next two years of her life. The women sent letters to the magician describing how accurate the chart was. The magician purposely sent her a biorhythm chart based on a different birthdate. After he explained that he sent the wrong chart to her, he sent her another chart, also having the wrong birthdate. She then said that this new chart was even more accurate than the previous one. This kind of willful credulous belief in vague or inaccurate prognostication derives from motivated reasoning backed up by fallacious acceptance of confirmation bias, post hoc rationalization, and suggestibility. Wilhelm Fliess \\"was able to impose his number patterns on virtually everything\\" and worked to convince others that cycles happen within men and women every 23 and 28 days. Mathematically, Fliess‚Äôs equation, n = 23x +28y is unconstrained as there are infinitely many solutions for x and y, meaning that Fliess and Freud (who adopted this idea in the early 1890s) could predict anything they wanted with the combination. The skeptical evaluations of the various biorhythm proposals led to a number of critiques lambasting the subject published in the 1970s and 1980s. Biorhythm advocates who objected to the takedowns claimed that because circadian rhythms had been empirically verified in many organisms' sleep cycles, biorhythms were just as plausible. However, unlike biorhythms which are claimed to have precise and unaltering periods, circadian rhythms are found by observing the cycle itself and the periods are found to vary in length based on biological and environmental factors. Assuming such factors were relevant to biorhythms would result in chaotic cycle combinations that remove any \\"predictive\\" features. = Additional studies = Several controlled, experimental studies found no correlation between the 23, 28 and 33 day cycles and academic performance. These studies include:  James (1984)  James hypothesized that if biorhythms were rooted in science, then each proposed biorhythm cycle would contribute to task performance. Further, he predicted that each type of biorhythm cycle (i.e., intellectual, physical, and emotional) would be most influential on tasks associated with the corresponding cycle type. For example, he postulated that intellectual biorhythm cycles would be most influential on academic testing performance. In order to test his hypotheses, James observed 368 participants, noting their performance on tasks associated with intellectual, physical, and emotional functioning. Based on data collected from his experimental research, James concluded the there was no relation between subjects' biorhythmic status (on any of the three cycle types), and their performance on the associated practical tests.  Peveto (1980)  Peveto examined the proposed relationship between biorhythms and academic performance, specifically in terms of reading ability. Through examination of the data collected, Peveto concluded that there were no significant differences in the academic performance of the students, in regards to reading, during the high, low, or critical positions of neither the physical biorhythm cycle, the emotional biorhythm cycle, nor the intellectual biorhythm cycle. As a result, it was concluded that biorhythm cycles have no effect on the academic performance of students, when academic performance was measured using reading ability.

Milo of Croton (; Greek: ŒúŒØŒªœâŒΩ, M√≠l≈çn; gen.: ŒúŒØŒªœâŒΩŒøœÇ, M√≠l≈çnos) was a 6th- century BC wrestler from the Magna Graecian city of Croton, who enjoyed a brilliant wrestling career and won many victories in the most important athletic festivals of ancient Greece. His father was named Diotimus (ŒîŒπŒøœÑŒØŒºŒøœÇ).Pausanias, Description of Greece, 6.14.5 In addition to his athletic victories, Milo is credited by the ancient commentator Diodorus Siculus with leading his fellow citizens to a military triumph over neighbouring Sybaris in 510 BC. Milo was also said to have carried a bull on his shoulders, and to have burst a band about his brow by simply inflating the veins of his temples. The date of Milo's death is unknown. According to legend he was attempting to tear a tree apart when his hands became trapped in a crevice in its trunk, and a pack of wolves (in later versions often changed to a lion) surprised and devoured him. This story has been depicted in works of art by Pierre Puget, √âtienne-Maurice Falconet and others. Literary allusions to this story appear in works such as Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel, Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida, and Alexandre Dumas's The Man in the Iron Mask. Athletic career Milo was a six-time Olympic victor. He won the boys' wrestling (probably in 540 BC),At Olympia, a \\"boy\\" was a male between his seventeenth and twentieth birthday. (Harris, p. 154‚Äì155) and thereafter five men's wrestling titles between 536 and 520 BCE. He also won seven crowns at the Pythian Games at Delphi (one as a boy), ten at the Isthmian Games, and nine at the Nemean Games. Milo was a five-time Periodonikƒìs, a \\"grand slam\\" sort of title bestowed on the winner of all four festivals in the same cycle. Milo's career at the highest level of competition must have spanned 24 years. To intimidate his opponents, Milo of Croton would consume raw bull's meat in front of his adversary and would drink raw bull's blood for energy and vitality. Milo was defeated (or tied) in his attempt at a seventh Olympic title in 516 BCE by a young wrestler from Croton who practised the technique of akrocheirismos‚Äîliterally, 'high-handedness' or wrestling at arm's length‚Äîand by doing so, avoided Milo's crushing embrace. Simple fatigue took its toll on Milo. Milo's home town had a reputation for producing excellent athletes. In the Olympiad of 576 BC, for example, the first seven finishers in the stade‚Äîa sprint‚Äîwere all men of Croton. After Milo's career, Croton apparently produced no other athletes of renown. Military experience Heracles wearing a hero's wreath, a lion-skin, and carrying a club. Milo appeared in similar dress at the battle between Croton and Sybaris in 510 BC. Detail of Herakles from Side A of the vase, \\"Herakles and the gathering of the Argonauts (aka \\"Herakles in Marathon\\"), Attic red-figure calyx-krater, 460‚Äì50 BCE, Louvre. About 510 BC, hostilities arose between Croton and nearby Sybaris when Telys, a Sybarite tyrant, banished the 500 wealthiest citizens of Sybaris after seizing their property. When the displaced Sybarites sought refuge at Croton and Telys demanded their return, an opportunity for the Crotoniates to destroy a powerful neighbour presented itself. In an account that appeared five hundred years after the event, Diodorus Siculus wrote that the philosopher Pythagoras, who spent much of his life at Croton, urged the Croton assembly to protect the banished citizens of Sybaris. When the decision to do so was made, the dispute between the two cities was aggravated, each took up arms, and Milo led the charge against Sybaris. According to Diodorus (XII, 9): > \\"One hundred thousand men of Croton were stationed with three hundred > thousand Sybarite troops ranged against them. Milo the athlete led them and > through his tremendous physical strength first turned the troops lined up > against him.\\" Diodorus indicates Milo led the charge against the Sybarites wearing his Olympic crowns, draped in a lion skin and brandishing a club in a manner similar to the mythic hero Heracles (see adjacent image). Personal life According to Pausanias he was the son of Diotimus.Pausanias, VI, 14, 5. Ancient commentators mention an association between Milo and the philosopher Pythagoras, who lived at or near Croton for many years. Commentators may have confused the philosopher with an athletic trainer, Pythagoras of Samos, but it is also possible the trainer and the philosopher were the same person. It was said Milo saved Pythagoras's life when a pillar collapsed in a banquet hall and he supported the roof until Pythagoras could reach safety. He may have married Myia, a Pythagorean herself or possibly Pythagoras' daughter. Diogenes La√´rtius (VIII, 39) says Pythagoras died in a fire in Milo's house, but Dicaearchus (as cited by Diogenes La√´rtius, VIII, 40) says Pythagoras died in the temple of the Muses at Metapontum of self-imposed starvation. Porphyry (Vita Pythagorae, 55) says Milo's house at Croton was burned and the Pythagoreans within stoned. Herodotus (III, 137-38), who lived some years after Milo's death, says the wrestler accepted a large sum of money from the distinguished physician Democedes for the privilege of marrying Milo's daughter. If Herodotus is indeed correct, then Milo was probably not a member of Croton's nobility for such an arrangement with a wage-earning physician would have been beneath the dignity of a Greek noble. Democedes was a native of Croton and enjoyed a successful career as a physician at Croton, Aegina, Athens, and Samos. He was captured by Darius in the defeat of the Samian tyrant Polycrates and taken to the Persian capital of Susa as a slave. There, he carefully tended both the king and queen and was eventually permitted to revisit Croton, but under guard. He escaped his Persian guards and made his way to Croton, where he married Milo's daughter. The physician sent a message regarding his marriage to Darius, who was an admirer of the wrestler and can only have learned of him through Democedes during his slavery at Susa.(Harris, p. 113) Cultural representations =Place of champions in Greek culture= Like the tragic protagonists of Greek drama, Greek athletes had a \\"larger than life\\" quality. At Olympia, for example, they were set apart from the general population for lengthy training periods and the observation of a complex series of prohibitions that included abstinence from intercourse. Once training was completed and the athletes were brought before their fellow citizens trim, fit, nude and shimmering with oil, they must have appeared semi-divine. The reverential awe in which athletes were held in Greece led to exaggeration in the tales surrounding their lives. In Milo's case, Aristotle (Ethica Nichomachea, II, 6 = 1106b) began the myth-making process with reports likening Milo unto Heracles in his enormous appetite, and Athenaeus (X, 412e-f) continued the process with the story of Milo carrying a bull‚Äîa feat also associated with Heracles. It is Milo's sudden death which makes him most akin to the heroes: there is a hint of hubris in his attempt to rend the tree asunder, and striking contrast between his glorious athletic achievements and his sudden ignoble death. =Feats of strength= Anecdotes about Milo's almost superhuman strength and lifestyle abound. His daily diet allegedly consisted of 9 kg (20 lbs) of meat, 9 kg (20 lbs) of bread, and 10 litres (18 pt) of wine. Pliny the Elder (XXXVII, 54 = 144) and Solinus (De mirabilibus mundi, 77) both attribute Milo's invincibility in competition to the wrestler's consumption of alectoriae, the gizzard stones of roosters. Legends say he carried his own bronze statue to its place at Olympia, and once carried a four-year-old bull on his shoulders before slaughtering, roasting, and devouring it in one day. He was said to have achieved the feat of lifting the bull by starting in childhood, lifting and carrying a newborn calf and repeating the feat daily as it grew to maturity. One report says the wrestler was able to hold a pomegranate without damaging it while challengers tried to pry his fingers from it, and another report says he could burst a band fastened around his brow by inhaling air and causing the temple veins to swell. He was said to maintain his footing on an oiled discus while others tried to push him from it.Pausanias, VI, 14, 6-7. These feats have been attributed to misinterpretations of statues depicting Milo with his head bound in victor's ribbons, his hand holding the apple of victory, and his feet positioned on a round disc that would have been fitted into a pedestal or base. When he participated in the Olympics for the seventh time and collided against a fellow, the eighteen year Timasiteo, who admired him as a child and where he also learned many moves, the final, his opponent bowed before they had even started fighting, in a sign of respect. This was the only case in the history of Greece when we remember the name of the man who finished second in a race / competition. A statue of Milo was made by Dameas (ŒîŒ±ŒºŒ≠Œ±œÇ) of CrotonPausanias, Description of Greece, 6.14.5 and placed in the stadium of Olympia, where he was represented standing on a disc with their feet united. While one report says Milo held his arm outstretched and challengers were unable to bend his fingers, another anecdote recorded by Claudius Aelianus (Varia historia, XII, 12) disputes Milo's reputation for enormous strength. Apparently, Milo challenged a peasant named Titormus to a trial of strength. Titormus proclaimed he had little strength, but lifted a boulder to his shoulders, carried it several meters and dropped it. Milo was unable to lift it. =Death= The Ancient Greeks typically attributed remarkable deaths to famous persons in keeping with their characters. The date of Milo's death is unknown, but according to Strabo (VI, 1, 12) and Pausanias (VI, 14, 8), Milo was walking in a forest when he came upon a tree-trunk split with wedges. In what was probably intended as a display of strength, Milo inserted his hands into the cleft to rend the tree. The wedges fell from the cleft, and the tree closed upon his hands, trapping him. Unable to free himself, the wrestler was devoured by wolves. A modern historian has suggested it is more likely that Milo was travelling alone when attacked by wolves. Unable to escape, he was devoured and his remains found at the foot of a tree. =Modern art and literature= Milo of Croton, Attempting to Test His Strength, Is Caught and Devoured by a Lion by Charles Meynier (1795). In art of this period he is often depicted being killed by a lion rather than wolves. Milo's legendary strength and death have become the subjects of modern art and literature. His death was a popular subject in 18th-century art. In many images of this period his killer is portrayed as a lion rather than wolves. In Pierre Puget's sculpture Milo of Croton (1682), the work's themes are the loss of strength with age, and the ephemeral nature of glory as symbolized by an Olympic trophy lying in the dust. √âtienne-Maurice Falconet's marble Milo of Croton (1754) secured his admission to the Acad√©mie des beaux-arts, but was later criticized for lack of nobility. The work clashed with the classical ideal requiring a dying hero to express stoic restraint. Milo was the subject of a bronze by Alessandro Vittoria circa 1590, and another bronze now standing in Holland Park, London by an unknown nineteenth-century artist. A sculpture was made by John Graham Lough and exhibited at the Royal Academy. It was depicted by Ralph Hedley in a painting of the artist in his studio,John Graham Lough and a bronze cast of it stands in the grounds of Blagdon Hall, Northumberland. His death is also depicted in paintings. It is the subject of an eighteenth- century oil on canvas by Joseph-Beno√Æt Suv√©e and a work by the eighteenth- century Irish painter James Barry. In literature, Fran√ßois Rabelais compares Gargantua's strength to that of Milo's in Gargantua and Pantagruel, and Shakespeare refers anachronistically to \\"bull-bearing Milo\\" in Act 2 of Troilus and Cressida. In Emily Bront√´'s Wuthering Heights, character Catherine Earnshaw refers to the circumstances of Milo's demise when she says, \\"Who is to separate us, pray? They'll meet the fate of Milo!\\" In Johann Wyss' novel Swiss Family Robinson, the youngest son Franz is entrusted with a bull buffalo to raise, and from which gains comparison to Milo. Alexandre Dumas has the strongest of the Three Musketeers, Porthos, mention \\"Milo of Crotona\\" saying that he had replicated a list of his feats of strength - all except breaking a cord tied around the head, whereupon d'Artagnan tells Porthos that it is because his strength is not in his head (a joke about Porthos being a bit dim- witted). The chocolate and malt powder drink base, Milo, developed by Thomas Mayne in Australia in 1934 is named after Milo of Croton. Milo, a magazine covering strength sports that was published from 1993 to 2018, is also named after him.

As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves the athlete attempting a maximal weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates. Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as \\"odd lifts\\", which followed the same three-attempt format but used a wider variety of events, akin to strongman competition. Eventually odd lifts became standardized to the current three. In competition, lifts may be performed equipped or un-equipped (typically referred to as 'classic' or 'raw' lifting in the IPF specifically). Equipment in this context refers to a supportive bench shirt or squat/deadlift suit or briefs. In some federations, knee wraps are permitted in the equipped but not un-equipped division; in others, they may be used in both equipped and un-equipped lifting. Weight belts, knee sleeves, wrist wraps and special footwear may also be used, but are not considered when distinguishing equipped from un-equipped lifting. Competitions take place across the world. Powerlifting has been a Paralympic sport (bench press only) since 1984 and, under the IPF, is also a World Games sport. Local, national and international competitions have also been sanctioned by other federations operating independently of the IPF. History =Early history= The roots of powerlifting are found in traditions of strength training stretching back as far as ancient Greek and ancient Persian times. The idea of powerlifting originated in ancient Greece, as men lifted stones to prove their strength and manhood. Weightlifting has been an official sport in the Olympic Games since 1896. The modern sport originated in the United Kingdom and the United States in the 1950s. Previously, the weightlifting governing bodies in both countries had recognized various \\"odd lifts\\" for competition and record purposes. During the 1950s, Olympic weightlifting declined in the United States, while strength sports gained many new followers. People did not like the Olympic lifts Clean and Press, Snatch and Clean and Jerk. In 1958, the AAU's National Weightlifting Committee decided to begin recognizing records for odd lifts. A national championship was tentatively scheduled for 1959, but never happened. The first genuine national \\"meet\\" was held in September 1964 under the auspices of the York Barbell Company. Ironically, York Barbell owner Bob Hoffman had been a longtime adversary of the sport, but his company was now making powerlifting equipment to make up for the sales it had lost on Olympic equipment. In 1964, some powerlifting categories were added to the Tokyo Paralympic Games for men with spinal cord injuries. More categories of lifting were added as time went by. In the 2000 Paralympic Games in Sydney, women were finally invited to participate in powerlifting. Finally, both men and women were allowed to compete in all 10 weight classes of powerlifting. During the late 1950s, Hoffman's influence on Olympic lifting and his predominately Olympic-based magazine Strength and Health were beginning to come under increasing pressure from Joe Weider's organization. In order to combat the growing influence of Weider, Hoffman started another magazine, Muscular Development, which would be focused more on bodybuilding and the fast-growing interest in odd lift competitions. The magazine's first editor was John Grimek. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, various odd lift events gradually developed into the specific lifts of the bench press, squat, and deadlift, and they were lifted in that order. Hoffman became more and more influential in the development of this new lifting sport and organized the Weightlifting Tournament of America in 1964, effectively the first USA National championships. In 1965, the first named USA National Championships were held. During the same period, lifting in Britain also had factions. In the late 1950s, because members of the ruling body (BAWLA) were only interested in the development of Olympic lifting, a breakaway organization called the Society of Amateur Weightlifters had been formed to cater for the interests of lifters who were not particularly interested in Olympic lifting. Although at that time there were 42 recognized lifts, the \\"Strength Set\\" (biceps curl, bench press, and squat) soon became the standard competition lifts, and both organizations held Championships on these lifts (as well as on the Olympic lifts) until 1965. In 1966, the Society of Amateur Weightlifters rejoined BAWLA and, in order to fall into line with the American lifts, the biceps curl was dropped and replaced with the deadlift. The first British Championship was held in 1966. During the late 1960s and at the beginning of the 1970s, various friendly international contests were held. At the same time, in early November of each year and to commemorate Hoffman's birthday, a prestigious lifting contest was held. In 1971, it was decided to make this event the \\"World Weightlifting Championships\\". The event was held on the morning of 6 November 1971, in York, Pennsylvania. There was no such thing as teams and thus the event consisted of a large group of American lifters, four British lifters, and one lifter from the West Indies. All of the referees were American. Weights were in pounds. Lifting order was \\"rising bar\\", and the first lift was the bench press. There was no such thing as a bench shirt or squat suit, and various interpretations were held regarding the use and length of knee wraps and weightlifting belts. The IPF rules system did not exist yet, nor had world records been established. Because of the lack of formalized rules, some disputes occurred. There was no 52 kg class, 100 kg class, or 125 kg class. At the first World Championships, one of the American super- heavyweights, Jim Williams, benched 660 lbs on his second attempt (no shirt), and almost locked out 680 lbs on a third attempt. Some other notable lifts were Larry Pacifico benching 515 lbs in the 90 kg class, John Kuc deadlifting 820 lbs, and Vince Anello attempting 800 lbs at 90 kg. Hugh Cassidy and Williams both totaled 2,160 lbs, but Cassidy got the win because of a lower bodyweight in the Super heavyweight division. In 1972, the 'second' AAU World Championships were held, this time over two days ‚Äì 10 and 11 November. This time there were 8 lifters from Great Britain (two of whom, Ron Collins and John Pegler, did stints as Referees), six Canadians, two Puerto Ricans, three Zambians, and one from the West Indies. With 67 lifters in all, the other 47 were Americans. Lifts were still measured in pounds, the bench press was the first lift, and there were still no suits, power belts, or fancy wraps. New Zealand's Precious McKenzie won his 'second' world title with 550 kg at 56. Mike Shaw 'lost' his world title, won the previous year, to American Jack Keammerer. Ron Collins made up for his 'bomb' on the bench in 1971 and stormed to the 75 kg title. Pacifico just won against another American, Mel Hennessey, at 110 kg, both with enormous benches of 260 kg and 255 kg. At Super (over 110 kg) John Kuc beat Jim Williams with an incredible 2,350 lbs total (raw). Kuc squatting 905 lbs for a record squat and attempting a 397¬Ω (875 lbs) deadlift again, and Williams benching a massive 307¬Ω (675 lbs) ‚Äì the greatest bench press ever at the time, before just missing with 317¬Ω (700 lbs). Jon Cole, the Super heavyweight winner of the US Senior Championships 1972 and holder of the greatest total at that time with 1,075 kg (2,370 lbs), didn't show up to take on Kuc. =IPF and after= The International Powerlifting Federation was formed immediately after the contest, and so none of the lifts could be yet registered as official world records. The 1973 Worlds was also held in York. This time there were only 47 entrants: one Swedish, one Puerto Rican (Peter Fiore, who was lifting for Zambia), two Canadians, one West Indian, eight British, and the rest Americans. The officiating became more international and included Tony Fitton and Terry Jordan from Britain, a Canadian, and a Zambian. American Bob Crist was the IPF President, and another American, Clarence Johnson, was vice-president. 1973 was the first time that the lifts were done in the order now recognized ‚Äì squat, bench press, deadlift (although still lifting in pounds). Precious Mackenzie won his third World title, easily beating American teenager Lamar Gant. 1974 was the first time that teams had to be selected in advance. With 74 entrants, this was the largest Worlds so far. The 52 kg class was introduced, and nine lifters entered. In 1975, the World Championships was held outside America for the first time, at the town hall in Birmingham, hosted by Vic Mercer. 82 lifters entered. Unusually for a competition, the super-heavyweights lifted first. This was because the television company filming the event was only interested in filming the \\"big guys\\". Hoffman sent over tons of equipment for this contest and did not take it back, and local legend says it is all still being used in Birmingham and the wider West Midlands region. The establishment of the IPF in 1973 spurred the establishment of the EPF (European Powerlifting Federation) in 1974. Since it was closely associated with bodybuilding and women had been competing as bodybuilders for years, the new sport was opened to them very quickly. The first U. S. national championships for women were held in 1978 and the IPF added women's competition in 1979. In the US, the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 required that each Olympic or potential Olympic sport must have its own national governing body by November 1980. As a result, the AAU lost control of virtually every amateur sport. The USPF was founded in 1980 as the new national governing body for American powerlifting. Soon, controversy over drug testing would cause powerlifting to splinter into multiple federations. In 1981, the American Drug Free Powerlifting Association (ADFPA), led by Brother Bennett, became the first federation to break away from the USPF, citing the need to implement effective drug testing in the sport. Meanwhile, the IPF was moving towards adopting drug testing at international meets, and requiring member nations to implement drug testing at national meets as well. In 1982, drug testing was introduced to the IPF men's international championship, although the USPF championships that year did not have drug testing. The IPF's push for drug testing was resisted by some American lifters, and in 1982 Larry Pacifico and Ernie Frantz founded the American Powerlifting Federation (APF), which advertised its categorical opposition to all drug testing. In 1987, the American Powerlifting Association (APA) and World Powerlifting Alliance (WPA) were formed by Scott Taylor. The APA and WPA offer both drug tested and non- tested categories in most of their competitions. As of 2018 the WPA has 50+ affiliate nations. Ultimately, the USPF failed to conform to IPF demands and was expelled from the international body in 1997, with the ADFPA, now named USA Powerlifting (USAPL), taking its place. Despite the trend towards more and more federations, each with their own rules and standards of performance, some powerlifters have attempted to bring greater unity to the sport. For example, 100% RAW promoted unequipped competition and merged with another federation, Anti-Drug Athletes United (ADAU), in 2013. The Revolution Powerlifting Syndicate (RPS), founded by Gene Rychlak in 2011, might also be considered a move towards greater unity, as the RPS breaks the tradition of charging lifters membership fees to a specific federation in addition to entry fees for each competition. Also, some meet promoters have sought to bring together top lifters from different federations, outside existing federations' hierarchy of local, regional, national and international meets; a prominent example of this is the Raw Unity Meet (RUM), held annually since 2007. =Developments in equipment and rules= As new equipment was developed, it came to distinguish powerlifting federations from one another. Weight belts and knee wraps (originally simple Ace bandages) predated powerlifting, but in 1983 John Inzer invented the first piece of equipment distinct to powerlifters‚Äîthe bench shirt. Bench shirts and squat/deadlift suits (operating on the same principle) became ubiquitous in powerlifting, but only some federations adopted the latest and most supportive canvas, denim, and multiply polyester designs, while others such as the IPF maintained more restrictive rules on which supportive equipment could be used. The Monolift, a rack in which the bar catches swing out and eliminate the walkout portion of the squat, was invented by Ray Madden and first used in competition in 1992. This innovation was adopted by some federations and forbidden in others. Other inventions included specialized squat bars and deadlift bars, moving away from the IPF standard of using the same bar for all three lifts. The rules of powerlifting have also evolved and differentiated. For example, in ADFPA/USAPL competition, the \\"press\\" command on the bench press was used, not used, and then used again, following a 2006 IPF motion to reinstate this rule. IPF rules also mandate a \\"start\\" command at the beginning of the bench press. Many other federations, for example the Natural Athlete Strength Association (NASA), have never used the \\"start\\" command. As a further example of diversifying rules of performance, in 2011 the Southern Powerlifting Federation (SPF) eliminated the \\"squat\\" command at the beginning of the squat. Some federations also now allow the sumo variation of the deadlift, which varies with the feet being considerably wider apart and some tension taken off the lower spine being taken up by the legs. Many communities and federations do not class the sumo variation as a technical deadlift. Supportive equipment In powerlifting, supportive equipment refers to supportive shirts, briefs, suits, and sometimes knee wraps made of materials that store elastic potential energy and thereby assist the three lifts contested in the sport: squat, bench press and deadlift. Some federations allow single ply knee sleeves, which contestant can put on and off by himself, and wraps for wrists in raw competition, while some don't and there are also some federations that hold raw records with and without wraps like GPA. Straps are also used, as help with deadlift in case of a weak grip but are not allowed by any federations in official competitions. A belt is the only supportive equipment that is allowed by all federations in raw competition. The use of supportive equipment distinguishes 'equipped' and 'un-equipped' or 'raw' divisions in the sport, and 'equipped' and 'unequipped' records in the competition lifts. The wide differences between equipped and unequipped records in the squat and bench suggest that supportive equipment confers a substantial advantage to lifters in these disciplines. This is less evident in the case of the deadlift, where the lack of an eccentric component to the lift minimizes how much elastic energy can be stored in a supportive suit. Supportive equipment should not be confused with the equipment on which the lifts are performed, such as a bench press bench, conventional or monolift stand for squat or the barbell and discs; nor with personal accessories such as a weightlifting belt that may allow greater weight to be lifted, but by mechanisms other than storing elastic energy. Chalk is commonly used by lifters to dry the hands, especially to reduce the risk of folding and pinching of skin while gripping the deadlift. Chalk can also be added to the shoulders for squatting and on the back for bench pressing to reduce sliding on the bench. = Principles of operation = Supportive equipment is used to increase the weight lifted in powerlifting exercises. A snug garment is worn over a joint or joints (such as the shoulders or hips). This garment deforms during the downward portion of a bench press or squat, or the descent to the bar in the deadlift, storing elastic potential energy. On the upward portion of each lift, the elastic potential energy is transferred to the barbell as kinetic energy, aiding in the completion of the lift. Some claim that supportive equipment prevents injuries by compressing and stabilizing the joints over which it worn. For example, the bench shirt is claimed to support and protect the shoulders. Critics point out that the greater weights used with supportive equipment and the equipment's tendency to change the pattern of the movement may compromise safety, as in the case of the bar moving towards the head during the upward portion of the shirted bench press. = Material and construction = Different materials are used in the construction of supportive equipment. Squat suits may be made of varying types of polyester, or of canvas. The latter fabric is less elastic, and therefore considered to provide greater 'stopping power' at the bottom of the movement but less assistance with the ascent. Bench shirts may be made of polyester or denim, where the denim again provides a less-elastic alternative to the polyester. Knee wraps are made of varying combinations of cotton and elastic. Supportive equipment can be constructed in different ways to suit lifters' preferences. A squat or deadlift suit may be constructed for a wide or a narrow stance; and a bench shirt may be constructed with 'straight' sleeves (perpendicular to the trunk of the lifter) or sleeves that are angled towards the abdomen. The back of the bench shirt may be closed or open, and the back panel may or may not be of the same material as the front of the shirt. Similarly, 'hybrid' squat suits can include panels made from canvas and polyester, in an effort to combine the strengths of each material. When two or more panels overlay one another in a piece of supportive equipment, that equipment is described as 'multi-ply', in contrast to 'single-ply' equipment made of one layer of material throughout. =Raw powerlifting= Unequipped or \\"raw\\" (often styled as RAW) or classic powerlifting has been codified in response to the proliferation and advancement of bench shirts and squat/deadlift suits. The AAU first began its raw division in 1994 and the term \\"raw\\" was coined by Al Siegal who later formed the ADAU in 1996. The 100% RAW federation was founded in 1999; within a decade, many established federations came to recognize \\"raw\\" divisions in addition to their traditional (open) divisions permitting single-ply or multi-ply equipment. RAW during this time frame however was looked upon as a beginners stage by the elite lifters in powerlifting. In January 2008 the Raw Unity Meet (simply known as \\"RUM\\") was formed by Eric Talmant and Johnny Vasquez. This contest became the turning point in raw lifting. It was a crucial contest that gathered the best lifters under one roof regardless of gear worn to compete without equipment. Brian Schwab, Amy Weisberger, Beau Moore, Tony Conyers, Arnold Coleman and Dave Ricks were among the first Elite lifters to remove their equipment and compete raw. RUM spearheaded raw lifting into what it has become today. United Powerlifting Association (UPA) established a standard for raw powerlifting in 2008 and USAPL held the first Raw Nationals in the same year. Eventually, IPF recognized raw lifting with the sanction of a \\"Classic 'Unequipped' World Cup\\" in 2012, and published its own set of standards for raw lifting. By this time, the popularity of raw lifting has surged to the point where raw lifters came to predominate over equipped lifters in local meets. Note that the IPF's use of the word 'classic' to describe raw powerlifting is differentiated from most other powerlifting federations' use of the word to differentiate between 'classic raw' and 'modern raw': classic raw is still unequipped but allows the use of knee wraps while modern raw allows knee sleeves at most. The IPF does not allow knee wraps in its unequipped competitions and would thus be considered 'modern raw' but the IPF does not recognize the word 'raw.' The use of knee sleeves in unequipped powerlifting has brought about much debate as to whether certain neoprene knee sleeves can actually assist a lifter during the squat. Some lifters purposely wear knee sleeves which are excessively tight and have been known to use plastic bags and have others to assist them get their knee sleeves on. This led to the IPF mandating that lifters put on their knee sleeves unassisted.  Equipped powerlifting  Equipped lifters compete separately from raw lifters. Equipped lifters will wear a squat suit, knee wraps, a bench shirt, and a deadlift suit. These four things are what separate equipped lifters and raw lifters. A squat suit is made of an elastic-like material, and a single-ply polyester layer. This allows a competitor to spring out of the bottom of a squat (called \\"pop out of the hole\\" in Powerlifting circles) by maintaining rigidity, keeping him or her upright and encouraging their hips to remain parallel with the floor. This allows lifters to lift more weight than would normally be possible without the suit. There are also multi- ply suits giving the lifter even more rigidity, like that of a traditional canvas suit, with the same pop as a single-ply suit or briefs but are exponentially harder to use, and are usually reserved for the top lifters. During the squat, lifters also tend to wear knee wraps. Even though knee wraps will be a sub-classification of raw lifting it will still be worn by equipped lifters. A raw lifter who would squat in knee wraps will have the weight lifted noted as \\"in wraps\\" to distinguish this from the other raw lifters. Knee wraps are made out of the same, or very similar, elastic material as wrist wraps are made out of. They are wrapped around the lifters knees very tightly with the lifter usually not being able to do it himself and needing someone to assist them in doing so. The knee wraps are wrapped in a spiral or diagonal method. The knee wraps build elastic energy during the eccentric part of the squat and once the lifter has hit proper depth the lifter will start the concentric part of the movement releasing this elastic energy and using it to help them move the weight upwards. It gives the lifter more spring, or pop out of the hole of the squat resulting in a heavier and faster squat. For the bench press, there are also single-ply and multi-ply bench shirts that work similarly to a squat suit. It acts as artificial pectoral muscles and shoulder muscles for the lifter. It resists the movement of the bench press by compressing and building elastic energy. When the bar is still and the official gives the command to press the compression and elastic energy of the suit aids in the speed of the lift, and support of the weight that the lifter would not be able to provide for himself without the bench shirt. In order to achieve proper tightness and fitting the lifter must be assisted when putting the bench shirt on for it is not possible to be done alone. For the deadlift suit, there is single-ply and multi-ply as well. The elastic energy is built when the lifter goes down to set up and place their grip on the bar before lifting even starts. The deadlift suit aids in getting the weight off the floor, considered to be the first part of the movement, but not very helpful on the lockout portion of the deadlift, known as the second part of the movement.  Classes and categories  Weight Classes: Most powerlifting federations use the following weight classes: Men: 52 kg, 56 kg, 60 kg, 67.5 kg, 75 kg, 82.5 kg, 90 kg, 100 kg, 110 kg, 125 kg, 140 kg, 140 kg+ Women: 44 kg, 48 kg, 52 kg, 56 kg, 60 kg, 67.5 kg, 75 kg, 82.5 kg, 90 kg, 90 kg+ However, in 2011, the IPF introduced the following new weight classes: IPF Weight Classes: Men: up to 53 kg (Sub-Junior/Junior), 59 kg, 66 kg, 74 kg, 83 kg, 93 kg, 105 kg, 120 kg, 120 kg+ Women: up to 43 kg (Sub-Junior/Junior), 47 kg, 52 kg, 57 kg, 63 kg, 72 kg, 84 kg, 84 kg+ Age categories This depends on the federation generally but averages are as follows: 15-18 (Sub-Jr), 19-23 (Jr), Any age(Open), 40+(Masters) The IPF uses the following age categories: sub-junior (18 and under), junior (19-23), open (24-39), masters 1 (40-49), masters 2 (50-59), masters 3 (60-69), masters 4 (70+). Age category is dependent on the year of the participant's birth. For example, if the participant turns 18 years old in January, he or she is still considered a Sub-junior until the end of that calendar year. Other federations typically break the Masters' categories down to 5-year increments, for example, 40‚Äì44, 45‚Äì49, 50‚Äì54, etc. Some federations also include a sub-master class from 33 (or 35) to 39. Grip There are multiple types of grip in powerlifting. Not all are allowed in competitions. There are couple of classifications: *considering the position of the barbell in the hand ** full grip - mostly used in squats, military press and push press ** fingertip grip - mostly used in deadlift *considering the position of the thumb ** regular grip ** thumbless or suicide or false or monkey or open-hand grip - mostly used in squats and recreational bench press ** hook grip - sometimes used in deadlift *considering the orientation of the palm ** prone/pronated or overhand or double overhand grip - used in bench press and deadlift; the last term is almost exclusively used when talking about deadlift ** reverse or supine/supinated or underhand grip - sometimes used in bench press ** alternated or mixed grip - one hand is supinated and the other is pronated; often used in deadlift *considering the distance between hands - almost exclusively used when talking about bench press ** wide grip ** narrow grip *combinations ** thumbless mixed grip - sometimes used in deadlift  Competition  A powerlifting competition takes place as follows: > Each competitor is allowed three attempts on each of the squat, bench press, > and deadlift, depending on their standing and the organization they are > lifting in. The lifter's best valid attempt on each lift counts toward the > competition total. For each weightclass, the lifter with the highest total > wins. In many meets, the lifter with the highest total relative to their > weight class also wins. If two or more lifters achieve the same total, the > lighter lifter ranks above the heavier lifter.IPF (PDF), p. 2. Retrieved > 12 August 2007. Competitors are judged against other lifters of the same gender, weight class, and age. This helps to ensure that the accomplishments of lifters like Lamar Gant, who has deadlifted 5 times his bodyweight, are recognized alongside those of Benedikt Magn√∫sson, the current All-time deadlift world record holder. Comparisons of lifters and scores across different weight classes can also be made using handicapping systems. World federations use the following ones: IPF Points (IPF), Glossbrenner (WPC), Reshel (APF, GPC, GPA, WUAP, IRP), Outstanding Lifter (aka OL or NASA), Schwartz/Malone, Siff; for cadet and junior categories Foster coefficient is mostly used, while for master categories (above 40 years old) McCulloch or Reshel coefficients. Winner of a competition based on an official coefficient used by presiding world federation is called best lifter. During the 2016 World Open Powerlifting Championships, the three best competitors were Fedosienko Sergey, Summer Blaine, and Olech Jaroslaw. The country with the most combined points was Ukraine, who beat the next best team United States by close to 100 points. The 2016 championships did not see the same athletic stand out that the 2015 championships did by athlete Samuel Ogden from Ohio.  Events  In a powerlifting competition, sometimes referred to as standard competition, there are three events: bench press, squat and deadlift. Placing is achieved via combined total. Some variations of this are found at some meets such as \\"push- pull only\\" meets where lifters only compete in the bench press and deadlift, with the bench press coming first and the deadlift after. Single lift meets (or full meets) are often held, sometimes alongside a normal 3-lift event. This is most common in the bench press. At a meet, the events will follow in order: squat, then bench press, and the deadlift will be the final lift of the meet. If the federation also has an event for strict curls, this will normally occur before the squat event. There are also, though very rarely, endurance meets (or \\"for repetitions\\" meets) where lifters compete in number of repetitions of exercise with the same weight (most often bench press and most often the weight is equal to lifter's weight). WDFPF held such competitions.  Rules  = Squat = There are two types depending on equipment used: conventional stand and monolift stand. In case of the former lift is called walked out squat and in case of the latter lift is called monolift squat. Most powerlifting federations allow for monolift squats. The ones that do not are the IPF, IPL and the WDFPF. The lift starts with the lifter standing erect and the bar loaded with weights resting on the lifter's shoulders. At the referee's command the lift begins. The lifter creates a break in the hips, bends their knees and drops into a squatting position with the hip crease (the top surface of the leg at the hip crease) below the top of the knee. The lifter then returns to an erect position. At the referee's command the bar is returned to the rack and the lift is completed. *After removing the bar from the racks while facing the front of the platform, the lifter may move forward or backward to establish the lifting position. The top of the bar not more than 3 cm below the top of the anterior deltoids. The bar shall be held horizontally across the shoulders with the hands and/or fingers gripping the bar, and the feet flat upon the platform with the knees locked. *The lifter shall wait in this position for the head referee's signal. The signal will be given as soon as the lifter is set and demonstrates control with the bar properly positioned. The head referee's signal shall consist of a downward movement of the arm and audible command \\"Squat\\". *Upon receiving the head referee's signal, the lifter must bend the knees and lower the body until the top surface of the legs at the hip joint is lower than the top of knees. *The lifter must recover at will, without double bouncing, to an upright position with the knees locked. The bar may stop, but there must be no downward motion during recovery. As soon as the lifter demonstrates a controlled final position, the head referee will give the signal indicating completion of the lift and to replace the bar. *The signal to replace the bar will consist of a backward motion of the arm and the audible command \\"Rack\\". The lifter must then make a reasonable attempt to return the bar to the racks. *The lifter shall face the front of the platform, towards the head referee. *The lifter shall not hold the collars or discs at any time during the performance of the lift. However, the edge of the hands gripping the bar may be in contact with the inner surface of the collar. *Not more than five and not less than two loaders/spotters shall be on the platform at any time. *The lifter may enlist the help of spotters in removing the bar from the racks; however, once the bar has cleared the racks, the spotters shall not physically assist the lifter with regards to actually getting into the proper set position. The spotters may assist the lifter to maintain control should the lifter stumble or demonstrate any evident instability. *The lifter will be allowed only one commencement signal per attempt. *The lifter may be given an additional attempt at the same weight at the head referee's discretion if failure in an attempt was due to any error by one or more of the spotters.  Causes for disqualification  *Failure to observe the head referee's signals at the commencement or completion of a lift. *Double bouncing or more than one recovery attempt at the bottom of the lift. *Failure to assume an upright position with knees locked at the commencement and completion of the lift. *Movement of the feet laterally, backward or forward that would constitute a step or stumble. *Failure to bend the knees and lower the body until the surface of the legs at the hip joint is lower than the tops of the knees. *Any resetting of the feet after the squat signal. *Contact with the bar by the spotters between the referee's signals. *Contact of elbows or upper arms with the legs. *Failure to make a reasonable attempt to return the bar to the racks. *Any intentional dropping or dumping of the bar. = Bench press = With his or her back resting on the bench, the lifter takes the loaded bar at arm's length. The lifter lowers the bar to the chest. When the bar becomes motionless on the chest, the referee gives a press command. Then the referee will call 'Rack' and the lift is completed as the weight is returned to the rack. *The front of the bench must be placed on the platform facing the head referee. *The lifter must lie backward with shoulders and buttocks in contact with the flat bench surface. The lifter's shoes or toes must be in solid contact with the platform or surface. The position of the head is optional. *To achieve firm footing, a lifter of any height may use discs or blocks to build up the surface of the platform. Whichever method is chosen, the shoes must be in a solid contact with the surface. If blocks are used, they shall not exceed 45 cm x 45 cm. *Not more than five and not less than two loaders/spotters shall be in attendance. The lifter may enlist the help of one or more of the designated spotters or enlist a personal spotter in removing the bar from the racks. Only designated spotters may remain on the platform during the lift. The lift off must be to arm's length and not down to the chest. A designated spotter, having provided a centre lift off, must immediately clear the area in front of the head referee and move to either side of the bar. If the personal spotter does not immediately leave the platform area and/or in any way distracts or impedes the head referees' responsibilities, the referees may determine that the lift is unacceptable, and be declared \\"no lift\\" by the referees and given three red lights. *The spacing of the hands shall not exceed 81 cm, measured between the forefingers. The bar shall have circumferential machine markings or tape indicating this maximum grip allowance. If the lifter should use an offset or unequal grip on the bar, whereby one hand is placed outside the marking or tape, it is the lifters responsibility to explain this to the head referee, and allow inspection of the intended grip prior to making an attempt. If this is not done until the lifter is on the platform for an official attempt, any necessary explanation and/or measurements will be done on the lifter's time for that attempt. The reverse or underhand grip is forbidden, as is a thumbless grip. *After receiving the bar at arm's length, the lifter shall lower the bar to the chest and await the head referees' signal. *The signal shall be an audible command \\"Press\\" and given as soon as the bar is motionless on the chest. As long as the bar is not so low that it touches the lifter's belt, it is acceptable. *The lifter will be allowed only one commencement signal per attempt. *After the signal to commence the lift has been given, the bar is pressed upward. The bar shall not be allowed to sink into the chest or move downwards prior to the lifter's attempt to press upward. The lifter will press the bar to straight arm's length and hold motionless until the audible command \\"Rack\\" is given. Bar may move horizontally and may stop during the ascent, but may not move downward towards the chest.  Causes for disqualification  *Failure to observe the referee's signals at the commencement or completion of the lift. *Any change in the elected position that results in the buttocks breaking contact with the bench or lateral movement of the hands (between the referee's signals). Any excessive movement or change of contact of the feet during the lift proper. *Allowing the bar to sink into the chest after receiving the referee's signal. *Pronounced uneven extension of the arms during or at the completion of the lift. *Any downward motion of the bar during the course of being pressed out. *Contact with the bar by the spotters between the referee's signals. *Any contact of the lifter's shoes with the bench or its supports. *Deliberate contact between the bar and the bar rest uprights during the lift to assist the completion of the press. *It is the responsibility of the lifter to inform any personally enlisted spotters to leave the platform as soon as the bar is secured at arm's length. Such spotters shall not return to the platform upon completion or failure of the attempt. It is especially important for a spotter providing a centre lift off to leave the platform quickly so as not to impair the head referee's view. Failure of any personal spotters to leave the platform may cause disqualification of the lift. = Deadlift = In the deadlift the athlete grasps the loaded bar which is resting on the platform floor. The lifter pulls the weights off the floor and assumes an erect position. The knees must be locked and the shoulders back, with the weight held in the lifter's grip. At the referee's command the bar will be returned to the floor under the control of the lifter. *The bar must be laid horizontally in front of the lifter's feet, gripped with an optional grip in both hands, and lifted until the lifter is standing erect. The bar may stop but there must be no downward motion of the bar. *The lifter shall face the front of the platform. *On completion of the lift, the knees shall be locked in a straight position and the lifter shall be standing erect. *The head referee's signal shall consist of a downward movement of the arm and the audible command \\"Down\\". The signal will not be given until the bar is held motionless and the lifter is in an apparent finished position. *Any raising of the bar or any deliberate attempt to do so will count as an attempt.  Causes for disqualification  * Any downward motion of the bar before it reaches the final position. * Failure to stand erect. * Failure to lock the knees straight at the completion of the lift. * Supporting the bar on the thighs during the performance of the lift. 'Supporting' is defined as a body position adopted by the lifter that could not be maintained without the counterbalance of the weight being lifted. * Movement of the feet laterally, backward or forward that would constitute a step or stumble. * Lowering the bar before receiving the head referee's signal. * Allowing the bar to return to the platform without maintaining control with both hands.  Training  Powerlifters practice weight training to improve performance in the three competitive lifts‚Äîthe squat, bench press and deadlift. Weight training routines used in powerlifting are extremely varied. For example, some methods call for the use of many variations on the contest lifts, while others call for a more limited selection of exercises and an emphasis on mastering the contest lifts through repetition. While many powerlifting routines invoke principles of sports science, such as specific adaptation to imposed demand (SAID principle), there is some controversy around the scientific foundations of particular training methods, as exemplified by the debate over the merits of \\"speed work,\\" or training to attain maximum acceleration of submaximal weights. Powerlifting training differs from bodybuilding and weightlifting, with less focus on volume and hypertrophy than bodybuilding and less focus on power generation than weightlifting. In addition to weight training, powerlifters may pursue other forms of training to improve their performance. For example, aerobic exercise may be used to improve endurance during drawn-out competitions and support recovery from weight training sessions. Another method used to increase strength in powerlifting is training with rubber bands and chains. Both bands and chains serve the same purpose. They provide variable load for the muscles and help to utilize even pressure throughout the whole amplitude of the exercise. As a supplement to regular routine, powerlifting chains can be used in any of three basic competitive lifts. Common set & rep schemes are based on a percentage of the lifter's 1RM (one rep maximum‚Äîmeaning the most weight they are capable of lifting one time). For example, 5 sets of 5 reps (5x5) at 75% of the 1RM. Rest periods between sets range from 2‚Äì5 minutes based on the lifter's ability to recover fully for the next set. Accessory movements are used to complement the competition lifts. Common accessory movements in powerlifting include bent over row, good mornings, pull ups and dips.  Federations  Prominent international federations include: * World RAW Powerlifting Federation (WRPF) * 100% Raw Powerlifting Federation * Global Powerlifting Committee (GPC) * Global Powerlifting Federation (GPF) * International Powerlifting Federation (IPF) * International Powerlifting League (IPL) * Xtreme Powerlifting Coalition (XPC) * Natural Athlete Strength Association (NASA) * World Drug-Free Powerlifting Federation (WDFPF) * World Natural Powerlifting Federation (WNPF) * World Powerlifting Alliance (WPA) (Founded 1987) * World Powerlifting Congress (WPC) * World Powerlifting Federation (WPF) * World United Amateur Powerlifting (WUAP) Of these federations, the oldest and most prominent is the IPF. It comprises federations from over 100 countries located on six continents. The IPF is the federation responsible for coordinating participation in the World Games, an international event affiliated with the International Olympic Committee. The IPF has many affiliates, one of these being USAPL. Specifically, the USAPL regulates all ages of lifters from the high school level to ages 40+ within the United States. The next-oldest federation is the WPC, formed as the international companion to the APF after its split from the USPF. Different federations have different rules and different interpretations of the rules, leading to a myriad of variations. Differences arise on the equipment eligible, clothing, drug testing and aspects of allowable technique. The 100% Raw Federation allows no supportive gear to be worn by the lifter while the IPF, AAU, NASA, USAPL and the ADFPF only allow a single-ply tight polyester squat suit, deadlift suit and bench shirt, wraps for knees and wrists, and a belt in the equipped divisions. Other federations, such as the APF, APA, IPA, SPF, WPC, AWPC and WPO, allow opened or closed back bench shirts, multi-ply gear, and a wide array of gear materials such as canvas, denim, polyester etc. The USPA was founded in 2010 by Steve Denison based on a lifter friendly environment. It's explosive growth (holding over 225 competitions each year worldwide) has been attributed to a strict adherence to the rules, without the politics. Both the USPA, and the IPL (International Powerlifting League) now rank among the largest, and most respected Organizations in both the US, and World, in the sport of powerlifting. The IPF has suspended entire member nations' federations, including the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Iran, India and Uzbekistan, for repeated violations of the IPF's anti-doping policies. However Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan did not serve their full suspension. In January 2019, USA Powerlifting updated their policy to exclude transgender participation in accordance to IOC guidelines.  Rank and classification  There are several classifications in powerlifting determining rank. These typically include Elite, Master, Class I,II,III,IV. The Elite standard is considered to be within the top 1% of competing powerlifters. Several standards exist, including the United States Powerlifting Association classifications, the IPF/USAPL (single-ply) classifications, the APF (multi-ply) classifications, and the Anti-Drug Athletes United (ADAU, raw) classifications. Countries in the former Soviet Union use a somewhat different nomenclature for the top classes, distinguishing among Masters of sport, International Class; Masters of Sport; and Candidates for Master of Sport. The Master classification should not be confused with the Master age division, which refers to athletes who are at least 40 years old.  American high schools  In the United States, powerlifting is not a popular sport in schools, although relatively more popular in the South and in the Upper Midwest. Texas, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Louisiana and Ohio have the most successful programs.  Gyms  Powerlifting gyms range from commercial fitness centers to private clubs. Some gyms gain fame due to their association with a training methodology (e.g., Westside Barbell), federation (e.g., Lexen Xtreme and the Xtreme Power Coalition [XPC]), or publication (e.g., SuperTraining Gym and Power magazine). Other gyms are notable for their association with champion powerlifters, for example Quads Gym and Ed Coan. Other notable powerlifters operate their own gyms, such as Scot Mendelson's F.I.T., Dan Green's Boss Barbell and ≈Ωydr≈´nas Savickas.

The Cottman stellar system Bradley describes Cottman's Star as a red giant, around which seven planets orbit. CottmanIV, known to its inhabitants as Darkover, is the only habitable planet. The three inner planets and two outer planets are not habitable. CottmanV is an ice planet that while not toxic to humans, cannot naturally support a self-sustaining human population.Rediscovery, Marion Zimmer Bradley and Mercedes Lackey, DAW Books, 1993, hardback Like Cottman V, Darkover is a planet stuck in a permanent ice age. Only one small equatorial strip of its single smallish continent is warm enough to support limited agriculture, fishing, and livestock. Similar in size to Earth, Darkover has a lower gravity due to its relative lack of metals; it also has a higher percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere. The planet's period of rotation is 28 hours (Star of Danger, Chapter 2). One Darkover year is roughly equal to fifteen Earth months. Darkover weather and geography Darkover's weather is affected by two major forces: *A huge mountain range called \\"The Wall Around the World\\" which reaches a height of 9,000 meters above sea level. This mountain range has the cooling effect of a third pole and has set the angle of Darkover's axis of rotation to be more extreme than that of Earth's which causes an extreme fluctuation between summer and winter temperatures in its equatorial region. *Unlike the Earth, which has only one natural satellite, Darkover has four moons, each a different color, which affect tidal forces and weather patterns. These are Liriel, Kyrrdis, Idriel, and Mormallor. It is thought that Mormallor may have been a passing asteroid that was captured by Darkover's gravity. Larger detailed version) The planet is dominated by polar icecaps and glaciers that cover most of its surface. The habitable area, just a few degrees north of the equator, joins the northern polar icecap on its northern and eastern side. Glaciers and impassible mountains (The Wall Around the World) prevent travel outside of the habitable lands. Darkover's nominally temperate continental zone, which borders the open water of the planet's ocean, is nevertheless subject to severe winter weather, and a warm day in summer is rare. The temperate portion of the continent is dominated by evergreen forests that grow in the mountain foothills. These trees contain a flammable resin which contributes to frequent forest fires during the warmer months. Further, southwest from the forests are Darkover's highlands, plains, salt marshes and arable river valleys. On the continent's far western side is another mountain range called \\"The Hellers\\" and a high elevation cold desert plateau called \\"The Dry Towns\\". Multiple conflicting attempts have been made at producing a map of Darkover. There was a map in The Heritage of Hastur (1975) that Bradley repudiated in a fan newsletter in 1978, saying, \\"The map in HH was fortunately inaccurate enough to be ignored.\\"Darkover, https://fanlore.org/wiki/Darkover, section \\"Mapping Darkover\\" In any event, it does not match the Speakman map that illustrates this article. Thorsten Renk's attempt at mapping Darkover based on the descriptions of journeys provided in several of the books (starting with Darkover Landfall and ending with The Heritage of Hastur) produced a third map that does not match the others. Renk is probably correct when he says that Bradley appears to have a mental model when she writes, but not a map in the ordinary sense.Renk, Thorsten, Mapping Darkover, http://www.phy.duke.edu/~trenk/darkover/darkover_map.html#mental_map Some cities or locations on the map are associated with the seven Domains: Hastur with the Hasturs; Armida with the Altons; Ardais with the Ardais; Serrais with the Ridenow; and Aldaran with the Aldarans. In Traitor's Sun, Chapter 3, the Domain of Elhalyn is described as stretching \\"from the west side of the Lake of Hali to the Sea of Dalereuth\\"; this is not on the map, nor is the Aillard Domain. Other names on the map are Towers: Hali, where the Tower was destroyed, but its burnt rubble and a small chapel, the Rhu Fead, remain; Arilinn; Dalereuth; and Neskaya. Thendara is the location of the Comyn Castle and its Tower, which was destroyed in Exile's Song, as well as the main Terran spaceport and administrative offices. Another Terran spaceport is at Caer Donn. Nevarsin is a retreat and a center of learning administered by the monks of St. Valentine of the Snows, a monastery founded by Father Valentine following a tragic event in Darkover Landfall. Storn is a castle (located on Storn Heights) and the Storn family was important in Stormqueen! and The Winds of Darkover. Shainsa is the chief of the Dry Towns and figures significantly in The Shattered Chain. The name Neskaya is derived from \\"New Skye,\\" the first settlement, near the place where the original colonizing ship crashed. Geology Darkover is poor in metals. Gold and silver are known but not in any quantity, and the most valuable metal is copper. Wealthy women have \\"butterfly clasps\\" for their hair made of copper; poorer women must make do with something fashioned of leather and wood. Iron is more common, but very valuable because it is used for swords and horseshoes. In City of Sorcery, Chapter 1, a man locks up his market stall, and the yet unnamed narrator, a Terran woman in Darkovan clothing, thinks he is prosperous, because \\"He can afford a Terran metal lock.\\" Since some men carry swords, and most men and many women carry knives, presumably made of iron, this seems to be somewhat contradictory. Perhaps it is the Terran craftsmanship and technology, not the metal, that makes the lock valuable. In The Bloody Sun. Chapter 9, the matrix workers at Ariliin agree to do a geological survey using their powers, to forestall a survey that otherwise would be done by the Terrans. They are to search for \\"tin, copper, silver, iron, tungsten\\" and for \\"fuels, for sulfur, hydrocarbons, chemicals[.]\\" The purpose is to prevent Terrans and their \\"infernal machines\\" from spreading across Darkover. They succeed in locating mineral deposits and marking them on maps (ironically, maps created using the assistance of Terran surveys), but the effort, at first successful, is abandoned. The most important mineral on Darkover is the matrix stone or starstone, a jewel that the first colonists discover in Darkover Landfall. It has a deep blue color, and large ones are rare. Its composition is not known by anyone, and in fact it is theorized by some that it is a form of life. This jewel provides a focus and a way to magnify laran. Native sapient Darkover species Bradley's fictional world is populated with an intelligent species, the Chieri, already ancient and in decline when the human colonists arrive. As the series developed, she introduced three other sapient native species‚Äîthe Trailmen, Forge-Folk, and Catmen‚Äîas well as two genetically engineered sapient species‚Äîthe Cralmac and Kyrri. One additional species is also frequently mentioned, the Ya-men, but Bradley leaves ambiguous the question of whether these creatures are sapient or not. =Catmen= The Catmen are the primary antagonists in The Spell Sword and feature in a number of the short stories. In The Spell Sword, Bradley describes them as carrying short, curved swords, capable of coordinating attacks against the humans, and able to use laran and starstones. The Catmen also featured prominently in several of the short stories, including David Heydt's I'm a Big Cat Now from Towers of Darkover; Linda Frankel and Paula Crunk's Blood Hunt from The Other Side of the Mirror; and Judith Sampson's To Serve Kihar from Domains of Darkover. =Chieri= The Chieri are a race of six-fingered, tall, telepathic humanoids who have no permanent gender.The Planet Savers, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Ace Books, 1962, paperback Extremely long-lived, with life-spans reaching into the tens of thousands of years, they are described as gray or golden-eyed and with long, silvery-white hair. They will change sexes as the situation warrants for mating purposes. The World Wreckers describes the Chieri as the last, dying remnants of a space-traveling people whose abilities have dwindled with their fertility and ambition.The World Wreckers, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Ace Books, 1971, paperback Chieri and humans are similar biologically and are able to interbreed. These hybrids exhibit some of the Chieri characteristics of coloring and physiology. They also have psychic gifts, and their descendants become the Comyn. In Star of Danger, the Chieri who aids Kennard Alton and Larry Montray, tells them that the Chieri share common ancestors with the Trailmen and the Kyrri, though not with the Terrans.Star of Danger, Marion Zimmer Bradley, pgs 201-209, Ace Books, 1965, paperback The Chieri feature prominently in The World Wreckers, The Planet Savers, Star of Danger, and in the long-lived, half-human/half-Chieri characters, Robert Kadarin and Thyra Scott, who appear in The Heritage of Hastur and Sharra's Exile. =Cralmac= The Cralmac are semi-intelligent beings, artificially bred by humans during the Ages of Chaos, from Trailmen altered with human DNA.Victory's Cost, Patricia B. Cirone, Towers of Darkover, pgs 103-106, edited by Marion Zimmer Bradley, DAW Books, 1993, paperback They usually feature in the Darkovan novels as the servants of laranzu'in working in the towers, with the explanation that theirs is the only touch humans in the hyper-sensitive state of the matrix worker can bear. The Cralmac feature prominently in Patricia B. Cirone's Victory's Cost from Towers of Darkover. =Forge-Folk= The Forge- Folk are not particularly well defined, though they are described as about the same height and build as the Trailmen. Walter Breen's The Darkover Concordance describes them as a cross between humans and non-humans, who speak an ancient variant of the Hellers dialect.Breen, Walter; The Darkover Concordance pg 49, Pennyfarthing Press, 1979, trade paperback They are Darkover's primary miners and metalworkers. The Forge Folk worship the Sharra matrix, and appear to be the only creatures on Darkover capable of handling Sharra without causing catastrophe. The Forge-Folk feature prominently in the conclusion of The Winds of Darkover, and are mentioned in several of the Sharra stories. =Kyrri= The Kyrri are humanoid bipeds with grey or silver fur, simian faces and glowing green (or dark) eyes. Perhaps they are the result of genetic engineering during the Ages of Chaos, or they may be a native species from the pre-history of Darkover. In Sharra's Exile, Book Two, Chapter 5, Regis Hastur speculates that even tower workers do not know the origins of the Kyrri. Kyrri generate a bioelectric field and sometimes give painful but non-lethal electric shocks when excited or threatened. The Kyrri appear in The Bloody Sun, Star of Danger, and The Sword of Aldones, and also in Sharra's Exile, the replacement for the latter book. They are used primarily as servants in the Towers because they can pass through the barriers that non-telepathic humans cannot. In The Bloody Sun, one is a servant in the Alton townhouse in Thendara.Breen, Walter; The Darkover Concordance, pg 74, Pennyfarthing Press, 1979, trade paperback Although the Kyrri can understand human speech, they do not speak themselves, and in Sharra's Exile Regis Hastur wonders how the message he gave one would be delivered. =Trailmen= The Trailmen are described as social herbivores who dwell in arboreal communities and live in extended family clans. Unattached females form bands of ronin who wander the forests attacking travelers. These Trailmen-human cause the cross-species transmission of a 48-year cyclic illness known as Trailmen's Fever, which is mild in Trailmen and often fatal in humans. The Chieri call the Trailmen a word that means \\"The Little Brothers Who Are Not Wise.\\" The Trailmen feature prominently in the novels, The Planet Savers and Star of Danger, and in Diana L. Paxson's short story, The Place Between, from Snows of Darkover. =Ya- men= The Ya-men are a mountain-dwelling bird-like race, of questionable intelligence, who are susceptible to the effects of \\"ghost winds\\".Vai Dom, Diana L. Paxson, The Keeper's Price, DAW Books, 1980, paperbackBreen, Walter; The Darkover Concordance, pg 139, Pennyfarthing Press, 1979, trade paperback Though they are mentioned as a background element in many of the books, the Ya-men are a critical plot element in Two to Conquer, The Winds of Darkover, and Cynthia McQuillin's The Forest from The Keeper's Price. In A Darkover Retrospective, Bradley says, \\"...I have no idea what the Ya-Men were ‚Äî or are ‚Äî like. I only know that they are very terrible indeed, with plumes and talons and shrill yelping cries...\\" This is a conscious decision; she thinks that monsters should not be described in too much detail, lest they lose their horror.Marion Zimmer Bradley (1980), \\"A Darkover Retrospective\\", The Marion Zimmer Bradley Literary Works Trust, San Francisco. Online at http://www.mzbworks.com/Darkover-Retrospective.htm Humans =The Comyn= Comyn is the term used for aristocratic members of Darkover society who are gifted with the psychic abilities commonly called laran. Comyn women may be referred to as Comynara, especially by commoners. The Comyn are the surviving laran-gifted families of Darkover who are ruling at the time of recontact with the Terran Empire. It is suggested in Darkover Landfall that they are the descendants of human-chieri pairings, who have learned to use native matrix stones to focus their laran powers. The Comyn, however, have their own mythology, recited in the Ballad of Hastur and Cassilda: they are the descendants of Hastur, son of Aldones, Lord of Light, who fell to earth, fell in love with Cassilda, and (perhaps) became mortal. Cassilda bore Hastur seven sons who founded the seven Domains. Each Comyn family controls part of Darkover's landmass, known as a Domain, but strategic inter-marriage and feudal land issues result in fluctuating domain borders. Each Comyn family has a gift ‚Äî a family-specific laran power, though in reality, not every member of the family has the family gift. Also, a member of a family may have another family's gift, in whole or in part. The gifts may skip generations. Of particular note is that twins often have differing amounts of the family gifts. One twin usually has more of the gifts than does the other twin. Walter Breen cites Christopher Gibson for the observation that comyn is derived from the Gaelic word, comhionnan, meaning equal, and appears to refer to the communal origins of Darkover. A Comyn family frequently fosters a child from another Comyn family, at least for a few years. This results in a Comyn adult having \\"foster-brothers\\" and \\"foster-sisters.\\" One example of this is Regis Hastur and Lew Alton. Regis lived at Armida during part of his childhood. The Comyn families are: Hastur of Hastur * Gift: Living matrix * Device: A silver tree on a blue background * Colors: Blue and silver * Other names associated with this domain: Di Asturien, Syrtis Hastur of Elhalyn * Gift: Ability to see all possible outcomes from every decision or choice. This gift can be very useful if it can be controlled. It awakens in Regis Hastur in The Planet Savers and he nearly goes mad. * Device: A crowned silver tree on a blue background * Colors: Blue and silver * The old line of Elhalyn died out, and the Hastur domain divided to re-establish it (The Forbidden Tower, Chapter 18). Alton * Gift: Ability to force rapport; \\"command voice\\" to force a person to obey * Device: An eagle perched upon a tor * Colors: Green and black * Other names associated with this domain: Castamir, Lanart, Leynier Ardais * Gift: Catalyst telepathy (awakens laran that is latent in a person, who may not realize that he has it) * Device: A hawk (The Forbidden Tower, Chapter 18). * Colors: Black and silver * Pronunciation: In Thendara House, Jaelle says the name is pronounced are-dayze (pg 96) Aillard * Gift: Never mentioned in any of Bradley's novels and short stories, except that it manifests only in women. In the Clingfire Trilogy, it is mentioned that Aillard males capitalized on their recessive Aillard Gift, making them better Keepers in a working circle of telepaths. According to The Darkover Concordance, the Aillard gift is extinct. * Device: Red and grey feathers (The Forbidden Tower, Chapter 18). * Colors: Red and grey * Other names associated with this domain: Lindir * The leadership or rule of this domain runs in the female line. * Pronunciation: Ale-lard, with a long \\"A\\" in the first syllable and the accent on the second.Breen, Walter; The Darkover Concordance\\", pg 1, Pennyfarthing Press, 1979, trade paperback Aldaran * Gift: Ability to see into the future, sometimes to see multiple future possibilities; weather forecasting and ability to change the weather or control winds. * Device: A two-headed eagle * Colors: Red and black * Other names associated with this domain: Darriell, Delleray, Hammerfell, MacAran, Rockraven, Scathfell, Storn * Notable for: Aldaran is not a formal member of the Comyn Council, because they never ratified the Compact, and were the first domain to interact with the Terrans. In the early Ages of Chaos, Aldaran was responsible for The Cataclysm, the destruction of the original Hali tower using a laran weapon that created the heavier-than-air, cloud-filled, Hali Lake.A Flame at Hali, Marion Zimmer Bradley and Deborah J. Ross, DAW Books, paperback Ridenow of Serrais * Gift: Empathy and the ability to sense and communicate with non-human intelligences * Colors: Green and gold * Notable for: During the Ages of Chaos, Serrais was overrun by a Dry Town clan, the Ridenow, who intermarried with the Serrais women (probably against their will). This rejuvenated the strain, and allowed the Serrais gift to survive in the Ridenow bloodline.Marion Zimmer Bradley, Stormqueen!, pg 167, DAW Books, 1978, paperback =Commoners= Commoners are the population of Darkover that are not members of a Comyn clan or family. In general, they are portrayed as less educated than the Comyn, hard-working, shrewd and honorable, although some are members of bandit gangs. Some of them are fairly wealthy, owning lands and raising crops or animals, or having successful businesses, such as tailoring and dressmaking, leatherworking and other crafts, milling and cheesemaking, or inn-keeping. They form their own councils and petition the Comyn for changes in policy or for assistance. In The Bloody Sun, Chapter 9, a group of Darkovans calling themselves the Pan- Darkovan Syndicate meets with Danvan Hastur and the members of the Arilinn Tower, and raises objections to the decision of the Comyn to limit trade and imports from the Terran Empire. Their spokesperson, Valdrin of Carthon, says they want some of the advantages that come with being a part of the Empire. Hastur states that the decision of the Comyn was to preserve the Darkovan way of life and not become another satellite state of the Empire. Valdrin counters that Terran technology needs to be adopted since Darkover's matrix technology has been declining and Terran technology can replace it, or Darkover might sink into another Age of Chaos. This is a major plot point, as Arilinn Tower then engages to do a mining survey faster and better than the Terrans. =The Renunciates= In the introduction to Free Amazons of Darkover, Bradley wrote that her Renunciates have become \\"the most attractive and controversial of my creations.\\" The Guild of Oath-Bound Renunciates, called Free Amazons and com'hi letzii in earlier books, are women who have opted out of Darkover's traditional gender-based roles, including marriage, obligations to clan, and the expectation of male protection.The Oath of the Free Amazons, pgs 16-22, Walter Breen, Free Amazons of Darkover, DAW Books, 1985, paperback In later books, \\"Free Amazons\\" is considered to be a misnomer and insulting or opprobrious, but the Renunciates themselves are tolerant of those who use \\"Free Amazons\\" out of ignorance. The origins of this guild during the Hundred Kingdoms era are described in Two to Conquer as the merger between the Sisterhood of the Sword, a military-mercenary guild, and the Priestesses of Avarra, a cloistered order that offered medical and other care to women, primarily abused women. Towards the end of Two to Conquer, Carlina di Asturien comes to believe that the two guilds need to work together for the benefit of all women on Darkover. Bradley acknowledged a Patricia Matthews fan story as the origin of the Sisterhood of the Sword, and described the Priesthood of Avarra as a counterforce.Introduction: About Amazons, pgs 7-14, Free Amazons of Darkover, Marion Zimmer Bradley, DAW Books, 1985, paperback Bradley noted that most of the fan fiction she received was inspired by the Renunciates, and that she had met individuals who had taken Renunciate-style names or were attempting to live in women's communes inspired by the Renunciate guildhouses. A Renunciate takes an oath, and thereafter is known only by her first name and the name of her mother, with the connecting word \\"n'ha\\", meaning \\"daughter of.\\" The woman who administers the oath is called her \\"oath-mother.\\" Magdalene Lorne takes the name Margali n'ha Ysabet: Margali is a Darkovan version of her Terran name, Magdalene (she is also called Magda), and her mother's name was Elizabeth. Camilla, born Elorie Lindir, takes the name Camilla n'ha Kyria, because her mother was Kyria Aillard. Had she been legitimate or acknowledged as nedestro, her name might have been Elorie Hastur. Laran Laran is the Darkovan word for telepathic talent and the talents associated with it: telekinesis, precognition, a \\"sixth sense\\", empathy, teleportation, and others. It is the distinguishing feature of the people of Darkover. Although it appears mostly in Comyn, others may have it. It appears mostly in people who have red hair, and generally manifests itself at the time of puberty. Elorie Ardais, in The Bloody Sun, Chapter 7, says, \\"Everyone alive has some small degree of laran.\\" Damon Ridenow, in The Spell Sword, Chapter 6, reflects on the odd fact that Andrew Carr, a Terran, has laran, and can telepathically be in touch with Callista when he and Callista's twin sister cannot: > In the telepath caste, it was often the accident of possessing laran, the > specific telepath Gift, which determined how close a relationship would > come. Caste, family, social position, all these became irrelevant compared > to that one compelling fact; one had, or one did not, that inborn power, and > in consequence one was stranger or kinfolk. By that criterion alone, the > most important one on Darkover, Andrew Carr was one of them, and the fact > that he was an Earthman was a small random fact without any real importance. Being telepathically connected to another is called being \\"in rapport.\\" Elizabeth Mackintosh, a character in the novel Rediscovery, suggests the Darkovan language appears to be derived from old Terran languages. She proposes a genetic basis for the development of laran on Darkover, noting that the original population of the colony derived overwhelmingly from north-west Europe (the Scottish highlands, Ireland and the Basque country) where a belief in supernatural abilities such as the second sight is common, and red hair is common as well. =Matrix stones= A matrix jewel or \\"starstone\\" provides a focus and a way to magnify laran. In Darkover Landfall, a chieri gives one to his human lover so she can call on him if necessary. A matrix stone can be attuned to one person, who will always carry it with him and cannot lose it because he always knows where it is. If it is forcibly removed from him, he may go into shock and die. As related in The Bloody Sun, a small matrix stone can be attuned to a person and used as a lock on a box, and only the person to whom the matrix stone is attuned will be able to open the box. Most persons with laran have a matrix stone that they carry in a small bag or pouch made of silk or leather, which are \\"insulators.\\" Usually, the pouch is worn around the neck as a pendant. In general, the larger the stone, the more it can amplify the user's laran. Matrix stones can be used to power aircraft or make a person invisible (The Bloody Sun). Trained matrix mechanics can create a \\"screen\\" by placing several jewels within glass in a pattern that they determine on an ad hoc basis, depending on the purpose of the screen. This can magnify telepathic powers even more. A screen cannot be managed by a single matrix user. The geological survey conducted The Bloody Sun is accomplished by making and using such a screen; in Sharra's Exile and Two To Conquer, a screen is used to teleport a person from another star system. In Sharra's Exile, Book Two, Chapter 8, the Keeper Ashara explains that matrix mechanics, that is, the scientific use of laran amplified by matrix stones, is the first of the non- causal sciences. =Towers= The Towers are the centers of the use of laran and schools for those who are learning to use their laran. A designated person is always on duty (\\"in the relays\\") to exchange news and requests for help telepathically with other Towers. At least once, the Terrans wonder how news travels so fast on Darkover. Towers are, in theory, independent of any caste discrimination or political influence. Each Tower should have a Keeper, a person to direct both Tower policy and the power of the laran users when they gather together in rapport to work. The Keeper of Arilinn is considered the second most-powerful person on Darkover, after the Hastur regent. One who goes to a Tower for training advances through degrees of competence: first Monitor, then levels of Mechanic. Each degree requires an oath to do no harm and not abuse laran. First, a trainee learns to set up \\"barriers\\" to keep his thoughts from being read against his will, and to keep from \\"broadcasting\\" his thoughts and feelings. The next stage of training involves learning how to read one's own physiological symptoms such as heartbeat, respiration and body temperature, and (with permission) to read those of others. Once the trainee is proficient at this, he is qualified to \\"monitor\\" other laran workers to ensure that they are not in danger when working, and takes the Monitor's Oath, with the approval of the members of the Tower. A person who is deemed morally or otherwise unfit to work with laran will not be allowed to take the oath and will be expelled from the tower without any more training. This apparently happened to Dyan Ardais. A matrix Mechanic learns to manipulate matter and energy using his laran and matrix stone, and to make and use tools that focus and augment laran. In The Bloody Sun Jeff Kerwin, just beginning his training as a mechanic, notices that the hinge on a door is beginning to rust, and, taking out his matrix, he stops it. Greater skill is required to perform tasks such as refining metals or causing rain to fight a forest fire. Despite all the things that can be done with laran, it is not wise to use it for everything; in The Bloody Sun Rannirl, a Level2 Mechanic, repairs a leaky roof at Arilinn by climbing onto the roof with materials and tools. The highest degree is Keeper, but generally women are trained for this arduous position from a young age. Not many young women want to undergo this. A Keeper is the center of a group of laran workers, who accepts the energy (\\"energons\\") that they generate and directs it. There are several Towers. In World Wreckers it is mentioned that there are nine Towers, but only seven Towers are ever named: Arilinn, Comyn Tower, Corandolis, Dalereuth, Hali, Neskaya, and Tramontana. Most of the named towers can be located. Arilinn tower is close to Arilinn town in the Plains of Arilinn across the Venza Hills from Thendara. Comyn tower is in Thendara. Dalereuth Tower is far south at the coast. Hali Tower was north of Thendara at the shore of Lake Hali. Neskaya Tower is in the south-eastern foothills of the Kilghard Hills. Tramontana tower is in the Hellers, about a day or more west of Aldaran. Journeys to Neskaya and Arilinn are described and they appear on the map. Only the location of Corandolis is never revealed. As the location of the other Towers are known and can be connected with a certain Domain, an educated guess about the location of Corandolis can be made; Elhalyn had Hali right at the lakeshore, Neskaya is less than a day from both Serrais and Armida, Tramontana is close to Caer Donn, Dalereuth is close to Valeron and thus serves Aillard, and both the Comyn Tower and Arilinn would be accessible from the various points of the Hastur Domain. Which leaves Ardais alone without access to a Tower, thus we can guess that Corandolis Tower is in the Hellers somewhere beyond Scaravel about a day from Ardais. Of the location of the remaining two unnamed Towers we have no knowledge. The importance of the Towers diminished after the Ages of Chaos and by the time the Terrans arrive, there were not enough trained telepaths for all of them to function, and in addition some of the independent Towers did not have a Keeper. Hali Tower was destroyed during the Ages of Chaos. So was Neskaya, but it was rebuilt. Comyn Tower, attached to Comyn Castle in Thendara, was for centuries the home of the Keeper Ashara. In The Spell Sword, Chapter 7, Damon Ridenow realizes that to supervise two untrained telepaths, Andrew Carr and Ellamir Lanart-Alton, he must function as a Keeper. For many years, perhaps not since Varzil the Good, men have not been Keepers. Damon's realization leads to the formation of The Forbidden Tower and eventually, a civil war among the Comyn. Afterwards, as related in The Bloody Sun, there are independent matrix workers, not attached to a Tower or a Domain. They perform various services, such as making the matrix locks described above. However, when Jeff Kerwin, possessing his mother's matrix, queries a pair of independent matrix workers about it, they refuse to tell him anything. =Threshold sickness= Some of the Comyn, as they enter puberty and their laran begins to awaken, have a bad reaction called \\"threshold sickness.\\" Symptoms are headache, disorientation, nausea, fever and a lack of desire for food. This is sometimes blamed on the breeding programs that fixed the laran Gifts in the Comyn families during the Ages of Chaos. In a severe case, the person may die. More frequently, the afflicted young man or woman must be confined and treated by an experienced laran worker until he or she recovers. Some Comyn have only a slight case of threshold sickness. Others, for example, Cleindori, have had telepathic abilities since they were children and are unaffected. =The Overworld= The Overworld is a laran representation of the real world. A person with laran, especially when using a matrix, can travel at great speeds in the Overworld and communicate as if face-to-face with others who are there. In The Spell Sword, Damon Ridenow searches for Callista Leynier, who is missing, in the Overworld, and encounters a part of the Overworld that is blocked off by a powerful laran presence. It seems likely that Callista is within the inaccessible area. In Exile's Song Marguerida Alton destroys the representation of Comyn Tower in the Overworld that Ashara has maintained for hundreds of years to stay alive. Later she learns that she has destroyed the real Comyn Tower, part of Comyn Castle, as well. In the Overworld, one may see sleepers dreaming or people wandering aimlessly and lost. When Cleindori (Dorilys Aillard) is a child, she joins a matrix circle of her relatives in the Overworld, and after they tell her that she is too young to be doing that, they ask, \\"How did you get here?\\" She replies that she has always been able to get here, and that she used to visit her baby sister here before she was born. The Overworld is where people, at least some people, go after death. In Exile's Song, Chapter 22, Marguerida Alton visits the Overworld again, and meets her mentor in musical studies, Ivor Davidson, who is deceased. He is listening to \\"the music of the spheres.\\" In The Forbidden Tower, Damon Ridenow explores \\"levels\\" of the Overworld, going back in time to try to discover lost secrets. He calls this \\"Timesearch.\\" He encounters Varzil the Good from the distant past, who greets him as a kinsman (they are both Ridenow) and warns him that what he is attempting is dangerous. =Cherilly's Law= This is the first law of matrix mechanics, mentioned in Sharra's Exile, Book Two, Chapter 8, and elsewhere. It states that everything in the universe has one and only one exact duplicate, somewhere in space and time, except a matrix stone. Only matrix stones are each wholly unique, and any attempt to duplicate a matrix will destroy it and the attempted duplicate. =Matrix weapons= In the Ages of Chaos and the Hundred Kingdoms, matrix workers, using screens to amplify their powers, devised powerful weapons of war. In The Forbidden Tower, Chapter 6, they are described as \\"-- fire-forms, and wind-creatures to tear down castles and whole walls, and creatures from other dimensions walking abroad in the land -- \\". Other matrix workers defended against these weapons. The Compact banned matrix weapons. Clingfire Clingfire is a liquid made by matrix workers that when set afire, keeps burning as long as there is some substance to burn. Clingfire will even burn stone. Evidently it is slowly exhausted or used up as it burns, because it does not simply burn all the way to the center of the planet. Arrows may be dipped in clingfire, ignited and shot, or containers of burning clingfire may be dropped from \\"aircars\\" (matrix-powered aerial vehicles). An attack of this nature by many aircars on Aldaran Castle in Stormqueen! was frustrated by Dorilys Aldaran, the titular stormqueen, who blasts them from the sky with lightning. A huge clingfire attack destroyed the Hali Tower, which led to the adoption of the Compact, which forbids the use of matrix weapons. Bonewater dust Bonewater dust is a substance, possibly radioactive, that is used to render a place uninhabitable for years. It is used against places that are especially hated or to deliver a dose of slow poison to an entire army. The Spell Sword In the novel The Spell Sword Damon Ridenow sets a small matrix stone into the hilt of a sword. He realizes that by doing so he may, in theory, be violating The Compact, and that such matrix weapons are banned. He discovers that although he is no use in actual battle, being a poor swordsman, he can use the sword as a weapon in the Overworld, and thereby assist the soldiers \\"on the ground.\\" Other swords, with larger matrices, are important weapons that figure in the novels. The Sword of Aldones In Sharra's Exile the Sword of Aldones is called the weapon against Sharra. It is kept in the rhu fead, a small chapel near the site of the destroyed Tower of Hali, and near the place where the Comyn have funerals and inter their own kind. The rhu fead is protected by a barrier that cannot be passed except by Comyn, but the sword itself is behind a barrier that no Comyn can pass. In Sharra's Exile, Lew Alton, with the help of Ashara and a few others, solves this puzzle. Lew is severely wounded by an attack after the sword is recovered, and is about to die when Regis Hastur arrives, more or less by chance, claims the sword and uses it to heal Lew, to the astonishment of the attending doctors. Lew then asks Regis who he is, and Regis says, \\"Hastur.\\" Hastur was the legendary son of Aldones. The Sword of Hastur This sword is said to be kept in Hastur Castle. It will slay anyone who draws it except in defense of the Hastur Domain. Sharra Sharra is an ancient matrix weapon. In the Winds of Darkover it is simply a large matrix stone, about the size of a child's hand. In The Heritage of Hastur it has been set into the hilt of a sword. Sharra is also called the \\"Form of Fire.\\" She is worshiped by the Forge-Folk. Bradley provides multiple explanations for Sharra. In The Sword of Aldones, Sharra is described as a powerful matrix in which an Alton leronis had become trapped eons ago. However, in the rewrite of that book, Sharra's Exile, Bradley describes Sharra as a portal to another dimension, though which a powerful alien energy is able to gain a foothold on Darkover. Breen describes Sharra as an anthropomorphized matrix weapon, left over from the Ages of Chaos.Breen, Walter; The Darkover Concordance, pg 116-118, Pennyfarthing Press, 1979, trade paperback Desideria Leynier, in The Winds of Darkover, uses the Sharra matrix against a group of bandits who have taken over Storn Heights. In The Heritage of Hastur, Marjorie Scott and Lew Alton, drugged and under the influence of Kadarin and Beltran Aldaran, raise the Form of Fire and destroy the Terran spaceport of Caer Donn. The Terrans then finally realize the meaning of the Compact, and its necessity. In The Winds of Darkover, Dan Barron, a Terran, has visions of Storn Heights, brought to him by a laran rapport with Brynat Storn. In Chapter 1, he sees Sharra: > In the midst of the flame there was a woman.... She was almost inhumanly > tall and slender, but girlish; she stood bathed in the flame as if standing > carelessly under a waterfall... She looked merry and smiling.... And then > the girlish, merry face wavered and became supernally beautiful with the > beauty of a great goddess burning endlessly in the fire, a kneeling woman > bound in golden chains.... Later: > [T]he figure changed, grew, and was, again, the great chained Being, regal, > burning, searing her beauty into his heart and brain. The ancient Keeper of Comyn Tower, Ashara, tries to explain Sharra to Lew Alton, who is, one might say, \\"possessed\\" by the Form of Fire after the events in The Heritage of Hastur. Ashara hints that Sharra is actually an extra- dimensional being and the Sharra matrix is used to summon her. She also hints at the reason the matrix was set into a sword: > \\"What do you think would happen to a person who was killed with such a > sword?\\" Culture Darkovan culture in the Domains is essentially feudal: the Comyn are the nobility and there is a king of Elhalyn lineage. Rarely, an Elhalyn is crowned king and rules, but usually the actual rule of the Domains is entrusted to the Hasturs, since the Elhalyns are considered \\"unstable.\\" Thus there is a Hastur regent and the ranking male of the Elhalyn domain is given respect but no real power. The seven Domains have lesser family names associated with them, as noted above. All other persons are \\"commoners\\" and even if they have laran they probably have no chance of social advancement, although they may obtain tower training and earn respect. =Language= There are two important languages on Darkover: Cahuenga, spoken generally by everyone, and Casta, usually only spoken by the nobility. There are mountain, lowland and regional accents and dialects. Sometimes Bradley attempts to reproduce a dialect with English contractions and spelling. For instance, in Hawkmistress!, Part 3, Chapter 5, Romilly, the protagonist, realizes \\"with horror\\" that her mountain accent has crept into her speech when she says, \\"...I'm nae servant to the lady; if ye' want her fetched and carried for, me lord, ye' can even do it yerself.\\" There are, in all, nine different languages on Darkover.Renk, Thorsten, \\"A brief analysis of casta and cahuenga\\", Duke University, [undated]. Online at http://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~trenk/darkover/casta.html Although Darkover is a richly realized and detailed world, the two languages are rarely distinguished in the books. They derive, ultimately, from the two languages spoken by the colonists, as described in Darkover Landfall: Celtic, spoken by the communal colonists, becomes Cahuenga, and Spanish, spoken by the officers and crew of the crashed ship, becomes Casta. The two tongues blend and borrow words from each other. Bradley was not as talented a linguist as Tolkien was, with the ability to invent entire languages and explain their imaginary origins (and indeed, who was?), but the basic vocabulary is quite consistent throughout the books. For much more information about the languages of Darkover, including a discussion of grammar, examples of translation and lists of words, see the essay by Thorsten Renk. =Laws and traditions= The Compact The Compact forbids any weapon that does not bring its user within reach of the person it is used against. Its intention is to forbid laran weapons, which caused much destruction and loss of life in the Ages of Chaos. The Compact is perhaps the most distinctive and important part of Darkovan society. It was conceived by Varzil the Good and adopted by all the Comyn, except the Aldarans. It ended the Ages of Chaos and the Hundred Kingdoms and brought peace. Because the Aldaran Domain never adopted it, they were excluded from the Comyn Council. The Compact also forbids guns, \\"blasters\\" and other Terran weapons, which is a plot point in several books. Swords and knives are the weapons allowed by the Compact. Even a bow and arrow is prohibited, although they can be used for hunting. Knife exchange ritual In The Winds of Darkover, Chapter 3, Lerrys, the foster-son of Valdir, Lord Alton, realizes that Dan Barron has some sort of telepathic ability and that he will have \\"troubles\\" on their journey into the mountains, since he has visions of Sharra. Dan has no knife, and Lerrys explains: > \\"By custom and law here -- a knife or any other weapon must never be lent or > given, except between sworn friends or kinfolk. To say 'my knife is yours' > is a pledge. It means you will defend the other...\\" Lerrys then gives Dan a knife, and says, \\"It is yours,\\" instructing Dan to take it and say, \\"Yours and mine.\\" Between Darkovan men, each of whom has a knife, the ritual words are said by both of them in turn as they trade knives. Several times in the books, men exchange knives and from that day forward are bredin, notably Regis Hastur and Danilo Syrtis in The Heritage of Hastur and Jeff Kerwin and Rannirl in The Bloody Sun. Renunciates also follow this custom. =Dress= In The Spell Sword, Andrew Carr arrives at Armida in clothes that are simply no good any more, as Damon Ridenow says. Carr has survived a plane crash and a blizzard with the help of Callista Leynier. Damon obtains the loan of \\"the hall-steward's holiday suit\\" for Andrew, which is: > \\"...a shirt and knee-length under-drawers of coarse linen; over which went > suedelike breeches, flared somewhat from knee to ankle; a long-sleeved > finely embroidered shirt with wide sleeves gathered in at the wrist; and a > leather jerkin. There were knitted stockings that tied at the knee, and over > them low felt boots lined with fur.\\" That outfit is indoor wear. Outdoor wear is described in The Winds of Darkover, when Dan Barron travels on horseback with three Darkovan men: > All three wore loose heavy breeches, falling in flaps over high, carefully- > fitted boots, and laced tunic-like shirts in rich, dark colors. Gwynn and > Colryn had thick, fur-lined riding-cloaks, and Lerrys a short loose fur > jacket with a hood. All three wore short gauntlets, knives in their belts > and smaller knives in pockets at the top of their boots; Gwynn had a sword > as well, although for riding it was swung across the crupper of his horse. > They all had hair cut smoothly below their ears and a variety of amulets and > jewelry. Men generally carry a sword if they can afford one, which is a weapon that complies with the Compact. Comyn families, unless extremely poor, can afford swords, and the male children are trained in sword-play from a young age. Whether they carry a sword or not, men usually carry a knife or two, as described above. In The Shattered Chain, Chapter 6, there is a detailed description of the dress of women. Writing of Magdalene Lorne, Bradley says: > She wore the ordinary dress of a woman of Thendara: a long, full skirt of > heavy cloth, woven in a tartan pattern, a high-necked and long-sleeved > tunic, embroidered at the neck, and ankle-high sandals of thin leather. Her > hair was long and dark, coiled low on her neck and fastened with the > butterfly-shaped clasp that every woman wore in the Domains. Magda's was > made of silver, a noblewoman would have worn copper, a poor woman's clasp > would have been carved of wood or even leather; but no chaste woman exposed > her bare neck in public. After hanging the clothes up, Magda rubs \\"their folds with an aromatic mix of spices; it was as important to smell right as to look right.\\" Magda wears a riding-cloak when she undertakes a journey into the Hellers. Renunciates who provide bodyguard services or lead expeditions generally wear a long knife, which by law and custom (established by Varzil the Good, who gave the Renunciates their charter) is not as long as a sword. Renunciates who are midwives or prepare food, etc. generally do not carry a weapon. Camilla n'ha Kyria is an exception. Before she became a Renunciate she posed as a man and lived as a mercenary, and she still wears a sword. Comyn women carry a small dagger for personal protection, or perhaps to use on themselves if they are captured and in danger of rape or some other humiliation. (The Shattered Chain, Chapter 2). =Relations between the sexes= The Shattered Chain has much information about sexual mores, traditions and prohibitions on Darkover. Also, repeatedly throughout the series, women's thoughts (seldom expressed aloud) are concerned with being \\"brood mares\\"; e. g. \\"I was of no value; the daughters I bore him at risk of my life were of no value; I was nothing but an instrument to give him sons.\\" (Kindra, speaking in The Shattered Chain, Chapter 2). In Darkover Landfall, it is made clear to the colonists by the ship's officers that for the colony to survive, the women must bear as many children as possible, with as many male partners as possible for genetic diversity. This led to women having an inferior social position to men. In Comyn society, a formal marriage is di catenas (evidently derived from Spanish \\"de cadenas\\", meaning \\"of chains\\"). In the ceremony, the married couple submit to locked wrist bracelets that are connected with a chain. Later the chain is removed but the symbolic wrist bracelets traditionally remain. In the Dry Towns, a woman remains chained all her life, but to herself. The \\"bracelets were connected with a long chain, passed through a metal loop on her belt, so that if the woman moved either hand, the other was drawn up tight against the loop on her waist.\\" (The Shattered Chain, Chapter 1). A less formal marriage is called \\"a marriage of freemates.\\" This is the typical form of marriage for lower classes, although the Comyn enter into freemate marriages as well. There may or may not be a ceremony of some kind, such as a feast. Renunciates are forbidden by their oath to enter into any other kind of marriage. This sort of marriage can be ended by mutual agreement, although it is not uncommon for it to last for the lives of the partners. In the Hellers, a freemate marriage may be established by mutual agreement and the sharing of \\"a bed, a meal, and a fireside.\\" Lew Alton and Marjorie Scott observe this tradition in The Heritage of Hastur. The culture of the Comyn tolerates homosexuality in men and women to some extent. The chieri, from whom the Comyn are descended, change from male to female, or vice versa, when it is appropriate to the individual. Some of the Comyn are permanently neither male nor female in a physical sense. In Sharra's Exile, Chapter 9, after Lew Alton meets his young daughter Marguerida, he learns from Rafael Scott that Thyra, Marguerida's mother: > was ... like the chieri. Emmasca; no one was really sure if she was boy or > girl. I can remember her like that, when I was very small, but only a > little. Then Kadarin came -- and very soon after, she began to wear women's > clothing and think of herself as a woman... that was when we began to call > her Thyra... before that, she had another name[.] The sex-changing chieri drive the plot of The World Wreckers to its conclusion. Bradley needed to deal with the issue of homosexuality to write the book. Bradley claimed that she was the first science fiction author to do this. Among commoners, male homosexuals are called embredin (evidently derived from bredin) or \\"sandal-wearers\\" (chaireth) to mock them or equate them with women. Female homosexuality is sometimes believed, even by Comyn, to be a characteristic of the Renunciates. In The Shattered Chain, Chapter 5, Lady Jerana Hastur says: > \\"...I have always heard that the Free Amazons are eager to find pretty young > girls whom they can convert to their unnatural way of life, turning them > against marriage and motherhood, making them haters of men and lovers of > women.\\" This may be an example of Bradley's ironic social commentary. Everyone except Jerana Hastur is offended by this speech. =Various customs and music= Darkovans celebrate midsummer and midwinter with gift-giving, feasting and dancing. As noted above, Darkover's weather has extremes. At Midwinter, travel may be impossible, but at Midsummer, there may be days without snow or rain when it is possible for people to gather together and have a celebration. A typical midsummer gift from a man to a woman is a basket of fruit and flowers, left anonymously at her door. A midwinter gift, when fruit and flowers are unavailable, may be candy and preserved food. Women sometimes leave gifts for men (especially spouses), and Renunciates give seasonal gifts to one another. Members of a family exchange gifts. At Comyn Castle in Thendara, there is an elaborate celebration on both holidays with tables of food and drink. There is organized social dancing: ring-dances, traditional dances by soloists, and dances with chosen partners. Music The ryll is mentioned many times. It is described as a small harp. It is apparently considered one of the few instruments, maybe the only one, that is suitable for women to play. There are larger harps, a sort of viol, and some wind instruments, but there are no mentions of women playing them. In Exile's Song, Chapter 3, Marguerida Alton is shown a ryll that (it is later revealed) belonged to her mother, Thyra. This ryll is played with \\"levers\\". Music-master Everard can only get a single chord from it, though, and says that none of his students have been able to play it. Marguerida is able to play it and she sings the ballad \\"The Outlaw\\" (\\"Edward\\"; see below), which Master Everard knows. Marguerida does not know where she learned the song and says that the harp is haunted. In the same chapter, Marguerida and her teacher observe that the sound holes of stringed Darkovan instruments are star-shaped (later called a \\"many-pointed star\\"), and Master Everard is interested to learn that Terrans make them in another shape. The drone-pipe is apparently similar to the bagpipe, and was used during battles to create a loud noise and frighten the enemy. At the time of Exile's Song no one on Earth (\\"Terra\\") knows how to play one, but there are still players on Darkover. Master Everard's collection of instruments also includes \\"fiols\\" of different sizes, apparently similar to a violin or viola, on which Marguerida plays some Bach and Mozart. He also has a collection of wooden flutes of some kind, and some horns made of metal, which are Terran products. Darkover is poor in metals, and constructing a metal musical instrument would be folly. (Exile's Song, Chapter 3.) In The Forbidden Tower, Chapter 7, Dom Esteban asks for some music after dinner, and his daughter Callista sings at Andrew Carr's request. She takes up a small harp (not stated to be a rryl) and begins: > How came this blood on your right hand > Brother, tell me, tell me ... which draws immediate protests from her twin sister Ellemir and Dezi (Desiderio Leynier). Dezi believes himself to be Esteban's son, not without reason, and it is considered very bad luck, or a deadly insult, for a woman to sing that song in her brother's hearing. Esteban ruthlessly says that no son of his is present and orders Callista to continue. We sat at feast, we fought in jest, Sister, I vow to thee, A berserk's rage came in my hand And I slew them shamefully. The song is a version of an ancient ballad, known by several names, including \\"Edward.\\" Dancing \\"Only men laugh, only men dance, only men weep.\\"‚ÄîLew Alton in Sharra's Exile. Evidently this is a proverbial expression. Dancing is an important part of Darkovan culture. In The Heritage of Hastur, Dyan Ardais performs a solo \\"sword dance\\" at the Midwinter (Midsummer?) Ball in Comyn Castle. In The World Wreckers, the chieri Keral, to celebrate her (formerly his) new love for David Hamilton, begins an ecstatic dance that draws in all the Telepathic Council; the result is that the plots of the World Wreckers are exposed, a person with telekinetic powers explodes a bomb that is intended to destroy the telepathic Darkovans at the cost of his life, and Andrea Closson, another chieri and one of the World Wreckers, vows to repair the damage she has done. =Religious traditions of Darkover= On the whole, the inhabitants of Darkover are not particularly religious and do not celebrate any obvious religious rituals. However, all the castles of the Domains, and Comyn Castle as well, have a \\"chapel\\" that has seating and murals (or statues) of the gods and goddesses. Also present are murals depicting scenes from \\"The Ballad of Hastur and Cassilda\\". Formal marriages (di catenas) may be conducted in the chapel, or a person may retreat to it for solitude and meditation. Darkovans believe in four deities: Avarra (goddess of birth and death), Evanda (goddess of life and warmth, and hence marriage), Aldones (lord of light), and Zandru (lord of the nine hells). Each of Zandru's hells is colder than the one above it, because Darkovans, living on a freezing planet, conceive of a cold hell. Hastur, the mythological progenitor of the Comyn, is supposedly the son of Aldones. In Thendara House and City of Sorcery Magdalen Lorne hears the \\"calling of crows,\\" a sign that Avarra is present. These entities are believed to have power in the world, but no particular interest in individual persons. However, at least one of them canonically exists: in The Shadow Matrix, Evanda is physically present, tends the fire and prepares food at the marriage of Mikhail and Marguerida. In Sharra's Exile, when Regis Hastur is fighting Sharra using the Sword of Aldones, a \\"damnable\\" face appears in the sky, presumably Aldones himself. The Forge-Folk worship the \\"form of fire\\", known as Sharra, who appears as a fiery, chained, red-haired female figure, a manifestation of the Sharra matrix, or perhaps a being from another dimension. Bradley offers multiple conflicting explanations for Darkover's native deities, perhaps deliberately leaving the answers open to interpretation. Some Darkovans also follow a Terran-originated belief system. These are the Cristoforos, whose beliefs derive from the work of a Catholic monk, Father Valentine, who accompanied the original expedition. Cristoforo is a corruption of St. Christopher of Centaurus, and the central figure of the belief system is the Bearer of Burdens.The Fall of Neskaya, Marion Zimmer Bradley, pg 55, DAW Books, 2001, paperback These two belief systems operate side by side. A Darkovan may believe in one or the other, or frequently both, without difficulty. Plants =Kireseth= Kireseth is a plant that produces blue bell-like flowers which when covered with pollen appear to be golden. The plants bloom when very warm weather lasts for more than a day or two, a rare weather event on Darkover. The kireseth flowers release large amounts of hallucinatory pollen, creating what is called a \\"ghost wind.\\" Humans and animals that inhale the pollen exhibit strange behavior, sexual activity, and violence. The original colonists had no knowledge of this plant or its effects. The first known ghost wind resulted in a human woman becoming impregnated by a chieri, an orgy, and a massacre. Later, the Darkovans learned to distill substances from parts of the kireseth plant to either enhance telepathic ability or inhibit it. Kireseth is important in the mythology of Darkover; the Blessed Cassilda, ancestor of the Comyn, is depicted in paintings as holding a bouquet of flowering kireseth. In The Forbidden Tower, Damon Ridenow and his circle fit together the mythological pieces and prove to themselves that a female Keeper need not be a virgin, or even chaste, to act as the center of a telepathic circle, if she uses kireseth. They are seen as rebels, and have to fight a telepathic battle to keep their circle and the \\"forbidden\\" tower they have created in the overworld. Their use of kireseth is viewed as blasphemy by many (ironically, since this use is portrayed in religious art) and when Damon's daughter, Cleindori (Dorilys Aillard) attempts to use this knowledge as the Keeper of Arilinn, a legitimate tower, she and her followers are hunted and killed. Cleindori means \\"Golden Bell\\" and is a nickname connoting her blonde hair with the appearance of the kireseth flower. =Resin Tree= The resin tree is found on the slopes of all the mountains surrounding the inhabited parts of Darkover and down into the lowlands. It is apparently a kind of evergreen conifer that forms thick forests. Dry weather and summer storms with lightning create a great danger of these forests catching on fire, which the Darkovans combat in various ways. Small fires are fought by fire crews; no one is exempt from fire duty. Large fires may need to be put out by telepathic weather-workers who create a rainstorm. =Spicebush= A \\"spiky\\" weed that grows in the desert near the Dry-towns, where nothing else grows. However, in The Shattered Chain, Chapter 3, it is described as \\"fluffy.\\" =Rhowyn= A tree with a six-petaled flower (Traitor's Sun, chapter 18). Used as a nickname for the six-membered cells of the Sons of Darkover, a somewhat subversive organization. The name sounds like Rowan but the flower is different. =Fiberpods= This plant produces \\"pods\\" that after they are soaked in water can be unraveled to produce a useful fiber. There may be several kinds of plants that do this to protect their seeds from the elements. As some colonists discovered in Darkover Landfall, the chieri spin these fibers and create cloth from them using a loom. Andrea Closson, in The World Wreckers, upon finding a partly unraveled pod, starts to make thread out of it, out of habit. The Trailmen build their cities from this fiber by stringing it between the trees like a suspension bridge and weaving a floor. =Herbs and Vegetables= It is clear from Darkover Landfall that some food plants were brought to Darkover by the colonists. Whether the ones mentioned in the chronologically later books are the same is not clear. Of course, the original stock may have been subject to selection to adapt to a redder sun and colder temperatures. Also, it appears from several of the books that the castles and great houses of the Comyn have greenhouses for the growing of vegetables and herbs. In The Forbidden Tower, Chapter 7, Damon Ridenow says that plants on Darkover have adapted by evolution to flower in winter, if there are a couple of warm days. He says that \\"ice-melons\\" cannot be grown on the plains of Armida: \\"It's too warm -- they're a plant of the glaciers.\\" However, apples grow in Armida. Damon and Andrew, after eating lunch, plant their apple cores in the ground and Andrew says, \\"Some day, Damon. our children will eat apples from these trees.\\" (The Forbidden Tower, Chapter 7) Snap-beans are mentioned in Traitor's Sun, chapter 17, when Domenic volunteers to help in the kitchen of an inn, and he is shown how to \\"string\\" them. He is told the cook \\"fries them with bacon\\" implying that there are pigs on Darkover. Sleepweed: supposedly able to put a person into a sleep for ten days, although this may be an exaggeration (Traitor's Sun, chapter 16). Goldenflower: Used to make a tea that eases menstrual cramps (City of Sorcery, Chapter 12). Blackthorn: Used to make a bitter tea that is used to treat altitude sickness (City of Sorcery, Chapter 19). Perhaps the same as black thornleaf, used in poultices to treat frostbite by \\"draw[ing] the blood to the limbs and back to the heart\\"; also given in tea for frostbite (The Forbidden Tower, Chapter 6). =Mushrooms= Raising mushrooms is common in the hills and mountains. A kind of mushroom grows naturally on dead trees; harvesting requires only a knife and a sack. Animals It is unclear whether domestic animals are descended from stock brought by the colonists or whether they are domesticated native species. In the alternative, the Darkovans could have obtained them from the Terran Empire after rediscovery. Chickens, cattle and sheep are all mentioned, and pigs can be inferred from bacon. The presence of Terran-sounding animals such as butterflies and snakes (The Shattered Chain, Chapter 3) is unexplained. It is not clear if they are Darkovan analogs of Terran species. =Horse= The history of horses on Darkover is ambiguous. In Hawkmistress! (during the Ages of Chaos) there is a battle in which the opposing sides charge at each other on horseback. However, in books that are historically later, it is said that horses were unknown until Terrans brought them. The Altons became known for raising them, especially after the Terran Andrew (An'ndra) Carr married into the family (see The Spell Sword and The Forbidden Tower). By the time of Exile's Song horses are common, and there are also mules. =Butterfly= Apparently Darkover has native species of butterflies. They are mentioned both in descriptions of nature and in references to the \\"butterfly clasp\\" used by women to hold hair in a way that covers the back of the neck. For a woman to expose the back of her neck is considered indecent. =Hawks and Vultures= Hawks exist and are domesticated using ancient hawking techniques, which can be enhanced by laran. In several of the books, e. g. The Bloody Sun, people go hawking, and it appears to be a form of recreation common among the Comyn. The hawk \\"Preciosa\\" domesticated by Romilly MacAran in Hawkmistress! is called a verrin hawk. Smaller hawks are said to be more suitable for ladies by a Comyn lord, who says it is \\"disgraceful\\" that Romilly is allowed to fly a verrin hawk. (Hawkmistress!, Part 1, Chapter 5). It is not clear how many kinds of hawks there are. The kyorebni is a kind of vulture. The presence of water holes in the Drylands can be inferred by kyorebni circling over them (The Shattered Chain, Chapter 4). A larger species of vulture is called a \\"sentry-bird,\\" and can be used for aerial surveillance in wartime (Hawkmistress!, Parts 2and 3). The kyorebni is called a \\"Lammergeier\\" in Terran Standard (City of Sorcery, Chapter 11). =Chervine= The chervine is an animal native to Darkover. It is apparently similar to a deer in its general appearance and has horns; however it has been domesticated and is used for riding and as a pack animal. It is also used for food. =Rabbithorn= The rabbithorn is native to Darkover. It is considered to be very good eating, even a delicacy. In Traitor's Sun it is mentioned that the inn, The Crowing Cock, keeps them in cages. In Darkover Landfall the colonists discuss raising them domestically for their fur. Rabbithorn (the plural and singular are the same) may be stuffed and roasted, placed on a platter and served with mushrooms, other vegetables and a savory or sweet sauce. They are also made into a stew. This animal is never clearly described. It may be partly a joke based on the Jackalope or the Wolpertinger. =Ice- Rabbit= The ice-rabbit lives in the mountains and is an important prey of banshees. The ice-rabbit population increases and decreases according to the availability of food. When there are plenty of ice-rabbits, the banshees stay above the snow-line; but when the ice-rabbit population crashes, the banshees start to hunt lower down and are a greater danger to travelers (City of Sorcery, Chapter 19). =Scorpion Ant= The scorpion ant is an insect-like organism with pincers and a potentially deadly sting that lives in colonies. In Darkover Landfall a member of an expedition steps on a nest and arouses the inhabitants, leading to his painful and sudden death. =Banshee= The banshee is a large, flightless, blind, bird-like predator that lives in the mountains, commonly above the line of permanent snow. It apparently hunts by seeking warmth, and it will attack any warm-blooded animal. It catches its prey by screaming to paralyze it and then disemboweling it with a stroke of one of its clawed feet or by a bite of its huge beak. It is mentioned in nearly all the novels, and a few characters hear its scream, or actually see the banshee and have a narrow escape. There are several speculations about the banshee's paralyzing scream in various books. The scream may be so terrifying that its prey is afraid to move. Alternatively, it has been suggested that banshees have a laran that can take over the mind of another and leave him vulnerable. =Dragon= The dragon is an extinct, perhaps mythical creature on Darkover. Marion Zimmer Bradley, in the introduction to \\"Coils\\" by Patricia Shaw Mathews in the anthology Red Sun of Darkover, says that she has \\"always thought of Darkover as a place of which one might say, 'Here there be dragons.'\\" There are two canonical references to the dragon: The \\"Ballad of the Death of the Last Dragon\\" as described in Two To Conquer, and the proverb, \\"It is wrong (or \\"ill done\\") to keep a dragon chained to roast your meat.\\" Various characters speculate on the meaning of this saying: * It would be dangerous to make a dragon work for you. * Something powerful and dangerous should not be used for a trivial purpose. * It would be right to keep a dragon chained to render him harmless, but a dragon has no use. * Dragons cannot be chained, at least not for very long. * Dragons do not exist, and the saying is humorous.

Besides other actions, the group was responsible for the assassination of the Jordanian Prime Minister Wasfi Tal, and the Munich massacre, in which eleven Israeli athletes and officials were kidnapped and killed, as well as a West German policeman losing his life, during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, their most publicized event. These attacks led to the creation or specialization of permanent counter-terrorism forces in many European countries. The group was last known to be active around 1988. Origin Newsreel about the 1970 events The group's name is derived from the Black September conflict which began on 16 September 1970, when King Hussein of Jordan declared military rule in response to fedayeen attempting to seize his kingdom ‚Äì resulting in the deaths and expulsion of thousands of Palestinians fighters from Jordan. The BSO began as a small cell of Fatah men determined to take revenge upon King Hussein and the Jordanian Armed Forces. Recruits from the PFLP, as-Sa'iqa, and other groups also joined. Initially, most of its members were dissidents within Fatah who had been close to Abu Ali Iyad, the commander of Fatah forces in northern Jordan who continued to fight the Jordanian Army after the PLO leadership withdrew. He was killed, allegedly through execution, by Jordanian forces on 23 July 1971.Quandt, Jabber and Lesch, p. 141. It was alleged by them that the Jordanian Prime Minister at the time, Wasfi Tal, was personally responsible for his torture and death.Amos, 1980, p. 222. Structure of the group There is disagreement among historians, journalists, and primary sources about the nature of the BSO and the extent to which it was controlled by Fatah, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) faction controlled at the time by Yasser Arafat. In his book Stateless, Salah Khalaf (Abu Iyad), Arafat's chief of security and a founding member of Fatah, wrote that: \\"Black September was not a terrorist organization, but was rather an auxiliary unit of the resistance movement, at a time when the latter was unable to fully realize its military and political potential. The members of the organization always denied any ties between their organization and Fatah or the PLO.\\" The denial described in Abu Iyad's claim was mutual: according to a 1972 article in the Jordanian newspaper Al-Dustur, Mohammed Daoud Oudeh, also known as Abu Daoud, a BSO operative and former senior PLO member, told Jordanian police: \\"There is no such organization as Black September. Fatah announces its own operations under this name so that Fatah will not appear as the direct executor of the operation.\\" A March 1973 document released in 1981 by the U.S. State Department seemed to confirm that Fatah was Black September's parent organization. According to American journalist John K. Cooley, the BSO represented a \\"total break with the old operational and organizational methods of the fedayeen. Its members operated in air-tight cells of four or more men and women. Each cell's members were kept purposely ignorant of other cells. Leadership was exercised from outside by intermediaries and 'cut-offs' \\", though there was no centralized leadership.Cooley 1973 Cooley writes that many of the cells in Europe and around the world were made up of Palestinians and other Arabs who had lived in their countries of residence as students, teachers, businessmen, and diplomats for many years. Operating without a central leadership (see Leaderless resistance), it was a \\"true collegial direction\\". The cell structure and the need-to-know operational philosophy protected the operatives by ensuring that the apprehension or surveillance of one cell would not affect the others. The structure offered plausible deniability to the Fatah leadership, which was careful to distance itself from Black September operations. Fatah needed Black September, according to historian Benny Morris. He writes that there was a \\"problem of internal PLO or Fatah cohesion, with extremists constantly demanding greater militancy. The moderates apparently acquiesced in the creation of Black September in order to survive\\".Morris 2001, p. 379 As a result of pressure from militants, writes Morris, a Fatah congress in Damascus in August‚ÄìSeptember 1971 agreed to establish Black September. The new organization was based on Fatah's existing special intelligence and security apparatus, and on the PLO offices and representatives in various European capitals, and from very early on, there was cooperation between Black September and the PFLP. The PLO closed Black September down in September 1973, on the anniversary it was created by the \\"political calculation that no more good would come of terrorism abroad\\" according to Morris.Morris 2001, p. 383 In 1974 Arafat ordered the PLO to withdraw from acts of violence outside the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Israel. Munich massacre The group was responsible for the 1972 Munich massacre in which 11 Israeli Olympic athletes were murdered, nine of whom were first taken hostage, and the killing of a German police officer, during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. Following the attack, the Israeli government, headed by Prime Minister Golda Meir, launched Operation Wrath of God and ordered Mossad to assassinate those known to have been involved in the Munich massacre. By 1979, at least one Mossad unit had assassinated eight Black September and PLO members, including Ali Hassan Salameh, nicknamed the \\"Red Prince\\", the wealthy, flamboyant son of an upper-class family, and commander of Force 17, Yasser Arafat's personal security squad. Salameh was also behind the 1972 hijacking of Sabena Flight 572 from Vienna to Lod. He was killed by a car bomb in Beirut on 22 January 1979. In Operation Spring of Youth, in April 1973, Israeli commandos killed three senior members of Black September in Beirut, Lebanon. In July 1973, in what became known as the Lillehammer affair, Ahmed Bouchiki, an innocent Moroccan waiter who was mistaken for Ali Hassan Salameh was killed in Norway. Six Israeli operatives were arrested for the murder. Recent remarks by Abu Daoud, the alleged mastermind of the Munich kidnappings, deny that any of the Palestinians assassinated by Mossad had any relation to the Munich operation, despite the fact that the list includes two of the three surviving members of the kidnap squad arrested at the airport. Other attacks Other actions attributed to Black September include: * 28 November 1971: the assassination of Jordan's prime minister, Wasfi al-Tal, in retaliation for the expulsion of the PLO from Jordan in 1970‚Äì71; * December 1971: the attempted assassination of Zeid al Rifai, Jordan's ambassador to London and former chief of the Jordanian royal court; * 6 February 1972: sabotage of a West German electrical installation and gas plants in Ravenstein and Ommen in the Netherlands and in Hamburg in West Germany; * 8 May 1972: hijacking of a Belgian aircraft, Sabena Flight 572, flying from Vienna to Lod. * September and October 1972: dozens of letter bombs were sent from Amsterdam to Israeli diplomatic posts around the world, killing Israeli Agricultural Counsellor Ami Shachori in Britain.And Now, Mail- a-Death, Time, 2 October 1972.

A 1973 United States Department of State document, declassified in 2006, concluded: \\"The Khartoum operation was planned and carried out with the full knowledge and personal approval of Yasser Arafat.\\" * 2 March 1973: 1973 New York bomb plot * 5 August 1973: two Palestinian militants claiming affiliation with Black September opened fire on a passenger lounge in Athens now closed Ellinikon International Airport, killing three and wounding 55. A Lufthansa Boeing 737 was hijacked from Rome in December 1973 to demand that the gunmen be freed from Greek custody. * 20 October 1981: Black September claimed responsibility for the 1981 Antwerp synagogue bombing in Belgium, which killed three and wounded 106 people. According to the University of Maryland, College Park's Global Terrorism Database, the group was last known to be active in 1988, when it was responsible for a bombing in Amman, Jordan. =Letter bomb attacks and the assassination of Ami Shachori= plaque at the Embassy of Israel, London Ami Shachori was the agricultural counsellor in the Israeli Embassy to the United Kingdom in Kensington, London. Shachori was assassinated in a letter bomb attack on 19 September 1972, perpetrated by Black September. Eight bombs were addressed to embassy staffers. Four were intercepted at a post office sorting room in Earls Court, but the other four letters made it to the embassy. Three of the letters were detected in the consulate post room but Shachori opened his, believing it contained Dutch flower seeds he had ordered. The resulting blast tore a hole in the desk and fatally wounded Shachori in the stomach and chest. In Shachori's memory an annual memorial lecture on agriculture in London was established.

Concupiscence (from Late Latin noun concupiscentia, from the Latin verb concupiscere, from con-, \\"with\\", here an intensifier, + cupi(d)-, \\"desiring\\" + -escere, a verb-forming suffix denoting beginning of a process or state) is an ardent, usually sensual, longing. Involuntary sexual arousal is explored in the Confessions of Augustine, wherein he used the term \\"concupiscence\\" to refer to sinful lust. In Catholic theology, concupiscence is seen as a desire of the lower appetite contrary to reason. There are nine occurrences of concupiscence in the Douay-Rheims BibleWisdom 4:12, Romans 7:7, Romans 7:8, Colossians 3:5, Epistle of James 1:14, James 1:15, 2 Peter 1:4, and 1 John 2:17. and three occurrences in the King James Bible.Romans 7:8, Colossians 3:5 and I Thessalonians 4:5.

Jewish perspective In Judaism, there is an early concept of yetzer hara (Hebrew: ◊ô◊¶◊® ◊î◊®◊¢ for \\"evil inclination\\"). This concept is the inclination of humanity at creation to do evil or violate the will of God. The yetzer hara is not the product of original sin as in Christian theology, but the tendency of humanity to misuse the natural survival needs of the physical body. Therefore, the natural need of the body for food becomes gluttony, the command to procreate becomes sexual sin, the demands of the body for rest become sloth, and so on. In Judaism, the yetzer hara is a natural part of God's creation, and God provides guidelines and commands to help us master this tendency. This doctrine was clarified in the Sifre around 200‚Äì350 CE. In Jewish doctrine, it is possible for humanity to overcome the yetzer hara. Therefore, for the Jewish mindset, it is possible for humanity to choose good over evil, and it is the person's duty to choose good (see: Sifrei on Deuteronomy, P. Ekev 45, Kidd. 30b). Augustine Involuntary sexual arousal is explored in the Confessions of Augustine, wherein he used the term \\"concupiscence\\" to refer to sinful lust. He taught that Adam's sinAugustine taught that Adam's sin was both an act of foolishness (insipientia) and of pride and disobedience to God of Adam and Eve. He thought it was a most subtle job to discern what came first: self-centeredness or failure in seeing truth. Augustine wrote to Julian of Eclanum: Sed si disputatione subtilissima et elimatissima opus est, ut sciamus utrum primos homines insipientia superbos, an insipientes superbia fecerit (Contra Julianum, V, 4.18; PL 44, 795). This particular sin would not have taken place if Satan had not sown into their senses \\"the root of evil\\" (radix Mali): Nisi radicem mali humanus tunc reciperet sensus (Contra Julianum, I, 9.42; PL 44, 670) is transmitted by concupiscence, or \\"hurtful desire\\",ORIGINAL SIN- Biblical Apologetic Studies ‚Äì Retrieved 17 May 2014. Augustine of Hippo (354‚Äì430) taught that Adam's sin is transmitted by concupiscence, or \\"hurtful desire\\", sexual desire and all sensual feelings resulting in humanity becoming a massa damnata (mass of perdition, condemned crowd), with much enfeebled, though not destroyed, freedom of will.William Nicholson ‚Äì A Plain But Full Exposition of the Catechism of the Church of England... (Google eBook) page 118. Retrieved 17 May 2014. resulting in humanity becoming a massa damnata (mass of perdition, condemned crowd), with much enfeebled, though not destroyed, freedom of will. When Adam sinned, human nature was thenceforth transformed. Adam and Eve, via sexual reproduction, recreated human nature. Their descendants now live in sin, in the form of concupiscence, a term Augustine used in a metaphysical, not a psychological sense.Thomas Aquinas explained Augustine's doctrine pointing out that the libido (concupiscence), which makes the original sin pass from parents to children, is not a libido actualis, i.e. sexual lust, but libido habitualis, i.e. a wound of the whole of human nature: Libido quae transmittit peccatum originale in prolem, non est libido actualis, quia dato quod virtute divina concederetur alicui quod nullam inordinatam libidinem in actu generationis sentiret, adhuc transmitteret in prolem originale peccatum. Sed libido illa est intelligenda habitualiter, secundum quod appetitus sensitivus non continetur sub ratione vinculo originalis iustitiae. Et talis libido in omnibus est aequalis (STh I¬™‚ÄìIIae q. 82 a. 4 ad 3). Augustine insisted that concupiscence was not a being but a bad quality, the privation of good or a wound.Non substantialiter manere concupiscentiam, sicut corpus aliquod aut spiritum; sed esse affectionem quamdam malae qualitatis, sicut est languor. (De nuptiis et concupiscentia, I, 25. 28; PL 44, 430; cf. Contra Julianum, VI, 18.53; PL 44, 854; ibid. VI, 19.58; PL 44, 857; ibid., II, 10.33; PL 44, 697; Contra Secundinum Manichaeum, 15; PL 42, 590. He admitted that sexual concupiscence (libido) might have been present in the perfect human nature in paradise, and that only later it became disobedient to human will as a result of the first couple's disobedience to God's will in the original sin.Augustine wrote to Julian of Eclanum: Quis enim negat futurum fuisse concubitum, etiamsi peccatum non praecessisset? Sed futurus fuerat, sicut aliis membris, ita etiam genitalibus voluntate motis, non libidine concitatis; aut certe etiam ipsa libidine ‚Äì ut non vos de illa nimium contristemus ‚Äì non qualis nunc est, sed ad nutum voluntarium serviente (Contra Julianum, IV. 11. 57; PL 44, 766). See also his late work: Contra secundam Iuliani responsionem imperfectum opus, II, 42; PL 45,1160; ibid. II, 45; PL 45,1161; ibid., VI, 22; PL 45, 1550‚Äì1551. Cf. In Augustine's view (termed \\"Realism\\"), all of humanity was really present in Adam when he sinned, and therefore all have sinned. Original sin, according to Augustine, consists of the guilt of Adam which all humans inherit. Pelagius The main opposition came from a monk named Pelagius (354‚Äì420 or 440). His views became known as Pelagianism. Although the writings of Pelagius are no longer extant, the eight canons of the Council of Carthage (418) provided corrections to the perceived errors of the early Pelagians. From these corrections, there is a strong similarity between Pelagians and their Jewish counterparts on the concepts of concupiscence. Pelagianism gives mankind the ability to choose between good and evil within their created nature. While rejecting concupiscence, and embracing a concept similar to the yetzer hara, these views rejected humanity's universal need for grace. Catholic teaching The Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) teaches that Adam and Eve were constituted in an original \\"state of holiness and justice\\" (CCC 375, 376 398), free from concupiscence (CCC 377). The preternatural state enjoyed by Adam and Eve afforded endowments with many prerogatives which, while pertaining to the natural order, were not due to human nature as such. Principal among these were a high degree of infused knowledge, bodily immortality and freedom from pain, and immunity from evil impulses or inclinations. In other words, the lower or animal nature in man was perfectly subject to the control of reason, and the will subject to God. Besides this, the Catholic Church teaches that our first parents were also endowed with sanctifying grace by which they were elevated to the supernatural order. By sinning, however, Adam lost this original \\"state\\", not only for himself but for all human beings (CCC 416). According to Catholic theology man has not lost his natural faculties: by the sin of Adam he has been deprived only of the Divine gifts to which his nature had no strict right: the complete mastery of his passions, exemption from death, sanctifying grace, and the vision of God in the next life. The Creator, whose gifts were not due to the human race, had the right to bestow them on such conditions as he wished and to make their conservation depend on the fidelity of the head of the family. A prince can confer a hereditary dignity on condition that the recipient remains loyal, and that, in case of his rebelling, this dignity shall be taken from him and in consequence from his descendants. It is not, however, intelligible that the prince, on account of a fault committed by a father, should order the hands and feet of all the descendants of the guilty man to be cut off immediately after their birth. As a result of original sin, according to Catholics, human nature has not been totally corrupted (as opposed to the teaching of Luther and Calvin); rather, human nature has only been weakened and wounded, subject to ignorance, suffering, the domination of death, and the inclination to sin and evil (CCC 405, 418). This inclination toward sin and evil is called \\"concupiscence\\" (CCC 405, 418). Baptism, CCC teaches, erases original sin and turns a man back towards God. The inclination toward sin and evil persists, however, and he must continue to struggle against concupiscence (CCC 2520). In this evolutionary era Catholic teaching on original sin focuses more on its results than on its origins. As Cardinal Ratzinger had intimated in 1981, and as Pope Benedict XVI clarified in 2008: \\"How did it happen? This remains obscure.... Evil remains mysterious. It is presented as such in great images, as it is in chapter 3 of Genesis, with that scene of the two trees, of the serpent, of sinful man: a great image that makes us guess but cannot explain what is itself illogical.\\" Catholic and Protestant differences The primary difference between Catholic theology and most of the many different Protestant theologies on the issue of concupiscence is whether it can be classified as sin by its own nature. Different Protestant denominations tend to see concupiscence as sin itself, an act of the sinner. The Catholic Church teaches that while it is highly likely to cause sin, concupiscence is not sin itself. Rather, it is \\"the tinder for sin\\" which \\"cannot harm those who do not consent\\" (CCC 1264).Catechism of the Catholic Church, New York: Doubleday Publications, 1997 This difference is intimately tied with the different traditions on original sin. Much Protestant theology holds that the original prelapsarian nature of humanity was an innate tendency to good; the special relationship Adam and Eve enjoyed with God was due not to some supernatural gift, but to their own natures. Hence, in some Protestant traditions, the Fall was not the destruction of a supernatural gift, leaving humanity's nature to work unimpeded, but rather the corruption of that nature itself. Since the present nature of humans is corrupted from their original nature, it follows that it is not good, but rather evil (although some good may still remain). Thus, in some Protestant traditions, concupiscence is evil in itself. The Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England state that \\"the Apostle doth confess, that concupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin\\". By contrast, Catholicism, while also maintaining that humanity's original nature is good (CCC 374), teaches that even after this gift was lost after the Fall, human nature still cannot be called evil, because it remains a natural creation of God. Despite the fact that humans sin, Catholic theology teaches that human nature itself is not the cause of sin, although once it comes into contact with sin it may produce more sin. The difference in views also extends to the relationship between concupiscence and original sin. Another reason for the differing views of Catholics and certain Protestants on concupiscence is their position on sin in general. Certain Protestants (for instance the magisterial reformers) hold that one can be guilty of sin even if it is not voluntary; The Catholic Church, by contrast, traditionally has held that one is guilty of sin only when the sin is voluntary. The Scholastics and magisterial reformers have different views on the issue of what is voluntary and what is not: the Catholic Scholastics considered the emotions of love, hate, like and dislike to be acts of will or choice, while the early Protestant reformers did not. By the Catholic position that one's attitudes are acts of will, sinful attitudes are voluntary. By the magisterial reformer view that these attitudes are involuntary, some sins are involuntary as well. Since human nature (and therefore concupiscence) is not voluntarily chosen, the Catholic Church does not teach that it is sinful; some Protestants believe that, since some sins are involuntary, it can be. Some Protestants believe that concupiscence is the primary type of sin; thus they might refer to it simply as sin, or, to distinguish it from particular sinful acts, as \\"humanity's sinful nature.\\" Thus, concupiscence as a distinct term is more likely to be used by Catholics. Sensuality Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century described two divisions of \\"sensuality\\": the concupiscible (pursuit/avoidance instincts) and the irascible (competition/aggression/defense instincts). With the former are associated the emotions of joy and sadness, love and hate, desire and repugnance; with the latter, daring and fear, hope and despair, anger. Islam Al-Ghazali in the 11th century discussed concupiscence from an Islamic perspective in his book Kimiya-yi sa'ƒÅdat (The Alchemy of Happiness), and also mentioned it in The Deliverer from Error. In this book, amongst other things, he discusses how to reconcile the concupiscent and the irascible souls, balancing them to achieve happiness. Concupiscence is related to the term \\"nafs\\" in Arabic.

He also served as Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity from 1967 to 1968. During the Congo Crisis, Mobutu, serving as Chief of Staff of the Army and supported by Belgium and the United States, deposed the democratically elected government of nationalist Patrice Lumumba in 1960. Mobutu installed a government that arranged for Lumumba's execution in 1961, and continued to lead the country's armed forces until he took power directly in a second coup in 1965 to become the country's military dictator. To consolidate his power, he established the Popular Movement of the Revolution as the sole legal political party in 1967, changed the Congo's name to Zaire in 1971, and his own name to Mobutu Sese Seko in 1972. Mobutu claimed that his political ideology was \\"neither left nor right, nor even centre\\"Crawford Young, Thomas Edwin Turner, The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State, p. 210, 1985, University of Wisconsin Press but in practice he developed a totalitarian regime, amassed vast personal wealth, and attempted to purge the country of all colonial cultural influence through his program of \\"national authenticity\\".Vieira, David Lazure: Precolonial Imaginaries and Colonial Legacies in Mobutu's \\"Authentic\\" Zaire in: Exploitation and Misrule in Colonial and Postcolonial Africa, (edited by) Kalu, Kenneth and Falola, Toyin, pp. 165-191, Palgrave Macmillan, 2019David F. Schmitz, The United States and Right-Wing Dictatorships, 1965-1989, pp. 9-36, 2006, Cambridge University Press Mobutu was the object of a pervasive cult of personality. During his reign, he amassed a large personal fortune through economic exploitation and corruption, leading some to call his rule a \\"kleptocracy\\". He presided over a period of widespread human rights violations. Under his rule, the nation also suffered from uncontrolled inflation, a large debt, and massive currency devaluations. Mobutu received strong support (military, diplomatic and economic) from the United States, France and Belgium, who believed he was a strong opponent of communism in Francophone Africa. He also built close ties with the governments of Apartheid South Africa, Israel and the Greek military junta. From 1972 onwards, he was also supported by Mao Zedong of China, mainly due to his anti-Soviet stance, but also as part of Mao's attempts to create a bloc of Afro-Asian nations led by him. The massive Chinese economic aid that flowed into Zaire gave Mobutu more flexibility in his dealings with Western governments, allowed him to identify as an \\"anti- capitalist revolutionary\\", and enabled him to avoid going to the International Monetary Fund for assistance.Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, Mao: the Unknown Story, p. 574, 2006 edition, Anchor Books By 1990, economic deterioration and unrest led Mobutu to agree to share power with opposition leaders, but he used the army to thwart change until May 1997, when rebel forces led by Laurent- D√©sir√© Kabila expelled him from the country. Already suffering from advanced prostate cancer, he died three months later in Morocco. Mobutu was notorious for corruption, nepotism, and the embezzlement of between US$4 billion and $15 billion during his reign. He was known for extravagances such as shopping trips to Paris via the supersonic and expensive Concorde. Biography =Early years and education= Mobutu, a member of the Ngbandi ethnic group, was born in 1930 in Lisala, Belgian Congo. Mobutu's mother, Marie Madeleine Yemo, was a hotel maid who fled to Lisala to escape the harem of a local village chief. There she met and married Alb√©ric Gbemani, a cook for a Belgian judge. Shortly afterward she gave birth to Mobutu. The name \\"Mobutu\\" was selected by an uncle. Gbemani died when Mobutu was eight.Wrong, Michela (2009) In the Footsteps of Mr Kurtz: Living on the Brink of Disaster in Mobutu's Congo. HarperCollins. . pp. 70‚Äì72 Thereafter he was raised by an uncle and a grandfather. The wife of the Belgian judge took a liking to Mobutu and taught him to speak, read, and write fluently in the French language, the official language of the country in the colonial period. His widowed mother Yemo relied on the help of relatives to support her four children, and the family moved often. Mobutu's earliest education took place in the capital L√©opoldville (now Kinshasa). His mother eventually sent him to an uncle in Coquilhatville, where he attended the Christian Brothers School, a Catholic-mission boarding school. A physically imposing figure, Mobutu dominated school sports. He also excelled in academic subjects and ran the class newspaper. He was known for his pranks and impish sense of humor. A classmate recalled that when the Belgian priests, whose first language was Dutch, made an error in French, Mobutu would leap to his feet in class and point out the mistake. In 1949 Mobutu stowed away aboard a boat, traveling downriver to L√©opoldville, where he met a girl. The priests found him several weeks later. At the end of the school year, in lieu of being sent to prison, he was ordered to serve seven years in the colonial army, the Force Publique (FP). This was the usual punishment for rebellious students.Wrong, pp. 72‚Äì74 =Army service= Mobutu found discipline in army life, as well as a father figure in Sergeant Louis Bobozo. Mobutu kept up his studies by borrowing European newspapers from the Belgian officers and books from wherever he could find them, reading them on sentry duty and whenever he had a spare moment. His favourites were the writings of French president Charles de Gaulle, British prime minister Winston Churchill, and Italian Renaissance philosopher Niccol√≤ Machiavelli. After passing a course in accounting, Mobutu began to dabble professionally in journalism. Still angry after his clashes with the school priests, he did not marry in a church. His contribution to the wedding festivities was a crate of beer, all his army salary could afford.Wrong, pp. 74‚Äì75 = Early political involvement = As a soldier, Mobutu wrote pseudonymously on contemporary politics for Actualit√©s Africaines (African News), a magazine set up by a Belgian colonial. In 1956, he quit the army and became a full-time journalist,Wrong, p. 75 writing for the L√©opoldville daily L'Avenir.Crawford Young and Thomas Turner, The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State, p. 175 Two years later, he went to Belgium to cover the 1958 World Exposition and stayed to receive training in journalism. By this time, Mobutu had met many of the young Congolese intellectuals who were challenging colonial rule. He became friendly with Patrice Lumumba and joined Lumumba's Mouvement National Congolais (MNC). Mobutu eventually became Lumumba's personal aide. Several contemporaries indicate that Belgian intelligence had recruited Mobutu to be an informer to the government.Wrong, pp. 76 During the 1960 talks in Brussels on Congolese independence, the US embassy held a reception for the Congolese delegation. Embassy staff were each assigned a list of delegation members to meet, and discussed their impressions afterward. The ambassador noted, \\"One name kept coming up. But it wasn't on anyone's list because he wasn't an official delegation member, he was Lumumba's secretary. But everyone agreed that this was an extremely intelligent man, very young, perhaps immature, but a man with great potential.\\"Wrong, p. 67 Following the general election, Lumumba was tasked with creating a government. He gave Mobutu the office of Secretary of State to the Presidency. Mobutu held much influence in the final determination of the rest of the government. =Congo Crisis= Colonel Mobutu in 1960 On 5 July 1960, soldiers of the Force Publique stationed at Camp L√©opold II in L√©opoldville, dissatisfied with their all-white leadership and working conditions, mutinied. The revolt spread across the region in the following days. Mobutu assisted other officials in negotiating with the mutineers to secure the release of the officers and their families. On 8 July the full Council of Ministers convened in an extraordinary session under the chairmanship of President Joseph Kasa-Vubu at Camp L√©opold II to address the task of Africanising the garrison. After allowing for the election of a new commandant for the garrison, the ministers debated over who would make a suitable army chief of staff. The two main candidates for the post were Maurice Mpolo and Mobutu. The former had shown some influence over the mutinying troops, but Kasa-Vubu and the Bakongo ministers feared that he would enact a coup d'√©tat if he were given power. The latter was perceived as calmer and more thoughtful. Lumumba saw Mpolo as courageous, but favored Mobutu's prudence. As the discussions continued, the cabinet began to divide according to who they preferred to serve as chief of staff. Lumumba wanted to keep both men in his government and wished to avoid upsetting one of their camps of supporters. In the end Mobutu was given the role and awarded the rank of colonel. The following day government delegations left the capital to oversee the Africanisation of the army; Mobutu was sent to √âquateur. Encouraged by a Belgian government intent on maintaining its access to rich Congolese mines, secessionist violence erupted in the south. Concerned that the United Nations force sent to help restore order was not helping to crush the secessionists, Lumumba turned to the Soviet Union for assistance. He received massive military aid and about a thousand Soviet technical advisers within six weeks. As this was during the Cold War, the US government feared that the Soviet activity was a maneuver to spread communist influence in Central Africa. Kasa- Vubu was encouraged by the US and Belgium to dismiss Lumumba, which he did on 5 September. An outraged Lumumba declared Kasa-Vubu deposed. Parliament refused to recognise the dismissals and urged reconciliation, but no agreement was reached. Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu each ordered Mobutu to arrest the other. As Army Chief of Staff, Mobutu came under great pressure from multiple sources. The embassies of Western nations, which helped pay the soldiers' salaries, as well as Kasa-Vubu and Mobutu's subordinates, all favored getting rid of the Soviet presence. On 14 September Mobutu launched a bloodless coup, declaring both Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba to be \\"neutralised\\" and establishing a new government of university graduates, the College of Commissioners-General. Lumumba rejected this action but was forced to retire to his residence, where UN peacekeepers prevented Mobutu's soldiers from arresting him. Losing confidence that the international community would support his reinstatement, Lumumba fled in late November to join his supporters in Stanleyville to establish a new government. He was captured by Mobutu's troops in early December, and incarcerated at his headquarters in Thysville. However, Mobutu still considered him a threat, and transferred him to the rebelling State of Katanga on 17 January 1961. Lumumba disappeared from public view. It was later discovered that he was murdered the same day by the secessionist forces of Moise Tshombe, after Mobutu's government turned him over. left On 23 January 1961, Kasa-Vubu promoted Mobutu to major-general. Historian De Witte argues that this was a political action, \\"aimed to strengthen the army, the president's sole support, and Mobutu's position within the army\\". In 1964, Pierre Mulele led partisans in another rebellion. They quickly occupied two- thirds of the Congo. In response, the Congolese army, led by Mobutu, reconquered the entire territory through 1965. =Second coup and consolidation of power= Prime Minister Moise Tshombe's Congolese National Convention had won a large majority in the March 1965 elections, but Kasa-Vubu appointed an anti-Tshombe leader, √âvariste Kimba, as prime minister-designate. However, Parliament twice refused to confirm him. With the government in near- paralysis, Mobutu seized power in a bloodless coup on 25 November. He had turned 35 a month earlier. Under the auspices of a regime d'exception (or state of exception), Mobutu assumed sweeping‚Äîalmost absolute‚Äîpowers for five years. In his first speech upon taking power, Mobutu told a large crowd at L√©opoldville's main stadium that, since politicians had brought the country to ruin in five years, it would take him at least that long to set things right again. Therefore, he announced, \\"for five years, there will be no more political party activity in the country.\\" Parliament was reduced to a rubber stamp before being abolished altogether, but it was later revived. The number of provinces was reduced, and their autonomy curtailed, resulting in a highly centralized state. A Congolese cotton shirt embellished with a portrait of Mobutu from the collection of the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam Initially, Mobutu's government was decidedly apolitical, even anti-political. The word \\"politician\\" carried negative connotations, and became almost synonymous with someone who was wicked or corrupt. In 1966 the Corps of Volunteers of the Republic was established, a vanguard movement designed to mobilize popular support behind Mobutu, who was proclaimed the nation's \\"Second National Hero\\" after Lumumba. Despite the role he played in Lumumba's ousting, Mobutu worked to present himself as a successor to Lumumba's legacy. One of his key tenets early in his rule was \\"authentic Congolese nationalism\\". 1967 marked the debut of the Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR), which until 1990 was the nation's only legal political party. Among the themes advanced by the MPR in its doctrine, the Manifesto of N'Sele, were nationalism, revolution, and \\"authenticity\\". Revolution was described as a \\"truly national revolution, essentially pragmatic\\", which called for \\"the repudiation of both capitalism and communism\\". One of the MPR's slogans was \\"Neither left nor right\\", to which would be added \\"nor even center\\" in later years. That same year, all trade unions were consolidated into a single union, the National Union of Zairian Workers, and brought under government control. Mobutu intended for the union to serve as an instrument of support for government policy, rather than as an independent group. Independent trade unions were illegal until 1991. Mobutu sworn in as President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo following the 1970 election Facing many challenges early in his rule, Mobutu converted much opposition into submission through patronage; those he could not co-opt, he dealt with forcefully. In 1966, four cabinet members were arrested on charges of complicity in an attempted coup, tried by a military tribunal, and publicly executed in an open-air spectacle witnessed by over 50,000 people. Uprisings by former Katangan gendarmeries were crushed, as were the Stanleyville mutinies of 1967 led by white mercenaries.Anthony Mockler, 'The New Mercenaries,' Corgi Books, 1985, . By 1970, nearly all potential threats to his authority had been smashed, and for the most part, law and order was brought to nearly all parts of the country. That year marked the pinnacle of Mobutu's legitimacy and power. In 1970 King Baudouin of Belgium made a highly successful state visit to Kinshasa. That same year legislative and presidential elections were held. The MPR was the only party allowed to run, although the constitution stated that at least two parties were authorized. According to official figures, an implausible 98.33% of voters voted in favor of the MPR list. For the presidential election, Mobutu was the only candidate. Voting was not secret; voters chose a green paper if they supported Mobutu's candidacy, and a red paper if they opposed his candidacy. Casting a green ballot was deemed a vote for hope, while a red ballot was deemed a vote for chaos. Under the circumstances, the result was inevitable‚ÄìMobutu won with a vote of 10,131,669 to 157.Callaghy, Thomas M. The State-Society Struggle: Zaire in Comparative Perspective, p. 164 It later emerged that almost 30,500 more votes were cast than the actual number of registered voters.DRC: Elections under the Second Republic EISANohlen, D, Krennerich, M & Thibaut, B (1999) Elections in Africa: A data handbook, p294 As he consolidated power, Mobutu set up several military forces whose sole purpose was to protect him. These included the Special Presidential Division, Civil Guard and Service for Action, and Military Intelligence (SNIP). =Authenticity campaign= thumb Embarking on a campaign of pro-Africa cultural awareness, or authenticit√©, Mobutu began renaming cities that reflected the colonial past, starting on 1 June 1966: Leopoldville became Kinshasa, Elisabethville became Lubumbashi, and Stanleyville became Kisangani. In October 1971, he renamed the country as the Republic of Zaire. He ordered the people to change their European names to African ones, and priests were warned that they would face five years' imprisonment if they were caught baptizing a Zairian child with a European name. Western attire and ties were banned, and men were forced to wear a Mao- style tunic known as an abacost (shorthand for √† bas le costume, or \\"down with the suit\\").Shaw 2005, 63. In 1972, in accordance with his own decree of a year earlier, Mobutu renamed himself Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga (meaning \\"The all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake.\\"),Zaire: Continuity and Political Change in an Oppressive State, Winsome J. Leslie, Westview Press, 1993, page 60Other translations of his name include \\"the all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, will go from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake,\\" \\"the earthy, the peppery, all-powerful warrior who, by his endurance and will to win, goes from contest to contest leaving fire in his wake\\" and \\"the man who flies from victory to victory and leaves nothing behind him\\" and \\"the all-powerful warrior who goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake\\". (Wrong, p. 4) or Mobutu Sese Seko for short. Around this time, he eschewed his military uniform in favor of what would become his classic image‚Äîthe tall, imposing man carrying a walking stick while wearing an abacost, thick-framed glasses, and leopard-skin toque. In 1974, a new constitution consolidated Mobutu's grip on the country. It defined the MPR as the \\"single institution\\" in the country. It was officially defined as \\"the nation politically organized\\"‚Äîin essence, the state was a transmission belt for the party. All citizens automatically became members of the MPR from birth. The constitution stated that the MPR was embodied by the party's president, who was elected every seven years at its national convention. At the same time, the party president was automatically nominated as the sole candidate for a seven-year term as president of the republic; he was confirmed in office by a referendum. The document codified the emergency powers Mobutu had exercised since 1965; it vested the party president‚ÄìMobutu‚Äìwith \\"plentitude of power exercise,\\" effectively concentrating all governing power in his hands. Mobutu was reelected three times under this system, each time by implausibly high margins of 98 percent or more. A single list of MPR candidates was returned to the legislature every five years with equally implausible margins; official figures gave the MPR list unanimous or near-unanimous support. One-man rule Prince Bernhard in 1973 Early in his rule, Mobutu consolidated power by publicly executing political rivals, secessionists, coup plotters, and other threats to his rule. To set an example, many were hanged before large audiences. Such victims included former Prime Minister Evariste Kimba, who, with three cabinet members‚ÄîJ√©r√¥me Anany (Defense Minister), Emmanuel Bamba (Finance Minister), and Alexandre Mahamba (Minister of Mines and Energy)‚Äîwas tried in May 1966, and sent to the gallows on 30 May, before an audience of 50,000 spectators. The men were executed on charges of being in contact with Colonel Alphonse Bangala and Major Pierre Efomi, for the purpose of planning a coup. Mobutu explained the executions as follows: \\"One had to strike through a spectacular example, and create the conditions of regime discipline. When a chief takes a decision, he decides ‚Äì period.\\"Young and Turner, p. 57 In 1968, Pierre Mulele, Lumumba's Minister of Education and a rebel leader during the 1964 Simba Rebellion, was lured out of exile in Brazzaville on the belief that he would receive amnesty. Instead, he was tortured and killed by Mobutu's forces. While Mulele was still alive, his eyes were gouged out, his genitals were ripped off, and his limbs were amputated one by one.Wrong, Michela (2002). In The Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz: Living on the Brink of Disaster in Mobutu's Congo. Perennial. . p. 90 Mobutu later gave up torture and murder, and switched to a new tactic, buying off political rivals. He used the slogan \\"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer still\\"Influential Africans: Mobutu Sese Seko, Voice of America, 31 October 2009 to describe his tactic of co-opting political opponents through bribery. A favorite Mobutu tactic was to play \\"musical chairs\\", rotating members of his government, switching the cabinet roster constantly to ensure that no one would pose a threat to his rule. Another tactic was to arrest and sometimes torture dissident members of the government, only to later pardon them and reward them with high office. In 1972, Mobutu tried unsuccessfully to have himself named president for life.Young and Turner, p. 211 In June 1983, he raised himself to the rank of Field Marshal; the order was signed by General Likulia Bolongo. Victor Nendaka Bika, in his capacity as Vice-President of the Bureau of the Central Committee, second authority in the land, addressed a speech filled with praise for President Mobutu. Mobutu Sese Seko in army fatigues, 1978 To gain the revenues of Congolese resources, Mobutu initially nationalized foreign-owned firms and forced European investors out of the country. But in many cases he handed the management of these firms to relatives and close associates, who quickly exercised their own corruption and stole the companies' assets. By 1977, this had precipitated such an economic slump that Mobutu was forced to try to woo foreign investors back.BBC: \\"Timeline: Democratic Republic of Congo\\". BBC News (11 March 2014). Retrieved on 23 April 2014. Katangan rebels based in Angola invaded Zaire that year, in retaliation for Mobutu's support for anti-MPLA rebels. France airlifted 1,500 Moroccan paratroopers into the country and repulsed the rebels, ending Shaba I. The rebels attacked Zaire again, in greater numbers, in the Shaba II invasion of 1978. The governments of Belgium and France deployed troops with logistical support from the United States and defeated the rebels again. Mobutu was re-elected in single- candidate elections in 1977 and 1984. He spent most of his time increasing his personal fortune, which in 1984 was estimated to amount to US$5 billion.Fortune, 12 October 1987, p. 18960 Minutes, 4 March 1984 He held most of it out of the country in Swiss banks (however, a comparatively small $3.4 million was declared found in Swiss banks after he was ousted.\\"Swiss banks find only $3.4 million in Mobutu assets\\". CNN. 3 June 1997.). This was almost equivalent to the amount of the country's foreign debt at the time. By 1989, the government was forced to default on international loans from Belgium. Mobutu owned a fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles that he used to travel between his numerous palaces, while the nation's roads deteriorated and many of his people starved. The infrastructure virtually collapsed, and many public service workers went months without being paid. Most of the money was siphoned off to Mobutu, his family, and top political and military leaders. Only the Special Presidential Division ‚Äì on whom his physical safety depended ‚Äì was paid adequately or regularly. A popular saying that \\"the civil servants pretended to work while the state pretended to pay them\\" expressed this grim reality. Another feature of Mobutu's economic mismanagement, directly linked to the way he and his friends siphoned off so much of the country's wealth, was rampant inflation. The rapid decline in the real value of salaries strongly encouraged a culture of corruption and dishonesty among public servants of all kinds. Mobutu was known for his opulent lifestyle. He cruised on the Congo on his yacht Kamanyola. In Gbadolite, he erected a palace, the \\"Versailles of the jungle\\". For shopping trips to Paris, he would charter a Concorde from Air France; he had the Gbadolite Airport constructed with a runway long enough to accommodate the Concorde's extended take-off and landing requirements.Shaw 2005, 47, 58. In 1989, Mobutu chartered Concorde aircraft F-BTSD for a 26 June ‚Äì 5 July trip to give a speech at the United Nations in New York City, then again on 16 July for French bicentennial celebrations in Paris (where he was a guest of President Fran√ßois Mitterrand), and on 19 September for a flight from Paris to Gbadolite, and another nonstop flight from Gbadolite to Marseille with the youth choir of Zaire.Concorde supersonique jet / Gallery / Pictures.

The Congolese evening news on television was preceded by an image of him descending through clouds like a god. His portraits were hung in many public places, and government officials wore lapel pins bearing his portrait. He held such titles as \\"Father of the Nation\\", \\"Messiah\\", \\"Guide of the Revolution\\", \\"Helmsman\\", \\"Founder\\", \\"Savior of the People\\", and \\"Supreme Combatant\\". In the 1996 documentary of the 1974 Foreman-Ali fight in Zaire, dancers receiving the fighters can be heard chanting \\"Sese Seko, Sese Seko\\".

Relations soured early in Mobutu's rule over disputes involving the substantial Belgian commercial and industrial holdings in the country, but they warmed soon afterwards. Mobutu and his family were received as personal guests of the Belgian monarch in 1968, and a convention for scientific and technical cooperation was signed that same year. During King Baudouin's highly successful visit to Kinshasa in 1970, a treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two countries was signed. However, Mobutu tore up the treaty in 1974 in protest at Belgium's refusal to ban an anti-Mobutu book written by left-wing lawyer Jules Chom√©.Young and Turner, p. 172 Mobutu's \\"Zairianisation\\" policy, which expropriated foreign-held businesses and transferred their ownership to Zairians, added to the strain.

In 1971, Finance Minister Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing paid a visit to Zaire; later, after becoming president, he would develop a close personal relationship with President Mobutu, and became one of the regime's closest foreign allies. During the Shaba invasions, France sided firmly with Mobutu: during the first Shaba invasion, France airlifted 1,500 Moroccan troops to Zaire, and the rebels were repulsed;''Zaire: A Country Study'', \\"Shaba I\\".

OdomSauvetage de Kolwezi Relations with the People's Republic of China Initially, Zaire's relationship with the People's Republic of China was no better than its relationship with the Soviet Union. Memories of Chinese aid to Mulele and other Maoist rebels in Kwilu province during the ill-fated Simba Rebellion remained fresh in Mobutu's mind. He also opposed seating the PRC at the United Nations. However, by 1972, he began to see the Chinese in a different light, as a counterbalance to both the Soviet Union as well as his intimate ties with the United States, Israel, and South Africa.Callagy, Thomas M. (1983) South Africa in Southern Africa: The Intensifying Vortex of Violence. Praeger. Leslie, Winsome J. (1993) \\"Zaire in the International Arena\\" in Zaire: Continuity and Political Change in an Oppressive State. Westview Press. In November 1972, Mobutu extended diplomatic recognition to the Chinese (as well as East Germany and North Korea). The following year, Mobutu paid a visit to Beijing, where he met with chairman Mao Zedong and received promises of $100 million in technical aid. In 1974, Mobutu made a surprise visit to both China and North Korea, during the time he was originally scheduled to visit the Soviet Union. Upon returning home, both his politics and rhetoric became markedly more radical; it was around this time that Mobutu began criticizing Belgium and the United States (the latter for not doing enough, in Mobutu's opinion, to combat white minority rule in South Africa and Rhodesia), introduced the \\"obligatory civic work\\" program called salongo, and initiated \\"radicalization\\" (an extension of 1973's \\"Zairianization\\" policy). Mobutu even borrowed a title ‚Äì the Helmsman ‚Äì from Mao. Incidentally, late 1974-early 1975 was when his personality cult reached its peak. China and Zaire shared a common goal in central Africa, namely doing everything in their power to halt Soviet gains in the area. Accordingly, both Zaire and China covertly funneled aid to the FNLA (and later, UNITA) in order to prevent the MPLA, who were supported and augmented by Cuban forces, from coming to power. The Cubans, who exercised considerable influence in Africa in support of leftist and anti-imperialist forces, were heavily sponsored by the Soviet Union during the period. In addition to inviting Holden Roberto and his guerrillas to Beijing for training, China provided weapons and money to the rebels. Zaire itself launched an ill-fated, pre-emptive invasion of Angola in a bid to install a pro-Kinshasa government, but was repulsed by Cuban troops. The expedition was a fiasco with far-reaching repercussions, most notably the Shaba I and Shaba II invasions, both of which China opposed. China sent military aid to Zaire during both invasions, and accused the Soviet Union and Cuba (who were alleged to have supported the Shaban rebels, although this was and remains speculation) of working to de-stabilize central Africa. Relations with the Soviet Union Mobutu's relationship with the Soviet Union was frosty and tense. A staunch anti-communist, he was not anxious to recognize the Soviets; the USSR had supported‚Äîthough mostly in words‚Äîboth Patrice Lumumba, Mobutu's democratically elected predecessor, and the Simba rebellion. However, to project a non-aligned image, he did renew ties in 1967; the first Soviet ambassador arrived and presented his credentials in 1968. Mobutu did, however, join the United States in condemning the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia that year. Mobutu viewed the Soviet presence as advantageous for two reasons: it allowed him to maintain an image of non-alignment, and it provided a convenient scapegoat for problems at home. For example, in 1970, he expelled four Soviet diplomats for carrying out \\"subversive activities\\", and in 1971, twenty Soviet officials were declared persona non grata for allegedly instigating student demonstrations at Lovanium University. Moscow was the only major world capital Mobutu never visited, although he did accept an invitation to do so in 1974. For reasons unknown, he cancelled the visit at the last minute, and toured the People's Republic of China and North Korea instead. Relations cooled further in 1975, when the two countries found themselves on opposing sides in the Angolan Civil War. This had a dramatic effect on Zairian foreign policy for the next decade; bereft of his claim to African leadership (Mobutu was one of the few leaders who refused to recognize the Marxist government of Angola), Mobutu turned increasingly to the US and its allies, adopting pro-American stances on such issues as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and Israel's position in international organizations.

For the most part, Zaire enjoyed warm relations with the United States. The United States was the third largest donor of aid to Zaire (after Belgium and France), and Mobutu befriended several US presidents, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush. Relations did cool significantly in 1974‚Äì1975 over Mobutu's increasingly radical rhetoric (which included his scathing denunciations of American foreign policy),Young and Turner, p. 372 and plummeted to an all-time low in the summer of 1975, when Mobutu accused the Central Intelligence Agency of plotting his overthrow and arrested eleven senior Zairian generals and several civilians, and condemned (in absentia) a former head of the Central Bank (Albert Ndele). However, many people viewed these charges with skepticism; in fact, one of Mobutu's staunchest critics, Nzongola-Ntalaja, speculated that Mobutu invented the plot as an excuse to purge the military of talented officers who might otherwise pose a threat to his rule.Elliot and Dymally, p. 150 In spite of these hindrances, the chilly relationship quickly thawed when both countries found each other supporting the same side during the Angolan Civil War. Because of Mobutu's poor human rights record, the Carter Administration put some distance between itself and the Kinshasa government;''Zaire: A Country Study'', \\"Relations with the United States\\". Lcweb2.loc.gov (30 November 1973). Retrieved on 23 April 2014. even so, Zaire received nearly half the foreign aid Carter allocated to sub-Saharan Africa.Lamb, David (1987) The Africans, Vintage, , p. 46 During the first Shaba invasion, the United States played a relatively inconsequential role; its belated intervention consisted of little more than the delivery of non- lethal supplies. But during the second Shaba invasion, the US played a much more active and decisive role by providing transportation and logistical support to the French and Belgian paratroopers that were deployed to aid Mobutu against the rebels. Carter echoed Mobutu's (unsubstantiated) charges of Soviet and Cuban aid to the rebels, until it was apparent that no hard evidence existed to verify his claims.Young and Turner, p. 389 In 1980, the US House of Representatives voted to terminate military aid to Zaire, but the US Senate reinstated the funds, in response to pressure from Carter and American business interests in Zaire.Elliot and Dymally, p. 88 Mobutu enjoyed a very warm relationship with the Reagan Administration, through financial donations. During Reagan's presidency, Mobutu visited the White House three times, and criticism of Zaire's human rights record by the US was effectively muted. During a state visit by Mobutu in 1983, Reagan praised the Zairian strongman as \\"a voice of good sense and goodwill\\".\\"When He Was King: On the trail of Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's former Kleptocrat-in-Chief\\".

With the Soviet Union gone, there was no longer any reason to support Mobutu as a bulwark against communism. Accordingly, the US and other Western powers began pressuring Mobutu to democratize the regime. Regarding the change in US attitude to his regime, Mobutu bitterly remarked: \\"I am the latest victim of the cold war, no longer needed by the US. The lesson is that my support for American policy counts for nothing.\\"Zagorin, Adam. (24 June 2001) \\"Leaving Fire in His Wake\\". Time. Retrieved on 23 April 2014. In 1993, Mobutu was denied a visa by the US State Department after he sought to visit Washington, D.C. Mobutu also had friends in America outside Washington. Mobutu was befriended by televangelist Pat Robertson, who promised to try to get the State Department to lift its ban on the African leader.Mobutu said to have powerful US friends. New York Amsterdam News. 24 May 1997. In 2011, Time magazine described him as the \\"archetypal African dictator\\". Coalition government In May 1990, due to the ending of the Cold War and a change in the international political climate, as well as economic problems and domestic unrest, Mobutu agreed to end the ban on other political parties. He appointed a transitional government that would lead to promised elections but he retained substantial powers. Following riots in Kinshasa by unpaid soldiers, Mobutu brought opposition figures into a coalition government but he still connived to retain control of the security services and important ministries. Factional divisions led to the creation of two governments in 1993, one pro and one anti-Mobutu. The anti-Mobutu government was headed by Laurent Monsengwo and √âtienne Tshisekedi of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress. The economic situation was still dismal; in 1994 the two groups joined as the High Council of Republic ‚Äì Parliament of Transition (HCR-PT). Mobutu appointed Kengo Wa Dondo, an advocate of austerity and free-market reforms, as prime minister. Mobutu was becoming increasingly physically frail and during one of his absences for medical treatment in Europe, Tutsis captured much of eastern Zaire. Overthrow When Mobutu's government issued an order in November 1996 forcing Tutsis to leave Zaire on penalty of death, the ethnic Tutsis in Zaire,Atzili, Boaz (2012) Good Fences, Bad Neighbors: Border Fixity and International Conflict. University Of Chicago Press. p. 188 known as Banyamulenge, were the focal point of a rebellion. From eastern Zaire, the rebels, aided by foreign government forces under the leadership of President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Rwandan Minister of Defense Paul Kagame launched an offensive to overthrow Mobutu, joining forces with locals opposed to him under Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila as they marched west toward Kinshasa. Burundi and Angola also supported the growing rebellion, which mushroomed into the First Congo War. Ailing with cancer, Mobutu was in Switzerland for treatment,Dipiazza, Francesca Davis (2007) Democratic Republic of Congo in Pictures. Twenty First Century Books. . p. 35 and he was unable to coordinate the resistance which crumbled in front of the march. By mid-1997, Kabila's forces resumed their advance, and the remains of Mobutu's army offered almost no resistance. On 16 May 1997, following failed peace talks held in Pointe-Noire on board the South African Navy ship SAS Outeniqua with Kabila and President of South Africa Nelson Mandela (who chaired the talks), Mobutu fled into exile. Kabila's forces, known as the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL), proclaimed victory the next day. The AFDL would have completely overrun the country far sooner if not for the country's decrepit infrastructure. In most areas, no paved roads existed; the only vehicle paths were irregularly used dirt roads. Zaire was renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Exile and death Mobutu went into temporary exile in Togo, until President Gnassingb√© Eyad√©ma insisted that Mobutu leave the country a few days later. From 23 May 1997 he lived mostly in Rabat, Morocco. He died there on 7 September 1997 from prostate cancer at aged 66. He is buried in an above ground mausoleum at Rabat-Sale-Zemmour-Zaer, in the Christian cemetery known as Cimetiere Europeen. In December 2007, the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of the Congo recommended returning his remains, and interring them in a mausoleum in Zaire, which has not yet taken place. Mobutu remains interred in Morocco.\\"RD Congo: Pour le rapatriement des restes de Mobutu\\", Panapress, 17 December 2007 . On the same day Mobutu fled into exile, Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila became the new president of Congo. He was assassinated in 2001, and succeeded by his son Joseph Kabila. Family Mobutu was married twice. His first wife, Marie-Antoinette Mobutu, died of heart failure on 22 October 1977 in Genolier, Switzerland, at the age of 36. On 1 May 1980, he married his mistress, Bobi Ladawa, on the eve of a visit by Pope John Paul II, thus legitimizing his relationship in the eyes of the Church. Two of his sons from his first marriage died during his lifetime, Nyiwa (d. 16 September 1994) and Konga (d. 1992). Two more died in the years following his death: Kongulu (d. 24 September 1998), and Manda (d. 27 November 2004). His elder son from his second marriage, Nzanga Mobutu Ngbangawe, now the head of the family, was a candidate in the 2006 presidential elections and later served in the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as Minister of State for Agriculture.

In art and literature Mobutu was the subject of the three-part documentary Mobutu, King of Zaire by Thierry Michel. Mobutu was also featured in the feature film Lumumba, directed by Raoul Peck, which detailed the pre-coup and coup years from the perspective of Lumumba. Mobutu featured in the documentary When We Were Kings, which centred around the famed Rumble in the Jungle boxing bout between George Foreman and Muhammad Ali for the 1974 heavyweight championship of the world. The bout took place in Kinshasa during Mobutu's rule. Mobutu also might be considered as the inspiration behind some of the characters in the works of the poetry of Wole Soyinka, the novel A Bend in the River by V. S. Naipaul, and Anthills of the Savannah by Chinua Achebe. William Close, father of actress Glenn Close, was once a personal physician to Mobutu and wrote a book focusing on his service in Zaire. Barbara Kingsolver's 1998 historical novel The Poisonwood Bible depicts the events of the Congo Crisis from a fictional standpoint, featuring the role of Mobutu in the crisis.

According to the most conservative estimates, he stole US$4‚Äì5 billion from his country, and some sources put the figure as high as US$15 billion. According to Mobutu's ex-son-in-law, Pierre Janssen (the ex- husband of Mobutu's daughter Yaki), Mobutu had no concern for the cost of the expensive gifts he gave away to his cronies. Janssen married Yaki in a lavish ceremony that included three orchestras, a US$65,000 wedding cake, and a giant fireworks display. Yaki wore a US$70,000 wedding gown and US$3 million worth of jewels. Janssen wrote a book describing Mobutu's daily routine, which included several daily bottles of wine, retainers flown in from overseas, and lavish meals. According to Transparency International, Mobutu embezzled over US$5 billion from his country, ranking him as the third-most corrupt leader since 1984 and the most corrupt African leader during the same period. Philip Gourevitch, in We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed with Our Families (1998), wrote: Mobutu was instrumental in bringing the Rumble in the Jungle boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman to Zaire on 30 October 1974. According to the documentary When We Were Kings, promoter Don King promised each fighter five million dollars (U.S.) for the fight. To this end, King offered the bout to any African country that put up the money to host it, in exchange for recognition. Mobutu was willing to fund the ten million dollar purse and host the bout, in order to gain international recognition and legitimacy in the process. Mobutu gained Zaire and its people considerable publicity in the weeks even before the televised bout, as worldwide attention focused on his country. According to a quote in the film, Ali supposedly said: \\"Some countries go to war to get their names out there, and wars cost a lot more than ten million (dollars).\\" On 22 September 1974, Mobutu presented the rebuilt 20 May Stadium, a multi-million-dollar sports project constructed to host the Ali-Foreman boxing card, to the Zaire Ministry of Youth and Sport, and to the people of Zaire.

The hypothesis was initially proposed by the marine biologist Alister Hardy in 1960, who argued that a branch of apes was forced by competition over terrestrial habitats to hunt for food such as shellfish on the sea shore and sea bed leading to adaptations that explained distinctive characteristics of modern humans such as functional hairlessness and bipedalism. Elaine Morgan's 1990 book on the hypothesis, Scars of Evolution, received some favorable reviews but was subject to criticism from the anthropologist John Langdon in 1997, who characterized it as an \\"umbrella hypothesis\\" with inconsistencies that were unresolved and a claim to parsimony that was false. The hypothesis has been deprecated as pseudoscience. The hypothesis is thought to be more popular with the lay public than with scientists; in the scientific literature, it is generally ignored by anthropologists. History In 1942 the German pathologist Max Westenh√∂fer (1871‚Äì1957) discussed various human characteristics (hairlessness, subcutaneous fat, the regression of the olfactory organ, webbed fingers, direction of the body hair etc.) that could have derived from an aquatic past, quoting several other authors who had made similar speculations. As he did not believe human beings were apes, he believed this might have been during the Cretaceous, contrary to what is possible given the geologic and evolutionary biology evidence available at the time. He stated: \\"The postulation of an aquatic mode of life during an early stage of human evolution is a tenable hypothesis, for which further inquiry may produce additional supporting evidence.\\" He later abandoned the concept.Westenh√∂fer Max (1948) Die Grundlagen meiner Theorie vom Eigenweg des Menschen: Entwicklung, Menschwerdung, Weltanschauung. Carl Winter Heidelberg. . Independently of Westenh√∂fer's writings, the marine biologist Alister Hardy had since 1930 also hypothesized that humans may have had ancestors more aquatic than previously imagined, although his work, unlike Westenh√∂fer's, was rooted in the Darwinian consensus. On the advice of his colleagues, Hardy delayed presenting the hypothesis for approximately thirty years. After he had become a respected academic and knighted for contributions to marine biology, Hardy finally voiced his thoughts in a speech to the British Sub-Aqua Club in Brighton on 5 March 1960. Several national newspapers reported sensational presentations of Hardy's ideas, which he countered by explaining them more fully in an article in New Scientist on 17 March 1960: \\"My thesis is that a branch of this primitive ape-stock was forced by competition from life in the trees to feed on the sea-shores and to hunt for food, shellfish, sea-urchins etc., in the shallow waters off the coast.\\" The idea was generally ignored by the scientific community after the article was published. Some interest was received, notably from the geographer Carl Sauer whose views on the role of the seashore in human evolution \\"stimulated tremendous progress in the study of coastal and aquatic adaptations\\" inside marine archaeology. In 1967, the hypothesis was mentioned in The Naked Ape, a popular book by the zoologist Desmond Morris, who reduced Hardy's phrase \\"more aquatic ape-like ancestors\\" to the bare \\"aquatic ape\\", commenting that \\"despite its most appealing indirect evidence, the aquatic theory lacks solid support\\". While traditional descriptions of 'savage' existence identified three common sources of sustenance: gathering of fruit and nuts, fishing, and hunting, in the 1950s, the anthropologist Raymond Dart focused on hunting and gathering as the likely organizing concept of human society in prehistory, and hunting was the focus of the screenwriter Robert Ardrey's 1961 best-seller African Genesis. Another screenwriter, Elaine Morgan, responded to this focus in her 1972 Descent of Woman, which parodied the conventional picture of \\"the Tarzanlike figure of the prehominid who came down from the trees, saw a grassland teeming with game, picked up a weapon and became a Mighty Hunter,\\" and pictured a more peaceful scene of humans by the seashore. She took her lead from a section in Morris's 1967 book which referred to the possibility of an Aquatic Ape period in evolution, his name for the speculation by the biologist Alister Hardy in 1960. When it aroused no reaction in the academic community, she dropped the feminist criticism and wrote a series of books‚ÄìThe Aquatic Ape (1982), The Scars of Evolution (1990), The Descent of the Child (1994), The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis (1997) and The Naked Darwinist (2008)‚Äìwhich explored the issues in more detail. Books published on the topic since then have avoided the contentious term aquatic and used waterside instead. The Hardy/Morgan hypothesis Hardy's hypothesis as outlined in the New Scientist was: Hardy argued a number of features of modern humans are characteristic of aquatic adaptations. He pointed to humans' lack of body hair as being analogous to the same lack seen in whales and hippopotamuses,Langdon (1997), p. 483 and noted the layer of subcutaneous fat humans have that Hardy believed other apes lacked, although it has been shown that captive apes with ample access to food have levels of subcutaneous fat similar to humans. Additional features cited by Hardy include the location of the trachea in the throat rather than the nasal cavity, the human propensity for front-facing copulation, tears and eccrine sweating, though these claimed pieces of evidence have alternative evolutionary adaptationist explanations that do not invoke an aquatic context. Hardy additionally posited that bipedalism evolved first as an aid to wading before becoming the usual means of human locomotion,Langdon (1997), p. 481 and tool use evolved out of the use of rocks to crack open shellfish.Langdon (1997), p. 487 These last arguments were cited by later proponents of AAH as an inspiration for their research programs. Morgan summed up her take on the hypothesis in 2011: Reactions Aquatic Ape Conference delegates in Valkenburg, 1987 The AAH is generally ignored by anthropologists, although it has a following outside academia and has received celebrity endorsement, for example from David Attenborough. Academics who have commented on the aquatic ape hypothesis include categorical opponents (generally members of the community of academic anthropology) who reject almost all of the claims related to the hypothesis. Other academics have argued that the rejection of Hardy and Morgan is partially unfair given that other explanations which suffer from similar problems are not so strongly opposed. A conference devoted to the subject was held at Valkenburg, Netherlands in 1987. Its 22 participants included academic proponents and opponents of the hypothesis and several neutral observers headed by the anthropologist Vernon Reynolds of the University of Oxford. His summary at the end was: =Critiques= The AAH is not accepted as empirically supported by the scholarly community, and has been met with significant skepticism. The Nature editor and paleontologist Henry Gee has argued that the hypothesis has equivalent merit to creationism, and should be similarly dismissed. In a 1997 critique, anthropologist John Langdon considered the AAH under the heading of an \\"umbrella hypothesis\\" and argued that the difficulty of ever disproving such a thing meant that although the idea has the appearance of being a parsimonious explanation, it actually was no more powerful an explanation than the null hypothesis that human evolution is not particularly guided by interaction with bodies of water. Langdon argued that however popular the idea was with the public, the \\"umbrella\\" nature of the idea means that it cannot serve as a proper scientific hypothesis. Langdon also objected to Morgan's blanket opposition to the \\"savannah hypothesis\\" which he took to be the \\"collective discipline of paleoanthropology\\". He observed that some anthropologists had regarded the idea as not worth the trouble of a rebuttal. In addition, the evidence cited by AAH proponents mostly concerned developments in soft tissue anatomy and physiology, whilst paleoanthropologists rarely speculated on evolutionary development of anatomy beyond the musculoskeletal system and brain size as revealed in fossils. After a brief description of the issues under 26 different headings, he produced a summary critique of these with mainly negative judgments. His main conclusion was that the AAH was unlikely ever to be disproved on the basis of comparative anatomy, and that the one body of data that could potentially disprove it was the fossil record. Anthropologist John D. Hawks wrote that it is fair to categorize the AAH as pseudoscience because of the social factors that inform it, particularly the personality-led nature of the hypothesis and the unscientific approach of its adherents. Physical anthropologist Eugenie Scott has described the aquatic ape hypothesis as an instance of \\"crank anthropology\\" akin to other pseudoscientific ideas in anthropology such as alien-human interbreeding and Bigfoot. In The Accidental Species: Misunderstandings of Human Evolution (2013), Henry Gee remarked on how a seafood diet can aid in the development of the human brain. He nevertheless criticized the AAH because \\"it's always a problem identifying features [such as body fat and hairlessness] that humans have now and inferring that they must have had some adaptive value in the past.\\" Also \\"it's notoriously hard to infer habits [such as swimming] from anatomical structures\\". Popular support for the AAH has become an embarrassment to some anthropologists who want to explore the effects of water on human evolution without engaging with the AAH, which they consider \\"emphasizes adaptations to deep water (or at least underwater) conditions\\". Foley and Lahr suggest that \\"to flirt with anything watery in paleoanthropology can be misinterpreted\\", but argue \\"there is little doubt that throughout our evolution we have made extensive use of terrestrial habitats adjacent to fresh water, since we are, like many other terrestrial mammals, a heavily water-dependent species.\\" But they allege that \\"under pressure from the mainstream, AAH supporters tended to flee from the core arguments of Hardy and Morgan towards a more generalized emphasis on fishy things.\\" In \\"The Waterside Ape\\", a pair of 2016 BBC Radio documentaries, David Attenborough discussed what he thought was a \\"move towards mainstream acceptance\\" for the AAH in the light of new research findings. He interviewed scientists supportive of the idea including Kathlyn Stewart and Michael Crawford who had published papers in a special issue of the Journal of Human EvolutionJournal of Human Evolution Volume 77, Pages 1-216 (December 2014) on \\"The Role of Freshwater and Marine Resources in the Evolution of the Human Diet, Brain and Behavior\\". Responding to the documentaries in a newspaper article, paleoanthropologist Alice Roberts criticized Attenborough's promotion of AAH and dismissed the idea as a distraction \\"from the emerging story of human evolution that is more interesting and complex\\". She argued that AAH had become \\"a theory of everything\\" that is simultaneously \\"too extravagant and too simple\\".\\"It's time we let go of the 'aquatic ape' myth.\\" The i Newspaper, 17 September 2016, page 23 Philosopher Daniel Dennett, in his discussion of evolutionary philosophy, commented \\"During the last few years, when I have found myself in the company of distinguished biologists, evolutionary theorists, paleoanthropologists and other experts, I have often asked them to tell me, please, exactly why Elaine Morgan must be wrong about the aquatic theory. I haven‚Äôt yet had a reply worth mentioning, aside from those who admit, with a twinkle in their eyes, that they have also wondered the same thing.\\" He challenged both Elaine Morgan and the scientific establishment in that \\"Both sides are indulging in adapt[at]ionist Just So stories\\". Along the same lines, historian Erika Lorraine Milam noted that independent of Morgan's work, certain standard explanations of human development in paleoanthropology have been roundly criticized for lacking evidence while being based on sexist assumptions. Anatomy lecturer Bruce Charlton gave Morgan's book Scars of Evolution an enthusiastic review in the British Medical Journal in 1991, calling it \\"exceptionally well written\\" and \\"a good piece of science\\". In 1995, paleoanthropologist Phillip Tobias declared that the savannah hypothesis was dead, because the open conditions did not exist when humanity's precursors stood upright and that therefore the conclusions of the Valkenberg conference were no longer valid. Tobias praised Morgan's book Scars of Evolution as a \\"remarkable book\\" though he said that he did not agree with all of it. in Tobias and his student further criticised the orthodox hypothesis by arguing that the coming out of the forest of man's precursors had been an unexamined assumption of evolution since the days of Lamarck, and followed by Darwin, Wallace and Haeckel, well before Raymond Dart used it. = Reactions of Hardy and Morgan = Alister Hardy was astonished and mortified in 1960 when the national Sunday papers carried banner headlines \\"Oxford professor says man a sea ape\\", causing problems with his Oxford colleagues. As he later said to his ex-pupil Desmond Morris, \\"Of course I then had to write an article to refute this saying no this is just a guess, a rough hypothesis, this isn't a proven fact. And of course we're not related to dolphins.\\" Elaine Morgan's 1972 book Descent of Woman became an international best-seller, a Book of the Month selection in the United States and was translated into ten languages. The book was praised for its feminism but paleoanthropologists were disappointed with its promotions of the AAH. Morgan removed the feminist critique and left her AAH ideas intact, publishing the book as The Aquatic Ape 10 years later, but it did not garner any more positive reaction from scientists. Related academic and independent research Although the general reaction to Hardy and Morgan's proposals was silence by the relevant academic community, there have been over the last decades some academics who were inspired by AAH proposals, even to the point of pursuing particular lines of research on its basis. Some of the academics and professional scientists who have supported the AAH include Michael Crawford, Professor and Director of the Institute of Brain Chemistry and Human Nutrition at Imperial College London, his former postdoctoral researcher, Stephen Cunnane, now professor of medicine at Universit√© de Sherbrooke, Erika Schagatay, professor of Environmental Physiology at Mid Sweden University, Kathlyn M. Stewart, Section Head of Palaeobiology at the Canadian Museum of Nature, and Tom Brenna, Professor of Paediatrics and Chemistry at University of Texas. =Wading and bipedalism= AAH proponent Algis Kuliukas, performed experiments to measure the comparative energy used when lacking orthograde posture with using fully upright posture. Although it is harder to walk upright with bent knees on land, this difference gradually diminishes as the depth of water increases and is still practical in thigh-high water. In a critique of the AAH, Henry Gee questioned any link between bipedalism and diet. Gee writes that early humans have been bipedal for 5 million years, but our ancestors' \\"fondness for seafood\\" emerged a mere 200,000 years ago. =Diet= Neanderthal skull (right) compared with modern human Evidence supports aquatic food consumption in Homo as early as the Pliocene, but its linkage to brain evolution remains controversial. Further, there is no evidence that humans ate fish in significant amounts earlier than tens to hundreds of thousands of years ago. Supporters argue that the avoidance of taphonomic bias is the problem, as most hominin fossils occur in lake-side environments, and the presence of fish remains is therefore not proof of fish consumption. They also claim that the archaeological record of human fishing and coastal settlement is fundamentally flawed due to postglacial sea level rise. In their 1989 book The Driving Force: Food, Evolution and The Future, Michael Crawford and David Marsh claimed that omega-3 fatty acids were vital for the development of the brain: Crawford and Marsh opined that the brain size in aquatic mammals is similar to humans, and that other primates and carnivores lost relative brain capacity. Cunnane, Stewart, Crawford, and colleagues published works arguing a correlation between aquatic diet and human brain evolution in their \\"shore-based diet scenario\\", acknowledging the Hardy/Morgan's thesis as a foundation work of their model. in As evidence, they describe health problems in landlocked communities, such as cretinism in the Alps and goitre in parts of Africa due to salt-derived iodine deficiency, in and state that inland habitats cannot naturally meet human iodide requirements. Biologists Caroline Pond and Dick Colby were highly critical, saying that the work provided \\"no significant new information that would be of interest to biologists\\" and that its style was \\"speculative, theoretical and in many places so imprecise as to be misleading.\\" British palaeontologist Henry Gee, who remarked on how a seafood diet can aid in the development of the human brain, nevertheless criticized AAH because inferring aquatic behavior from body fat and hairlessness patterns is an unjustifiable leap. =Diving behavior and performance= Aside from working as a professor, Erika Schagatay is also an experienced scuba and freediver whose research centers around human diving abilities. She suggests that such abilities are consistent with selective pressure for underwater foraging during human evolution, and discussed other anatomical traits speculated as diving adaptations by Hardy/Morgan. in John Langdon suggested that such traits could be enabled by a human developmental plasticity. = Vernix caseosa = Tom Brenna, professor of pediatrics whose primary research focuses on fats, oils, and fatty acids, listened to the 2005 radio documentary Scars of Evolution where David Attenborough reported an observation that harbor seals were born with something that resembled human vernix caseosa. Intrigued, Brenna led a team that collaborated with Judy St Leger at San Diego Seaworld to compare the chemistry of human vernix and samples from California sea lion pups. They established that the molecular composition of both is similar, being rich in branched chain fatty acids and squalene.

R'lyeh is a sunken city in the South Pacific and the prison of the entity called Cthulhu. Description R'lyeh is characterized by bizarre architecture likened to non-Euclidean geometry. Norwegian sailor Gustaf Johansen, the narrator of one of the tales in the short story, describes the accidental discovery of the city: \\"a coast-line of mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of earth's supreme terror‚Äîthe nightmare corpse-city of R'lyeh...loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours\\".H. P. Lovecraft, \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" (1928) The short story also asserts the premise that while currently trapped in R'lyeh, Cthulhu will eventually return, with worshipers often repeating the phrase Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn: \\"In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming\\". Lovecraft claims R'lyeh is located at in the southern Pacific Ocean. Writer August Derleth, a contemporary correspondent of Lovecraft, placed R'lyeh at .Derleth, A. The Black Island (1952) The latter coordinates place the city approximately from the actual island of Pohnpei (Ponape), the location of the fictional \\"Ponape Scripture\\".

Lovecraft and first introduced in the short story \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\", published in the American pulp magazine Weird Tales in 1928. Considered a Great Old One within the pantheon of Lovecraftian cosmic entities, the creature has since been featured in numerous popular culture references. Lovecraft depicts it as a gigantic entity worshipped by cultists, in shape like an octopus, a dragon, and a caricature of human form. Its name was given to the Lovecraft-inspired universe where it and its fellow entities existed, the Cthulhu Mythos. Etymology, spelling, and pronunciation Invented by Lovecraft in 1928, the name Cthulhu was probably chosen to echo the word chthonic (Classical Greek \\"of the earth\\"), as apparently suggested by Lovecraft himself at the end of his 1923 tale \\"The Rats in the Walls\\". Lovecraft transcribed the pronunciation of Cthulhu as Khl√ªl‚Ä≤-hloo and said that \\"the first syllable pronounced gutturally and very thickly. The u is about like that in full; and the first syllable is not unlike klul in sound, hence the h represents the guttural thickness.\\" (See the discussion linked below.) S. T. Joshi points out, however, that Lovecraft gave several differing pronunciations on different occasions. According to Lovecraft, this is merely the closest that the human vocal apparatus can come to reproducing the syllables of an alien language.\\"Cthul-Who?: How Do You Pronounce 'Cthulhu'?\\", Crypt of Cthulhu #9 Cthulhu has also been spelled in many other ways, including Tulu, Katulu and Kutulu. The name is often preceded by the epithet Great, Dead, or Dread. Long after Lovecraft's death, the spelling pronunciation became common. Others use the pronunciation Katulu/Kutulu E.g. the video game Call of Cthulhu and season 14 of South Park. Description In \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\", H. P. Lovecraft describes a statue of Cthulhu as \\"A monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery- looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind.\\"s:The Call of Cthulhu Cthulhu is said to resemble an octopus, a dragon and a human caricature, hundreds of meters tall, with webbed human-looking arms and legs and a pair of rudimentary wings on its back. Its head is depicted as similar to the entirety of a gigantic octopus, with an unknown number of tentacles surrounding its supposed mouth. Publication history \\"To R.H. Barlow, Esq., whose sculpture hath given immortality to this trivial design of his obliged obedient servant, H.P. Lovecraft\\". The short story that first mentions Cthulhu, \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\", was published in Weird Tales in 1928 and established the character as a malevolent entity, hibernating within R'lyeh, an underwater city in the South Pacific. The imprisoned Cthulhu is apparently the source of constant subconscious anxiety for all mankind, and is also the object of worship, both by a number of human cults (including in New Zealand, Greenland, Louisiana, and the Chinese mountains) and by other Lovecraftian monsters (called Deep Oness:The Shadow Over Innsmouth and Mi- Gos:The Whisperer in Darkness). The short story asserts the premise that, while currently trapped, Cthulhu will eventually return. His worshippers chant \\"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn (\\"In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.\\"). Lovecraft conceived a detailed genealogy for Cthulhu (published as \\"Letter 617\\" in Selected Letters) and made the character a central reference in his works. The short story \\"The Dunwich Horror\\" (1928)s:The Dunwich Horror refers to Cthulhu, while \\"The Whisperer in Darkness\\" (1930) hints that one of his characters knows the creature's origins (\\"I learned whence Cthulhu first came, and why half the great temporary stars of history had flared forth.\\"). The 1931 novella At the Mountains of Madness refers to the \\"star-spawn of Cthulhu\\", who warred with another race called the Elder Things before the dawn of man. August Derleth, a correspondent of Lovecraft, used the creature's name to identify the system of lore employed by Lovecraft and his literary successors: the Cthulhu Mythos. In 1937, Derleth wrote the short story \\"The Return of Hastur\\", and proposed two groups of opposed cosmic entities: According to Derleth's scheme, \\"Great Cthulhu is one of the Water Elementals\\" and was engaged in an age-old arch-rivalry with a designated air elemental, Hastur the Unspeakable, described as Cthulhu's \\"half-brother\\". Based on this framework, Derleth wrote a series of short stories published in Weird Tales (1944‚Äì1952) and collected as The Trail of Cthulhu, depicting the struggle of a Dr. Laban Shrewsbury and his associates against Cthulhu and his minions. In addition, Cthulhu is referenced in Derleth‚Äòs 1945 novel ‚ÄúThe Lurker at the Threshold‚Äù published by Arkham House. The novel can also be found in ‚ÄúThe Watchers Out of Time and Others‚Äù, a collection of stories from Derleth‚Äôs interpretations of Lovecraftian Mythos published by Arkham House in 1974. Derleth's interpretations have been criticized by Lovecraft enthusiast Michel Houellebecq, among others. Houellebecq's H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life (2005) decries Derleth for attempting to reshape Lovecraft's strictly amoral continuity into a stereotypical conflict between forces of objective good and evil. In John Glasby's \\"A Shadow from the Aeons\\", Cthulhu is seen by the narrator roaming the riverbank near Dominic Waldron's castle, and roaring. The god appears totally different from its depiction by other authors. The character's influence also extended into gaming literature: games company TSR included an entire chapter on the Cthulhu mythos (including statistics for the character) in the first printing of Dungeons & Dragons sourcebook Deities & Demigods (1980). TSR, however, were unaware that Arkham House, which asserted copyright on almost all Lovecraft literature, had already licensed the Cthulhu property to the game company Chaosium. Although Chaosium stipulated that TSR could continue to use the material if each future edition featured a published credit to Chaosium, TSR refused and the material was removed from all subsequent editions. Legacy =Games= In 1981, Chaosium released their role-playing game Call of Cthulhu. It has now reached its 7th edition with a large amount of supplementary material also available, and has won several major gaming awards. In 1987 Chaosium published the co-operative adventure board game Arkham Horror, based on the same background, which has since been reissued by other publishers. In 2006, Bethesda Softworks, Ubisoft, and 2K Games jointly published a game by Headfirst Productions, Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth, based on the works of Lovecraft. Cthulhu himself does not appear, as the main antagonists of the game are the Deep Ones from The Shadow Over Innsmouth, and the sea god Dagon, but his presence is alluded to several times, and viewing a statue of him in one of the temples will undermine the player's sanity. Also, one of Cthulhu's Star Spawn, of similar hideous appearance, appears as a late-game enemy. On March 19, 2007, Steve Jackson Games released an iteration of their card game Munchkin called Munchkin Cthulhu. The game presents Cthulhu and its surrounding mythos with a cartoon art style and comedic tone, heavily playing upon themes of madness and cultism. Great Cthulhu features as a standalone monster in the deck, alongside various parodies of Lovecraft's creatures. Cthulhu is depicted as an overweight, bright green creature with a large, bulbous head, and a pair of disproportionately small wings. In the Ukrainian video game series S.T.A.L.K.E.R., there is a Cthulhu-inspired mutant called Bloodsucker. Cthulhu is the main inspiration for the zombies in the video game Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. The massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft has numerous references to Cthulhu and the Mythos, with one of the game's \\"Old Gods\\" named N'Zoth resting in a sunken city. In Scribblenauts (2009), Cthulhu is summonable. He is much smaller than described in Lovecraft's works but is much stronger than most other aggressive objects. Terraria (2011) refers to Cthulhu in three boss fights: the Eye of Cthulhu, Brain of Cthulhu, and the final boss Moon Lord, implied to be Cthulhu himself. In 2016, Z-Man Games released an alternate version of the board game Pandemic. This new adaptation, Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu, is set in the Cthulhu Mythos and explorers race to save the world before Cthulhu returns. In 2018, a survival horror role-playing video game called Call of Cthulhu: The Official Video Game was developed for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows PC. In June of 2019, an open-world horror detective game called The Sinking City, which is based on Cthulhu Mythos was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It was also released for Nintendo Switch in September of that year. In 2020, Cthulhu was released as a playable character in the MOBA Smite. =Politics= Poster from the 2010 Polish presidential election. The caption translates as \\"Choose the greater evil. Vote Cthulhu.\\" Cthulhu has appeared as a parody candidate in several elections, including the 2010 Polish presidential election as well as the 2012 and 2016 US presidential elections. The faux campaigns usually satirize voters who claim to vote for the \\"lesser evil\\". In 2016 the Troll account known as \\"The Dark Lord Cthulhu\\" submitted an official application to be on the Massachusetts Presidential Ballot. The account also raised over $4000 from fans to fund the campaign through a gofundme.com page. Gofundme removed the campaign page and refunded contributions. The Cthulhu Party (UK), another pseudo-political organisation, claim to be 'Changing Politics for Evil', parodying the Brexit Party's 'Changing Politics for Good'; a member of The Cthulhu Party holds the position of Mayor of Blists Hill. Another organisation, Cthulhu for America, ran during the 2016 American presidential election, drawing comparisons with other satirical presidential candidates like Vermin Supreme. The organisation had a platform which included the legalisation of human sacrifice, driving all Americans insane, and an end to peace. =Science= The Californian spider species Pimoa cthulhu, described by Gustavo Hormiga in 1994, and the New Guinea moth species Speiredonia cthulhui, described by Alberto Zilli and Jeremy D. Holloway in 2005, are named after Cthulhu. Two microorganisms that assist in the digestion of wood by termites have been named after Cthulhu and Cthulhu's \\"daughter\\" Cthylla: Cthulhu macrofasciculumque and Cthylla microfasciculumque. In 2014, science and technology scholar Donna Haraway gave a talk entitled \\"Anthropocene, Capitalocene, Chthulucene: Staying with the Trouble\\", in which she proposed the term \\"Chthulucene\\" as an alternative for the concept of the Anthropocene era, due to the entangling interconnectedness of all supposedly individual beings. Haraway has denied any indebtedness to Lovecraft's Cthulhu, claiming that her \\"chthulu\\" is derived from Greek khthonios, \\"of the earth\\". However, the Lovecraft character is much closer to her coined term than the Greek root, and her description of its meaning coincides with Lovecraft's idea of the apocalyptic, multi-tentacled threat of Cthulhu to collapse civilization into an endless dark horror: \\"Chthulucene does not close in on itself; it does not round off; its contact zones are ubiquitous and continuously spin out loopy tendrils.\\" In 2015, an elongated, dark region along the equator of Pluto, initially referred to as \\"the Whale\\", was proposed to be named \\"Cthulhu Regio\\", by the NASA team responsible for the New Horizons mission. It is now known as \\"Cthulhu Macula\\". In April 2019, Imran A. Rahman and a team announced in Proceedings of the Royal Society B the discovery of Sollasina cthulhu, an extinct member of the ophiocistioids group. = Film and TV = Several films and television programs feature the threat of Cthulhu returning to dominate the Universe. A notable example is three episodes of the adult cartoon series South Park in which Eric Cartman turns out to be so irredeemably evil that he is able to tame Cthulhu and direct him to annihilate personal enemies. In those episodes (\\"Coon 2: Hindsight\\", \\"Mysterion Rises\\", and \\"Coon vs. Coon & Friends\\") Cthulhu is faithfully represented as the monstrous tentacle-mouthed god-like being Lovecraft describes. In the popular adult animated science- fiction sitcom Rick and Morty, a depiction of Cthulhu can be seen in the opening sequence, immediately prior to the title card. In Cartoon Network's animated show The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, Cthulhu has a dedicated double-length episode called \\"Prank Call of Cthulhu\\". Cthulhu also made a short appearance at the beginning of The Simpsons episode \\"Treehouse of Horror XXIX\\". In season 2 episodes 18 and 19 of Gravity Falls, Cthulhu is briefly seen destroying a giant ear with a mouth-laser and then walking, respectively. On October 27, 1987, Cthulhu appeared in season 2 episode 28 of The Real Ghostbusters animated cartoon entitled \\"The Collect Call of Cathulhu\\", in which the Ghostbusters went up against the Spawn, and Cult, of Cthulhu. Cthulhu is featured in Arcana Studio's Howard Lovecraft animated trilogy beginning with Howard Lovecraft and the Frozen Kingdom, and ending with the upcoming Kingdom of Madness. The Call of Cthulhu is a 2005 independent silent- film adaptation of the eponymous short story, produced by Sean Branney and Andrew Leman. Cast a Deadly Spell is a 1991 noir film featuring private detective H. Philip Lovecraft, in a fictional Los Angeles where magic is real, monsters and mythical beasts stalk the back alleys, zombies are used as cheap labor, and everyone‚Äîexcept Lovecraft‚Äîuses magic every day. The plot revolves around a scheme to use a copy of the Necronomicon to summon an ancient god that might be Cthulhu. The 2007 film Cthulhu is loosely based on Lovecraft's 1936 novella The Shadow over Innsmouth, which is a part of the Cthulhu Mythos. The creatures in the 2018 Netflix film Bird Box are strongly implied to be related to Cthulhu. Cthulhu appears in season 4 episode 7 of The Venture Bros., battling The Order of the Triad. Cthulhu appears in season 2 episode 14 of Night Gallery, Professor Peabody's Last Lecture. Cthulhu appears in the climax of the film Underwater, worshipped by a civilisation of underwater humanoids. Cthulhu, or at least his star-spawn, are set to appear in Lovecraft Country. = Music = Heavy metal band Metallica reference Cthulhu in the song \\"Dream No More\\" from their 2016 album Hardwired... To Self-Destruct, as well as on the 1984 album Ride the Lightning with the instrumental track \\"The Call of Ktulu\\", inspired by H. P. Lovecraft's novella The Shadow over Innsmouth, which was introduced to the rest of the band by Cliff Burton, and on the 1986 album Master of Puppets with the song \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" (whose lyrics are inspired by The Shadow over Innsmouth and contain partial quotes from \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\"). The fifth studio album by Canadian electronic music producer deadmau5 features the song \\"Cthulhu Sleeps\\". American Metal band The Acacia Strain features a song titled \\"Cthulhu\\" on their album \\"Continent\\" The second album of British steampunk band The Men That Will Not Be Blamed for Nothing features the song \\"Margate Fhtagn\\". The song describes the band's meeting with Cthulhu while on holiday in Margate. English extreme metal band Cradle of Filth's fourth album, Midian, features a song titled \\"Cthulhu Dawn\\", although the lyrics seem to have nothing to do with Lovecraft's sea-monster. The song \\"Last Exit for the Lost\\" by British gothic rock band Fields of the Nephilim references Cthulhu (or 'Kthulhu' as it is spelled on the album's inner sleeve).Fields of the Nephilim, The Nephilim album, released 1988 by Situation Two/Beggars Banquet Records The British progressive rock band CARAVAN released the song \\"C'Thlu Thlu\\" on the album For Girls Who Grow Plump in the Night (1973). The penultimate track on the 2011 self-titled debut album by New Zealand sludge metal band Beastwars is titled \\"Cthulhu\\". The album \\"Stairway To Valhalla\\" by Nanowar of Steel features a song titled \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\". The song \\"Cthulhu\\" by German power metal and \\"SUPERHEROMETAL\\" band Grailknights mentions the city of Rlyeh.

Its major markets are the United States, Canada, and China. Cadillac models are distributed in 34 additional markets worldwide. Cadillac automobiles are at the top of the luxury field within the United States. In 2019, Cadillac sold 390,458 vehicles worldwide, a record for the brand. Cadillac is among the first automobile brands in the world, second in the United States only to fellow GM marque Buick. The firm was founded from the remnants of the Henry Ford Company in 1902. It was named after Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, who founded Detroit, Michigan. The Cadillac crest is based on his coat of arms. By the time General Motors purchased the company in 1909, Cadillac had already established itself as one of America's premier luxury car makers. The complete interchangeability of its precision parts had allowed it to lay the foundation for the modern mass production of automobiles. It was at the forefront of technological advances, introducing full electrical systems, the clashless manual transmission and the steel roof. The brand developed three engines, with its V8 setting the standard for the American automotive industry. Cadillac had the first U.S. car to win the Royal Automobile Club of the United Kingdom's Dewar Trophy by successfully demonstrating the interchangeability of its component parts during a reliability test in 1908; this spawned the firm's slogan \\"Standard of the World\\". It won the trophy again in 1912 for incorporating electric starting and lighting in a production automobile. Early history =Founding= Cadillac was formed from the remnants of the Henry Ford Company. After a dispute between Henry Ford and his investors, Ford left the company along with several of his key partners in March 1902. Ford's financial backers William Murphy and Lemuel Bowen called in engineer Henry M. Leland of Leland & Faulconer Manufacturing Company to appraise the plant and equipment in preparation for liquidating the company's assets. Instead, Leland persuaded the pair to continue manufacturing automobiles using Leland's proven single-cylinder engine. A new company called the Cadillac Automobile Company was established on 22 August 1902, re- purposing the Henry Ford Company factory at Cass Street and Amsterdam Avenue. It was named after French explorer Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac, who had founded Detroit in 1701.Granzo T History of Detroit =First automobiles= Cadillac's first automobiles, the Runabout and Tonneau, were completed in October 1902. They were two-seat horseless carriages powered by a single-cylinder engine. They were practically identical to the 1903 Ford Model A. Many sources say the first car rolled out of the factory on 17 October; in the book Henry Leland‚ÄîMaster of Precision, the date is 20 October; another reliable source shows car number three to have been built on 16 October. Cadillac displayed the new vehicles at the New York Auto Show in January 1903, where the vehicles impressed the crowds enough to gather over 2,000 firm orders. Cadillac's biggest selling point was precision manufacturing, and therefore, reliability; a Cadillac was simply a better-made vehicle than its competitors. :;Runabout File:Cadillac Model A 1902 (6829591487).jpg1902 File:Cadillac 1904 6.5 HP Rear-entrance tonneau on London to Brighton VCR 2010.jpg6¬Ω HP 1904 File:Cadillac K (1907) at Autoworld Brussels (8394291773).jpg1907 File:Cadillac Model K Runabout (6037133022).jpg1907 File:1908 Cadillac Model S runabout (6105143017).jpg1908 with dickey seat open File:1908 Cadillac Model S Tulip Roadster, Medow Brook Concours 2005.jpg1908 Cadillac Model S :;Rear-entrance tonneau File:Cadi-1903.jpg1903 File:Cadillac 1903 Rear Entrance Tonneau Auto on London to Brighton Veteran Car Run 2009.jpg6¬Ω HP 1903 File:Cadillac 8.25 HP Tonneau 1904 07-11-2010 14-17-57.JPG8¬º HP 1904 File:Cadillac 1904 Tonneau on London to Brighton VCR 2010.jpg8¬º HP surrey-top 1904 File:Cadillac 10HP Tonneau 1904 03-11-2013 08-32-24.jpg10 HP 1904 :;Special bodies Cadillac Special Delivery 19040220.jpgDelivery 1903 File:Cadillac 1904 8.25 HP tonneau on London to Brighton VCR 2010.jpg8¬Ω HP touring car 1904 File:Cadillac 1904 8.25 HP Detachable-Top Limousine on London to Brighton VCR 2010 15-39-05.jpg8¬º HP Detachable-top limousine 1904 File:Cadillac 9HP Limousine 07-11-2010 15-52-37.JPG9 HP limousine Cadillac 1907 Model M Coupe.jpgModel M Coup√© 1907 =Notable events: 1906‚Äì1912= The Cadillac Automobile Company merged with Leland & Faulconer Manufacturing, forming The Cadillac Motor Company in 1905.\\"Cadillac: A Century of Excellence\\" by Rob Leicester Wagner () From its earliest years, Cadillac aimed for precision engineering and stylish luxury finishes, causing its cars to be ranked amongst the finest in the United States. Cadillac was the first volume manufacturer of a fully enclosed car, in 1906. Cadillac participated in the 1908 interchangeability test in the United Kingdom, and was awarded the Dewar Trophy for the most important advancement of the year in the automobile industry. In 1909, Cadillac was purchased by the General Motors (GM) conglomerate. Cadillac became General Motors' prestige division, devoted to the production of large luxury vehicles. The Cadillac line was also GM's default marque for \\"commercial chassis\\" institutional vehicles, such as limousines, ambulances, hearses and funeral home flower cars, the last three of which were custom-built by aftermarket manufacturers. It became positioned at the top of GM's vehicle hierarchy, above Buick, Oldsmobile, Oakland, and later, Chevrolet. In 1912, Cadillac was the first automobile manufacturer to incorporate an electrical system enabling starting, ignition, and lighting. =Becoming the \\"Standard of the World\\" and the Great Depression: 1915‚Äì1941= 1921 Cadillac logo In 1915, Cadillac introduced a 90-degree flathead V8 engine with at 2400 rpm and of torque, allowing its cars to attain . This was faster than most roads could accommodate at this time. Cadillac pioneered the dual-plane V8 crankshaft in 1918. In 1928 Cadillac introduced the first clashless Synchro-Mesh manual transmission, utilizing constant mesh gears. In 1930 Cadillac implemented the first V16 engine, with a 45-degree overhead valve, , and , one of the most powerful and quietest engines in the United States. The development and introduction of the V8, V16 and V12 helped to make Cadillac the \\"Standard of the World\\". A later model of the V8 engine, with overhead valves, set the standard for the entire American automotive industry in 1949. In July 1917, the United States Army needed a dependable staff car and chose the Cadillac Type 55 Touring Model after exhaustive tests on the Mexican border. 2,350 of the cars were supplied for use in France by officers of the American Expeditionary Force in World War I.Bentley, John The Old Car Book, Fawcett Books (1952) p 12 A 1921 Cadillac advertisement General Motors of Canada had built Cadillacs from 1923 until 1936 and LaSalles from 1927 until 1935.GM Heritage Center, http://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/Canada_Only_General_Motors_Cars Pre-World War II Cadillacs were well-built, powerful, mass-produced luxury cars aimed at an upper-class market. In the 1930s, Cadillac added cars with V12 and V16 engines to their range, many of which were fitted with custom coach-built bodies. In the 1920s and 1930s Cadillac and Buick vehicles were popular with longer-distance passenger service operators e.g. the Nairn Transport Company in the Middle East (Baghdad-Damascus) and Newmans Coach Lines in New Zealand. In 1926, Cadillac recruited automobile stylist Harley Earl in a one-time consulting capacity, but his employment lasted considerably longer: by 1928, Earl was the head of the new Art and Color division and he would ultimately work for GM until he retired, over 30 years later. The first car he designed was the LaSalle, a new, smaller \\"companion marque\\" car, named after another French explorer and founder of Detroit, Ren√© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. That marque remained in production until 1940. Cadillac introduced designer-styled bodywork (as opposed to auto-engineered) in 1927. It installed shatter-resistant glass in 1926. Cadillac also introduced the \\"turret top\\", the first all-steel roof on a passenger car. Previously, car roofs had been made out of fabric-covered wood. The Great Depression sapped the auto industry generally, with the luxury market declining more steeply; between 1928 and 1933, Cadillac sales declined by 84% to 6,736 vehicles.Gordon, John Steele Exacerbating sales performance for the Cadillac brand was a policy, reflective of the times, which discouraged sales to African Americans.Gordon. Nick Dreystadt, mechanic and national head of Cadillac service, urged a committee‚Äîset up to decide whether the Cadillac brand would live on‚Äîto revoke that policy. After the policy was eliminated, brand sales increased by 70% in 1934, and Dreystadt was promoted to lead the entire Cadillac Division. By 1940, Cadillac sales had risen tenfold compared to 1934. In 1936, Dreystadt released the Series 60 as Cadillac's entry into the mid-priced vehicle market. It was replaced by the Series 61 in 1939, but a popular model that was derived from it, the Sixty Special, continued through 1993. Another factor helped boost Cadillac growth over the next few years: a revolution in assembly line technology. In 1934, Henry F. Phillips introduced the Phillips screw and screwdriver to the market. He entered into talks with General Motors and convinced the Cadillac group his new screws would speed assembly times and therefore increase profits. Cadillac was the first automaker to use the Phillips technology, in 1937, which was widely adopted in 1940. For the first time in many years all cars built by the company shared the same basic engine and drivetrain in 1941.Bonsall, p. 17 1941 also saw introduction of optional Hydra-Matic, the first mass-produced fully automatic transmission, offered the previous year on the Oldsmobile.

Incorporating many of the ideas of then General Motors styling chief Harley J. Earl, these included tailfins, wraparound windshields, and extensive use of chrome. Tailfins were first added in 1948 and reached their pinnacle in 1959. From 1960 to 1964 they decreased each year until they disappeared in the 1965 model year (remaining vestigialy only on the limited production 1965 Series 75 chassis, a carry-over from 1964). Cadillac's other distinctive styling attribute was its front-bumper. What had started out after the war as a pair of artillery shell-shaped bumper guards moved higher on the front-end design as the 1950s wore on. Becoming known as Dagmar bumpers for their similarity to the buxom 1950s television personality, they were toned down in 1958 and gone the next year. 1956 saw the introduction of the pillarless four-door hardtop sedan, marketed as the \\"Sedan de Ville\\"; a year later the feature appeared in all standard Cadillacs. The fledgling automotive magazine Motor Trend awarded its first \\"Motor Trend Car of the Year\\" to Cadillac in 1949 for its innovative overhead valve V8 engine. While the company initially snubbed the honor, it now proudly references its \\"Car of the Year\\" wins in publicity material.Flory, J. \\"Kelly\\", Jr. American Cars 1946‚Äì1959 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2008), p. 190. On 25 November 1949, Cadillac produced its one-millionth car, a 1950 Coupe de Ville.Flory, p. 255. It also set a new sales mark of 100,000 cars, matched in 1950 and 1951.Flory, p.323. 1949 also saw the introduction with Buick of the first mass-produced hardtop coupe, a closed-body style without a \\"B\\" pillar. Marketed as the Coupe de Ville, it would become one of Cadillac's most popular models for many years. In 1951, Cadillac began production of the M41 Walker Bulldog army tank, which saw service in the Korean and Vietnam wars. In 1953, the \\"Autronic Eye\\" was introduced. This feature would automatically dim high-beam headlamps for the safety of oncoming motorists.80 Years of Cadillac LaSalle by Walter M.P. McCall, Motorbooks International, Osceola WI, 1992, p. 298 In 1957, Cadillac attempted to move further upmarket, creating the hand-built Series 70 Eldorado Brougham. It featured self-levelling suspension, \\"memory seat\\" function, and an all- transistor signal-seeking car radio that was produced by GM's Delco Radio and which was available as standard equipment for the 1957 Eldorado Brougham models.1956 GM Year-End Annual Report, 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham car model introduction announcement, pg 15Radio & TV News, August 1957, \\"Delco's All-Transistor Auto Radio\\", pg 60The Cadillac Serviceman, Volume XXXI, No.4, April 1957 issue, Pg 34 While the car showed Cadillac's technological prowess, it sold only 904 units. =Pinnacles in Luxury & Dimension: 1960‚Äì1976= The dual-reservoir brake master cylinder, with separate front and rear hydraulic systems, was introduced in 1962, six years ahead of the Federal requirement. The first fully automatic heater-air conditioning system also appeared, as did the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission; it would become the GM standard model for several decades. From the late 1960s, Cadillac offered a fiber-optic warning system to alert the driver to failed light bulbs. The use of extensive bright-work on the exterior and interior also decreased each year after 1959. By the 1966 model year, even the rear bumpers ceased to be all chrome‚Äîlarge portions were painted, including the headlight bezels. In 1966, Cadillac had its best annual sales yet, over 192,000 units (142,190 of them de Villes), an increase of more than 60%.Flory, p. 423 This was exceeded in 1968, when Cadillac topped 200,000 units for the first time.Flory, p. 570. Karl Ludvigsen's \\"Cadillac: The Great American Dream Come True\\", in Northey, Tom, ed. World of Automobiles (London: Orbis, 1974), Vol. 3, p. 297, mistakenly dates this to 1967. 1967 and 1968 saw the introduction of a host of federally mandated safety features, including energy-absorbing steering columns and wheels, soft interior and instrument panel knobs and surfaces, front shoulder belts, and side marker lights. The front-wheel-drive Eldorado was launched in 1967, setting a new standard for a personal luxury car. Its simple, elegant design was a far cry from the tailfin and chrome excesses of the 1950s. Cadillac's success grew against rivals Lincoln and Imperial, which had division sales topping all of Chrysler for the first time in 1970.Flory, p. 721. The new engine that debuted in the 1968 model year, designed for an ultimate capacity potential of , was increased to for the 1970 Eldorado. It was adopted across the model range beginning in 1975. Driver and front passenger airbags (\\"Air Cushion Restraint System\\") began to be offered on some Cadillac, as well as other Buick and Oldsmobile luxury models, in 1974, however this option was unpopular as was discontinued after the 1976 model year. The pillarless Coupe deVille ended with the 1973 model, while the Sedan deVille remained pillarless through 1976. The 1970s saw new extremes in vehicle luxury and dimension. The 1972 Fleetwood was some longer in wheelbase and overall, compared to the 1960 Series 75 Fleetwood; the entry-level 1972 Calais was longer than the equivalent 1960 Series 62, on the same wheelbase.Flory, pp. 20, 23, 878, & 880. Models gained a smoother ride while vehicle weight, standard equipment, and engine displacement were all increased. Cadillac experienced record sales in 1973 and again in the late 1970s. In May 1975, the Seville was introduced as a competitor to the growing import luxury car market and was marketed as \\"international size\\". File:Cadillac Eldorado.jpg1967-70 Cadillac Eldorado File:Cadillac DeVille Convertible 1968.jpg1968 Cadillac DeVille File:1972 Cadillac Sedan de Ville.jpg1972 Cadillac DeVille File:1976 Cadillac Coupe Deville D‚ÄôElegance fvl.jpg1976 Cadillac DeVille File:1976_Cadillac_Eldorado_convertible_1_-- _10-23-2009.jpg1976 Cadillac Eldorado File:1976 Cadillac Seville (41190938545).jpg1976 Cadillac Seville =Downsizings & New Technology- Assisted Luxury Features: 1977‚Äì1988= In 1977, Cadillac's D-bodies experienced the same \\"downsizing\\" as the rest of GM's \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" bodied cars. In 1977 GM significantly downsized their full-sized cars. The DeVille and Fleetwood Brougham rode on the same 121.5\\" wheelbase and were powered by the 425 cubic inch (7.0L) V8. This engine was basically a de-bored version of the 472/500 (7.9 L/8.2 L) V8 of previous years. 1977 was Cadillac's 75th anniversary, and saw the introduction of the downsized DeVille coupes and sedans. The new Fleetwood Brougham, which had lost its exclusive longer wheelbase, was now virtually similar to the lesser Sedan de Ville. Other than the name, there were only subtle exterior differences between a Fleetwood Brougham and Sedan de Ville. The interior of the Fleetwood was more plush and offered more features as standard. These new cars featured a higher roofline, resulting in a vehicle that was more than nine inches shorter, four inches narrower, and half a ton lighter than the previous year, but with a larger trunk and more headroom and legroom. These were also the first DeVilles to be marketed without fender skirts over the rear wheels. The 500 in3 V8 (which produced 190 horsepower) was replaced for 1977 by a 180-horsepower 425 in3 V8 variant of similar design. The reduction in size and weight was implemented to improve fuel economy and emissions as a result of the United States Federal Government passage of Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations. For 1977, the lineup included the two-door Coupe de Ville ($9,654) and four-door Sedan de Ville ($9,864). The $650 d'Elegance package, an interior dress-up option carried over from the previous generation of DeVilles, continued for both models. 3-sided, wrap-around tail lamps were a 1977 feature only (although they would re-appear in 1987). Coupe de Ville's popular \\"Cabriolet\\" option, priced at $348, included a rear-half padded vinyl roof covering and opera lamps. An optional electronic fuel-injected version of the standard 7.0-liter powerplant, adding , was available for an additional $647. Sales figures were 138,750 Coupe de Villes and 95,421 Sedan de Villes for an all-time sales record of 234,171 DeVilles sold. With these downsizings, fuel economy and handling improved. In 1979, Cadillac's flagship Eldorado coupe would downsize. The 1980s saw a downsizing of many models including the DeVille, Fleetwood, Eldorado, and Seville. 1980 saw a dramatic redesign for the Seville featuring a bustle-back rear-end styling theme and a move to a front-wheel-drive chassis which it shared with the Eldorado. In 1982, the Cimarron was introduced as the brand's first compact car. The Cimarron's market failure is one in a series of events throughout the 1980s and 1990s which caused Cadillac's share of the US market to decline from 3.8% in 1979 to 2.2% in 1997;Flammang and Kowalke, pp. 149‚Äì189 it is routinely cited as the nadir of GM's product planning: :*Noted automotive journalist Dan Neil included the Cimarron in his 2007 list of Worst Cars of all Time, saying \\"everything that was wrong, venal, lazy, and mendacious about GM in the 1980s was crystallized in this flagrant insult to the good name and fine customers of Cadillac.\\" He added that the Cimarron \\"nearly killed Cadillac and remains its biggest shame\\". For the 1981 model year, the long-running \\"Standard of the World\\" slogan was changed to \\"An American Standard of the World\\". For the 1982 model year, the slogan was changed to \\"Best of All... It's A Cadillac\\", which was used until 1986. Because of a delay in production of the new front-drive DeVilles (which were now going to be 1985 models), 1984 was a re-run for the rear-wheel-drive Coupe de Ville ($17,140) and its four-door companion, the popular Sedan de Ville ($17,625). It would also be the last time DeVille used the \\"V\\" emblem below the Cadillac crest, as 1985 models and on would use the crest and wreath emblem‚Äîformerly a Fleetwood exclusive. Minor changes included new body-color side moldings and a revised exhaust system with a revamped catalytic converter. The diesel V8 was now available at no additional charge. While the optional d'Elegance package remained at $1,150, the Cabriolet option for Coupe de Ville went up to $420. For 1984, sales figures show a total four-door production of 107,920 units, and an additional 50,840 two-door units (figures include de Ville and Fleetwood models). The new front-drive 1985 Coupe de Ville and Sedan de Ville arrived in Cadillac showrooms during the Spring of 1984, about six months earlier than most new-car introductions, so both the 1984 rear-drive and 1985 front-drive models were selling and being produced (due to separate assembly plants) at the same time for nearly half a year. 1985 saw the new front-wheel-drive DeVille and Fleetwood models released after quality delays prevented a planned 1984 model year introduction. 1986 saw new downsized Eldorado and Seville models. In 1987, the all-new Pininfarina-bodied Allante roadster came to market featuring the HT-4100 V8 engine. The Sixty Special returned in 1987 as the top owner-driven Cadillac in the front-wheel- drive GM C-body lineup, with a planned production run of just 2,000 cars. The 1987 and 1988 Sixty Specials were unique, custom-crafted automobiles, which featured a five-inch (127 mm) longer wheelbase over the DeVille/Fleetwood on which they were based. Similarly equipped to the standard-size Fleetwood d'Elegance‚Äîthe model on which it was based‚Äîthe Sixty Special also included an anti-lock braking system (a $925 Fleetwood option) and a stainless-steel exhaust system not available on other Cadillacs. In 1987, the Sixty Special carried a base price of $34,850‚Äîmore than $8,700 over the price of the Fleetwood d'Elegance. Also, 1987 brought the closure of Detroit Assembly on Clark Street in Detroit, where Cadillacs had been made since 1921. The 1980s also saw the introduction of new, technology-assisted luxury features. Among these was the return of the memory seat option, not available since the 1958 Eldorado Brougham. 1981 brought standard digital heating and air conditioning controls to all models. In 1982, the High Technology engine was introduced. It was originally scheduled for a 1983 release, later delayed to 1985, with its intended applications being the downsized front-wheel drive models Cadillac would introduce that year. 1983 saw the introduction of the Delco/Bose stereo system option, an US$895 cassette stereo system available only on the Eldorado and Seville. This Bose system would eventually become available on the DeVille and Fleetwood models on their 1985 FWD editions. The Trip Computer, available for Eldorado in 1979 and Seville in 1978 and 1979, was replaced in 1981 with the availability of digital instrumentation with some Trip Computer functions being replaced by the new digital heating and air conditioning control panel. Digital instrumentation would become available for the new FWD DeVille and Fleetwood series in 1985.

Regarded as GM's most technically complex engine, the original double overhead cam, four valve per cylinder, aluminum block/aluminum head V8 design was developed by Oldsmobile's R&D;, but is most associated with Cadillac's Northstar series. The related Northstar System was Cadillac's trademarked name for a package of performance features introduced in mid-1992 that coupled variable valve timing, road sensing suspension, variable power steering, and four-wheel disc brakes to the Division's high-output and high-torque Northstar engines. For 1992, the Seville was redesigned to better compete with luxury performance sedans from Europe and had adopted some styling cues from the 1988 Cadillac Voyage concept car. It also made Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list that year. A year later, the Brougham was discontinued and replaced by the all-new rear-wheel drive 1993 Fleetwood. The previous front-wheel drive Fleetwood was renamed Sixty Special for 1993. That same year, the Coupe deVille was discontinued due to the declining popularity of full-size coupes. For 1994, the DeVille was redesigned to share the K-body platform with the Seville. The body was redesigned, although the wheelbase remained 113.8 inches‚Äîrather than the 111 inches used on the Seville. Production moved to Hamtramck, Michigan. Also for 1994, all DeVille models included a standard SRS driver-side front airbag, as well as fully digital instrumentation with integrated message center, which provided important vehicle information and status, current speed, outside temperature, and more, with controls mounted to the left of the instrument cluster. Also standard was a dual-zone front HVAC system, with controls located to the right of the instrument cluster, and remote controls on the front passenger door panel. A SRS passenger's-side front airbag became standard equipment after a restyling in 1996, which also brought revised exterior styling and new audio systems with TheftLock coded anti-theft technology. In 1995, the High Technology engine that had been used in Cadillacs since 1982 was discontinued. For 1997, the Catera mid-size sedan was introduced as Cadillac's new entry level model. The Catera was a rebadged variant of the Opel Omega B and was manufactured by Opel in R√ºsselsheim, Germany. The DeVille was also redesigned that year. The late 1990s saw Cadillac field its first ever entry in the growing SUV segment. The Escalade, introduced in 1999, was marketed to compete with the Lincoln Navigator and luxury SUVs from various import brands.

Cadillac's model lineup mostly included rear- and all- wheel-drive sedans, roadsters, crossovers and SUVs. The only exceptions were the front-wheel drive compact executive Cadillac BLS (which was not sold in North America) and the Cadillac DTS, neither of which is still in production. The Cadillac BLS was developed by Saab in Trollh√§ttan, Sweden. The BLS was a rebadged variant of the Saab 9-3 and was ofered in both sedan and station wagon configurations. In 2005, the Cadillac STS was introduced as the successor to the Cadillac Seville,. which beginning in 1988 was available as an upscale performance-oriented STS (for Seville Touring Sedan) version, and comfort-oriented SLS (for Seville Luxury Sedan). The following year, STS received Cadillac's then-new Northstar System, including the aluminium DOHC L37 Northstar V8 engine. The STS was Cadillac's highest-priced sedan, falling in size between the mid-size CTS and full-size DTS. In 2006, the DeVille nameplate was replaced by Cadillac DTS, an abbreviation dating back to 1986, when a \\"DeVille Touring Sedan\\" package was first available. The new name brought the DeVille into line with Cadillac's Art & Science-era nomenclature, which saw the Seville renamed to STS and the Catera replacement called the CTS. The last DeVille rolled off the Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly line on June 23, 2005. The new second-generation CTS-V performance sedan was introduced in 2009 as a direct competitor to the BMW M5. Powered by a supercharged OHV 6.2 L LSA V8 engine, an automatic version of the CTS-V lapped the N√ºrburgring in 7:59.32, at the time a record for production sedans. The last DTS rolled off the assembly line at 11:51 a.m. on May 27, 2011. It was replaced by the Cadillac XTS which debuted in 2012 as a 2013 model. The Cadillac ATS compact sedan also debuted in 2012 as a 2013 model and a coupe version of the ATS was added two years later. In 2016, the Cadillac CT6 was introduced and was the brand's first full-size rear-wheel drive sedan since the discontinuation of the Fleetwood in 1996. In early 2017, Cadillac launched Book By Cadillac, a vehicle subscription service which was initially available in New York City. In November 2017, it was announced that Book by Cadillac would be expanding to Dallas and Los Angeles. The Cadillac XT6, a new seven-seat luxury mid-size crossover SUV, was introduced on January 12, 2019 at the North American International Auto Show.\\"2020 Cadillac XT6 3-row crossover debuting in Detroit\\" from Motor Authority (January 2019) It went on sale in the third quarter of 2019 as a 2020 model.\\"2020 Cadillac XT6 Debuts With Three Rows, Bold Styling, Refined Luxury\\" from GM Authority (12 January 2019) Other additions to the Cadillac lineup for the 2020 model year include the CT5 mid- size luxury sedan, replacing the CTS, and the CT4 compact sedan which replaces the ATS. Performance \\"V\\" versions of the CT4 and CT5 were also added for 2020.

Many Allard automobiles used Cadillac engines. In the 1950s, Cadillac (like all American manufacturers at the time) participated in the NASCAR Grand National Series. The brand disappeared from the series by the 1960s. Cadillac powered the Cadillac Northstar LMP a Le Mans Prototype in the early years of the American Le Mans Series from 2000 to 2002. When the prototype proved unsuccessful, Cadillac withdrew from the series. Cadillac's most successful venture into motorsport in recent years has been its use of the CTS-V in the SCCA World Challenge Grand Touring class. Cadillac returned to prototype racing in 2017 with the Cadillac DPi-V.R in the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship with considerable success.

It is bordered by Jamaica to the northwest, Hollis to the north, Queens Village to the northeast, Cambria Heights to the east, Laurelton to the southeast, Springfield Gardens to the south, and South Jamaica to the southwest. St. Albans is centered on the intersection of Linden Boulevard and Farmers Boulevard, about two miles north of John F. Kennedy International Airport. The small western enclave of Addisleigh Park is a U.S. historic district where many notable African Americans have lived, including Jackie Robinson, W. E. B. Du Bois, and many jazz musicians and entertainers including Fats Waller, Ella Fitzgerald, Lena Horne, and Count Basie. St. Albans is located in Queens Community District 12 and its ZIP Code is 11412. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 113th Precinct. Politically, St. Albans is represented by the New York City Council's 27th and 28th Districts.Current City Council Districts for Queens County, New York City. Accessed May 5, 2017. History =Early settlement= Part of a land grant to Dutch settlers from New Netherland Governor Peter Stuyvesant in 1655, the area, like much of Queens, remained farmland and forest for most of the next two centuries. By the 1800s, the lands of four families‚Äîthe Remsens, Everitts, Ludlums, and Hendricksons‚Äîformed the nucleus of this sprawling farm community in the eastern portion of the Town of Jamaica. In 1814, when the Village of Jamaica (the first village on Long Island) was incorporated, its (the village's) boundaries extended eastward to Freeman's Path (now Farmers Boulevard), and south to Lazy Lane (called Central Avenue in 1900, then Foch Boulevard in the 1920s, thus including parts of present-day St. Albans. In 1852, the old mill pond that is now at the center of Baisley Pond Park was acquired by the Brooklyn waterworks for use as a reservoir. =Later development= In 1872, the Long Island Rail Road's Cedarhurst Cut-off was built through the area, but no stop appears on the first timetables. In 1892, an area called Francis Farm was surveyed and developed for housing. There were numerous Francis families farming in the eastern portion of the Town of Jamaica in the 1880s. Other records indicate at least some of these lived in an area then called Jamaica South and/or Springfield.

Soon, the first street lights illuminated the crossroads that is now Linden Boulevard and Farmers Boulevard. New shops clustered around August Everitt's lone store. By July 1, 1898, the St. Albans Long Island Rail Road station opened where the tracks crossed Locust Avenue (now Baisley Boulevard). (This indicates trains stopped in 1897) The station was razed and replaced with the current, grade separated station on October 15, 1935. In 1899, a year after Queens became part of New York City (and with the Town of Jamaica and the Village of Jamaica thereby dissolved), the new post office for the 600 residents was named St. Albans, after St Albans in Hertfordshire, England, which itself was named after a Saint Alban, thought to be the first Christian martyred in England. The name had been in use for the area since at least 1894 for the name of the school district,. Mentions 1894 split from Hollis. See also full article and sketch of school: and the LIRR station was named St. Albans when it opened in 1898. A 1909 map also shows a St Albans Avenue and a St Albans Place in the area. St Albans Avenue was name of 118th Ave east of 196th Street. (Francis Lewis Boulevard is not on the map.) Also, St. Albans Place was the name of 121st Road. (See Queens, NY, Street Name Changes 1914-May 1951.) The site was originally occupied by the St. Albans Golf Course and Country Club, which was completed in 1915. The club brought rich and famous golfers, including baseball star Babe Ruth, See also: *http://www.protectsaintalbans.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/ElectedRepresentativeSupportLetters.pdf *http://www.addisleighpark.org/ *http://www.astorialic.org/starjournal/1940s/1942september_p.php *http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60612F93858157A93CBA8178ED85F468485F9 *http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20A1EF83E59157A93C1A9178AD95F4C8485F9 *http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0F11F83C581B7B93C4A81789D85F478485F9 and hosted the 1930 Metropolitan Amateur. The Depression forced the golf course owners to try to sell, but plans for private development fell through. The land was seized by the federal government in 1942, and construction soon began on the St. Albans Naval Hospital, which opened in 1943. After construction was completed in 1950, the hospital had 3000 beds and contained a network of 76 wards. The hospital was turned over to the Veterans Administration in 1974, reopening as a VA hospital two years later, and more recently evolved into the Veterans Administration St. Albans Primary and Extended Care Facility. A portion of the hospital site became Roy Wilkins Park in the 1980s. Addisleigh Park subsection Houses in Addisleigh Park Welcome sign Within St. Albans is the small western enclave of Addisleigh Park, a U.S. historic district that consists of single-family homes built in a variety of styles between the 1910s and 1930s. Though originally intended as a segregated community for white people only, from the late 1930s many notable African Americans have lived there. Today, it remains a predominantly African American & Jamaican enclave that is more upscale than surrounding areas in southeast Queens. Between 1900 and 1940, the village of Addisleigh Park was developed by a handful of eminent white entrepreneurs including Edwin H. Brown, Gerald C. English, and Alexander Rodman. Restrictive covenants were established to prohibit the sale of any of its properties to blacks. A 1926 New York Times article insists, \\"Addisleigh, together with the St. Albans Golf Club, was laid out under the personal direction of Edwin H. Brown, and carries a land and house restriction of the highest type.\\" Two lawsuits were filed successfully by white residents who accused their neighbors of breaking the contractual segregation imposed on the neighborhood by its developers. Simeon Bankoff, Executive Director of the New York Historic Districts Council, says about this backlash, \\"It was unpleasant, as it was a case of a number of narrow-minded neighbors trying to fight what they saw as an invasion of unwanted people in their area.\\" Affluent white New York City-based public figures moved into Addisleigh Park to experience the privacy of suburban seclusion. Addisleigh Park boasted well-kept rows of Tudor and Colonial homes. The neighborhood's close proximity to Manhattan allowed for quick and frequent commuting. During the Swing Era, Manhattan's 52nd Street served as the epicenter of Swing Era live entertainment and musical innovation. For this reason, many successful African American jazz musicians began to recognize Addisleigh Park as the newest suburban haven for wealthy, influential artists. In 1948, the United States Supreme Court ruled that racially restrictive covenants violated the equal-protection clause of the 14th Amendment, though by that year, Addisleigh Park had already become a haven for world-famous African Americans in jazz and sports.

She first appeared on television in the Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\" on April 19, 1987. Maggie was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. She received her first name from Groening's youngest sister. After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for three years, the Simpson family was given their own series on the Fox Broadcasting Company which debuted December 17, 1989. Maggie is the youngest child of Homer and Marge, and sister to Bart and Lisa. She is often seen sucking on her red pacifier and, when she walks, she trips over her clothing and falls on her face (this running gag is used much more in earlier seasons). Being an infant, she has not yet learned how to talk. However, she did appear to talk in the first Tracey Ullman Show short. Though she rarely talks, she frequently makes a characteristic sucking noise with her pacifier, which has become synonymous with the character. Her pacifier sucking noises are provided by the show's creator, Matt Groening and early producer Gabor Csupo. Maggie's occasional speaking parts and other vocalisations are currently provided by Nancy Cartwright, but she has also been voiced by guest stars James Earl Jones, Elizabeth Taylor and Jodie Foster, and by series regulars Yeardley Smith and Harry Shearer. Maggie has appeared in various media relating to The Simpsons ‚Äì including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books ‚Äì and has inspired an entire line of merchandise. Role in The Simpsons The Simpsons uses a floating timeline in which the characters do not physically age, and as such the show is assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Maggie is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and sister to Bart and Lisa. When Marge became pregnant with Bart, she and Homer got married at a chapel in Las Vegas. To support his impending family, Homer all but demanded a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, impressing its owner, Mr. Burns, with his aggressive submissiveness. When Marge became pregnant with Lisa, two years later, she and Homer bought their first house. Another six years later, Homer felt financially secure enough to finally quit his job at the Power Plant and take his dream job at Barney's Bowlarama. However, Marge became pregnant with Maggie, so Homer, once again unable to support his family, was forced to reapply for his old job. By the time Maggie was born, Homer had shown great signs of distress, but he managed to find motivation in the form of his newborn baby girl. During the earlier seasons of the show, Maggie's equivalent of a hallmark was to trip over her clothing and fall on her face while trying to walk, causing a loud thud on the floor, but this was toned down in the later seasons. She has penchant for her pacifier, on which she is always seen sucking. Maggie has performed a number of feats that suggest she is highly intelligent, akin to her sister, and possibly a genius. She has spelled out E=MC¬≤ with her baby blocks, driven Homer's car, escaped from the Springfield daycare center, written her name on an Etch A Sketch, played Internet poker, spelled words with her baby blocks, played Lisa's saxophone, and treated her pacifier like a cigarette. However, the rest of the Simpsons family are unaware of Maggie's maturity and Marge carries Maggie wherever they go rather than letting her walk by herself. Maggie is keenly aware of her surroundings, and can usually be seen imitating the flow of action around her. She shows a high degree of dexterity, and she once hit Homer on the head with a mallet and shot a dart at a photograph of him in imitation of Itchy and Scratchy. Despite her age, Maggie is a formidable marksman, as seen in \\"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\\" where she shoots Mr. Burns with a handgun that falls into her hands, and in a more intentional manner during \\"Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge\\" where she is able to non-fatally shoot a group of mobsters in rapid succession with a rifle that she apparently hides in her crib. Homer had previously left a rifle in her crib in Mom and Pop Art. It is unclear whether the gun Maggie uses to shoot the mobsters is the same one. Maggie is usually frightened and exasperated by Homer's attempts to bond with her, but has on several occasions stepped in to save Homer's life: once from drowning, once from being shot by mobsters, once from being kidnapped by a tow truck driver, and once from being shot by Russ Cargill, head of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Character =Creation= Maggie in her first appearance in the Ullman short \\"Good Night\\". Matt Groening first conceived Maggie and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of James L. Brooks's office. Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show, and had intended to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights for his life's work, Groening decided to go in another direction, and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family. The baby of the family was named Maggie after Groening's youngest sister. Maggie then made her debut with the rest of the Simpsons family on April 19, 1987 in the short \\"Good Night\\". In 1989, the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons, a half-hour series that would air on the Fox Broadcasting Company. Maggie and the rest of the family remained the main characters on this new show. The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette.Groening, Matt. (2005). Commentary for \\"Fear of Flying\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. Maggie's physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no character other than Lisa shares her hairline.Groening, Matt; Reiss, Mike; Kirkland, Mark. (2002). Commentary for \\"Principal Charming\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. While designing Maggie and Lisa, Groening \\"couldn't be bothered to even think about girls' hair styles\\".Silverman, David; Reardon, Jim; Groening, Matt. (2005). Illustrated commentary for \\"Treehouse of Horror V\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. At the time, Groening was primarily drawing in black and white and when designing Lisa and Maggie, he \\"just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style, not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color\\".Groening, Matt. (2006). \\"A Bit From the Animators\\", illustrated commentary for \\"All Singing, All Dancing\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Groening thought that it would be funny to have a baby character that did not talk and never grew up, but was scripted to show any emotions that the scene required. Maggie's comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk, and a penchant for sucking on her pacifier, the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the Tracey Ullman period. In the early seasons of the show, Maggie would suck her pacifier over other characters' dialogue, but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting.Groening, Matt. (2001). Commentary for \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. =Voice= With few exceptions, Maggie never speaks but participates in the events around her, emoting with subtle gestures and facial expressions. Maggie's first lines were spoken in \\"Good Night\\", the first short to air on The Tracey Ullman Show, after the family falls asleep. On this occasion, Liz Georges provided the voice of Maggie. Rather than talking, Maggie is well known for producing a characteristic \\"sucking\\" sound from her pacifier. This sound effect was originally provided by the show's creator Matt Groening, for early episodes of The Tracey Ullman Show, and also by Gabor Csupo (who was also the animation executive producer, for the first 60 episodes). The sucking noise is heard in all of Maggie's appearances to date, and is usually archive audio from either of Groening or Csupo's initial recordings (from the show's early episodes). Other than her sucking noise, Maggie has been known to make other noises, such as occasional squeals and babbling. In most instances, these vocalisations are provided by either Nancy Cartwright or Yeardley Smith. Although she had previously spoken in fantasies and dream sequences, Maggie's first word spoken in the normal continuity of the series occurred in \\"Lisa's First Word\\", when she was voiced by Elizabeth Taylor. Although it was only one word (\\"Daddy\\"), Taylor had to record the part numerous times before the producers were satisfied. James Earl Jones voiced Maggie in \\"Treehouse of Horror V\\". Maggie would later have brief dialogue in \\"Treehouse of Horror IX\\", voiced by Harry Shearer, who used his Kang voice. In earlier episodes, Yeardley Smith did many of Maggie's squeaks, cries, laughs and occasional speaking parts,Smith, Yeardley. (2007). Commentary for The Simpsons Movie [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. although in the later seasons her parts are done by Nancy CartwrightBrooks, James L.; Cartwright, Nancy; Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Moore, Rich. (2003). Commentary for \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. (including a single word spoken during the end credits of The Simpsons Movie). Jodie Foster voiced a Howard Roark-inspired Maggie in the season 20 episode \\"Four Great Women and a Manicure\\". In the occasional episodes set in the future (\\"Lisa's Wedding\\", \\"Bart to the Future\\", \\"Future-Drama\\", \\"Holidays of Future Passed\\", \\"Days of Future Future\\"), although an older Maggie is depicted, as a running gag within these episodes she is never shown speaking, or has become mute. Reception In 2000, Maggie, along with the rest of the Simpson family, was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Maggie has received both popular and critical acclaim. Nancy Basile at About.com said her favorite Maggie scenes on The Simpsons are the ones that show her acting more like an adult than a one-year- old. Some of her favorite Maggie scenes include scenes from \\"Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song\\" and \\"Lady Bouvier's Lover\\" where Maggie meets her unibrowed archenemy, Baby Gerald, and the one scene from \\"Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie\\" in which Bart is supposed to babysit Maggie, but she escapes and takes Homer's car for a ride. Basile also added that \\"whether watching 'The Happy Elves' or falling down, Maggie is the cutest baby in the Simpson family\\". Comedian Ricky Gervais named \\"And Maggie Makes Three\\" his second favorite episode of the show and said that the scene in the end where Homer puts up pictures of Maggie over his desk gave him \\"a lump in the throat thinking about it\\". Todd Everett at Variety called the scene in \\"Lisa's First Word\\" where Maggie speaks her first word \\"quite a heart-melter\\". In 2006, Elizabeth Taylor was named thirteenth on IGN's \\"Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances\\" list for her performance as Maggie in \\"Lisa's First Word\\". James Earl Jones, voice of Maggie in \\"Treehouse of Horror V\\", was named the seventh greatest guest star on the show in the same list. In 2000, Maggie and the rest of the Simpson family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard. Merchandising Four children's books, written by Maggie Groening (after whom Maggie was named) and illustrated by Matt Groening, entitled Maggie Simpson's Book of Animals, Maggie Simpson's Counting Book, Maggie Simpson's Book of Colors and Shapes and Maggie Simpson's Alphabet Book were released on September 12, 1991. Other merchandise includes dolls, posters, figurines, jigsaw puzzles, and T-shirts. Maggie was made into an action figure as part of the World of Springfield toy line, and was released in the wave one playset \\"Living Room\\", featuring her and Marge in the living room of the Simpsons house. Maggie has appeared in commercials for Burger King, Butterfinger, C.C. Lemon, Domino's Pizza, Ramada Inn and Subway. Maggie has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons. She is a character in every one of The Simpsons video games, including the most recent, The Simpsons Game. Alongside the television series, Maggie regularly appears in issues of the Simpsons comics, which were first published on November 29, 1993 and are still issued monthly. Maggie also plays a role in The Simpsons Ride, launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood. Maggie starred in the 3D short-film The Longest Daycare, which was shown in theaters before Ice Age: Continental Drift in 2012. On April 9, 2009, the United States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44-cent stamps featuring Maggie and the four other members of the Simpson family. They are the first characters from a television series to receive this recognition while the show is still in production. The stamps, designed by Matt Groening, were made available for purchase on May 7, 2009. In a USPS poll, Maggie's stamp was voted the most popular of the five. Maggie also starred in the 3D short-film Playdate with Destiny, which was shown in theaters before Onward in 2020.

She is the middle child and most accomplished of the Simpson family. Voiced by Yeardley Smith, Lisa was born as a character in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\" on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed her while waiting to meet James L. Brooks. Groening had been invited to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic Life in Hell, but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the elder Simpson daughter after his younger sister Lisa Groening Bartlett. After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for three years, the Simpson family were moved to their own series on Fox, which debuted on December 17, 1989. Intelligent and passionate, Lisa Simpson, at eight years old, is the second child of Homer and Marge, the younger sister of Bart, and the older sister of Maggie. Lisa's high intellect and liberal political stance creates a barrier between her and other children her age; therefore she is a bit of a loner and social outcast. Lisa is a vegetarian, a strong environmentalist, a feminist, and a Buddhist. Lisa's character develops many times over the course of the show: she becomes a vegetarian in season 7 and converts to Buddhism in season 13. A strong liberal, Lisa advocates for a variety of political causes (e.g. standing with the Tibetan independence movement) which usually sets her against most of the people in Springfield. However, she can also be somewhat intolerant of opinions that differ from her own, often refusing to consider alternative perspectives and showing a feeling of self-righteousness. In her free time, Lisa enjoys many hobbies such as reading and playing the baritone saxophone, despite her father's annoyance regarding the latter. She has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons ‚Äì including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books ‚Äì and inspired a line of merchandise. Yeardley Smith originally tried out for the role of Bart, while Nancy Cartwright (who was later cast as the voice for Bart) tried out for Lisa. Producers considered Smith's voice too high for a boy, so she was given the role of Lisa. In the Tracey Ullman Show shorts, Lisa was something of a \\"female Bart\\" who mirrored her brother's mischief, but as the series progressed she became a liberal voice of reason which has drawn both praise and criticism from fans of the show. Because of her unusual pointed hairstyle, many animators consider Lisa the most difficult Simpsons character to draw. TV Guide ranked her 11th (tied with Bart) on their list of the \\"Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time\\". Her environmentalism has been especially well-received; several episodes featuring her have won Genesis and Environmental Media Awards, including a special \\"Board of Directors Ongoing Commitment Award\\" in 2001. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals included Lisa on their list of the \\"Most Animal-Friendly TV Characters of All Time\\". Yeardley Smith won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992 and Lisa and her family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2000. Role in The Simpsons The Simpsons uses a floating timeline in which the characters do not have physical ages; as such, Lisa is always depicted as 7‚Äì8 years old. The show itself is perpetually set in the year of broadcast (except for occasional flashbacks and flashforwards). In several episodes, events have been linked to specific time periods, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Lisa's year of birth is given in \\"Lisa's First Word\\" (season 4, 1992) as 1984, during the Summer Olympics. The episode \\"That '90s Show\\" (season 19, 2008), however, contradicts much of the established backstory; for example, it presents Homer and Marge as being childless in the late 1990s. Lisa is a lover of music, with jazz as her favorite genre; she specifically singles out Miles Davis's 1957 album Birth of the Cool as her favorite album. She enjoys and excels at playing the saxophone and became friends with jazz musician Bleeding Gums Murphy, whom she regards as an idol. Murphy helps pull Lisa out of her depression in \\"Moaning Lisa\\" (season 1, 1990). She is later deeply saddened by Murphy's death in \\"'Round Springfield\\" (season 6, 1995). Lisa has been romantic with several boys, including Ralph Wiggum in \\"I Love Lisa\\" (the fifteenth episode of season 4, 1993), Nelson Muntz in \\"Lisa's Date with Density\\" (season 8, 1996) and Colin in The Simpsons Movie (2007). Bart's best friend Milhouse Van Houten has a crush on her, but despite dropping unsubtle hints about his feelings, he has been unsuccessful in winning her affection. Her voice actor Yeardley Smith said Muntz would make a good match for Lisa. In 2019, Simpsons showrunner Al Jean said he saw Lisa as being \\"possibly polyamorous\\" in the future. In the 2011 Season 23 episode 9 episode Holidays of Future Passed Lisa is shown holding hands with an unnamed dark-haired woman in a photo, and then shown in a second photo where she is holding hands with two different women at once, suggesting polyamory; she later ends up with Milhouse. However, this episode is non-canon. Lisa is the most intellectual member of the Simpson family (she has an IQ of 159), and many episodes of the series focus on her fighting for various causes. Lisa is often the focus of episodes with \\"a real moral or philosophical point\\", which according to former writer David S. Cohen is because \\"you really buy her as caring about it.\\"Cohen, David S.; Groening, Matt; Meyer, George; Michels, Pete; Scully, Mike; Smith; Yeardley. (2005). Commentary for \\"Lisa the Skeptic\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Lisa's political convictions are generally liberal and she often contests other's views. She is a vegetarian, feminist, environmentalist and a supporter of gay rights and the Free Tibet movement. In a special Christmas message for the UK in 2004 Lisa showed her support for Cornish nationalism, even speaking the Cornish language to get her message across. While supportive of the general ideals of the Christian church in which she was raised, Lisa became a practicing Buddhist in the episode \\"She of Little Faith\\" (season 13, 2001) after she learned about the Noble Eightfold Path. An \\"End Apartheid Now\\" poster can be seen on her bedroom door during earlier seasons. She is extremely controlled by her ideals and noble, and she undergoes drastic changes when she or anyone else is immoral, such as renouncing Homer's last name and taking Marge's when she discovers that Homer bet against her in a crossword puzzle competition. Character =Creation= Matt Groening conceived Lisa and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks's office. Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show and had intended to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening went in another direction, hurriedly sketching his version of a dysfunctional family, named after members of his own family. Lisa was named after Groening's younger sister, but little else was based on her. In The Tracey Ullman Show shorts, Lisa displayed little of the intelligence for which she later became known. She was more of a \\"female Bart\\" and was originally described as simply the \\"middle child\\", without much personality. Lisa made her debut with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\". In 1989, the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons, a half-hour series on the Fox Broadcasting Company. =Design= This image illustrates how to draw Lisa's head and hairline using the three- three-two arrangement. The entire Simpson family was designed to be easily recognized in silhouette.Groening, Matt. (2005). Commentary for \\"Fear of Flying\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. Lisa's physical features are generally unique. In some early episodes, minor background characters occasionally had a similar hairline. However, in the later seasons, no character other than Maggie shares her hairline.Groening, Matt; Reiss, Mike; Kirkland, Mark. (2002). Commentary for \\"Principal Charming\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. While designing Lisa, Groening \\"couldn't be bothered to even think about girls' hairstyles\\". At the time, Groening was primarily drawing in black and white; when designing Lisa and Maggie, he \\"just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style, not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color\\".Groening, Matt. (2006). \\"A Bit From the Animators\\", illustrated commentary for \\"All Singing, All Dancing\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. To draw Lisa's head and hair, most of the show's animators use what they call the \\"three-three-two arrangement\\". It begins with a circle, with two curving lines (one vertical, one horizontal) intersecting in the middle to indicate her eyeline. The vertical line continues outside of the circle to create one hair point, with two more added towards the back of her head. Three more points are then added in front (in the direction Lisa is facing), with two more behind it.Archer, Wes; Groening, Matt; Kirkland, Mark. (2005). \\"A Bit From the Animators\\", illustrated commentary for \\"Summer of 4 Ft. 2\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.

Illustrated commentary for \\"Treehouse of Horror V\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. =Voice= While the roles of Homer and Marge were given to Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner because they were already a part of the Tracey Ullman Show cast, the producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa. Nancy Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa, but disliked the character's bland description‚ÄîLisa was described simply as the \\"middle child\\"‚Äîand read for the role of Bart instead. Casting director Bonita Pietila brought Yeardley Smith in for an audition after seeing her performing in the play Living on Salvation Street. Smith was hesitant to audition for an animated series, but her agent had persuaded her to give it a try. Smith originally auditioned for the role of Bart but Pietila believed her voice was too high. Smith later recalled: \\"I always sounded too much like a girl, I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'\\" Pietila offered Smith the role of Lisa instead. Voice actress Yeardley Smith Smith and the show's writers worked to give Lisa a more defined personality, and she has developed greatly during the series. In her 2000 memoir My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy, Cartwright wrote: \\"with the brilliant wit of the writers and the wry, in-your- eye, honest-to-a-fault interpretation, Yeardley Smith has made Lisa a bright light of leadership, full of compassion and competence beyond her years. Lisa Simpson is the kind of child we not only want our children to be but also the kind of child we want all children to be. But, at the time, on The Tracey Ullman Show, she was just an animated eight-year-old kid who had no personality.\\" Lisa is the only regular character voiced by Smith, who raises the pitch of her voice slightly for the role. In some earlier episodes she provided some of Maggie's squeaks and occasional speaking parts, and has voiced other characters on very rare occasions. Usually they are derivative of Lisa, such as Lisa Bella in \\"Last Tap Dance in Springfield\\" (season 11, 2000) and Lisa, Jr. in \\"Missionary: Impossible\\". (season 11, 2000)Smith, Yeardley. (2008). Commentary for \\"Missionary: Impossible\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Despite the fame of Lisa Simpson, Smith is rarely recognized in public, which she does not mind. She said, \\"it's wonderful to be in the midst of all this hype about the show, and people enjoying the show so much, and to be totally a fly on the wall; people never recognize me solely from my voice.\\" In a 2009 interview with The Guardian she commented that \\"It's the best job ever. I have nothing but gratitude for the amount of freedom The Simpsons has bought me in my life.\\" Although Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992, she considers it unimportant, saying \\"there's part of me that feels it wasn't even a real Emmy.\\" The award is a Creative Arts prize not awarded during the primetime telecast and, at the time, a juried award without nominations. Still, Smith considers her work on the show a success. \\"If I had to be associated with one character in fiction,\\" she said, \\"I will always be thrilled that it was Lisa Simpson.\\" Matt Groening has described Smith as being very similar to Lisa: \\"Yeardley has strong moral views about her character. Some lines are written for Lisa that Yeardley reads and says, 'No, I wouldn't say that.'\\" Former Simpsons writer Jay Kogen praised her performance on the show, particularly in the episode \\"Lisa's Substitute\\", as able \\"to move past comedy to something really strong and serious and dramatic.\\" Until 1998, Smith was paid $30,000 per episode. A pay dispute erupted in 1998, during which Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing for casting of new voices. The dispute was soon resolved, and Smith received $125,000 per episode until 2004 when the voice actors sought an increase to $360,000 per episode. The issue was resolved a month later, and Smith earned $250,000 per episode. New salary negotiations took place in 2008, and the voice actors currently receive approximately $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Smith and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode. =Development= Lisa in her first televised appearance in \\"Good Night\\". While designers who worked on Lisa, Groening, who was primarily drawing in black and white, \\"just gave [her] this kind of spiky starfish hair style, not thinking that [she] would eventually be drawn in color\\". Lisa's hair points would eventually be made less spiky. In The Tracey Ullman Show shorts, Lisa was something of a \\"female Bart\\": equally mischievous but lacking unique traits.Mirkin, David. (2004). Commentary for \\"Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. As the series progressed, Lisa began to develop into a more intelligent and more emotional character. She demonstrates her intellect in the 1990 episode \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\" (season one), by helping Bart reveal Sideshow Bob's plot to frame Krusty the Clown for armed robbery.Reiss, Mike. (2001). Commentary for \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Many episodes focusing on Lisa have an emotional nature, such as \\"Moaning Lisa\\" (season one, 1990). The idea for the episode was pitched by James L. Brooks, who wanted to do an emotional episode involving Lisa's sadness, to complement the many \\"jokey episodes\\" in the first season.Reiss, Mike. (2001). Commentary for \\"Moaning Lisa\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In the seventh-season episode \\"Lisa the Vegetarian\\" (1995), Lisa permanently becomes a vegetarian, distinguishing her as one of the first primetime television characters to make such a choice. The episode was written by David S. Cohen (in his first solo writing credit), who jotted down the idea one day while eating lunch. Then-executive producer David Mirkin, who had recently become a vegetarian himself, quickly approved the idea. Several of Lisa's experiences in the episode are based on Mirkin's own experiences. The episode guest stars musician Paul McCartney, a committed vegetarian and animal rights activist. McCartney's condition for appearing was that Lisa would remain a vegetarian for the rest of the series and would not revert the next week (as is common on situation comedies). The trait stayed and is one of the few permanent character changes made in the show.Cohen, David S.; Groening, Matt; Mirkin, David. (2005). Commentary for \\"Lisa the Vegetarian\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In the season 13 episode \\"She of Little Faith\\" (2001), Lisa underwent another permanent character change when she converted to Buddhism. Lisa plays the baritone saxophone, and some episodes use that as a plot device. According to Matt Groening, the baritone saxophone was chosen because he found the thought of an eight-year-old girl playing it amusing. He added, \\"But she doesn't always play a baritone sax because the animators don't know what it looks like, so it changes shape and color from show to show.\\" One of the hallmarks of the show's opening sequence is a brief solo Lisa plays on her saxophone after being thrown out of music class. The Simpsons composer Alf Clausen said that the session musicians who perform her solos do not try to play at the second-grade level and instead \\"think of Lisa as a really good player.\\" =Personality= Lisa, despite being a child prodigy, often sees herself as a misfit within the Simpson family and other children due to possessing an unusually high level of intelligence. She shows characteristics rarely seen in Springfield, including spirituality and commitment to peaceful ways, and is notably more concerned with world affairs than her life in Springfield, with her rebellion against social norms being depicted as constructive and heroic, yet she can be self- righteous at times. In \\"Lisa the Vegetarian\\", an increasing sense of moral righteousness leads her to disrupt her father's roast-pig barbecue, an act for which she later apologizes. Episodes often take shots at Lisa's idealism. In \\"Bart Star\\" (season nine, 1997), Lisa, who is departing from her typically more genuine nature and apparently looking for a new cause to crusade over, defiantly declares that she, a girl, would like to join the football team. In the 1990s, it was considered odd to allow a girl to play football. However, when coach Ned Flanders reveals that several girls already play for the team, she hesitates and claims football is \\"not really [her] thing\\". She then expresses distaste about a ball made of pig's skin, but one of the girls informs her that their footballs are synthetic and that proceeds are donated to Amnesty International. Upset by being unable to gain moral superiority, Lisa runs off. In \\"She of Little Faith,\\" Lisa permanently becomes a Buddhist after being appalled at how the First Church of Springfield allowed Mr. Burns to rebuild the church, which burned after being hit with Bart and Milhouse's rockets, with commercialism. Despite no longer following the Christian faith, she still is seen attending church in later episodes. Lisa is said to have an IQ of 159, and in \\"They Saved Lisa's Brain\\" (season ten, 1999) she becomes a member of the Springfield chapter of Mensa. When unable to attend school due to a teachers' strike in \\"The PTA Disbands\\", (season six, 1995) she suffers withdrawal symptoms because of the sudden lack of praise. She even demands that her mother grade her for no obvious reason. In Planet Simpson, Chris Turner writes that these traits make Lisa more realistic because \\"No character can aspire to realism without a few all-too-human flaws.\\" Although she is wise beyond her years, Lisa has typical childhood issues, sometimes requiring adult intervention. One episode to show this is \\"See Homer Run\\" (season seventeen, 2005) where she goes through a developmental condition which causes her to get into trouble at school. In \\"Lost Our Lisa\\" (season nine, 1998), she tricks Homer into allowing her to ride the bus alone, only to become hopelessly lost and in need of aid from her father. Chris Turner writes in Planet Simpson that incidents like this illustrate that \\"Even when Lisa's lecturing like a college professor or mounting yet another protest, she never becomes a full-grown adult trapped in a child's body.\\" In The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer, Aeon J. Skoble states that although Lisa is an intellectual, she is still portrayed as a character who enjoys normal childhood and girl activities, plays with Malibu Stacy dolls, loves ponies, obsesses over teenage heartthrobs such as Corey, and watches The Itchy & Scratchy Show along with Bart. He writes, \\"One might argue that this is typical childhood behavior, but since in so many cases Lisa is presented not simply as a prodigy but as preternaturally wise, the fondness for Itchy & Scratchy and Corey seem to be highlighted, taking on greater significance. Lisa is portrayed as the avatar of logic and wisdom, but then she also worships Corey so she's 'no better [than the rest of us]'.\\" When she became depressed over being unable to pursue her dream as a musician due to inheriting her father's fingers and having to spend her time with Marge in being a homemaker, Lisa gives up on school and becomes a juvenile delinquent in Separate Vocations. She is stopped by Bart who encourages her to keep proving people wrong and pursue her dreams as a musician. Lisa occasionally worries that her family's dull habits will rub off on her, such as in \\"Lisa the Simpson\\" (season nine, 1998) she worries that the \\"Simpson gene\\" will make her a dimwit later finding out the gene only goes through the male side. She is often embarrassed and disapproving of her eccentric family: of her father's poor parenting skills and buffoonish personality; her mother's stereotypical image and social ineptitude; and her brother's delinquent and low-brow nature. She is also concerned that Maggie may grow up to be like the rest of the family and tries to teach her complex ideas. Chris Turner writes in Planet Simpson that \\"Lisa embarks on quests to find solace for her yearning spirit ... but the most reliable source of truth she finds is the one she always believed in: her family. It is from the other Simpsons that Lisa draws stability, meaning, contentment.\\" Her loyalty to her family is most clearly seen in the flashforward \\"Lisa's Wedding\\" (season six, 1995), in which she must reconcile her love for them with the distaste of her cultured fianc√©. In the episode \\"Mother Simpson\\" (season seven, 1995) she meets her paternal grandmother Mona Simpson for the first time. Mona is also well-read and articulate, and the writers used the character as a way to explain the origins of Lisa's intelligence.Appel, Rich. (2005). Commentary for \\"Mother Simpson\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Reception =Commendations= In 2000, Lisa, along with the rest of the Simpson family, was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Lisa has been a popular character since the show's inception. She was listed at number 11 (tied with Bart) in TV Guide's \\"Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time.\\" She appeared in Comcast's list of TV's Most Intriguing Characters and was also included in AfterEllen.com's Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. On a less positive note, she was ranked third in AskMen's top 10 of the most irritating '90s cartoon characters. Yeardley Smith has won several awards for voicing Lisa, including a Primetime Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding Voice-Over Performance\\" in 1992 for \\"Lisa the Greek\\". Various episodes in which Lisa stars have won Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program, including \\"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\\" in 1991, \\"Lisa's Wedding\\" in 1995 and \\"HOMR\\" in 2001. In 2000, Lisa and the rest of the Simpson family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard. Lisa's environmentalism has been especially well received. In 2001, Lisa received a special \\"Board of Directors Ongoing Commitment Award\\" at the Environmental Media Awards. \\"Lisa the Vegetarian\\" won both an Environmental Media Award for \\"Best Television Episodic Comedy\\" and a Genesis Award for \\"Best Television Comedy Series, Ongoing Commitment\\". Several other episodes that feature Lisa speaking out in favor of animal rights have won Genesis Awards, including \\"Whacking Day\\" in 1994, \\"Bart Gets an Elephant\\" in 1995,Cohen, David X.; Groening, Matt; Kirkland, Mark; Mirkin, David. (2005). Commentary for \\"Lisa the Vegetarian\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. \\"Million Dollar Abie\\" in 2007 and \\"Apocalypse Cow\\" in 2009. =Cultural influence= Jonathan Gray, author of the book Watching The Simpsons, feels that Lisa \\"is probably the best and certainly longest-running feminist character that television has had. She's the heart of the show and she quite often questions gender politics.\\" Christopher Borrelli of The Toledo Blade wrote, \\"Has there ever been a female TV character as complex, intelligent, and, ahem, as emotionally well-drawn as Lisa Simpson? Meet her once and she comes off priggish and one-note ‚Äì a know- it-all. Get to know her and Lisa is as well-rounded as anyone you may ever meet in the real world.\\" According to PETA, Lisa was one of the first vegetarian characters on primetime television. In 2004 the organization included Lisa on its list of the \\"Most Animal-Friendly TV Characters of All Time\\". In 2008, environmentalist website The Daily Green honored Lisa's role in The Simpsons Movie with one of its inaugural \\"Heart of Green\\" awards, which \\"recognize those who have helped green go mainstream.\\" They wrote \\"young Lisa Simpson has inspired a generation to wear their hearts on their sleeves and get educated, and involved, about global issues, from justice to feminism and the environment.\\" Japanese broadcasters reversed viewer dislike of the series by focusing marketing of the show on Lisa. Lisa's well-intended but ill-fated struggles to be a voice of reason and a force of good in her family and community struck a chord with Japanese audiences. Mario D'Amato, a specialist in Buddhist studies at Rollins College in Florida, described Lisa as \\"open- minded, reflective, ethical, and interested in improving herself in various ways, while still preserving a childlike sense of innocence. These are all excellent qualities, ones which are espoused by many Buddhist traditions.\\" Lisa and the rest of the Simpsons have had a significant influence on English- language idioms. The dismissive term \\"meh\\"‚Äîused by Lisa and popularized by the show‚Äî entered the Collins English Dictionary in 2008. In 1996, The New York Times published an article saying that Lisa was inspiring children, especially young girls, to learn to play the saxophone. Lisa Simpson was mentioned at the 2018 Conservative Political Action Conference when Senator Ted Cruz called the Democratic Party \\"The Party of Lisa Simpson\\", as opposed to the Republican Party being the party of the rest of the family.\\"Ted Cruz: 'Democrats are the party of Lisa Simpson' \\" by William Cummings, USA Today, February 23, 2018 =Merchandising= Lisa has been included in many The Simpsons publications, toys, and other merchandise. The Lisa Book, describing Lisa's personality and attributes, was released in 2006. Other merchandise includes dolls, posters, figurines, bobblehead dolls, mugs, and clothing such as slippers, T-shirts, baseball caps, and boxer shorts. Lisa has appeared in commercials for Burger King, C.C. Lemon, Church's Chicken, Domino's Pizza, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Ramada Inn, Ritz Crackers, Subway and Butterfinger. On April 9, 2009, the United States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44 cent stamps featuring Lisa and the four other members of the nuclear Simpson family. They are the first characters from a television series to receive this recognition while still in production. The stamps, designed by Matt Groening, went on sale in May 2009. Lisa has also appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons. She has appeared in each Simpsons video game, including The Simpsons Game, released in 2007. In addition to the television series, Lisa regularly appears in issues of Simpsons Comics, first published on November 29, 1993, and published monthly. The comics focus on the sweeter, more naive incarnation from the early seasons. Lisa also plays a role in The Simpsons Ride, launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood.

Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP) of 1871‚Äì1875 (often called simply the \\"National Association\\"), the NL is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later and is called the \\"Junior Circuit\\". Both leagues currently have 15 teams. After two years of conflict in a \\"baseball war\\" of 1901‚Äì1902, the two eight-team leagues agreed in a \\"peace pact\\" to recognize each other as \\"major leagues\\", draft rules regarding player contracts, prohibiting \\"raiding\\", regulating relationships with minor leagues and lower level clubs, and with each establishing a team in the nation's largest metropolis of New York City, and the league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the new professional baseball championship tournament with the inaugural \\"World Series\\" that Fall of 1903, succeeding earlier similar national series in previous decades since the 1880s. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues also formalized the new World Series tournament beginning in 1905 as an arrangement between the leagues themselves. National League teams have won 49 of the 115 World Series championships contested from 1903 to 2019. History =Foundation= By 1875, the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP, often referred to as the \\"National Association\\"), founded four years earlier, was suffering from a lack of strong authority over clubs, unsupervised scheduling, unstable membership of cities, dominance by one team (the Boston Red Stockings), and an extremely low entry fee ($10) that gave clubs no incentive to abide by league rules when it was inconvenient to them. William A. Hulbert (1832‚Äì1882), a Chicago businessman and an officer of the Chicago White Stockings of 1870‚Äì1889, approached several NA clubs with the plans for a professional league for the sport of base ball with a stronger central authority and exclusive territories in larger cities only. Additionally, Hulbert had a problem: five of his star players were threatened with expulsion from the NAPBBP because Hulbert had signed them to his club using what were considered questionable means. Hulbert had a great vested interest in creating his own league, and after recruiting St. Louis privately, four western clubs met in Louisville, Kentucky, in January 1876. With Hulbert speaking for the four later in New York City on February 2, 1876, the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs was established with eight charter members, as follows: * Chicago (\\"Chicago White Stockings\\") according to The Baseball Encyclopedia's retroactive naming convention) from the NA (now the Chicago Cubs, not to be confused with the current Chicago White Sox of the American League) * Athletic Club of Philadelphia (\\"Philadelphia Athletics\\") from the NA (expelled after the 1876 season) * Boston (\\"Boston Red Stockings\\"), the dominant team in the NA (later the Boston Braves, then the Milwaukee Braves, now the Atlanta Braves, not to be confused with the present- day Boston Red Sox of the later American League) * Hartford (\\"Hartford Dark Blues\\") from the NA (folded after the 1877 season) * Mutual Club of New York (\\"New York Mutuals\\") from the NA (expelled after the 1876 season) * St. Louis (\\"St. Louis Brown Stockings\\") from the NA (folded after the 1877 season, having committed to Louisville stars for 1878) * Cincinnati (\\"Cincinnati Reds\\"), a new franchise (disbanded after the 1879 season) * Louisville (\\"Louisville Grays\\"), a new franchise (folded after the 1877 season when four players were banned for gambling) The National League's formation meant the end of the old National Association after only five seasons, as its remaining clubs shut down or reverted to amateur or minor league status. The only strong club from 1875 excluded in 1876 was a second one in Philadelphia, often called the White Stockings or later Phillies. The first game in National League history was played on April 22, 1876, at Philadelphia's Jefferson Street Grounds, at 25th & Jefferson Streets, between the Philadelphia Athletics and the Boston baseball club. Boston won the game 6‚Äì5. The new league's authority was soon tested after the first season. The Athletic and Mutual clubs fell behind in the standings and refused to make western road trips late in the season, preferring to play games against local non-league competition to recoup some of their financial losses rather than travel extensively incurring more costs. Hulbert reacted to the clubs' defiance by expelling them, an act which not only shocked baseball followers (New York and Philadelphia were the two most populous cities in the league) and the then sports world, but made it clear to clubs that league schedule commitments, a cornerstone of competition integrity, were not to be ignored. The National League operated with only six clubs during 1877 and 1878. Over the next several years, various teams joined and left the struggling league. By 1880, six of the eight charter members had folded. The two remaining original NL franchises, Boston and Chicago, remain still in operation today as the Atlanta Braves and the Chicago Cubs. When all eight participants for 1881 returned for 1882‚Äîthe first off-season without turnover in membership‚Äîthe \\"circuit\\" consisted of a zig-zag line connecting the eight cities: Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, Troy (near the state capital of Albany, New York), Worcester (Massachusetts), Boston, and Providence. In 1883, new New York and Philadelphia clubs began National League play. Both teams remain in the NL today, the Phillies in their original city and the New York franchise (later named Giants) now in San Francisco since 1958. =Competition with other leagues= The NL encountered its first strong rival organization when the American Association began play in 1882. The AA played in cities where the NL did not have teams, offered Sunday games and alcoholic beverages in locales where permitted, and sold cheaper tickets everywhere (25 cents versus the NL's standard 50 cents, a hefty sum for many in 1882). The NL struck back by establishing new clubs in 1883 in AA cities Philadelphia (later called \\"Phillies\\") and New York (the team that would become the Giants). The National League and the American Association participated in a version of the World Series seven times during their ten- year coexistence. These contests were less organized than the modern Series, lasting as few as three games and as many as fifteen, with two Series (1885 and 1890) ending in disputed ties. The NL won four times and the AA only once, in 1886. Starting with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1887, the National League began to raid the American Association for franchises to replace NL teams that folded. This undercut the stability of the AA. Other new leagues that rose to compete with the National League were the Union Association and the Players' League. The Union Association was established in 1884 and folded after playing only one season, its league champion St. Louis Maroons joining the NL. The Players' League was established in 1890 by the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players, the sport's first players' union, which had failed to persuade the NL to modify its labor practices, including a salary cap and a reserve clause that bound players to their teams indefinitely. The NL suffered many defections of star players to the Players' League, but the P.L. collapsed after one season. The Brooklyn, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and New York franchises of the NL absorbed their Players' League counterparts. =Expansion (1887‚Äì1899)= The labor strike of 1890 hastened the downfall of the American Association. After the 1891 season, the AA disbanded and merged with the NL, which became known legally for the next decade as the \\"National League and American Association\\". The teams now known as the Cincinnati Reds, Los Angeles Dodgers (originally Brooklyn) and Pittsburgh Pirates (as well as the now- defunct Cleveland Spiders) had already switched from the AA to the NL prior to 1892. With the merger, the NL absorbed the St. Louis Browns (now known as the St. Louis Cardinals), along with three other teams that did not survive into the 20th century (for those three teams, see Partnership with the American League below). While four teams that moved from the AA remain in the NL today (Pittsburgh [1887], Cincinnati [1890], Los Angeles [originally Brooklyn; 1890], and St. Louis [1892]), only two original NL franchises (1876) remain in the league: the Chicago Cubs and the Atlanta Braves (originally in Boston, and later Milwaukee). The Cubs are the only charter member to play continuously in the same city. The other two pre-1892 teams still in the league are the Philadelphia Phillies and the San Francisco Giants (originally New York), both of which joined in 1883. The National League became a 12-team circuit with monopoly status for the rest of the decade. The league became embroiled in numerous internal conflicts, not the least of which was a plan supported by some owners (and bitterly opposed by others) to form a \\"trust\\", wherein there would be one common ownership of all twelve teams. The NL used its monopsony power to force a $2,400 limit on annual player wages in 1894. As the 20th century dawned, the NL was in trouble. Conduct among players was poor, and fistfights were a common sight at games. In addition to fighting each other, they fought with the umpires and often filled the air at games with foul language and obscenities. A game between the Orioles and Boston Beaneaters (a precursor to today's Atlanta Braves) in 1894 ended up having tragic consequences when players became engaged in a brawl and several boys in the stands of the South End Grounds started a fire. The blaze quickly got out of hand and swept through downtown Boston, destroying or damaging 100 buildings. Team owners argued with each other and players hated the NL's $2,400 salary cap. Many teams also ran into trouble with city governments that forbade recreational activities on Sunday. Billy Sunday, a prominent outfielder in the 1880s, became so disgusted with the behavior of teammates that he quit playing in 1891 to become one of America's most famous evangelical Christian preachers. Most fans appear to have felt the same way, because attendance at games was plummeting by 1900. =Partnership with the American League= After eight seasons as a 12-team league, the NL contracted back to eight teams for the 1900 season, eliminating its teams in Baltimore, Cleveland, Louisville (which has never had another major league team since), and Washington. This provided an opportunity for competition. Three of those cities received franchises in the newly christened American League (AL) when the minor Western League changed its name to the AL in 1900, with the approval of the NL, which regarded the AL as a lesser league since they were a party to the National Agreement. The AL declined to renew its National Agreement membership when it expired the next year, and on January 28, 1901, the AL officially declared itself a second major league in competition with the NL. By 1903, the upstart AL had placed new teams in the National League cities of Boston, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis, as well as the \\"abandoned\\" NL cities Cleveland and Washington (and, temporarily, Baltimore). Only the Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates had no AL team in their markets. The AL among other things enforced a strict conduct policy among its players. The National League at first refused to recognize the new league, but reality set in as talent and money was split between the two leagues, diluting the league and decreasing financial success. After two years of bitter contention, a new version of the National Agreement was signed in 1903. This meant formal acceptance of each league by the other as an equal partner in major-league baseball, mutual respect of player contracts, and an agreement to play a postseason championship‚Äîthe World Series. Major League Baseball narrowly averted radical reorganization in November 1920. Dissatisfied with American League President and National Commission head Ban Johnson, NL owners dissolved the league on November 8 during heated talks on MLB reorganization in the wake of the Black Sox Scandal. Simultaneously, three AL teams also hostile to Johnson (Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox, and New York Yankees) withdrew from the AL and joined the eight NL teams in forming a new National League; the 12th team would be whichever of the remaining five AL teams loyal to Johnson first chose to join; if none did so an expansion team would have been placed in Detroit, by far the largest one-team city at that time. Four days later, on November 12, both sides met (without Johnson) and agreed to restore the two leagues and replace the ineffective National Commission with a one-man Commissioner in the person of federal Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis. The National League circuit remained unchanged from 1900 through 1952. In 1953 the Braves moved from Boston to Milwaukee; in 1966 they moved again, to Atlanta. In 1958 the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants moved to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively, bringing major league baseball to the West Coast of the U.S. for the first time. =Divisional reorganization= The NL remained an eight-team league for over 60 years. (For the eight teams, see Expansion (1887‚Äì1899) above, and \\"Classic Eight\\" below.) In 1962‚Äîfacing competition from the proposed Continental League and confronted by the American League's unilateral expansion in 1961‚Äîthe NL expanded by adding the New York Mets and the Houston Colt .45s. The \\"Colts\\" were renamed the Houston Astros three years later. In 1969, the league added the San Diego Padres and the Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals), becoming a 12-team league for the first time since 1899. In 1969, as a result of its expansion to 12 teams, the National League‚Äîwhich for its first 93 years had competed equally in a single grouping‚Äîwas reorganized into two divisions of six teams (respectively named the National League East and West, although geographically it was more like North and South), with the division champions meeting in the National League Championship Series (an additional round of postseason competition) for the right to advance to the World Series. In 1993 the league expanded to 14 teams, adding the Colorado Rockies and the Florida Marlins (which became the Miami Marlins shortly after the end of the 2011 season). In 1998, the Arizona Diamondbacks became the league's fifteenth franchise, and the Milwaukee Brewers moved from the AL to the NL, giving the NL 16 teams for the next 15 seasons. In 1994, the league was again reorganized, into three geographical divisions (East, West and Central, all currently with five teams; from 1994 to 1997 the West had one less team, and from 1998 to 2012, the Central had one more team). A third postseason round was added at the same time: the three division champions plus a wild card team (the team with the best record among those finishing in second place) now advance to the preliminary National League Division Series. Due to a players' strike, however, the postseason was not actually held in 1994. Before the 1998 season, the American League and the National League each added a fifteenth team. Because of the odd number of teams, only seven games could possibly be scheduled in each league on any given day. Thus, one team in each league would have to be idle on any given day. This would have made it difficult for scheduling, in terms of travel days and the need to end the season before October. In order for MLB officials to continue primarily intraleague play, both leagues would need to carry an even number of teams, so the decision was made to move one club from the AL Central to the NL Central. Eventually, Milwaukee agreed (after Kansas City declined) to change leagues; the National League now had 16 teams, the American League 14 with the switch.For more details, see Milwaukee Brewers#1994‚Äì98: Realignment / \\"We're taking this thing National\\". =Designated hitter rule= Often characterized as being a more \\"traditional\\" or \\"pure\\" league, the National League did not adopt the designated hitter rule that until the shortened 2020 season; the American League previously adopted the rule in 1973. In theory, this meant the role of the manager was greater in the National League than in the American, because the NL manager must take offense into account when making pitching substitutions and vice versa. However, this was disputed by some, such as former Detroit Tigers manager Jim Leyland, who claimed the American League is more difficult because AL managers are required to know exactly when to pull a pitcher, where an NL manager merely pulls his pitcher when that spot comes up in the batting order. Overall, there were fewer home runs and runs scored in the National League than in the American, due to the presence of the pitcher in the NL batting order. From the 1970s until the early 1990s, the use of artificial turf in place of natural grass was far more prevalent in National League ballparks than in the American League. As the collective bargaining agreement came closer to expiring after the 2021 season, owners expressed their intentions to use the designated hitter in all games starting in 2022. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, rule changes were instituted in both leagues for the 2020 season, which included an abbreviated 60 game schedule, the use of the designated hitter in all games, and expanded rosters. Discussions continued at that point as to whether the designated hitter would return for 2021.Brookover, Bob (May 11, 2020) COVID-19 accelerating changes that will be part of baseball forever Philadelphia Inquirer. Retrieved 2020-07-30. =Permanent interleague play= For the first 96 years of its coexistence with the American League, National League teams faced their AL counterparts only in exhibition games or in the World Series. Beginning in 1997, however, interleague games have been played during the regular season and count in the standings. As part of the agreement instituting interleague play, the American League's designated-hitter rule is used only in games where the American League team is the home team. In 1999, the offices of American League and National League presidents were discontinued and all authority was vested in the Commissioner's office. The leagues subsequently appointed \\"honorary\\" presidents to carry out ceremonial roles such as the awarding of league championship trophies. Additionally, the distinction between AL and NL umpires was erased, and instead all umpires were unified under MLB control. Following these actions, as well as the institution of interleague play, little remains to differentiate between the two leagues. By 2011, MLB had changed its policy on interleague play, deciding to schedule interleague games throughout the season rather than only during specially designated periods. This policy would allow each league to have 15 teams, with one team in each league playing an interleague game on any given day. As a condition of the sale of the Astros to Jim Crane in November 2011, the team agreed to move to the American League effective with the 2013 season.For more details, see Houston Astros#2012‚Äìpresent: Jim Crane era and move to the American League. =Champions= As of the end of the 2020 season, the Dodgers have won the most NL pennants, with 24. Representing the National League against the American, the Cardinals have won the most World Series (11) followed by the Giants (8), Dodgers (6), Pirates (5), and Reds (5). St. Louis also holds the distinction of being the only AA club to defeat an NL club in the 19th-century version of the World Series, having done so against their now-division rival Cubs. Teams Note: Team names are given here according to the convention used by The Baseball Encyclopedia, which regularized them into the familiar form of modern team names. However, most teams in the early period had no name, aside from that of the club (as in \\"Hartford Base Ball Club\\" or \\"Athletic Base Ball Club of Philadelphia\\"), and nicknames like \\"Beaneaters,\\" \\"Perfectos\\" and the many allusions to uniform colors were inventions by the florid sportswriters of the day.According to the National League's 1877 Constitution, the member clubs were given as \\"Boston B.

(Before the 1998 season, the American League and the National League each added a fifteenth team. Because of the odd number of teams, only seven games could possibly be scheduled in each league on any given day. Thus, one team in each league would have to be idle on any given day, or there would have to be at least one interleague game almost every day. This would have made it difficult for scheduling. To avoid this problem, Milwaukee agreed to change leagues; this gave the National League 16 teams, the American League 14.) *2005: Montreal Expos moved by MLB to Washington, D.C., renamed the Washington Nationals *2012: Florida Marlins renamed the Miami Marlins *2013: Houston Astros moved to the American League West (Interleague play is expanded to occur throughout the season to accommodate each league; both leagues now have fifteen teams each.) =Current teams= National League East Shea Stadium prior to the start of a New York Mets game in 2008.

The screenplay by Julian Barry is based on his play of the same name. Plot The film jumps between various sections of Bruce's life, including scenes of when he was in his prime and the burned-out, strung-out performer who, in the twilight of his life, used his nightclub act to pour out his personal frustrations. We watch as up-and-coming Bruce courts his \\"Shiksa goddess\\", a stripper named Honey. With family responsibilities, Lenny is encouraged to do a \\"safe\\" act, but he cannot do it. Constantly in trouble for flouting obscenity laws, Lenny develops a near-messianic complex which fuels both his comedy genius and his talent for self-destruction. Worn out by a lifetime of tilting at establishment windmills, Lenny Bruce dies of a morphine overdose in 1966.

One of the less enthusiastic reviews came from Roger Ebert stating \\"Unless we go in convinced that Lenny Bruce was an important performer, the movie doesn't convince us.\\" In 2012, British film critic Mark Kermode put Hoffman's performance as Lenny Bruce at number eight in a top-ten video of Hoffman's best performances. =Accolades = Although nominated for six Academy Awards in 1975, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Cinematography, Lenny did not receive an award.

He made his first appearance in the episode entitled \\"Grampa and the Kids\\", a one-minute Simpsons short on The Tracey Ullman Show, before the debut of the television show in 1989. Grampa Simpson is voiced by Dan Castellaneta, who also voices his son, Homer Simpson. He is also the paternal grandfather of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. In the 1000th issue of Entertainment Weekly, Grampa was selected as the Grandpa for \\"The Perfect TV Family\\".\\"TV: Breaking Down the List,\\" Entertainment Weekly, #999/1000 June 27 & July 4, 2008, 56. Grampa Simpson is a World War II veteran and retired farmer who was later sent to the Springfield Retirement Castle by Homer. He is known for his long, rambling, often incoherent and irrelevant stories and senility. Biography Grampa Simpson is the father to Homer Simpson, father-in-law to Marge Simpson and the paternal grandfather to siblings Bart, Lisa and Maggie. Grampa has also fathered two illegitimate children; a daughter named Abbie by a British woman named Edwina while in the United Kingdom during World War II, and Herbert Powell by a carnival prostitute. Grampa has an older brother named Cyrus, who lives in Tahiti and has multiple native wives. He also has a younger brother named Chet, who owns an unsuccessful shrimp company. Grampa was briefly married to Amber, the same woman Homer married on a drinking binge in Las Vegas. Grampa has also been briefly married to Marge's sister, Selma Bouvier, and was once romantically linked to Marge's mother, Jacqueline Bouvier. Grampa Simpson was also married to Rita LaFleur. Almost all of Grampa's biographical information is supplied by himself and seems to be made up, although this could be likely due to his old age. Many of his stories seem to be wildly inaccurate, often physically or historically impossible, and occasionally inconsistent even with each other, suggesting that Grampa is quite senile. It is unknown where Grampa was born. He claims that he came to America as a boy from the \\"old country\\", but he cannot remember which country it was, although most likely it was the United Kingdom or Ireland. Grampa was raised in New York City with his parents, Orville J. Simpson and Yuma Hickman. He gives his age as 83 in the Season 17 episode \\"Million Dollar Abie,\\" while in \\"Grampy Can Ya Hear Me\\" (season 29), the family celebrates his 87th birthday. In the Season 25 episode \\"The Winter of His Content,\\" Homer states that Grampa's father is still alive. Grampa is a veteran of World War II, where he served as Master Sergeant of the Flying Hellfish unit. At the very end of war in Europe, Grampa's unit \\"liberated\\" a stash of priceless art from surrendering German forces. The Flying Hellfish formed a tontine, and buried the art in a trunk at sea. Decades later, Montgomery Burns, the second surviving member of the unit, tried to murder Grampa in order to get the art, prompting Grampa to violate the tontine. When Grampa and Bart retrieved the art from Mr. Burns, the State Department arrived to return the art to its rightful owner. Grampa was a hated wrestler named \\"Glamorous Godfrey\\" in the 1950s, revealed in the episode \\"Gorgeous Grampa\\", starring him and Mr. Burns. Homer's mother, Mona Simpson, was married to Grampa for several years. According to \\"Let's Go Fly a Coot\\", they met in the 1950s and hooked up on the day Grampa allegedly broke the sound barrier. She became entranced with the hippie lifestyle after seeing Joe Namath's hair on television. She became a fugitive from justice after she abetted in the sabotage of a biological weapons research lab owned by Mr. Burns to deliberately poison everyone in Springfield. To explain this to his then-six-year-old son, Grampa said that Mona died while Homer was at the movies. Grampa has a poor, but sometimes loving relationship with his son, who placed him in a nursing home as soon as he could, despite Grampa selling his house in order to provide Homer with a mortgage. It is recurringly suggested that, while caring, Grampa was a strict disciplinarian who could be very controlling, neglectful, and even emotionally abusive towards Homer when he was growing up and he still had not forgiven him for that. Saying that, after Mona left Homer at a young age and run off with a jester, Grampa brought up Homer by himself without hesitation and he reveals his true nature. In the season four episode, \\"The Front\\", Grampa admits to head of Itchy and Scratchy studios, Roger Myers Jr., that he worked as a cranberry silo nightwatchman for forty-years. The Simpson family will often do their best to avoid unnecessary contact with Grampa. A running gag in the show usually has Grampa in a cameo episode appearance where he wonders where everyone is or wishes to be noticed by the family. One example of this was when the family thought they left something on the plane in the episode \\"Fear of Flying\\", which revealed to be Grampa. Despite this, Homer has shown feelings of love for his father from time to time. Character Dan Castellaneta voices Grampa and several other recurring characters =Creation= Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons, wanted to have a character that was \\"really cranky\\" and old, and who complained a lot and invented stories to tell to children, so he created Grampa. After naming the main characters after his own family members (except for Bart, an anagram of \\"brat\\", which he substituted for his own name), Groening refused to name Grampa after his grandfather, Abraham Groening. He left it to the writers to choose a name and they chose \\"Abraham\\", not knowing that it was also the name of Groening's grandfather. Grampa first appeared in the Simpsons short \\"Grampa and the Kids\\", which premiered on The Tracey Ullman Show on January 10, 1988. In the short, Grampa tells his grandchildren stories of \\"the good old days\\". When they stop paying attention to him, he feigns his own death to recapture their attention. The Simpsons writer Al Jean commented that Grampa is often the focus of pointed jokes about old people. He said the reason for that is because the staff is trying to illustrate how society mistreats the elderly, \\"and some of it is because people over 55 never watch our show\\". Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, former writers on the show, said that they liked to write episodes about Grampa because they are \\"obsessed\\" with old people. Weinstein commented that they \\"both love [old people] and seem to really hate them at the same time\\". He also said that he \\"enjoys\\" writing for characters such as Grampa and Mr. Burns because of their \\"out- datedness\\", and because he gets to use dictionaries for looking up \\"old time slang\\". =Voice= Grampa's voice is performed by Dan Castellaneta, who also voices numerous other characters, including Homer Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Barney Gumble, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby and Hans Moleman. Castellaneta was part of the regular cast of The Tracey Ullman Show and had previously done some voice-over work in Chicago alongside his wife Deb Lacusta. Castellaneta likes to stay in character during recording sessions, and tries to visualize a scene in his mind so that he can give the proper voice to it.Castellaneta, Dan. (2005). Commentary for \\"Homer the Great\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The episode \\"Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy\\" (season six, 1994) featured many interactions between Grampa and Homer, so Castellaneta therefore had to talk to himself when he recorded the voices for that episode. Castellaneta said it is hard for him to do Grampa's voice because it is \\"wheezy and airy\\". Reception =Commendations= Nancy Basile of About.com named Grampa the fifth best character of The Simpsons, calling him a \\"perfect stereotypical old person\\". In the 1000th issue of Entertainment Weekly, Grampa was selected as the \\"Grandpa for The Perfect TV Family\\". Joe Rhodes of TV Guide considered Grampa's most memorable line to be \\"If I'm not back at the home by nine, they declare me legally dead and collect my insurance.\\" Dan Castellaneta has won two Primetime Emmy Awards in the Outstanding Voice-Over Performance category for voicing various characters, including Grampa. The first was awarded in 1992 for the episode \\"Lisa's Pony\\", and the second in 2004 for \\"Today I Am A Clown\\". In 2010, Castellaneta was nominated for the award for voicing Grampa and Homer in the episode \\"Thursdays with Abie\\". The Simpsons writer David Mirkin said that one of his favorite jokes on the show is the one where Grampa cycles down the street in high speed and shouts that he feels young again, and is then knocked flying from his bicycle after a doll's head flies into the spokes and falls into an open grave. In a review of the Grampa-centric episode \\"Lady Bouvier's Lover\\", Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict said that he is \\"never terribly interested\\" in episodes that revolve around Grampa, because he believes Grampa is \\"great as a background character, but less so when he takes center stage.\\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said in a review of the same episode that Grampa is \\"always fun\\" and \\"it‚Äôs nice to see him in an ebullient mood, at least for a while.\\" =Analysis= alt=A seated David Mirkin wearing a cap smiles as he looks into the distance. His hands are crossed. Mirkin thinks it is hard to make a \\"boring\\" and \\"tedious\\" character, such as Grampa, funny. He believes that what ultimately makes Grampa funny is that the things he says are \\"actually funny\\" in the context of the boredom and the tedium. Anne-Marie Barry and Chris Yuill, the authors of the book Understanding the Sociology of Health, commented that in episodes in which Grampa appears, the comedy content is often generated by Grampa falling asleep at \\"inopportune\\" moments or \\"embarking\\" on long rambling stories about his youth. \\"Instances such as these match popular stereotypes that all old people are 'demented' and in poor health,\\" they wrote. Alan S. Brown and Chris Logan wrote in The Psychology of The Simpsons that Grampa has the least amount of \\"power\\" in the Simpson family, and that he is treated as little more than a child and is often ignored. The family frequently laughs at his \\"failing\\" memory and his \\"ineffectual\\" attempts to get what he wants. They added that Grampa is left behind, forgotten, and rarely invited to spend time with the family. The authors commented that he is \\"not without influence, but he certainly does not play the traditional grandfather role in the family hierarchy.\\" Brown and Logan also wrote that Grampa had a considerable influence in the formation of Homer's character, and that flashbacks in The Simpsons show what an \\"angry\\", \\"critical\\" father he was to Homer. \\"He yelled, used corporal punishment, and constantly belittled Homer's attempts to have fun, date, and excel at various activities,\\" they added. The authors said that Homer tries \\"in vain\\" to repair his relationship with Grampa and continuously seeks for his approval, but Grampa continues to be \\"as critical as ever\\". In his book Understanding the Psychology of Diversity, author Bruce Evan Blaine wrote that Grampa is typically portrayed as a \\"doddering\\", \\"senile\\", and \\"dependent\\" person who is a \\"trivial\\" and \\"often disposable figure\\" in his son's life. Merchandising Playmates Toys created two Grampa Simpson action figures for the World of Springfield series. The first, released in May 2000, depicts Grampa in his usual appearance. The second, \\"Sunday Grampa\\", was released in June 2002, and depicts Grampa in his Sunday church clothes. Alongside the television series, Grampa regularly appears in issues of Simpsons Comics, which were first published on November 29, 1993. The final issue was published on October 17, 2018. Grampa also plays a role in The Simpsons Ride, launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood.

He is voiced by Nancy Cartwright and first appeared on television in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\" on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed Bart while waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip, Life in Hell, but instead decided to create a new set of characters. While the rest of the characters were named after Groening's family members, Bart's name is an anagram of the word brat. After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for three years, the Simpson family received its own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989. Bart has appeared in every Simpsons episode except \\"Four Great Women and a Manicure\\". At ten years old, Bart is the eldest child and only son of Homer and Marge, and the brother of Lisa and Maggie. Bart's most prominent and popular character traits are his mischievousness, rebelliousness and disrespect for authority. Hallmarks of the character include his chalkboard gags in the opening sequence; his prank calls to Moe; and his catchphrases \\"Eat my shorts\\", \\"¬°Ay, caramba!\\", \\"Don't have a cow, man!\\", and \\"I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?\\". However, the exception of \\"Ay, caramba!\\", these hallmarks have been retired or not often used. Bart has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons ‚Äì including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials, and comic books ‚Äì and inspired an entire line of merchandise. In casting, Cartwright originally planned to audition for the role of Lisa, while Yeardley Smith tried out for Bart. Smith's voice was too high for a boy, so she was given the role of Lisa. Cartwright found that Lisa was not interesting at the time, so instead auditioned for Bart, which she thought was a better role. During the first two seasons of The Simpsons, Bart was the show's breakout character and \\"Bartmania\\" ensued, spawning Bart Simpson-themed merchandise touting his rebellious attitude and pride at underachieving, which caused many parents and educators to cast him as a bad role model for children. Around the third season, the series started to focus more on the family as a whole, though Bart still remains a prominent character. Time named Bart one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century, and he was named \\"entertainer of the year\\" in 1990 by Entertainment Weekly. Cartwright has won several awards for voicing Bart, including a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992 and an Annie Award in 1995. In 2000, Bart, along with the rest of his family, was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Role in The Simpsons The Simpsons uses a floating timeline in which the characters do not age or age very little, and as such, the show is always assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Bart's year of birth was stated in \\"I Married Marge\\" (season three, 1991) as being in the early 1980s. In \\"Simpsorama\\" (season 26, 2014) Bart states his birthday as February 23. \\"February 23rd.\\" \\"Ha! February has no 23rd!\\" \\"Yes it does!\\" He lived with his parents in the Lower East Side of Springfield until the Simpsons bought their first house. When Lisa was born, Bart was at first jealous of the attention she received, but he soon warmed to her when he discovered that \\"Bart\\" was her first word. Bart's first day of school was in the early 1990s. His initial enthusiasm was crushed by an uncaring teacher and Marge became worried that something was truly wrong with Bart. One day during recess, Bart met Milhouse and started entertaining him and other students with various gestures and rude words. Principal Skinner told him \\"you've just started school, and the path you choose now may be the one you follow for the rest of your life! Now, what do you say?\\" In his moment of truth, Bart responded, \\"eat my shorts\\". The episode \\"That '90s Show\\" (season nineteen, 2008) contradicted much of the backstory's time frame; for example, it was revealed that Homer and Marge were childless in the early 1990s. Bart's hobbies include skateboarding, watching television (especially The Krusty the Clown Show which includes The Itchy & Scratchy Show), reading comic books (especially Radioactive Man), playing video games and generally causing mischief. His favorite movies are Jaws and the Star Wars Trilogy. For the duration of the series, Bart has attended Springfield Elementary School and has been in Edna Krabappel's fourth grade class. While he is too young to hold a full-time job, he has had occasional part-time jobs. He works as a bartender at Fat Tony's social club in \\"Bart the Murderer\\" (season three, 1991); as Krusty the Clown's assistant in \\"Bart Gets Famous\\" (season five, 1994); as a doorman in Springfield's burlesque house, the Maison Derri√®re, in \\"Bart After Dark\\" (season eight, 1996); and briefly owns his own factory in \\"Homer's Enemy\\" (season eight, 1997). Character =Creation= alt=A man in glasses and a plaid shirt sits in front of a microphone. Matt Groening first conceived of Bart and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986, while waiting in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show, and had intended to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening decided to go in another direction. He hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family, naming the characters after members of his own family. For the rebellious son, he substituted \\"Bart\\", an anagram of the word brat, for his own name, as he decided it would have been too obvious for him to have named the character 'Matt'. Bart's middle initial J is a \\"tribute\\" to animated characters such as Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, who received their middle initial from Jay Ward.Groening, Matt. (2007). Commentary for \\"D'oh-in' in the Wind\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. According to the book Bart Simpson's Guide to Life, Bart's full middle name is \\"JoJo\\". Bart had originally been envisioned as \\"a much milder, troubled youth given to existential angst who talks to himself\\", but the character was changed based on Cartwright's voice acting. Groening has credited several different figures with providing inspiration for Bart: Matt Groening's older brother Mark provided much of the motivation for Bart's attitude.Groening, Matt. (2006). Commentary for \\"My Sister, My Sitter\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.Groening, Matt. (2006). Commentary for \\"Bart Carny\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Bart was conceived as an extreme version of the typical misbehaving child character, merging all of the extreme traits of characters such as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn into one person. Groening describes Bart as \\"what would happen if Eddie Haskell [from Leave It to Beaver] got his own show\\". Groening has also said that he found the premise of Dennis the Menace disappointing and was inspired to create a character who was actually a menace.Groening, Matt. (2005). Commentary for \\"Two Bad Neighbors\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Bart made his debut with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987 in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\". In 1989, the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons, a half-hour series airing on the Fox Broadcasting Company. Bart and the Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show. =Design= \\"Good Night\\". The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette.Groening, Matt. (2005). Commentary for \\"Fear of Flying\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. Bart's original design, which appeared in the first shorts, had spikier hair, and the spikes were of different lengths. The number was later limited to nine spikes, all of the same size.Silverman, David; Archer, Wes. (2004). Illustrated commentary for \\"Treehouse of Horror IV\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. At the time Groening was primarily drawing in black and \\"not thinking that [Bart] would eventually be drawn in color\\" gave him spikes which appear to be an extension of his head.Anderson, Mike B.; Groening, Matt; Michels, Pete; Smith, Yeardley. (2006). \\"A Bit From the Animators\\", Illustrated Commentary for \\"All Singing, All Dancing\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The features of Bart's character design are generally not used in other characters; for example, no other characters in current episodes have Bart's spiky hairline, although several background characters in the first few seasons shared the trait.Groening, Matt; Reiss, Mike; Kirkland, Mark. (2002). Commentary for \\"Principal Charming\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The basic rectangular shape of Bart's head is described by director Mark Kirkland as a coffee can. Homer's head is also rectangular (with a dome on top), while spheres are used for Marge, Lisa, and Maggie.Archer, Wes; Groening, Matt; Kirkland, Mark. (2005). \\"A Bit From the Animators\\", Illustrated Commentary for \\"Summer of 4 Ft. 2\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Different animators have different methods of drawing Bart. Former director Jeffrey Lynch starts off with a box, then adds the eyes, then the mouth, then the hair spikes, ear, and then the rest of the body. Matt Groening normally starts with the eyes, then the nose, and the rest of the outline of Bart's head. Many of the animators have trouble drawing Bart's spikes evenly; one trick they use is to draw one on the right, one on the left, one in the middle, then continue to add one in the middle of the blank space until there are nine. Originally, whenever Bart was to be drawn from an angle looking down so the top of his head was seen, Groening wanted there to be spikes along the outline of his head, and in the middle as well. Instead, Wes Archer and David Silverman drew him so that there was an outline of the spikes, then just a smooth patch in the middle because \\"it worked graphically.\\"Groening, Matt; Lynch, Jeffrey; Reardon, Jim; Silverman, David. (2005). Illustrated Commentary for \\"Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part One)\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In \\"The Blue and the Gray\\", Bart (along with Lisa and Maggie) finally questions why his hair has no visible border to separate head from hair. In the season seven (1995) episode \\"Treehouse of Horror VI\\", Bart (along with Homer) was computer animated into a three-dimensional character for the first time for the \\"Homer3\\" segment of the episode. The computer animation was provided by Pacific Data Images. While designing the 3D model of the character, the animators did not know how they would show Bart's hair. They realized that there were vinyl Bart dolls in production and purchased one to use as a model.Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh; Johnson, Tim; Silverman, David; Mirkin, David; Cohen, David X. \\"Homer in the Third Dimension\\" (2005), in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. =Voice= Nancy Cartwright is the voice of Bart Simpson. Bart's voice is provided by Nancy Cartwright, who voices several other child characters on The Simpsons, including Nelson Muntz, Ralph Wiggum, Todd Flanders, and Kearney. While the roles of Homer and Marge were given to Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner because they were already a part of The Tracey Ullman Show cast, the producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa. Yeardley Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila believed her voice was too high. Smith later recalled, \\"I always sounded too much like a girl. I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'\\" Smith was given the role of Lisa instead. On March 13, 1987, Nancy Cartwright went in to audition for the role of Lisa. After arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the \\"middle child\\" and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart, who was described as \\"devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [and] clever\\".Cartwright, pp. 35‚Äì40 Matt Groening let her try out for the part instead, and upon hearing her read, gave her the job on the spot. Cartwright is the only one of the six main Simpsons cast members who had been professionally trained in voice acting prior to working on the show. Cartwright's normal speaking voice is said to have \\"no obvious traces of Bart\\". The voice came naturally to Cartwright; prior to The Tracey Ullman Show, she had used elements of it in shows such as My Little Pony, Snorks, and Pound Puppies. Cartwright describes Bart's voice as easy to perform, saying, \\"Some characters take a little bit more effort, upper respiratory control, whatever it is technically. But Bart is easy to do. I can just slip into that without difficulty.\\" She usually does five or six readings of every line in order to give the producers more to work with. In flashforward episodes, Cartwright still provides the voice of Bart. For \\"Lisa's Wedding\\", (season six, 1995) Bart's voice was electronically lowered.Mirkin, David. (2005). Commentary for \\"Lisa's Wedding\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Despite Bart's fame, Cartwright is rarely recognized in public. When she is recognized and asked to perform Bart's voice in front of children, Cartwright refuses as it \\"freaks [them] out\\". During the first season of The Simpsons, the Fox Network did not allow Cartwright to give interviews because they did not want to publicize that Bart was voiced by a woman. Until 1998, Cartwright was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing for casting of new voices. The dispute was resolved and Cartwright received $125,000 per episode until 2004, when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode. The dispute was resolved a month later, and Cartwright's pay rose to $250,000 per episode. After salary renegotiations in 2008, the voice actors receive approximately $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Cartwright and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut to just over $300,000 per episode. =Hallmarks= In the opening sequence of many Simpsons episodes, the camera zooms in on Springfield Elementary School, where Bart can be seen writing a message on the chalkboard. This message, which changes from episode to episode, has become known as the \\"chalkboard gag\\". Chalkboard messages may involve political humor such as \\"The First Amendment does not cover burping\\", pop culture references such as \\"I can't see dead people\\", and meta-references such as \\"I am not a 32-year-old woman\\" and \\"Nobody reads these anymore\\". The animators are able to produce the chalkboard gags quickly and in some cases have changed them to fit current events. For example, the chalkboard gag for \\"Homer the Heretic\\" (season four, 1992) read, \\"I will not defame New Orleans.\\" The gag had been written as an apology to the city for a controversial song in the previous week's episode, \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\", which called the city a \\"home of pirates, drunks and whores\\".Martin, Jeff (2004). \\"The Cajun Controversy\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Many episodes do not feature a chalkboard gag because a shorter opening title sequence, where the chalkboard gags are cut, is used to make more room for story and plot development. One of Bart's early hallmarks were his prank calls to Moe's Tavern owner Moe Szyslak in which Bart calls Moe and asks for a gag name. Moe tries to find that person in the bar, but rapidly realizes it is a prank call and (despite not knowing who actually made the call) angrily threatens Bart. These calls were based on a series of prank calls known as the Tube Bar recordings. Moe was based partly on Tube Bar owner Louis \\"Red\\" Deutsch, whose often profane responses inspired Moe's violent side. The prank calls debuted in \\"Homer's Odyssey\\", (season one, 1990) the third episode to air, but were included in \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\", the first episode of the series that was produced.Brooks, James L.; Groening, Matt; Jean, Al. (2001). Commentary for \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. As the series progressed, it became more difficult for the writers to come up with a fake name and to write Moe's angry response, so the pranks were dropped as a regular joke during the fourth seasonReiss, Mike. (2001). Commentary for \\"Moaning Lisa\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. but they have occasionally resurfaced on the show. The catchphrase \\"Eat My Shorts\\" was an ad-lib by Cartwright in one of the original table readings, harking back to an incident when she was in high school. Cartwright was in the marching band at Fairmont High School, and one day while performing, the band chanted \\"Eat my shorts\\" rather than the usual \\"Fairmont West! Fairmont West!\\"It could also be an homage to The Breakfast Club, as John Bender says the phrase at Principal Vernon, and John Bender would become the inspiration for another Matt Groening creation, Bender from Futurama. Bart's other catchphrases, \\"¬°Ay, caramba!\\" came from a Portuguese flamenco dancer and \\"Don't have a cow!\\" had been around since the 1950s which derived from the British phrase \\"Don't have kittens\\"; both were featured on T-shirts manufactured during the production of the early seasons of The Simpsons. \\"Cowabunga\\" is also commonly associated with Bart, although it was mostly used on the show after it had been used as a slogan on the T-shirts. Reiss also stated the writers took the phrase from Chief Thunderthud on The Howdy Doody Show. The use of catchphrase-based humor was mocked in the episode \\"Bart Gets Famous\\" (season five, 1994) in which Bart lands a popular role on Krusty the Clown's show for saying the line \\"I didn't do it.\\" The writers chose the phrase \\"I didn't do it\\" because they wanted a \\"lousy\\" phrase \\"to point out how really crummy things can become really popular\\".Mirkin, David. (2004). Commentary for \\"Bart Gets Famous\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Bart's nude scene in The Simpsons Movie. Bart commonly appears nude in the show, although in every case only his buttocks are visible. In The Simpsons Movie (2007), Bart appears in a sequence where he is skateboarding while fully nude; several different items cover his genitalia, but for a brief moment his penis can be seen. The scene was one of the first worked on for the film, but the producers were nervous about the segment because they thought it would earn the movie an R rating.Brooks, James L.; Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Scully, Mike; Silverman, David; Castellaneta, Dan; Smith, Yeardley. (2007). Commentary for The Simpsons Movie [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Despite this, the film was rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for \\"Irreverent Humor Throughout.\\" The scene was later included by Entertainment Weekly in their list of \\"30 Unforgettable Nude Scenes.\\" =Personality= Bart's character traits of rebelliousness and disrespect for authority have been compared to that of America's founding fathers, and he has been described as an updated version of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, rolled into one. In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner describes Bart as a nihilist, a philosophical position that argues that existence is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Bart's rebellious attitude has made him a disruptive student at Springfield Elementary School, where Bart is an underachiever and proud of it. He is constantly at odds with his teacher Ms. Krabappel, Principal Skinner, and occasionally Groundskeeper Willie. Bart does poorly in school and is well aware of it, having once declared, \\"I am dumb, okay? Dumb as a post! Think I'm happy about it?\\" On one occasion, Lisa successfully proves that Bart is dumber than a hamster, although Bart ultimately outsmarts her in the end. In \\"Separate Vocations\\" (season three, 1992) Bart becomes hall monitor and his grades go up, suggesting that he struggles mainly because he does not pay attention, not because he is stupid. This idea is reinforced in \\"Brother's Little Helper\\", (season eleven, 1999) in which it is revealed that Bart suffers from attention deficit disorder. His lack of smarts can also be attributed to the hereditary \\"Simpson Gene\\", which affects the intelligence of most male members of the Simpson family. Although he gets into endless trouble and can be sadistic, shallow and selfish, Bart also exhibits many qualities of high integrity. He has, on a few occasions, helped Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel: In \\"Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song\\" (season five, 1994), Bart accidentally got Skinner fired and befriended him outside the school environment. Bart missed having Skinner as an adversary and got him rehired, knowing that this would mean that the two could no longer be friends. Due to Bart's mischievousness and Homer's often uncaring and incompetent behavior, the two have a turbulent, jaded, violent, and at times borderline sadistic relationship. Bart regularly addresses Homer by his given name instead of \\"Dad\\", while Homer in turn often refers to him as \\"the boy\\". Homer has a short temper and when enraged by Bart will strangle him on impulse in a cartoonishly violent manner.Groening, Matt. (2002). Commentary for \\"Simpson and Delilah\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. One of the original ideas for the show was that Homer would be \\"very angry\\" and oppressive toward Bart, but these characteristics were toned down somewhat as their characters were explored.Groening, Matt. (2004). Commentary for \\"Marge on the Lam\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Marge is a much more caring, understanding and nurturing parent than Homer, but she also refers to Bart as \\"a handful\\" and is often embarrassed by his antics. In \\"Marge Be Not Proud\\", (season seven, 1995) she felt she was mothering Bart too much and began acting more distant towards him after he was caught shoplifting. At the beginning of the episode, Bart protested at her over-mothering but as her attitude changed, he felt bad and made it up to her. Despite his attitude, Bart is sometimes willing to experience humiliation if it means pleasing his mom. Marge has expressed an understanding for her \\"special little guy\\" and has defended him on many occasions. She once said \\"I know Bart can be a handful, but I also know what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing... Of course, it makes him do bad things.\\" Bart shares a sibling rivalry with his younger sister, Lisa, but has a buddy-like relationship with his youngest sister Maggie, due to her infant state. While Bart has often hurt Lisa, and even fought her physically, the two are often very close. Bart cares for Lisa deeply and has always apologized for going too far. He also believes Lisa to be his superior when it comes to solving problems and frequently goes to her for advice. Bart is also highly protective of Lisa: When a bully destroys her box of cupcakes in \\"Bart the General\\", (season one, 1990), Bart immediately stands up for her. Bart is portrayed as a popular cool boy and has many friends at school. Out of all of them his best friend is Milhouse Van Houten, although Bart has at times shown embarrassment about their friendship. Bart is a bad influence on Milhouse, and the two have been involved in a lot of mischief together. Because of this behavior, Milhouse's mother forbids Milhouse from playing with Bart in \\"Homer Defined\\" (season three, 1991). While at first he pretended that he did not care, Bart eventually realizes that he needs Milhouse, and Marge manages to convince Mrs. Van Houten to reconsider. Milhouse is a frequent target for local bullies Nelson Muntz and his friends Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney. At times, Bart also finds himself at the hands of their abuse. Despite being the more socially powerful of the two, Bart's social popularity has temporarily subsided various episodes either due to extreme embarrassment caused by his family or other people (or even himself) or an unfortunate coincidence. Milhouse describes their social standing as \\"Three and a half. We get beat up, but we get an explanation.\\" While Bart and the bullies have been adversaries at times, with Bart once declaring war on Nelson, the school bullies actually like Bart for his ways and hang out with him at times, especially Nelson who eventually becomes close friends with him. Bart is one of the biggest fans of children's television host Krusty the Clown. He once declared, \\"I've based my whole life on Krusty's teachings,\\" and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He has helped the clown on many occasions, for example, foiling Sideshow Bob's attempt to frame Krusty for armed robbery in \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\" (season one, 1990), reuniting Krusty with his estranged father in \\"Like Father, Like Clown\\". and helping Krusty return to the air with a comeback special and reignite his career in \\"Krusty Gets Kancelled\\". For his part, Krusty has remained largely ignorant of Bart's help and treats Bart with disinterest. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attended Kamp Krusty, which turned out to be a disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen. Bart keeps his hopes up by believing that Krusty would show up, but is soon pushed over the edge, and finally decides that he is sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and takes over the camp. Krusty immediately visits the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and manages to appease Bart. One of the original ideas for the series was that Bart worshiped a television clown but had no respect for his father, although this was never directly explored. Because of this original plan, Krusty's design is basically Homer in clown make-up. When Bart foiled Sideshow Bob's plans in \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\", it sparked a long-standing feud between the two. The writers decided to have Bob repeatedly return to get revenge on Bart. They took the idea of the Coyote chasing the Road Runner and depicted Bob as an intelligent person obsessed with catching a bratty boy.Jean, Al. (2003). Commentary for \\"Black Widower\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Bob has appeared in fourteen episodes, generally plotting various evil schemes which often have to do with getting revenge on Bart (and sometimes the entire Simpson family by proxy), but is always foiled in the end. Reception and cultural influence =Bartmania= In 1990, Bart quickly became one of the most popular characters on television in what was termed \\"Bartmania\\". He became the most prevalent Simpsons character on memorabilia, such as T-shirts. In the early 1990s, millions of T-shirts featuring Bart were sold; as many as one million were sold on some days. Believing Bart to be a bad role model, several American public schools banned T-shirts featuring Bart next to captions such as \\"I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?\\" and \\"Underachiever ('And proud of it, man!')\\".Burey, Chris. (1990). ABC News report about the Bart Simpson T-shirt controversy included as an Easter Egg in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season (2001) [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The Simpsons merchandise sold well and generated $2 billion in revenue during the first 14 months of sales. The success of Bart Simpson merchandise inspired an entire line of black market counterfeit items, especially T-shirts. Some featured Bart announcing various slogans, others depicted redesigns of the character, including \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Bart, Air Simpson Bart, [and] RastaBart\\". Matt Groening generally did not object to bootleg merchandise, but took exception to a series of \\"Nazi Bart\\" shirts which depicted Bart in Nazi uniform or as a white power skinhead. 20th Century Fox sued the creator of the shirts, who eventually agreed to stop making them. Michael Jackson, who was a fan of Bart, provided back up vocals for \\"Do the Bartman\\". Bart became so associated with Fox that, when bidding in 1993 to show pro football, the network had to assure the NFL and reporters that the character would not announce games. Due to the show's success, over the summer of 1990 Fox decided to switch The Simpsons' timeslot so that it would move from 8:00 p.m. ET on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday, where it would compete with The Cosby Show on NBC, the number one show at the time. Through the summer, several news outlets published stories about the supposed \\"Bill vs. Bart\\" rivalry.Brooks, James L.; Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike; Silverman, David. (2002). Commentary for \\"Bart Gets an \\"F\\"\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The August 31, 1990 issue of Entertainment Weekly featured a picture of Bill Cosby wearing a Bart Simpson T-shirt. \\"Bart Gets an \\"F\\"\\" (season two, 1990) was the first episode to air against The Cosby Show, and it received a lower Nielsen rating, tying for eighth behind The Cosby Show, which had an 18.5 rating. The rating is based on the number of household televisions that were tuned into the show, but Nielsen Media Research estimated that 33.6 million viewers watched the episode, making it the number one show in terms of actual viewers that week. At the time, it was the most watched episode in the history of the Fox Network, and it is still the highest rated episode in the history of The Simpsons. Because of his popularity, Bart was often the most promoted member of the Simpson family in advertisements for the show, even for episodes in which he was not involved in the main plot.Groening, Matt; Jean, Reiss; Moore, Rich; Reiss, Mike; Vitti, Jon. (2002). Commentary for \\"Lisa's Substitute\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Bart was described as \\"television's king of 1990\\", \\"television's brightest new star\\" and an \\"undiminished smash\\". Entertainment Weekly named Bart the \\"entertainer of the year\\" for 1990, writing that \\"Bart has proved to be a rebel who's also a good kid, a terror who's easily terrorized, and a flake who astonishes us, and himself, with serious displays of fortitude.\\" In the United States congressional, senatorial and gubernatorial elections of 1990, Bart was one of the most popular write-in candidates, and in many areas was second only to Mickey Mouse amongst fictional characters. In the 1990 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Bart made his debut as one of the giant helium-filled balloons for which the parade is known. The Bart Simpson balloon has appeared at every parade since. This was referenced in The Simpsons in the episode \\"Bart vs. Thanksgiving\\", which aired the same day as the parade, where Homer tells Bart, \\"If you start building a balloon for every flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, you turn the parade into a farce!\\" Meanwhile, behind and unbeknownst to him, the television briefly shows a Bart Simpson balloon. The album The Simpsons Sing the Blues was released in September 1990 and was a success, peaking at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and becoming certified 2x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The first single from the album was the pop rap song \\"Do the Bartman\\", performed by Nancy Cartwright and released on November 20, 1990. The song was written by Bryan Loren, a friend of Michael Jackson. Jackson was a fan of The Simpsons, especially Bart,Cartwright, pp. 115‚Äì117 and had called the producers one night offering to write Bart a number one single and do a guest spot on the show.Brooks, James L. (2003). Commentary for \\"Stark Raving Dad\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Jackson eventually guest starred in the episode \\"Stark Raving Dad\\" (season three, 1991) under the pseudonym John Jay Smith. While the song was never officially released as a single in the United States, it was successful in the United Kingdom. In 1991 it was the number one song in the UK for three weeks from February 16 to March 9 and was the seventh best-selling song of the year. It sold half a million copies and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry on February 1, 1991. =Bart as a role model= Bart's rebellious nature, which frequently resulted in no punishment for his misbehavior, led some parents and conservatives to characterize him as a poor role model for children. Robert Bianco of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that \\"[Bart] outwits his parents and outtalks his teachers; in short, he's the child we wish we'd been, and fear our children will become.\\" In schools, educators claimed that Bart was a \\"threat to learning\\" because of his \\"underachiever and proud of it\\" attitude and negative attitude regarding his education. Others described him as \\"egotistical, aggressive and mean- spirited.\\" In response to the criticism, James L. Brooks said, \\"I'm very wary of television where everybody is supposed to be a role model, you don't run across that many role models in real life. Why should television be full of them?\\" In 1990 William Bennett, who at the time was drug czar of the United States, visited a drug treatment centre in Pittsburgh and upon noticing a poster of Bart remarked, \\"You guys aren't watching The Simpsons, are you? That's not going to help you any.\\" When a backlash over the comment ensued, Bennett apologized, claiming he \\"was just kidding\\" and saying \\"I'll sit down with the little spike head. We'll straighten this thing out.\\" In a 1991 interview, Bill Cosby described Bart as a bad role model for children, calling him \\"angry, confused, frustrated.\\" In response, Matt Groening said, \\"That sums up Bart, all right. Most people are in a struggle to be normal. He thinks normal is very boring, and does things that others just wished they dare do.\\" On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush said, \\"We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.\\" The writers rushed out a tongue-in-cheek reply in the form of a short segment which aired three days later before a rerun of \\"Stark Raving Dad\\" in which Bart replied, \\"Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression, too.\\" Although there were many critics of the character, favorable comments came from several quarters. Columnist Erma Bombeck wrote, \\"Kids need to know that somewhere in this world is a contemporary who can pull off all the things they can only fantasize about, someone who can stick it to their parents once in a while and still be permitted to live.\\" In 2003, Bart placed first in a poll of parents in the United Kingdom who were asked \\"which made-up character had the most influence\\" on children under 12 years old. =Commendations= In 2000, Bart, along with the rest of the Simpson family, were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1998, Time named Bart one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century. He was the only fictional character to make the list. He had previously appeared on the cover of the edition of December 31, 1990. He was also ranked No. 48 in TV Guides \\"50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time\\" in 1996 and both he and Lisa ranked No. 11 in TV Guide's \\"Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time\\" in 2002. At the 44th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1992, Cartwright won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for voicing Bart in the season three episode \\"Separate Vocations\\". She shared the award with five other voice actors from The Simpsons. Various episodes in which Bart is strongly featured have been nominated for Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program, including \\"Radio Bart\\" in 1992, \\"Future-Drama\\" in 2005, \\"The Haw-Hawed Couple\\" in 2006 and \\"Homer's Phobia\\", which won the award in 1997. In 1995, Cartwright won an Annie Award for \\"Voice Acting in the Field of Animation\\" for her portrayal of Bart in an episode. In 2000, Bart and the rest of the Simpson family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard. In 2014 Bart Simpson became the second mascot of Russian football club FC Zenit Saint Petersburg, wearing number 87 on his back (referring to The Simpsons debut in 1987; the club's first mascot is a blue- maned lion). =Merchandising= Alongside T-shirts, Bart has been included in various other The Simpsons-related merchandise, including air fresheners, baseball caps, bumper stickers, cardboard standups, refrigerator magnets, key rings, buttons, dolls, posters, figurines, clocks, soapstone carvings, Chia Pets, bowling balls and boxer shorts. The Bart Book, a book about Bart's personality and attributes, was released in 2004. Other books include Bart Simpson's Guide to Life. The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer, which is not an official publication, includes a chapter analyzing Bart's character and comparing him to the \\"Nietzschean ideal\\". Bart has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons. He has appeared in every one of The Simpsons video games, including Bart vs. the World, Bart Simpson's Escape from Camp Deadly, Bart vs. the Space Mutants, Bart's House of Weirdness, Bart vs. The Juggernauts, Bartman Meets Radioactive Man, Bart's Nightmare, Bart & the Beanstalk and The Simpsons Game, released in 2007. Alongside the television series, Bart regularly appears in issues of Simpsons Comics, which were first published on November 29, 1993 and are still issued monthly, and also has his own series called Bart Simpson Comics which have been released since 2000. Bart also plays a role in The Simpsons Ride, launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood. Bart appears as a playable character in the toys-to-life video game Lego Dimensions, released via a \\"Fun Pack\\" packaged with a Gravity Sprinter accessory in November 2015. Bart, and other The Simpsons characters, have appeared in numerous television commercials for Nestl√©'s Butterfinger candy bars from 1990 to 2001, with the slogan \\"Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger!\\" Lisa would occasionally advertise it too. Matt Groening would later say that the Butterfinger advertising campaign was a large part of the reason why Fox decided to pick up the half-hour show. The campaign was discontinued in 2001, much to the disappointment of Cartwright. Bart has also appeared in commercials for Burger King and Ramada Inn. In 2001, Kellogg's launched a brand of cereal called \\"Bart Simpson Peanut Butter Chocolate Crunch\\", which was available for a limited time. Before the half-hour series went on the air, Matt Groening pitched Bart as a spokesperson for Jell-O. He wanted Bart to sing \\"J-E-L-L-O\\", then burp the letter O. His belief was that kids would try to do it the next day, but he was rejected.Groening, Matt. (2001). Commentary for \\"There's No Disgrace Like Home\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. On April 9, 2009, the United States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44-cent stamps featuring Bart and the four other members of the Simpson family. They are the first characters, other than Sesame Street characters, to receive this accolade while the show is still in production. The stamps, designed by Matt Groening, were made available for purchase on May 7, 2009.

The ancient and original form did not include the words \\"a sinner\\", which were added later.On the Prayer of Jesus by Ignatius Brianchaninov, Kallistos Ware 2006 pages xxiii‚Äìxxiv It is often repeated continually as a part of personal ascetic practice, its use being an integral part of the eremitic tradition of prayer known as Hesychasm. The prayer is particularly esteemed by the spiritual fathers of this tradition (see Philokalia) as a method of cleaning and opening up the mind and after this the heart (kardia) and bringing about firstly the Prayer of the Mind or more correctly the Noetic Prayer (ŒùŒøŒµœÅŒ¨ Œ†œÅŒøœÉŒµœÖœáŒÆ) and after this the Prayer of the Heart (). The Prayer of the Heart is considered to be the Unceasing Prayer that the Apostle Paul advocates in the New Testament. Theophan the Recluse regarded the Jesus Prayer stronger than all other prayers by virtue of the power of the Holy Name of Jesus. Its tradition, on historical grounds, also belongs to the Eastern Catholics.See also: ¬ß Rosaries in other Christian traditions. But while there have been a number of Latin Catholic texts on the Jesus Prayer, its practice has never achieved the same popularity in Western Christianity as in Eastern Christianity, although it can be said on the Anglican rosary. As distinct from the prayer itself, the Eastern Orthodox theology of the Jesus Prayer enunciated in the 14th century by Gregory Palamas was generally rejected by Latin Catholic theologians until the 20th century, but Pope John Paul II called Gregory Palamas a saint, cited him as a great writer, and an authority on theology and spoke, without mentioning Palamas, with appreciation of the intent by the \\"Eastern theology\\" and its \\"spiritual method\\" \\"of prayer\\" called \\"hesychasm\\", \\"to emphasize the concrete possibility that man is given to unite himself with the Triune God in the intimacy of his heart, in that deep union of grace which Eastern theology likes to describe with the particularly powerful term of 'theosis', 'divinization'\\". In the Jesus Prayer can be seen the Eastern counterpart of the rosary, which has developed to hold a similar place in the Christian West. Origins The prayer's origin is most likely the Egyptian desert, which was settled by the monastic Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers in the 5th century.Antoine Guillaumont reports the finding of an inscription containing the Jesus Prayer in the ruins of a cell in the Egyptian desert dated roughly to the period being discussed ‚Äì Antoine Guillaumont, Une inscription copte sur la pri√®re de Jesus in Aux origines du monachisme chr√©tien, Pour une ph√©nom√©nologie du monachisme, pp. 168‚Äì83. In Spiritualit√© orientale et vie monastique, No 30. B√©grolles en Mauges (Maine & Loire), France: Abbaye de Bellefontaine. A formula similar to the standard form of the Jesus Prayer is found in a letter attributed to John Chrysostom, who died in AD 407\\\\. This \\"Letter to an Abbot\\" speaks of \\"Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy\\" and \\"Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on us\\" being used as ceaseless prayer.Epistula ad abbatem, p. 5 However, some consider this letter dubious or spurious and attribute it to an unknown writer of unknown date.Nikolopoulos, 1973 What may be the earliest explicit reference to the Jesus Prayer in a form that is similar to that used today is in Discourse on Abba Philimon from the Philokalia. Philimon lived around AD 600. The version cited by Philimon is, \\"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy upon me,\\" which is apparently the earliest source to cite this standard version. While the prayer itself was in use by that time, John S. Romanides writes that \\"We are still searching the Fathers for the term 'Jesus prayer'.\\" A similar idea is recommended in the Ladder of Divine Ascent of John Climacus (circa 523‚Äì606), who recommends the regular practice of a monologistos, or one-worded \\"Jesus Prayer\\". The use of the Jesus Prayer according to the tradition of the Philokalia is the subject of the 19th century anonymous Russian spiritual classic The Way of a Pilgrim, also in the original form, without the addition of the words \\"a sinner\\". Though the Jesus Prayer has been practiced through the centuries as part of the Eastern tradition, in the 20th century, it also began to be used in some Western churches, including some Latin Catholic and Anglican churches. Theology The hesychastic practice of the Jesus Prayer is founded on the biblical view by which God's name is conceived as the place of his presence. Vasile RƒÉducƒÉ, Ghidul cre≈ütinului ortodox de azi (Guide for the contemporary Eastern Orthodox Christian), second edition, Humanitas Ed., Bucharest, 2006, p. 81, . Orthodox mysticism has no images or representations. The mystical practice (the prayer and the meditation) doesn't lead to perceiving representations of God (see below Palamism). Thus, the most important means of a life consecrated to praying is the invoked name of God, as it is emphasized since the 5th century by the Thebaid anchorites, or by the later Athonite hesychasts. For the Orthodox the power of the Jesus Prayer comes not only from its content, but from the very invocation of Jesus name. Sergei Bulgakov, Ortodoxia (The Orthodoxy), translation from French, Paideia Ed., Bucharest, 1997, pp. 161, 162‚Äì163, . =Scriptural roots= The Jesus Prayer combines three Bible verses: the Christological hymn of the Pauline epistle Philippians (verse 11: \\"Jesus Christ is Lord\\"), the Annunciation of Luke (verse 35: \\"Son of God\\"), and the Parable of the Pharisee and the Publican of Luke , in which the Pharisee demonstrates the improper way to pray (verse 11: \\"God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican\\"), whereas the Publican prays correctly in humility (verse 13: \\"God be merciful to me a sinner\\"). =Palamism, the underlying theology= Icon of the Transfiguration of Jesus by Theophanes the Greek (15th century, Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow). Talking with Christ: Elijah (left) and Moses (right). Kneeling: Peter, James, and John The essence‚Äìenergies distinction, a central principle in Orthodox theology, was first formulated by Gregory of Nyssa and developed by Gregory Palamas in the 14th century in support of the mystical practices of Hesychasm and against Barlaam of Seminara. It stands that God's essence (, ousia) is distinct from God's energies, his manifestations in the world, by which men can experience the Divine. The energies are \\"unbegotten\\" or \\"uncreated\\". They were revealed in various episodes of the Bible: the burning bush seen by Moses, the Light on Mount Tabor at the Transfiguration. \\"Palamas [‚Ä¶] taught that the ascetic endeavor of fasting and prayer, particularly the practice of the Jesus Prayer according to the teachings of the hesychastic Fathers, prepares one to receive the grace-filled light of the Lord, which is like that which shone on Mt. Tabor at the Lord's Transfiguration. In other words, if God wills, according to one's striving, one can partake of divine blessedness while still on this sinful earth.\\" Original: ApophatismEastern Orthodox theology doesn't stand Thomas Aquinas' interpretation to the Mystycal theology of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (modo sublimiori and modo significandi, by which Aquinas unites positive and negative theologies, transforming the negative one into a correction of the positive one). Like pseudo-Denys, the Eastern Church remarks the antinomy between the two ways of talking about God and acknowledges the superiority of apophatism. Cf. Vladimir Lossky, op. cit., p. 55, Dumitru StƒÉniloae, op. cit., pp. 261‚Äì262. (negative theology) is the main characteristic of the Eastern theological tradition. Incognoscibility is not conceived as agnosticism or refusal to know God, because the Eastern theology is not concerned with abstract concepts; it is contemplative, with a discourse on things above rational understanding. Therefore, dogmas are often expressed antinomically. Vladimir Lossky, Teologia misticƒÉ a Bisericii de RƒÉsƒÉrit (The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church), translation from French, Anastasia Ed., Bucharest, 1993, pp. 36‚Äì37, 47‚Äì48, 55, 71. . This form of contemplation is experience of God, illumination, called the vision of God or, in Greek, theoria.The Vision of God by Vladimir Lossky SVS Press, 1997. () For the Eastern Orthodox the knowledge or of the uncreated energies is usually linked to apophatism. Fr. Dumitru StƒÉniloae, Ascetica ≈üi mistica Biserici Ortodoxe (Ascetics and Mystics of the Eastern Orthodox Church), Institutul Biblic ≈üi de Misiune al BOR (Romanian Orthodox Church Publishing House), 2002, p. 268, .The Philokalia, Vol. 4 Palmer, G.E.H; Sherrard, Philip; Ware, Kallistos (Timothy) On the Inner Nature of Things and on the Purification of the Intellect: One Hundred Texts Nikitas Stithatos (Nikitas Stethatos) =Repentance in Eastern Orthodoxy= The Eastern Orthodox Church holds a non-juridical view of sin, by contrast to the satisfaction view of atonement for sin as articulated in the West, firstly by Anselm of Canterbury (as debt of honor)) and Thomas Aquinas (as a moral debt). The terms used in the East are less legalistic (grace, punishment), and more medical (sickness, healing) with less exacting precision. Sin, therefore, does not carry with it the guilt for breaking a rule, but rather the impetus to become something more than what men usually are. One repents not because one is or isn't virtuous, but because human nature can change. Repentance (, metanoia, \\"changing one's mind\\") isn't remorse, justification, or punishment, but a continual enactment of one's freedom, deriving from renewed choice and leading to restoration (the return to man's original state).John Chryssavgis, Repentance and Confession - Introduction , Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. Retrieved 21 March 2008. This is reflected in the Mystery of Confession for which, not being limited to a mere confession of sins and presupposing recommendations or penalties, it is primarily that the priest acts in his capacity of spiritual father.An Online Orthodox Catechism, Russian Orthodox Church. Retrieved 21 March 2008. The Mystery of Confession is linked to the spiritual development of the individual, and relates to the practice of choosing an elder to trust as his or her spiritual guide, turning to him for advice on the personal spiritual development, confessing sins, and asking advice. As stated at the local Council of Constantinople in 1157, Christ brought his redemptive sacrifice not to the Father alone, but to the Trinity as a whole. In the Eastern Orthodox theology redemption isn't seen as ransom. It is the reconciliation of God with man, the manifestation of God's love for humanity. Thus, it is not the anger of God the Father but His love that lies behind the sacrificial death of his son on the cross. The redemption of man is not considered to have taken place only in the past, but continues to this day through theosis. The initiative belongs to God, but presupposes man's active acceptance (not an action only, but an attitude), which is a way of perpetually receiving God. =Distinctiveness from analogues in other religions= The practice of contemplative or meditative chanting is known in several religions including Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam (e.g. japa, zikr). The form of internal contemplation involving profound inner transformations affecting all the levels of the self is common to the traditions that posit the ontological value of personhood.Olga Louchakova, Ontopoiesis and Union in the Jesus Prayer: Contributions to Psychotherapy and Learning, in Logos of Phenomenology and Phenomenology of Logos. Book Four ‚Äì The Logos of Scientific Interrogation. Participating in Nature-Life-Sharing in Life, Springer Ed., 2006, p. 292, . Google Scholar: . The history of these practices, including their possible spread from one religion to another, is not well understood. Such parallels (like between unusual psycho-spiritual experiences, breathing practices, postures, spiritual guidances of elders, peril warnings) might easily have arisen independently of one another, and in any case must be considered within their particular religious frameworks. Although some aspects of the Jesus Prayer may resemble some aspects of other traditions, its Christian character is central rather than mere \\"local color\\". The aim of the Christian practicing it is not limited to attaining humility, love, or purification of sinful thoughts, but rather it is becoming holy and seeking union with God (theosis), which subsumes all the aforementioned virtues. Thus, for the Eastern Orthodox: Hristofor Panaghiotis, RugƒÉciunea lui Iisus. Unirea min≈£ii cu inima ≈üi a omului cu Dumnezeu (Jesus prayer. Uniting the mind with the heart and man with God by Panagiotis K. Christou), translation from Greek, second edition, Panaghia Ed., RarƒÉu Monastery, Vatra Dornei, pp. 6, 12‚Äì15, 130, . :* The Jesus Prayer is, first of all, a prayer addressed to God. It's not a means of self- deifying or self-deliverance, but a counterexample to Adam's pride, repairing the breach it produced between man and God. :* The aim is not to be dissolved or absorbed into nothingness or into God, or reach another state of mind, but to (re)unite with God (which by itself is a process) while remaining a distinct person. :* It is an invocation of Jesus' name, because Christian anthropology and soteriology are strongly linked to Christology in Orthodox monasticism. :* In a modern context the continuing repetition is regarded by some as a form of meditation, the prayer functioning as a kind of mantra. However, Orthodox users of the Jesus Prayer emphasize the invocation of the name of Jesus Christ that Hesychios describes in Pros Theodoulon which would be contemplation on the Triune God rather than simply emptying the mind. :* Acknowledging \\"a sinner\\" is to lead firstly to a state of humbleness and repentance, recognizing one's own sinfulness. :* Practicing the Jesus Prayer is strongly linked to mastering passions of both soul and body, e.g. by fasting. For the Eastern Orthodox not the body is wicked, but \\"the bodily way of thinking\\" is; therefore salvation also regards the body. :* Unlike \\"seed syllables\\" in particular traditions of chanting mantras, the Jesus Prayer may be translated into whatever language the pray-er customarily uses. The emphasis is on the meaning, not on the mere utterance of certain sounds. :* There is no emphasis on the psychosomatic techniques, which are merely seen as helpers for uniting the mind with the heart, not as prerequisites. A magistral way of meeting God for the Orthodox, Puterea Numelui sau despre RugƒÉciunea lui Iisus (The Power of the Name. The Jesus Prayer in Orthodox Spirituality) in Kallistos Ware, RugƒÉciune ≈üi tƒÉcere √Æn spiritualitatea ortodoxƒÉ (Prayer and silence in the Orthodox spirituality), translation from English, Christiana Ed., Bucharest, 2003, pp. 23, 26, . the Jesus Prayer does not harbor any secrets in itself, nor does its practice reveal any esoteric truths. Fr. Ioan de la RarƒÉu, RugƒÉciunea lui Iisus. √éntrebƒÉri ≈üi rƒÉspunsuri (Jesus Prayer. Questions and answers), Panaghia Ed., RarƒÉu Monastery, Vatra Dornei, p. 97. . Instead, as a hesychastic practice, it demands setting the mind apart from rational activities and ignoring the physical senses for the experiential knowledge of God. It stands along with the regular expected actions of the believer (prayer, almsgiving, repentance, fasting etc.) as the response of the Orthodox Tradition to Paul the Apostle's challenge to \\"pray without ceasing\\" (). It is also linked to the Song of Solomon's passage from the Old Testament: \\"I sleep, but my heart is awake\\" (Song of Solomon 5:2). The analogy being that as a lover is always conscious to his or her beloved, people can also achieve a state of \\"constant prayer\\" where they are always conscious of God's presence in their lives. Practice The practice of the Jesus Prayer is integrated into the mental ascesis undertaken by the Orthodox monastic in the practice of hesychasm. Yet the Jesus Prayer is not limited only to monastic life or to clergy. Anyone may practice this prayer, laypeople and clergy, men, women and children. Eastern Orthodox prayer rope Christ the Redeemer by Andrei Rublev (, Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow) In the Eastern tradition the prayer is said or prayed repeatedly, often with the aid of a prayer rope (; ), which is a cord, usually from wool or silk, tied with many knots. The prayer ropes usually have 33, 50, 100 or 300 knots ‚Äì or, more generally, an easily divisible number. The person saying the prayer says one repetition for each knot. It may be accompanied by prostrations and the sign of the cross, signaled by beads strung along the prayer rope at intervals. The prayer rope is \\"a tool of prayer\\" and an aid to beginners or those who face difficulties practicing the Prayer. However even the most advanced practitioners still use prayer ropes. The Jesus Prayer may be practiced under the guidance and supervision of a spiritual guide (pneumatikos, ), and or Starets, especially when psychosomatic techniques (like rhythmical breath) are incorporated. A person that acts as a spiritual \\"father\\" and advisor may be an official certified by the Church Confessor (Pneumatikos Exolmologitis) or sometimes a spiritually experienced monk (called in Greek Gerontas (Elder) or in Russian Starets). It is possible for that person to be a layperson, usually a \\"practical theologician\\" (i.e. a person well versed in Orthodox theology but without official credentials, certificates, diplomas etc.). =Techniques= There are no fixed rules for those who pray, \\"the way there is no mechanical, physical or mental technique which can force God to show his presence\\" (Metropolitan Kallistos Ware). In The Way of a Pilgrim, the pilgrim advises, \\"as you draw your breath in, say, or imagine yourself saying, 'Lord Jesus Christ,' and as you breathe again, 'have mercy on me.'\\" Another option is to say (orally or mentally) the whole prayer while breathing in and again the whole prayer while breathing out and yet another, to breathe in recite the whole prayer, breathe out while reciting the whole prayer again. One can also hold the breath for a few seconds between breathing in and out. Monks may pray this prayer many hundreds of times each night as part of their private cell vigil (\\"cell rule\\"). Under the guidance of an Elder (Russian Starets; Greek Gerondas), the monk aims to internalize the prayer, so that he is praying unceasingly. Diadochos of Photiki refers in On Spiritual Knowledge and Discrimination to the automatic repetition of the Jesus Prayer, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, even in sleep. This state is regarded as the accomplishment of Paul the Apostle's exhortation to the Thessalonians to \\"pray without ceasing\\" (). The Jesus Prayer can be used for a kind of \\"psychological\\" self-analysis. According to the Way of the Pilgrim account and Mount Athos practitioners of the Jesus Prayer, \\"one can have some insight on his or her current psychological situation by observing the intonation of the words of the prayer, as they are recited. Which word is stressed most. This self-analysis could reveal to the praying person things about their inner state and feelings, maybe not yet realised, of their unconsciousness.\\" \\"While praying the Jesus Prayer, one might notice that sometimes the word 'Lord' is pronounced louder, more stressed, than the others, like: Lord Jesus Christ, (Son of God), have mercy on me, (a/the sinner). In this case, they say, it means that our inner self is currently more aware of the fact that Jesus is the Lord, maybe because we need reassurance that he is in control of everything (and our lives too). Other times, the stressed word is 'Jesus': Lord Jesus Christ, (Son of God), have mercy on me, (a/the sinner). In that case, they say, we feel the need to personally appeal more to his human nature, the one that is more likely to understands our human problems and shortcomings, maybe because we are going through tough personal situations. Likewise if the word 'Christ' is stressed it could be that we need to appeal to Jesus as Messiah and Mediator, between humans and God the Father, and so on. When the word 'Son' is stressed maybe we recognise more Jesus' relationship with the Father. If 'of God' is stressed then we could realise more Jesus' unity with the Father. A stressed 'have mercy on me' shows a specific, or urgent, need for mercy. A stressed 'a sinner' (or 'the sinner') could mean that there is a particular current realisation of the sinful human nature or a particular need for forgiveness. \\"In order to do this kind of self-analysis one should better start reciting the prayer relaxed and naturally for a few minutes so the observation won't be consciously 'forced', and then to start paying attention to the intonation as described above. Also, a person might want to consciously stress one of the words of the prayer in particular when one wants to express a conscious feeling of situation. So in times of need stressing the 'have mercy' part can be more comforting or more appropriate. In times of failures, the 'a sinner' part, etc....).\\" =Levels of the prayer= Icon of The Ladder of Divine Ascent (the steps toward theosis as described by John Climacus) showing monks ascending (and falling from) the ladder to Jesus Paul Evdokimov, a 20th- century Russian philosopher and theologian, writes Paul Evdokimov, RugƒÉciunea √Æn Biserica de RƒÉsƒÉrit (Prayer in the Church of the East), translation from French, Polirom Ed., Bucharest, 1996, pp. 29‚Äì31, . about beginner's way of praying: initially, the prayer is excited because the man is emotive and a flow of psychic contents is expressed. In his view this condition comes, for the modern men, from the separation of the mind from the heart: \\"The prattle spreads the soul, while the silence is drawing it together.\\" Old fathers condemned elaborate phraseologies, for one word was enough for the publican, and one word saved the thief on the cross. They only uttered Jesus' name by which they were contemplating God. For Evdokimov the acting faith denies any formalism which quickly installs in the external prayer or in the life duties; he quotes Seraphim of Sarov: \\"The prayer is not thorough if the man is self- conscious and he is aware he's praying.\\" \\"Because the prayer is a living reality, a deeply personal encounter with the living God, it is not to be confined to any given classification or rigid analysis\\" an on-line catechism reads. As general guidelines for the practitioner, different number of levels (3, 7 or 9) in the practice of the prayer are distinguished by Orthodox fathers. They are to be seen as being purely informative, because the practice of the Prayer of the Heart is learned under personal spiritual guidance in Eastern Orthodoxy which emphasizes the perils of temptations when it's done by one's own. Thus, Theophan the Recluse, a 19th-century Russian spiritual writer, talks about three stages: # The oral prayer (the prayer of the lips) is a simple recitation, still external to the practitioner. # The focused prayer, when \\"the mind is focused upon the words\\" of the prayer, \\"speaking them as if they were our own.\\" # The prayer of the heart itself, when the prayer is no longer something we do but who we are. Once this is achieved the Jesus Prayer is said to become \\"self-active\\" (). It is repeated automatically and unconsciously by the mind, becoming an internal habit like a (beneficial) Earworm. Body, through the uttering of the prayer, mind, through the mental repetition of the prayer, are thus unified with \\"the heart\\" (spirit) and the prayer becomes constant, ceaselessly \\"playing\\" in the background of the mind, like a background music, without hindering the normal everyday activities of the person. More exactly, according with the experience of the ones which had reached at the level of unceasing prayer - for example the monks from Mount Athos but not only, this can be further divided in the Prayer of the Mind - level at which the prayer is said unceasingly in the rational parts (intellect - also called mind - and logic) of the soul and, if the practitioner advances further, then the grace will unite the rational parts with the irrational parts of the soul (inflammatory part and appetitive part) and then the prayer is called The Prayer of the Heart. Others, like Father Archimandrite Ilie Cleopa, one of the most representative spiritual fathers of contemporary Romanian Orthodox monastic spirituality, Ilie Cleopa in Dic≈£ionarul teologilor rom√¢ni (Dictionary of Romanian Theologians), electronic version, Univers Enciclopedic Ed., Bucharest, 1996. talk about nine levels (see External links). They are the same path to theosis, more slenderly differentiated: # The prayer of the lips. # The prayer of the mouth. # The prayer of the tongue. # The prayer of the voice. # The prayer of the mind. # The prayer of the heart. # The active prayer. # The all-seeing prayer. # The contemplative prayer. In its more advanced use, the monk aims to attain to a sober practice of the Jesus Prayer in the heart free of images. It is from this condition, called by John Climacus and Hesychios the \\"guard of the mind\\", that the monk is raised by the divine grace to contemplation. Variants of repetitive formulas A number of different repetitive prayer formulas have been attested in the history of Eastern Orthodox monasticism: the Prayer of St. Ioannikios the Great (754‚Äì846): \\"My hope is the Father, my refuge is the Son, my shelter is the Holy Ghost, O Holy Trinity, Glory unto You,\\" the repetitive use of which is described in his Life; or the more recent practice of Nikolaj Velimiroviƒá. Similarly to the flexibility of the practice of the Jesus Prayer, there is no imposed standardization of its form. The prayer can be from as short as \\"Lord, have mercy\\" (Kyrie eleison), \\"Have mercy on me\\" (\\"Have mercy upon us\\"), or even \\"Jesus\\", to its longer most common form. It can also contain a call to the Theotokos (Virgin Mary), or to the saints. The single essential and invariable element is Jesus' name. :* Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner. (a very common form) (Sometimes \\"\\" is translated \\"a sinner\\" but in Greek the article \\"\\" is a definite article, so it could be translated \\"the sinner\\".) :* Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me. (a very common form in the Greek tradition) :* Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me. (common variant on Mount Athos) :* Jesus, have mercy.\\"The Gurus, the Young Man, and Elder Paisios\\" by Dionysios Farasiotis :* Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us.http://www.saintjonah.org/services/stpachomius.htm :* Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, have mercy on me, a sinner.http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Prayer_Trinity.htm In art The Jesus Prayer is a core part of the plot in J. D. Salinger's pair of stories Franny and Zooey. Its use in that book is itself referenced in Jeffrey Eugenides's novel, The Marriage Plot. The prayer is also a central theme of the 2006 Russian film Ostrov. In 1999, Sir John Tavener wrote this haunting and somewhat discordant setting of ‚ÄòThe Jesus Prayer‚Äô for the popular Icelandic singer Bj√∂rk. His song is titled ‚ÄòPrayer of the Heart‚Äô which is an alternate name for ‚ÄòThe Jesus Prayer.‚Äô The music is played by the Brodsky Quartet. The Jesus Prayer repeats in Greek, in Coptic (the language of the desert fathers and mothers), and in English. Catholic Church Part four of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which is dedicated to Christian prayer, devotes paragraphs 2665 to 2669 to prayer to Jesus. In his poem The Book of the Twelve B√©guines, John of Ruysbroeck, a 14th-century Flemish mystic beatified by Pope Pius X in 1908, wrote of \\"the uncreated Light, which is not God, but is the intermediary between Him and the 'seeing thought'\\" as illuminating the contemplative not in the highest mode of contemplation, but in the second of the four ascending modes.John Francis's translation of Jan van Ruysbroeck, The Book of the Twelve B√©guines (John M. Watkins 1913), p. 40 Similar methods of prayer in use in the Catholic Church are recitation, as recommended by John Cassian, of \\"O God, come to my assistance; O Lord, make haste to help me\\" or other verses of Scripture; repetition of a single monosyllabic word, as suggested by the Cloud of Unknowing; the method used in Centering Prayer; the method used by The World Community for Christian Meditation, based on the Aramaic invocation Maranatha; the use of Lectio Divina; etc.Thomas Keating, Centering Prayer and the Christian Contemplative Tradition (Monastic Interreligious Dialogue, Bulletin 40, January 1991) The Catechism of the Catholic Church says: Use by other Christians In addition to Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox, many Christians of other traditions also use the Jesus Prayer, primarily as a centering prayer or for contemplative prayer. The prayer is sometimes used with the Anglican rosary. The structure and content of the Jesus Prayer also bears a resemblance to the \\"Sinner's Prayer\\" used by many evangelical Protestants.

Journal of Southern African Studies 42(5): 893‚Äì909 United States =Fad= During the 1960s, the United States was caught up in a \\"conglomerate fad\\" which turned out to be a form of speculative mania. Due to a combination of low interest rates and a repeating bear-bull market, conglomerates were able to buy smaller companies in leveraged buyouts (sometimes at temporarily deflated values). Famous examples from the 1960s include Ling-Temco-Vought,. ITT Corporation, Litton Industries, Textron, and Teledyne. The trick was to look for acquisition targets with solid earnings and much lower price‚Äìearnings ratios than the acquirer. The conglomerate would make a tender offer to the target's shareholders at a princely premium to the target's current stock price. Upon obtaining shareholder approval, the conglomerate usually settled the transaction in something other than cash, like debentures, bonds, warrants or convertible debentures (issuing the latter two would effectively dilute its own shareholders down the road, but many shareholders at the time were not thinking that far ahead). The conglomerate would then add the target's earnings to its own earnings, thereby increasing the conglomerate's overall earnings per share. In finance jargon, the transaction was \\"accretive to earnings.\\" The relatively lax accounting standards of the time meant that accountants were often able to get away with creative mathematics in calculating the conglomerate's post-acquisition consolidated earnings numbers. In turn, the price of the conglomerate's own stock would go up, thereby re-establishing its previous price-earnings ratio, and then it could repeat the whole process again with a new target. In plain English, conglomerates were using rapid acquisitions to create the illusion of rapid growth. In 1968, the peak year of the conglomerate fad, U.S. corporations completed a record number of mergers: approximately 4,500. In that year, at least 26 of the country's 500 largest corporations were acquired, of which 12 had assets in excess of $250 million. All this clever financial engineering had very real consequences for people who worked for companies that were either acquired by conglomerates or were seen as likely to be acquired by them. Acquisitions were a disorienting and demoralizing experience for executives at acquired companies‚Äîthose who were not immediately laid off found themselves at the mercy of the conglomerate's executives in some other distant city. Most conglomerates' headquarters were located on the West Coast or East Coast, while many of their acquisitions were located in the country's interior. Many interior cities were devastated by repeatedly losing headquarters of corporations to mergers, in which independent ventures were reduced to subsidiaries of conglomerates based in New York or Los Angeles. Pittsburgh, for example, lost about a dozen. The terror instilled by the mere prospect of such harsh consequences for executives and their home cities meant that fending off takeovers, real or imagined, was a constant distraction for executives at all corporations seen as choice acquisition targets during this era. The chain reaction of rapid-growth-through-acquisitions could not last forever. When interest rates rose to offset rising inflation, conglomerate profits began to fall. The beginning of the end came in January 1968, when Litton shocked Wall Street by announcing a quarterly profit of only 21 cents per share, versus 63 cents for the previous year's quarter. It would take two more years before it was clear that the conglomerate fad was on its way out. The stock market eventually figured out that the conglomerates' bloated and inefficient businesses were as cyclical as any others‚Äîindeed, it was that cyclical nature that had caused such businesses to be such undervalued acquisition targets in the first place‚Äîand their descent \\"put[] the lie to the claim that diversification allowed them to ride out a downturn.\\" A major selloff of conglomerate shares ensued. To keep going, many conglomerates were forced to shed the new businesses they had recently purchased, and by the mid-1970s most conglomerates had been reduced to shells. The conglomerate fad was subsequently replaced by newer ideas like focusing on a company's core competency. =Genuine diversification= In other cases, conglomerates are formed for genuine interests of diversification rather than manipulation of paper return on investment. Companies with this orientation would only make acquisitions or start new branches in other sectors when they believed this would increase profitability or stability by sharing risks. Flush with cash during the 1980s, General Electric also moved into financing and financial services, which in 2005 accounted for about 45% of the company's net earnings. GE formerly owned a minority interest in NBCUniversal, which owns the NBC television network and several other cable networks. In some ways GE is the opposite of the \\"typical\\" 1960s conglomerate in that the company was not highly leveraged, and when interest rates rose GE was able to turn this to its advantage. It was often less expensive to lease from GE than buy new equipment using loans. United Technologies was also a successful conglomerate until they were dismantled in the late 2010s. =Mutual funds= With the spread of mutual funds (especially index funds since 1976), investors could more easily obtain diversification by owning a small slice of many companies in a fund rather than owning shares in a conglomerate. Another example of a successful conglomerate is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company which used surplus capital from its insurance subsidiaries to invest in businesses across a variety of industries. International The end of the First World War caused a brief economic crisis in Weimar Germany, permitting entrepreneurs to buy businesses at rock-bottom prices. The most successful, Hugo Stinnes, established the most powerful private economic conglomerate in 1920s Europe ‚Äì Stinnes Enterprises ‚Äì which embraced sectors as diverse as manufacturing, mining, shipbuilding, hotels, newspapers, and other enterprises. The best known British conglomerate was Hanson plc. It followed a rather different timescale than the U.S. examples mentioned above, as it was founded in 1964 and ceased to be a conglomerate when it split itself into four separate listed companies between 1995 and 1997. In Hong Kong, some of the well-known conglomerates include Jardine Matheson (AD1824), Swire Group (AD1816), (British companies, one Scottish one English; companies that have a history of over 150 years and have business interests that span across four continents with a focus in Asia.) C K Hutchison Whampoa (now CK Hutchison Holdings), Sino Group, (both Asian-owned companies specialize business such as real estate and hospitality with a focus in Asia.) * Swire Group (AD1816) (or Swire Pacific) Started by Liverpool natives the Swire family, which controls a wide range of businesses, including property (Swire Properties), aviation (i.e. Cathay Pacific and Dragonair), beverages (bottler of Coca-Cola), shipping and trading. * Jardine Matheson (AD1824) operates businesses in the fields of property (Hongkong Land), finance (Jardine Lloyd Thompson), trading, retail (Dairy Farm) and hotels (i.e. Mandarin Oriental). *CK Hutchison Holdings Limited: Telecoms, Infrastructure, Ports, Health and Beauty Retail. Energy, Finance * Sino Group: Kerry Logistics, Universal Studios Singapore, Shangri-La In Japan, a different model of conglomerate, the keiretsu, evolved. Whereas the Western model of conglomerate consists of a single corporation with multiple subsidiaries controlled by that corporation, the companies in a keiretsu are linked by interlocking shareholdings and a central role of a bank. Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo are some of Japan's best known keiretsu, reaching from automobile manufacturing to the production of electronics such as televisions. While not a keiretsu, Sony is an example of a modern Japanese conglomerate with operations in consumer electronics, video games, the music industry, television and film production and distribution, financial services, and telecommunications. In China, many of the country's conglomerates are state-owned enterprises, but there is a substantial number of private conglomerates. Notable conglomerates include BYD, CIMC, China Merchants Bank, Huawei, JXD, Meizu, Ping An Insurance, TCL, Tencent, TP-Link, ZTE, Legend Holdings, Dalian Wanda Group, China Poly Group, Beijing Enterprises, and Fosun International. Fosun is currently China's largest civilian-run conglomerate by revenue. In South Korea, the chaebol are a type of conglomerate owned and operated by a family. A chaebol is also inheritable, as most of current presidents of chaebols succeeded their fathers or grandfathers. Some of the largest and most well-known Korean chaebols are Samsung, LG, Hyundai Kia and SK. The era of Licence Raj (1947‚Äì1990) in India created some of Asia's largest conglomerates, such as the Tata Group, Kirloskar Group, Larsen & Toubro, Mahindra Group, Sahara India, ITC Limited, Essar Group, Reliance ADA Group, Reliance Industries, Aditya Birla Group and the Bharti Enterprises. In Brazil the most important conglomerates are J&F; Investimentos, Odebrecht, Ita√∫sa, Camargo Corr√™a, Votorantim Group, Andrade Gutierrez, and Queiroz Galv√£o. In New Zealand, Fletcher Challenge was formed in 1981 from the merger of Fletcher Holdings, Challenge Corporation, and Tasman Pulp & Paper, in an attempt to create a New Zealand-based multi-national company. At the time, the newly merged company dealt in construction, building supplies, pulp and paper mills, forestry, and oil & gas. Following a series of bungled investments, the company demerged in the early 2000s to concentrate on building and construction. In the Philippines, the largest conglomerate of the country is the Ayala Corporation which focuses on malls, bank, real estate development, and telecommunications. The other big conglomerates in the Philippines included JG Summit Holdings, Lopez Group of Companies, SM Investments Corporation, Metro Pacific Investments Corporation and San Miguel Corporation. In United States, some of the examples are The Walt Disney Company, WarnerMedia and The Trump Organization (see below). In Canada, one of the examples is Hudson's Bay Company. Advantages and disadvantages of conglomerates =Advantages= *Diversification results in a reduction of investment risk. A downturn suffered by one subsidiary, for instance, can be counterbalanced by stability, or even expansion, in another division. For example, if Berkshire Hathaway's construction materials business has a good year, the profit might be offset by a bad year in its insurance business. This advantage is enhanced by the fact that the business cycle affects industries in different ways. Financial Conglomerates have very different compliance requirements from insurance or reinsurance solo entities or groups. There are very important opportunities that can be exploited, to increase shareholder value. *A conglomerate creates an internal capital market if the external one is not developed enough. Through the internal market, different parts of conglomerate allocate capital more effectively. *A conglomerate can show earnings growth, by acquiring companies whose shares are more discounted than its own. In fact, Teledyne, GE, and Berkshire Hathaway have delivered high earnings growth for a time. =Disadvantages= * The extra layers of management increase costs. * Accounting disclosure is less useful information, many numbers are disclosed grouped, rather than separately for each business. The complexity of a conglomerate's accounts make them harder for managers, investors and regulators to analyze, and makes it easier for management to hide issues. * Conglomerates can trade at a discount to the overall individual value of their businesses because investors can achieve diversification on their own simply by purchasing multiple stocks. The whole is often worth less than the sum of its parts. * Culture clashes can destroy value. * Inertia prevents development of innovation. * Lack of focus, and inability to manage unrelated businesses equally well. * Brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment, product area, or quality, price or cachet. * Conglomerates more easily run the risk of being too big to fail. Some cite the decreased cost of conglomerate stock (a phenomenon known as conglomerate discount) as evidential of these disadvantages, while other traders believe this tendency to be a market inefficiency, which undervalues the true strength of these stocks. Media conglomerates In her 1999 book No Logo, Naomi Klein provides several examples of mergers and acquisitions between media companies designed to create conglomerates for the purposes of creating synergy between them: *Time Warner included several tenuously linked businesses during the 1990s and 2000s, including Internet access, content, film, cable systems and television. Their diverse portfolio of assets allowed for cross-promotion and economies of scale. However, the company has sold or spun off many of these businesses ‚Äì including Warner Music Group, Warner Books, AOL, Time Warner Cable, and Time Inc. ‚Äì since 2004. *Clear Channel Communications, a public company, at one point owned a variety of TV and radio stations and billboard operations, together with many concert venues across the U.S. and a diverse portfolio of assets in the UK and other countries around the world. The concentration of bargaining power in this one entity allowed it to gain better deals for all of its business units. For example, the promise of playlisting (allegedly, sometimes, coupled with the threat of blacklisting) on its radio stations was used to secure better deals from artists performing in events organized by the entertainment division. These policies have been attacked as unfair and even monopolistic, but are a clear advantage of the conglomerate strategy. On December 21, 2005, Clear Channel completed the divestiture of Live Nation, and in 2007 the company divested their television stations to other firms, some which Clear Channel holds a small interest in. Live Nation owns the events and concert venues previously owned by Clear Channel Communications. * Impact of conglomerates on the media: The four major media conglomerates in the United States are The Walt Disney Company, Comcast, WarnerMedia and ViacomCBS The Walt Disney Company is linked with the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), creating the largest media corporation, with revenue equal to roughly thirty six billion dollars. Since Walt Disney owns ABC, it controls its news and programming. Walt Disney also acquired most of Fox, for over $70 billion. When General Electric owned NBC, it did not allow negative reporting against General Electric on air (NBCUniversal is now owned by Comcast). Viacom's chief executive, Sumner Redstone, considers himself a ‚Äúliberal democrat‚Äù and most of Viacom's programming has a liberal perspective. Viacom merged with CBS in 2019 as ViacomCBS after originally merged in 1999 with Viacom as the surviving company while also Viacom divested CBS in 2005 due to FCC regulations as the time. * Media conglomerate impact on journalism: It leads to opinionated journalism versus traditional journalism. Opinionated journalism is a journalist adding his or her ideologies on a matter on top of reporting it to the public. The coverage that conglomerates have of issues, especially political, is not necessarily objective, and fails to report both sides of an issue, if not taking a neutral stance. This is known as media bias. Media bias is ‚Äùthe intentional or unintentional slanting of news reporting toward one side due political views or cultural beliefs of journalists, producers or owners of a media outlet.‚Äù =Internet conglomerates= A relatively new development, Internet conglomerates, such as Alphabet, Google's parent company belong to the modern media conglomerate group and play a major role within various industries, such as brand management. In most cases Internet conglomerates consist of corporations who own several medium-sized online or hybrid online- offline projects. In many cases, newly joined corporations get higher returns on investment, access to business contacts, and better rates on loans from various banks. Food conglomerates Similar to other industries there are many companies that can be termed as conglomerates. * The Phillip Morris group, which once was the parent company of Altria group, Phillip Morris International, and Kraft Foods had an annual combined turnover of $80 bn. *Nestl√© See also Notes Bibliography * * McDonald, Paul and Wasko, Janet (2010), The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry, Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Biography Bachmann was born in Klagenfurt, in the Austrian state of Carinthia, the daughter of Olga (n√©e Haas) and Matthias Bachmann, a schoolteacher. Her father was an early member of the Austrian National Socialist Party. She had a sister, Isolde, and a brother, Heinz. She studied philosophy, psychology, German philology, and law at the universities of Innsbruck, Graz, and Vienna. In 1949, she received her Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Vienna with her dissertation titled \\"The Critical Reception of the Existential Philosophy of Martin Heidegger\\"; her thesis adviser was Victor Kraft. After graduating, Bachmann worked as a scriptwriter and editor at the Allied radio station Rot-Weiss-Rot, a job that enabled her to obtain an overview of contemporary literature and also supplied her with a decent income, making possible proper literary work. Furthermore, her first radio dramas were published by the station. Her literary career was enhanced by contact with Hans Weigel (litt√©rateur and sponsor of young post-war literature) and the literary circle known as Gruppe 47, whose members also included Ilse Aichinger, Paul Celan, Heinrich B√∂ll, Marcel Reich-Ranicki and G√ºnter Grass. She won the Prize of Group 47 in 1953 for her poetry collection Die gestundete Zeit. Ingeborg Bachmann's residence at Palazzo Sacchetti, Via Giulia, Rome In 1953, she moved to Rome, Italy, where she spent the large part of the following years working on poems, essays and short stories as well as opera libretti in collaboration with Hans Werner Henze, which soon brought with them international fame and numerous awards. From 1958 to 1963, she lived on and off with Max Frisch. Her 1971 novel, Malina, has been described as a response, at least partially, to his 1964 novel Mein Name sei Gantenbein. During her later years she suffered from alcoholism and drug abuse. A friend described it: > \\"I was deeply shocked by the magnitude of her tablet addiction. It must have > been 100 per day, the bin was full of empty boxes. She looked bad, she was > waxlike and pale. And her whole body was covered in bruises. I wondered what > could have caused them. Then, when I saw how she slipped her Gauloise that > she smoked and let it burn off on her arm, I realized: burns caused by > falling cigarettes. The numerous tablets had made her body insensible to > pain.\\"Peter Beicken: Ingeborg Bachmann. Becksche Reihe 605, 2. Auflage. > M√ºnchen 1992, S. 213. On the night of 25 September 1973, her nightgown caught on fire and she was taken to the Sant'Eugenio Hospital at 7:05 A.M. the following morning for treatment of second and third degree burns. Local police concluded that the fire was caused by a cigarette. During her stay, she experienced withdrawal symptoms from barbiturate substance abuse, though the doctors treating her were not aware of the cause. This may have contributed to her subsequent death on 17 October 1973. She is buried at the Annabichl cemetery in Klagenfurt.  Writings  Bachmann's doctoral dissertation expresses her growing disillusionment with Heideggerian existentialism, which was in part resolved through her growing interest in Ludwig Wittgenstein, whose Tractatus Logico- Philosophicus significantly influenced her relationship to language. During her lifetime, Bachmann was known mostly for her two collections of poetry, Die gestundete Zeit and Anrufung des Grossen B√§ren. Bachmann's literary work focuses on themes like personal boundaries, establishment of the truth, and philosophy of language, the latter in the tradition of Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. Many of her prose works represent the struggles of women to survive and to find a voice in post-war society. She also addresses the histories of imperialism and fascism, in particular, the persistence of imperialist ideas in the present. Fascism was a recurring theme in her writings. In her novel Der Fall Franza (The Case of Franza) Bachmann argued that fascism had not died in 1945 but had survived in the German speaking world of the 1960s in human relations and particularly in men's oppression of women. In Germany the achievements of the women's rights campaign at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century had been systematically undone by the fascist Nazi regime in the 1930s. Bachmann's engagement with fascism followed that of other women writers who in the immediate post-war period dealt with fascism from a woman's perspective, such as Anna Seghers, Ilse Aichinger, Ingeborg Drewitz and Christa Wolf. Bachmann was also in the vanguard of Austrian women writers who discovered in their private lives the political realities from which they attempted to achieve emancipation. Bachmann's writings and those of Barbara Frischmuth, Brigitte Schwaiger and Anna Mitgutsch were widely published in Germany. Male Austrian authors such as Franz Innerhofer, Josef Winkler and Peter Turrini wrote equally popular works on traumatic experiences of socialisation. Often these authors produced their works for major German publishing houses. After Bachmann's death in 1973 Austrian writers such as Thomas Bernhard, Peter Handke and Elfriede Jelinek continued the tradition of Austrian literature in Germany.  Lectures  Between November 1959 and February 1960 Bachmann gave five lectures on poetics at the Goethe University Frankfurt. Known as the Frankfurter Vorlesungen: Probleme zeitgen√∂ssischer Dichtung (Frankfurt Lectures: Problems of Contemporary Writings) they are historically and substantively Bachmann's central work. In it she explained recurring themes in her early literary publications and she discussed the function of literature in society. Bachmann insisted that literature had to be viewed in its historic context, thus foreshadowing a rising interest in studying the connection between literary discourse and the contemporary understanding of history. In the first lecture on Fragen und Scheinfragen (Questions and Pseudo Questions) Bachmann focused on the role of writers in the post-war society and lists essential questions that are \\"destructive and frightening in their simplicity\\". They are: why write? What do we mean by change and why do we want it through art? What are the limitations of the writer who wants to bring about change? Bachmann asserted that the great literary accomplishments of the 20th century were expressions in language and thus the poetic moral and intellectual renewal. In her mind the writer's new thinking and experience formed the core of the literary works. This in turn lets a writer come closer to a new language. She stressed that a new language was inhabited by a new spirit. Thus a writer may despair over the importance of language and she cited Hugo von Hofmannsthal's Ein Brief (1902) as the first articulation of this problem. The second lecture √úber Gedichte (On Poems) distinguishes poetry with its new power to grasp reality in its language, from other genres such as novels and plays. With reference to G√ºnter Eich and Stefan George she identified a new generation of poet-prophets whose mission it was to lead the world to the discovery of an \\"ever purer heaven of art\\". She set these poets apart from the surrealists who aspired to violence and the futurists who claimed that \\"war is beautiful\\". She argued that these two movements exemplified art-for-art's sake and that the careers of Gottfried Benn and Ezra Pound exemplified the friendship between pure aestheticism with political barbarism. She referenced Kafka on the need to \\"take the axe to the frozen sea in us\\" and the refusal to remain silent about the crimes in our world. In the lecture she also named writings of Nelly Sachs, Marie Luise Kaschnitz, Hans Magnus Enzensberger and Paul Celan as examples of new poetry. In the third lecture on Das schreibende Ich (The Writing \\"I\\") Bachmann addressed the question of the first-person narrator. She was concerned with the accountability and authority, the authenticity and reliability of a person of narrating a work. She distinguished between the unproblematic \\"I\\" in letters and diaries which conceal the person from the author, and the unproblematic \\"I\\" in memoirs. She argued that Henry Miller and Louis-Ferdinand C√©line placed themselves and their own personal experience directly at the centre of their novels. She referenced Tolstoy's The Kreuzer Sonata and Dostoyevsky's The House of the Dead as first-person narrators of the inner story. She argued that narrators could provide a new treatment of time (for example Italo Svevo), of material (for example Proust) or of space (for example Hans Henny Jahnn). Bachmann asserted that in the modern novel the \\"I\\" had shifted and the narrator no longer lives the story, instead the story is in the narrator. In the fourth lecture Der Umgang mit Namen (The Close association with Names) Bachmann explored how names could have a life of their own. She discussed the use of names in contemporary literature. She identified \\"denied names\\" such as in Kafka's The Castle, \\"ironic naming\\" by Thomas Mann, \\"name games\\" in James Joyce's Ulysses and instances where the identity of the character is not secured by a name but by the context, such as in Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury. In the fifth lecture on Literatur als Utopie (Literature as Utopia) she turned to the question of what makes literature utopian. She argued that it was the process that was set in motion in the writer and reader as a result of their interaction with literature that made a work utopian. She argued that literature could make us aware of the lack, both in the work and in our own world. Readers could remove this lack by giving the work a chance in our time. Thus she argued each work of literature is \\"a realm which reaches forward and has unknown limits\\". Bachmann's understanding of utopia as direction rather than a goal, and her argument that it was the function of literature to take an utopian direction stemmed from Robert Musil who had analysed European modernism in his dissertation on Ernst Mach.  Legacy  Although German language writers such as Hilde Domin, Luise Rinser and Nelly Sachs had published notable works on women's issues in the post-war period it was only in the 1970s that a feminist movement emerged in West Germany. After her death, Bachmann became popular among feminist readers. Feminist scholars' engagement with her work after her death led to a wave of scholarship that also drew attention to her prose work. Her works gained popularity within the emerging Frauenliteratur (women's literature) movement which struggled to find the authentic female voice. New publishing houses carried the movement, such as the feminist press Frauenoffensive (Women's Offensive), which published writings by Verena Stefan.

There are both MS-DOS and Windows versions, and two kinds of the latter: Console and Windows. The MS-DOS version has a syntax similar to that of QBasic and QuickBASIC. The Windows versions use a BASIC syntax expanded to include many Windows functions, and the statements can be combined with calls to the Windows API. History The first version of the DOS compiler was published as BASIC/Z, the very first interactive compiler for CP/M and MDOS. Later it was extended to MS-DOS/PC DOS and in 1987 Borland distributed it as Turbo Basic. Turbo Basic was originally created by Robert \\"Bob\\" Zale (1945‚Äì2012) and bought from him by Borland. When Borland decided to stop publishing it (1989), Zale bought it back from them, renamed it PowerBASIC and set up PowerBASIC Inc. to continue support and development of it; it was later called PBDOS. PowerBASIC went on to develop BASIC compilers for Windows, first PBWIN ‚Äî their flagship product ‚Äî and then PBCC, described below. On November 6, 2012, Robert Zale, the creator of PowerBASIC, died. For a time, it was assumed that the company might cease operations. His wife, Mrs. Vivian Zale, posted on 8 March 2014 to the PowerBASIC forums a statement that the company would continue in operation. On May 10, 2015, Mrs. Zale announced that work was continuing on new versions of PowerBASIC compilers. On November 2, 2016, Vivian Zale announced her intention to begin seeking a buyer for the company. Active development of PowerBASIC products has stopped. They no longer expect to release PBWin11 and PBCC7, which were in beta testing when Bob Zale died, nor the 64-bit compilers or PB/Pro (PBWin and CC in one compiler), which were still in the alpha stages. On January 31, 2017, Adam Drake announced Drake Software had acquired the PowerBASIC source code from PowerBasic, Inc., with the intention of updating and improving the functionality of the product. This was later confirmed by Vivian Zale with a forum post thanking the members for their support. Compilers PowerBASIC programs are self-contained and use no runtime file to execute. In all versions of the compiler the applications compile without external libraries, though you can use such libraries if desired. PBDOS creates 16-bit DOS MZ executable files, while PBWIN and PBCC create 32-bit Portable Executable (PE) files. =Turbo Basic= Borland's Turbo Basic contains extensions to classical BASIC (while not breaking compatibility). One of those was a drawing API, and mouse access. Unlike most BASIC implementations of its time, Turbo Basic was a full compiler which generated native code for MS-DOS. Other implementations were either interpreters, or relied heavily on a runtime library. The integrated development environment could run a BASIC program internally for traditional BASIC debugging (see sample below), or generate an MS-DOS stand-alone executable file that could be run on other systems without the Turbo Basic product or runtime libraries. Code example The following program is an example of the ALGOL-like BASIC dialect that Turbo Basic supported. Unlike traditional BASIC, which used line numbers and had limited control structures and no support for ALGOL-like subroutines, modern BASIC dialects starting at this period were extended to make the language compatible with modern structured programming theory by discarding the line numbers and adding the control structures and subroutine definitions needed by structured programming. INPUT \\"What is your name?: \\", n$ PRINT \\"Hello \\"; n$ DO s$ = \\"\\" INPUT \\"How many stars do you want to print\\"; s FOR i = 1 TO s s$ = s$ + \\"*\\" NEXT i PRINT s$ DO INPUT \\"Do you want to print more stars\\"; q$ LOOP WHILE LEN(q$) = 0 q$ = LCASE$(LEFT$(q$, 1)) LOOP WHILE q$ = \\"y\\" PRINT \\"Goodbye \\"; n$ (\`s$\` is a string and \`s\` is a single-precision floating-point (number). They are separate variables.) Like the other Borland products of this era, the code executes within the integrated development environment. =PowerBASIC for DOS (PBDos)= PBDOS includes an integrated development environment (IDE) and supports DOS 3.30 and all later versions.PowerBASIC 3.5 for DOS =PowerBASIC Console Compiler (PBCC)= PBCC is a 32-bit compiler for the Windows 9x series and Windows NT series of operating systems, including Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, and Windows 7. PBCC applications can use dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). The compiler comes with an IDE including an editor and stepping debugger. No knowledge of Windows programming is required to create character mode or graphical applications with this compiler. Common Gateway Interface executables can also be compiled using PBCC. PBCC creates only executables, not DLLs. (PBWin ‚Äî see below ‚Äî can create both.) =PowerBASIC Compiler for Windows (PBWin)= PBWin is a 32-bit compiler compatible with the Windows 9x series and the Windows NT series of operating systems, including Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 (8.1), and Windows 10.PowerBASIC Compiler for Windows PBWin can create dynamic-link libraries. PBWin applications can read dynamic-link libraries]. PBWin comes with a compiler, IDE with editor, and stepping debugger. Dynamic Dialog Tools (DDT) You can create an application's graphical user interface using the Windows API, or by using the inbuilt DDT language extensions. The group of BASIC statements which wrap Windows API functions, particularly in the creation and handling of dialog boxes and child controls is collectively known as Dynamic Dialog Tools. Using DDT requires less coding than to create a similar program using the Windows API. Using the DDT and the Windows API (known as SDK style as in Microsoft Windows SDK) are not mutually exclusive. Trial Versions of Compilers PowerBASIC renamed PBWin v9.07 and PB/CC v5.07 as \\"Classic PBWin\\" and \\"Classic PB/CC\\", respectively, and on November 1, 2016, released them as free, no-nag, trial versions along with PBForms v1.0 (PowerBASIC Forms). Tools =PB Forms= PowerBASIC Forms, available for purchase separately, is a graphical user interface design tool add-on for PBWin. It automatically produces source code using the DDT language extension that creates forms using the Windows graphical user interface. =COM Browser= The PowerBASIC COM Browser, which comes with PBWin, is an application that exposes the interfaces, methods, and properties of COM objects, as described by type-library files. The PowerBASIC COM Browser exports an interface structure of a COM object for early-binding purposes in PowerBASIC code, and gives syntax reference and context-help on the interface members exposed by a COM object. Programming language =Characteristics= PowerBASIC is a native-code BASIC compiler whose reported merits are simplicity of use and speed compared to other languages.New geometries for new materials, Eric A. Lord, Alan Lindsay Mackay, Srinivasa Ranganathan, Cambridge University Press, 2006, (\\"a very simple user interface ... speed and power of the underlying C++ ... runs extremely fast\\") Google BooksChaos and Time-series Analysis, Julien C. Sprott, Oxford University Press, 2003, (\\"easy to learn, powerful, and as fast as any C compiler I have encountered\\") Google Books Although the compiled code is fast enough for most purposes, the compilers also support inline assembler for additional code optimizing. The Windows compilers (PBWin & PBCC) support almost all of the x86 instruction set, including FPU, SIMD, and MMX, the main exceptions being a few which are useful mostly to systems programmers. One can still use the unsupported instructions by inserting their opcodes with the \\"db\\", \\"dw\\", and \\"dd\\" statements. Lines of assembler code can be freely interspersed with lines of BASIC code, although one must always consider the potential interactions between the two types of code. =Hello world= Hello world is used to give a very small example of the syntax used by a programming language and is often the smallest possible program for any given programming language. Here is an example of a PBCC hello world program. By default PBCC creates a console window at runtime for displaying output. The only purpose of Waitkey$ in this example is to keep the console up so you can read the output. Function PBMain Print \\"Hello, World!\\" Waitkey$ End Function Here is the PBWin version, which displays a Windows \\"dialog\\" message box. Function PBMain MsgBox \\"Hello, World!\\" End Function =Object-oriented programming= PBWin and PBCC support object-oriented programming in the form of COM classes, however the compilers do not force you to use OOP, it is merely an option. In- process and out-of-process COM Servers can also be built using these compilers. Graphics Both the Console Compiler and Windows Compiler can create graphic windows. The GRAPHICs statements are higher-level than Windows' Graphics Device Interface (GDI) library functions.https://www.powerbasic.com/support/help/pbwin/index.htmhttps://www.powerbasic.com/support/help/pbcc/index.htm =Elements of the GRAPHIC statements= GRAPHIC WINDOWS are dedicated dialogs each containing a single control which fills the dialog's client area. GRAPHIC controls are child windows which support the same GRAPHIC drawing functionality as GRAPHIC windows. GRAPHIC BITMAPS are also defined, again supporting the GRAPHIC drawing functionality, but as purely memory objects, like Windows Bitmaps or DIB Sections. Keyboard and mouse handling statements are included among the GRAPHIC statements. Character output to a GRAPHIC target uses fonts specified via the FONT NEW statement. =Creating a GRAPHIC WINDOW application= A GRAPHIC WINDOW is the equivalent of a Windows dialog box containing a static control on which drawing operations can be done. A single BASIC statement will create a GRAPHIC WINDOW and specify its size, position and title. It is not essential to specify a WNDPROC for the GRAPHIC WINDOW. A short source code example for a complete GRAPHIC WINDOW application follows: #Compile Exe ' using either PBCC6 or PBWIN10 compiler #Dim All Function PBMain Local GW As Dword ' start a GRAPHIC WINDOW Graphic Window New \\"graphic window\\", 100, 100, 200, 200 to GW ' show a coloured disc Graphic Ellipse (10, 10)-(190, 190), %rgb_Red, %rgb_SeaGreen, 0 ' wait for a keypress Graphic Waitkey$ End Function =Comparison of PB GRAPHIC statements with the GDI API= Using PB GRAPHIC statements, a GRAPHIC (WINDOW, BITMAP, or control) is first selected as the current GRAPHIC target, then operations are done on it without requiring it to be identified again. Contrast this with the GDI API approach, where the Device Context handle is required for every drawing operation. It is not necessary when using the PB GRAPHIC statements to define a brush or pen as a separate entity, nor is it necessary to redraw the GRAPHIC target (when in view) in response to Windows messages such as WM_PAINT and WM_ERASEBKGND. GRAPHIC targets are persistent. When GRAPHIC targets are attached, a REDRAW option can be specified which buffers the results of drawing operations until they are specifically requested. Using this technique reduces flicker in a similar way to the technique of drawing on memory DCs Petzold, Charles (1998). Programming Windows Fifth Edition, Microsoft Press, when using the GDI API. Pixel operations are possible using the GRAPHIC GETSET PIXEL statements, in a manner similar to GetPixel/SetPixel of the GDI API. GRAPHIC GET BITS allows the entire bitmap to be loaded into a dynamic string. This can be manipulated either as a string or by mapping an array onto it. It can be placed back into the GRAPHIC target by GRAPHIC SET BITS. =Complementarity of GRAPHIC statements and the Windows GDI API= The GRAPHIC statements contain all the commonly used GDI API functions, but if you need one that is not included it is possible to obtain the hDC of any GRAPHIC target and thereby use GDI API functions on it. User community PowerBASIC provides an online forum for users to ask questions and share knowledge.https://www.powerbasic.com/support/pbforums/faq.php?faq=vb3_board_faq#faq_faq_forum_rules On 8 July 2012 the forum had 5,623 members (only a fraction of them still active) and contained 50,093 threads comprising 408,642 posts since August 26, 1998.

Reed that the utility of large networks, particularly social networks, can scale exponentially with the size of the network . The reason for this is that the number of possible sub-groups of network participants is 2N ‚àí N ‚àí 1, where N is the number of participants. This grows much more rapidly than either * the number of participants, N, or * the number of possible pair connections, N(N ‚àí 1)/2 (which follows Metcalfe's law). so that even if the utility of groups available to be joined is very small on a per-group basis, eventually the network effect of potential group membership can dominate the overall economics of the system. Derivation Given a set A of N people, it has 2N possible subsets. This is not difficult to see, since we can form each possible subset by simply choosing for each element of A one of two possibilities: whether to include that element, or not. However, this includes the (one) empty set, and N singletons, which are not properly subgroups. So 2N ‚àí N ‚àí 1 subsets remain, which is exponential, like 2N. Quote From David P. Reed's, \\"The Law of the Pack\\" (Harvard Business Review, February 2001, pp 23‚Äì4): :\\"[E]ven Metcalfe's law understates the value created by a group-forming network [GFN] as it grows. Let's say you have a GFN with n members. If you add up all the potential two-person groups, three-person groups, and so on that those members could form, the number of possible groups equals 2n. So the value of a GFN increases exponentially, in proportion to 2n. I call that Reed's Law. And its implications are profound.\\"  Business implications  Reed's Law is often mentioned when explaining competitive dynamics of internet platforms. As the law states that a network becomes more valuable when people can easily form subgroups to collaborate, while this value increases exponentially with the number of connections, business platform that reaches a sufficient number of members can generate network effects that dominate the overall economics of the system. Criticism Other analysts of network value functions, including Andrew Odlyzko, have argued that both Reed's Law and Metcalfe's Law overstate network value because they fail to account for the restrictive impact of human cognitive limits on network formation. According to this argument, the research around Dunbar's number implies a limit on the number of inbound and outbound connections a human in a group-forming network can manage, so that the actual maximum-value structure is much sparser than the set-of-subsets measured by Reed's law or the complete graph measured by Metcalfe's law.

The wind moves the printed net, thus constantly changing its distance to the wall and to the net's shadow. Difference in distance of the front and rear picket fence on a bridge create moir√© patterns. In mathematics, physics, and art, moir√© patterns ( , , ) or moir√© fringes are large-scale interference patterns that can be produced when an opaque ruled pattern with transparent gaps is overlaid on another similar pattern. For the moir√© interference pattern to appear, the two patterns must not be completely identical, but rather displaced, rotated, or have slightly different pitch. Moir√© patterns appear in many situations. In printing, the printed pattern of dots can interfere with the image. In television and digital photography, a pattern on an object being photographed can interfere with the shape of the light sensors to generate unwanted artifacts. They are also sometimes created deliberately ‚Äì in micrometers they are used to amplify the effects of very small movements. In physics, its manifestation is the beat phenomenon that occurs in many wave interference conditions.  Etymology  The term originates from moire (moir√© in its French adjectival form), a type of textile, traditionally of silk but now also of cotton or synthetic fiber, with a rippled or \\"watered\\" appearance. Moire, or \\"watered textile\\", is made by pressing two layers of the textile when wet. The similar but imperfect spacing of the threads creates a characteristic pattern which remains after the fabric dries. In French, the adjective moir√© (in use since at least 1823) derives from the earlier verb moirer, \\"to produce a watered textile by weaving or pressing\\". Moirer, in turn, is a variation of the word mouaire which is an adoption of the English mohair (in use since at least 1570). Mohair comes from the Arabic mukhayyar (, \\"chosen\\"), a cloth made from the wool of the Angora goat. Mukhayyar () descends from khayyara (, \\"he chose\\"). \\"Chosen\\" is meant in the sense of \\"a choice, or excellent, cloth\\".  Pattern formation  Line moir√© with slow movement of the revealing layer upward Shape moir√© Moir√© pattern created by overlapping two sets of concentric circles Moir√© patterns are often an artifact of images produced by various digital imaging and computer graphics techniques, for example when scanning a halftone picture or ray tracing a checkered plane (the latter being a special case of aliasing, due to undersampling a fine regular pattern). This can be overcome in texture mapping through the use of mipmapping and anisotropic filtering. The drawing on the upper right shows a moir√© pattern. The lines could represent fibers in moir√© silk, or lines drawn on paper or on a computer screen. The nonlinear interaction of the optical patterns of lines creates a real and visible pattern of roughly parallel dark and light bands, the moir√© pattern, superimposed on the lines. The moir√© effect also occurs between overlapping transparent objects. For example, an invisible phase mask is made of a transparent polymer with a wavy thickness profile. As light shines through two overlaid masks of similar phase patterns, a broad moir√© pattern occurs on a screen some distance away. This phase moir√© effect and the classical moir√© effect from opaque lines are two ends of a continuous spectrum in optics, which is called the universal moir√© effect. The phase moir√© effect is the basis for a type of broadband interferometer in x-ray and particle wave applications. It also provides a way to reveal hidden patterns in invisible layers. =Line moir√©= Line moir√© is one type of moir√© pattern; a pattern that appears when superposing two transparent layers containing correlated opaque patterns. Line moir√© is the case when the superposed patterns comprise straight or curved lines. When moving the layer patterns, the moir√© patterns transform or move at a faster speed. This effect is called optical moir√© speedup. More complex line moir√© patterns are created if the lines are curved or not exactly parallel. =Shape moir√©= Shape moir√© is one type of moir√© pattern demonstrating the phenomenon of moir√© magnification. 1D shape moir√© is the particular simplified case of 2D shape moir√©. One-dimensional patterns may appear when superimposing an opaque layer containing tiny horizontal transparent lines on top of a layer containing a complex shape which is periodically repeating along the vertical axis. Moir√© patterns revealing complex shapes, or sequences of symbols embedded in one of the layers (in form of periodically repeated compressed shapes) are created with shape moir√©, otherwise called band moir√© patterns. One of the most important properties of shape moir√© is its ability to magnify tiny shapes along either one or both axes, that is, stretching. A common 2D example of moir√© magnification occurs when viewing a chain-link fence through a second chain-link fence of identical design. The fine structure of the design is visible even at great distances.  Calculations  = Moir√© of parallel patterns =  Geometrical approach  Consider two patterns made of parallel and equidistant lines, e.g., vertical lines. The step of the first pattern is , the step of the second is , with . If the lines of the patterns are superimposed at the left of the figure, the shift between the lines increases when going to the right. After a given number of lines, the patterns are opposed: the lines of the second pattern are between the lines of the first pattern. If we look from a far distance, we have the feeling of pale zones when the lines are superimposed (there is white between the lines), and of dark zones when the lines are \\"opposed\\". The middle of the first dark zone is when the shift is equal to . The th line of the second pattern is shifted by compared to the th line of the first network. The middle of the first dark zone thus corresponds to n \\\\cdot \\\\delta p = \\\\frac{p}{2} that is n = \\\\frac{p}{2 \\\\delta p}. The distance between the middle of a pale zone and a dark zone is d = n \\\\cdot (p+\\\\delta p) = \\\\frac{p^2}{2 \\\\delta p}+\\\\frac{p}{2} the distance between the middle of two dark zones, which is also the distance between two pale zones, is 2d = \\\\frac{p^2}{\\\\delta p}+p From this formula, we can see that: * the bigger the step, the bigger the distance between the pale and dark zones; * the bigger the discrepancy , the closer the dark and pale zones; a great spacing between dark and pale zones mean that the patterns have very close steps. The principle of the moir√© is similar to the Vernier scale.  Mathematical function approach  Moir√© pattern (bottom) created by superimposing two grids (top and middle) The essence of the moir√© effect is the (mainly visual) perception of a distinctly different third pattern which is caused by inexact superimposition of two similar patterns. The mathematical representation of these patterns is not trivially obtained and can seem somewhat arbitrary. In this section we shall give a mathematical example of two parallel patterns whose superimposition forms a moir√© pattern, and show one way (of many possible ways) these patterns and the moir√© effect can be rendered mathematically. The visibility of these patterns is dependent on the medium or substrate in which they appear, and these may be opaque (as for example on paper) or transparent (as for example in plastic film). For purposes of discussion we shall assume the two primary patterns are each printed in greyscale ink on a white sheet, where the opacity (e.g., shade of grey) of the \\"printed\\" part is given by a value between 0 (white) and 1 (black) inclusive, with representing neutral grey. Any value less than 0 or greater than 1 using this grey scale is essentially \\"unprintable\\". We shall also choose to represent the opacity of the pattern resulting from printing one pattern atop the other at a given point on the paper as the average (i.e. the arithmetic mean) of each pattern's opacity at that position, which is half their sum, and, as calculated, does not exceed 1. (This choice is not unique. Any other method to combine the functions that satisfies keeping the resultant function value within the bounds [0,1] will also serve; arithmetic averaging has the virtue of simplicity‚Äîwith hopefully minimal damage to one's concepts of the printmaking process.) We now consider the \\"printing\\" superimposition of two almost similar, sinusoidally varying, grey-scale patterns to show how they produce a moir√© effect in first printing one pattern on the paper, and then printing the other pattern over the first, keeping their coordinate axes in register. We represent the grey intensity in each pattern by a positive opacity function of distance along a fixed direction (say, the x-coordinate) in the paper plane, in the form f = \\\\frac{1 + \\\\sin(k x)}{2} where the presence of 1 keeps the function positive definite, and the division by 2 prevents function values greater than 1. The quantity represents the periodic variation (i.e., spatial frequency) of the pattern's grey intensity, measured as the number of intensity cycles per unit distance. Since the sine function is cyclic over argument changes of , the distance increment per intensity cycle (the wavelength) obtains when , or . Consider now two such patterns, where one has a slightly different periodic variation from the other: \\\\begin{align} f_1 &= \\\\frac{1 + \\\\sin(k_1 x)}{2} \\\\[4pt] f_2 &= \\\\frac{1 + \\\\sin(k_2 x)}{2} \\\\end{align} such that . The average of these two functions, representing the superimposed printed image, evaluates as follows: \\\\begin{align} f_3 &= \\\\frac{f_1 + f_2}{2} \\\\[5pt] &= \\\\frac12 + \\\\frac{\\\\sin(k_1 x) + \\\\sin(k_2 x)}{4} \\\\[5pt] &= \\\\frac{1 + \\\\sin(A x) \\\\cos(B x)}{2} \\\\end{align} where it is easily shown that A = \\\\frac{k_1 + k_2}{2} and B = \\\\frac{k_1 - k_2}{2}. This function average, , clearly lies in the range [0,1]. Since the periodic variation is the average of and therefore close to and , the moir√© effect is distinctively demonstrated by the sinusoidal envelope \\"beat\\" function , whose periodic variation is half the difference of the periodic variations and (and evidently much lower in frequency). Other one-dimensional moir√© effects include the classic beat frequency tone which is heard when two pure notes of almost identical pitch are sounded simultaneously. This is an acoustic version of the moir√© effect in the one dimension of time: the original two notes are still present‚Äîbut the listener's perception is of two pitches that are the average of and half the difference of the frequencies of the two notes. Aliasing in sampling of time-varying signals also belongs to this moir√© paradigm. = Rotated patterns = Consider two patterns with the same step , but the second pattern is rotated by an angle . Seen from afar, we can also see darker and paler lines: the pale lines correspond to the lines of nodes, that is, lines passing through the intersections of the two patterns. If we consider a cell of the lattice formed, we can see that it is a rhombus with the four sides equal to ; (we have a right triangle whose hypotenuse is and the side opposite to the angle is ). The pale lines correspond to the small diagonal of the rhombus. As the diagonals are the bisectors of the neighbouring sides, we can see that the pale line makes an angle equal to with the perpendicular of each pattern's line. Additionally, the spacing between two pale lines is , half of the long diagonal. The long diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right triangle and the sides of the right angle are and . The Pythagorean theorem gives: (2 D)^2 = d^2 (1 + \\\\cos \\\\alpha)^2 + p^2 that is: \\\\begin{align} (2D)^2 &= \\\\frac{p^2}{\\\\sin^2 \\\\alpha}(1+ \\\\cos \\\\alpha)^2 + p^2 \\\\[5pt] &= p^2 \\\\cdot \\\\left ( \\\\frac{(1 + \\\\cos \\\\alpha)^2}{\\\\sin^2 \\\\alpha} + 1\\\\right) \\\\end{align} thus \\\\begin{align} (2D)^2 &= 2 p^2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1+\\\\cos \\\\alpha}{\\\\sin^2 \\\\alpha} \\\\[5pt] D &= \\\\frac{\\\\frac{p}{2}}{\\\\sin\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}}. \\\\end{align} When is very small () the following small-angle approximations can be made: \\\\begin{align} \\\\sin \\\\alpha &\\\\approx \\\\alpha  \\\\cos \\\\alpha &\\\\approx 1 \\\\end{align} thus D \\\\approx \\\\frac{p}{\\\\alpha}. We can see that the smaller is, the farther apart the pale lines; when both patterns are parallel (), the spacing between the pale lines is infinite (there is no pale line). There are thus two ways to determine : by the orientation of the pale lines and by their spacing \\\\alpha \\\\approx \\\\frac{p}{D} If we choose to measure the angle, the final error is proportional to the measurement error. If we choose to measure the spacing, the final error is proportional to the inverse of the spacing. Thus, for the small angles, it is best to measure the spacing.  Implications and applications  = Printing full-color images = phasing. In graphic arts and prepress, the usual technology for printing full-color images involves the superimposition of halftone screens. These are regular rectangular dot patterns‚Äîoften four of them, printed in cyan, yellow, magenta, and black. Some kind of moir√© pattern is inevitable, but in favorable circumstances the pattern is \\"tight\\"; that is, the spatial frequency of the moir√© is so high that it is not noticeable. In the graphic arts, the term moir√© means an excessively visible moir√© pattern. Part of the prepress art consists of selecting screen angles and halftone frequencies which minimize moir√©. The visibility of moir√© is not entirely predictable. The same set of screens may produce good results with some images, but visible moir√© with others. = Television screens and photographs = Moir√© patterns are commonly seen on television screens when a person is wearing a shirt or jacket of a particular weave or pattern, such as a houndstooth jacket. This is due to interlaced scanning in televisions and non-film cameras, referred to as interline twitter. As the person moves about, the moir√© pattern is quite noticeable. Because of this, newscasters and other professionals who appear on TV regularly are instructed to avoid clothing which could cause the effect. Photographs of a TV screen taken with a digital camera often exhibit moir√© patterns. Since both the TV screen and the digital camera use a scanning technique to produce or to capture pictures with horizontal scan lines, the conflicting sets of lines cause the moir√© patterns. To avoid the effect, the digital camera can be aimed at an angle of 30 degrees to the TV screen. = Marine navigation = The moir√© effect is used in shoreside beacons called \\"Inogon leading marks\\" or \\"Inogon lights\\", manufactured by Inogon Licens AB, Sweden, to designate the safest path of travel for ships heading to locks, marinas, ports, etc., or to indicate underwater hazards (such as pipelines or cables). The moir√© effect creates arrows that point towards an imaginary line marking the hazard or line of safe passage; as navigators pass over the line, the arrows on the beacon appear to become vertical bands before changing back to arrows pointing in the reverse direction. An example can be found in the UK on the East shore of Southampton water, opposite Fawley oil refinery (). Similar moir√© effect beacons can be used to guide mariners to the centre point of an oncoming bridge; when the vessel is aligned with the centreline, vertical lines are visible. Inogon lights are deployed at airports to help pilots on the ground keep to the centreline of taxiways. = Strain measurement = Use of the moir√© effect in strain measurement: case of uniaxial traction (top) and of pure shear (bottom); the lines of the patterns are initially horizontal in both cases In manufacturing industries, these patterns are used for studying microscopic strain in materials: by deforming a grid with respect to a reference grid and measuring the moir√© pattern, the stress levels and patterns can be deduced. This technique is attractive because the scale of the moir√© pattern is much larger than the deflection that causes it, making measurement easier. The moir√© effect can be used in strain measurement: the operator just has to draw a pattern on the object, and superimpose the reference pattern to the deformed pattern on the deformed object. A similar effect can be obtained by the superposition of a holographic image of the object to the object itself: the hologram is the reference step, and the difference with the object are the deformations, which appear as pale and dark lines. See also: theory of elasticity, strain tensor and holographic interferometry. = Image processing = Some image scanner computer programs provide an optional filter, called a \\"descreen\\" filter, to remove Moir√©- pattern artifacts which would otherwise be produced when scanning printed halftone images to produce digital images. = Banknotes = Many banknotes exploit the tendency of digital scanners to produce moir√© patterns by including fine circular or wavy designs that are likely to exhibit a moir√© pattern when scanned and printed. = Microscopy = In super-resolution microscopy, the moir√© pattern can be used to obtain images with a resolution higher than the diffraction limit, using a technique known as structured illumination microscopy. In scanning tunneling microscopy, moir√© fringes appear if surface atomic layers have a different crystal structure than the bulk crystal. This can for example be due to surface reconstruction of the crystal, or when a thin layer of a second crystal is on the surface, e.g. single-layer, double-layer graphene, or Van der Waals heterostructure of graphene and hBN, or bismuth and antimony nanostructures. In transmission electron microscopy (TEM), translational moir√© fringes can be seen as parallel contrast lines formed in phase-contrast TEM imaging by the interference of diffracting crystal lattice planes that are overlapping, and which might have different spacing and/or orientation. Most of the moir√© contrast observations reported in the literature are obtained using high-resolution phase contrast imaging in TEM. However, if probe aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging is used, more direct interpretation of the crystal structure in terms of atom types and positions is obtained. =Materials science and condensed matter physics= In condensed matter physics, the moir√© phenomenon is commonly discussed for two- dimensional materials. The effect occurs when there is mismatch between the lattice parameter or angle of the 2D layer and that of the underlying substrate, or another 2D layer, such as in 2D material heterostructures. The phenomenon is exploited as a means of engineering the electronic structure or optical properties of materials, which some call moir√© materials. The often significant changes in electronic properties when twisting two atomic layers and the prospect of electronic applications has lead to the name twistronics of this field. A prominent example is in twisted bi-layer graphene, which forms a moir√© pattern and at a particular magic angle exhibits superconductivity and other important electronic properties.APS Physics - Trend: Bilayer Graphene's Wicked, Twisted Road In materials science, known examples exhibiting moir√© contrast are e.g. thin films or nanoparticles of MX- type (M = Ti, Nb; X = C, N) overlapping with austenitic matrix. Both phases, MX and the matrix, have face-centered cubic crystal structure and cube-on-cube orientation relationship. However, they have significant lattice misfit of about 20 to 24% (based on the chemical composition of alloy), which produces a moir√© effect.

His father died in 1569, when Pieter the younger was only five years old. Following the death of his mother in 1578, Pieter, together with his brother Jan Brueghel the Elder (also referred to as \\"Velvet Brueghel\\", \\"Paradise Breughel\\" and \\"Flower Breughel\\") and sister Marie, went to live with their grandmother Mayken Verhulst. Mayken Verhulst was the widow of the prolific artist Pieter Coecke van Aelst and an accomplished artist in her own right, known for her miniature paintings.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, p. 440-443 According to the early 17th-century Flemish biographer Karel van Mander Mayken Verhulst was possibly the first teacher of her two grandsons.Alexander Wied and Hans J. Van Miegroet. \\"Bruegel.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 11 July 2014. A country brawl The Brueghel family moved to Antwerp sometime after 1578 and Pieter possibly entered the studio of the landscape painter Gillis van Coninxloo (1544‚Äì1607). His teacher left Antwerp in 1585 and in the 1584/1585 registers of the Guild of Saint Luke, \\"Peeter Brugel\\" is listed as an independent master. On 5 November 1588 Pieter married Elisabeth Goddelet. The couple had seven children, many of whom died young. One son called Pieter Brueghel III was also a painter. Pieter Brueghel the Younger operated a large studio in Antwerp which produced mainly inexpensive copies of his father's work for local sale and export. He was nevertheless often in financial difficulties, possibly due to drinking. He had at least 9 pupils including Frans Snyders and Andries Daniels. He died in Antwerp, aged 72. Work =General= Pieter Brueghel the Younger painted landscapes, religious subjects, proverbs and village scenes. A few flower still life paintings by Pieter have been recorded. His genre paintings of peasants emphasize the picturesque, and are regarded by some as lacking Pieter the Elder's subtlety and humanism.Gibson, Michael. \\"A Dynasty of Painters: Belgium Celebrates the Bruegels\\". ARTnews (January 1981): 130. He and his workshop were prolific copyists of Pieter Bruegel the Elder's most famous compositions. His name and work were largely forgotten in the 18th and 19th centuries until he was rediscovered in the first half of the 20th century. =Original works= The Village Lawyer or The Tax Collector's Office Pieter Brueghel the Younger created original works largely in the idiom of his father which are energetic, bold and bright and adapted to the 17th-century style. One of the artist's most successful original designs was the painting of The Village Lawyer (sometimes also called the Tax Collector's Office, the Payment of the Tithe, the Lawyer of Bad Cases and the Notary's Office). The different titles of the work indicate that it may have been interpreted in these different ways in the 17th century. The title The Village Lawyer is probably the best suited since the person behind the desk is wearing a lawyer's bonnet, the collection of taxes usually did not occur in such setting and the paperwork and bags on the desk look like those for requests and decrees. The picture also shows peasants lining up with presents such as chickens and eggs to please the lawyer, which was a common occurrence, whereas tithe payments were made in grain.Natalie Zemon Davis, The Gift in Sixteenth-century France, University of Wisconsin Press, 2000 The painting shows his interest in and close observation of village life. Pieter Brueghel the Younger's workshop made many copies of the composition in different formats. There exist 19 signed and dated versions of this work (from between 1615‚Äì22) out of some 25 originals and 35 questionable versions. Another original composition of Pieter Brueghel the Younger is the Whitsun Bride, which is known in at least five autograph versions. One of the copies was formerly held by the Metropolitan Museum. The picture depicts a Flemish springtime custom of choosing and crowning a queen at Whitsuntide. The festival is focused around a flower gathered in the fields by children. This painting distinguishes itself in style and colour clearly from his father's work. The painting uses bright colours, with much vermilion and a rich blue- green in the figures and blue for the sky. The colours display a unity of tone distinctive of the 17th century. The picture also displays a unity in drawing and composition.Margaretta M. Salinger, The Whitsun Bride by Pieter Brueghel the Younger, in: Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, XXXIV (1939), p. 88-90 Another original composition by Pieter Brueghel the Younger are four small tondos representing the Four Stages of the River (all at the National Gallery in Prague). As his style never evolved from the manner of his early career it is difficult to date his work. Winter landscape with a bird trap In several cases, it is not clear whether a composition is an original composition by Pieter Brueghel the Younger or a copy after a lost work by his father. =Copyist= Apart from these paintings of his own invention, Pieter Brueghel the Younger also copied the famous compositions of his father through a technique called pouncing. This large scale activity was only possible thanks to his large, well-organized workshop. Comparison of some copies with the originals reveals differences, both in terms of colour as well as the omission or addition of certain details. This may indicate that the copyist re-drafted some sections, or possibly based the copies on prints after original works, rather than on the originals themselves. Pieter the Younger frequently made paintings out of his father's figural designs, including drawings for prints. As Pieter Brueghel the Younger did not always have access to the original paintings of his father he would in fact often rely on prints of his father's work to create his derived compositions. He also had access to (now lost) compositional drawings and intermediary cartoons which his father had made and then transferred to panels using pouncing.Odilia Bonebakker, Review of Christina Currie and Dominique Allart, The Brueg(H)el Phenomenon.

Drunkard on an egg The subjects of the copied works cover the entire range of themes and works by Pieter the Elder, including specific religious compositions on both the grand and the small scale. The principal subjects are proverb and peasant scenes of his father.Larry Silver, Peasant Scenes and Landscapes: The Rise of Pictorial Genres in the Antwerp Art Market, University of Pennsylvania Press, 4 Jan 2012, p. 196-207 One of the most frequently copied works of his father was the Winter Landscape with Skaters and a Bird-trap. This work was reproduced by Pieter Brueghel the Younger and his workshop at least 60 times. Of these copies 10 are signed and 4 are dated (1601, 1603, 1616 and 1626). Another popular work of Pieter the Elder was the Adoration of the Magi in the Snow of which Pieter Brueghel the Younger and his workshop produced about 30 copies. The workshop also produced no less than 25 copies of Pieter Brueghel the Elder's St John the Baptist Preaching, the original of which is widely believed to be the picture dated 1566, in the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest.Pieter Brueghel II (Brussels 1564/5-1637/8 Antwerp), Saint John the Baptist Preaching to the Multitude at Christie's Some of the copies are held in the collections of museums such as the Hermitage, the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp, the National Museum in Krak√≥w, the Rheinisches Landesmuseum in Bonn, the Stedelijk Museum Wuyts-Van Campen en Baron Caroly in Lier and the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Valenciennes. Some of the copies are signed and dated.St John the Baptist Preaching at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Magdalena Sobczyk, The recent restoration of the Groeningemuseum‚Äôs copy of The Sermon of Saint John the Baptist at Codart The quality and the large number of versions produced by Brueghel the Younger suggest that he had first-hand knowledge of his father's original. Scholars have contended that Brueghel the Elder's original picture offered a coded comment on the religious debates that raged in the Low Countries during the 1560s and that it represented a clandestine sermon as held by the Protestant reformers of that time. Pieter the Younger changed some details of his father's original composition. For instance, some versions omit an unidentified figure of a bearded man in black, who is turned towards the spectator. The omission appears to confirm speculation that his prominent presence in the original composition was not accidental. The distinctive face of this figure suggests that it may be a portrait, possibly of the artist himself or the patron who commissioned the painting. The figure of Christ has often been identified either as the man in grey behind the left arm of the Baptist or the bearded man further to the left with his arms crossed. The continued popularity of the picture a generation after Pieter Brueghel the Elder's death when the subject had not only lost its political implications but ran contrary to the religious current of the time, shows there was a more aesthetic appreciation of the subject. The composition was then likely enjoyed more for its representation of humanity in all its diversity of race, class, temperament and attitude.

At the same time the copies contributed to the popularisation of Pieter the Elder's idiom. Without the son's copying work the public would not have had access to his father's work, which was mainly held in elite private collections, such as the imperial collection of Rudolf II in Prague or the Farnese collection in Parma. At the same time Pieter the Younger extended his father's repertoire through his own inventions and variations on themes by his father.

Kennedy. During her lifetime, Jacqueline Kennedy was regarded as an international fashion icon. Her ensemble of a pink Chanel suit and matching pillbox hat that she wore in Dallas, Texas, when the president was assassinated on November 22, 1963, has become a symbol of her husband's death. Even after her death, she ranks as one of the most popular and recognizable First Ladies in American history, and in 1999, she was listed as one of Gallup's Most-Admired Men and Women of the 20th century. Kennedy was born in 1929 in Southampton, New York, to Wall Street stockbroker John Vernou Bouvier III and his wife, Janet Lee Bouvier. In 1951, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in French literature from George Washington University and worked for the Washington Times-Herald as an inquiring photographer. The following year, she met then-Congressman John Kennedy at a dinner party in Washington. He was elected to the Senate that same year, and the couple married on September 12, 1953, in Newport, Rhode Island. They had four children, two of whom died in infancy. Following her husband's election to the presidency in 1960, Jacqueline was known for her highly publicized restoration of the White House and emphasis on arts and culture, as well as for her style. At age 31, she was the third-youngest First Lady of the United States when her husband was inaugurated President. After the assassination and funeral of her husband, Jacqueline Kennedy and her children largely withdrew from public view. In 1968, she married Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. Following Onassis's death in 1975, she had a career as a book editor in New York City. She died of a non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 1994.  Early life (1929‚Äì1951)  =Family and childhood= Jacqueline Lee Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, at Stony Brook Southampton Hospital in Southampton, New York, to Wall Street stockbroker John Vernou \\"Black Jack\\" Bouvier III and socialite Janet Norton Lee.Pottker, p. 64 Bouvier's mother was of Irish descent, and her father had French, Scottish, and English ancestry.Flaherty, ch. 1, subsection \\"Early years\\" Named after her father, Bouvier was baptized at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola in Manhattan; she was raised in the Catholic faith.Spoto, pp. 22, 61 Jacqueline's younger sister, Caroline Lee, was born four years later in 1933. Bouvier spent her early childhood years in Manhattan and at Lasata, the Bouviers' country estate in East Hampton on Long Island. She looked up to her father, who likewise favored her over her sister, calling his elder child \\"the most beautiful daughter a man ever had\\". Biographer, Tina Santi Flaherty, referred to Jackie's early confidence in herself, seeing a link to her father's praise and positive attitude to her, and her sister Lee Radziwill stated that she would not have gained her \\"independence and individuality\\" had it not been for the relationship she had with their father and paternal grandfather, John Vernou Bouvier Jr.Tracy, pp. 9‚Äì10 From an early age, Bouvier was an enthusiastic equestrienne who successfully competed in the sport; horse-riding would remain a lifelong passion. She took ballet lessons, was an avid reader, and excelled at learning languages. Bouvier could speak English, French, Spanish, and Italian. French was particularly emphasized in her upbringing.Tracy, p. 38 Six-year-old Bouvier in 1935In 1935, Bouvier was enrolled in Manhattan's Chapin School, which she attended for Grades 1‚Äì7.Pottker, p. 74; Spoto, p. 28 She was a bright student but often misbehaved; one of her teachers described her as \\"a darling child, the prettiest little girl, very clever, very artistic, and full of the devil\\". Bouvier's mother attributed her daughter's behavior to the way that she finished her assignments ahead of classmates and then acted out in boredom.Harris, pp. 540‚Äì541 Her behavior improved after the headmistress warned her that none of her positive qualities would matter if she did not behave. The marriage of Bouvier's parents was strained by her father's alcoholism and extramarital affairs; the family had also struggled with financial difficulties following the Wall Street Crash of 1929.Flaherty, Ch. 1, \\"School Days\\"; Pottker, p. 99; Leaming, p. 7 They separated in 1936 and divorced four years later, with the press publishing intimate details of the split.Leaming (2001), p. 5; Flaherty, Ch. 1, \\"School Days\\" According to her cousin John H. Davis, Bouvier was deeply affected by the divorce and subsequently had a \\"tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own.\\" When her mother married Standard Oil heir Hugh Dudley Auchincloss, Jr., Bouvier and her sister did not attend the ceremony, because it was arranged quickly and travel was restricted due to World War II. Bouvier gained three step-siblings from Auchincloss' two previous marriages, Hugh \\"Yusha\\" Auchincloss III, Thomas Gore Auchincloss, and Nina Gore Auchincloss; she formed the closest bond with Yusha, who became one of her most trusted confidants.Tracy, p. 17 The marriage later produced two more children, Janet Jennings Auchincloss in 1945 and James Lee Auchincloss in 1947. After the remarriage, Auchincloss' Merrywood estate in McLean, Virginia, became the Bouvier sisters' primary residence, although they also spent time at his other estate, Hammersmith Farm in Newport, Rhode Island, and in their father's homes in New York City and Long Island.Pottker, p. 114 Although she retained a relationship with her father, Bouvier also regarded her stepfather as a close paternal figure. He gave her a stable environment and the pampered childhood she never would have experienced otherwise.Pottker, p. 8 While Bouvier adjusted to her mother's remarriage, she sometimes felt like an outsider in the WASP social circle of the Auchinclosses, attributing the feeling to her being Catholic as well as being a child of divorce, which was not common in that social group at that time.Pottker, pp. 100‚Äì101 After seven years at Chapin, Bouvier attended the Holton-Arms School in Northwest Washington, D.C. from 1942 to 1944, and Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut, from 1944 to 1947.Pottker, p. 7 She chose Miss Porter's because it was a boarding school that allowed her to distance herself from the Auchinclosses, and because the school placed an emphasis on college preparatory classes.Spoto, p. 57 In her senior class yearbook, Bouvier was acknowledged for \\"her wit, her accomplishment as a horsewoman, and her unwillingness to become a housewife\\". Jacqueline later hired her childhood friend Nancy Tuckerman to be her Social Secretary at the White House. She graduated among the top students of her class and received the Maria McKinney Memorial Award for Excellence in Literature.Spoto, p. 63 = College and early career = In the fall of 1947, Bouvier entered Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, at that time a women's institution.Pottker, pp. 113‚Äì114 She had wanted to attend Sarah Lawrence College, closer to New York City, but her parents insisted that she choose the more isolated Vassar.Pottker, pp. 113-114; Leaming, pp. 10‚Äì11 Bouvier was an accomplished student who participated in the school's art and drama clubs and wrote for its newspaper.Spoto, pp. 67‚Äì68 Due to her dislike of Vassar's location in Poughkeepsie, she did not take an active part in its social life and instead traveled back to Manhattan for the weekends.Pottker, p. 116; Leaming, pp. 14‚Äì15 She had made her debut to high society in the summer before entering college and became a frequent presence in New York social functions. Hearst columnist Igor Cassini dubbed her the \\"debutante of the year\\".Leaming, pp. 14‚Äì15 Bouvier spent her junior year (1949‚Äì1950) in France‚Äîat the University of Grenoble in Grenoble, and at the Sorbonne in Paris‚Äîin a study-abroad program through Smith College.Leaming, p. 17 Upon returning home, she transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C., graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in French literature in 1951. During the early years of her marriage to John F. Kennedy, she took continuing education classes in American history at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. While attending George Washington, Bouvier won a twelve-month junior editorship at Vogue magazine; she had been selected over several hundred other women nationwide.Leaming (2014), pp. 19‚Äì21 The position entailed working for six months in the magazine's New York City office and spending the remaining six months in Paris. Before beginning the job, Bouvier celebrated her college graduation and her sister Lee's high school graduation by traveling with her to Europe for the summer. The trip was the subject of her only autobiography, One Special Summer, co-authored with Lee; it is also the only one of her published works to feature Jacqueline's drawings. On her first day at Vogue, the managing editor advised her to quit and go back to Washington. According to biographer Barbara Leaming, the editor was concerned about Bouvier's marriage prospects; she was 22 years of age and was considered too old to be single in her social circles. Bouvier followed the advice, left the job and returned to Washington after only one day of work. Bouvier moved back to Merrywood and was referred by a family friend to the Washington Times-Herald, where editor Frank Waldrop hired her as a part-time receptionist. A week later she requested more challenging work, and Waldrop sent her to city editor Sidney Epstein, who hired her as an \\"Inquiring Camera Girl\\" despite her inexperience, paying her $25 a week.Tracy, pp. 72‚Äì73 He recalled, \\"I remember her as this very attractive, cute-as-hell girl, and all the guys in the newsroom giving her a good look.\\" The position required her to pose witty questions to individuals chosen at random on the street and take their pictures for publication in the newspaper alongside selected quotations from their responses. In addition to the random \\"man on the street\\" vignettes, she sometimes sought interviews with people of interest, such as six-year-old Tricia Nixon. Bouvier interviewed Tricia a few days after her father Richard Nixon was elected to the vice presidency in the 1952 election.Beasley, p. 79; Adler, pp. 20‚Äì21 During this time, Bouvier was briefly engaged to a young stockbroker named John Husted. After only a month of dating, the couple published the announcement in The New York Times in January 1952.Leaming (2014), p. 25 After three months, Bouvier called off the engagement because she had found him \\"immature and boring\\" once she got to know him better.Spoto, pp. 89‚Äì91Tracy, p. 70  Marriage to John F. Kennedy  Jacqueline Kennedy in Hammersmith Farm of Newport, Rhode Island, on her wedding day, September 12, 1953 Bouvier and U.S. Representative John F. Kennedy belonged to the same social circle and were formally introduced by a mutual friend, journalist Charles L. Bartlett, at a dinner party in May 1952. She was attracted to Kennedy's physical appearance, wit and wealth. The pair also shared the similarities of Catholicism, writing, enjoying reading and having previously lived abroad.O'Brien, pp. 265‚Äì266 Kennedy was busy running for the U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts; the relationship grew more serious and he proposed to her after the November election. Bouvier took some time to accept, because she had been assigned to cover the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in London for The Washington Times-Herald. After a month in Europe, she returned to the United States and accepted Kennedy's marriage proposal. She then resigned from her position at the newspaper.Harris, pp. 548‚Äì549 Their engagement was officially announced on June 25, 1953.Alam, p. 8 Bouvier and Kennedy married on September 12, 1953, at St. Mary's Church in Newport, Rhode Island, in a mass celebrated by Boston's Archbishop Richard Cushing. The wedding was considered the social event of the season with an estimated 700 guests at the ceremony and 1,200 at the reception that followed at Hammersmith Farm.jfklibrary.org, Special Exhibit Celebrates 50th Anniversary of the Wedding of Jacqueline Bouvier and John F. Kennedy. The wedding dress was designed by Ann Lowe of New York City, and is now housed in the Kennedy Library in Boston, Massachusetts. The dresses of her attendants were also created by Lowe, who was not credited by Bouvier. thumb The newlyweds honeymooned in Acapulco, Mexico, before settling in their new home, Hickory Hill in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. Jacqueline developed a warm relationship with her in-laws, Joseph and Rose Kennedy.O'Brien, pp. 295‚Äì296Leaming (2001), pp. 31‚Äì32 In the early years of their marriage, the couple faced several personal setbacks. John suffered from Addison's Disease and from chronic and at times debilitating back pain, which had been exacerbated by a war injury; in late 1954, he underwent a near-fatal spinal operation.Dallek, Robert. An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917‚Äì1963. Back Bay Books, pp. 99‚Äì106, 113, 195‚Äì197 (2004) Additionally, Jacqueline suffered a miscarriage in 1955 and in August 1956 gave birth to a stillborn daughter, Arabella. They subsequently sold their Hickory Hill estate to John's brother Robert, who occupied it with his wife Ethel and their growing family, and bought a townhouse on N Street in Georgetown. Jacqueline and her husband also resided at an apartment at 122 Bowdoin Street in Boston, their permanent Massachusetts residence during his congressional career. Senator John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy on their wedding day, September 12, 1953 Jacqueline gave birth to daughter Caroline on November 27, 1957. At the time, she and John were campaigning for his re-election to the Senate, and they posed with their infant daughter for the cover of the April 21, 1958 issue of Life magazine.Leaming (2014), p. 90 They traveled together during the campaign, trying to narrow the geographical gap between them that had persisted for the first five years of the marriage. Soon enough, John Kennedy started to notice the value that his wife added to his congressional campaign. Kenneth O'Donnell remembered that \\"the size of the crowd was twice as big\\" when she accompanied her husband; he also recalled her as \\"always cheerful and obliging\\". John's mother Rose observed Jacqueline as not being \\"a natural-born campaigner\\" due to her shyness and being uncomfortable with too much attention.Spoto, pp. 142‚Äì144 In November 1958, John Kennedy was reelected to a second term. He credited Jacqueline's visibility in both ads and stumping as vital assets in securing his victory, and he called her \\"simply invaluable\\".Hunt and Batcher, p. 167 In July 1959, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger visited the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port and had his first conversation with Jacqueline; he found her to have \\"tremendous awareness, an all-seeing eye and a ruthless judgment\\".Schlesinger, p. 17 That year, Jack Kennedy traveled to 14 states, with Jacqueline taking long breaks from the trips so she could spend time with their daughter Caroline. She also counseled her husband on improving his wardrobe in preparation for his intended presidential campaign the following year.Spoto, p. 146 In particular, she traveled to Louisiana to visit Edmund Reggie and to help her husband garner support in the state for his presidential bid.  First Lady of the United States (1961‚Äì1963)  = Campaign for presidency = Jacqueline with her husband as he campaigns for the presidency in Appleton, Wisconsin, March 1960 On January 3, 1960, John F. Kennedy was a United States Senator from Massachusetts when he announced his candidacy for the presidency and launched his campaign nationwide. In the early months of the election year, Jacqueline accompanied her husband to campaign events such as whistle-stops and dinners.Spoto, p. 152 Shortly after the campaign began, she became pregnant. Due to her previous high-risk pregnancies, she decided to stay at home in Georgetown.Beasley, p. 72 Jacqueline subsequently participated in the campaign by writing a weekly syndicated newspaper column, Campaign Wife, answering correspondence, and giving interviews to the media. Despite her non- participation in the campaign, Jacqueline became the subject of intense media attention with her fashion choices. On one hand, she was admired for her personal style; she was frequently featured in women's magazines alongside film stars and named as one of the 12 best-dressed women in the world.Beasley, pp. 72‚Äì76 On the other hand, her preference for French designers and her spending on her wardrobe brought her negative press. In order to downplay her wealthy background, Jacqueline stressed the amount of work she was doing for the campaign and declined to publicly discuss her clothing choices. On July 13 at the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, the party nominated John F. Kennedy for President of the United States. Jacqueline did not attend the nomination due to her pregnancy, which had been publicly announced ten days earlier.Spoto, pp. 155‚Äì157 She was in Hyannis Port when she watched the September 26, 1960 debate‚Äîwhich was the nation's first televised presidential debate‚Äîbetween her husband and Republican candidate Richard Nixon, who was the incumbent vice president. Marian Cannon, the wife of Arthur Schlesinger, watched the debate with her. Days after the debates, Jacqueline contacted Schlesinger and informed him that John wanted his aid along with that of John Kenneth Galbraith in preparing for the third debate on October 13; she wished for them to give her husband new ideas and speeches.Schlesinger, p. 69 On September 29, 1960, the Kennedys appeared together for a joint interview on Person to Person, interviewed by Charles Collingwood. = As First Lady = Kennedy, President John F.

The First Lady is wearing a gown designed by Oleg CassiniCassini, p. 153 Jacqueline and her husband during the visit of Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba and his spouse to the US, May 1961 On November 8, 1960, John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican opponent Richard Nixon in the U.S. presidential election. A little over two weeks later on November 25, Jacqueline gave birth to the couple's first son, John F. Kennedy, Jr. She spent two weeks recuperating in the hospital, during which the most minute details of both her and her son's conditions were reported by the media in what has been considered the first instance of national interest in the Kennedy family.Spoto, p. 164 Her husband was sworn in as president on January 20, 1961. As a presidential couple, the Kennedys differed from the Eisenhowers by their political affiliation, youth, and their relationship with the media. Historian Gil Troy has noted that in particular, they \\"emphasized vague appearances rather than specific accomplishments or passionate commitments\\" and therefore fit in well in the early 1960s' \\"cool, TV-oriented culture\\".Beasley, p. 76 The discussion about Jacqueline's fashion choices continued during her years in the White House, and she became a trendsetter, hiring American designer Oleg Cassini to design her wardrobe.Beasley, pp. 73‚Äì 74 She was the first presidential wife to hire a press secretary, Pamela Turnure, and carefully managed her contact with the media, usually shying away from making public statements, and strictly controlling the extent to which her children were photographed.Beasley, pp. 78‚Äì83 The media portrayed Kennedy as the ideal woman, which led academic Maurine Beasley to observe that she \\"created an unrealistic media expectation for first ladies that would challenge her successors\\". Nevertheless, the First Lady attracted worldwide positive public attention and gained allies for the White House and international support for the Kennedy administration and its Cold War policies.Schwalbe, pp. 111‚Äì127 Although Jacqueline stated that her priority as a First Lady was to take care of the President and their children, she also dedicated her time to the promotion of American arts and preservation of its history. The restoration of the White House was her main contribution, but she also furthered the cause by hosting social events that brought together elite figures from politics and the arts. One of her unrealized goals was to found a Department of the Arts, but she did contribute to the establishment of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, established during Johnson's tenure.  White House restoration  Kennedy with Charles Collingwood during their televised tour of the restored White House in 1962 Jacqueline had visited the White House on two occasions before she became First Lady: the first time as a grade-school tourist in 1941 and again as the guest of outgoing First Lady Mamie Eisenhower shortly before her husband's inauguration. She was dismayed to find that the mansion's rooms were furnished with undistinguished pieces that displayed little historical significance and made it her first major project as First Lady to restore its historical character. On her first day in residence, she began her efforts with the help of interior decorator Sister Parish. She decided to make the family quarters attractive and suitable for family life by adding a kitchen on the family floor and new rooms for her children. The $50,000 that had been appropriated for this effort was almost immediately exhausted. Continuing the project, she established a fine arts committee to oversee and fund the restoration process and solicited the advice of early American furniture expert Henry du Pont. To solve the funding problem, a White House guidebook was published, sales of which were used for the restoration. Working with Rachel Lambert Mellon, Kennedy also oversaw the redesign and replanting of the Rose Garden and the East Garden, which was renamed the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden after her husband's assassination. In addition, Kennedy helped to stop the destruction of historic homes in Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., because she felt these buildings were an important part of the nation's capital and played an essential role in its history. John and Jacqueline Kennedy at Christmas 1962 Prior to Kennedy's years as First Lady, presidents and their families had taken furnishings and other items from the White House when they departed; this led to the lack of original historical pieces in the mansion. She personally wrote to possible donors in order to track down these missing furnishings and other historical pieces of interest. Kennedy initiated a Congressional bill establishing that White House furnishings would be the property of the Smithsonian Institution rather than available to departing ex- presidents to claim as their own. She also founded the White House Historical Association, the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, the position of a permanent Curator of the White House, the White House Endowment Trust, and the White House Acquisition Trust. She was the first presidential spouse to hire a White House curator. On February 14, 1962, Jacqueline, accompanied by Charles Collingwood of CBS News, took American television viewers on a tour of the White House. In the tour, she stated that \\"I feel so strongly that the White House should have as fine a collection of American pictures as possible. It's so important ... the setting in which the presidency is presented to the world, to foreign visitors. The American people should be proud of it. We have such a great civilization. So many foreigners don't realize it. I think this house should be the place we see them best.\\" The film was watched by 56 million television viewers in the United States, and was later distributed to 106 countries. Kennedy won a special Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Trustees Award for it at the Emmy Awards in 1962, which was accepted on her behalf by Lady Bird Johnson. Kennedy was the only First Lady to win an Emmy.  Foreign trips  Jacqueline Kennedy and President Kennedy during their visit to Mexico, June 1962 Kennedy at the Taj Mahal, Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India, March 1962 Throughout her husband's presidency and more than any of the preceding First Ladies, Kennedy made many official visits to other countries, on her own or with the President. Despite the initial worry that she might not have \\"political appeal\\", she proved popular among international dignitaries. Before the Kennedys' first official visit to France in 1961, a television special was shot in French with the First Lady on the White House lawn. After arriving in the country, she impressed the public with her ability to speak French, as well as her extensive knowledge of French history.Goodman, Sidey and Baldrige, pp. 73‚Äì74 At the conclusion of the visit, Time magazine seemed delighted with the First Lady and noted, \\"There was also that fellow who came with her.\\" Even President Kennedy joked, \\"I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris ‚Äì and I have enjoyed it!\\" From France, the Kennedys traveled to Vienna, Austria, where Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was asked to shake the President's hand for a photo. He replied, \\"I'd like to shake her hand first.\\" Khrushchev later sent her a puppy; the animal was significant for being the offspring of Strelka, the dog that had gone to space during a Soviet space mission.Meagher and Gragg, p. 83 At the urging of U.S. Ambassador to India John Kenneth Galbraith, Kennedy undertook a tour of India and Pakistan with her sister Lee Radziwill in 1962. The tour was amply documented in photojournalism as well as in Galbraith's journals and memoirs. The President of Pakistan, Ayub Khan, had given her a horse named Sardar as a gift. He had found out on his visit to the White House that he and the First Lady had a common interest in horses. Life magazine correspondent Anne Chamberlin wrote that Kennedy \\"conducted herself magnificently\\" although noting that her crowds were smaller than those that President Dwight Eisenhower and Queen Elizabeth II attracted when they had previously visited these countries. In addition to these well-publicized trips during the three years of the Kennedy administration, she traveled to countries including Afghanistan, Austria, Canada, Colombia, United Kingdom, Greece, Italy, Mexico, Morocco, Turkey, and Venezuela. Unlike her husband, Kennedy was fluent in Spanish, which she used to address Latin American audiences.  Death of infant son  In early 1963, Jacqueline was again pregnant, which led her to curtail her official duties. She spent most of the summer at a home she and the President had rented on Squaw Island, which was near the Kennedy compound on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. On August 7 (five weeks ahead of her scheduled due date), she went into labor and gave birth to a boy, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, via emergency Caesarean section at nearby Otis Air Force Base. The infant's lungs were not fully developed, and he was transferred from Cape Cod to Boston Children's Hospital, where he died of hyaline membrane disease two days after birth.Taraborrelli, J. Randy. Jackie, Ethel, Joan: Women of Camelot. Warner Books: 2000. Jacqueline had remained at Otis Air Force Base to recuperate after the Caesarean delivery; her husband went to Boston to be with their infant son and was present when he died. On August 14, the President returned to Otis to take her home and gave an impromptu speech to thank nurses and airmen who had gathered in her suite. In appreciation, she presented hospital staff with framed and signed lithographs of the White House. The First Lady was deeply affected by Patrick's death and proceeded to enter a state of depression.Leaming (2014), pp. 120‚Äì122 However, the loss of their child had a positive impact on the marriage and brought the couple closer together in their shared grief. Arthur Schlesinger wrote that while President Kennedy always \\"regarded Jacqueline with genuine affection and pride,\\" their marriage \\"never seemed more solid than in the later months of 1963\\".Schlesinger, p. xiv Jacqueline's friend Aristotle Onassis was aware of her depression and invited her to his yacht to recuperate. President Kennedy initially had reservations, but he relented because he believed that it would be \\"good for her\\". The trip was widely disapproved of within the Kennedy administration, by much of the general public, and in Congress. The First Lady returned to the United States on October 17, 1963. She would later say she regretted being away as long as she was but had been \\"melancholy after the death of my baby\\".  Assassination and funeral of John F. Kennedy  Presidential limousine minutes before the assassination On November 21, 1963, the First Lady and the President embarked on a political trip to Texas with several goals in mind; this was the first time that she had joined her husband on such a trip in the U.S.Leaming (2014), p. 123 After a breakfast on November 22, they took a very short flight on Air Force One from Fort Worth's Carswell Air Force Base to Dallas' Love Field, accompanied by Texas Governor John Connally and his wife Nellie.Bugliosi, pp. 30, 34 The First Lady was wearing a bright pink Chanel suit and a pillbox hat, which had been personally selected by President Kennedy.Alam, p. 36 A motorcade was to take them to the Trade Mart, where the president was scheduled to speak at a lunch. The First Lady was seated to her husband's left in the third row of seats in the presidential limousine, with the Governor and his wife seated in front of them. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife followed in another car in the motorcade. After the motorcade turned the corner onto Elm Street in Dealey Plaza, the First Lady heard what she thought to be a motorcycle backfiring and did not realize that it was a gunshot until she heard Governor Connally scream. Within 8.4 seconds, two more shots had rung out, and one of the shots struck her husband in the head. Almost immediately, she began to climb onto the back of the limousine; Secret Service agent Clint Hill later told the Warren Commission that he thought she had been reaching across the trunk for a piece of her husband's skull that had been blown off. Hill ran to the car and leapt onto it, directing her back to her seat. As Hill stood on the back bumper, Associated Press photographer Ike Altgens snapped a photograph that was featured on the front pages of newspapers around the world.Trask, p. 318 She would later testify that she saw pictures \\"of me climbing out the back. But I don't remember that at all\\". pink Chanel suit, stands alongside Lyndon B. Johnson as he takes the Presidential oath of office administered by Sarah Hughes aboard Air Force One The President was rushed for the 3.8 mile trip to Parkland Hospital. At the First Lady's request, she was allowed to be present in the operating room. President Kennedy never regained consciousness. He died not long after, aged 46. After Jacqueline's husband was pronounced dead, she refused to remove her blood-stained clothing and reportedly regretted having washed the blood off her face and hands, explaining to Lady Bird Johnson that she wanted \\"them to see what they have done to Jack\\". She continued to wear the blood-stained pink suit as she boarded Air Force One and stood next to Johnson when he took the oath of office as president. The unlaundered suit was donated to the National Archives and Records Administration in 1964 and, under the terms of an agreement with her daughter Caroline, will not be placed on public display until 2103. Johnson's biographer Robert Caro wrote that Johnson wanted Jacqueline to be present at his swearing-in in order to demonstrate the legitimacy of his presidency to JFK loyalists and to the world at large.Caro, p. 329 Family members depart the U.S. Capitol after a lying-in-state service for the President, November 24, 1963 Jacqueline took an active role in planning her husband's state funeral, modeling it after Abraham Lincoln's service. She requested a closed casket, overruling the wishes of her brother-in-law, Robert.Hilty, p. 484 The funeral service was held at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington D.C., with the burial taking place at nearby Arlington National Cemetery. Jacqueline led the procession on foot and lit the eternal flame‚Äîcreated at her request‚Äîat the gravesite. Lady Jeanne Campbell reported back to the London Evening Standard: \\"Jacqueline Kennedy has given the American people ... one thing they have always lacked: Majesty.\\" A week after the assassination, new president Lyndon B. Johnson issued an executive order that established the Warren Commission‚Äîled by Chief Justice Earl Warren‚Äîto investigate the assassination. Ten months later, the Commission issued its report finding that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone when he assassinated President Kennedy. Privately, his widow cared little about the investigation, stating that even if they had the right suspect, it would not bring her husband back. Nevertheless, she gave a deposition to the Warren Commission. Following the assassination and the media coverage that had focused intensely on her during and after the burial, Jacqueline stepped back from official public view, apart from a brief appearance in Washington to honor the Secret Service agent, Clint Hill, who had climbed aboard the limousine in Dallas to try to shield her and the President.  Life following the assassination (1963‚Äì1975)  =Mourning period and later public appearances = On November 29, 1963‚Äîa week after her husband's assassination‚ÄîJacqueline was interviewed in Hyannis Port by Theodore H. White of Life magazine.Spoto, pp. 233‚Äì234 In that session, she compared the Kennedy years in the White House to King Arthur's mythical Camelot, commenting that the President often played the title song of Lerner and Loewe's musical recording before retiring to bed. She also quoted Queen Guinevere from the musical, trying to express how the loss felt. The era of the Kennedy administration would subsequently often be referred to as the \\"Camelot Era,\\" although historians have later argued that the comparison is not appropriate, with Robert Dallek stating that Kennedy's \\"effort to lionize [her husband] must have provided a therapeutic shield against immobilizing grief.\\"Tomlin, p. 295 Kennedy and her children remained in the White House for two weeks following the assassination. Wanting to \\"do something nice for Jackie,\\" President Johnson offered an ambassadorship to France to her, aware of her heritage and fondness for the country's culture, but she turned the offer down, as well as follow-up offers of ambassadorships to Mexico and the United Kingdom. At her request, Johnson renamed the Florida space center the John F. Kennedy Space Center a week after the assassination. Kennedy later publicly praised Johnson for his kindness to her.Andersen, pp. 55‚Äì56 Kennedy spent 1964 in mourning and made few public appearances. It has been speculated that she may have been suffering from undiagnosed posttraumatic stress disorder due to intrusive flashbacks. In the winter following the assassination, she and the children stayed at Averell Harriman's home in Georgetown. On January 14, 1964, Kennedy made a televised appearance from the office of the Attorney General, thanking the public for the \\"hundreds of thousands of messages\\" she had received since the assassination and said she had been sustained by America's affection for her late husband. She purchased a house for herself and her children in Georgetown but sold it later in 1964 and bought a 15th-floor penthouse apartment for $250,000 at 1040 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan in the hopes of having more privacy. In the following years, Jacqueline attended selected memorial dedications to her late husband. She also oversaw the establishment of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, which is the repository for official papers of the Kennedy Administration.Tracy, p. 180 Designed by architect I.M. Pei, it is situated next to the University of Massachusetts campus in Boston. Despite having commissioned William Manchester's authorized account of President Kennedy's death, The Death of a President, Jacqueline was subject to significant media attention in 1966‚Äì1967 when she and Robert Kennedy tried to block the publication.Mills, p. 363Schlesinger, Vol 2., p. 762White, pp. 98‚Äì99 They sued publishers Harper & Row in December 1966; the suit was settled the following year when Manchester removed passages that detailed President Kennedy's private life. White viewed the ordeal as validation of the measures the Kennedy family, Jacqueline in particular, were prepared to take to preserve President Kennedy's public image. During the Vietnam War in November 1967, Life magazine dubbed Kennedy \\"America's unofficial roving ambassador\\" when she and David Ormsby-Gore, former British ambassador to the United States during the Kennedy administration, traveled to Cambodia, where they visited the religious complex of Angkor Wat with Chief of State Norodom Sihanouk. November 1967Alam, p. 32 According to historian Milton Osbourne, her visit was \\"the start of the repair to Cambodian-US relations, which had been at a very low ebb\\". She also attended the funeral services of Martin Luther King, Jr. in Atlanta, Georgia, in April 1968, despite her initial reluctance due to the crowds and reminders of President Kennedy's death.Leaming (2014), pp. 237‚Äì238 = Relationship with Robert F. Kennedy = After her husband's assassination, Jacqueline relied heavily on her brother-in-law Robert F. Kennedy; she observed him to be the \\"least like his father\\" of the Kennedy brothers.Thomas, p. 91 He had been a source of support after she had suffered a miscarriage early in her marriage; it was he, not her husband, who stayed with her in the hospital.Hersh, p. 85 In the aftermath of the assassination, Bobby became a surrogate father for her children until eventual demands by his own large family and his responsibilities as Attorney General required him to reduce attention.Spoto, pp. 239‚Äì240 He credited Jackie with convincing him to stay in politics, and she supported his 1964 run for United States Senator from New York.Tracy, p. 194 The January 1968 Tet offensive in Vietnam resulted in a drop in President Johnson's poll numbers, and Robert Kennedy's advisors urged him to enter the upcoming presidential race. When Art Buchwald asked him if he intended to run, Robert replied, \\"That depends on what Jackie wants me to do\\".Heymann, p. 141 She met with him around this time and encouraged him to run after she had previously advised him to not follow Jack, but to \\"be yourself\\". Privately, she worried about his safety; she believed that Bobby was more disliked than her husband had been and that there was \\"so much hatred\\" in the United States.Thomas, p. 361 She confided in him about these feelings, but by her own account, he was \\"fatalistic\\" like her.Flynt and Eisenbach, p. 216 Despite her concerns, Jacqueline campaigned for her brother-in-law and supported him,Ford, p. 273 and at one point even showed outright optimism that through his victory, members of the Kennedy family would once again occupy the White House. Just after midnight PDT on June 5, 1968, an enraged Palestinian gunman named Sirhan Sirhan mortally wounded Robert Kennedy minutes after he and a crowd of his supporters had been celebrating his victory in the California Democratic presidential primary. Jacqueline Kennedy rushed to Los Angeles to join his wife Ethel, her brother-in-law Ted Kennedy, and the other Kennedy family members at his hospital bedside. Bobby Kennedy never regained consciousness and died 26 hours after the shooting. = Marriage to Aristotle Onassis = After Robert Kennedy's death in 1968, Jacqueline reportedly suffered a relapse of the depression she had suffered in the days following her husband's assassination nearly five years prior.Pottker, p. 257 She came to fear for her life and those of her two children, saying: \\"If they're killing Kennedys, then my children are targets ... I want to get out of this country\\". On October 20, 1968, Kennedy married her long-time friend Aristotle Onassis, a wealthy Greek shipping magnate who was able to provide the privacy and security she sought for herself and her children. The wedding took place on Skorpios, Onassis' private Greek island in the Ionian Sea.Spoto, p. 266 After marrying Onassis, she took the legal name Jacqueline Onassis and consequently lost her right to Secret Service protection, which is an entitlement of a widow of a U.S. president. The marriage brought her considerable adverse publicity. The fact that Aristotle was divorced and his former wife Athina Livanos was still living led to speculation that Jacqueline might be excommunicated by the Roman Catholic church, though that concern was explicitly dismissed by Boston's Archbishop, Cardinal Richard Cushing as \\"nonsense\\". She was condemned by some as a \\"public sinner\\", and became the target of paparazzi who followed her everywhere and nicknamed her \\"Jackie O\\".Tracy, p. 211 In 1968, billionaire heiress Doris Duke, whom Onassis was friends with, appointed her as the vice president of the Newport Restoration Foundation. Onassis publicly championed the foundation. During their marriage, the couple inhabited six different residences: her 15-room Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan, her horse farm in New Jersey, his Avenue Foch apartment in Paris, his private island Skorpios, his house in Athens, and his yacht Christina O. Kennedy ensured that her children continued a connection with the Kennedy family by having Ted Kennedy visit them often.Heymann, p. 90 She developed a close relationship with Ted, and from then on he was involved in her public appearances.Hersh, p. 512 Aristotle Onassis' health deteriorated rapidly following the death of his son Alexander in a plane crash in 1973.Spoto, p. 282 He died of respiratory failure at age 69 in Paris on March 15, 1975. His financial legacy was severely limited under Greek law, which dictated how much a non-Greek surviving spouse could inherit. After two years of legal wrangling, Kennedy eventually accepted a settlement of $26 million from Christina Onassis‚ÄîAristotle's daughter and sole heir‚Äîand waived all other claims to the Onassis estate.Tracy, p. 232 Later years (1975‚Äì1990s)  Ronald and Nancy Reagan Onassis with Hillary Clinton in 1993 After the death of her second husband, Onassis returned permanently to the United States, splitting her time between Manhattan, Martha's Vineyard, and the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. In 1975, she became a consulting editor at Viking Press, a position that she held for two years. After almost a decade of avoiding participation in political events, Onassis attended the 1976 Democratic National Convention and stunned the assembled delegates when she appeared in the visitors' gallery.Sabato, p. 324Reeves, pp. 124‚Äì127 She resigned from Viking Press in 1977 after John Leonard of The New York Times stated that Onassis held some responsibility for Viking's publication of the Jeffrey Archer novel Shall We Tell the President?, set in a fictional future presidency of Ted Kennedy and describing an assassination plot against him.Silverman, pp. 71‚Äì72 Two years later, she appeared alongside her mother- in-law Rose Kennedy at Faneuil Hall in Boston when Ted Kennedy announced that he was going to challenge incumbent president Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination for president.Leaming (2014), p. 292 She participated in the subsequent presidential campaign, which was unsuccessful.Lawrence, p. 95 Following her resignation from Viking Press, Kennedy was hired by Doubleday, where she worked as an associate editor under an old friend, John Turner Sargent, Sr. Among the books she edited for the company are Larry Gonick's The Cartoon History of the Universe,Spoto, p. 319 the English translation of the three volumes of Naghib Mahfuz's Cairo Trilogy (with Martha Levin), and autobiographies of ballerina Gelsey Kirkland, singer-songwriter Carly Simon, and fashion icon Diana Vreeland. She also encouraged Dorothy West, her neighbor on Martha's Vineyard and the last surviving member of the Harlem Renaissance, to complete the novel The Wedding (1995), a multi-generational story about race, class, wealth, and power in the U.S. In addition to her work as an editor, Onassis participated in cultural and architectural preservation. In the 1970s, she led a historic preservation campaign to save Grand Central Terminal from demolition and renovate the structure in Manhattan. A plaque inside the terminal acknowledges her prominent role in its preservation. In the 1980s, she was a major figure in protests against a planned skyscraper at Columbus Circle that would have cast large shadows on Central Park; the project was cancelled. A later project proceeded despite protests: a large twin-towered skyscraper, the Time Warner Center, was completed in 2003. Her notable historic preservation efforts also include her influence in the campaign to save Olana, the home of Frederic Edwin Church in upstate New York. Onassis remained the subject of considerable press attention, especially from the paparazzi photographer Ron Galella, who followed her around and photographed her as she went about her normal activities; he took candid photos of her without her permission. She ultimately obtained a restraining order against him, and the situation brought attention to the problem of paparazzi photography. From 1980 until her death, Jacqueline maintained a close relationship with Maurice Tempelsman, a Belgian-born industrialist and diamond merchant who was her companion and personal financial adviser.Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis at Arlington National Cemetery website In the early 1990s, Onassis supported Bill Clinton and contributed money to his presidential campaign. Following the election, she met with First Lady Hillary Clinton and advised her on raising a child in the White House. In her memoir Living History, Clinton wrote that Onassis was \\"a source of inspiration and advice for me\\".Clinton, pp. 135‚Äì138 Democratic consultant Ann Lewis observed that Onassis had reached out to the Clintons \\"in a way she has not always acted toward leading Democrats in the past\\".  Illness, death and funeral  Kennedy Onassis's grave at Arlington National Cemetery In November 1993, Jacqueline was thrown from her horse while participating in a fox hunt in Middleburg, Virginia, and was taken to the hospital to be examined. A swollen lymph node was discovered in her groin, which was initially diagnosed by the doctor to be caused by an infection.Leaming (2014), pp. 308‚Äì309 The fall from the horse contributed to her deteriorating health over the next six months. In December, Onassis developed new symptoms, including a stomach ache and swollen lymph nodes in her neck, and was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a blood cancer. She began chemotherapy in January 1994 and publicly announced the diagnosis, stating that the initial prognosis was good. She continued to work at Doubleday, but by March the cancer had spread to her spinal cord and brain, and by May to her liver and was deemed terminal. Onassis made her last trip home from New York Hospital‚ÄìCornell Medical Center on May 18, 1994. The following night at 10:15 p.m., she died in her sleep in her Manhattan apartment at age 64. In the morning, John F. Kennedy, Jr. announced his mother's death to the press, stating that she had been \\"surrounded by her friends and her family and her books, and the people and the things that she loved\\". He added that \\"She did it in her very own way, and on her own terms, and we all feel lucky for that.\\" On May 23, 1994, her funeral Mass was held a few blocks away from her apartment at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, the Catholic parish where she was baptized in 1929 and confirmed as a teenager.Spoto, p. 22 She was interred at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, alongside President Kennedy, their son Patrick, and their stillborn daughter Arabella. President Bill Clinton delivered a eulogy at her graveside service. At the time of her death, Onassis was survived by her children Caroline and John Jr., three grandchildren, sister Lee Radziwill, son-in-law Edwin Schlossberg, and half-brother James Lee Auchincloss. She left an estate that its executors valued at $43.7 million.  Legacy  = Popularity = Official portrait of Jacqueline Kennedy at the White House Jacqueline Kennedy remains one of the most popular First Ladies. She was featured 27 times on the annual Gallup list of the top 10 most admired people of the second half of the 20th century; this number is superseded by only Billy Graham and Queen Elizabeth II and is higher than that of any U.S. president. In 2011, she was ranked in fifth place in a list of the five most influential First Ladies of the twentieth century for her \\"profound effect on American society\\". In 2014, she ranked third place in a Siena College Institute survey, behind Eleanor Roosevelt and Abigail Adams. In 2015, she was included in a list of the top ten influential U.S. First Ladies due to the admiration for her based around \\"her fashion sense and later after her husband's assassination, for her poise and dignity\\". In 2020, Time magazine included her name on its list of 100 Women of the Year. She was named Woman of the Year 1962 for her efforts in uplifting the American history and art. Kennedy is seen as being customary in her role as First Lady, though Magill argues her life was validation that \\"fame and celebrity\\" changed the way First Ladies are evaluated historically.Magill, p. 2817 Hamish Bowles, curator of the \\"Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years\\" exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, attributed her popularity to a sense of unknown that was felt in her withdrawal from the public which he dubbed \\"immensely appealing\\". After Kennedy's death, Kelly Barber referred to her as \\"the most intriguing woman in the world\\", furthering that her stature was also due to her affiliation with valuable causes. Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony summarized that the former First Lady \\"became an aspirational figure of that era, one whose privilege might not be easily reached by a majority of Americans but which others could strive to emulate\\". Since the late 2000s, Kennedy's traditional persona has been invoked by commentators when referring to fashionable political spouses. A wide variety of commentators have credited Kennedy with restoring the White House; the list includes Hugh Sidey, Leticia Baldrige, Laura Bush, Kathleen P. Galop, and Carl Anthony. Tina Turner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee have cited Kennedy as influences. = Style icon = Kennedy at a State dinner on May 22, 1962 Jacqueline Kennedy became a global fashion icon during her husband's presidency. After the 1960 election, she commissioned French-born American fashion designer and Kennedy family friend Oleg Cassini to create an original wardrobe for her appearances as First Lady. From 1961 to 1963, Cassini dressed her in many of her most iconic ensembles, including her Inauguration Day fawn coat and Inaugural gala gown, as well as many outfits for her visits to Europe, India, and Pakistan. In 1961, Kennedy spent $45,446 more on fashion than the $100,000 annual salary her husband earned as president. Kennedy preferred French couture, particularly the work of Chanel, Balenciaga, and Givenchy, but was aware that in her role as First Lady, she would be expected to wear American designers' work. After noticing that her taste for Paris fashion was being criticized in the press, she wrote to the fashion editor Diana Vreeland to ask for suitable American designers, particularly those who could reproduce the Paris look. After considering the letter, which expressed Kennedy's dislike of prints, and her preference for \\"terribly simple, covered- up clothes,\\" Vreeland recommended Norman Norell, who was considered America's First Designer, and was known for his high-end simplicity and fine quality work. She also suggested Ben Zuckerman, another highly regarded tailor who regularly offered re-interpretations of Paris couture, and the sportswear designer Stella Sloat, who occasionally offered Givenchy copies. Kennedy's first choice for her Inauguration Day coat was originally a purple wool Zuckerman model that was based on a Pierre Cardin design, but she instead settled on a fawn Cassini coat and wore the Zuckerman for a tour of the White House with Mamie Eisenhower. In her role as First Lady, Kennedy preferred to wear clean-cut suits with a skirt hem down to middle of the knee, three- quarter sleeves on notch-collar jackets, sleeveless A-line dresses, above-the- elbow gloves, low-heel pumps, and pillbox hats. Dubbed the \\"Jackie\\" look, these clothing items rapidly became fashion trends in the Western world. More than any other First Lady, her style was copied by commercial manufacturers and a large segment of young women. Her influential bouffant hairstyle, described as a \\"grown-up exaggeration of little girls' hair,\\" was created by Mr. Kenneth, who worked for her from 1954 until 1986.Wong, pp. 151‚Äì154 In her years after the White House, Kennedy underwent a style change; her new looks consisted of wide-leg pantsuits, silk Herm√®s headscarves, and large, round, dark sunglasses. She even began wearing jeans in public. She set a new fashion trend with beltless, white jeans with a black turtleneck that was never tucked in and instead pulled down over her hips. Kennedy and the President watching the America's Cup Race Kennedy acquired a large collection of jewelry throughout her lifetime. Her triple-strand pearl necklace, designed by American jeweler Kenneth Jay Lane, became her signature piece of jewelry during her time as First Lady in the White House. Often referred to as the \\"berry brooch,\\" the two-fruit cluster brooch of strawberries made of rubies with stems and leaves of diamonds, designed by French jeweler Jean Schlumberger for Tiffany & Co., was personally selected and given to her by her husband several days prior to his inauguration in January 1961. She wore Schlumberger's gold and enamel bracelets so frequently in the early and mid-1960s that the press called them \\"Jackie bracelets\\"; she also favored his white enamel and gold \\"banana\\" earrings. Kennedy wore jewelry designed by Van Cleef & Arpels throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s; her sentimental favorite was the Van Cleef & Arpels wedding ring given to her by President Kennedy. Kennedy was named to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1965.Lambert and Zilkha, pp. 64‚Äì69, 90 Many of her signature clothes are preserved at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum; pieces from the collection were exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 2001. Titled \\"Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years,\\" the exhibition focused on her time as a First Lady. In 2012, Time magazine included Kennedy on its All-TIME 100 Fashion Icons list. In 2016, Forbes included her on the list 10 Fashion Icons and the Trends They Made Famous.  Honors and memorials  * A high school named Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis High School for International Careers, was dedicated by New York City in 1995, the first high school named in her honor.

Cavafy poem that Maurice Tempelsman read at her funeral. * A white gazebo is dedicated to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis on North Madison Street in Middleburg, Virginia. The First Lady and President Kennedy frequented the small town of Middleburg and intended to retire in the nearby town of Atoka. She also hunted with the Middleburg Hunt numerous times.Pottker, p.181  Portrayals  Jaclyn Smith portrays Kennedy in the 1981 television film Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, depicting Kennedy's life until the end of the JFK presidency. The film's producer Louis Rudolph stated an interest in creating a \\"positive portrait of a woman who I thought had been very much maligned,\\" comments that were interpreted by John J. O'Connor of The New York Times as erasing any chances of critique toward Kennedy. Though Smith received praise for her performance, with Marilynn Preston calling her \\"convincing in an impossible role\\", Tom Shales wrote \\"Jaclyn Smith couldn't act her way out of a Gucci bag\\". Blair Brown portrays Kennedy in the 1983 miniseries Kennedy, set during the Kennedy presidency. Brown used wigs and makeup to better resemble Kennedy and said through playing the role she gained a different view of the assassination: \\"I realized that this was a woman witnessing the public execution of her husband.\\" Jason Bailey praised her performance, while Andrea Mullaney noted her resemblance to Kennedy and general shyness. Brown was nominated for a television BAFTA as Best Actress and a Golden Globe as Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film. Marianna Bishop, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Roma Downey portray Kennedy in the 1991 miniseries A Woman Named Jackie, covering her entire life until the death of Aristotle Onassis. Of being contacted for the role, Downey reflected: \\"I thought I was a strange choice because I didn't think I looked anything like her and I was Irish.\\" Half of Downey's wardrobe was designed by Shelley Komarov and Downey stated that though she had long harbored \\"great respect and admiration\\" for Kennedy, she was unaware of the troubles in her childhood. Reviewer Rick Kogan praised Downey with doing \\"a surprisingly fine job in the demanding title role\\", while Howard Rosenberg lamented Downey's performance failing to \\"pierce this thick glaze of superficiality\\". Ability credited the role with raising Downey's profile. In 1992, the miniseries won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries. Rhoda Griffis portrays Kennedy in the 1992 film Love Field, set shortly before and in the aftermath of JFK's assassination. It was Griffis' feature film debut. Griffis said she had been told by her orthodontist of her resemblance to Kennedy and was cast as her upon walking into the auditions for the role. Sally Taylor-Isherwood, Emily VanCamp, and Joanne Whalley portray Onassis in the 2000 television miniseries Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, covering chronologically her entire life. Whalley prepared for the role by listening to recordings of Kennedy's voice along with working with a dialect coach; by the end of production, she developed an attachment to Kennedy. Laura Fries assessed Whalley as lacking Kennedy's charisma despite being \\"soulful and regal\\" in her own right while Ron Wertheimer viewed Whalley as being passive in the role and lamented \\"the filmmakers render Jackie as Forrest Gump in a pillbox hat, someone who keeps passing close to the center of things without really touching -- or being touched by -- very much.\\" Stephanie Romanov portrays Kennedy in the 2000 film Thirteen Days, taking place during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Philip French of The Guardian noted her small role and being out of \\"the loop\\" was accurate of women's roles in \\"the early Sixties\\". Laura Clifford called Romanov \\"unconvincing\\" in the role. Jill Hennessy portrays Kennedy in the 2001 television film Jackie, Ethel, Joan: The Women of Camelot. Hennessy prepared for the performance by watching hours of archival footage of Kennedy and cited one of the reasons for her favoring of the miniseries was its distinctiveness in not focusing \\"strictly on the men or only on Jackie\\". Reviewers Anita Gates and Terry Kelleher believed Hennessy brought \\"elegance\\" to the role while Steve Oxman panned the performance: \\"Hennessy simply doesn't possess the right natural grace. But this pic has a habit of telling us more that it shows us, and the actress manages to communicate the most important elements of the story without ever making it especially convincing.\\" Jacqueline Bisset portrays Onassis in the 2003 film America's Prince: The John F. Kennedy Jr. Story. Bisset said the glasses she used during the film were holdovers from a prior role in The Greek Tycoon. Neil Genzlinger thought Bisset \\"should have known better\\" in taking on the role while Kristen Tauer wrote Bisset portraying Onassis as a mother was a \\"different central light than many proceeding films\\". Jeanne Tripplehorn portrays Onassis in the 2009 film Grey Gardens for a single scene. Tripplehorn said questions she had about Edith Bouvier Beale that she thought would be answered by being a part of the film remained unsolved. Tripplehorn received diverse reactions to her performance while Brian Lowry noted her resemblance to Onassis and small role. Katie Holmes portrays Kennedy in the 2011 miniseries The Kennedys, set during the Kennedy presidency and its 2017 sequel The Kennedys: After Camelot, focusing on her life after 1968. Mary McNamara and Hank Stuever regarded Holmes' performance with neutrality in their reviews of The Kennedys while Hadley Freeman called her \\"bloodless\\" in the role. Holmes stated reprising the role was a \\"bigger challenge\\" for having to act through later periods of Kennedy's life. When asked of the concurrent Jackie film, Holmes said, \\"I think its really exciting. It's just is a testament to how amazing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was and how much she meant to our country.\\" Holmes also stated both should be watched due to covering different periods of Jacqueline's life. In The Kennedys: After Camelot, Holmes' performance was viewed favorably by Daniel Feinberg and Allison Keane while Kristi Turnquist panned her. Minka Kelly portrays Kennedy in the 2013 film The Butler, giving the film's protagonist Cecil one of her husband's neckties after his assassination. Kelly said she was intimidated and scared taking on the role. Kelly admitted to having difficulty with perfecting Kennedy's voice, going \\"to sleep listening to her\\", and having discomfort with the wool clothing associated with the role. Ginnifer Goodwin portrays her in the 2013 television film Killing Kennedy. Goodwin used intimate photos to better portray Kennedy and was concerned \\"to do her justice and to play her as accurately as possible without ever doing an impression of her\\". Costar Rob Lowe said of seeing Goodwin in the pink Chanel suit, \\"It made it real. If I were under any illusions about what we were doing, seeing her in that iconic moment was, I would say, sobering.\\" Tom Carson wrote that Goodwin's \\"trademark vulnerability humanizes Jackie considerably\\" while Bruce Miller called her a miscast and Robert Lloyd and Brian Lowry panned her performance. Kim Allen portrays Kennedy in the 2016 film LBJ. Ray Bennett noted in his review of the film that Allen was in a non-speaking role. Natalie Portman portrays Kennedy in the 2016 film Jackie, set during the JFK presidency and the immediate aftermath of the assassination. Portman admitted being intimidated taking the role and doing research in preparation for filming. Nigel M. Smith wrote that by portraying Kennedy, Portman was \\"taking on arguably the biggest challenge of her career\\". Manohla Dargis, David Edelstein, and Peter Bradshaw praised her performance. Portman was nominated for Best Actress by Academy Awards, AACTA Awards, AWFJ, AFCA, and BSFC, and won the category by the Online Film Critics Society. Jodi Balfour portrays Kennedy in the eighth episode of the second season of Netflix's original drama series, The Crown, titled 'Dear Mrs. Kennedy,' set during the June 1961 visit of the Kennedy couple to the Buckingham Palace and the immediate reaction to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.  See also  * Kennedy family tree Notes  References  = Bibliography =       * Kennedy, Jacqueline (2011). Jacqueline Kennedy: Historic Conversations on Life with John F. Kennedy. Hyperion. .

","title":"Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis"},{"id":"64384","text":"Pieter Bruegel (also Brueghel or Breughel) the Elder (, ; ; ‚Äì 9 September 1569) was the most significant artist of Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting, a painter and printmaker, known for his landscapes and peasant scenes (so-called genre painting); he was a pioneer in making both types of subject the focus in large paintings. He was a formative influence on Dutch Golden Age painting and later painting in general in his innovative choices of subject matter, as one of the first generation of artists to grow up when religious subjects had ceased to be the natural subject matter of painting. He also painted no portraits, the other mainstay of Netherlandish art. After his training and travels to Italy, he returned in 1555 to settle in Antwerp, where he worked mainly as a prolific designer of prints for the leading publisher of the day. Only towards the end of the decade did he switch to make painting his main medium, and all his famous paintings come from the following period of little more than a decade before his early death, when he was probably in his early forties, and at the height of his powers. As well as looking forwards, his art reinvigorates medieval subjects such as marginal drolleries of ordinary life in illuminated manuscripts, and the calendar scenes of agricultural labours set in landscape backgrounds, and puts these on a much larger scale than before, and in the expensive medium of oil painting. He does the same with the fantastic and anarchic world developed in Renaissance prints and book illustrations.Gombrich, 295; Clark, 41‚Äì43, 27, 33, 57, also covering Gothic aspects of Bruegel's style He is sometimes referred to as \\"Peasant Bruegel\\", to distinguish him from the many later painters in his family, including his son Pieter Brueghel the Younger (1564‚Äì1638). From 1559, he dropped the 'h' from his name and signed his paintings as Bruegel; his relatives continued to use \\"Brueghel\\" or \\"Breughel\\". Life =Early life= Engraving designed by Bruegel and published by Hieronymus Cock, The Seven Deadly Sins or the Seven Vices ‚Äì Anger, 1558 The two main early sources for Bruegel's biography are Lodovico Guicciardini's account of the Low Countries (1567) and Karel van Mander's 1604 Schilder-boeck.Grove; van Mander's Bruegel biography in Dutch; Wied, 15‚Äì18 gives a full English translation. Guicciardini was an Italian who had lived in Antwerp since at least 1542, and probably knew Bruegel, which Van Mander, born in 1648 on the other side of Flanders, is most unlikely to have done. Guicciardini recorded that Bruegel was born in Breda, but Van Mander specified that Bruegel was born in a village (dorp) near Breda called \\"Brueghel\\",\\"den welcken is geboren niet wijt van Breda, op een Dorp geheeten Brueghel, welcks naem hy met hem ghedraghen heeft, en zijn naecomelinghen ghelaten.\\" which does not fit any known place.Grove: \\"none of the three Flemish villages of that name is close to Breda\\".; Wied, 18, says two of the villages (Groot Bruegel and Cleyn Bruegel) are close to Bree, Belgium, which is \\"Breda\\" in Latin, perhaps causing Van Mander confusion. Son en Breugel still has supporters but is 34 miles from Breda, though just outside Eindhoven ‚Äì see RKD. Nothing at all is known of his family background. Van Mander seems to assume he came from a peasant background, in keeping with the over-emphasis on Bruegel's peasant genre scenes given by van Mander and many early art historians and critics.Orenstein, 57‚Äì58; Grove The Blind Leading the Blind, 1568 In contrast, scholars of the last sixty years have emphasized the intellectual content of his work, and conclude: \\"There is, in fact, every reason to think that Pieter Bruegel was a townsman and a highly educated one, on friendly terms with the humanists of his time\\",Grove ignoring Van Mander's dorp and just placing his childhood in Breda itself. Breda was already a significant centre as the base of the House of Orange-Nassau, with a population of some 8,000,Wied, 19‚Äì20 although 90% of the 1300 houses were destroyed in a fire in 1534. However, this reversal can be taken to excess; although Bruegel moved in highly educated humanist circles, it seems \\"he had not mastered Latin\\", and had others add the Latin captions in some of his drawings.Orenstein, 64 From the fact that Bruegel entered the Antwerp painters' guild in 1551, it is inferred that he was born between 1525 and 1530.Orenstein, 5; Grove His master, according to Van Mander, was the Antwerp painter Pieter Coecke van Aelst.Orenstein, 5 Between 1545 and 1550 he was a pupil of Pieter Coecke, who died on 6 December 1550.This is according to Van Mander; although there is no documentation and little evident stylistic influence from his future father-in-law, modern scholars generally accept this. However, before this, Bruegel was already working in Mechelen, where he is documented between September 1550 and October 1551 assisting Peeter Baltens on an altarpiece (now lost), painting the wings in grisaille. Bruegel possibly got this work via the connections of Mayken Verhulst, the wife of Pieter Coecke. Mayken's father and eight siblings were all artists or married an artist, and lived in Mechelen.Orenstein, 5, 7 =Travel= In 1551 Bruegel became a free master in the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp. He set off for Italy soon after, probably by way of France. He visited Rome and, rather adventurously for the period, by 1552 he had reached Reggio Calabria at the southern tip of the mainland, where a drawing records the city in flames after a Turkish raid.Grove; Orenstein, 204 for the drawing He probably continued to Sicily, but by 1553 was back in Rome. There he met the miniaturist Giulio Clovio, whose will of 1578 lists paintings by Bruegel; in one case a joint work. These works, apparently landscapes, have not survived, but marginal miniatures in manuscripts by Clovio are attributed to Bruegel.Orenstein, 5‚Äì6; Grove The Big Fish Eat the Little Fish, Bruegel's drawing for a print, 1556.Orenstein, 140‚Äì142 He left Italy by 1554, and had reached Antwerp by 1555, when the set of prints to his designs known as the Large Landscapes were published by Hieronymus Cock, the most important print publisher of northern Europe. Bruegel's return route is uncertain, but much of the debate over it was made irrelevant in the 1980s when it was realized that the celebrated series of large drawings of mountain landscapes thought to have been made on the trip were not by Bruegel at all.Orenstein, 266‚Äì267, and following catalogue pages; Grove However, all the drawings from the trip that are considered authentic are of landscapes; unlike most other 16th-century artists visiting Rome he seems to have ignored both classical ruins and contemporary buildings.Snyder, 502; Orenstein, 96‚Äì97 for one agreed exception; see this British Museum page for another drawing of Roman ruins, perhaps the Colosseum, recently attributed to Bruegel =Antwerp and Brussels= From 1555 until 1563, Bruegel lived in Antwerp, then the publishing centre of northern Europe, mainly working as a designer of over forty prints for Cock, though his dated paintings begin in 1557.Orenstein, 7 With one exception, Bruegel did not work the plates himself, but produced a drawing which Cock's specialists worked from. He moved in the lively Humanist circles of the city, and his change of name (or at least its spelling) in 1559 can be seen as an attempt to Latinize it; at the same time he changed the script he signed in from the Gothic blackletter to Roman capitals. In 1563 he married Pieter Coecke van Aelst's daughter Mayken Coecke in Brussels, where he lived for the remainder of his short life. While Antwerp was the capital of Netherlandish commerce as well as the art market,Wied, 9‚Äì10 Brussels was the centre of government. Van Mander tells a story that his mother-in-law pushed for the move to distance him from his established servant girl mistress.Van Mander, quoted in Wied, 16; Orenstein, 7; Hagens, 15 By now painting had become his main activity, and his most famous works come from these years. His paintings were much sought after, with patrons including wealthy Flemish collectors and Cardinal Granvelle, in effect the Habsburg chief minister, who was based in Mechelen. Bruegel had two sons, both well known as painters, and a daughter about whom nothing is known. These were Pieter Brueghel the Younger (1564‚Äì1638) and Jan Brueghel the Elder (1568‚Äì1625); he died too early to train either of them. He died in Brussels on 9 September 1569 and was buried in the Kapellekerk.Grove; Orenstein, 8‚Äì9 Van Mander records that before he died he told his wife to burn some drawings, perhaps designs for prints, carrying inscriptions \\"which were too sharp or sarcastic...either out of remorse or for fear that she might come to harm or in some way be held responsible for them\\", which has led to much speculation that they were politically or doctrinally provocative, in a climate of sharp tension in both these areas. Historical background The Procession to Calvary, 1564, Bruegel's second largest painting at 124 cm √ó 170 cm (49 in √ó 67 in) Bruegel was born at a time of extensive change in Western Europe. Humanist ideals from the previous century influenced artists and scholars. Italy was at the end of its High Renaissance of arts and culture, when artists such as Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci painted their masterpieces. In 1517, about eight years before Bruegel's birth, Martin Luther created his Ninety-five Theses and began the Protestant Reformation in neighboring Germany. Reformation was accompanied by iconoclasm and widespread destruction of art, including in the Low Countries. The Catholic Church viewed Protestantism and its iconoclasm as a threat to the Church. The Council of Trent, which concluded in 1563, determined that religious art should be more focused on religious subject-matter and less on material things and decorative qualities. At this time, the Low Countries were divided into Seventeen Provinces, some of which wanted separation from the Habsburg rule based in Spain. The Reformation meanwhile produced a number of Protestant denominations that gained followers in the Seventeen Provinces, influenced by the newly Lutheran German states to the east and the newly Anglican England to the west. The Habsburg monarchs of Spain attempted a policy of strict religious uniformity for the Catholic Church within their domains and enforced it with the Inquisition. Increasing religious antagonisms and riots, political manoeuvrings, and executions eventually resulted in the outbreak of Eighty Years' War. In this atmosphere Bruegel reached the height of his career as a painter. Two years before his death, the Eighty Years' War began between the United Provinces and Spain. Although Bruegel did not live to see it, seven provinces became independent and formed the Dutch Republic, while the other ten remained under Habsburg control at the end of the war. Subjects =Peasants= Netherlandish Proverbs, 1559, oil on oak wood Children's Games, 1560 The Peasant Wedding, 1566‚Äì69, oil on panel. A late peasant subject, with a more monumental treatment. Pieter Bruegel specialized in genre paintings populated by peasants, often with a landscape element, though he also painted religious works. Making the life and manners of peasants the main focus of a work was rare in painting in Bruegel's time, and he was a pioneer of the genre painting. Many of his peasant paintings fall into two groups terms of scale and composition, both of which were original and influential on later painting. His earlier style shows dozens of small figures, seen from a high viewpoint, and spread fairly evenly across the central picture space. The setting is typically an urban space surrounded by buildings, within which the figures have a \\"fundamentally disconnected manner of portrayal\\", with individuals or small groups engaged in their own distinct activity, while ignoring all the others.Franits, 203 His earthy, unsentimental but vivid depiction of the rituals of village life‚Äîincluding agriculture, hunts, meals, festivals, dances, and games‚Äîare unique windows on a vanished folk culture, though still characteristic of Belgian life and culture today, and a prime source of iconographic evidence about both physical and social aspects of 16th-century life. For example, his famous painting Netherlandish Proverbs, originally The Blue Cloak, illustrates dozens of then-contemporary aphorisms, many of which still are in use in current Flemish, French, English and Dutch. The Flemish environment provided a large artistic audience for proverb-filled paintings because proverbs were well known and recognizable as well as entertaining. Children's Games shows the variety of amusements enjoyed by young people. His winter landscapes of 1565, like The Hunters in the Snow, are taken as corroborative evidence of the severity of winters during the Little Ice Age. Bruegel often painted community events, as in The Peasant Wedding and The Fight Between Carnival and Lent. In paintings like The Peasant Wedding, Bruegel painted individual, identifiable people, while the people in The Fight Between Carnival and Lent are unidentifiable, muffin-faced allegories of greed or gluttony. Bruegel also painted religious scenes in a wide Flemish landscape setting, as in the Conversion of Paul and The Sermon of St. John the Baptist. Even if Bruegel's subject matter was unconventional, the religious ideals and proverbs driving his paintings were typical of the Northern Renaissance. He accurately depicted people with disabilities, such as in The Blind Leading the Blind, which depicted a quote from the Bible: \\"If the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch\\" (Matthew 15:14). Using the Bible to interpret this painting, the six blind men are symbols of the blindness of mankind in pursuing earthly goals instead of focusing on Christ's teachings. Using abundant spirit and comic power, Bruegel created some of the very early images of acute social protest in art history. Examples include paintings such as The Fight Between Carnival and Lent (a satire of the conflicts of the Protestant Reformation) and engravings like The Ass in the School and Strongboxes Battling Piggybanks.Mayor, A. Hyatt (1971). Prints & People: A Social History of Printed Pictures. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 426. Over the 1560s Bruegel moved to a style showing only a few large figures, typically in a landscape background without a distant view. His paintings dominated by their landscapes take a middle course as regards both the number and size of figures. ; Late monumental peasant figures File:Pieter Bruegel d. √Ñ. 037.jpgThe Land of Cockaigne (1567), Alte Pinakothek, an illustration of the medieval mythical land of plenty called Cockaigne File:The Peasant and the Birdnester Pieter Bruegel the Elder 1568.jpegThe Peasant and the Nest Robber (1568), Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna File:Pieter Bruegel The Peasant Dance.jpgThe Peasant Dance (1568), Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, oil on oak panel File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Cripples.JPGThe Beggars (The Cripples) (1568), Louvre, Paris, oil on panel =Landscape elements= Landscape with the Flight into Egypt, 1563, 37.1 √ó 55.6 cm (14.6 √ó 21.9 in), owned by Cardinal Granvelle Bruegel adapted and made more natural the world landscape style, which shows small figures in an imaginary panoramic landscape seen from an elevated viewpoint that includes mountains and lowlands, water, and buildings. Back in Antwerp from Italy he was commissioned in the 1550s by the publisher Hieronymus Cock to make drawings for a series of engravings, the Large Landscapes, to meet what was now a growing demand for landscape images. Some of his earlier paintings, such as his Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (Courtauld, 1563), are fully within the Patinir conventions, but his Landscape with the Fall of Icarus (known from two copies) had a Patinir-style landscape, in which already the largest figure was a genre figure who was only a bystander for the supposed narrative subject, and may not even be aware of it. The date of Bruegel's lost original is unclear,about 1558 has been suggested but it is probably relatively early, and if so, foreshadows the trend of his later works. During the 1560s the early scenes crowded with multitudes of very small figures, whether peasant genre figures or figures in religious narratives, give way to a small number of much larger figures. Months of the year The Hunters in the Snow, 1565, oil on wood His famous set of landscapes with genre figures depicting the seasons are the culmination of his landscape style; the five surviving paintings use the basic elements of the world landscape (only one lacks craggy mountains) but transform them into his own style. They are larger than most previous works, with a genre scene with several figures in the foreground, and the panoramic view seen past or through trees.Silver, 39‚Äì52; Snyder, 502‚Äì510; Harbison, 140‚Äì142; Schama, 431‚Äì433 Bruegel was also aware of the Danube School's landscape style through prints.Wood, Chapter 5, especially 275‚Äì278 The series on the months of the year includes several of Bruegel's best-known works. In 1565, a wealthy patron in Antwerp, Niclaes Jonghelinck, commissioned him to paint a series of paintings of each month of the year. There has been disagreement among art historians as to whether the series originally included six or twelve works.Gibson, Walter S. (1977) :) . Bruegel. The World of Art Library. Thames and Hudson pp 147‚Äì148. Today, only five of these paintings survive and some of the months are paired to form a general season. Traditional Flemish luxury books of hours (e.g., the Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry; 1416) had calendar pages that included the Labours of the Months, depictions set in landscapes of the agricultural tasks, weather, and social life typical for that month. Bruegel's paintings were on a far larger scale than a typical calendar page painting, each one approximately three feet by five feet. For Bruegel, this was a large commission (the size of a commission was based on how large the painting was) and an important one. In 1565, the Calvinist riots began and it was only two years before the Eighty Years' War broke out. Bruegel may have felt safer with a secular commission so as to not offend Calvinist or Catholic. Some of the most famous paintings from this series included The Hunters in the Snow (December‚ÄìJanuary) and The Harvesters (August). Prints and drawings Beekeepers, c. 1568 On his return from Italy to Antwerp, Bruegel earned his living producing drawings to be turned into prints for the leading print publisher of the city, and indeed northern Europe, Hieronymus Cock. At his \\"House of the Four Winds\\" Cock ran a well- oiled production and distribution operation efficiently turning out prints of many sorts that was more concerned with sales than the finest artistic achievement. Most of Bruegel's prints come from this period, but he continued to produce drawn designs for prints until the end of his life, leaving only two completed out of a series of the Four Seasons.Orenstein, 236‚Äì238, and following pages The prints were popular and it is reasonable to assume that all those published have survived. In many cases we also have Bruegel's drawings. Although the subject matter of his graphic work was often continued in his paintings, there are considerable differences in emphases between the two oeuvres. To his contemporaries and for long after, until public museums and good reproductions of the paintings made these better known, Bruegel was much better known through his prints than his paintings, which largely explains the critical assessment of him as merely the creator of comic peasant scenes.Wied, 36 The prints are mostly engravings, though from about 1559 onwards some are etchings or mixtures of both techniques.Orenstein catalogues the prints in chronological order, as far as it is known Only one complete woodcut was made from a Bruegel design, with another left incomplete. This, The Dirty Wife, is a most unusual survival (now Metropolitan Museum of Art) of a drawing on the wooden block intended for printing. For some reason, the specialist block-cutter who carved away the block, following the drawing while also destroying it, had only done one corner of the design before stopping work. The design then appears as an engraving, perhaps soon after Bruegel's death.Orenstein, 241‚Äì242, 246‚Äì248; Metropolitan page Spring, 1565, a drawing made to be engraved. It was apparently never painted by Bruegel himself, but after his death came dozens of versions in paint by his son and others. Among his greatest successes were a series of allegories, among several designs adopting many of the very individual mannerisms of his compatriot Hieronymus Bosch: The Seven Deadly Sins and The Virtues. The sinners are grotesque and unidentifiable while the allegories of virtue often wear odd headgear. That imitations of Bosch sold well is demonstrated by his drawing Big Fish Eat Little Fish (now Albertina), which Bruegel signed but Cock shamelessly attributed to Bosch in the print version. Although Bruegel presumably made them, no drawings that are clearly preparatory studies for paintings survive. Most surviving drawings are finished designs for prints, or landscape drawings that are fairly finished. After a considerable purge of attributions in recent decades, led by Hans Mielke, sixty-one sheets of drawings are now generally agreed to be by Bruegel.Orenstein, vii gives the total; fifty-four were in the exhibition and are catalogued, and most others illustrated. These included all those from the largest collections, Berlin (10), London (8) and Vienna (6). Sellink in 2012 lists 70. A new \\"Master of the Mountain Landscapes\\" has emerged from the carnage. Mielke's key observation was that the lily watermark on the paper of several sheets was only found from around 1580 onwards, which led to the rapid acceptance of his proposal.Orenstein, 266‚Äì267, and following catalogue pages for individual works. Another group of about twenty-five pen drawings of landscapes, many signed and dated as by Bruegel, are now given to Jacob Savery, probably from the decade of so before Savery's death in 1603. A giveaway was that two drawings including the walls of Amsterdam were dated 1563 but included elements only built in the 1590s. This group appears to have been made as deliberate forgeries.Orenstein, 276‚Äì277, and following catalogue pages for individual works. Family Around 1563 Bruegel moved from Antwerp to Brussels, where he married Mayken Coecke, the daughter of the painter Pieter Coecke van Aelst and Mayken Verhulst. As registered in the archives of the Cathedral of Antwerp, their deposition for marriage was registered 25 July, 1563. The marriage itself was concluded in the Chapel Church, Brussels in 1563.Jean Bastiaensen, ‚ÄúDe verloving van Pieter Bruegel de Oude. Nieuw licht op de Antwerpse verankering‚Äù, Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen, 51 (2013), no. 1: 26‚Äì27. Pieter the Elder had two sons: Pieter Brueghel the Younger and Jan Brueghel the Elder (both kept their name as Brueghel). Their grandmother, Mayken Verhulst, trained the sons because \\"the Elder\\" died when both were very small children. The older brother, Pieter Brueghel copied his father's style and compositions with competence and considerable commercial success. Jan was much more original, and very versatile. He was an important figure in the transition to the Baroque style in Flemish Baroque painting and Dutch Golden Age painting in a number of its genres. He was often a collaborator with other leading artists, including with Peter Paul Rubens on many works including the Allegory of Sight. Other members of the family include Jan van Kessel the Elder (grandson of Jan Bruegel the Elder) and Jan van Kessel the Younger. Through David Teniers, the family is also related to the whole Teniers family of painters and the Quellinus family of painters and sculptors, since Jan- Erasmus Quellinus married Cornelia, daughter of David Teniers the Younger. Reception history Massacre of the Innocents, (c.1565‚Äì1567), British Royal Collection. A much-copied painting Bruegel's art was long more highly valued by collectors than critics. His friend Abraham Ortelius described him in a friendship album in 1574 as \\"the most perfect painter of his century\\", but both Vasari and Van Mander see him as essentially a comic successor to Hieronymus Bosch.Snyder, 484; Orenstein, 9-11, 59 But Bruegel's work was, as far as we know, always keenly collected. The banker Nicolaes Jonghelinck owned sixteen paintings; his brother Jacques Jonghelinck was a gentleman-sculptor and medallist, who also had significant business interests. He made medals and tombs in an international style for the Brussels elite, especially Cardinal Granvelle, who was also a keen patron of Bruegel.Snyder, 484‚Äì485 Granvelle owned at least two Bruegels, including the Courtauld Flight into Egypt, but we do not know if he bought them directly from the artist.Orenstein, 9‚Äì10; p. 30 Granvelle's nephew and heir was strong-armed out of his Bruegels by Rudolf II, the very acquisitive Austrian Habsburg Emperor. The series of the Months entered the Habsburg collections in 1594, given to Rudolf's brother and later taken by the emperor himself. Rudolf eventually owned at least ten Bruegel paintings.Trevor-Roper, Hugh; Princes and Artists, Patronage and Ideology at Four Habsburg Courts 1517‚Äì1633, 116, 1976, Thames & Hudson, A generation later Rubens owned eleven or twelve, which mostly passed to the Antwerp senator Pieter Stevens, and were then sold in 1668.Braham, Helen, The Princes Gate Collection, p. 7, Courtauld Institute Galleries, London 1981, Winter Landscape with (Skaters and) a Bird Trap (1565), Bruegel's most copied painting, smaller than many of his landscapes at 38 x 56 cm.Wied, 144, 186 Bruegel's son Pieter could still keep himself and a large studio team busy producing replicas or adaptations of Bruegel's works, as well as his own compositions along similar lines, sixty years or more after they were first painted. The most frequently copied works were generally not the ones that are most famous today, though this may reflect the availability of the full-scale detailed drawings that were evidently used. The most-copied painting is the Winter Landscape with (Skaters and) a Bird Trap (1565), of which the original is in Brussels; 127 copies are recorded.Sotheby's: Catalogue note on a good copy, sold London, Lot 10 9 July 2014 They include paintings after some of Bruegel's drawn print designs, especially Spring.Orenstein, 67‚Äì84 The next century's artists of peasant genre scenes were heavily influenced by Brueghel. Outside the Brueghel family, early figures were Adriaen Brouwer (c. 1605/6-1638) and David Vinckboons (1576‚Äìc.1632), both Flemish-born but spending much of their time in the northern Netherlands. As well as the general conception of such kermis subjects, Vinckboons and other artists took from Bruegel \\"such stylistic devices as the bird's-eye perspective, ornamentalized vegetation, bright palette, and stocky, odious figures.Franits, 35, 53‚Äì54 Forty years after their deaths, and over a century after Bruegel's, Jan Steen (1626‚Äì79) continued to show a particular interest in Bruegelian treatments. The critical treatment of Bruegel as essentially an artist of comic peasant scenes persisted until the late 19th century, even after his best paintings became widely visible as royal and aristocratic collections were turned into museums. This had been partly explicable when his work was mainly known from copies, prints and reproductions. Even Henri Hymans, whose work of 1890/91 was the first important contribution to modern Bruegel scholarship, could describe him thus: \\"His field of enquiry is certainly not of the most extensive; his ambition, too, is modest. He confines himself to a knowledge of mankind and the most immediate objects\\", a line no modern scholar is likely to take. As his landscape paintings, in good colour reproduction, have become his best-loved works, so his importance in the history of landscape art has become understood. Works There are about forty generally accepted surviving paintings, twelve of which are in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.Grove; Manfred Sellink in 2012 listed forty paintings, seventy drawings and seventy-five prints, the latter slightly higher numbers than other sources. A number of others are known to have been lost, including what, according to van Mander, Bruegel himself thought his best work, \\"a picture in which Truth triumphs\\".Wied, 17 Bruegel only etched one plate himself, The Rabbit Hunt, but designed some forty prints, both engravings and etchings, mostly for the Cock publishing house. As discussed above, about sixty-one drawings are now recognized as authentic, mostly designs for prints or landscapes.

His painting Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, now thought only to survive in copies, is the subject of the 1938 poem \\"Mus√©e des Beaux Arts\\" by W. H. Auden: > In Brueghel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away Quite > leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman Have heard the splash, the > forsaken cry, But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone As > it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green Water, and the > expensive delicate ship that must have seen Something amazing, a boy falling > out of the sky, Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on. It also was the subject of a 1960 poem by William Carlos Williams and was referenced in Nicolas Roeg's 1976 science fiction film The Man Who Fell to Earth. Further, Williams' final collection of poetry references a number of Bruegel's work. Two Monkeys, 1562, oil on panel Bruegel's painting Two Monkeys was the subject of Wis≈Çawa Szymborska's 1957 poem, \\"Brueghel's Two Monkeys\\". Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky referenced Bruegel's paintings in his films several times, notably in Solaris (1972) and The Mirror (1975). Director Lars von Trier also uses Bruegel's paintings in his film Melancholia (2011). This was used as a reference to Tarkovsky's Solaris, a movie with related themes. His 1564 painting The Procession to Calvary inspired the 2011 Polish- Swedish film co-production The Mill and the Cross, in which Bruegel is played by Rutger Hauer. Bruegel's paintings in the Kunsthistorisches Museum are shown in the 2012 film, Museum Hours, where his work is discussed at length by a guide. Seamus Heaney referenced Brueghel in his poem \\"The Seed Cutters\\". David Jones references the painting The Blind Leading the Blind in his World War One prose-poem In Parenthesis: \\"the stumbling dark of the blind, that Breughel knew about - ditch circumscribed\\". Michael Frayn, in his novel Headlong, imagines a lost panel from the 1565 Months series resurfacing unrecognized, which triggers a mad conflict between an art (and money) lover and the boor who possesses it. Much thought is spent on Bruegel's secret motives for painting it. In his book American Barricade, Danniel Schoonebeek references several Brueghel paintings in his poem \\"Poem for a Seven-Hour Flight\\", notably in the lines: \\"I am the hounds in Brueghel / do you know the hounds // here is the single fox I have killed will you wear it around your shoulders are you ashamed.\\" Author Don Delillo references Bruegel's painting The Triumph of Death in his novel Underworld and his short story \\"Pafko at the Wall\\". It is believed that the painting The Hunters in the Snow influenced the classic short story with the same title written by Tobias Wolff and featured in In the Garden of the North American Martyrs. In the foreword to his novel The Folly of the World, author Jesse Bullington explains that Bruegel's painting Netherlandish Proverbs not only inspired the title but also the plot to some extent. Various sections are introduced with a proverb depicted in the painting that alludes to a plot element. Poet Sylvia Plath references Bruegel's painting The Triumph of Death in her poem \\"Two Views of a Cadaver Room\\" from her collection 'The Colossus and Other Poems.

He was the son of the eminent Flemish Renaissance painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder. A close friend and frequent collaborator with Peter Paul Rubens, the two artists were the leading Flemish painters in the first three decades of the 17th century. Brueghel worked in many genres including history paintings, flower still lifes, allegorical and mythological scenes, landscapes and seascapes, hunting pieces, village scenes, battle scenes and scenes of hellfire and the underworld. He was an important innovator who invented new types of paintings such as flower garland paintings, paradise landscapes, and gallery paintings in the first quarter of the 17th century.Kolb, 2005, p. 1 He further created genre paintings that were imitations, pastiches and reworkings of his father's works, in particular his father's genre scenes and landscapes with peasants.Larry Silver, 2012, p. 3 Brueghel represented the type of the pictor doctus, the erudite painter whose works are informed by the religious motifs and aspirations of the Catholic Counter-Reformation as well as the scientific revolution with its interest in accurate description and classification. He was court painter of the Archduke and Duchess Albrecht and Isabella, the governors of the Habsburg Netherlands. The artist was nicknamed \\"Velvet\\" Brueghel, \\"Flower\\" Brueghel, and \\"Paradise\\" Brueghel. The first is believed to have been given him because of his mastery in the rendering of fabrics.Matthias Depoorter, Jan Brueghel at Baroque in the Southern Netherlands The second nickname is a reference to his specialization in flower still lifes and the last one to his invention of the genre of the paradise landscape. His brother Pieter Brueghel the Younger was traditionally nicknamed \\"de helse Brueghel\\" or \\"Hell Brueghel\\" because it was believed he was the author of a number of paintings with fantastic depictions of fire and grotesque imagery. These paintings have now been reattributed to Jan Brueghel the Elder.Alexander Wied and Hans J. Van Miegroet. Jan Breughel I. Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press.

His mother was the daughter of the prominent Flemish Renaissance artists Pieter Coecke van Aelst and Mayken Verhulst. His father died about a year after Jan's birth in 1569. It is believed that after the death of his mother in 1578, Jan, together with his brother Pieter Brueghel the Younger and sister Marie, went to live with their grandmother Mayken Verhulst, who was by then widowed. Mayken Verhulst was an artist in her own right. The early Flemish biographer Karel van Mander wrote in his Schilder- boeck published in 1604 that Mayken was the first art teacher of her two grandsons.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, pp. 444‚Äì455 She taught them drawing and watercolor painting of miniatures. Jan and his brother may also have trained with local artists in Brussels who were active as tapestry designers.About Jan Brueghel at Janbrueghel.net A Hermit before a Grotto, with Joos de Momper (II) Jan and his brother Pieter were then sent to Antwerp to study oil painting. According to Karel van Mander he studied under Peter Goetkint, an important dealer with a large collection of paintings in his shop. Goetkint died on 15 July 1583 not very long after Jan had started his training. It is possible that Jan continued his studies in this shop, which was taken over by Goetkint's widow, as no other master is recorded. It was common for Flemish painters of that time to travel to Italy to complete their studies. Jan Brueghel left for Italy, first traveling to Cologne where his sister Marie and her family lived. He later visited Frankenthal, an important cultural centre where a number of Flemish landscape artists were active.The lives and careers of Brueghel and Rubens, in: Anne T. Woollett et al., 2006, pp. 5‚Äì33Joaneath A. Spicer. \\"Frankenthal school.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 22 April 2016 He then went to Naples after probably spending time in Venice. In Naples he produced after June 1590 a number of drawings, which show his interest in landscapes and monumental architecture. He worked for Don Francesco Caracciolo, a prominent nobleman and priest and founder of the Clerics Regular Minor. Jan produced small-scale decorative works for Don Francesco. Rest on the Flight into Egypt, with Hans Rottenhammer Brueghel left Naples for Rome where he resided from 1592 to 1594. He befriended Paul Bril. Paul Bril was a landscape specialist from Antwerp who had moved to Rome in the late 16th century. Together with his brother Mathijs Bril, he created atmospheric landscapes for many Roman residences. Brueghel took inspiration from Bril's lively drawings and small-scale landscapes of the mid-1590s. During his time in Rome Jan Brueghel became acquainted with Hans Rottenhammer, a German painter of small highly finished cabinet paintings on copper. Rottenhammer painted religious and mythological compositions, combining German and Italian elements of style, which were highly esteemed. Brueghel collaborated with both Paul Bril and Rottenhammer. Brueghel also spent time making watercolors of Rome's antique monuments and seemed particularly fascinated by the vaulted interiors of the Colosseum. He enjoyed the protection of Cardinal Ascanio Colonna. In Rome he also met Cardinal Federico Borromeo, who played an important role in the Counter-Reformation and was also an avid art collector. The Cardinal became Brueghel's lifelong friend and patron. Brueghel took up residence in Borromeo's Palazzo Vercelli. When Borromeo became archbishop of Milan in June 1595, Brueghel followed him and became part of the Cardinal's household. He produced many landscape and flower paintings for the Cardinal. The temptation of St Anthony Brueghel stayed about a year in Milan and in 1596 he had returned to Antwerp where he remained active, save for a few interruptions, for the rest of his life. A year after his return Jan Brueghel was admitted as a Free Master in Antwerp's Guild of Saint Luke as the son of a master. The artist married on 23 January 1599 in the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp. The bride was Isabella de Jode, the daughter of the cartographer, engraver and publisher Gerard de Jode. Their son Jan was born on 13 September 1601. This first-born had Rubens as his godfather and later took over his father's workshop and was known as Jan Brueghel the Younger. Brueghel was registered as a burgher of Antwerp on 4 October 1601 as 'Jan Bruegel, Peetersone, schilder, van Bruessele' ('Jan Bruegel, son of Peeter, painter, of Brussels'). Just a month before, Brueghel had been elected dean of the Guild of Saint Luke, but he had not been able to take up the position as he was not a burgher of Antwerp. Upon becoming formally registered as a burgher the same year Brueghel could finally be the dean. The next year he was re-elected as dean. Assault on a convoy, with Sebastiaen Vrancx In 1603 his daughter Paschasia Brueghel was born. Rubens was also her godfather. His wife Isabella de Jode died the same year leaving him with two young children. It has been speculated that death of his wife was linked to the birth of his latest child. In the summer of 1604 Brueghel visited Prague. Prague was the location of the court of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor who promoted artistic innovation. The Emperor's court had attracted many Northern artists such as Bartholomeus Spranger and Hans von Aachen who created a new affected style, full of conceits, which became known as Mannerism.Peter Marshall, The Mercurial Emperor: The Magic Circle of Rudolf II in Renaissance Prague, Random House, 28 November 2013, p. 61 Upon returning to Antwerp in September 1604 Brueghel bought a large house called \\"De Meerminne\\" (The Mermaid) in the Lange Nieuwstraat in Antwerp on 20 September 1604. The artist remarried in April 1605. With his second wife Catharina van Mari√´nburg he had 8 children of whom Ambrosius became a painter. The Apostels Peter and Andrew After his appointment as court painter of the Archduke and Duchess Albrecht and Isabella in 1606, the artist was present in Brussels for periods in the years 1606, 1609, 1610 and 1613. On 28 August 2013 the court in Brussels paid Brueghel 3625 guilders for completing various works. From October 1610 onwards Rubens started taking on the role of intermediary for his friend Jan Brueghel. By the year 1625 Rubens had written about 25 letters to Cardinal Borromeo on behalf of Brueghel. In a letter to Borromeo Brueghel referred to his friend's role as that of \\"mio secretario Rubens\\" (my secretary Rubens). In the year 1612 or 1613 Peter Paul Rubens painted a portrait of Jan Brueghel and his family (Courtauld Institute, London). In 1613 he accompanied Rubens and Hendrick van Balen the Elder on a diplomatic mission to the Dutch Republic. Here they met Hendrick Goltzius and other Haarlem artists.Peter C. Sutton, Dutch & Flemish Paintings: The Collection of Willem Baron Van Dedem, frances lincoln ltd, 2002, p. 66 Archiduchess Isabella, with Rubens When Duke Johan Ernest van Saksen passed through Antwerp in 1614 he took time to pay a visit to Rubens and Brueghel in their workshops. Brueghel received many official commissions from the Antwerp city magistrate. Four of his paintings were offered by the Antwerp city magistrate to the Archduke and Duchess Albrecht and Isabella on 27 August 1615. He was in 1618 one of 12 important painters from Antwerp who were commissioned by the Antwerp city magistrate to produce a series of paintings for the Archduke and Duchess Albrecht and Isabella. For this commission, Brueghel coordinated the work on a painting cycle depicting an Allegory of the Five Senses. The artists participating in the project included Rubens, Frans Snyders, Frans Francken the Younger, Joos de Momper, Hendrick van Balen the Elder and Sebastiaen Vrancx. The works were destroyed in a fire in 1713. The Wedding Banquet On 9 March 1619 Brueghel bought a third house called Den Bock (the Billy Goat) located in the Antwerp Arenbergstraat. When on 6 August 1623 his daughter Clara Eugenia was baptized, Archduchess Isabella and Cardinal Borromeo were her godparents. Jan Brueghel died on 13 January 1625 in Antwerp from complications arising from cholera. The artist's estate was distributed on 3 June and 23 June 1627 among his surviving wife and his children from both marriages. Rubens, Hendrick van Balen the Elder, Cornelis Schut and Paulus van Halmaele were the executors of his last will. Rubens was the guardian of the surviving Brueghel children. His students included his son Jan as well as Daniel Seghers. Brueghel's daughter Paschasia married the painter Hieronymus van Kessel the Younger, and their son Jan van Kessel the Elder studied with Jan Brueghel the Younger. Brueghel's daughter Anna married David Teniers the Younger in 1637.Charles Sterling, Fifteenth- to Eighteenth- century European Paintings: France, Central Europe, the Netherlands, Spain, and Great Britain, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998, p. 129 Work =General= Bath of the Nymphs Jan Brueghel the Elder was a versatile artist who practised in many genres and introduced various new subjects into Flemish art. He was an innovator who contributed to the development of the various genres to which he put his hand such as flower still lifes, landscapes and seascapes, hunting pieces, battle scenes and scenes of hellfire and the underworld. His best-known innovations are the new types of paintings, which he introduced into the repertoire of Flemish art in the first quarter of the 17th century such as flower garland paintings, paradise landscapes and gallery paintings. Unlike contemporary Flemish Baroque artists, such as Rubens, he did not produce large altarpieces for the local churches. Jan Brueghel the Elder achieved a superb technical mastery, which enabled him to render materials, animals and landscapes with remarkable accuracy and a high degree of finish. He had an accomplished miniaturist technique allowing him to achieve an accurate description of nature. Village Kermis in Schelle with self-portrait Little is known about the workshop practices of Brueghel. He operated a large workshop that allowed him to produce a large quantity of works, which were in turn reproduced in his workshop. After Brueghel's death in 1625, Jan Brueghel the Younger took charge of his father's workshop which he operated in the same way as his father. This is clear in the style of the surviving paintings which are in the vein of his father's and the continued collaboration with former collaborators of his father such as Rubens and Hendrick van Balen. This workshop production contributed to the wide distribution of Jan Brueghel the Elder's creations.Anne T. Woollett et al., 2006, pp. 156‚Äì165 While his brother Pieter was engaged in the large-scale production of numerous works for the Antwerp art market, Jan Brueghel worked for a select clientele of aristocratic patrons and collectors of pictures to create more expensive and exclusive images.Larry Silver, 2012, p. 196 His works, such as his paradise landscapes, appealed to the aesthetic preferences of aristocrats who loved collecting such precious objects. His works, often painted on copper, were luxury objects intended for the simple pleasure of viewing as well as contemplation.Kolb, 2005, pp. 61‚Äì76 =Collaborations= Christ in Limbo, with Hans Rottenhammer Collaboration between artists specialized in distinctive genres was a defining feature of artistic practice in 17th century Antwerp. Jan Brueghel was likewise a frequent collaborator with fellow artists. As he was an artist with a wide range of skills he worked with a number of collaborators in various genres. His collaborators included landscape artists Paul Bril and Joos de Momper, architectural painter Paul Vredeman de Vries and figure painters Frans Francken the Younger, Hendrick de Clerck, Pieter van Avont and Hendrick van Balen. His collaborations with figure painter Hans Rottenhammer began in Rome around 1595 and ended in 1610. Rottenhammer was a gifted figure painter and known for his skill in painting nudes. Initially when the artists both lived in Venice, their collaborative works were executed on canvas, but in their later collaborations after Brueghel had returned to Antwerp they typically used copper. After Brueghel's return to Antwerp, their collaboration practice was for Brueghel to send the coppers with the landscape to Rottenhammer in Venice, who painted in the figures and then returned the coppers. In a few instances, the process was the other way around.Hans Rottenhammer and Jan Brueghel at Dorotheum Brueghel and Rottenhammer did not only collaborate on landscape paintings with figures. The artists jointly created one of the earliest devotional garland paintings, made for Cardinal Federico Borromeo, depicting a Virgin and Child surrounded by a flower garland (Pinacoteca Ambrosiana).Van Hogendorp Prosperetti, 2009, p. 109 The Return from War: Mars Disarmed by Venus, with Rubens While in his collaborations with Hans Rottenhammer, the landscapes were made by Brueghel, the roles were reversed when he worked with Joos de Momper as it was Brueghel who provided the figures to the landscapes painted by de Momper. An example of their collaboration is A Hermit before a Grotto (c. 1616, Liechtenstein Museum). There are about 59 known collaborations between Brueghel and de Momper making de Momper his most frequent collaborator.Jan Brueghel I & Joos de Momper II, A Coastal Landscape with Fishermen with their Catch by a Ruined Tower Hendrick van Balen the Elder was another regular collaborator with Jan Brueghel. Their collaboration was simplified by the fact that from 1604 onwards both painters had moved to the Lange Nieuwstraat, which made it easier to carry the panels and copper plates on which they collaborated back and forth. Another frequent collaborator of Jan Brueghel was Rubens. The two artists executed about 25 joint works in the period from 1598 to 1625. Their first collaboration was on The Battle of the Amazons (c. 1598-1600, Sanssouci Picture Gallery). The artists worked together in the development of the genre of the devotional garland painting with works such as the Madonna in a Floral Wreath (c. 1616-1618, Alte Pinakothek). They further jointly made mythological scenes and an allegorical series representing the Five Senses. The collaboration between the two friends was remarkable because they worked in very different styles and specializations and were artists of equal status. They were able to preserve the individuality of their respective styles in these joint works. Paradise with the Fall of Man, with Rubens Brueghel appears to have been the principal initiator of their joint works, which were made principally during the second half of the 1610s when their method of collaboration had become more systemised and included Rubens' workshop. Usually it would be Brueghel who started a painting and he would leave space for Rubens to add the figures.Anne T. Woollett et al., 2006, pp. 3‚Äì4 In their early collaborations they seem to have made major corrections to the work of the other. For instance, in the early collaborative effort The Return from War: Mars Disarmed by Venus Rubens overpainted most of the lower-right corner with gray paint so he could enlarge his figures. In later collaborations the artists seem to have streamlined their collaboration and agreed on the composition early on so that these later works show little underdrawing.Alex de Voogt and Kees Hommes, The signature of leadership - artistic freedom in shared leadership practice, in: The John Ben Sheppard Journal of Practical Leadership, 1(2):1‚Äì5. As court painters to the archdukes their collaborations reflected the court's desire to emphasise the continuity of its reign with the previous Burgundian and Habsburg rulers as well as the rulers' piousness. While they were mindful of the prevailing tastes in courtly circles, which favoured themes such as the hunt, the two artists were creative in their response to the court's preferences by devising new iconography and genres, such as the devotional garland paintings, which were equally capable of conveying the devoutness and splendor of the archducal court. The joint artistic output of Brueghel and Rubens was highly prized by collectors all over Europe. =Ideological context= Studies of animals Jan Brueghel's work reflects the various ideological currents at work in the Catholic Spanish Netherlands during his lifetime. The Catholic Counter-Reformation's worldview played an important role in the artist's practice. Central in this worldview was the belief that the earth and its inhabitants were revelations of God. Artistic representation of, and scientific investigation into, that divine revelation was encouraged and valued. Breughel's friend and patron, the Counter-Reformation Cardinal Federico Borromeo, particularly emphasized the beauty and diversity of the animal world. In his I tre libri delle laudi divine (published only posthumously in 1632) Borromeo wrote: 'Looking then with attentive study at animals' construction and formation, and at their parts, members, and characters, can it not be said how excellently divine wisdom has demonstrated the value of its great works?' Jan Brueghel's realistic depictions of nature in all its various forms, in flowers, landscapes, animals, etc., was clearly in line with the view that study of god's creation was an important source for knowing god. The Castle of Mariemont Brueghel's era also saw a growing interest in the study of nature through empirical evidence as opposed to relying on inherited tradition. The increased access to new animals and exotic plants from the newly discovered territories played an important role in this intellectual exploration. This resulted in the appearance of the first scholarly catalogues and encyclopedias, including the illustrated natural history catalogues of 16th- century naturalists Conrad Gesner and Ulisse Aldrovandi. Their major contribution to natural history was the creation of an extensive system of description of each animal. Gesner placed all the species within four general categories: quadrupeds, birds, fish and serpents. He described animals in alphabetical order and in terms of nomenclature, geographic origins, mode of living and behavior. Aldrovandi took another approach and did not order animals alphabetically. He relied on visual resemblance as the classifying factor. For example, he grouped the horse together with analogous animals, such as the donkey and mule, and separated species into categories, such as birds with webbed feet and nocturnal birds. The Senses of Hearing, Touch and Taste Brueghel's works reflect this contemporary encyclopedic interest in the classification and ordering of all of the natural world. This is evidenced in his flower pieces, landscapes, allegorical works and gallery paintings. In his paradise landscapes, for instance, Brueghel grouped most of the species according to their basic categories of biological classification, in other words, according to the main groups of related species that resemble one another, such as birds or quadrupeds. He further classified most of them into subdivisions consisting of similar morphological and behavioral characteristics. His paradise landscapes thus constituted a visual catalogue of animals and birds which fulfilled the role of micro-encyclopedia. Brueghel's endeavor to represent the world through ordering and classifying its many elements based on empirical observation did not stop with the natural world. In Prague he had acquired knowledge of the large collections of Emperor Rudolf II, which were divided in natural, artificial and scientific objects. Brueghel's allegorical paintings of the four elements and of the five senses reveal the same classifying obsession, using each element or sense to organize natural, man-made instruments and scientific objects. In this skillful union of the areas of art, science, and nature Brueghel demonstrates his mastery of these various disciplines. His paintings serve the same purpose to that of encyclopedic collections by linking between the mundus sensibilis and the mundus intelligibilis. His approach to describing and cataloguing nature in art resembles the distinction natural historians were starting to make between perceptual experience and theoretical knowledge. Flower Vase Brueghel's obsession with classifying the world was completely in line with the encyclopedic tastes of the court in Brussels as is demonstrated by their large art collection of predominantly Flemish paintings, menagerie of exotic species and extensive library. =Flower paintings= Jan Brueghel the Elder was one of the first artists in the Habsburg Netherlands who started to paint pure flower still lifes. A pure flower still life depicts flowers, typically arranged in a vase or other vessel, as the principal subject of the picture, rather than as a subordinate part of another work such as a history painting.Jan Brueghel the Elder, Still life of flowers in a stoneware vase at Sotheby's Jan Brueghel is regarded as an important contributor to the emerging genre of the flower piece in Northern art, a contribution that was already appreciated in his time when he received the nickname 'Flower Brueghel'. While the traditional interpretation of these flower pieces was that they were vanitas symbols or allegories of transience with hidden meanings, it is now more common to interpret them as mere depictions of the natural world.Jan Brueghel, Flowers in a Ceramic Vase at Art & ArchitectureJan Brueghel, 'Still life with irises, tulips, roses, narcissi and fritillary in a ceramic vase at Sotheby's Brueghel's approach to these works was informed by his desire to display his skill in giving a realistic, almost scientific rendering of nature. These works reflected the ideological concerns demonstrated in his work, which combined the worldview that nature was a revelation of a god with the interest in gaining a scientific understanding of nature. Flowers in a Ceramic Vase, Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp Starting with Brueghel 17th century flower still lifes are dominated by the floral arrangements, which are placed against a neutral dark background or a plain setting of a stone niche. Minor details such insects, butterflies, snails and separate sprays of flowers or rosemary may occasionally be added but are subordinate to the principal subject. While Brueghel sought out very rare flowers, he used certain common blooms such as tulips, irises and roses to anchor his bouquets. This may have been a response to his patrons' wishes as well as compositional considerations. His bouquets were typically composed of flowers blooming in different seasons of the year so they could never have been painted together directly from nature. Brueghel was in the habit of traveling to make drawings of flowers that were not available in Antwerp, so that he could paint them into his bouquets. Brueghel rendered the flowers with an almost scientific precision. He arranged each flower with hardly any overlap so that they are shown off to their best advantage, and many are shown at different angles. The flowers are arranged by size with smaller ones at the bottom of the bouquet, larger flowers such as tulips, cornflowers, peonies and guelder roses in the centre and large flowers, such as white lilies and blue irises, at the top of the bouquet. This arrangement is clear in the Flowers in a Ceramic Vase (c. 1620, Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp). The vase in which the flowers are arranged is decorated with motifs in relief. The two cartouches - separated by a fantastic figure - show Amphitrite, a sea goddess from Greek mythology, on the left, and Ceres, the Roman corn goddess, on the right. These two goddesses were typically used in allegorical representations of the four elements to symbolise water and earth respectively. The other two cartouches on that part of the vase that is invisible likely show Vulcan, who was associated with fire, and Apollo, who was associated with air. The occurrence of the four elements and the flowers in a single work can be interpreted as the emanation of the macrocosm in the microcosm.Jan Brueghel I, Jan Breughel II, Bloemen in een vaas at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp) Madonna in a Floral Wreath, with Rubens Brueghel often repeated motifs in his flower pieces. Even so, he was able to give each work a remarkable freshness and vitality of its own. =Garland paintings= Jan Brueghel the Elder played a key role in the invention and development of the genre of garland paintings. Garland paintings typically show a flower garland around a devotional image or portrait. Together with Hendrick van Balen, he painted around 1607-1608 the first known garland painting for Italian cardinal Federico Borromeo, a passionate art collector and Catholic reformer. Borromeo requested the painting to respond to the destruction of images of the Virgin in the preceding century and it thus combined both the cardinal's interests in Catholic reform and the arts. Brueghel, the still life specialist, painted the flower garland, while van Balen, a specialist figure painter, was responsible for the image of the Virgin.Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012 Garland of Fruit surrounding a Depiction of Cybele Receiving Gifts from Personifications of the Four Seasons The genre of garland paintings was inspired by the cult of veneration and devotion to Mary prevalent at the Habsburg court (then the rulers over the Habsburg Netherlands) and in Antwerp generally. The genre was initially connected to the visual imagery of the Counter-Reformation movement.David Freedberg, \\"The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion\\", M√ºnchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, xxxii, 1981, pp. 115‚Äì150. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter. Brueghel's collaborators on garland paintings included Rubens, Frans Francken the Younger and Pieter van Avont. An example of a collaborative garland painting made by Jan Brueghel the Elder and Rubens is the Madonna in Floral Wreath (1621, Alte Pinakothek). An example of a collaborative garland painting he made with Hendrick van Balen is the Garland of Fruit surrounding a Depiction of a Goddess Receiving Gifts from Personifications of the Four Seasons of which there are two versions, one in the Belfius collection and a second in the Mauritshuis in The Hague.A very similar composition (possibly a workshop copy) is in the collection of the Prado. Both versions are considered to be autograph paintings, but small differences between the two suggest that the panel in the Belfius collection is the original version. The medallion in the centre is traditionally believed to depict Cybele, the ancient Phrygian goddess of the earth and nature as it was described as such in 1774 when it was catalogued in the collection of William V, Prince of Orange in The Hague.Jan Brueghel (I) and Hendrick van Balen (I), Garland of Fruit surrounding a Depiction of Cybele Receiving Gifts from Personifications of the Four Seasons, ca. 1620-1622 at the Netherlands Institute for Art History More recently an identification of the goddess with Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture, grain crops, fertility and motherly relationships, has been proposed. The reason is that the goddess in the medallion has none of the attributes traditionally connected with Cybele. Around the medallion is suspended a garland of flowers, vegetables and fruit ‚Äì a tribute to the goddess and an ode to plenty and fertility. Van Balen painted the medallion while Brueghel painted the abundant garland, the surrounding figures and the numerous animals.Garland of Fruit surrounding a Depiction of Cybele Receiving Gifts from Personifications of the Four Seasons in the Mauritshuis =Landscapes= River landscape Jan Brueghel's father, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, is regarded as an important innovator of landscape art. By introducing greater naturalism in his Alpine mountain settings, his father had expanded on the world landscape tradition that had been founded mainly by Joachim Patinir. Some of Pieter the Elder's works also foreshadowed the forest landscape that would start to dominate landscape painting around the turn of the 16th century. Pieter the Elder also developed the village and rural landscape, placing Flemish hamlets and farms in exotic prospects of mountains and river valleys.Larry Silver, 2012, p. 162 Jan developed on the formula he learned from his father of arranging country figures traveling a road, which recedes into the distance. He emphasized the recession into space by carefully diminishing the scale of figures in the foreground, middle-ground, and far distance. To further the sense of atmospheric perspective, he used varying tones of brown, green, and blue progressively to characterize the recession of space. His landscapes with their vast depth are balanced through his attention to the peasant figures and their humble activities in the foreground.A Woodland Road with Travelers at the Metropolitan Museum of Art A wooded landscape with travelers on a path Like his father, Jan Brueghel also painted various village landscapes. He used the surrounding landscapes as the stage for the crowds of anecdotal, colorfully dressed peasants who engage in various activities in the market, the country roads and during the rowdy kermesses. Jan Brueghel's landscape paintings with their strong narrative elements and attention to detail had a significant influence on Flemish and Dutch landscape artists in the second decade of the 17th century. His river views were certainly known to painters working in Haarlem, including Esaias van de Velde and Willem Buytewech, whom Brueghel may have met there when he accompanied Peter Paul Rubens on a diplomatic mission to the Dutch Republic in 1613.Brueghel the Elder, Jan, River Landscape, 1607 at the National Gallery of Art Forest landscape Jan Brueghel was along with artists such as Gillis van Coninxloo one of the prime developers of the dense forest landscape in the 17th century. Jan Breughel in fact experimented with such works before Coninxloo's first dated wooded landscape of 1598. In his forest landscapes Brueghel depicted heavily wooded glades in which he captured the verdant density, and even mystery, of the forest. Although on occasion inhabited by humans and animals, these forest scenes contain dark recesses, virtually no open sky and no outlet for the eye to penetrate beyond the thick trees.Jan Breughel I (Brussels 1568-1625 Antwerp), Hunters with hounds by a stream in a wooded landscape at Christie's =Paradise landscapes= Jan Brueghel invented the 'paradise landscape', a subgenre that involved a combination of landscape and animal painting. Works in this genre are typically crawling with numerous animals from exotic and native European species who coexist harmoniously in a lush landscape setting. These landscapes are inspired by episodes from Genesis, the chapter of the bible, which tells the story of the creation of the world and of man. The favorite themes taken from Genesis where the creation of man, Adam and Eve in paradise, the fall of man and the entry of the animals in Noah's ark. The entry of the animals into Noah's ark Like his flower pieces, these landscapes were informed by the Catholic Counter- Reformation's worldview, which regarded earth and its inhabitants as revelations of a god and valued artistic representation of, and scientific investigation into, that divine revelation. As described above, Breughel's friend and patron, the Counter-Reformation Cardinal Federico Borromeo, had particularly emphasized the beauty and diversity of the animal world. Brueghel tried to render this worldview in his paradise landscapes. The novelty of Brueghel's paradise landscapes lies not only in the impressive variety of animals, which the artist studied mainly from life but also in their presentation as both figures of a religious narrative and as subjects of a scientific order. The Garden of Eden with the Fall of Man Brueghel developed his earliest paradise landscapes during his stay in Venice in the early 1590s. His first paradise landscape known as The Garden of Eden with the Fall of Man is now in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery in Rome. The reference to Genesis in the picture appears in a small vignette representing the creation of Man in the background, but the main focus is on the animals and the landscape itself. This work was the first paradise landscape in which Brueghel 'catalogued' animals and depicts common and domesticated types. Brueghel's interest in the cataloguing of animals was stimulated by his visit to the court of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor in Prague. The emperor had established an encyclopedic collection of rarities and animals. While in his early paradise landscapes Brueghel seems to have based some of his renderings of the animals on works by other artists, he later could rely on studies from life of the various species in the menagerie of the court in Brussels.Kolb, 2005, pp. 47‚Äì60 Brueghel had also seen Albrecht D√ºrer's depiction of animals during his visit to Prague and had made a painted copy of D√ºrer's watercolor The Madonna with a Multitude of Animals (1503). D√ºrer's representations of animals play a pivotal role in Renaissance zoology, since they are the purest artistic form of nature study. The studies of animals by Flemish artists Hans Bol and Joris Hoefnagel also had an important influence on Brueghel. In particular Hoefnagel's Four Elements (1575-1582) was the first artistic work to categorize animals in a book format. Hoefnagel's approach to the representation of the animal world combined natural historical, classical, emblematic, and biblical references, which incorporated the various species into the categories of the four elements of the cosmos: earth, water, air, and fire. Brueghel's paradise landscapes also embodied the encyclopedic attitudes of his time by depicting a wide variety of species.Kolb, 2005, pp. 33‚Äì40 Brueghel continued refining his treatment of the subject of paradise landscapes throughout his career. The many renderings and variations of the paradise landscape produced by Brueghel earned him the nickname Paradise Brueghel. =Allegorical paintings= Allegory of Fire: Venus in the Forge of Vulcan Jan Brueghel the Elder produced various sets of allegorical paintings, in particular on the themes of the Five senses and the Four Elements. These paintings were often collaborations with other painters such as is the case with the five paintings representing the Five senses on which Brueghel and Rubens collaborated and which are now in the Prado Museum in Madrid. He also collaborated with Hendrick van Balen on various allegorical compositions such as a series on the Four Elements as well as an Allegory of Public Welfare (Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest). In his allegories Jan Breughel illustrated an abstract concept, such as one of the senses or one of the four elements through a multitude of concrete objects that can be associated with it. He thus represented a concept by means of descriptive tropes. Brueghel resorted in these allegorical compositions to the encyclopedic imagery that he also displayed in his paradise landscapes. This is demonstrated in his composition Allegory of Fire; Venus in the Forge of Vulcan of which there are various versions of which one (Doria Pamphilj Gallery, Rome) is a collaboration with Hendrick van Balen and another (Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, Milan) is attributed to Jan Brueghel alone. Brueghel's encyclopedic approach in this composition offers such detail that historians of science have relied on the composition as a source of information on the types of tools used in 17th century metallurgical practice.Van Hogendorp Prosperetti, 2009, p. 73 =Scenes of hell and demons= Aeneas and the Sibyl in the Underworld Jan was early on nicknamed 'Hell Brueghel' but by the 19th century that name had become erroneously associated with his brother Pieter the Younger. Jan Brueghel was given the nickname because of his scenes with demons and hell scenes. An example is the Temptation of St. Anthony (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), which reprises a subject first explored by Hieronymus Bosch. In this demon-plagued scene the monsters are seen attacking the small saint in the corner of a large and dense forest landscape, rather than within the expanded panoramas of Patinir.Larry Silver, 2012, p. 158 Jan Brueghel is believed to have produced his hell scenes for a newer, elite audience of learned and sophisticated collectors. To appeal to this erudite clientele he often populated the hell scenes with mythological rather than religious subjects, in particular the Vergilian scene of Aeneas in Hades, escorted by the Cumaean Sibyl. An example is Aeneas and the Sibyl in the Underworld (1619, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). Other mythological themes appearing in his hell scenes included the image of Juno visiting Hades and Orpheus in the Underworld from Ovid's Metamorphoses. An example of the latter is Orpheus in the Underworld (Palazzo Pitti). In these compositions brightly colored monsters provide the 'recreational terror' of the later manifestations of Boschian design.Larry Silver, 2012, pp. 158‚Äì159 Brueghel's hell scenes were influential and Jacob van Swanenburg, one of Rembrandt's teachers, was inspired by them to create his own hell scenes.Amy Golahny, Rembrandt's Reading: The Artist's Bookshelf of Ancient Poetry and History, Amsterdam University Press, 2003, pp. 59‚Äì64 =Gallery paintings= Jan Brueghel the Elder and Frans Francken the Younger were the first artists to create paintings of art and curiosity collections in the 1620s. Gallery paintings depict large rooms in which many paintings and other precious items are displayed in elegant surroundings. These rooms were often referred to as Kunstkammern (\\"art rooms\\") or Wunderkammern (\\"wonder rooms\\"). The earliest works in this genre depicted art objects together with other items such as scientific instruments or peculiar natural specimens. Some gallery paintings include portraits of the owners or collectors of the art objects or artists at work. The paintings are heavy with symbolism and allegory and are a reflection of the intellectual preoccupations of the age, including the cultivation of personal virtue and the importance of connoisseurship.Marr, Alexander (2010) 'The Flemish 'Pictures of Collections' Genre: An Overview', Intellectual History Review, 20: 1, 5‚Äì25 The genre became immediately quite popular and was followed by other artists such as Jan Brueghel the Younger, Cornelis de Baellieur, Hans Jordaens, David Teniers the Younger, Gillis van Tilborch and Hieronymus Janssens. The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting the Collection of Pieter Roose A famous example of a gallery painting by Jan Brueghel is The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting a Collector's Cabinet (now referred to as The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting the Collection of Pieter Roose) (c. 1621-1623, Walters Art Museum, Baltimore). The work is believed to be a collaboration between Jan Brueghel the Elder and Hieronymus Francken II. This gallery painting represents the early phase of the genre of collector's cabinets. During this early 'encyclopaedic' phase, the genre reflected the culture of curiosity of that time, when art works, scientific instruments, naturalia and artificialia were equally the object of study and admiration. As a result, the cabinets depicted in these compositions are populated by persons who appear to be as interested in discussing scientific instruments as in admiring paintings. Later the genre concentrated more on galleries solely containing works of art. The compositions depicted in The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting a Collector's Cabinet are predominantly allegories of iconoclasm and the victory of painting (art) over ignorance. They are references to the iconoclasm of the Beeldenstorm that had raged in the Low Countries in the 16th century and the victory over the iconoclasts during the reign of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella who jointly ruled the Spanish Netherlands in the beginning of the 17th century.Adriaen van Stalbent, Las Ciencias y las Artes at the PradoJames Simpson, Under the Hammer: Iconoclasm in the Anglo-American Tradition, Oxford University Press, 2010 Jan Brueghel was responsible for the large vase of flowers, which is crowned by a large sunflower. This South American flower, which could grow very tall and would turn towards the sun, was first seen by Europeans in the mid-1500s. It had been illustrated as a New World wonder in botanical treatises, but Jan Brueghel was the first to include the flower in a painting and use it as a symbol of princely patronage in this composition. By turning toward Albert and Isabella (taking the position of the sun), the sunflower symbolizes the way that the arts were able to grow and blossom in the light and warmth of princely patronage.The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting the Collection of Pierre Roose at Walters Art Museum =Singeries= Breughel contributed to the development of the genre of the 'monkey scene', also called 'singerie' (a word, which in French means a 'comical grimace, behaviour or trick').'Singerie' in Larousse online Comical scenes with monkeys appearing in human attire and a human environment are a pictorial genre that was initiated in Flemish painting in the 16th century and was subsequently further developed in the 17th century.Bert Schepers, Monkey Madness in Seventeenth- Century Antwerp, in: The Rubenianum Quarterly, 2012 2, p. 5 Monkeys were regarded as shameless and impish creatures and excellent imitators of human behaviour. These depictions of monkeys enacting various human roles were a playful metaphor for all the folly in the world.Jan Brueghel I, Monkeys feasting (singerie) at the Rubenshuis Monkeys feasting The Flemish engraver Pieter van der Borcht introduced the singerie as an independent theme around 1575 in a series of prints, which were strongly embedded in the artistic tradition of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. These prints were widely disseminated and the theme was then picked up by other Flemish artists. The first one to do so was the Antwerp artist Frans Francken the Younger, who was quickly followed by Jan Brueghel the Elder, the Younger, Sebastiaen Vrancx and Jan van Kessel the Elder. Jan Brueghel the Elder's son-in-law David Teniers the Younger became the principal practitioner of the genre and developed it further with his younger brother Abraham Teniers. Later in the 17th century Nicolaes van Verendael started to paint these 'monkey scenes' as well. An example of a singerie by Jan Brueghel is the Monkeys feasting, which dates from his early years as an artist (private collection, on long-term loan to the Rubenshuis, Antwerp). This painting on copper was probably one of the first examples of a singerie painting. Jan Brueghel likely drew his monkeys in the zoo of the Archdukes in Brussels. While the composition shows the monkeys engaged in all kinds of mischief, it includes a painting above the door jamb, which is a work from Rubens' studio, called \\"Ceres and Pan\\".

Jan Brueghel (also Bruegel or Breughel) the Younger (, ; ; 13 September 1601 ‚Äì 1 September 1678) was a Flemish Baroque painter, and the son of Jan Brueghel the Elder. Life Brueghel was born and died in the 17th century in Antwerp. He was trained by his father and spent his career producing works in a similar style. Along with his brother Ambrosius, he produced landscapes, allegorical scenes and other works of meticulous detail. Brueghel also copied works by his father and sold them with his father's signature. His work is distinguishable from that of his parent by being less well executed and lighter. Jan the Younger was traveling in Italy when his father died of cholera, and swiftly returned to take control of the Antwerp studio. After the death of his father he changed his signature from 'Brueghel' to 'Breughel'.Jan Brueghel (II) in the RKD The next year in 1626 he married Anna-Maria Janssens, daughter of Abraham Janssens. He soon established himself and was made dean of the Guild of Saint Luke in 1630. That same year he was commissioned by the French court to paint Adam Cycle. In the following years, he also produced paintings for the Austrian court, and worked independently in Paris, before returning to Antwerp in 1657. He collaborated with a number of prominent artists including Rubens, Hendrick van Balen (1575‚Äì1632), Adriaen Stalbemt (1580‚Äì1682), Lucas Van Uden (1596‚Äì1672), his brother-in-law David Teniers the Younger (1610-1690) and his father-in-law Abraham Janssens. Legacy Jan the Younger's best works are his extensive landscapes, either under his own name or made for other artists such as Hendrick van Balen as backgrounds. His pupils were his older sons Abraham, Philips and Jan Peeter, his nephew Jan van Kessel, and his younger brother Ambrosius. Jan the Younger has fifteen paintings in National public collections in the United Kingdom. In an episode of BBC's Britain's Lost Masterpieces broadcast in November 2019, a very badly damaged picture of a village scene, whose panel has spilt into two pieces, was located at Birmingham Art Gallery. Following a complete restoration by Simon Gillespie, the landscape was attributed to Joos de Momper and the figures were attributed to Jan the Younger.

The crash was attributed to several factors, including market saturation in the number of game consoles and available games as well as waning interest in console games in favor of personal computers. Revenues peaked at around $3.2 billion in 1983, then fell to around $100 million by 1985 (a drop of almost 97 percent). The crash abruptly ended what is retrospectively considered the second generation of console video gaming in North America. Lasting about two years, the crash shook the then-booming industry, and it led to the bankruptcy of several companies producing home computers and video game consoles in the region. Analysts of the time expressed doubts about the long-term viability of video game consoles and software. The North American video game console industry recovered a few years later, mostly due to the widespread success of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1986; Nintendo designed the NES as the Western branding for its Famicom console (originally released in 1983) to avoid the missteps which caused the 1983 crash and the stigma which video games had at that time.  Causes and factors  alt= = Flooded console market = The Atari Video Computer System (renamed the Atari 2600 in late 1982) was not the first home system with swappable game cartridges, but by the early 1980s it was the most popular second-generation console by a wide margin. Already coming off the video game crash of 1977 due to a flooded market of home Pong console clones, the Atari VCS was launched in 1977 with modest sales for its first few years. In 1980, Atari's licensed version of Space Invaders from Taito became the console's killer application; sales of the VCS quadrupled, and the game was the first title to sell more than a million copies. Spurred by the success of the Atari VCS, other consoles were introduced, both from Atari and other companies: Odyssey¬≤, Intellivision, ColecoVision, Atari 5200, and Vectrex. Coleco sold an add-on allowing Atari 2600 games to be played on its ColecoVision. Each of the new consoles had its own library of games produced by the console maker, and the Atari 2600 had a large library of games produced by third-party developers. In 1982, analysts noticed trends of saturation, mentioning that the amount of new software coming in will only allow a few big hits, that retailers had too much floor space for systems, and that price drops for home computers could result in an industry shakeup.Jones, Robert S. (December 12, 1982). \\"Home Video Games Are Coming Under a Strong Attack\\". Gainesville Sun. Retrieved from https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&dat;=19821212&id;=L2tWAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=q-kDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1609,4274079&hl;=en In addition, the rapid growth of the videogame industry led to an increased demand for video games, but which the manufacturers over-projected. An analyst for Goldman Sachs stated in 1983 that the demand for video games was up 100% from 1982, but the manufacturing output increased by 175%, creating a surplus in the market. Raymond Kassar, the CEO of Atari, recognized in 1982 that there would become a point of saturation for the industry, but did not expect this to occur until about half of American households had a video game console; the crash occurred when about 15 million machines had been sold, below this expected point. = Loss of publishing control = Prior to 1979, there were no third-party developers; console manufacturers like Atari made their own games for their own systems. This changed with the formation of Activision in 1979. Activision was founded by four Atari programmers who left the company because Atari did not allow credits to appear on their games and did not pay employees a royalty based on sales. At the time, Atari was owned by Warner Communications, and the developers felt that they ought to receive the same recognition that musicians, directors, and actors did from Warner's other divisions. The four programmers, having knowledge of the Atari VCS system already, were able to build on that to develop their own games and cartridge manufacturing processes. After Activision went into business, Atari quickly sued to block sales of Activision's products, but failed to secure a restraining order and ultimately settled the case in 1982, with Activision agreeing to pay royalties to Atari but otherwise legitimizing the third-party model. Activision games were as popular as Atari's, with Pitfall! in 1982 drawing over four million units sold. Prior to 1982, only a few third-party developers besides Activision were making games for the Atari VCS. These included Imagic, Games by Apollo, Coleco, Parker Brothers, CBS Video Games, and Mattel. By 1982, Activision's success led numerous other companies to join them. However, Activision's founder David Crane observed that several of these companies were supported by venture capitalists attempting to emulate the success of Activision, not only for the Atari VCS but other consoles, and relied on inexperienced computer programmers. Without the experience that Crane and his team had, many of these games were of poor quality, with Crane describing them as \\"the worst games you can imagine\\". Companies lured away each other's programmers or used reverse engineering to learn how to make games for proprietary systems. Atari even hired several programmers from Mattel's Intellivision development studio, prompting a lawsuit by Mattel against Atari that included charges of industrial espionage. The rapid growth of the third-party game industry was evident by the number of vendors present at the semi-annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). Crane recalled that during the six months between two consecutive CES events, the number of third-party developers jumped from 3 to 30. At the Summer 1982 CES there were 17 companies, including MCA Inc., and Fox Video Games announced 90 new Atari games. By 1983, an estimated 100 companies were vying to get a foothold in the video game market via the CES. AtariAge documented 158 different vendors that had developed for the Atari VCS. In the second half of 1982 the number of cartridges grew from 100 in June to more than 400 in December. Experts predicted a glut in 1983, with 10% of games producing 75% of sales. BYTE stated in December that \\"in 1982 few games broke new ground in either design or format ... If the public really likes an idea, it is milked for all it's worth, and numerous clones of a different color soon crowd the shelves. That is, until the public stops buying or something better comes along. Companies who believe that microcomputer games are the hula hoop of the 1980s only want to play Quick Profit.\\" Bill Kunkel said in January 1983 that companies had \\"licensed everything that moves, walks, crawls, or tunnels beneath the earth. You have to wonder how tenuous the connection will be between the game and the movie Marathon Man. What are you going to do, present a video game root canal?\\" By September 1983 the Phoenix stated that 2600 cartridges \\"is no longer a growth industry\\". Activision, Atari, and Mattel all had experienced programmers, but many of the new companies rushing to join the market did not have the expertise or talent to create quality games. Titles such as Ralston Purina's dog food-themed Chase the Chuckwagon, the Kaboom!-like Lost Luggage, rock band tie-in Journey Escape, and plate-spinning game Dishaster, were examples of games made in the hopes of taking advantage of the video-game boom, but later proved unsuccessful with retailers and potential customers. = Lack of consumer confidence = Up to 1982, Atari was considered the dominant company in the home video game industry, but during that year, the company took several missteps that caused the market and consumers to lose confidence in the company and in turn the video game industry as a whole. One factor was around certain games Atari chose to publish, as by this point, with the company owned by Warner Communication, it was more focused on business opportunities rather than innovation. Many of its executives were MBAs, and looked for any business opportunity that would give them an edge over other third-party game publishers. Atari had had past success with its licenses of arcade hits ported to the Atari VCS, but also had begun to look for other lucrative licensing opportunities that they could differentiate themselves from other companies. Two games released in 1982, often cited as major contributors to the crash, were part of the factors that contributed to weakening Atari's consumer confidence: Pac-Man, and E.T. the Extra- Terrestrial. The Atari VCS port of the arcade hit Pac-Man was released in March 1982 and was critically panned, with its graphics cited as particularly poor. While some vendors canceled orders, most of the large retailers continued to sell the game, and Atari sold seven million units in 1982. Still, the quality issues hurt the Atari brand and led some consumers to ask for refunds. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was developed by Howard Scott Warshaw in only six weeks under rush orders at Atari's direction to meet the sales for the 1982 Christmas season after Atari had secured the rights to the film for about . Atari anticipated about four million units to be sold, but the quality of the game due to the time constraints stalled sales, and a reported 3.5 million units were returned back to Atari. The combined impact of the poor quality of Pac-Man and E.T. reflected on Atari as it caused consumers to become wary of the company's future products, leading to a slowdown in sales entering 1983. Atari attempted to improve future arcade and licensed game ports to draw back consumers, such as the Ms. Pac-Man port which was more positively received by critics. However, they were not able to capture similar sales numbers as before 1982. = Competition from home computers = The Commodore 64 survived the crash and went on to become one of the best selling computers of all time. Inexpensive home computers had been first introduced in 1977, and by 1979, Atari unveiled the Atari 400 and 800 computers, built around a chipset originally meant for use in a game console, and which retailed for the same price as their respective names. In 1981, IBM introduced the IBM 5150 PC with a $1,565 base price (), while Sinclair Research introduced its low-end ZX81 microcomputer for ¬£70 (). By 1982, new desktop computer designs were commonly providing better color graphics and sound than game consoles and personal computer sales were booming. The TI 99/4A and the Atari 400 were both at $349 (), the Tandy Color Computer sold at $379 (), and Commodore International had just reduced the price of the VIC-20 to $199 () and the C64 to $499 ().Ahl, David H. (1984 November). The first decade of personal computing . Creative Computing, vol. 10, no. 11: p. 30. Because computers generally had more memory and faster processors than a console, they permitted more sophisticated games. A 1984 compendium of reviews of Atari 8-bit software used 198 pages for games compared to 167 for all other software types. Home computers could also be used for tasks such as word processing and home accounting. Games were easier to distribute, since they could be sold on floppy disks or cassette tapes instead of ROM cartridges. This opened the field to a cottage industry of third-party software developers. Writeable storage media allowed players to save games in progress, a useful feature for increasingly complex games which was not available on the consoles of the era. In 1982, a price war that began between Commodore and Texas Instruments led to home computers becoming as inexpensive as video-game consoles; after Commodore cut the retail price of the 64 to $300 in June 1983, some stores began selling it for as little as $199. Dan Gutman, founder in 1982 of Video Games Player magazine in an article in 1987, recalled in 1983 that \\"People asked themselves, 'Why should I buy a video game system when I can buy a computer that will play games and do so much more?'\\" The Boston Phoenix stated in September 1983 about the cancellation of the Intellivision III, \\"Who was going to pay $200-plus for a machine that could only play games?\\" Commodore explicitly targeted video game players. Spokesman William Shatner asked in VIC-20 commercials \\"Why buy just a video game from Atari or Intellivision?\\", stating that \\"unlike games, it has a real computer keyboard\\" yet \\"plays great games too\\". Commodore's ownership of chip fabricator MOS Technology allowed manufacture of integrated circuits in-house, so the VIC-20 and C64 sold for much lower prices than competing home computers. \\"I've been in retailing 30 years and I have never seen any category of goods get on a self-destruct pattern like this\\", a Service Merchandise executive told The New York Times in June 1983. The price war was so severe that in September Coleco CEO Arnold Greenberg welcomed rumors of an IBM 'Peanut' home computer because although IBM was a competitor, it \\"is a company that knows how to make money\\". \\"I look back a year or two in the videogame field, or the home-computer field\\", Greenberg added, \\"how much better everyone was, when most people were making money, rather than very few\\". Companies reduced production in the middle of the year because of weak demand even as prices remained low, causing shortages as sales suddenly rose during the Christmas season; only the Commodore 64 was widely available, with an estimated more than 500,000 computers sold during Christmas. The 99/4A was such a disaster for TI, that the company's stock immediately rose by 25% after the company discontinued it and exited the home- computer market in late 1983. JC Penney announced in December 1983 that it would soon no longer sell home computers, because of the combination of low supply and low prices. By that year, Gutman wrote, \\"Video games were officially dead and computers were hot\\". He renamed his magazine Computer Games in October 1983, but \\"I noticed that the word games became a dirty word in the press. We started replacing it with simulations as often as possible\\". Soon \\"The computer slump began ... Suddenly, everyone was saying that the home computer was a fad, just another hula hoop\\". Computer Games published its last issue in late 1984. In 1988, Computer Gaming World founder Russell Sipe noted that \\"the arcade game crash of 1984 took down the majority of the computer game magazines with it.\\" He stated that, by \\"the winter of 1984, only a few computer game magazines remained,\\" and by the summer of 1985, Computer Gaming World \\"was the only 4-color computer game magazine left.\\"http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_50.pdf#page=7  Result  = Immediate effects = The release of so many new games in 1982 flooded the market. Most stores had insufficient space to carry new games and consoles. As stores tried to return the surplus games to the new publishers, the publishers had neither new products nor cash to issue refunds to the retailers. Many publishers, including Games by Apollo and US Games, quickly folded. Unable to return the unsold games to defunct publishers, stores marked down the titles and placed them in discount bins and sale tables. Recently released games which initially sold for US$35 (equivalent to $92 in 2018) were in bins for $5 ($13 in 2018). The presence of third-party sales drew the market share that the console manufacturers had. Atari's share of the cartridge-game market fell from 75% in 1981 to less than 40% in 1982, which negatively affected their finances. The bargain sales of poor-quality titles further drew sales away from the more successful third-party companies like Activision due to uneducated consumers being drawn by price to purchase the bargain titles rather than quality. By June 1983, the market for the more expensive games had shrunk dramatically and was replaced by a new market of rushed-to-market, low-budget games. Crane said that \\"those awful games flooded the market at huge discounts, and ruined the video game business\\". A massive industry shakeout resulted. Magnavox abandoned the video game business entirely. Imagic withdrew its IPO the day before its stock was to go public; the company later collapsed. Activision, to stay competitive and maintain financial security, began development of games for the personal computer. Within a few years, Activision no longer produced cartridge-based games and focused solely on personal computer games. Centipede, and other Atari materials can be seen. Atari was one of those companies most affected by the crash. As a company, its revenues dropped significantly due to dramatically lower sales and cost of returned stock. By mid-1983, the company had lost and was forced to layoff 3,000 of its 10,000 worker staff. Unsold Pac-Man, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and other 1982 and 1983 games and consoles started to fill their warehouses. In September 1983, Atari discreetly buried much of this excess stock in a landfill near Alamogordo, New Mexico, though Atari did not comment about their activity at the time. Misinformation related to sales of Pac-Man and E.T. led to an urban legend of the Atari video game burial that millions of unsold cartridges were buried there. Gaming historians received permission to dig up the landfill as part of a documentary in 2014, during which former Atari executive James Heller, who had overseen the original burial clarified that only about 728,000 cartridges had been buried in 1982, backed by estimates made during the excavation, and disproving the scale of the urban legend. Atari's burial remains an iconic representation of the 1983 video game crash. By the end of 1983, Atari had over in losses, leading to Warner Communication to sell Atari to Jack Tramiel of Commodore International in July 1984, which directed Atari's efforts into developing their personal computer line, the Atari ST, over the console business. Lack of confidence in the video game sector caused many retailers to stop selling video game consoles or reduced their stock significantly, reserving floor or shelf space for other products. This was the most formidable barrier that confronted Nintendo, as it tried to market its Famicom system in the United States. Retailer opposition to video games was directly responsible for causing Nintendo to brand its product an \\"Entertainment System\\" rather than a \\"console\\", using terms such as \\"control deck\\" and \\"Game Pak\\", as well as producing a toy robot called R.O.B. to convince toy retailers to allow it in their stores. Furthermore, the design for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) used a front-loading cartridge slot to mimic how videocassette recorders, popular at that time, were loaded, further pulling the NES away from previous console designs. The crash also affected video game arcades, which had had several years of a golden age since the introduction of Space Invaders in 1978 but was waning by 1982 due to the expansion of home consoles, the lack of novel games, and undue attention to teenage delinquency around video game arcades. While the number of arcades in the United States had doubled to 10,000 from 1980 to 1982, the crash led to a closure of around 1,500 arcades, and revenues of those that remained open had fallen by 40%. The full effects of the industry crash were not felt until 1985. Despite Atari's claim of 1 million in sales of its 2600 game system that year, recovery was slow. The sales of home video games had dropped from $3.2 billion in 1982 to $100 million in 1985. Analysts doubted the long-term viability of the video game industry, but following the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System, the industry began recovering, with annual sales exceeding $2.3 billion by 1988, with 70% of the market dominated by Nintendo. In 1986, Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi noted that \\"Atari collapsed because they gave too much freedom to third-party developers and the market was swamped with rubbish games\\". In response, Nintendo limited the number of titles that third-party developers could release for their system each year, and promoted its \\"Seal of Quality\\", which it allowed to be used on games and peripherals by publishers that met Nintendo's quality standards. The end of the crash allowed Commodore to raise the price of the C64 for the first time upon the June 1986 introduction of the Commodore 64c‚Äîa Commodore 64 redesigned for lower cost of manufacture‚Äîwhich Compute! cited as the end of the home-computer price war, one of the causes of the crash. = Long-term effects = The crash in 1983 had the largest impact in the United States, and rippled through all sectors of the global video game market worldwide, though sales of video games still remained strong in Japan, Europe, and Canada from the beleaguered American companies. It took several years for the U.S. industry to recover. The estimated market in 1982, including consoles, arcade, and personal computer games, dropped to by 1985, with a significant shift away from arcades and consoles to personal computer software in the years that followed. Japanese dominance The U.S. video game crash had two long-lasting results. The first result was that dominance in the home console market shifted from the United States to Japan. The crash did not directly affect the financial viability of the video game market in Japan, but it still came as a surprise there and created repercussions that changed that industry, and thus became known as the \\"Atari shock\\". As the crash was happening in the United States, Japan's game industry started to shift its attention from arcade games to home consoles. Within one month in 1983, three new home consoles were released in Japan: the Nintendo Famicom (two years later released in Western markets as Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)), Sega's SG-1000, and Microsoft Japan's MSX hybrid computer-console system, all heralding the third generation of home consoles. These three consoles were extremely popular, buoyed by an economic bubble in Japan. The units readily outsold Atari and Mattel's existing systems, and with both Atari and Mattel focusing on recovering domestic sales, the Japanese consoles effectively went uncontested over the next few years. By 1986, three years after its introduction, 6.5 million Japanese homes‚Äî19% of the population‚Äîowned a Famicom, and Nintendo began exporting it to the U.S., where the home console industry was only just recovering from the crash. By 1987 the Nintendo Entertainment System was very popular in North America. By the time the U.S. video game market recovered in the late 1980s, the NES was by far the dominant console in the United States, leaving only a fraction of the market to a resurgent Atari. By 1989, home video game sales in the United States had reached $5 billion, surpassing the 1982 peak of $3 billion during the previous generation. A large majority of the market was controlled by Nintendo; it sold more than 35 million units in the United States, exceeding the sales of other consoles and personal computers by a considerable margin. Other Japanese companies also rivaled Nintendo's success in the United States, with Sega's Mega Drive/Genesis in 1989 and NEC's PC Engine/TurboGrafx 16 released the same year. Impact on third-party software development A second, highly visible result of the crash was the advancement of measures to control third-party development of software. Using secrecy to combat industrial espionage had failed to stop rival companies from reverse engineering the Mattel and Atari systems and hiring away their trained game programmers. While Mattel and Coleco implemented lockout measures to control third-party development (the ColecoVision BIOS checked for a copyright string on power-up), the Atari 2600 was completely unprotected and once information on its hardware became available, little prevented anyone from making games for the system. Nintendo thus instituted a strict licensing policy for the NES that included equipping the cartridge and console with lockout chips, which were region-specific, and had to match in order for a game to work. In addition to preventing the use of unlicensed games, it also was designed to combat software piracy, rarely a problem in North America or Western Europe, but rampant in East Asia. Accolade achieved a technical victory in one court case against Sega, challenging this control, even though it ultimately yielded and signed the Sega licensing agreement. Several publishers, notably Tengen (Atari), Color Dreams, and Camerica, challenged Nintendo's control system during the 8-bit era by producing unlicensed NES games. The concepts of such a control system remain in use on every major video game console produced today, even with fewer \\"cartridge-based\\" consoles on the market than in the 8/16-bit era. Replacing the security chips in most modern consoles are specially encoded optical discs that cannot be copied by most users and can only be read by a particular console under normal circumstances. Nintendo limited most third-party publishers to only five games per year on its systems (some companies tried to get around this by creating additional company labels like Konami's Ultra Games label); Nintendo ultimately dropped this rule by 1993 with the release of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It also required all cartridges to be manufactured by Nintendo, and to be paid for in full before they were manufactured. Cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo, so publishers assumed all the financial risk of selling all units ordered. As a result, some publishers lost more money due to distress sales of remaining inventory at the end of the NES era than they ever earned in profits from sales of the games. Nintendo portrayed these measures as intended to protect the public against poor-quality games, and placed a golden seal of approval on all licensed games released for the system. Further, Nintendo implemented its proprietary 10NES, a lockout chip which was designed to prevent cartridges made without the chip from being played on the NES. The 10NES lockout was not perfect, as later in the NES's lifecycle methods were found to bypass it, but it did sufficiently allow Nintendo to strengthen its publishing control to avoid the mistakes Atari had made. These strict licensing measures backfired somewhat after Nintendo was accused of antitrust behavior. In the long run, this pushed many western third-party publishers such as Electronic Arts away from Nintendo consoles and supported competing consoles such as the Sega Genesis or Sony PlayStation. Most of the Nintendo platform-control measures were adopted by later console manufacturers such as Sega, Sony, and Microsoft, although not as stringently. Computer game growth With waning console interests in the United States, the computer game market was able to gain a strong foothold in 1983 and beyond. Developers that had been primarily in the console games space, like Activision, turned their attention to developing computer game titles to stay viable. Newer companies also were founded to capture the growing interest in the computer games space with novel elements that borrowed from console games, as well as taking advantage of low-cost dial-up modems that allowed for multiplayer capabilities.

Profile =First Fat Tony= \\"Fat Tony\\" D'Amico was behind several of Springfield's criminal enterprises. His rackets included illegal gambling, cigarette smuggling, and bootlegging. In \\"The Twisted World of Marge Simpson\\", Homer contracts with the mafia to drive out Marge's rival snack food distributors. Fat Tony took out a hit on Mayor Quimby in \\"Mayored to the Mob\\" in retaliation for a raid on their rat milk facility, which Quimby opposed, as they had promised him \\"dog or higher\\". Fat Tony puts out a contract on Homer after his private security business interferes with the mob's interests in \\"Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge\\". Homer would have been executed gangland-style if not for Maggie coming to the rescue with her rifle. Fat Tony's son Michael is first mentioned by Fat Tony as he is talking to Marge in \\"The Seven-Beer Snitch\\", saying she drove him home from school sometimes. He is then properly introduced in the episode \\"The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer\\". The episode also reveals that Fat Tony's wife \\"was whacked by 'natural causes'.\\" Fat Tony and his associates meet in what is known as the \\"Legitimate Businessman's Social Club\\". Fat Tony played the violin in \\"Insane Clown Poppy\\". Fat Tony dies in the twenty-second season episode \\"Donnie Fatso\\" from a heart attack with his final words to Homer being \\"I loved you man.\\" =Second Fat Tony= When the original Fat Tony died of a heart attack in \\"Donnie Fatso,\\" he was replaced by his slimmer cousin Anthony Paul \\"Fit Tony\\" D'Amico. By the end of that episode, Fit Tony has taken to eating as a way of dealing with the stress of assassination attempts. His weight gain causes a change of nickname to \\"Fit-Fat Tony\\" and eventually \\"Fat Tony\\", essentially restoring the original character. In \\"The Real Housewives of Fat Tony\\", he supposedly marries Selma, but the relationship falls apart when Selma discovers Tony only held a ceremony to make her his goomar as he is already married to another woman. Name Fat Tony's visual appearance was modeled after actor Paul Sorvino. Fat Tony's actual name is the source of some dispute, as several different real names have been revealed over the course of the series. In the third-season episode \\"Bart the Murderer\\", Fat Tony is referred to in a news report given by Kent Brockman as William \\"Fat Tony\\" Williams, presumably an alias. In the eighth-season episode \\"The Homer They Fall\\", the announcer at Homer's boxing match against Drederick Tatum refers to Fat Tony as Anthony D'Amico (incidentally the name of one of the three Re- Recording Mixers in the end credits), which he is called later as well, for example, by the FBI. In the twelfth-season episode \\"Insane Clown Poppy\\", Frankie the Squealer claims that Fat Tony's first name is Marion, a reference to actor John Wayne's real name, Marion Robert Morrison.(2009). Commentary for \\"Insane Clown Poppy\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Character =Development= Joe Mantegna was cast as Fat Tony because Sheldon Leonard was unavailable. Fat Tony first appeared in the third season episode \\"Bart the Murderer\\". The writers conceived the episode before the film Goodfellas, which has a similar plot, was released. However, when it was, the writers incorporated references to the film in the episode. Fat Tony was modeled on Paul Sorvino, who played mobster Paul Cicero in Goodfellas. The appearance of Louie, one of Tony's henchmen, was based on another Goodfellas actor, Frank Sivero.Moore, Rich (2003). Commentary for \\"Bart the Murderer\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The end of the episode portrays a TV movie about the events depicted in the episode, in which Joe Mantegna will play Fat Tony (this was before it was decided that Fat Tony would be a recurring character). In the episode Donnie Fatso, Fat Tony dies of a heart attack; his cousin Fit Tony takes his place as head of the syndicate, but soon becomes known as Fat Tony due to stress-induced overeating. =Voice= The writers originally wanted Sheldon Leonard to voice Fat Tony. When they were unable to get him, they went with Joe Mantegna. It is his longest-running role. Mantegna commented, \\"you feel honored that they asked you to do a voice. The fact that they bring you back and keep writing for the character, it is very satisfying.\\" Mantegna based his raspy voice for Fat Tony on his Uncle Willy,Mantegna, Joe (2009). Commentary for \\"Insane Clown Poppy\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. a long-standing cigarette smoker. He insists to the producers to \\"not let anyone else do his noises.\\", even going so far as to say 'If Fat Tony sneezes, I want to be there.\\" and voicing him in the Season 20 episode \\"Sex, Pies, and Idiot Scrapes, where all script called for was a couple of grunts. Despite this, Phil Hartman voiced the character in the Season 7 episode A Fish Called Selma.Goldblum, Jeff; Oakley, Bill; Silverman, David; Weinstein, Josh (2005). Commentary for \\"A Fish Called Selma\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Mantegna voiced Fat Tony in a scene in The Simpsons Movie that almost got cut.Anderson, Mike B.; Moore, Rich; Moore, Steven Dean; Silverman, David (2007). Director's commentary, The Simpsons Movie [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Of the Fat Tony episodes, Mantegna favors \\"Bart the Murderer\\" and \\"The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer\\", because it was the season premiere. Reception IGN ranked Fat Tony at No. 18 on their 2006 list of the \\"Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters\\". Star News Online listed Joe Mantegna as one of the 400 reasons why they love The Simpsons. In 2007, Adam Finley of TV Squad called Mantegna one of the five best The Simpsons guest stars and Vanity Fair called \\"Bart the Murderer\\" the eighth best episode of the show, saying, \\"This episode makes the cut because of the inspired Mafia satire\\". Playmates Toys made Fat Tony into an action figure as part of the World of Springfield toy line.

He was a central figure of 20th-century British music, with a range of works including opera, other vocal music, orchestral and chamber pieces. His best-known works include the opera Peter Grimes (1945), the War Requiem (1962) and the orchestral showpiece The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945). Born in Lowestoft, Suffolk, the son of a dentist, Britten showed talent from an early age. He studied at the Royal College of Music in London and privately with the composer Frank Bridge. Britten first came to public attention with the a cappella choral work A Boy was Born in 1934. With the premiere of Peter Grimes in 1945, he leapt to international fame. Over the next 28 years, he wrote 14 more operas, establishing himself as one of the leading 20th-century composers in the genre. In addition to large-scale operas for Sadler's Wells and Covent Garden, he wrote chamber operas for small forces, suitable for performance in venues of modest size. Among the best known of these is The Turn of the Screw (1954). Recurring themes in his operas include the struggle of an outsider against a hostile society and the corruption of innocence. Britten's other works range from orchestral to choral, solo vocal, chamber and instrumental as well as film music. He took a great interest in writing music for children and amateur performers, including the opera Noye's Fludde, a Missa Brevis, and the song collection Friday Afternoons. He often composed with particular performers in mind. His most frequent and important muse was his personal and professional partner, the tenor Peter Pears; others included Kathleen Ferrier, Jennifer Vyvyan, Janet Baker, Dennis Brain, Julian Bream, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Mstislav Rostropovich. Britten was a celebrated pianist and conductor, performing many of his own works in concert and on record. He also performed and recorded works by others, such as Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, Mozart symphonies, and song cycles by Schubert and Schumann. Together with Pears and the librettist and producer Eric Crozier, Britten founded the annual Aldeburgh Festival in 1948, and he was responsible for the creation of Snape Maltings concert hall in 1967. In his last year, he was the first composer to be given a life peerage. Life and career =Early years= Britten's birthplace in Lowestoft, which was the Britten family home for over twenty years Britten was born in the fishing port of Lowestoft in Suffolk, on the east coast of England on 22 November 1913, the feast day of Saint Cecilia. He was the youngest of four children of Robert Victor Britten (1877‚Äì1934) and his wife Edith Rhoda, n√©e Hockey (1874‚Äì1937). Robert Britten's youthful ambition to become a farmer had been thwarted by lack of capital, and he had instead trained as a dentist, a profession he practised successfully but without pleasure. While studying at Charing Cross Hospital in London he met Edith Hockey, the daughter of a civil service clerk in the British Government's Home Office. They were married in September 1901 at St John's, Smith Square, London. The consensus among biographers of Britten is that his father was a loving but somewhat stern and remote parent.; ; ; and Britten, according to his sister Beth, \\"got on well with him and shared his wry sense of humour, dedication to work and capacity for taking pains\\". Edith Britten was a talented amateur musician and secretary of the Lowestoft Musical Society.; and In the English provinces of the early 20th century, distinctions of social class were taken very seriously. Britten described his family as \\"very ordinary middle class\\", but there were aspects of the Brittens that were not ordinary: Edith's father was illegitimate, and her mother was an alcoholic; Robert Britten was an agnostic and refused to attend church on Sundays. Music was the principal means by which Edith Britten strove to maintain the family's social standing, inviting the pillars of the local community to musical soir√©es at the house. When Britten was three months old he contracted pneumonia and nearly died. The illness left him with a damaged heart, and doctors warned his parents that he would probably never be able to lead a normal life. He recovered more fully than expected, and as a boy was a keen tennis player and cricketer.; and To his mother's great delight he was an outstandingly musical child, unlike his sisters, who inherited their father's indifference to music, while his brother, though musically talented, was interested only in ragtime. Edith gave the young Britten his first lessons in piano and notation. He made his first attempts at composition when he was five. He started piano lessons when he was seven years old, and three years later began to play the viola. He was one of the last composers brought up on exclusively live music: his father refused to have a gramophone or, later, a radio in the house. =Education= Lowestoft When he was seven Britten was sent to a dame school, run by the Misses Astle. The younger sister, Ethel, gave him piano lessons; in later life he said that he remained grateful for the excellence of her teaching. The following year he moved on to a prep school, South Lodge, Lowestoft, as a day boy. The headmaster, Thomas Sewell, was an old-fashioned disciplinarian; the young Britten was outraged at the severe corporal punishments frequently handed out, and later he said that his lifelong pacifism probably had its roots in his reaction to the regime at the school. He himself rarely fell foul of Sewell, a mathematician, in which subject Britten was a star pupil. The school had no musical tradition, and Britten continued to study the piano with Ethel Astle. From the age of ten he took viola lessons from a friend of his mother, Audrey Alston, who had been a professional player before her marriage. In his spare time he composed prolifically. When his Simple Symphony, based on these juvenilia, was recorded in 1956, Britten wrote this pen-portrait of his young self for the sleeve note: Frank Bridge, Britten's teacher Audrey Alston encouraged Britten to go to symphony concerts in Norwich. At one of these, during the triennial Norfolk and Norwich Festival in October 1924, he heard Frank Bridge's orchestral poem The Sea, conducted by the composer. It was the first substantial piece of modern music he had ever encountered, and he was, in his own phrase, \\"knocked sideways\\" by it.Lara Feigel, Alexandra Harris eds, Modernism on Sea: Art and Culture at the British Seaside; accessed 3 September 2013 Audrey Alston was a friend of Bridge; when he returned to Norwich for the next festival in 1927 she brought her not quite 14-year-old pupil to meet him. Bridge was impressed with the boy, and after they had gone through some of Britten's compositions together he invited him to come to London to take lessons from him. Robert Britten, supported by Thomas Sewell, doubted the wisdom of pursuing a composing career; a compromise was agreed by which Britten would, as planned, go on to his public school the following year but would make regular day-trips to London to study composition with Bridge and piano with his colleague Harold Samuel. Bridge impressed on Britten the importance of scrupulous attention to the technical craft of composing and the maxim that \\"you should find yourself and be true to what you found.\\"Mitchell (2004) The earliest substantial works Britten composed while studying with Bridge are the String Quartet in F, completed in April 1928, and the Quatre Chansons Fran√ßaises, a song-cycle for high voice and orchestra. Authorities differ on the extent of Bridge's influence on his pupil's technique. Humphrey Carpenter and Michael Oliver judge that Britten's abilities as an orchestrator were essentially self-taught; and Donald Mitchell considers that Bridge had an important influence on the cycle. Public school and Royal College of Music Mahler, Ireland, Shostakovich, Stravinsky In September 1928 Britten went as a boarder to Gresham's School, in Holt, Norfolk. At the time he felt unhappy there, even writing in his diary of contemplating suicide or running away: he hated being separated from his family, most particularly from his mother; he despised the music master; and he was shocked at the prevalence of bullying, though he was not the target of it. He remained there for two years and in 1930, he won a composition scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London; his examiners were the composers John Ireland and Ralph Vaughan Williams and the college's harmony and counterpoint teacher, S P Waddington. Britten was at the RCM from 1930 to 1933, studying composition with Ireland and piano with Arthur Benjamin. He won the Sullivan Prize for composition, the Cobbett Prize for chamber music, and was twice winner of the Ernest Farrar Prize for composition. Despite these honours, he was not greatly impressed by the establishment: he found his fellow-students \\"amateurish and folksy\\" and the staff \\"inclined to suspect technical brilliance of being superficial and insincere\\". Another Ireland pupil, the composer Humphrey Searle, said that Ireland could be \\"an inspiring teacher to those on his own wavelength\\"; Britten was not, and learned little from him.Cole, Hugo. \\"Review ‚Äì Britten\\", Tempo, New Series, No 78, Autumn 1966, pp. 31‚Äì32 He continued to study privately with Bridge, although he later praised Ireland for \\"nurs[ing] me very gently through a very, very difficult musical adolescence\\". Britten also used his time in London to attend concerts and become better acquainted with the music of Stravinsky, Shostakovich and, most particularly, Mahler. He intended postgraduate study in Vienna with Alban Berg, Arnold Schoenberg's student, but was eventually dissuaded by his parents, on the advice of the RCM staff. The first of Britten's compositions to attract wide attention were composed while at the RCM: the Sinfonietta, Op. 1 (1932), the oboe quartet Phantasy, Op. 2, dedicated to L√©on Goossens who played the first performance in a BBC broadcast on 6 August 1933, and a set of choral variations A Boy was Born, written in 1933 for the BBC Singers, who first performed it the following year. In this same period he wrote Friday Afternoons, a collection of 12 songs for the pupils of Clive House School, Prestatyn, where his brother was headmaster. =Early professional life= In February 1935, at Bridge's instigation, Britten was invited to a job interview by the BBC's director of music Adrian Boult and his assistant Edward Clark. Britten was not enthusiastic about the prospect of working full-time in the BBC music department and was relieved when what came out of the interview was an invitation to write the score for a documentary film, The King's Stamp, directed by Alberto Cavalcanti for the GPO Film Unit. W. H. Auden in 1939 Britten became a member of the film unit's small group of regular contributors, another of whom was W. H. Auden. Together they worked on the documentary films Coal Face and Night Mail in 1935. They also collaborated on the song cycle Our Hunting Fathers (1936), radical both in politics and musical treatment, and subsequently other works including Cabaret Songs, On This Island, Paul Bunyan and Hymn to St Cecilia. Auden was a considerable influence on Britten, encouraging him to widen his aesthetic, intellectual and political horizons, and also to come to terms with his homosexuality. Auden was, as David Matthews puts it, \\"cheerfully and guiltlessly promiscuous\\"; Britten, puritanical and conventional by nature, was sexually repressed. In the three years from 1935 to 1937 Britten wrote nearly 40 scores for the theatre, cinema and radio.White, Eric Walter. \\"Britten in the Theatre: A Provisional Catalogue\\", Tempo, New Series, No 107, December 1973, pp. 2‚Äì10 Among the film music of the late 1930s Matthews singles out Night Mail and Love from a Stranger (1937); from the theatre music he selects for mention The Ascent of F6 (1936), On the Frontier (1938), and Johnson Over Jordan (1939); and of the music for radio, King Arthur (1937) and The Sword in the Stone (1939). In 1937 there were two events of huge importance in Britten's life: his mother died, and he met the tenor Peter Pears. Although Britten was extraordinarily devoted to his mother and was devastated at her death, it also seems to have been something of a liberation for him.; and Only after that did he begin to engage in emotional relationships with people his own age or younger. Later in the year he got to know Pears while they were both helping to clear out the country cottage of a mutual friend who had died in an air crash. Pears quickly became Britten's musical inspiration and close (though for the moment platonic) friend. Britten's first work for him was composed within weeks of their meeting, a setting of Emily Bront√´'s poem, \\"A thousand gleaming fires\\", for tenor and strings. During 1937 Britten composed a Pacifist March to words by Ronald Duncan for the Peace Pledge Union, of which, as a pacifist, he had become an active member; the work was not a success and was soon withdrawn. The best known of his compositions from this period is probably Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge for string orchestra, described by Matthews as the first of Britten's works to become a popular classic. It was a success in North America, with performances in Toronto, New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, under conductors including John Barbirolli and Serge Koussevitzky. =America 1939‚Äì42= In April 1939 Britten and Pears sailed to North America, going first to Canada and then to New York. They had several reasons for leaving England, including the difficult position of pacifists in an increasingly bellicose Europe; the success that Frank Bridge had enjoyed in the US; the departure of Auden and his friend Christopher Isherwood to the US from England three months previously; hostile or belittling reviews of Britten's music in the English press; and under- rehearsed and inadequate performances. Britten and Pears consummated their relationship and from then until Britten's death they were partners in both their professional and personal lives. When the Second World War began, Britten and Pears turned for advice to the British embassy in Washington and were told that they should remain in the US as artistic ambassadors. Pears was inclined to disregard the advice and go back to England; Britten also felt the urge to return, but accepted the embassy's counsel and persuaded Pears to do the same. Already a friend of the composer Aaron Copland, Britten encountered his latest works Billy the Kid and An Outdoor Overture, both of which influenced his own music. In 1940 Britten composed Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo, the first of many song cycles for Pears. Britten's orchestral works from this period include the Violin Concerto and Sinfonia da Requiem. In 1941 Britten produced his first music drama, Paul Bunyan, an operetta, to a libretto by Auden. While in the US, Britten had his first encounter with Balinese gamelan music, through transcriptions for piano duo made by the Canadian composer Colin McPhee. The two met in the summer of 1939 and subsequently performed a number of McPhee's transcriptions for a recording. This musical encounter bore fruit in several Balinese-inspired works later in Britten's career. Moving to the US did not relieve Britten of the nuisance of hostile criticism: although Olin Downes, the doyen of New York music critics, and Irving Kolodin took to Britten's music, Virgil Thomson was, as the music scholar Suzanne Robinson puts it, consistently \\"severe and spiteful\\". Thomson described Les Illuminations (1940) as \\"little more than a series of bromidic and facile 'effects' ... pretentious, banal and utterly disappointing\\", and was equally unflattering about Pears's voice. Robinson surmises that Thomson was motivated by \\"a mixture of spite, national pride, and professional jealousy\\". Paul Bunyan met with wholesale critical disapproval,Brogan, Hugh. \\"W. H. Auden, Benjamin Britten, and Paul Bunyan\\", Journal of American Studies, Volume 32, No 2, August 1998, pp. 281‚Äì282 and the Sinfonia da Requiem (already rejected by its Japanese sponsors because of its overtly Christian nature) received a mixed reception when Barbirolli and the New York Philharmonic premiered it in March 1941. The reputation of the work was much enhanced when Koussevitzky took it up shortly afterwards. =Return to England= Page from \\"Peter Grimes\\" in 1812 edition of Crabbe's The Borough In 1942 Britten read the work of the poet George Crabbe for the first time. The Borough, set on the Suffolk coast close to Britten's homeland, awakened in him such longings for England that he knew he must return. He also knew that he must write an opera based on Crabbe's poem about the fisherman Peter Grimes. Before Britten left the US, Koussevitzky, always generous in encouraging new talent, offered him a $1,000 commission to write the opera. Britten and Pears returned to England in April 1942. During the long transatlantic sea crossing Britten completed the choral works A Ceremony of Carols and Hymn to St Cecilia. The latter was his last large-scale collaboration with Auden. Britten had grown away from him, and Auden became one of the composer's so-called \\"corpses\\" ‚Äì former intimates from whom he completely cut off contact once they had outlived their usefulness to him or offended him in some way. Having arrived in Britain, Britten and Pears applied for recognition as conscientious objectors; Britten was initially allowed only non-combatant service in the military, but on appeal he gained unconditional exemption. After the death of his mother in 1937 he had used money she bequeathed him to buy the Old Mill in Snape, Suffolk which became his country home. He spent much of his time there in 1944 working on the opera Peter Grimes. Pears joined Sadler's Wells Opera Company, whose artistic director, the singer Joan Cross, announced her intention to re-open the company's home base in London with Britten's opera, casting herself and Pears in the leading roles. There were complaints from company members about supposed favouritism and the \\"cacophony\\" of Britten's score, as well as some ill-suppressed homophobic remarks. Peter Grimes opened in June 1945 and was hailed by public and critics;See, for example, \\"Sadler's Wells Opera ‚Äì Peter Grimes\\", The Times, 8 June 1945, p. 6, and Glock, William. \\"Music\\", The Observer, 10 June 1945, p. 2 its box-office takings matched or exceeded those for La boh√®me and Madame Butterfly, which were staged during the same season. The opera administrator Lord Harewood called it \\"the first genuinely successful British opera, Gilbert and Sullivan apart, since Purcell.\\" Dismayed by the in-fighting among the company, Cross, Britten and Pears severed their ties with Sadler's Wells in December 1945, going on to found what was to become the English Opera Group. A month after the opening of Peter Grimes, Britten and Yehudi Menuhin went to Germany to give recitals to concentration camp survivors. What they saw, at Belsen most of all, so shocked Britten that he refused to talk about it until towards the end of his life, when he told Pears that it had coloured everything he had written since. and Colin Matthews comments that the next two works Britten composed after his return, the song-cycle The Holy Sonnets of John Donne and the Second String Quartet, contrast strongly with earlier, lighter-hearted works such as Les Illuminations. Britten recovered his joie de vivre for The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945), written for an educational film, Instruments of the Orchestra, directed by Muir Mathieson and featuring the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Sargent.\\"Instruments of the Orchestra\\" , British Film Institute, accessed 24 May 2013 It became, and remained, his most often played and popular work. Britten's next opera, The Rape of Lucretia, was presented at the first post-war Glyndebourne Festival in 1946. It was then taken on tour to provincial cities under the banner of the \\"Glyndebourne English Opera Company\\", an uneasy alliance of Britten and his associates with John Christie, the autocratic proprietor of Glyndebourne.Hope-Wallace, Philip. \\"Opera at Glyndebourne\\", The Manchester Guardian, 15 July 1946, p. 3; and The tour lost money heavily, and Christie announced that he would underwrite no more tours. Britten and his associates set up the English Opera Group; the librettist Eric Crozier and the designer John Piper joined Britten as artistic directors. The group's express purpose was to produce and commission new English operas and other works, presenting them throughout the country.Wood, Anne. \\"English Opera Group\\", The Times, 12 July 1947, p. 5 Britten wrote the comic opera Albert Herring for the group in 1947; while on tour in the new work Pears came up with the idea of mounting a festival in the small Suffolk seaside town of Aldeburgh, where Britten had moved from Snape earlier in the year, and which became his principal place of residence for the rest of his life.; and =Aldeburgh; the 1950s= The Aldeburgh Festival was launched in June 1948, with Britten, Pears, and Crozier directing. Albert Herring played at the Jubilee Hall, and Britten's new cantata for tenor, chorus, and orchestra, Saint Nicolas, was presented in the parish church. The festival was an immediate success and became an annual event that has continued into the 21st century.Hall, George. \\"Festival Overtures: Britten in Bloom\\", Opera Volume 64.4, April 2013, pp. 436‚Äì438 New works by Britten featured in almost every festival until his death in 1976, including the premieres of his operas A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Jubilee Hall in 1960 and Death in Venice at Snape Maltings Concert Hall in 1973.Mason, Colin. \\"Benjamin Britten's Dream\\", The Guardian, 11 June 1960. p. 5; and Greenfield, Edward. \\"Britten's Death in Venice\\", The Guardian, 18 June 1973, p. 8 John Piper's Benjamin Britten memorial window in the Church of St Peter and St Paul, Aldeburgh Unlike many leading English composers, Britten was not known as a teacher, but in 1949 he accepted his only private pupil, Arthur Oldham, who studied with him for three years. Oldham made himself useful, acting as musical assistant and arranging Variations on a Theme by Frank Bridge for full orchestra for the Frederick Ashton ballet Le R√™ve de L√©onor (1949),\\"Ballets de Paris de Roland Petit ‚Äì Le R√™ve de L√©onor\\", The Times, 27 April 1949, p. 3 but he later described the teacher‚Äìpupil relationship as \\"beneficial five per cent to [Britten] and ninety-five per cent to me!\\" Throughout the 1950s Britten continued to write operas. Billy Budd (1951) was well received at its Covent Garden premiere and was regarded by reviewers as an advance on Peter Grimes.Blom, Eric. \\"Britten's Billy Budd, The Observer, 2 December 1951, p. 6; Hope-Wallace, Philip. \\"Britten's Billy Budd\\", The Manchester Guardian, 3 December 1951, p. 5; and Porter, Andrew. \\"Britten's Billy Budd\\", Music & Letters, Volume 33, No. 2, April 1952, pp. 111‚Äì118 Gloriana (1953), written to mark the coronation of Elizabeth II, had a cool reception at the gala premiere in the presence of the Queen and the British Establishment en masse. The downbeat story of Elizabeth I in her decline, and Britten's score ‚Äì reportedly thought by members of the premiere's audience \\"too modern\\" for such a gala ‚Äì did not overcome what Matthews calls the \\"ingrained philistinism\\" of the ruling classes. Although Gloriana did well at the box office, there were no further productions in Britain for another 13 years.Greenfield, Edward. \\"Gloriana at Sadler's Wells\\", The Guardian, 22 October 1966, p. 6 It was later recognised as one of Britten's finer operas.Christiansen, Rupert. \\"Gloriana: Britten's problem opera\\", The Daily Telegraph 18 June 2013; and Church, Michael. \\"Richard Jones's revelatory ROH revival of Britten's underrated Gloriana\\", The Independent 21 June 2013 The Turn of the Screw the following year was an unqualified success;Mason, Colin. \\"Britten's New Opera at Venice Festival: Welcome for The Turn of the Screw\\", The Manchester Guardian, 15 September 1954, p. 5 together with Peter Grimes it became, and at 2013 remained, one of the two most frequently performed of Britten's operas.\\"Operas, Britten\\", Operabase, accessed 25 May 2013 In the 1950s the \\"fervently anti-homosexual\\" Home Secretary, Sir David Maxwell Fyfe, urged the police to enforce the Victorian laws making homosexual acts illegal. Britten and Pears came under scrutiny; Britten was visited by police officers in 1953 and was so perturbed that he discussed with his assistant Imogen Holst the possibility that Pears might have to enter a sham marriage (with whom is unclear). In the end nothing was done. An increasingly important influence on Britten was the music of the East, an interest that was fostered by a tour there with Pears in 1956, when Britten once again encountered the music of the Balinese gamelan and saw for the first time Japanese Noh plays, which he called \\"some of the most wonderful drama I have ever seen.\\" These eastern influences were seen and heard in the ballet The Prince of the Pagodas (1957) and later in two of the three semi- operatic \\"Parables for Church Performance\\": Curlew River (1964) and The Prodigal Son (1968). =1960s= By the 1960s, the Aldeburgh Festival was outgrowing its customary venues, and plans to build a new concert hall in Aldeburgh were not progressing. When redundant Victorian maltings buildings in the village of Snape, six miles inland, became available for hire, Britten realised that the largest of them could be converted into a concert hall and opera house. The 830-seat Snape Maltings hall was opened by the Queen at the start of the twentieth Aldeburgh Festival on 2 June 1967; it was immediately hailed as one of the best concert halls in the country.Mann, William, \\"Queen opens concert hall\\", The Times, 3 June 1967, p. 7; and Greenfield, Edward, \\"Inaugural Concert at the Maltings, Snape\\", The Guardian, 3 June 1967, p. 7 The hall was destroyed by fire in 1969, but Britten was determined that it would be rebuilt in time for the following year's festival, which it was. The Queen again attended the opening performance in 1970.Greenfield, Edward. \\"Queen at new Maltings concert\\", The Guardian, 6 June 1970, p. 1 Mstislav Rostropovich and Britten, 1964 The Maltings gave the festival a venue that could comfortably house large orchestral works and operas. Britten conducted the first performance outside Russia of Shostakovich's Fourteenth Symphony at Snape in 1970.Mann, William. \\"Shostakovich special\\", The Times, 15 June 1970, p. 10 Shostakovich, a friend since 1960, dedicated the symphony to Britten; he was himself the dedicatee of The Prodigal Son. Two other Russian musicians who were close to Britten and regularly performed at the festival were the pianist Sviatoslav Richter and the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. Britten composed his cello suites, Cello Symphony and Cello Sonata for Rostropovich, who premiered them at the Aldeburgh Festival. One of the best known of Britten's works, the War Requiem, was premiered in 1962. He had been asked four years earlier to write a work for the consecration of the new Coventry Cathedral, a modernist building designed by Basil Spence. The old cathedral had been left in ruins by an air-raid on the city in 1940 in which hundreds of people died. Britten decided that his work would commemorate the dead of both World Wars in a large-scale score for soloists, chorus, chamber ensemble and orchestra. His text interspersed the traditional Requiem Mass with poems by Wilfred Owen. Matthews writes, \\"With the War Requiem Britten reached the apex of his reputation: it was almost universally hailed as a masterpiece.\\" Shostakovich told Rostropovich that he believed it to be \\"the greatest work of the twentieth century\\". In 1967 the BBC commissioned Britten to write an opera specially for television. Owen Wingrave was based, like The Turn of the Screw, on a ghost story by Henry James. By the 1960s Britten found composition much slower than in his prolific youth; he told the 28-year-old composer Nicholas Maw, \\"Get as much done now as you can, because it gets much, much more difficult as you grow older.\\" He did not complete the score of the new opera until August 1970. Owen Wingrave was first broadcast in Britain in May 1971, when it was also televised in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the US and Yugoslavia.Evans, Peter. \\"Britten's Television Opera\\", The Musical Times, Volume 112, No. 1539, May 1971, pp. 425‚Äì428 =Last years= In September 1970 Britten asked Myfanwy Piper, who had adapted the two Henry James stories for him, to turn another prose story into a libretto. This was Thomas Mann's novella Death in Venice, a subject he had been considering for some time. At an early stage in composition Britten was told by his doctors that a heart operation was essential if he was to live for more than two years. He was determined to finish the opera and worked urgently to complete it before going into hospital for surgery. His long-term colleague Colin Graham wrote: After the completion of the opera Britten went into the National Heart Hospital and was operated on in May 1973 to replace a failing heart valve. The replacement was successful, but he suffered a slight stroke, affecting his right hand. This brought his career as a performer to an end. While in hospital Britten became friendly with a senior nursing sister, Rita Thomson; she moved to Aldeburgh in 1974 and looked after him until his death. Britten's last works include the Suite on English Folk Tunes \\"A Time There Was\\" (1974); the Third String Quartet (1975), which drew on material from Death in Venice; and the dramatic cantata Phaedra (1975), written for Janet Baker. In June 1976, the last year of his life, Britten accepted a life peerage ‚Äì the first composer so honoured ‚Äì becoming Baron Britten, of Aldeburgh in the County of Suffolk. After the 1976 Aldeburgh Festival, Britten and Pears travelled to Norway, where Britten began writing Praise We Great Men, for voices and orchestra based on a poem by Edith Sitwell. He returned to Aldeburgh in August, and wrote Welcome Ode for children's choir and orchestra. In November, Britten realised that he could no longer compose. On his 63rd birthday, 22 November, at his request Rita Thomson organised a champagne party and invited his friends and his sisters Barbara and Beth, to say their goodbyes to the dying composer. When Rostropovich made his farewell visit a few days later, Britten gave him what he had written of Praise We Great Men. Britten died of congestive heart failure on 4 December 1976. His funeral service was held at Aldeburgh Parish Church three days later, and he was buried in its churchyard, with a gravestone carved by Reynolds Stone.Powers, Alan. \\"Reynolds Stone: A Centenary Tribute\\", Fine Press Book Association, accessed 27 May 2013 The authorities at Westminster Abbey had offered burial there, but Britten had made it clear that he wished his grave to be side by side with that, in due course, of Pears. A memorial service was held at the Abbey on 10 March 1977, at which the congregation was headed by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.\\"Memorial service: Lord Britten, OM, CH\\", The Times, 11 March 1977, p. 20 Personal life and character Despite his large number of works on Christian themes, Britten has sometimes been thought of as agnostic.; and Pears said that when they met in 1937 he was not sure whether or not Britten would have described himself as a Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union. Physically, Britten was never robust. He walked and swam regularly and kept himself as fit as he could, but Carpenter in his 1992 biography mentions 20 illnesses, a few of them minor but most fairly serious, suffered over the years by Britten before his final heart complaint developed. Emotionally, according to some commentators, Britten never completely grew up, retaining in his outlook something of a child's view of the world.; and Keates, Jonathan. \\"It was boyishness Britten loved as much as boys\\", The Sunday Telegraph, 11 June 2006, accessed 10 June 2016 He was not always confident that he was the genius others declared him to be, and though he was hypercritical of his own works, he was acutely, even aggressively sensitive to criticism from anybody else. Britten was, as he acknowledged, notorious for dumping friends and colleagues who either offended him or ceased to be of use ‚Äì his \\"corpses\\". The conductor Sir Charles Mackerras believed that the term was invented by Lord Harewood. Both Mackerras and Harewood joined the list of corpses, the former for joking that the number of boys in Noye's Fludde must have been a delight to the composer, and the latter for an extramarital affair and subsequent divorce from Lady Harewood, which shocked the puritanical Britten. (Mackerras) and 444‚Äì445 (Harewood). Among other corpses were his librettists Montagu Slater and Eric Crozier. The latter said in 1949, \\"He has sometimes told me, jokingly, that one day I would join the ranks of his 'corpses' and I have always recognized that any ordinary person must soon outlive his usefulness to such a great creative artist as Ben.\\" Dame Janet Baker said in 1981, \\"I think he was quite entitled to take what he wanted from others ... He did not want to hurt anyone, but the task in hand was more important than anything or anybody.\\" Matthews feels that this aspect of Britten has been exaggerated, and he observes that the composer sustained many deep friendships to the end of his life. =Controversies= Boys Throughout his adult life, Britten had a particular rapport with children and enjoyed close friendships with several boys, particularly those in their early teens. The first such friendship was with Piers Dunkerley, 13 years old in 1934 when Britten was aged 20. Other boys Britten befriended were the young David Hemmings and Michael Crawford, both of whom sang treble roles in his works in the 1950s.; and Hemmings later said, \\"In all of the time that I spent with him he never abused that trust\\", and Crawford wrote \\"I cannot say enough about the kindness of that great man ... he had a wonderful patience and affinity with young people. He loved music, and loved youngsters caring about music.\\" It was long suspected by several of Britten's close associates that there was something exceptional about his attraction to teenage boys: Auden referred to Britten's \\"attraction to thin-as-a-board juveniles ... to the sexless and innocent\\", and Pears once wrote to Britten: \\"remember there are lovely things in the world still ‚Äì children, boys, sunshine, the sea, Mozart, you and me\\". In public, the matter was little discussed during Britten's lifetime and much discussed after it. Carpenter's 1992 biography closely examined the evidence, as do later studies of Britten, most particularly John Bridcut's Britten's Children (2006), which concentrates on Britten's friendships and relationships with various children and adolescents. Some commentators have continued to question Britten's conduct, sometimes very sharply.Toronyi-Lalic, Igor. \\"Paul Kildea's erudite biography underplays Benjamin Britten's dark side\\", The Daily Telegraph, 11 February 2013, accessed 11 June 2016; and Morrison, Richard. \\"Crossing the line between affection and abuse\\", The Times, 9 May 2006, accessed 11 June 2016 Carpenter and Bridcut conclude that he held any sexual impulses under firm control and kept the relationships affectionate ‚Äì including bed-sharing, kissing and skinny dipping ‚Äì but strictly platonic.; Miller, Lucasta. \\"Ben and his boys: Britten's obsession with adolescents is sensitively handled\\", The Guardian, 1 July 2006; and Keates, Jonathan. \\"Boyishness as much as boys\\", The Sunday Telegraph, 11 June 2006 Britten's grave in St. Peter and St Paul's Church, Aldeburgh, Suffolk Cause of death A more recent controversy was the statement in a 2013 biography of Britten by Paul Kildea that the composer's heart failure was due to undetected syphilis, which Kildea speculates was a result of Pears's promiscuity while the two were living in New York. In response, Britten's consultant cardiologist said that, like all the hospital's similar cases, Britten was routinely screened for syphilis before the operation, with negative results.Petch, Michael, Opera, April 2013, p. 414. He described as \\"complete rubbish\\" Kildea's allegation that the surgeon who operated on Britten in 1973 would or even could have covered up a syphilitic condition.Higgins, Charlotte. \\"Benjamin Britten syphilis 'extremely unlikely', says cardiologist\\",The Guardian, 22 January 2013 Kildea continued to maintain, \\"When all the composer's symptoms are considered there can be only one cause\\".Kildea, Paul. \\"The evidence does show Britten died from syphilis\\", The Guardian, 30 January 2013 In The Times, Richard Morrison praised the rest of Kildea's book, and hoped that its reputation would not be \\"tarnished by one sensational speculation ... some second-hand hearsay ... presenting unsubstantiated gossip as fact\\".Morrison, Richard. \\"The temptation to settle old scores ‚Äì A centenary biography of Britten should not be judged by just one sensational speculation ‚Äì the rest is fascinating and convincing\\", The Times, 4 February 2013 Music =Influences= Britten's early musical life was dominated by the classical masters; his mother's ambition was for him to become the \\"Fourth B\\" ‚Äì after Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. Britten was later to assert that his initial development as a composer was stifled by reverence for these masters: \\"Between the ages of thirteen and sixteen I knew every note of Beethoven and Brahms. I remember receiving the full score of Fidelio for my fourteenth birthday ... But I think in a sense I never forgave them for having led me astray in my own particular thinking and natural inclinations\\". He developed a particular animosity towards Brahms, whose piano music he had once held in great esteem; in 1952 he confided that he played through all Brahms's music from time to time, \\"to see if I am right about him; I usually find that I underestimated last time how bad it was!\\" Through his association with Frank Bridge, Britten's musical horizons expanded. He discovered the music of Debussy and Ravel which, Matthews writes, \\"gave him a model for an orchestral sound\\". Bridge also led Britten to the music of Schoenberg and Berg; the latter's death in 1935 affected Britten deeply. A letter at that time reveals his thoughts on the contemporary music scene: \\"The real musicians are so few & far between, aren't they? Apart from the Bergs, Stravinskys, Schoenbergs & Bridges one is a bit stumped for names, isn't one?\\" ‚Äì adding, as an afterthought: \\"Shostakovitch ‚Äì perhaps ‚Äì possibly\\". By this time Britten had developed a lasting hostility towards the English Pastoral School represented by Vaughan Williams and Ireland, whose work he compared unfavourably with the \\"brilliant folk-song arrangements of Percy Grainger\\"; Grainger became the inspiration of many of Britten's later folk arrangements.; Britten was also impressed by Delius, and thought Brigg Fair \\"delicious\\" when he heard it in 1931. Also in that year he heard Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which he found \\"bewildering and terrifying\\", yet at the same time \\"incredibly marvellous and arresting\\". The same composer's Symphony of Psalms, and Petrushka were lauded in similar terms. However, he and Stravinsky later developed a mutual antipathy informed by jealousy and mistrust. Besides his growing attachments to the works of 20th century masters, Britten ‚Äì along with his contemporary Michael Tippett ‚Äì was devoted to the English music of the late 17th and early 18th centuries, in particular the work of Purcell. In defining his mission as a composer of opera, Britten wrote: \\"One of my chief aims is to try to restore to the musical setting of the English Language a brilliance, freedom and vitality that have been curiously rare since the death of Purcell\\". Among the closest of Britten's kindred composer spirits ‚Äì even more so than Purcell ‚Äì was Mahler, whose Fourth Symphony Britten heard in September 1930. At that time Mahler's music was little regarded and rarely played in English concert halls. Britten later wrote of how the scoring of this work impressed him: \\"... entirely clean and transparent ... the material was remarkable, and the melodic shapes highly original, with such rhythmic and harmonic tension from beginning to end\\". He soon discovered other Mahler works, in particular Das Lied von der Erde; he wrote to a friend about the concluding \\"Abschied\\" of Das Lied: \\"It is cruel, you know, that music should be so beautiful\\".Letter to Henry Boys, 29 June 1937, quoted in Apart from Mahler's general influence on Britten's compositional style, the incorporation by Britten of popular tunes (as, for example, in Death in Venice) is a direct inheritance from the older composer. =Operas= The Britten-Pears Foundation considers the composer's operas \\"perhaps the most substantial and important part of his compositional legacy.\\"\\"Operas\\" , Britten-Pears Foundation, accessed 26 June 2013 Britten's operas are firmly established in the international repertoire: according to Operabase, they are performed worldwide more than those of any other composer born in the 20th century,List of top composers, Operabase, accessed 28 April 2011. and only Puccini and Richard Strauss come ahead of him if the list is extended to all operas composed after 1900.Britten-Pears Foundation announces Centenary grants(March 2011) Boosey & Hawkes, accessed 11 June 2016. The early operetta Paul Bunyan stands apart from Britten's later operatic works. Philip Brett calls it \\"a patronizing attempt to evoke the spirit of a nation not his own by W. H. Auden in which Britten was a somewhat dazzled accomplice\\". The American public liked it, but the critics did not, and it fell into neglect until interest revived near the end of the composer's life. Peter Pears as the General in Owen Wingrave, 1971 Britten's subsequent operas range from large-scale works written for full- strength opera companies, to chamber operas for performance by small touring opera ensembles or in churches and schools. In the large-scale category are Peter Grimes (1945), Billy Budd (1951), Gloriana (1953), A Midsummer Night's Dream (1960) and Death in Venice (1973). Of the remaining operas, The Rape of Lucretia (1946), Albert Herring (1947), The Little Sweep (1949) and The Turn of the Screw (1954) were written for small opera companies. Noye's Fludde (1958), Curlew River (1964), The Burning Fiery Furnace (1966) and The Prodigal Son (1968) were for church performance, and had their premieres at St Bartholomew's Church, Orford. The secular The Golden Vanity was intended to be performed in schools. Owen Wingrave, written for television, was first presented live by the Royal Opera at Covent Garden in 1973, two years after its broadcast premiere. Music critics have frequently commented on the recurring theme in Britten's operas from Peter Grimes onward of the isolated individual at odds with a hostile society.ODNB; Greenfield, Edward. \\"Inspired genius oblivious to musical fashion\\", The Guardian, 6 December 1976, p. 7; The extent to which this reflected Britten's perception of himself, pacifist and homosexual, in the England of the 1930s, 40s and 50s is debated.; ; and Another recurrent theme is the corruption of innocence, most sharply seen in The Turn of the Screw.The Turn of the Screw, Britten-Pears Foundation, accessed 11 June 2016 Over the 28 years between Peter Grimes and Death in Venice Britten's musical style changed, as he introduced elements of atonalism ‚Äì though remaining essentially a tonal composer ‚Äì and of eastern music, particularly gamelan sounds but also eastern harmonies. In A Midsummer Night's Dream the orchestral scoring varies to fit the nature of each set of characters: \\"the bright, percussive sounds of harps, keyboards and percussion for the fairy world, warm strings and wind for the pairs of lovers, and lower woodwind and brass for the mechanicals\\".\\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\": Programme note Britten-Pears Foundation, accessed 11 June 2018 In Death in Venice Britten turns Tadzio and his family into silent dancers, \\"accompanied by the colourful, glittering sounds of tuned percussion to emphasize their remoteness.\\"\\"Death in Venice\\": Programme note, Britten-Pears Foundation, accessed 11 June 2016 As early as 1948 the music analyst Hans Keller, summarising Britten's impact on 20th-century opera to that date, compared his contribution to that of Mozart in the 18th century: \\"Mozart may in some respects be regarded as a founder (a 'second founder') of opera. The same can already be said today, as far as the modern British ‚Äì perhaps not only British ‚Äì field goes, of Britten\\".Keller, Hans. \\"Britten and Mozart\\", Music & Letters, January 1948, pp. 17‚Äì30 In addition to his own original operas, Britten, together with Imogen Holst, extensively revised Purcell's Dido and Aeneas (1951) and The Fairy-Queen (1967). Britten's Purcell Realizations brought Purcell, who was then neglected, to a wider public, but have themselves been neglected since the dominance of the trend to authentic performance practice. His 1948 revision of The Beggar's Opera amounts to a wholesale recomposition, retaining the original melodies but giving them new, highly sophisticated orchestral accompaniments. =Song cycles= Throughout his career Britten was drawn to the song cycle form. In 1928, when he was 14, he composed an orchestral cycle, Quatre chansons fran√ßaises, setting words by Victor Hugo and Paul Verlaine. Brett comments that though the work is much influenced by Wagner on the one hand and French mannerisms on the other, \\"the diatonic nursery-like tune for the sad boy with the consumptive mother in 'L'enfance' is entirely characteristic\\". After he came under Auden's influence Britten composed Our Hunting Fathers (1936), ostensibly a protest against fox-hunting but which also alludes allegorically to the contemporary political state of Europe. The work has never been popular; in 1948 the critic Colin Mason lamented its neglect and called it one of Britten's greatest works. In Mason's view the cycle is \\"as exciting as Les Illuminations, and offers many interesting and enjoyable foretastes of the best moments of his later works.\\"Mason, Colin. \\"Benjamin Britten\\", The Musical Times, Vol. 89, No. 1261 (March 1948), pp. 73‚Äì75 Blake, Rimbaud, Owen and Verlaine The first of Britten's song cycles to gain widespread popularity was Les Illuminations (1940), for high voice (originally soprano, later more often sung by tenors) with string orchestra accompaniment, setting words by Arthur Rimbaud. Britten's music reflects the eroticism in Rimbaud's poems; Copland commented of the section \\"Antique\\" that he did not know how Britten dared to write the melody. \\"Antique\\" was dedicated to \\"K.H.W.S.\\", or Wulff Scherchen, Britten's first romantic interest. Matthews judges the piece the crowning masterpiece of Britten's early years. By the time of Britten's next cycle, Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo (1942) for tenor and piano, Pears had become his partner and muse; in Matthews's phrase, Britten wrote the cycle as \\"his declaration of love for Peter\\". It too finds the sensuality of the verses it sets, though in its structure it resembles a conventional 19th-century song cycle. Mason draws a distinction between this and Britten's earlier cycles, because here each song is self-contained, and has no thematic connection with any of the others. The Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings (1943) sets verses by a variety of poets, all on the theme of night-time. Though Britten described the cycle as \\"not important stuff, but quite pleasant, I think\\", it was immediately greeted as a masterpiece, and together with Peter Grimes it established him as one of the leading composers of his day. Mason calls it \\"a beautifully unified work on utterly dissimilar poems, held together by the most superficial but most effective, and therefore most suitable symphonic method. Some of the music is pure word-painting, some of it mood-painting, of the subtlest kind.\\"Mason, Colin. \\"Benjamin Britten (continued)\\", The Musical Times, Vol. 89, No. 1262 (April 1948), pp. 107‚Äì110 Two years later, after witnessing the horrors of Belsen, Britten composed The Holy Sonnets of John Donne, a work whose bleakness was not matched until his final tenor and piano cycle a quarter of a century later. Britten's technique in this cycle ranges from atonality in the first song to firm tonality later, with a resolute B major chord at the climax of \\"Death, be not proud\\". Nocturne (1958) is the last of the orchestral cycles. As in the Serenade, Britten set words by a range of poets, who here include Shakespeare, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Tennyson and Wilfred Owen. The whole cycle is darker in tone than the Serenade, with pre-echoes of the War Requiem. All the songs have subtly different orchestrations, with a prominent obbligato part for a different instrument in each. Among Britten's later song cycles with piano accompaniment is the Songs and Proverbs of William Blake, composed for the baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. This presents all its poems in a continuous stream of music; Brett writes that it \\"interleaves a ritornello-like setting of the seven proverbs with seven songs that paint an increasingly sombre picture of human existence.\\" A Pushkin cycle, The Poet's Echo (1965), was written for Galina Vishnevskaya, and shows a more robust and extrovert side of the composer. Though written ostensibly in the tradition of European song cycles, it draws atmospherically on the polyphony of south-east Asian music. Who Are These Children? (1969), setting 12 verses by William Soutar, is among the grimmest of Britten's cycles. After he could no longer play the piano, Britten composed a cycle of Robert Burns settings, A Birthday Hansel (1976), for voice and harp. =Other vocal works= Nicholas Maw said of Britten's vocal music: \\"His feeling for poetry (not only English) and the inflexions of language make him, I think, the greatest musical realizer of English\\". One of the best-known works in which Britten set poetry was the War Requiem (1962). It intersperses the Latin requiem mass, sung by soprano and chorus, with settings of works by the First World War poet Wilfred Owen, sung by tenor and baritone. At the end the two elements are combined, as the last line of Owen's \\"Strange meeting\\" mingles with the In paradisum of the mass. Matthews describes the conclusion of the work as \\"a great wave of benediction [which] recalls the end of the Sinfonia da Requiem, and its similar ebbing away into the sea that symbolises both reconciliation and death.\\" The same year, he composed A Hymn of St Columba for choir and organ, setting a poem by the 6th-century saint. Other works for voices and orchestra include the Missa Brevis and the Cantata academica (both 1959) on religious themes, and the late cantata Phaedra (1975), a story of fated love and death modelled on Handel's Italian cantatas. Smaller-scale works for accompanied voice include the five Canticles, composed between 1947 and 1974. They are written for a variety of voices (tenor in all five; counter-tenor or alto in II and IV and baritone in IV) and accompaniments (piano in I to IV, horn in III and harp in V).\\"Canticle I\\" , \\"Canticle II\\" , \\"Canticle III\\" , \\"Canticle IV\\" , and \\"Canticle V\\" , Britten-Pears Foundation, accessed 30 June 2013 The first is a setting of Francis Quarles's 17th-century poem \\"A Divine Rapture\\", and according to Britten was modelled on Purcell's Divine Hymns. Matthews describes it as one of the composer's most serene works, which \\"ends in a mood of untroubled happiness that would soon become rare in Britten's music\\". The second Canticle was written in 1952, between Billy Budd and Gloriana, on the theme of Abraham's obedience to Divine Authority in the proffered sacrifice of his son Isaac. \\"Canticle III\\" from 1954 is a setting of Edith Sitwell's wartime poem \\"Still Falls the Rain\\", composed just after The Turn of the Screw with which it is structurally and stylistically associated. The twelve-note cycle in the first five bars of the piano part of the Canticle introduced a feature that became thereafter a regular part of Britten's compositional technique. The fourth Canticle, premiered in 1971 is based on T. S. Eliot's poem \\"Journey of the Magi\\". It is musically close to The Burning Fiery Furnace of 1966; Matthews refers to it as a \\"companion piece\\" to the earlier work. The final Canticle was another Eliot setting, his juvenile poem \\"Death of Saint Narcissus\\". Although Britten had little idea of what the poem was about, the musicologist Arnold Whittall finds the text \\"almost frighteningly apt ... for a composer conscious of his own sickness\\". Matthews sees Narcissus as \\"another figure from [Britten's] magic world of dreams and ideal beauty\\". =Orchestral works= The Britten scholar Donald Mitchell has written, \\"It is easy, because of the scope, stature, and sheer volume of the operas, and the wealth of vocal music of all kinds, to pay insufficient attention to the many works Britten wrote in other, specifically non-vocal genres.\\" Maw said of Britten, \\"He is one of the 20th century's great orchestral composers ... His orchestration has an individuality, incisiveness and integration with the musical material only achieved by the greatest composers.\\" Among Britten's best-known orchestral works are the Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge (1937), the Sinfonia da Requiem (1940), the Four Sea Interludes (1945) and The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945). The Variations, an affectionate tribute to Britten's teacher, range from comic parodies of Italian operatic clich√©s and Viennese waltzes to a strutting march, reflecting the rise of militarism in Europe, and a Mahlerian funeral march; the piece ends with an exuberant fugal finale.Richards, Denby (1977). Notes to Chandos CD 8376 The Sinfonia moves from an opening Lacrymosa filled with fear and lamentation to a fierce Dies irae and then to a final Requiem aeternam, described by the critic Herbert Glass as \\"the most uneasy 'eternal rest' possible\\".Glass, Herbert. \\"Sinfonia da Requiem\\" , Los Angeles Philharmonic, accessed 26 June 2013 Mason considers the Sinfonia a failure: \\"less entertaining than usual, because its object is not principally to entertain but to express symphonically. It fails because it is neither picturesquely nor formally symphonic\\". The Sea Interludes, adapted by Britten from the full score of Peter Grimes, make a concert suite depicting the sea and the Borough in which the opera is set; the character of the music is strongly contrasted between \\"Dawn\\", \\"Sunday Morning\\", \\"Moonlight\\" and \\"Storm\\". The commentator Howard Posner observes that there is not a bar in the interludes, no matter how beautiful, that is free of foreboding.Posner, Howard. \\"Four Sea Interludes\\" , Los Angeles Philharmonic, accessed 26 June 2013 The Young Person's Guide, based on a theme by Purcell, showcases the orchestra's individual sections and groups, and gained widespread popularity from the outset. Christopher Headington calls the work \\"exuberant and uncomplicated music, scored with clarity and vigour [that] fits well into Britten's oeuvre.\\" David Matthews calls it \\"a brilliant educational exercise.\\" Unlike his English predecessors such as Elgar and Vaughan Williams, and composers from mainland Europe whom he admired, including Mahler and Shostakovich, Britten was not a classical symphonist. His youthful jeux d'esprit the Simple Symphony (1934) is in conventional symphonic structure, observing sonata form and the traditional four-movement pattern, but of his mature works his Spring Symphony (1949) is more a song cycle than a true symphony, and the concertante Cello Symphony (1963) is an attempt to balance the traditional concerto and symphony. During its four movements the Cello Symphony moves from a deeply pessimistic opening to a finale of radiant happiness rare for Britten by this point. The composer considered it \\"the finest thing I've written\\". The Piano Concerto (1938) was at first criticised for being too light-hearted and virtuoso. In 1945 Britten revised it, replacing a skittish third movement with a more sombre passacaglia that, in Matthews's view, gives the work more depth, and makes the apparent triumph of the finale more ambivalent. The Violin Concerto (1939), finished in the first weeks of the World War, has virtuoso elements, but they are balanced by lyrical and elegiac passages, \\"undoubtedly reflecting Britten's growing concern with the escalation of world hostilities.\\"\\"Britten, Benjamin: Violin Concerto\\", Boosey & Hawkes, accessed 30 June 2013 Neither concerto is among Britten's most popular works, but in the 21st century the Violin Concerto, which is technically difficult, has been performed more frequently than before, both in the concert hall and on record, and has enthusiastic performers and advocates, notably violinist Janine Jansen. Britten's incidental music for theatre, film and radio, much of it unpublished, was the subject of an essay by William Mann, published in 1952 in the first detailed critical assessment of Britten's music to that date. Of these pieces the music for a radio play, The Rescue, by Edward Sackville-West, is praised by the musicologist Lewis Foreman as \\"of such stature and individual character as to be worth a regular place alongside [Britten's] other dramatic scores.\\"Foreman, Lewis. Benjamin Britten and 'The Rescue', Tempo, September 1988, pp. 28‚Äì33 Mann finds in this score pre-echoes of the second act of Billy Budd, while Foreman observes that Britten \\"appears to have made passing allusions to The Rescue in his final opera, Death in Venice. =Chamber and instrumental works= Britten's close friendship with Rostropovich inspired the Cello Sonata (1961) and three suites for solo cello (1964‚Äì71). String quartets featured throughout Britten's composing career, from a student work in 1928 to his Third String Quartet (1975). The Second Quartet, from 1945, was written in homage to Purcell; Mason considered it Britten's most important instrumental work to that date. Referring to this work, Keller writes of the ease with which Britten, relatively early in his compositional career, solves \\"the modern sonata problem ‚Äì the achievement of symmetry and unity within an extended ternary circle based on more than one subject\\". Keller likens the innovatory skill of the Quartet to that of Walton's Viola Concerto.Keller, Hans. \\"Benjamin Britten's Second Quartet\\", Tempo, March 1947, pp. 6‚Äì9 The third Quartet was Britten's last major work; the critic Colin Anderson said of it in 2007, \\"one of Britten's greatest achievements, one with interesting allusions to Bart√≥k and Shostakovich, and written with an economy that opens out a depth of emotion that can be quite chilling.Anderson, Colin, \\"Britten ‚Äì 'Phantasy Quartet'; String Quartet No. 3; Bliss ‚Äì Oboe Quintet\\", Fanfare, March 2007, pp. 87‚Äì88. The Gemini Variations (1965), for flute, violin and piano duet, were based on a theme of Zolt√°n Kod√°ly and written as a virtuoso piece for the 13-year-old Jeney twins, musical prodigies whom Britten had met in Budapest in the previous year. For Osian Ellis, Britten wrote the Suite for Harp (1969), which Joan Chissell in The Times described as \\"a little masterpiece of concentrated fancy\\".Chissell, Joan. \\"Little Masterpieces\\", The Times, 26 June 1976, p. 11 Nocturnal after John Dowland (1963) for solo guitar was written for Julian Bream and has been praised by Benjamin Dwyer for its \\"semantic complexity, prolonged musical argument, and philosophical depth\\". =Legacy= Snape Maltings concert hall, a main venue of the Aldeburgh Festival, founded by Britten, Pears and Crozier Britten's fellow-composers had divided views about him. To Tippett he was \\"simply the most musical person I have ever met\\", with an \\"incredible\\" technical mastery; some contemporaries, however, were less effusive. In Tippett's view, Walton and others were convinced that Britten and Pears were leaders of a homosexual conspiracy in music, a belief Tippett dismisses as ridiculous, inspired by jealousy of Britten's postwar successes. Leonard Bernstein considered Britten \\"a man at odds with the world\\", and said of his music: \\"[I]f you hear it, not just listen to it superficially, you become aware of something very dark\\".Bernstein, in the TV documentary A Time There Was, quoted by The tenor Robert Tear, who was closely associated with Britten in the latter part of the composer's career, made a similar point: \\"There was a great, huge abyss in his soul ... He got into the valley of the shadow of death and couldn't get out\\". In the decade after Britten's death, his standing as a composer in Britain was to some extent overshadowed by that of the still-living Tippett. The film- maker Tony Palmer thought that Tippett's temporary ascendancy might have been a question of the two composers' contrasting personalities: Tippett had more warmth and had made fewer enemies. In any event this was a short-lived phenomenon; Tippett adherents such as the composer Robert Saxton soon rediscovered their enthusiasm for Britten, whose audience steadily increased during the final years of the 20th century. Britten has had few imitators; Brett describes him as \\"inimitable, possessed of ... a voice and sound too dangerous to imitate\\". Nevertheless, after his death Britten was lauded by the younger generation of English composers to whom, in the words of Oliver Knussen, he became \\"a phenomenal father-figure\\". Brett believes that he affected every subsequent British composer to some extent: \\"He is a key figure in the growth of British musical culture in the second half of the 20th century, and his effect on everything from opera to the revitalization of music education is hard to overestimate.\\" Whittall believes that one reason for Britten's enduring popularity is the \\"progressive conservatism\\" of his music. He generally avoided the avant garde, and did not challenge the conventions in the way that contemporaries such as Tippett did. Perhaps, says Brett, \\"the tide that swept away serialism, atonality and most forms of musical modernism and brought in neo-Romanticism, minimalism and other modes of expression involved with tonality carried with it renewed interest in composers who had been out of step with the times\\". Britten defined his mission as a composer in very simple terms: composers should aim at \\"pleasing people today as seriously as we can\\". Pianist and conductor Britten, though a reluctant conductor and a nervous pianist, was greatly sought after in both capacities. The piano accompanist Gerald Moore wrote in his memoirs about playing at all the main music festivals except for Aldeburgh, because \\"as the presiding genius there is the greatest accompanist in the world, my services are not needed\\". Britten's recital partnership with Pears was his best-known collaboration, but he also accompanied Kathleen Ferrier, Rostropovich, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, James Bowman and John Shirley-Quirk, among others. Though usually too nervous to play piano solos, Britten often performed piano duets with Clifford Curzon or Richter, and chamber music with the Amadeus Quartet. The composers whose works, other than his own, he most often played were Mozart and Schubert; the latter, in Murray Perahia's view, was Britten's greatest idol. As a boy and young man, Britten had intensely admired Brahms, but his admiration waned to nothing, and Brahms seldom featured in his repertory. Singers and players admired Britten's conducting, and David Webster rated it highly enough to offer him the musical directorship of the Covent Garden Opera in 1952. Britten declined; he was not confident of his ability as a conductor and was reluctant to spend too much time performing rather than composing. As a conductor, Britten's repertory included Purcell, Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Schubert, and occasional less characteristic choices including Schumann's Scenes from Goethe's Faust; Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius and Introduction and Allegro; Holst's Egdon Heath and short pieces by Percy Grainger.  Recordings  Britten, like Elgar and Walton before him, was signed up by a major British recording company, and performed a considerable proportion of his output on disc. For the Decca Record Company he made some monaural records in the 1940s and 1950s, followed, with the enthusiastic support of the Decca producer John Culshaw, by numerous stereophonic versions of his works.Stuart, Philip. Decca Classical 1929‚Äì2009, accessed 24 May 2013. Culshaw wrote, \\"The happiest hours I have spent in any studio were with Ben, for the basic reason that it did not seem that we were trying to make records or video tapes; we were just trying to make music.\\"Culshaw, John, \\"Ben ‚Äì A Tribute to Benjamin Britten (1913‚Äì1976)\\", Gramophone, February 1977, p. 21 In May 1943 Britten made his debut in the Decca studios, accompanying Sophie Wyss in five of his arrangements of French folk songs. The following January he and Pears recorded together, in Britten's arrangements of British folk songs, and the following day, in duet with Curzon he recorded his Introduction and Rondo alla burlesca and Mazurka elegiaca. In May 1944 he conducted the Boyd Neel string orchestra, Dennis Brain and Pears in the first recording of the Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings, which has frequently been reissued, most recently on CD. Britten's first operatic recording was The Turn of the Screw, made in January 1955 with the original English Opera Group forces. In 1957 he conducted The Prince of the Pagodas in an early stereo recording, supervised by Culshaw. Decca's first major commercial success with Britten came the following year, with Peter Grimes, which has, at 2013, never been out of the catalogues since its first release. From 1958 Britten conducted Decca recordings of many of his operas and vocal and orchestral works, including the Nocturne (1959), the Spring Symphony (1960) and the War Requiem (1963). The last sold in unexpectedly large numbers for a classical set, and thereafter Decca unstintingly made resources available to Culshaw and his successors for Britten recordings. Sets followed of Albert Herring (1964), the Sinfonia da Requiem (1964), Curlew River (1965), A Midsummer Night's Dream (1966), The Burning Fiery Furnace (1967), Billy Budd (1967) and many of the other major works. In 2013, to mark the anniversary of Britten's birth, Decca released a set of 65 CDs and one DVD, \\"Benjamin Britten ‚Äì Complete Works\\". Most of the recordings were from Decca's back catalogue, but in the interests of comprehensiveness a substantial number of tracks were licensed from 20 other companies including EMI, Virgin Classics, Naxos, Warner and NMC.\\"Decca announces first Britten complete works\\" , Britten100, Britten- Pears Foundation, 16 May 2013 As a pianist and conductor in other composers' music, Britten made many recordings for Decca. Among his studio collaborations with Pears are sets of Schubert's Winterreise and Die sch√∂ne M√ºllerin, Schumann's Dichterliebe, and songs by Haydn, Mozart, Bridge, Ireland, Holst, Tippett and Richard Rodney Bennett. Other soloists whom Britten accompanied on record were Ferrier, Rostropovich and Vishnevskaya. As a conductor he recorded a wide range of composers, from Purcell to Grainger. Among his best-known Decca recordings are Purcell's The Fairy-Queen, Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, Cantata 151, Cantata 102 and St John Passion, Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius and Mozart's last two symphonies.

Christina Stead was a committed Marxist, although she was never a member of the Communist Party. She spent much of her life outside Australia, although she returned before her death. Biography Christina Stead's father was the marine biologist and pioneer conservationist David George Stead. She was born in the Sydney suburb of Rockdale. They lived in Rockdale at Lydham Hall. She later moved with her family to the suburb of Watsons Bay in 1911. She was the only child of her father's first marriage, and had five half-siblings from his second marriage. He also married a third time, to Thistle Yolette Harris, the Australian botanist, educator, author, and conservationist. According to some, this house was a hellhole for her because of her \\"domineering\\" father.Sydney Morning Herald, 2015-9-11, p.15 She then left Australia in 1928, and worked in a Parisian bank from 1930 to 1935. Stead also became involved with the writer, broker and Marxist political economist William J. Blake (formerly Wilhelm Blech), with whom she travelled to Spain (leaving at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War) and to the USA. They married in 1952, once Blake was able to obtain a divorce from his previous wife. It was after his death from stomach cancer in 1968 that she returned to Australia. Indeed, Stead only returned to Australia after she was denied the Britannica-Australia prize on the grounds that she had \\"ceased to be an Australian.\\" Stead wrote 12 novels and several volumes of short stories in her lifetime. She taught \\"Workshop in the Novel\\" at New York University in 1943 and 1944, and also worked as a Hollywood screenwriter in the 1940s, contributing to the Madame Curie biopic and the John Ford and John Wayne war movie, They Were Expendable. Her first novel, Seven Poor Men of Sydney (1934), dealt with the lives of radicals and dockworkers, but she was not a practitioner of social realism. Stead's best-known novel, titled The Man Who Loved Children, is largely based on her own childhood, and was first published in 1940. It was not until the poet Randall Jarrell wrote the introduction for a new American edition in 1965 and her New York publisher convinced her to change the setting from Sydney to Washington, that the novel began to receive a larger audience. In 2005, the magazine Time included this work in their \\"100 Best Novels from 1923‚Äì2005,\\" and in 2010 American author Jonathan Franzen hailed the novel as a \\"masterpiece\\" in The New York Times. Stead's Letty Fox: Her Luck, often regarded as an equally fine novel, was officially banned in Australia for several years because it was considered amoral and salacious. Stead set her only British novel, Cotters' England, partly in Gateshead (called Bridgehead in the novel). She was in Newcastle upon Tyne in the summer of 1949, accompanied by her friend Anne Dooley (n√©e Kelly), a local woman, who was the model for Nellie Cotter, the extraordinary heroine of the book. Anne was no doubt responsible for Stead's reasonable attempt at conveying the local accent. Her letters indicate that she had taken on Tyneside speech and become deeply concerned with the people around her. The American title of the book is Dark Places of the Heart. Stead died in hospital at Balmain, Sydney, in 1983, aged 80. Her former home in Pacific Street, Watsons Bay, was the first site chosen for the Woollahra Council Plaque Scheme, which was launched in 2014 with the aim of honouring significant people who had lived in the area covered by Woollahra Council.Sydney Morning Herald, 2015-9-11, p. 15 A plaque was installed on the footpath outside Stead's former home.

It forms the tectonic boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, and its motion is right-lateral strike-slip (horizontal). The fault divides into three segments, each with different characteristics and a different degree of earthquake risk. The slip rate along the fault ranges from /yr. The fault was identified in 1895 by Professor Andrew Lawson of UC Berkeley, who discovered the northern zone. It is often described as having been named after San Andreas Lake, a small body of water that was formed in a valley between the two plates. However, according to some of his reports from 1895 and 1908, Lawson actually named it after the surrounding San Andreas Valley. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Lawson concluded that the fault extended all the way into southern California. In 1953, geologist Thomas Dibblee concluded that hundreds of miles of lateral movement could occur along the fault. A project called the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) near Parkfield, Monterey County, was drilled through the fault during 2004‚Äì2007 to collect material and make physical and chemical observations to better understand fault behavior.  Fault zones  = Northern = A map displaying each of the seven major faults in the alt=A map tracing all the faults in the Bay Area, and listing probabilities of earthquakes occurring on them. The northern segment of the fault runs from Hollister, through the Santa Cruz Mountains, epicenter of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, then up the San Francisco Peninsula, where it was first identified by Professor Lawson in 1895, then offshore at Daly City near Mussel Rock. This is the approximate location of the epicenter of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The fault returns onshore at Bolinas Lagoon just north of Stinson Beach in Marin County. It returns underwater through the linear trough of Tomales Bay which separates the Point Reyes Peninsula from the mainland, runs just east of Bodega Head through Bodega Bay and back underwater, returning onshore at Fort Ross. (In this region around the San Francisco Bay Area several significant \\"sister faults\\" run more-or-less parallel, and each of these can create significantly destructive earthquakes.) From Fort Ross, the northern segment continues overland, forming in part a linear valley through which the Gualala River flows. It goes back offshore at Point Arena. After that, it runs underwater along the coast until it nears Cape Mendocino, where it begins to bend to the west, terminating at the Mendocino Triple Junction. = Central = The central segment of the San Andreas Fault runs in a northwestern direction from Parkfield to Hollister. While the southern section of the fault and the parts through Parkfield experience earthquakes, the rest of the central section of the fault exhibits a phenomenon called aseismic creep, where the fault slips continuously without causing earthquakes. = Southern = Aerial photo of the San Andreas Fault in the Carrizo Plain The Vasquez Rocks in Agua Dulce, California are evidence of the San Andreas Fault and part of the 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail. The southern segment (also known as the Mojave segment) begins near Bombay Beach, California. Box Canyon, near the Salton Sea, contains upturned strata associated with that section of the fault. The fault then runs along the southern base of the San Bernardino Mountains, crosses through the Cajon Pass and continues northwest along the northern base of the San Gabriel Mountains. These mountains are a result of movement along the San Andreas Fault and are commonly called the Transverse Range. In Palmdale, a portion of the fault is easily examined at a roadcut for the Antelope Valley Freeway. The fault continues northwest alongside the Elizabeth Lake Road to the town of Elizabeth Lake. As it passes the towns of Gorman, Tejon Pass and Frazier Park, the fault begins to bend northward, forming the \\"Big Bend\\". This restraining bend is thought to be where the fault locks up in Southern California, with an earthquake-recurrence interval of roughly 140‚Äì160 years. Northwest of Frazier Park, the fault runs through the Carrizo Plain, a long, treeless plain where much of the fault is plainly visible. The Elkhorn Scarp defines the fault trace along much of its length within the plain. The southern segment, which stretches from Parkfield in Monterey County all the way to the Salton Sea, is capable of an 8.1-magnitude earthquake. At its closest, this fault passes about to the northeast of Los Angeles. Such a large earthquake on this southern segment would kill thousands of people in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, and surrounding areas, and cause hundreds of billions of dollars in damage.  Plate boundaries  The Pacific Plate, to the west of the fault, is moving in a northwest direction while the North American Plate to the east is moving toward the southwest, but relatively southeast under the influence of plate tectonics. The rate of slippage averages about a year across California. The southwestward motion of the North American Plate towards the Pacific is creating compressional forces along the eastern side of the fault. The effect is expressed as the Coast Ranges. The northwest movement of the Pacific Plate is also creating significant compressional forces which are especially pronounced where the North American Plate has forced the San Andreas to jog westward. This has led to the formation of the Transverse Ranges in Southern California, and to a lesser but still significant extent, the Santa Cruz Mountains (the location of the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989). Studies of the relative motions of the Pacific and North American plates have shown that only about 75 percent of the motion can be accounted for in the movements of the San Andreas and its various branch faults. The rest of the motion has been found in an area east of the Sierra Nevada mountains called the Walker Lane or Eastern California Shear Zone. The reason for this is not clear. Several hypotheses have been offered and research is ongoing. One hypothesis ‚Äì which gained interest following the Landers earthquake in 1992 ‚Äì suggests the plate boundary may be shifting eastward away from the San Andreas towards Walker Lane. Assuming the plate boundary does not change as hypothesized, projected motion indicates that the landmass west of the San Andreas Fault, including Los Angeles, will eventually slide past San Francisco, then continue northwestward toward the Aleutian Trench, over a period of perhaps twenty million years. San Andreas Fault. Geologypage. Retrieved from July 21st, 2020.  Formation  Tectonic evolution of the San Andreas Fault. The San Andreas began to form in the mid Cenozoic about 30 Mya (million years ago).Atwater, T., 1970, Implications of Plate Tectonics for the Cenozoic Tectonic Evolution of Western North America At this time, a spreading center between the Pacific Plate and the Farallon Plate (which is now mostly subducted, with remnants including the Juan de Fuca Plate, Rivera Plate, Cocos Plate, and the Nazca Plate) was beginning to reach the subduction zone off the western coast of North America. As the relative motion between the Pacific and North American Plates was different from the relative motion between the Farallon and North American Plates, the spreading ridge began to be \\"subducted\\", creating a new relative motion and a new style of deformation along the plate boundaries. These geological features are what are chiefly seen along San Andreas Fault. It also includes a possible driver for the deformation of the Basin and Range, separation of the Baja California Peninsula, and rotation of the Transverse Range. The main southern section of the San Andreas Fault proper has only existed for about 5 million years. The first known incarnation of the southern part of the fault was Clemens Well-Fenner-San Francisquito fault zone around 22‚Äì13 Ma. This system added the San Gabriel Fault as a primary focus of movement between 10‚Äì5 Ma. Currently, it is believed that the modern San Andreas will eventually transfer its motion toward a fault within the Eastern California Shear Zone. This complicated evolution, especially along the southern segment, is mostly caused by either the \\"Big Bend\\" and/or a difference in the motion vector between the plates and the trend of the fault and its surrounding branches.  Study  = Early years= The fault was first identified in Northern California by UC Berkeley geology professor Andrew Lawson in 1895 and named by him after the Laguna de San Andreas, a small lake which lies in a linear valley formed by the fault just south of San Francisco. Eleven years later, Lawson discovered that the San Andreas Fault stretched southward into southern California after reviewing the effects of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Large-scale (hundreds of miles) lateral movement along the fault was first proposed in a 1953 paper by geologists Mason Hill and Thomas Dibblee. This idea, which was considered radical at the time, has since been vindicated by modern plate tectonics. = Current research = Seismologists discovered that the San Andreas Fault near Parkfield in central California consistently produces a magnitude 6.0 earthquake approximately once every 22 years. Following recorded seismic events in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966, scientists predicted that another earthquake should occur in Parkfield in 1993. It eventually occurred in 2004. Due to the frequency of predictable activity, Parkfield has become one of the most important areas in the world for large earthquake research. In 2004, work began just north of Parkfield on the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD). The goal of SAFOD is to drill a hole nearly into the Earth's crust and into the San Andreas Fault. An array of sensors will be installed to record earthquakes that happen near this area. The San Andreas Fault System has been the subject of a flood of studies. In particular, scientific research performed during the last 23 years has given rise to about 3,400 publications. = The next \\"Big One\\" = Radar generated 3-D view of the San Andreas Fault, at Crystal Springs Reservoir near San Mateo, California. A study published in 2006 in the journal Nature found that the San Andreas fault has reached a sufficient stress level for an earthquake of magnitude greater than 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale to occur. This study also found that the risk of a large earthquake may be increasing more rapidly than scientists had previously believed. Moreover, the risk is currently concentrated on the southern section of the fault, i.e. the region around Los Angeles, because massive earthquakes have occurred relatively recently on the central (1857) and northern (1906) segments of the fault, while the southern section has not seen any similar rupture for at least 300 years. According to this study, a massive earthquake on that southern section of the San Andreas fault would result in major damage to the Palm Springs‚ÄìIndio metropolitan area and other cities in San Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial counties in California, and Mexicali Municipality in Baja California. It would be strongly felt (and potentially cause significant damage) throughout much of Southern California, including densely populated areas of Los Angeles County, Ventura County, Orange County, San Diego County, Ensenada Municipality and Tijuana Municipality, Baja California, San Luis Rio Colorado in Sonora and Yuma, Arizona. Older buildings would be especially prone to damage or collapse, as would buildings built on unconsolidated gravel or in coastal areas where water tables are high (and thus subject to soil liquefaction). The paper concluded : Nevertheless, in the years since that publication there has not been a substantial quake in the Los Angeles area, and two major reports issued by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) have made variable predictions as to the risk of future seismic events. The ability to predict major earthquakes with sufficient precision to warrant increased precautions has remained elusive. The U.S. Geological Survey most recent forecast, known as UCERF3 (Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast 3), released in November 2013, estimated that an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 M or greater (i.e. equal to or greater than the 1994 Northridge earthquake) occurs about once every 6.7 years statewide. The same report also estimated there is a 7% probability that an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or greater will occur in the next 30 years somewhere along the San Andreas Fault. A different USGS study in 2008 tried to assess the physical, social and economic consequences of a major earthquake in southern California. That study predicted that a magnitude 7.8 earthquake along the southern San Andreas Fault could cause about 1,800 deaths and $213 billion in damage. = Cascadia connection = A 2008 paper, studying past earthquakes along the Pacific coastal zone, found a correlation in time between seismic events on the northern San Andreas Fault and the southern part of the Cascadia subduction zone (which stretches from Vancouver Island to northern California). Scientists believe quakes on the Cascadia subduction zone may have triggered most of the major quakes on the northern San Andreas within the past 3,000 years. The evidence also shows the rupture direction going from north to south in each of these time-correlated events. However the 1906 San Francisco earthquake seems to have been the exception to this correlation because the plate movement was moved mostly from south to north and it was not preceded by a major quake in the Cascadia zone.  Earthquakes  The San Andreas Fault has had some notable earthquakes in historic times: * 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake: About were ruptured in central and southern California. Though it is known as the Fort Tejon earthquake, the epicenter is thought to have been located far to the north, just south of Parkfield. Two deaths were reported. Its moment magnitude was 7.9. * 1906 San Francisco earthquake: About were ruptured in Northern California. The epicenter was near San Francisco. At least 3,000 people died in the earthquake and subsequent fires. The magnitude was estimated to be 7.8. * 1957 San Francisco earthquake: A magnitude 5.7 quake with an epicenter on the San Andreas fault in the ocean west of San Francisco and Daly City. * 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake: About were ruptured (although the rupture did not reach the surface) near Santa Cruz, California, causing 63 deaths and moderate damage in certain vulnerable locations in the San Francisco Bay Area. Moment magnitude was about 6.9. This quake occurred on October 17, 1989, at approximately 5:04 pm PDT. * 2004 Parkfield earthquake: On September 28, 2004, at 10:15 am PDT, a magnitude 6.0 earthquake struck the Parkfield area. It was felt across the state, including the San Francisco Bay Area.

K. or J.-K.). He is most famous for the novel √Ä rebours (1884, published in English as Against the Grain or Against Nature). He supported himself by a 30-year career in the French civil service. Huysmans' work is considered remarkable for its idiosyncratic use of the French language, large vocabulary, descriptions, satirical wit and far-ranging erudition. First considered part of Naturalism, he became associated with the decadent movement with his publication of √Ä rebours. His work expressed his deep pessimism, which had led him to the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer.Twenty-three year-old Schopenhauer, who had a great influence on Huysmans, told Wieland, \\"Life is an unpleasant business. I have resolved to spend it reflecting on it. (Das Leben ist eine mi√üliche Sache. Ich habe mir vorgesetzt, es damit hinzubringen, √ºber dasselbe nachzudenken.)\\" (R√ºdiger Safranski, Schopenhauer and the Wild Years of Philosophy, Chapter 7). In later years, his novels reflected his study of Catholicism, religious conversion, and becoming an oblate. He discussed the iconography of Christian architecture at length in La cath√©drale (1898), set at Chartres and with its cathedral as the focus of the book. L√†-bas (1891), En route (1895) and La cath√©drale (1898) are a trilogy that feature Durtal, an autobiographical character whose spiritual progress is tracked and who converts to Catholicism. In the novel that follows, L'Oblat (1903), Durtal becomes an oblate in a monastery, as Huysmans himself was in the Benedictine Abbey at Ligug√©, near Poitiers, in 1901.Keeler, Sister Jerome (1950). \\"J.‚ÄìK. Huysmans, Benedictine Oblate,\\" American Benedictine Review, Vol. I, pp. 60‚Äì66.The Cathedral, Introduction, Dedalus 1997 La cath√©drale was his most commercially successful work. Its profits enabled Huysmans to retire from his civil service job and live on his royalties. Parents and early life Huysmans was born in Paris in 1848. His father Godfried Huysmans was Dutch, and a lithographer by trade. His mother Malvina Badin Huysmans had been a schoolmistress. Huysmans' father died when he was eight years old. After his mother quickly remarried, Huysmans resented his stepfather, Jules Og, a Protestant who was part-owner of a Parisian book- bindery. During childhood, Huysmans turned away from the Roman Catholic Church. He was unhappy at school but completed his coursework and earned a baccalaur√©at. Civil service career Huysmans' grave For 32 years, Huysmans worked as a civil servant for the French Ministry of the Interior, a job he found tedious. The young Huysmans was called up to fight in the Franco- Prussian War, but was invalided out with dysentery. He used this experience in an early story, \\"Sac au dos\\" (Backpack) (later included in his collection, Les Soir√©es de M√©dan). After his retirement from the Ministry in 1898, made possible by the commercial success of his novel, La cath√©drale, Huysmans planned to leave Paris and move to Ligug√©. He intended to set up a community of Catholic artists, including Charles-Marie Dulac (1862-1898). He had praised the young painter in La cath√©drale. Dulac died a few months before Huysmans completed his arrangements for the move to Ligug√©, and he decided to stay in Paris. In addition to his novels, Huysmans was known for his art criticism in L'Art moderne (1883) and Certains (1889). He was a founding member of the Acad√©mie Goncourt. An early advocate of Impressionism, he admired such artists as Gustave Moreau and Odilon Redon. In 1905 Huysmans was diagnosed with cancer of the mouth. He died in 1907 and was interred in the cimeti√®re du Montparnasse, Paris. A portrait of Huysmans, by Jean-Louis Forain, c. 1878 (Mus√©e d'Orsay) Personal life Huysmans never married or had children. He had a long-term, on-and-off relationship with Anna Meunier, a seamstress.Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-si√®cle France, Robert Ziegler, Palgrave Macmillan, 2012, pp. 2, 7, 125The Mirror of Divinity: The World and Creation in J.-K. Huysmans, Robert Ziegler, University of Delaware Press, 2004, p. 159 Writing career He used the name Joris-Karl Huysmans when he published his writing, as a way of honoring his father's ancestry. His first major publication was a collection of prose poems, Le drageoir aux √©pices (1874), which were strongly influenced by Baudelaire. They attracted little attention but revealed flashes of the author's distinctive style. Huysmans followed it with the novel, Marthe, Histoire d'une fille (1876). The story of a young prostitute, it was closer to Naturalism and brought him to the attention of √âmile Zola. His next works were similar: sombre, realistic and filled with detailed evocations of Paris, a city Huysmans knew intimately. Les Soeurs Vatard (1879), dedicated to Zola, deals with the lives of women in a bookbindery. En m√©nage (1881) is an account of a writer's failed marriage. The climax of his early work is the novella √Ä vau-l'eau (1882) (Downstream or With the Flow), the story of a downtrodden clerk, Monsieur Folantin, and his quest for a decent meal. A caricature showing Huysmans as a somewhat eccentric sort of literary dandy, by Coll-Toc, 1885 Huysmans' novel √Ä rebours (Against the Grain or Against Nature or Wrong Way; 1884) became his most famous, or notorious. It featured the character of an aesthete, des Esseintes, and decisively broke from Naturalism. It was seen as an example of \\"decadent\\" literature. The description of des Esseintes' \\"alluring liaison\\" with a \\"cherry-lipped youth\\" was believed to have influenced other writers of the decadent movement, including Oscar Wilde. It is now considered an important step in the formation of \\"gay literature\\". √Ä rebours gained notoriety as an exhibit in the trials of Oscar Wilde in 1895. The prosecutor referred to it as a \\"sodomitical\\" book. The book appalled Zola, who felt it had dealt a \\"terrible blow\\" to Naturalism. Huysmans began to drift away from the Naturalists and found new friends among the Symbolist and Catholic writers whose work he had praised in √Ä rebours. They included Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly, Villiers de L'Isle Adam and L√©on Bloy. St√©phane Mallarm√© was so pleased with the publicity his verse had received from the novel that he dedicated one of his most famous poems, \\"Prose pour des Esseintes\\", to its hero. Barbey d'Aurevilly told Huysmans that after writing √Ä rebours, he would have to choose between \\"the muzzle of a pistol and the foot of the Cross.\\" Huysmans, who had received a secular education and abandoned his Catholic religion in childhood, returned to the Catholic Church eight years later.Baldick, Robert (1959). Introduction to Against Nature, his translation of Huysmans' √Å rebours. Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 12. Huysmans' next novel, En rade, an unromantic account of a summer spent in the country, did not sell as well as its predecessor. His L√†-bas (1891) attracted considerable attention for its portrayal of Satanism in France in the late 1880s.Rudwin, Maxmilian J. (1920). \\"The Satanism of Huysmans,\\" The Open Court, Vol. XXXIV, pp. 240‚Äì251.Thurstan, Frederic (1928). \\"Huysmans' Excursion into Occultism,\\" Occult Review, Vol. XLVIII, pp. 227‚Äì236. He introduced the character Durtal, a thinly disguised self-portrait. The later Durtal novels, En route (1895), La cath√©drale (1898) and L'oblat (1903), explore Durtal/Huysmans' conversion to Roman Catholicism.Hanighan, F.C. (1931). \\"Huysmans Conversion,\\" The Open Court, Vol. XLV, pp. 474‚Äì481. En route depicts Durtal's spiritual struggle during his stay at a Trappist monastery. In La cath√©drale (1898), the protagonist is at Chartres, intensely studying the cathedral and its symbolism. The commercial success of this book enabled Huysmans to retire from the civil service and live on his royalties. In L'Oblat, Durtal becomes a Benedictine oblate. He finally learns to accept the world's suffering. Huysmans' work was known for his idiosyncratic use of the French language, extensive vocabulary, detailed and sensuous descriptions, and biting, satirical wit. It also displays an encyclopaedic erudition, ranging from the catalogue of decadent Latin authors in √Ä rebours to the discussion of the iconography of Christian architecture in La cath√©drale. Huysmans expresses a disgust with modern life and a deep pessimism. This had led him first to the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. Later he returned to the Catholic Church, as noted in his Durtal novels. Honors Huysmans was made a Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur in 1892, for his work with the civil service. In 1905, his admirers persuaded the French government to promote him to Officier de la L√©gion d'honneur for his literary achievements. Style and Influence Paris, 6e A caricature of Huysmans, by F√©lix Vallotton, c. 1898 \\"It takes me two years to 'document' myself for a novel ‚Äì two years of hard work. That is the trouble with the naturalistic novel ‚Äì it requires so much documentary care. I never make, like Zola, a plan for a book. I know how it will begin and how it will end ‚Äì that's all. When I finally get to writing it, it goes along rather fast ‚Äì assez vite.\\"Henry, Stuart (1897). Hours with Famous Parisians. Chicago: Way & Williams, p. 114. \\"Barbaric in its profusion, violent in its emphasis, wearying in its splendor, it is ‚Äì especially in regard to things seen ‚Äì extraordinarily expressive, with all the shades of a painter's palette. Elaborately and deliberately perverse, it is in its very perversity that Huysmans' work - so fascinating, so repellent, so instinctively artificial - comes to represent, as the work of no other writer can be said to do, the main tendencies, the chief results, of the Decadent movement in literature.\\" (Arthur Symons, The Decadent Movement in Literature) \\"...Continually dragging Mother Image by the hair or the feet down the worm-eaten staircase of terrified Syntax.\\" (L√©on Bloy, quoted in Robert Baldick, The Life of J.-K. Huysmans) \\"It is difficult to find a writer whose vocabulary is so extensive, so constantly surprising, so sharp and yet so exquisitely gamey in flavour, so constantly lucky in its chance finds and in its very inventiveness.\\" (Julien Gracq) \\"In short, he kicks the oedipal to the curb\\" (M. Quaine, Heirs and Graces, 1932, Jowett / Arcana) Huysmans' novel, Against the Grain, has more discussions of sound, smell and taste than any other work of literature we know of. For example, one chapter consists entirely of smell hallucinations so vivid that they exhaust the book's central character, Des Esseintes, a bizarre, depraved aristocrat. A student of the perfumer's art, Esseintes has developed several devices for titillating his jaded senses. Besides special instruments for re-creating any conceivable odour, he has constructed a special \\"mouth organ\\", designed to stimulate his palate rather than his ears. The organ's regular pipes have been replaced by rows of little barrels, each containing a different liqueur. In Esseintes's mind, the taste of each liqueur corresponded with the sound of a particular instrument. \\"Dry cura√ßao, for instance, was like the clarinet with its shrill, velvety note: k√ºmmel like the oboe, whose timbre is sonorous and nasal; cr√®me de menthe and anisette like the flute, at one and the same time sweet and poignant, whining and soft. Then to complete the orchestra, comes kirsch, blowing a wild trumpet blast; gin and whisky, deafening the palate with their harsh outbursts of cornets and trombones:liqueur brandy, blaring with the overwhelming crash of the tubas.\\"Huysman, 1884/1931, p. 132 By careful and persistent experimentation, Esseintes learned to \\"execute on his tongue a succession of voiceless melodies; noiseless funeral marches, solemn and stately; could hear in his mouth solos of cr√®me de menthe, duets of vespertro and rum.\\" Sekuler, R., & Blake, R. (1985). Perception. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, pp. 404‚Äì405. The protagonist of Submission (2015), a controversial novel by Michel Houellebecq, is a literary scholar specializing in Huysmans and his work; Huysmans's relation to Catholicism serves as a foil for the book's treatment of Islam in France.

For example, the concatenation of \\"snow\\" and \\"ball\\" is \\"snowball\\". In certain formalisations of concatenation theory, also called string theory, string concatenation is a primitive notion. Syntax In many programming languages, string concatenation is a binary infix operator. The \`+\` (plus) operator is often overloaded to denote concatenation for string arguments: \`\\"Hello, \\" + \\"World\\"\` has the value \`\\"Hello, World\\"\`. In other languages there is a separate operator, particularly to specify implicit type conversion to string, as opposed to more complicated behavior for generic plus. Examples include \`.\` in Edinburgh IMP, Perl, and PHP, \`..\` in Lua, and \`&\` in Ada, AppleScript, and Visual Basic.Concatenation Operators in Visual Basic Other syntax exists, like \`\` in PL/I and Oracle Database SQL.Concatenation Operator In a few languages, notably C, C++, and Python, there is string literal concatenation, meaning that adjacent string literals are concatenated, without any operator: \`\\"Hello, \\" \\"World\\"\` has the value \`\\"Hello, World\\"\`. In other languages, concatenation of string literals with an operator is evaluated at compile time, via constant folding, although this is often an implementation detail of the compiler, rather than a language feature. Implementation In programming, string concatenation generally occurs at run time, as string values are not in general known until run time. However, in the case of string literals, the values are known at compile time, and thus string concatenation can be done at compile time, either via string literal concatenation or via constant folding. Concatenation of sets of strings In formal language theory and pattern matching (including regular expressions), the concatenation operation on strings is generalised to an operation on sets of strings as follows: For two sets of strings S1 and S2, the concatenation S1S2 consists of all strings of the form vw where v is a string from S1 and w is a string from S2, or formally . Many authors also use concatenation of a string set and a single string, and vice versa, which are defined similarly by and . In these definitions, the string vw is the ordinary concatenation of strings v and w as defined in the introductory section. For example, if , and , then FR denotes the set of all chess board coordinates in algebraic notation, while eR denotes the set of all coordinates of the kings' file. In this context, sets of strings are often referred to as formal languages. The concatenation operator is usually expressed as simple juxtaposition (as with multiplication). Algebraic properties The strings over an alphabet, with the concatenation operation, form an associative algebraic structure with identity element the null string--a free monoid. Sets of strings with concatenation and alternation form a semiring, with concatenation (*) distributing over alternation (+); 0 is the empty set and 1 the set consisting of just the null string. Applications =Audio/telephony= In programming for telephony, concatenation is used to provide dynamic audio feedback to a user. For example, in a \\"time of day\\" speaking clock, concatenation is used to give the correct time by playing the appropriate recordings concatenated together. For example: * \\"At the tone the time will be\\" * \\"Eight\\" * \\"Thirty\\" * \\"Five\\" * \\"and\\" * \\"Twenty\\" * \\"Five\\" * \\"Seconds\\" The recordings themselves exist separately, but playing them one after the other provides a grammatically correct sentence to the listener. This technique is also used in number change announcements, voice mail systems, or most telephony applications that provide dynamic feedback to the caller (e.g. moviefone, tellme, and others). Programming for any kind of computerised public address system can also employ concatenation for dynamic public announcements (for example, flights in an airport). The system would archive recorded speech of numbers, routes or airlines, destinations, times, etc. and play them back in a specific sequence to produce a grammatically correct sentence that is announced throughout the facility. =Database theory= One of the principles of relational database design is that the fields of data tables should reflect a single characteristic of the table's subject, which means that they should not contain concatenated strings. When concatenation is desired in a report, it should be provided at the time of running the report. For example, to display the physical address of a certain customer, the data might include building number, street name, building sub-unit number, city name, state/province name, postal code, and country name, e.g., \\"123 Fake St Apt 4, Boulder, CO 80302, USA\\", which combines seven fields. However, the customers data table should not use one field to store that concatenated string; rather, the concatenation of the seven fields should happen upon running the report. The reason for such principles is that without them, the entry and updating of large volumes of data becomes error-prone and labor-intensive. Separately entering the city, state, ZIP code, and nation allows data-entry validation (such as detecting an invalid state abbreviation). Then those separate items can be used for sorting or indexing the records, such as all with \\"Boulder\\" as the city name. =Recreational mathematics= In recreational mathematics, many problems concern the properties of numbers under concatenation of their numerals in some base. Examples include home primes (primes obtained by repeatedly factoring the increasing concatenation of prime factors of a given number), Smarandache‚ÄìWellin numbers (the concatenations of the first prime numbers), and the Champernowne and Copeland‚ÄìErd≈ës constants (the real numbers formed by the decimal representations of the positive integers and the prime numbers, respectively).

He was the first saint to be canonized not by a local authority but by the Pope. Life =Early years= Much of the information concerning Ulrich is derived from the Life of St Ulrich written by Gerhard of Augsburg sometime between 982 and 993. Ulrich was born in 890 at Kyburg, Zurich in present-day Switzerland. He was the son of Hupald, Count of Dillingen (d. 909) and Dietpirch of Swabia (also known as Theoberga).Schmid, Ulrich. \\"St. Ulrich.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 25 Jan. 2014 His maternal grandfather was Burchard I, Duke of Swabia. Burchard was reportedly the second husband of Liutgard, who was the widow of Louis the Younger.R. B. Stewart, \\"My Lines:Liutgard von Sachsen\\" The siblings of Dietpirch included Burchard II, Duke of Swabia. His family was connected with the dukes of Alamannia and the Ottonian dynasty. An unnamed sister served as a nun in Buchau. As was customary, his parents presented him as an oblate to the church while he was still a child.Abels, Richard. \\"The \\"Church\\" and the Lay Aristocracy, ca. 950: The Case of Saint Ulrich of Augsburg\\", USNA A sickly child, at the age of seven he was sent to the monastery of St. Gall, where he proved to be an excellent scholar. While there, he became friends with St. Wiborada, a recluse who lived near the monastery and foretold that her young friend was destined to become a bishop.Butler, Alban. Lives of the Saints, Liturgical Press, (1995) He resolved to enter the priesthood, but was in doubt whether to enter the Benedictine Abbey of St. Gall or to become a secular priest. Sometime before April 910, he was sent for further training to a kinsman, Adalbero, Bishop of Augsburg, who made him chamberlain. Upon Adalbero's death (28 April 910) Ulrich returned home. The Duke of Swabia presented him at the court of Henry I of Germany, where Ulrich became one of the household retainers. =Bishop of Augsburg= Through the influence of his maternal uncle, Burchard II, Duke of Swabia, and other relatives, Ulrich was appointed bishop of Augsburg by Henry I of Germany, and was consecrated on 28 December 923. He sought to improve the low moral and social condition of the clergy. The See of Augsburg reached the period of its greatest splendor under Ulrich; he raised the standard of training and discipline among the clergy by the reformation of existing schools and the establishment of new ones, and by canonical visitations and synods; he provided for the poor, and rebuilt decayed churches and monasteries. He built churches in honor of St. Afra and St. John, and founded the monastery of St. Stephen for Benedictine nuns.Lins, Joseph. \\"Augsburg.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 25 Jan. 2014 For purposes of obtaining relics he went on two journeys to Rome, in 910, and in 952 or 953. German emperor Otto I the Great granted Ulrich the right to mint coins. During the struggle between Otto I and his son Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, Ulrich remained loyal to Otto,Hehl, Ernst-Dieter. \\"Ulrich of Augsburg.\\" Religion Past and Present. Brill Online, 2015. Reference. 26 March 2015 holding for him the castle of Schwabm√ºnchen, which was within the territorial jurisdiction of the Bishop of Augsburg. When in the summer of 954 father and son were ready to attack each other at Illertissen in Swabia, at the last moment Ulrich and Bishop Hartbert of Chur were able to mediate between Otto and Liudolf. Ulrich succeeded in persuading Liudolf and Conrad, Duke of Lorraine, Otto's son-in-law, to ask the king's pardon on 17 December 954. =Against the Magyars= Statue of S. Ulrich in a church in Gora Oljka (Slovenia) Magyars repeatedly attacked in the territories of Bavaria and Swabia. Ulrich served as general in the defense of Augsburg. He built a stone wall fortification around the city. During these attacks many churches and buildings were destroyed, which Ulrich later rebuilt. Ulrich attended several imperial meetings and synods, such as at Ingelheim in 948, Augsburg 952, Rome in 972 and again at Ingelheim in 972. Soon after, the Magyars entered Germany, plundering and burning as they went, and in 955 advanced as far as Augsburg, which they besieged. It was due to Ulrich's ability and courage that Augsburg was able to hold out against the besiegers until the Emperor Otto arrived. According to his biographer Gerhard, Bishop Ulrich took the lead in the defense of the city. On the first day of the attack, Bishop Ulrich rode out to encourage the towns‚Äô soldiers in their defense of the city's gate. While the battle raged, the bishop, dressed in his ecclesiastical robes, inspired his men, with the 23rd Psalm (\\"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death\\"). While this defense was going on, the King was raising an army to march south. The fiercest fighting probably took place on August 8 at the eastern gate, which the Hungarians tried to storm in large numbers. The Bishop's men defended bravely and killed the leader of the attack, forcing the Hungarians to withdraw. That evening Ulrich returned to the city to direct throughout the night the repair and strengthening of its walls. The next day the Hungarians launched a wider general attack. During the battle, Berchtold of Risinesburg arrived, which heralded the approach of the German army. At the end of the day, the siege was suspended. Bishop Ulrich subsequently contributed much to the decisive victory at the Battle of Lechfeld (10 August 955), where the invaders were finally defeated. However, Ulrich Schmid maintains that \\"The later assertion that Ulrich himself took part in the battle is incorrect.\\" His character Ulrich demanded a high moral standard of himself and others. A hundred years after his death, a letter apparently written by him, which opposed celibacy, and supported the marriage of priests, suddenly appeared. The forger of the letter counted on the opinion of the common people, who would regard celibacy as unjust if St. Ulrich, known for the rigidity of his morals, upheld the marriage of priests.cf. \\"Analecta Boll.\\", XXVII, 1908, 474 Ulrich was also steadfastly loyal, as a prince of the empire, to the emperor. He was one of the most important props of the Ottonian policy, which rested mainly upon the ecclesiastical princes. He constantly attended the judicial courts held by the king and in the Imperial Diets. He even took part in the Diet held on 20 September 972, when he defended himself against the charge of nepotism in regard to his nephew Adalbero, whom he had appointed his coadjutor on account of his own illness and desire to retire to a Benedictine abbey. As morning dawned on 4 July 973, Ulrich had ashes strewn on the ground in the shape of a cross; the cross sprinkled with holy water, and he was placed upon it. His nephew Richwin came with a message and greeting from the Emperor Otto II as the sun rose, and immediately upon this, while the clergy sang the Litany, Ulrich died. He was buried at the St. Afra church he had rebuilt in Augsburg; the burial was performed by Bishop Wolfgang of Ratisbon. Later the St. Ulrich and Afra church was built in the same spot. He was succeeded by Henry. The maniple of Ulrich was woven in red and white silk using tablet weaving and Ulrich's relic was later analyzed by Peter Collingwood in his The Techniques of Tablet Weaving; Collingwood regarded it as a 'masterpiece'. Veneration When Ulrich was too old and weak to say Mass, angels are said to have come to him to assist him. Places that were named after him are said to be host to healing abilities. Attesting to his early cultus, there is a very beautiful miniature from the tenth century in a manuscript now in the library of Einsiedeln.no. 261, fol. 140 Other miniatures are at the Royal Library of Munich, in manuscripts dating from the year 1454.Cgm., 94, fo. 26v, and Cgm., no. 751 Many miracles are said to have been wrought at his grave; only 20 years after his death, Ulrich was canonized by Pope John XV on 4 July 993. He was the first saint to be canonized by a Pope, rather than by a local authority.\\"St. Ulrich of Augsburg\\", Catholic News Agency Walter of Pontoise was the last saint in Western Europe to have been canonized by an authority other than the Pope; he was canonized by Hugh de Boves, the Archbishop of Rouen in 1153.William Smith, Samuel Cheetham, A Dictionary of Christian Antiquities (Murray, 1875), 283.Alexander III =Patronage= Along with Afra and Simpert, Ulrich is a patron saint of Augsburg.

The hilt (rarely called a haft or shaft) of a knife, dagger, sword, or bayonet is its handle, consisting of a guard, grip and pommel. The guard may contain a crossguard or quillons. A tassel or sword knot may be attached to the guard or pommel.  Pommel  A Visayan tenegre horn hilt from the Philippines, depicting the moon-engulfing sea serpent deity, Bakunawa, a prominent figure in Philippine mythology. The pommel (Anglo-Norman ' \\"little apple\\" In Old French of an ornamental knob from the late 11th century, attested for the pommel of a sword in the late 12th century, of the pommel of a saddle in the mid-15th century. Compare Middle Latin pomellum, pomellus \\"knob, boss\\" (12th century).) is an enlarged fitting at the top of the handle. They were originally developed to prevent the sword slipping from the hand. From around the 11th century in Europe they became heavy enough to be a counterweight to the blade. This gave the sword a point of balance not too far from the hilt allowing a more fluid fighting style. Depending on sword design and swordsmanship style, the pommel may also be used to strike the opponent (e.g., using the Mordhau technique). Pommels have appeared in a wide variety of shapes, including oblate spheroids, crescents, disks, wheels, and animal or bird heads. They are often engraved or inlayed with various designs and occasionally gilt and mounted with jewels. Ewart Oakeshott introduced a system of classification of medieval pommel forms in his The Sword in the Age of Chivalry (1964) to stand alongside his blade typology.See also myarmoury.com for an online summary. Oakeshott pommel types are enumerated with capital letters A‚ÄìZ, with subtypes indicated by numerals.  Grip  right The grip is the handle of the sword. It is usually made of wood or metal and often covered with shagreen (untanned tough leather or shark skin). Shark skin proved to be the most durable in temperate climates but deteriorates in hot climates. Consequently, rubber became popular in the latter half of the 19th century. Many sword types alternatively opt for ray skin, referred to in katana construction as the \\"same.\\" Whatever material covers the grip, it is usually both glued on and wrapped with wire in a helix.  Guard  The guard is just above the grip. It is a common misconception that the cross-guard protects the wielder's entire hand from the opposing sword; only with the abandonment of the shield and then the armoured gauntlet did a full hand guard become necessary. The crossguard still protected the user from a blade that was deliberately slid down the length of the blade to cut off or injure the hand. Early swords do not have true guards but simply a form of stop to prevent the hand slipping up the blade when thrusting as they were invariably used in conjunction with a shield. From the 11th century, European sword guards took the form of a straight crossbar (later called \\"quillon\\") perpendicular to the blade. Beginning in the 16th century in Europe, guards became more and more elaborate, with additional loops and curved bars or branches to protect the hand. A single curved piece alongside the fingers (roughly parallel with the handle/blade and perpendicular to any crossguards) was referred to as a knuckle-bow.FineDictionary citation of Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary: \\"the curved part of a sword-guard that covers the fingers\\" Ultimately, the bars could be supplemented or replaced with metal plates that could be ornamentally pierced. The term \\"basket hilt\\" eventually came into vogue to describe such designs, and there are a variety of basket- hilted swords. Simultaneously, emphasis upon the thrust attack with rapiers and smallswords revealed a vulnerability to thrusting. By the 17th century, guards were developed that incorporated a solid shield that surrounded the blade out to a diameter of up to two inches or more. Older forms of this guard retained the quillons or a single quillon, but later forms eliminated the quillons, altogether being referred to as a cup-hilt. This latter form is the basis of the guards of modern foils and √©p√©es.  Ricasso  The ricasso is a blunt section of blade just below the guard. On developed hilts it is protected by an extension of the guard.David Haring, ed. \\"The Complete Encyclopedia of Weapons\\" Gallery Press, 1980, p. 48 On two-handed swords, the ricasso provided a third hand position, permitting the user's hands to be further apart for better leverage.  Sword knot  Germany 19th century: Various colours and tassels of sword knots. German cavalry officers' Stichdegen (dress sword) with sword knot, or Troddel. When worn, the sword knot is wrapped around the sword guard, or sometimes looped though a slot in the guard. The sword knot or sword strap, sometimes called a tassel, is a lanyard‚Äîusually of leather but sometimes of woven gold or silver bullion, or more often metallic lace‚Äîlooped around the hand to prevent the sword being lost if it is dropped. Although they have a practical function, sword knots often had a decorative design. For example, the British Army generally adopted a white leather strap with a large acorn knot made out of gold wire for infantry officers at the end of the 19th century. Such acorn forms of tassels were called 'boxed', which was the way of securing the fringe of the tassel along its bottom line such that the strands could not separate and become entangled or lost. Many sword knots were also made of silk with a fine, ornamental alloy gold or silver metal wire woven into it in a specified pattern. The art and history of tassels are known by its French name, passementerie, or Posamenten as it was called in German. The military output of the artisans called passementiers (ornamental braid, lace, cord, or trimmings makers) is evident in catalogs of various military uniform and regalia makers of centuries past. The broader art form of passementerie, with its divisions of Decor, Clergy and Nobility, Upholstery, Coaches and Livery, and Military, is covered in a few books on that subject, none of which are in English. Indian swords had the tassel attached through an eyelet at the end of the pommel. Chinese swords, both jian and dao, often have lanyards or tassels attached. As with Western sword knots, these serve both decorative and practical functions, and the manipulation of the tassel is a part of some jian performances.  Hilt ring  Silver sword hilt ring The hilt ring is an optional item used for decoration.

From the middle of the way he was accompanied by a lifeguard on a rope but Marcin refused to connect a safety rope and climbed to the top without any help. South-east view, from the Boulevard Edgar Quinet Criticism The tower's simple architecture, large proportions and monolithic appearance have been often criticised for being out of place in Paris's urban landscape.Montparnasse Tower, a story of passion and hate since 40 years As a result, two years after its completion the construction of buildings over seven storeys high in the city centre was banned. The design of the tower predates architectural trends of more modern skyscrapers today that are often designed to provide a window for every office. Only the offices around the perimeter of each floor of Tour Montparnasse have windows. It is said that the tower's observation deck enjoys the most beautiful view in all of Paris because it is the only place from which the tower cannot be seen. A 2008 poll of editors on Virtualtourist voted the building the second-ugliest building in the world, behind Boston City Hall in the United States. Asbestos contamination In 2005, studies showed that the tower contained asbestos material. When inhaled, for instance during repairs, asbestos is a carcinogen. Monitoring revealed that legal limits of fibers per liter were surpassed and, on at least one occasion, reached 20 times the legal limit. Due to health and legal concerns, some tenants abandoned their offices in the building. The problem of removing the asbestos material from a large building used by thousands of people is unique. The projected completion time for removal was cited as three years. After a nearly three year delay, removal began in 2009 alongside regular operation of the building. In 2012, it was reported the Maine-Montparnasse Tower was 90% free of asbestos.

His presidency was characterized by the entrenchment of the neoliberal, free trade economic policies initiated by his predecessor Miguel de la Madrid in observance of the Washington Consensus, mass privatizations of state-run companies, Mexico's entry into NAFTA, negotiations with the right- wing opposition party PAN to recognize their victories in gubernatorial elections in exchange for supporting Salinas' policies, normalization of relations with the Catholic clergy,Jorge A.

Article 6. and the adoption of a new currency, among other things. From the beginning of his administration Salinas de Gortari was constantly criticized by the left (which considered him an illegitimate president who took office by means of electoral fraud) for his neoliberal policies, which increased the unemployment rate and were perceived as giving away the wealth of the nation to foreign ownership. At the same time, Salinas was praised by the right wing and by the international community during his first five years in office as a leading figure of globalization and they credited him with \\"modernizing\\" the country. Salinas was also backed by the United States government in his bid for the Presidency of the newly created World Trade Organization (WTO). After years of steady economic growth during his presidency, a series of events in 1994 quickly crumbled his public image domestically and internationally, as his last year in office revealed Salinas had failed to address social inequity in the country, quickly followed by revelations of Salinas's mismanagement and corruption within his inner circle. These events included the Zapatista uprising, the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio (Salinas's hand-picked successor and PRI candidate for the 1994 presidential elections) and the assassination of Jos√© Francisco Ruiz Massieu, Salinas's brother-in-law and PRI Secretary-General. This surge of political violence led to economic uncertainty. Facing pressures to devalue the peso, Salinas stood firm, opting for a strategy he believed would help his candidacy to be the inaugural president of the WTO. As a consequence, less than a month after Salinas left office, Mexico entered into one of the worst economic crises of its history. Shortly after, his brother Ra√∫l Salinas de Gortari was arrested for ordering the assassination of Ruiz MassieuSalinas's Brother Charged in Mexican Assassination New York Times March 1, 1995 and was subsequently indicted on charges of drug trafficking. Salinas then left the country for many years. Salinas is often referred to as the most unpopular former president of Mexico. A 2005 nationwide poll conducted by Parametr√≠a found that 73% of the respondents had a negative image of him, while only 9% stated that they had a positive image of the former president. Early life and education Carlos Salinas was born 3 April 1948, the second son and one of five children of economist and government official Ra√∫l Salinas Lozano and Margarita De Gortari De Salinas. Salinas's father served as President Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos's minister of industry and commerce, but was passed over as the PRI's presidential candidate in favor of Gustavo D√≠az Ordaz (1964‚Äì70). When Carlos Salinas was chosen the PRI's presidential candidate for the 1988 election, he told his father, \\"It took us more than 20 years, but we made it.\\"quoted in Jane Bussey, \\"Carlos Salinas de Gortari\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, vol. 2, p. 1330. A tragedy occurred early in Carlos Salinas's life. On 18 December 1951, when he was three years old, he was playing with his older brother Ra√∫l, then five, and an eight-year-old friend when they found a loaded rifle, and one of them shot and killed the Salinas family's twelve-year-old maid, Manuela. It was never determined which of the three boys pulled the trigger, and the incident was declared an accident; it was given newspaper coverage in Exc√©lsior and La Prensa at the time. A judge blamed the Salinas parents for leaving a loaded weapon accessible to their small children.Alexander Cockburn, \\"Beat the Devil: Harvard and Murder: The Case of Carlos Salinas\\", The Nation 29 May 1995, 747-745. Cockburn builds his article around accounts in the Mexican newspaper Exc√©lsior, especially Alberto R. de Aguilar, \\"Tres Ni√±itos 'Fusilaron' a una Sirvienta\\", Exc√©lsior 18 December 1951, 1. The Salinas family did not know the last name of their 12-year-old maid Manuela‚Äîonly that she came from San Pedro Atzcapotzaltongo‚Äîand it is unknown whether her family ever claimed her body.Cockburn, \\"The Case of Carlos Salinas\\", 745. They were also exonerated with the assistance of Gilberto Bola√±os Cacho, maternal uncle of legendary Mexican comedian Chespirito, who is also nephew to Gustavo D√≠az Ordaz, who became president of Mexico in 1964. He has not commented publicly on this tragic early childhood incident.Bussey, \\"Carlos Salinas de Gortari\\", p. 1330. Salinas attended the National Autonomous University of Mexico as an undergraduate, studying economics. He was an undergraduate when the student movement in Mexico organized against the 1968 Summer Olympics, but there is no evidence of his participation. He was an active member of the PRI youth movement and a political club, the Revolutionary Policy and Professional Association, whose members continued to be his close friends when he was president. Salinas was a skilled dressage horseman, and was a member of the Mexico national team at the Pan-American Games in Cali, Colombia, in 1971. Salinas was one of the Mexicans of his generation who studied at elite foreign universities. He earned a master's degree in Public Administration from Harvard University in 1973 and went on to earn a PhD from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government in 1978. His doctoral dissertation was published as Political Participation, Public Investment and Support for the System: A Comparative Study of Rural Communities in Mexico.Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Political Participation, Public Investment and Support for the System: A Comparative Study of Rural Communities in Mexico. La Jolla, CA: Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies, University of California, San Diego 1982. Personal life Salinas met his future first wife, Cecilia Yolanda Occelli Gonz√°lez, in 1958 when he was just ten years old. They began dating in 1965 when he was 17-years old and she was 16-years old. However, the relationship ended in 1968 when Salinas moved to the United States to study economics. In 1971, Salinas and Occelli reconnected in Williamsburg, Virginia, in the United States. They were engaged soon and married on April 15, 1972, in a ceremony in Mexico City. They moved to Boston, where Salinas was completing his master's and doctorate at Harvard University. The couple discovered that Occelli was pregnant with their first child during Salinas' first semester at Harvard. Their oldest daughter, Cecilia, was born on January 22, 1974. Occelli and Salinas had two more children: Emiliano, who was born on February 19, 1976, and Juan Cristobal, who was born in 1979. Cecilia Occelli Gonz√°lez served as First Lady of Mexico from 1988 to 1994 during the Salinas presidency. Soon after leaving office, Salinas traveled to New York City to take a break from Mexican politics. He returned to Mexico from the United States in 1995, where he immediately asked his wife for a divorce. The couple divorced later in 1995. Salinas married his second wife, Ana Paula Gerard Rivero, shortly after his divorce from Occelli. It is believed that Salinas originally met Gerard in 1983 at the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico Aut√≥nomo de M√©xico, where he was teaching at the time, though that story remains unconfirmed. Gerard later worked as a technical secretary for the Economic Cabinet of the Salinas administration. The couple had three children. Gerard gave birth to their eldest daughter, Ana Emilia Margarita, in January 1996. Patricio Ger√≥nimo Gerardo was born 1998, while their youngest son, Mateo, was born in 2006. Early political career Salinas was tapped by President Miguel de la Madrid to serve as Minister of Planning and Budget in 1982, a position that De la Madrid himself had previously held. It was a key cabinet position since Mexico was in dire financial circumstances following the presidency of Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo, who as a desperate measure had nationalized the banks in Mexico and expropriated dollar-denominated savings accounts. The country held no hard currency reserves, exhaustion of foreign credit, and soaring interest rates. the Ministries of Finance and Planning and Budget became the most powerful positions to deal with the economic crisis. In the cabinet, Salinas's main rival was Jes√∫s Silva Herzog, Minister of Finance. In the internecine politics that would decide who would succeed De la Madrid as president, Salinas sought to destroy the reputation of Silva Herzog. Another key figure in the cabinet was Manuel Bartlett, Minister of the Interior, with whom Salinas forged a non-compete alliance. Salinas also forged other alliances within the circles of power and did not directly compete with De la Madrid for public attention. Silva Herzog made missteps in his ministry, which Salinas capitalized on, forcing his resignation.Casta√±eda, Perpetuating Power, pp. 63-68 Presidential election 1988 \\"Not in their worst nightmares could the lords of the PRI have imagined what would happen to them on the sixth of July 1988. As they had done six years before, the electorate came out to vote, but not in support of the official candidate. They came to the voting booths to punish him.\\"Enrique Krauze, Mexico: Biography of Power. New York: HarperCollins 1997, p. 770. Carlos Salinas had become presidential candidate in a difficult time for the PRI which for the first time was faced by significant opposition from the left (National Democratic Front) and from the right (National Action Party, PAN). The candidate of the PAN was Manuel Clouthier. Cuauht√©moc C√°rdenas Sol√≥rzano, son of President L√°zaro C√°rdenas, registered as an opposing candidate from a left-wing coalition called Frente Democr√°tico Nacional. He rapidly became a popular figure, and became the first opposing candidate to fill the Z√≥calo with sympathizers and to seriously threaten the PRI, which had won all presidential elections since its inception in 1929. The Ministry of the Interior (Secretar√≠a de Gobernaci√≥n), through its Federal Electoral Commission, was the institution in charge of the electoral process, and installed a modern computing system to count the votes. On election day July 6, 1988, the system \\"crashed\\", and when it was finally restored, Carlos Salinas was declared the official winner. Even though the elections are extremely controversial, and some maintain that Salinas won legally, the expression se cay√≥ el sistema (\\"the system crashed\\") became a colloquial euphemism for electoral fraud. As one observer put it, \\"For the ordinary citizen, it was not the computer network but the Mexican political system that had crashed.\\"Krauze, Mexico: Biography of Power. p. 770. The process involved two suspicious shutdowns of the computer system used to keep track of the number of votes. Suspicions later grew as Congress voted (with support from the Revolutionary Institutional and National Action parties) to destroy without opening the electoral documentation. Other people believed that Salinas, in fact, won the ballot, albeit probably not with an absolute majority as the official figures suggested, although that is not required under Mexican election law. During a television interview in September 2005, Miguel de la Madrid acknowledged that the PRI lost the 1988 elections. However, he immediately clarified his comment by saying that the PRI had \\"at least lost a significant amount of voters\\". Asked for comment on De la Madrid's statements, Senator Manuel Bartlett, who was the president of the Federal Electoral Commission (Comisi√≥n Federal Electoral) during the De la Madrid administration, declared Salinas won the election albeit with the smallest margin of any PRI candidate before him. He attributed De la Madrid's remarks to his old age (71 years old ) and the remarks being taken out of context by journalist Carlos Loret de Mola. Ex-president Miguel de la Madrid admitted that the elections had been rigged. Presidency 1988‚Äì1994 =Cabinet= thumbright250pxCarlos Salinas walks through the gardens of the Moncloa Palace with Felipe Gonz√°lez in 1989. Salinas assumed the presidency on 1 December 1988 at the Legislative Palace of San L√°zaro. There he took oath before the Congress of the Union. As the declared winner of a highly contested election, he had the task of restoring his own legitimacy and that of his party when he took office.Bussey, \\"Carlos Salinas de Gotari\\", p. 1331 The election had shown that much of the public desired reform, but Salinas appointed PRI hard-liners (\\"dinosaurs\\") to his cabinet, including Fernando Guti√©rrez Barrios to the Ministry of the Interior; Manuel Bartlett to the Ministry of Education; and Carlos Hank Gonz√°lez to Agriculture.Krauze, Mexico: Biography of Power, p. 775 The cabinet was cohesive in support of Salinas's neoliberal policies. Many ministers were technocrats with graduate academic degrees, a profile similar to Salinas's. Although there was opposition to many of Salinas's policies, it came from outside the cabinet.Roderic Ai Camp, \\"Camarillas in Mexican Politics: The Case of the Salinas Cabinet\\". Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos 6, Winter 1990Miguel Angel Centeno, Democracy Within Reason: Technocratic Revolution in Mexico. University Park: Penn State University Press 1994 Over the course of his presidency, he moved or replaced a number of cabinet ministers. A key replacement in January 1994 immediately after the Chiapas conflict was at the Ministry of the Interior (Gobernaci√≥n), appointing Jorge Carpizo, who had been head of the government National Human Rights Commission and previously was rector of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. When the PRI candidate in the 1994 elections, Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated in March 1994, new restrictions barring cabinet ministers who had not resigned in the six months previous to the election date from being candidates for the presidency meant that Salinas had a small pool of eligible choices. =Domestic issues= In his inaugural address in December 1988, he outlined an ambitious and important goal of \\"modernizing\\" Mexico.\\"Roberto Blancarte, \\"Recent Changes in Church-State Relations in Mexico: An Historical Approach\\". Journal of Church and State Autumn 1993, Vol. 35, Issue 4, p. 1. He contended that \\"The modernization of Mexico is essential if we are to meet the demands of the 85 million Mexicans of today.... In brief, we need to modernize politics, the economy, and society. The modernization of Mexico is, moreover, an absolute imperative. This is the only way we will be able to affirm our sovereignty in a world undergoing profound transformation.\\"Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Inaugural Address (Dec. 1, 1988) quoted in Jorge A. Vargas, \\"Freedom of Religion and Public Worship in Mexico: A Legal Commentary on the 1992 Act on Religious Matters\\". BYU Law Review, 421 (1998), issue 2. Article 6, fn. 40. During his six-year term in office (sexenio) major changes were made to the Constitution of 1917 that affected political reform; church-state relations, ending many aspects of anticlericalism restricting the Catholic Church and other religious organizations; agrarian reform, ending redistribution of land under Article 27; and policy changes on \\"indigenous peoples, human rights, economic activities of the state, [and] criminal due process.\\" First steps Immediately upon his inauguration, he arrested prominent union leaders, many of whom were his opponents in the PRI, among other measures to demonstrate his determination to set his own course. His government privatized state-run companies, including Tel√©fonos de M√©xico, sold to PRI-insider Carlos Slim, as well as re-privatizing banks that President Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo had nationalized at the end of his term. The funds from these sales of state assets helped pay off Mexico's internal debt. However, there were also bailouts for banks and the Mexican toll roads that became scandals.Bussey, \\"Carlos Salinas de Gortari\\", p. 1331 Economic policy Salinas continued with the neoliberal economic policy of his predecessor Miguel de la Madrid and converted Mexico into a regulatory state.Remonda Bensabat Kleinberg, \\"Strategic Alliances: State‚ÄêBusiness Relations in Mexico Under Neo‚ÄêLiberalism and Crisis.\\" Bulletin of Latin American Research 18.1 (1999): 71-87. During his presidential term, he aggressively privatized hundreds of state-run companies, including telecommunications, steel, and mining. The banking system (that had been nationalized by Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo) was privatized.Williams, Mark Eric. ‚ÄúLearning the Limits of Power: Privatization and State-Labor Interactions in Mexico.‚Äù Latin American Politics and Society, vol. 43, no. 4, 2001, p. 91. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3177032. His National Development Plan (Plan Nacional de Desarrollo) published in 1989 had 4 objectives: # Protecting sovereignty # Democracy # Economic recovery # Improving the living standard. By the end of his term, inflation had been reduced to 7% in 1994, the lowest figure in 22 years. Shortly after leaving office, due to the so- called December Mistake, inflation rose again to 51%. During his term, the peso devalued from 2.65 MXP to 3.60 MXN per U.S. dollar by November 30, 1994, the last day of his term; thus the peso devalued far less than it had in the two previous terms. (The peso was later devalued from 4 per dollar to 7.2 in a single week due to the \\"December Mistake.\\") Poverty alleviation Salinas established the National Solidarity Program (PRONASOL), a social welfare program, as a way to directly aid poor Mexicans, but also create a network of support for Salinas.Bruhn, Kathleen. \\"Social spending and political support: The\\" lessons\\" of the National Solidarity Program in Mexico.\\" Comparative Politics (1996): 151-177. It was his first official act as president. The program channeled public funds, which the administration said came largely from privatization of state-owned companies, into impoverished areas to improve roads, the electrical grid, schools, and clinics in order to raise levels of education and health and link remote areas, with lack of oversight in its spending.Paul Lawrence Haber, \\"Neoliberalism\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1016.Bussey, \\"Carlos Salinas de Gortari\\", pp. 1331-32 The program was similar to those in other countries to manage the disruption and political costs of macroeconomic adjustment. Salinas's Harvard doctoral dissertation had examined the relationship between social programs and political support for the government. Given the Salinas's questionable legitimacy as the winner of the 1988 election, PRONASOL was seen as a way for Salinas to deliver immediate benefits to the poor and avert their turning to other political parties or worse. It did not prioritize funding for Mexico's poorest states, but rather to states with middle-income populations where elections were most contested and where the PRI had lost. Politically, the program sought to undermine the appeal of leftists, especially Cuauht√©moc C√°rdenas.Haber, \\"Neoliberalism\\", p. 1016. In Chiapas, PRONASOL channeled increased funds in 1993 and 1994, but it did not prevent the Zapatista uprising, which showed that the program had only a limited impact.Jonathan Fox, \\"Programa Nacional de Solidaridad, (PRONASOL)\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1360-1362Cornelius, Wayne, Ann Craig, and Jonathan Fox, eds. Transforming State-Society Relation in Mexico: The National Solidarity Strategy. LaJolla: Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies, University of California, San Diego 1994. Church-State relations The Catholic Church and the Mexican government has had a historically fraught relationship, with restrictions on the church's role in national life. In the 1980s, the church saw electoral participation reform and fighting electoral fraud as an issue. Sometime during the presidential campaign, the PRI had indicated to the Church that a Salinas victory would be beneficial to the Church. It has been considered a quid pro quo agreement.Tangeman, Mexico at the Crossroads, see esp. chapter 5, \\"Salinismo, the Church, and Quid Pro Quo\\". A delegation of the leadership of the episcopal hierarchy attended the inauguration of Salinas on December 1, 1988.Tangeman, Mexico at the Crossroads p. 71-72. After the 1988 election the Mexican bishops did not make public statements about the election results. Behind the scenes the apostolic delegate to Mexico, the Vatican's representative, Mexican bishops, and government officials had a series of secret meetings that hammered out the outlines of a new Church-State relationship. In his inaugural address, Salinas de Gortari announced a program to \\"modernize\\" Mexico via structural transformation. \\"The modern state is a state which ... maintains transparency and updates its relation with political parties, entrepreneurial groups, and the church.\\"Salinas, quoted in Roberto Blancarte, \\"Recent Changes in Church-State Relations in Mexico: An Historical Approach.\\" Journal of Church & State, Autumn 1993, vol. 35. No. 4. His declaration was more an articulation of the direction of change, but not list of specifics. The implementation of reforms entailed amending the 1917 constitution, but before that overcoming opposition on the Left but also in the Catholic Church itself.Blancarte, \\"Recent Changes in Church-State Relations in Mexico\\", p. 2. After considerable debate, the Mexican legislature voted for fundamental revisions in Church-State policy.Jorge A. Vargas, \\"Freedom of Religion and Public Worship in Mexico: A Legal Commentary on the 1992 Federal Act on Religious Matters.\\" BYU Law Review Vol. 1998, issue 2, article 6, p. 433.Jorge A. Vargas, \\"Mexico‚Äôs Legal Revolution: An Appraisal of Its Recent Constitutional Changes, 1988‚Äì1995.\\" 25 Georgia Journal of International and Comparative Law, 497-559 (1996). Electoral reform In the wake of the highly controversial 1988 election results, the government initiated a series of electoral reforms. A major change was the creation of the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) in October 1990, taking elections out of the hands of the Ministry of the Interior to create an independent entity. The 1994 elections were the first to have international observers, and were considered, at that time, the fairest elections in the century, although not free of controversy. For the first time, the PRI lost its two-thirds majority in Congress, which is necessary to conduct constitutional reforms. Human rights In 1990, the National Human Rights Commission (Comisi√≥n Nacional de los Derechos Humanos) was created. Initially a government agency, it became a separate entity, Education In 1992, Salinas and his Secretary of Education, Ernesto Zedillo introduced new compulsory history texts in Mexican schools, part of the Mexican Free-Textbook Program. Authored by Enrique Florescano and H√©ctor Aguilar Cam√≠n, the new textbooks set off a storm of controversy. Shifts in emphasis concerned the Porfiriato and the role of foreign investment, Emiliano Zapata, lauding him as a hero despite his having opposed every government in power; U.S.-Mexico relations, avoiding negative treatment of the history; and the Catholic Church in Mexico, treating it dispassionately. The government was compelled to withdraw them in January 1993. According to one assessment, \\"While the 1992 textbook controversy disclosed new support for the regime from the right, it also revealed an erosion of support and discipline within officialdom.\\"Dennis Gilbert, \\"Rewriting History: Salinas, Zedillo and the 1992 Textbook Controversy.\\" Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos 13(2), summer 1997 p. 295. =North American Free Trade Agreement= Carlos Salinas (left), George H. W. Bush, and Brian Mulroney during the NAFTA Initialing Ceremony in Austin, Texas. NAFTA logo The centerpiece of Salinas's presidency was his successful negotiation with the U.S. and Canada to create the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which came into effect on 1 January 1994. The agreement was a reversal of Mexico's longstanding policies of economic nationalism and anti- Americanism and was intended to create a single market. Mexican proponents of NAFTA saw it in a way to secure markets for its exports and attract foreign investment, and create jobs, help the government to be able to service its foreign debt, and overall, promote economic recovery. In Mexico, the reversal was controversial, opposed by organized labor, many academics, and nongovernmental organizations.Luz Mar√≠a de la Mora, \\"North American Free Trade Agreement\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1021-22. =Drug trafficking and corruption= An issue of importance both domestic and foreign policy is drug trafficking. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Mexico was a transit country for cocaine produced in Colombia and destined for consumers in the United States. President De la Madrid considered drug trafficking a national security issue and devoted government funding to it. Salinas expanded this funding, but neither president stemmed the growth of trafficking and its impact on Mexico. Drug trafficking is highly lucrative for those involved with it, and Mexico's weak law enforcement and judicial system could not prevent the wide-scale involvement of Mexico's poorly-paid police from being corrupted. The Mexican military to a lesser extent was corrupted, along with politicians, and some journalists. Such corruption undermined the possibility of rule of law and it prevented Mexicans from having trust in the state. A rising level of violence by drug traffickers against the state, witnesses, journalists, and bystanders.Maria Celila Toro, \\"Drug Trade\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 419-20. The Mexican government did capture and jail some high-level drug mafia leaders, including Miguel √Ångel F√©lix Gallardo in 1989, whose arrest made visible the extent of law enforcement collusion.https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/16/world/in-mexico-drug-roots-run- deep.html?pagewanted=1 accessed 24 March 2019. =Foreign policy= Salinas negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), with the United States and Canada. Salinas also renegotiated Mexico's foreign debt. In 1990, Salinas had traveled to Europe to attract non-North American capital investment, but dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc opened them to foreign investment; Mexico was less attractive to them and Salinas turned to North America.Luz Mar√≠a de la Mora, \\"North American Free Trade Agreement\\", p. 1021. Critics say that NAFTA has had mixed results for Mexico: while there has been huge increase in commerce and foreign investment, this has not been at all the case for employment and salaries. In 1992, Mexico hosted the Chapultepec Peace Accords, a venue where the parties in the civil war in El Salvador signed an accord ending the long conflict.Diana Negroponte, \\"Implementation of the Chapultepec Peace Accords\\" in Seeking Peace in El Salvador: The Struggle to Reconstruct a Nation at the End of the Cold War. New York: Palgrave MacMillan 2012 Mexico reestablished diplomatic relations with the Vatican. Moreover, Mexico became member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The First Ibero-American Summit was held and the Chapultepec Peace Accords, a peace agreement for El Salvador, were signed. Salinas in 1991 visited United States to help convince the Illinois Governor, James R. Thompson to pardon four Mexican citizens from a quadruple murder known as the Milwaukee Ave Massacre, that took place in 1981 in Chicago, Illinois. With the help of Carlos Salinas de Gortari the four men, Joaquin Varela, Rogelio Arroyo, Ignacio Varela, and Isauro Sanchez, had their sentences commuted, later pardoned by Governor Jim Edgar. 1994 Election year As the 1994 presidential election approached, Salinas had the crucial decision to designate the candidate for the PRI; that person had always gone on to win the presidential election. \\"The shipwreck of the 1988 succession should have sufficed to teach Salinas to prevent another disaster from befalling the system he had inherited.\\"Casta√±eda, Perpetuating Power, p. 89. At the time Salinas made the choice, popularity and credibility was high over the course of his presidency,Villarreal, Andres. ‚ÄúPublic Opinion of the Economy and the President among Mexico City Residents: The Salinas Sexenio.‚Äù Latin American Research Review, vol. 34, no. 2, 1999, p. 131 JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2503915 accessed 21 March 2019 but a series of events in the final year of his presidency changed that. =Choosing the PRI Nominee= The \\"unveiling\\" of the PRI candidate for the presidency was on 28 November 1993, with Salinas choosing Luis Donaldo Colosio. Those considered for the position were Manuel Camacho and Colosio, with earlier contenders, such as Jes√∫s Silva Herzog and Pedro Aspe being eliminated. Aspe, a graduate of MIT had a high international profile, but was considered unlikely to actually attract voters. The changed circumstances of the Mexican political system, as demonstrated by Salinas's own election to the presidency, meant that being designated the PRI did not guarantee election. Aspe was not a charismatic prospect as a candidate who could energize and charm voters. With the potential that Cuauht√©moc C√°rdenas was likely to run again for the presidency, the PRI needed to field someone who could garner votes.Casta√±eda, Perpetuating Power, pp. 92-96. =Zapatista rebellion= Flag of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) The uprising in Chiapas on 1 January 1994 coincided with the date that the NAFTA came into effect. The Zapatista Army of National Liberation (Ej√©rcito Zapatista de Liberaci√≥n Nacional, EZLN) issued their first declaration from the state of Chiapas in southern Mexico. Salinas's immediate response was to find for a peaceful solution: offering pardon to deposed arms; ordering a cease fire; appointing a peace negotiator, and sending Mexican Congress a General Amnesty Law. Salinas's presidential successor took a harder line when he was inaugurated. But Salinas's more peaceful solution Zapatista uprising was legal and politically pragmatic, likely saving many lives in Mexico. The Zapatista rebellion did not spread regionally or nationwide, but the fact that it happened and that international attention was drawn to this poor region of Mexico just as NAFTA was implemented meant that Salinas's careful plans for a peaceful political transition with his legacy intact were obliterated.Casta√±eda, Perpetuating Power, p. 106 Salinas appointed Manuel Camacho, Minister of Foreign Affairs, as the government's peace mediator. For Salinas, this had political benefits, since Camacho, having been passed over as the PRI presidential candidate, could have bolted from the party. With this important appointment, he was in the public limelight again.Casta√±eda, Perpetuating Power, p. 107. =Assassination of Colosio and the new PRI Candidate= Bust of Colosio at Los Pinos A spectacular political event of 1994 was the assassination of Salinas's handpicked PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio in March 1994, upending the already complex electoral situation with elections scheduled for August 1994. The Zapatista uprising had ruined Salinas's plans for a peaceful transition of Mexico in the elections. There is evidence that Salinas and Colosio began to disagree, not unusual after the electoral transfer, but this occurred prior to it. His campaign languished with lack of funding, Colosio had problems getting media coverage, given the high-profile events in Chiapas. Salinas prevented Colosio from going to Chiapas, while the explanation that his presence there would complicate the situation. Increasingly there was the impression that Salinas would reverse his decision for Colosio, substituting someone else, perhaps Manuel Camacho. Camacho was a politically savvy former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Head of Government of Mexico City as well as Peace Commissioner in Chiapas. Salinas made a public statement on 17 January 1994, affirming his choice as candidate, but this was at the insistence of Colosio. Salinas extracted a pledge from Camacho that he had no designs on the presidency, which he renounced the day before Colosio's assassination in Tijuana 23 March 1994.Casta√±eda, Perpetuating Power, pp. 108- 109 After a few days of weighing his options, Salinas chose Colosio's campaign manager, Ernesto Zedillo, former Minister of Education, as the new PRI candidate for the presidency. Zedillo had been Secretary of Education, a relatively unimportant ministry; he had resigned to run the campaign of Colosio. Zedillo had never held elective office, sharing that trait with De la Madrid and Salinas, but Zedillo was not otherwise experienced politically. He was perceived as a weak candidate. There are speculation that Salinas wished to perpetuate his power as Plutarco El√≠as Calles had in the wake of the 1928 assassination of president-elect Alvaro Obreg√≥n, controlling successor presidents.Thomas Legler, \\"Ernesto Zedillo\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1641 =1994 General Election= After considering whether to postpone the general election scheduled for 21 August 1994, Salinas chose Zedillo to run as the PRI candidate for the presidency and the elections took place as scheduled. Voters came out in large numbers to choose between three main candidates, Zedillo for the PRI, C√°rdenas for the Party of Democratic Revolution, and Diego Fern√°ndez de Cevallos for the PAN. Zedillo won a clear victory, in what were considered by foreign observers as free and fair. In results published by the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), Zedillo got 48.7%, Cevallos 25.9%, and C√°rdenas 16.6%.https://web.archive.org/web/20061115072642/http://www.ife.org.mx/documentos/RESELEC/nuevo_1994/pres_94/nac_edo/nac_pre_94.html accessed 25 March 2019 =Another political assassination= Following the election in September 1994, Secretary General of the PRI Jos√© Francisco Ruiz Massieu, Salinas' former brother-in-law, was assassinated in downtown Mexico City in broad daylight. The murder was not solved during Salinas's presidency, even when Mario Ruiz Massieu (Francisco's brother) was the attorney general and in charge of the investigation. =Economic issues= The economic bubble gave Mexico a prosperity not seen in a generation. This period of rapid growth coupled with low inflation prompted some political thinkers and the media to state that Mexico was on the verge of becoming a \\"First World nation\\". In fact, it was the first of the \\"newly industrialized nations\\" to be admitted into the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in May 1994. It was known that the peso was overvalued, but the extent of the Mexican economy's vulnerability was either not well known or downplayed by both the Salinas administration and the media. This vulnerability was further aggravated by several unexpected events and macroeconomic mistakes made in the last year of his administration. Several economists and historians have analyzed some of the events and policy mistakes that precipitated the crisis of December 1994.Hufbauer and Schoot, (2005) In keeping with the PRI election- year practices, Salinas launched a spending spree to finance popular projects, which translated into a historically high deficit. This budget deficit was coupled with a current account deficit, fueled by excessive consumer spending as allowed by the overvalued peso. In order to finance this deficit, the Salinas administration issued tesobonos, an attractive debt instrument that insured payment in dollars instead of pesos. Increasing current account deficit fostered by government spending, caused alarm among Mexican and foreign T-bill (tesobono) investors, who sold them rapidly, thereby depleting the already-low central bank reserves (which eventually hit a record low of $9 billion). The economically orthodox thing to do, in order to maintain the fixed exchange rate (at 3.3 pesos per dollar, within a variation band), would have been to sharply increase interest rates by allowing the monetary base to shrink, as dollars were being withdrawn from the reserves.Hufbauer & Schott, 2005 Given the fact that it was an election year, whose outcome might have changed as a result of a pre-election-day economic downturn, the Bank of Mexico decided to buy Mexican Treasury Securities in order to maintain the monetary base, and thus prevent the interest rates from rising. This, in turn, caused an even more dramatic decline in the dollar reserves. These decisions aggravated the already delicate situation, to a point at which a crisis became inevitable and devaluation was only one of many necessary adjustments. Successor first days crises =Peso devaluation= Soon after taking office, Zedillo announced that his government would let the fixed exchange rate band increase 15 percent (up to 4 pesos per US$), by stopping the unorthodox measures employed by the previous administration to keep it at the previous fixed level (e.g., by selling dollars, assuming debt, and so on). This measure, however, was not enough, and the government was unable to hold this line, and decided to let the exchange rate float. While experts agree that devaluation was necessary, some critics of Zedillo's 22-day-old administration argue that, although economically coherent, the way the crisis was handled was a political mistake. By having announced its plans for devaluation, they argue that many foreigners withdrew their investments, thus aggravating the effects. Whether the effects were aggravated further or not, the result was that the peso crashed under a floating regime from four pesos to the dollar (with the previous increase of 15%) to 7.2 to the dollar in the space of a week. Mexican businesses with debts to be paid in dollars, or that relied on supplies bought from the United States, suffered an immediate hit, with mass industrial lay-offs and several suicides. To make matters worse, the devaluation announcement was made mid-week, on a Wednesday, and for the remainder of the week foreign investors fled the Mexican market without any government action to prevent or discourage the flight until the following Monday, when it was too late. Salinas faced widespread criticism in Mexico. He was widely blamed for the collapse of the economy and his privatization of several government-run businesses such as Telmex. With respect to the collapse of the economy, he rapidly responded by blaming Zedillo's \\"inept\\" handling of the situation, coining the term \\"December mistake\\" to refer to the crisis and Zedillo's mistakes. He then argued that he had talked to Zedillo of a possibility of \\"sharing the burden\\" of the devaluation by allowing the peso to devaluate a certain percent before his term was over, and the rest of the necessary devaluation would have been done during Zedillo's administration. =Zapatista Crisis= Initially the Zedillo administration followed Salinas's policies regarding the negotiations with the Zapatistas, pledging to reach a peaceful resolution to the Chiapas crisis. Zedillo then reversed course and on February 9, 1995, identifying Subcomandante Marcos to be Rafael Sebasti√°n Guill√©n Vicente, and pursued military intervention. He abandoned that unsuccessful strategy and peace talks were subsequently re-established. Zedillo's zigzag policies in Chiapas were consistent with some others of his administration.Thomas Legler, \\"Ernesto Zedillo\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Fitzroy Dearborn 1997 p. 1641 =Break with Zedillo, Ra√∫l Salinas arrest and self-exile= Ernesto Zedillo had been an accidental presidential candidate who had no political experience or independent base of power. There was a perception that Salinas wanted to follow the precedent of Plutarco El√≠as Calles who wielded tremendous power over three successor presidents following the 1928 assassination of president-elect Alvaro Obreg√≥n.Legler, \\"Ernesto Zedillo\\" p. 1640 However, this changed when by order of president Zedillo Salinas's older brother Ra√∫l Salinas was arrested on 28 February 1995 under charges of orchestrating the assassination of Ruiz Massieu; the arrest dramatically shifted the political situation. Since 1940 when president L√°zaro C√°rdenas left the presidency and turned power over to his successor, Mexican former presidents had not directly intervened in politics. After the arrest of his brother, Salinas went on television, expressing his outrage at Zedillo. In the broadcast he placed the blame for the December peso crisis on Zedillo, resulting in the loss of Mexican jobs, bankruptcies, and the tarnishing of Mexico's image.Andres Oppenheimer, Bordering on Chaos: Guerrillas, Stockbrokers, Politicians, and Mexico's Road to Prosperity. Boston: Little Brown and Company 2000, p. 1996. Salinas abandoned his campaign -which had been backed by the United States- to become the Director-General of the World Trade Organization and left Mexico City, going to Monterrey where he staged a publicized hunger strike in the home of a PRI supporter. Arturo Warman, Minister of Agrarian Reform, was sent to Monterrey to persuade Salinas to return to Mexico City. Salinas demanded that the government issue a statement clearing him of responsibility for the Colosio case and the December 20 devaluation. Salinas returned to Mexico City and he and Zedillo met. Zedillo's government issued a statement absolving Salinas of the Colosio murder and tempered his criticism of Salinas in the peso crisis.Oppenheimer, Bordering on Chaos, pp. 207-08 Salinas left Mexico for self-imposed exile and settled in Ireland for a period. Post-Presidential years Salinas's reputation was to be further clouded by a series of controversies involving close family members. His brother Ra√∫l had been arrested in February 1995. In November 1995, Ra√∫l's wife, Paulina Casta√±√≥n, and his brother-in-law, Antonio Casta√±√≥n, were arrested in Geneva, Switzerland, after attempting to withdraw US$84 million from an account owned by Ra√∫l Salinas under an alias. Their capture led to the unveiling of a vast fortune spread around the world and amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, even though Ra√∫l Salinas had never officially received an annual income of more than $190,000. A report by the U.S. General Accounting Office indicated that Ra√∫l Salinas had transferred over $90 million out of Mexico into private bank accounts in London and Switzerland through a complex set of transactions between 1992 and 1994. In 2008, the government of Switzerland turned over $74 million, out of the $110 million in frozen bank accounts held by Ra√∫l Salinas, to the government of Mexico. The Swiss Justice Ministry indicated that the Mexican government had demonstrated that $66 million of the funds had been misappropriated, and the funds, with interest, were returned to Mexico. The Salinas family would not receive back any of the frozen funds. In 1997, while Salinas was in exile and his brother Ra√∫l in jail, their father, Ra√∫l Salinas Lozano was accused in a U.S court of being connected to drug dealing by a convicted Mexican trafficker, Magdalena Ruiz Pelayo; the senior Salinas denied the charges.https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/31/world/scandal-pushes-powerful- family-from-pinnacle-in-mexico.html Salinas divorced his first wife, Cecilia Occelli Gonz√°lez, in 1995 soon after leaving office. That same year he married his second wife, Ana Paula Gerard. In January 1999, after a four-year trial, Salinas' older brother Ra√∫l was convicted of ordering the murder of the PRI official (and Salinas' brother-in-law) Jos√© Francisco Ruiz Massieu and sentenced to 50 years in prison. In July 1999, an appeals court cut the sentence to 27 1/2 years. In June 2005, the conviction was overturned, and Ra√∫l Salinas was freed. On December 6, 2004, Salinas's youngest brother, Enrique, was found dead in Huixquilucan, Estado de M√©xico, inside his car with a plastic bag strapped around his head. The case remains unsolved.Killing of Ex-President's Brother is Still a Mystery https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/10/world/americas/killing-of-expresidents- brother-is-still-a-mexican-mystery.html accessed 21 March 2019 In the last years of Zedillo's term, Carlos Salinas returned to Mexico to announce the publication of his book, Mexico: The Policy and the Politics of Modernization.Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mexico: The Policy and Politics of Modernization, translated by Peter Hearn and Patricia Ross. Barcelona: Plaza & Jan√©s 2002. Written during his stay in Ireland and full of quotations from press articles and political memoirs, it defended his achievements and blamed Zedillo for the crisis that followed his administration. As of May 2010, Salinas was still living in Dublin, Ireland. Salinas also attended his son's civil wedding in Mexico City and promised to attend the subsequent religious wedding in late September. Salinas returned to Mexico in the late 1990s and has continued to influence Mexican politics since then. In April 2018, he celebrated his 70th birthday with a party attended by a number of political elites.http://www.aldiadallas.com/2018/04/09/carlos-salinas-de-gortari- celebro-su-cumpleanos-70-rodeado-de-la-clase-politica-de-mexico/ accessed 27 March 2019 On 5 December 2018, he attended George H. W. Bush's funeral. Public opinion and legacy Salinas de Gortari remains a highly controversial figure in Mexican history. In a 2005 national survey conducted by Parametr√≠a, 73% of the respondents had a negative image of Salinas de Gortari, 9% had a positive opinion, and 18% had no opinion about him. In another national survey conducted in 2012 by BGC-Excelsior about former Presidents, Salinas de Gortari by far received the worst rating: 20% of the respondents considered that his administration was \\"very good\\" or \\"good\\", 13% of the responded considered that it was an \\"average\\" administration, and 66% of the respondents considering that it was a \\"bad\\" or \\"very bad\\" administration.

It is often denoted using the percent sign, \\"%\\", although the abbreviations \\"pct.\\", \\"pct\\" and sometimes \\"pc\\" are also used.Dakers, Marion (7 January 2015). \\"Eurozone Officially Falls into Deflation, Piling Pressure on ECB.\\" The Telegraph. Retrieved 27 December 2019. A percentage is a dimensionless number (pure number); it has no unit of measurement.  Examples  For example, 45% (read as \\"forty-five percent\\") is equal to , 45:100, or 0.45. Percentages are often used to express a proportionate part of a total. (Similarly, one can also express a number as a fraction of 1000, using the term \\"per mille\\" or the symbol \\"‚Ä∞\\".) =Example 1= If 50% of the total number of students in the class are male, that means that 50 out of every 100 students are male. If there are 500 students, then 250 of them are male. =Example 2= An increase of $0.15 on a price of $2.50 is an increase by a fraction of = 0.06. Expressed as a percentage, this is a 6% increase. While many percentage values are between 0 and 100, there is no mathematical restriction and percentages may take on other values. For example, it is common to refer to 111% or ‚àí35%, especially for percent changes and comparisons.  History  In Ancient Rome, long before the existence of the decimal system, computations were often made in fractions in the multiples of . For example, Augustus levied a tax of on goods sold at auction known as centesima rerum venalium. Computation with these fractions was equivalent to computing percentages. As denominations of money grew in the Middle Ages, computations with a denominator of 100 became increasingly standard, such that from the late 15th century to the early 16th century, it became common for arithmetic texts to include such computations. Many of these texts applied these methods to profit and loss, interest rates, and the Rule of Three. By the 17th century, it was standard to quote interest rates in hundredths. Percent sign A percent sign The term \\"percent\\" is derived from the Latin per centum, meaning \\"hundred\\" or \\"by the hundred\\".American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 3rd ed. (1992) Houghton Mifflin The sign for \\"percent\\" evolved by gradual contraction of the Italian term per cento, meaning \\"for a hundred\\". The \\"per\\" was often abbreviated as \\"p.\\"‚Äîeventually disappeared entirely. The \\"cento\\" was contracted to two circles separated by a horizontal line, from which the modern \\"%\\" symbol is derived.Smith p. 250  Calculations  The percent value is computed by multiplying the numeric value of the ratio by 100. For example, to find 50 apples as a percentage of 1250 apples, one first computes the ratio = 0.04, and then multiplies by 100 to obtain 4%. The percent value can also be found by multiplying first instead of later, so in this example, the 50 would be multiplied by 100 to give 5,000, and this result would be divided by 1250 to give 4%. To calculate a percentage of a percentage, convert both percentages to fractions of 100, or to decimals, and multiply them. For example, 50% of 40% is: : It is not correct to divide by 100 and use the percent sign at the same time. For example, , not , which actually is . A term such as would also be incorrect, since it would be read as 1 percent, even if the intent was to say 100%. Whenever communicating about a percentage, it is important to specify what it is relative to (i.e., what is the total that corresponds to 100%). The following problem illustrates this point. :In a certain college 60% of all students are female, and 10% of all students are computer science majors. If 5% of female students are computer science majors, what percentage of computer science majors are female? We are asked to compute the ratio of female computer science majors to all computer science majors. We know that 60% of all students are female, and among these 5% are computer science majors, so we conclude that √ó = or 3% of all students are female computer science majors. Dividing this by the 10% of all students that are computer science majors, we arrive at the answer: = or 30% of all computer science majors are female. This example is closely related to the concept of conditional probability.  Percentage increase and decrease  Due to inconsistent usage, it is not always clear from the context what a percentage is relative to. When speaking of a \\"10% rise\\" or a \\"10% fall\\" in a quantity, the usual interpretation is that this is relative to the initial value of that quantity. For example, if an item is initially priced at $200 and the price rises 10% (an increase of $20), the new price will be $220. Note that this final price is 110% of the initial price (100% + 10% = 110%). Some other examples of percent changes: * An increase of 100% in a quantity means that the final amount is 200% of the initial amount (100% of initial + 100% of increase = 200% of initial). In other words, the quantity has doubled. * An increase of 800% means the final amount is 9 times the original (100% + 800% = 900% = 9 times as large). * A decrease of 60% means the final amount is 40% of the original (100% ‚Äì 60% = 40%). * A decrease of 100% means the final amount is zero (100% ‚Äì 100% = 0%). In general, a change of percent in a quantity results in a final amount that is 100 + percent of the original amount (equivalently, (1 + 0.01) times the original amount). Compounding percentages Percent changes applied sequentially do not add up in the usual way. For example, if the 10% increase in price considered earlier (on the $200 item, raising its price to $220) is followed by a 10% decrease in the price (a decrease of $22), then the final price will be $198‚Äînot the original price of $200. The reason for this apparent discrepancy is that the two percent changes (+10% and ‚àí10%) are measured relative to different quantities ($200 and $220, respectively), and thus do not \\"cancel out\\". In general, if an increase of percent is followed by a decrease of percent, and the initial amount was , the final amount is ; hence the net change is an overall decrease by percent of percent (the square of the original percent change when expressed as a decimal number). Thus, in the above example, after an increase and decrease of , the final amount, $198, was 10% of 10%, or 1%, less than the initial amount of $200. The net change is the same for a decrease of percent, followed by an increase of percent; the final amount is . This can be expanded for a case where one does not have the same percent change. If the initial amount leads to a percent change , and the second percent change is , then the final amount is . To change the above example, after an increase of and decrease of , the final amount, $209, is 4.5% more than the initial amount of $200. As shown above, percent changes can be applied in any order and have the same effect. In the case of interest rates, a very common but ambiguous way to say that an interest rate rose from 10% per annum to 15% per annum, for example, is to say that the interest rate increased by 5%, which could theoretically mean that it increased from 10% per annum to 10.05% per annum. It is clearer to say that the interest rate increased by 5 percentage points (pp). The same confusion between the different concepts of percent(age) and percentage points can potentially cause a major misunderstanding when journalists report about election results, for example, expressing both new results and differences with earlier results as percentages. For example, if a party obtains 41% of the vote and this is said to be a 2.5% increase, does that mean the earlier result was 40% (since 41 = ) or 38.5% (since 41 = )? In financial markets, it is common to refer to an increase of one percentage point (e.g. from 3% per annum to 4% per annum) as an increase of \\"100 basis points\\".  Word and symbol  In British English, percent is usually written as two words (per cent), although percentage and percentile are written as one word. In American English, percent is the most common variant (but per mille is written as two words). In the early 20th century, there was a dotted abbreviation form \\"per cent.\\", as opposed to \\"per cent\\". The form \\"per cent.\\" is still in use in the highly formal language found in certain documents like commercial loan agreements (particularly those subject to, or inspired by, common law), as well as in the Hansard transcripts of British Parliamentary proceedings. The term has been attributed to Latin per centum. The concept of considering values as parts of a hundred is originally Greek. The symbol for percent (%) evolved from a symbol abbreviating the Italian per cento. In some other languages, the form procent or prosent is used instead. Some languages use both a word derived from percent and an expression in that language meaning the same thing, e.g. Romanian procent and la sutƒÉ (thus, 10% can be read or sometimes written ten for [each] hundred, similarly with the English one out of ten). Other abbreviations are rarer, but sometimes seen. Grammar and style guides often differ as to how percentages are to be written. For instance, it is commonly suggested that the word percent (or per cent) be spelled out in all texts, as in \\"1 percent\\" and not \\"1%\\". Other guides prefer the word to be written out in humanistic texts, but the symbol to be used in scientific texts. Most guides agree that they always be written with a numeral, as in \\"5 percent\\" and not \\"five percent\\", the only exception being at the beginning of a sentence: \\"Ten percent of all writers love style guides.\\" Decimals are also to be used instead of fractions, as in \\"3.5 percent of the gain\\" and not \\" percent of the gain\\". However the titles of bonds issued by governments and other issuers use the fractional form, e.g. \\"% Unsecured Loan Stock 2032 Series 2\\". (When interest rates are very low, the number 0 is included if the interest rate is less than 1%, e.g. \\"% Treasury Stock\\", not \\"% Treasury Stock\\".) It is also widely accepted to use the percent symbol (%) in tabular and graphic material. In line with common English practice, style guides‚Äîsuch as The Chicago Manual of Style‚Äîgenerally state that the number and percent sign are written without any space in between. However, the International System of Units and the ISO 31-0 standard require a space.  Other uses  The word \\"percentage\\" is often a misnomer in the context of sports statistics, when the referenced number is expressed as a decimal proportion, not a percentage: \\"The Phoenix Suns' Shaquille O'Neal led the NBA with a .609 field goal percentage (FG%) during the 2008‚Äì09 season.\\" (O'Neal made 60.9% of his shots, not 0.609%.) Likewise, the winning percentage of a team, the fraction of matches that the club has won, is also usually expressed as a decimal proportion; a team that has a .500 winning percentage has won 50% of their matches. The practice is probably related to the similar way that batting averages are quoted. As \\"percent\\" it is used to describe the steepness of the slope of a road or railway, formula for which is 100 √ó which could also be expressed as the tangent of the angle of inclination times 100. This is the ratio of distances a vehicle would advance vertically and horizontally, respectively, when going up- or downhill, expressed in percent. Percentage is also used to express composition of a mixture by mass percent and mole percent.

Tamales were also considered sacred as it is the food of the gods. Aztec, Maya, Olmeca, and Tolteca all considered themselves to be people of corn and so tamales played a large part in their rituals and festivals. Mexico =Pre-Columbian Mexico= Pre-Columbian Mayas In the pre- Columbian era, the Mayas ate tamales and often served them at feasts and festivals. The Classic Maya hieroglyph for tamales has been identified on pots and other objects dating back to the Classic Era (200‚Äì1000 CE), although it is likely they were eaten much earlier. While tortillas are the basis for the contemporary Maya diet, there is remarkably little evidence for tortilla production among the Classic period Maya. A lack of griddles in the archaeological record suggests that the primary foodstuff of the Mesoamerican diet may have been the tamale, a cooked, vegetal-wrapped mass of maize dough.Taube, K. A. (1989). The maize tamale in Classic Maya diet, epigraphy, and art. American Antiquity, 54(1), 31-51. Tamales are cooked without the use of ceramic technologies and therefore the form of the tamale is thought to predate the tortilla.Zizumbo-Villarreal, D., Flores-Silva, A. & Colunga-Garc√≠a Mar√≠n, P. (2012). The Archaic Diet in Mesoamerica: Incentive for Milpa Development and Species Domestication. Economic Botany, 66(4), 328-343. Similarities between the two maize products can be found in both the ingredients and preparation techniques and the linguistic ambiguity exhibited by the pan-Mayan term wa referring to a basic, daily consumed maize product that can refer to either tortillas or tamales.Taube, K. A. (1989). The maize tamale in Classic Maya diet, epigraphy, and art. American Antiquity, 54(1), 31-51. Aztecs In the pre-Columbian era, the Aztecs ate tamales with fillings such as turkey, flamingo, frog, axolotl, pocket gopher, rabbit, fish, turkey eggs, honey, fruits, squash, and beans, as well as with no filling. Aztec tamales differed from modern tamales by not having added fat. One of the most significant rituals for the Aztecs was the feast of Atamalcualiztli (eating of water tamales). This ritual, held every eight years for a whole week, was done by eating tamales without any seasoning, spices, or filling which allowed the maize freedom from being overworked in the usual tamale cooking methods. =Modern Mexico= Mexican tamales in the tamalera A tamal dulce breakfast tamal from Oaxaca, Mexico. It contains pineapple, raisins and blackberries. In Mexico, tamales begin with a dough made from ground nixtamalized corn (hominy), called masa, or alternatively a rehydrated masa powder, such as Maseca. It is combined with lard or vegetable shortening, along with broth or water, to bring the dough to the consistency of a very thick batter. It's traditional to whisk the lard, and whisk the resulting batter, with the intent of producing the signature soft and fluffy texture. Modern recipes may use baking powder to achieve a similar effect. Chili purees or dried chili powders are also occasionally added to the batter, and in addition to the spice can cause some tamales to appear red in color. Tamales are generally wrapped in corn husks or plantain leaves before being steamed, with the choice of husk depending on the region. They usually have a sweet or savory filling and are usually steamed until firm. Tamale-making is a ritual that has been part of Mexican life since pre-Hispanic times, when special fillings and forms were designated for each specific festival or life event. Today, tamales are typically filled with meats, cheese or vegetables, especially chilies. Preparation is complex, time-consuming and an excellent example of Mexican communal cooking, where this task usually falls to the women. Tamales are a favorite comfort food in Mexico, eaten as both breakfast and dinner, and often accompanied by hot atole or champurrado and arroz con leche (rice porridge, lit. rice with milk) or maize-based beverages of indigenous origin. Street vendors can be seen serving them from huge, steaming, covered pots (tamaleras) or ollas. Instead of corn husks, banana or plantain leaves are used in tropical parts of the country, such as Oaxaca, Chiapas, Veracruz, and the Yucat√°n Peninsula. These tamales are rather square in shape, often very large‚Äî15 inches (40 cm)‚Äîand these larger tamales are commonly known as \\"pibs\\" in the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Another very large type of tamale is zacahuil, made in the Huasteca region of Mexico. Depending on the size, zacahuil can feed anywhere between 50 and 200 people; they are made during festivals and holidays, for quincea√±eras, and on Sundays to be sold at the markets. Guatemala =Pre-Columbian Guatemala= In the classical times of the Maya of Central America (Guatemala in particular), the great Mayan lords delighted in a baked dough bun during the winter solstice, made of maize mixed with turkey, tepezcuintle (Lowland Paca) or venison, spices, and chili pepper, among other ingredients. This meal was later integrated into modern Guatemalan traditions. For example, on Christmas Eve, families prepare black, red or sweet tamales for family and friends to show gratitude. The tamales are often accompanied with chocolate, yolk bread and punch, and participate in the Mass of Gallo, at Midnight. It is customary in Guatemala to eat tamales at midnight on December 24 and 31. Guatemalans also use tamales for holiday celebrations, birthdays and baptisms, so the tamale is considered an important dish in the culture of Guatemala. Guatemala has many tamale varieties from the traditional corn husked tamale (called a chuchito in Guatemala) to a sweet version of tamale, which uses the same corn dough, but it is seasoned with a honey or sugar combined with chocolate, almonds, plums, seeds and peppers. Tamales are sold all over Guatemala in stores and private homes (especially on Saturdays). A red light on a home at night is a sign that Tamales are for sale at that home. =Varieties= ;Guatemalan Tamale Red Tamales They owe their name to achiote and tomato, made with corn dough stuffed with recado rojo, raisins, chili peppers, chicken, beef or pork wrapped in banana leaves. ;Cambray Tamales They contain raisins and almonds, sweet tamales filled with sweet recado rojo, black tamales are named after the color that chocolate gives them, chipilin tamales wrapped in corn husks, parrot tamales, corn tamales among others are also made. Cream tamales and cheese and anise seeds are also mixed with corn tamales. ;Chuchito The chuchito is a typical and emblematic dish of Guatemala. It is a variation of the tamale made with corn dough but a firmer consistency, although lard can be added to the dough to generate a more pleasant taste and consistency; and it is usually mixed with recado rojo of tomato and with a filling that can be with chicken, beef or pork, and wrapped with dried cob leaves (tusa or bender). In some places it is accompanied by cheese, sauce or both. ;Rice tamales This variation comes from the Guatemalan highlands, where the typical corn dough is replaced by a thick dough of annealed rice with water and salt. The preparation of the recado rojo does not differ much from the original, since only in some regions will the ingredients with which it is made. ;Paches A Tamale made, particularly in the highlands of Guatemala, that uses potato instead of maize for the dough. ;Tamal or Tamalito A tamal or tamalito is dough only, with no meats or other fillings. This dish is used to accompany a meal and used to scoop of food on the plate, or just eaten plain along with the main dish. Belize The tamale is a staple in Belize, where it is also known by the Spanish name dukunu, a green corn tamale. Caribbean =Cuba= In Cuba, before the 1959 Revolution, street vendors sold Mexican- style tamales wrapped in corn husks, usually made without any kind of spicy seasoning. Cuban tamales being identical in form to those made in Mexico City suggests they were brought over to Cuba during the period of intense cultural and musical exchange between Cuba and Mexico, between the 1920s and 2000s. A well-known Cuban song from the 1950s, \\"Los Tamalitos de Olga\\", (a cha-cha-cha sung by Orquesta Arag√≥n) celebrated the delicious tamales sold by a street vendor in Cienfuegos. A peculiarly Cuban invention is the dish known as tamal en cazuela, basically consisting of tamale masa with the meat stuffing stirred into the masa, and then cooked in a pot on the stove to form a kind of hearty cornmeal porridge. =Trinidad and Tobago= In Trinidad and Tobago, it is called a pastelle and is popular in many households during the entire Christmas Season and New Year Celebrations. It is usually made with cornmeal and filled with cooked seasoned meat (chicken and beef being the most popular), raisins, olives, capers and other seasonings. The entire pastelle is wrapped in a banana leaf, bound with twine and steamed. When fully cooked, the banana leaf is removed to reveal the brightly yellow colored dish. It is often indulged as is or along with a meal. The sweet version is called paymee. United States Delta-style tamales from Clarksdale, Mississippi. Tamales have been eaten in the United States since at least 1893, when they were featured at the World's Columbian Exposition. In 1894, when tamales were the most popular ethnic food in Los Angeles, XLNT started making them. The company is the oldest continuously operating Mexican food brand in the United States, and one of the oldest companies in Southern California. A tradition of roving tamale sellers was documented in early 20th-century blues music. They are the subject of the well-known 1937 blues/ragtime song \\"They're Red Hot\\" by Robert Johnson. While Mexican-style and other Latin American‚Äìstyle tamales are featured at ethnic restaurants throughout the United States, there are also some distinctly indigenous styles. Choctaw and Chickasaw make a dish called banaha which can be stuffed or not (plain) usually the filling (range from none, fried bacon, turkey, deer, nuts, and vegetables like onions, potatoes, squash, and sweet potatoes) can either be filled or mixed with the masa and steamed in a corn shuck. Cherokee tamales, also known as bean bread or \\"broadswords\\", were made with hominy (in the case of the Cherokee, the masa was made from corn boiled in water treated with wood ashes instead of lime) and beans, and wrapped in green corn leaves or large tree leaves and boiled, similar to the meatless pre-Columbian bean and masa tamales still prepared in Chiapas, central Mexico, and Guatemala. In the Mississippi Delta, African Americans developed a spicy tamale made from cornmeal (rather than masa), which is boiled in corn husks. In northern Louisiana, tamales have been made for several centuries. The Spanish established presidio Los Adaes in 1721 in modern-day Robeline, Louisiana. The descendants of these Spanish settlers from central Mexico were the first tamale makers to arrive in the eastern US. Zwolle, Louisiana, has a Tamale Fiesta every year in October. Tamale pie Around the beginning of the 20th century, the name \\"tamale pie\\" was given to meat pies and casseroles made with a cornmeal crust and typical tamale fillings arranged in layers. Although characterized as Mexican food, these forms are not popular in Mexican American culture in which the individually wrapped style is preferred. The Indio International Tamale Festival held every December in Indio, California, has earned two Guinness World Records: the largest tamale festival (120,000 in attendance, Dec. 2‚Äì3, 2000) and the world's largest tamale, over 1 foot (0.3 m) in diameter and 40 feet (12.2 m) in length, created by Chef John Sedlar. The 2006 Guinness book calls the festival \\"the world's largest cooking and culinary festival\\". Philippines and Guam Binaki, a type of sweet tamale from Bukidnon, Philippines In the Philippines and Guam, which were governed by Spain as a province of Mexico, different forms of \\"tamales\\" exist. Some are made with a dough derived from ground rice and are filled with seasoned chicken or pork with the addition of peanuts and other seasonings such as sugar. In some places, such as the Pampanga and Batangas provinces, the tamales are wrapped in banana leaves, but sweet corn varieties from the Visayas region are wrapped in corn husks similar to the sweet corn tamales of the American Southwest and Mexico. Because of the work involved in the preparation of tamales, they usually only appear during the special holidays or other big celebrations. Various tamal recipes have practically disappeared under the pressures of modern life and the ease of fast food. Several varieties of tamales are also found in the Philippines. Tamales, tamalis, tamalos, pasteles, are different varieties found throughout the region. Some are sweet, some are savory, and some are sweet and savory. Mostly wrapped in banana leaves and made of rice, either the whole grain or ground and cooked with coconut milk and other seasonings, they are sometimes filled with meat and seafood, or are plain and have no filling. There are certain varieties, such as tamalos, that are made of a sweet corn masa wrapped in a corn husk or leaf. There are also varieties made without masa, like tamalis, which are made with small fish fry wrapped in banana leaves and steamed, similar to the tamales de charal from Mexico, where the small fish are cooked whole with herbs and seasonings wrapped inside a corn husk without masa. The number of varieties has dwindled through the years so certain types of tamales that were once popular in the Philippines have become lost or are simply memories. The variety found in Guam, known as tamales guiso, is made with corn masa and wrapped in corn husks, and as with the Philippine tamales, are clear evidence of the influence of the galleon trade that occurred between the ports of Manila and Acapulco.

It is the natural number following 1 and preceding 3. It is the smallest and only even prime number. Because it forms the basis of a duality, it has religious and spiritual significance in many cultures. Evolution of the glyph right The glyph used in the modern Western world to represent the number 2 traces its roots back to the Indic Brahmic script, where \\"2\\" was written as two horizontal lines. The modern Chinese and Japanese languages still use this method. The Gupta script rotated the two lines 45 degrees, making them diagonal. The top line was sometimes also shortened and had its bottom end curve towards the center of the bottom line. In the Nagari script, the top line was written more like a curve connecting to the bottom line. In the Arabic Ghubar writing, the bottom line was completely vertical, and the glyph looked like a dotless closing question mark. Restoring the bottom line to its original horizontal position, but keeping the top line as a curve that connects to the bottom line leads to our modern glyph.Georges Ifrah, The Universal History of Numbers: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer transl.

In mathematics An integer is called even if it is divisible by 2. For integers written in a numeral system based on an even number, such as decimal, hexadecimal, or in any other base that is even, divisibility by 2 is easily tested by merely looking at the last digit. If it is even, then the whole number is even. In particular, when written in the decimal system, all multiples of 2 will end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8\\\\. Two is the smallest prime number, and the only even prime number (for this reason it is sometimes called \\"the oddest prime\\").John Horton Conway & Richard K. Guy, The Book of Numbers. New York: Springer (1996): 25. . \\"Two is celebrated as the only even prime, which in some sense makes it the oddest prime of all.\\" The next prime is three. Two and three are the only two consecutive prime numbers. 2 is the first Sophie Germain prime, the first factorial prime, the first Lucas prime, and the first Ramanujan prime. Two is the third (or fourth) Fibonacci number. Two is the base of the binary system, the numeral system with the fewest tokens allowing to denote a natural number substantially more concise ( tokens), compared to a direct representation by the corresponding count of a single token ( tokens). This binary number system is used extensively in computing.

Two has therefore the unique property that , disregarding the level of the hyperoperation, here denoted by Knuth's up-arrow notation.

Powers of two are central to the concept of Mersenne primes, and important to computer science. Two is the first Mersenne prime exponent. Taking the square root of a number is such a common mathematical operation, that the spot on the root sign where the exponent would normally be written for cubic and other roots, may simply be left blank for square roots, as it is tacitly understood. The square root of 2 was the first known irrational number. The smallest field has two elements. In a set-theoretical construction of the natural numbers, 2 is identified with the set {{‚àÖ},‚àÖ}.

Capuchin catacombs of Palermo, Sicily were used as late as the 1920s. Catacombs were available in some of the grander English cemeteries founded in the 19th Century, such as Sheffield General Cemetery (above ground) and West Norwood Cemetery (below ground). There are catacombs in Bulgaria near Aladzha Monastery and in Romania as medieval underground galleries in Bucharest. In Ukraine and Russia, catacomb (used in the local languages' plural katakomby) also refers to the network of abandoned caves and tunnels earlier used to mine stone, especially limestone. In Italy very suggestive Catacombs are also located in Alezio, beside the Sanctuary of Santa Maria dell'Assunta , as well known with the name of ', basement. Decorations Catacombs, although most notable as underground passageways and cemeteries, also house many decorations. There are thousands of decorations in the centuries-old catacombs of Rome, catacombs of Paris, and other known and unknown catacombs, some of which include inscriptions, paintings, statues, ornaments, and other items placed in the graves over the years. Most of these decorations were used to identify, immortalize and show respect to the dead. Decorations in the catacombs of Rome were primarily decorated with images and words exalting Christ or depicting scenes from the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. Much of the sculpture work and art, other than engravings on the walls or tombs, has been preserved in places such as the Museum of Saint John Lateran, Christian Museum of Berlin University, and the Vatican. Three representations of Christ as Orpheus charming animals with peaceful music have been found in the catacombs of Domatilla and St. Callista. Another figure was made of gilded glass and dates back to the fourth century, featuring Jesus with the world balanced in his hand and a scroll at his feet. =Inscriptions= Although thousands of inscriptions were lost as time passed, many of those remaining indicate the social rank or job title of its inhabitants; however, most of the inscriptions simply indicate how loving a couple was, or the love of parents and such. A common and particularly interesting one found in Roman catacombs is the Ichthys, or \\"Monogram of Christ\\" which reads ŒôŒßŒòŒ•Œ£, standing for \\"Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior\\". Bacteria In recent years unique strains of bacteria have been discovered that thrive in catacombs, inducing mineral efflorescence and decay. These include Kribbella sancticallisti, Kribbella catacumbae, and three types of non-thermophilic (low-temperature) Rubrobacter.ScienceDaily, Bacteria Cause Old Buildings To Feel Off-Color 28 October 2008ScienceDaily, New Life Found in Ancient Tombs, 1 October 2008 See also *Cemetery *Crypt * Ossuary *\\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" *Underground city Notes References * Blyton, Enid \\"Five go to Smuggler's Top\\" Hodder and Stroughton (1945) * √âamonn √ì Carrag√°in, Carol L.

The organization focuses on empowering young people to make a Progressive social impact. The AIESEC network includes approximately 44,280 members in 120+ countries. AIESEC is a non-governmental in consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), is an independent arm of the UN DPI and UN's Office of the Secretary-General's Envoy on Youth, member of ICMYO, and is recognized by UNESCO. AIESEC's international headquarters are in Montreal, Canada. Name AIESEC was originally a French acronym for Association internationale des √©tudiants en sciences √©conomiques et commerciales (English: International Association of Students in Economic and Commercial Sciences). The full name is no longer officially used, as members can now be graduate and undergraduate from any university background. History = Founding = AIESEC in Estonia The idea behind AIESEC started in 1938, when representatives from schools across Europe exchanged information about various programs and schools that specialized in business and economics. Students had been carrying out internships in other countries, mostly on their own initiative, but this came to a standstill with the onslaught of World War II. In 1944, the neutral Scandinavian countries were still exchanging students. Bertil Hedberg, an official at the Stockholm School of Economics, and students Jaroslav Zich (of Czechoslovakia) and Stanislas Callens (of Belgium), founded AIESEC on July 2nd, 1946, under the name Association Internationale des Etudiants en Sciences Economiques (AIESE, or AIESEc) with a headquarter in Prague and Jaroslav Zich as the first President of the association. At the time of AIESEC's founding at the end of the 1940s, Europe was in the midst of recovery from the war that dealt grave losses to its population. Factories and enterprises were in desperate need of executives, managers and leaders. The continent needed more than just business development, however; the war had severely damaged relations between European nations, and many members of the community felt steps needed to be taken to address this problem. AIESEC was formed to address both of these concerns. In 1948, a renewing development of the association was initiated, with implementation of international meetings (congresses), replacing the practice of governance from the headquarter. The first broad meeting was held by students from 9 universities of 7 countries in April 1948 in Li√®ge (Belgium). Then the official, constitutive assembly (the congress) was organized in 1949 in Stockholm with Bengt Sj”ßstrand as the President and Sweden as the Presiding Country for 1949/1950. Students from seven nations: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, came together for that first International Congress of AIESEC. In 1949, 89 students were exchanged by AIESEC among the member nations. The next two annual congresses were conducted in Stockholm, presided by Bengt Sj”ßstrand, and in Paris, presided by Jean Choplin, respectively. At those congresses the organization's mission was stated: ‚Äúto expand the understanding of a nation by expanding the understanding of the individuals, changing the world one person at a time.‚Äù Also a constitution for the organization defined a purpose: \\"AIESEC is an independent, non-political, and international organization which has as its purpose to establish and promote the friendly relations between the members.\\" = Global expansion = The organization grew exponentially in the following years, with more than 1,000 exchanges taking place in 1955 alone. In the following few years, AIESEC quickly became global by establishing its first North American member, the United States, in 1957, and its first South American and African members, Colombia, Venezuela, and South Africa, in 1958. For the first years of its existence, AIESEC had no central governing body, but was instead managed jointly by a Presiding Country Committee composed of the National Committee Presidents of each member nation. As the organization grew, a central governing body was created and led by a democratically elected Secretary General. Morris Wolff, from the United States, was chosen as the first Secretary General in 1960, and established the first permanent international office for AIESEC in Geneva, Switzerland. Over the following decade, AIESEC expanded to eastern Asia, Australia, and deeper within Europe, Africa, North America, and South America, having a presence in 43 countries by 1969. =Campus involvement= AIESEC provides a platform for young people in different universities and colleges, by going on an international internship and/or by joining various local chapters. These young individuals can develop their leadership potential by working and leading international teams. Associate membership opportunities allow young people to work with various NGO partners of AIESEC, and represent their country as a part of campus ambassador programs. The organization's products are Global Talent, Global Teacher and Global Volunteer. Each year members have an opportunity to live and work in a foreign country. Participants can choose to work in the areas of management, technology, education, or development. This helps them build their corporate skills. = Conferences = Participants cheer during a local committee presentation at AIESEC France's \\"Spark 2013\\" national conference AIESEC hosts over 500 conferences every year that range in length and demographic scope. The purpose of conferences are to bring the international community of AIESEC members together to enhance their professional skills, provide networking opportunities, and work on organizational strategy. Topics of interest the organization focuses on include: leadership, sustainable development, entrepreneurship, innovation, corporate social responsibility, and youth impact on modern society. = Global Volunteer = \\"https://aiesec.org/about- us AIESEC is a global network of people that simply believe that youth leadership is not an option, but our responsibility.\\"The \\"Global Volunteer\\" portfolio in AIESEC is an international volunteer program which allows youth aged 18‚Äì29 to contribute to the United Nations' sustainable development goals of 2030. The Global Volunteering programs are short-term in nature (6-8 weeks) and provide youth with opportunities to travel abroad and work for Non-profit organizations with a special focus of second and third world countries. Projects include teaching, promoting HIV/AIDS awareness, working in human rights, environmental sustainability, leadership development and more.https://www.studentvolunteer.ie/view-all/become-a-global-volunteer-aiesec Since AIESEC is a non-profit organization, the exchange participants are to bear all expenses associated with travel including airfare, medical insurance, and transportation. Some of AIESEC's projects will provide food and accommodation. AIESEC's partnership with the United Nations seeks to tap the undiscovered potential of the youth globally and allow them to create a long- lasting impact to boost the international community. = Global Entrepreneur = \\"Global Entrepreneur\\" is a global internship opportunity at a startup for young people who seek to develop themselves and their career. They are usually short term in nature and involve working in startup projects. Global youth unemployment has become one of the top challenges faced by the youth today. AIESEC contributes to this issue through its Global Entrepreneur program, where a young person works abroad with entrepreneurs in a startup, accelerator or incubator to advance their goals and grow; thus developing an entrepreneurial stint through a global opportunity allowing yourself to expand your network and develop on a personal and professional level. \\"It is not just another survey, but a movement aimed to shine the light on the issues that matter, create awareness and generate actions.\\" - AIESEC = YouthSpeak = YouthSpeak Initiative is a youth movement powered by AIESEC. AIESEC believes that the society needs the young people of the world to take action on the UN goals for 2030, and AIESEC serves as a platform for youth empowerment. * YouthSpeak Survey aims to collect the common voice of the global youth and educate them about the Global Goals for Sustainable Development. There are 1.8 billion young people in the world and their voice needs to be heard. * YouthSpeak Forum gathers the youth as future leaders and current ones into same action space.

The recorded history of Iceland began with the settlement by Viking explorers and their slaves from the east, particularly Norway and the British Isles, in the late ninth century. Iceland was still uninhabited long after the rest of Western Europe had been settled. Recorded settlement has conventionally been dated back to 874, although archaeological evidence indicates Gaelic monks from Ireland, known as papar according to sagas, had settled Iceland before that date. The land was settled quickly, mainly by Norwegians who may have been fleeing conflict or seeking new land to farm. By 930, the chieftains had established a form of governance, the Althing, making it one of the world's oldest parliaments. Towards the end of the tenth century, Christianity came to Iceland through the influence of the Norwegian king Olaf Tryggvason. During this time, Iceland remained independent, a period known as the Old Commonwealth, and Icelandic historians began to document the nation's history in books referred to as sagas of Icelanders. In the early thirteenth century, the internal conflict known as the age of the Sturlungs weakened Iceland, which eventually became subjugated to Norway through the Old Covenant (1262‚Äì1264), effectively ending the commonwealth. Norway, in turn, was united with Sweden (1319) and then Denmark (1376). Eventually all of the Nordic states were united in one alliance, the Kalmar Union (1397‚Äì1523), but on its dissolution, Iceland fell under Danish rule. The subsequent strict Danish‚ÄìIcelandic Trade Monopoly in the 17th and 18th centuries was detrimental to the economy. Iceland's resultant poverty was aggravated by severe natural disasters like the M√≥√∞uhar√∞indin or \\"Mist Hardships\\". During this time, the population declined. Iceland remained part of Denmark, but in keeping with the rise of nationalism around Europe in the nineteenth century, an independence movement emerged. The Althing, which had been suspended in 1799, was restored in 1844, and Iceland gained sovereignty after World War I, becoming the Kingdom of Iceland on 1 December 1918. However, Iceland shared the Danish Monarchy until World War II. Although Iceland was neutral in the Second World War, the United Kingdom invaded and peacefully occupied it in 1940 to forestall a Nazi occupation, after Denmark was overrun by the German Wehrmacht.\\"Iceland was therefore peacefully occupied by Britain on 10 May 1940,\\" says Due to the island's strategic position in the North Atlantic, the Allies occupied the island until the end of the war, with the United States taking over occupation duties from the British in 1941. In 1944, Iceland severed its remaining ties with Denmark (then still under Nazi occupation) and declared itself a republic. Following the Second World War, Iceland was a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and joined the United Nations one year after its establishment. Its economy grew rapidly largely through fishing, although this was marred by disputes with other nations. Following rapid financial growth, the 2008‚Äì11 Icelandic financial crisis occurred. Iceland continues to remain outside the European Union. Iceland is very remote, therefore has been spared the ravages of European wars but has been affected by other external events, such as the Black Death and the Protestant Reformation imposed by Denmark. Iceland's history has also been marked by a number of natural disasters. Iceland is a relatively young island in the geological sense, being formed about 20 million years ago by a series of volcanic eruptions in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, but it is still growing from fresh volcanic eruptions. The oldest stone specimens found in Iceland date back to ca. 16 million years ago. Geological background Mid-Atlantic Ridge and adjacent plates. Volcanoes indicated in red . In geological terms, Iceland is a young island. It started to form in the Miocene era about 20 million years ago from a series of volcanic eruptions on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where it lies between the North American and Eurasian plates. These plates spread at a rate of approximately 2.5 centimeters per year. This elevated portion of the ridge is known as the Reykjanes Ridge. The volcanic activity is attributed to a hotspot, the Iceland hotspot, which in turn lies over a mantle plume (the Iceland Plume) an anomalously hot rock in the Earth's mantle which is likely to be partly responsible for the island's creation and continued existence. For comparison, it is estimated that other volcanic islands, such as the Faroe Islands have existed for about 55 million years, the Azores (on the same ridge) about 8 million years, and Hawaii less than a million years. The younger rock strata in the southwest of Iceland and the central highlands are only about 700,000 years old. The geological history of the earth is divided into ice ages, based on temperature and climate. The last glacial period, commonly referred to as The Ice Age is thought to have begun about 110,000 years ago and ended about 10,000 years ago. While covered in ice, Iceland's icefalls, fjords and valleys were formed. Early history Iceland remained, for a long time, one of the world's last uninhabited larger islands (the others being New Zealand and Madagascar). It has been suggested that the land called Thule by the Greek geographer Pytheas (fourth century BC) was actually Iceland, although it seems highly unlikely considering Pytheas' description of it as an agricultural country with plenty of milk, honey, and fruit: the name is more likely to have referred to Norway, or possibly the Faroe Islands or Shetland. The exact date that humans first reached the island is uncertain. Roman currency dating to the third century has been found in Iceland, but it is unknown whether they were brought there at that time or came later with Vikings after circulating for centuries. =Irish monks= There is some literary evidence that monks from a Hiberno-Scottish mission may have settled in Iceland before the arrival of the Norsemen.The 9th-century Irish monk and geographer Dicuil describes Iceland in his work Liber de Mensura Orbis Terrae. The Landn√°mab√≥k (\\"Book of Settlements\\"), written in the 1100s, mentions the presence of Irish monks, called the Papar, prior to Norse settlement and states that the monks left behind Irish books, bells, and crosiers, among other things. According to the same account, the Irish monks abandoned the country when the Norse arrived or had left prior to their arrival. The twelfth-century scholar Ari √ûorgilsson's √çslendingab√≥k reasserts that items including bells corresponding to those used by Irish monks were found by the settlers. No such artifacts have been discovered by archaeologists, however. Some Icelanders claimed descent from Cerball mac D√∫nlainge, King of Osraige in southeastern Ireland, at the time of the Landn√°mab√≥ks creation. Another source mentioning the Papar is √çslendingab√≥k, dating from between 1122 and 1133. According to this account, the previous inhabitants, a few Irish monks known as the Papar, left the island since they did not want to live with pagan Norsemen. One theory suggests that those monks were members of a Hiberno-Scottish mission, Irish and Scottish monks who spread Christianity during the Middle Ages. They may also have been hermits. Recent archaeological excavations have revealed the ruins of a cabin in Hafnir on the Reykjanes peninsula (close to Keflav√≠k International Airport). Carbon dating reveals that the cabin was abandoned somewhere between 770 and 880, suggesting that Iceland was populated well before 874. This archaeological find may also indicate that the monks left Iceland before the Norse arrived.‚ÄùNew View on the Origin of First Settlers in Iceland‚Äù , Iceland Review Online, 4 June 2011, accessed 16 June 2011. =Norse discovery= Norsemen landing in Iceland. Painting by Oscar Wergeland (1909). According to the Landn√°mab√≥k, Iceland was discovered by Naddodd, one of the first settlers in the Faroe Islands, who was sailing from Norway to the Faroes but lost his way and drifted to the east coast of Iceland. Naddodd called the country Sn√¶land \\"Snowland\\". Swedish sailor Gar√∞ar Svavarsson also accidentally drifted to the coast of Iceland. He discovered that the country was an island and called it Gar√∞arsh√≥lmi \\"Gar√∞ar's Islet\\" and stayed for the winter at H√∫sav√≠k. The first Norseman who deliberately sailed to Gar√∞arsh√≥lmi was Hrafna-Fl√≥ki Vilger√∞arson. Fl√≥ki settled for one winter at Bar√∞astr√∂nd. After the cold winter passed, the summer came and the whole island became green, which stunned Fl√≥ki. Realizing that this place was in fact habitable, despite the horribly cold winter, and full of useful resources, Fl√≥ki restocked his boat. He then returned east to Norway with resources and knowledge. Settlement (874‚Äì930) Ing√≥lfr Arnarson commands his high seat pillars to be erected in this painting by Peter Raadsig. The first permanent settler in Iceland is usually considered to have been a Norwegian chieftain named Ing√≥lfr Arnarson and his wife, Hallveig Fr√≥√∞ad√≥ttir. According to the Landn√°mab√≥k, he threw two carved pillars (√ñndvegiss√∫lur) overboard as he neared land, vowing to settle wherever they landed. He then sailed along the coast until the pillars were found in the southwestern peninsula, now known as Reykjanesskagi. There he settled with his family around 874, in a place he named Reykjav√≠k \\"Smoke Cove\\", probably from the geothermal steam rising from the earth. This place eventually became the capital and the largest city of modern Iceland. It is recognized, however, that Ing√≥lfr Arnarson may not have been the first one to settle permanently in Iceland‚Äîthat may have been N√°ttfari, one of Gar√∞ar Svavarsson's men who stayed behind when Gar√∞ar returned to Scandinavia. Much of the information on Ing√≥lfr comes from the Landn√°mab√≥k, written some three centuries after the settlement. Archeological findings in Reykjav√≠k are consistent with the date given there: there was a settlement in Reykjav√≠k around 870. alt=Harald Fairhair of Norway receiving the kingdom of Norway from his father, Halfdan the Black. According to Landn√°mab√≥k, Ing√≥lfr was followed by many more Norse chieftains, their families and slaves who settled all the habitable areas of the island in the next decades. Archeological evidence strongly suggests that the timing is roughly accurate; \\"that the whole country was occupied within a couple of decades towards the end of the 9th century.\\" These people were primarily of Norwegian, Irish, and Scottish origin. Some of the Irish and Scots were slaves and servants of the Norse chiefs, according to the sagas of Icelanders, the Landn√°mab√≥k, and other documents. Some settlers coming from the British Isles were \\"Hiberno-Norse,\\" with cultural and family connections both to the coastal and island areas of Ireland and/or Scotland and to Norway. The traditional explanation for the exodus from Norway is that people were fleeing the harsh rule of the Norwegian king Harald Fairhair, whom medieval literary sources credit with the unification of some parts of modern Norway during this period. Viking incursions into Britain were also expelled thoroughly during this time, potentially leading to a need for peaceful settlement in other lands. It is also believed that the western fjords of Norway were simply overcrowded in this period. The settlement of Iceland is thoroughly recorded in the aforementioned Landn√°mab√≥k, although the book was compiled in the early 12th century when at least 200 years had passed from the age of settlement. Ari √ûorgilsson's √çslendingab√≥k is generally considered more reliable as a source and is probably somewhat older, but it is far less thorough. It does say that Iceland was fully settled within 60 years, which likely means that all arable land had been claimed by various settlers. Commonwealth (930‚Äì1262) Nineteenth-century depiction of a session of the Al√æingi. √ûingvellir, seat of the Al√æingi. In 930, the ruling chiefs established an assembly called the Al√æingi (Althing). The parliament convened each summer at √ûingvellir, where representative chieftains (Go√∞or√∞smenn or Go√∞ar) amended laws, settled disputes and appointed juries to judge lawsuits. Laws were not written down but were instead memorized by an elected Lawspeaker (l«´gs«´guma√∞r). The Al√æingi is sometimes said to be the world's oldest existing parliament. Importantly, there was no central executive power, and therefore laws were enforced only by the people. This gave rise to feuds, which provided the writers of the sagas with plenty of material. Iceland enjoyed a mostly uninterrupted period of growth in its commonwealth years. Settlements from that era have been found in southwest Greenland and eastern Canada, and sagas such as Saga of Erik the Red and Greenland saga speak of the settlers' exploits. 10th-century Eyrarland Statue of Thor, found in Iceland. =Christianisation= The settlers of Iceland were predominantly pagans and worshiped the Norse gods, among them Odin, Thor, Freyr, and Freyja. By the tenth century, political pressure from Europe to convert to Christianity mounted. As the end of the first millennium grew near, many prominent Icelanders had accepted the new faith. In the year 1000, as a civil war between the religious groups seemed likely, the Al√æingi appointed one of the chieftains, Thorgeir Ljosvetningagodi, to decide the issue of religion by arbitration. He decided that the country should convert to Christianity as a whole, but that pagans would be allowed to worship privately. The first Icelandic bishop, √çsleifur Gissurarson, was consecrated by bishop Adalbert of Hamburg in 1056. =Civil war and the end of the commonwealth= During the 11th and 12th centuries, the centralization of power had worn down the institutions of the commonwealth, as the former, notable independence of local farmers and chieftains gave way to the growing power of a handful of families and their leaders. The period from around 1200 to 1262 is generally known as the Age of the Sturlungs. This refers to Sturla √û√≥r√∞arson and his sons, Sighvatr Sturluson, and Snorri Sturluson, who were one of two main clans fighting for power over Iceland, causing havoc in a land inhabited almost entirely by farmers who could ill-afford to travel far from their farms, across the island to fight for their leaders. In 1220, Snorri Sturluson became a vassal of Haakon IV of Norway; his nephew Sturla Sighvatsson also became a vassal in 1235. Sturla used the power and influence of the Sturlungar family clan to wage war against the other clans in Iceland. After decades of conflict, the Icelandic chieftains agreed to accept the sovereignty of Norway and signed the Old Covenant (Gamli s√°ttm√°li) establishing a union with the Norwegian monarchy. Iceland under Norwegian and Danish kings (1262‚Äì1944) =Norwegian rule= Little changed in the decades following the treaty. Norway's consolidation of power in Iceland was slow, and the Althing intended to hold onto its legislative and judicial power. Nonetheless, the Christian clergy had unique opportunities to accumulate wealth via the tithe, and power gradually shifted to ecclesiastical authorities as Iceland's two bishops in Sk√°lholt and H√≥lar acquired land at the expense of the old chieftains. For a long period, stockfish trade made up the bulk of Iceland's exports. Around the time Iceland became a vassal state of Norway, a climate shift occurred‚Äîa phenomenon now called the Little Ice Age. Areas near the Arctic Circle such as Iceland and Greenland began to have shorter growing seasons and colder winters. Since Iceland had marginal farmland in good times, the climate change resulted in hardship for the population. Information about Icelandic diet & history thereof A serfdom-like institution called the vistarband developed, in which peasants were bound to landowners for a year at a time. It became more difficult to raise barley, the primary cereal crop, and livestock required additional fodder to survive longer and colder winters. Icelanders began to trade for grain from continental Europe, which was an expensive proposition. Church fast days increased demand for dried codfish, which was easily caught and prepared for export, and the cod trade became an important part of the economy. =Kalmar Union= Iceland remained under Norwegian kingship until 1380, when the death of Olaf II of Denmark extinguished the Norwegian male royal line. Norway (and thus Iceland) then became part of the Kalmar Union, along with Sweden and Denmark, with Denmark as the dominant power. Unlike Norway, Denmark did not need Iceland's fish and homespun wool. This created a dramatic deficit in Iceland's trade. The small Greenland colony, established in the late 10th century, died out completely before 1500. Christian III of Denmark. With the introduction of absolute monarchy in Denmark‚ÄìNorway in 1660 under Frederick III of Denmark, the Icelanders relinquished their autonomy to the crown, including the right to initiate and consent to legislation. Denmark, however, did not provide much protection to Iceland, which was raided in 1627 by a Barbary pirate fleet that abducted almost 300 Icelanders into slavery, in an episode known as the Turkish Abductions. = Foreign merchants and fishermen = English and German merchants became more prominent in Iceland at the start of the 15th century. Some historians refer to the 15th century as the \\"English Age\\" in Iceland's history, due to the prominence of English traders and fishing fleets. What drew foreigners to Iceland was primarily fishing in the fruitful waters off the coast of Iceland. The Icelandic trade was important to some British ports; for example, in Hull, the Icelandic trade accounted for more than ten percent of Hull's total trade. The trade has been credited with raising Icelandic living standards. The 16th century has been referred to as the \\"German Age\\" by Icelandic historians due to the prominence of German traders. The Germans did not engage in much fishing themselves, but they owned fishing boats, rented them to Icelanders and then bought the fish from Icelandic fishermen to export to the European Continent. An illicit trade continued with foreigners after the Danes implemented a trade monopoly. Dutch and French traders became more prominent in the mid-17th century. =Reformation and Danish trade monopoly= By the middle of the 16th century, Christian III of Denmark began to impose Lutheranism on his subjects. J√≥n Arason and √ñgmundur P√°lsson, the Catholic bishops of Sk√°lholt and H√≥lar respectively, opposed Christian's efforts at promoting the Protestant Reformation in Iceland. √ñgmundur was deported by Danish officials in 1541, but J√≥n Arason put up a fight. Opposition to the reformation ended in 1550 when J√≥n Arason was captured after being defeated in the Battle of Sau√∞afell by loyalist forces under the leadership of Da√∞i Gu√∞mundsson. J√≥n Arason and his two sons were subsequently beheaded in Sk√°lholt. Following this, the Icelanders became Lutherans and remain largely so to this day. In 1602, Iceland was forbidden to trade with countries other than Denmark, by order of the Danish government, which at this time pursued mercantilist policies. The Danish‚ÄìIcelandic Trade Monopoly remained in effect until 1786. Fisherman's hut in Iceland =The eruption of Laki= In the 18th century, climatic conditions in Iceland reached an all-time low since the original settlement. On top of this, Laki erupted in 1783, spitting out of lava. Floods, ash, and fumes killed 9,000 people and 80% of the livestock. The ensuing starvation killed a quarter of Iceland's population. This period is known as the M√≥√∞uhar√∞indin or \\"Mist Hardships\\". When the two kingdoms of Denmark and Norway were separated by the Treaty of Kiel in 1814 following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark kept Iceland as a dependency. =Independence movement= J√≥n Sigur√∞sson. Throughout the 19th century, the country's climate continued to grow worse, resulting in mass emigration to the New World, particularly Manitoba in Canada. However, a new national consciousness was revived in Iceland, inspired by romantic nationalist ideas from continental Europe. This revival was spearheaded by the Fj√∂lnismenn, a group of Danish- educated Icelandic intellectuals. An independence movement developed under the leadership of a lawyer named J√≥n Sigur√∞sson. In 1843, a new Althing was founded as a consultative assembly. It claimed continuity with the Althing of the Icelandic Commonwealth, which had remained for centuries as a judicial body and had been abolished in 1800. =Home rule and sovereignty= Hannes Hafstein, first Prime Minister of Iceland and the first Icelander to be appointed to the Danish Cabinet as the Minister for Iceland In 1874, a thousand years after the first acknowledged settlement, Denmark granted Iceland a constitution and home rule, which again was expanded in 1904. The constitution was revised in 1903, and a minister for Icelandic affairs, residing in Reykjav√≠k, was made responsible to the Althing, the first of whom was Hannes Hafstein. The Act of Union, a December 1, 1918, agreement with Denmark, recognized Iceland as a fully sovereign state‚Äîthe Kingdom of Iceland‚Äîjoined with Denmark in a personal union with the Danish king. Iceland established its own flag. Denmark was to represent its foreign affairs and defense interests. Iceland had no military or naval forces, and Denmark was to give notice to other countries that it was permanently neutral. The act would be up for revision in 1940 and could be revoked three years later if agreement was not reached. By the 1930s the consensus in Iceland was to seek complete independence by 1944 at the latest.Solrun B. Jensdottir Hardarson, \\"The 'Republic of Iceland' 1940‚Äì44: Anglo-American Attitudes and Influences,\\" Journal of Contemporary History (1974) 9#4 pp. 27‚Äì56 in JSTOR = World War I = In the quarter of a century preceding the war, Iceland had prospered. However, Iceland became more isolated during World War I and suffered a significant decline in living standards. The treasury became highly indebted, and there was a shortage of food and fears over an imminent famine. Iceland was part of neutral Denmark during the war. Icelanders were, in general, sympathetic to the cause of the Allies. Iceland also traded significantly with the United Kingdom during the war, as Iceland found itself within its sphere of influence. In their attempts to stop the Icelanders from trading with the Germans indirectly, the British imposed costly and time-consuming constraints on Icelandic exports going to the Nordic countries. There is no evidence of any German plans to invade Iceland during the war. 1,245 Icelanders, Icelandic Americans, and Icelandic Canadians were registered as soldiers during World War I. 989 fought for Canada, whereas 256 fought for the United States. 391 of the combatants were born in Iceland, the rest were of Icelandic descent. 10 women of Icelandic descent and 4 women born in Iceland served as nurses for the Allies during World War I. At least 144 of the combatants died during World War I (96 in combat, 19 from wounds suffered during combat, 2 from accidents, and 27 from disease), 61 of them were Iceland-born. Ten men were taken as prisoners of war by the Germans. The war had a lasting impact on Icelandic society and Iceland's external relations. It led to major government interference in the marketplace that lasted until the post-World War II period. Iceland's competent governance of internal affairs and relations with other states‚Äîwhile relations with Denmark were interrupted during the war‚Äîshowed that Iceland was capable of acquiring further powers, which resulted in Denmark recognizing Iceland as a fully sovereign state in 1918. It has been argued that the thirst for news of the war helped Morgunbla√∞i√∞ to gain a dominant position among Icelandic newspapers. = The Great Depression = Icelandic post-World War I prosperity came to an end with the outbreak of the Great Depression, a severe worldwide economic crash. The depression hit Iceland hard as the value of exports plummeted. The total value of Icelandic exports fell from 74 million kronur in 1929 to 48 million kronur in 1932, and did not rise again to the pre-1930 level until after 1939. Government interference in the economy increased: \\"Imports were regulated, trade with foreign currency was monopolized by state-owned banks, and loan capital was largely distributed by state-regulated funds\\". The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War cut Iceland's exports of saltfish by half, and the depression lasted in Iceland until the outbreak of World War II, when prices for fish exports soared. =World War II= led the British invasion of Iceland. With war looming in the spring of 1939, Iceland realized its exposed position would be very dangerous in wartime. An all-party government was formed, and Lufthansa's request for civilian airplane landing rights was rejected. German ships were all about, however, until the British blockade of Germany put a stop to that when the war began in September. Iceland demanded Britain allow it to trade with Germany, to no avail.Hardarson, (1974) pp. 29‚Äì31 The occupation of Denmark by Nazi Germany began on 9 April 1940, severing communications between Iceland and Denmark. As a result, on 10 April, the Parliament of Iceland took temporary control of foreign affairs (setting up what would be the forerunner of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs) and the Coast Guard. Parliament also elected a provisional governor, Sveinn Bj√∂rnsson, who later became the Republic's first president. Iceland became de facto fully sovereign with these actions. At the time, Icelanders and the Danish King considered this state of affairs to be temporary and believed that Iceland would return these powers to Denmark when the occupation was over. Iceland turned down British offers of protection after the occupation of Denmark, because that would violate Iceland's neutrality. Britain and the U.S. opened direct diplomatic relations, as did Sweden and Norway. The German takeover of Norway left Iceland highly exposed; Britain decided it could not risk a German takeover of Iceland. On 10 May 1940, British military forces began an invasion of Iceland when they sailed into Reykjav√≠k harbour in Operation Fork. There was no resistance, but the government protested against what it called a \\"flagrant violation\\" of Icelandic neutrality, though Prime Minister Hermann J√≥nasson called on Icelanders to treat the British troops with politeness, as if they were guests. They behaved accordingly, and there were no mishaps. The occupation of Iceland lasted throughout the war.Hardarson, (1974) pp. 32‚Äì33 US Army training in Iceland in June 1943. At the peak, the British had 25,000 troops stationed in Iceland, all but eliminating unemployment in the Reykjav√≠k area and other strategically important places. In July 1941, responsibility for Iceland's occupation and defence passed to the United States under a U.S.-Icelandic agreement which included a provision that the U.S. recognize Iceland's absolute independence. The British were replaced by up to 40,000 Americans, who outnumbered all adult Icelandic men. (At the time, Iceland had a population of around 120,000.)Hardarson, (1974) pp. 43‚Äì45 Approximately 159 Icelanders' lives have been confirmed to have been lost in World War II hostilities. Most were killed on cargo and fishing vessels sunk by German aircraft, U-boats or mines. An additional 70 Icelanders died at sea, but it has not been confirmed whether they lost their lives as a result of hostilities. The occupation of Iceland by the British and the American proved to be an economic boom, as the occupiers injected money into the Icelandic economy and launched various projects. This eradicated unemployment in Iceland and raised wages considerably. According to one study, \\"by the end of World War II, Iceland had been transformed from one of Europe‚Äôs poorest countries to one of the world‚Äôs wealthiest.\\" Republic of Iceland (1944‚Äì) =Founding of the republic= Sveinn Bj√∂rnsson, the first President of Iceland. On 31 December 1943, the Act of Union agreement expired after 25 years. Beginning on 20 May 1944, Icelanders voted in a four-day plebiscite on whether to terminate the personal union with the King of Denmark and establish a republic. The vote was 97% in favour of ending the union and 95% in favour of the new republican constitution.Hardarson, (1974) p. 56 Iceland became an independent republic on 17 June 1944, with Sveinn Bj√∂rnsson as its first president. Denmark was still occupied by Germany at the time. Danish King Christian X sent a message of congratulations to the Icelandic people. Iceland had prospered during the course of the war, amassing considerable currency reserves in foreign banks. In addition to this, the country received the most Marshall Aid per capita of any European country in the immediate postwar years (at US$209, with the war- ravaged Netherlands a distant second at US$109).Margrit M√ºller, Pathbreakers: Small European Countries Responding to Globalisation and Deglobalisation, p. 385 The new republican government, led by an unlikely three-party majority cabinet made up of conservatives (the Independence Party, Sj√°lfst√¶√∞isflokkurinn), social democrats (the Social Democratic Party, Al√æ√Ω√∞uflokkurinn), and socialists (People's Unity Party ‚Äì Socialist Party, S√≥s√≠alistaflokkurinn), decided to put the funds into a general renovation of the fishing fleet, the building of fish processing facilities, the construction of a cement and fertilizer factory, and a general modernization of agriculture. These actions were aimed at keeping Icelanders' standard of living as high as it had become during the prosperous war years. The government's fiscal policy was strictly Keynesian, and their aim was to create the necessary industrial infrastructure for a prosperous developed country. It was considered essential to keep unemployment down and to protect the export fishing industry through currency manipulation and other means. Because of the country's dependence both on reliable fish catches and foreign demand for fish products, Iceland's economy remained unstable well into the 1990s, when the country's economy was greatly diversified. =NATO membership, US defense agreement, and the Cold War= United States F-15 fighter jets at Keflav√≠k Air Base. In October 1946, the Icelandic and United States governments agreed to terminate U.S. responsibility for the defense of Iceland, but the United States retained certain rights at Keflav√≠k, such as the right to re-establish a military presence there, should war threaten. Iceland became a charter member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on 30 March 1949, with the reservation that it would never take part in offensive action against another nation. The membership came amid an anti-NATO riot in Iceland. After the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, and pursuant to the request of NATO military authorities, the United States and Iceland agreed that the United States should again take responsibility for Iceland's defense. This agreement, signed on 5 May 1951, was the authority for the controversial U.S. military presence in Iceland, which remained until 2006. The U.S. base served as a hub for transports and communications to Europe, a key chain in the GIUK gap, a monitor of Soviet submarine activity, and a linchpin in the early warning system for incoming Soviet attacks and interceptor of Soviet reconnaissance bombers. Although U.S. forces no longer maintain a military presence in Iceland, the U.S. still assumes responsibility over the country's defense through NATO. Iceland has retained strong ties to the other Nordic countries. As a consequence, Norway, Denmark, Germany, and other European nations have increased their defense and rescue cooperation with Iceland since the withdrawal of U.S. forces. According to a 2018 study in the Scandinavian Journal of History, Iceland benefited massively from its relationship with the United States during the Cold War. The United States provided extensive economic patronage, advocated on Iceland's behalf in international organizations, allowed Iceland to violate the rules of international organizations, and helped Iceland to victory in the Cod Wars. Despite this, the relationship with the United States was contentious in Icelandic domestic politics, leaving some scholars to describe Iceland as a \\"rebellious ally\\" and \\"reluctant ally.\\" Iceland repeatedly threatened to leave NATO or cancel the US defence agreement during the Cold War, which is one reason why the United States went to great lengths to please the Icelanders. =Cod Wars= Icelandic Coast Guard and Royal Navy vessels clash in the North Atlantic. The Cod Wars were a series of militarized interstate disputes between Iceland and the United Kingdom from the 1950s to the mid-1970s. The Proto Cod War (1952‚Äì1956) revolved around Iceland's extension of its fishery limits from 3 to 4 nautical miles. The First Cod War (1958‚Äì1961) was fought over Iceland's extension from 4 to 12 nautical miles (7 to 22 km). The Second Cod War (1972‚Äì1973) occurred when Iceland extended the limits to 50 miles (93 km). The Third Cod War (1975‚Äì1976) was fought over Iceland's extension of its fishery limits to 200 miles (370 km). Icelandic patrol ships and British trawlers clashed in all four Cod Wars. The Royal Navy was sent to the contested waters in the last three Cod Wars, leading to highly publicized clashes.\\"Now, the Cod Peace\\", Time, June 14, 1976. p. 37 During these disputes, Iceland threatened closure of the U.S. base at Keflav√≠k, and the withdrawal of its NATO membership. Due to Iceland's strategic importance during the Cold War, it was important for the U.S. and NATO to maintain the base on Icelandic soil and to keep Iceland as a member of NATO. While the Icelandic government did follow through on its threat to break off diplomatic relations with the UK during the Third Cod War, it never went through on its threats to close the U.S. base or to withdraw from NATO. It is rare for militarized interstate disputes of this magnitude and intensity to occur between two democracies with as close economic, cultural, and institutional ties as Iceland and the UK. =EEA membership and economic reform= Prime Minister of Iceland Dav√≠√∞ Oddsson with United States President George W. Bush in 2004. In 1991, the Independence Party, led by Dav√≠√∞ Oddsson, formed a coalition government with the Social Democrats. This government set in motion market liberalisation policies, privatising a number of state-owned companies. Iceland then became a member of the European Economic Area in 1994. Economic stability increased and previously chronic inflation was drastically reduced. The flag of Iceland being raised and the flag of the United States being lowered as the U.S. hands over the Keflav√≠k Air Base to the Government of Iceland. In 1995, the Independence Party formed a coalition government with the Progressive Party. This government continued with free market policies, privatising two commercial banks and the state-owned telecom Landss√≠minn. Corporate income tax was reduced to 18% (from around 50% at the beginning of the decade), inheritance tax was greatly reduced, and the net wealth tax was abolished. A system of individual transferable quotas in the Icelandic fisheries, first introduced in the late 1970s, was further developed. The coalition government remained in power through elections in 1999 and 2003. In 2004, Dav√≠√∞ Oddsson stepped down as Prime Minister after 13 years in office. Halld√≥r √Åsgr√≠msson, leader of the Progressive Party, took over as prime minister from 2004 to 2006, followed by Geir H. Haarde, Dav√≠√∞ Oddsson's successor as leader of the Independence Party. Following a recession in the early 1990s, economic growth was considerable, averaging about 4% per year from 1994. The governments of the 1990s and 2000s adhered to a staunch but domestically controversial pro-U.S. foreign policy, lending nominal support to the NATO action in the Kosovo War and signing up as a member of the Coalition of the willing during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In March 2006, the United States announced that it intended to withdraw the greater part of the Icelandic Defence Force. On 12 August 2006, the last four F-15's left Icelandic airspace. The United States closed the Keflav√≠k Air Base in September 2006. In 2016, it was reported that the United States was considering re-opening the base. Following elections in May 2007, the Independence Party, headed by Haarde, remained in government, albeit in a new coalition with the Social Democratic Alliance. =Financial crisis= ex-Prime Minister J√≥hanna Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir, the world's first openly homosexual head of government of the modern era. In October 2008, the Icelandic banking system collapsed, prompting Iceland to seek large loans from the International Monetary Fund and friendly countries. Widespread protests in late 2008 and early 2009 resulted in the resignation of the Haarde government, which was replaced on 1 February 2009 by a coalition government led by the Social Democratic Alliance and the Left-Green Movement. Social Democrat minister J√≥hanna Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir was appointed Prime Minister, becoming the world's first openly homosexual head of government of the modern era. Elections took place in April 2009, and a continuing coalition government consisting of the Social Democrats and the Left-Green Movement was established in May 2009. The financial crisis gave rise to the Icesave dispute, where Iceland on the one hand and the United Kingdom and Netherlands on the other disputed whether Iceland was obligated to repay British and Dutch depositors who lost their savings when Icesave collapsed. The crisis resulted in the greatest migration from Iceland since 1887, with a net exodus of 5,000 people in 2009. Iceland's economy stabilized under the government of J√≥hanna Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir, and grew by 1.6% in 2012, but many Icelanders remained unhappy with the state of the economy and government austerity policies; the centre- right Independence Party was returned to power, in coalition with the Progressive Party, in the 2013 elections. On 1 August 2016, Gu√∞ni Th. J√≥hannesson became the new president of Iceland. Historiography =Division of history into named periods= While it is convenient to divide history into named periods, it is also misleading because the course of human events neither starts nor ends abruptly in most cases, and movements and influences often overlap. One period in Icelandic history, as Gunnar Karlsson describes, can be considered the period from 930 CE to 1262‚Äì1264, when there was no central government or leader, political power being characterised by chieftains (\\"go√∞ar\\"). This period is referred to therefore as the √æj√≥√∞veldis√∂ld or go√∞aveldis√∂ld (National or Chieftain State) period by Icelandic authors, and the Old Commonwealth or Freestate by English ones. There is little consensus on how to divide Icelandic history. Gunnar's own book A Brief History of Iceland (2010) has 33 chapters with considerable overlap in dates. J√≥n J. A√∞ils' 1915 text, √çslandssaga (A History of Iceland) uses ten periods: * Landn√°ms√∂ld (Settlement Age) c. 870‚Äì930 * S√∂gu√∂ld (Saga Age) 930‚Äì1030 * √çslenska kirkjan √≠ elstu t√≠√∞ (The early Icelandic church) 1030‚Äì1152 * Sturlunga√∂ld (Sturlung Age) 1152‚Äì1262 * √çsland undir stj√≥rn Noregskonunga og uppgangur kennimanna (Norwegian royal rule and the rise of the clergy) 1262‚Äì1400 * Kirkjuvald (Ecclesiastical power) 1400‚Äì1550 * Konungsvald (Royal authority) 1550‚Äì1683 * Einveldi og einokun (Absolutism and monopoly trading) 1683‚Äì1800 * Vi√∞reisnarbar√°tta (Campaign for restoration [of past glories]) 1801‚Äì1874 * Frams√≥kn (Progress) 1875‚Äì1915 In another of Gunnar's books, Iceland's 1100 Years (2000), Icelandic history is divided into four periods: * Colonisation and Commonwealth c. 870‚Äì1262 * Under foreign rule 1262 ‚Äì c. 1800 * A primitive society builds a state 1809‚Äì1918 * The great 20th-century transformation These are based mainly on forms of government, except for the last which reflects mechanisation of the fishing industry.

Although this name is found in some documents, it does not have official status.\\" is an island country at the confluence of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, east of Greenland and immediately south of the Arctic Circle, atop the constructive boundary of the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge about from Scotland and from New York City. One of the world's most sparsely populated countries, Iceland's boundaries are almost the same as the main island ‚Äì the world's 18th largest in area and possessing almost all of the country's area and population and also it is world's 9th largest island country. It is the westernmost European country and has more land covered by glaciers than in all of continental Europe. The total size is . It has an Exclusive Economic Zone of .  Statistics  Dettifoss, located in northeast Iceland. It is the largest waterfall in Europe in terms of volume discharge, with an average water flow of 200 m3/s. Iceland is an island country in Northern Europe, straddling the Eurasian and North American plates between the Greenland Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, northwest of the British Isles.

Twenty percent of the land is used for grazing, while only one percent is cultivated. Iceland has lost most of the woodland that previously covered large areas of the country, but an ambitious reforestation program is currently underway. Fossilized tree pollen and descriptions by the early settlers indicate that prior to human settlement, now thought to have occurred from around AD 800 onwards, trees covered between thirty and forty per cent of the island. Today, however, there are only small patches of the original birch forests left, the most prominent being Hallormssta√∞ask√≥gur and Vaglask√≥gur. The country of Iceland contains 36 islands. The longest river on the island is √ûj√≥rs√° at 230 kilometres (about 143 miles). Iceland has three national parks: Vatnaj√∂kull National Park, Sn√¶fellsj√∂kull National Park, and √ûingvellir National Park. The inhabited areas are on the coast, particularly in the southwest, while the central highlands are all but uninhabited. The island's terrain is mostly plateau interspersed with mountain peaks, icefields and a coast deeply indented by bays and fjords. = Highlands = Topographic map of Iceland. Areas in brown are 500 metres or greater above sea level with the large center mass making up the inhospitable Highlands. Glaciers shown in white. The Highlands make up about half of Iceland's land area, which is of recent volcanic origin and consists of a mountainous lava desert (highest elevation above sea level) and other wasteland. The area is mostly uninhabited. = Westfjords = The Westfjords region is composed of a large, mountainous peninsula on Iceland's northwestern coast. The coastline is marked by numerous fjords as its name suggests. The peninsula contains Iceland's northernmost glacier, Drangaj√∂kull. = Southern Peninsula = The Southern Peninsula, also known as the Reykjanes Peninsula, is located in the southwestern corner of Iceland. The area contains little vegetation because of active volcanism and large lava fields. There are hot springs and sulphur springs in the southern portion of the peninsula, in the Kleifarvatn lake and the Kr√Ωsuv√≠k geothermal area. = Capital Region = Home to Iceland's capital, Reykjav√≠k, the Capital Region is the most densely populated area in Iceland. It is located on the southwest coast of the island near the Southern Peninsula. The majority of Reykjavik is located on the Seltjarnarnes peninsula. Mount Esja, at 914 metres (2,999 ft), is the highest mountain in the vicinity of Reykjav√≠k. Several natural harbours exist and provide good fishing grounds. = West = Located in the western portion of the island and north of the Capital Region. In Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur fjord rests the second-tallest waterfall in Iceland, Glymur. West is also home to Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur, a fjord with volcanic activity such as Deildartunguhver- a powerful hotspring. The Hafnarfjall Mountain rises over the landscape. = South = The southern portion of Iceland contains some of its most notable volcanoes such as Hekla, Eldgj√° and Katla. Alongside the volcanoes exist numerous glaciers such as Vatnaj√∂kull, M√Ωrdalsj√∂kull and Eyjafjallaj√∂kull. Basalt columns and black sand beaches are examples of the volcanic activity of the area. The area also contains mountain ranges and Iceland's highest peak, Hvannadalshnj√∫kur, as well as the Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands) archipelago. = East = East Iceland contains the majority of the island's vegetation and birch forests. = Glaciers = M√Ωrdalsj√∂kull glacier Around 10.2 per cent of the total land area is covered by glaciers, although these are retreating at an accelerating rate. The four largest Icelandic glaciers are: *Vatnaj√∂kull (7,764 km¬≤) *Langj√∂kull (868 km¬≤) *Hofsj√∂kull (827 km¬≤) *M√Ωrdalsj√∂kull (542 km¬≤) Other notable glaciers include: *Drangaj√∂kull (145 km¬≤) *Eyjafjallaj√∂kull (70 km¬≤) *Tungnafellsj√∂kull (33 km¬≤) *√û√≥risj√∂kull (25 km¬≤) *Eir√≠ksj√∂kull (21 km¬≤) *√ûr√°ndarj√∂kull (16 km¬≤) *Tindfjallaj√∂kull (11 km¬≤) *Torfaj√∂kull (10 km¬≤) *Sn√¶fellsj√∂kull (10 km¬≤).  Climate  K√∂ppen climate classification zones of Iceland Because of the moderating influence of the North Atlantic Current, the climate is temperate and characterized by damp, cool summers and relatively mild but windy winters. Reykjav√≠k has an average temperature of in July and in January It has a K√∂ppen Climate Classification of Subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) with most of the island classified as Tundra (ET). Geology Iceland has extensive volcanic and geothermal activity. The rift associated with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which marks the division between the Eurasian Plate and North American tectonic plates, runs across Iceland from the southwest to the northeast. This geographic feature is prominent at the √ûingvellir National Park, where the promontory creates an extraordinary natural amphitheatre. The site was the home of Iceland's parliament, the Al√æing, which was first convened in 930. It is a common misconception that √ûingvellir is at the juncture between the North American and Eurasian continental plates. However, they are in fact at the juncture of the North American continental plate and a smaller plate (approx. 10,000 km2) called the Hreppar Microplate (Hreppaflekinn). From 1963 to 1967, the island of Surtsey was created on the southwest coast by a volcanic eruption. =Geological activity= Geysir A geologically young land, Iceland is located on both the Iceland hotspot and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which runs right through it. This location means that the island is highly geologically active with earthquakes and many volcanoes, notably Hekla, Eldgj√°, Her√∞ubrei√∞ and Eldfell. Eyjafjallaj√∂kull (1,666 m) erupted in 2010, disrupting European air traffic. Iceland has many geysers, including Geysir, from which the English word geyser is derived. With the widespread availability of geothermal power, and the harnessing of many rivers and waterfalls for hydroelectricity, most residents have access to inexpensive hot water, heating and electricity. The island is composed primarily of basalt, a low-silica lava associated with effusive volcanism as has occurred also in Hawaii. Iceland, however, has a variety of volcanic types (composite and fissure), many producing more evolved lavas such as rhyolite and andesite. Iceland has hundreds of volcanoes, with approximately 30 active volcanic systems.

Iceland is however the only NATO member which maintains no standing army. The Coast Guard consists of three ships and four aircraft and armed with small arms, naval artillery, and air defence radar stations. The Coast Guard also maintains the Iceland Air Defence System, formerly part of the disestablished Defence Agency, which conducts surveillance from the ground of Iceland's air space. Units subordinated to the National Commissioner also take part in Iceland's defences. Foremost of these are the National Security Unit, which handles intelligence operations, and the special unit V√≠kingasveitin, a highly trained and equipped counter-terrorism unit which is part of the National Police force. Additionally, there is a Crisis Response Unit (ICRU), operated by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, which is a small peacekeeping force that has been deployed internationally, since 2008. This unit also has an unarmed component. There is a treaty with the United States, which until 2006 maintained the Naval Air Station Keflavik, regarding the defence of Iceland. The base, now operated by the Icelandic Coast Guard, has been regularly visited by the US military and other allied NATO members. In 2017 the United States announced its interest in renovating a hangar, in order to accommodate a Boeing P-8 Poseidon ASW aircraft at the air base. There are also agreements concerning military and other security operations with Norway, DenmarkAftenposten: Norway to help defend Iceland and other NATO countries. Iceland holds the annual NATO exercises entitled Northern Viking. The most recent exercises were held in 2011, as well as the EOD exercise \\"Northern Challenge\\". In 1997 Iceland hosted its first Partnership for Peace (PfP) exercise, \\"Cooperative Safeguard\\", which is the only multilateral PfP exercise so far in which Russia has participated. Another major PfP exercise was hosted in 2000. Iceland has also contributed ICRU peacekeepers to SFOR, KFOR and ISAF.  History  H√°kon H√°konarson, King of Norway, and Sk√∫li B√°r√∞arson from Flateyjarb√≥k In the period from the settlement of Iceland, in the 870s, until it became part of the realm of the Norwegian King, military defences of Iceland consisted of multiple chieftains (Go√∞ar) and their free followers (√æingmenn, b√¶ndur or li√∞smenn) organised according to the standard Nordic military doctrine of the time in expeditionary armies such as the lei√∞angr. These armies were divided into units according to the quality of the warriors and by birth. At the end of this period, the number of chieftains had diminished and their power had grown, to the detriment of their followers. This resulted in a long and bloody civil war known as Age of the Sturlungs. A typical battle involved fewer than 1000 men. Amphibious operations were an important part of warfare in Iceland in this period, especially in the Westfjords, but large naval engagements were rare. The largest such engagement, known as Fl√≥abardagi, involved a few dozen ships in H√∫nafl√≥i (bay). In the decades before the Napoleonic wars, the few hundred militiamen in the southwest of Iceland were mainly equipped with rusty and mostly obsolete medieval weaponry, including 16th-century halberds. When English raiders arrived in 1808, after sinking or capturing most of the Danish- Norwegian Navy in the Battle of Copenhagen, the amount of gunpowder in Iceland was so small that the governor of Iceland, Count Trampe, could not offer any resistance. defence force in a trench on Va√∞lahei√∞i in 1940 In 1855, the Icelandic Army was re-established by Andreas August von Kohl, the sheriff in Vestmannaeyjar. In 1856, the king provided 180 rixdollars to buy guns, and a further 200 rixdollars the following year. The sheriff became the Captain of the new army, which become known as Herfylkingin, \\"The Battalion\\". In 1860 von Kohl died, and P√©tur Bjarnasen took over command. Nine years later Bjarnasen died without appointing a successor, and the army fell into disarray. Agnar Kofoed Hansen training his officers in the arts of war in 1940 In 1918, Iceland regained sovereignty as a separate kingdom under the Danish king. Iceland established a Coast Guard shortly afterwards, but it was financially impossible to establish a standing army. The government hoped that a permanent neutrality would shield the country from invasion. But at the onset of Second World War, the government was concerned about a possible invasion, and decided to expand the Icelandic National Police (R√≠kisl√∂greglan) and its reserves into a military unit. Chief Commissioner of Police Agnar Kofoed Hansen had been trained in the Danish Army and he moved to train his officers. Weapons and uniforms were acquired, and they practised rifleshooting and military tactics near Laugarvatn. Hansen barely managed to train his 60 officers before the United Kingdom's invasion of Iceland on 10 May 1940. The next planned step towards strengthening the army was to train the 300 strong reserve forces, but this was prevented by the invasion. During the Second World War, the United States took over the defense of Iceland from the British, and this arrangement continued well after the war, eventually codified in the Agreed Minute. In 1949 Iceland was a founding member of NATO and was the sole member that did not have a standing army, joining NATO on the condition that it would not be expected to establish one. However, its strategic geographic position in the Atlantic made it an invaluable member. Expansion of forces by Iceland was therefore concentrated primarily in the Icelandic Coast Guard, which saw action in a series of confrontations with British fishing vessels and Royal Navy warships known as the Cod Wars. The Iceland Defense Force (IDF) was a military command of the United States Armed Forces from 1951 to 2006. The IDF, created at the request of NATO, came into existence when the United States signed an agreement to provide for the defense of Iceland. The IDF also consisted of civilian Icelanders and military members of other NATO nations. The IDF was downsized after the end of the Cold War and the U.S. Air Force maintained four to six interceptor aircraft at the Naval Air Station Keflavik, until they were withdrawn on 30 September 2006. Since May 2008, NATO nations have periodically deployed fighters to patrol Icelandic airspace under the Icelandic Air Policing mission. During the Icesave dispute with the British and Dutch governments, Iceland made it clear that UK patrols in its airspace were not appropriate given the state of affairs and subsequently on 14 November 2008 the UK had to cancel its patrols and defense of the Icelandic airspace, which before the dispute had been scheduled to start in December 2008. After withdrawal of US forces in 2006, Iceland reorganized some military functions in the form of the Icelandic Defence Agency (Varnarm√°lastofnun √çslands) founded in 2008. under the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Agency took over operations at Naval Air Station Keflavik, but was closed in 2011 in the wake of the economic crisis, with functions distributed to the existing organizations. 23px Icelandic Army Regimental Standard of the 19th century Army  Coast Guard  T√Ωr in the center. Shortly after Iceland reclaimed its sovereignty in 1918, the Icelandic Coast Guard was founded. Its first vessel, a former Danish research vessel, was armed with a 57 mm cannon. The Coast Guard is responsible for protecting Iceland's sovereignty and vital interests including the most valuable natural resource‚Äîits fishing areas‚Äîas well as providing security, search, and rescue services to Iceland's fishing fleet. In 1952, 1958, 1972, and 1975, the government progressively expanded Iceland's exclusive economic zone to 4, 12, 50 and then . This led to a conflict with the United Kingdom, among other states, known as the \\"Cod Wars\\". The Icelandic Coast Guard and the Royal Navy confronted each other on several occasions during these years. Although few rounds were fired, there were many intense moments. Today the Coast Guard remains Iceland's premier fighting force equipped with armed patrol vessels and aircraft and partaking in peacekeeping operations in foreign lands. The Coast Guard has four vessels and four aircraft (one fixed wing and three helicopters) at their disposal. = Iceland Air Defence System = Structure of the Icelandic Forces The Iceland Air Defence System or √çslenska Loftvarnarkerfi√∞ was founded in 1987, and operates four radar complexes, a software and support facility and a command and report centre. It is a part of the Coast Guard. Iceland's NATO allies also regularly deploy fighter aircraft to patrol the country's airspace as part of the Icelandic Air Policing mission.  Icelandic Crisis Response Unit  The Icelandic Crisis Response Unit (ICRU) (or √çslenska fri√∞arg√¶slan or \\"The Icelandic Peacekeeping Guard\\") is an expeditionary peacekeeping force maintained by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. It is manned by personnel from Iceland's other services, armed or not, including the National Police, Coast Guard, Emergency Services and Health-care system. Because of the military nature of most of the ICRU's assignments, all of its members receive basic infantry combat training. This training has often been conducted by the Norwegian Army, but the Coast Guard and the Special forces are also assigned to train the ICRU. Most of the ICRU's camouflage and weaponry is procured from abroad, with some indigenous development. Some arms and uniforms are also borrowed from the Norwegian Defence Forces. The formation and employment of the unit has met controversy in Iceland, especially by people to the left on the political scale. In October 2004, three ICRU soldiers were wounded in a suicide bombing in Kabul. The incident led to tough questioning of the group's commander, Colonel Halli Sigur√∞sson, focusing on his conduct. Later the command was passed to Lt. Colonel Gardar Forberg followed by Colonel L√°rus Atlason. In 2008, the uniformed ICRU deployed personnel still armed for self- defense returned their weapons and changed to civilian clothing. The policy since 2008 is that, unless under special circumstances, ICRU personnel do not wear uniforms or carry weapons. = ICRU missions = The ICRU has been or is operating in: ICRU missions * Military missions: ** within ISAF ** within NTM-1 (and the Coast Guard within Dancon/Irak) ** , within KFOR * Civilian missions: ** within EUPM ** within MACC-SL ** within SLMM  List of small- arms used by Icelandic forces  * Glock 17 ‚Äî Side-Arm (Pistol) * AG-3 ‚Äî Assault Rifle * Heckler & Koch MP5 ‚Äî Sub-Machine Gun * Blaser R93 ‚Äî Sniper Rifle * Rheinmetall MG3 General-Purpose Machine Gun  See also  * Naval Air Station Keflavik * Cod Wars * List of countries by military expenditures * List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel * List of countries without armed forces  References   Further reading  * Birgir Loftsson, Herna√∞arsaga √çslands : 1170‚Äì1581, Pjaxi.

The Republic of Iceland was founded in 1944. The Icelandic foreign service grew slowly in the post-WWII period, but increased rapidly after the mid-1990s. Iceland's closest relations are with the Nordic states, the European Union and the United States. Iceland has been a member of the United Nations since 1946. Iceland was a founding member of the World Bank in 1946 and NATO in 1949. In terms of European integration, Iceland joined the EFTA in 1970, the EEA in 1992, and Schengen in 2001. From 1951 to 2006, there was an American military base and troop presence in Iceland. During the Cold War, Iceland had a close but contentious relationship with the United States, leading some scholars to describe Iceland as a \\"rebellious ally\\" and \\"reluctant ally.\\" Iceland repeatedly threatened to leave NATO or cancel the US defence agreement during the Cold War. As a consequence, the United States provided Iceland with extensive economic assistance and diplomatic support. Iceland hosted the historic 1986 Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Reykjav√≠k, which set the stage for the end of the Cold War.  Fishing rights  Iceland's principal historical international disputes involved disagreements over fishing rights. Conflict with the United Kingdom led to the so-called Cod Wars in 1952‚Äì56 because of the extension of the fishing zone from 3 to 4 nautical miles (6 to 7 km), 1958‚Äì61 because of extending the fishing zone to 12 nautical miles (22 km) in 1972‚Äì73 because of its further extension to 50 nautical miles (93 km) and in 1975‚Äì76 because of its extension to 200 nautical miles (370 km). Disagreements with Norway and Russia over fishing rights in the Barents Sea were successfully resolved in 2000.  Whaling  Certain environmentalists are concerned that Iceland left the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in June 1992 in protest of an IWC decision to refuse to lift the ban on whaling, after the IWC Scientific Committee had determined that the taking of certain species could safely be resumed. That year, Iceland established a separate commission ‚Äì along with Norway, Greenland and the Faroe Islands ‚Äì for the conservation, management, and study of marine mammals. Since then, Iceland has resumed whaling for scientific purpose and has rejoined the IWC (in October 2002). The Icelandic Fisheries Ministry issued a permit to hunt 39 whales for commercial purposes on 17 October 2006. 25 states delivered a formal diplomatic protest to the Icelandic government on 1 November concerning resumed commercial whaling. The protest was led by the United Kingdom and supported by others such as Finland and Sweden.  Recognition of post-Soviet states  Iceland was the first country to recognize the regained independence of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan from the USSR in 1990‚Äì1991. Similarly, it was the first country to recognize Montenegro's independence from its former union with Serbia. Iceland was also the first country to recognize Croatia, having done so on 19 December 1991. Significantly, Iceland was also the first Western state to recognise Palestine when it did so in 2011. Iceland also is the greatest Nordic contributor per capita to NATO-led troops in Bosnia and Kosovo, to the police in Bosnia and to Bosnian/Kosovan reconstruction, resettlement and relief efforts. Membership in international organizations Iceland is a member of the following organisations: North Atlantic Treaty Organisation; Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe; International Criminal Court; International Bank for Reconstruction and Development; International Development Association; International Finance Corporation; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; European Economic Area; European Free Trade Association; Council of Europe; International Criminal Police Organization; and the United Nations, since 19 November 1946, and most of its specialized agencies, including the International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization, International Atomic Energy Agency, International Civil Aviation Organization, International Labour Organization, International Maritime Organization, International Telecommunication Union, United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, Universal Postal Union, World Health Organization, World Meteorological Organization and the International Whaling Commission. The Icelandic government currently finances two Programs of the United Nations University that are located in Iceland: the Geothermal Training Programme since 1979 and the Fisheries Training Programme since 1998. Iceland was given the opportunity to join the League of Nations after becoming sovereign in 1918, but opted not to, primarily due to limited administrative resources. Iceland joined the UN in 1945 but took until 1965 to establish a permanent mission. In the IMF, Iceland is in the Nordic-Baltic constituency of the 24-member executive board of the IMF, along with Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. International disputes =Rockall= Iceland has an ongoing dispute with Denmark (on behalf of the Faroe Islands) on the one hand and with the UK and Ireland on the other hand, concerning claims to the continental shelf in the Hatton‚ÄìRockall area of the North Atlantic under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982). Iceland's claim covers virtually the entire area claimed by the other three countries, except for a small portion in the south-east corner of the Irish claim,Regulation 196/1985. while the Faroes claim most of the area claimed by the UK and Ireland.Source: Icelandic Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Negotiations continue between the four countries in the hope of making a joint proposal to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf by May 2009. =Deposit insurance= Following the collapse of Icesave sparking the 2008‚Äì2011 Icelandic financial crisis, the U.K. and the Netherlands offered to insure the deposits of the bank's customers. They then sought repayment from Iceland, which held a referendum on the issue in 2010 and 2011, both of which failed. The two governments then said they would take the issue to European courts to seek redress they alleged is owed to them. In January 2013 the EFTA court cleared Iceland of all charges.  European Union application  Iceland's reluctance to join the EU's Common Fisheries Policy is a major stumbling bloc to accession Iceland has had a close relationship with the European Union (EU) throughout its development, but has remained outside (instead, joining the European Free Trade Area or EFTA). In 1972, the two sides signed a free trade agreement and in 1994 Iceland joined the European Economic Area which let itself and other non-EU states have access to the EU's internal market in exchange for Iceland contributing funds and applying EU law in relevant areas. The EU is Iceland's most important trading partner with a strong trade surplus in 2008/9 in terms of goods, services and foreign direct investment. Iceland also participates in the Schengen Area (as well as relevant police and judicial cooperation) and has non-voting representation in some EU agencies.Iceland, European CommissionIceland, EEAS However, after Iceland's financial crash in 2008, it has sought membership of the EU and the euro. Iceland applied on 16 July 2009 and negotiations formally began 17 June 2011.Timeline of events ‚Äì Iceland's application for membership of the EU , Icelandic Ministry for Foreign Affairs After an agreement is concluded, the accession treaty must be ratified by every EU state and be subject to a national referendum in Iceland.National Referendum ‚Äì Iceland's application for membership of the EU , Icelandic Ministry for Foreign Affairs Since the application was submitted, popular support has declined and contentious issues around Icelandic fisheries may derail negotiations. However the Icelandic government is confident an agreement can be reached based on the flexibility shown by the EU in its previous negotiations with Norway. In 2014, Iceland froze their application to join the European Union.  Agreed Minute  The Agreed Minute was a statute governing the nature of the U.S. military presence in Iceland. The Agreed Minute was last renegotiated in 2001. At the time, the U.S. Air Force committed itself to maintaining four to six interceptors at the Keflav√≠k base, supported by a helicopter rescue squad. The Air Force, in order to cut costs, announced plans to remove the four remaining jets in 2003. The removal was then delayed to address Icelandic demands for continued presence of the jets. After an unfruitful series of negotiations and two reshuffles of the Icelandic government the issue lay dormant until early 2006 when the U.S. Air Force issued an official statement that withdrawal of the aircraft was already being prepared. U.S. officials have since then argued that Iceland is in no need of a military presence. NATO allies since then conduct air policing after the U.S. Air Force withdrawal.  Bilateral Relations  Iceland's first embassy was established in Copenhagen in 1920. The second and third embassies were opened in London and Sweden in 1940. That same year, a consulate-general was installed in New York (a year later, an embassy was opened in Washington D.C.). The Icelandic foreign service grew slowly (both in terms of missions and staff) in the post-WWII period, but increased rapidly after the mid-1990s. The Icelandic foreign service is vastly smaller than those of its Nordic neighbors. =Africa= { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"width:100%; margin:auto;\\" !width=\\"15%\\" Country !width=\\"12%\\" Formal Relations Began !Notes --valign=\\"top\\"  Burkina Faso is represented in Iceland by its embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. --valign=\\"top\\"  * Djibouti is accredited to Iceland from its embassy in Paris, France. * Iceland is accredited to Djibouti from its embassy in Kampala, Uganda. --valign=\\"top\\"  * Iceland is accredited to Kenya from its embassy in Kampala, Uganda * Kenya is accredited to Iceland from its embassy in Stockholm, Sweden. --valign=\\"top\\"  * Iceland has an embassy in Lilongwe. * Malawi is accredited to Iceland from its high commission in London. --valign=\\"top\\"  *Mauritania is represented in Iceland by its embassy in Brussels, Belgium. *Iceland is represented in Mauritania by its Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Reykjav√≠k. --valign=\\"top\\"  * Iceland is accredited to Mozambique from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Reykjavik and maintains an honorary consulate in Maputo. * Mozambique is accredited to Iceland from its embassy in Stockholm, Sweden. --valign=\\"top\\"  * Iceland is accredited to South Africa from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Reykjavik. * South Africa is accredited to Iceland from its embassy in Oslo, Norway. - valign=\\"top\\" See Iceland‚ÄìTunisia relations --valign=\\"top\\"  * Iceland has an embassy in Kampala. * Uganda is accredited to Iceland from its embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. } = Americas = { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"width:100%; margin:auto;\\" - ! style=\\"width:15%;\\" Country ! style=\\"width:12%;\\" Formal Relations Began !Notes --valign=\\"top\\" 1952  * Argentina is accredited to Iceland from its embassy in Oslo, Norway. * Iceland is accredited to Argentina from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Reykjavik and maintains an honorary consulate Buenos Aires. --valign=\\"top\\" 1979  Both countries established diplomatic relations on 9 April 1979. --valign=\\"top\\" 2004  Both countries have established diplomatic relations on 7 July 2004. --valign=\\"top\\" 1952  * Brazil is accredited to Iceland from its embassy in Oslo, Norway and maintains an honorary consulate in Reykjavik. * Iceland is accredited to Brazil from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Reykjavik and maintains honorary consulates in Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo. --valign=\\"top\\" 1947See Canada‚ÄìIceland relations * Canada has an embassy in Reykjavik. * Iceland has an embassy in Ottawa and a consulate-general in Winnipeg. --valign=\\"top\\"  * Chile is accredited to Iceland from its embassy in Oslo, Norway. * Iceland is accredited to Chile from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Reykjavik. --valign=\\"top\\"  * Colombia is accredited to Iceland from its embassy in Stockholm, Sweden. * Iceland is accredited to Colombia from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Reykjavik. --valign=\\"top\\"  * Cuba is accredited to Iceland from its embassy in Stockholm, Sweden. * Iceland is accredited to Cuba from its Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York City. --valign=\\"top\\" 2004 *Both countries established diplomatic relations in 2004. *Iceland is represented in Dominica through its embassy in New York City, United States.

Kaufman and Moss Hart. The original production of the play premiered on Broadway in 1936, and played for 838 performances. The play won the 1937 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and was adapted for the screen as You Can't Take It with You in 1938, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Director. The play is popular among theater programs of high school institutions, and has been one of the 10 most-produced school plays every year since amateur rights came available in 1939. Plot = Act One = The story takes place entirely in the large house of a slightly odd New York City family. Various characters in the lives of the Vanderhof-Sycamore-Carmichael clan are introduced in the first act. The patriarch of the family, Grandpa Vanderhof, is an whimsical old man who keeps snakes and has never paid his income tax. Penelope \\"Penny\\" Vanderhof Sycamore is his daughter (a writer of adventure- and sex-filled melodrama plays), and is married to Paul Sycamore, a tinkerer who manufactures fireworks in the basement with the help of his assistant, Mr. De Pinna, who used to be the family's iceman. One of Paul and Penny's two daughters is Essie Sycamore Carmichael, a childish candymaker who dreams of being a ballerina (but in reality is terrible at dancing). Essie is married to Ed Carmichael, a xylophone player who lives with them and helps distribute Essie's candies. Ed is an amateur printer who prints any phrase that sounds catchy. Paul and Penny's other daughter Alice Sycamore is quite obviously the only \\"normal\\" family member. She has an office job and is sometimes embarrassed by the eccentricities of her family, yet deep down, she still loves them. In addition, the Vanderhof-Sycamore-Carmichael clan employs a maid, Rheba, who is dating Donald, a handyman who performs odd jobs for the Sycamores. Essie tells Grandpa Vanderhof that some letters have arrived for him from the \\"United States Government\\", but that she misplaced them. Shortly afterwards, Alice comes home and announces that she has fallen in love with a young man with whom she works, Tony Kirby, the son of the company's executive. Before going upstairs to change, Alice tells her family that he will be coming over shortly to take her on a date. The entire family is still joyfully discussing her boyfriend when the doorbell rings. Penny answers the door and greets the man standing there, thinking he must be Tony, but only after forcing the stranger to shake hands with the entire family do they realize that he is not Alice's boyfriend: He is a tax investigator. His name is Wilbur C. Henderson, and he is investigating Grandpa for his evasion of income tax. When Henderson asks Grandpa why he owed twenty-four years of back income tax, Grandpa states he never believed in it, and that the government wouldn't know what to do with the money if he did pay it. Henderson becomes infuriated by Grandpa's answers to his questions. Henderson spots Grandpa's snakes, and runs out of the house in fear, but not before promising Grandpa that he will hear ‚Äì one way or another ‚Äì from the United States government. The real Tony Kirby arrives, and Alice is nervous that her eccentric family will scare him away, so she attempts to leave with him on their date. As they attempt to leave, Mr. Boris Kolenkhov, Essie's extremely eccentric Russian ballet instructor, arrives and makes chitchat with the family, complaining about the Revolution. During this discussion, Alice and Tony make their escape. Then the rest of the family sit down for dinner. = Act Two = The second act takes place a few days later. Alice has invited Tony and his father and mother over for dinner the next evening, and it is the only thing on the entire family's mind. Alice runs around the house telling her family to try to act as normal as possible. Penny has brought actress Gay Wellington over to read over Penny's latest play, but Gay becomes very drunk, and passes out onto the living room couch after looking at the snakes. Ed returns from distributing Essie's candies, worried that he is being followed by someone. When Mr. De Pinna looks out the window, he sees no one other than a man walking away. Ed is still sent out by Essie to deliver more candies. Paul and Mr. De Pinna are downstairs the whole time making fireworks. Mr. De Pinna comes up from the basement carrying a painting that Penny had started of him as a discus thrower. Mr. De Pinna asks if Penny would finish it and she agrees. She leaves to put on her painting gear and Mr. De Pinna leaves to put on his costume. At the same time, Mr. Kolenkhov arrives and begins Essie's ballet lesson. Ed provides accompanying music on the xylophone. Rheba runs in and out of the kitchen cleaning. Grandpa takes this time to practice darts and feed the snakes. In the midst of all this hullabaloo, Tony appears in the doorway with Mr. Kirby and Mrs. Kirby. Before them is the entire eccentric spectacle. Apparently, Tony has forgotten for which night dinner was planned, and Alice is incredibly embarrassed. Penny tells Alice not to worry, and that they can manage a nice dinner easily. She gives a list of things to Donald and tells him to run down to the store. Grandpa tries desperately to keep the party normal and under control for the sake of his granddaughter. Mr. Kirby reveals himself to be a very straitlaced fat-cat, who raises orchids as a hobby. Mr. Kirby investigates a child's model and finds it is Paul's \\"hobby\\". Mrs. Kirby tells them that her true passion is spiritualism, which Penny derides as a \\"fake\\". During a discussion of hobbies, Mr. Kolenkhov brings up that the Romans' hobby was wrestling, and demonstrates on Mr. Kirby by throwing him on the floor. To pass the time after this awkward incident, Penny suggests they play a free association game. Alice imagines what is coming and immediately tries to quash the suggestions, but Penny shrugs her off and instructs everyone to write down \\"the first thing that pops into their heads\\" after she says certain words. Penny offers the words \\"potato\\", \\"bathroom\\", \\"lust\\", \\"honeymoon\\", and \\"sex\\". Penny reads Mr. Kirby's list first, with reactions of, respectively: \\"steak\\", \\"toothpaste\\", \\"unlawful\\", \\"trip\\", and \\"male\\". Mrs. Kirby's list, however, causes much controversy. \\"Starch\\" is her response to potatoes, which is not that bad, but her response for \\"bathroom\\" is \\"Mr. Kirby\\", and she covers it up with the fact that Mr. Kirby spends a lot of time in there \\"bathing and shaving\\". Her response to \\"lust\\" is \\"human\\", claiming it is a perfectly human emotion. Mr. Kirby disagrees, saying \\"it is depraved\\". \\"Honeymoon\\"'s reply is \\"dull\\", as Mrs. Kirby explains that there was \\"nothing to do at night\\". The shocker comes when Mrs. Kirby says her reply to \\"sex\\" was \\"Wall Street\\". She at first claims she doesn't know what she meant by it, but once provoked she yells at Mr. Kirby \\"You're always talking about Wall Street, even when ...\\" and then stops. Wholly embarrassed and humiliated, Mr. Kirby and Mrs. Kirby order Tony home with them immediately but Tony refuses to go. Alice finally decides that their marriage will never work and ends their engagement, and also decides to resign her job at Kirby's company. Before the Kirbys can leave, Department of Justice agents come through the door. The head agent tells them that Ed's pamphlets from the candy boxes, on which he has printed anything that \\"sounds nice\\", read \\"DYNAMITE THE CAPITOL\\", \\"DYNAMITE THE WHITE HOUSE\\", \\"DYNAMITE THE SUPREME COURT\\", and \\"GOD IS THE STATE, THE STATE IS GOD\\". Grandpa tries to explain to the head agent, but he informs them they are all under arrest. The agents discover enormous amounts of gunpowder in the basement and think it is for dynamiting Washington, and one agent returns from the basement dragging Mr. De Pinna with him, who was in the basement the whole time. De Pinna desperately tries to explain to the agent that he had left his lit pipe downstairs and must go and get it, but the agent disregards him. Meanwhile, another agent brings down Gay Wellington from upstairs, singing drunkenly. At that point, the fireworks in the basement go off, lit by De Pinna's untended pipe, and everyone (aside from Grandpa and Wellington) panics, leaving the whole house in an uproar as Act II ends. = Act Three = The next day, Donald and Rheba sit in the kitchen reading the paper, which focuses on the story of both families being arrested, with Mr. Kirby's presence causing the story to make headlines. Also, Paul and Mr. De Pinna's fireworks have been completely destroyed. Meanwhile, Alice has decided to leave for a prolonged trip to the Adirondack Mountains to think things over. When the family forgets to call for a cab, she finally shows her exasperation, angered that her family can't be \\"normal\\" at all. Tony then arrives and tries to reason with Alice, but she refuses, heading upstairs with Tony following. Soon, Mr. Kolenkhov appears with the Grand Duchess Olga Katrina, in all of her former glory. After discussing the sad fate of former Russian royalty now working menial jobs in New York, the Grand Duchess soon insists upon going into the kitchen to cook the dinner for the family. Mr. Kirby arrives to pick up Tony and to settle his score with Grandpa. Soon, Mr. Kirby and Tony get into a heated argument, the pinnacle of which finds Tony admitting that he had purposely brought his family on the wrong night, the night before. He explains that he wanted each family to see each other as they really were, and that he sees the Sycamores as \\"normal\\", that they are a family that loves and understands one another, saying that Mr. Kirby never had time to understand Tony. Grandpa tells Mr. Kirby that he's happy with no longer working and getting to enjoy life every day, and that has made him happy ever since, though Mr. Kirby is not convinced, especially as Grandpa suspects that Mr. Kirby doesn't like his job. Tony affirms this by pointing out that he found letters that Mr. Kirby had written to his father, expressing desires to be a trapeze artist and later a saxophone player, and that Mr. Kirby still has a saxophone in his closet. Grandpa tells Mr. Kirby that he should get to enjoy his life and riches now while he can, pointing out, \\"you can't take it with you\\". Tony agrees with this, deciding to leave the family business to do something he wants to do, and Mr. Kirby finally gives in, giving his blessings to Alice and Tony getting back together, which they do. Essie then brings a letter to Grandpa that's from the government. Grandpa had lied to the government that he was actually Martin Vanderhof Jr., and that the Martin Vanderhof the government was looking for was his father. This is corroborated because the family had buried the deceased milkman (who had lived with them prior to De Pinna) using Grandpa's name, since they never knew the milkman's real name. Grandpa's trick works, as the government tells him that they now owe him a refund, instead of him owing them taxes. The play comes to a conclusion as the family, along with Tony and Mr. Kirby, sit down to dinner with the Grand Duchess. Grandpa says a touching prayer, and then they dive into the food.

Directed by Scott Ellis, the cast stars James Earl Jones as Martin Vanderhof, Rose Byrne as Alice Sycamore, Elizabeth Ashley as The Grand Duchess Olga, Annaleigh Ashford as Essie Carmichael, Johanna Day as Mrs. Kirby, Julie Halston as Gay Wellington, Byron Jennings as Mr. Kirby, Mark Linn-Baker as Paul Sycamore, Crystal Dickinson as Rheba, Patrick Kerr as Mr. De Pinna, Will Brill as Ed, Marc Damon Johnson as Donald, Reg Rogers as Boris Kolenkhov, Fran Kranz as Tony Kirby, Kristine Nielsen as Penelope Sycamore, Karl Kenzler as Henderson, and the G-Men played by Nick Corley, Austin Durant, and Joe Tapper. Understudies include Corley, Barrett Doss, Durant, Ned Noyes, Pippa Pearthree, Tapper, and Charles Turner.Staff. \\"The Verdict: Critics Review 'You Can't Take It With You', Starring James Earl Jones and Elizabeth Ashley, on Broadway\\" playbill.com, September 28, 2014 Film and TV adaptations James Stewart and Jean Arthur in You Can't Take It With You (1938) The play was the basis for the 1938 film directed by Frank Capra. The film cast included James Stewart, Jean Arthur, Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold, Spring Byington, Ann Miller, Dub Taylor, Charles Lane, Mischa Auer, Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson, and the uncredited Arthur Murray. It was awarded the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Director of 1938. The film version has the same overall plot and themes as the play but includes new scenes, dialogue, and slightly different characterizations, such as a side plot about Kirby Sr.'s attempt to acquire the Vanderhof house for a real estate development, and removed the side plot of Grand Duchess Olga Katrina. CBS produced a notable television adaptation of the original play in 1979. It featured Art Carney as Grandpa, along with Jean Stapleton, Beth Howland, Blythe Danner, Robert Mandan, Harry Morgan, Barry Bostwick, Kenneth Mars, Howard Hesseman and Polly Holliday. A second television adaptation was produced in 1984 by Public Broadcasting Service. This version, featuring Jason Robards as Grandpa was based on the Broadway revival and filmed at Royale Theatre, New York City and was included in Great Performances (November 21, 1984). A syndicated situation comedy based on the play, produced by NBC, ran in the United States during the 1987-1988 season. Harry Morgan, who had played Mr. De Pinna in the 1979 telefilm, appeared in the series as Grandpa.

This is an interdisciplinary practice that describes systems with interacting components, applicable to biology, cybernetics and other fields. Bertalanffy proposed that the classical laws of thermodynamics might be applied to closed systems, but not necessarily to \\"open systems\\" such as living things. His mathematical model of an organism's growth over time, published in 1934, is still in use today. Bertalanffy grew up in Austria and subsequently worked in Vienna, London, Canada, and the United States.  Biography  Ludwig von Bertalanffy was born and grew up in the little village of Atzgersdorf (now Liesing) near Vienna. The Bertalanffy family had roots in the 16th century nobility of Hungary which included several scholars and court officials.T.E. Weckowicz (1989). Ludwig von Bertalanffy (1901-1972): A Pioneer of General Systems Theory. Working paper Feb 1989. p.2 His grandfather Charles Joseph von Bertalanffy (1833‚Äì1912) had settled in Austria and was a state theatre director in Klagenfurt, Graz and Vienna, which were important sites in imperial Austria. Ludwig's father Gustav von Bertalanffy (1861‚Äì1919) was a prominent railway administrator. On his mother's side Ludwig's grandfather Joseph Vogel was an imperial counsellor and a wealthy Vienna publisher. Ludwig's mother Charlotte Vogel was seventeen when she married the thirty- four-year-old Gustav. They divorced when Ludwig was ten, and both remarried outside the Catholic Church in civil ceremonies.Mark Davidson (1983). Uncommon Sense: The Life and Thought of Ludwig Von Bertalanffy. Los Angeles: J. P. Tarcher. p.49 Ludwig von Bertalanffy grew up as an only child educated at home by private tutors until he was ten. When he arrived at his Gymnasium (a form of grammar school) he was already well habituated in learning by reading, and he continued to study on his own. His neighbour, the famous biologist Paul Kammerer, became a mentor and an example to the young Ludwig.Bertalanffy Center for the Study of Systems Science, page: His Life - Bertalanffy's Origins and his First Education. Retrieved 2009-04-27 In 1918, Bertalanffy started his studies at the university level in philosophy and art history, first at the University of Innsbruck and then at the University of Vienna. Ultimately, Bertalanffy had to make a choice between studying philosophy of science and biology; he chose the latter because, according to him, one could always become a philosopher later, but not a biologist. In 1926 he finished his PhD thesis (Fechner und das Problem der Integration h√∂herer Ordnung, translated title: Fechner and the Problem of Higher-Order Integration) on the psychologist and philosopher Gustav Theodor Fechner. For the next six years he concentrated on a project of \\"theoretical biology\\" which focused on the philosophy of biology. He received his habilitation in 1934 in \\"theoretical biology\\". Bertalanffy was appointed Privatdozent at the University of Vienna in 1934. The post yielded little income, and Bertalanffy faced continuing financial difficulties. He applied for promotion to the status of associate professor, but funding from the Rockefeller Foundation enabled him to make a trip to Chicago in 1937 to work with Nicolas Rashevsky. He was also able to visit the Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts. Bertalanffy was still in the US when he heard of the Anschluss in March 1938. However, his attempts to remain in the US failed, and he returned to Vienna in October of that year. Within a month of his return, he joined the Nazi Party, which facilitated his promotion to professor at the University of Vienna in 1940. During the Second World War, he linked his \\"organismic\\" philosophy of biology to the dominant Nazi ideology, principally that of the F√ºhrerprinzip. Following the defeat of Nazism, Bertalanffy found denazification problematic and left Vienna in 1948. He moved to the University of London (1948‚Äì49); the Universit√© de Montr√©al (1949); the University of Ottawa (1950‚Äì54); the University of Southern California (1955‚Äì58); the Menninger Foundation (1958‚Äì60); the University of Alberta (1961‚Äì68); and the State University of New York at Buffalo (SUNY) (1969‚Äì72). In 1972, he died from a heart attack. =Family life= Bertalanffy met his wife, Maria, in April 1924 in the Austrian Alps. They were hardly ever apart for the next forty-eight years.Davidson, p. 51 She wanted to finish studying but never did, instead devoting her life to Bertalanffy's career. Later, in Canada, she would work both for him and with him in his career, and after his death she compiled two of Bertalanffy's last works. They had one child, a son who followed in his father's footsteps by making his profession in the field of cancer research.  Work  Today, Bertalanffy is considered to be a founder and one of the principal authors of the interdisciplinary school of thought known as general systems theory. According to Weckowicz (1989), he \\"occupies an important position in the intellectual history of the twentieth century. His contributions went beyond biology, and extended into cybernetics, education, history, philosophy, psychiatry, psychology and sociology. Some of his admirers even believe that this theory will one day provide a conceptual framework for all these disciplines\\". = Individual growth model = The individual growth model published by Ludwig von Bertalanffy in 1934 is widely used in biological models and exists in a number of permutations. In its simplest version the so-called Bertalanffy growth equation is expressed as a differential equation of length (L) over time (t): L'(t) = r_B \\\\left( L_\\\\infty - L(t) \\\\right) when r_B is the Bertalanffy growth rate and L_\\\\infty the ultimate length of the individual. This model was proposed earlier by August Friedrich Robert P≈´tter (1879-1929), writing in 1920.August Friedrich Robert P≈´tter (6 April 1879 - 11 March 1929) wrote a textbook on comparative physiology entitled Vergleichende Physiologie (Jena: G. Fischer, 1911) and many other notable works. For a translation of his \\"Studien ≈´ber physiologische √Ñhnlichkeit. VI. Wachstums√§hnlichkeiten\\" (\\"Studies on Physiological Similarity. VI. Analogies of Growth\\") in Pfl≈´gers Archiv f≈´r die gesamte Physiologie des Menschen und der Tiere, 180: 298-340, see http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/147555.pdf The dynamic energy budget theory provides a mechanistic explanation of this model in the case of isomorphs that experience a constant food availability. The inverse of the Bertalanffy growth rate appears to depend linearly on the ultimate length, when different food levels are compared. The intercept relates to the maintenance costs, the slope to the rate at which reserve is mobilized for use by metabolism. The ultimate length equals the maximum length at high food availabilities.Bertalanffy, L. von, (1934). Untersuchungen √ºber die Gesetzlichkeit des Wachstums. I. Allgemeine Grundlagen der Theorie; mathematische und physiologische Gesetzlichkeiten des Wachstums bei Wassertieren. Arch. Entwicklungsmech., 131:613-652. Passive electrical schematic of the Bertalanffy module together with equivalent expression in the Energy Systems Language = Bertalanffy equation = The Bertalanffy equation is the equation that describes the growth of a biological organism. The equation was offered by Ludwig von Bertalanffy in 1969.Bertalanffy, L. von, (1969). General System Theory. New York: George Braziller, pp. 136 \\\\frac{dW}{dt}= \\\\eta S- k V Here W is organism weight, t is the time, S is the area of organism surface, and V is a physical volume of the organism. The coefficients \\\\eta and k are (by Bertalanffy's definition) the \\"coefficient of anabolism\\" and \\"coefficient of catabolism\\" respectively. The solution of the Bertalanffy equation is the function: W(t)=\\\\Big(\\\\eta\\\\,c_1 -c_2\\\\,e^{-\\\\tfrac{k}{3}t}\\\\Big)^3\\\\,, where c_1 and c_2 are the certain constants. Bertalanffy couldn't explain the meaning of the parameters \\\\eta (the coefficient of anabolism) and k (coefficient of catabolism) in his works, and that caused a fair criticism from biologists. But the Bertalanffy equation is a special case of the Tetearing equation, that is a more general equation of the growth of a biological organism. The Tetearing equation determines the physical meaning of the coefficients \\\\eta and k . =Bertalanffy module= To honour Bertalanffy, ecological systems engineer and scientist Howard T. Odum named the storage symbol of his General Systems Language as the Bertalanffy module (see image right).Nicholas D. Rizzo William Gray (Editor), Nicholas D. Rizzo (Editor), (1973) Unity Through Diversity. A Festschrift for Ludwig von Bertalanffy. Gordon & Breach Science Pub = General system theory = The biologist is widely recognized for his contributions to science as a systems theorist; specifically, for the development of a theory known as general system theory (GST). The theory attempted to provide alternatives to conventional models of organization. GST defined new foundations and developments as a generalized theory of systems with applications to numerous areas of study, emphasizing holism over reductionism, organism over mechanism. Foundational to GST are the inter- relationships between elements which all together form the whole. = Open systems = Bertalanffy's contribution to systems theory is best known for his theory of open systems. The system theorist argued that traditional closed system models based on classical science and the second law of thermodynamics were inadequate for explaining large classes of phenomena. Bertalanffy maintained that \\"the conventional formulation of physics are, in principle, inapplicable to the living organism being open system having steady state. We may well suspect that many characteristics of living systems which are paradoxical in view of the laws of physics are a consequence of this fact.\\"Bertalanffy, L. von, (1969). General System Theory. New York: George Braziller, pp. 39-40 However, while closed physical systems were questioned, questions equally remained over whether or not open physical systems could justifiably lead to a definitive science for the application of an open systems view to a general theory of systems. In Bertalanffy's model, the theorist defined general principles of open systems and the limitations of conventional models. He ascribed applications to biology, information theory and cybernetics. Concerning biology, examples from the open systems view suggested they \\"may suffice to indicate briefly the large fields of application\\" that could be the \\"outlines of a wider generalization;\\"Bertalanffy, L. von, (1969). General System Theory. New York: George Braziller, pp. 139-1540 from which, a hypothesis for cybernetics. Although potential applications exist in other areas, the theorist developed only the implications for biology and cybernetics. Bertalanffy also noted unsolved problems, which included continued questions over thermodynamics, thus the unsubstantiated claim that there are physical laws to support generalizations (particularly for information theory), and the need for further research into the problems and potential with the applications of the open system view from physics. = Systems in the social sciences = In the social sciences, Bertalanffy did believe that general systems concepts were applicable, e.g. theories that had been introduced into the field of sociology from a modern systems approach that included \\"the concept of general system, of feedback, information, communication, etc.\\"Bertalanffy, L. von, (1969). General System Theory. New York: George Braziller, pp. 196 The theorist critiqued classical \\"atomistic\\" conceptions of social systems and ideation \\"such as 'social physics' as was often attempted in a reductionist spirit.\\"Bertalanffy, L. von, (1969). General System Theory. New York: George Braziller, pp. 194-197 Bertalanffy also recognized difficulties with the application of a new general theory to social science due to the complexity of the intersections between natural sciences and human social systems. However, the theory still encouraged new developments in many fields, from sociology to anthropology, economics, political science, and psychology among other areas. Today, Bertalanffy's GST remains a bridge for interdisciplinary study of systems in the social sciences.  Publications  * 1928, Kritische Theorie der Formbildung, Borntraeger.

A committed communist, his uncompromising political beliefs were often reflected in his music. He composed prolifically across a range of genres, but struggled through his lifetime for recognition from the British musical establishment, which largely ignored his works. Bush, from a prosperous middle-class background, enjoyed considerable success as a student at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) in the early 1920s, and spent much of that decade furthering his compositional and piano-playing skills under distinguished tutors. A two-year period in Berlin in 1929 to 1931, early in the Nazi Party's rise to power, cemented Bush's political convictions and moved him from the mainstream Labour Party to the Communist Party of Great Britain which he joined in 1935. He wrote several large-scale works in the 1930s, and was heavily involved with workers' choirs for whom he composed pageants, choruses and songs. His pro-Soviet stance led to a temporary ban on his music by the BBC in the early years of the Second World War, and his refusal to modify his position in the postwar Cold War era led to a more prolonged semi-ostracism of his music. As a result, the four major operas he wrote between 1950 and 1970 were all premiered in East Germany. In his prewar works, Bush's style retained what commentators have described as an essential Englishness, but was also influenced by the avant- garde European idioms of the inter-war years. During and after the war he began to simplify this style, in line with his Marxism-inspired belief that music should be accessible to the mass of the people. Despite the difficulties he encountered in getting his works performed in the West he continued to compose until well into his eighties. He taught composition at the RAM for more than 50 years, published two books, was the founder and long-time president of the Workers' Music Association, and served as chairman and later vice-president of the Composers' Guild of Great Britain. His contribution to musical life was slowly recognised, in the form of doctorates from two universities and numerous tribute concerts towards the end of his life. Since his death aged 94 in 1995, his musical legacy has been nurtured by the Alan Bush Music Trust, established in 1997. Life and career =Family background and early life= Bush was born in Dulwich, South London, on 22 December 1900, the third and youngest son of Alfred Walter Bush and Alice Maud, n√©e Brinsley. The Bushes were a prosperous middle-class family, their wealth deriving from the firm of industrial chemists founded by the composer's great-grandfather, W. J. Bush. As a child Alan's health was delicate, and he was initially educated at home. When he was eleven he began at Highgate School as a day pupil, and remained there until 1918. Both of his elder brothers served as officers in the First World War; one of them, Alfred junior, was killed on the Western Front in 1917. The end of the war in November 1918 meant that Alan narrowly avoided being called up for military service; meantime, having determined on a musical career, he had applied to and been accepted by the RAM, where he began his studies in the spring of 1918. =Royal Academy and after= The Royal Academy of Music At the RAM, Bush studied composition under Frederick Corder and piano with Tobias Matthay. He made rapid progress, and won various scholarships and awards, including the Thalberg Scholarship, the Phillimore piano prize, and a Carnegie award for composition. He produced the first compositions of his formal canon: Three Pieces for Two Pianos, Op. 1, and Piano Sonata in B minor, Op. 2,Craggs, pp. 28‚Äì29 and also made his first attempt to write opera ‚Äì a scene from Bulwer Lytton's novel The Last Days of Pompeii, with a libretto by his brother Brinsley. The work, with Bush at the piano, received a single private performance with family members and friends forming the cast. The manuscript was later destroyed by Bush.Craggs, p. 30 Among Bush's fellow students was Michael Head. The two became friends, as a result of which Bush met Head's 14-year-old sister Nancy. In 1931, ten years after their first meeting, Bush and Nancy would marry and begin a lifelong artistic partnership in which she became Bush's principal librettist, as well as providing the texts for many of his other vocal works. John Ireland, Bush's early mentor and enduring friend In 1922 Bush graduated from the RAM, but continued to study composition privately under John Ireland, with whom he formed an enduring friendship.Ireland, pp. 15‚Äì16 In 1925 Bush was appointed to a teaching post at the RAM, as a professor of harmony and composition, under terms that gave him scope to continue with his studies and to travel. He began to study piano under Benno Moiseiwitsch, from whom he learned the Leschetizky method.Craggs, p. vii In 1926 he made his first of numerous visits to Berlin, where with the violinist Florence Lockwood he gave two concerts of contemporary, mainly British, music which included his own Phantasy in C minor, Op. 3. The skill of the performers was admired by the critics more than the quality of the music. In 1928 Bush returned to Berlin, to perform with the Brosa Quartet at the Bechstein Hall, in a concert of his own music which included the premieres of the chamber work Five Pieces, Op. 6 and the piano solo Relinquishment, Op. 11. Critical opinion was broadly favourable, the Berliner Zeitung am Mittag correspondent noting \\"nothing extravagant but much of promise\\".N. Bush, pp. 19‚Äì20 Among the works composed by Bush during this period were the Quartet for piano, violin, viola and cello, Op. 5; Prelude and Fugue for piano, Op. 9; settings of poems by Walter de la Mare, Harold Monro and W. B. Yeats; and his first venture into orchestral music, the Symphonic Impressions of 1926‚Äì27, Op. 8.Craggs, pp. 32‚Äì35 In early 1929 he completed one of his best-known early chamber works, the string quartet Dialectic, Op. 15, which helped to establish Bush's reputation abroad when it was performed at a Prague festival in the 1930s. =Music and politics= Bush had begun to develop an interest in politics during the war years. In 1924, rejecting his parents' conservatism, he joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP). The following year he joined the London Labour Choral Union (LLCU), a group of largely London-based choirs that had been organised by the socialist composer Rutland Boughton, with Labour Party support, to \\"develop the musical instincts of the people and to render service to the Labour movement\\".Hall, p. 64 Bush was soon appointed as Boughton's assistant, and two years later, he succeeded Boughton as the LLCU's chief musical adviser, remaining in this post until the body disbanded in 1940. Through his LLCU work, Bush met Michael Tippett, five years his junior, who shared Bush's left-wing political perspective. In his memoirs Tippett records his first impressions of Bush: \\"I learned much from him. His music at the time seemed so adventurous and vigorous\\".Tippett 1991, pp. 43‚Äì44 Tippett's biographer Ian Kemp writes: \\"Apart from Sibelius, the contemporary composer who taught Tippett as much as anyone else was his own contemporary Alan Bush\\".Kemp, p. 72 The Friedrich-Wilhelm University, Berlin, as it was in the 1930s After his 1928 concert tour in Berlin, Bush returned to the city to study piano under Artur Schnabel.Bullivant, p. 1 He left the ILP in 1929, and joined the Labour Party proper,Craggs, p. viii before taking extended leave from the RAM to begin a two-year course in philosophy and musicology at Berlin's Friedrich-Wilhelm University. Here, his tutors included Max Dessoir and Friedrich Blume. Bush's years in Berlin profoundly affected his political beliefs, and had direct influence on the subsequent character of his music. Michael Jones, writing in British Music after Bush's death, records Bush's concern at the rise of fascism and antisemitism in Germany. His association with like-minded musicians such as Hanns Eisler and Ernst Hermann Meyer, and writers such as Bertold Brecht, helped to develop his growing political awareness into a lifelong commitment to Marxism and communism. Article reproduced in edited form by the Alan Mush Music Trust Bush's conversion to full-blown communism was not immediate, but in 1935 he finally abandoned Labour and joined the British Communist Party. Notwithstanding the uncompromising nature of his politics, Bush in his writings tended to express his views in restrained terms, \\"much more like a reforming patrician Whig than a proletarian revolutionary\\" according to Michael Oliver in a 1995 Gramophone article. Bush's Grove Music Online biographers also observe that in the politicisation of his music, his folk idioms have more in common with the English traditions of Ralph Vaughan Williams than with the continental radicalism of Kurt Weill. =1930s: emergent composer= In March 1931 Bush and Nancy were married in London, before returning to Germany where Bush continued his studies. In April a BBC broadcast performance of his Dance Overture for Military Band, Op. 12a, received a mixed reception. Nancy Bush quotes two listeners' comments that appeared in the Radio Times on 8 May 1931. One thought that \\"such a medley of fearful discords could never be called music\\",N. Bush, p. 37 while another opined that \\"[we] should not cry for more Mozart, Haydn or Beethoven if modern composers would all give us sheer beauty like this\\".N. Bush, p. 38 The Crystal Palace at Sydenham, venue for the 1934 Pageant for Labour At the end of summer 1931 the couple returned permanently to England, and settled in the village of Radlett, in Hertfordshire. In the following years three daughters were born. Bush resumed his RAM and LLCU duties, and in 1932 accepted a new appointment, as an examiner for the Associated Board of London's Royal Schools of Music, a post which involved extensive overseas travel. These new domestic and professional responsibilities limited Bush's composing activity, but he provided the music for the 1934 Pageant of Labour, organised for the London Trades Council and held at the Crystal Palace during October. Tippett, who co-conducted the event, later described it as a \\"high water mark\\" in Bush's drive to provide workers' choirs with settings for left-wing texts.Tippett 1981, p. 9 In 1936 Bush was one of the founders of the Workers' Musical Association (WMA), and became its first chairman.Kemp, pp. 33‚Äì34 In 1935 Bush began work on a piano concerto which, completed in 1937, included the unusual feature of a mixed chorus and baritone soloist in the finale, singing a radical text by Randall Swingler. Bush played the piano part when the work was premiered by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Sir Adrian Boult on 4 March 1938. The largely left- wing audience responded to the work enthusiastically;Hall, p. 133 Tippett observed that \\"to counter the radical tendencies of the finale ... Boult forced the applause to end by unexpectedly performing the National Anthem\\". A performance of the concerto a year later, at the 1939 \\"Festival of Music for the People\\", drew caustic comments from Neville Cardus in The Manchester Guardian. Cardus saw little direction and no humour in the music: \\"Why don't these people laugh at themselves now and then? Just for fun.\\" Bush provided much of the music, and also acted as general director, for the London Co- operative Societies' pageant \\"Towards Tomorrow\\", held at Wembley Stadium on 2 July 1938. In the autumn of that year he visited both the Soviet Union and the United States.Craggs, p. 18 Back home in early 1939 he was closely involved in founding and conducting the London String Orchestra, which operated successfully until 1941 and again in the immediate postwar years.Craggs, p. 17 He also began to write a major orchestral work, his Symphony No. 1 in C. Amid this busy life Bush was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music. =Second World War= When war broke out in September 1939, Bush registered for military service under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act of 1939. He was not called up immediately, and continued his musical life, helping to form the WMA Singers to replace the now-defunct LLCU, and founding the William Morris Music Society. In April 1940 he conducted a Queen's Hall concert of music by Soviet composers which included the British premieres of Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony, and Khatchaturian's Piano Concerto. William Glock in The Observer was disdainful, dismissing the Khatachurian concerto as \\"sixth-rate\\", and criticising the inordinate length, as he saw it, of the symphony. Ralph Vaughan Williams, who led the opposition to the BBC ban on Bush's music in 1941 Bush was among many musicians, artists and writers who in January 1941 signed up to the communist-led People's Convention, which promoted a six-point radical anti-war programme that included friendship with the Soviet Union and \\"a people's peace\\".Gardiner, p. 297 The BBC advised him that because of his association with this movement, he and his music would no longer be broadcast. This action drew strong protests from, among others, E. M. Forster and Ralph Vaughan Williams.Lucas, p. 160 The ban was opposed by the prime minister, Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons, and proved short- lived; it was annulled following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941.Craggs, p. ix In November 1941 Bush was conscripted into the army, and after initial training was assigned to the Royal Army Medical Corps. Based in London, he was given leave to perform in concerts, which enabled him to conduct the premiere of his First Symphony at a BBC Promenade Concert in the Royal Albert Hall on 24 July 1942.Foreman, p. 154 He also performed regularly with the London String Orchestra, and in 1944 was the piano soloist in the British premiere of Shostakovich's Piano Quintet. His wartime compositions were few; among them were the \\"Festal Day\\" Overture, Op. 23, written for Vaughan Williams's 70th birthday in 1942, and several songs and choruses including \\"Freedom on the March\\", written for a British-Soviet Unity Demonstration at the Albert Hall on 27 June 1943.Craggs, p. 19 Bush's relatively calm war was marred by the death, in 1944, of his seven-year-old daughter Alice in a road accident. As the war in Europe drew to its end, Bush was posted to the Far East despite being well over the normal age limit for overseas service. The matter was raised in Parliament by the Independent Labour member D. N. Pritt, who enquired whether political factors were behind the decision. The posting was withdrawn; and Bush remained in London until his discharge in December 1945. =Post-war: struggle for recognition and performance=  Persona non grata  A memorial service in 1947 at the site of the destroyed Czech village of Lidice Bush's return to composing after the war led to what Richard Stoker, in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, calls \\"his best period\\". However, Bush's attempts to secure a place in the concert repertoire were frustrated. A contributory factor may have been what the critic Dominic Daula calls Bush's \\"intriguingly unique compositional voice\\" that challenged critics and audiences alike. But the composer's refusal to modify his pro-Soviet stance following the onset of the Cold War alienated both the public and the music establishment, a factor which Bush acknowledged 20 years later: \\"People who were in a position to promote my works were afraid to do so. They were afraid of being labelled\\". Stoker comments that \\"in a less tolerant country he would certainly have been imprisoned, or worse. But he was merely ignored, both politically, and, which is a pity, as a composer\\". Nancy Bush writes that the BBC considered him persona non grata, and imposed an almost complete though unofficial broadcast ban that lasted for some 15 years after the war. As well as resuming his teaching routines, Bush embarked on a busy schedule of travel, mainly in Eastern Europe with the WMA choir. While in Czechoslovakia in August 1947, he and the WMA performed his unaccompanied chorus Lidice at the site of the village of that name,Craggs, p. 68Tribute to Alan Bush on his Fiftieth Birthday, p. 7 (image) which had been destroyed by the Nazis in 1942 in a reprisal for the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich.Kershaw, p. 391 Among Bush's earliest postwar works was the English Suite, performed by the revived London String Orchestra at the Wigmore Hall on 9 February 1946.Foreman, p. 155 The orchestra had suspended its operations in 1941; after the war, Bush's failure to secure funding for it led to its closure, despite considerable artistic success.Foreman, p. 116 Critics noted in the work a change of idiom, away from the European avant-garde character of much of his prewar music and towards a simpler popular style. This change was acknowledged by Bush as he responded to the 1948 decree issued by Stalin's director of cultural policy, Andrei Zhdanov, against formalism and dissonance in modern music ‚Äì although the process of simplification had probably begun during the war years. In 1948 Bush accepted a commission from the Nottingham Co-operative Society to write a symphony as part of the city's quincentennial celebrations in 1949. > According to Foreman, \\"by any standards this is one of Bush's most approachable scores\\",Foreman, p. 119 yet since its Nottingham premiere on 27 June 1949 and its London debut on 11 December 1952 under Boult and the London Philharmonic, the work has been rarely heard in Britain. His Violin Concerto, Op. 32, received its premiere on 25 August 1949, with Max Rostal as soloist. In this work Bush explained that \\"the soloist represents the individual, the orchestra world society, and the work [represents] the individual's struggles and of his final absorption into society\\". The Daily Telegraphs critic observed that \\"it was the orchestra, i.e. society, that after a strenuous opening gave up the struggle\\".F. Bonavia, The Daily Telegraph, 26 August 1949, quoted in Foreman, p. 118 In 1947 Bush became chairman of the Composers' Guild of Great Britain for 1947‚Äì48. He also produced a full-length textbook, Strict Counterpoint in the Palestrina Style (Joseph Williams, London, 1948). On 15 December 1950 the WMA marked Bush's 50th birthday with a special concert of his music at the Conway Hall.Craggs, p. 20 Opera ventures The death of Wat Tyler: a 14th-century depiction Since his youthful Last Days of Pompeii, Bush had not attempted to write opera, but he took up the genre in 1946 with a short operetta for children, The Press Gang (or the Escap'd Apprentice), for which Nancy supplied the libretto. This was performed by pupils at St Christopher School, Letchworth, on 7 March 1947. The following year he began a more ambitious venture, a full- length grand opera recounting the story of Wat Tyler, who led the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Wat Tyler, again to Nancy's libretto, was submitted in 1950 to the Arts Council's Festival of Britain opera competition, and was one of four prizewinners ‚Äì Bush received ¬£400.N. Bush, pp. 61‚Äì62 The opera was not taken up by any of the British opera houses, and was first staged at Leipzig Opera in 1953. It was well received, retained for the season and ran again in the following year; there was a further performance in Rostock in 1955. Wat Tyler did not receive its full British premiere until 19 June 1974, when it was produced at Sadler's Wells; as of 2017, this remains the only professional staging of a Bush opera in Britain. Bush's second opera, Men of Blackmoor, composed in 1954‚Äì55 to Nancy's libretto, is a story of Northumbrian miners in the early 19th century; Bush went down a mine as part of his research. It received its premiere at the German National Theatre, Weimar on 18 November 1956. Like Wat Tyler in Leipzig, the opera was successful; after the Weimar season there were further East German productions in Jena (1957), Leipzig (1959) and Zwickau (1960). In Britain there were student performances at Oxford in 1960, and Bristol in 1974. In December 1960 David Drew in the New Statesman wrote: \\"The chief virtue of Men of Blackmoor, and the reason why it particularly deserves a [professional] performance at this historical point, is its unfailing honesty ... it is never cheap, and at its best achieves a genuine dignity.\\" For his third opera, Bush chose a contemporary theme ‚Äì the struggle against colonial rule. He intended to collect appropriate musical material from British Guiana, but an attempt to visit the colony in 1957 was thwarted when its government refused him entry.Craggs, p. 21 The ban was rescinded the following year, and in 1959 Bush was able to gather and record a great deal of authentic music from the local African and Indian populations. The eventual result was The Sugar Reapers, premiered at Leipzig on 11 December 1966. The Times correspondent, praising the performance, wrote: \\"One can only hope that London will soon see a production of its own\\". With Nancy, Bush wrote two more operettas for children: The Spell Unbound (1953) and The Ferryman's Daughter (1961). His final opera, written in 1965‚Äì67, was Joe Hill, based on the life story of Joe Hill, an American union activist and songwriter who was controversially convicted of murder and executed in 1915. The opera, to a libretto by Barrie Stavis, was premiered at the German State Opera, Berlin, on 29 September 1970, and in 1979 was broadcast by the BBC. =1953‚Äì1975= Bush in 1952 at the Workers' Conference of Writers and Composers in Berlin During his involvement with opera, Bush continued to compose in other genres. His 1953 cantata Voice of the Prophets, Op. 41, was commissioned by the tenor Peter Pears and sung by Pears at its premiere on 22 May 1953.Foreman, pp. 136, 160‚Äì61 In 1959‚Äì60 he produced two major orchestral works: the Dorian Passacaglia and Fugue, Op. 52,Foreman, p. 156 and the Third Symphony, Op. 53, known as the \\"Byron\\" since it depicts musically scenes from the life of the poet. The symphony, a commission from East German Radio, was first performed at Leipzig on 20 March 1962.Foreman, p. 129 Colin Mason, writing in The Guardian, thought the work had a stronger socialist programme than the Nottingman symphony of 1949. The ending of the second movement, a long tune representing Byron's speech against the extension of the death penalty was, Mason wrote, \\"a splendid piece\\". The symphony was awarded that year's H√§ndel Prize in the city of Halle.Craggs, p. 22 At the end of the 1960s Bush wrote, among other works, Time Remembered, Op. 67, for chamber orchestra, and Scherzo for Wind Orchestra and Percussion, Op. 68, based on an original Guyanese theme.Foreman, pp. 141, 156 In 1969 he produced the first of three song cycles, The Freight of Harvest, Op. 69 ‚Äì Life's Span and Woman's Life would follow in 1974 and 1977.Foreman, p. 161 In the 1970s, while maintaining his teaching commitment to the RAM, he continued to perform in the concert hall as conductor and pianist. Bush was slowly being recognised for his achievements, even by those who had long cold-shouldered him. In 1968 he was awarded a Doctor of Music degree by the University of London, and two years later received an honorary doctorate from the University of Durham. On 6 December 1970, just before Bush's 70th birthday, BBC Television broadcast a programme about his life and works, and on 16 February 1971 the RAM hosted a special (late) birthday concert, in which he and Pears performed songs from Voices of the Prophets. Bush featured in a further television programme, broadcast on 25 October 1975, in a series entitled \\"Born in 1900\\".Craggs, p. 23 =Final years= Cave paintings at Lascaux which inspired the Fourth Symphony In old age, Bush continued to lead an active and productive life, punctuated by periodic commemorations of his life and works. In November 1975 his 50 years' professorship at the RAM was marked in a concert there, and in January 1976 the WMA gave a concert to honour his recent 75th birthday. In 1977 he produced his last major piano work, the Twenty-four Preludes, Op. 84, of which he gave the first performance at the Wigmore Hall on 30 October 1977.Foreman, p. 159 A later reviewer described this piece as \\"music I'd like to have playing beside me as I sprawled on the grass beneath the trees with an ice-cream, watching a county cricket match on a golden afternoon\\". In 1978 Bush retired from the RAM after 52 years' service.N. Bush, p. 90 His 80th birthday in December 1980 was celebrated at concerts in London, Birmingham and East Germany, Craggs, p. 24 and the BBC broadcast a special birthday musical tribute. In the same year he published In My Eighth Decade and Other Essays, in which he stated his personal creed that \\"as a musician and as a man, Marxism is a guide to action\\", enabling him to express through music the \\"struggle to create a condition of social organisation in which science and art will be the possession of all\\".A. Bush, p. 20 In 1982 Bush visited the Lascaux caves in south-western France, and was inspired by the prehistoric cave paintings to write his fourth and final symphony, Op. 94, subtitled the \\"Lascaux\\".Foreman, pp. 133‚Äì34 This, his last major orchestral work, was premiered by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, under Edward Downes in Manchester, on 25 March 1986.Foreman, p. 157 In the late 1980s Bush was increasingly hampered by failing eyesight. His last formal compositions appeared in 1988: \\"Spring Woodland and Summer Garden\\" for solo piano, Op. 124, and Summer Valley for cello and piano, Op. 125,Foreman, pp. 152, 160 although he continued to compose privately and play the piano. Nancy's health meanwhile deteriorated, and she died on 12 October 1991. Bush lived on quietly at Radlett for another four years, able to recall the events of his youth but with no memory of the last fifty years and unaware of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. He died in Watford General hospital on 31 October 1995, after a short illness, at the age of 94. Music =General character= Despite undergoing various changes of emphasis, Bush's music retained a voice distinct from that of any of his contemporaries. One critic describes the typical Bush sound as \\"Mild dominant discords, of consonant effect, used with great originality in uncommon progressions alive with swift, purposeful harmonic movement ... except in [Benjamin] Britten they are nowhere used with more telling expression, colour and sense of movement than in Bush\\". John Ireland, Bush's early mentor, instilled \\"the sophisticated and restrained craftsmanship which marked Bush's music from the beginning\\", introducing him to folksong and Palestrina, both important building blocks in the development of Bush's mature style.Foreman, p. 100 Daula comments that \\"Bush's music does not [merely] imitate the sound-world of his Renaissance predecessors\\", but creates his unique fingerprint by \\"[juxtaposing] 16th century modal counterpoint with late- and post-romantic harmony\\". Bush's music, at least from the mid-1930s, often carried political overtones. His obituarist Rupert Christiansen writes that, as a principled Marxist, Bush \\"put the requirements of the revolutionary proletariat at the head of the composer's responsibilities\\", a choice which others, such as Tippett, chose not to make.Kemp, p. 27 However, Vaughan Williams thought that, despite Bush's oft- declared theories of the purposes of art and music, \\"when the inspiration comes over him he forgets all about this and remembers only the one eternal rule for all artists, 'To thine own self be true'.\\"Hall, p. 132 =To 1945= According to Duncan Hall's account of the music culture of the Labour Movement in the inter-war years, Bush's youthful music, composed before his Berlin sojourn, already demonstrated its essential character. His Dialectic for String Quartet (1929), Op. 15, created a strong impression when first heard in 1935, as \\"a musical discourse of driving intensity and virile incident\\".Foreman, p. 103 Christiansen highlights its \\"tightness and austerity\\" in contrast to the more fashionable lyricism then prevalent in English music. Bush's years in Berlin brought into his music the advanced Central European idioms that characterise his major orchestral compositions of the period: the Piano Concerto (1935‚Äì37), and the First Symphony (1939‚Äì40). Nancy Bush describes the Piano Concerto as Bush's first attempt to fuse his musical and political ideas. The symphony was even more overtly political, representing in its three movements greed (of the bourgeoisie), frustration (of the proletariat) and the final liberation of the latter,Foreman, p. 112, quoting from the concert's programme notes but not, according to Christiansen, \\"in an idiom calculated to appeal to the masses\\". Aside from these large-scale works, much of Bush's compositional activity in the 1930s was devoted to pageants, songs and choruses written for his choirs, work undertaken with the utmost seriousness. In his introduction to a 1938 socialist song book, Bush wrote that \\"socialists must sing what we mean and sing it like we mean it\\".Hall, p. 134 Under Bush's influence the \\"music of the workers\\" moved from the high aesthetic represented by, for example, Arthur Bourchier's mid-1920s pamphlet Art and Culture in Relation to Socialism, towards an expression with broader popular appeal. =Postwar and beyond= Although Bush accepted Zhdanov's 1948 diktat without demur and acted accordingly, his postwar simplifications had begun earlier and would continue as part of a gradual process. Bush first outlined the basis of his new method of composition in an article, \\"The Crisis of Modern Music\\", which appeared in WMA's Keynote magazine in spring 1946. The method, in which every note has thematic significance, has drawn comparison by critics with Schoenberg's twelve-note system, although Bush rejected this equation. Many of Bush's best-known works were written in the immediate postwar years. Anthony Payne described the Three Concert Studies for Piano Trio (Op. 31) of 1947 as exceeding Britten in its inventiveness, \\"a high-water mark in Bush's mature art\\". The Violin Concerto (Op. 32, 1948) has been cited as \\"a work as beautiful and refined as any in the genre since Walton's\\". Foreman considers the concerto, which uses twelve- tone themes, to be the epitome of Bush's thematic theory of composition, although Bush's contemporary, Edmund Rubbra, thought it too intellectual for general audiences.Foreman, pp. 118‚Äì19 The Dorian Passacaglia and Fugue for timpani, percussion and strings, (Op. 52, 1959), involves eight variations in the Dorian mode, followed by eight in other modes culminating in a final quadruple fugue in six parts.Foreman, p. 141 Musical Opinions critic praised the composer's \\"wonderful control and splendid craftsmanship\\" in this piece, and predicted that it could become the most popular of all Bush's orchestral works. (Review quoted in ABMT website) The postwar period also saw the beginning of Bush's 20-year involvement with grand opera, a genre in which, although he achieved little commercial recognition, he was retrospectively hailed by critics as a master of British opera second only to Britten. His first venture, Wat Tyler, was written in a form which Bush thought acceptable to the general British public;Foreman, pp. 122‚Äì23 it was not his choice, he wrote, that the opera and its successors all found their initial audiences in East Germany.A. Bush, p. 21 When eventually staged in Britain in 1974 the opera, although well received at Sadler's Wells, seemed somewhat old- fashioned; Philip Hope-Wallace in The Guardian thought the ending degenerated into \\"a choral union cantata\\", and found the music pleasant but not especially memorable. Bush's three other major operas were all characterised by their use of \\"local\\" music: Northumbrian folk-song in the case of Men of Blackmoor, Guyanese songs and dances in The Sugar Reapers, and American folk music in Joe Hill ‚Äì the last-named used in a manner reminiscent of Kurt Weill and the German opera with which Bush had become familiar in the early 1930s.Foreman, p. 128 The extent to which Bush's music changed substantially after the war was addressed by Meirion Bowen, reviewing a Bush concert in the 1980s. Bowen noted a distinct contrast between early and late works, the former showing primarily the influences of Ireland and of Bush's European contacts, while in the later pieces the idiom was \\"often overtly folklike and Vaughan Williams- ish\\". In general Bush's late works continued to show all the hallmarks of his postwar oeuvre: vigour, clarity of tone and masterful use of counterpoint. The Lascaux symphony, written when he was 83, is the composer's final major orchestral statement, and addresses deep philosophical issues relating to the origins and destiny of mankind. =Assessment= In the 1920s it appeared that Bush might emerge as Britain's foremost pianist, after his studies under the leading teachers of the day, but he turned to composition as his principal musical activity. In Foreman's summary he is \\"a major figure who really straddles the century as almost no other composer does\\". He remained a pianist of consequence, with a strong and reliable, if heavy, touch.Foreman, pp. 98‚Äì99 Joanna Bullivant, writing in Music and Letters, maintains that in his music Bush subordinated all ideas of personal expression to the ideology of Marxism. The critic Hugo Cole thought that, as a composer, Bush came close to Paul Hindemith's ideal: \\"one for whom music is felt as a moral and social force, and only incidentally as a means of personal expression\\". The composer Wilfrid Mellers credits Bush with more than ideological correctness; while remaining faithful to his creed even when it was entirely out of fashion, he \\"attempt[ed] to re-establish an English tradition meaningful to his country's past, present and future\\". Originally published in the Trust's Clarion magazine, August 1998. Hall describes Bush as \\"a key figure in the democratisation of art in Britain, achieving far more in this regard than his pedagogic, utopian patrons and peers, the labour romantics.\\" The music critic Colin Mason described Bush's music thus: > His range is wide, the quality of his music consistently excellent. He has > the intellectual concentration of Tippett, the easy command and > expansiveness of Walton, the nervous intensity of Rawsthorne, the serene > leisureliness of Rubbra ... He is surpassed only in melody, as are the > others, by Walton, but not even by him in harmonic richness, nor by Tippett > in contrapuntal originality and the expressive power of rather austere > musical thought, nor by Rawsthorne in concise, compelling utterance and > telling invention, nor by Rubbra in handling large forms well. Quoted from a > programme note for the Alan Bush and Aaron Copland Centenary Focus Concert, > Purcell Room, 3 April 2000 Legacy Bush's long career as a teacher influenced generations of English composers and performers. Tippett was never a formal pupil, but has acknowledged a deep debt to Bush. Herbert Murrill, a pupil of Bush's at the RAM in the 1920s, wrote in 1950 of his tutor: \\"[T]here is humility in his makeup, and I believe that no man can achieve greatness in the arts without humility ... To Alan Bush I owe much, not least the artistic strength and right to differ from him\\".Murrill, p. 19 Among postwar Bush students who later led distinguished careers are the composers Edward Gregson, Roger Steptoe, E. Florence Whitlock, and Michael Nyman, and the pianists John Bingham and Graham Johnson. Through his sponsorship of the London String Quartet Bush helped launch the careers of string players such as Norbert Brainin and Emanuel Hurwitz, both of whom later achieved international recognition. Bush's music was under-represented in the concert repertoire in his lifetime, and virtually disappeared after his death. The 2000 centenary of his birth was markedly low key; the Prom season ignored him, although there was a memorial concert at the Wigmore Hall on 1 November, and a BBC broadcast of the Piano Concerto on 19 December. The centenary, albeit quietly observed, helped to introduce the name and music of Bush to a new generation of music lovers, and generated an increase in both performance and recordings. The centenary also heralded an awakening of scholarly interest in Bush, whose life and works were the subject of numerous PhD theses in the early 20th century.Bullivant, p. 4 Scholars such as Paul Harper-Scott and Joanna Bullivant have obtained access to new material, including documents released since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and Bush's MI5 file. This, says Bullivant, enables a more informed assessment of the interrelationships within Bush's music and his communism, and of the inherent conflicting priorities.Bullivant, pp. 4 and 13 In October 1997 family members and friends founded The Alan Bush Music Trust \\"to promote the education and appreciation by the public in and of music and, in particular, the works of the British composer Alan Bush\\".Craggs, p. 25 The trust provides a newsletter, features news stories, promotes performances and recordings of Bush's works, and through its website reproduces wide-ranging critical and biographical material. It continues to monitor concert performances of Bush's works, and other Bush-related events, at home and abroad. At the time of Bush's centenary, Martin Anderson, writing in the British Music Information Centre's newsletter, summarised Bush's compositional career: > Bush was not a natural melodist √† la Dvor√°k, though he could produce an > appealing tune when he set his mind to it. But he was a first-rate > contrapuntist, and his harmonic world can glow with a rare internal warmth. > It would be foolish to claim that everything he wrote was a masterpiece ‚Äì > and equally idiotic to turn our backs on the many outstanding scores still > awaiting assiduous attention. Quoted from an original article published in > 2001 by the British Music Information Centre. Recordings Before Bush's centenary year, 2000, the few available recordings of his music included none of the major works. In the 21st century much has been added, including recordings of Symphonies 1, 2 and 4, the Piano and Violin Concertos, many of the main vocal works and the complete organ works.

Studying canon law in the University of Coimbra intermittently between 1600 and 1608, he began to read the Bible and contemplate it seriously. Costa also occupied an ecclesiastical office. In his autobiography Costa pictured his family as devout Catholics. However they had been subjects to several investigations by the Inquisition, suggesting they were Conversos, more or less close to Jewish customs. Gabriel explicitly supported the adherence to Mosaic prescriptions as well as traditional ones. After his father died, the family came into greater financial difficulties due to some debts that had not been paid. In 1614 they changed this predicament as they sneaked out of Portugal with a significant sum of money they previously collected as tax-farmers for Jorge de Mascarenhas. The family took Jewish names, and headed to two major Sephardic diaspora communities. Newly circumcised, two brothers settled in Amsterdam, and two with their mother in Hamburg. Gabriel was in the latter city, and became Uriel for the Jewish neighbors, and Adam Romez for outside relations, presumably because he was wanted in Portugal. All resumed their international trade business.Salomon & Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 6-8]. Upon arriving there, Costa quickly became disenchanted with the kind of Judaism he saw in practice. He came to believe that the rabbinic leadership was too consumed by ritualism and legalistic posturing. His earliest known written message is known as Propostas contra a Tradi√ß√£o (Propositions against the Tradition). In eleven short theses he called into question the disparity between certain Jewish customs and a literal reading of the Law of Moses, and more generally tried to prove from reason and scripture that this system of law is sufficient. In 1616 the text was dispatched to the leaders of the prominent Jewish community in Venice. The Venetians ruled against it and prompted the Hamburg community to sanction Costa with a herem, or excommunication. The Objections are extant only as quotes and paraphrases in Magen ·πøe-tsinah (◊û◊í◊ü ◊ï◊¶◊†◊î; \\"Shield and Buckler\\"), a longer rebuttal by Leon of Modena, of the Venice community,Salomon & Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 9-12]. who responded to religious queries about Costa sent by the Hamburg Jewish authorities.Leone of Modena later published a developed iconoclastic treatise of his own (\\"kol sakhal / shaagat arye\\"), and it is quite possible that da Costa's doubts had some influence on him. Salomon & Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 24-29]. Costa's 1616 attempts resulted in official excommunication in Venice and Hamburg. It is not known what this meant in practice, Costa barely mentions it in his autobiography, and he would continue his international business. In 1623 he moved to Amsterdam for an unknown reason.Previous research concluded he went to Hamburg after a time in Amsterdam, but some official documents show otherwise. The leaders of the Amsterdam Sephardic community were troubled by the arrival of a known heretic,Salomon & Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 12-16]. staged a hearing and approved the excommunication set by the previous authorities. Exemplar Humanae Vitae, by Uriel Acosta. At about the same time (in Hamburg or Amsterdam) Costa was working on a second treatise. Three chapters of the unpublished manuscript were stolen, and formed the target for a traditionalist rebuttal quickly published by Semuel da Silva of Hamburg; so Costa enlarged his book and the printed version already contains responses and revisions to the crux of the tract. In 1623 Costa published the Portuguese book Exame das tradi√ß√µes phariseas (Examination of Pharisaic Traditions).The complete printed book was discovered in 1990 at the Danish Royal Library by H P Salomon; previously only the three chapters had been known. Costa's second work spans more than 200 pages. In the first part it develops his earlier Propositons, taking into account Modena's responses and corrections. In the second part he adds his newer views that the Hebrew Bible, especially the Torah, does not support the idea of immortality of the soul. Costa believed that this was not an idea deeply rooted in biblical Judaism, but rather had been formulated primarily by later Pharisaic rabbis, and promoted to a Jewish principles of faith. The work further pointed out the discrepancies between biblical Judaism and Rabbinic Judaism; he declared the latter to be an accumulation of mechanical ceremonies and practices. In his view, it was thoroughly devoid of spiritual and philosophical concepts. Costa was relatively early in teaching to Jewish readership in favor of the mortality of the soul, and in appealing exclusively to direct reading of the bible. He cites neither rabbinic authorities nor philosophers of the Aristotelian and Neoplatonic traditions.Salomon & Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 47]. The book became very controversial among the local Jewish community, whose leaders reported to the city authorities this was an attack on Christianity as well as on Judaism, and it was burned publicly. He was fined a significant sum. In 1627 Costa was a denizen of Utrecht. The Amsterdam community still had an uncomfortable relationship with him; they queried a Venetian rabbi, Yaakov Ha-Levi, whether his elderly mother is eligible for a burial lot in their city; the next year the mother died and Uriel went back to Amsterdam. Ultimately, the loneliness was too much for him to handle,Salomon & Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 18-24]. Around 1633 he accepted the terms of reconciliation, which he does not detail in his autobiography, and was reaccepted into the community. Shortly after that Costa was tried again; he encountered two Christians who expressed to him their desire to convert to Judaism. In accordance with his views, he dissuaded them from doing so. Based on this and earlier accusations regarding kashrut, he was excommunicated. As he describes it, for seven years he lived in virtual isolation, shunned by his family and embroiled in civil-financial disputes with them. In search for legal help, he decided to go back being \\"an ape amongst the apes\\"; he would follow the traditions and practices, but with little real conviction. He sought a way of reconciliation. As a punishment for his heretical views, Costa was publicly given 39 lashes at the Portuguese synagogue in Amsterdam. He was then forced to lie on the floor while the congregation trampled over him. This left him both demoralized and seeking revenge against the man (a cousin or nephew) who brought about his trial, seven years previously.English translation of Da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic TraditionsThe humiliating ceremony makes the final dramatic point of his autobiography. This document is a few pages long, and was transmitted to print in Latin some decades after his death, with the title Exemplar Humanae Vitae (Example of a Human Life). It tells the story of his life and intellectual development, his experience as a victim of intolerance. It also expresses rationalistic and skeptical views: It doubts whether biblical law was divinely sanctioned or whether it was simply written down by Moses. It suggests that all religion was a human invention, and specifically rejects formalized, ritualized religion. It sketches a religion to be based only on natural law, as god has no use for empty ceremony, nor for violence and strife. Two reports agree that Costa committed suicideSalomon & Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 23]. in Amsterdam in 1640: Johannes M√ºller, a Protestant theologian of Hamburg gives the time as April, and Amsterdam Remonstrant preacher Philipp van Limborch adds that he set out to end the lives of both his brother (or nephew) and himself. Seeing his relative approach one day, he grabbed a pistol and pulled the trigger, but it misfired. Then he reached for another, turned it on himself, and fired, dying a reportedly terrible death. Influence Ultimately there have been many ways to view Uriel da Costa. In his lifetime, his book Examinations inspired not only Silva's answer, but also Menasseh ben Israel's more lasting De Resurrectione Mortuorum (1636) directed against the \\"Sadducees\\", and a listing in the Index of Prohibited Books. After his death, his name became synonymous with the Exemplar Humanae Vitae. M√ºller publicized Costa's excommunication, to make an anachronistic point that some Sephardic Jews of his days are Sadducees. Johann Helwig Willemer made the same point, and implied that this extreme heresy leads to suicide. Pierre Bayle reported the contents of the Exemplar quite fully, to demonstrate among other things that questioning religion without turning to revelation would bring one to miserable faithlessness. The later Enlightenment saw Costa's Rational Religion more tolerantly. Herder eulogized him as a crusader of authentic belief. Voltaire noted that he quit Judaism for Philosophy. Reimarus embraced Costa's appeal to have legal status based on the Seven Laws of Noah, when he made an analogous argument that Christian states should be at least as tolerant toward modern Deists as ancient Israelites had been. Internally to Judaism, he has been seen as both a troublemaking heretic or as martyr against the intolerance of the Rabbinic establishment. He has also been seen as a precursor to Baruch Spinoza and to modern biblical criticism. Costa is also indicative of the difficulty that many Marranos faced upon their arrival in an organized Jewish community. As a Crypto-Jew in Iberia, he read the Bible and was impressed by it. Yet upon confronting an organized Rabbinic community, he was not equally impressed by the established ritual and religious doctrine of Rabbinical Judaism, such as the Oral Law. As da Costa himself pointed out, traditional Pharisee and Rabbinic doctrine had been contested in the past by the Sadducees and the present by the Karaites.

Works based upon Costa's life * In 1846, in the midst of the liberal milieu that led to the Revolutions of 1848, the German writer Karl Gutzkow (1811‚Äì1878) wrote Uriel Acosta, a play about Costa's life. This would later become the first classic play to be translated into Yiddish, and it was a longtime standard of Yiddish theater; Uriel Acosta is the signature role of the actor Rafalesco, the protagonist of Sholem Aleichem's Wandering Stars. The first translation into Yiddish was by Osip Mikhailovich Lerner, who staged the play at the Mariinski Theater in Odessa, Ukraine (then part of Imperial Russia) in 1881, shortly after the assassination of Tsar Alexander II. Abraham Goldfaden rapidly followed with a rival production, an operetta, at Odessa's Remesleni Club. Israel Rosenberg promptly followed with his own translation for a production in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ (in modern-day Poland). Rosenberg's production starred Jacob Adler in the title role; the play would remain a signature piece in Adler's repertoire to the end of his stage career, the first of the several roles through which he developed the persona that he referred to as \\"the Grand Jew\\" (see also Adler's Memoir in the References below). * Hermann Jellinek (brother of Adolf Jellinek) wrote a book entitled Uriel Acosta (1848).http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8582-jellinek#anchor6 * Israel Zangwill used the life of Uriel da Costa as one of several fictionalized biographies in his book \\"Dreamers of the Ghetto\\". * Agustina Bessa-Lu√≠s, Portuguese writer (1922- ) published in 1984 the novel \\"Um bicho da terra\\" (An Animal of the Earth) based on Uriel's life.

The term is used almost exclusively in Europe, where in the present day there is no sovereign duchy (i.e. with the status of a nation state) left. The term \\"duke\\" (like the corresponding \\"duchy\\") should not be confused with the title Grand Duke (or Grand Duchy, such as the present-day Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), as there exists a significant difference of rank between the two. In common European cultural heritage, a grand duke is the third highest monarchic rank, after emperor and king. Its synonym in many Slavic and Baltic European languages (Russian, Lithuanian, etc.) is translated as Grand Prince, whereas most Germanic and Romance European languages (English, French, Spanish, Italian etc.) use expressions corresponding to Grand Duke.Meyers Taschenlexikon Geschichte 1982, vol. 2, p. 319. Unlike a duke, the sovereign grand duke is considered royalty (or in German, 'royal nobility', K√∂nigsadel). The proper form of address for a grand duke is His Royal Highness (HRH),Meyers Taschenlexikon Geschichte 1982, vol. 1, p. 21. whereas for a non-royal duke in the United Kingdom it is His Grace. In contrast to this, the rank of a duke differs from one country to the next. In Germany, for example, a duke is listed in the aristocratic hierarchy below an emperor (Kaiser), king (K√∂nig), grand duke (Gro√üherzog), and elector (Kurf√ºrst) ‚Äì in that order ‚Äì whereas in Britain the duke comes third after king/queen and prince (there are no British grand dukes or electors).Meyers Taschenlexikon Geschichte 1982, vol. 3, p. 62. In all countries, there existed an important difference between \\"sovereign dukes\\" and dukes subordinate to a king or emperor. Some historic duchies were sovereign in areas that would become part of nation-states only during the modern era, such as Germany (a federal empire) and Italy (a unified kingdom). In contrast, others were subordinate districts of those kingdoms that had unified either partially or completely during the medieval era, such as France, Spain, Sicily, Naples, and the Papal States. In England, the term is used in respect of non-territorial entities. Examples Traditionally, a grand duchy, such as Luxembourg or Tuscany (1569‚Äì1860), was generally independent and sovereign. There were also many sovereign or semi-sovereign duchies in the de facto confederate Holy Roman Empire (961‚Äì1806) and German- speaking areas. In France, a number of duchies existed in the medieval period including Normandy, Burgundy, Brittany, and Aquitaine. The medieval German stem duchies (, literally \\"tribal duchy\\", the official title of its ruler being Herzog or \\"duke\\") were associated with the Frankish Kingdom and corresponded with the areas of settlement of the major Germanic tribes. They formed the nuclei of the major feudal states that comprised the early era of the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation (961-1806; in German: Heiliges R√∂misches Reich Deutscher Nation). These were Schwaben (Swabia, mainly the present-day German state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg), Bayern (Bavaria), and Sachsen (Saxony) in pre-Carolingian times, to which Franken (Franconia, at present the northern part of the German state of Bavaria) and Lothringen (Lorraine, nowadays mostly part of France) were added in post-Carolingian times. As mentioned above, such a duke was styled Herzog (literally \\"the one who is leading [the troops]\\"). In medieval England, duchies associated with the territories of Lancashire and Cornwall were created, with certain powers and estates of land accruing to their dukes. The Duchy of Lancaster was created in 1351 but became merged with the Crown when, in 1399, Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster, ascended the throne of England as Henry IV. Nowadays the Duchy of Lancaster always belongs to the sovereign and its revenue is the Privy Purse. The Duchy of Cornwall was created in 1337 and held successively by the Dukes of Cornwall, who were also heirs to the throne. Nowadays, the Duchy of Cornwall belongs to the sovereign's heir apparent, if there is one: it reverts to the Crown in the absence of an heir apparent, and is automatically conferred to the heir apparent upon birth. These duchies today have mostly lost any non-ceremonial political role, but generate their holders' private income. During the Wars of the Roses, the Duke of York made a successful entry into the City of York, by merely claiming no harm and that it was his right to possess \\"his duchy of York\\".The Second War of the Roses Any and all feudal duchies that made up the patchwork of England have since been absorbed within the Royal Family. Other than Cornwall and Lancaster, British royal dukedoms are titular and do not include land holdings. Non-royal dukedoms are associated with ducal property, but this is meant as the duke's private property, with no other feudal privileges attached. In more recent times, territorial duchies have become rare; most dukedoms conferred in the last few centuries have been of a purely ceremonial or honorific character (see Duke). At present all independent (i.e., sovereign) duchies have disappeared. Luxembourg, an independent and sovereign nation with a history dating back as far as the 8th century,Paul Margue, Luxemburg in Mittelalter und Neuzeit, publ. Bourg-Bourger, Luxembourg City 1974, p13 is the only remaining independent grand duchy, with the Grand Duke Henri (dynasty of Luxembourg- Nassau) as its head of state since the year 2000. In the Middle East the concept of beylik can be seen as equivalent to duchy (\\"bey\\" being a Turkish title for the head of a house, and similar to \\"duke\\" when that person is the highest representative of the state in a principality). For example, the Ottoman Empire, first just the nomadic Kayƒ± tribe among the Ghuzz (Oghuz Turks), settled in Bithynia on the border to the Byzantine Empire, evolved under the Sultanate of R√ªm (Seljuks in Anatolia) into a border principality (U√ß beyliƒüi /margraviate). It became an independent principality after the Anatolian Seljuk state was shattered by the Mongols. Later it grew further into its own empire by conquering the nearby Anatolian beyliks, also remnants of the Sultanate of R√ªm.

It is traditionally ranked in order of precedence below the title of emperor, king or archduke and above that of sovereign prince or sovereign duke. It is used in some current and former independent monarchies in Europe, particularly: * In the present- day Grand Duchy of Luxembourg * Historically the sovereigns of former independent countries such as: Tuscany (from 1569 to 1860, now part of Italy) * Baden, Hesse, Oldenburg, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Saxe-Weimar ‚Äî grand duchies from 1815 to 1918 all now part of Germany * Formerly also for some nations in Eastern and Northeastern Europe, such as the Grand Duchy of Finland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. * The self-styled monarchs of several micronations. Western and Central European The term \\"grand duke\\" as a monarch reigning over an independent state was a later invention (in Western Europe at first in 1569 for the ruler of Tuscany) to denote either a particularly mighty duke or a monarchy playing an important political, military and/or economic role, but not large enough to be a Kingdom. It arose because the title of Duke had gradually lost status and precedence during the Middle Ages by having been granted to rulers of relatively small fiefs (feudal territories), instead of the large tribal regions or even national territories to which the title was once attached. One of the first examples occurred when Count Gon√ßalo I Mendes of Portucale (in northwest Portugal and considered as that country's original nucleus) took, in 987, the personal title of Magnus Dux Portucalensium (\\"Grand Duke of the Portuguese\\") and rebelled against his feudal lord, King Bermudo II of Le√≥n. He was defeated by the royal armies but nevertheless obtained a remarkable autonomy as a Magnus Dux (Grand Duke), leading ultimately to Portuguese independence from the Spanish Kingdom of Castille-Le√≥n. Another example was the line of self-proclaimed grand dukes (legally dukes) of Burgundy in the 15th century, when they ruled most of present-day north-eastern France as well as almost the entire Low Countries. They tried‚Äîultimately without success‚Äîto create from these territories under their control a new unified country between the Kingdom of France in the west and the Holy Roman Empire (mainly present-day Germany) in the east. Philip III, Duke of Burgundy (reigned 1419‚Äì67) assumed the subsidiary, legally void style and title of \\"Grand Duke of the West\\" in 1435, having previously brought the Duchies of Brabant and Limburg as well as the counties of Holland, Zeeland, Friesland, Hainaut and Namur into his possession. His son and successor Charles the Bold (reigned 1467‚Äì77) continued to use the same style and title. The title magnus dux or grand duke (Kunig≈≥ kunigas, Didysis kunigaik≈°tis in Lithuanian) has been used by the rulers of Lithuania, who after Jagiello also became Kings of Poland. From 1573, both the Latin version and its Polish equivalent wielki ksiaze (literally \\"grand prince\\"), the monarchic title of the rulers of Lithuania as well as of (western) Russia, Prussia, Mazovia, Samogithia, Kiev, Volhynia, Podolia, Podlachia, Livonia, Smolensk, Severia and Chernigov (including hollow claims nurtured by ambition), were used as part of their full official monarchic titles by the Kings (Polish: Krol) of Poland during the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. The first monarchs ever officially titled grand duke were the Medici sovereigns of Tuscany, starting from the late 16th century. This official title was granted by Pope Pius V in 1569; arguably it was a personal (Papal) title attached to a mere dukedom, though, because the territory was under the vassalage of the Holy Roman Empire. Napoleon I awarded the title extensively: during his era, several of his allies (and de facto vassals) were allowed to assume the title of grand duke, usually at the same time as their inherited fiefs (or fiefs granted by Napoleon) were enlarged by annexed territories previously belonging to enemies defeated on the battlefield. After Napoleon's downfall, the victorious powers who met at the Congress of Vienna, which dealt with the political aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, agreed to abolish the Grand Duchies created by Bonaparte and to create a group of monarchies of intermediate importance with that title. Thus the 19th century saw a new group of monarchs titled Grand Duke in central Europe, especially in present-day Germany. A list of these is available in the article grand duchy. 1860 postage stamp of the Grand Duchy of Finland In the same century, the purely ceremonial version of the title \\"grand duke\\" in Russia (in fact the western translation of the Russian title \\"grand prince\\" granted to the siblings of the tsar) expanded massively because of the large number of progeny of the ruling House of Romanov during those decades. In the German and Dutch languages, which have separate words for a prince as the issue (child) of a monarch (respectively Prinz, Prins) and for a sovereign prince (F√ºrst, Vorst), there is also a clear linguistic difference between a sovereign Grand Duke reigning over a state of central and western Europe (Gro√üherzog, Groothertog) and a non-sovereign, purely ceremonial Grand Duke of either the Russian Imperial family or other non-sovereign territories which are de facto dependencies of a major power (Gro√üf√ºrst, Grootvorst). In 1582, King John III of Sweden added \\"Grand Duke of Finland\\" to the subsidiary titles of the Swedish kings, but without any political consequences, as Finland was already a part of the Swedish realm. After the Russian conquests, the title continued to be used by the Russian Emperors in their role as rulers of both (de facto non-sovereign) Lithuania (1793‚Äì1918) and the (equally non-sovereign) autonomous Finland (1809‚Äì1917). The Holy Roman Empire under the House of Habsburg instituted a similar non-sovereign Gro√üf√ºrstentum Siebenb√ºrgen (Grand Principality of Transylvania) in 1765. Balkans =Byzantine grand dukes= The Latin title dux (the etymological root of duke), which was phonetically rendered doux (Œ¥ŒøœçŒæ) in Greek, was a common title for imperial generals in the Late Roman Empires (west and east), but note it was lower in rank than comes (the etymological root of Count). Under the latter, exclusively Byzantine theme system, the commander of a theme was often styled a doux instead of the earlier strategos from the 10th century on. The title of \\"Grand Duke\\" (megas doux) was created by Alexios I Komnenos and was conferred upon the commanding admiral of the Byzantine navy. As such, it was an actual office rather than a court rank (although it also became a grade in the court order of precedence under the Palaiologan emperors), and was always held by one individual. =Bosnian grand dukes= Grand Duke of Bosnia (; ) was a court title in the Kingdom of Bosnia, bestowed by the King to highest military commanders, usually reserved for most influential and most capable among highest Bosnian nobility. To interpret it as an office post rather than a court rank could be even more accurate. Unlike usage in Western Europe, Central Europe, or in various Slavic lands from Central to North-East Europe, where analogy between Grand Duke and Grand Prince was significant, with both titles corresponding to sovereign lower than King but higher than Duke, in Bosnia title Grand Duke corresponded more to Byzantine military title megas doux. It is possible to regester some similarities with equalent titles in neibourghing Slavic lands, such as Serbia however, in neighboring countries title Duke, in Slavic Vojvoda, also had military signification, but in that sense \\"Grand Duke\\" was specifically, even exclusively, Bosnian title. Eastern European = Russian grand dukes = Maria Fiodorovna by Heinrich von Angeli (1874) Saint Petersburg, Hermitage Museum \\"Grand duke\\" is the traditional translation of the title Velikiy Kniaz (–í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π –ö–Ω—è–∑—å), which from the 11th century was at first the title of the leading Prince (Kniaz) of Kievan Rus', then of several princes of the Rus'. From 1328 the Velikii Kniaz of Muscovy appeared as the grand duke for \\"all of Russia\\" until Ivan IV of Russia in 1547 was crowned as tsar. Thereafter the title was given to sons and grandsons (through male lines) of the Tsars and Emperors of Russia. The daughters and paternal granddaughters of Russian emperors, as well as the consorts of Russian grand dukes, were generally called \\"grand duchesses\\" in English. Another translation of the Russian title would be grand prince. While this term is a more precise translation, it is neither standard nor widely used in English. In German, however, a Russian Grand Duke was known as a Gro√üf√ºrst, and in Latin as magnus princeps. From 1809 to 1917 the Emperor of Russia was also the Grand Duke of Finland, which he held as an autonomous state. Before the Russian conquest Finland had been held by the Kings of Sweden, first as a royal duchy, since 1581 with the King assuming the secondary title Grand Prince of Finland (Finnish: Suomen suuriruhtinas, Swedish: Storfurste av Finland), also often translated as Grand Duke of Finland. Grand prince Grand princes (or sometimes great princes) were medieval monarchs who usually ruled over several tribes and/or were feudal overlords of other princes. At the time, the title was usually translated as \\"king\\", sometimes also as \\"Minor King\\" or \\"Little King\\" (). However, Grand Princes did not have the same monarchic precedence as later Western European kings, and thus they were considered lower in rank, particularly in later literature. Grand Princes reigned in Central and Eastern Europe, notably among Slavs and Lithuanians. The title \\"Grand Prince\\" translates to Velikiy Knjaz (–í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π –∫–Ω—è–∑—å) in Russian. The Slavic word knjaz and the Lithuanian kunigas (today translated as \\"priest\\") are cognates of the word King in its original meaning of \\"Ruler\\". Thus, the literal meaning of Veliki Knjaz and Didysis kunigaik≈°tis was more like \\"Great Ruler\\" than \\"Grand Duke\\". With the growing importance and size of their countries, those monarchs claimed a higher title, such as king or tsar (also spelled \\"Czar\\" in English) which was derived from the Latin Caesar (\\"Emperor\\") and based on the claim to be the legitimate successors of the Byzantine-East Roman Emperors. Grand Prince Ivan IV of Muscovy was the last monarch to reign without claiming any higher title, until he finally assumed the style Tsar of Russia in 1547. The rulers of the Turkish vassal state of Transylvania () used the title of Grand Prince; this title was later assumed by the Habsburgs after their conquest of Hungary. The Polish Kings of the Swedish House of Vasa also used the grand-princely title for their non-Polish territories. In the late Middle Ages, the title \\"Grand Prince/Grand Duke\\" became increasingly a purely ceremonial courtesy title for close relatives of ruling monarchs, such as the Tsar of Russia, who granted his brothers the title Grand Duke of Russia (veliki knjaz). =Grand Duke of Lithuania= Throughout the history of Lithuania from the middle 1200s to the late 1700s, most of its leaders were referred to as Grand Dukes of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, even when they jointly held the title King of Poland and other titles. Styles and forms of address Most often, a sovereign grand duke was, somewhat strangely, styled as \\"your/his/her royal highness\\" (abbreviated \\"HRH\\"), possibly because of the connection of many grand-ducal houses to royal ones or as the highest style beneath that of a king (which would be \\"your/his/her majesty\\", though \\"royal highness\\" is also used for such persons). The heir to the throne (a hereditary grand duke) was sometimes styled as \\"royal highness\\", otherwise as \\"your/his/her grand ducal highness\\" (HGDH). Junior members of the family also generally bore the lower title of prince or princess with the style of \\"grand ducal highness\\"; a famous example of which is Empress Alexandra Feodorovna of Russia, who was known as \\"Her Grand Ducal Highness Princess Alix of Hesse and by Rhine\\" (in German, Ihre Gro√üherzogliche Hoheit Prinzessin Alix von Hessen und bei Rhein) before her marriage to Tsar Nicholas II. However, in other grand duchies (e.g. Oldenburg), junior members of the family bore the title of duke or duchess, with the style of \\"your/his/her highness\\" (HH). The Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg styles all its members as \\"Royal Highness\\" since 1919, due to their being also cadet members of the Royal and Ducal House of Bourbon-Parma as male-line descendants of Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma. The Habsburg grand dukes of Tuscany, being members of the imperial family of Austria, were styled as \\"Imperial and Royal Highness\\" (HI&RH;). Grand dukes and grand duchesses from Russia were styled as \\"Imperial Highness\\" (HIH), being members of the Russian Imperial Family.

She won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her starring role in Kitty Foyle (1940), but is best remembered for performing during the 1930s in RKO's musical films with Fred Astaire. Her career continued on stage, radio and television throughout much of the 20th century. Born in Independence, Missouri and raised in Kansas City, Rogers and her family moved to Fort Worth, Texas when she was nine years old. After winning a 1925 Charleston dance contest that launched a successful vaudeville career, she gained recognition as a Broadway actress for her stage debut in Girl Crazy. This led to a contract with Paramount Pictures, which ended after five films. Rogers had her first successful film role as a supporting actress in 42nd Street (1933). In the 1930s, Rogers' nine films with Fred Astaire are credited with revolutionizing the genre and gave RKO Pictures some of its biggest successes, most notably Top Hat (1935) and Swing Time (1936). But after two commercial failures with Astaire, she branched out into dramatic and comedy films. Her acting was well received by critics and audiences, and after winning the Oscar she became one of the biggest box- office draws and highest paid actresses of the 1940s. Rogers' popularity peaked by the end of the decade. She reunited with Astaire in 1949 in the commercially successful The Barkleys of Broadway. After an unsuccessful period in the 1950s, she returned to Broadway in 1965, playing the lead role in Hello, Dolly!. More Broadway roles followed, along with her stage directorial debut in 1985 of an off-Broadway production of Babes in Arms. She continued to act, making television appearances until 1987 and wrote an autobiography Ginger: My Story which was published in 1991. In 1992, Rogers was recognized at the Kennedy Center Honors. She died of natural causes in 1995, at age 83. Rogers is associated with the phrase \\"backwards and in high heels\\", which is attributed to Bob Thaves' Frank and Ernest 1982 cartoon with the caption \\"Sure he [Astaire] was great, but don't forget that Ginger Rogers did everything he did...backwards and in high heels\\". This phrase is erroneously attributed to Ann Richards, who used it in her keynote address to the 1988 Democratic National Convention. A Republican and a devout Christian Scientist, Rogers married and divorced five times, having no children. During her long career, Rogers made 73 films and she ranks number 14 on the AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars list of female stars of classic American cinema.  Early life  100 W Moore St., Independence, Missouri, the birthplace of Ginger Rogers Virginia Katherine McMath was born on July 16, 1911, in Independence, Missouri, the only child of Lela Emogene (n√©e Owens; 1891‚Äì1977), a newspaper reporter, scriptwriter, and movie producer, and William Eddins McMath (1880‚Äì1925), an electrical engineer. Her maternal grandparents were Wilma Saphrona (n√©e Ball) and Walter Winfield Owens. She was of Scottish, Welsh, and English ancestry. Her mother gave birth to Ginger at home, having lost a previous child in a hospital. Her parents separated shortly after she was born.After unsuccessfully trying to reunite with his family, McMath kidnapped his daughter twice, and her mother divorced him soon thereafter. Rogers said that she never saw her natural father again. In 1915, Rogers moved in with her grandparents, who lived in nearby Kansas City, while her mother made a trip to Hollywood in an effort to get an essay she had written made into a film. Lela succeeded and continued to write scripts for Fox Studios. Rogers was to remain close to her grandfather and much later, when she was a star in 1939, she bought him a home at 5115 Greenbush Avenue in Sherman Oaks, California, so he could be close to her while she was filming at the studios. One of Rogers' young cousins, Helen, had a hard time pronouncing \\"Virginia\\", shortening it to \\"Badinda\\"; the nickname soon became \\"Ginga\\". When Rogers was nine years old, her mother married John Logan Rogers. Ginger took the surname Rogers, although she was never legally adopted. They lived in Fort Worth. Her mother became a theater critic for a local newspaper, the Fort Worth Record. She attended, but did not graduate from, Fort Worth's Central High School (later renamed Green B. Trimble Technical High School). As a teenager, Rogers thought of becoming a school teacher, but with her mother's interest in Hollywood and the theater, her early exposure to the theater increased. Waiting for her mother in the wings of the Majestic Theatre, she began to sing and dance along with the performers on stage.  Career  = 1925‚Äì1929: Vaudeville and Broadway = Rogers' entertainment career began when the traveling vaudeville act of Eddie Foy came to Fort Worth and needed a quick stand-in. In 1925 the 14-year-old entered and won a Charleston dance contest, the prize allowed her to tour as Ginger Rogers and the Redheads for six months on the Orpheum Circuit. In 1926 the act performed at an 18-month-old theater called The Craterian in Medford, Oregon. This theater honored her years later by changing its name to the Craterian Ginger Rogers Theater. When the M.G.M film The Barrier premiered in San Bernardino, California in February 1926, Rogers‚Äô vaudeville act was featured. The local newspaper commented, ‚ÄúClever little Ginger Rogers showed why she won the Texas state championship as a Charleston dancer.‚Äù ‚ÄúWorld Premiere of Picture Viewed by Thousands Here - 'The Barrier' Voted Mighty Spectacle, Vaudeville Fine,‚Äù The San Bernardino Daily Sun, Monday 1 March 1926, Volume LVIII, Number 1, page 6. At 17, Rogers married Jack Culpepper, a singer/dancer/comedian/recording artist of the day who worked under the name Jack Pepper (according to Ginger's autobiography, she knew Culpepper when she was a child, as her cousin's boyfriend). They formed a short-lived vaudeville double act known as \\"Ginger and Pepper\\". The marriage was over within months, and she went back to touring with her mother. When the tour got to New York City, she stayed, getting radio singing jobs and then her Broadway debut in the musical Top Speed, which opened on Christmas Day, 1929. Within two weeks of opening in Top Speed, Rogers was chosen to star on Broadway in Girl Crazy by George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin. Fred Astaire was hired to help the dancers with their choreography. Her appearance in Girl Crazy made her an overnight star at the age of 19. = 1929‚Äì1933: Early film roles = Una Merkel, Ruby Keeler, and Ginger Rogers in 42nd Street (1933) Rogers' first movie roles were in a trio of short films made in 1929‚ÄîNight in the Dormitory, A Day of a Man of Affairs, and Campus Sweethearts. In 1930, Paramount Pictures signed her to a seven-year contract. Rogers soon got herself out of the Paramount contract‚Äîunder which she had made five feature films at Astoria Studios in Astoria, Queens‚Äîand moved with her mother to Hollywood. When she got to California, she signed a three-picture deal with Path√© Exchange. Two of her pictures at Path√© were Suicide Fleet (1931) and Carnival Boat (1932) in which she played opposite future Hopalong Cassidy star, William Boyd. Rogers also made feature films for Warner Bros., Monogram, and Fox in 1932, and was named one of 15 WAMPAS Baby Stars. She then made a significant breakthrough as Anytime Annie in the Warner Bros. film 42nd Street (1933). She went on to make a series of films at Warner Bros. most notably in Gold Diggers of 1933 where her solo, \\"We're In The Money\\", included a verse in Pig Latin. She then moved to RKO Studios, was put under contract and started work on \\"Flying Down To Rio\\"', a picture starring Dolores Del Rio and Gene Raymond but it was soon stolen by Rogers and Broadway star Fred Astaire. = 1933‚Äì1939: Partnership of Rogers and Astaire = Rogers was known for her partnership with Fred Astaire. Together, from 1933 to 1939, they made nine musical films at RKO: Flying Down to Rio (1933), The Gay Divorcee (1934), Roberta (1935), Top Hat (1935), Follow the Fleet (1936), Swing Time (1936), Shall We Dance (1937), Carefree (1938), and The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939). The Barkleys of Broadway (1949) was produced later at MGM. They revolutionized the Hollywood musical by introducing dance routines of unprecedented elegance and virtuosity with sweeping long shots set to songs specially composed for them by the greatest popular song composers of the day. One such composer was Cole Porter with \\"Night and Day\\", a song Astaire sang to Rogers with the line \\"...you are the one\\" in two of their movies, being particularly poignant in their last pairing of The Barkleys of Broadway. Rogers with her frequent co-star Fred Astaire in the film Roberta (1935) Arlene Croce, Hermes Pan, Hannah Hyam, and John Mueller all consider Rogers to have been Astaire's finest dance partner, principally because of her ability to combine dancing skills, natural beauty, and exceptional abilities as a dramatic actress and comedian, thus truly complementing Astaire, a peerless dancer. The resulting song and dance partnership enjoyed a unique credibility in the eyes of audiences. Of the 33 partnered dances Rogers performed with Astaire, Croce and Mueller have highlighted the infectious spontaneity of her performances in the comic numbers \\"I'll Be Hard to Handle\\" from Roberta, \\"I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket\\" from Follow the Fleet, and \\"Pick Yourself Up\\" from Swing Time. They also point to the use Astaire made of her remarkably flexible back in classic romantic dances such as \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" from Roberta, \\"Cheek to Cheek\\" from Top Hat, and \\"Let's Face the Music and Dance\\" from Follow the Fleet. Although the dance routines were choreographed by Astaire and his collaborator Hermes Pan, both have testified to her consummate professionalism, even during periods of intense strain, as she tried to juggle her many other contractual film commitments with the punishing rehearsal schedules of Astaire, who made at most two films in any one year. In 1986, shortly before his death, Astaire remarked, \\"All the girls I ever danced with thought they couldn't do it, but of course they could. So they always cried. All except Ginger. No, no, Ginger never cried\\". John Mueller summed up Rogers' abilities as: \\"Rogers was outstanding among Astaire's partners, not because she was superior to others as a dancer, but, because, as a skilled, intuitive actress, she was cagey enough to realize that acting did not stop when dancing began...the reason so many women have fantasized about dancing with Fred Astaire is that Ginger Rogers conveyed the impression that dancing with him is the most thrilling experience imaginable\\". Author Dick Richards, in his book Ginger: Salute to a Star, quoted Astaire saying to Raymond Rohauer, curator at the New York Gallery of Modern Art, \\"Ginger was brilliantly effective. She made everything work for her. Actually she made things very fine for both of us and she deserves most of the credit for our success.\\" In a 1976 episode of the popular British talk-show Parkinson (Season 5-Episode 24), host Sir Michael Parkinson asked Astaire who his favorite dancing partner was. Astaire answered, \\"...Ginger. She was the one. You know, the most effective partner I ever had. Everyone knows.\\" In her classic 1930s musicals with Astaire, Ginger Rogers, co-billed with him, was paid less than Fred, the creative force behind the dances, who also received 10% of the profits. She was also paid less than many of the supporting \\"farceurs\\" billed beneath her, in spite of her much more central role in the films' great financial successes. This was personally grating to her and had effects upon her relationships at RKO, especially with director Mark Sandrich, whose purported disrespect of Rogers prompted a sharp letter of reprimand from producer Pandro Berman, which she deemed important enough to publish in her autobiography. Rogers fought hard for her contract and salary rights and for better films and scripts. After 15 months apart and with RKO facing bankruptcy, the studio paired Fred and Ginger for another movie titled Carefree, but it lost money. Next came The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle, based on a true story, but the serious plot and tragic ending resulted in the worst box-office receipts of any of their films. This was driven not by diminished popularity, but by the hard 1930s economic reality. The production costs of musicals, always significantly more costly than regular features, continued to increase at a much faster rate than admissions. = 1933‚Äì1939: Success in nonmusicals = Both before and immediately after her dancing and acting partnership with Fred Astaire ended, Rogers starred in a number of successful nonmusical films. Stage Door (1937) demonstrated her dramatic capacity, as the loquacious yet vulnerable girl next door and tough- minded theatrical hopeful, opposite Katharine Hepburn. Successful comedies included Vivacious Lady (1938) with James Stewart, Fifth Avenue Girl (1939), where she played an out-of-work girl sucked into the lives of a wealthy family, and Bachelor Mother (1939), with David Niven, in which she played a shop girl who is falsely thought to have abandoned her baby. In 1934, Rogers sued Sylvia of Hollywood for $100K for defamation. The fitness guru and radio personality had claimed that Rogers was on her radio show when, in fact, she was not.Interview Suit Begun By Actress: Screen Player Asks Damages, Los Angeles Times, March 24, 1934. On March 5, 1939, Rogers starred in \\"Single Party Going East\\", an episode of Silver Theater on CBS radio. = 1940‚Äì1949: Career peak and reuniting with Astaire = Life cover featuring Kitty Foyle, her Oscar-winning role In 1941 Rogers won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in 1940's Kitty Foyle. She enjoyed considerable success during the early 1940s, and was RKO's hottest property during this period. In Roxie Hart (1942), based on the same play which later served as the template for the musical Chicago, Rogers played a wisecracking flapper in a love triangle on trial for the murder of her lover; set in the era of prohibition. Most of the film takes place in a women's jail. In the neorealist Primrose Path (1940), directed by Gregory La Cava, she played a prostitute's daughter trying to avoid family pressure into following the fate of her mother. Further highlights of this period included Tom, Dick, and Harry, a 1941 comedy in which she dreams of marrying three different men; I'll Be Seeing You (1944), with Joseph Cotten; and Billy Wilder's first Hollywood feature film: The Major and the Minor (1942), in which she played a woman who masquerades as a 12-year-old to get a cheap train ticket and finds herself obliged to continue the ruse for an extended period. This film featured a performance by Rogers' real mother, Lela, playing her film mother. After becoming a free agent, Rogers made hugely successful films with other studios in the mid-'40s, including Tender Comrade (1943), Lady in the Dark (1944), and Week-End at the Waldorf (1945), and became the highest-paid performer in Hollywood. However, by the end of the decade, her film career had peaked. Arthur Freed reunited her with Fred Astaire in The Barkleys of Broadway in 1949, when Judy Garland was unable to appear in the role that was to have reunited her with her Easter Parade co-star. = 1950‚Äì1987: Later career = Rogers' film career entered a period of gradual decline in the 1950s, as parts for older actresses became more difficult to obtain, but she still scored with some solid movies. She starred in Storm Warning (1950) with Ronald Reagan and Doris Day, a noir, anti-Ku Klux Klan film by Warner Bros. In 1952 Rogers starred in two comedies featuring Marilyn Monroe, Monkey Business with Cary Grant, directed by Howard Hawks, and We're Not Married!. She followed those with a role in Dreamboat alongside Clifton Webb, as his wife. She played the female lead in Tight Spot (1955), a mystery thriller, with Edward G. Robinson. After a series of unremarkable films, she scored a great popular success on Broadway in 1965, playing Dolly Levi in the long-running Hello, Dolly!. Ginger Rogers with Cary Grant and Marilyn Monroe in Monkey Business (1952) In later life, Rogers remained on good terms with Astaire; she presented him with a special Academy Award in 1950, and they were copresenters of individual Academy Awards in 1967, during which they elicited a standing ovation when they came on stage in an impromptu dance. In 1969, she had the lead role in another long-running popular production, Mame, from the book by Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee, with music and lyrics by Jerry Herman, at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in the West End of London, arriving for the role on the liner Queen Elizabeth 2 from New York City. Her docking there occasioned the maximum of pomp and ceremony at Southampton. She became the highest-paid performer in the history of the West End up to that time. The production ran for 14 months and featured a royal command performance for Queen Elizabeth II. From the 1950s onward, Rogers made occasional appearances on television, even substituting for a vacationing Hal March on The $64,000 Question. In the later years of her career, she made guest appearances in three different series by Aaron Spelling: The Love Boat (1979), Glitter (1984), and Hotel (1987), which was her final screen appearance as an actress. In 1985, Rogers fulfilled a long- standing wish to direct when she directed the musical Babes in Arms off- Broadway in Tarrytown, New York, at 74 years old. It was produced by Michael Lipton and Robert Kennedy of Kennedy Lipton Productions. The production starred Broadway talents Donna Theodore, Carleton Carpenter, James Brennan, Randy Skinner, Karen Ziemba, Dwight Edwards, and Kim Morgan. It is also noted in her autobiography Ginger, My Story. = Honors = The Kennedy Center honored Ginger Rogers in December 1992. This event, which was shown on television, was somewhat marred when Astaire's widow, Robyn Smith, who permitted clips of Astaire dancing with Rogers to be shown for free at the function itself, was unable to come to terms with CBS Television for broadcast rights to the clips (all previous rights-holders having donated broadcast rights gratis). For her contributions to the motion picture industry, Rogers has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6772 Hollywood Boulevard.  Personal life  Rogers with Jacques Bergerac in the 1950s Rogers, an only child, maintained a close relationship with her mother, Lela Rogers, throughout her life. Lela, a newspaper reporter, scriptwriter, and movie producer, was also one of the first women to enlist in the Marine Corps, was a founder of the successful \\"Hollywood Playhouse\\" for aspiring actors and actresses on the RKO set, and a founder of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals. Rogers was a lifelong member of the Republican Party, who campaigned for Thomas Dewey in the 1944 presidential election and was a strong opponent of Franklin Delano Roosevelt speaking out against both him and his New Deal proposals. She was also a member of The Daughters of the American Revolution. Rogers and her mother also had an extremely close professional relationship. Lela Rogers was credited with many pivotal contributions to her daughter's early successes in New York City and in Hollywood, and gave her much assistance in contract negotiations with RKO. She also wrote a children's mystery book with her daughter as the central character. On March 29, 1929, Rogers married for the first time at age 17 to her dancing partner Jack Pepper (real name Edward Jackson Culpepper). They divorced in 1931, having separated soon after the wedding. Ginger dated Mervyn LeRoy in 1932, but they ended the relationship and remained friends until his death in 1987. In 1934, she married actor Lew Ayres (1908‚Äì96). They divorced seven years later. In 1943, Rogers married her third husband, Jack Briggs, who was a U.S. Marine. Upon his return from World War II, Briggs showed no interest in continuing his incipient Hollywood career. They divorced in 1949. In 1953, she married Jacques Bergerac, a French actor 16 years her junior, whom she met on a trip to Paris. A lawyer in France, he came to Hollywood with her and became an actor. They divorced in 1957. Her fifth and final husband was director and producer William Marshall. They married in 1961 and divorced in 1969, after his bouts with alcohol and the financial collapse of their joint film production company in Jamaica. Rogers in 1993 Rogers was lifelong friends with actresses Lucille Ball and Bette Davis. She appeared with Ball in an episode of Here's Lucy on November 22, 1971, in which Rogers danced the Charleston for the first time in many years. Rogers starred in one of the earliest films co-directed and co-scripted by a woman, Wanda Tuchock's Finishing School (1934). Rogers maintained a close friendship with her cousin, writer/socialite Phyllis Fraser, wife of Random House publisher Bennett Cerf, but was not Rita Hayworth's natural cousin, as has been reported. Hayworth's maternal uncle, Vinton Hayworth, was married to Rogers' maternal aunt, Jean Owens. She was raised a Christian Scientist and remained a lifelong adherent. She devoted a great deal of time in her autobiography to the importance of her faith throughout her career. Rogers' mother died in 1977. Rogers remained at the 4-Rs (Rogers' Rogue River Ranch) until 1990, when she sold the property and moved to nearby Medford, Oregon. The City of Independence, Missouri, designated the birthplace of Ginger Rogers a Historic Landmark Property in 1994. On July 16, 1994, Ginger and her secretary, Roberta Olden, visited Independence, Missouri to appear at the Ginger Rogers' Day celebration presented by the city. Ginger was present when Mayor Ron Stewart affixed a Historic Landmark Property plaque to the front of the house where she was born on July 16, 1911. She signed over 2,000 autographs at this event. This was one of her last public appearances. The home was purchased in 2016 by Three Trails Cottages and restored, then transformed into a museum dedicated to Lela Owens- Rogers and Ginger Rogers. It contains memorabilia, magazines, movie posters, and many items from Ginger's ranch that Lela and Ginger owned. Several gowns that Ginger Rogers wore are on display. The museum was open seasonally from April - September, and several special events are held on the site each year. It closed in August 2019. Ginger Rogers made her last public appearance on 18 March 1995, when she received the Women's International Center (WIC) Living Legacy Award. For many years, Rogers regularly supported, and held in-person presentations, at the Craterian Theater, in Medford, where she had performed in 1926 as a vaudevillian. The theater was comprehensively restored in 1997 and posthumously renamed in her honor as the Craterian Ginger Rogers Theater.  Death  Grave of Ginger Rogers at Oakwood Memorial Park Rogers spent winters in Rancho Mirage and summers in Medford, Oregon. She died at her Rancho Mirage home on April 25, 1995, from natural causes at the age of 83. She was cremated and her ashes interred in the Oakwood Memorial Park Cemetery in Chatsworth, California, with her mother's remains.  Legacy  * Likenesses of Astaire and Rogers, apparently painted over from the \\"Cheek to Cheek\\" dance in Top Hat, are in the \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\" section of The Beatles film Yellow Submarine (1968). * Rogers' image is one of many famous women's images of the 1930s and '40s featured on the bedroom wall in the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, a gallery of magazine cuttings pasted on the wall created by Anne and her sister Margot while hiding from the Nazis.

Its most famous product is the Z80 series of 8-bit microprocessors that were compatible with the Intel 8080 but significantly cheaper. The Z80 was widely used during the 1980s in many popular home computers such as the TRS-80 and the ZX Spectrum, as well as arcade games such as Pac-Man. The company also made 16- and 32-bit processors, but these did not see widespread use. From the 1990s, the company focused primarily on the microcontroller market. The name (pronunciation varies) is an acronym of Z integrated logic, also thought of as \\"Z for the last word of Integrated Logic\\".Zilog Oral History Panel on the Founding of the Company and the Development of the Z80 Microprocessor History Zilog was started in California in 1974 by Federico Faggin and Ralph Ungermann, who both left Intel after working on the 4004 and 8080 microprocessors and custom chips. Masatoshi Shima, who also worked with Faggin on the 4004 and 8080, joined Zilog in 1975. Ungermann had a falling-out with Faggin and left Zilog in 1978. The company became a subsidiary of Exxon in 1980, but the management and employees bought it back in 1989, led by Dr. Edgar Sack. Zilog went public in 1991, but was acquired in 1998 by Texas Pacific Group. Curtis Crawford replaced Dr. Sack and changed the company's direction towards 32-bit data communications processors. Bonds were sold against the company to fund the new developments, but after the Internet bubble burst in 2000 and the resultant reduction in customer demand for such products, Curtis Crawford was replaced by James (Jim) Thorburn, who reorganized the company under Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late 2001 and refocused it on the 8- and 16-bit microcontroller market. Jim Thorburn led Zilog back into profitability, and by FY 2007, Zilog had $82 million in sales. During this time, the company developed the Z8 Encore! 8-bit Flash MCU and ZNEO 16-bit Flash MCU product families. In February 2007, Zilog hired Darin Billerbeck to replace Jim Thorburn as President and CEO. The last year Zilog introduced any new 8-bit microcontroller products was 2007. With no new product road map, FY2008 sales fell 20% to $67.2 million. Sales fell 46% in FY2009 to $36.2 million. In January 2008, Zilog declined an unsolicited proposal made by Universal Electronics Inc. to acquire the company. Zilog's iconic 8-bit processor, the Z80. Pictured is one of the first Z80s ever made. On February 19, 2009, Zilog announced that it had sold off its 8-bit Crimzon Universal Remote Control infrared microcontroller product line, as well as its ARM9 32-bit microcontrollers, including the Zatara security microcontrollers and 15 patents, to Maxim Integrated Products. Remote control manufacturer Universal Electronics Inc. purchased all of Zilog's software and intellectual property assets related to Zilog's universal remote control business, including all ROM code, software, and database of infrared codes. Zilog sold these assets for $31 million cash. In December 2009, IXYS Corporation bought the company for $62.4 million in cash, which was significantly below the market valuation of Zilog's stock at the time. Details of the acquisition have been under investigation. Since early 2010, Zilog has refocused its efforts toward satisfying the industrial and consumer markets for motion detection, motor control, RF wireless and embedded security applications, and is currently producing a number of reference designs that integrate its 8- and 16-bit microcontrollers with IXYS power management products. In February 2012, Zilog announced the release of its Z8051 family of microcontrollers and tool sets to fill a vacancy in the developer market for 8051 cores that was created when chip-maker NXP Semiconductors exited the 8051 market. Later that year, Zilog announced its ZGATE Embedded Security solution, which incorporates its eZ80F91 MCU and TCP/IP stack with an embedded firewall to offer protection against cyber threats and attacks at the chip level. In August 2017, Zilog and its parent IXYS Corporation were acquired by Littelfuse Inc in exchange for $750 million in cash and stocks. Microprocessors =Z80= The Z80(i) was an improved implementation of the Intel 8080 architecture, which was faster, more capable, and much cheaper; alongside the 6502 it was one of the most popular 8-bit processors for general purpose microcomputers and other applications. The CPU was used in the Sinclair ZX80, ZX81, ZX Spectrum and the Amstrad CPC home computers as well as the MSX architecture and the Microbee and Tandy TRS-80. The CP/M operating system (and its huge software library featuring hits like WordStar and dBase) was known to be the Z80 disk operating system\\", and its success is partly due to the popularity of the Z80. The 1985 Commodore 128 added a Z80 to the Commodore 64 hardware allowing it to run CP/M software. The Z80 was a common choice for creators of video games during the Golden age of arcade video games, with a Z80 powering Pac-Man, dual Z80s in Scramble, and three in each Galaga machine. It was the central processor for the ColecoVision game console (1982), Sega's Master System (1986) and Game Gear (1990), and the over 100 million unit selling Nintendo Game Boy (1989). In the 1990s, the Z80 was the CPU of the Texas Instruments graphing calculator series, as well as being used as the sound CPU in the Sega Genesis. =Other chips= After the Z80 Zilog introduced the 16-bit Z8000 and 32-bit Z80000 processors, but these were not particularly successful, and the company refocused on the microcontroller market, producing both basic CPUs and application-specific integrated circuits/standard products (ASICs/ASSPs) built around a CPU core. As well as producing processors, Zilog has produced several other components. One of the most famous was the Zilog SCC serial communications controller as found on early Apple Macintosh, Sun SPARCstations and SPARCservers up to the SPARCstation 20. Zilog also formed a Systems Division, which designed the Zilog System 8000, a Z8000- or Z80000-based multiuser computer system running a Unix derivative called ZEUS (Zilog Enhanced UNIX System). Zilog attempted to enter the 32-bit microcontroller market in February 2006 with the demonstration of ARM9-based Point-Of-Sale (POS) microcontroller product line.ZiLOG(R) Unveils 32-Bit ARM-9(R) Application-Specific Strategy to Focus on Security and Point-of-Sale MarketsNew ZiLOG ARM9 Microcontroller Product Line The final product was released in 2007 called Zatara.Zilog Leads the Secure Transactions Market with New 32-bit High Security Zatara(TM) Series ARM(R) Core Based ASSP Sales were disappointing and the entire ARM9 series was sold to Maxim Integrated Products in 2009.

In January 2020, he was appointed Minister of Universities in the S√°nchez II Government of Spain. He is Full Professor of Sociology, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC), in Barcelona. He is as well University Professor and the Wallis Annenberg Chair Professor of Communication Technology and Society at the Annenberg School of Communication, University of Southern California, Los Angeles. He is Professor Emeritus of Sociology, and Professor Emeritus of City and Regional Planning at the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught for 24 years. He is a fellow of St. John's College, University of Cambridge. Professor Castells hold the chair of Network Society, Coll√®ge d‚Äô√âtudes Mondiales, Paris. The 2000‚Äì2014 research survey of the Social Sciences Citation Index ranks him as the world's fifth most-cited social science scholar, and the foremost-cited communication scholar. He was awarded the 2012 Holberg Prize, for having \\"shaped our understanding of the political dynamics of urban and global economies in the network society.\\" In 2013 he was awarded the Balzan Prize for Sociology. Life Manuel Castells was raised primarily in La Mancha but he moved to Barcelona, where he studied Law and Economics. From a conservative family, Castells says: > My parents were very good parents. It was a conservative family ‚Äî very > strongly conservative family. But I would say that the main thing that > shaped my character besides my parents was the fact that I grew up in > fascist Spain. It's difficult for people of the younger generation to > realize what that means, even for the Spanish younger generation. You had > actually to resist the whole environment, and to be yourself, you had to > fight and to politicize yourself from the age of fifteen or sixteen\\".Harry > Kreisler, Manuel Castells, Conversations with History: Manuel Castells > (video interview, 9 May 2001), Berkeley, CA: University of California > Television (UCTV), 2001, 1min26sec. Castells was politically active in the student anti-Franco movement, an adolescent political activism that forced him to flee Spain for France. In Paris, at the age of 20, he completed his degree studies, then progressed to the University of Paris, where he earned a doctorate in sociology. Castells graduated from the Sorbonne in 1964 and received his Ph.D from the University of Paris in 1967. At the age of twenty-four, Castells became an instructor in several Parisian universities from 1967 to 1979; first at the Paris X University Nanterre (where he taught Daniel Cohn-Bendit), which fired him because of the 1968 student protests, then at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales, from 1970 to 1979. In 1979, the University of California, Berkeley appointed him as professor of sociology, and professor of city and regional planning. In 2001, he was a research professor at the UOC-Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (Open University of Catalonia), Barcelona. In 2003, he joined the University of Southern California (USC) Annenberg School for Communication, as a professor of communication and the first Wallis Annenberg- endowed Chair of Communication and Technology. Castells is a founding member of the USC Center on Public Diplomacy, and a senior member of the diplomacy center's Faculty Advisory Council; and is a member of the Annenberg Research Network on International Communication. Castells divides his residence between Spain and the US. Since 2008 he has been a member of the governing board of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology. He is Minister of Universities in Spain since January 2020. He is father of one daughter and has two grandchildren. Work The sociological work of Manuel Castells synthesises empirical research literature with combinations of urban sociology, organization studies, internet studies, social movements, sociology of culture, and political economy. About the origins of the network society, he posits that changes to the network form of enterprise predate the electronic internet technologies (usually) associated with network organization forms (cf. Organization theory (Castells)). Moreover, he coined the (academic) term \\"The Fourth World\\", denoting the sub-population(s) socially excluded from the global society; usual usage denotes the nomadic, pastoral, and hunter-gatherer ways of life beyond the contemporary industrial society norm. Castells maintains that the Information Age can \\"unleash the power of the mind\\", which would dramatically increase the productivity of individuals and lead to greater leisure, allowing individuals to achieve \\"greater spiritual depth and more environmental consciousness\\". Such change would be positive, he argues, in that it would cause resource consumption to decrease. The Information Age, The Age of Consumption, and The Network Society are all perspectives attempting to describe modern life as known in the present and to depict the future of society. As Castells suggests, contemporary society may be described as \\"replacing the antiquated metaphor of the machine with that of the network\\". In the 1970s, following the path of Alain Touraine (his intellectual father),Castells and Ince 2003, pp. 11‚Äì12 Castells was a key developer of the variety of Marxist urban sociology that emphasises the role of social movements in the conflictive transformation of the city (cf. post-industrial society).Castells and Ince 2003, p. 12 He introduced the concept of \\"collective consumption\\" (public transport, public housing, etc.) comprehending a wide range of social struggles‚Äîdisplaced from the economic stratum to the political stratum via state intervention. Transcending Marxist structures in the early 1980s, he concentrated upon the role of new technologies in the restructuring of an economy. In 1989, he introduced the concept of the \\"space of flows\\", the material and immaterial components of global information networks used for the real-time, long- distance co-ordination of the economy. In the 1990s, he combined his two research strands in The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture, published as a trilogy, The Rise of the Network Society (1996), The Power of Identity (1997), and End of Millennium (1998); two years later, its worldwide, favourable critical acceptance in university seminars, prompted publication of a second (2000) edition that is 40 per cent different from the first (1996) edition.Castells and Ince 2003, p. 20 The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture comprehends three sociological dimensions‚Äîproduction, power, and experience‚Äîstressing that the organisation of the economy, of the state and its institutions, and the ways that people create meaning in their lives through collective action, are irreducible sources of social dynamics‚Äîthat must be understood as both discrete and inter-related entities. Moreover, he became an established cybernetic culture theoretician with his Internet development analysis stressing the roles of the state (military and academic), social movements (computer hackers and social activists), and business, in shaping the economic infrastructure according to their (conflicting) interests. The Information Age trilogy is his pr√©cis: \\"Our societies are increasingly structured around the bipolar opposition of the Net and the Self\\";Castells, The Rise of the Network Society (1996) p. 3 the \\"Net\\" denotes the network organisations replacing vertically integrated hierarchies as the dominant form of social organization, the Self denotes the practices a person uses in reaffirming social identity and meaning in a continually changing cultural landscape.

G. Collingwood H√°vam√°l ( ; Old Norse: H√°vam√°l,Unnormalised spelling in the Codex Regius: Title: hava mal Final stanza: Nv ero Hava m√°l qve√∞in H√°va hÍúπllo i [...] classical pron. , Modern Icelandic pron. , ‚ÄòWords of H√°vi [the High One]‚Äô) is presented as a single poem in the Codex Regius, a collection of Old Norse poems from the Viking age. The poem, itself a combination of numerous shorter poems, is largely gnomic, presenting advice for living, proper conduct and wisdom. It is considered an important source of Old Norse philosophy. The verses are attributed to Odin; the implicit attribution to Odin facilitated the accretion of various mythological material also dealing with the same deity.Bellows (1936), introductory note. For the most part composed in the metre lj√≥√∞ah√°ttr, a metre associated with wisdom verse, H√°vam√°l is both practical and philosophical in content. Following the gnomic \\"H√°vam√°l proper\\" comes the R√∫natal, an account of how Odin won the runes, and the Lj√≥√∞atal, a list of magic chants or spells.Larrington, Carolyne. (Trans.) (1999) The Poetic Edda, p. 14. Oxford World's Classics  Name  The Old Norse name H√°vam√°l is a compound of the genitive form of H√°vi, which is the inflexionally weak form of Odin's name H√°r ('High One'), and the plural noun m√°l (from older m«´ÃÅl), and means 'Song (or Words) of the High One'. Textual history The only surviving source for H√°vam√°l is the 13th century Codex Regius, with the exception of two short parts.The first stanza is also found in the manuscripts of the Prose Edda (in slightly different versions), and three lines of a later stanza are also found in the manuscripts of F√≥stbr≈ì√∞ra saga (again in slightly different versions). The part dealing with ethical conduct (the Gesta√æ√°ttr) was traditionally identified as the oldest portion of the poem by scholarship in the 19th and early 20th century. Bellows (1936) identifies as the core of the poem a \\"collection of proverbs and wise counsels\\" which dates to \\"a very early time\\", but which, by the nature of oral tradition, never had a fixed form or extent. Von See (1981) identifies direct influence of the Disticha Catonis on the Gesta√æ√°ttr, suggesting that also this part is a product of the high medieval period and casting doubt on the \\"unadulterated Germanic character\\" of the poem claimed by earlier commentators.Klaus von See: ‚ÄûDisticha Catonis und H√°vam√°l.‚Äú In: Klaus von See: Edda, Saga, Skaldendichtung. Heidelberg 1981, 27‚Äì44. To the gnomic core of the poem, other fragments and poems dealing with wisdom and proverbs accreted over time. A discussion of authorship or date for the individual parts would be futile, since almost every line or stanza could have been added, altered or removed at will at any time before the poem was written down in the 13th century. Individual verses or stanzas nevertheless certainly date to as early as the 10th, or even the 9th century. Thus, the line deyr f√©, deyja fr√¶ndr (\\"cattle die, kinsmen die\\") found in verses 76 and 77 of the Gesta√æ√°ttr can be shown to date to the 10th century, as it also occurs in the H√°konarm√°l by Eyvindr sk√°ldaspillir. Structure The H√°vam√°l is edited in 165 stanzas by Bellows (1936). Other editions give 164 stanzas, combining Bellow's stanzas 11 and 12, as the manuscript abbreviates the last two lines of stanzas 11. Some editors also combine Bellow's stanzas 163 and 164. In the following, Bellow's numeration is used. The poems in H√°vam√°l is traditionally taken to consist of at least five independent parts, #the Gesta√æ√°ttr, or H√°vam√°l proper, (stanzas 1‚Äì80), a collection of proverbs and gnomic wisdom #a dissertation on the faithlessness of women (stanzas 81‚Äì95), prefacing an account of the love-story of Odin and the daughter of Billingr (stanzas 96‚Äì102) and the story of how Odin got the mead of poetry from the maiden Gunnl√∂√∞ (stanzas 103‚Äì110) #the Loddf√°fnism√°l (stanzas 111‚Äì138), a collection of gnomic verses similar to the Gesta√æ√°ttr, addressed to a certain Loddf√°fnir #the R√∫natal (stanzas 139‚Äì146), an account of how Odin won the runes, introductory to the Lj√≥√∞atal #the Lj√≥√∞atal (stanzas 147‚Äì165), a collection of charms Stanzas 6 and 27 are expanded beyond the standard four lines by an additional two lines of \\"commentary\\". Bellow's edition inverses the manuscript order of stanzas 39 and 40. Bellow's stanza 138 (Lj√≥√∞alok) is taken from the very end of the poem in the manuscript, placed before the R√∫natal by most editors following M√ºllenhoff. Stanzas 65, 73‚Äì74, 79, 111, 133‚Äì134, 163 are defective. Stanzas 81‚Äì84 are in m√°lah√°ttr, 85‚Äì88 in fornyr√∞islag. The entire section of 81‚Äì102 appears to be an ad hoc interpolation. Stanza 145 is also an interpolation in m√°lah√°ttr. Contents =Gesta√æ√°ttr= The first section Gesta√æ√°ttr, the \\"guest's section\\". Stanzas 1 through 79 comprise a set of maxims for how to handle oneself when a guest and traveling, focusing particularly on manners and other behavioral relationships between hosts and guests and the sacred lore of reciprocity and hospitality to the Norse pagans. The first stanza exemplifies the practical behavioral advice it offers: \\"Gattir allar, a√ær gangi fram, vm sco√∞az scyli, vm scygnaz scyli; √æviat ouist er at vita, hvar ovinir sitia a fleti fyr.\\"Quoted after the Codex Regius. All the entrances, before you walk forward, you should look at, you should spy out; for you can't know for certain where enemies are sitting, ahead in the hall Number 77 is possibly the most known section of Gesta√æ√°ttr: \\"Deyr fƒô, deyia fr«´ndr, deyr sialfr it sama; ec veit einn at aldri de√Ωr: domr vm dÍúπ√æan hvern.\\" Cattle die, friends die, and the same with you; but I know of something that never dies and that's a dead person's deeds. =On women= Billingr's girl watches on while Odin encounters the bitch tied to her bedpost (1895) by Lorenz Fr√∏lich. Stanzas 83 to 110 deal with the general topic of romantic love and the character of women. It is introduced by a discussion of the faithlessness of women and advice for the seducing of them in stanzas 84‚Äì95, followed by two mythological accounts of Odin's interaction with women also known as \\"Odin's Examples\\" or \\"Odin's Love Quests\\". The first is an account of Odin's thwarted attempt of possessing the daughter of Billing (stanzas 96‚Äì102), followed by the story of the mead of poetry which Odin won by seducing its guardian, the maiden Gunnl√∂√∞ (stanzas 103‚Äì110). =Loddf√°fnism√°l= The Loddf√°fnism√°l (stanzas 111‚Äì138) is again gnomic, dealing with morals, ethics, correct action and codes of conduct. The section is directed to Loddf√°fnir (\\"stray-singer\\"). =R√∫natal= \\"Odin's Self-sacrifice\\" (1908) by W. G. Collingwood. The younger Jelling stone (erected by Harald Bluetooth c. 970) shows the crucifixion of Christ with the victim suspended in the branches of a tree instead of on a cross.c.f. Patton 2009:271. R√∫natal or √ì√∞ins Rune Song, R√∫nat√°ls-√æ√°ttr-√ì√∞ins (stanzas 139‚Äì146) is a section of the H√°vam√°l where Odin reveals the origins of the runes. In stanzas 139 and 140, Odin describes his sacrifice of himself to himself: \\"Vƒôit ec at ec hecc vindga mei√∞i a nƒôtr allar n√≠o, geiri vnda√ær oc gefinn O√∞ni, sialfr sialfom mer, a √æeim mei√æi, er mangi veit, hvers hann af r√≥tom renn. Vi√∞ hleifi mic seldo ne vi√æ h√≥rnigi, nysta ec ni√ær, nam ec vp rvÃÅnar, «´pandi nam, fƒôll ec aptr √æatan.\\" I know that I hung on a windy tree nine long nights, wounded with a spear, dedicated to Odin, myself to myself, on that tree of which no man knows from where its roots run. No bread did they give me nor a drink from a horn, downwards I peered; I took up the runes, screaming I took them, then I fell back from there.Larrington, Carolyne. (Trans.) (1999) The Poetic Edda, p. 34. Oxford World's Classics The \\"windy tree\\" from which the victim hangs is often identified with the world tree Yggdrasil by commentators. The entire scene, the sacrifice of a god to himself, the execution method by hanging the victim on a tree, and the wound inflicted on the victim by a spear, is often compared to the crucifixion of Christ as narrated in the gospels. The parallelism of Odin and Christ during the period of open co- existence of Christianity and Norse paganism in Scandinavia (the 9th to 12th centuries, corresponding with the assumed horizon of the poem's composition) is also evident from other sources. To what extent this parallelism is an incidental similarity of the mode of human sacrifice offered to Odin and the crucifixion, and to what extent a Pagan influence on Christianity, or vice versa, may have occurred, is a complex question on which scholarly opinions vary.a sketch of the problem is given by Kimberley Christine Patton, Religion of the gods: ritual, paradox, and reflexivity Oxford University, , chapter 7 \\"Myself to Myself: The Norse Odin and Divine Autosacrifice\\". =Lj√≥√∞atal= The last section, the Lj√≥√∞atal enumerates eighteen songs (lj√≥√∞), sometimes called \\"charms\\", prefaced with (stanza 147): \\"Lio√æ ec √æÍúπ kann, er kannat √æio√∞ans k√≥na oc mannzcis mÍúπgr\\" The songs I know that king's wives know not Nor men that are sons of men. The songs themselves are not given, just their application or effect described. They are explicitly counted from \\"the first\\" in stanza 147, and \\"a second\\" to \\"an eighteenth\\" in stanzas 148 to 165, given in Roman numerals in the manuscript.Bellows separates the \\"seventeenth\\" item into stanzas 163 and 164. There is a gap in stanza 163, and some editors have also combined 163 and 164 into a single stanza. There is no explicit mention of runes or runic magic in the Lj√≥√∞atal excepting in the twelfth song (stanza 158), which takes up the motif of Odin hanging on the tree and its association with runes: \\"sva ec rist oc i rvÃÅnom f√°c\\" So do I write and color the runes Nevertheless, because of the R√∫natal preceding the list, modern commentators sometimes reinterpret the Lj√≥√∞atal as referring to runes, specifically with the sixteen letters of the Younger Futhark. M√ºllenhoff takes the original Lj√≥√∞atal to have ended with stanza 161, with the final three songs (16th to 18th) taken as late and obscure additions. Germanic Neopaganism The difference of sixteen runes of the Younger Futhark vs. eighteen charms in the Lj√≥√∞atal has notably motivated proponents of Germanic mysticism to expand the row by two extra runes. The best-known attempt to this effect are the Armanen runes by Guido von List (1902). Various proponents of Germanic Neopagan groups place an emphasis on H√°vam√°l as a source of a Norse pagan ethical code of conduct. The \\"Nine Noble Virtues\\", first compiled by Odinic Rite founder John \\"Stubba\\" Yeowell in the 1970s are \\"loosely based\\" on the H√°vam√°l. The Northvegr Foundation cites the H√°vam√°l among other Old Norse and Old English sources to illustrate \\"the ethical ideal of the Northern spiritual faith of Heithni.\\"Alfta Lothursdottir, Trulog and Sogumal, Northvegr (2006); Tr√∫l√∂g: Northern Truisms (northvegr.org) Sveinbj√∂rn Beinteinsson, leader of the Icelandic √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞, published his performance of a number of Eddaic poems, including the H√°vam√°l, chanted in r√≠mur style.\\"Edda\\", Current 93 (1991); [citation needed] Editions and translations *editio princeps: Peder Hansen Resen, Edda.

Sultan (; ', ) is a position with several historical meanings. Originally, it was an Arabic abstract noun meaning \\"strength\\", \\"authority\\", \\"rulership\\", derived from the verbal noun ', meaning \\"authority\\" or \\"power\\" (cognate with the Hebrew word \\"Shilton\\" ◊©◊ú◊ò◊ï◊ü which retained that meaning to the present). Later, it came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty in practical terms (i.e., the lack of dependence on any higher ruler), albeit without claiming the overall caliphate, or to refer to a powerful governor of a province within the caliphate. The adjective form of the word is \\"sultanic\\",Sultanic - Define sultan at dictionary.com and the dynasty and lands ruled by a sultan are referred to as a sultanate ( '). The term is distinct from king ( '), despite both referring to a sovereign ruler. The use of \\"sultan\\" is restricted to Muslim countries, where the title carries religious significance, contrasting the more secular king, which is used in both Muslim and non-Muslim countries. In recent years, \\"sultan\\" has been gradually replaced by \\"king\\" by contemporary hereditary rulers who wish to emphasize their secular authority under the rule of law. A notable example is Morocco, whose monarch changed his title from sultan to king in 1957. Feminine forms As a feminine form of sultan, used by Westerners, is Sultana or Sultanah and this title has been used legally for some (not all) Muslim women monarchs and sultan's mothers and chief consorts. However, Turkish and Ottoman Turkish also uses sultan for imperial lady, as Turkish grammar--which is influenced by Persian grammar--uses the same words for both women and men. However, this styling misconstrues the roles of wives of sultans. In a similar usage, the wife of a German field marshal might be styled Frau Feldmarschall (similarly, in French, constructions of the type madame la mar√©chale are quite common). The female leaders in Muslim history are correctly known as \\"sultanas\\". However, the wife of the sultan in the Sultanate of Sulu is styled as the \\"panguian\\" while the sultan's chief wife in many sultanates of Indonesia and Malaysia are known as \\"permaisuri\\", \\"Tunku Ampuan\\", \\"Raja Perempuan\\", or \\"Tengku Ampuan\\". The queen consort in Brunei especially is known as Raja Isteri with the title of Pengiran Anak suffixed, should the queen consort also be a royal princess. Compound ruler titles Ottoman Sultan Mehmed IV attended by a eunuch and two pages. These are generally secondary titles, either lofty 'poetry' or with a message, e.g.: *Mani Sultan = Manney Sultan (meaning the \\"Pearl of Rulers\\" or \\"Honoured Monarch\\") - a subsidiary title, part of the full style of the Maharaja of Travancore * Sultan of Sultans - the sultanic equivalent of the style King of Kings * Certain secondary titles have a devout Islamic connotation; e.g., Sultan ul-Mujahidin as champion of jihad (to strive and to struggle in the name of Allah). * Sultanic Highness - a rare, hybrid western-Islamic honorific style exclusively used by the son, daughter-in-law and daughters of Sultan Hussein Kamel of Egypt (a British protectorate since 1914), who bore it with their primary titles of Prince ('; ) or Princess, after 11 October 1917. They enjoyed these titles for life, even after the Royal Rescript regulating the styles and titles of the Royal House following Egypt's independence in 1922, when the sons and daughters of the newly styled king (', considered a promotion) were granted the title Sahib(at) us-Sumuw al-Malaki, or Royal Highness.

Princely and aristocratic titles The Valide Sultan (Sultana mother) of the Ottoman Empire By the beginning of the 16th century, the title sultan was carried by both men and women of the Ottoman dynasty and was replacing other titles by which prominent members of the imperial family had been known (notably khatun for women and bey for men). This usage underlines the Ottoman conception of sovereign power as family prerogative. Western tradition knows the Ottoman ruler as \\"sultan\\", but Ottomans themselves used \\"padi≈üah\\" (emperor) or \\"h√ºnkar\\" to refer to their ruler. The emperor's formal title consisted of \\"sultan\\" together with \\"khan\\" (for example, Sultan Suleiman Khan). In formal address, the sultan's children were also entitled \\"sultan\\", with imperial princes (≈ûehzade) carrying the title before their given name, with imperial princesses carrying it after. Example, ≈ûehzade Sultan Mehmed and Mihrimah Sultan, son and daughter of Suleiman the Magnificent. Like imperial princesses, living mother and main consort of reigning sultan also carried the title after their given names, for example, Hafsa Sultan, Suleiman's mother and first valide sultan, and H√ºrrem Sultan, Suleiman's chief consort and first haseki sultan. The evolving usage of this title reflected power shifts among imperial women, especially between Sultanate of Women, as the position of main consort eroded over the course of 17th century, the main consort lost the title \\"sultan\\", which replaced by \\"kadin\\", a title related to the earlier \\"khatun\\". Henceforth, the mother of the reigning sultan was the only person of non imperial blood to carry the title \\"sultan\\". In Kazakh Khanate a Sultan was a lord from the ruling dynasty (a direct descendants of Genghis Khan) elected by clans, i.e. a kind of princes. The best of sultans was elected as khan by people at Kurultai. See :ru:–ö–∞–∑–∞—Ö—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å—É–ª—Ç–∞–Ω—ã Military rank In a number of post-caliphal states under Mongol or Turkic rule, there was a feudal type of military hierarchy. These administrations were often decimal (mainly in larger empires), using originally princely titles such as khan, malik, amir as mere rank denominations. In the Persian empire, the rank of sultan was roughly equivalent to that of a modern-day captain in the West; socially in the fifth- rank class, styled 'Ali Jah.

XXII no. 1 (1989) It was also adopted by the kings of Shirvan (a historical Iranian region in Transcaucasia) namely the Shirvanshahs. It was also used by Persianate societies such as the rulers and offspring of the Ottoman Empire (≈ûah and ≈ûeh), Mughal India, Bengal Sultanate, Gorkha, and Afghanistan. In Iran (and the Greater Iran region) the title was continuously used; rather than King in the European sense, each Iranian ruler regarded himself as the Shahanshah (, \\"King of Kings\\") or Padishah (, \\"Master King\\") of the Persian Empire. Etymology The word descends from Old Persian x≈°ƒÅyaŒ∏iya \\"king\\", which used to be considered a borrowing from Median,An introduction to Old Persian (p. 149). Prods Oktor Skj√¶rv√∏. Harvard University. 2003., as it was compared to Avestan x≈°aœëra-, \\"power\\" and \\"command\\", corresponding to Sanskrit (Old Indic) k·π£atra- (same meaning), from which k·π£atriya-, \\"warrior\\", is derived. Most recently, the form x≈°ƒÅyaŒ∏iya has been analyzed as a genuine, inherited Persian formation with the meaning 'pertaining to reigning, ruling'. This formation with the \\"origin\\" suffix -iya is derived from a deverbal abstract noun *x≈°ƒÅy-aŒ∏a- 'rule, ruling, Herrschaft, from the (Old Persian) verb x≈°ƒÅy- 'to rule, reign'. The full, Old Persian title of the Achaemenid rulers of the First Persian Empire was X≈°ƒÅyathiya X≈°ƒÅyathiyƒÅnƒÅm or ≈†ƒÅhe ≈†ƒÅhƒÅn, \\"King of Kings\\"Old Persian. Appendices, Glossaries, Indices & Transcriptions. Prods Oktor Skj√¶rv√∏. Harvard University. 2003. or \\"Emperor\\". This title has ancient Near Eastern or Mesopotamian precedents. The earliest attestation of such a title dates back to the Middle Assyrian period as ≈°ar ≈°arrƒÅni, in reference to the Assyrian ruler Tukulti-Ninurta I (1243‚Äì1207 BC). History Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Shahanshah of Iran from 1941 to 1979, was the last ruler to hold the title of shah. ≈†ƒÅh, or ≈†ƒÅhan≈°ƒÅh (King of Kings) to use the full-length term, was the title of the Persian emperors. It includes rulers of the first Persian Empire, the Achaemenid dynasty, who unified Persia in the sixth century BC, and created a vast intercontinental empire, as well as rulers of succeeding dynasties throughout history until the twentieth century and the Imperial House of Pahlavi. While in Western sources the Ottoman monarch is most often referred to as a Sultan, in Ottoman territory he was most often referred to as Padishah and several used the title Shah in their tughras. Their male offspring received the title of ≈ûehzade, or prince (literally, \\"offspring of the Shah\\", from Persian shahzadeh). The full title of the Achaemenid rulers was X≈°ƒÅyaŒ∏iya X≈°ƒÅyaŒ∏iyƒÅnƒÅm, literally \\"King of Kings\\" in Old Persian, corresponding to Middle Persian ≈†ƒÅhƒÅn ≈†ƒÅh, and Modern Persian (≈†ƒÅhan≈°ƒÅh).D. N. MacKenzie. A Concise Pahlavi Dictionary. Routledge Curzon, 2005. M. Mo‚Äôin. An Intermediate Persian Dictionary. Six Volumes. Amir Kabir Publications, Teheran, 1992. In Greek, this phrase was translated as (basileus t≈çn basil√©≈çn), \\"King of Kings\\", equivalent to \\"Emperor\\". Both terms were often shortened to their roots shah and basileus. In Western languages, Shah is often used as an imprecise rendering of ≈†ƒÅhan≈°ƒÅh. The term was first recorded in English in 1564 as a title for the King of Persia and with the spelling Shaw. For a long time, Europeans thought of Shah as a particular royal title rather than an imperial one, although the monarchs of Persia regarded themselves as emperors of the Persian Empire (later the Empire of Iran). The European opinion changed in the Napoleonic era, when Persia was an ally of the Western powers eager to make the Ottoman Sultan release his hold on various (mainly Christian) European parts of the Ottoman Empire, and western (Christian) emperors had obtained the Ottoman acknowledgement that their western imperial styles were to be rendered in Turkish as padishah. In the twentieth century, the Shah of Persia, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, officially adopted the title ≈†ƒÅhan≈°ƒÅh and, in western languages, the rendering Emperor. He also styled his wife ShahbƒÅnu (\\"Empress\\"). Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was the last Shah, as the Iranian monarchy was abolished after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Ruler styles * From the reign of Ashot III (952/53‚Äì77), the Bagratid kings of Armenia used the title shahanshah, meaning \\"king of kings\\".Tim Greenwood, Emergence of the Bagratuni Kingdoms, p. 52, in Armenian Kars and Ani, Richard Hovannisian, ed. * The title Padishah (Great King) was adopted from the Iranians by the Ottomans and by various other monarchs claiming imperial rank, such as the Mughals that established their dynasty in the Indian subcontinent. * Another subsidiary style of the Ottoman and Mughal rulers was Shah-i-Alam Panah, meaning \\"King, refuge of the world\\". * The Shah- Armens (\\"Kings of Armenia\\", sometimes known as Ahlahshahs), used the title ShƒÅh-i Arman (lit. \\"Shah of Armenia\\").Clifford Edmund Bosworth \\"The New Islamic Dynasties: A Chronological and Genealogical Manual\\". \\"The ShƒÅh-i Armanids\\", p. 197. * Some monarchs were known by a contraction of the kingdom's name with shah, such as Khwarezmshah, ruler of the short-lived Muslim realm of Khwarezmia, or the Shirvanshah of the historical Iranian region of Shirvan (present-day Republic of Azerbaijan) * The kings of Georgia called themselves shahanshah alongside their other titles. Georgian title mepetmepe (also meaning King of Kings [Mepe-king in Georgian]) was also inspired by the shahanshah title. Shahzadeh Shahzadeh (Persian ÿ¥ÿßŸáÿ≤ÿßÿØŸá ≈†ƒÅhzƒÅdeh). In the realm of a shah (or a more lofty derived ruler style), a prince or princess of the royal blood was logically called shahzada as the term is derived from shah using the Persian patronymic suffix -zƒÅdeh or -zƒÅda, \\"born from\\" or \\"descendant of\\". However the precise full styles can differ in the court traditions of each shah's kingdom. This title was given to the princes of the Ottoman Empire (≈ûehzade, Ottoman Turkish: ÿ¥Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿØŸá) and was used by the princes of Islamic India (ShahzƒÅda, Urdu: ÿ¥€Åÿ≤ÿßÿØŸá, ) such as in the Mughal Empire. The Mughals and the Sultans of Delhi were not of Indian origin but of Mongol-Turkic origin and were heavily influenced by Persian culture, a continuation of traditions and habits ever since Persian language was first introduced into the region by Persianised Turkic and Afghan dynasties centuries earlier.Sigfried J. de Laet. History of Humanity: From the seventh to the sixteenth century UNESCO, 1994. p 734 Thus, in Oudh, only sons of the sovereign shah bahadur (see above) were by birth-right styled \\"Shahzada [personal title] Mirza [personal name] Bahadur\\", though this style could also be extended to individual grandsons and even further relatives. Other male descendants of the sovereign in the male line were merely styled \\"Mirza [personal name]\\" or \\"[personal name] Mirza\\". This could even apply to non- Muslim dynasties. For example, the younger sons of the ruling Sikh maharaja of Punjab were styled \\"Shahzada [personal name] Singh Bahadur\\". The corruption shahajada, \\"Shah's son\\", taken from the Mughal title Shahzada, is the usual princely title borne by the grandsons and male descendants of a Nepalese sovereign, in the male line of the Shah dynasty. For the heir to a \\"Persian- style\\" shah's royal throne, more specific titles were used, containing the key element Vali Ahad, usually in addition to shahzada, where his junior siblings enjoyed this style.Shahzada son of shah, Newsvine.com Other styles * Shahbanu (Persian , ≈†ahbƒÅn≈´): Persian term using the word shah and the Persian suffix -banu (\\"lady\\"): Empress, in modern times, the official title of Empress Farah Pahlavi. * Shahmam (Persian , \\"≈†ahmƒÅm\\") : Empress mother. * Shahdokht (Persian ≈†ƒÅhdoxt) is also another term derived from shah using the Persian patronymic suffix -dokht \\"daughter, female descendant\\", to address the Princess of the imperial households. * Shahpur (Persian ≈†ƒÅhpu:r) also been derived from shah using the archaic Persian suffix -pur \\"son, male descendant\\", to address the Prince. * ≈ûehzade (Ottoman Turkish), (): Ottoman Turkish termination for prince (lit; offspring of the Shah) derived from Persian Shahzadeh. * malik al-muluk \\"king of kings\\", an Arabic title used by the Iranian Buyids, a Persianized form of the Abbasid amir al-umara Related terms * Satrap, the term in Western languages for a governor of a Persian province, is a distortion of x≈°aŒ∏rapƒÅvan, literally \\"guardian of the realm\\", which derives from the word x≈°aŒ∏ra, an Old Persian word meaning \\"realm, province\\" and related etymologically to shah. * Maq'ad-i-Shah, (Persian Maq'ad-i-Shah), the phrase from which the name of Mogadishu is believed to be derived, which means \\"seat of the Shah\\", a reflection of the city's early Persian influence.David D.

The film is a heavily fictionalized and dramatized story of the friendship and sporting rivalry between two leading contemporary champion free divers in the 20th century: Jacques Mayol (played by Jean-Marc Barr) and Enzo Maiorca (renamed \\"Enzo Molinari\\" and played by Jean Reno), and Mayol's fictionalized relationship with his girlfriend Johana Baker (played by Rosanna Arquette). The film, which covers their childhood in 1965 Greece to their deaths in a 1980s Sicilian diving competition, is a cult- classic in the diving fraternity, and became one of France's most commercially successful films (although an adaptation for US release was a commercial failure in that country). President of France Jacques Chirac referred to the film in describing Mayol, after his death in 2001, as having been an enduring symbol for the \\"Big Blue\\" generation. The story was heavily adapted for cinema ‚Äî in real life, Mayol lived from 1927 to 2001 and Maiorca retired from diving to politics in the 1980s. Both set no-limits category deep diving records below 100 metres, and Mayol was indeed involved in scientific research into human aquatic potential, but neither reached 400 feet (122 metres) as portrayed in the film, and they were not direct competitors. Mayol himself was a screenwriter for the film, and Mayol's search for love, family, \\"wholeness\\" and the meaning of life and death, and the conflict and tension between his yearning for the deep and his relationship with his girlfriend also form part of the backdrop for the latter part of the film. Plot Two children, Jacques Mayol and Enzo Molinari, have grown up on the Greek island of Amorgos in the 1960s. Enzo challenges Jacques to collect a coin on the sea floor but Jacques refuses. Later, Jacques' father ‚Äî who harvests shellfish from the seabed using a pump-supplied air hose and helmet ‚Äî goes diving. His breathing apparatus and rope gets caught and punctured by rocks on the reef and weighed down by water, he drowns. Jacques and Enzo can do nothing but watch in horror as he is killed. By the 1980s, both are well known freedivers, swimmers who can remain underwater for great times and at great depths. Enzo is on Sicily now, where he rescues a trapped diver from a shipwreck. He is a world champion freediver with a brash and strong personality, and now wishes to find Jacques and persuade him to return to no limits freediving in order to prove he is still the better of the two, in a friendly sports rivalry. Jacques himself works extensively with scientific research as a human research subject, and with dolphins, and is temporarily participating in research into human physiology in the iced-over lakes of the Peruvian Andes, where his remarkable and dolphin-like bodily responses to cold water immersion are being recorded. Insurance broker Johana Baker visits the station for work purposes and is introduced to Jacques. She secretly falls in love with him. When she hears that Jacques will be at the World Diving Championships in Taormina, Sicily, she fabricates an insurance problem that requires her presence there, in order to meet him again. She and Jacques fall in love. However none of them realize the extent of Jacques' allurement with the depths. Jacques beats Enzo by 1 meter, and Enzo offers him a crystal dolphin as a gift, and a tape measure to show the small difference between Jacques' and Enzo's records. Johana goes back home to New York but is fired after her deception is discovered; she leaves New York and begins to live with Jacques. She hears the story that if one truly loves the deep sea, then a mermaid will appear at the depths of the sea, and will lead a diver to an enchanted place. At the next World Diving Championships, Enzo beats Jacques' record. The depths at which the divers are competing enter new territory and the dive doctor suggests they should cease competing, but the divers decide to continue. Jacques is asked to look at a local dolphinarium where a new dolphin has been placed, and where the dolphins are no longer performing; surmising that the new dolphin is homesick, the three of them break in at night to liberate the dolphin and transport her to the sea again. Back at the competition, other divers attempt to break Enzo's new record but all fail. Jacques then attempts his next dive and reaches 400 ft (122 m) breaking Enzo's world record. Angered by this, Enzo prepares to break Jacques' new world record. The doctor supervising the dive warns that the competitors must not go deeper - based upon Jacques' bodily reactions, at around 400 ft, conditions, and in particular the pressure, will become lethal and divers will be killed if they persist in attempting such depths. Enzo dismisses the advice and attempts the dive anyway, but is unable to make his way back to the surface. Jacques dives down to rescue him. Enzo, dying, tells Jacques that he was right and that it is better down there, and begs Jacques to help him back down to the depths, where he belongs. Jacques is grief- stricken and refuses, but after Enzo dies in his arms, finally honors his dying wish and takes Enzo's body back down to 400ft, leaving him to drift to the ocean floor. Jacques - himself suffering from cardiac arrest after the dive - is rescued and brought back to the surface by supervising scuba divers and requires his heart to be restarted with a defibrillator before being placed in medical quarters to recover. Jacques appears to be recovering from the diving accident, but later experiences a strange hallucinatory dream in which the ceiling collapses and the room fills with water, and he finds himself in the ocean depths surrounded by dolphins. Johana, who has just discovered she is pregnant, returns to check up on Jacques in the middle of the night, but finds him lying awake yet unresponsive in his bed with bloody ears and a bloody nose. Johana attempts to help him, but Jacques begins to get up and walk to the empty diving boat and gets suited up for one final dive. Desperately, Johana begs Jacques not to go, saying she is alive but whatever has happened at the depths is not, but he says he has to. She tells Jacques that she is pregnant, and sorrowfully begs him to stay, but finally understands he feels he must go. The two embrace and Johana breaks down crying. Jacques then places the release cord for the dive ballast in her hand, and - still sobbing - she pulls it, sending him down to the depths he loves. Jacques descends and floats for a brief moment staring into the darkness. A dolphin then appears and - dreamlike - Jacques lets go of his harness and swims away with it into the darkness. =Original and alternate (US) endings= The original ending was intentionally ambiguous, though considering the depth Jacques has swum to, it would seem he is unlikely to regain the surface alive, and he dies. In the American adaptation, the ending is extended with an additional scene: after swimming away with the dolphin, Jacques is returned to the surface.

In real life, the two were indeed champions and contemporaries. However, they did not directly compete, neither reached 400 feet, and neither died while diving. Mayol was indeed involved in scientific research into human aquatic potential, and was fascinated by dolphins, and was recorded as having a heartbeat that slowed from 60 to 27 beats per minute when diving. He held numerous world records, including dives to below 100 meters. After a bout of depression, he took his own life in 2001, long after the film's release. Maiorca (renamed as \\"Enzo Molinari\\" in the film) also set numerous depth records from 1960 to 1988, despite involuntarily retiring from the sport for over a decade between 1974 and 1986 after an outburst on TV cost him a competition ban. He entered politics in the 1990s, and became a member of the Italian Senate for a time. For many years, he resisted public showing of the film in Italy, as he considered it to caricature him poorly; after Mayol's death in 2001, he relented and accepted the showing of the film. Production Besson was initially unsure of whom to cast in the main role of Mayol. He initially offered the role to Christopher Lambert and Mickey Rourke and even considered himself for the role until someone suggested Jean-Marc Barr. Besson has a cameo appearance as one of the divers in the film. The Big Blue was the most financially successful French film of the 1980s, selling 9,193,873 tickets in France alone, and played in French theaters for a year. With its extensive underwater scenes and languid score (as with nearly all of Besson's films, the soundtrack was composed by √âric Serra), the film has been both praised as beautiful and serene, and in equal measure criticized as being too drawn out, overly reflective and introspective. While popular in Europe, the film was a commercial failure in North America. The American version was recut to include a simplified \\"happy\\" ending, and Serra's score was replaced with a soundtrack composed by Bill Conti. This version was only available on VHS and Laserdisc in the United States (both with 4x3 pan and scan transfers) and is currently out of print. The director later released a longer director's cut on DVD, featuring the original ending and an extended version of the Serra score. Much of the film was shot on the Greek island of Amorgos, where Agia Anna and the monastery of Panagia Hozoviotissa can be seen. The film was dedicated to his daughter Juliette Besson, who required surgery after becoming ill during filming. =Filming locations= * Maisons-Laffitte (France), piscine municipale (opening scene in swimming pool) * Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States * Maganari, Ios, Cyclades, Greece * Agia Anna, Amorgos, Cyclades, Greece * Kalotaritissa bay, Amorgos, Cyclades, Greece * Marineland (Antibes), Antibes, Alpes-Maritimes, France * Peru * St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands * Taormina, Messina, Sicily, Italy. * Lac du Chardonnet, Tignes, Savoie, Rh√¥ne- Alpes, France (Lake diving under the ice in Peru) * C√°diz, Spain Reception The film was met with positive reviews in Europe, where it was described as \\"one of the most significant cult movies of the 1980s\\" by French Cinema historian R√©mi Lanzoni,French Cinema: From Its Beginnings to the Present, R√©mi Fournier Lanzoni, p.342-344. who described it as \\"ooz[ing] with a sensuous beauty unlike any other film at the time\\".

The French Blu-ray release contains only the Director's Cut of the film but with a French DTS-MA 5.1 soundtrack and is supplemented with Besson's Atlantis documentary on Blu-ray as well. In popular culture A poster for the film can be seen in the photo studio in the 1992 South Korean film The Moon Is... the Sun's Dream. In the 2009 Japanese anime series Eden of the East, Akira plays the film in his villa's cinema for Saki, who was a big fan. The title of the episode, \\"On the Night of the Late Show\\", is a reference to this scene.

Chinese characters (pronounced hanzi in Mandarin, kanji in Japanese, hanja in Korean and H√°n t·ª± in Vietnamese) are generally logograms, as are many hieroglyphic and cuneiform characters. The use of logograms in writing is called logography, and a writing system that is based on logograms is called a logography or logographic system. All known logographies have some phonetic component, generally based on the rebus principle. Alphabets and syllabaries are distinct from logographies in that they use individual written characters to represent sounds directly. Such characters are called phonograms in linguistics. Unlike logograms, phonograms do not have any inherent meaning. Writing language in this way is called phonemic writing or orthographic writing.  Logographic systems  Logographic systems include the earliest writing systems; the first historical civilizations of the Near East, Africa, China, and Central America used some form of logographic writing. A purely logographic script would be impractical for most languages, and none is known, except for one devised for the artificial language Toki Pona, which is a purposely limited language with only 120 morphemes. All logographic scripts ever used for natural languages rely on the rebus principle to extend a relatively limited set of logograms: A subset of characters is used for their phonetic values, either consonantal or syllabic. The term logosyllabary is used to emphasize the partially phonetic nature of these scripts when the phonetic domain is the syllable. In both Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs and in Chinese, there has been the additional development of determinatives, which are combined with logograms to narrow down their possible meaning. In Chinese, they are fused with logographic elements used phonetically; such \\"radical and phonetic\\" characters make up the bulk of the script. Both languages relegated the active use of rebus to the spelling of foreign and dialectical words. Logographic writing systems include: * Logoconsonantal scripts *: These are scripts in which the graphemes may be extended phonetically according to the consonants of the words they represent, ignoring the vowels. For example, Egyptian G38 was used to write both s»ù 'duck' and s»ù 'son', though it is likely that these words were not pronounced the same except for their consonants. The primary examples of logoconsonantal scripts are: ** Hieroglyphs, hieratic, and demotic: Ancient Egyptian * Logosyllabic scripts *: These are scripts in which the graphemes represent morphemes, often polysyllabic morphemes, but when extended phonetically represent single syllables. They include: ** Anatolian hieroglyphs: Luwian ** Cuneiform: Sumerian, Akkadian, other Semitic languages, Elamite, Hittite, Luwian, Hurrian, and Urartian ** Maya glyphs: Chorti, Yucatec, and other Classic Maya languages ** Han characters: Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Zhuang ** Derivatives of Han characters: *** Ch·ªØ n√¥m: Vietnam *** Dongba script written with Geba script: Naxi language (Dongba itself is pictographic) *** Jurchen script: Jurchen *** Khitan large script: Khitan *** Sawndip: Zhuang languages *** Shui script: Shui language *** Tangut script: Tangut language *** Yi (classical): various Yi languages None of these systems is purely logographic. This can be illustrated with Chinese. Not all Chinese characters represent morphemes: some morphemes are composed of more than one character. For example, the Chinese word for spider, zhƒ´zh≈´, was created by fusing the rebus zhƒ´zh≈´ (literally 'know cinnabar') with the \\"bug\\" determinative . Neither * zhƒ´ nor * zh≈´ can be used separately (except to stand in for in poetry). In Archaic Chinese, one can find the reverse: a single character representing more than one morpheme. An example is Archaic Chinese Áéã hjwangs, a combination of a morpheme hjwang meaning king (coincidentally also written ) and a suffix pronounced /s/. (The suffix is preserved in the modern falling tone.) In modern Mandarin, bimorphemic syllables are always written with two characters, for example huƒÅr 'flower [diminutive]'. A peculiar system of logograms developed within the Pahlavi scripts (developed from the Aramaic abjad) used to write Middle Persian during much of the Sassanid period; the logograms were composed of letters that spelled out the word in Aramaic but were pronounced as in Persian (for instance, the combination ' would be pronounced \\"shah\\"). These logograms, called (a form of heterograms), were dispensed with altogether after the Arab conquest of Persia and the adoption of a variant of the Arabic alphabet. Logograms are used in modern shorthand to represent common words. In addition, the numerals and mathematical symbols are logograms ‚Äì 1 'one', 2 'two', + 'plus', = 'equals', and so on. In English, the ampersand & is used for 'and' and (as in many languages) for Latin ' (as in &c; for '), % for 'percent' ('per cent'), # for 'number' (or 'pound', among other meanings), ¬ß for 'section', $ for 'dollar', ‚Ç¨ for 'euro', ¬£ for 'pound', ¬∞ for 'degree', @ for 'at', and so on.  Semantic and phonetic dimensions  All historical logographic systems include a phonetic dimension, as it is impractical to have a separate basic character for every word or morpheme in a language. In some cases, such as cuneiform as it was used for Akkadian, the vast majority of glyphs are used for their sound values rather than logographically. Many logographic systems also have a semantic/ideographic component, called \\"determinatives\\" in the case of Egyptian and \\"radicals\\" in the case of Chinese. Typical Egyptian usage was to augment a logogram, which may potentially represent several words with different pronunciations, with a determinate to narrow down the meaning, and a phonetic component to specify the pronunciation. In the case of Chinese, the vast majority of characters are a fixed combination of a radical that indicates its nominal category, plus a phonetic to give an idea of the pronunciation. The Mayan system used logograms with phonetic complements like the Egyptian, while lacking ideographic components.  Chinese characters  Chinese scholars have traditionally classified the Chinese characters (h√†nz√¨) into six types by etymology. The first two types are \\"single-body\\", meaning that the character was created independently of other characters. \\"Single-body\\" pictograms and ideograms make up only a small proportion of Chinese logograms. More productive for the Chinese script were the two \\"compound\\" methods, i.e. the character was created from assembling different characters. Despite being called \\"compounds\\", these logograms are still single characters, and are written to take up the same amount of space as any other logogram. The final two types are methods in the usage of characters rather than the formation of characters themselves. Excerpt from a 1436 primer on Chinese characters # The first type, and the type most often associated with Chinese writing, are pictograms, which are pictorial representations of the morpheme represented, e.g. for 'mountain'. # The second type are the ideograms that attempt to visualize abstract concepts, such as 'up' and 'down'. Also considered ideograms are pictograms with an ideographic indicator; for instance, is a pictogram meaning 'knife', while is an ideogram meaning 'blade'. # Radical-radical compounds, in which each element of the character (called radical) hints at the meaning. For example, 'rest' is composed of the characters for 'person' () and 'tree' (), with the intended idea of someone leaning against a tree, i.e. resting. # Radical- phonetic compounds, in which one component (the radical) indicates the general meaning of the character, and the other (the phonetic) hints at the pronunciation. An example is (li√°ng), where the phonetic li√°ng indicates the pronunciation of the character and the radical ('wood') indicates its meaning of 'supporting beam'. Characters of this type constitute around 90% of Chinese logograms. # Changed-annotation characters are characters which were originally the same character but have bifurcated through orthographic and often semantic drift. For instance, can mean both 'music' (yu√®) and 'pleasure' (l√®). # Improvisational characters (lit. 'improvised-borrowed-words') come into use when a native spoken word has no corresponding character, and hence another character with the same or a similar sound (and often a close meaning) is \\"borrowed\\"; occasionally, the new meaning can supplant the old meaning. For example, used to be a pictographic word meaning 'nose', but was borrowed to mean 'self', and is now used almost exclusively to mean the latter; the original meaning survives only in stock phrases and more archaic compounds. Because of their derivational process, the entire set of Japanese kana can be considered to be of this type of character, hence the name kana. Example: Japanese ; is a simplified form of Chinese used in Korea and Japan, and is the Chinese name for this type. The most productive method of Chinese writing, the radical-phonetic, was made possible by ignoring certain distinctions in the phonetic system of syllables. In Old Chinese, post-final ending consonants and were typically ignored; these developed into tones in Middle Chinese, which were likewise ignored when new characters were created. Also ignored were differences in aspiration (between aspirated vs. unaspirated obstruents, and voiced vs. unvoiced sonorants); the Old Chinese difference between type-A and type-B syllables (often described as presence vs. absence of palatalization or pharyngealization); and sometimes, voicing of initial obstruents and/or the presence of a medial after the initial consonant. In earlier times, greater phonetic freedom was generally allowed. During Middle Chinese times, newly created characters tended to match pronunciation exactly, other than the tone ‚Äì often by using as the phonetic component a character that itself is a radical-phonetic compound. Due to the long period of language evolution, such component \\"hints\\" within characters as provided by the radical-phonetic compounds are sometimes useless and may be misleading in modern usage. As an example, based on 'each', pronounced mƒõi in Standard Mandarin, are the characters 'to humiliate', 'to regret', and 'sea', pronounced respectively w«î, hu«ê, and h«éi in Mandarin. Three of these characters were pronounced very similarly in Old Chinese ‚Äì (ÊØè), } (ÊÇî), and } (Êµ∑) according to a recent reconstruction by William H. Baxter and Laurent Sagart ‚Äì but sound changes in the intervening 3,000 years or so (including two different dialectal developments, in the case of the last two characters) have resulted in radically different pronunciations. = Chinese characters used in Japanese and Korean = Within the context of the Chinese language, Chinese characters (known as hanzi) by and large represent words and morphemes rather than pure ideas; however, the adoption of Chinese characters by the Japanese and Korean languages (where they are known as kanji and hanja, respectively) have resulted in some complications to this picture. Many Chinese words, composed of Chinese morphemes, were borrowed into Japanese and Korean together with their character representations; in this case, the morphemes and characters were borrowed together. In other cases, however, characters were borrowed to represent native Japanese and Korean morphemes, on the basis of meaning alone. As a result, a single character can end up representing multiple morphemes of similar meaning but with different origins across several languages. Because of this, kanji and hanja are sometimes described as morphographic writing systems. = Differences in processing of logographic and phonologic languages = Because much research on language processing has centered on English and other alphabet languages, many theories of language processing have stressed the role of phonology (see for instance WEAVER++) in producing speech. Contrasting logographic languages, where a single character is represented phonetically and ideographically, with phonetic languages has yielded insights into how different languages rely on different processing mechanisms. Studies on the processing of logographic languages have amongst other things looked at neurobiological differences in processing, with one area of particular interest being hemispheric lateralization. Since logographic languages are more closely associated with images than alphabet languages, several researchers have hypothesized that right-side activation should be more prominent in logographic languages. Although some studies have yielded results consistent with this hypothesis there are too many contrasting results to make any final conclusions about the role of hemispheric lateralization in orthographic versus phonetic languages. Another topic that has been given some attention is differences in processing of homophones. Verdonschot et al. examined differences in the time it took to read a homophone out loud when a picture that was either related or unrelated to a homophonic character was presented before the character. Both Japanese and Chinese homophones were examined. Whereas word production of alphabetic languages (such as English) has shown a relatively robust immunity to the effect of context stimuli, Verdschot et al. found that Japanese homophones seem particularly sensitive to these types of effects. Specifically, reaction times were shorter when participants were presented with a phonologically related picture before being asked to read a target character out loud. An example of a phonologically related stimulus from the study would be for instance when participants were presented with a picture of an elephant, which is pronounced zou in Japanese, before being presented with the Chinese character , which is also read zou. No effect of phonologically related context pictures were found for the reaction times for reading Chinese words. A comparison of the logographic languages Japanese and Chinese is interesting because whereas the Japanese language consists of more than 60% homographic heterophones (characters that can be read two or more different ways), most Chinese characters only have one reading. Because both languages are logographic, the difference in latency in reading aloud Japanese and Chinese due to context effects cannot be ascribed to the logographic nature of the languages. Instead, the authors hypothesize that the difference in latency times is due to additional processing costs in Japanese, where the reader cannot rely solely on a direct orthography-to- phonology route, but information on a lexical-syntactical level must also be accessed in order to choose the correct pronunciation. This hypothesis is confirmed by studies finding that Japanese Alzheimer's disease patients whose comprehension of characters had deteriorated still could read the words out loud with no particular difficulty. Studies contrasting the processing of English and Chinese homophones in lexical decision tasks have found an advantage for homophone processing in Chinese, and a disadvantage for processing homophones in English.See Hino et al. (2012) for a brief review of the literature. The processing disadvantage in English is usually described in terms of the relative lack of homophones in the English language. When a homophonic word is encountered, the phonological representation of that word is first activated. However, since this is an ambiguous stimulus, a matching at the orthographic/lexical (\\"mental dictionary\\") level is necessary before the stimulus can be disambiguated, and the correct pronunciation can be chosen. In contrast, in a language (such as Chinese) where many characters with the same reading exists, it is hypothesized that the person reading the character will be more familiar with homophones, and that this familiarity will aid the processing of the character, and the subsequent selection of the correct pronunciation, leading to shorter reaction times when attending to the stimulus. In an attempt to better understand homophony effects on processing, Hino et al. conducted a series of experiments using Japanese as their target language. While controlling for familiarity, they found a processing advantage for homophones over non-homophones in Japanese, similar to what has previously been found in Chinese. The researchers also tested whether orthographically similar homophones would yield a disadvantage in processing, as has been the case with English homophones, Citing Ferrand & Grainger 2003, Haigh & Jared 2004. but found no evidence for this. It is evident that there is a difference in how homophones are processed in logographic and alphabetic languages, but whether the advantage for processing of homophones in the logographic languages Japanese and Chinese is due to the logographic nature of the scripts, or if it merely reflects an advantage for languages with more homophones regardless of script nature, remains to be seen.  Advantages and disadvantages  = Separating writing and pronunciation = The main difference between logograms and other writing systems is that the graphemes are not linked directly to their pronunciation. An advantage of this separation is that understanding of the pronunciation or language of the writer is unnecessary, e.g. 1 is understood regardless of whether it be called one, ichi or wƒÅ·∏•id by its reader. Likewise, people speaking different varieties of Chinese may not understand each other in speaking, but may do so to a significant extent in writing even if they do not write in standard Chinese. Therefore, in China, Vietnam, Korea, and Japan before modern times, communication by writing () was the norm of East Asian international trade and diplomacy using Classical chinese. This separation, however, also has the great disadvantage of requiring the memorization of the logograms when learning to read and write, separately from the pronunciation. Though not from an inherent feature of logograms but due to its unique history of development, Japanese has the added complication that almost every logogram has more than one pronunciation. Conversely, a phonetic character set is written precisely as it is spoken, but with the disadvantage that slight pronunciation differences introduce ambiguities. Many alphabetic systems such as those of Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, and Finnish make the practical compromise of standardizing how words are written while maintaining a nearly one-to-one relation between characters and sounds. Both English and French orthography are more complicated than that; character combinations are often pronounced in multiple ways, usually depending on their history. Hangul, the Korean language's writing system, is an example of an alphabetic script that was designed to replace the logogrammatic hanja in order to increase literacy. The latter is now rarely used in Korea, but retains some currency in South Korea, sometimes in combination with hangul. According to government-commissioned research, the most commonly used 3,500 characters listed in the People's Republic of China's \\"Chart of Common Characters of Modern Chinese\\" (, Xi√†nd√†i H√†ny«î Ch√°ngy√≤ngz√¨ Bi«éo) cover 99.48% of a two-million-word sample. As for the case of traditional Chinese characters, 4,808 characters are listed in the \\"Chart of Standard Forms of Common National Characters\\" () by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China, while 4,759 in the \\"Soengjung Zi Zijing Biu\\" () by the Education and Manpower Bureau of Hong Kong, both of which are intended to be taught during elementary and junior secondary education. Education after elementary school includes not as many new characters as new words, which are mostly combinations of two or more already learned characters. = Characters in information technology = Inputting complex characters can be cumbersome on electronic devices due to a practical limitation in the number of input keys. There exist various input methods for entering logograms, either by breaking them up into their constituent parts such as with the Cangjie and Wubi methods of typing Chinese, or using phonetic systems such as Bopomofo or Pinyin where the word is entered as pronounced and then selected from a list of logograms matching it. While the former method is (linearly) faster, it is more difficult to learn. With the Chinese alphabet system however, the strokes forming the logogram are typed as they are normally written, and the corresponding logogram is then entered. Also due to the number of glyphs, in programming and computing in general, more memory is needed to store each grapheme, as the character set is larger. As a comparison, ISO 8859 requires only one byte for each grapheme, while the Basic Multilingual Plane encoded in UTF-8 requires up to three bytes. On the other hand, English words, for example, average five characters and a space per word and thus need six bytes for every word. Since many logograms contain more than one grapheme, it is not clear which is more memory-efficient. Variable-width encodings allow a unified character encoding standard such as Unicode to use only the bytes necessary to represent a character, reducing the overhead that results merging large character sets with smaller ones.

He made optical glass and achromatic telescope objective lenses, invented the spectroscope, and developed diffraction grating. In 1814, he discovered and studied the dark absorption lines in the spectrum of the sun now known as Fraunhofer lines. The German research organization Fraunhofer Society is named after him and is Europe's biggest Society for the Advancement of Applied Research. Biography Joseph Fraunhofer was the 11th child, born in Straubing, in the Electorate of Bavaria, to Franz Xaver Fraunhofer and Maria Anna Frohlich. He was orphaned at the age of 11 and started working as an apprentice to a harsh glassmaker named Philipp Anton Weichelsberger. In 1801, the workshop in which he was working collapsed, and he was buried in the rubble. The rescue operation was led by Prince-Elector Maximilian Joseph. The prince entered Fraunhofer's life, providing him with books and forcing his employer to allow the young Fraunhofer time to study. Joseph Utzschneider was also at the site of the disaster, and would also become a benefactor to Fraunhofer. With the money given to him by the prince upon his rescue and the support he received from Utzschneider, Fraunhofer was able to continue his education alongside his practical training.Ralf Kern: Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit. Band 4: Perfektion von Optik und Mechanik. Cologne, 2010. 355‚Äì356. In 1806, Utzschneider and Georg von Reichenbach brought Fraunhofer into their Institute at Benediktbeuern, a secularised Benedictine monastery devoted to glassmaking. There he discovered how to make fine optical glass and invented precise methods for measuring optical dispersion. It was at the Institute that Fraunhofer met Pierre Louis Guinand, a Swiss glass technician, who instructed Fraunhofer in glassmaking at Utzschneider's behest. By 1809, the mechanical part of the Optical Institute was chiefly under Fraunhofer's direction, and Fraunhofer became one of the members of the firm that same year. In 1814, Guinand left the firm, as did Reichenbach. Guinand would later become a partner with Fraunhofer in the firm, and the name was changed to Utzschneider- und-Fraunhofer. During 1818, Fraunhofer became the director of the Optical Institute. Due to the fine optical instruments developed by Fraunhofer, Bavaria overtook England as the center of the optics industry. Even the likes of Michael Faraday were unable to produce glass that could rival Fraunhofer. His illustrious career eventually earned him an honorary doctorate from the University of Erlangen in 1822. In 1824, Fraunhofer was appointed a Knight of the Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown by King Maximilian I, through which he was raised into personal nobility (with the title \\"Ritter von\\", i.e. knight). The same year, he was also made an honorary citizen of Munich. Like many glassmakers of his era, he was poisoned by heavy metal vapors, resulting in his premature death. Fraunhofer died in 1826 at the age of 39. His most valuable glassmaking recipes are thought to have gone to the grave with him.  Invention and scientific research  Fraunhofer demonstrating the spectroscope. One of the most difficult operations of practical optics during the time period of Fraunhofer's life was accurately polishing the spherical surfaces of large object glasses. Fraunhofer invented the machine which rendered the surface more accurately than conventional grinding. He also invented other grinding and polishing machines and introduced many improvements into the manufacture of the different kinds of glass used for optical instruments, which he always found to have flaws and irregularities of various sorts. In 1811, he constructed a new kind of furnace, and during his second melting session when he melted a large quantity of glass, he found that he could produce flint glass, which, when taken from the bottom of a vessel containing roughly 224 pounds of glass, had the same refractive power as glass taken from the surface. He found that English crown glass and German table glass both contained defects which tended to cause irregular refraction. In the thicker and larger glasses, there would be even more of such defects, so that in larger telescopes this kind of glass would not be fit for objective lenses. Fraunhofer accordingly made his own crown glass. It was thought that the accurate determination of power for a given medium to refract rays of light and separate the different colors which they contain was impeded by the absence of precise boundaries between the colors of the spectrum, making it difficult to accurately measure the angle of refraction. To address this limitation, Fraunhofer performed a series of experiments for the purpose of producing homogeneous light artificially, and unable to effect his object in a direct way, he did so by means of lamps and prisms. = Discovery of dark absorption lines = DBP's stamp on 200th anniversary of birthday of Fraunhofer) By 1814, Fraunhofer had invented the modern spectroscope. In the course of his experiments, he discovered a bright fixed line which appears in the orange color of the spectrum when it is produced by the light of fire. This line enabled him afterward to determine the absolute power of refraction in different substances. Experiments to ascertain whether the solar spectrum contained the same bright line in orange as the line produced by the orange of fire light led him to the discovery of 574 dark fixed lines in the solar spectrum. Today, millions of such fixed absorption lines are now known.See: * Joseph Fraunhofer (1814‚Äì1815) \\"Bestimmung des Brechungs- und des Farben- Zerstreuungs ‚Äì Verm√∂gens verschiedener Glasarten, in Bezug auf die Vervollkommnung achromatischer Fernr√∂hre\\" (Determination of the refractive and color-dispersing power of different types of glass, in relation to the improvement of achromatic telescopes), Denkschriften der K√∂niglichen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu M√ºnchen (Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Munich), 5: 193‚Äì226; see especially pages 202‚Äì205 and the plate following page 226. * Reprinted, with additional findings and notes, in: Joseph Fraunhofer (1817) \\"Bestimmung des Brechungs- und des Farben-Zerstreuungs ‚Äì Verm√∂gens verschiedener Glasarten, in Bezug auf die Vervollkommnung achromatischer Fernr√∂hre\\" (Determination of the refractive and color-dispersing power of different types of glass, in relation to the improvement of achromatic telescopes), Annalen der Physik, 56: 264‚Äì313; see especially pages 278‚Äì286. Continuing to investigate, Fraunhofer detected dark lines also appearing in the spectra of several bright stars, but in slightly different arrangements. He ruled out the possibility that the lines were produced as the light passes through the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. If that were the case they would not appear in different arrangements. He concluded that the lines originate in the nature of the stars and sun and carry information about the source of light, regardless of how far away that source is. He found that the spectra of Sirius and other first-magnitude stars differed from the sun and from each other, thus founding stellar spectroscopy.Fraunhofer (1814‚Äì1815), pages 220‚Äì221: Original: Ich habe auch mit derselben Vorrichtung Versuche mit dem Lichte einiger Fixsterne erster Gr√∂sse gemachte. Da aber das Licht dieser Sterne noch vielmal schw√§cher ist, als das der Venus, so ist nat√ºrlich auch die Helligkeit des Farbenbildes vielmal geringer. Demohngeachtet habe ich, ohne T√§uschung, im Farbenbilde vom Lichte des Sirius drey breite Streifen gesehen, die mit jenen vom Sonnenlichte keine Aehnlichkeit zu haben scheinen; einer dieser Streifen ist im Gr√ºnen, und zwey im Blauen. Auch im Farbenbilde vom Lichte anderer Fixsterne erster Gr√∂sse erkennt man Streifen; doch scheinen diese Sterne, in Beziehung auf die Streifen, unter sich verschieden zu seyn. '' Translation: With the same device [i.e., spectroscope], I've also made some experiments on the light of some stars of the first magnitude. Since the light of these stars is many times weaker than that of Venus, so naturally, the brightness of the spectrum is also many times less. Notwithstanding, I have seen ‚Äì without any illusion ‚Äì three broad stripes in the spectrum of Sirius, which seem to have no similarity to those of sunlight; one of these stripes is in the green, and two in the blue. Also, in the spectrum of the light of other fixed stars of the first magnitude, one detects stripes; yet these stars, in regard to the stripes, seem to differ among themselves. These dark fixed lines were later shown to be atomic absorption lines, as explained by Kirchhoff and Bunsen in 1859.See: * Gustav Kirchhoff (1859) \\"Ueber die Fraunhofer'schen Linien\\" (On Fraunhofer's lines), Monatsbericht der K√∂niglichen Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin (Monthly Report of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin), 662‚Äì665. * Gustav Kirchhoff (1859) \\"Ueber das Sonnenspektrum\\" (On the sun's spectrum), Verhandlungen des naturhistorisch- medizinischen Vereins zu Heidelberg (Proceedings of the Natural History / Medical Association in Heidelberg), 1 (7): 251‚Äì255. These lines are still called Fraunhofer lines in his honor; his discovery had gone far beyond the half-dozen apparent divisions in the solar spectrum that had previously been noted by Wollaston in 1802.William Hyde Wollaston (1802) \\"A method of examining refractive and dispersive powers, by prismatic reflection,\\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, 92: 365‚Äì380; see especially p. 378. = Invention of optical instruments = Fraunhofer also developed a diffraction grating in 1821, after James Gregory discovered the phenomenon of diffraction grating and after the American astronomer David Rittenhouse invented the first manmade diffraction grating in 1785.See: * Frauhofer.

Fraunhofer was the first who used a diffraction grating to obtain line spectra and the first who measured the wavelengths of spectral lines with a diffraction grating. Ultimately, however, his primary passion was still practical optics; he once wrote that \\"In all my experiments I could, owing to lack of time, pay attention to only those matters which appeared to have a bearing upon practical optics\\".Prismatic and Diffraction Spectra: Memoirs (1899) Tr. & Ed.

The Graeae took the form of old, grey-haired women. Their age was so great that a human childhood for them was hardly conceivable. In Theogony, however, Hesiod describes the Graeae as being \\"fair-cheeked\\". In Prometheus Bound, the Graeae are described as being swan-shaped (\\"Œ∫œÖŒ∫ŒΩœåŒºŒøœÅœÜŒøŒπ\\")Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound, 795.

A native of Uzel in Brittany, and the son of a notary, in 1872 Bienven√ºe graduated from the √âcole Polytechnique as a civil engineer and the same year he began working for the Department of Bridges and Roads at Alen√ßon. His first assignment was the construction of new railway lines in the Mayenne area, in the course of which his left arm had to be amputated after being crushed in a construction accident. In 1886, Bienven√ºe moved on to Paris to design and supervise the construction of aqueducts for the city, drawing water from the Aube and Loire Rivers. Next, he built a cable railway near the Place de la R√©publique and created the park of Buttes-Chaumont. In 1891, he was appointed as Engineer-in-Chief for Bridges and Roads, the most prestigious engineering job in France. Paris city officials selected Bienven√ºe to become chief engineer for the Paris M√©tro in 1896. He designed a special way of building new tunnels which allowed the swift repaving of the roads above; this involved (among other things) building the crown of the tunnel first and the floor last, the reverse of the usual method at that time. Bienven√ºe has the credit for the mostly swift and relatively uneventful construction of the M√©tro through the difficult and heterogenous Parisian soils and rocks. He came up with the idea of freezing wet and unstable soil in order to permit the drilling of tunnels. He was to supervise the Paris Metro construction for more than three decades, finally retiring on 6 December 1932. Bienven√ºe's construction of the M√©tro was widely praised and has been described admiringly as a work \\"worthy of the Romans\\". He eventually accumulated many honors for his engineering accomplishments, including the Grand Prix Berger of the Academy of Arts and Sciences (1909) and the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor (1929). On 30 June 1933, the Avenue du Maine station on the Metro was renamed Bienven√ºe in his honor. The naming ceremony took place in his presence; there was a last-minute scramble to repaint the station's new nameboards when it was discovered that the unusual diaeresis in his name had been omitted, making it the French word for \\"welcome\\". In 1942 the station was linked to the adjacent Montparnasse station, forming a single station named Montparnasse-Bienven√ºe. Bienven√ºe was buried in 1936 at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, Paris. A high school in C√¥tes-d'Armor commune in Brittany is named after Bienven√ºe, Lyc√©e Fulgence Bienven√ºe de Loudeac, part of the Acad√©mie de Rennes.http://www.lycee-fulgence-bienvenue-loudeac.ac-rennes.fr/ See also *Edmond Huet References * External links * Category:1852 births Category:1936 deaths Category:People from Brittany Category:French civil engineers Category:√âcole Polytechnique alumni Category:√âcole des Ponts ParisTech alumni Category:Corps des ponts Category:Burials at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery Category:French amputees Category:Paris M√©tro Category:Grand Croix of the L√©gion d'honneur ","title":"Fulgence Bienven√ºe"},{"id":"64668","text":"The Phorcides or Phorcydes (\\"the daughters of Phorcys\\") may refer to: * The Phorcides, another name for the Graeae in Greek mythology * The Phorcides, a lost play about the Graeae by the 5th century BC Greek playwright Aeschylus ","title":"Phorcides"},{"id":"64669","text":"De Morgan's laws represented with Venn diagrams. In each case, the resultant set is the set of all points in any shade of blue. In propositional logic and Boolean algebra, De Morgan's lawsCopi and CohenMoore and Parker are a pair of transformation rules that are both valid rules of inference. They are named after Augustus De Morgan, a 19th-century British mathematician. The rules allow the expression of conjunctions and disjunctions purely in terms of each other via negation. The rules can be expressed in English as: :the negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations; and :the negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations; or :the complement of the union of two sets is the same as the intersection of their complements; and :the complement of the intersection of two sets is the same as the union of their complements. or :not (A or B) = not A and not B; and :not (A and B) = not A or not B In set theory and Boolean algebra, these are written formally as :\\\\begin{align} \\\\overline{A \\\\cup B} &= \\\\overline{A} \\\\cap \\\\overline{B},  \\\\overline{A \\\\cap B} &= \\\\overline{A} \\\\cup \\\\overline{B}, \\\\end{align} where * A and B are sets, * is the complement of A, * ‚à© is the intersection, and * ‚à™ is the union. In formal language, the rules are written as : eg(P\\\\lor Q)\\\\iff( eg P)\\\\land( eg Q), and : eg(P\\\\land Q)\\\\iff( eg P)\\\\lor( eg Q) where * P and Q are propositions, * eg is the negation logic operator (NOT), * \\\\land is the conjunction logic operator (AND), * \\\\lor is the disjunction logic operator (OR), * \\\\iff is a metalogical symbol meaning \\"can be replaced in a logical proof with\\". Applications of the rules include simplification of logical expressions in computer programs and digital circuit designs. De Morgan's laws are an example of a more general concept of mathematical duality. Formal notation The negation of conjunction rule may be written in sequent notation: : eg(P \\\\land Q) \\\\vdash ( eg P \\\\lor eg Q), and :( eg P \\\\lor eg Q) \\\\vdash eg(P \\\\land Q). The negation of disjunction rule may be written as: : eg(P \\\\lor Q) \\\\vdash ( eg P \\\\land eg Q), and :( eg P \\\\land eg Q) \\\\vdash eg(P \\\\lor Q). In rule form: negation of conjunction :\\\\frac{ eg (P \\\\land Q)}{\\\\therefore eg P \\\\lor eg Q} :\\\\frac{ eg P \\\\lor eg Q}{\\\\therefore eg (P \\\\land Q)} and negation of disjunction :\\\\frac{ eg (P \\\\lor Q)}{\\\\therefore eg P \\\\land eg Q} :\\\\frac{ eg P \\\\land eg Q}{\\\\therefore eg (P \\\\lor Q)} and expressed as a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic: :\\\\begin{align} eg (P \\\\land Q) &\\\\to ( eg P \\\\lor eg Q),  ( eg P \\\\lor eg Q) &\\\\to eg (P \\\\land Q),  eg (P \\\\lor Q) &\\\\to ( eg P \\\\land eg Q),  ( eg P \\\\land eg Q) &\\\\to eg (P \\\\lor Q), \\\\end{align} where P and Q are propositions expressed in some formal system. =Substitution form= De Morgan's laws are normally shown in the compact form above, with negation of the output on the left and negation of the inputs on the right. A clearer form for substitution can be stated as: :\\\\begin{align} (P \\\\land Q) &\\\\Longleftrightarrow eg ( eg P \\\\lor eg Q),  (P \\\\lor Q) &\\\\Longleftrightarrow eg ( eg P \\\\land eg Q). \\\\end{align} This emphasizes the need to invert both the inputs and the output, as well as change the operator, when doing a substitution. The laws have an important gap to the ( eg( eg p) \\\\iff p) double negation law. \\\\mathbb{L}, to become a formal logic system: \\\\ p, q, r, ...., \\\\emptyset \\\\in \\\\mathbb{L}\\\\ sequence reports symbols that are defined well formed at first order.

In set notation, De Morgan's laws can be remembered using the mnemonic \\"break the line, change the sign\\".2000 Solved Problems in Digital Electronics by S. P. Bali =Engineering= In electrical and computer engineering, De Morgan's laws are commonly written as: : \\\\overline{A \\\\cdot B} \\\\equiv \\\\overline {A} + \\\\overline {B} and : \\\\overline{A + B} \\\\equiv \\\\overline {A} \\\\cdot \\\\overline {B}, where: * \\\\cdot is the logical AND, * + is the logical OR, * the is the logical NOT of what is underneath the overbar. =Text searching= De Morgan‚Äôs laws commonly apply to text searching using Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT. Consider a set of documents containing the words ‚Äúcars‚Äù and ‚Äútrucks‚Äù. De Morgan‚Äôs laws hold that these two searches will return the same set of documents: :Search A: NOT (cars OR trucks) :Search B: (NOT cars) AND (NOT trucks) The corpus of documents containing ‚Äúcars‚Äù or ‚Äútrucks‚Äù can be represented by four documents: :Document 1: Contains only the word ‚Äúcars‚Äù. :Document 2: Contains only ‚Äútrucks‚Äù. :Document 3: Contains both ‚Äúcars‚Äù and ‚Äútrucks‚Äù. :Document 4: Contains neither ‚Äúcars‚Äù nor ‚Äútrucks‚Äù. To evaluate Search A, clearly the search ‚Äú(cars OR trucks)‚Äù will hit on Documents 1, 2, and 3. So the negation of that search (which is Search A) will hit everything else, which is Document 4. Evaluating Search B, the search ‚Äú(NOT cars)‚Äù will hit on documents that do not contain ‚Äúcars‚Äù, which is Documents 2 and 4. Similarly the search ‚Äú(NOT trucks)‚Äù will hit on Documents 1 and 4. Applying the AND operator to these two searches (which is Search B) will hit on the documents that are common to these two searches, which is Document 4. A similar evaluation can be applied to show that the following two searches will return the same set of documents (Documents 1, 2, 4): :Search C: NOT (cars AND trucks), :Search D: (NOT cars) OR (NOT trucks). History The laws are named after Augustus De Morgan (1806‚Äì1871),DeMorgan‚Äôs Theorems at mtsu.edu who introduced a formal version of the laws to classical propositional logic. De Morgan's formulation was influenced by algebraization of logic undertaken by George Boole, which later cemented De Morgan's claim to the find. Nevertheless, a similar observation was made by Aristotle, and was known to Greek and Medieval logicians.Boche≈Ñski's History of Formal Logic For example, in the 14th century, William of Ockham wrote down the words that would result by reading the laws out.William of Ockham, Summa Logicae, part II, sections 32 and 33. Jean Buridan, in his Summulae de Dialectica, also describes rules of conversion that follow the lines of De Morgan's laws.Jean Buridan, Summula de Dialectica. Trans. Gyula Klima. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001. See especially Treatise 1, Chapter 7, Section 5. Still, De Morgan is given credit for stating the laws in the terms of modern formal logic, and incorporating them into the language of logic. De Morgan's laws can be proved easily, and may even seem trivial.Augustus De Morgan (1806‚Äì1871) by Robert H. Orr Nonetheless, these laws are helpful in making valid inferences in proofs and deductive arguments. Informal proof De Morgan's theorem may be applied to the negation of a disjunction or the negation of a conjunction in all or part of a formula. =Negation of a disjunction= In the case of its application to a disjunction, consider the following claim: \\"it is false that either of A or B is true\\", which is written as: : eg(A\\\\lor B). In that it has been established that neither A nor B is true, then it must follow that both A is not true and B is not true, which may be written directly as: :( eg A)\\\\wedge( eg B). If either A or B were true, then the disjunction of A and B would be true, making its negation false. Presented in English, this follows the logic that \\"since two things are both false, it is also false that either of them is true\\". Working in the opposite direction, the second expression asserts that A is false and B is false (or equivalently that \\"not A\\" and \\"not B\\" are true). Knowing this, a disjunction of A and B must be false also. The negation of said disjunction must thus be true, and the result is identical to the first claim. =Negation of a conjunction= The application of De Morgan's theorem to a conjunction is very similar to its application to a disjunction both in form and rationale. Consider the following claim: \\"it is false that A and B are both true\\", which is written as: : eg(A\\\\land B). In order for this claim to be true, either or both of A or B must be false, for if they both were true, then the conjunction of A and B would be true, making its negation false. Thus, one (at least) or more of A and B must be false (or equivalently, one or more of \\"not A\\" and \\"not B\\" must be true). This may be written directly as, :( eg A)\\\\lor( eg B). Presented in English, this follows the logic that \\"since it is false that two things are both true, at least one of them must be false\\". Working in the opposite direction again, the second expression asserts that at least one of \\"not A\\" and \\"not B\\" must be true, or equivalently that at least one of A and B must be false. Since at least one of them must be false, then their conjunction would likewise be false. Negating said conjunction thus results in a true expression, and this expression is identical to the first claim. Formal proof Here we use A^\\\\complementto denote the complement of A. The proof that (A\\\\cap B)^\\\\complement = A^\\\\complement \\\\cup B^\\\\complement is completed in 2 steps by proving both (A\\\\cap B)^\\\\complement \\\\subseteq A^\\\\complement \\\\cup B^\\\\complement and A^\\\\complement \\\\cup B^\\\\complement \\\\subseteq (A\\\\cap B)^\\\\complement. =Part 1= Let x \\\\in (A \\\\cap B)^\\\\complement. Then, x ot\\\\in A \\\\cap B. Because A \\\\cap B = \\\\\\\\{y  y \\\\in A \\\\land y \\\\in B\\\\\\\\}, it must be the case that x ot\\\\in A or x ot\\\\in B. If x ot\\\\in A, then x \\\\in A^\\\\complement, so x \\\\in A^\\\\complement \\\\cup B^\\\\complement. Similarly, if x ot\\\\in B, then x \\\\in B^\\\\complement, so x \\\\in A^\\\\complement\\\\cup B^\\\\complement. Thus, \\\\forall x( x \\\\in (A\\\\cap B)^\\\\complement \\\\rarr x \\\\in A^\\\\complement \\\\cup B^\\\\complement); that is, (A\\\\cap B)^\\\\complement \\\\subseteq A^\\\\complement \\\\cup B^\\\\complement. =Part 2= To prove the reverse direction, let x \\\\in A^\\\\complement \\\\cup B^\\\\complement, and for contradiction assume x ot\\\\in (A\\\\cap B)^\\\\complement. Under that assumption, it must be the case that x \\\\in A\\\\cap B, so it follows that x \\\\in A and x \\\\in B, and thus x ot\\\\in A^\\\\complement and x ot\\\\in B^\\\\complement. However, that means x ot\\\\in A^\\\\complement \\\\cup B^\\\\complement, in contradiction to the hypothesis that x \\\\in A^\\\\complement \\\\cup B^\\\\complement, therefore, the assumption x ot\\\\in (A\\\\cap B)^\\\\complement must not be the case, meaning that x \\\\in (A\\\\cap B)^\\\\complement. Hence, \\\\forall x( x \\\\in A^\\\\complement \\\\cup B^\\\\complement \\\\rarr x \\\\in (A\\\\cap B)^\\\\complement), that is, A^\\\\complement \\\\cup B^\\\\complement \\\\subseteq (A\\\\cap B)^\\\\complement. =Conclusion= If A^\\\\complement \\\\cup B^\\\\complement \\\\subseteq (A\\\\cap B)^\\\\complement and (A \\\\cap B)^\\\\complement \\\\subseteq A^\\\\complement \\\\cup B^\\\\complement, then (A\\\\cap B)^\\\\complement = A^\\\\complement \\\\cup B^\\\\complement; this concludes the proof of De Morgan's law. The other De Morgan's law, (A \\\\cup B)^\\\\complement = A^\\\\complement \\\\cap B^\\\\complement, is proven similarly. Generalising De Morgan duality De Morgan's Laws represented as a circuit with logic gates In extensions of classical propositional logic, the duality still holds (that is, to any logical operator one can always find its dual), since in the presence of the identities governing negation, one may always introduce an operator that is the De Morgan dual of another. This leads to an important property of logics based on classical logic, namely the existence of negation normal forms: any formula is equivalent to another formula where negations only occur applied to the non-logical atoms of the formula. The existence of negation normal forms drives many applications, for example in digital circuit design, where it is used to manipulate the types of logic gates, and in formal logic, where it is needed to find the conjunctive normal form and disjunctive normal form of a formula. Computer programmers use them to simplify or properly negate complicated logical conditions. They are also often useful in computations in elementary probability theory. Let one define the dual of any propositional operator P(p, q, ...) depending on elementary propositions p, q, ... to be the operator \\\\mbox{P}^d defined by :\\\\mbox{P}^d(p, q, ...) = eg P( eg p, eg q, \\\\dots). Extension to predicate and modal logic This duality can be generalised to quantifiers, so for example the universal quantifier and existential quantifier are duals: : \\\\forall x \\\\, P(x) \\\\equiv eg [ \\\\exists x \\\\, eg P(x)] : \\\\exists x \\\\, P(x) \\\\equiv eg [ \\\\forall x \\\\, eg P(x)] To relate these quantifier dualities to the De Morgan laws, set up a model with some small number of elements in its domain D, such as :D = {a, b, c}. Then : \\\\forall x \\\\, P(x) \\\\equiv P(a) \\\\land P(b) \\\\land P(c) and : \\\\exists x \\\\, P(x) \\\\equiv P(a) \\\\lor P(b) \\\\lor P(c). But, using De Morgan's laws, : P(a) \\\\land P(b) \\\\land P(c) \\\\equiv eg ( eg P(a) \\\\lor eg P(b) \\\\lor eg P(c)) and : P(a) \\\\lor P(b) \\\\lor P(c) \\\\equiv eg ( eg P(a) \\\\land eg P(b) \\\\land eg P(c)), verifying the quantifier dualities in the model. Then, the quantifier dualities can be extended further to modal logic, relating the box (\\"necessarily\\") and diamond (\\"possibly\\") operators: : \\\\Box p \\\\equiv eg \\\\Diamond eg p, : \\\\Diamond p \\\\equiv eg \\\\Box eg p. In its application to the alethic modalities of possibility and necessity, Aristotle observed this case, and in the case of normal modal logic, the relationship of these modal operators to the quantification can be understood by setting up models using Kripke semantics.

The Airline Deregulation Act is a 1978 United States federal law that deregulated the airline industry in the United States, removing the federal government control over such areas as fares, routes, and market entry of new airlines. It introduced a free market in the commercial airline industry and led to a great increase in the number of flights, a decrease in fares, an increase in the number of passengers and miles flown, and a consolidation of carriers. The Civil Aeronautics Board's powers of regulation were phased out, but the regulatory powers of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) were not diminished over all aspects of aviation safety. History Since 1938, the federal Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) had regulated all domestic interstate air transport routes as a public utility, setting fares, routes, and schedules. Airlines that flew only intrastate routes, however, were not regulated by the CAB but were regulated by the governments of the states in which they operated. One way that the CAB promoted air travel was generally attempting to hold fares down in the short-haul market, which would be subsidized by higher fares in the long-haul market. The CAB also had ensure that the airlines had a reasonable rate of return. The CAB earned a reputation for bureaucratic complacency; airlines were subject to lengthy delays when they applied for new routes or fare changes, and were often not approved. For example, World Airways applied to begin a low-fare New York City to Los Angeles route in 1967; the CAB studied the request for over six years, only to dismiss it because the record was \\"stale.\\" Continental Airlines began service between Denver and San Diego after eight years only because a United States Court of Appeals ordered the CAB to approve the application.Continental Air Lines, Inc. v. Civil Aeronautics Board, 519 F.2d 944, C.A.D.C. 1975. This rigid system encountered tremendous pressure in the 1970s. The 1973 oil crisis and stagflation radically changed the economic environment, as did technological advances such as the jumbo jet. Most major airlines, whose profits were virtually guaranteed, favored the rigid system, but passengers who were forced to pay escalating fares were against it and were joined by communities that subsidized air service at ever-higher rates. United States Congress became concerned that air transport, in the long run, might follow the nation's railroads into trouble. In 1970, the Penn Central Railroad had collapsed, then the largest bankruptcy in history, resulting in a huge taxpayer bailout and the creation of Conrail and Amtrak. Leading economists had argued for several decades that the regulation led to inefficiency and higher costs. The Carter administration argued that the industry and its customers would benefit from new entrants, the abolishing of price regulation, and reduced control over routes and hub cities Ch. 5. In 1970 and 1971, the Council of Economic Advisers in the Nixon administration, along with the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and other agencies, proposed legislation to diminish price collusion and entry barriers in rail and trucking transportation. While the initiative was in process in the Ford administration, the Senate Judiciary Committee, which had jurisdiction over antitrust law, began hearings on airline deregulation in 1975. Senator Edward Kennedy took the lead in the hearings. The committee was deemed a more friendly forum than what likely would have been the more appropriate venue, the Aviation Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee. The Ford administration supported the Judiciary Committee initiative. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Alfred E. Kahn, a professor of economics at Cornell University, to be chair of the CAB. A concerted push for the legislation had developed from leading economists, leading thinktanks in Washington, a civil society coalition advocating the reform (patterned on a coalition earlier developed for the truck-and-rail-reform efforts), the head of the regulatory agency, Senate leadership, the Carter administration, and even some in the airline industry. The coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978. Dan McKinnon would be the last chairman of the CAB and would oversee its final closure on January 1, 1985.  Legislative terms  Senator Howard Cannon of Nevada introduced S. 2493 on February 6, 1978. The bill was passed and was signed by Carter on October 24, 1978.Airline Deregulation Act, , et seq. Approved October 24, 1978. The stated goals of the Act included the following: * the maintenance of safety as the highest priority in air commerce; * placing maximum reliance on competition in providing air transportation services; * the encouragement of air service at major urban areas through secondary (nonprimary) or satellite airports; * the avoidance of unreasonable industry concentration which would tend to allow one or more air carriers to unreasonably increase prices, reduce services, or exclude competition; and * the encouragement of entry into air transportation markets by new air carriers, the encouragement of entry into additional markets by existing air carriers, and the continued strengthening of small air carriers. The Act intended for various restrictions on airline operations to be removed over four years, with complete elimination of restrictions on domestic routes and new services by December 31, 1981, and the end of all domestic fare regulation by January 1, 1983. In practice, changes came rather more rapidly than that. Among its many terms, the act did the following: * the CAB's authority to set fares was gradually eliminated; * the CAB was required to expedite processing of various requests; * standards were liberalized for the establishment of new airlines; * airlines were allowed to take over service on routes underutilized by competitors or on which the competitor received a local service subsidy; * American-owned international carriers were allowed to offer domestic service; * the evidentiary burden was placed on the CAB to block a route as inconsistent with \\"public convenience\\"; * the CAB was prohibited from introducing new regulation of charter trips; * certain subsidies for carrying mail were terminated effective January 1, 1986, and Essential Air Service subsidies effective 10 years from enactment (however, , the EAS is still in existence, serving 160 communities in the US); * existing mutual aid agreements were terminated between air carriers; * the CAB was allowed to grant antitrust immunity to carriers; * the FAA was directed to develop safety standards for commuter airlines; * intrastate carriers were allowed to enter into through service and joint fare agreements with interstate air carriers; * air carriers, in hiring employees, were required to give preference to terminated or furloughed employees of another carrier for 10 years after enactment; and * remaining regulatory authority were transferred to the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and the CAB itself was dissolved in 1984. Safety inspections and air traffic control remained in the hands of the FAA, and the act also required the Secretary of Transportation to report to Congress about air safety and any implications that deregulation would have in that matter. The ADA (along with the Montreal Convention with regard to international flights) also has the effect of preempting state law with regard to claims against airlines for delays, discrimination, consumer protection violations and other allegations of passenger mistreatment.  Effects  A 1996 Government Accountability Office report found that the average fare per passenger mile was about nine percent lower in 1994 than in 1979. Between 1976 and 1990 the paid fare had declined approximately thirty percent in inflation-adjusted terms. Passenger loads have risen, partly because airlines can now transfer larger aircraft to longer, busier routes and replace them with smaller ones on shorter, lower-traffic routes. However, these trends have not been distributed evenly throughout the national air transportation network. Costs have fallen more dramatically on higher-traffic, longer-distance routes than on shorter ones. Exposure to competition led to heavy losses and conflicts with labor unions for a number of carriers. Between 1978 and mid-2001, eight major carriers (including Eastern, Midway, Braniff, Pan Am, Continental, Northwest Airlines, and TWA) and more than 100 smaller airlines went bankrupt or were liquidated, including most of the dozens of new airlines founded in deregulation's aftermath. For the most part, smaller markets did not suffer the erosion of service that had been predicted by some opponents of deregulation. However, until the advent of low-cost carriers, point-to-point air transport declined in favor of a more pronounced hub-and-spoke system. A traveler starting from a non-hub airport (a spoke) would fly into the hub, then reach the final destination by flying from the hub to another airport, the spoke. While more efficient for serving smaller markets, this system has enabled some airlines to drive out competition from their \\"fortress hubs.\\" The growth of low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines has brought more point-to-point service back into the United States air transport system, and contributed to the development of a wider range of aircraft types that are better adaptable to markets of varying sizes.

Born in Germany to a German mother and American father, Willis moved to the U.S. with his family when he was two years old. His career began on the off-Broadway stage in the 1970s. He achieved fame with a leading role on the comedy-drama series Moonlighting (1985‚Äì1989) and has since appeared in over 70 films, coming to be widely regarded as an action hero after his portrayal of John McClane in the Die Hard franchise (1988‚Äì2013) and other subsequent roles. Willis's other credits include The Last Boy Scout (1991), Pulp Fiction (1994), 12 Monkeys (1995), The Fifth Element (1997), The Jackal (1997), Armageddon (1998), Mercury Rising (1998), The Sixth Sense (1999), Sin City (2005), Red (2010), The Expendables 2 (2012), Looper (2012), and as David Dunn in the Unbreakable trilogy: Unbreakable (2000), Split (2016), and Glass (2019). As a singer, Willis released his debut album The Return of Bruno in 1987. He released two more albums in 1989 and 2001. He made his Broadway debut in the stage adaptation of Misery in 2015. He is the recipient of several accolades, including a Golden Globe, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and two People's Choice Awards. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2006.  Early life  Walter Bruce Willis was born in the West German town of Idar-Oberstein on March 19, 1955. His mother, Marlene, was a German woman from Kassel. His father, David Willis, was an American soldier. Willis has a younger sister named Florence and two younger brothers named Robert (deceased) and David. After being discharged from the military in 1957, his father took the family back to his hometown of Carneys Point, New Jersey.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 Willis has described his background as a \\"long line of blue collar people\\". His mother worked in a bank and his father was a welder, master mechanic, and factory worker. He attended Penns Grove High School, where he developed a stutter and was nicknamed \\"Buck-Buck\\" by his schoolmates. He joined the drama club, found that acting on stage reduced his stutter, and was eventually elected student council president. After graduating from high school in 1973, Willis worked as a security guard at the Salem Nuclear Power Plant and transported crew members at the DuPont Chambers Works factory in Deepwater, New Jersey. After working as a private investigator (a role he would later play in the comedy-drama series Moonlighting and the action-comedy film The Last Boy Scout), he turned to acting. He enrolled in the Drama Program at Montclair State University, where he was cast in a production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. He left school in 1977 and moved to New York City, where he supported himself in the early 1980s as a bartender at the Manhattan art bar Kamikaze while living in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood.  Career  =1980s= Willis at the 61st Academy Awards, 1989 While living in New York, Willis performed as an extra in Paul Newman's closing summation scene in The Verdict (1982). He later moved to California, and appeared in a 1984 episode of the TV series Miami Vice titled \\"No Exit\\". In 1985, he was the guest actor in the first episode of the 1980s revival of The Twilight Zone, \\"Shatterday\\". He successfully auditioned for the role of David Addison Jr. of the television series Moonlighting (1985‚Äì1989), competing against 3,000 other actors for the position. The starring role in Moonlighting, opposite Cybill Shepherd, helped to establish him as a comedic actor, with the show lasting five seasons winning him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy. During the height of the show's success, beverage maker Seagram hired Willis as the pitchman for their Golden Wine Cooler products. The advertising campaign paid the rising star between $5‚Äì7 million over two years. In spite of that, Willis chose not to renew his contract with the company when he decided to stop drinking alcohol in 1988. Willis had his first lead role in a feature film in the 1987 Blake Edwards film Blind Date, with Kim Basinger and John Larroquette. Edwards cast him again to play the real-life cowboy actor Tom Mix in Sunset (1988). However, it was his then-unexpected turn in the film Die Hard (1988) as John McClane that catapulted him to movie star and action hero status. He performed most of his own stunts in the film, and the film grossed $138,708,852 worldwide. Following his success with Die Hard, he had a leading role in the drama In Country as Vietnam veteran Emmett Smith and also provided the voice for a talking baby in Look Who's Talking, as well as its sequel, Look Who's Talking Too. In the late 1980s, Willis enjoyed moderate success as a recording artist, recording an album of pop-blues titled The Return of Bruno, which included the hit single \\"Respect Yourself\\" featuring The Pointer Sisters. The LP was promoted by a Spinal Tap‚Äìlike rockumentary parody featuring scenes of Willis performing at famous events including Woodstock. He released a version of the Drifters song \\"Under the Boardwalk\\" as a second single; it got to No. 2 in the UK Top 40 but was less successful in the U.S. Willis returned to the recording studio several times afterward. = 1990s = Having acquired major personal success and pop culture influence playing John McClane in Die Hard, Willis reprised his role in the sequels Die Hard 2 (1990) and Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995). These first three installments in the Die Hard series grossed over US$700 million internationally and propelled Willis to the first rank of Hollywood action stars. In the early 1990s, Willis's career suffered a moderate slump, as he starred in flops such as The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990). He gained more success with Striking Distance (1993) but flopped again with Color of Night (1994): another box office failure, it was savaged by critics but did well in the home video market and became one of the Top 20 most-rented films in the United States in 1995,Billboard vol 108 No. 1 (1/6/1996) p.54. Maxim magazine also ranked his sex scene in the film as \\"the Best Sex Scene in film history\\". In 1994, he also had a leading role in one part of Quentin Tarantino's acclaimed Pulp Fiction (the film has three-parts story); the film's huge success gave a new boost to his career. In 1996, he was the executive producer and star of the cartoon Bruno the Kid which featured a CGI representation of himself. That same year, he starred in Mike Judge's animated film Beavis and Butt-head Do America with his then-wife Demi Moore. In the movie, he plays a drunken criminal named \\"Muddy Grimes\\", who mistakenly sends Judge's titular characters to kill his wife, Dallas (voiced by Moore). He then played the lead roles in 12 Monkeys (1995) and The Fifth Element (1997). However, by the end of the 1990s his career had fallen into another slump with critically panned films like The Jackal, Mercury Rising, and Breakfast of Champions, saved only by the success of the Michael Bay-directed Armageddon which was the highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide. The same year his voice and likeness were featured in the PlayStation video game Apocalypse. In 1999, Willis then played the starring role in M. Night Shyamalan's film, The Sixth Sense, which was both a commercial and critical success. = 2000s = Willis after a ceremony where he was named Hasty Pudding Theatrical's Man of the Year in 2002 In 2000, Willis won an EmmyBruce Willis Emmy Award Winner.

In a July 1998 interview with George magazine, he stated: \\"Organized religions in general, in my opinion, are dying forms. They were all very important when we didn't know why the sun moved, why weather changed, why hurricanes occurred, or volcanoes happened. Modern religion is the end trail of modern mythology. But there are people who interpret the Bible literally. Literally! I choose not to believe that's the way. And that's what makes America cool, you know?\\" = Political views = In 1988, Willis and then-wife Demi Moore campaigned for Democratic Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis' Presidential bid. Four years later, he supported President George H. W. Bush for reelection and was an outspoken critic of Bill Clinton. However, in 1996, he declined to endorse Clinton's Republican opponent Bob Dole, because Dole had criticized Demi Moore for her role in the film Striptease. Willis was an invited speaker at the 2000 Republican National Convention, and supported George W. Bush that year. He did not make any contributions or public endorsements in the 2008 presidential campaign. In several June 2007 interviews, he declared that he maintains some Republican ideologies.

If you take guns away from legal gun owners, then the only people who have guns are the bad guys.\\" In February 2006, Willis was in Manhattan to promote his film 16 Blocks with reporters. One reporter attempted to ask Willis about his opinion on the current government, but was interrupted by Willis in mid-sentence when he said: \\"I'm sick of answering this fucking question. I'm a Republican only as far as I want a smaller government, I want less government intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars that we give 50 percent of every year. I want them to be fiscally responsible and I want these goddamn lobbyists out of Washington. Do that and I'll say I'm a Republican. I hate the government, OK? I'm apolitical. Write that down. I'm not a Republican.\\" Willis's name was in an advertisement in the Los Angeles Times on August 17, 2006, that condemned Hamas and Hezbollah and supported Israel in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war.\\"Nicole Kidman and 84 Others Stand United Against Terrorism.\\" Hollywood Grind.

Willis purchased 12,000 boxes of cookies, and they were distributed to sailors aboard USS John F. Kennedy and other troops stationed throughout the Middle East at the time.Willis meets with Brigadier General Albert Bryant, Jr and deployed soldiers from the 4th Infantry Division, in Tikrit, Iraq, during his 2003 USO tour In 2003, Willis visited Iraq as part of the USO tour, singing to the troops with his band, The Accelerators. Willis considered joining the military to help fight the second Iraq War, but was deterred by his age. It was believed he offered $1 million to any noncombatant who turns in terrorist leaders Osama bin Laden, Ayman al- Zawahiri, or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi; in the June 2007 issue of Vanity Fair, however, he clarified that the statement was made hypothetically and not meant to be taken literally. Willis has also criticized the media for its coverage of the war, complaining that the press were more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the war:  In popular culture  In 1996, Roger Director, a writer and producer from Moonlighting, wrote a roman √† clef on Willis titled A Place to Fall. Cybill Shepherd wrote in her 2000 autobiography, Cybill Disobedience, that Willis became angry at Director when he read the book and discovered the character had been written as a \\"neurotic, petulant actor.\\" A Lego version of himself appeared in the 2019 film The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, with Willis providing the voice.

Constantine's death marked the end of the Byzantine Empire, an institution tracing its origin to Constantine the Great's foundation of Constantinople as the Roman Empire's new capital in 330. Since the Byzantine Empire was the Roman Empire's medieval continuation, with its citizens continually referring to themselves as Romans, Constantine XI's death and Constantinople's fall also marked the definitive end of the Roman Empire, founded by Augustus almost 1,500 years earlier. Constantine was the fourth son of Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos and Helena Draga≈°, the daughter of Serbian ruler Konstantin Dejanoviƒá. Little is known of his early life, but from the 1420s onward, he is repeatedly demonstrated to have been a skilled general. Based on his career and surviving contemporary sources, Constantine appears to primarily have been a soldier. This does not mean that Constantine was not also a skilled administrator: he was trusted and favored to such an extent by his older brother, Emperor John VIII Palaiologos, that he was designated as regent twice during John VIII's journeys away from Constantinople in 1423‚Äì1424 and 1437‚Äì1440. In 1427‚Äì1428, Constantine and John fended off an attack on the Morea (the Peloponnese) by Carlo I Tocco, ruler of Epirus, and in 1428 Constantine was proclaimed Despot of the Morea and ruled the province together with his older brother Theodore and his younger brother Thomas. Together, they extended Byzantine rule to cover almost the entire Peloponnese for the first time since the Fourth Crusade more than two hundred years before and rebuilt the ancient Hexamilion wall, which defended the peninsula from outside attacks. Although ultimately unsuccessful, Constantine personally led a campaign into Central Greece and Thessaly in 1444‚Äì1446, attempting to extend Byzantine rule into Greece once more. In 1448, John VIII died without children, and as his favored successor, Constantine was proclaimed emperor on 6 January 1449. Constantine's brief reign would see the emperor grapple with three primary concerns. First, there was the issue of an heir, as Constantine was also childless. Despite attempts by Constantine's friend and confidant George Sphrantzes to find him a wife, Constantine ultimately died unmarried. The second concern was the religious disunity within what little remained of his empire. Constantine and his predecessor John VIII both believed a union between the Orthodox and Catholic Churches was needed to secure military aid from Catholic Europe, but much of the Byzantine populace opposed the idea. Finally, the most important concern was the growing Ottoman Empire, which by 1449 completely surrounded Constantinople. In April 1453, the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II laid siege to Constantinople with an army perhaps numbering as many as 80,000 men. Even though the city's defenders may have numbered less than a tenth of the sultan's army, Constantine considered the idea of abandoning Constantinople unthinkable. The emperor stayed to defend the city and on 29 May, Constantinople fell. Constantine died the same day. Although no reliable eyewitness accounts of his death survived, most historical accounts agree that the emperor led a last charge against the Ottomans and died fighting. Constantine was the last Christian ruler of Constantinople, which alongside his bravery at the city's fall cemented him as a near-legendary figure in later histories and Greek folklore. Some saw the foundation of Constantinople (the New Rome) under Constantine the Great and its loss under another Constantine as fulfillment of the city's destiny, just as Old Rome had been founded by a Romulus and lost under another. He became known in later Greek folklore as the Marble Emperor (), reflecting a popular legend which endured for centuries that Constantine had not actually died, but had been rescued by an angel and turned into marble, hidden beneath the Golden Gate of Constantinople awaiting a call from God to be restored to life and reconquer both the city and the old empire.  Early life  = Family and background = Miniature from an early 15th-century manuscript depicting Constantine's father Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, his mother Helena Draga≈° and his three older brothers John, Theodore and Andronikos Constantine Dragases Palaiologos was born on 8 February 1405 as the fourth son of Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos (1391‚Äì1425), the eighth emperor of the Palaiologos dynasty. Constantine's mother (from whom he took his second last name) was Helena Draga≈°, the daughter of Serbian ruler Konstantin Dejanoviƒá. Constantine is frequently described as Porphyrog√©nnƒìtos (\\"born in the purple\\"), a distinction granted to sons born to a reigning emperor in the imperial palace. Manuel ruled a disintegrating and dwindling Byzantine Empire. The catalyst of Byzantium's fall had been the arrival of the Seljuk Turks in Anatolia in the 11th century. Though some emperors, such as Alexios I and Manuel I, had successfully recovered portions of Anatolia through help from western crusaders, their gains were only temporary. Anatolia was the empire's most fertile, populated, and wealthy region, and after its loss, Byzantium more or less experienced constant decline. Although most of it was eventually reconquered, the Byzantine Empire was crippled by the 1204 Fourth Crusade and the loss of Constantinople to the Latin Empire, formed by the crusaders. The Byzantine Empire, under the founder of the Palaiologos dynasty, Michael VIII, retook Constantinople in 1261, though the damage to the empire was irreversible and the empire continued to decline over the course of the 14th century as the result of frequent civil wars. Over the course of the 14th century, the Ottoman Turks had conquered vast swaths of territories and by 1405, they ruled much of Anatolia, Bulgaria, central Greece, Macedonia, Serbia and Thessaly. The Byzantine Empire, once extending throughout the eastern Mediterranean, was reduced to the imperial capital of Constantinople, the Peloponnese, and a handful of islands in the Aegean Sea, and was also forced to pay tribute to the Ottomans. As the empire dwindled, the emperors concluded that the only way to ensure that their remaining territory was kept intact was to grant some of their holdings to their sons, who received the title of despot, as appanages to defend and govern. Manuel's oldest son, John, was raised to co-emperor and designated to succeed his father. The second son, Theodore, was designated as the Despot of the Morea (the prosperous province constituting the Peloponnese) and the third son, Andronikos, was proclaimed as Despot of Thessaloniki in 1408. The younger sons; Constantine, Demetrios and Thomas, were kept in Constantinople as there was not sufficient land left to grant them. Little is known of Constantine's early life. From an early age, he was admired by George Sphrantzes (later a famed Byzantine historian), who would later enter his service, and later encomiasts often wrote that Constantine had always been courageous, adventurous, and skilled in martial arts, horsemanship, and hunting. Many accounts of Constantine's life, both before and after he became emperor, are heavily skewed and eulogize his reign, as most of them lack contemporary sources and were composed after his death. Based on his actions and the surviving commentary from some of his advisors and contemporaries, Constantine appeared to have been more comfortable with military matters than with matters of state or diplomacy, though he was also a competent administrator‚Äîas illustrated by his tenures as regent‚Äîand tended to heed his councilors' advice on important matters of state. Aside from stylized and smudged depictions on seals and coins, no contemporary depictions of Constantine survive. Notable images of Constantine include a seal currently located in Vienna (of unknown provenance, probably from an imperial chrysobull), a few coins, and his portrait among the other Byzantine emperors in the Biblioteca Estense copy of the history of Zonaras. In the latter he is shown with a rounded beard, in noted contrast to his forked-bearded relatives, but it is unclear whether that reflects his actual appearance. = Early career = 1422 map of Constantinople by catographer Cristoforo Buondelmonti, the oldest surviving map of the city After an unsuccessful Ottoman siege of Constantinople in 1422, Manuel II suffered a stroke and was left paralyzed in one side of his body. He lived for another three years, but the empire's government was effectively in the hands of Constantine's brother John. Thessaloniki was also under siege by the Ottomans; to prevent it from falling into their hands, John gave the city to the Republic of Venice. As Manuel II had once hoped years ago, John hoped to rally support from Western Europe, and he left Constantinople in November 1423 to travel to Venice and Hungary. By this time, Manuel had abandoned his hope of western aid and had even attempted to dissuade John from pursuing it. Manuel believed that an eventual church union, which would become John's goal, would only antagonize the Turks and the empire's populace, which could have started a civil war. John was impressed by his brother's actions during the 1422 Ottoman siege, and trusted him more than his other brothers. Constantine was given the title of despot and was left to rule Constantinople as regent. With the aid of his bedridden father Manuel, Constantine drew up a new peace treaty with the Ottoman sultan Murad II, who momentarily spared Constantinople from further Turkish attacks. John returned from his journey in November 1424 after failing to procure help. On 21 July 1425, Manuel died and John became the senior emperor, John VIII Palaiologos. Constantine was granted a strip of land to the north of Constantinople that extended from the town of Mesembria in the north to Derkos in the south. It also included the port of Selymbria as his appanage in 1425. Although this strip of land was small, it was close to Constantinople and strategically important, which demonstrated that Constantine was trusted by both Manuel II and John. After Constantine's successful tenure as regent, John deemed his brother loyal and capable. Because their brother Theodore expressed his discontent over his position as Despot of the Morea to John during the latter's visit in 1423, John soon recalled Constantine from Mesembria and designated him as Theodore's successor. Theodore eventually changed his mind, but John would eventually assign Constantine to the Morea as a despot in 1427 after a campaign there. Though Theodore was content to rule in the Morea, historian Donald Nicol believes that the support was helpful, as the peninsula was repeatedly threatened by external forces throughout the 1420s. In 1423, the Ottomans broke through the ancient Hexamilion wall‚Äîwhich guarded the Peloponnese‚Äîand devastated the Morea. The Morea was also constantly threatened by Carlo I Tocco, the Italian ruler of Epirus, who campaigned against Theodore shortly before the Ottoman invasion and again in 1426, occupying territory in the northwestern parts of the Morea. In 1427, John VIII personally set out to deal with Tocco, bringing Constantine and Sphrantzes with him. On 26 December 1427, the two brothers reached Mystras, the capital of the Morea, and made their way to the town of Glarentza, which was captured by the Epirotes. In the Battle of the Echinades, a naval skirmish off the coast of Glarentza, Tocco was defeated and he agreed to relinquish his conquests in the Morea. In order to seal the peace, Tocco offered his niece, Maddalena Tocco (whose name was later changed to the Greek Theodora), in marriage to Constantine, her dowry being Glarentza and the other Moreot territories. Glarentza was given to the Byzantines on 1 May 1428 and on 1 July, Constantine married Theodora.  Despot of the Morea  = Early rule in the Morea = Map of the Peloponnese in the Middle Ages The transfer of Tocco's conquered Moreot territories to Constantine complicated the Morea's government structure. Since his brother Theodore refused to step down as despot, the despotate became governed by two members of the imperial family for the first time since its creation in 1349. Soon thereafter, the younger Thomas (aged 19) was also appointed as a third Despot of the Morea, which meant that the nominally undivided despotate had effectively disintegrated into three smaller principalities. Theodore did not share control over Mystras with Constantine or Thomas; instead, Theodore granted Constantine lands throughout the Morea, including the northern harbor town of Aigio, fortresses and towns in Laconia (in the south), and Kalamata and Messenia in the west. Constantine made Glarentza, which he was entitled to by marriage, his capital. Meanwhile, Thomas was given lands in the north and based himself in the castle of Kalavryta. During his tenure as despot, Constantine was brave and energetic, but generally cautious. Shortly after being appointed as despots, Constantine and Thomas, together with Theodore, joined forces in an attempt to seize the flourishing and strategically- important port of Patras in the northwest of the Morea, which was ruled by its Catholic Archbishop, Pandolfo Malatesta (Theodore's brother-in-law). The campaign ended in failure, possibly due to Theodore's reluctant participation and Thomas' inexperience. Constantine confided with Sphrantzes and John at a secret meeting in Mystras that he would make a second attempt to retake Patras by himself; if he failed, he would return to his old appanage by the Black Sea. Constantine and Sphrantzes, confident that the city's many Greek inhabitants would support their takeover, marched towards Patras on 1 March 1429, and they besieged the city on 20 March. The siege developed into a long and drawn-out engagement, with occasional skirmishes. At one point, Constantine's horse was shot and killed under him and the despot nearly died, being saved by Sphrantzes at the cost of Sphrantzes being captured by the defenders of Patras (though he would be released, albeit in a state of near- death, on 23 April). After almost two months, the defenders opened up to the possibility of negotiation in May. Malatesta journeyed to Italy in an attempt to recruit reinforcements and the defenders agreed that if he did not return to them by the end of the month, Patras would surrender. Constantine agreed to this and withdrew his army. On 1 June, Constantine returned to the city and, since the Archbishop had not returned, met with the city's leaders in the city's Cathedral of St. Andrew on 4 June and they accepted him as their new lord. The Archbishop's castle, located on a nearby hill, fought against Constantine for another 12 months before surrendering. Ruins of the castle at Patras, captured by Constantine in 1430 Constantine's capture of Patras was seen as an affront by the Pope, the Venetians, and the Ottomans. In order to pacify any threats, Constantine sent ambassadors to all three, with Sphrantzes being sent to talk with Turahan, the Ottoman governor of Thessaly. Although Sphrantzes was successful in removing the threat of Turkish reprisal, the threat from the west was realized as the dispossessed Archbishop arrived at the head of a mercenary army of Catalans. Unfortunately for Malatesta, the Catalans had little interest in helping him recover Patras, and they attacked and seized Glarentza instead, which Constantine had to buy back from them for 6,000 Venetian ducats, and began plundering the Moreot coastline. To prevent Glarentza from being seized by pirates, Constantine eventually ordered it to be destroyed. During this perilous time, Constantine suffered another loss: Theodora died in November 1429. The grief-stricken Constantine first had her buried at Glarentza, but then moved to Mystras. Once the Archbishop's castle surrendered to Constantine in July 1430, the city was fully restored to Byzantine rule after 225 years of foreign occupation. In November, Sphrantzes was rewarded by being proclaimed as the city's governor. By the early 1430s, the efforts of Constantine and his younger brother Thomas had ensured that nearly all of the Peloponnese was under Byzantine rule again since the Fourth Crusade. Thomas ended the Principality of Achaea by marrying Catherine Zaccaria, daughter and heir of the final prince, Centurione II Zaccaria. When Centurione died in 1432, Thomas took control of all his remaining territories by right of marriage. The only lands in the Peloponnese remaining under foreign rule were the few port towns and cities still held by the Republic of Venice. Sultan Murad II felt uneasy about the recent string of Byzantine successes in the Morea. In 1431, Turahan sent his troops south on Murad's orders to demolish the Hexamilion wall in an effort to remind the despots that they were the Sultan's vassals. = Second tenure as regent = Byzantine Constantinoplealt=left In March 1432, Constantine, possibly desiring to be closer to Mystras, made a new territorial agreement (presumably approved by Theodore and John VIII) with Thomas. Thomas agreed to cede his fortress Kalavryta to Constantine, who made it his new capital, in exchange for Elis, which Thomas made his new capital. Relationships between the three despots eventually soured. John VIII had no sons to succeed him and it was thus assumed that his successor would be one of his four surviving brothers (Andronikos having died some time before). John VIII's preferred successor was known to be Constantine and though this choice was accepted by Thomas, who had a good relationship with his older brother, it was resented by Constantine's older brother Theodore. When Constantine was summoned to the capital in 1435, Theodore falsely believed it was to appoint Constantine as co-emperor and designated heir, and he travelled to Constantinople to raise his objections. The quarrel between Constantine and Theodore was not resolved until the end of 1436, when the future Patriarch Gregory Mammas was sent to reconcile them and prevent civil war. The brothers agreed that Constantine was to return to Constantinople, while Theodore and Thomas would remain in the Morea. John needed Constantine in Constantinople as he was departing for Italy soon. On 24 September 1437, Constantine reached Constantinople. Although he was not proclaimed as co-emperor, his appointment as regent for a second time, suggested to John by their mother Helena, indicated that he was to be regarded as John's intended heir, much to the dismay of his other brothers. Contemporary sketches by Pisanello of the Byzantine delegation at the Council of Florence. The figure mounted on the horse is Constantine's brother, Emperor John VIII Palaiologos. John left for Italy in November to attend the Council of Ferrara in an effort to unite the Eastern and Western churches. Although many in the Byzantine Empire opposed a union of the Churches, as it would mean religious submission under the Papacy, John viewed a union as necessary. The papacy did not view the situation of the Christians in the East as something positive, but it would not call for any aid to the disintegrating empire if it did not acknowledge obedience to the Catholic Church and renounce what Catholics perceived as errors. John brought a large delegation to Italy, including Joseph II, the Patriarch of Constantinople; representatives of the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Jerusalem; large numbers of bishops, monks, and priests; and his younger brother Demetrios. Demetrios showed opposition against a church union, but John decided not to leave him in the East since Demetrios had shown rebellious tendencies and was thought to try to take the throne with Ottoman support. Constantine was not left without supporting courtiers in Constantinople: Constantine's and John's cousin Demetrios Palaiologos Kantakouzenos and the experienced statesman Loukas Notaras were left in the city. Helena and Sphrantzes were also there to advise Constantine. In 1438, Constantine served as the best man at Sphrantzes' wedding, and would later become the godfather to two of Sphrantzes' children. During John's absence from Constantinople, the Ottomans abided by the previously established peace. Trouble appeared to have brewed only once: in early 1439, Constantine wrote to his brother in Italy to remind the Pope that the Byzantines had been promised two warships by the end of spring. Constantine hoped that the ships would leave Italy within fifteen days, as he believed that Murad II was planning a strong offensive against Constantinople. Although the ships were not sent, Constantinople was not in danger as Murad's campaign focused on taking Smederevo in Serbia. In June 1439, the council in Florence, Italy, declared that the churches had been reunited. John returned to Constantinople on 1 February 1440. Although he was received with a grand ceremony organized by Constantine and Demetrios (who had returned sometime earlier), the news of the unification stirred a wave of resentment and bitterness among the general populace, who felt that John had betrayed their faith and their world view. Many feared the union would arouse suspicion among the Ottomans. Constantine's agreed with his brother's views on the union: if a sacrifice of the independence of their church resulted in the Westerners organizing a crusade and saving Constantinople, it would not have been in vain. = Second marriage and Ottoman threats = Despite having been relieved of his duties as regent upon John's return, Constantine stayed in the capital for the rest of 1440. He may have stayed in order to find a suitable wife, wishing to remarry since it had been more than ten years since Theodora's death. He decided on Caterina Gattilusio, daughter of Dorino I Gattilusio, the Genoese lord of the island Lesbos. Sphrantzes was sent to Lesbos in December 1440 to propose and arrange the marriage. In late 1441, Constantine sailed to Lesbos with Sphrantzes and Loukas Notaras, and in August he married Caterina. In September, he left Lesbos, leaving Caterina with her father on Lesbos, to travel to the Morea. Upon his return to the Morea, Constantine observed that Theodore and Thomas had ruled well without him. He believed that he could serve the empire's needs better if he was closer to the capital. His younger brother Demetrios governed Constantine's former appanage around Mesembria in Thrace, and Constantine pondered the possibility that he and Demetrios could switch places, with Constantine regaining the Black Sea appanage and Demetrios being granted Constantine's holdings in the Morea. Constantine sent Sphrantzes to propose the idea to both Demetrios and Murad II, who by this point had to be consulted about any appointments. By 1442, Demetrios had no desire for new appointments and was eyeing the imperial throne. He had just made a deal with Murad himself and raised an army, portraying himself as the champion of the Turk-supported cause that opposed the union of the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches and declared war on John. When Sphrantzes reached Demetrios to forward Constantine's offer, Demetrios was already preparing to march on Constantinople. The danger he posed to the city was so great that Constantine was summoned from the Morea by John to oversee the city's defenses. In April 1442, Demetrios and the Ottomans began their attack and in July, Constantine left the Morea to relieve his brother in the capital. On the way, Constantine met his wife at Lesbos and together they sailed to Lemnos, where they were stopped by an Ottoman blockade and were trapped for months. Although Venice sent ships to assist them, Caterina fell ill and died in August; she was buried at Myrina on Lemnos. Constantine did not reach Constantinople until November and by then, the Ottoman attack had already been repelled. Demetrios' punishment was a brief imprisonment. In March 1443, Sphrantzes was made governor of Selymbria in Constantine's name. From Selymbria, Sphrantzes and Constantine were able to keep a watchful eye on Demetrios' activities. In November, Constantine relinquished control of Selymbria to Theodore, who had abandoned his position as Despot of the Morea, which made Constantine and Thomas the sole Despots of the Morea and gave Constantine Mystras, the despotate's prosperous capital. = Despot at Mystras = The Despot's Palace in Mystras, from which Constantine ruled as Despot of the Morea 1443‚Äì1449 With Theodore and Demetrios gone, Constantine and Thomas hoped to strengthen the Morea. By this time, the Morea was the cultural center of the Byzantine world and provided a more hopeful atmosphere than Constantinople. Patrons of art and science had settled there at Theodore's invitation and churches, monasteries, and mansions continued to be built. The two Palaiologos brothers hoped to make the Morea into a safe and nearly self-sufficient principality. The philosopher Gemistus Pletho, employed in Constantine's service, said that while Constantinople had once been the New Rome, Mystras and the Morea could become the \\"New Sparta\\", a centralized and strong Hellenic kingdom in its own right. One of the projects of the brothers' plan to strengthen the despotate was the reconstruction of the Hexamilion wall, which was destroyed by the Turks in 1431. Together, they completely restored the wall by March 1444. The project impressed many of their subjects and contemporaries, including the Venetian lords in the Peloponnese, who had politely declined to help with its funding. The restoration had cost much in both money and manpower; many of the Moreot landowners had momentarily fled to Venetian lands to avoid financing the venture while others had rebelled before being compelled through military means. Constantine attempted to attract the loyalty of the Moreot landowners by granting them both further lands and various privileges. He also staged local athletic games, where young Moreots could run races for prizes. The Crusade of Varna, sent to aid the Byzantines against the Ottomans, was crushed by Sultan Murad II at the Battle of Varna (pictured) in 1444 In the summer of 1444, perhaps encouraged by news from the west that a crusade had set out from Hungary in 1443, Constantine invaded the Latin Duchy of Athens, his direct northern neighbor and an Ottoman vassal. Through Sphrantzes, Constantine was in contact with Cardinal Julian Cesarini, who along with W≈Çadys≈Çaw III of Poland and Hungary was one of the leaders of the crusade. Cesarini was made aware of Constantine's intentions and that he was ready to aid the crusade in striking at the Ottomans from the south. Constantine swiftly captured Athens and Thebes, which forced Duke Nerio II Acciaioli to pay the tribute to him instead of the Ottomans. The recapture of Athens was seen as a particularly glorious feat. One of Constantine's counsellors compared the despot to the legendary ancient Athenian general Themistocles. Although the crusading army was destroyed by the Ottoman army led by Murad II at the Battle of Varna on 10 November 1444, Constantine was not deterred. His initial campaign had been remarkably successful and he had also received foreign support from Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy, who had sent him 300 soldiers. With the Burgundian soldiers and his own men, Constantine raided central Greece as far north as the Pindus mountains in Thessaly, where the locals happily welcomed him as their new lord. As Constantine's campaign progressed, one of his governors, Constantine Kantakouzenos, also made his way north, attacked Thessaly, and seized the town of Lidoriki from the Ottomans. The townspeople were so excited at their liberation that they renamed the town to Kantakouzinopolis in his honor. Tiring of Constantine's successes, Murad II, accompanied by Duke Nerio II of Athens, marched on the Morea in 1446, with an army possibly numbering as many as 60,000 men. Despite the overwhelming number of Ottoman troops, Constantine refused to surrender his gains in Greece and instead prepared for battle. The Ottomans quickly restored control over Thessaly; Constantine and Thomas rallied at the Hexamilion wall, which the Ottomans reached on 27 November. Constantine and Thomas were determined to hold the wall and had brought all their available forces, amounting to perhaps as many as 20,000 men, to defend it. Although the wall might have held against the great Ottoman army under normal circumstances, Murad had brought cannons with him and by 10 December, the wall had been reduced to rubble and most of the defenders were either killed or captured; Constantine and Thomas barely escaped the catastrophic defeat. Turahan was sent south to take Mystras and devastate Constantine's lands while Murad II led his forces in the north of the Peloponnese. Although Turahan failed to take Mystras, this was of little consequence as Murad only wanted to instill terror and did not wish to conquer the Morea at the time. The Turks left the peninsula devastated and depopulated. Constantine and Thomas were in no position to ask for a truce and were forced to accept Murad as their lord, pay him tribute, and promise to never again restore the Hexamilion wall.  Reign as emperor  = Accession to the throne = Marble relief of a double-headed eagle in the Church of St. Demetrios in Mystras, marking the spot where Constantine XI was supposedly crowned Theodore, once Despot of the Morea, died in June 1448 and on 31 October that same year, John VIII Palaiologos died in Constantinople. Compared to his other living brothers, Constantine was the most popular of the Palaiologoi, both in the Morea and in the capital. It was well known that John's favored successor was Constantine and ultimately, the will of Helena Draga≈° (who also preferred Constantine), prevailed in the matter. Both Thomas, who appeared to have had no intention of claiming the throne, and Demetrios, who most certainly did, hurried to Constantinople and reached the capital before Constantine left the Morea. Although many favored Demetrios for his anti-unionist sentiment, Helena reserved her right to act as regent until her eldest son, Constantine arrived, and stalled Demetrios' attempt at seizing the throne. Thomas accepted Constantine's appointment and Demetrios was overruled, though he later proclaimed Constantine as his new emperor. Soon thereafter, Sphrantzes informed Sultan Murad II, who also accepted the appointment on 6 December 1448. With the issue of succession peacefully resolved, Helena sent two envoys, Manuel Palaiologos Iagros and Alexios Philanthropenos Laskaris, to the Morea to proclaim Constantine as emperor and bring him to the capital. Thomas also accompanied them. In a small civil ceremony at Mystras, possibly in one of the churches or in the Despot's Palace, on 6 January 1449, Constantine was given the title of Emperor of the Romans. He was not given a crown; instead, Constantine put on a smaller form of imperial headgear, a pilon, on his head with his own hands. Although emperors were traditionally crowned in the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, there was historical precedent for smaller and local ceremonies: centuries ago, Manuel I Komnenos had been given the title of emperor by his dying father, John II Komnenos, in Cilicia; Constantine's great-grandfather, John VI Kantakouzenos, had been proclaimed emperor at Didymoteicho in Thrace. Both Manuel I and John VI had been careful to perform the traditional coronation ceremony in Constantinople once they reached the capital. In Constantine's case, no such ceremony was ever performed. Both Constantine and the Patriarch of Constantinople, Gregory III Mammas, were supporters of the Union of the Churches: a ceremony in which Gregory crowned Constantine emperor might have led the anti-unionists in the capital to rebel. Constantine's rise to emperor was controversial: although he was accepted on account of his lineage with few alternative candidates, his lack of a full coronation and support for the Union of the Churches damaged public perception of the new emperor. Careful not to anger the anti-unionists through being crowned by Gregory III, Constantine believed that his proclamation at Mystras had sufficed as an imperial coronation and had given him all the constitutional rights of the one true emperor. In his earliest known imperial document, a chrysobull from February 1439, he refers to himself as \\"Constantine Palaiologos in Christ true Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans\\". Constantine arrived at Constantinople on 12 March 1449, having been provided means of travel by a Catalan ship. Constantine was well prepared for his accession to the throne after serving as regent twice and ruling numerous fiefs throughout the crumbling empire. By Constantine's time, Constantinople was a shadow of its former glory; the city never truly recovered from the 1204 sack by the crusaders of the Fourth Crusade. Instead of the grand imperial capital it once was, 15th century Constantinople was an almost rural network of population centers, with many of the city's churches and palaces, including the former imperial palace, abandoned and in disrepair. Instead of the former imperial palace, the Palaiologoi emperors used the Palace of Blachernae, located considerably closer to the city's walls, as their main residence. The city's population had declined significantly due to the Latin occupation, the 14th century civil wars, and outbreaks of the Black Death in 1347, 1409 and 1410. By the time Constantine became emperor, only about 50,000 people lived in the city. = Initial concerns = 1/8 stavraton, minted 1448‚Äì1453. One of the last coins minted by the Byzantine Empire, the coin features a bust of Constantine XI (left) and Christ Pantocrator (right). One of Constantine's most pressing concerns was the Ottomans. One of his first acts as emperor, just two weeks after arriving in the capital, was to attempt to secure the empire by arranging a truce with Murad II. He sent an ambassador, Andronikos Iagaris, to the sultan. Iagaris was successful, and the agreed-upon truce also included Constantine's brothers in the Morea to secure the province from further Ottoman attacks. In order to remove his rebellious brother Demetrios from the capital and its vicinity, Constantine had made Demetrios his replacement as Despot of the Morea to rule the despotate alongside Thomas. Demetrios was granted the Constantine's former capital, Mystras, and authority over the southern and eastern parts of the despotate, while Thomas ruled Corinthia and the northwest, alternating between Patras and Leontari as his place of residence. Constantine XI's seal as emperor Constantine tried to hold numerous discussions with the anti-unionists in the capital, who had organized themselves as a synaxis to oppose Patriarch Gregory III's authority, on account of him being a unionist. Constantine was not a fanatical unionist and merely viewed the Union of the Churches as necessary for the empire's survival. The unionists found this argument to be baseless and materialistic, believing that help would be more likely to come through trust in God than a western crusading campaign. Another pressing concern was the continuation of the imperial family as neither Constantine nor his brothers had male children at the time. In February 1449, Constantine had sent Manuel Dishypatos as an envoy to Italy to speak with Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples in order to secure military aid against the Ottomans and forge a marriage alliance. The intended match was the daughter of Alfonso's nephew, Beatrice of Coimbra, but the alliance failed. In October 1449, Constantine sent Sphrantzes to the east to visit the Empire of Trebizond and the Kingdom of Georgia and see if there were any suitable brides there. Sphrantzes, accompanied by a large retinue of priests, nobles, musicians and soldiers, left the capital for nearly two years. While at the court of Emperor John IV Megas Komnenos in Trebizond, Sphrantzes was made aware that Murad II had passed away. Though John IV saw this as positive news, Sphrantzes was more anxious: the old sultan had grown tired and had given up all hope of conquering Constantinople. His young son and successor, Mehmed II, was ambitious, young and energetic. Sphrantzes had the idea that the sultan could be dissuaded from invading Constantinople if Constantine married Murad II's widow, Mara Brankoviƒá. Constantine supported the idea when he received Sphrantzes' report in May 1451 and sent envoys to Serbia, where Mara had returned to after Murad II's death. Many of Constantine's courtiers opposed the idea due to a distrust of the Serbians, causing Constantine to question the viability of the match. Ultimately, the opposition of the courtiers to the marriage proved pointless: Mara had no wish to remarry, as she vowed to live a life of celibacy and chastity for the rest of her life once released from the Ottomans. Sphrantzes then decided that a Georgian bride would suit the emperor best and returned to Constantinople in September 1451, bringing a Georgian ambassador with him. Constantine thanked Sphrantzes for his efforts and they agreed that Sphrantzes was to return to Georgia in the spring of 1452 and forge a marriage alliance. Due to mounting tensions with the Ottomans, Sphrantzes ultimately did not return to Georgia. On 23 March 1450, Helena Draga≈° passed away. She was highly respected among the Byzantines and was mourned deeply. Gemistus Pletho, the Moreot philosopher previously at Constantine's court in the Morea, and Gennadios Scholarios, future Patriarch of Constantinople, both wrote funeral orations praising her. Pletho praised Helena's fortitude and intellect, and compared her to legendary Greek heroine Penelope on account of her prudence. Constantine's other advisors were often at odds with the emperor and each other. Her death left Constantine unsure of which advisor to rely on the most. Andronikos Palaiologos Kantakouzenos, the megas domestikos (or commander-in-chief), disagreed with the emperor on a number of matters, including the decision to marry a Georgian princess instead of an imperial princess from Trebizond. The most powerful figure at the court was Loukas Notaras, an experienced statesman and megas doux (commander-in-chief of the navy). Although Sphrantzes disliked Notaras, he was a close friend of Constantine. As the Byzantine Empire no longer had a navy, Notaras' position was more of an informal prime minister- type role than a position of military command. Notaras believed that Constantinople's massive defenses would stall any attack on the city and allow western Christians to aid them in time. Due to his influence and friendship with the emperor, Constantine was likely influenced by his hopes and ideas. Sphrantzes was promoted to \\"First Lord of the Imperial Wardrobe\\": his office gave him near unhindered access to the imperial residence and a position to influence the emperor. Sphrantzes was even more cautious towards the Ottomans than Notaras, and believed the megas doux risked antagonizing the new sultan. Although Sphrantzes also approved of appealing to the west for aid, he believed that any appeals had to be highly discreet in order to avoid Ottoman attention. = Search for allies = Political map of the eastern Mediterranean in 1450 Shortly after Murad II's death, Constantine was quick to send envoys to the new sultan Mehmed II in an attempt to arrange a new truce. Mehmed supposedly received Constantine's envoys with great respect and put their minds to rest through swearing by Allah, the Prophet Muhammad, the Quran, and the angels and archangels that he would live in peace with the Byzantines and their emperor for the rest of his life. Constantine was unconvinced and suspected that Mehmed's mood could abruptly change in the future. In order to prepare for the future possibility of Ottoman attack, Constantine needed to secure alliances and the most powerful realms that might be inclined to aid him were in the West. The nearest and most concerned potential ally was Venice, which operated a large commercial colony in their quarter of Constantinople. However, the Venetians were not to be trusted. During the first few months of his rule as emperor, Constantine had raised the taxes on the goods the Venetians imported to Constantinople since the imperial treasury was nearly empty and funds had to be raised through some means. In August 1450, the Venetians had threatened to transfer their trade to another port, perhaps one under Ottoman control, and despite Constantine writing to the Doge of Venice, Francesco Foscari, in October 1450, the Venetians were unconvinced and signed a formal treaty with Mehmed II in 1451. To annoy the Venetians, Constantine attempted to seal a deal with the Republic of Ragusa in 1451, offering them a place to trade in Constantinople with limited tax concessions, though the Ragusans could offer little military aid to the empire. Most of the kingdoms in Western Europe were occupied with their own wars at the time and the crushing defeat at the Battle of Varna had quelled most of the crusading spirit. The news that Murad II had died and been succeeded by his young son also lulled the western Europeans into a false sense of security. To the papacy, the Union of the Churches was a far more pressing concern than the threat of Ottoman attack. In August 1451, Constantine's ambassador Andronikos Bryennios Leontaris arrived in Rome to deliver a letter to Pope Nicholas V, which contained a statement from the anti-unionist synaxis at Constantinople. Constantine hoped that the Pope would read the letter and understand Constantine's difficulties with making the Union of the Churches a reality in the east. The letter contained the synaxis's proposal that a new council be held at Constantinople, with an equal number of representatives from both churches (since the Orthodox had been heavily outnumbered at the previous council). On 27 September, Nicholas V replied to Constantine after he heard that the unionist Patriarch Gregory III had resigned following the opposition against him. Nicholas V merely wrote that Constantine had to try harder to convince his people and clergy and that the price of further military aid from the west was full acceptance of the union achieved at Florence; the name of the Pope had to be commemorated in the churches in Greece and Gregory III had to be reinstated as patriarch. The ultimatum was a setback for Constantine, who had done his best to enforce the union without inciting riots in Constantinople. The Pope appeared to have completely ignored the sentiment of the anti-unionist synaxis. Nicholas V sent a papal legate, Cardinal Isidore of Kiev, to Constantinople to attempt to help Constantine enforce the union, but Isidore did not arrive until October 1452, when the city faced more pressing concerns. = Dealings with Mehmed II = Portrait of Sultan Mehmed II by Gentile Bellini (1480) A great-grandson of Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I, Orhan √áelebi, lived as a hostage in Constantinople. Other than Mehmed II, Orhan was the only known living male member of the Ottoman dynasty, and thus was a potential rival claimant to the sultanate. Mehmed had previously agreed to pay annually for Orhan being kept at Constantinople, but in 1451, Constantine sent a message to the sultan complaining that the payment was not sufficient and hinted that unless more money was paid, Orhan might be released, possibly sparking an Ottoman civil war. The strategy of attempting to use hostage Ottoman princes had been used before by Constantine's father Manuel II, but it was a risky one. Mehmed's grand vizier, √áandarlƒ± Halil Pasha, received the message at Bursa and was appalled at the threat, considering the Byzantine to be inept. Pasha had long been relied upon by the Byzantines, through bribes and friendship, to maintain peaceful relations with the Ottomans, but his influence over Mehmed was limited and he was ultimately loyal to the Ottomans, not the Byzantines. Because of the blatant provocation to the sultan, he lost his temper with the Byzantine messengers, supposedly shouting: Constantine and his advisors had catastrophically misjudged the determination of the new sultan. Throughout his brief reign, Constantine and his advisors had been unable to form an effective foreign policy towards the Ottoman Empire. Constantine mainly continued the policy of his predecessors, doing what he could to brace Constantinople for attack, but also alternated between supplicating and confronting the Ottomans. Constantine's advisors had little knowledge and expertise on the Ottoman court and disagreed in how to deal with the Ottoman threat and as Constantine wavered between the opinions of his different councilors, his policy towards Murad and Mehmed was not coherent and resulted in disaster. Mehmed II considered Constantine to have broken the terms of their 1449 truce and quickly revoked the small concessions he had given to the Byzantines. The threat of releasing Orhan gave Mehmed a pretext for concentrating all of his efforts on seizing Constantinople, his true goal since he had become sultan. Mehmed believed that the conquest of Constantinople was essential to the survival of the Ottoman state: by taking the city, he would prevent any potential crusade from using it as a base and prevent it falling into the hands of a rival more dangerous than the Byzantines. Furthermore, Mehmed had an intense interest in ancient Greco-Roman and medieval Byzantine history, his childhood heroes being figures like Achilles and Alexander the Great. The Rumelihisarƒ± castle, seen from the Bosphorus strait Mehmed began preparations immediately. In the spring of 1452, work had begun on the Rumelihisarƒ± castle, constructed on the western side of the Bosporus strait, opposite to the already existing Anadoluhisarƒ± castle on the eastern side. With the two castles, Mehmed could control sea traffic in the Bosporus and could blockade Constantinople both by land and sea. Constantine, horrified by the implications of the construction project, protested that Mehmed's grandfather Mehmed I had respectfully asked the permission of Emperor Manuel II before constructing the eastern castle and reminded the sultan of their existing truce. Based on his actions in the Morea, especially during at the time of the Crusade of Varna, Constantine was clearly anti-Turkish and he preferred himself to take aggressive action against the Ottoman Empire; his attempts to appeal to Mehmed were simply a stalling tactic. Mehmed's response to Constantine was that the area he built the fortress on had been uninhabited and that Constantine owned nothing outside of Constantinople's walls. As panic ensued in Constantinople, the Rumelihisarƒ± was completed in August 1452, intended not only to serve as a means to blockade Constantinople but also as the base from which Mehmed's conquest of Constantinople was to be directed. To clear the site of the new castle, some local churches were demolished, which angered the local Greek populace. Mehmed had them massacred. The Ottomans had sent some animals to graze on Byzantine farmland on the shores of the Sea of Marmara, which also angered the locals. When the Greek farmers protested, Mehmed sent his troops to attack them, killing about forty. Outraged, Constantine formally declared war on Mehmed II, closing the gates of Constantinople and arresting all Turks within the city walls. Seeing the futility in this move, Constantine renounced his actions three days later and set the prisoners free. After the capture of several Italian ships and the execution of their crews during Mehmed's eventual siege of Constantinople, Constantine reluctantly ordered the execution of all Turks within the city walls. Constantine began to prepare for what was at best a blockade, and at worst a siege, gathering provisions and working to repair Constantinople's walls. Manuel Palaiologos Iagros, one of the envoys who had invested Constantine as emperor in 1449, was put in charge of the restoration of the formidable walls, a project which was completed late in 1452. He sent more urgent requests for aid to the west. Near the end of 1451, he had sent a message to Venice stating that unless they sent reinforcements to him at once, Constantinople would fall to the Ottomans. Although the Venetians were sympathetic to the Byzantine cause, they explained in their reply in February 1452 that although they could ship armor and gunpowder to him, they had no troops to spare as they were fighting against neighboring city-states in Italy at the time. When the Ottomans sank a Venetian trading ship in the Bosporus in November 1452 and executed the ship's survivors on account of the ship refusing to pay a new toll instituted by Mehmed, the Venetian attitude changed as they now also found themselves at war with the Ottomans. Desperate for aid, Constantine sent pleas for reinforcements to his brothers in the Morea and Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples, promising the latter the island of Lemnos if he brought help. The Hungarian warrior John Hunyadi was invited to help and was promised Selymbria or Mesembria if he came with aid. The Genoese on the island Chios were also sent a plea, being promised payment in return for military assistance. Constantine received little practical response to his pleas. = Religious disunity in Constantinople = Cardinal Isidore of Kiev, sent as a papal legate to Constantinople in October 1452 Above all, Constantine sent many appeals for aid to Pope Nicholas V. Although sympathetic, Nicholas V believed that the papacy could not go to the rescue of the Byzantines unless they fully accepted the Union of the Churches and his spiritual authority. Furthermore, he knew that the papacy alone could not do much against the formidable Ottoman Turks, a similar response to one given by Venice, which promised military assistance only if others in Western Europe also came to Constantinople's defense. On 26 October 1452, Nicholas V's legate, Isidore of Kiev, arrived at Constantinople together with the Latin Archbishop of Mytilene, Leonard of Chios. With them, they brought a small force of 200 Neapolitan archers. Though they made little difference in coming battle, the reinforcements were probably more appreciated by Constantinople's citizens than the actual purpose of Isidore's and Leonard's visit; cementing the Union of the Churches. Their arrival in the city spurred the anti- unionists into a frenzy. On 13 September 1452, a month before Isidore and Leonard arrived, the lawyer and anti-unionist Theodore Agallianos had written a short chronicle of contemporary events, concluding with the following words: Constantine and John VIII before him had badly misjudged the level of opposition against the church union. Loukas Notaras was successful in calming down the situation in Constantinople somewhat, explaining to an assembly of nobles that the Catholic visit was made with good intentions and that the soldiers who had accompanied Isidore and Leonard might just be an advance guard; more military aid might have been on its way. Many nobles were convinced that a spiritual price could be paid for material rewards and that if they were rescued from the immediate danger, there would be time later to think more clearly in a calmer atmosphere. Sphrantzes suggested to Constantine that he name Isidore as the new Patriarch of Constantinople as Gregory III had not been seen for some time and was unlikely to return. Although such an appointment might have gratified the pope and led to further aid being sent, Constantine realized that it would only stir up the anti-unionists more. Once the people of Constantinople realized that no further immediate aid in addition to the 200 soldiers was coming from the papacy, they rioted in the streets. Leonard of Chios confided in the emperor that he believed him to be far too lenient with the anti-unionists, urging him to arrest their leaders and try harder to push back the opposition to the Union of the Churches. Constantine opposed the idea, perhaps under the assumption that arresting the leaders would turn them into martyrs for their cause. Instead, Constantine summoned the leaders of the synaxis to the imperial palace on 15 November 1452, and once again asked them to write a document with their objections to the union achieved at Florence, which they were eager to do. On 25 November, the Ottomans sank another Venetian trading ship with cannon fire from the new Rumelihisarƒ± castle, an event which captured the minds of the Byzantines and united them in fear and panic. As a result, the anti-unionist cause gradually died down. On 12 December, a Catholic liturgy commemorating the names of the Pope and Patriarch Gregory III was held in the Hagia Sophia by Isidore. Constantine and his court were present, as was a large number of the city's citizens (Isidore stated that all of its inhabitants attended the ceremony). = Final preparations = Modern painting of Mehmed II and his army approaching Constantinople, by Fausto Zonaro (1903) Constantine's brothers in the Morea could not bring him any help: Turahan had been called on by Mehmed to invade and devastate the Morea again in October 1452 to keep the two despots occupied. The Morea was devastated, with Constantine's brothers only achieving one small success with the capture of Turahan's son, Ahmed, in battle. Constantine then had to rely on the only other parties which had expressed interest in aiding him: Venice, the pope, and Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples. Although Venice had been slow to act, the Venetians in Constantinople acted immediately without waiting for orders when the Ottomans sank their ships. The Venetian bailie in Constantinople, Girolamo Minotto, called an emergency meeting with the Venetians in the city, which was also attended by Constantine and Cardinal Isidore. Most of the Venetians voted to stay in Constantinople and aid the Byzantines in their defense of the city, agreeing that no Venetian ships were to leave Constantinople's harbor. The decision of the local Venetians to stay and die for the city had a significantly greater effect on the Venetian government than Constantine's pleas. In February 1453, Doge Foscari ordered the preparation of warships and army recruitment, both of which were to head for Constantinople in April. He sent letters to the pope, Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples, King Ladislaus V of Hungary, and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III to inform them that unless Western Christianity acted, Constantinople would fall to the Ottomans. Though the increase in diplomatic activity was impressive, it came too late to save Constantinople: the equipment and financing of a joint papal-Venetian armada took longer than expected, the Venetians had misjudged the amount of time on their hands, and messages took at least a month to travel from Constantinople to Venice. Emperor Frederick III's only response to the crisis was a letter sent to Mehmed II in which he threatened the sultan with an attack from all of western Christendom unless the sultan demolished the Rumelihisarƒ± castle and abandoned his plans to Constantinople. Constantine continued to hope for help and sent more letters in early 1453 to Venice and Alfonso V, asking not only for soldiers but also food as his people were beginning to suffer from the Ottoman blockade of the city. Alfonso responded to his plea by quickly sending a ship with provisions. Restored section of the Walls of Constantinople Throughout the long winter of 1452‚Äì1453, Constantine ordered the citizens of Constantinople to restore the city's imposing walls and gather as many weapons as they could. Ships were sent to the islands still under Byzantine rule to gather further supplies and provisions. The defenders grew anxious as the news of a huge cannon at the Ottoman camp that was assembled by the Hungarian engineer Orban reached the city. Loukas Notaras was given command of the walls along the sea walls of the Golden Horn and various sons of the Palaiologos and Kantakouzenos family were appointed to man other positions. Many of the city's foreign inhabitants, notably the Venetians, offered their aid. Constantine asked them to man the battlements to show the Ottomans how many defenders they were to face. When the Venetians offered their service to guard four of the city's land gates, Constantine accepted and entrusted them with the keys. Some of the city's Genoese population also aided the Byzantines. In January 1453, notable Genoese aid arrived voluntarily in the form of Giovanni Giustiniani‚Äîa renowned soldier known for his skill in siege warfare‚Äîand 700 soldiers under his command. Giustiniani was appointed by Constantine as the general commander for the walls on Constantinople's land side. Giustiniani was given the rank of protostrator and promised the island of Lemnos as a reward (though it had already been promised to Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples, should he come to the city's aid). In addition to the limited western aid, Orhan √áelebi, the Ottoman contender held as a hostage in the city, and his considerable retinue of Ottoman troops, also assisted in the city's defense. On 2 April 1453, Mehmed's advance guard arrived outside Constantinople and began pitching up a camp. On 5 April, the sultan himself arrived at the head of his army and encamped within firing rage of the city's Gate of St. Romanus. Bombardment of the city walls began almost immediately on 6 April. Most estimates of the number of soldiers defending Constantinople's walls in 1453 range from 6,000‚Äì8,500, out of which 5,000‚Äì6,000 were Greeks, most of whom were untrained militia soldiers. An additional 1,000 Byzantine soldiers were kept as reserves inside the city. Mehmed's army massively outnumbered the Christian defenders; his forces might have been as many as 80,000 men, including about 5,000 elite janissaries. Even then, Constantinople's fall was not inevitable; the strength of the walls made the Ottoman numerical advantage irrelevant at first and under other circumstances, the Byzantines and their allies could have survived until help arrived. The Ottoman use of cannons intensified and sped up the siege considerably.  Fall of Constantinople  = Siege = Map of Constantinople and the dispositions of the defenders and the besiegers in 1453 An Ottoman fleet attempted to get into the Golden Horn while Mehmed began bombarding Constantinople's land walls. Foreseeing this possibility, Constantine had constructed a massive chain laid across the Golden Horn which prevented the fleet's passage. The chain was only lifted temporarily a few days after the siege began to allow the passage of three Genoese ships sent by the papacy and a large ship with food sent by Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples. The arrival of these ships on 20 April, and the failure of the Ottomans to stop them, was a significant victory for the Christians and significantly increased their morale. The ships, carrying soldiers, weapons and supplies, had passed by Mehmed's scouts alongside the Bosphorus unnoticed. Mehmed ordered his admiral, Suleiman Baltoghlu, to capture the ships and their crews at all costs. As the naval battle between the smaller Ottoman ships and the large western ships commenced, Mehmed rode his horse into the water to shout unhelpful naval commands to Baltoghlu, who pretended not to hear them. Baltoghlu withdrew the smaller ships so that the few large Ottoman vessels could fire on the western ships, but the Ottoman cannons were too low to do damage to the crews and decks and their shots were too small to seriously damage the hulls. As the sun set, the wind suddenly returned and the ships passed through the Ottoman blockade, aided by three Venetian ships which had sailed out to meet and cover them. The sea walls were weaker than Constantinople's land walls, and Mehmed was determined to get his fleet into the Golden Horn; he needed some way to circumvent Constantine's chain. On 23 April, the defenders of Constantinople observed the Ottoman fleet managed to get into the Golden Horn by being pulled across a massive series of tracks, constructed on Mehmed's orders, across the hill behind Galata, the Genoese colony on the opposite side of the Bosporus. Although the Venetians attempted to attack the ships and set fire to them, their attempt was unsuccessful. Ottoman fleet being transported over land to the Golden Horn, by Fausto Zonaro (1903) As the siege progressed, it became clearer that the forces defending the city would not be enough to man both the sea walls and the land walls. Furthermore, food was running out and as food prices rose to compensate, many of the poor began to starve. On Constantine's orders, the Byzantine garrison collected money from churches, monasteries and private residences to pay for food for the poor. Objects of precious metal held by the churches were seized and melted down, though Constantine promised the clergy that he would repay them four-fold once the battle had been won. The Ottomans bombarded the city's outer walls continuously, and eventually opened up a small breach which exposed the inner defenses. Constantine grew more and more anxious. He sent messages begging to sultan to withdraw, promising whatever amount of tribute he wanted, but Mehmed was determined to take the city. The sultan supposedly responded: To Constantine, the idea of abandoning Constantinople was unthinkable. He did not bother to reply to the sultan's suggestion. Some days after offering Constantine the chance to surrender, Mehmed sent a new messenger to address the citizens of Constantinople, imploring them to surrender and save themselves from death or slavery. The sultan informed them that he would let them live as they were, in exchange for an annual tribute, or allow them to leave the city unharmed with their belongings. Some of Constantine's companions and councilors implored him to escape the city, rather than die in its defense: if he escaped unharmed, Constantine could set up an empire-in-exile in the Morea or somewhere else and carry on the war against the Ottomans. Constantine did not accept their ideas; he refused to be remembered as the emperor who ran away. According to later chroniclers, Constantine's response to the idea of escaping was the following: Constantine then sent a response to the sultan, the last communication between a Byzantine emperor and an Ottoman sultan: The only hope the citizens could cling to was the news that the Venetian fleet was on its way to relieve Constantinople. When a Venetian reconnaissance ship that had slipped through the Ottoman blockade returned to the city to report that no relief force had been seen, it was made clear that the few forces that had gathered at Constantinople would have to fight the Ottoman army alone. The news that the whole of Christendom appeared to have deserted them unnerved some of the Venetians and Genoese defenders and in-fighting broke out between them, forcing Constantine to remind them that there were more important enemies at hand. Constantine resolved to commit himself and the city to the mercy of Christ; if the city fell, it would be God's will. = Final days and final assault = miniature by Jean Le Tavernier painted sometime after 1455 The Byzantines observed strange and ominous signs in the days leading up to the final Ottoman assault on the city. On 22 May, there was a lunar eclipse for three hours, harkening to a prophecy that Constantinople would fall when the moon was on wane. In order to encourage the defenders, Constantine commanded that the icon of Mary, the city's protector, was to be carried in a procession through the streets. The procession was abandoned when the icon slipped from its frame and the weather turned to rain and hail. Carrying out the procession on the next day was impossible as the city became engulfed in a thick fog. On 26 May, the Ottomans held a war council. √áandarlƒ± Halil Pasha, who believed western military aid to the city was imminent, counseled Mehmed to compromise with the Byzantines and withdraw whereas Zagan Pasha, a military officer, urged the sultan to push on and pointed out that Alexander the Great had conquered almost the entire known world when he was young. Perhaps knowing that they would support a final assault, Mehmed ordered Zagan to tour the camp and gather the opinions of the soldiers. On the evening of 26 May, the dome of the Hagia Sophia was lit up by a strange and mysterious light phenomenon, also spotted by the Ottomans from their camp outside the city. The Ottomans saw it as a great omen for their victory and the Byzantines saw it as a sign of impending doom. 28 May was calm, as Mehmed had ordered a day of rest before his final assault. The citizens who had not been put to work on repairing the crumbling walls or manning them prayed in the streets. On Constantine's orders, icons and relics from all the monasteries and churches in the city were carried along the walls. Both Catholics and Orthodox defenders joined together in prayers and hymns and Constantine led the procession himself. Giustiniani sent word to Loukas Notaras to request that Notaras' artillery be brought to defend the land walls, which Notaras refused. Giustiniani accused Notaras of treachery and they almost fought each other before Constantine intervened. In the evening, the crowds moved to the Hagia Sophia, with Orthodox and Catholic Christians joining together and praying, the fear of impending doom having done more to unite them than the councils ever could. Cardinal Isidore was in attendance, as was Emperor Constantine. Constantine prayed and asked for forgiveness and remission of his sins from all the bishops there before he received communion at the church's altar. The emperor then left the church, going to the imperial palace and asking his household there for forgiveness and saying farewell to them before again disappearing into the night, going to make a final inspection of the soldiers manning the city walls. Without warning, the Ottomans began their final assault in the early hours of 29 May. The service in the Hagia Sophia was interrupted, with fighting-age men rushing to the walls to defend the city and the other men and women helping the parts of the army stationed within the city. Waves of Mehmed's troops charged at Constantinople's land walls, hammering at the weakest section for more than two hours. Despite the relentless attack, the defense, led by Giustiniani and supported by Constantine, held firm. Unbeknownst to anyone, after six hours of fighting, just before sunrise, Giustiniani was mortally wounded. Constantine begged Giustiniani to stay and continue fighting, allegedly saying: Giustiniani was too weak, however, and his bodyguards carried him to the harbor and escaped the city on a Genoese ship. The Genoese troops wavered when they saw their commander leave them, and though the Byzantine defenders fought on, the Ottomans soon gained control of both the outer and inner walls. About fifty Ottoman soldiers made it through one of the gates, the Kerkoporta, and were the first of the enemy to enter Constantinople; it had been left unlocked and ajar by a Venetian party the night before. Ascending up the tower above the Kerkoporta, they managed to raise an Ottoman flag above the wall. The Ottomans stormed through the wall and many of the defenders panicked with no means of escape. Constantinople had fallen. Giustiniani died of his wounds on his way home. Loukas Notaras was initially captured alive before being executed shortly after. Cardinal Isidore disguised himself as a slave and escaped across the Golden Horn to Galata. Orhan, Mehmed's cousin, disguised himself as a monk in an attempt to escape, but was identified and killed. = Death = Romanticized depiction of the final fighting at the Fall of Constantinople by Greek folk painter Theophilos Hatzimihail (1932). Constantine is depicted as charging into battle on a white horse. Constantine died the day Constantinople fell. There were no known surviving eyewitnesses to the death of the emperor and none of his entourage survived to offer any credible account of his death. The Greek historian Michael Critobulus, who later worked in the service of Mehmed, wrote that Constantine died fighting the Ottomans. Later Greek historians accepted Critobulus's account, never doubting that Constantine died as a hero and martyr, an idea never seriously questioned in the Greek-speaking world. Though none of the authors were eyewitnesses, a vast majority of those who wrote of Constantinople's fall, both Christians and Muslims, agree that Constantine died in the battle, with only three accounts claiming that the emperor escaped the city. It also seems probable that his body was later found and decapitated. According to Critobulus, the last words of Constantine before he charged at the Ottomans were \\"the city is fallen and I am still alive\\". An icon of Constantine XI There were other conflicting contemporary accounts of Constantine's demise. Leonard of Chios, who was taken prisoner by the Ottomans but later managed to escape, wrote that once Giustiniani had fled the battle, Constantine's courage failed and the emperor implored his young officers to kill him so that he would not be captured alive by the Ottomans. None of the soldiers were brave enough to kill the emperor and once the Ottomans broke through, Constantine fell in the ensuing fight, only to briefly get up before falling again and being trampled. The Venetian physician Niccol√≤ Barbaro, who was present at the siege, wrote that no one knew if the emperor had died or escaped the city alive, noting that some said that his corpse had been seen among the dead while others claimed that he had hanged himself as soon as the Ottomans had broken through at the St. Romanus gate. Cardinal Isidore wrote, like Critobulus, that Constantine had died fighting at the St. Romanus gate. Isidore also added that he had heard that the Ottomans had found his body, cut off his head and presented it to Mehmed as a gift, who was delighted and showered the head with insults before taking it with him to Adrianople as a trophy. Jacopo Tedaldi, a merchant from Florence who participated in the final fight, wrote that \\"some say that his head was cut off; others that he perished in the crush at the gate. Both stories may well be true\\". Ottoman accounts of Constantine's demise all agree that the emperor was decapitated. Tursun Beg, who was part of Mehmed's army at the battle, wrote a less heroic account of Constantine's death than the Christian authors. According to Tursun, Constantine panicked and fled, making for the harbor in hopes of finding a ship to escape the city. On his way there, he came across a band of Turkish marines, and after charging and nearly killing one of them, was decapitated. A later account by Ottoman historian Ibn Kemal is similar to Tursun's account, but states that the emperor's head was cut off not just by an unnamed marine, but by a giant of a man, who killed Constantine without realizing who he was. Nicola Sagundino, a Venetian who had once been a prisoner of the Ottomans following their conquest of Thessaloniki decades before, gave an account of Constantine's death to Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples in 1454 since he believed that the emperor's fate \\"deserved to be recorded and remembered for all time\\". Sagundino stated that although Giustiniani implored the emperor to escape as he was carried away after falling on the battlefield, Constantine refused and preferred to die with his empire. Constantine went to where the fighting appeared to be thickest and, as it would be unworthy of him to be captured alive, implored his officers to kill him. When none of them obeyed his command, Constantine threw off his imperial regalia, as to not let himself be distinguished from the other soldiers, and disappeared into the fray, sword in hand. When Mehmed wanted the defeated Constantine to be brought to him, he was told it was too late as the emperor was dead. A search for the body was conducted, and when it was found, the emperor's head was cut off and paraded through Constantinople before it was sent to the Sultan of Egypt as a gift, alongside twenty captured women and forty captured men.  Legacy  = Historiography = classical Greco-Roman armor Constantine's death marked the end of the Byzantine Empire, an institution tracing its origin to Constantine the Great's foundation of Constantinople as the Roman Empire's new capital in 330. Even as their realm gradually became more restricted to only Greek-speaking lands, the people of the Byzantine Empire continually maintained that they were Romaioi (Romans), not Hellenes (Greeks); as such, Constantine's death also marked the definitive end of the Roman Empire that was founded by Augustus almost 1,500 years earlier. Constantine's death and the Fall of Constantinople also marked the true birth of the Ottoman Empire, which dominated much of the eastern Mediterranean until its fall in 1922. The conquest of Constantinople had been a dream of Islamic armies since the 8th century and through its possession, Mehmed II and his successors were able to claim to be the heirs of the Roman emperors. There is no evidence that Constantine ever rejected the hated union of the Churches achieved at Florence in 1439 after spending a lot of energy to realize it. Many of his subjects had chastised him as a traitor and heretic while he lived and he, like many of his predecessors before him, died in communion with the Church of Rome. Nevertheless, Constantine's actions during the Fall of Constantinople and his death fighting the Turks redeemed the popular view of him. The Greeks forgot or ignored that Constantine had died a \\"heretic\\", and many considered him a martyr. In the eyes of the Orthodox Church, Constantine's death sanctified him and he died a hero. In Athens, the modern capital of Greece, there are two statues of Constantine: a colossal monument depicting the emperor on horseback on the waterfront of Palaio Faliro, and a smaller statue in the city's cathedral square, which portrays the emperor on foot with a drawn sword. There are no statues of emperors such as Basil II or Alexios I Komnenos, who were significantly more successful and died of natural causes after long and glorious reigns. Scholarly works on Constantine and the fall of Constantinople tend to portray Constantine, his advisors, and companions as victims of the events that surrounded the city's fall. There are three main works that deal with Constantine and his life: the earliest is ƒåedomilj Mijatoviƒá's Constantine Palaeologus (1448‚Äì1453) or The Conquest of Constantinople by the Turks (1892), written at a time when tensions were rising between the relatively new Kingdom of Greece and the Ottoman Empire. War appeared imminent and Mijatoviƒá's work was intended to serve as propaganda for the Greek cause by portraying Constantine as a tragic victim of events he had no possibility of affecting. The text is dedicated to the young Prince Constantine, of the same name as the old emperor and the heir to the Greek throne, and its preface states that \\"Constantinople may soon again change masters\\", alluding to the possibility that Greece might conquer the ancient city. The second major work on Constantine, Steven Runciman's The Fall of Constantinople 1453 (1965), also characterizes Constantine through Constantinople's fall, portraying Constantine as tragic figure who did everything to save his empire from the Ottomans. However, Runciman partly blames Constantine for antagonizing Mehmed II through his threats concerning Orhan. The third major work, Donald Nicol's The Immortal Emperor: The Life and Legend of Constantine Palaiologos, Last Emperor of the Romans (1992), examines Constantine's entire life and analyzes the trials and hardships he faced not only as emperor, but as Despot of the Morea as well. Nicol's work places considerably less emphasis on the importance of individuals than the preceding works do, though Constantine is again portrayed as a mostly tragic figure. A less positive assessment of Constantine was given by Marios Philippides in Constantine XI Draga≈° Palaeologus (1404‚Äì1453): The Last Emperor of Byzantium (2019). Philippides sees no evidence that Constantine was a great statesman or a great soldier. Although the emperor had visions for his reign, Philippides deems him as diplomatically ineffective and unable to inspire the support of his people to achieve his goals. Philippides is highly critical of Nicol's The Immortal Emperor, which he sees as unbalanced. In his book, Philippides points out that Constantine's reconquest of the Morea from the Latins had mostly been achieved through marriages and not military victories. Though much of Philippides' work relies on primary sources, some of his negative assessment seems speculative; he suggests that Constantine's campaigns in the Morea made the peninsula \\"easier prey for the Turks\\", something that cannot be substantiated through the actual events that unfolded. = Legends of Constantine's family = Statue of Constantine XI in Athens Constantine's two marriages were brief and though he had attempted to find a third wife before the Fall of Constantinople, he died unmarried and without children. His closest surviving relatives were his surviving brothers in the Morea: Thomas and Demetrios. Despite this, there was a persistent story that Constantine had left a widow and several daughters. The earliest documented evidence of this idea can be found in a letter by Aeneas Silvius (the future Pope Pius II) to Pope Nicholas V, dated July 1453. In Aeneas's Cosmographia (1456‚Äì1457), the story is elaborated upon: Mehmed II supposedly defiled and murdered the empress and Constantine's daughters in the celebrations after his victory. Aeneas also wrote of an imaginary son of Constantine who escaped to Galata, across the Golden Horn. The story of Constantine's wife and daughters might have been further propagated through the spread of the late 15th-century or early 16th- century Russian tale Nestor Iskander's Tale on the Taking of Tsargrad, where a similar account appears. 16th-century French chronicler Mathieu d'Escouchy wrote that Mehmed raped the empress in the Hagia Sophia and then confined her to his harem. The story of Constantine's supposed family survived into modern Greek folklore. One story, propagated until as late as the 20th century, was that Constantine's supposed empress had been six months pregnant at the time of Constantinople's fall and that a son had been born to her while Mehmed was warring in the north. The empress raised the boy, and though he was well- versed in the Christian faith and the Greek language in his youth, he turned to Islam as an adult and eventually became sultan himself, which meant that all Ottoman sultans after him would have been Constantine's descendants. Though the circumstances are completely fictional, the story might carry a shred of the truth; a grandson of Constantine's brother Thomas, Andreas Palaiologos, lived in Constantinople in the 16th century, converted to Islam and served as an Ottoman court official. Another late folk story said that Constantine's empress had shut herself in the imperial palace after Mehmed's victory. After the Ottomans failed to break her barricades and enter the palace, Mehmed had to agree to give her three concessions: that all coins minted by the sultans in the city would bear the names of Constantinople or Constantine, that there would be a street reserved for Greeks alone, and that the bodies of the Christian dead would be given funerals according to Christian custom. = Lamentations = Constantine XI as depicted in 1584 by Andr√© Thevet The Fall of Constantinople shocked Christians throughout Europe. In Orthodox Christianity, Constantinople and the Hagia Sophia became symbols of lost grandeur. In the Russian Nestor Iskander tale, the foundation of Constantinople (the New Rome) by Constantine the Great and its loss under an emperor by the same name was not seen as a coincidence, but as the fulfilling of the city's destiny, just as Old Rome had been founded by Romulus and lost under Romulus Augustulus. Andronikos Kallistos, a prominent 15th-century Greek scholar and Byzantine refugee to Italy, wrote a text entitled Monodia in which he laments the fall of Constantinople and mourns Constantine Palaiologos, whom he refers to as \\"a ruler more perceptive than Themistocles, more fluent than Nestor, wiser than Cyrus, more just than Rhadamanthus and braver than Hercules\\". The 1453 Greek long poem Capture of the City, of uncertain authorship, laments the bad luck of Constantine, which the author blames on Constantine's ill-advised destruction of Glarentza (including its churches) in the 1420s. According to the author, all of Constantine's other misfortunes‚Äîthe destruction of the Hexamilion wall, the death of his brother John VIII, and the Fall of Constantinople‚Äîwere the result of what happened at Glarentza. Even then, Constantine was not to blame for Constantinople's fall: he had done what he could and ultimately relied on help from Western Europe that never came. The poem concludes that people say Constantine died by his own sword, and ends with personally addressing the dead emperor: = The Marble Emperor = National Historical Museum in Athens In 15th-century Byzantine historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles's The Histories, Chalkokondyles finished his account of Byzantine history with hope for a time when a Christian emperor would rule over the Greeks again. In the late 15th century, a legend originated among the Greeks that Constantine had not actually died, but was merely asleep and was waiting on a call from heaven to come and rescue his people. This legend eventually became the legend of the \\"Marble Emperor\\" (Greek: Marmaromenos Vasilias, lit. the \\"Emperor/King turned into Marble\\"). Constantine Palaiologos, hero of the final Christian days of Constantinople, had not died, but had been rescued, turned into marble and immortalized by an angel moments before he was to be killed by the Ottomans. The angel then hid him in a secret cave beneath the Golden Gate of Constantinople (where emperors in the past had marched during triumphs), where he awaits the angel's call to awaken and retake the city. The Turks later walled up the Golden Gate, explained by the story as a precaution against Constantine's eventual resurrection: when God wills Constantinople to be restored, the angel will descend from heaven, resurrect Constantine, give him the sword he used in the final battle and Constantine will then march into his city and restore his fallen empire, driving the Turks as far away as the \\"Red Apple Tree\\", their legendary homeland. According to the legend, Constantine's resurrection would be heralded by the bellowing of a great ox. The story can be seen depicted in a series of seventeen miniatures in a 1590 chronicle by Cretan historian and painter George Klontzas. Klontzas' miniatures show the emperor sleeping beneath Constantinople and guarded by angels, being crowned once more in the Hagia Sophia, entering the imperial palace and then fighting a string of battles against the Turks. Following his inevitable victories, Constantine prays at Kayseri, marches on Palestine and returns triumphant to Constantinople before entering Jerusalem. At Jerusalem, Constantine delivers his crown and the True Cross to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and finally travels to Calvary, where he dies, his mission completed. In the final miniature, Constantine is buried in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1625, Thomas Roe, an English diplomat, sought permission from the Ottoman government to remove some of the stones from the walled-up Golden Gate to send them to his friend, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, who was collecting antiquities. Roe was denied permission and observed that the Turks had some sort of superstitious dread of the gate, recording that the statues placed on it by the Turks were enchanted and that if they were destroyed or taken down, a \\"great alteration\\" would occur to the city. The prophecy of the Marble Emperor endured until the Greek War of Independence in the 19th century and beyond. It was fuelled when the King of the Hellenes, George I, named his firstborn son and heir Constantine in 1868. His name echoed the emperors of old, proclaiming his succession not just to the new Greek kings, but to the Byzantine emperors before them as well. Once he acceded to the throne as Constantine I of Greece, many in Greece hailed him as Constantine XII instead. Constantine I's conquest of Thessaloniki from the Turks in 1912 and his leadership in the Balkan Wars 1912‚Äì1913 seemed to be evidence that the prophecy was about to be realized; Constantinople and the Red Apple Tree were believed to be Constantine's next goals. When Constantine was forced to abdicate in 1917, many believed he had been unjustly removed before completing his sacred destiny. The hope of capturing Constantinople would not be completely dashed until the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War in 1922. = Regnal number = The larger, waterfront statue of Constantine XI in Athens Constantine Palaiologos is generally reckoned to have been the eleventh emperor with that name. As such, he is typically referred to as Constantine XI, with 'XI' being a regnal number, used in monarchies since the Middle Ages to differentiate among rulers with the same name in the same office, reigning of the same territory. Regnal numbers were never used in the Roman Empire and despite an increase in emperors of the same name during the Middle Ages, such as the many emperors named Michael, Leo, John or Constantine, the practice was never introduced in the Byzantine Empire. Instead, the Byzantines used nicknames (for instance \\"Michael the Drunkard\\", now given the number Michael III) or patronymics (for instance \\"Constantine, son of Manuel\\" rather than Constantine XI) to distinguish emperors of the same name. The modern numbering of the Byzantine emperors is a purely historiographical invention, created by historians beginning with Edward Gibbon in his The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776‚Äì1789). Since the name Constantine connected an emperor with the founder of Constantinople and the first Christian Roman emperor, Constantine the Great, the name was particularly popular among emperors. Whilst modern historiography generally recognizes eleven emperors by the name, older works have occasionally numbered him differently. Gibbon numbered Constantine as Constantine XIII after counting two junior co- emperors, Constantine Lekapenos (co-emperor 924‚Äì945) and Constantine Doukas (co-emperor 1074‚Äì1078 and 1081‚Äì1087). The modern number, XI, was established with the publication of the revised edition of Charles le Beau's Histoire du Bas-Empire en commen√ßant √† Constantin le Grand in 1836. Early numismatic (coin-related) works typically assigned Constantine Palaiologos higher numerals since there were numerous coins minted by junior co-emperors of the name Constantine as well. There is particular confusion in the correct number of Constantines since there are two different Roman emperors commonly numbered as Constantine III: the Western usurper Constantine III (407‚Äì411) of the early 5th century and the briefly reigning Byzantine Constantine III (641) of the 7th century. In addition to them, the emperor commonly known today as Constans II (641‚Äì668) actually reigned under the name Constantine, and has sometimes been referred to as Constantine III. A difficult case is Constantine Laskaris, who might have been the first, albeit ephemeral, emperor of the Empire of Nicaea, one of the Byzantine successor states after the Fourth Crusade. It is unclear whether Constantine Laskaris ruled as emperor or not and he is sometimes counted as Constantine XI, which would make Constantine Palaiologos Constantine XII. Constantine Laskaris is sometimes referred to as Constantine (XI), with Constantine Palaiologos numbered Constantine XI (XII). Counting comprehensively those who were officially recognized as rulers under the name Constantine, including those that only ruled nominally as co-emperors but with the supreme title, the total number of emperors named Constantine would be 18. By counting and numbering all previous co-emperors with that name, including Constantine (son of Leo V), Constantine (son of Basil I), Constantine Lekapenos and Constantine Doukas, in addition to Constans II, Constantine Laskaris and the western Constantine III, Constantine Palaiologos would most appropriately be numbered as Constantine XVIII. Scholars commonly do not number co-emperors as the extent of their rule was mostly nominal and, unless they inherited the throne later, did not hold independent supreme power. By counting the western Constantine III, Constans II and Constantine Laskaris‚Äîall emperors reigning with supreme power under the name of Constantine (though it is questionable in Laskaris's case)‚Äîthe numbering of Constantine Palaiologos would be Constantine XIV.

She has been called the most important Catalan novelist of the postwar period. Her novel La pla√ßa del diamant ('The diamond square', translated as The Time of the Doves, 1962) has become the most popular Catalan novel to date and has been translated into over 30 languages. Some critics consider it to be one of the best novels published in Spain after the Spanish Civil War. Biography She was born at 340 carrer de Balmes, Barcelona, in 1908. Her parents were Andreu Rodoreda, from Terrassa and Montserrat Gurgu√≠, from Maresme.tvcatalunya.com Her parents' financial problems prompted her to leave school at age nine. In 1928, just 20 years old, she married her uncle Joan Gurgu√≠, 14 years her senior, and in 1929 she had her only child, Jordi. She began her writing career with short stories in magazines, as an escape from her unhappy marriage. She then wrote psychological novels, including Aloma which won the Crexells Prize, but even with the success this novel enjoyed, Rodoreda decided to remake and republish it some years later since she was not fully satisfied with this period of her life and her works at that time. At the start of the Spanish Civil War, she worked for the Generalitat de Catalunya, the autonomous Government of Catalonia. She was exiled in France and later Switzerland, where in 1957 she broke her silence with the publication of her book Twenty-Two short stories, which earned her the V√≠ctor Catal√† Prize. With Camelia Street (El Carrer de les Cam√®lies) (1966) she won several prizes. In the 1970s, she returned to Romany√† de la Selva in Catalonia and finished the novel Mirall trencat (Broken Mirror) in 1974. Amongst other works came Viatges i flors (Travels and flowers) and Quanta, quanta guerra (How much War) in 1980, which was also the year in which she won the Premi d'Honor de les Lletres Catalanes. During the last period of her lifetime, her works developed from her usual psychologic style to become more akin to symbolism in its more cryptic form. In 1998 a literature prize was instituted in her name: the Merc√® Rodoreda prize for short stories and narratives. She was made a Member of Honour of the Associaci√≥ d'Escriptors en Llengua Catalana, the Association of Writers in Catalan Language. The library in Platja d'Aro is named in her honor.

History Babadag at the end of the 19th century The name of Babadag is connected with 13th century dervish Baba Sari Saltik, who is said to have led a number of Turcomans to Dobruja and to have settled them in this area. The town was first mentioned by Ibn Battuta under the name Baba Saltuk, as the furthermost outpost of the \\"Turks\\" (i.e., the Golden Horde).StƒÉnciugel et al., p.44-46 The town was conquered by Bayezid I, sultan of the Ottoman Empire, in his 1393 Danubian campaign. The construction of a fortress was begun here during the reign of Murad IV, but by 1650 only the fortress's foundation walls and towers were standing. In the 17th century, it occasionally served as the winter headquarters for the Grand Vizier of the Turks during their wars with Russia. The town's location near to the Black Sea made it a target for the Russian navy, the town was bombed by the Russians in 1854 during the Crimean War. In the mid-19th century, Babadag formed part of the region (sanjak) of Silistra within the \\"Bulgarian Government\\" (Danube Vilayet). Following the 1877‚Äì1878 war between the Ottoman and Russian empires, Babadag became part of independent Romania. At Babadag, the Romanian Army operates a military training facility. With a total surface area of 270 km¬≤, this is one of the largest and most modern training firing ranges in Europe. US forces have started to train at Babadag as part of Romania's integration into NATO. Demographics In 1900 Babadag population was 3,500. The 2011 census counted 8,940 inhabitants.

In the first decade of the thirteenth century he commissioned the Liber feudorum Ceritaniae, an illustrated codex cartulary for the counties of Cerdagne, Conflent, and Roussillon. On 15 June 1204 he married (as her third husband) Marie of Montpellier,Damian J. Smith, Crusade, Heresy and Inquisition in the Lands of the Crown of Aragon (c.1167-1276), (Brill, 2010), 31. daughter and heiress of William VIII of Montpellier by Eudocia Comnena. She gave him a son, James, but Peter soon repudiated her. Marie was popularly venerated as a saint for her piety and marital suffering, but was never canonized; she died in Rome in 1213. Marie also perhaps bore Peter II a daughter, \\"Sancha\\", at Collioure in October 1205 according to Christian Nique. (\\"Sancha\\" was born in 1206 according to other accounts; in 1208 according to Mark Gregory Pegg, but February 1208 is more likely the year the couple's son was born). Sancha was betrothed to Raymond VII the son Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, not long after her birth, according to Nique, only days (sources differ as to how long). The marriage contract included Marie's inheritance, Montpellier, which was to be passed to the child immediately should something happen to Peter, says Nique, citing documents discovered in 1850,; cited in something Marie would at first not agree to, but finally agreed to a few months later, stating that she had agreed under pressure. However the child's younger brother James makes no mention of her and Sancha was apparently dead before the New Year, according to Nique's information. He participated in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 which marked the turning point of Muslim domination in the Iberian peninsula.A Global Chronology of Conflict, Vol. I, ed. Spencer Tucker, (ABC- CLIO, 2010), 269. The Crown of Aragon was widespread in the area that is now southwestern France, but which at that time was under the control of vassal local princes, such as the Counts of Toulouse. The Cathars or Albigenses rejected the authority and the teachings of the Catholic Church. Innocent called upon Philip II of France to suppress the Albigenses. Under the leadership of Simon of Montfort a campaign was launched. The Albigensian Crusade, begun in 1209, led to the slaughter of approximately 20,000 men, women and children, Cathar and Catholic alike. Over the course of twenty years military campaigns essentially destroyed the previously flourishing civilization of Occitania and by 1229 brought the region firmly under the control of the King of France, and the Capetian dynasty from the north of France. Peter returned from Las Navas in autumn 1212 to find that Simon de Montfort had conquered Toulouse, exiling Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, who was Peter's brother-in-law and vassal.Raymond VI had married Eleanor, sister of Perer II Peter crossed the Pyrenees and arrived at Muret in September 1213 to confront Montfort's army. He was accompanied by Raymond of Toulouse, who tried to persuade Peter to avoid battle and instead starve out Montfort's forces. This suggestion was rejected. The Battle of Muret began on 12 September 1213. The Aragonese forces were disorganized and disintegrated under the assault of Montfort's squadrons. Peter himself was caught in the thick of fighting, and died as a result of a courageous last stand. He was thrown to the ground and killed. The Aragonese forces broke in panic when their king was slain and Montfort's crusaders won a crushing victory. The nobility of Toulouse, vassals of the Crown of Aragon, were defeated. The conflict culminated in the Treaty of Meaux-Paris in 1229, in which the integration of the Occitan territory into the French crown was agreed upon.

A prominent general, Maurice fought with success against the Sasanian Empire. After he became Emperor, he brought the war with Sasanian Persia to a victorious conclusion. Under him the Empire's eastern border in the South Caucasus was vastly expanded and, for the first time in nearly two centuries, the Romans were no longer obliged to pay the Persians thousands of pounds of gold annually for peace. Maurice campaigned extensively in the Balkans against the Avarspushing them back across the Danube by 599. He also conducted campaigns across the Danube, the first Roman Emperor to do so in over two centuries. In the west, he established two large semi-autonomous provinces called exarchates, ruled by exarchs, or viceroys of the emperor. In Italy Maurice established the Exarchate of Italy in 584, the first real effort by the Empire to halt the advance of the Lombards. With the creation of the Exarchate of Africa in 590 he further solidified the power of Constantinople in the western Mediterranean. His reign was troubled by financial difficulties and almost constant warfare. In 602 a dissatisfied general named Phocas usurped the throne, having Maurice and his six sons executed. This event would prove a disaster for the Empire, sparking a twenty-six year war with Sassanid Persia which would leave both empires devastated prior to the Muslim conquests. His reign is a relatively well documented era of late antiquity, in particular by the historian Theophylact Simocatta. The Strategikon, a manual of war which influenced European and Middle Eastern military traditions for well over a millennium, is traditionally attributed to Maurice. Life =Origins and early life= Maurice was born in Arabissus in Cappadocia in 539, the son of a certain Paul. He had one brother, Peter, and two sisters, Theoctista and Gordia, who was later the wife of the general Philippicus. He is recorded to have been a native Greek speaker, unlike the previous emperors since Anastasius I Dicorus. Sources conflict over his birthplace, with most calling him a native Cappadocian Greek and the first emperor \\"from the race of the Greeks\\", while historian Evagrius Scholasticus records a descent from old Rome. Maurice first came to Constantinople as a notarius to serve as a secretary to the comes excubitorum (commander of the Excubitors, the imperial bodyguard), Tiberius, the future Tiberius II (). When Tiberius was named Caesar in 574, Maurice was appointed to succeed him as comes excubitorum. =Persian War and accession to the throne= Map of the Roman-Persian frontier showing Maurice's gains after he reinstated Sassanid king Khosrau II on the throne in 591 In late 577, despite a complete lack of military experience, Maurice was named as magister militum per Orientem, effectively commander-in-chief of the Byzantine army in the east. He succeeded General Justinian in the ongoing war against Sassanid Persia. At about the same time he was raised to the rank of patrikios, the Empire's senior honorific title, which was limited to a small number of holders. In 578, a truce in Mesopotamia came to an end and the main focus of the war shifted to that front. After Persian raids in Mesopotamia, the new magister militum of the east mounted attacks on both sides of the Tigris, captured the fortress of Aphumon and sacked Singara. Sassanid emperor Khosrow sought peace in 579, but died before an agreement could be reached and his successor Hormizd IV (r. 579‚Äì590) broke off the negotiations.. In 580, Byzantium's Arab allies the Ghassanids scored a victory over the Lakhmids, Arab allies of the Sassanids, while Byzantine raids again penetrated east of the Tigris. Around this time the future Khosrow II was put in charge of the situation in Armenia, where he succeeded in convincing most of the rebel leaders to return to Sassanid allegiance, although Iberia remained loyal to the Byzantines.. The following year an ambitious campaign by Maurice, supported by Ghassanid forces under al-Mundhir III, targeted Ctesiphon, the Sassanid capital. The combined force moved south along the river Euphrates accompanied by a fleet of ships. The army stormed the fortress of Anatha and moved on until it reached the region of Beth Aramaye in central Mesopotamia, near Ctesiphon. There they found the bridge over the Euphrates destroyed by the Persians.; . In response to Maurice's advance Sassanid general Adarmahan was ordered to operate in northern Mesopotamia, threatening the Roman army's supply line.. Adarmahan pillaged Osrhoene, and was successful in capturing its capital, Edessa. He then marched his army toward Callinicum on the Euphrates. With the possibility of a march to Ctesiphon gone Maurice was forced to retreat. The retreat was arduous for the tired army, and Maurice and al-Mundhir exchanged recriminations for the expedition's failure. However, they cooperated in forcing Adarmahan to withdraw, and defeated him at Callinicum.; . The mutual recriminations were not laid to rest by this. Despite his successes, al-Mundhir was accused by Maurice of treason during the preceding campaign. Maurice claimed that al- Mundhir had revealed the Byzantine plan to the Persians, who then proceeded to destroy the bridge over the Euphrates. The chronicler John of Ephesus explicitly calls this assertion a lie, as the Byzantine intentions must have been plain to the Persian commanders... Both Maurice and al-Mundhir wrote letters to Emperor Tiberius, who tried to reconcile them. Maurice visited Constantinople himself, where he was able to persuade Tiberius of al-Mundhir's guilt. The charge of treason is almost universally dismissed by modern historians; Irfan Shah√Æd says that it probably had more to do with Maurice's dislike of the veteran and militarily successful Arab ruler. This was compounded by the Byzantines' habitual distrust of the \\"barbarian\\" and supposedly innately traitorous Arabs, as well as by al-Mundhir's staunchly Monophysite faith.. Al-Mundhir was arrested the following year on suspicion of treachery, triggering war between Byzantines and Ghassanids and marking the beginning of the end of the Ghassanid kingdom.. In June of 582 Maurice scored a decisive victory against Adarmahan near Constantina. Adarmahan barely escaped the field, while his co-commander Tamkhosrau was killed. In the same month Emperor Tiberius was struck down by an illness which shortly thereafter killed him. In this state Tiberius initially named two heirs, each of whom was to marry one of his daughters. Maurice was betrothed to Constantina, and Germanus, related through blood to the great emperor Justinian, was married to Charito. It appears that the plan was to divide the Empire in two, with Maurice receiving the eastern provinces and Germanus the western. According to John of Niki√ª, Germanus was Tiberius' favored candidate for the throne but declined out of humility. On 13 August Tiberius was on his deathbed and civilian, military and ecclesiastical dignitaries awaited the appointment of his successor. Tiberius had reportedly prepared a speech on the matter but at this point was too weak to speak. The quaestor sacri palatii (the senior judicial official of the Empire) read it for him. The speech proclaimed Maurice an Augustus and sole successor to the throne. On 14 August 582 Tiberius died and his last words were spoken to his successor:Paul the Deacon, III, ch. 15 \\"Let my sovereignty be delivered to thee with this girl. Be happy in the use of it, mindful always to love equity and justice.\\" Maurice became sole emperor, marrying Constantina in the autumn.http://www.roman- emperors.org/sophia.htm Lynda Garland, \\"Sophia, Wife of Justin II\\" Shortly after his ascension the advantage he had gained at the Battle of Constantina was lost when his successor as magister militum of the east, John Mystacon, was defeated at the River Nymphios by Kardarigan.. The situation was difficult: Maurice ruled a bankrupt Empire; it was at war with Persia; he was paying extremely high tribute to the Avars, 80,000 gold solidi a year; and the Balkan provinces were being thoroughly devastated by the Slavs. Follis with Maurice in consular uniform. Maurice had to continue the war against the Persians. In 586 his troops defeated them at the Battle of Solachon south of Dara. In 588, a mutiny by unpaid Byzantine troops against their new commander, Priscus, seemed to offer the Sassanids a chance for a breakthrough, but the mutineers themselves repulsed the ensuing Persian offensive. Later in the year they secured a major victory before Martyropolis. The Sassanid commander, Maruzas, was killed, several of the Persian leaders were captured along with 3,000 other prisoners, and only a thousand men survived to reach refuge at Nisibis. The Byzantines secured much booty, including the Persian battle standards, and sent them, along with Maruzas' head, to Maurice in Constantinople. In 590 two Parthian brothers, Vistahm and Vinduyih, overthrew King Hormizd IV and made the latter's son, Prince Khosrau II, the new King. The former Persian commander-in-chief, Bahram Chobin, who had rebelled against Hormizd IV, claimed the throne for himself and defeated Khosrau. Khosrau and the two Parthians fled to the Byzantine court. Although the Senate unanimously advised against it, Maurice helped Khosrau regain his throne with an army of 35,000 men. In 591 the combined Byzantine-Persian army under generals John Mystacon and Narses defeated Bahram Chobin's forces near Ganzak at the Battle of the Blarathon. The victory was decisive; Maurice finally brought the war to a successful conclusion with the re-accession of Khosrau. Subsequently, Khosrau was adopted by the Emperor in order to seal their alliance. The adoption was made through a rite of adoptio per arma, which ordinarily assumed the Christian character of its partakers. However, the chief Byzantine bishops, \\"despite their best attempts\\", failed to convert Khosrau. Khosrau rewarded Maurice by ceding to the Empire western Armenia up to the lakes Van and Sevan, including the large cities of Martyropolis, Tigranokert, Manzikert, Ani, and Yerevan. Maurice's treaty brought a new status-quo to the east territorially. Byzantium was enlarged to an extent never before achieved by the Empire. During the new \\"perpetual peace\\" millions of solidi were saved by the remission of tribute to the Persians. =Balkan war= The Northern Balkans in the 6th century. The Avars arrived in the Carpathian Basin in 568. Almost immediately they launched an attack on Sirmium, the keystone to the Byzantine defences on the Danube, but were repulsed. They then sent 10,000 Kotrigur Huns to invade the Byzantine province of Dalmatia. There followed a period of consolidation, during which the Byzantines paid them 80,000 gold solidi a year. In 579, his treasury empty, Tiberius II stopped the payments. The Avars retaliated with another siege of Sirmium. The city fell in . After the capture of Sirmium, the Avars demanded 100,000 solidi a year. Refused, they used the strategically important city as a base of operations against several poorly defended forts along the Danube and began pillaging the northern and eastern Balkans. The Slavs began settling the land from the 580s on. In 584 the Slavs threatened the capital and in 586 the Avars besieged Thessalonica, while the Slavs went as far as the Peloponnese. After his victory on the eastern frontier in 591, Maurice was free to focus on the Balkans. He launched several campaigns against the Slavs and Avars. In 592 his troops retook Singidunum (modern Belgrade) from the Avars. His commander-in- chief Priscus defeated the Slavs, Avars and Gepids south of the Danube in 593. The same year he crossed the Danube into modern-day Wallachia to continue his series of victories. In 594 Maurice replaced Priscus with his rather inexperienced brother Peter, who, despite initial failures, scored another victory in Wallachia. Priscus, now in command of another army further upstream, defeated the Avars again in 595. The latter now only dared to attack peripherally, in Dalmatia two years later. In the same year the Byzantines concluded a peace treaty with the Avar leader Bayan I, which allowed the Byzantines to send expeditions into Wallachia. In 598 Maurice broke the treaty to permit a retaliation campaign inside the Avar homeland. In 599 and 601 the Byzantine forces wreaked havoc amongst the Avars and Gepids. In 602 the Slavs suffered a crushing defeat in Wallachia. The Byzantine troops were now able to hold the Danube line again. Meanwhile, Maurice was making plans for repopulating devastated areas in the Balkans by using Armenian settlers. Maurice also planned to lead further campaigns against the Avar Khaganate, so as to either destroy them or force them into submission.The Armenian History attributed to Sebƒìos, Part 1, translation and notes, trans. R.W. Thomson; comm. J.D. Howard-Johnston, Translated Texts for Historians 31 (Liverpool, 1999) p.56 =Domestic policy= The Exarchate of Italy under Maurice The Exarchate of Africa under Maurice In the west Maurice organised the threatened Byzantine dominions in Italy into the Exarchate of Italy. The Late Roman administrative system provided for a clear distinction between civil and military offices, primarily to lessen the possibility of rebellion by over- powerful provincial governors. In 584 Maurice created the office of exarch, which combined the supreme civil authority of a praetorian prefect and the military authority of a magister militum and enjoyed considerable autonomy from Constantinople. The Exarchate was successful in slowing the Lombard advance in Italy. In 591 he created the Exarchate of Africa along similar lines. In 597 an ailing Maurice wrote his last will, in which he described his ideas of governing the Empire. His eldest son, Theodosius, would rule the east from Constantinople; his second son, Tiberius, would rule the West from Rome. Some historians believe he intended for his younger sons to rule from Alexandria, Carthage, and Antioch. His intent was to maintain the unity of the Empire; this idea bears a strong resemblance to the Tetrarchy of Diocletian. However, Maurice's violent death prevented these plans from coming to fruition. In religious matters, Maurice was tolerant towards Monophysitism, although he was a supporter of the Council of Chalcedon. He clashed with Pope Gregory I over the latter's defence of Rome against the Lombards. Maurice's efforts to consolidate the Empire slowly but steadily succeeded, especially after the peace with Persia. His initial popularity apparently declined during his reign, mostly because of his fiscal policies. In 588 he announced a cut in military wages by a quarter, leading to a serious mutiny by troops on the Persian front. He refused to pay a small ransom in 599 or 600 to free 12,000 Byzantine soldiers taken prisoner by the Avars. The prisoners were killed, and a protesting military delegation, headed by an officer named Phocas (subsequently Emperor Phocas), was humiliated and rejected in Constantinople. Family Maurice's marriage produced nine known children: * Theodosius (4 August 583/585 ‚Äì after 27 November 602). According to John of Ephesus, he was the first heir born to a reigning emperor since the reign of Theodosius II (408‚Äì450). He was appointed Caesar in 587 and co-emperor on 26 March 590. * Tiberius (died 27 November 602) * Petrus (died 27 November 602) * Paulus (died 27 November 602) * Justin (died 27 November 602) * Justinian (died 27 November 602) * Anastasia (died c. 605) * Theoctista (died c. 605) * Cleopatra (died c. 605) A daughter, Miriam/Maria, is recorded by the 12th-century chronicler Michael the Syrian and other eastern sources as married to Khosrau II but not in any Byzantine Greek ones; she is probably legendary.Baum (2004), p. 24-26 His brother Petrus (c. 550 ‚Äì 602) became the curopalates and was killed at the same time as Maurice. Petrus married Anastasia Aerobinda (born c. 570), daughter of Areobindus (born c. 550), and had female issue. Maurice's nephew Domitian of Melitene was probably a son of Peter. Death In 602 Maurice, with the lack of money as always dictating policy, decreed that the army should stay for winter beyond the Danube. The exhausted troops mutinied against the Emperor. Probably misjudging the situation, Maurice repeatedly ordered his troops to start a new offensive rather than return to winter quarters. His troops gained the impression that Maurice no longer understood the military situation and proclaimed Phocas their leader. They demanded that Maurice abdicate and proclaim as successor either his son Theodosius or General Germanus. Both men were accused of treason, but riots broke out in Constantinople, and the Emperor left the city with his family for Nicomedia. Theodosius headed east to Persia, but historians are not sure whether he had been sent there by his father or if he fled there. Phocas entered Constantinople in November and was crowned emperor, while his troops captured Maurice and his family. Maurice was murdered on 27 November 602 (some sources say 23 November). The deposed emperor was forced to watch his six sons executed before he was beheaded himself. Empress Constantina and her three daughters were spared and sent to a monastery but a few years later were all executed when Constantina was found guilty of a conspiracy against Phocas. The Persian King Khosrau II used this coup and the murder of his patron as an excuse for a renewed war against the Empire. Legacy The Roman Empire in 600 =Assessment= Maurice is seen as an able emperor and commander-in- chief, though the description of him by Theophylact may exaggerate these traits. He possessed insight, public spirit, and courage. He proved his expertise on military and foreign affairs during his campaigns against the Persians, Avars and Slavs, and during peace negotiations with Khosrau II. His administrative reforms reveal him as a farsighted statesman, all the more since they outlasted his death by centuries and were the basis for the later introduction of themes as military districts. His court still used Latin, as did the army and administration, and he promoted science and the arts. Maurice is traditionally named as author of the military treatise Strategikon, which is praised in military circles as the only sophisticated combined arms theory until World War II. Some historians now believe the Strategikon is the work of his brother or another general in his court, however. His greatest weakness was his inability to judge how unpopular his decisions were. The historian C. W. Previt√©-Orton, listed a number of character flaws in the Emperor's personality: It was this flaw that cost him throne and life, and thwarted most of his efforts to prevent the disintegration of the Empire of Justinian I. The death of Maurice was a turning point. The war against Persia which it caused weakened both empires, enabling the Slavs to permanently settle the Balkans and paving the way for the Arab-Muslim expansion. English historian A.H.M. Jones characterises the death of Maurice as the end of the era of Classical Antiquity, as the turmoil that shattered the Empire over the next four decades permanently and thoroughly changed society and politics. =Legends= The first legendary accounts of Maurice's life are recorded in the ninth century, in the work of the Byzantine historian Theophanes the Confessor. According to his chronicle Chronographia, the death of the imperial family is due to divine intervention: Christ asked the Emperor to choose between a long reign or death and acceptance in the kingdom of heaven. Maurice preferred the second choice.Theophanes (the Confessor) et Roger Scott. The chronicle of Theophanes Confessor: Byzantine and Near Eastern history, AD 284‚Äì813. Clarendon Press, 1997, pp. 410 The same story has been recorded in a short Syriac hagiography on the life of the emperor. It is of East Syrian origin. This was later sanctified by the Eastern Orthodox Church. According to the Syriac author, the emperor asked in prayer to receive a punishment in this world and a \\"perfect reward\\" in the kingdom of heaven. The choice was offered by an angel.Turnhout: Brepols, 1981, pp. 774‚Äì775. Anthony Alcock has published an English translation. According to another legend in the same text, Maurice prevented a nurse from substituting one of his sons so as to save at least one of the heirs of the Empire.Nau, 1981, pp. 776‚Äì778. In a Montenegrin epic the legendary Prince Nahod Momir (Momir the foundling) and his sister Grozdana are related to the Emperor and his sister Gordia. In the epic, the epithet \\"the foundling\\" reflects Maurice's adoption by the Emperor Tiberius, and by the imperial dynasty of Justin. In the Bosnian epic, the Emperor is called Mouio Tcarevitch (Mouio the son of the emperor).Shuka, 2015, pp. 527‚Äì568.

According to strategist William S. Lind, combined arms can be distinguished from the concept of \\"supporting arms\\" as follows: > Combined arms hits the enemy with two or more arms simultaneously in such a > manner that the actions he must take to defend himself from one make him > more vulnerable to another. In contrast, supporting arms is hitting the > enemy with two or more arms in sequence, or if simultaneously, then in such > combination that the actions the enemy must take to defend himself from one > also defends himself from the other(s). Though the lower-echelon units of a combined arms team may be of similar types, a balanced mixture of such units are combined into an effective higher- echelon unit, whether formally in a table of organization or informally in an ad hoc solution to a battlefield problem. For example, an armored division‚Äîthe modern paragon of combined arms doctrine‚Äîconsists of a mixture of infantry, tank, artillery, reconnaissance, and perhaps even helicopter units, all coordinated and directed by a unified command structure. Also, most modern military units can, if the situation requires it, call on yet more branches of the military, such as infantry requesting bombing or shelling by fighter or bomber aircraft or naval forces to augment their ground offensive or protect their land forces. The mixing of arms is sometimes pushed down below the level where homogeneity ordinarily prevails, for example by temporarily attaching a tank company to an infantry battalion. Ancient warfare Combined arms operations date back to antiquity, where armies would usually field a screen of skirmishers to protect their spearmen during the approach to contact. Especially in the case of the Greek hoplites, however, the focus of military thinking lay almost exclusively on the heavy infantry. In more elaborate situations armies of various nationalities fielded different combinations of light, medium, or heavy infantry, cavalry, chariotry, camelry, elephantry, and artillery (mechanical weapons). Combined arms in this context was how to best use the cooperating units, variously armed with side-arms, spears, or missile weapons in order to coordinate an attack to disrupt and then destroy the enemy. Philip II of Macedon greatly improved upon the limited combined arms tactics of the Greek city-states and combined the newly created Macedonian phalanx with heavy cavalry and other forces. The phalanx would hold the opposing line in place, until the heavy cavalry could smash and break the enemy line by achieving local superiority. The pre-Marian Roman Legion was a combined arms force and consisted of five classes of troops. Lightly equipped velites acted as skirmishers armed with light javelins. The hastati and principes formed the main attacking strength of the legion with sword and pilum, whilst the triarii formed the defensive backbone of the legion fighting as a phalanx with long spears and large shields. The fifth class were the equites (the cavalry) used for scouting, pursuit and to guard the flanks. After the Marian reforms the Legion was notionally a unit of heavy infantrymen armed with just sword and pilum, and fielded with a small attached auxiliary skirmishers and missile troops, and incorporated a small cavalry unit. The legion was sometimes also incorporated into a higher-echelon combined arms unit ‚Äî e.g., in one period it was customary for a general to command two legions plus two similarly sized units of auxiliaries, lighter units useful as screens or for combat in rough terrain. The army of the Han Dynasty is also an example, fielding m√™l√©e infantry, crossbowmen, and cavalry (ranging from horse archers to heavy lancers). Civilizations such as the Carthaginians and Sassanids also were known to have fielded a combination of infantry supported by powerful cavalry. Middle Ages At the Battle of Hastings (1066) English infantry fighting from behind a shield wall were defeated by a Norman army consisting of archers, infantry and mounted knights (cavalry). One of the tactics used by the Normans was to tempt the English to leave the shield wall to attack retreating Norman infantry only to destroy them in the open with cavalry. Likewise Scottish sheltrons ‚Äì which had been developed to counter the charges by English heavy cavalry, and had been used successfully against English cavalry at the Battle of Stirling Bridge (1297) ‚Äì were destroyed at the Battle of Falkirk (1298) by English archers acting in concert with mounted knights. Both Hastings and Falkirk showed how combined arms could be used to defeat enemies relying on only one arm. The English victories of Cr√©cy, Poitiers and Agincourt were examples of a simple form of combined arms, with a combination of dismounted knights forming a foundation for formations of English longbowmen. The lightly protected longbowmen could down their French opponents at a distance, whilst the armoured men-at-arms could deal with any Frenchmen who made it to the English lines. This is the crux of combined arms: to allow a combination of forces to achieve what would be impossible for its constituent elements to do alone. During the Middle Ages military forces used combined arms as a method of winning battles and furthering a war leader or king's long term goals. Some historians claim that during the Middle Ages there was no strategic or tactical art to military combat. Kelly DeVries uses the Merriam-Webster definition of combat \\"as a general military engagement\\". In the pursuit of a leader's goals and self-interest tactical and strategic thinking was used along with taking advantage of the terrain and weather in choosing when and where to give battle. The simplest example is the combination of different specialties such as archers, infantry, cavalry (knights or shock mounted troops), and even peasant militia. At times, each force fought on its own and won or lost depending on the opposing military competence. During the Middle Ages leaders utilized a combination of these skilled and unskilled forces to win battles. An army that has multiple skills available can engage a larger force that incorporates mainly one or two types of troops. Each type of military formation ‚Äì infantry, archers, cavalry, or peasant ‚Äì has certain advantages that the other does not have. Infantry allows a force to hold ground and in the event of overwhelming enemy forces withdraw into terrain that mounted troops cannot maneuver as easily, thus negating the advantage of the horse. Archers provide standoff with their bows or crossbows. Cavalry can maneuver faster and provide fast attack before the enemy has had time to prepare defenses. Peasants are more numerous and cheaper on the royal coffers. Over the long term the army can cross-train and learn the skills of the specialties to increase combat effectiveness. This is known as a combat multiplier today. The combination of the different skills help provide a commander the flexibility to minimize risk when it comes to engagements. The overall objective of any military force is to fight and win, while also preserving the largest number of combatants to carry on the larger strategic aims of the king. This can be seen in some of the engagements during the Middle Ages. =Examples of combined arms use in battle= The effective use of combined arms can ‚Äì in conjunction with strategic and tactical considerations ‚Äì overwhelm opposing forces, even those which are numerically superior. The use of terrain and weather can also aid in the use of combined arms to bring about the desired results of the commander of a military force. ;Crecy-en-Ponthieu: Mid-1346, at the battle of Crecy-en-Ponthieu, an English army numbering between 3,000‚Äì20,000 mixed troops set up a defensive line for the oncoming French forces numbering nearly 100,000 mixed troops. The English being in a defensive position dismounted their knights to augment the infantry forces on the lines of defense. It is unclear from the sources of the location of the English archers, either on the flanks, intermingled with the line troops, or behind the lines; the most likely was that they were formed up along the flanks according to prior positions in previous battles. The French arrived on the battlefield and sent their crossbowmen in advance of the cavalry to assault the English lines. The effectiveness of the crossbowmen was limited by rain having soaked the strings of the crossbows reducing its effectiveness. The English archers had been able to keep their bow strings dry and only used them when the crossbowmen were in range. This led to the massacre of the crossbowmen and a retreat of the survivors who were then trampled by the advancing French cavalry. This also disrupted an already disorganized advance after a long march to the battlefield by the cavalry. The piecemeal assault of the French forces would lead to an English victory. ;Battle of Morgarten: In 1315, Swiss peasants, archers, and infantry at Morgarten were able to ambush a larger Austrian force. The Swiss had rebelled against Austrian rule and funneled the Austrian forces into easily defended passes in the Swiss mountains. The peasants and archers on the high ground effectively rained down arrows and rocks to disorganize the Austrian forces and the infantry charged in forcing the advance guard to retreat into the main body causing more confusion, as well as a general military retreat by the Austrian military. ;Battle of Auberoche: In 1345, an English army of about 1,200 men had been moving through the P√©rigord region of Gascony. The French army had caught up outside the town of Auberoche but did not know the English had hidden in the woods near where the French had encamped upon arrival. During the evening meal the French were surprised by an attack under the cover of English archers. The disorganized French forces were slaughtered and had no choice but to withdraw. 15th to 19th centuries The French army of the Valois kings, composed of heavily armoured gendarmes (professional versions of the medieval knight), Swiss and Landsknecht mercenary pikemen, and heavy cannons took form during the transition from the medieval way of war to the early modern period. The late 15th century saw the development of combined pike and shot formations in Europe, starting with the colunelas of the Spanish general Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, evolving into the tercios of Hapsburg Spain and the Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire during the 16th century. In Japan, at the battle of Nagashino (Èï∑ÁØ†„ÅÆÊà¶„ÅÑ) in 1575, forces of the Oda clan successfully employed combined arms against the Takeda clan, which heavily relied on cavalry. The Oda army erected palisades to protect their ashigaru musketeers that shot down the Takeda cavalry while their samurai cut down any enemies who managed to approach melee range. The 17th century saw increasing use of combined arms at lower (regimental) level. King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden was the proponent of the idea. For fire support he attached teams of \\"commanded musketeers\\" to cavalry units and fielded light 3-pounder guns to provide infantry units with organic artillery. In the eighteenth century, the concept of the legion was revived. Legions now consisted of musketeers, light infantry, dragoons and artillery in a brigade sized force. These legions often combined professional military personnel with militia. Perhaps the most notable example is the use of light cavalry, light infantry and light horse artillery in advance detachments by France's La Grande Arm√©e during the Napoleonic Wars. =Napoleonic Wars= After 25 years of near continuous warfare, the armies that met at the Battle of Waterloo were organised in a similar manner‚Äìinto corps which contained infantry, cavalry and artillery (see Order of battle of the Waterloo Campaign), and used similar combined arms tactics. Within each corps were divisions of infantry or cavalry made up of brigades and an artillery unit. An army would usually also have reserves of all three arms under the direct command of the army commander which could be sent in support of any corps or division of a corps to increase any arm which the army general considered necessary. The great French cavalry charge commanded by Marshal Ney during the battle failed to break Wellington's squares of infantry and Ney's failure to supplement his cavalry with sufficient horse artillery to break the squares open is usually given as a major contributing factor in the failure. It is an example of why generals needed to use combined arms to overcome the tactics used by enemy officers to frustrate an attack by a single arm of an army. In contrast the 27th (Inniskilling) suffered 478 casualties from an initial strength of 750 because of their exposure to attack by French combined arms. They were located near the centre of Wellington's line, but unlike most of the rest of Wellington's infantry were in a declivity on the exposed side of the Mont-Saint-Jean escarpment. Exposed as they were, they were forced to stand in square for most of the day for fear of cavalry attack and so made an easy dense target for Napoleon's massed artillery. 20th-century developments The development of modern combined arms tactics began in the First World War. Early in the Western Front, fighting descended into stagnant trench warfare. Generals on both sides applied conventional military thinking to the new weapons and situations that they faced. In these early stages, tactics typically consisted of heavy artillery barrages followed by massed frontal assaults against well entrenched enemies. These tactics were largely unsuccessful and resulted in large loss of life. As the war progressed new combined arms tactics were developed, often described then as the \\"all arms battle\\". These included direct close artillery fire support for attacking soldiers (the creeping barrage), air support and mutual support of tanks and infantry. One of the first instances of combined arms was the Battle of Cambrai, in which the British used tanks, artillery, infantry, small arms and air power to break through enemy lines. Previously such a battle would have lasted months with many hundreds of thousands of casualties. Co-ordination and planning were the key elements, and the use of combined arms tactics in the Hundred Days Offensive in 1918 allowed the Allied forces to exploit breakthroughs in the enemy trenches, forcing the surrender of the Central Powers. In World War II combined arms was a fundamental part of some operational doctrines like the German Blitzkrieg or the Soviet deep battle doctrine, which was based on combining tanks, mobile units (mechanised infantry or cavalry) and infantry, while supported by artillery. In 1963 the United States Marine Corps formalized the concept of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force, which combined Marine aviation and Marine ground units for expeditionary missions. The Vietnam War had a profound influence on the development of the US Army's combined arms doctrine. Due to the very difficult terrain that prevented access to the enemy-held areas of operation, troops were often deployed by air assault. For this reason, US troops in Vietnam saw six times more combat than in preceding wars, due to less time spent on logistic delays. The result: an infantry unit increased in effectiveness by a factor of four for its size, when supported with helicopter-delivered ammunition, food and fuel. In time the US Army in Vietnam also learned to combine helicopter operations and airmobile infantry with the armoured and artillery units operating from fire support bases as well as the US brown-water navy and USAF Close Air Support units supporting them. In the 1991 Gulf War a mix of strikes by fixed-wing aircraft including carpet bombing and precision bombing was used in combination with large numbers of strikes by attack helicopters. During the ground assault phase, tanks and other AFVs supported by attack aircraft swept over remaining forces. The front line moved forward at upwards of 40‚Äì50 km/h at the upper limit of the Army's tracked vehicles. =Post Cold War (1993 to present)= K-1 tanks, combat vehicles and infantry in Gyeonggi Province In 2000, the US Army began developing a new set of doctrines intended to use information superiority to wage warfare. Six pieces of equipment were crucial for this: AWACS, an airborne look-down radar JSTARS, GPS, the lowly SINCGARS VHF digital radio, and ruggedized PCs. The mix is supplemented by satellite photos and passive reception of enemy radio emissions, forward observers with digital target designation, specialized scouting aircraft, anti-artillery radars and gun-laying software for artillery. Everything feeds into the network. Based on this doctrine, many US ground vehicles moved across the landscape alone. If they encountered an enemy troop or vehicle concentration, they would assume a defensive posture, lay down as much covering fire as they could, designate the targets for requested air and artillery assets. Within a few minutes, on station aircraft would direct their missions to cover the ground vehicle. Within a half-hour heavy attack forces would concentrate to relieve the isolated vehicle. In an hour and a half the relieved vehicle would be resupplied.

Many of his novels examine class difference and hypocrisy, including A Room with a View (1908), Howards End (1910) and A Passage to India (1924). The last brought him his greatest success. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 16 separate years. Early years A section of the main building, Tonbridge School Forster, born at 6 Melcombe Place, Dorset Square, London NW1, a building no longer standing, was the only child of the Anglo-Irish Alice Clara \\"Lily\\" (n√©e Whichelo) and a Welsh architect, Edward Morgan Llewellyn Forster. He was registered as Henry Morgan Forster, but accidentally baptised Edward Morgan Forster.Moffatt, p. 26. His father died of tuberculosis on 30 October 1880 before Morgan's second birthday.AP Central ‚Äì English Literature Author: E. M. Forster . Apcentral.collegeboard.com (18 January 2012). Retrieved on 10 June 2012. In 1883, he and his mother moved to Rooks Nest, near Stevenage, Hertfordshire until 1893. This served as a model for Howards End in his novel of that name. It is listed Grade I for historic interest and literary associations. Forster had fond memories of his childhood at Rooks Nest. Among Forster's ancestors were members of the Clapham Sect, a social reform group within the Church of England. Forster inherited ¬£8,000 in trust (the equivalent of about ¬£990,000 in 2017) from his paternal great-aunt Marianne Thornton (daughter of the abolitionist Henry Thornton), who died on 5 November 1887. The money was enough to live on and enabled him to become a writer. He attended as a day boy Tonbridge School in Kent, where the school theatre has been named in his honour, although he is known to have been unhappy there. At King's College, Cambridge, between 1897 and 1901, he became a member of a discussion society known as the Apostles (formally named the Cambridge Conversazione Society). They met in secret, and discussed their work on philosophical and moral questions. Many of its members went on to constitute what came to be known as the Bloomsbury Group, of which Forster was a member in the 1910s and 1920s. There is a famous recreation of Forster's Cambridge at the beginning of The Longest Journey. The Schlegel sisters of Howards End are based to some degree on Vanessa and Virginia Stephen. In 1904, Forster travelled in Greece and Italy as he was interested in their classical heritage. He then sought a post in Germany so that he could learn the language, and he spent several months in the summer of 1905 in Nassenheide, Pomerania, (now the Polish village of Rzƒôdziny) working as a tutor to the children of the writer Elizabeth von Arnim; he wrote a short memoir of this experience which was one of the happiest times in his life.Sully, R.

The National Archives. Retrieved 18 July 2020 In 1906 he fell in love with Syed Ross Masood, a 17-year-old Indian future Oxford student he tutored in Latin. Masood had a more romantic, poetic view of friendship, confusing Forster with avowals of love. After leaving university, he travelled in continental Europe with his mother. They moved to Weybridge, Surrey, where he wrote all six of his novels. In 1914, he visited Egypt, Germany and India with the classicist Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson, by which time he had written all but one of his novels.Lionel Trilling, E. M. Forster, p. 114. As a conscientious objector in the First World War, Forster served as a Chief Searcher (for missing servicemen) for the British Red Cross in Alexandria, Egypt. Though conscious of his repressed desires, it was only at this time, while stationed in Egypt, that he \\"lost his R [respectability]\\" to a wounded soldier in 1917. Forster spent a second spell in India in the early 1920s as private secretary to Tukojirao III, Maharajah of Dewas. The Hill of Devi is his non-fictional account of this period. After returning to London from India, he completed the last novel of his to be published in his lifetime, A Passage to India (1924), for which he won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. He also edited the letters of Eliza Fay (1756‚Äì1816) from India, in an edition first published in 1925.Original Letters from India (New York: NYRB, 2010 [1925]) . In 2012, Tim Leggatt, who knew Forster for his last 15 years, wrote a memoir using unpublished correspondence with him dating from those years. After A Passage to India Arlington Park Mansions, Chiswick Forster was awarded a Benson Medal in 1937. In the 1930s and 1940s Forster became a notable broadcaster on BBC Radio, and while George Orwell was the BBC India Section talks producer from 1941 to 1943, he commissioned from Forster a weekly book review. Forster became publicly associated with the British Humanist Association. In addition to his broadcasting, he advocated individual liberty and penal reform and opposed censorship by writing articles, sitting on committees and signing letters. Forster was open about his homosexuality to his close friends, but not to the public. He never married, but he had a number of male lovers during his adult life. He developed a long-term relationship with Bob Buckingham (1904‚Äì1975), a married policeman. Forster included Buckingham and his wife May in his circle, which included J. R. Ackerley, a writer and literary editor of The Listener, the psychologist W. J. H. Sprott, and for a time, the composer Benjamin Britten. Other writers with whom Forster associated included Christopher Isherwood, the poet Siegfried Sassoon, and the Belfast-based novelist Forrest Reid. He was a close friend of the socialist poet and philosopher Edward Carpenter, and it was a visit to Carpenter and his much younger lover George Merrill in 1913 that inspired Forster's novel Maurice, which is partly based on the couple.Kate Symondson (25 May 2016) E M Forster‚Äôs gay fiction . The British Library website. Retrieved 18 July 2020 In 1960, Forster began a relationship with the Bulgarian emigre Mattei Radev, a picture framer and art collector who moved in Bloomsbury group circles. He was Forster's junior by 46 years. They met at Long Crichel House, a Georgian rectory in Long Crichel, Dorset, a country retreat shared by Edward Sackville-West and the gallery-owner and artist Eardley Knollys.Jennings, Clive (14 June 2013) Retrieved 8 October 2020 Forster lived in this house, home of his friends Robert and May Buckingham, and died here on 7 June 1970. The sign on the wall above the garage door marks the 100th anniversary of his birth From 1925 until his mother's death at age 90 in March 1945, Forster lived with her at the house West Hackhurst in the village of Abinger Hammer, Surrey, finally leaving in September 1946. His London base was 26 Brunswick Square from 1930 to 1939, after which he rented 9 Arlington Park Mansions in Chiswick until at least 1961. After a fall in April 1961, he spent his final years in Cambridge at King's College.Furbank, Philip Nicholas. E. M. Forster: A Life. Volume Two: Polycrates' Ring (1914‚Äì1970). Secker & Warburg, 1978. pp. 314‚Äì324. Forster was elected an honorary fellow of King's College, Cambridge, in January 1946, and lived for the most part in the college, doing relatively little. In April 1947 he arrived in America to begin a three-month nationwide tour of public readings and sightseeing, returning to the East Coast in June.Wendy Moffat, E. M. Forster: A New Life, London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2010 He declined a knighthood in 1949 and was made a Companion of Honour in 1953. At age 82, he wrote his last short story, Little Imber, a science fiction tale. According to his friend Richard Marquand, Forster was highly critical of American foreign policy in his latter years. This was one of the reasons why he consistently refused offers to adapt his novels for the screen, because Forster felt that such productions would inevitably involve American financing. At 85 he went on a pilgrimage to the Wiltshire countryside that had inspired his favourite novel The Longest Journey, escorted by William Golding. In 1969 he was made a member of the Order of Merit. Forster died of a stroke on 7 June 1970 at the age of 91, at the Buckinghams' home in Coventry, Warwickshire. His ashes, mingled with those of Buckingham, were later scattered in the rose garden of Coventry's crematorium, near Warwick University. Novels The monument to Forster in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, near Rooksnest where Forster grew up. He based the setting for his novel Howards End on this area, now informally known as Forster Country. Forster had five novels published in his lifetime. Although Maurice was published shortly after his death, it had been written nearly sixty years earlier. He never finished a seventh novel, Arctic Summer. His first novel, Where Angels Fear to Tread (1905), is the story of Lilia, a young English widow who falls in love with an Italian, and of the efforts of her bourgeois relatives to get her back from Monteriano (based on San Gimignano). Philip Herriton's mission to retrieve her from Italy has features in common with that of Lambert Strether in Henry James's The Ambassadors. Forster discussed that work ironically and somewhat disapprovingly in his book Aspects of the Novel (1927). Where Angels Fear to Tread was adapted as a 1991 film directed by Charles Sturridge. Next, Forster published The Longest Journey (1907), an inverted Bildungsroman following the lame Rickie Elliott from Cambridge to a career as a struggling writer and then to a post as a schoolmaster, married to the unappealing Agnes Pembroke. In a series of scenes on the hills of Wiltshire, which introduce Rickie's wild half-brother Stephen Wonham, Forster attempts a kind of sublime related to those of Thomas Hardy and D. H. Lawrence. Forster and his mother stayed at Pensione Simi, now Hotel Jennings Riccioli, Florence, in 1901. Forster took inspiration from this sojourn for the Pension Bertolini in A Room with a View Forster's third novel, A Room with a View (1908), is his lightest and most optimistic. It was started as early as 1901, before any of his others; its earliest versions are entitled Lucy. The book explores the young Lucy Honeychurch's trip to Italy with her cousin, and the choice she must make between the free-thinking George Emerson and the repressed aesthete Cecil Vyse. George's father Mr Emerson quotes thinkers who influenced Forster, including Samuel Butler. The book was adapted as a film of the same name in 1985 by the Merchant Ivory team, starring Helena Bonham Carter and Daniel Day-Lewis, and as a televised adaptation of the same name in 2007 by Andrew Davies. Where Angels Fear to Tread and A Room with a View can be seen collectively as Forster's Italian novels. Both include references to the famous Baedeker guidebooks and concern narrow-minded middle- class English tourists abroad. The books share many themes with his short stories collected in The Celestial Omnibus and The Eternal Moment. Howards End (1910) is an ambitious \\"condition-of-England\\" novel concerned with different groups within the Edwardian middle classes, represented by the Schlegels (bohemian intellectuals), the Wilcoxes (thoughtless plutocrats) and the Basts (struggling lower-middle-class aspirants). Critics have observed that numerous characters in Forster's novels die suddenly. This is true of Where Angels Fear to Tread, Howards End and, most particularly, The Longest Journey. Howards End was adapted as a film in 1992 by the Merchant-Ivory team, starring Vanessa Redgrave, Emma Thompson, Anthony Hopkins, and Helena Bonham-Carter. Emma Thompson would win the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as Margaret Schlegel. It was also adapted as a miniseries in 2017. An opera libretto Howards End, America was created in 2016 by Claudia Stevens. Forster achieved his greatest success with A Passage to India (1924). The novel takes as its subject the relationship between East and West, seen through the lens of India in the later days of the British Raj. Forster connects personal relationships with the politics of colonialism through the story of the Englishwoman Adela Quested, the Indian Dr. Aziz, and the question of what did or did not happen between them in the Marabar Caves. Forster makes special mention of the author Ahmed Ali and his Twilight in Delhi in his Preface to its Everyman's Library Edition. A Passage to India was adapted as a play in 1960, directed by Frank Hauser, and as a film in 1984, directed by David Lean. Maurice (1971) was published posthumously. It is a homosexual love story that also returns to matters familiar from Forster's first three novels, such as the suburbs of London in the English home counties, the experience of attending Cambridge, and the wild landscape of Wiltshire. The novel was controversial, given that Forster's homosexuality had not been previously known or widely acknowledged. Today's critics continue to argue over the extent to which Forster's sexuality and personal activities influenced his writing. Maurice was adapted as a film in 1987 by the Merchant Ivory team. Early in his writing career, Forster attempted a historical novel about the Byzantine scholar Gemistus Pletho and the Italian condottiero Sigismondo de Malatesta, but was not satisfied with the result and never published it, though he kept the manuscript and later showed it to Naomi Mitchison.Mentioned in a 1925 letter to Mitchison, quoted in her autobiography You May Well Ask: A Memoir 1920‚Äì1940. Critical reception Forster receiving an honorary doctorate from Leiden University (1954) Forster's first novel, Where Angels Fear to Tread, was described by reviewers as \\"astonishing\\" and \\"brilliantly original\\".P. Gardner, ed. (1973). E. M. Forster: the critical heritage. The Manchester Guardian (forerunner of The Guardian) noted \\"a persistent vein of cynicism which is apt to repel,\\" though \\"the cynicism is not deep-seated.\\" The novel is labelled \\"a sordid comedy culminating, unexpectedly and with a real dramatic force, in a grotesque tragedy.\\"The Manchester Guardian, 30 August 1905. Lionel Trilling remarked on this first novel as \\"a whole and mature work dominated by a fresh and commanding intelligence\\". Subsequent books were similarly received on publication. The Manchester Guardian commented on Howards End, describing it as \\"a novel of high quality written with what appears to be a feminine brilliance of perception... witty and penetrating.\\"The Manchester Guardian, 26 February 1910. An essay by David Cecil in Poets and Storytellers (1949) describes Forster as \\"pulsing with intelligence and sensibility\\", but primarily concerned with an original moral vision: \\"He tells a story as well as anyone who ever lived\\".David Cecil (1949). Poets and Storytellers: A Book of Critical Essays. Macmillan. US interest in Forster and appreciation for him were spurred by Lionel Trilling's E. M. Forster: A Study, which called him \\"the only living novelist who can be read again and again and who, after each reading, gives me what few writers can give us after our first days of novel-reading, the sensation of having learned something.\\" Criticism of his works has included comment on unlikely pairings of characters who marry or get engaged, and the lack of realistic depiction of sexual attraction. Key themes Forster was President of the Cambridge Humanists from 1959 until his death and a member of the Advisory Council of the British Humanist Association from 1963 until his death. His views as a humanist are at the heart of his work, which often depicts the pursuit of personal connections in spite of the restrictions of contemporary society. His humanist attitude is expressed in the 1938 non-fictional essay What I Believe (reprinted with two other humanist essays ‚Äì and an introduction and notes by Nicolas Walter ‚Äì as What I Believe, and other essays by the secular humanist publishers G. W. Foote & Co. in 1999). When Forster's cousin, Philip Whichelo, donated a portrait of Forster to the Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association (GLHA), Jim Herrick, the founder, quoted Forster's words: \\"The humanist has four leading characteristics ‚Äì curiosity, a free mind, belief in good taste, and belief in the human race.\\" Forster's two best-known works, A Passage to India and Howards End, explore the irreconcilability of class differences. A Room with a View also shows how questions of propriety and class can make human connection difficult. The novel is his most widely read and accessible work, remaining popular long after its original publication. His posthumous novel Maurice explores the possibility of class reconciliation as one facet of a homosexual relationship. Sexuality is another key theme in Forster's works. Some critics have argued that a general shift from heterosexual to homosexual love can be observed through the course of his writing career. The foreword to Maurice describes his struggle with his homosexuality, while he explored similar issues in several volumes of short stories. Forster's explicitly homosexual writings, the novel Maurice and the short story collection The Life to Come, were published shortly after his death. Forster is noted for his use of symbolism as a technique in his novels, and he has been criticised (as by his friend Roger Fry) for his attachment to mysticism. One example of his symbolism is the wych elm tree in Howards End. The characters of Mrs Wilcox in that novel and Mrs Moore in A Passage to India have a mystical link with the past, and a striking ability to connect with people from beyond their own circles. Henry James, E. M. Forster and Somerset Maugham were the earliest fiction writers to portray characters from diverse countries ‚Äì France, Germany, Italy and India. Their work explores cultural conflict, but arguably the motifs of humanism and cosmopolitanism are dominant. In a way this is anticipation of the concept of human beings shedding national identities and becoming more and more liberal and tolerant.

Toulouse-Lautrec is among the best-known painters of the Post- Impressionist period, with Paul C√©zanne, Vincent van Gogh, and Paul Gauguin. In a 2005 auction at Christie's auction house, La Blanchisseuse, his early painting of a young laundress, sold for US$22.4 million and set a new record for the artist for a price at auction. Early life Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa was born at the H√¥tel du Bosc in Albi, Tarn, in the Midi-Pyr√©n√©es region of France, the firstborn child of Alphonse Charles Comte de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa (1838‚Äì1913) and his wife Ad√®le Zo√´ Tapi√© de Celeyran (1841‚Äì1930). The last part of his name means he was a member of an aristocratic family (descendants of the Counts of Toulouse and Odet de Foix, Vicomte de Lautrec and the Viscounts of Montfa, a village and commune of the Tarn department of southern France, close to the cities of Castres and Toulouse). His younger brother was born in 1867 but died the following year. Both sons enjoyed the titres de courtoisie of Comte. If Henri had outlived his father, he would have been accorded the family title of Comte de Toulouse- Lautrec. After the death of his brother, Toulouse-Lautrec's parents separated and a nanny eventually took care of him.Author Unknown, \\"Toulouse-Lautrec\\" ‚Äì published Grange Books. Bookfinder ‚Äì Toulouse Lautrec At the age of eight, Toulouse-Lautrec went to live with his mother in Paris, where he drew sketches and caricatures in his exercise workbooks. The family quickly realized that his talents lay in drawing and painting. A friend of his father, Ren√© Princeteau, sometimes visited to give informal lessons. Some of Toulouse- Lautrec's early paintings are of horses, a specialty of Princeteau, and a subject Lautrec revisited in his \\"Circus Paintings\\".ArT Blog : Toulouse- Lautrec at the Circus: The \\"Horse and Performer\\" Drawings Blogs.princeton.edu In 1875, Toulouse-Lautrec returned to Albi because his mother had concerns about his health. He took thermal baths at Am√©lie-les-Bains, and his mother consulted doctors in the hope of finding a way to improve her son's growth and development. Disability and health problems Mr. Toulouse paints Mr. Lautrec (ca. 1891) Toulouse-Lautrec's parents, the Comte and Comtesse, were first cousins (his grandmothers were sisters), and his congenital health conditions were attributed to a family history of inbreeding.Toulouse-Lautrec, H., Natanson, T., & Frankfurter, A. M. (1950). Toulouse-Lautrec: the man. N.p. p. 120. At the age of 13, Toulouse-Lautrec fractured his right femur, and at 14, he fractured his left femur. The breaks did not heal properly. Modern physicians attribute this to an unknown genetic disorder, possibly pycnodysostosis (sometimes known as Toulouse-Lautrec Syndrome), or a variant disorder along the lines of osteopetrosis, achondroplasia, or osteogenesis imperfecta. Rickets aggravated by praecox virilism has also been suggested. Afterward, his legs ceased to grow, so that as an adult he was extremely short (). He developed an adult-sized torso while retaining his child-sized legs. Additionally, he is reported to have had hypertrophied genitals. Physically unable to participate in many activities enjoyed by boys his age, Toulouse- Lautrec immersed himself in art. He became a prominent Post-Impressionist painter, art nouveau illustrator, and lithographer, and, through his works, recorded many details of the late-19th-century bohemian lifestyle in Paris. Toulouse-Lautrec contributed several illustrations to the magazine Le Rire during the mid-1890s. After initially failing college entrance exams, he passed his second attempt and completed his studies. Paris The Marble Polisher, 1882‚Äì1887, Princeton University Art Museum, probably painted while a student of Fernand Cormon, demonstrating his classical training During a stay in Nice, France, his progress in painting and drawing impressed Princeteau, who persuaded Toulouse-Lautrec's parents to let him return to Paris and study under the portrait painter L√©on Bonnat. He moved to Paris in 1882. Toulouse- Lautrec's mother had high ambitions and, with the aim of her son becoming a fashionable and respected painter, used their family's influence to get him into Bonnat's studio. He was drawn to Montmartre, the area of Paris famous for its bohemian lifestyle and the haunt of artists, writers, and philosophers. Studying with Bonnat placed Toulouse-Lautrec in the heart of Montmartre, an area he rarely left over the next 20 years. After Bonnat took a new job, Toulouse-Lautrec moved to the studio of Fernand Cormon in 1882 and studied for a further five years and established the group of friends he kept for the rest of his life. At this time, he met √âmile Bernard and Vincent van Gogh. Cormon, whose instruction was more relaxed than Bonnat's, allowed his pupils to roam Paris, looking for subjects to paint. During this period, Toulouse-Lautrec had his first encounter with a prostitute (reputedly sponsored by his friends), which led him to paint his first painting of a prostitute in Montmartre, a woman rumored to be Marie-Charlet. La toilette, oil on board, 1889alt=A thin woman's back and hair are prominent. She faces away from the viewer and has on only a towel and socks. = Early career = In 1885, Lautrec started to exhibit his work at the cabaret of Aristide Bruant's Mirliton. With his studies finished, in 1887, he participated in an exposition in Toulouse using the pseudonym \\"Tr√©clau,\\" the verlan of the family name \\"Lautrec.\\" He later exhibited in Paris with Van Gogh and Louis Anquetin. In 1885, Toulouse Lautrec met Suzanne Valadon. He made several portraits of her and supported her ambition as an artist. It is believed that they were lovers and that she wanted to marry him. Their relationship ended, and Valadon attempted suicide in 1888. = Rise to recognition = In 1888, the Belgian critic Octave Maus invited him to present eleven pieces at the Vingt (the Twenties) exhibition in Brussels in February. Van Gogh's brother Theo bought Poudre de Riz (Rice Powder) for 150 francs for the Goupil & Cie gallery. From 1889 until 1894, Toulouse-Lautrec took part in the Salon des Ind√©pendants regularly. He made several landscapes of Montmartre. Tucked deep into Montmartre in the garden of Monsieur Pere Foret, Toulouse-Lautrec executed a series of pleasant en plein air paintings of Carmen Gaudin, the same red-headed model who appears in The Laundress (1888). In 1890 during the banquet of the XX exhibition in Brussels, he challenged to a duel the artist Henri de Groux who criticized van Gogh works. Groux apologized, and the duel never took place. = The Ladies = In addition to his growing alcoholism, Toulouse-Lautrec also frequented prostitutes. He was fascinated by their lifestyle and the lifestyle of the \\"urban underclass\\" and incorporated those characters into his paintings. Fellow painter √âdouard Vuillard later said that while Toulouse-Lautrec did engage in sex with prostitutes, \\"the real reasons for his behavior were moral ones ... Lautrec was too proud to submit to his lot, as a physical freak, an aristocrat cut off from his kind by his grotesque appearance. He found an affinity between his condition and the moral penury of the prostitute.\\" The girls in the brothels inspired Toulouse-Lautrec. He would frequently visit one located in Rue d'Amboise, where he had a favorite called Mireille. He created about a hundred drawings and fifty paintings inspired by the life of these women. In 1892 and 1893, he created a series of two women kissing called Le Lit, and in 1894 painted Sal√≥n de la Rue des Moulins from memory in his studio. He declared, \\"A model is always a stuffed doll, but these women are alive. I wouldn't venture to pay them the hundred sous to sit for me, and god knows whether they would be worth it. They stretch out on the sofas like animals, make no demand and they are not in the least bit conceited.\\" He was well appreciated by the ladies, saying, \\"I have found girls of my own size! Nowhere else do I feel so much at home\\". = The Moulin Rouge = When the Moulin Rouge cabaret opened in 1889, Toulouse-Lautrec was commissioned to produce a series of posters. His mother had left Paris and, though he had a regular income from his family, making posters offered him a living of his own. Other artists looked down on the work, but he ignored them. The cabaret reserved a seat for him and displayed his paintings. Among the well-known works that he painted for the Moulin Rouge and other Parisian nightclubs are depictions of the singer Yvette Guilbert; the dancer Louise Weber, better known as La Goulue (The Glutton) who created the French can-can; and the much subtler dancer Jane Avril. London Woman at the Tub from the Portfolio Elles (1896) Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's family were Anglophiles, and though he was not as fluent as he pretended to be, he spoke English well enough. He traveled to London, where he was commissioned by the J. & E. Bella company to make a poster advertising their paper confetti (plaster confetti was banned after the 1892 Mardi Gras) and the bicycle advert La Cha√Æne Simpson. While in London, he met and befriended Oscar Wilde. When Wilde faced imprisonment in Britain, Toulouse-Lautrec became a very vocal supporter of him, and his portrait of Oscar Wilde was painted the same year as Wilde's trial. Alcoholism La Promeneuse by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Oil on cardboard, dated 1892. Toulouse-Lautrec was mocked for his short stature and physical appearance, which led him to abuse alcohol. He initially drank only beer and wine, but his tastes expanded into liquor, namely absinthe. The Earthquake cocktail (Tremblement de Terre) is attributed to Toulouse-Lautrec: a potent mixture containing half absinthe and half cognac in a wine goblet. Due to his underdeveloped legs, he walked with the aid of a cane, which he hollowed out and kept filled with liquor in order to ensure that he was never without alcohol. Cooking skills A fine and hospitable cook, Toulouse-Lautrec built up a collection of favorite recipes ‚Äì some original, some adapted ‚Äì which were posthumously published by his friend and dealer Maurice Joyant as L'Art de la Cuisine. The book was republished in English translation in 1966 as The Art of CuisineGrigson, J. Jane Grigson's Vegetable Book (1984), p. 422. ‚Äì a tribute to his inventive (and wide-ranging) cooking. Death Toulouse-Lautrec's grave in Verdelais By February 1899, Toulouse-Lautrec's alcoholism began to take its toll and he collapsed from exhaustion and the effects of alcoholism. His family had him committed to Folie Saint-James, a sanatorium in Neuilly- sur-Seine for three months. While he was committed, he drew 39 circus portraits. After his release, he returned to the Paris studio for a time and then traveled throughout France. His physical and mental health began to decline rapidly owing to alcoholism and syphilis, which he reportedly contracted from Rosa La Rouge, a prostitute who was the subject of several of his paintings. On 9 September 1901, at the age of 36, he died from complications due to alcoholism and syphilis at his mother's estate, Ch√¢teau Malrom√©, in Saint-Andr√©-du-Bois. He is buried in Cimeti√®re de Verdelais, Gironde, a few kilometers from the estate. His last words reportedly were \\"Le vieux con!\\" (\\"the old fool\\"), his goodbye to his father, though another version has been suggested, in which he used the word \\"hallali,\\" a term used by huntsmen at the moment the hounds kill their prey: \\"Je savais, Papa, que vous ne manqueriez pas l'hallali\\" (\\"I knew, papa, that you wouldn't miss the death.\\"). After Toulouse-Lautrec's death, his mother, Ad√®le Comtesse de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa, and his art dealer, Maurice Joyant, continued promoting his artwork. His mother contributed funds for a museum to be created in Albi, his birthplace, to show his works. This Mus√©e Toulouse-Lautrec owns the most extensive of his works. Art Self-portrait in the crowd (background center-left), At the Moulin Rouge, 1892, Art Institute of Chicago Moulin Rouge: La Goulue, poster (1891) In a career of less than 20 years, Toulouse-Lautrec created: * 737 canvased paintings * 275 watercolors * 363 prints and posters * 5,084 drawings * some ceramic and stained-glass work * an unknown number of lost works His debt to the Impressionists, particularly the more figurative painters like Manet and Degas, is apparent, that within his works, one can draw parallels to the detached barmaid at A Bar at the Folies- Berg√®re by Manet and the behind-the-scenes ballet dancers of Degas. His style was also influenced by the classical Japanese woodprints, which became popular in art circles in Paris.Berger, Klaus. (1992) Japonisme in Western Painting from Whistler to Matisse. Translated by David Britt. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 199. . He excelled at depicting people in their working environments, with the color and movement of the gaudy nightlife present but the glamour stripped away. He was a master at painting crowd scenes where each figure was highly individualized. At the time they were painted, the individual figures in his larger paintings could be identified by silhouette alone, and the names of many of these characters have been recorded. His treatment of his subject matter, whether as portraits, in scenes of Parisian nightlife, or as intimate studies, has been described as alternately \\"sympathetic\\" and \\"dispassionate\\". Toulouse-Lautrec's skilled depiction of people relied on his painterly style, which is highly linear and emphasizes contour. He often applied paint in long, thin brushstrokes, which would leave much of the board underneath showing through the paint. Many of his works may be best described as \\"drawings in coloured paint.\\" On 20 August 2018, Toulouse-Lautrec was the featured artist on the BBC television program Fake or Fortune?. Researchers attempted to discover whether he created two discovered sketchbooks.BBC - Fake or Fiction?

Nerdelbaum Frink Jr., or simply Professor Frink, is a recurring character in the animated television series The Simpsons. He is voiced by Hank Azaria, and first appeared in the 1991 episode \\"Old Money\\". Frink is Springfield's nerdy scientist and professor and is extremely intelligent, though somewhat mad and socially inept. Frink often tries to use his bizarre inventions to aid the town in its crises but they usually only make things worse. His manner of speech, including the impulsive shouting of nonsensical words, has become his trademark. Frink was originally depicted as an evil scientist in \\"Old Money\\", since he was trying to secure funding for a death ray. When Azaria ad-libbed a voice for the character, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's Julius Kelp character from The Nutty Professor. The staff liked the voice and therefore changed Frink to be more like Julius Kelp, both in appearance and personalityhe became more nerdy, and went from evil to just mad. Lewis later guest-starred on the show as Frink's father in the 2003 episode \\"Treehouse of Horror XIV\\". The professor has received acclaim from critics, particularly for his bizarre inventions such as the hamburger earmuffs, and he has appeared on many reviewers' listings of their favorite supporting characters from The Simpsons. Frink has been featured in other media relating to the show, such as comics, video games, and The Simpsons Ride, a simulator ride at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood. The character's popularity has led to him giving the name to the computer programming language Frink. Role in The Simpsons John Frink is generally depicted as Springfield's stereotypical nerdy, mad, and socially inept scientist, inventor, and mathematician. He wears thick glasses, a white lab coat, and pink pants, and has buckteeth. Frink is a college professor at Springfield Heights Institute of Technology and runs his own astronomical observatory. He has an IQ of 197it was 199 before he sustained a concussion during the collapse of Springfield's brief intellectual juntaand is a member of the Springfield chapter of Mensa. Frink is generally very polite and friendly. He has a trademark mannerism of using Jerry Lewis-style gibberish when excited, such as \\"HOYVIN-GLAVIN!\\" and \\"FLAVIN\\" and impulsively shouting other words that have no relevance to the situation at hand. He also occasionally refers to the importance of remembering to \\"carry the one\\" in various mathematical calculations. When he rambles he often speaks incoherently in run-on sentences without pauses. Frink also has a tendency to over-complicate simple matters and use or invent scientific terminology while expressing various concepts, e.g. \\"Father and I got along like positrons and antineutrinos!\\" or \\"microcalifragilistics\\". Frink often tries to use his mad and bizarre inventions to aid the town in its crises, but they usually do not work or only make things worse. Most of his inventions never function properly or are of no real use. He is the inventor of, among other things, a frog exaggerator (which grossly misrepresents the size of amphibians), automatic tapping shoes for tap dancing, the sarcasm detector, hamburger earmuffs, the 8-month-after pill, and a drilling machine that can cut through anything. Some of Frink's unsuccessful inventions include his small remote-controlled plane that carries babies as passengers (it crashed), and a burglar-proof house that sprouts legs and runs away from potential danger (the legs of which collapsed causing the house to crash to the ground and catch fire). As a scientist, Frink has discovered and cured \\"Frink's Disease\\" and discovered the element \\"Frinkonium\\". He has also mastered astrology to the point where he can use it to accurately predict the future, and has been shown to be capable of time travel. The professor has a son who is seen in \\"Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?\\" during a convention for infant and toddler products as a pilot of a remote-controlled plane (he flies out the window of the building while in the plane and crashes), and in \\"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot\\" at a robot battle (operating the robot). On the show, Frink has made mentions of a wife, but there have also been jokes about him having had little contact with women in his life. Frink often appears in the Treehouse of Horror Halloween episodes of The Simpsons, which are not accepted as canon and always take place outside the normal continuity of the show.Groening, Matt (2002). Audio commentary for \\"Treehouse of Horror\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Frink's bizarre inventions and understanding of advanced physics usually fit well into these supernatural plotlines.Groening, Matt; Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh; Cohen, David; Anderson, Bob; Silverman, David (2005). Audio commentary for \\"Treehouse of Horror VI\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In \\"Treehouse of Horror VIII\\", Bart enters Frink's matter teleporter and ‚Äì echoing the film The Fly ‚Äì it results in an accidental mix between Bart's genes and the genes of a housefly that was also present in the transporter at the same time. In \\"Treehouse of Horror XIV\\", it is revealed that Frink had a father who was killed by a shark, whom he brings back to life in the episode by piecing together his body parts. Unfortunately, the man decides to steal body parts to improve himself after he is revived. In the latter episode, Frink is awarded a Nobel Prize. Character Hank Azaria voices Frink Frink first appeared in the season two episode \\"Old Money\\" that aired on . In that episode, Grampa Simpson inherits $106,000 from his girlfriend when she dies. He eventually decides to spend it on people who are in need of money and holds interviews. In one of these interviews, Frink introduces Grampa to his latest invention, the Death Ray, claiming that \\"it is just a prototype. With proper funding I'm confident this little baby could destroy an area the size of New York City!\\" Grampa responds with \\"But I want to help people, not kill 'em!\\", to which Frink replies \\"Oh. Well, to be honest, the ray only has evil applications. You know my wife will be happy, she's hated this whole Death Ray thing from day one.\\" In the original script, Frink appeared more evil.Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Kogen, Jay; Silverman, David; Wolodarsky, Wallace (2002). Audio commentary for \\"Old Money\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. However, when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed a voice for Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's character Julius Kelp from the 1963 film The Nutty Professor, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of that character. Julius Kelp is a nerdy, mad professor, albeit not evil, and is often unsuccessful with his experiments, so Frink became more like that as the show progressed. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening told TV Guide that \\"He was just written as a mad scientist character until Hank did the voice, and suddenly he became this nutty professor persona. What I love about Hank is that, you give him a single lineand most of these characters have very few linesand he just brings it to life. Every time.\\" Frink was originally animated without his buckteeth; they were added later on to make him look even more like Lewis's character. Writer Jay Kogen named the character after his friend and fellow television writer John Frink, who was later hired on The Simpsons. Frink's nonsensical utterances are written in the scripts as \\"Frink noise\\". Azaria has voiced Frink ever since the first appearance of the professor. Of the many characters that Azaria voices, Frink is his favorite because he was a fan of Lewis in his younger years and he enjoys imitating the voice of the Nutty Professor. He has said that \\"once you start talking like [Julius Kelp] it's very hard to stop. On each take, I'll make it sillier, I always have. I'll add more and more stupid noises and sounds to it. If they let me keep going, it gets ridiculous.\\" As a homage to Lewis, Azaria conceived the idea of the \\"Treehouse of \\" segment in which Frink revives his dead father, with Lewis guest starring as the father. In a review of that episode, which aired around Halloween in 2003, Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that it is hard to tell Frink and his father's voices apart: \\"Azaria voices Frink with such a spot-on Lewis imitation that it's sometimes hard to tell which one of the two nutty professors is talking.\\" In addition, The Knoxville News-Sentinels Terry Morrow commented that \\"to hear Lewis doing Azaria doing Lewis is a mind-bending gut buster, the kind of pay-off that die-hard Simpsons fans live for.\\" Reception Frink is a popular character on The Simpsons and he has received acclaim from critics. Mark Hughes Cobb of The Tuscaloosa News named him his favorite secondary character from the show. Fort Worth Star-Telegrams Robert Philpot called the professor one of the five best supporting characters on The Simpsons, writing that \\"Springfield's mad scientist is a triumph of style over substance, with Hank Azaria giving him a ripoff Jerry Lewis voice that reminds you why we once thought Lewis was funny.\\" On their list of the top twenty-five peripheral Simpsons characters, IGN's Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brian Zoromski listed Frink at number fourteen, commenting that he fits nicely into the Simpsons universe \\"as the town's brilliant mad scientist.\\" They highlighted a scene from the episode \\"The PTA Disbands\\", in which Frink becomes a kindergarten substitute teacher and keeps one of the children's toys to himself because the children \\"wouldn't enjoy it on as many levels\\" as he did. Nick Griffiths of Radio Times named Frink one of the best characters of the show, stating that he has \\"always loved Professor Frink\\", particularly because of his appearance, gibberish talking, and overuse of the word \\"the\\", and because of his inventions such as the matter teleporter that turns Bart into half-human half-fly. The Sydney Morning Heralds David Hollingworth profiled Frink in his list of \\"TV's great tech figures\\", writing that apart from being smart, the professor is best known for his \\"rather idiosyncratic speech patterns ‚Äî hmmguyvin-whey-hey.\\" Joe Rhodes of TV Guide listed the following as the professor's most memorable line: \\"Sorry I'm late. There was trouble at the lab with the running and the exploding and the crying when the monkeys stole the glasses off my head.\\" Several critics have commented on Frink's inventions. Patrick Goss of MSN's Tech & Gadgets wrote that \\"When it comes to gizmos, Frink is the king\\", and listed the Death Ray as one of the greatest gadgets featured in The Simpsons. Although he added that it \\"was not one of [Frink's] most successful\\", since it never received the funding it needed from Grampa. On the same list, Goss also featured Frink's automatic phone dialer, intra bovine ice-cream maker (an invention that is inserted into a cow and uses the four stomachs to mix the various ingredients), and hamburger earmuffs. In a profile about Frink, the publication UGO Networks wrote: \\"Where would the town be without your Jerry Lewis/Julius Kelp-inspired voice and antics? A lot safer most likely. Professor John Frink's inventions range from distracting to disruptive. Who can forget his hamburger earmuffs? Or his teleportation device, responsible for switching Bart Simpson's head with that of a housefly?\\" Howard Waldrop and Lawrence Person of Locus listed the scene in The Simpsons Movie that features Frink's drilling machine invention as one of the highlights of the film. Merchandising and legacy Frink has appeared in various merchandise related to The Simpsons, including issues of Simpsons Comics, the simulator ride \\"The Simpsons Ride\\" at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood, and video games such as The Simpsons Wrestling, The Simpsons: Road Rage, The Simpsons: Hit & Run, and The Simpsons Game. He has also been turned into a Halloween-inspired action figure that was packaged with Kids Meals at Burger King in October and . In addition, Frink was featured on the cover of the issue of TV Guide. The professor has also affected real-life science. Frink, a computer programming language, was named after him. It is, according to creator of the language, \\"designed to make physical calculations simple, to help ensure that answers come out right, and to make a tool that's really useful in the real world. It tracks units of measure (feet, meters, kilograms, watts, etc.) through all calculations, allowing you to mix units of measure transparently, and helps you easily verify that your answers make sense.\\" References ;Footnotes ;Bibliography  External links * Professor Frink on IMDb Category:The Simpsons characters Category:Male characters in television Category:Television characters introduced in 1991 Category:Fictional inventors Category:Fictional mad scientists Category:Fictional Mensans Category:Fictional professors Category:Fictional Nobel laureates Category:Male characters in animation Category:Nerd culture pl:Postacie w serialu Simpsonowie#Profesor Frink ","title":"Professor Frink"},{"id":"64696","text":"Portrait of Russian boyar Pyotr Potemkin by Godfrey Kneller Russian bolyars in the 16th‚Äì17th centuries A boyar or bolyar was a member of the highest rank of the feudal Bulgarian, Russian, Serbian, Wallachian, Moldavian, and later Romanian, Lithuanian and Baltic German nobility, second only to the ruling princes (in Bulgaria, tsars) from the 10th century to the 17th century. The rank has lived on as a surname in Russia, Romania, Finland, Lithuania and Latvia where it is spelled PajariBehind the names: Pajari or BajƒÅrs/-a. Etymology Also known as bolyar; variants in other languages include or ; ; ; , ; and . The title Boila is predecessor or old form of the title Bolyar (the Bulgarian word for Boyar). Boila was a title worn by some of the Bulgar aristocrats (mostly of regional governors and noble warriors) in the First Bulgarian Empire (681‚Äì1018). The plural form of boila (\\"noble\\"), bolyare is attested in Bulgar inscriptionsBulgarian Etymological Dictionary, Volume I, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences publishing house, 1971, p. 719th century stone inscription from Bulgaria mentioning boyars ( boila) and rendered as boilades or boliades in the Greek of Byzantine documents.Constantine Porphyrogenitus, de Cerimoniis aulae Byzantinae, II, 46‚Äì47 Multiple different derivation theories of the word have been suggested by scholars and linguists, such as it having possible roots from old Turkic: bai (\\"noble, rich\\"; cf. \\"bay\\"), plus Turkic √§r (\\"man, men\\").Vasmer's Etymological Dictionary (Russian), or proto- Slavic \\"boj\\" (fight, battle). The title entered Old Russian as –±—ã–ª—è (bylya, attested solely in The Tale of Igor's Campaign). Bolyars in Bulgaria The oldest Slavic form of boyar‚Äîbolyarin, pl. bolyari (, )‚Äîdates from the 10th century, and it is found in Bulgaria, also popular as old Bulgar title boila, which denoted a high aristocratic status among the Bulgars. It was probably built from bol- meaning many and yarin, yarki-meanng bright, enlightened. In support of this hypothesis is the 10th-century diplomatic protocol of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, where the Bulgarian nobles are called boliades, while the 9th-century Bulgar sources call them boila. A member of the nobility during the First Bulgarian Empire was called a boila, while in the Second Bulgarian Empire, the corresponding title became bolyar or bolyarin. Bolyar, as well as its predecessor, boila, was a hereditary title. The Bulgarian bolyars were divided into veliki (\\"great\\") and malki (\\"minor\\"). Presently in Bulgaria, the word bolyari is used as a nickname for the inhabitants of Veliko Tarnovo‚Äîonce the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire. Boyars in Serbia In medieval Serbia, the rank of the boyars () was equivalent to the rank of the baron; meaning \\"free warrior\\" (or \\"free man\\" in general), it was the first rank after the non-free peasants or serfs. The etymology of the term comes from the word battle (); the boyars of Serbia were literally \\"men for the battle\\" or the warrior class, in contrast to the peasants; they could own land but were obliged to defend it and fight for the king. With the rule of the Ottoman Empire after 1450, the Ottoman as well as the Austro-Hungarian terms exchanged the Serbian one. Today, it is an archaic term representing the aristocracy (). Boyars in the lands of Kievan Rus' state Mounted Russian boyar from 17th century From the 9th to 13th century, boyars wielded considerable power through their military support of the Kievan princes. Power and prestige of many of them, however, soon came to depend almost completely on service to the state, family history of service and, to a lesser extent, land ownership. Boyars of Kievan Rus were visually very similar to knights, but after the Mongol invasion, their cultural links were mostly lost. The boyars occupied the highest state offices and, through a council (duma), advised the grand duke. They received extensive grants of land and, as members of the Boyars' Duma, were the major legislators of Kievan Rus'. After the Mongol invasion in the 13th century, the boyars from central and southern parts of Kievan Rus' (modern Belarus and Ukraine) were incorporated into Lithuanian and Polish nobility (szlachta). In the 16th and 17th centuries, many of those Ukrainian boyars who failed to get the status of a nobleman actively participated in the formation of the Cossack army, based in the south of modern Ukraine. Boyars in Old Russian Muscovy or Muscovite Rus' During the 14th and 15th centuries, the boyars of Moscow had considerable influence that continued from the Muscovy period. However, starting with the reign of Ivan III, the boyars were starting to lose that influence to the authoritative tsars in Russia. Because of Ivan III's expansionist policies, administrative changes were needed in order to ease the burden of governing Muscovy. Small principalities knew their loyal subjects by name, but after the consolidation of territories under Ivan, familial loyalty and friendship with the boyar's subjects turned those same subjects into administrative lists. The face of provincial rule disappeared. Boyar membership, until the 16th century, did not necessarily require one to be Russian, or even Orthodox, as historians note that many boyars came from places like Lithuania or the Nogais, and some remained Muslims for a generation after the Mongols were ousted. What is interesting about the boyars is their implied duties. Because boyars were not constitutionally instituted, much of their powers and duties came from agreements signed between princes. Agreements, such as one between Ivan III and Mikhail Borisovich in 1484 showed how allegiances needed to be earned and secured, rather than implied and enforced. Instead of the grand prince personally overseeing his lands, he had to rely on his captains and close advisors to oversee day-to-day operations. Instead of the great voice the boyars had previously in their advisory roles, they now had less bargaining power and mobility. They answered questions posed by the grand prince, and Ivan III even made sure to get their approval on special events, such as his marriage to Zoe Paleologa, or the attack on Novgorod. This was to ensure the boyars and their military power remained loyal to the tsar. The grand duke also made sure that peasants could not leave the princes‚Äô lands, or from one place to another, in the mid-1400s, effectively establishing serfdom. The boyars gained rewards and gifts as well. Some boyars were sent to regions as governors, and could ‚Äúfeed off‚Äù the locals in this way. Still, by the end of the 15th century, boyar membership had declined, and merit rather than belonging to the family decided who became a boyar. Then Ivan IV became the tsar, and more radical changes were implemented. Ivan IV became the grand prince of all Rus' in 1533 at the age of three, but various boyar factions tried to compete for control of the regency. When Ivan IV came to power in 1547, much more of the boyar's independent political power became obsolete. The independence and autonomy experienced by the princes of the regions in Russia was abolished under Ivan IV by the end of the sixteenth century, making them ‚Äúthe prince‚Äôs sons‚Äù, or just simple boyars serving the Grand Prince. Ivan IV divided Rus' into two parts in 1565, and in the private part, the terror began. The boyars attempted to band together and resist, but instead of constitutionally establishing their role in government, Ivan IV ruthlessly crushed the boyar opposition with the use of the oprichnina terror. Land grants were also given to subjects that provided military service, and soon this type of land grant became the more common compared to inherited land among the boyars. Ivan IV consolidated his power, centralized royal power, and made every effort possible to curb the influence of the princes. After Ivan IV, a time of troubles began when his son Fedor, died without an heir, ending the Rurik dynasty. The boyar Boris Godunov tried to proclaim himself tsar, but several boyar factions refuse to recognize him. The chaos continued after the first False Dmitriy gained the throne, and civil war erupted. When the Romanovs took over, the seventeenth century became one filled with administrative reform. A comprehensive legal code was introduced, and a merging of the boyars into the elite bureaucracy was beginning to form. By the end of the Time of Troubles, the boyars had lost nearly all independent power they had. Instead of going to Moscow to gain more power, the boyars felt defeated, and felt compelled to go to Moscow to maintain a united and strong Russia. Second, the boyars lost their independent principalities, where they maintained all their power, and instead governed districts and regions under the grand prince of the time. Boyars also lost their advisory influence over the grand prince with tools such as the duma, and instead the grand prince no longer felt compelled to listen to the demands of the boyars. Finally, the tsar no longer feared losing their military support, and unification of Russia became paramount in importance. With Peter the Great, the final nail in the coffin happened for the boyar's power, and they would never recover from his administrative reforms. Peter the Great, who took power in 1697, took it upon himself to westernize Russia, and catch it up with the modern world. After the revolt of the streltsy regiments in 1698, Peter the Great returned to Russia, forcing government officials and those that were financially able to have clean shaven faces and wear Western clothing. Peter also reformed the judicial system, and created a senate with members appointed by him, replacing the old council of boyars that originally advised the tsar. This move he made was one of many that dismantled the powers and status the boyars previously possessed. Peter was driving out the conservative and religious faction of the boyars out of the courts, and instead using both foreign and Russian officials to fill the administrative system. Several boyars, as well as other nobility, spoke out against these reforms, including historian Mikhail Shcherbatov, who stated that the reforms Peter made helped destroy Russian tradition, and created people that tried to ‚Äúworm their way up, by flattering and humoring the monarch and the grandees in every way.‚Äù Still, the reforms continued, as by this point, the tsar possessed too much power, and Russia became an absolute monarchy more and more with each ruler. Boyars in Galicia Being part of Ruthenia (also known in the Russian historiography as Kievan Rus), the Galician nobility originally were called boyars. With the annexation of Galicia by the Kingdom of Poland as the result of the Galicia-Volhynia wars, local boyars were equated since 1430 in rights along with Polish nobility (szlachta). A great number of boyars fled to the lands of Great Duchy of Lithuania in Volhynia and Podolia.Szlachta. Encyclopedia of Ukraine Boyars in Wallachia and Moldavia Wallachian vornic »òerban GrƒÉdi»ôteanu wearing a kalpak, an indication of his boyar rank In the Carpathian regions inhabited by Romanians, the boyar () class emerged from the chiefs (named (\\"leader\\") or (\\"judge\\") in the areas north of the Danube, and south of the river) of rural communities in the early Middle Ages, initially elected, who later made their judicial and administrative attributions hereditary and gradually expanded them upon other communities. After the appearance of more advanced political structures in the area, their privileged status had to be confirmed by the central power, which used this prerogative to include in the boyar class individuals that distinguished themselves in the military or civilian functions they performed (by allocating them lands from the princely domains). = The boyar condition = The Romanian social hierarchy was composed of boyar, , and . Being a boyar implied three things: being a land-owner, having serfs, and having a military and/or administrative function. A boyar could have a state function and/or a court function. These functions were called or . Only the prince had the power to assign a boierie. Landowners with serfs but no function were categorized as but were still considered to be of noble origin (, which translates literally as \\"of boyar bones\\"). Small landowners who possessed a domain without distinction () or serfs were called . According to some historians, they were descendants of mazil landowners. = Origin = Although functions could only be accorded by the prince and were not hereditary, land possession was hereditary. The prince could give land to somebody but could not take it from its possessor except for serious reasons such as treason. Therefore, there were two kinds of boyars: those whose ancestors, as chiefs of the ancient rural communities, had held land before the formation of the feudal states, such that the prince merely confirmed their preexisting status as landowners; and those who acquired their domain from a princely donation or who had inherited it from an ancestor who acquired it through such a donation (cf. the distinction between Uradel and Briefadel in the Holy Roman Empire and in its feudal successor regimes). During the Phanariot r√©gime, there were also boyars who had no land at all, but only a function. This way, the number of boyars could be increased, by selling functions to those who could afford them. = Hierarchy = Boyars with gorlatnaya hats in a painting by Andrei Ryabushkin. The higher hats indicated higher social status. The close alliance between the boyar condition and the military-administrative functions led to a confusion, aggravated by the Phanariots: these functions began to be considered as noble titles, like in the Occident. In fact, this was not at all the case. Traditionally, the boyars were organized in three states: boyars of the first, second, and third states. For example, there was a first or a grand postelnic, a second postelnic, and a third postelnic, each one with his different obligations and rights. The difference of condition was visible even in the vestimentation or physical aspect. Only the boyars of the first state had the right, for example, to grow a beard, the rest being entitled only to a mustache. Within the class of the boyars of the first state, there was the subclass of the \\"grand boyars\\". Those were great landowners who also had some very high functions, such as the function of great vornic. Above those grand boyars was only the prince. = The prince = Usually a prince was a boyar before his election or appointment as prince, but this was not an absolute condition. Initially, only princely descendants could be elected princes. During the Phanariot epoch, however, any man could be a prince if appointed by the sultan (and rich enough to buy this appointment from the grand vizier). During the Ottoman suzerainty, and especially during the Phanariot r√©gime, the title of Prince became an administrative function within the imperial Ottoman hierarchy, and thus the ultimate form of boyardness. The title of Prince of Wallachia or Moldavia was equivalent in dignity to that of a pasha with two horse-tails.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. , ; c. 1551) ruled the Tsardom of Russia as de facto regent from c. 1585 to 1598 and then as the first non-Rurikid tsar from 1598 to 1605. After the end of his reign, Russia descended into the Time of Troubles. Early years Boris Godunov was the most noted member of an ancient, now extinct, Russian family of Tatar origin (Chet), which came from the Horde to Kostroma in the early 14th century. This cites: * Platon Vasilievich Pavlov, On the Historical Significance of the Reign of Boris Godunov (Rus.) (Moscow, 1850) * Sergyei Mikhailivich Solovev, History of Russia (Rus.) (2nd ed., vols. vii.-viii., St Petersburg, 1897). This legend is written in the annals dating from early 17th century. He was descended from the Tatar Prince Chet, who went from the Golden Horde to Russia and founded the Ipatiev Monastery in Kostroma. Boris was the son of Feodor Ivanovich Godunov \\"Krivoy\\" (\\"the one-eyed\\") (died, c. 1568‚Äì1570) and his wife Stepanida Ivanovna. His older brother Vasily died young and without issue. Godunov's career began at the court of Ivan the Terrible. He is mentioned in 1570 for taking part in the Serpeisk campaign as an archer of the guard. The following year he became an oprichnik ‚Äì a member of Ivan's personal guard and secret police. In 1570/1571, Godunov strengthened his position at court by his marriage to Maria Grigorievna Skuratova-Belskaya, the daughter of Malyuta Skuratov-Belskiy, head of the oprichniks. In 1580, the Tsar chose Boris Godunov's sister Irina Godunova (1557 ‚Äì 26 October/23 November 1603) to be the wife of his second son and eventual heir, the fourteen-year-old Feodor Ivanovich (1557‚Äì1598). On this occasion, Godunov was promoted to the rank of Boyar. On 15 November 1581, Godunov was present when the Tsar murdered his own eldest son, the crown prince Ivan. Godunov tried to intervene but received blows from the Tsar's sceptre. The elder Ivan immediately repented, and Godunov rushed to get help for the Tsarevich, who died four days later. Regency Three years later, on his deathbed, Ivan IV appointed a council consisting of Godunov, Feodor Nikitich Romanov, Vasili Shuiski and others to guide his son and successor of Russia Feodor I, who was feeble both in mind and body: \\"he took refuge from the dangers of the palace in devotion to religion; and though his people called him a saint, they recognized that he lacked the iron to govern men.\\" At the time of his death, Ivan also had a three-year-old son, Dmitry Ivanovich (1581‚Äì1591), from his seventh and last marriage. This son (and his mother's family) had no claim to the throne because the Orthodox Church recognized only Ivan's first three marriages as legitimate. Shortly after Ivan's death the council had both Dmitri and his mother, Maria Nagaya, moved to Uglich, some 120 miles north of Moscow. Dmitri died there in 1591 at the age of ten under suspicious circumstances. When Dmitri's death was announced by the ringing of the church bell, the Uglich population rose up to protest the suspected assassination, which they believed was commissioned by Boris Godunov. Troops swiftly quelled the rebellion. Godunov ordered the removal of the Uglich bell's clapper (the bell's \\"tongue\\"). He had the offending bell flogged in public and exiled to Siberia along with the townspeople who had not been executed.Haywood, Anthony, Siberia: A Cultural History, Signal Books Ltd, 2010, 288 p., , p. 80. An official commission headed by Vasili Shuiski was sent to determine the cause of death. The official verdict was that the boy had cut his throat during an epileptic seizure. Ivan's widow claimed that her son had been murdered by Godunov's agents. Godunov's guilt was never established and shortly thereafter Dmitri's mother was forced to take the veil. Dmitry Ivanovich was laid to rest and promptly, though temporarily, forgotten. Godunov's estate near Moscow At the coronation of Feodor Ivanovich as Tsar Feodor I on 31 May 1584, Boris received honors and riches as a member of the regency council, in which he held the second place during the life of the Tsar's uncle Nikita Romanovich. When Nikita died in 1586, Boris had no serious rival for the regency. A conspiracy of other boyars and of Dionysius II, Metropolitan of Moscow, sought to break Boris's power by divorcing the Tsar from Godunov's childless sister. The attempt proved unsuccessful, and the conspirators were banished or sent to monasteries. After that, Godunov remained supreme in Russia and he corresponded with foreign princes as their equal. His policy was generally pacific and always prudent. In 1595, he recovered from Sweden some towns lost during the former reign. Five years previously he had defeated a Tatar raid upon Moscow, for which he received the title of Konyushy, an obsolete dignity even higher than that of Boyar. He supported an anti-Turkish faction in the Crimea and gave the Khan subsidies in his war against the sultan. Godunov encouraged English merchants to trade with Russia by exempting them from duties. He built towns and fortresses along the north-eastern and south- eastern borders of Russia to keep the Tatar and Finnic tribes in order. These included Samara, Saratov, Voronezh, and Tsaritsyn, as well as other lesser towns. He colonized Siberia with scores of new settlements, including Tobolsk. During his rule, the Russian Orthodox Church received its patriarchate, placing it on an equal footing with the ancient Eastern churches and freeing it from the influence of the Patriarch of Constantinople. This pleased the Tsar, as Feodor took a great interest in church affairs. In Godunov's most important domestic reform, a 1597 decree forbade peasants to transfer from one landowner to another (which they had been free to do each year around Saint George's Day in November), thus binding them to the soil. This ordinance aimed to secure revenue, but it led to the institution of serfdom in its most oppressive form. (See also Serfdom in Russia.) Reign On the death of the childless Feodor on 7 January 1598, as well as the rumored assassination of Feodor's much younger brother Dimitry, supposedly ordered by Boris himself to guarantee his seat on the throne, self-preservation as much as ambition led Boris to seize the throne. Had he not done so, the mildest treatment he could have hoped for would have been lifelong seclusion in a monastery. His election was proposed by Patriarch Job of Moscow, who believed that Boris was the one man capable of coping with the difficulties of the situation. Boris, however, would accept the throne only from the Zemsky Sobor (national assembly), which met on 17 February and unanimously elected him on 21 February. On 1 September, he was solemnly crowned tsar. Godunov Mausoleum in front of the Cathedral of the Assumption at the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius During the first years of his reign, he was both popular and prosperous, and ruled well. He recognized the need for Russia to catch up with the intellectual progress of the West and did his best to bring about educational and social reforms. He was the first tsar to import foreign teachers on a large scale, the first to send young Russians abroad to be educated, and the first to allow Lutheran churches to be built in Russia. After the Russo‚ÄìSwedish War (1590‚Äì1595), he pursued gaining access to the Baltic Sea and attempted to obtain Livonia by diplomatic means. He cultivated friendly relations with the Scandinavians and hoped to take a bride from a foreign royal house, thereby increasing the dignity of his own dynasty. However he declined the personal union proposed to him in 1600 by the diplomatic mission led by Lew Sapieha from the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Boris died after a lengthy illness and a stroke on 13/23 April 1605. He left one son, Feodor II, who succeeded him and ruled for only a few months, until he and Boris' widow were murdered by the enemies of the Godunovs in Moscow on 10/20 June 1605. Boris's first son, Ivan, was born in 1587 and died in 1588. His daughter, Xenia, was born in 1582. She was engaged to Johann of Schleswig- Holstein, but he died shortly before their planned wedding in October 1602. Xenia was given the name \\"Olga\\" upon being forced to take monastic vows at the Voskresensky Monastery in Beloozero and her name is inscribed as \\"the Nun Olga Borisovna\\" at the crypt of the Godunovs at the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius where she lived from 1606, when she sojourned there to attend the reburial of her father, until her death in 1622. Boris, his wife, and their children are buried together in a mausoleum near the entrance of the Assumption Cathedral at Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra. Arts and popular media Boris' life was dramatised by the founder of Russian literature, Alexander Pushkin, in his play Boris Godunov (1831), which was inspired by Shakespeare's Henry IV. Modest Mussorgsky based his opera Boris Godunov on Pushkin's play. Sergei Prokofiev later wrote incidental music for Pushkin's drama. In 1997, the score of a 1710 baroque opera based on the reign of Boris by German composer Johann Mattheson was rediscovered in Armenia and returned to Hamburg, Germany. This opera, never performed during the composer's lifetime, had its world premiere in 2005 at the Boston Early Music Festival & Exhibition. Boris was portrayed on BBC Radio 4 by Shaun Dooley in the radio plays Ivan the Terrible: Absolute Power and Boris Godunov: Ghosts written by Mike Walker and which were the first two plays in the first series of Tsar. The plays were broadcast on 11 and 18 September 2016. The character Boris Badenov in the cartoon The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show takes his name from a play on Godunov's name.

Tehran is the hub of Iran's transport and communication system. Iran has a long paved road system linking most of its towns and all of its cities. In 2011 the country had of roads, of which 73% were paved. In 2008 there were nearly 100 passenger cars for every 1,000 inhabitants. Trains operate on 11,106 km (6,942 mi) of railroad track. The country's major port of entry is Bandar-Abbas on the Strait of Hormuz. After arriving in Iran, imported goods are distributed throughout the country by trucks and freight trains. The Tehran‚ÄìBandar-Abbas railroad, opened in 1995, connects Bandar-Abbas to the railroad system of Central Asia via Tehran and Mashhad. Other major ports include Bandar e-Anzali and Bandar e-Torkeman on the Caspian Sea and Khorramshahr and Bandar-e Emam Khomeyni on the Persian Gulf. Dozens of cities have airports that serve passenger and cargo planes. Iran Air, the national airline, was founded in 1962 and operates domestic and international flights. All large cities have mass transit systems using buses, and several private companies provide bus service between cities. Hamadan and Tehran hold the highest betweenness and closeness centrality among the cities of Iran, regarding road and air routes, respectively. Transport in Iran is inexpensive because of the government's subsidization of the price of gasoline. The downside is a huge draw on government coffers, economic inefficiency because of highly wasteful consumption patterns, contraband with neighboring countries and air pollution. In 2008, more than one million people worked in the transportation sector, accounting for 9% of GDP.  Ministry of Road and Transportation  The Ministry of Roads and Transportation is in charge of studying and deciding pricing policy of the transportation; as well as issuing licenses for the establishment of transportation firms. In addition, the Ministry is in charge of implementing comprehensive and integrated transportation policies in Iran. As of 2016, plans for foreign direct investment in the transport sector include over 5,600 km of highways, 745 km of freeways, and close to 3,000 km of main roads. These projects and others are worth $25 billion (not including aircraft purchases worth another $50 billion). Iran says it needs more than $40 billion to complete 258 major unfinished transportation projects (2016).  Railways  right *Total: 11,106 km Plan to increase total railways length from 13,500 km in 2016 to 20,000 km by 2025. **Standard gauge: 8,273 km of gauge (146 km electrified) (2006) **Broad gauge: 94 km of gauge (connected to Pakistan Railways) Electrified railway is 146 km from Tabriz to Jolfa and the tender for electrification of Tehran‚ÄìMashhad has been finished according to Railway electrification in Iran. Note: Broad-gauge track is employed at the borders with Azerbaijan Republic and Turkmenistan which have broad gauge rail systems; 41 km of the standard gauge, electrified track is in suburban service at Tehran (2007). The majority of transport in Iran is road-based. The government plans to transport 3.5% of the passenger volume and 8.5% of the freight volume by rail. Extensive electrification is planned. The railway network expands by about 500 km per year according to the Ministry of R&T.; = Railway links with adjacent countries = In December 2014, a rail line from Iran opened to Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan.

As of 2015, 34,000 km of roads provided essential corridors of transportation, while 45,000 km of major roads and 100,000 km of roads connecting villages and rural areas have seen no maintenance and upkeep practices (worth a total of $57 billion). As of 2020, cycling hold less than 1% share of urban transport in Iran.http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/440456/Cycling-holds-less-than-1-share- of-urban-transport-in-Iran = Road accidents = Iran ranks 23d worldwide in traffic deaths per 100,000 population per year, with a rate of 24.3, half the rate of the worst country, Eritrea. Iran ranks first worldwide in terms of having the largest number of road accidents with 38,000 deaths and injuries per year. Other sources place the total number of fatalities at 100,000 over the past 6 years or 20,000 per year on average (2008). Transport officials say 46.8 percent of car accidents take place in cities, 21.5 percent outside, 19.5 percent on rural routes, 4.2 percent on urban highways and 4.2 percent on suburban highways.Iran Daily ‚Äì Domestic Economy ‚Äì 07/27/08 Pedestrians account for 45% of traffic deaths in Tehran. The high death tolls in car accidents are blamed on high speed, unsafe vehicles, widespread disregard of traffic laws and inadequate emergency services. Motorcycles account for 50 percent of sound pollution in Tehran and 40-45 percent of accidents.  Waterways  850 km (on Karun River; additional service on Lake Urmia) (2006) Note: the Shatt al-Arab is usually navigable by maritime traffic for about 130 km; channel has been dredged to 3 m and is in use.

Bandar Abbas is run by the Shaheed Rajaee Port Authority. Chabahar Port, the southernmost Iranian port, on the Gulf of Oman, a couple dozen kilometers from the Iran - Pakistan border, is being recently expanded and developed partly with Indian public funding, and in connection with the INSTC North-South overland transportation corridor linking Iran with Afghanistan, the Caucasus countries, Turkey and Russia.,,https://www.pmo.ir/pso_content/media/files/2013/5/23606.pdfhttps://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iran/bandar- e-chabahar.htmhttps://financialtribune.com/articles/domestic- economy/101987/indian-budget-allocates-close-to-14-million-to-chabahar-port **Major Export Terminals (loading capacity): Kharg Island , Lavan Island , Neka (Caspian sea) , Assaluyeh gas liquids, Kish Island, Abadan, Bandar-e Eman Khomeyni) and Bandar Mahshahr (latter 2 close-by ports are used mostly by NPC for petrochemicals export). ***Major Oil/Gas Ports: ****Kharg Island: is the largest and main export terminal in Iran. Roughly 90% of Iran's exports are sent via Kharg. Kharg's loading system has a capacity of 5.0 million bbl/d. The terminal processes all onshore production (the Iranian Heavy and Iranian Light Blends) and offshore production from the Froozan field (the Froozan Blend). The Kharg terminal includes the main T-jetty, the Sea Island that is located on the west side of Kharg, and the Dariush terminal to the south. Kharg Island relies on storage to ensure even operations, and its current storage capacity is expected to increase to 28 million barrels of oil in 2014.US Energy Information Agency ****Lavan Island, mostly handles exports of the Lavan Blend sourced from offshore fields. Lavan is Iran's highest-quality export grade and one of Iran's smallest streams. Lavan's production averaged less than 100,000 bbl/d in 2013, but the Lavan facilities have the capacity to process 200,000 bbl/d of crude oil. Lavan has a two-berth jetty, which can accommodate vessels up to 250,000 deadweight tons. Lavan's storage capacity is 5.5 million barrels. ****Sirri Island: serves as a loading port for the Sirri Blend that is produced in the offshore fields of the same name.

Iran's airports are improving their international connections, and Arak Airport in Markazi province has recently begun to operate international flights, making a total of five such airports in the country, in addition to ten local airports. In May 2007 international flights into the capital, Tehran, were moved to the Imam Khomeini International Airport (IKIA), just outside the city because of capacity constraints at the existing central Mehrabad Airport. *Airports: 319 (2013) *There are 54 \\"major\\" airports in Iran (2008): 8 international, 21 air border, and 25 domestic. *Number of flights from airports nationwide reached 31,088 in a month (October 20 ‚Äì November 20, 2008): 10,510 domestic, 4,229 international and 15,404 transit. *Airport capacity for departures and arrivals: 73 million persons (2011) *Number of passengers departing and arriving at airports: 40.1 million persons (2011) *Share of non-public sector in domestic flights: 60% (2011) *Share of non-public sector in international flights: 58.7% (2011) National airline: *Iran Air handles 6 million passengers annually (2016) = Airports ‚Äì with paved runways = Imam Khomeini International Airport Total: 140 (2013) :over 3,047 m: 42 :2,438 to 3,047 m: 29 :1,524 to 2,437 m: 26 :914 to 1,523 m: 36 :under 914 m: 7 (2013) = Airports ‚Äì with unpaved runways = Total: 179 (2013) :over 3,047 m: 1 :1,524 to 2,437 m: 2 :914 to 1,523 m: 135 :under 914 m: 32 (2013) = Heliports = Total: 26 (2013)  Transit statistics  Iran's non-oil foreign trade (2011). = People = * In 2011, some 27 million travelers and businessmen passed custom departments. * Over five million passengers have been transported via border points mainly Mehran and Bazargan. * In 2002, about 70% of visitors arrived by land, about 29% by air and less than 1% by sea = Commodities = * In 2011, cargoss and commodities from 100 countries have been transported across Iran. Over 10.5 million tons of oil products and non-oil commodities were transited via land (91% via road and 9% via railroad) and marine borders. * In 2010, 10 million tons of commodities from 110 countries, worth $31.5 billion, transited through Iran for 82 destinations. * In 2009, the value of goods transited was about $25 billion. This figure constitutes seven percent of the GDP. * From March 22, 2009 until September 22, 2009 over 3 million tons of goods worth some $11.3 billion were transited through Iran. Regarding the countries of origin, China was first in terms of volume, Turkmenistan ranked second, Uzbekistan came third, Turkey fourth and UAE fifth. Among the destinations, Afghanistan was first, Iraq second, Azerbaijan third, UAE fourth and Turkmenistan ranked fifth. *Some 33 million tons of goods and 29 million passengers are transported annually by the rail transportation network, accounting for 9 percent and 11 percent of the whole transportations in the country (2011). * Per capita parcel post for each Iranian stands at 15 per annum (2008). * One million tons of commodities, fuel and barter have been transited abroad per month (2008). **Fuel is transported in Iran by road tankers, tank wagons, tanker ships as well as through pipelines. Nearly 10,000 tankers from 400 private sector companies transport fuel by road. In 2013, nearly 87 billion liters of fuel were transported by Iranian tankers. Iran's tank wagons and ships transported 3 billion liters and 8 billion liters of fuel, respectively. ** 3.498 million tons of non-oil commodities were transited abroad via Iran during March 20-November 20, 2008 (79% of the commodities were transited by road).  Mode of transport  * More than 90 percent of the country's imports and exports, particularly in the fisheries and oil sectors, are undertaken through the sea (2009). * In 2008, 84% of the transited goods through Iran were transported through roads while the rest was transported via railroad.  Port of entry  * In 2011, Bandar Abbas was the country's most active border in terms of transit (37 percent), followed by Parvizkhan (17 percent), Bazargan (9 percent) and Bashmaq (7 percent). * In 2008, some 24 border crossings except Kileh in Sardasht (West Azarbaijan) and Yazdan in Southern Khorasan were active nationwide. Bandar Abbas, contributing 40.8% of transit operations, was considered the most dynamic in terms of transiting cargo. It was followed by Bazargan (16.6 percent), Sarakhs (14.1 percent), Bandar Anzali (9.2 percent) and Pileh-Savar (3.9 percent).  Economics  * Every ton of transit cargo earns $150 for the country and creates 40 jobs. Iran will earn a revenue of US$12 billion when the volume of goods transported through the country reaches 40 million tons annually. = TRACECA = In September 2009, Iran formally joined the Transport Corridor Europe ‚Äì Caucasus ‚Äì Asia (TRACECA) programme, also known as the \\"new Silk Road.\\" TRACECA was founded in 1998 with the aim of promoting economic relations, trade and transport communications between Europe, the Caucasus and Asia. This programme consists of the EU and 14 member states (including Iran) from Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. Iran's strategic location means that it is a key transport corridor between Europe and Central Asia. In August 2010, Iran declared that it \\"did not sign on to TRACECA project\\" and said it has been fostering improved transport links through a series of bilateral agreements with neighboring states instead. According to Iran's first Vice-President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi \\"If all the potential of the country's transit sector is tapped, it can bring in as much revenues as [the] oil [industry]\\". He also announced that Iran will join China and Europe by rail in the near future.

Geography is a very significant factor in informing Iran's foreign policy. Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the newly born Islamic Republic, under the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini, dramatically reversed the pro-American foreign policy of the last Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Since then the country's policies have oscillated between the two opposing tendencies of revolutionary ardour, which would eliminate Western and non-Muslim influences while promoting the Islamic revolution abroad, and pragmatism, which would advance economic development and normalization of relations. Iran's bilateral dealings are accordingly sometimes confused and contradictory. Iran currently maintains full diplomatic relations with 97 countries worldwide. According to data published by the Reputation Institute, Iran is the world's second most hated country, just ahead of Iraq, and has held that position for the three consecutive years of 2016, 2017, and 2018.CountryReptTrak: 2018 . Reputation Institute. Accessed 24 April 2019.Staufenberg, Jess. \\"Countries with the best and worst reputations for 2016 revealed\\" . The Independent. 11 August 2016. Islamism and nuclear proliferation are recurring issues with Iran's foreign relations. In a series of international polls by Pew Research in 2012, only one country (Pakistan) had the majority of its population supporting Iran's right to acquire nuclear arms; every other population polled overwhelmingly rejected a nuclear-armed Iran (90‚Äì95% opposed in the polled European, North American, and South American countries), and majorities in most of them were in favor of military action to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran from materializing. Additionally, the majority of Americans, Brazilians, Japanese, Mexicans, Egyptians, Germans, Brits, French, Italians, Spaniards, and Poles (among other national groups) had majority support for \\"tougher sanctions\\" on Iran, while majorities in China, Russia, and Turkey opposed tougher sanctions.\\"A Global ‚ÄúNo‚Äù To a Nuclear-Armed Iran\\" . Pew Research Center. May 2012. History Iranians have traditionally been highly sensitive to foreign interference in their country, pointing to such events as the Russian conquest of northern parts of the country in the course of the 19th century, the tobacco concession, the British and Russian occupations of the First and Second World Wars, and the CIA plot to overthrow Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq. This suspicion manifests itself in attitudes that many foreigners might find incomprehensible, such as the \\"fairly common\\" belief that the Iranian Revolution was actually the work of a conspiracy between Iran's Shi'a clergy and the British government.Movali, Ifshin, The Soul of Iran, Norton, 2005 This may have been a result of the anti-Shah bias in BBC Radio's influential Persian broadcasts into Iran: a BBC report of 23 March 2009 explains that many in Iran saw the broadcaster and the government as one, and interpreted the bias for Khomeini as evidence of weakening British government support for the Shah. It is entirely plausible that the BBC did indeed help hasten revolutionary events. Revolutionary period under Khomeini Under the Khomeini government Iran's foreign policy often emphasized the elimination of foreign influence and the spread of Islamic revolution over state-to-state relations or the furtherance of trade. In Khomeini's own words, > We shall export our revolution to the whole world. Until the cry \\"There is > no God but Allah\\" resounds over the whole world, there will be struggle.[11 > February 1979 (according to Dilip Hiro in The Longest War p.32) p.108 from > Excerpts from Speeches and Messages of Imam Khomeini on the Unity of the > Muslims. The Islamic Republic's effort to spread the revolution is considered to have begun in earnest in March 1982, when 380 men from more than 25 Arab and Islamic nations met at the former Tehran Hilton Hotel for a \\"seminar\\" on the \\"ideal Islamic government\\" and, less academically, the launch of a large-scale offensive to cleanse the Islamic world of the satanic Western and Communist influences that were seen to be hindering the Islamic world's progress. The gathering of militants, primarily Shi'a but including some Sunnis, \\"with various religious and revolutionary credentials,\\" was hosted by the Association of Militant Clerics and the Pasdaran Islamic Revolutionary Guards.Wright, Robin, Sacred Rage (2001), p.28 The nerve centre of the revolutionary crusade, operational since shortly after the 1979 revolution, was located in downtown Tehran and known to outsiders as the \\"Taleghani Centre\\". Here the groundwork for the gathering was prepared: the establishment of Arab cadres, recruited or imported from surrounding countries to spread the revolution, and provision of headquarters for such groups as the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, the Iraqi Shi'a movement, and Philippine Moro, Kuwaiti, Saudi, North African and Lebanese militant clerics. These groups came under the umbrella of the \\"Council for the Islamic Revolution\\", which was supervised by Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, the designated heir of Ayatollah Khomeini. Most of the council's members were clerics, but they also reportedly included advisors from the Syrian and Libyan intelligence agencies. The council apparently received more than $1 billion annually in contributions from the faithful in other countries and in funds allocated by the Iranian government.Wright, Robin, Sacred Rage, (2001), p. 33 Its strategy was two- pronged: armed struggle against what were perceived as Western imperialism and its agents; and an internal purifying process to free Islamic territory and Muslim minds of non-Islamic cultural, intellectual and spiritual influences, by providing justice, services, resources to the mustazafin (weak) masses of the Muslim world. These attempts to spread its Islamic revolution strained the country's relations with many of its Arab neighbours, and the extrajudicial execution of Iranian dissidents in Europe unnerved European nations, particularly France and Germany. For example, the Islamic Republic expressed its opinion of Egypt's secular government by naming a street in Tehran after Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's killer, Khalid al-Istanbuli.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p. 143 At this time Iran found itself very isolated, but this was a secondary consideration to the spread of revolutionary ideals across the Persian Gulf and confrontation with the US (or \\"Great Satan\\") in the 1979-1981 hostage crisis. =Training volunteers= Arab and other Muslim volunteers who came to Iran were trained in camps run by the Revolutionary Guards. There were three primary bases in Tehran, and others in Ahvaz, Isfahan, Qom, Shiraz, and Mashhad, and a further facility, converted in 1984, near the southern naval base at Bushire.Wright, Robin, Sacred Rage, (2001), pp. 34-5 In 1981 Iran supported an attempt to overthrow the Bahraini government, in 1983 expressed political support for Shi'ites who bombed Western embassies in Kuwait, and in 1987 Iranian pilgrims rioted at poor living conditions and treatment during the Hajj (pilgrimage) in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and were consequently massacred. Nations with strong fundamentalist movements, such as Egypt and Algeria, also began to mistrust Iran. With the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Iran was thought to be supporting the creation of the Hizballah organization. Furthermore, Iran went on to oppose the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli peace process, because it saw Israel as an illegal country. = Iran‚ÄìIraq War = Relations with Iraq had never been good historically; however, they took a turn for the worse in 1980, when Iraq invaded Iran. The stated reason for Iraq's invasion was the contested sovereignty over the Shatt al-Arab waterway (Arvand Rud in Persian). Other reasons, unstated, were probably more significant: Iran and Iraq had a history of interference in each other's affairs by supporting separatist movements, and although this interference had ceased since the Algiers Agreement (1975), after the Revolution Iran resumed support for Kurdish guerrillas in Iraq. Iran demanded the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Iranian territory and the return to the status quo ante for the Shatt al-Arab, as established under the Algiers Agreement. This period saw Iran become even more isolated, with virtually no allies. Exhausted by the war, Iran signed UN Security Council Resolution 598 in July 1988, after the United States and Germany began supplying Iraq with chemical weapons. The ceasefire resulting from the UN resolution was implemented on 20 August 1988. Neither nation had made any real gains in the war, which left one million dead and had a dramatic effect on the country's foreign policy. From this point on, the Islamic Republic recognized that it had no choice but to moderate its radical approach and rationalize its objectives. This was the beginning of what Anoushiravan Ehteshami calls the \\"reorientation phase\\" of Iranian foreign policy. =Pragmatism= Like other revolutionary states, practical considerations have sometimes led the Islamic Republic to inconsistency and subordination of such ideological concerns as pan-Islamic solidarity. One observer, Graham Fuller, has called the Islamic Republic \\"stunningly silent\\" > about [Muslim] Chechens in [non-Muslim] Russia, or Uyghurs in China,See > Uyghurs Human Rights Project simply because the Iranian state has important > strategic ties with both China and Russia that need to be preserved in the > state interest. Iran has astonishingly even supported Christian Armenia > against Shi'ite Azerbaijan and has been careful not to lend too much support > to Islamic Tajiks in Tajikistan, where the language is basically a dialect > of Persian. In this regard the Islamic Republic resembles another revolutionary state, the old Soviet Union. The USSR was ideologically committed not to Islam but to world proletarian revolution, led by Communist parties under its leadership, but \\"frequently abandoned support to foreign communist parties when it served Soviet national interests to cooperate with the governments that were oppressing them.\\"Fuller, Graham E., The Future of Political Islam, Palgrave MacMillan (2003), p. 41 =Post-War period (1988‚Äìpresent)= Khatami (in office: 1997‚Äì2005) played a key role in repairing Iran's foreign relations with Europe. Since the end of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, Iran's new foreign policy has had a dramatic effect on its global standing. Relations with the European Union have dramatically improved, to the point where Iran is a major oil exporter and a trading partner with such countries as Italy, France, and Germany. China and India have also emerged as friends of Iran; these three countries face similar challenges in the global economy as they industrialize, and consequently find themselves aligned on a number of issues. Iran maintains regular diplomatic and commercial relations with Russia and the former Soviet Republics. Both Iran and Russia believe they have important national interests at stake in developments in Central Asia and the Transcaucasus, particularly concerning energy resources from the Caspian Sea. =Significant historical treaties= * Treaty of Zuhab by which Iran irrevocably lost Mesopotamia (Iraq) to the Ottomans. Roughly settled the modern-day Iran-Iraq-Turkey borders * Treaty of Gulistan 1813, by which Iran irrevocably lost Georgia, Dagestan, and most of Azerbaijan. * Treaty of Turkmenchay 1828, by which Iran irrevocably lost Armenia and the remainder of the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan (comprising the Lankaran and Nakchivan khanates. * Treaty of Akhal * Treaty of Paris (1857) (by which Iran renounced claims over Herat and parts of Afghanistan) * Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 Current policies Ali Khamenei with Swedish Prime Minister Stefan L√∂fven, 11 February 2017 The Islamic Republic of Iran accords priority to its relations with the other states in the region and with the rest of the Islamic world. This includes a strong commitment to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Non-Aligned Movement. Relations with the states of the Arab Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), especially with Saudi Arabia, are characterized by rivalry and hostility. An unresolved territorial dispute with the United Arab Emirates concerning three islands in the Persian Gulf continues to mar its relations with these states. Iran has close relations with Kuwait. Iran seeks new allies around the world due to its increasing political and economic isolation in the international community.Fredrik Dahl, \\"Iran cleric says time to export the revolution\\" , \\"Reuters\\", 4 September 2009\\"Iran Seeks Allies in South America\\" , 2 January 2012 This isolation is evident in the various economic sanctions and the EU oil embargo that have been implemented in response to questions that have been raised over the Iranian nuclear program.\\"EU Iran sanctions: Ministers adopt Iran oil imports ban\\" , \\"BBC News\\", 23 January 2012 Tehran supports the Interim Governing Council in Iraq, but it strongly advocates a prompt and full transfer of state authority to the Iraqi people. Iran hopes for stabilization in Afghanistan and supports the reconstruction effort so that the Afghan refugees in Iran (which number approximately 2.5 million.Afghan Refugees in Iran, \\" \\", International Peace Research Institute, Oslo, 16 June 2004. Retrieved 29 April 2007.) can return to their homeland and the flow of drugs from Afghanistan can be stemmed. Iran is also pursuing a policy of stabilization and cooperation with the countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia, whereby it is seeking to capitalise on its central location to establish itself as the political and economic hub of the region. On the international scene, it has been argued by some that Iran has become, or will become in the near future, a superpower due to its ability to influence international events. Others, such as Robert Baer, have argued that Iran is already an energy superpower and is on its way to becoming an empire. Flynt Leverett calls Iran a rising power that might well become a nuclear power in coming years‚Äîif the US does not prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear technology, as part of a grand bargain under which Iran would cease its nuclear activities in exchange for a guarantee of its borders by the US. =Current territorial disputes= Southern Caspian Energy Prospects (portion of Iran). Country Profile 2004. * Iran and Iraq restored diplomatic relations in 1990, but they are still trying to work out written agreements settling outstanding disputes from their eight-year war concerning border demarcation, prisoners of war, and freedom of navigation in and sovereignty over the Shatt al-Arab waterway. * Iran governs and possesses two islands in the Persian Gulf claimed by the UAE: Lesser Tunb (which the UAE calls Tunb as Sughra in Arabic, and Iran calls Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Kuchek in Persian) and Greater Tunb (Arabic Tunb al Kubra, Persian Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Bozorg). * Iran jointly administers with the UAE an island in the Persian Gulf claimed by the UAE (Arabic Abu Musa, Persian, Jazireh-ye Abu Musa), over which Iran has taken steps to exert unilateral control since 1992, including access restrictions. * The Caspian Sea borders between Azerbaijan, Iran, and Turkmenistan are not yet determined, although this problem is set to be resolved peacefully in the coming years through slow negotiations. After the breakup of the USSR, the newly independent republics bordering the Caspian Sea claimed shares of territorial waters and the seabed, thus unilaterally abrogating the existing half-and-half USSR-Iran agreements which, like all other Soviet treaties, the republics had agreed to respect upon their independence. It has been suggested by these countries that the Caspian Sea should be divided in proportion to each bordering country's shoreline, in which case Iran's share would be reduced to about 13%. The Iranian side has expressed eagerness to know if this means that all Irano‚ÄìRussian and ‚ÄìSoviet agreements are void, entitling Iran to claim territorial sovereignty over lands lost to Russia by treaties that the parties still consider vivant. Issues between Russia, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan were settled in 2003, but Iran does not recognize these agreements, on the premise that the international law governing open water can not be applied to the Caspian Sea, which is in fact a lake (a landlocked body of water). Iran has not pressed its Caspian territorial claims in recent years because it relies heavily on Russia's support in its nuclear-development battle with the West.

Relations between Tehran and Khartoum have continued to grow, especially since April 2006, when then President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad voiced his opposition to the deployment in the Darfur region of Western peacekeepers from the United Nations. Sudan ardently supports Iran's nuclear program. Both countries are also firmly against Israel. Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki said the two countries were seeing increasing ties in regional and international fields to mutual benefit, as he called for a \\"continuation of consultations\\".

During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Iran supported Pakistan under the reign of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and opened the Iran- Pakistan border to provide fuel and arms to the Pakistani soldiers. After the 1971 war Iran tried to strengthen its ties with Pakistan's arch rival India. The Shah of Iran planned to annex the Balochistan province as Pakistan would surrender after a loss of the 1971 war. Following the Iranian revolution of 1979, Pakistan started having close relations with Saudi Arabia. Their relations are complex, driven by Pakistani geo-political aspirations, religious affiliations, Iran's relations with India, and internal and external factors. - valign=\\"top\\" See Iran‚ÄìPalestine relations The Islamic Republic of Iran (established after the 1979 Iranian Revolution) closed the Israeli embassy in Tehran and replaced it with a Palestinian embassy. Iran favours a Palestinian state and officially endorses the replacement of Israel with a unitary Palestinian state or whatever choice the Palestinian people decide through a democratic vote. However, in a 2006 interview, the former reformer President Mohammad Khatami said that Iran has also stated its willingness to accept a two-state solution if the Palestinians find this acceptable. The Iranian government regularly sends aid to various Palestinian causes, everything from transporting injured children to hospitals to supplying the Palestinian Islamist militant groups Islamic Jihad and Hamas with arms. Streets and squares named after Palestinians crisscross the nation.Molavi, Afshin,Soul of Iran, Norton, 2005 Several Palestinian militant resistance groups, including Hamas, are Iranian allies. The Iranian government also gives substantial assistance to the Hamas government in Gaza, which is embargoed by Israel, and depends on outside sources for an estimated 90% of its budget. Iranian support has not been unconditional however, and in July and August 2011 Iran cut funding to show its displeasure at \\"Hamas's failure to hold public rallies in support\\" of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian Civil War.

Saudi Arabia and Iran established diplomatic relations in 1928. In 1966 King Faisal of Saudi Arabia visited Iran with the aim of further strengthening the relationships between the countries. The Shah (King) of Iran reciprocated by paying an official visit to Saudi Arabia, which eventually led to a peaceful resolution of a dispute concerning the islands of Farsi and Arabi: it was agreed that Farsi would belong to Iran and Arabi would be under the control of Saudi Arabia. A unique feature of this agreement is that it assigned only territorial waters to the islands, not the continental shelf.Kaven L. Afrasiab, \\"Saudi-Iran Tension Fuel Wider Conflict\\" Asia Times, 6 December 2006. http://www.atimes.com/atime/Middle_East/HLO6AKo4.html. In 1968, when Great Britain announced its withdrawal from the Persian Gulf, Iran and Saudi Arabia took the primary responsibility for peace and security in the region. During the 1970s, Saudi Arabia's main bilateral concerns were Iran's modernization of its military, which was capable of dominating the entire region, and Iran's repossession of the Islands of Big Tunb, Little Tunb and Abu Moussa in 1971, challenging the United Arab Emirates' claim to the Islands. Despite these frictions, the friendliness of Iran‚ÄìSaudi Arabia relations reached a peak in the period between 1968 and 1979. After the Iranian Revolution in 1979, Khomeini and other Iranian leaders openly attacked and criticized the character and religious legitimacy of the Saudi regime.

Accordingly, there has been a lot of political and cultural exchange, and Georgia was often considered a part of Greater Iran. Iran (Persia) and Georgia, or the Georgian kingdoms, have had relations in different forms, beginning with trade in the Achaemenid era. The relationship got more complex as the Safavids took power in Iran and attempted to maintain Iranian control of the Georgian kingdoms. This continued until the 19th century when Russia, through the Russo-Persian War (1804‚Äì13) and Russo- Persian War (1826‚Äì1828), took the Caucasus from the Qajars, and thus Iran irrevocably lost the whole region, including Georgia.

He was an innovator of Russian music in the romantic period. He strove to achieve a uniquely Russian musical identity, often in deliberate defiance of the established conventions of Western music. Many of his works were inspired by Russian history, Russian folklore, and other national themes. Such works include the opera Boris Godunov, the orchestral tone poem Night on Bald Mountain and the piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition. For many years Mussorgsky's works were mainly known in versions revised or completed by other composers. Many of his most important compositions have posthumously come into their own in their original forms, and some of the original scores are now also available. Name The aristocratic Mussorgsky brothers‚ÄîFilaret (also known as \\"Yevgeniy\\", left), and Modest (right), 1858. Monument on a place of Mussorgky family house in . The spelling and pronunciation of the composer's name has caused some confusion. The family name derives from a 15th- or 16th-century ancestor, Roman Vasilyevich Monastyryov, who appears in the Velvet Book, the 17th-century genealogy of Russian boyars. Roman Vasilyevich bore the nickname \\"Musorga\\" (from , meaning 'music maker'), and was the grandfather of the first Mussorgsky. The composer could trace his lineage to Rurik, the legendary 9th- century founder of the Russian state.Taruskin (1993: pp. xxx, 384) In Mussorgsky family documents the spelling of the name varies: \\"Musarskiy\\", \\"Muserskiy\\", \\"Muserskoy\\", \\"Musirskoy\\", \\"Musorskiy\\", and \\"Musurskiy\\". The baptismal record gives the composer's name as \\"Muserskiy\\".Taruskin (1993: pp. xxvii‚Äìxxviii) In early (up to 1858) letters to Mily Balakirev, the composer signed his name \\"Musorskiy\\" ().Musorgskiy (1984: pp. 10‚Äì12) The \\"g\\" made its first appearance in a letter to Balakirev in 1863.Musorgskiy (1984: p. 44) Mussorgsky used this new spelling (, Musorgskiy) to the end of his life, but occasionally reverted to the earlier \\"Musorskiy\\".Musorgskiy (1984: p. 238)Taruskin (1993: p. xxviii) The addition of the \\"g\\" to the name was likely initiated by the composer's elder brother Filaret to obscure the resemblance of the name's root to an unsavory Russian word:Taruskin (1993: p. xxx) :–º—É—Åo—Ä (m√∫sor) ‚Äî n. m. debris, rubbish, refuseSmirnitsky (1985: p. 300) Mussorgsky apparently did not take the new spelling seriously, and played on the \\"rubbish\\" connection in letters to Vladimir Stasov and to Stasov's family, routinely signing his name Musoryanin, roughly \\"garbage-dweller\\" (compare dvoryanin: \\"nobleman\\"). The first syllable of the name originally received the stress (i.e., M√öS-…ôr-skiy), and does so to this day in Russia, including the composer's home district. The mutability of the second-syllable vowel in the versions of the name mentioned above gives evidence that this syllable did not receive the stress.Taruskin (1993: pp. xxviii, xxx) The addition of the \\"g\\" and the accompanying shift in stress to the second syllable (i.e., Mu-S√ìRK- skiy), sometimes described as a Polish variant, was supported by Filaret Mussorgsky's descendants until his line ended in the 20th century. Their example was followed by many influential Russians, such as Fyodor Shalyapin, Nikolay Golovanov, and Tikhon Khrennikov, who, perhaps dismayed that the great composer's name was \\"reminiscent of garbage\\", supported the erroneous second- syllable stress that has also become entrenched in the West.Taruskin (1993: pp. xxvii‚Äìxxxi) The Western convention of doubling the first \\"s\\", which is not observed in scholarly literature (e.g., The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians), likely arose because in many Western European languages a single intervocalic /s/ often becomes voiced to /z/ (as in \\"music\\"), unlike in Slavic languages where the intervocalic /s/ is always unvoiced. Doubling the consonant thus reinforces its voiceless sibilant /s/ sound. 'Modest' is the Russian form of the name 'Modestus' which means 'moderate' or 'restrained' in Late Latin. He was called 'Modinka' (), diminutive form with the stressed O, by his close friends and relatives. Life =Early years= Young Mussorgsky as a cadet in the Preobrazhensky Regiment of the Imperial Guard. Mussorgsky was born in Karevo, Toropets Uyezd, Pskov Governorate, Russian Empire, south of Saint Petersburg. His wealthy and land-owning family, the noble family of Mussorgsky, is reputedly descended from the first Ruthenian ruler, Rurik, through the sovereign princes of Smolensk. However, his mother Julia Chirikova (1813‚Äì1865) was the daughter of a comparatively non-rich nobleman. Modest's paternal grandmother Irina used to be a serf and could be sold without land in his grandfather's estate. At age six, Mussorgsky began receiving piano lessons from his mother, herself a trained pianist. His progress was sufficiently rapid that three years later he was able to perform a John Field concerto and works by Franz Liszt for family and friends. At 10, he and his brother were taken to Saint Petersburg to study at the elite German language Petrischule (St. Peter's School). While there, Modest studied the piano with the noted Anton Gerke. In 1852, the 12-year-old Mussorgsky published a piano piece titled \\"Porte-enseigne Polka\\" at his father's expense. Mussorgsky's parents planned the move to Saint Petersburg so that both their sons would renew the family tradition of military service.Brown (2002: p. 3). To this end, Mussorgsky entered the Cadet School of the Guards at age 13. Sharp controversy had arisen over the educational attitudes at the time of both this institute and its director, a General Sutgof. All agreed the Cadet School could be a brutal place, especially for new recruits. More tellingly for Mussorgsky, it was likely where he began his eventual path to alcoholism.Brown, 5. According to a former student, singer and composer Nikolai Kompaneisky, Sutgof \\"was proud when a cadet returned from leave drunk with champagne.\\"As quoted in Brown, 4 Music remained important to him, however. Sutgof's daughter was also a pupil of Gerke, and Mussorgsky was allowed to attend lessons with her.Brown, 4. His skills as a pianist made him much in demand by fellow-cadets; for them he would play dances interspersed with his own improvisations.Brown (2002: p. 6). In 1856 Mussorgsky ‚Äì who had developed a strong interest in history and studied German philosophy ‚Äì graduated from the Cadet School. Following family tradition he received a commission with the Preobrazhensky Regiment, the foremost regiment of the Russian Imperial Guard. = Maturity = In October 1856 the 17-year-old Mussorgsky met the 22-year-old Alexander Borodin while both men served at a military hospital in Saint Petersburg. The two were soon on good terms.Brown (2002: p. 8). Borodin later remembered, Alexander Dargomyzhsky More portentous was Mussorgsky's introduction that winter to Alexander Dargomyzhsky, at that time the most important Russian composer after Mikhail Glinka. Dargomyzhsky was impressed with Mussorgsky's pianism. As a result, Mussorgsky became a fixture at Dargomyzhsky's soir√©es. There, critic Vladimir Stasov later recalled, he began \\"his true musical life.\\"Brown, 10. Over the next two years at Dargomyzhsky's, Mussorgsky met several figures of importance in Russia's cultural life, among them Stasov, C√©sar Cui (a fellow officer), and Mily Balakirev. Balakirev had an especially strong impact. Within days he took it upon himself to help shape Mussorgsky's fate as a composer. He recalled to Stasov, \\"Because I am not a theorist, I could not teach him harmony (as, for instance Rimsky-Korsakov now teaches it) ... [but] I explained to him the form of compositions, and to do this we played through both Beethoven symphonies [as piano duets] and much else (Schumann, Schubert, Glinka, and others), analyzing the form.\\"Brown, 12‚Äì13. Up to this point Mussorgsky had known nothing but piano music; his knowledge of more radical recent music was virtually non-existent. Balakirev started filling these gaps in Mussorgsky's knowledge.Brown, 12. In 1858, within a few months of beginning his studies with Balakirev, Mussorgsky resigned his commission to devote himself entirely to music.Brown, 14. He also suffered a painful crisis at this time. This may have had a spiritual component (in a letter to Balakirev the young man referred to \\"mysticism and cynical thoughts about the Deity\\"), but its exact nature will probably never be known. In 1859, the 20-year-old gained valuable theatrical experience by assisting in a production of Glinka's opera A Life for the Tsar on the Glebovo estate of a former singer and her wealthy husband; he also met Konstantin Lyadov (father of Anatoly Lyadov) and enjoyed a formative visit to Moscow ‚Äì after which he professed a love of \\"everything Russian\\". Mussorgsky and his brother were also inspired by the gothic script, they were using an \\"M\\" personal sign instead of family coat of arms, very similar to the symbols of the early Rurikids. In spite of this epiphany, Mussorgsky's music leaned more toward foreign models; a four-hand piano sonata which he produced in 1860 contains his only movement in sonata form. Nor is any 'nationalistic' impulse easily discernible in the incidental music for Vladislav Ozerov's play Oedipus in Athens, on which he worked between the ages of 19 and 22 (and then abandoned unfinished), or in the Intermezzo in modo classico for piano solo (revised and orchestrated in 1867). The latter was the only important piece he composed between December 1860 and August 1863: the reasons for this probably lie in the painful re-emergence of his subjective crisis in 1860 and the purely objective difficulties which resulted from the emancipation of the serfs the following year ‚Äì as a result of which the family was deprived of half its estate, and Mussorgsky had to spend a good deal of time in Karevo unsuccessfully attempting to stave off their looming impoverishment. Gustave Flaubert. Mussorgsky started an opera based on his Salammb√¥ but did not finish it. By this time, Mussorgsky had freed himself from the influence of Balakirev and was largely teaching himself. In 1863 he began an opera ‚Äì Salammb√¥ ‚Äì on which he worked between 1863 and 1866 before losing interest in the project. During this period he had returned to Saint Petersburg and was supporting himself as a low-grade civil-servant while living in a six-man \\"commune\\". In a heady artistic and intellectual atmosphere, he read and discussed a wide range of modern artistic and scientific ideas ‚Äì including those of the provocative writer Chernyshevsky, known for the bold assertion that, in art, \\"form and content are opposites\\". Under such influences he came more and more to embrace the ideal of artistic realism and all that it entailed, whether this concerned the responsibility to depict life \\"as it is truly lived\\"; the preoccupation with the lower strata of society; or the rejection of repeating, symmetrical musical forms as insufficiently true to the unrepeating, unpredictable course of \\"real life\\". \\"Real life\\" affected Mussorgsky painfully in 1865, when his mother died; it was at this point that the composer had his first serious bout of alcoholism, which forced him to leave the commune to stay with his brother. The 26-year- old was, however, on the point of writing his first realistic songs (including \\"Hopak\\" and \\"Darling Savishna\\", both of them composed in 1866 and among his first \\"real\\" publications the following year). The year 1867 was also the one in which he finished the original orchestral version of his Night on Bald Mountain (which, however, Balakirev criticised and refused to conduct, with the result that it was never performed during Mussorgsky's lifetime). =Peak= Mussorgsky's career as a civil servant was by no means stable or secure: though he was assigned to various posts and even received a promotion in these early years, in 1867 he was declared 'supernumerary' ‚Äì remaining 'in service', but receiving no wages. Decisive developments were occurring in his artistic life, however. Although it was in 1867 that Stasov first referred to the 'kuchka' ('The Five') of Russian composers loosely grouped around Balakirev, Mussorgsky was by then ceasing to seek Balakirev's approval and was moving closer to the older Alexander Dargomyzhsky. Ivan Melnikov as the title character in Boris Godunov, 1874 Since 1866 Dargomyzhsky had been working on his opera The Stone Guest, a version of the Don Juan story with a Pushkin text that he declared would be set \\"just as it stands, so that the inner truth of the text should not be distorted\\", and in a manner that abolished the 'unrealistic' division between aria and recitative in favour of a continuous mode of syllabic but lyrically heightened declamation somewhere between the two. Under the influence of this work (and the ideas of Georg Gottfried Gervinus, according to whom \\"the highest natural object of musical imitation is emotion, and the method of imitating emotion is to mimic speech\\"), Mussorgsky in 1868 rapidly set the first eleven scenes of Nikolai Gogol's The Marriage (Zhenitba), with his priority being to render into music the natural accents and patterns of the play's naturalistic and deliberately humdrum dialogue. This work marked an extreme position in Mussorgsky's pursuit of naturalistic word-setting: he abandoned it unorchestrated after reaching the end of his 'Act 1', and though its characteristically 'Mussorgskyian' declamation is to be heard in all his later vocal music, the naturalistic mode of vocal writing more and more became merely one expressive element among many. Fyodor Komissarzhevsky as The Pretender in Boris Godunov A few months after abandoning Zhenitba, the 29-year-old Mussorgsky was encouraged to write an opera on the story of Boris Godunov. This he did, assembling and shaping a text from Pushkin's play and Karamzin's history. He completed the large-scale score the following year while living with friends and working for the Forestry Department. In 1871, however, the finished opera was rejected for theatrical performance, apparently because of its lack of any 'prima donna' role. Mussorgsky set to work producing a revised and enlarged 'second version'. During the next year, which he spent sharing rooms with Rimsky- Korsakov, he made changes that went beyond those requested by the theatre. In this version the opera was accepted, probably in May 1872, and three excerpts were staged at the Mariinsky Theatre in 1873. It is often asserted that in 1872 the opera was rejected a second time, but no specific evidence for this exists. By the time of the first production of Boris Godunov in February 1874, Mussorgsky had taken part in the ill-fated Mlada project (in the course of which he had made a choral version of his Night on Bald Mountain) and had begun Khovanshchina. Though far from being a critical success ‚Äì and in spite of receiving only a dozen or so performances ‚Äì the popular reaction in favour of Boris made this the peak of Mussorgsky's career. =Decline= From this peak a pattern of decline becomes increasingly apparent. Already the Balakirev circle was disintegrating. Mussorgsky was especially bitter about this. He wrote to Vladimir Stasov, \\"[T]he Mighty Handful has degenerated into soulless traitors.\\"Letter to Vladimir Stasov, 9 October 1875. As quoted in Rimsky- Korsakov (1923: pp. 154‚Äì55, footnote 24). In drifting away from his old friends, Mussorgsky had been seen to fall victim to 'fits of madness' that could well have been alcoholism-related. His friend Viktor Hartmann had died, and his relative and recent roommate Arseny Golenishchev-Kutuzov (who furnished the poems for the song-cycle Sunless and would go on to provide those for the Songs and Dances of Death) had moved away to get married. Mussorgsky engaged a new and prominent personal private physician about 1870, Dr. George Leon Carrick, sometime Secretary and later President of the St. Petersburg Physicians' SocietyAshby, F., \\"The Carricks of St.Petersburg\\" in The Caledonian Phalanx ‚Äì Scots in Russia, Edinburgh, 1987, p. 96. and a cousin of Sir Harry Lauder.\\"The Ancestry of Sir Harry Lauder\\" by Gregory Lauder- Frost, F.S.A. Scot., in The Scottish Genealogist. vol. LIII, No. 2, June 2006, , pp. 74‚Äì87, where Dr.Carrick's mother is given as the sister of Harry Lauder's grandfather, John Lauder. Ilya Repin's celebrated portrait of Mussorgsky, painted 2‚Äì5 March 1881, only a few days before the composer's death. While Mussorgsky suffered personally from alcoholism, it was also a behavior pattern considered typical for those of Mussorgsky's generation who wanted to oppose the establishment and protest through extreme forms of behavior.Volkov (1995: p. 87). One contemporary notes, \\"an intense worship of Bacchus was considered to be almost obligatory for a writer of that period. It was a showing off, a 'pose,' for the best people of the [eighteen-]sixties.\\" Another writes, \\"Talented people in Russia who love the simple folk cannot but drink.\\"Quoted in Sovietskaia muzyka (Soviet Music) 9 (1980), 104. As quoted in Volkov (1995: p. 87). Mussorgsky spent day and night in a Saint Petersburg tavern of low repute, the Maly Yaroslavets, accompanied by other bohemian dropouts. He and his fellow drinkers idealized their alcoholism, perhaps seeing it as ethical and aesthetic opposition. This bravado, however, led to little more than isolation and eventual self-destruction. For a time Mussorgsky was able to maintain his creative output: his compositions from 1874 include Sunless, the Khovanshchina Prelude, and the piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition (in memory of Hartmann); he also began work on another opera based on Gogol, The Fair at Sorochyntsi (for which he produced another choral version of Night on Bald Mountain). Grave of Modest Mussorgsky in the Tikhvin Cemetery of the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in Saint Petersburg In the years that followed, Mussorgsky's decline became increasingly steep. Although now part of a new circle of eminent personages that included singers, medical men and actors, he was increasingly unable to resist drinking, and a succession of deaths among his closest associates caused him great pain. At times, however, his alcoholism would seem to be in check, and among the most powerful works composed during his last six years are the four Songs and Dances of Death. His civil service career was made more precarious by his frequent 'illnesses' and absences, and he was fortunate to obtain a transfer to a post (in the Office of Government Control) where his music-loving superior treated him with great leniency ‚Äì in 1879 even allowing him to spend three months touring twelve cities as a singer's accompanist. The decline could not be halted, however. In 1880 he was finally dismissed from government service. Aware of his destitution, one group of friends organised a stipend designed to support the completion of Khovanshchina; another group organised a similar fund to pay him to complete The Fair at Sorochyntsi. However, neither work was completed (although Khovanshchina, in piano score with only two numbers uncomposed, came close to being finished). In early 1881 a desperate Mussorgsky declared to a friend that there was 'nothing left but begging', and suffered four seizures in rapid succession. Also, Modest suffered from delirium tremens during this period. Though he found a comfortable room in a good hospital ‚Äì and for several weeks even appeared to be rallying ‚Äì the situation was hopeless. Repin painted the famous red-nosed portrait in what were to be the last days of the composer's life: a week after his 42nd birthday, he was dead. He was interred at the Tikhvin Cemetery of the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in Saint Petersburg.Wilson, Scott. Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons, 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Locations 34064‚Äì65). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition. Mussorgsky, like others of 'The Five', was perceived as extremist by the Emperor and much of his court. This may have been the reason Tsar Alexander III personally crossed off Boris Godunov from the list of proposed pieces for the Imperial Opera in 1888.Volkov (1995: pp. 106‚Äì07). Works Mussorgsky's works, while strikingly novel, are stylistically Romantic and draw heavily on Russian musical themes. He has been the inspiration for many Russian composers, including most notably Dmitri Shostakovich (in his late symphonies) and Sergei Prokofiev (in his operas). In 1868/1869 he composed the opera Boris Godunov, about the life of the Russian tsar, but it was rejected by the Mariinsky Opera. Mussorgsky thus edited the work, making a final version in 1874. The early version is considered darker and more concise than the later version, but also more crude. Nikolai Rimsky- Korsakov re-orchestrated the opera in 1896 and revised it in 1908. The opera has also been revised by other composers, notably Shostakovich, who made two versions, one for film and one for stage. The opera Khovanshchina was unfinished and unperformed when Mussorgsky died, but it was completed by Rimsky-Korsakov and received its premiere in 1886 in Saint Petersburg. This opera, too, was revised by Shostakovich. The Fair at Sorochyntsi, another opera, was left incomplete at his death but a dance excerpt, the Gopak, is frequently performed. Mussorgsky's most imaginative and frequently performed work is the cycle of piano pieces describing paintings in sound called Pictures at an Exhibition. This composition, best known through an orchestral arrangement by Maurice Ravel, was written in commemoration of his friend, the architect Viktor Hartmann. Mussorgsky's single-movement orchestral work Night on Bald Mountain enjoyed broad popular recognition in the 1940s when it was featured, in tandem with Schubert's 'Ave Maria', in the 1940 Walt Disney animated film Fantasia. Among the composer's other works are a number of songs, including three song cycles: The Nursery (1872), Sunless (1874) and Songs and Dances of Death (1877); plus Mephistopheles' Song of the Flea and many others. Important early recordings of songs by Mussorgsky were made by tenor Vladimir Rosing in the 1920s and 1930s.Juynboll (1991: pp. 194‚Äì96). Other recordings have been made by Boris Christoff between 1951 and 1957 and by Sergei Leiferkus in 1993.Kozinn (2004: pp. 143‚Äì47). Criticism Contemporary opinions of Mussorgsky as a composer and person varied from positive to ambiguous to negative. Mussorgsky's eventual supporters, Vladimir Stasov and Mily Balakirev, initially registered strongly negative impressions of the composer. Stasov wrote Balakirev, in an 1863 letter, \\"I have no use for Mussorgsky. His views may tally with mine, but I have never heard him express an intelligent idea. All in him is flabby, dull. He is, it seems to me, a thorough idiot\\", and Balakirev agreed: \\"Yes, Mussorgsky is little short of an idiot.\\"Calvocoressi (1934: p. 6). Mixed impressions are recorded by Rimsky- Korsakov and Tchaikovsky, colleagues of Mussorgsky who, unlike him, made their living as composers. Both praised his talent while expressing disappointment with his technique. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that Mussorgsky's scores included While preparing an edition of Sorochints√Ø Fair, Anatoly Lyadov remarked: \\"It is easy enough to correct Mussorgsky's irregularities. The only trouble is that when this is done, the character and originality of the music are done away with, and the composer's individuality vanishes.\\"Calvocoressi (1956: p. 219) Tchaikovsky, in a letter to his patroness Nadezhda von Meck, was also critical of Mussorgsky: Western perceptions of Mussorgsky changed with the European premiere of Boris Godunov in 1908. Before the premiere, he was regarded as an eccentric in the west. Critic Edward Dannreuther, wrote, in the 1905 edition of The Oxford History of Music, \\"Mussorgsky, in his vocal efforts, appears wilfully eccentric. His style impresses the Western ear as barbarously ugly.\\"Calvocoressi (1956: p. 224) However, after the premiere, views on Mussorgsky's music changed drastically. Gerald Abraham, a musicologist, and an authority on Mussorgsky: \\"As a musical translator of words and all that can be expressed in words, of psychological states, and even physical movement, he is unsurpassed; as an absolute musician he was hopelessly limited, with remarkably little ability to construct pure music or even a purely musical texture.\\" In popular culture Modest Mussorgsky monument in Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine, est. 2012. Mussorgsky's tone poem Night on Bald Mountain was used in the 1940 animated film Fantasia, accompanied by an animation of Chernobog summoning evil spirits on a mountain. It segues into Ave Maria by Franz Schubert. The progressive rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer performed and recorded an arrangement of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, featuring lyrics by Greg Lake, and released it as a live album of the same name.

In the first century AD, it became a province of the Roman Empire. Its borders were the Danube to the north, Raetia and Vindelicia to the west, Pannonia to the east and southeast, and Italia (Venetia et Histria) to the south. The kingdom was founded around 400 BC, and had its capital at the royal residence at Virunum on the Magdalensberg. Area and population Around 800 BC, the region was inhabited mostly by the people of the local Celtic Hallstatt culture. Around 450 BC, they merged with the people of the other core Celtic areas in the south-western regions of Germany and eastern France. The country is mountainous and rich in iron and salt. It supplied material for the manufacturing of arms in Pannonia, Moesia, and northern Italy. The famous Noric steel was largely used in the making of Roman weapons (e.g. Horace, Odes, i.16.9-10: Noricus ensis, \\"a Noric sword\\"). GoldFrom a statement of Polybius, in his own time in consequence of the great output of gold from a mine in Noricum, gold went down one-third in value. and salt were found in considerable quantities. The plant called saliunca (the wild or Celtic nard, a relative of the lavender) grew in abundance and was used as a perfume according to Pliny the Elder.Naturalis Historia xxi. 20.43) The Celtic inhabitants developed a culture rich in art, cattle breeding, salt mining and agriculture. When part of the area became a Roman province, the Romans introduced water management (Aqueduct) and the already vivid trade relations between the people north and south of the alps boosted - Noric steel was famous for its quality and hardness. Archaeological research, particularly in the cemeteries of Hallstatt, has shown that a vigorous Celtic civilization was in the area centuries before recorded history, but the Celtic Hallstatt civilization was a cultural manifestation prior to the other Celtic invasions, The Hallstatt graves contained weapons and ornaments from the Bronze Age, through the period of transition, up to the \\"Hallstatt culture\\", i.e., the fully developed older period of the Iron Age. Language The Noric language is attested in only fragmentary inscriptions, one from Ptuj and two from Grafenstein, neither of which provide enough information for any conclusions about the nature of the language. Steel for Roman weaponry The kingdom of Noricum was a major provider of weaponry for the Roman armies from the mid- Republic onwards. Roman swords were made of the best-quality steel then available from this region, the chalybs Noricus. The strength of steel is determined by its composition and heat treatment. The wrought iron produced in the Greco-Roman world was too soft for tools and weapons. Ore from Noricum, by contrast, could yield a superior product. The ore needed to be rich in manganese (an element which remains essential in modern steelmaking processes), and contain little or no phosphorus, which weakens steel.Buchwald (2005) 124 The ore mined in Carinthia (S. Noricum) fulfilled both criteria particularly well.Buchwald (2005) 115 The Celts of Noricum discovered their ore made superior steel around 500 BC and built a major steel industry.Healy (1978) 236 At Magdalensberg, a major production and trading centre, specialised blacksmiths crafted metal products and weapons. The finished arms were exported to Aquileia, a Roman colony founded in 180 BC. From 200 BC the Noricum tribes gradually united into a kingdom, known as the regnum Noricum, with its capital at a place called Noreia. Noricum became a key ally of the Roman Republic, providing high-quality weapons and tools in exchange for military protection. This was demonstrated in 113 BC, when Teutones invaded Noricum. In response, the Roman consul Gnaeus Papirius Carbo led an army over the Alps to attack the Germanic tribes at the Noreia. Roman rule Noricum was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 16 BC. For a long time previously, the Noricans had enjoyed independence under princes of their own and carried on commerce with the Romans. In 48 BC they took the side of Julius Caesar in the civil war against Pompey. In 16 BC, having joined with the Pannonians in invading Histria, they were defeated by Publius Silius Nerva, proconsul of Illyricum. Thereafter, Noricum was called a province, although it was not organized as such and remained a kingdom with the title of regnum Noricum, yet under the control of an imperial procurator. Under the reign of Emperor Claudius (41‚Äì54) the Noricum Kingdom was ultimately incorporated into the Roman Empire apparently without offering resistance. It was not until the reign of Antoninus Pius that the Second Legion, Pia (later renamed Italica) was stationed in Noricum, and the commander of the legion became the governor of the province. Under Diocletian (245‚Äì313), Noricum was divided into Noricum ripense (\\"Noricum along the river\\", the northern part southward from the Danube), and Noricum mediterraneum (\\"landlocked Noricum\\", the southern, more mountainous district). The dividing line ran along the central part of the eastern Alps.\\"The province of Noricum Ripense extended along the right or southern bank of the Danube, between the river and the Noric Alps, and was bounded on one side by Raetia Secunda and the river Inn (Aenus) and on the other by the confines of Pannonia Superior ‚Äî the district included in the modern province of Carinthia in Austria. Noricum Mediterraneum lay directly to the south, beyond the Noric Alps.\\" Each division was under a praeses, and both belonged to the diocese of Illyricum in the Praetorian prefecture of Italy. It was in this time (304 A.D.) that a Christian serving as a military officer in the province suffered martyrdom for the sake of his faith, later canonised as Saint Florian. The Roman colonies and chief towns were Virunum (near Maria Saal to the north of Klagenfurt), Teurnia (near Spittal an der Drau), Flavia Solva (near Leibnitz), Celeia (Celje) in today's Slovenia, Juvavum (Salzburg), Ovilava (Wels), Lauriacum (Lorch at the mouth of the Enns, the ancient Anisus). Knowledge of Roman Noricum has been decisively expanded by the work of Richard Knabl, an Austrian epigrapher of the 19th century. The transition from Roman to barbarian rule in Noricum is well documented in Eugippius' Life of Saint Severinus, providing material for analogies for this process in other regions where primary sources from the period are lacking. In modern politics In 1919, Heinrich Lammasch, the last prime minister of Imperial Austria, proposed to give the young republic the name of Norische Republik or Noric Republic,Anna Maria Drabek, Der √ñsterreichbegriff und sein Wandel im Lauf der Geschichte, in: Marktgemeinde Neuhofen/Ybbs (ed.): Ostarrichi Gedenkst√§tte Neuhofen/Ybbs, no date (1980), pp. 32‚Äì41 because the ancient borders were similar to those of the new state, which ‚Äì at the time ‚Äì did not wish to be considered the heir of the Habsburg monarchy, but an independent, neutral and peaceful state.Dieter K√∂berl, Zum Wohle √ñsterreichs.

Unappreciated until after his death, Gauguin is now recognized for his experimental use of color and Synthetist style that were distinct from Impressionism. Toward the end of his life, he spent ten years in French Polynesia. The paintings from this time depict people or landscapes from that region. His work was influential on the French avant-garde and many modern artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. Gauguin's art became popular after his death, partially from the efforts of dealer Ambroise Vollard, who organized exhibitions of his work late in his career and assisted in organizing two important posthumous exhibitions in Paris. Gauguin was an important figure in the Symbolist movement as a painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramist, and writer. His expression of the inherent meaning of the subjects in his paintings, under the influence of the cloisonnist style, paved the way for Primitivism and the return to the pastoral. He was also an influential proponent of wood engraving and woodcuts as art forms.  Biography  = Family history and early life = Aline Marie Chazal Trist√°n, (1825‚Äì1867) \\"The Artist's Mother\\", 1889, Staatsgalerie Stuttgart Gauguin's maternal grandmother, Flora Tristan (1803‚Äì1844) in 1838 Gauguin was born in Paris to Clovis Gauguin and Aline Chazal on 7 June 1848. His birth coincided with revolutionary upheavals throughout Europe that year. His father, a 34-year-old liberal journalist, came from a family of entrepreneurs residing in Orl√©ans. He was compelled to flee France when the newspaper for which he wrote was suppressed by French authorities. Gauguin's mother was the 22-year-old daughter of Andr√© Chazal, an engraver, and Flora Tristan, an author and activist in early socialist movements. Their union ended when Andr√© assaulted his wife Flora and was sentenced to prison for attempted murder. Paul Gauguin's maternal grandmother, Flora Tristan, was the illegitimate daughter of Th√©r√®se Laisnay and Don Mariano de Tristan Moscoso. Details of Th√©r√®se's family background are not known; her father, Don Mariano, came from an aristocratic Spanish family from the Peruvian city of Arequipa. He was an officer of the Dragoons. Members of the wealthy Tristan Moscoso family held powerful positions in Peru. Nonetheless, Don Mariano's unexpected death plunged his mistress and daughter Flora into poverty. When Flora's marriage with Andr√© failed, she petitioned for and obtained a small monetary settlement from her father's Peruvian relatives. She sailed to Peru in hopes of enlarging her share of the Tristan Moscoso family fortune. This never materialized; but she successfully published a popular travelogue of her experiences in Peru which launched her literary career in 1838. An active supporter of early socialist societies, Gauguin's maternal grandmother helped to lay the foundations for the 1848 revolutionary movements. Placed under surveillance by French police and suffering from overwork, she died in 1844. Her grandson Paul \\"idolized his grandmother, and kept copies of her books with him to the end of his life\\". In 1850, Clovis Gauguin departed for Peru with his wife Aline and young children in hopes of continuing his journalistic career under the auspices of his wife's South American relations. He died of a heart attack en route, and Aline arrived in Peru a widow with the 18-month-old Paul and his 2 year-old sister, Marie. Gauguin's mother was welcomed by her paternal granduncle, whose son-in-law would shortly assume the presidency of Peru. To the age of six, Paul enjoyed a privileged upbringing, attended by nursemaids and servants. He retained a vivid memory of that period of his childhood which instilled \\"indelible impressions of Peru that haunted him the rest of his life\\". Gauguin's idyllic childhood ended abruptly when his family mentors fell from political power during Peruvian civil conflicts in 1854. Aline returned to France with her children, leaving Paul with his paternal grandfather, Guillaume Gauguin, in Orl√©ans. Deprived by the Peruvian Tristan Moscoso clan of a generous annuity arranged by her granduncle, Aline settled in Paris to work as a dressmaker. = Education and first job = After attending a couple of local schools, Gauguin was sent to the prestigious Catholic boarding school Petit S√©minaire de La Chapelle-Saint-Mesmin. He spent three years at the school. At age fourteen, he entered the Loriol Institute in Paris, a naval preparatory school, before returning to Orl√©ans to take his final year at the Lyc√©e Jeanne D'Arc. Gauguin signed on as a pilot's assistant in the merchant marine. Three years later, he joined the French navy in which he served for two years. His mother died on 7 July 1867, but he did not learn of it for several months until a letter from his sister Marie caught up with him in India. In 1871, Gauguin returned to Paris where he secured a job as a stockbroker. A close family friend, Gustave Arosa, got him a job at the Paris Bourse; Gauguin was 23. He became a successful Parisian businessman and remained one for the next 11 years. In 1879 he was earning 30,000 francs a year (about $145,000 in 2019 US dollars) as a stockbroker, and as much again in his dealings in the art market. But in 1882 the Paris stock market crashed and the art market contracted. Gauguin's earnings deteriorated sharply and he eventually decided to pursue painting full-time. = Marriage = Gauguin with his wife Mette in Copenhagen, Denmark, 1885 In 1873, he married a Danish woman, Mette-Sophie Gad (1850‚Äì1920). Over the next ten years, they had five children: √âmile (1874‚Äì1955); Aline (1877‚Äì1897); Clovis (1879‚Äì1900); Jean Ren√© (1881‚Äì1961); and Paul Rollon (1883‚Äì1961). By 1884, Gauguin had moved with his family to Copenhagen, Denmark, where he pursued a business career as a tarpaulin salesman. It was not a success: He could not speak Danish, and the Danes did not want French tarpaulins. Mette became the chief breadwinner, giving French lessons to trainee diplomats.Januszczak, Full Story. His middle- class family and marriage fell apart after 11 years when Gauguin was driven to paint full-time. He returned to Paris in 1885, after his wife and her family asked him to leave because he had renounced the values they shared. Gauguin's last physical contact with them was in 1891, Mette eventually breaking with him decisively in 1894. = First paintings = Study of a Nude (Suzanne sewing), 1880, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek In 1873, around the same time as he became a stockbroker, Gauguin began painting in his free time. His Parisian life centred on the 9th arrondissement of Paris. Gauguin lived at 15, rue la Bruy√®re.Jean-Fran√ßois Staszak Nearby were the caf√©s frequented by the Impressionists. Gauguin also visited galleries frequently and purchased work by emerging artists. He formed a friendship with Camille Pissarro and visited him on Sundays to paint in his garden. Pissarro introduced him to various other artists. In 1877 Gauguin \\"moved downmarket and across the river to the poorer, newer, urban sprawls\\" of Vaugirard. Here, on the third floor at 8 rue Carcel, he had the first home in which he had a studio. His close friend √âmile Schuffenecker, a former stockbroker who also aspired to become an artist, lived close by. Gauguin showed paintings in Impressionist exhibitions held in 1881 and 1882 (earlier, a sculpture of his son √âmile had been the only sculpture in the 4th Impressionist Exhibition of 1879). His paintings received dismissive reviews, although several of them, such as The Market Gardens of Vaugirard, are now highly regarded. In 1882, the stock market crashed and the art market contracted. Paul Durand-Ruel, the Impressionists' primary art dealer, was especially affected by the crash, and for a period of time stopped buying pictures from painters such as Gauguin. Gauguin's earnings contracted sharply and over the next two years he slowly formulated his plans to become a full-time artist.Cindy Kang, Gauguin Biography, Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000. The following two summers, he painted with Pissarro and occasionally Paul C√©zanne. In October 1883, he wrote to Pissarro saying that he had decided to make his living from painting at all costs and asked for his help, which Pissarro at first readily provided. The following January, Gauguin moved with his family to Rouen, where they could live more cheaply and where he thought he had discerned opportunities when visiting Pissarro there the previous summer. However, the venture proved unsuccessful, and by the end of the year Mette and the children moved to Copenhagen, Gauguin following shortly after in November 1884, bringing with him his art collection, which subsequently remained in Copenhagen. Life in Copenhagen proved equally difficult and their marriage grew strained. At Mette's urging, supported by her family, Gauguin returned to Paris the following year.

The other children remained with Mette in Copenhagen, where they had the support of family and friends while Mette herself was able to get work as a translator and French teacher. Gauguin initially found it difficult to re-enter the art world in Paris and spent his first winter back in real poverty, obliged to take a series of menial jobs. Clovis eventually fell ill and was sent to a boarding school, Gauguin's sister Marie providing the funds.Thompson p. 38 During this first year, Gauguin produced very little art. He exhibited nineteen paintings and a wood relief at the eighth (and last) Impressionist exhibition in May 1886. Most of these paintings were earlier work from Rouen or Copenhagen and there was nothing really novel in the few new ones, although his Baigneuses √† Dieppe (\\"Women Bathing\\") introduced what was to become a recurring motif, the woman in the waves. Nevertheless, F√©lix Bracquemond did purchase one of his paintings. This exhibition also established Georges Seurat as leader of the avant-garde movement in Paris. Gauguin contemptuously rejected Seurat's Neo-Impressionist Pointillist technique and later in the year broke decisively with Pissarro, who from that point on was rather antagonistic towards Gauguin. Gauguin spent the summer of 1886 in the artist's colony of Pont-Aven in Brittany. He was attracted in the first place because it was cheap to live there. However, he found himself an unexpected success with the young art students who flocked there in the summer. His naturally pugilistic temperament (he was both an accomplished boxer and fencer) was no impediment in the socially relaxed seaside resort. He was remembered during that period as much for his outlandish appearance as for his art. Amongst these new associates was Charles Laval, who would accompany Gauguin the following year to Panama and Martinique. That summer, he executed some pastel drawings of nude figures in the manner of Pissarro and those by Degas exhibited at the 1886 eighth Impressionist exhibition. He mainly painted landscapes such as La Berg√®re Bretonne (\\"The Breton Shepherdess\\"), in which the figure plays a subordinate role. His Jeunes Bretons au bain (\\"Young Breton Boys Bathing\\"), introducing a theme he returned to each time he visited Pont- Aven, is clearly indebted to Degas in its design and bold use of pure color. The naive drawings of the English illustrator Randolph Caldecott, used to illustrate a popular guide-book on Brittany, had caught the imagination of the avant-garde student artists at Pont-Aven, anxious to free themselves from the conservatism of their academies, and Gauguin consciously imitated them in his sketches of Breton girls.Blackburn (1880) These sketches were later worked up into paintings back in his Paris studio. The most important of these is Four Breton Women, which shows a marked departure from his earlier Impressionist style as well as incorporating something of the naive quality of Caldecott's illustration, exaggerating features to the point of caricature. Gauguin, along with √âmile Bernard, Charles Laval, √âmile Schuffenecker and many others, re- visited Pont-Aven after his travels in Panama and Martinique. The bold use of pure color and Symbolist choice of subject matter distinguish what is now called the Pont-Aven School. Disappointed with Impressionism, Gauguin felt that traditional European painting had become too imitative and lacked symbolic depth. By contrast, the art of Africa and Asia seemed to him full of mystic symbolism and vigour. There was a vogue in Europe at the time for the art of other cultures, especially that of Japan (Japonism). He was invited to participate in the 1889 exhibition organized by Les XX.

Gauguin was very appreciative of Bernard's art and of his daring with the employment of a style which suited Gauguin in his quest to express the essence of the objects in his art. In Gauguin's The Yellow Christ (1889), often cited as a quintessential Cloisonnist work, the image was reduced to areas of pure color separated by heavy black outlines. In such works Gauguin paid little attention to classical perspective and boldly eliminated subtle gradations of color, thereby dispensing with the two most characteristic principles of post-Renaissance painting. His painting later evolved towards Synthetism in which neither form nor color predominate but each has an equal role.

His thoughts and experiences during this time are recorded in his letters to his wife Mette and his artist friend Emile Schuffenecker.\\"Gauguin and Martinique,\\" Karen Kristine Reichnitzer Pope, 1981. He arrived in Martinique by way of Panama where he had found himself broke and without a job. At the time France had a policy of repatriation where if a citizen became broke or stranded on a French colony, the state would pay for the boat ride back. Upon leaving Panama, protected by the repatriation policy, Gauguin and Laval decided to get off the boat at the Martinique port of St Pierre. Scholars disagree on whether Gauguin intentionally or spontaneously decided to stay on the island. At first, the 'negro hut' in which they lived suited him, and he enjoyed watching people in their daily activities.Philip Vickers, \\"Martinique in Gauguin's Footsteps\\", Contemporary Review, 1 June 1997. However, the weather in the summer was hot and the hut leaked in the rain. Gauguin also suffered dysentery and marsh fever. While in Martinique, he produced between 10 and 20 works (12 being the most common estimate), traveled widely and apparently came into contact with a small community of Indian immigrants; a contact that would later influence his art through the incorporation of Indian symbols. During his stay, the writer Lafcadio Hearn was also on the island. His account provides an historical comparison to accompany Gauguin's images. Gauguin finished 11 known paintings during his stay in Martinique, many of which seem to be derived from his hut. His letters to Schuffenecker express an excitement about the exotic location and natives represented in his paintings. Gauguin asserted that four of his paintings on the island were better than the rest.\\"Letters to his Wife and Friends,\\" Paul Gauguin, 1946. The works as a whole are brightly colored, loosely painted, outdoor figural scenes. Even though his time on the island was short, it surely was influential. He recycled some of his figures and sketches in later paintings, like the motif in Among the Mangoes which is replicated on his fans. Rural and indigenous populations remained a popular subject in Gauguin's work after he left the island.

There they were seen and admired by Vincent van Gogh and his art dealer brother Theo, whose firm Goupil & Cie had dealings with Portier. Theo purchased three of Gauguin's paintings for 900 francs and arranged to have them hung at Goupil's, thus introducing Gauguin to wealthy clients. This arrangement with Goupil's continued past Theo's death in 1891. At the same time, Vincent and Gauguin became close friends (on Vincent's part it amounted to something akin to adulation) and they corresponded together on art, a correspondence that was instrumental in Gauguin formulating his philosophy of art.Thomson 1987, pp. 52‚Äì54, 65Mathews 2001, pp. 113‚Äì117 In 1888, at Theo's instigation, Gauguin and Vincent spent nine weeks painting together at Vincent's Yellow House in Arles in the South of France. Gauguin's relationship with Vincent proved fraught. Their relationship deteriorated and eventually Gauguin decided to leave. On the evening of 23 December 1888, according to a much later account of Gauguin's, Vincent confronted Gauguin with a straight razor. Later the same evening, he cut off his own left ear. He wrapped the severed tissue in newspaper and handed it to a woman who worked at a brothel Gauguin and Vincent had both visited, and asked her to \\"keep this object carefully, in remembrance of me\\". Vincent was hospitalized the following day and Gauguin left Arles. They never saw each other again, but they continued to correspond, and in 1890 Gauguin went so far as to propose they form an artist studio in Antwerp.Pickvance, Ronald. Van Gogh in Saint- R√©my and Auvers (exh. cat. Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), Abrams, New York 1986. p. 62 An 1889 sculptural self-portrait Jug in the Form of a Head appears to reference Gauguin's traumatic relationship with Vincent. Gauguin later claimed to have been instrumental in influencing Vincent van Gogh's development as a painter at Arles. While Vincent did briefly experiment with Gauguin's theory of \\"painting from the imagination\\" in paintings such as Memory of the Garden at Etten, it did not suit him and he quickly returned to painting from nature. = Edgar Degas = Although Gauguin made some of his early strides in the world of art under Pissarro, Edgar Degas was Gauguin's most admired contemporary artist and a great influence on his work from the beginning, with his figures and interiors as well as a carved and painted medallion of singer Val√©rie Roumi. He had a deep reverence for Degas' artistic dignity and tact. It was Gauguin's healthiest, longest lasting friendship, spanning his entire artistic career until his death. In addition to being one of his earliest supporters, including buying Gauguin's work and persuading dealer Paul Durand-Ruel to do the same, there was never a public support for Gauguin more unwavering than from Degas. Gauguin also purchased work from Degas in the early to mid-1870s and his own monotyping predilection was probably influenced by Degas' advancements in the medium.Figura, Childs, Foster & Mosier (2014), 26 Paul Gauguin, Arearea no Varua Ino,1894, watercolor monotype on Japan paper, owned originally by Degas, National Gallery of Art Gauguin's Durand-Ruel exhibition in November 1893, which Degas chiefly organized, received mixed reviews. Among the mocking were Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and former friend Pissarro. Degas, however, praised his work, purchasing ' and admiring the exotic sumptuousness of Gauguin's conjured folklore.Stuckey p. 231Ann Dumas (ed.) At n. 252 the text says Degas said he purchased it later at Vollard's gallery. In appreciation, Gauguin presented Degas with The Moon and the Earth, one of the exhibited paintings that had attracted the most hostile criticism. Gauguin's late canvas Riders on the Beach (two versions) recalls Degas' horse pictures which he started in the 1860s, specifically Racetrack and Before the Race, testifying to his enduring effect on Gauguin. Degas later purchased two paintings at Gauguin's 1895 auction to raise funds for his final trip to Tahiti. These were Vahine no te vi (Woman with a Mango) and the version Gauguin painted of Manet's Olympia.Ann Dumas (ed.) Stuckey p. 260 = First visit to Tahiti = By 1890, Gauguin had conceived the project of making Tahiti his next artistic destination. A successful auction of paintings in Paris at the H√¥tel Drouot in February 1891, along with other events such as a banquet and a benefit concert, provided the necessary funds. The auction had been greatly helped by a flattering review from Octave Mirbeau, courted by Gauguin through Camille Pissarro. After visiting his wife and children in Copenhagen, for what turned out to be the last time, Gauguin set sail for Tahiti on 1 April 1891, promising to return a rich man and make a fresh start. His avowed intent was to escape European civilization and \\"everything that is artificial and conventional\\".Mathhews pp.157‚Äì167\\"The painter who invented his own brand of artistic license,\\" Arifa Akbar, The Independent, 20 April 2010. Nevertheless, he took care to take with him a collection of visual stimuli in the form of photographs, drawings and prints. He spent the first three months in Papeete, the capital of the colony and already much influenced by French and European culture. His biographer Belinda Thomson observes that he must have been disappointed in his vision of a primitive idyll. He was unable to afford the pleasure-seeking life-style in Papeete, and an early attempt at a portrait, Suzanne Bambridge, was not well liked. He decided to set up his studio in Mataiea, Papeari, some from Papeete, installing himself in a native-style bamboo hut. Here he executed paintings depicting Tahitian life such as Fatata te Miti (By the Sea) and Ia Orana Maria (Ave Maria), the latter to become his most prized Tahitian painting. Vahine no te tiare (Woman with a Flower), 1891, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek Many of his finest paintings date from this period. His first portrait of a Tahitian model is thought to be Vahine no te tiare (Woman with a Flower). The painting is notable for the care with which it delineates Polynesian features. He sent the painting to his patron George-Daniel de Monfreid, a friend of Schuffenecker, who was to become Gauguin's devoted champion in Tahiti. By late summer 1892 this painting was being displayed at Goupil's gallery in Paris. Art historian Nancy Mowll Mathews believes that Gauguin's encounter with exotic sensuality in Tahiti, so evident in the painting, was by far the most important aspect of his sojourn there. Gauguin was lent copies of 1837 Voyage aux √Æles du Grand Oc√©an and 1855 √âtat de la soci√©t√© tahitienne √† l'arriv√©e des Europ√©ens, containing full accounts of Tahiti's forgotten culture and religion. He was fascinated by the accounts of Arioi society and their god 'Oro. Because these accounts contained no illustrations and the Tahitian models were in any case long disappeared, he could give free rein to his imagination. He executed some twenty paintings and a dozen woodcarvings over the next year. The first of these was Te aa no areois (The Seed of the Areoi), representing Oro's terrestrial wife Vairaumati, now held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His illustrated notebook of the time, , is preserved in the Louvre and was published in facsimile form in 1951. In all, Gauguin sent nine of his paintings to Monfreid in Paris. These were eventually exhibited in Copenhagen in a joint exhibition with the late Vincent van Gogh. Reports that they had been well received (though in fact only two of the Tahitian paintings were sold and his earlier paintings were unfavourably compared with van Gogh's) were sufficiently encouraging for Gauguin to contemplate returning with some seventy others he had completed. He had in any case largely run out of funds, depending on a state grant for a free passage home. In addition he had some health problems diagnosed as heart problems by the local doctor, which Mathews suggests may have been the early signs of cardiovascular syphilis. Gauguin later wrote a travelogue (first published 1901) titled ', originally conceived as commentary on his paintings and describing his experiences in Tahiti. Modern critics have suggested that the contents of the book were in part fantasized and plagiarized.Solomon-Godeau pp. 326, 328 In it he revealed that he had at this time taken a thirteen-year-old girl as native wife or vahine (the Tahitian word for \\"woman\\"), a marriage contracted in the course of a single afternoon. This was Teha'amana, called Tehura in the travelogue, who was pregnant by him by the end of summer 1892.Gauguin (1903) Noa Noa pp. 63‚Äì69 Teha'amana was the subject of several of Gauguin's paintings, including Merahi metua no Tehamana and the celebrated Spirit of the Dead Watching, as well as a notable woodcarving Tehura now in the Mus√©e d'Orsay. By the end of July 1893, Gauguin had decided to leave Tahiti and he would never see Teha'amana or her child again even after returning to the island several years later.

An exhibition at the Durand-Ruel gallery in November 1894 was a moderate success, selling at quite elevated prices eleven of the forty paintings exhibited. He set up an apartment at 6 rue Vercing√©torix on the edge of the Montparnasse district frequented by artists, and began to conduct a weekly salon. He affected an exotic persona, dressing in Polynesian costume, and conducted a public affair with a young woman still in her teens, \\"half Indian, half Malayan\\", known as . Despite the moderate success of his November exhibition, he subsequently lost Durand-Ruel's patronage in circumstances that are not clear. Mathews characterises this as a tragedy for Gauguin's career. Amongst other things he lost the chance of an introduction to the American market.Mathhews p.200 The start of 1894 found him preparing woodcuts using an experimental technique for his proposed travelogue Noa Noa. He returned to Pont-Aven for the summer. In February 1895 he attempted an auction of his paintings at H√¥tel Drouot in Paris, similar to the one of 1891, but this was not a success. The dealer Ambroise Vollard, however, showed his paintings at his gallery in March 1895, but they unfortunately did not come to terms at that date. He submitted a large ceramic sculpture he called Oviri he had fired the previous winter to the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 salon opening in April. There are conflicting versions of how it was received: his biographer and Noa Noa collaborator, the Symbolist poet , contended (1920) that the work was \\"literally expelled\\" from the exhibition, while Vollard said (1937) that the work was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw all his own work.Fr√®ches-Thory p. 372 n. 19 In any case, Gauguin took the opportunity to increase his public exposure by writing an outraged letter on the state of modern ceramics to Le Soir. By this time it had become clear that he and his wife Mette were irrevocably separated. Although there had been hopes of a reconciliation, they had quickly quarrelled over money matters and neither visited the other. Gauguin initially refused to share any part of a 13,000-franc inheritance from his uncle Isidore which he had come into shortly after returning. Mette was eventually gifted 1,500 francs, but she was outraged and from that point on kept in contact with him only through Schuffeneckerdoubly galling for Gauguin, as his friend thus knew the true extent of his betrayal. By mid 1895 attempts to raise funds for Gauguin's return to Tahiti had failed, and he began accepting charity from friends. In June 1895 Eug√®ne Carri√®re arranged a cheap passage back to Tahiti, and Gauguin never saw Europe again.Wright p.194-8 File:Gauguin, Paul - Sacred Spring, Sweet Dreams (Nave nave moe).jpgNave nave moe (Sacred spring, sweet dreams), 1894, Hermitage Museum File:Paul Gauguin 004.jpgAnnah the Javanese, (1893), Private collection File:Annah la Javanaise by Mucha.jpgPaul Gauguin, Alfons Mucha, Ludƒõk Marold, and Annah the Javanese at Mucha's studio, 1893 File:Paul Gauguin - Nave Nave Fenua from the Noa Noa Series - Google Art Project.jpgNave Nave Fenua (Delightful Land), woodcut in Noa Noa series, 1894, Art Gallery of Ontario = Residence in Tahiti = Jules Agostini's 1896 photograph of Gauguin's house in Puna'auia. Note the sculpture of a nude woman. Gauguin set out for Tahiti again on 28 June 1895. His return is characterised by Thomson as an essentially negative one, his disillusionment with the Paris art scene compounded by two attacks on him in the same issue of Mercure de France; one by Emile Bernard, the other by Camille Mauclair. Mathews remarks that his isolation in Paris had become so bitter that he had no choice but to try to reclaim his place in Tahiti society. He arrived in September 1895 and was to spend the next six years living, for the most part, an apparently comfortable life as an artist-colon near, or at times in, Papeete. During this time he was able to support himself with an increasingly steady stream of sales and the support of friends and well-wishers, though there was a period of time 1898‚Äì1899 when he felt compelled to take a desk job in Papeete, of which there is not much record. He built a spacious reed and thatch house at Puna'auia in an affluent area ten miles east of Papeete, settled by wealthy families, in which he installed a large studio, sparing no expense. Jules Agostini, an acquaintance of Gauguin's and an accomplished amateur photographer, photographed the house in 1896. Later a sale of land obliged him to build a new one in the same neighbourhood. He maintained a horse and trap, so was in a position to travel daily to Papeete to participate in the social life of the colony should he wish. He subscribed to the Mercure de France (indeed was a shareholder), by then France's foremost critical journal, and kept up an active correspondence with fellow artists, dealers, critics, and patrons in Paris. During his year in Papeete and thereafter, he played an increasing role in local politics, contributing abrasively to a local journal opposed to the colonial government, Les Gu√™pes (The Wasps), that had recently been formed, and eventually edited his own monthly publication Le Sourire: Journal s√©rieux (The Smile: A Serious Newspaper), later titled simply Journal m√©chant (A Wicked Newspaper). A certain amount of artwork and woodcuts from his newspaper survive. In February 1900 he became the editor of Les Gu√™pes itself, for which he drew a salary, and he continued as editor until he left Tahiti in September 1901. The paper under his editorship was noted for its scurrilous attacks on the governor and officialdom in general, but was not in fact a champion of native causes, although perceived as such nevertheless. For the first year at least he produced no paintings, informing Monfreid that he proposed henceforth to concentrate on sculpture. Few of his wooden carvings from this period survive, most of them collected by Monfreid. Thomson cites Oyez Hui Iesu (Christ on the Cross), a wooden cylinder half a metre (20\\") tall featuring a curious hybrid of religious motifs. The cylinder may have been inspired by similar symbolic carvings in Brittany, such as at Pleumeur-Bodou, where ancient menhirs have been Christianised by local craftsmen. When he resumed painting, it was to continue his long-standing series of sexually charged nudes in paintings such as Te tamari no atua (Son of God) and O Taiti (Nevermore). Thomson observes a progression in complexity. Mathews notes a return to Christian symbolism that would have endeared him to the colonists of the time, now anxious to preserve what was left of native culture by stressing the universality of religious principles. In these paintings, Gauguin was addressing an audience amongst his fellow colonists in Papeete, not his former avant-garde audience in Paris. His health took a decided turn for the worse and he was hospitalised several times for a variety of ailments. While he was in France, he had his ankle shattered in a drunken brawl on a seaside visit to Concarneau. The injury, an open fracture, never healed properly. Now painful and debilitating sores that restricted his movement were erupting up and down his legs. These were treated with arsenic. Gauguin blamed the tropical climate and described the sores as \\"eczema\\", but his biographers agree this must have been the progress of syphilis. Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?, 1897, oil on canvas, 139 √ó 375 cm (55 √ó 148 in), Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA In April 1897 he received word that his favorite daughter Aline had died from pneumonia. This was also the month he learned he had to vacate his house because its land had been sold. He took out a bank loan to build a much more extravagant wooden house with beautiful views of the mountains and sea. But he overextended himself in so doing, and by the end of the year faced the real prospect of his bank foreclosing on him. Failing health and pressing debts brought him to the brink of despair. At the end of the year he completed his monumental Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?, which he regarded as his masterpiece and final artistic testament (in a letter to Monfreid he explained that he tried to kill himself after finishing it). The painting was exhibited at Vollard's gallery in November the following year, along with eight thematically related paintings he had completed by July. This was his first major exhibition in Paris since his Durand-Ruel show in 1893 and it was a decided success, critics praising his new serenity. Where do we come from?, however, received mixed reviews and Vollard had difficulty selling it. He eventually sold it in 1901 for 2,500 francs (about $10,000 in year 2000 US dollars) to , of which Vollard's commission was perhaps as much as 500 francs. Tahitian Woman with Evil Spirit, traced monotype, 1899/1900, St√§del Georges Chaudet, Gauguin's Paris dealer, died in the fall of 1899. Vollard had been buying Gauguin's paintings through Chaudet and now made an agreement with Gauguin directly.Mathews, Nancy Mowll. (2001) Paul Gauguin, an Erotic Life. New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press, pp. 225‚Äì9. The agreement provided Gauguin a regular monthly advance of 300 francs against a guaranteed purchase of at least 25 unseen paintings a year at 200 francs each, and in addition Vollard undertook to provide him with his art materials. There were some initial problems on both sides, but Gauguin was finally able to realise his long cherished plan of resettling in the Marquesas Islands in search of a yet more primitive society. He spent his final months in Tahiti living in considerable comfort, as attested by the liberality with which he entertained his friends at that time. Gauguin was unable to continue his work in ceramics in the islands for the simple reason that suitable clay was not available. Similarly, without access to a printing press (Le Sourire was hectographed), he was obliged to turn to the monotype process in his graphic work. Surviving examples of these prints are rather rare and command very high prices in the saleroom. Gauguin's female partner during all this time was Pahura (Pau'ura) a Tai, the daughter of neighbours in Puna'auia. Pau'ura was fourteen and a half when he took her in. She gave him two children, of which a daughter died in infancy. The other, a boy, she raised herself. His descendants still inhabited Tahiti at the time of Mathews' biography. Pahura refused to accompany Gauguin to the Marquesas away from her family in Puna'auia (earlier she had left him when he took work in Papeete just 10 miles away). When the English writer Willam Somerset Maugham visited her in 1917, she could offer him no useful memory of Gauguin and chided him for visiting her without bringing money from Gauguin's family.

Paul Getty Museum = Marquesas Islands = Door lintel at Maison du Jouir, 1901, Mus√©e d'Orsay Reconstruction of Gauguin's home Maison du Jouir (House of Pleasure) at Atuona, Paul Gauguin Cultural Center Gauguin had nurtured his plan of settling in the Marquesas ever since seeing a collection of intricately carved Marquesan bowls and weapons in Papeete during his first months in Tahiti. However, he found a society that, as in Tahiti, had lost its cultural identity. Of all the Pacific island groups, the Marquesas were the most affected by the import of Western diseases (especially tuberculosis). An eighteenth century population of some 80,000 had declined to just 4,000. Catholic missionaries held sway and, in their effort to control drunkenness and promiscuity, obliged all native children to attend missionary schools into their teens. French colonial rule was enforced by a gendarmerie noted for its malevolence and stupidity, while traders, both western and Chinese, exploited the natives appallingly. Gauguin settled in Atuona on the island of Hiva-Oa, arriving 16 September 1901. This was the administrative capital of the island group, but considerably less developed than Papeete although there was an efficient and regular steamer service between the two. There was a military doctor but no hospital. The doctor was relocated to Papeete the following February and thereafter Gauguin had to rely on the island's two health care workers, the Vietnamese exile Nguyen Van Cam (Ky Dong), who had settled on the island but had no formal medical training, and the Protestant pastor Paul Vernier, who had studied medicine in addition to theology. Both of these were to become close friends. He bought a plot of land in the center of the town from the Catholic mission, having first ingratiated himself with the local bishop by attending mass regularly. This bishop was Monseigneur Joseph Martin, initially well disposed to Gauguin because he was aware that Gauguin had sided with the Catholic party in Tahiti in his journalism. P√®re Paillard (Father Lechery), 1902, National Gallery of Art. Gauguin's lampoon of Bishop Martin. Gauguin built a two-floor house on his plot, sturdy enough to survive a later cyclone which washed away most other dwellings in the town. He was helped in the task by the two best Marquesan carpenters on the island, one of them called Tioka, tattooed from head to toe in the traditional Marquesan way (a tradition suppressed by the missionaries). Tioka was a deacon in Vernier's congregation and became Gauguin's neighbour after the cyclone when Gauguin gifted him a corner of his plot. The ground floor was open-air and used for dining and living, while the top floor was used for sleeping and as his studio. The door to the top floor was decorated with a polychrome wood-carved lintel and jambs that still survive in museums. The lintel named the house as Maison du Jouir (i.e. House of Pleasure), while the jambs echoed his earlier 1889 wood-carving Soyez amoureuses vous serez heureuses (i.e. Be in Love, You Will Be Happy). The walls were decorated with, amongst other things, his prized collection of forty-five pornographic photographs he had purchased in Port Said on his way out from France. In the early days at least, until Gauguin found a vahine, the house drew appreciative crowds in the evenings from the natives, who came to stare at the pictures and party half the night away. Needless to say, all this did not endear Gauguin to the bishop, still less when Gauguin erected two sculptures he placed at the foot of his steps lampooning the bishop and a servant reputed to be the bishop's mistress, and yet still less when Gauguin later attacked the unpopular missionary school system.Eisenman p. 170 The sculpture of the bishop, P√®re Paillard, is to be found at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, while its pendant piece Th√©r√®se realized a record $30,965,000 for a Gauguin sculpture at a Christie's New York 2015 sale.Modigliani‚Äôs Nu couch√© (Reclining Nude) leads a night of records in New York, Christie's New York, 10 November 2015Paul Gauguin, Th√©r√®se, Christie's New York, 9 November 2015 These were among at least eight sculptures that adorned the house according to a posthumous inventory, most of which are lost today. Together they represented a very public attack on the hypocrisy of the church in sexual matters. State funding for the missionary schools had ceased as a result of the 1901 Associations Bill promulgated throughout the French empire.web Catholic encyclopaedia The schools continued with difficulty as private institutions, but these difficulties were compounded when Gauguin established that attendance at any given school was only compulsory within a catchment area of some two and a half miles radius. This led to numerous teenage daughters being withdrawn from the schools (Gauguin called this process \\"rescuing\\"). He took as vahine one such girl, Vaeoho (also called Marie-Rose), the fourteen-year-old daughter of a native couple who lived in an adjoining valley six miles distant. This can scarcely have been a pleasant task for her as Gauguin's sores were by then extremely noxious and required daily dressing. Nevertheless, she lived willingly with him and the following year gave birth to a healthy daughter whose descendants continue to live on the island. Le Sorcier d'Hiva Oa (Marquesan Man in a Red Cape), 1902, Mus√©e d'art moderne et d'art contemporain de Li√®ge By November he had settled into his new home with Vaeoho, a cook (Kahui), two other servants (nephews of Tioka), his dog, Pegau (a play on his initials PG), and a cat. The house itself, although in the center of the town, was set amongst trees and secluded from view. The partying ceased and he began a period of productive work, sending twenty canvases to Vollard the following April. He had thought he would find new motifs in the Marquesas, writing to Monfreid:Szech p. 148 In fact his Marquesas work for the most part can only be distinguished from his Tahiti work by experts or by their dates, paintings such as Two Women remaining uncertain in their location. For Anna Szech, what distinguishes them is their repose and melancholy, albeit containing elements of disquiet. Thus, in the second of two versions of Cavaliers sur la Plage (Riders on the Beach), gathering clouds and foamy breakers suggest an impending storm while the two distant figures on grey horses echo similar figures in other paintings that are taken to symbolise death. Gauguin chose to paint landscapes, still lifes, and figure studies at this time, with an eye to Vollard's clientele, avoiding the primitive and lost paradise themes of his Tahiti paintings.Childs p. 312 But there is a significant trio of pictures from this last period that suggest deeper concerns. The first two of these are Jeune fille √† l'√©ventail (Young Girl with Fan) and Le Sorcier d'Hiva Oa (Marquesan Man in a Red Cape). The model for Jeune fille was the red-headed Tohotaua, the daughter of a chieftain on a neighbouring island. The portrait appears to have been taken from a photograph that Vernier later sent to Vollard. The model for Le sorcier may have been Haapuani, an accomplished dancer as well as a feared magician, who was a close friend of Gauguin's and, according to Danielsson, married to Tohotau. Szech notes that the white color of Tohotau's dress is a symbol of power and death in Polynesian culture, the sitter doing duty for a Maohi culture as a whole threatened with extinction. Le Sorcier appears to have been executed at the same time and depicts a long-haired young man wearing an exotic red cape. The androgynous nature of the image has attracted critical attention, giving rise to speculation that Gauguin intended to depict a mƒÅh≈´ (i.e. a third gender person) rather than a taua or priest.Eisenman pp. 140‚Äì19 The third picture of the trio is the mysterious and beautiful Contes barbares (Primitive Tales) featuring Tohotau again at the right. The left figure is Jacob Meyer de Haan, a painter friend of Gauguin's from their Pont-Aven days who had died a few years previously, while the middle figure is again androgynous, identified by some as Haapuani. The Buddha-like pose and the lotus blossoms suggests to Elizabeth Childs that the picture is a meditation on the perpetual cycle of life and the possibility of rebirth. As these paintings reached Vollard after Gauguin's sudden death, nothing is known about Gauguin's intentions in their execution. Self portrait, 1903, Kunstmuseum Basel In March 1902, the governor of French Polynesia, , arrived in the Marquesas to make an inspection. He was accompanied by √âdouard Charlier as head of the judicial system. Charlier was an amateur painter who had been befriended by Gauguin when he first arrived as magistrate at Papeete in 1895. However their relationship had turned to enmity when Charlier refused to prosecute Gauguin's then vahine Pau'ura for a number of trivial offences, allegedly housebreaking and theft, she had committed at Puna'auia while Gauguin was away working in Papeete. Gauguin had gone so far as to publish an open letter attacking Charlier about the affair in Les Gu√™pes. Petit, presumably suitably forewarned, refused to see Gauguin to deliver the settlers' protests (Gauguin their spokesman) about the invidious taxation system, which saw most revenue from the Marquesas spent in Papeete. Gauguin responded in April by refusing to pay his taxes and encouraging the settlers, traders and planters, to do likewise. At around the same time, Gauguin's health began to deteriorate again, revisited by the same familiar constellation of symptoms involving pain in the legs, heart palpitations, and general debility. The pain in his injured ankle grew insupportable and in July he was obliged to order a trap from Papeete so that he could get about town. By September the pain was so extreme that he resorted to morphine injections. However he was sufficiently concerned by the habit he was developing to turn his syringe set over to a neighbour, relying instead on laudanum. His sight was also beginning to fail him, as attested by the spectacles he wears in his last known self-portrait. This was actually a portrait commenced by his friend Ky Dong that he completed himself, thus accounting for its uncharacteristic style. It shows a man tired and aged, yet not entirely defeated. For a while he considered returning to Europe, to Spain, to get treatment. Monfreid advised him: In July 1902, Vaeoho, by then seven months pregnant, left Gauguin to return home to her neighbouring valley of Hekeani to have her baby amongst family and friends. She gave birth in September, but did not return. Gauguin did not subsequently take another vahine. It was at this time that his quarrel with Bishop Martin over missionary schools reached its height. The local gendarme D√©sir√© Charpillet, at first friendly to Gauguin, wrote a report to the administrator of the island group, who resided on the neighbouring island of Nuku Hiva, criticising Gauguin for encouraging natives to withdraw their children from school as well as encouraging settlers to withhold payment of their taxes. As luck would have it, the post of administrator had recently been filled by Fran√ßois Picquenot, an old friend of Gauguin's from Tahiti and essentially sympathetic to him. Picquenot advised Charpillet not to take any action over the schools issue, since Gauguin had the law on his side, but authorised Charpillet to seize goods from Gauguin in lieu of payment of taxes if all else failed. Possibly prompted by loneliness, and at times unable to paint, Gauguin took to writing. L'Esprit Moderne et le Catholicisme (front and back covers, 1902, Saint Louis Art Museum In 1901, the manuscript of Noa Noa that Gauguin had prepared along with woodcuts during his interlude in France was finally published with Morice's poems in book form in the La Plume edition (the manuscript itself is now lodged in the Louvre museum). Sections of it (including his account of Teha'amana) had previously been published without woodcuts in 1897 in La Revue Blanche, while he himself had published extracts in Les Gu√™pes while he was editor. The La Plume edition was planned to include his woodcuts, but he withheld permission to print them on smooth paper as the publishers wished. In truth he had grown disinterested in the venture with Morice and never saw a copy, declining an offer of one hundred complimentary copies.Goddard p. 279 Nevertheless, its publication inspired him to consider writing other books. At the beginning of the year (1902), he had revised an old 1896‚Äì97 manuscript L'Esprit Moderne et le Catholicisme (The Modern Spirit and Catholicism) on the Roman Catholic church, adding some twenty pages containing insights gleaned from his dealings with Bishop Martin. He sent this text to Bishop Martin, who responded by sending him an illustrated history of the church. Gauguin returned the book with critical remarks he later published in his autobiographical reminisces.Gauguin (1921) He next prepared a witty and well-documented essay Racontars de Rapin (Tales of a Dabbler) on critics and art criticism, which he sent for publication to Andr√© Fontainas, art critic at the Mercure de France whose favourable review of Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? had done much to restore his reputation. Fontainas, however, replied that he dared not publish it. It was not subsequently published until 1951.Gauguin Letter LXI to Monfreid On 27 May that year, the steamer service Croix du Sud was shipwrecked off the Apataki atoll and for a period of three months the island was left without mail or supplies. When mail service resumed, Gauguin penned an angry attack on Governor Petit in an open letter, complaining amongst other things about the way they had been abandoned following the shipwreck. The letter was published by L'Indep√©ndant, the successor newspaper to Les Gu√™pes, that November in Papeete. Petit had in fact followed an independent and pro-native policy, to the disappointment of the Roman Catholic Party, and the newspaper was preparing an attack on him. Gauguin also sent the letter to Mercure de France, which published a redacted version of it after his death. He followed this with a private letter to the head of the gendarmerie in Papeete, complaining about his own local gendarme Charpillet's excesses in making prisoners labour for him. Danielsson notes that, while these and similar complaints were well- founded, the motivation for them all was wounded vanity and simple animosity. As it happened, the relatively supportive Charpillet was replaced that December by another gendarme Jean-Paul Claverie from Tahiti, much less well disposed to Gauguin and who in fact had fined him in his earliest Mataiea days for public indecency, having caught him bathing naked in a local stream following complaints from the missionaries there. His health further deteriorated in December to the extent that he was scarcely able to paint. He began an autobiographical memoir he called Avant et apr√®s (Before and After) (published in translation in the US as Intimate Journals), which he completed over the next two months. The title was supposed to reflect his experiences before and after coming to Tahiti and as tribute to his own grandmother's unpublished memoir Past and Future. His memoir proved to be a fragmented collection of observations about life in Polynesia, his own life, and comments on literature and paintings. He included in it attacks on subjects as diverse as the local gendarmerie, Bishop Martin, his wife Mette and the Danes in general, and concluded with a description of his personal philosophy conceiving life as an existential struggle to reconcile opposing binaries. Mathews notes two closing remarks as a distillation of his philosophy: He sent the manuscript to Fontainas for editing, but the rights reverted to Mette after Gauguin's death and it was not published until 1918 (in a facsimile edition), the American translation appearing in 1921. = Death = Atuona At the beginning of 1903, Gauguin engaged in a campaign designed to expose the incompetence of the island's gendarmes, in particular Jean-Paul Claverie, for taking the side of the natives directly in a case involving the alleged drunkenness of a group of them.Paul Gauguin, Claverie, however, escaped censure. At the beginning of February, Gauguin wrote to the administrator, Fran√ßois Picquenot, alleging corruption by one of Claverie's subordinates. Picquenot investigated the allegations but could not substantiate them. Claverie responded by filing a charge of libeling a gendarme against Gauguin, who was subsequently fined 500 francs and sentenced to three months' imprisonment by the local magistrate on 27 March 1903. Gauguin immediately filed an appeal in Papeete and set about raising the funds to travel to Papeete to hear his appeal. At this time Gauguin was very weak and in great pain, and resorted once again to using morphine. He died suddenly on the morning of 8 May 1903.

They had chatted together and Vernier had left, believing him in a stable condition. However Gauguin's neighbour Tioka found him dead at 11 o'clock, confirming the fact in the traditional Marquesan way by chewing his head in an attempt to revive him. By his bedside was an empty bottle of laudanum, which has given rise to speculation that he was the victim of an overdose. Vernier believed he died of a heart attack. Gauguin's grave, Atuona Gauguin was buried in the Catholic Calvary Cemetery (Cimeti√®re Calvaire), Atuona, Hiva 'Oa, at 2 p.m. the next day. In 1973, a bronze cast of his Oviri figure was placed on his grave, as he had indicated was his wish. Ironically his nearest neighbour in the cemetery is Bishop Martin, his grave surmounted by a large white cross. Vernier wrote an account of Gauguin's last days and burial, reproduced in O'Brien's edition of Gauguin's letters to Monfreid. Word of Gauguin's death did not reach France (to Monfreid) until 23 August 1903. In the absence of a will, his less valuable effects were auctioned in Atuona while his letters, manuscripts and paintings were auctioned in Papeete on 5 September 1903. Mathews notes that this speedy dispersal of his effects led to the loss of much valuable information about his later years. Thomson notes that the auction inventory of his effects (some of which were burned as pornography) revealed a life that was not as impoverished or primitive as he had liked to maintain. Mette Gauguin in due course received the proceeds of the auction, some 4,000 francs. One of the paintings auctioned in Papeete was Maternit√© II, a smaller version of Maternit√© I in the Hermitage Museum. The original was painted at the time his then vahine Pau'ura in Puna'auia gave birth to their son Emile. It is not known why he painted the smaller copy. It was sold for 150 francs to a French naval officer, Commandant Cochin, who said that Governor Petit himself had bid up to 135 francs for the painting. It was sold at Sotheby's for US$39,208,000 in 2004. Maternit√© II, 1899, private collection, sold at auction in Papeete, 1903 The Paul Gauguin Cultural Center at Atuona has a reconstruction of the Maison du Jouir. The original house stood empty for a few years, the door still carrying Gauguin's carved lintel. This was eventually recovered, four of the five pieces held at the Mus√©e D'Orsay and the fifth at the Paul Gauguin Museum in Tahiti. In 2014, forensic examination of four teeth found in a glass jar in a well near Gauguin's house threw into question the conventional belief that Gauguin had suffered from syphilis. DNA examination established that the teeth were almost certainly Gauguin's, but no traces were found of the mercury that was used to treat syphilis at the time, suggesting either that Gauguin did not suffer from syphilis or that he was not being treated for it. In 2007 four rotten molars, which may have been Gauguin's, were found by archaeologists at the bottom of a well that he built on the island of Hiva Oa, on the Marquese Islands.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/gauguins-teeth-found- down-well-761713.html = Children = Gauguin outlived three of his children; his favorite daughter Aline died of pneumonia, his son Clovis died of a blood infection following a hip operation,Harrison Swain \\"Emile Gauguin Honor Guest at Artists' Ball\\" in The Evening Independent 26 January 1965, pp. 15 and a daughter, whose birth was portrayed in Gauguin's painting of 1896 Te tamari no atua, the child of Gauguin's young Tahitian mistress Pau'ura, died only a few days after her birth on Christmas Day 1896. His son √âmile Gauguin worked as a construction engineer in the U.S. and is buried in Lemon Bay Historical Cemetery, in Florida. Another son, Jean Ren√©, became a well-known sculptor and a staunch socialist. He died on 21 April 1961 in Copenhagen. Pola (Paul Rollon) became an artist and art critic and wrote a memoir, My Father, Paul Gauguin (1937). Gauguin had several other children by his mistresses: Germaine (born 1891) with Juliette Huais (1866‚Äì1955); √âmile Marae a Tai (born 1899) with Pau'ura; and a daughter (born 1902) with Mari-Rose. There is some speculation that the Belgian artist Germaine Chardon was Gauguin's daughter. Emile Marae a Tai, illiterate and raised in Tahiti by Pau'ura, was brought to Chicago in 1963 by the French journalist Josette Giraud and was an artist in his own right, his descendants still living in Tahiti as of 2001.  Historical significance  Primitivism was an art movement of late 19th- century painting and sculpture, characterized by exaggerated body proportions, animal totems, geometric designs and stark contrasts. The first artist to systematically use these effects and achieve broad public success was Paul Gauguin.Artspoke, Robert Atkins, 1993, The European cultural elite discovering the art of Africa, Micronesia, and Native Americans for the first time were fascinated, intrigued and educated by the newness, wildness and the stark power embodied in the art of those faraway places. Like Pablo Picasso in the early days of the 20th century, Gauguin was inspired and motivated by the raw power and simplicity of the so-called Primitive art of those foreign cultures.Douglas Cooper, \\"The Cubist Epoch\\", pp. 11‚Äì221, Phaidon Press Limited 1970 in association with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art Gauguin is also considered a Post-Impressionist painter. His bold, colorful and design oriented paintings significantly influenced Modern art. Artists and movements in the early 20th century inspired by him include Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Andr√© Derain, Fauvism, Cubism and Orphism, among others. Later he influenced Arthur Frank Mathews and the American Arts and Crafts movement. John Rewald, recognized as a foremost authority on late 19th-century art, wrote a series of books about the Post-Impressionist period, including Post- Impressionism: From Van Gogh to Gauguin (1956) and an essay, Paul Gauguin: Letters to Ambroise Vollard and Andr√© Fontainas (included in Rewald's Studies in Post-Impressionism, 1986), discusses Gauguin's years in Tahiti, and the struggles of his survival as seen through correspondence with the art dealer Vollard and others.John Rewald, (1986). Studies in Post-Impressionism, Paul Gauguin‚ÄìLetters to Ambroise Vollard and Andre Fontainas, 168‚Äì215.  Influence on Picasso  Paul Gauguin, 1893‚Äì1895, Objet d√©coratif carr√© avec dieux tahitiens, terre cuite, rehauts peints, 34 cm, Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris Gauguin's posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1903 and an even larger one in 1906 had a stunning and powerful influence on the French avant-garde and in particular Pablo Picasso's paintings. In the autumn of 1906, Picasso made paintings of oversized nude women, and monumental sculptural figures that recalled the work of Paul Gauguin and showed his interest in primitive art. Picasso's paintings of massive figures from 1906 were directly influenced by Gauguin's sculpture, painting and his writing as well. The power evoked by Gauguin's work led directly to Les Demoiselles d'Avignon in 1907. According to Gauguin biographer David Sweetman, Picasso as early as 1902 became a fan of Gauguin's work when he met and befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio, in Paris. Durrio had several of Gauguin's works on hand because he was a friend of Gauguin's and an unpaid agent of his work. Durrio tried to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his oeuvre in Paris. After they met, Durrio introduced Picasso to Gauguin's stoneware, helped Picasso make some ceramic pieces and gave Picasso a first La Plume edition of Noa Noa: The Tahiti Journal of Paul Gauguin.Sweetman, 563 In addition to seeing Gauguin's work at Durrio's, Picasso also saw the work at Ambroise Vollard's gallery where both he and Gauguin were represented. Concerning Gauguin's impact on Picasso, John Richardson wrote, > The 1906 exhibition of Gauguin's work left Picasso more than ever in this > artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art‚Äînot to > speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, > classical myths, and much else besides‚Äîcould be combined into a synthesis > that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound > conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to > the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping a new source of > divine energy. If in later years Picasso played down his debt to Gauguin, > there is no doubt that between 1905 and 1907 he felt a very close kinship > with this other Paul, who prided himself on Spanish genes inherited from his > Peruvian grandmother. Had not Picasso signed himself 'Paul' in Gauguin's > honor.Richardson 1991, 461. Both David Sweetman and John Richardson point to the Gauguin sculpture called Oviri (literally meaning 'savage'), the gruesome phallic figure of the Tahitian goddess of life and death that was intended for Gauguin's grave, exhibited in the 1906 retrospective exhibition that even more directly led to Les Demoiselles. Sweetman writes, \\"Gauguin's statue Oviri, which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso's interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in print-making, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso's art would take. This interest would culminate in the seminal Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.\\"Sweetman, 562‚Äì563. According to Richardson, > Picasso's interest in stoneware was further stimulated by the examples he > saw at the 1906 Gauguin retrospective at the Salon d'Automne. The most > disturbing of those ceramics (one that Picasso might have already seen at > Vollard's) was the gruesome Oviri.

Technique and style  Ta Matete, 1892, Kunstmuseum Basel Gauguin's initial artistic guidance was from Pissarro, but the relationship left more of a mark personally than stylistically. Gauguin's masters were Giotto, Raphael, Ingres, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Manet, Degas and C√©zanne. His own beliefs, and in some cases the psychology behind his work, were also influenced by philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer and poet St√©phane Mallarm√©. Gauguin, like some of his contemporaries such as Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec, employed a technique for painting on canvas known as peinture √† l'essence. For this, the oil (binder) is drained from the paint and the remaining sludge of pigment is mixed with turpentine. He may have used a similar technique in preparing his monotypes, using paper instead of metal, as it would absorb oil giving the final images a matte appearance he desired.Figura, Childs, Foster & Mosier (2014), 67 He also proofed some of his existing drawings with the aid of glass, copying an underneath image onto the glass surface with watercolour or gouache for printing. Gauguin's woodcuts were no less innovative, even to the avant-garde artists responsible for the woodcut revival happening at that time. Instead of incising his blocks with the intent of making a detailed illustration, Gauguin initially chiseled his blocks in a manner similar to wood sculpture, followed by finer tools to create detail and tonality within his bold contours. Many of his tools and techniques were considered experimental. This methodology and use of space ran parallel to his painting of flat, decorative reliefs.Figura, Childs, Foster & Mosier (2014), 23‚Äì26 Parahi te maras, 1892, Meyer de Schauensee collection Starting in Martinique, Gauguin began using analogous colours in close proximity to achieve a muted effect. Shortly after this he also made his breakthroughs in non-representational colour, creating canvases that had an independent existence and vitality all their own. This gap between surface reality and himself displeased Pissarro and quickly led to the end of their relationship. His human figures at this time are also a reminder of his love affair with Japanese prints, particularly gravitating to the naivety of their figures and compositional austerity as an influence on his primitive manifesto. For that very reason, Gauguin was also inspired by folk art. He sought out a bare emotional purity of his subjects conveyed in a straightforward way, emphasizing major forms and upright lines to clearly define shape and contour. Gauguin also used elaborate formal decoration and colouring in patterns of abstraction, attempting to harmonize man and nature. His depictions of the natives in their natural environment are frequently evident of serenity and a self-contained sustainability. This complimented one of Gauguin's favourite themes, which was the intrusion of the supernatural into day-to-day life, in one instance going so far as to recall ancient Egyptian tomb reliefs with Her Name is Vairaumati and Ta Matete. In an interview with L'√âcho de Paris published on 15 March 1895, Gauguin explains that his developing tactical approach is reaching for synesthesia. He states: :Every feature in my paintings is carefully considered and calculated in advance. Just as in a musical composition, if you like. My simple object, which I take from daily life or from nature, is merely a pretext, which helps me by the means of a definite arrangement of lines and colours to create symphonies and harmonies. They have no counterparts at all in reality, in the vulgar sense of that word; they do not give direct expression to any idea, their only purpose is to stimulate the imagination‚Äîjust as music does without the aid of ideas or pictures‚Äîsimply by that mysterious affinity which exists between certain arrangements of colours and lines and our minds. In an 1888 letter to Schuffenecker, Gauguin explains the enormous step he had taken away from Impressionism and that he was now intent on capturing the soul of nature, the ancient truths and character of its scenery and inhabitants. Gauguin wrote: :Don't copy nature too literally. Art is an abstraction. Derive it from nature as you dream in nature's presence, and think more about the act of creation than the outcome.  Other media  Gauguin began making prints in 1889, highlighted by a series of zincographs commissioned by Theo van Gogh known as the Volpini Suite, which also appeared in the Cafe des Arts show of 1889. Gauguin was not hindered by his printing inexperience, and made a number of provocative and unorthodox choices, such as a zinc plate instead of limestone (lithography), wide margins and large sheets of yellow poster paper.Figura, Childs, Foster & Mosier (2014), 19 The result was vivid to the point of garish, but foreshadows his more elaborate experiments with colour printing and intent to elevate monochromatic images. His first masterpieces of printing were from the Noa Noa Suite of 1893‚Äì94 where he was one of a number of artists reinventing the technique of the woodcut, bringing it into the modern era. He started the series shortly after returning from Tahiti, eager to reclaim a leadership position within the avant-garde and share pictures based on his French Polynesia excursion. These woodcuts were shown at his unsuccessful 1893 show at Paul Durand-Ruel's, and most were directly related to paintings of his in which he had revised the original composition. They were shown again at a small show in his studio in 1894, where he garnered rare critical praise for his exceptional painterly and sculptural effects. Gauguin's emerging preference for the woodcut was not only a natural extension of his wood reliefs and sculpture, but may have also been provoked by its historical significance to medieval artisans and the Japanese.Figura, Childs, Foster & Mosier (2014), 19‚Äì24 The Universe is Created (L'Univers est cr√©√©), from the Noa Noa suite, 1893‚Äì94, Princeton University Art Museum Change of Residence, 1899, woodcut, private collection Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude), 1894, woodcut sheet, Yale University Art Gallery Gauguin started making watercolour monotypes in 1894, likely overlapping his Noa Noa woodcuts, perhaps even serving as a source of inspiration for them. His techniques remained innovative and it was an apt technique for him as it didn't require elaborate equipment, such as a printing press. Despite often being a source of practice for related paintings, sculptures or woodcuts, his monotype innovation offers a distinctly ethereal aesthetic; ghostly afterimages that may express his desire to convey the immemorial truths of nature. His next major woodcut and monotype project was not until 1898‚Äì99, known as the Vollard Suite. He completed this enterprising series of 475 prints from some twenty different compositions and sent them to the dealer Ambroise Vollard, despite not compromising to his request for salable, conformed work. Vollard was unsatisfied and made no effort to sell them. Gauguin's series is starkly unified with black and white aesthetic and may have intended the prints to be similar to a set of myriorama cards, in which they may be laid out in any order to create multiple panoramic landscapes.Figura, Childs, Foster & Mosier (2014), 26‚Äì29 This activity of arranging and rearranging was similar to his own process of repurposing his images and motifs, as well as a symbolism tendency. He printed the work on tissue-thin Japanese paper and the multiple proofs of gray and black could be arranged on top of one another, each transparency of colour showing through to produce a rich, chiaroscuro effect.Figura, Childs, Foster & Mosier (2014), 30 In 1899 he started his radical experiment: oil transfer drawings. Much like his watercolour monotype technique, it was a hybrid of drawing and printmaking. The transfers were the grand culmination of his quest for an aesthetic of primordial suggestion, which seems to be relayed in his results that echo ancient rubbings, worn frescos and cave paintings. Gauguin's technical progress from monotyping to the oil transfers is quite noticeable, advancing from small sketches to ambitiously large, highly finished sheets. With these transfers he created depth and texture by printing multiple layers onto the same sheet, beginning with graphite pencil and black ink for delineation, before moving to blue crayon to reinforce line and add shading. He would often complete the image with a wash of oiled-down olive or brown ink. The practice consumed Gauguin until his death, fueling his imagination and conception of new subjects and themes for his paintings. This collection was also sent to Vollard who remained unimpressed. Gauguin prized oil transfers for the way they transformed the quality of drawn line. His process, nearly alchemical in nature, had elements of chance by which unexpected marks and textures regularly arose, something that fascinated him. In metamorphosing a drawing into a print, Gauguin made a calculated decision of relinquishing legibility in order to gain mystery and abstraction.Figura, Childs, Foster & Mosier (2014), 30‚Äì32Field pp. 20‚Äì2 He worked in wood throughout his career, particularly during his most prolific periods, and is known for having achieved radical carving results before doing so with painting. Even in his earliest shows, Gauguin often included wood sculpture in his display, from which he built his reputation as a connoisseur of the so-called primitive. A number of his early carvings appear to be influenced by Gothic and Egyptian art.Figura, Childs, Foster & Mosier (2014), 37 In correspondence, he also asserts a passion for Cambodian art and the masterful colouring of Persian carpet and Oriental rug.  Legacy  Nafea Faa Ipoipo (When Will You Marry?), 1892, sold for a record US$210 million in 2014. The vogue for Gauguin's work started soon after his death. Many of his later paintings were acquired by the Russian collector Sergei Shchukin. A substantial part of his collection is displayed in the Pushkin Museum and the Hermitage. Gauguin paintings are rarely offered for sale, their prices reaching tens of millions of US dollars in the saleroom when they are offered. His 1892 Nafea Faa Ipoipo (When Will You Marry?) became the world's third-most expensive artwork when its owner, the family of Rudolf Staechelin, sold it privately for US$210 million in September 2014. The buyer is believed to be the Qatar Museums. *Gauguin's life inspired W. Somerset Maugham's novel The Moon and Sixpence. Mario Vargas Llosa based his 2003 novel The Way to Paradise on Gauguin's life, and that of his grandmother Flora Tristan. *Actor Anthony Quinn portrayed Gauguin in the 1956 Van Gogh biopic Lust for Life and won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. Oscar Isaac played Gauguin in the later Van Gogh biopic At Eternity's Gate. Wladimir Yordanoff played Gauguin in the 1990 film Vincent & Theo. *Gauguin is also the subject of at least two operas: Federico Elizalde's Paul Gauguin (1943); and Gauguin (a synthetic life) by Michael Smetanin and Alison Croggon. D√©odat de S√©verac wrote his Elegy for piano in memory of Gauguin. *The Danish-produced film Oviri (1986) is a biographical film. With Gauguin portrayed by Donald Sutherland, the film follows the painter from the time he returns to Paris in 1893 after a two-year stay in Tahiti and must confront his wife, his children and his former lover. It ends when he returns to Tahiti two years later. Coincidentally, Sutherland's son Kiefer Sutherland portrayed a younger Gauguin in a less focused and much less historically accurate film Paradise Found (2003). Several other independent films have explored different aspects of Gauguin's eventful life. *His biography is depicted in the 2017 French film Gauguin: Voyage to Tahiti portraying his life during his years in Tahiti. The Japanese styled Gauguin Museum, opposite the Botanical Gardens of Papeari in Papeari, Tahiti, contains some exhibits, documents, photographs, reproductions and original sketches and block prints of Gauguin and Tahitians. In 2003, the Paul Gauguin Cultural Center opened in Atuona in the Marquesas Islands. In 2014 the painting Fruits on a Table (1889), with an estimated value of between ‚Ç¨10m and ‚Ç¨30m (¬£8.3m to ¬£24.8m), which had been stolen in London in 1970, was discovered in Italy. The painting, together with a work by Pierre Bonnard, had been bought by a Fiat employee in 1975, at a railway lost property sale, for 45,000 lira (about ¬£32).

Some species can grow to tall or more, with a straight, largely branchless trunk that culminates in a huge, spreading canopy, and buttress roots that can be taller than a grown person. The best- known, and most widely cultivated, species is Kapok, Ceiba pentandra, one of several trees called kapok. Ceiba species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species, including the leaf- miner Bucculatrix ceibae, which feeds exclusively on the genus. Recent botanical opinion incorporates Chorisia within Ceiba and puts the genus as a whole within the family Malvaceae.A TAXONOMIC REVISION OF THE GENUS CEIBA MILL.(2003) Culture and history Ceiba tree in Honolulu The tree plays an important part in the mythologies of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures. For example, several Amazonian tribes of eastern Peru believe deities live in Ceiba tree species throughout the jungle. The Ceiba, or ya‚Äôaxch√© (in the Mopan Mayan language), symbolised to the Maya civilization an axis mundi which connects the planes of the Underworld (Xibalba) and the sky with that of the terrestrial realm. This concept of a central world tree is often depicted as a Ceiba trunk. The unmistakable thick conical thorns in clusters on the trunk were reproduced by the southern lowland Maya of the Classical Period on cylindrical ceramic burial urns or incense holders. Ceiba speciosa Modern Maya still often respectfully leave the tree standing when harvesting forest timber.(BBC Earth News) \\"Sacred plants of the Maya forest\\", 5 June 2009 accessed 6 June 2009. Pachira aquatica and Pseudobombax ellipticum are also represented in the designs of similar ceramics. The Ceiba tree is represented by a cross and serves as an important architectural motif in the Temple of the Cross Complex at Palenque. Ceiba Tree Park is located in San Ant√≥n, Ponce, Puerto Rico. Its centerpiece is the historic Ceiba de Ponce, a 500-year-old Ceiba pentandra tree associated with the founding of the city.En intensivo la venerada Ceiba de Ponce. Jason Rodr√≠guez Grafal. La Perla del Sur. Ponce Puerto Rico. 19 July 2011. Retrieved 20 July 2011.Explore Puerto Rico By Harry S. Pariser. Page 246. In the surroundings of the legendary Ceiba de Ponce, broken pieces of indigenous pottery, shells, and stones were found to confirm the presence of Taino Indians long before the Spaniards that later settled in the area.\\"Ceiba de Ponce. TravelPonce In 1525, Spanish Conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s ordered the hanging of Aztec emperor Cuauhtemoc from a Ceiba tree after overtaking his empire. The town of Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico was founded in 1528 by the Spanish around La Pochota, Ceiba pentandra, according to tradition. Founded in 1838, the Puerto Rican town of Ceiba is also named after this tree. The Honduran city of La Ceiba founded in 1877 was named after a particular Ceiba tree that grew down by the old docks. In 1898, the Spanish Army in Cuba surrendered to the United States under a Ceiba, which was named the Santiago Surrender Tree, outside of Santiago de Cuba. Ceiba is also the national tree of Guatemala. The most important Ceiba in Guatemala is known as La Ceiba de Pal√≠n Escuintla which is over 400 years old. In Caracas, Venezuela there is a 100-year-old ceiba tree in front of the San Francisco Church known as La Ceiba de San Francisco and is an important element in the history of the city. The towering specimen near the town of Sabalito, Costa Rica, is a relict tree called \\"la ceiba\\" by residents and a survivor of one of the highest terrestrial rates of tropical deforestation.One Tree By Gretchen C. Daily and Charles J. Katz Jr. Ceiba pentandra produces a light and strong fiber (kapok) used throughout history to fill mattresses, pillows, tapestries, and dolls. Kapok has recently been replaced in commercial use by synthetic fibers. The Ceiba tree seed is used to extract oils used to make soap and fertilizers. The Ceiba continues to be commercialized in Asia, especially in Java, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Ceiba pentandra is the central theme in the book titled, The Great Kapok Tree by Lynne Cherry. Ceiba insignis and Ceiba speciosa are added to some versions of the hallucinogenic drink Ayahuasca. Pablo Antonio Cuadra, a Nicaraguan poet, wrote a chapter about the Ceiba tree. He used it as a symbol of the Nicaraguan ancestral roots, a cradle for the nation, and source during the people's exile.

Description and origin The manuscripts were found bound into a Latin codex (manuscript book). Four parchment leaves and a further quarter of a page have been preserved. They consist of three texts in the oldest Slovene dialect. Linguistic, stylistic and contextual analyses reveal that these are church texts of careful composition and literary form. The precise date of the origin of the Freising Manuscripts cannot be exactly determined; the original text was probably written in the 9th century. In this liturgic and homiletic manuscript, three Slovene records were found and this miscellany was probably an episcopal manual (pontificals). The Freising Manuscripts in it were created between 972 and 1039, most likely before 1000. The main support for this dating is the writing, which was used in the centuries after Charlemagne and is named Carolingian minuscule. During the time of the writing of the two manuscripts (sermons on sin and repentance, a confessional form), Bishop Abraham was active (from 957 to 994) in Freising. It is believed that the manuscripts were written in the M√∂ll River Valley in Carinthia. For this reason some linguists (e.g. Jernej Kopitar and Rajko Nahtigal) linked Abraham closely to the origin of the Freising Manuscripts and even attributed to him the authorship of one of the texts and suspected that he was of Slovene origin, although this was later disproven. Modern history The manuscripts were discovered in Freising, Bavaria. The Slovene name Bri≈æinski spomeniki (literally 'Bri≈æinj Monuments') was coined by the Carinthian Slovene philologist Anton Jane≈æiƒç, who Slovenized the German name Freising to Bri≈æinj in 1854.Pogaƒçnik, Jo≈æe & Franc Zadravec. 1968. Zgodovina slovenskega slovstva: Srednji vek, reformacija in protireformacija, manirizem in barok. Maribor: Obzorja, p. 64. In 1803, the manuscript came to the Bavarian State Library in Munich and the Freising Manuscripts were discovered there in 1807. The texts were translated into modern Slovene in 1854 by the philologist Anton Jane≈æiƒç. Before World War II, a facsimile of the Freising Manuscripts was published by Silvester ≈†kerl at Akademska zalo≈æba (Academic Publisher) in Ljubljana. Exhibitions The manuscripts are still kept at the Bavarian State Library in Munich and have left it only twice. In the 1970s, they were exhibited in the Vatican Museums.

K rock operates a mainstream Top 40 playlist. As of 2020, the featured on-air line-up consists of \\"Fresh Daily with Tom and Loggy\\", hosted by Tom Lewis and Lauren \\"Loggy\\" Temuskos from 6:00 am ‚Äì 9:00 am weekdays; Ben (The Fill-In Guy), from 10:00 am ‚Äì 2:00 pm weekdays; Lee \\"Stampsy\\" Stamps and Josh Jeans (The Departure Lounge), from 4:00 pm ‚Äì 6:00 pm weekdays; and Andy and Ben from The Block, from 8:00 am ‚Äì 10:00 am on Saturdays and Sundays). K rock‚Äôs football coverage mainly consists of Australian Football League matches involving the Geelong Football Club. Commentators include Tom King and Ben Casanelia. K rock shares transmitter facilities with sister station 93.9 Bay FM (along with 94.7 The Pulse and 96.3 Rhema FM) - broadcasting from a high-powered transmitter on top of Murradoc Hill on the Bellarine Peninsula. The license area covers the Greater Geelong area, Werribee and Western Melbourne, The Golden Plains, and the Surf Coast. K rock also streams online via their website. History =3GL= From 1930 to 1990, K rock was known as 3GL on the AM band, broadcasting first on 1400 kHz, then 1350 kHz and later 1341 kHz. Although based in Geelong, it was notable for being received over most of the Melbourne metropolitan area. 3GL gave Happy Hammond his start in broadcasting in 1948 as a breakfast announcer. While at 3GL, Hammond also made his first TV appearance in 1948, long before the Tarax Show, as part of an exhibition using closed-circuit TV equipment for trial purposes.King, by Graeme Blundell, p.79, 3GL was the home of many well- known announcers who formerly worked in Melbourne, including Gene Fisk, Don Lunn, David Coburn and Denis Scanlan. Other well-known announcers included John Vertigan, Gary Newton, Tim Hind, Rod Poynter, Ric Ditchburn and Don Crawford. Towards the end of its time as an AM station, 3GL used the \\"3GL on the West Coast\\" slogan and associated jingles, many sung by Mike Brady of \\"Up There Cazaly\\" fame. For many years, 3GL was based in James Street, Geelong, but relocated after being granted the right to convert to the FM band in 1990. 3GL was offered an FM conversion upon the entry to the Geelong market of competitor BAY FM in December 1989. 3GL converted to FM to allow equal competition in the Geelong regional market, with the management of the former Geelong AM service agreeing to transfer the service to the FM band in 1990. The station was going to drop the 3GL call sign in favour of 3CAT (after the Geelong Cats), as proposed by the radio station's head of football commentary Ted Whitten (who at the time was in the early stages of his battle with cancer). However, the 3CAT call-sign never made it to air, being changed to K rock on the eve of the station's commencement on the FM band at 95.5 MHz, on 27 January 1990. =K rock= After simulcasting on both 1341 AM and 95.5 FM for two weeks, K rock went to air at midday on the Saturday of the Australia Day weekend 1990, the first announcer to speak on the new FM station was Ian 'Strawny' Strachan. The original line-up consisted of Mike O'Loughlin & Bogart Torelli (breakfast), Dave Ferguson, Tim Hind, Craig Vesey, Ian Strachan, Gavin Morris and Craig Meddings. K Rock's most successful lineup in the mid-1990s featured \\"Dave & Roxie on the Big Mattress\\" (Dave Gorr, Roxanne Bennett and Brendan Roberts' character voices), Steve Woods (also Program Director), Todd Austin, Frank Fursey & Wazza (Warren Penny). At its peak this lineup delivered record ratings in Geelong, Werribee and Western Melbourne with a blend of Classic Rock, Modern Rock and local personality. Other K rockers have been John Hood, Peter Mobbs, Rick The Roadie (Simon Dale), Daryl Reader, Steve Chandler, Matt Bern, Dan Veling and Greg Parkinson. K Rock was also Australia's first FM station to cover AFL football. With a lineup that included Ted Whitten, Sam Kekovich, Billy Brownless and Dwayne Russell, K Rock continues to focus on all Geelong Football Club matches, and is proudly one- eyed. In 1996, K rock FM and Bay FM achieved a record 11 RAWARD nominations in the programming area, winning 5 awards‚Äîan achievement only equalled that year by Melbourne's Fox FM. During this period, despite the strength of all Melbourne radio stations reaching the listening area, nearly 1 in 3 Geelong people listened to K rock. In recent years, the ratings of K rock have declined to the point where a 2016 ratings survey showed an audience of 8.9 per cent in the local area‚Äîbehind the ABC and sister station Bay FM.https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/abc774-number-one-geelong-bay-fm-close- second Originally owned by the Hoyts organisation, which operated the successful Triple M brand in Australia, K rock was sold to Sydney-based Grant Broadcasting in the mid-1990s. Shortly after this, the station purchased the rival Geelong station, 93.9 Bay FM, moving it from its Ryrie Street studios to co-locate in the K rock studios in Moorabool Street, Geelong. Both K Rock and Bay FM now operate from the same studios in Geelong's CBD. In 2007, K rock celebrated 75 years of broadcasting 3GL and K rock Footy, culminating in a week of broadcasting at various events as the city celebrated the first AFL Premiership victory by the Geelong Football Club in 44 years. In 2010, K rock underwent a major format change which re-focused the music toward a younger audience and minimised the station's traditional rock base.

He was an early proponent of Leibnizian calculus and sided with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz during the Leibniz‚ÄìNewton calculus controversy. He is known for his numerous contributions to calculus, and along with his brother Johann, was one of the founders of the calculus of variations. He also discovered the fundamental mathematical constant . However, his most important contribution was in the field of probability, where he derived the first version of the law of large numbers in his work Ars Conjectandi.Jacob (Jacques) Bernoulli, The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive, School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, UK. Biography Jacob Bernoulli was born in Basel, Switzerland. Following his father's wish, he studied theology and entered the ministry. But contrary to the desires of his parents, he also studied mathematics and astronomy. He traveled throughout Europe from 1676 to 1682, learning about the latest discoveries in mathematics and the sciences under leading figures of the time. This included the work of Johannes Hudde, Robert Boyle, and Robert Hooke. During this time he also produced an incorrect theory of comets. Image from Acta Eruditorum (1682) wherein was published the critique of Bernoulli's Conamen novi systematis cometarum Bernoulli returned to Switzerland, and began teaching mechanics at the University of Basel from 1683. His doctoral dissertation Solutionem tergemini problematis was submitted in 1684. It appeared in print in 1687. In 1684 Bernoulli married Judith Stupanus; they had two children. During this decade, he also began a fertile research career. His travels allowed him to establish correspondence with many leading mathematicians and scientists of his era, which he maintained throughout his life. During this time, he studied the new discoveries in mathematics, including Christiaan Huygens's De ratiociniis in aleae ludo, Descartes' La G√©om√©trie and Frans van Schooten's supplements of it. He also studied Isaac Barrow and John Wallis, leading to his interest in infinitesimal geometry. Apart from these, it was between 1684 and 1689 that many of the results that were to make up Ars Conjectandi were discovered. He was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Basel in 1687, remaining in this position for the rest of his life. By that time, he had begun tutoring his brother Johann Bernoulli on mathematical topics. The two brothers began to study the calculus as presented by Leibniz in his 1684 paper on the differential calculus in \\"Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis\\" published in Acta Eruditorum. They also studied the publications of von Tschirnhaus. It must be understood that Leibniz's publications on the calculus were very obscure to mathematicians of that time and the Bernoullis were among the first to try to understand and apply Leibniz's theories. Jacob collaborated with his brother on various applications of calculus. However the atmosphere of collaboration between the two brothers turned into rivalry as Johann's own mathematical genius began to mature, with both of them attacking each other in print, and posing difficult mathematical challenges to test each other's skills. By 1697, the relationship had completely broken down. The lunar crater Bernoulli is also named after him jointly with his brother Johann. Important works Jacob Bernoulli's first important contributions were a pamphlet on the parallels of logic and algebra published in 1685, work on probability in 1685 and geometry in 1687. His geometry result gave a construction to divide any triangle into four equal parts with two perpendicular lines. By 1689 he had published important work on infinite series and published his law of large numbers in probability theory. Jacob Bernoulli published five treatises on infinite series between 1682 and 1704 The first two of these contained many results, such as the fundamental result that \\\\sum{\\\\frac{1}{n}} diverges, which Bernoulli believed were new but they had actually been proved by Mengoli 40 years earlier. Bernoulli could not find a closed form for \\\\sum{\\\\frac{1}{n^2}}, but he did show that it converged to a finite limit less than 2. Euler was the first to find the sum of this series in 1737. Bernoulli also studied the exponential series which came out of examining compound interest. In May 1690 in a paper published in Acta Eruditorum, Jacob Bernoulli showed that the problem of determining the isochrone is equivalent to solving a first-order nonlinear differential equation. The isochrone, or curve of constant descent, is the curve along which a particle will descend under gravity from any point to the bottom in exactly the same time, no matter what the starting point. It had been studied by Huygens in 1687 and Leibniz in 1689. After finding the differential equation, Bernoulli then solved it by what we now call separation of variables. Jacob Bernoulli's paper of 1690 is important for the history of calculus, since the term integral appears for the first time with its integration meaning. In 1696 Bernoulli solved the equation, now called the Bernoulli differential equation, : y' = p(x)y + q(x)y^n. Jacob Bernoulli also discovered a general method to determine evolutes of a curve as the envelope of its circles of curvature. He also investigated caustic curves and in particular he studied these associated curves of the parabola, the logarithmic spiral and epicycloids around 1692. The lemniscate of Bernoulli was first conceived by Jacob Bernoulli in 1694. In 1695 he investigated the drawbridge problem which seeks the curve required so that a weight sliding along the cable always keeps the drawbridge balanced. Ars conjectandi, 1713 (Milano, Fondazione Mansutti). Jacob Bernoulli's most original work was Ars Conjectandi published in Basel in 1713, eight years after his death. The work was incomplete at the time of his death but it is still a work of the greatest significance in the theory of probability. In the book Bernoulli reviewed work of others on probability, in particular work by van Schooten, Leibniz, and Prestet. The Bernoulli numbers appear in the book in a discussion of the exponential series. Many examples are given on how much one would expect to win playing various games of chance. The term Bernoulli trial resulted from this work. There are interesting thoughts on what probability really is: > ... probability as a measurable degree of certainty; necessity and chance; > moral versus mathematical expectation; a priori an a posteriori probability; > expectation of winning when players are divided according to dexterity; > regard of all available arguments, their valuation, and their calculable > evaluation; law of large numbers ... Bernoulli was one of the most significant promoters of the formal methods of higher analysis. Astuteness and elegance are seldom found in his method of presentation and expression, but there is a maximum of integrity. Discovery of the mathematical constant e In 1683 Bernoulli discovered the constant e by studying a question about compound interest which required him to find the value of the following expression (which is in fact ):Jacob Bernoulli (1690) \\"Qu√¶stiones nonnull√¶ de usuris, cum solutione problematis de sorte alearum, propositi in Ephem. Gall. A. 1685\\" (Some questions about interest, with a solution of a problem about games of chance, proposed in the Journal des Savants (Ephemerides Eruditorum Gallican√¶), in the year (anno) 1685.**), Acta eruditorum, pp. 219‚Äì23. On p. 222, Bernoulli poses the question: \\"Alterius natur√¶ hoc Problema est: Qu√¶ritur, si creditor aliquis pecuni√¶ summam f√¶nori exponat, ea lege, ut singulis momentis pars proportionalis usur√¶ annu√¶ sorti annumeretur; quantum ipsi finito anno debeatur?\\" (This is a problem of another kind: The question is, if some lender were to invest [a] sum of money [at] interest, let it accumulate, so that [at] every moment [it] were to receive [a] proportional part of [its] annual interest; how much would he be owed [at the] end of [the] year?) Bernoulli constructs a power series to calculate the answer, and then writes: \\" ‚Ä¶ qu√¶ nostra serie [mathematical expression for a geometric series] &c.; major est. ‚Ä¶ si a=b, debebitur plu quam 2¬Ωa & minus quam 3a.\\" ( ‚Ä¶ which our series [a geometric series] is larger [than]. ‚Ä¶ if a=b, [the lender] will be owed more than 2¬Ωa and less than 3a.) If a=b, the geometric series reduces to the series for a √ó e, so 2.5 < e < 3\\\\. (** The reference is to a problem which Jacob Bernoulli posed and which appears in the Journal des S√ßavans of 1685 at the bottom of page 314.) :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\right)^n One example is an account that starts with $1.00 and pays 100 percent interest per year. If the interest is credited once, at the end of the year, the value is $2.00; but if the interest is computed and added twice in the year, the $1 is multiplied by 1.5 twice, yielding $1.00√ó1.5¬≤ = $2.25. Compounding quarterly yields $1.00√ó1.254 = $2.4414..., and compounding monthly yields $1.00√ó(1.0833...)12 = $2.613035.... Bernoulli noticed that this sequence approaches a limit (the force of interest) for more and smaller compounding intervals. Compounding weekly yields $2.692597..., while compounding daily yields $2.714567..., just two cents more. Using as the number of compounding intervals, with interest of 100%/ in each interval, the limit for large is the number that Euler later named ; with continuous compounding, the account value will reach $2.7182818.... More generally, an account that starts at $1, and yields (1+) dollars at Compound interest, will yield dollars with continuous compounding. Tombstone Jacob Bernoulli's tombstone in Basel M√ºnster Bernoulli wanted a logarithmic spiral and the motto Eadem mutata resurgo ('Although changed, I rise again the same') engraved on his tombstone. He wrote that the self- similar spiral \\"may be used as a symbol, either of fortitude and constancy in adversity, or of the human body, which after all its changes, even after death, will be restored to its exact and perfect self.\\" Bernoulli died in 1705, but an Archimedean spiral was engraved rather than a logarithmic one.

Lord, and the Californian more generally, have been criticized for the fact that the Californian did not render timely assistance to the Titanic despite being only 20 miles away and the only ship that could have reached Titanic before she sank. Two official inquiries were critical of Lord, but did not recommend criminal charges. Subsequent authors have offered differing opinions on Lord's actions, with some defending, and others criticizing him. The passion among the two factions has resulted in the labels of \\"Lordites\\" and \\"Anti-Lordites\\" being applied to the two camps. Central points of debate typically include the appropriateness of Lord's response to the rockets, whether the Californian and Titanic were in fact visible to one another (and additionally the visibility of the rockets), the possible presence of one or more \\"Mystery Ships\\" that may have been the ships seen by either the Titanic or Californian (assuming they did not in fact see each other), and whether or not the Californian could have saved any additional lives had it attempted to render assistance more quickly.  Early life  Lord was born on 13 September 1877 in Bolton, Lancashire, England. He began his training at sea when he was thirteen, aboard the barque Naiad, in March 1891. He later obtained his Second Mate‚Äôs Certificate of competency and served as Second Officer on the barque Lurlei. In February 1901, at the age of 23, Lord obtained his Master's Certificate, and three months later, obtained his Extra Master‚Äôs Certificate. He entered the service of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company in 1897. The company was taken over by the Leyland Line in 1900, but Lord continued service with the new company, and was awarded his first command in 1906. Lord was given command of the SS Californian in 1911.  Personal life  Lord was married and had a son. His wife, Mabel, died in 1957, and Lord died in 1962, when it was suggested that the stress of attempts to exonerate himself had contributed to the deterioration of his own health after his wife's death. Their son, Stanley Tutton Lord (1908‚Äì1994), worked as a banker in Liverpool; he never married or had children. He lived as a bachelor until his death from natural causes in 1994. He rarely spoke of his father, except to say he believed in his innocence. In 1965 he wrote a preface to a book by Peter Padfield, The Titanic and the Californian, which supported the case for Lord having been judged unfairly. Titanic sinking  = Before the sinking = On the night of 14 April 1912, as the Californian approached a large ice field, Captain Lord decided to stop around 10:21 p.m. (ship's time) and wait out the night. Before turning in for the night, he ordered his sole wireless operator, Cyril Evans, to warn other ships in the area about the ice. When reaching the Titanic, Evans tapped out \\"I say old man, we are stopped and surrounded by ice.\\" The Californian was so close to the Titanic that the message was very loud in the ears of Titanic First Wireless Operator Jack Phillips, who angrily replied \\"Keep out! Shut up! I am working [i.e., communicating with] Cape Race.\\" Earlier in the day the wireless equipment aboard the Titanic had broken down and Phillips, along with Second Wireless Operator Harold Bride, had spent the better part of the day trying to repair it. Now they were swamped with outgoing messages that had piled up during the day and Phillips was exhausted after such a long day. Evans listened in for a while longer as Phillips sent routine traffic through the Cape Race relaying station before finally turning in for bed at around 11:30 p.m. = Night of Titanic sinking = Over the course of the night, officers and seamen on the deck of Californian witnessed eight white rockets fired into the air over a strange ship off in the distance. Fatigued after 17 hours on duty, Captain Stanley Lord was awakened twice during the night and told about the rockets, to which he replied that they may be \\"company rockets\\", to help ships identify themselves to liners of the same company. Meanwhile, on the Titanic, for an hour after the collision, no other ships were noticed until the lights of a ship were seen in the distance. Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall and Quartermaster Rowe tried in vain to contact the strange ship by Morse lamp. Nobody on the deck of the Californian saw these signals; however, they had also tried to signal the mystery ship, but were unable to get a response. Authors Tim Maltin and Eloise Aston attribute Captain Lord's belief that the nearby ship was not the Titanic to visual distortions caused by cold-water mirages.Maltin, Tim and Aston, Eloise 101 Things You Thought You Knew About the Titanic...But Didn't Beautiful Books (2 April 2010) Not able to understand any messages coming from the strange ship, Californian's officers eventually concluded that signals were merely the masthead flickering and not signals at all. Throughout the night, no one on board the Californian attempted to wake their wireless operator, and ask him to contact the ship to ask why they were firing rockets and trying to signal them, until 5:30 a.m. By then, however, it was too late ‚Äî the Titanic had gone down at 2:20 a.m. When she had slipped below the water, the sudden disappearance of lights was interpreted by the Californian crew to mean that she had simply steamed away. = Search and recovery = On the morning of 15 April 1912, Captain Lord was notified by the Frankfurt that the Titanic had gone down early that morning. At 8:45 a.m, the Californian pulled up alongside the Carpathia and stayed behind to search for additional bodies after the Carpathia steamed towards New York. = Lord's testimony = The following is from Captain Lord's testimony in the US Inquiry on 26 April:  Reputation  While Lord was never tried or convicted of any offence, he was still viewed publicly as a pariah after the Titanic disaster. His attempts to fight for his exoneration gained him nothing, and the events of the night of 14‚Äì15 April 1912 would haunt him for the rest of his life. Lord was dismissed by the Leyland Line in August 1912. So far as any negligence of the SS Californian's officers and crew was concerned, the conclusions of both the American and British inquiries seemed to disapprove of Lord's actions but stopped short of recommending charges. While both inquiries censured Lord, they did not make any recommendations for an official investigation to ascertain if he was guilty of offences under the Merchant Shipping Acts. Lord was not allowed to be represented at either the U.S. or British inquiry ‚Äî he was called to give evidence before he knew that he was to become a target for criticism, but having answered questions which were later interpreted to cast blame on him, he was denied the opportunity of speaking in his own defence. In February 1913, with help from a Leyland director who believed he had been unfairly treated, Lord was hired by the Nitrate Producers Steamship Co., where he remained until March 1927, resigning for health reasons. In 1958, Lord contacted the Mercantile Marine Service Association in Liverpool in an effort to clear his name. The association's general secretary, Mr. Leslie Harrison, took up the case for him and petitioned the Board of Trade on his behalf for a re-examination of the facts, but there had been no finding by the time of Lord's death in 1962. In 1965, largely because Lord had offered no new evidence, his petition was rejected, but in the same year Peter Padfield's book The Titanic and the Californian was published, defending Lord's reputation, with a preface by his son Stanley Tutton Lord.Eugene L. Rasor, The Titanic: Historiography and Annotated Bibliography (2001), p. 53 This was followed by a second petition, in 1968, which was also rejected. In 1957, at 80 years old, Stanley Lord's wife died. It was a devastating loss to him, and precipitated a decline in his health. In 1958 the film A Night To Remember was released, based on a 1955 book of the same title by Walter Lord (no relation). Stanley Lord, now 81 years old, never saw the film, but he read the Liverpool Echo newspaper reviews of the film. Lord was very disappointed, and it brought back memories of the Titanic tragedy, and was upset over his negative portrayal by the Australian-British actor Russell Napier, which depicted him as a captain that had stopped his ship for the night and who did not render any assistance to the foundering Titanic. Stanley Lord was sleeping in the chart room with his uniform on at the time of the disaster. In the film, he was in his warm cabin in his pyjamas in bed asleep when Titanic was sinking. Lord's son Stanley Tutton Lord saw the film, and was upset how his father was treated after the Titanic tragedy. In 1959 Stanley Tutton helped fight to get his father's name cleared from the records of the Titanic disaster. He continued his attempts after his father's death in 1962, up until his own death in 1994. It was also revealed that Stanley Tutton saw the TV Movie SOS Titanic 1979. The Californian as the nearest ship was not mentioned. The discovery in 1985 of the remains of the Titanic on the sea bed made it clear that the S.O.S. position given after the iceberg collision by the Titanic 's fourth officer, Joseph Boxhall, was wrong by thirteen miles. At both of the 1912 inquiries, there had been some conflict about the true position of the ship when it sank. The conclusions of the inquiries discounted the evidence of uncertainty about the position of the Titanic. At the time, some assumed that the position which Lord had given for his ship was incorrect and that he was actually much closer to the Titanic than he claimed to be. While the entries in the Californian's scrap log (used for recording information before it was written up officially in the ship's logbook) referring to the night in question had mysteriously gone missing, sometimes seen as overwhelming proof that Lord deliberately destroyed evidence in order to cover his crime of ignoring a distress call, destroying the scrap log records was actually normal company practice.RMS \\"TITANIC\\" Reappraisal of Evidence Relating to SS \\"CALIFORNIAN\\", 1992 Marine Accident Investigation Branch report, London 1992, HMSO, p. 8. While modifying the official ship's log or removing pages is a serious violation of maritime law, this was not the case. A re-appraisal by the British government, instigated informally in 1988 and published in 1992 by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB), further implicated the consequences of Lord's inaction. Among its conclusions were that although the Californian was probably out of visual sight, the Titanics rockets had been sighted by the Californians crew. Another conclusion stated that it was unrealistic to assume that Lord could have rushed towards the signals, and that with the Titanic reporting an incorrect position, the Californian would have arrived at about the same time as the Carpathia and fulfilled a similar role ‚Äì rescuing those who had escaped.MAIB 1992 report p. 18 The report was critical of the behavior of the other officers of the Californian in reaction to the signals. What has never been satisfactorily resolved was why Lord did not simply wake his radio operator and listen for any distress signals. Daniel Allen Butler, in his 2009 book The Other Side of Night: The Carpathia, the Californian, and the Night Titanic was Lost, makes a case that Lord's personality and temperament ‚Äî his behaviour at both inquiries, his threats towards his crew, his frequent changing of his story, the absence of the scrap log, and odd remarks made by Lord in Boston in a newspaper interview ‚Äì point to Lord's having some sort of mental illness. His lack of compassion ‚Äî never once expressing grief at the loss of the Titanic or sorrow for those who had lost family when she sank is, according to Butler, compatible with sociopathy.Butler, Daniel Allen; Epilogue: Flotsam and Jetsam; \\"The Other Side of Night: The Carpathia, the Californian, and the night Titanic was Lost\\" Butler's claims about Lord have been countered by Dr Paul Lee, another Titanic historian, who pointed to the numerous testimonials Lord received throughout his career for good conduct and the fact that, in the aftermath of the Titanic furore, people were willing to risk their own reputations to help Lord find employment with a new shipping line. Lee also noted that if Lord were such a tyrant, then the officers and sailors who willingly served under him on multiple voyages would surely not have done so. In his book The Titanic and the Indifferent Stranger, author Paul Lee noted the lack of reliable witnesses. Those on the Titanic were in the midst of a trauma, while those on board the Californian had an obvious reason to want to avoid blame. Navigational techniques of the time meant that the Titanic 's CQD position being wrong did not necessarily mean that the Californian was farther away, since the Californian 's position was likely wrong as well. He was also critical of both Lord and Stone for not reacting appropriately to the rockets, which should have been easily and universally understood as distress signals. He pointed to Lord's question about what color the rockets were as evidence of his ignorance, since rockets of any color indicated distress. He points out that the question of potential \\"Mystery Ships\\" was unlikely to ever be resolved, due to both poor record keeping as well as the fact that this issue was not well researched at the time. But he also noted that, even if the rockets did not come from the Titanic, the Californian was still ignoring some other ship's distress signals. Overall, he was quite critical of Lord and his defenders, especially Leslie Harrison, whom Lee accused of attempting to suppress works critical of Lord. However, he did conclude that the Californian probably would not have saved many, if any, additional lives, noting that because it would not have been feasible to bring the ships close enough to have people walk directly from one ship to the other, a rescue by the Californian would still have necessitated lowering the lifeboats, but Titanic 's officers were unable to even launch all of the lifeboats they had. Lee further hypothesized that, given the reluctance of many passengers to leave the ship in the early stages of the evacuation, the sight of an approaching ship might have provided even further discouragement to board the lifeboats, causing more deaths rather than fewer. Captain Lord died on 24 January 1962, aged 84, almost half a century after the sinking of the Titanic. He is buried in Wallasey Cemetery, Merseyside.

She was a prominent leader of the disarmament movement. She, along with Alfonso Garcia Robles, received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1982. She married Gunnar Myrdal in 1924. Biography = Early life and studies = Alva Myrdal was born in Uppsala and grew up as the first child of a modest family, the daughter of Albert Reimer (1876‚Äì1943) and Lowa Jonsson (1877‚Äì1943). She had four siblings: Ruth (1904‚Äì1980), Folke (1906‚Äì1977), May (1909‚Äì1941) and Stig (1912‚Äì1977). Her father was a socialist and modern liberal. During her childhood the family moved around to different places. For example, they were residents of Eskilstuna, Fairfield and Stockholm. Her academic studies involved psychology and family sociology. She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Stockholm in 1924. In 1929, Myrdal and her husband Gunnar Myrdal had the opportunity to travel to the US as Rockefeller Fellows. Myrdal further deepened her studies in the fields of psychology, education and sociology whilst in the US. She had the special chance to broaden her knowledge of children's education. Myrdal's observation of the great social and economic disparities in the United States also led to an increased political commitment ‚Äì \\"radical\\" was the term that she and her husband came to use to describe their shared political outlook They then moved to Geneva for further studies, where they started to so study the population decline that worried many Europeans during the interwar period. = Politics of the family and population issue = Myrdal first came to public attention in the 1930s, and was one of the main driving forces in the creation of the Swedish welfare state. She coauthored the book Crisis in the Population Question ( with Gunnar Myrdal in 1934). The basic premise of Crisis in the Population Question is to find what social reforms are needed to allow for individual liberty (especially for women) while also promoting child-bearing, and encouraging Swedes to have children. The book also detailed the importance of shared responsibility for children's education both between the parents as well as the community by trained child educators. Myrdal was highly critical of developments in the operation of preschools for children in Sweden. Consequently, she published the book Urban Children (1935), where she presented her ideas for a newly reformed Swedish preschool system. She argued that contemporary child care was flawed. The system was polarized between two extremes ‚Äì measures of 'poor relief' for the less well-off contrasted with those measures which prepared children from wealthier families for private schools. She stressed that there were material obstacles in the way of being able to access a good education. Therefore, social and economic reforms were needed. Myrdal wanted to combine and integrate the two extremes. A year later, she was able to put her theory into practice, as she became director of the National Educational Seminar, which she cofounded in 1936. She personally worked there as a teacher and pedagogue by training preschool teachers. Myrdal emphasized the lack of recent educational research in regards to preschool teacher training. Her teaching tried to integrate the new discoveries in child psychology in education. Social studies were also emphasized, as was women's personal development. With architect Sven Markelius, Myrdal designed Stockholm's cooperative Collective House in 1937, with an eye towards developing more domestic liberty for women. In 1938, Alva and Gunnar Myrdal moved to the United States. While in the US, Myrdal published the book Nation and Family (1941) concerning the Swedish family unit and population policy. During World War II, she also periodically lived in Sweden. = Postwar career takeoff = A long-time prominent member of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, in the late 1940s she became involved in international issues with the United Nations, appointed to head its section on welfare policy in 1949. From 1950 to 1955 she was chairman of UNESCO's social science section‚Äîthe first woman to hold such prominent positions in the UN. In 1955‚Äì1956, she served as a Swedish envoy to New Delhi, India, Yangon, Myanmar and Colombo, Sri Lanka. In 1962, Myrdal was elected to the Swedish parliament, and in 1962 she was sent as the Swedish delegate to the UN disarmament conference in Geneva, a role she kept until 1973. During the negotiations in Geneva, she played an extremely active role, emerging as the leader of the group of nonaligned nations which endeavored to bring pressure to bear on the two superpowers (US and USSR, respectively) to show greater concern for concrete disarmament measures. Her experiences from the years spent in Geneva found an outlet in her book \\"The game of disarmament\\", in which she expresses her disappointment at the reluctance of the US and the USSR to disarm. Myrdal participated in the creation of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, becoming the first Chairman of the governing board in 1966. In 1967 she was also named consultative Cabinet minister for disarmament, an office she held until 1973. Myrdal also wrote the acclaimed book The Game of Disarmament, originally published in 1976. A vocal supporter of disarmament, Myrdal received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1982 together with Alfonso Garcia Robles. In 1983 Myrdal effectively ended the heated controversy over the future of Adolf Fredrik's Music School, \\"The AF-fight\\" (Swedish: AF-striden). Myrdal promoted reforms in child care and later became a government commission on women's work and chair of the Federation of Business and Professional Women.Myrdal, Alva. (2016).

A compiler produces object code which is usually in machine language, but may also be in an intermediate language which is at a lower level than the source.

He first appeared in \\"Homer's Odyssey\\", although his voice could be heard in the series premiere \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\". He is the consummate executive and personal assistant of Springfield Nuclear Power Plant's owner Mr. Burns, and is usually treated unfairly. Smithers' loyalty and devotion to Mr. Burns was inspired from how numerous Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. Smithers' first name (Waylon) was derived from that of puppeteer Wayland Flowers. The idea for Smithers' ambiguous sexual orientation came from Sam Simon. He proposed that Smithers should be gay and have an undying love for Mr. Burns. Smithers was colorized in his first appearance as black with blue hair. Matt Groening, in an interview with TMZ, said that this was a mistake but the producers didn't have enough money to correct it. Smithers is the loyal, obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns, and the relationship between the two is a frequent running gag. In many ways, Smithers represents the stereotype of a closeted gay man. Numerous allusions and double entendres about his homosexuality are made, though some of the show's producers instead interpret him as a \\"Burns-sexual\\". In the season 27 (2016) episode \\"The Burns Cage\\", he came out as gay.  Role in The Simpsons  Smithers is Mr. Burns' devoted executive assistant. His father, Waylon Smithers, Sr., worked for Burns until he died of radiation poisoning after saving Springfield from a potential nuclear meltdown when Smithers was a baby. Smithers began thinking of Mr. Burns as his commander shortly after his birth. Up until 2016, he was not openly gay, but most people knew he was homosexual before he came out. It was revealed in a flashback that he was married to a woman once, but the two split up when Mr. Burns came between them. Smithers is shown to have a passionate and deep love for Mr. Burns, and his sexual orientation has been characterized by the writers of the show as \\"Burns- sexual\\". Despite the eccentric love for his boss, Smithers appears to be one of the few people at the power plant who is seemingly competent at their job (or 2,800 smaller jobs in Smithers' case) as opposed to the lazy, oafish underlings such as Homer Simpson and the senile Mr. Burns, who is often out of touch with the modern times. Mr. Burns remained largely ignorant of Smithers' devoted adoration, much to Smithers' frustration. Mr. Burns himself has been involved with several women and, in \\"A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love\\", Smithers is noticeably disgusted when Mr. Burns starts looking for a female companion. Burns, for his part, views Smithers as somewhat of a lackey, albeit a highly valued one for his competence. He has \\"rewarded\\" Smithers' devotion with the future \\"honor\\" of being buried alive with him after he dies. Smithers has been shown to be somewhat dependent on his relationship with Burns. In \\"Homer the Smithers\\", Mr. Burns orders Smithers to take a vacation and Homer Simpson is hired as a temporary replacement. When Homer loses his temper and punches Mr. Burns in the face, Mr. Burns learns to become self-reliant and this results in Smithers being fired. Smithers decides that he needs to be Mr. Burns' assistant and eventually gets his job back. In the season 27 episode \\"The Burns Cage\\", Smithers attempts to admit his love to Burns, who interrupts to reaffirm his contempt for his assistant. Smithers' official job at the power plant appears to be that of executive assistant, which he says is \\"actually about 2,800 smaller jobs\\" responsible for monitoring employee attendance, and is often a disciplinarian and has won dozens of employee of the month awards. He has often hinted at wanting to be promoted to the position of executive vice president, but Burns has repeatedly squashed this dream, while whimsically bestowing the vice presidency on a dog. Smithers has the largest collection of Malibu Stacy dolls in the world, and is the president of the Malibu Stacy fan club.  Character  Smithers' initial (and only) appearance with a dark complexion, as seen in \\"Homer's Odyssey\\" Smithers was partly based on how numerous Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' orientation was pitched by Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but the writers should never draw too much attention to it and should try to keep it in the back of their heads. Jay Kogen said \\"Originally he was gay and black...But we thought it was too much so we just kept him gay.\\" The script for \\"Blood Feud\\" originally featured Smithers saying \\"Just leave me enough to get home to my wife and kids\\", but the line had to be cut for time. Smithers is voiced by Harry Shearer, who is also the voice of Mr. Burns. Shearer is often able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Dan Castellaneta occasionally fills in for Shearer at table reads and voices Smithers. The name Waylon, coined by Mike Reiss, was first used in \\"I Married Marge\\" and comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers. Smithers made his first appearance in \\"Homer's Odyssey\\", which was the third episode of the first season, although he can be heard over a speaker in The Simpsons series premiere \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\".Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire BBC. Retrieved March 2, 2007 In his first visual appearance in \\"Homer's Odyssey\\", Smithers was mistakenly animated with the wrong color and was made darker than most characters by Gyorgyi Peluce, the color stylist. David Silverman has claimed that Smithers was always intended to be \\"Mr Burns' white sycophant\\", and the staff thought it \\"would be a bad idea to have a black subservient character\\" and so switched him to his intended color for his next episode. Silverman retconned this error by saying that Smithers had a tan from a recent holiday in the Caribbean. The first appearance of a yellow Smithers was \\"There's No Disgrace Like Home\\", the fourth episode of the first season.  Development  Smithers' relationship with Mr. Burns has long been a running gag on The Simpsons. Smithers is an obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns. There have often been strong hints about Smithers' true feelings for his boss, with one of the earliest references being in the season one episode \\"The Telltale Head\\". Smithers' sexual orientation has often come into question, with some fans claiming he is a \\"Burns-sexual\\" and only attracted to his boss, while others maintain that he is gay. During the Bill Oakley/Josh Weinstein era, they still tried to keep his sexuality unspoken and there was debate among the writers about his orientation. Al Jean, who thinks of Smithers as being a \\"Burns-sexual\\", felt that had Mr. Burns been a woman, then Smithers would not be gay. David Silverman, a former supervising director has said, \\"[Smithers] seems to be focused on one particular human, as opposed to anything beyond that. [Rather than being gay], he's sort of 'Burns- sexual.'\\" In a 2006 study conducted by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, it was determined that nine of the 679 lead and supporting characters on scripted broadcast television were gay or lesbian, but Smithers was not included. A list published in 2008 by the same organization included Smithers; Patty Bouvier, Marge Simpson's lesbian sister, was included on both lists. Smithers dreams about Mr. Burns in \\"Marge Gets a Job\\". The censors had issues with the \\"lump in his bed\\", which was his knee. The debate is referenced in \\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\\", when the episode host, Troy McClure is answering viewer questions, and one that is asked is \\"What is the real deal with Mr. Burns' assistant Smithers? You know what I'm talking about.\\" A montage of various clips that shows Smithers' lust for Mr. Burns follows, and in the end, McClure says \\"as you can see, the real deal with Waylon Smithers is that he's Mr. Burns' assistant. He's in his early forties, is unmarried, and currently resides in Springfield. Thanks for writing!\\" Several of the allusions to Smithers' sexuality have turned into battles with the network censors. For example, in Smithers' fantasy of a naked Mr. Burns popping out of a birthday cake in \\"Rosebud\\", the censors had not wanted Mr. Burns to be naked. Another example is \\"Marge Gets a Job\\", which has a dream sequence where Smithers is sleeping and Burns flies through a window. The sequence shows Burns flying towards him and Smithers looking happy, but originally it went on for a few seconds longer. It had to be trimmed down due to scenes that showed \\"Mr. Burns land[ing] in a particular position on Smithers' anatomy\\". There were also issues with \\"the lump in his bed\\", which the animators said had been drawn as his knee, but the censors had misinterpreted. In the second season, the writers started to enjoy writing about Smithers and Burns' relationship, and the writers often pitched episodes with them as the focus, but many never came to fruition. Mostly in the early seasons, Smithers had a catchphrase, which comes from a recurring joke that Mr. Burns never remembers who Homer Simpson is. Smithers and Burns would watch Homer (usually over a security camera feed) and Burns would ask, \\"Who is that man?\\", to which Smithers would reply, \\"That's Homer Simpson, sir, one of your [drones, organ banks, carbon blobs, etc.] from sector 7G.\\" Burns would invariably respond, \\"Simpson, eh?\\" In September 2015, it was confirmed by Jean that Smithers would come out to Mr. Burns in a season 27 episode. The episode, \\"The Burns Cage\\", was broadcast the following April and saw Smithers unsuccessfully try to move on from Burns. A writer for British progressive magazine the New Statesman felt that the episode was a retcon, making a serious story about the character's homosexuality instead of the previous jokes and innuendo that became the target of homophobia.  Reception  Smithers' voice actor Harry Shearer In 2004, The Simpsons producers announced that one of their characters was going to come out of the closet. Speculation on who it would be was printed in newspapers throughout the United States and Canada (even claiming Smithers' \\"sexual orientation was about the worst-kept secret in Springfield\\") as well as in Australia, New Zealand,\\"Simpsons in gay outing\\". The Press (Christchurch, New Zealand), February 15, 2005. Ireland, (the Irish Independent called Smithers \\"too obvious\\" a choice),\\"Waylon Smithers\\". Irish Independent: August 7, 2004. Retrieved October 26, 2007. and the United Kingdom. Despite Matt Groening joking that it would be Homer, the Boston Herald calculated the odds of several characters being gay, with Smithers at a million to one. PlanetOut Inc. hosted an online poll in the weeks prior to the episode to determine based on \\"cartoon gaydar\\" who was gay on the Simpsons, with 97% of the respondents choosing Smithers. Jenny Stewart, the entertainment editor at the site said of the poll, \\"We've never had such an avalanche of people voting in any of our polls as we did on The Simpsons.\\" It was Patty Bouvier who came out. In a 2007 article, Entertainment Weekly named Smithers the 16th-greatest sidekick of all time. They have also described Smithers and Mr. Burns as being \\"TV's most functional dysfunctional couple\\". Star News Online named \\"Smithers' fey way\\" as one of the 400 reasons why they loved The Simpsons. In a 2003 article, Entertainment Weekly named the two-part episode \\"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\\", in which Smithers was prominently featured, the series' 25th-best episode. Gay.com ranked Smithers as the sixth- gayest cartoon character.  Merchandise  Smithers was made into an action figure, and four different versions were included as part of the World of Springfield toy line. The first shows Smithers in his normal attire with a picture of Mr. Burns at his feet and was released in 2000 as part of \\"wave two\\". The second, released in 2002 as part of \\"wave ten\\", is called \\"resort Smithers\\" and shows him dressed as he was at the resort in the episode \\"Homer the Smithers\\". In 2003, a series of figures exclusive to Electronics Boutique was released, and a set of one Mr. Burns figure and two different Smithers toys based on the episode \\"Rosebud\\" were included. One, called \\"Bobo Smithers\\" shows Smithers dressed as Mr. Burns' teddy bear Bobo; and the other, known as \\"future Smithers\\", shows him as a robotic dog. A \\"future Burns\\" was included in the set as a companion to \\"future Smithers\\" and depicts Burns as a robot as he appeared at the end of the episode.

Born in the Montmartre quarter of Paris, France, Utrillo is one of the few famous painters of Montmartre who were born there. Biography Suzanne Valadon, Portrait of Maurice Utrillo, 1921 Utrillo was the son of the artist Suzanne Valadon (born Marie-Cl√©mentine Valadon), who was then an eighteen-year-old artist's model. She never revealed who was the father of her child; speculation exists that he was the offspring from a liaison with an equally young amateur painter named Boissy, or with the well-established painter Pierre-C√©cile Puvis de Chavannes, or even with Renoir. (see below under Utrillo's Paternity). In 1891 a Spanish artist, Miguel Utrillo y Molins, signed a legal document acknowledging paternity, although the question remains as to whether he was in fact the child's father.Warnod 1981, p.48. Valadon, who became a model after a fall from a trapeze ended her chosen career as a circus acrobat,Warnod 1981, p.13. found that posing for Berthe Morisot, Renoir, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and others provided her with an opportunity to study their techniques. She taught herself to paint, and when Toulouse-Lautrec introduced her to Edgar Degas, he became her mentor. Eventually, she became a peer of the artists she had posed for. Meanwhile, her mother was left to raise the young Maurice, who soon showed a troubling inclination toward truancy and alcoholism.Warnod 1981, pp.57‚Äì59. When a mental illness took hold of the 21-year-old Utrillo in 1904, his mother encouraged him to take up painting. He soon showed real artistic talent. With no training beyond what his mother taught him, he drew and painted what he saw in Montmartre. After 1910 his work attracted critical attention, and by 1920 he was internationally acclaimed. In 1928, the French government awarded him the Cross of the L√©gion d'honneur.Warnod 1981, p.85. Throughout his life, however, he was interned in mental asylums repeatedly. Tomb of Utrillo, Cemetery Saint Vincent, Paris Today, tourists to the area will find many of his paintings on postcards, one of which is his very popular 1936 painting entitled Montmartre Street Corner or Lapin Agile. In middle age Utrillo became fervently religious and in 1935, at the age of fifty-two, he married Lucie Valore and moved to Le V√©sinet, just outside Paris. By that time, he was too ill to work in the open air and painted landscapes viewed from windows, from postcards, and from memory. Although his life also was plagued by alcoholism, he lived into his seventies. Maurice Utrillo died on 5 November 1955 in Hotel Splendid in Dax of a lung disease, and was buried in the Cimeti√®re Saint-Vincent in Montmartre. Paternity An apocryphal anecdote told by Diego Rivera concerning Utrillo's paternity is related in the unpublished memoirs of one of his American collectors, Ruth Bakwin: > \\"After Maurice was born to Suzanne Valadon, she went to Renoir, for whom she > had modeled nine months previously.

Influences on Canadian writers are broad, both geographically and historically, representing Canada's diversity in culture and region. While mostly written in English, \\"Indigenous literature\\" has begun to flourish and is based upon many distinct oral traditions, languages, and cultural practices. However, Canadians have been less willing to acknowledge the diverse languages of Canada, such as Canadian Gaelic. The dominant European cultures were originally English, French, and Gaelic. However, in recent decades Canada's literature has been strongly influenced by immigrants from other countries. Since the 1980s Canada's ethnic and cultural diversity has been openly reflected in its literature, with many of its most prominent writers focusing on ethnic minority identity, duality and cultural differences. Indigenous literature Indigenous peoples of Canada are culturally diverse. Each group has its own literature, language and culture. The term \\"Indigenous literature\\" therefore can be misleading. As writer Jeannette Armstrong states in one interview, \\"I would stay away from the idea of \\"Native\\" literature, there is no such thing. There is Mohawk literature, there is Okanagan literature, but there is no generic Native in Canada\\". French-Canadian literature In 1802, the Lower Canada legislative library was founded, being one of the first in Occident, the first in the Canadas. For comparison, the library of the British House of Commons was founded sixteen years later. The library had some rare titles about geography, natural science and letters. All books it contained were moved to the Canadian parliament in Montreal when the two Canadas, lower and upper, were united. On April 25, 1849, a dramatic event occurred: the Canadian parliament was burned by furious people along with thousands of French Canadian books and a few hundred of English books. This is why some people still affirm today, falsely, that from the early settlements until the 1820s, Quebec had virtually no literature. Though historians, journalists, and learned priests published, overall the total output that remain from this period and that had been kept out of the burned parliament is small. It was the rise of Quebec patriotism and the 1837 Lower Canada Rebellion, in addition to a modern system of primary school education, which led to the rise of French-Canadian fiction. L'influence d'un livre by Philippe-Ignace-Francois Aubert de Gasp√© is widely regarded as the first French-Canadian novel. The genres which first became popular were the rural novel and the historical novel. French authors were influential, especially authors like Balzac. Gabrielle Roy was a notable French Canadian author. In 1866, Father Henri-Raymond Casgrain became one of Quebec's first literary theorists. He argued that literature's goal should be to project an image of proper Catholic morality. However, a few authors like Louis-Honor√© Fr√©chette and Arthur Buies broke the conventions to write more interesting works. This pattern continued until the 1930s with a new group of authors educated at the Universit√© Laval and the Universit√© de Montr√©al. Novels with psychological and sociological foundations became the norm. Gabrielle Roy and Anne H√©bert even began to earn international acclaim, which had not happened to French-Canadian literature before. During this period, Quebec theatre, which had previously been melodramas and comedies, became far more involved. French-Canadian literature began to greatly expand with the turmoil of the Second World War, the beginnings of industrialization in the 1950s, and most especially the Quiet Revolution in the 1960s. French-Canadian literature also began to attract a great deal of attention globally, with Acadian novelist Antonine Maillet winning the Prix Goncourt. An experimental branch of Qu√©b√©cois literature also developed; for instance the poet Nicole Brossard wrote in a formalist style. In 1979, Roch Carrier wrote the story The Hockey Sweater, which highlighted the cultural and social tensions between English and French speaking Canada. Before Confederation Because Canada only officially became a country on July 1, 1867, it has been argued that literature written before this time was colonial. For example, Susanna Moodie and Catharine Parr Traill, English sisters who adopted the country as their own, moved to Upper Canada in 1832. They recorded their experiences as pioneers in Parr Traill's The Backwoods of Canada (1836) and Canadian Crusoes (1852), and Moodie's Roughing It in the Bush (1852) and Life in the Clearings (1853). However, both women wrote until their deaths, placing them in the country for more than 50 years and certainly well past Confederation. Moreover, their books often dealt with survival and the rugged Canadian environment; these themes re-appear in other Canadian works, including Margaret Atwood's Survival. Moodie and Parr Traill's sister, Agnes Strickland, remained in England and wrote elegant royal biographies, creating a stark contrast between Canadian and English literatures. However, one of the earliest \\"Canadian\\" writers virtually always included in Canadian literary anthologies is Thomas Chandler Haliburton (1796-1865), who died just two years before Canada's official birth. He is remembered for his comic character, Sam Slick, who appeared in The Clockmaker and other humorous works throughout Haliburton's life. After 1867 Charles G. D. Roberts was a poet that belonged to an informal group known as the Confederation Poets. A group of poets now known as the \\"Confederation Poets\\", including Charles G. D. Roberts, Archibald Lampman, Bliss Carman, Duncan Campbell Scott, and William Wilfred Campbell, came to prominence in the 1880s and 1890s. Choosing the world of nature as their inspiration, their work was drawn from their own experiences and, at its best, written in their own tones. Isabella Valancy Crawford, Frederick George Scott, and Francis Sherman are also sometimes associated with this group. During this period, E. Pauline Johnson and William Henry Drummond were writing popular poetry - Johnson's based on her part-Mohawk heritage, and Drummond, the Poet of the Habitant, writing dialect verse. The L. M. Montgomery novel Anne of Green Gables was first published in 1908. It has sold an estimated 50 million copies and is one of the best selling books worldwide.Reuters on Anne of Green Gables: \\"\\"Anne of Green Gables\\" has sold more than 50 million copies and been translated into 20 languages, according to Penguin.\\" (19 March 2008) Reacting against a tradition that emphasised the wilderness, poet Leonard Cohen's novel Beautiful Losers (1966), was labelled by one reviewer \\"the most revolting book ever written in Canada\\".Who held a gun to Leonard Cohen's head? Tim de Lisle, Guardian Online, retrieved 11 October 2006. However, Cohen is perhaps best known as a folk singer and songwriter, with an international following. Canadian author Farley Mowat is best known for his work Never Cry Wolf (1963) and his Governor General's Award-winning children's book, Lost in the Barrens (1956). Following World War II, writers such as Mavis Gallant, Mordecai Richler, Norman Levine, Margaret Laurence and Irving Layton added to the Modernist influence to Canadian literature previously introduced by F. R. Scott, A. J. M. Smith and others associated with the McGill Fortnightly. This influence, at first, was not broadly appreciated. Norman Levine's Canada Made Me, a travelogue that presented a sour interpretation of the country in 1958, for example, was widely rejected. After 1967, the country's centennial year, the national government increased funding to publishers and numerous small presses began operating throughout the country. The best-known Canadian children's writers include L. M. Montgomery and Monica Hughes. Contemporary Canadian literature: After 1967 Arguably, the best-known living Canadian writer internationally (especially since the deaths of Robertson Davies and Mordecai Richler) is Margaret Atwood, a prolific novelist, poet, and literary critic. Some great 20th-century Canadian authors include Margaret Laurence, and Gabrielle Roy. Short story writer Alice Munro won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013. This group, along with Nobel Laureate Alice Munro, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English,\\"For a long time Alice Munro has been compared with Chekhov; John Updike would add Tolstoy, and AS Byatt would say Guy de Maupassant and Flaubert. Munro is often called the best living writer of short stories in English; the words \\"short story\\" are frequently dropped.\\" Riches of a Double Life, Ada Edemariam, Guardian Online, retrieved 11 October 2006. were the first to elevate Canadian Literature to the world stage. During the post-war decades only a handful of books of any literary merit were published each year in Canada, and Canadian literature was viewed as an appendage to British and American writing. When academic Clara Thomas decided in the 1940s to concentrate on Canadian literature for her master's thesis, the idea was so novel and so radical that word of her decision reached The Globe and Mail books editor William Arthur Deacon, who then personally reached out to Thomas to pledge his and the newspaper's resources in support of her work.\\"Author and educator Clara Thomas was a relentless advocate of CanLit\\". The Globe and Mail, November 28, 2013. Other major Canadian novelists include Carol Shields, Lawrence Hill, and Alice Munro. Carol Shields novel The Stone Diaries won the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and another novel, Larry's Party, won the Orange Prize in 1998. Lawrence Hill's Book of Negroes won the 2008 Commonwealth Writers' Prize Overall Best Book Award, while Alice Munro became the first Canadian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013. Munro also received the Man Booker International Prize in 2009. In the 1960s, a renewed sense of nation helped foster new voices in Canadian poetry, including: Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje, Leonard Cohen, Eli Mandel and Margaret Avison. Others such as Al Purdy, Milton Acorn, and Earle Birney, already published, produced some of their best work during this period. The TISH Poetry movement in Vancouver brought about poetic innovation from Jamie Reid, George Bowering, Fred Wah, Frank Davey, Daphne Marlatt, David Cull, and Lionel Kearns. The former Canadian Parliamentary Poet Laureate George Elliott Clarke (2015) Canadian poets has been expanding the boundaries of originality: Christian B√∂k, Ken Babstock, Karen Solie, Lynn Crosbie, Patrick Lane, George Elliott Clarke and Barry Dempster have all imprinted their unique consciousnesses onto the map of Canadian imagery. A notable anthology of Canadian poetry is The New Oxford book of Canadian Verse, edited by Margaret Atwood (). Anne Carson is probably the best known Canadian poet living today. Carson in 1996 won the Lannan Literary Award for poetry. The foundation's awards in 2006 for poetry, fiction and nonfiction each came with $US 150,000. =Canadian authors who have won international awards= Nobel Prize in Literature * Alice Munro (2013) Man Booker International Prize * Alice Munro (2009) Man Booker Prize * Michael Ondaatje, The English Patient (1992) * Margaret Atwood, The Blind Assassin (2000) * Yann Martel, Life of Pi (2002) * Margaret Atwood, The Testaments (2019) Pulitzer Prize for Fiction * Carol Shields, The Stone Diaries (1995) National Book Critics Circle Award * Carol Shields, The Stone Diaries (1994) International Dublin Literary Award * Alistair MacLeod, No Great Mischief (2001) * Rawi Hage, De Niro's Game (2008) Orange Prize * Anne Michaels, Fugitive Pieces (1997) * Carol Shields, Larry's Party (1998) Commonwealth Writers' Prize * Olive Senior, Summer Lightning (1987) * Mordecai Richler, Solomon Gursky Was Here (1990) * Rohinton Mistry, Such a Long Journey (1991) * Rohinton Mistry, A Fine Balance (1996) * Austin Clarke, The Polished Hoe (2003) * Lawrence Hill, The Book of Negroes (2008) Peace Prize of the German Book Trade * Margaret Atwood (2017) Awards There are a number of notable Canadian awards for literature: * The Atlantic Writers Competition highlights talent across the Atlantic Provinces. * Books in Canada First Novel Award for the best first novel of the year * Canadian Authors Association Awards for Adult Literature, honouring works by Canadian writers that achieve excellence without sacrificing popular appeal since 1975 * CBC Literary Awards * Canada Council Molson Prize for distinguished contributions to Canada's cultural and intellectual heritage * Danuta Gleed Literary Award for a first collection of short fiction by a Canadian author writing in English * Dayne Ogilvie Prize for an emerging writer in the lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender communities * Doug Wright Awards for graphic literature and novels * Floyd S.

She was a 4th grade teacher, who taught Bart Simpson's class at Springfield Elementary School. In the twenty-third season, she married Ned Flanders, the widower of Maude Flanders, helping raise Rod and Todd Flanders until her death. Edna is the only character that Wallace voiced on a regular basis. Following the actress's death, the show's producers announced their intention to retire the character. Edna Krabappel's final speaking role was the epilogue of the 25th season episode \\"The Man Who Grew Too Much\\". Profile Edna Krabappel holds a Master's from Bryn Mawr College. She is a surly, grumpy and jaded caricature of the American public school system. In \\"The Seemingly Never-Ending Story\\", it is revealed that she was once a very optimistic woman who genuinely wanted to help people in need. It would seem that after years of frustration thanks to the school, and Bart Simpson in particular, this wore away. There is some inconsistency about Edna's origins. She is said to have come to Springfield to begin teaching in \\"The Seemingly Never-Ending Story\\". However, in a case of retconning, she can be seen in \\"Springfield Up\\" as a student running through the background at Springfield High School while a young Chief Wiggum is filmed carrying out his duties as a hall monitor as part of the documentary featured in that episode. Edna smokes heavily, including during school hours. In the episode \\"Grade School Confidential\\", she and Principal Skinner have a romance after they are invited to Martin Prince's party. They are witnessed kissing in Martin's playhouse by Bart. Principal Skinner then sends Bart to relay a message to Edna in front of his classmates who laugh at him, making him furious. He then shows them what they are doing and tells them not to tell anyone about their relationship, especially Superintendent Chalmers. Unknown to Bart they lose their jobs when Superintendent Chalmers finds out about their affair via Chief Wiggum and they lock themselves in the school with Bart until they are reinstated. They apologize to Bart for embarrassing him. After returning to their jobs, they resume their romance in a janitorial closet. In \\"Bart Gets a 'Z'\\", she is fired from teaching when she becomes drunk after drinking coffee that was spiked with alcohol by Bart. She later decides to open a muffin store. She is later rehired when the substitute teacher gets drunk. In \\"Moms I'd Like to Forget\\", she fights a fifth grade teacher, Mike, who talks badly about her students; this leads to a massive teacher brawl. In \\"The Ned-Liest Catch\\", she is suspended from teaching for slapping Bart and is placed in the Teacher Holding Facility. When Bart attempts to free her, she falls off a ladder but is saved by Ned Flanders. Love life A recurring theme is Edna's desire for a romantic partner. She is divorced; in \\"Separate Vocations\\", she implies that her husband left her for their marriage counselor with whom he had an affair. In early episodes, she is shown as very sexually aggressive and promiscuous: in \\"Flaming Moe's\\", she is shown with her arms around two sailors in the parody of the famous Cheers theme, and tries to pick up Aerosmith drummer Joey Kramer and Homer Simpson, even after learning he is married and is Bart's father. In \\"Bart's Friend Falls in Love\\", while the children are watching an unseen explicit scene in Fuzzy Bunny's Guide to You-Know-What, a sex ed film, she says to the children in disgust, \\"She's faking it\\". In the same episode, Nelson Muntz asks why she does not live with \\"Mr. Krabappel\\", she tells him that her ex-husband \\"chased something small and fluffy down the rabbit hole\\". In \\"One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish\\", she has a \\"hot encounter\\" with a local Japanese sushi chef in the backseat of her car. The episode \\"Bart the Lover\\" was the first episode to give Edna a central role, and also to expand her character and personality. Edna appears to be desired by many men (and in one case even women, when Patty Bouvier once had a sexual fantasy with Edna), as seen in Sideshow Bob's outrage (in \\"Brother from Another Series\\") wherein his romantic date with her is ruined by a spying Bart: \\"You only get one chance with Edna Krabappel!\\" Another theme is her relationship with the school principal, Seymour Skinner. In the episode \\"Grade School Confidential\\", she develops a secret romance with Skinner, a relationship that almost leads to marriage. In the episode \\"Special Edna\\", Skinner proposes to Edna, to which she agrees. However, in the episode \\"My Big Fat Geek Wedding\\", Edna leaves Skinner at the altar after realizing that he doesn't want to marry her. Since then, Edna's attitudes to Skinner have vacillated between passion and disdain in various episodes. In The Simpsons Movie, she can be seen at the Green Day concert on top of Seymour's shoulders wearing a T-shirt saying \\"Not my boyfriend\\" with an arrow pointing down at Skinner. In season 17 (\\"The Seemingly Never-Ending Story\\"), a flashback showed that Edna was in a serious relationship with Moe Szyslak when she first moved to Springfield, before meeting Skinner or even becoming a teacher. She was about to elope with him, but then changed her mind when she met Bart Simpson, a student she believed needed help. Consequently, Moe breaks up with her. At the end of the episode, Moe and Edna are a couple once again, much to Skinner's jealousy when he catches them making out on school property. In \\"Regarding Margie\\", she and Principal Skinner are seen making love on a golf course. Then he climbs off and she says, \\"Birthday is over, Seymour\\", and lights up a cigarette. Edna is in a relationship with Ned Flanders. During the 22nd episode of the 22nd season, \\"The Ned-Liest Catch\\", Ned and Edna began dating (Though the two have dated previously in the episode \\"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\\"). The fate of the couple was left to a fan vote, to be revealed during the 23rd season opener. When \\"The Falcon and the D'ohman\\" debuted, it revealed that the fans voted in favor of the relationship. At the close of the episode, a disclaimer appeared on screen which stated ‚Äì \\"What our fans have joined together, let no writer rip asunder\\". It is also revealed in \\"The Ned-Liest Catch\\" that she has \\"dated\\" in addition to Skinner, Moe Szyslak, Lenny, Carl, Comic Book Guy, Joey Kramer, Krusty the Clown, Cletus Spuckler, and several others. It is revealed in the episode \\"Ned 'n Edna's Blend\\" that Edna and Ned married in secret (although she continues to use her first married name, Krabappel, as a teacher), and the town throws them a proper reception. In the episode \\"Left Behind\\", Ned took a teaching job as a way to honor Edna's memory after she dies. In the 30th season episode, \\"My Way or the Highway to Heaven\\", Edna is seen in heaven next to George Washington while Maude Flanders is seen next to Abraham Lincoln. Character Marcia Wallace, the voice of Edna Krabappel Krabappel's name was chosen by early Simpsons writers Wallace Wolodarsky and Jay Kogen as a play on the fruit \\"crabapple\\" and as a reference to the teacher Miss Crabtree from the 1930s Our Gang shorts.Groening, Matt; Wolodarsky, Wallace (2001). Commentary for the episode \\"Homer's Odyssey\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Also, there was an initial joke of no one mispronouncing the character's last name as \\"Crabapple\\" until Milhouse uses it in a later episode, stunning the other children. The real Seymour Skinner also mispronounced her name. In one episode, Homer is horrified to learn that no one has corrected him for calling her \\"Crandall\\". Like many characters, Ms. Krabappel has a memorable catchphrase, used often in the series: her derisive laugh (\\"HA!\\"). =Retirement= Marcia Wallace died on October 25, 2013; according to her son, the cause of death was related to pneumonia. Staff on The Simpsons had reportedly been aware of her illness. Showrunner Al Jean said, \\"I was tremendously saddened to learn this morning of the passing of the brilliant and gracious Marcia Wallace.\\" He also announced that the show would retire the character. The series first acknowledged Wallace's passing in the episode \\"Four Regrettings and a Funeral\\", in which the chalkboard gag in the opening sequence was changed to read a single \\"We'll really miss you Mrs. K\\". The episode \\"The Man Who Grew Too Much\\" later showed Ned Flanders wearing a black armband and mourning Edna, whose portrait joined that of Maude, Ned's first wife. The episode was the 13th of the 25th season, a nod to the day and year of Wallace's death. In \\"Moho House\\" she appears as a ghost with Maude when Marge looks at everyone enjoying their spouses. The cause of Edna‚Äôs demise within the show itself has never been revealed. Cultural impact and reception Marcia Wallace won an Emmy Award in 1992 for voicing Krabappel in the third season-episode \\"Bart the Lover\\". IGN called \\"Special Edna\\" the best episode of the fourteenth season of the show. Tilda Swinton modeled her hairdo in the film Burn After Reading on Krabappel's.

Danjon devised a method to measure \\"earthshine\\" on the Moon using a telescope in which a prism split the Moon's image into two identical side-by-side images. By adjusting a diaphragm to dim one of the images until the sunlit portion had the same apparent brightness as the earthlit portion on the unadjusted image, he could quantify the diaphragm adjustment, and thus had a real measurement for the brightness of earthshine. He recorded the measurements using his method (now known as the Danjon scale, on which zero equates to a barely visible Moon) from 1925 until the 1950s. Among his notable contributions to astronomy was the design of the impersonal (prismatic) astrolabe now known as the Danjon astrolabe, which led to an improvement in the accuracy of fundamental optical astrometry. An account of this instrument, and of the results of some early years of its operation, are given in Danjon's 1958 George Darwin Lecture to the Royal Astronomical Society. He also developed the \\"Danjon limit\\", a proposed measure of the minimum angular separation between the Sun and the Moon at which a lunar crescent is visible. However, this limit may not exist.

The non-conducting spigot of the original 605 plug was provided with a hole for a countersunk screw, allowing the plug to be fixed in a wall-mounted socket. Removal then required first removing the socket cover, to allow this retaining screw to be removed. In this way a semi-permanent connection, requiring tools for disconnection, could be achieved. =610 socket= Standard six conductor. The original 610 socket was provided with two mounting holes, one behind the receptacle for the plug spigot, and both for countersunk screws. This arrangement allowed the socket to be secured using two screws, with no plug inserted, or alternatively with the plug inserted, using the same two mounting holes but with one of the screws passing through the spigot to secure the plug as well. =611 socket= Similar to 610, but with the contacts of pairs one and two allowed to connect when no plug is inserted, contact 1 connecting to 2 and 5 to 6. This is particularly designed for mode 3 connection. The incoming line to the mode 3 device is connected using pair one, and pair two is used as the outgoing line to other devices. If the mode 3 device is unplugged, the switch contacts maintain line connection to the other devices. This function is not generally supported by modular connectors. Modular connectors providing suitable switch contacts are available but not common; Instead, mode 3 devices use two modular connectors, one for the incoming line and the other for the outgoing line. The convenience of using a single connector in this application is one reason for the continued use of 600 series connectors, but mixing this wiring scheme with modular connectors does not work well. For example, if a modern modem with its supplied 6P2C adaptor is plugged into a conventionally wired 611 mode 3 socket, the result is to disconnect all downstream devices. In some sockets conductors 3 and 4 also connect when no plug is present, shorting pair three. Sockets are also available with cams to allow the switching functions to be selectively enabled as required. In some older sockets this could be achieved by simply bending the contacts; The cams merely implement this useful accidental feature in an intentional fashion. Many recent 611 sockets have a stepped recess for the plug spigot, to accept a plug with a larger spigot but still provide a good fit for a standard 605 plug. Equipment requiring mode 3 connection can then be equipped with these larger spigot plugs, to prevent this equipment being connected to a 610 socket which does not provide mode 3 support. These plugs are common on older fax machines and modems, and used on some security and similar equipment. These plugs were also used on Telex machines within Australia. =Other varieties= 60x plugs In general, 60x where x is any numeric other than 0 or 5 indicates a non-standard plug. Compatibility and designs vary from maker to maker. 61x sockets In general, 61x where x is any numeric other than 0 or 1 indicates a non-standard socket. Compatibility and designs vary from maker to maker. Extensions Extension leads are generally four conductor, including pair one and one other pair, wired straight through pin to pin. Some incorporate an adaptor plug which includes a 610 socket, often with all six conductors connected, allowing the extension to also serve as a double adaptor. Double adaptors Double adaptors are almost always six conductor, wired pin to pin, with a 605 plug and two 610 sockets in parallel. Mode 3 adaptors A mode 3 adaptor appears physically to be a double adaptor, but the sockets are one 610 and one 611, with pair one of the 610 wired to pair two of the 611, and pair one of the 611 to pair one of the plug. Treatment of the other conductors varies, and may be assignable. Standard pinout The conductors are numbered 1‚Äì6 from the end further from the spigot. The contact terminals are normally labelled with their numbers on rewireable plugs and sockets. # Pair 2 ring (black) # Pair 1 tip (white) # Pair 3 ring (green) # Pair 3 tip (orange) # Pair 2 tip (red) # Pair 1 ring (blue) Use of pair one is almost always to standard, but pairs two and three may not be present, or the conductors may be used for other purposes. Pair two is often used for local power supply or other proprietary purposes. Adaptors to modular connectors may connect only pair one, or pairs one and two, or all six conductors. Modems and other equipment supplied in Australia are nowadays normally provided with a modular plug, and an adaptor which connects only pair one, allowing the modular plug to be used with a 610 or 611 socket in need. The pin carrying pair three is often missing completely from the plugs of these adaptors. =Legacy colour codes= Legacy installations and equipment most often use either: * Pairs one and two, connected using four core cable with blue, white, red and black conductors, either solid conductors as two unshielded twisted pairs or flexible untwisted four conductor cable. * Pair one only, connected using two conductor cable with one white and one blue conductor, either as solid core UTP or flexible two core cable. Wiring detail and explanation In the early 1980s Telecom Australia would install multiple phone sockets in premises as requested, but charged a rental fee per socket, to cover installation and maintenance. In this era the ringing tone was generated by electro-mechanical bells in each phone and with pulse dialling then in use, the 6xx series plugs and sockets supported separation of the bell circuit. This was to avoid a bell tinkling noise during dialling, from any on-hook phones in the circuit. The standard multi-extension wiring in residential premises thus used 3 wires of the 4 wire cable. White was wired to pins 2 and 3 which were bridged by a link in each socket. Red (bell circuit) was connect to pin 5 and blue was connected to pin 6. The black wire was unused and left unconnected in the socket. Electro-mechanical phones such as the 800 series had their internal wiring slightly adjusted to support such multiple extension use. When phones moved to electronic ringers and tone dialling, the additional socket wiring using pins 3 and 5 was no longer needed for suppression and the use of only pair one, with white on pin 2 and blue on pin 6 became the standard socket wiring, until being superseded by the modular connector. Modular adaptors All connection schemes connect pair one to the centre two connectors on the modular connector. =6P2C= This is the most common scheme, connecting only pair one: * 6P2C contact 3 to 600 contact 2 * 6P2C contact 4 to 600 contact 6 The pin carrying contacts 3 and 4 is generally completely absent from these adaptors, as are the contacts 1 and 5. Equipment such as handsets, modems and extension bells sold in or for use in Australia often arrives packaged with one of these adaptors. =6P4C= This is common in extension cables, many of which have built-in adaptors to 6P4C (and more rarely to 6P6C). There are several conflicting schemes, some using pair two in addition to one, others one and three. As most applications use only pair one, most users are unaware of the potential problem. Even if no modular connector is included in an extension cable, most 600 series extension cables are four conductor. Pair one is always connected, and either pair two or three. =6P6C= A common connection scheme is: * 6P6C contact 1 to 600 contact 5 (pair 2) * 6P6C contact 2 to 600 contact 3 (pair 3) * 6P6C contact 3 to 600 contact 2 (pair 1) * 6P6C contact 4 to 600 contact 6 (pair 1) * 6P6C contact 5 to 600 contact 4 (pair 3) * 6P6C contact 6 to 600 contact 1 (pair 2) References * External links Category:Telephone connectors Category:Telecommunications in Australia ","title":"600 series connector"},{"id":"64825","text":"6800 may refer to: ;Electronic technology * Motorola 6800, a microprocessor * Kodak Photo Printer 6800 * GeForce 6800, a series of graphics cards from Nvidia * Nokia 6800 series, mobile phones ;Other * GWR 6800 Class, a class of steam locomotives ","title":"6800"},{"id":"64844","text":"A hydrophone A hydrophone () is a microphone designed to be used underwater for recording or listening to underwater sound. Most hydrophones are based on a piezoelectric transducer that generates an electric potential when subjected to a pressure change, such as a sound wave. Some piezoelectric transducers can also serve as a sound projector, but not all have this capability, and some may be destroyed if used in such a manner. A hydrophone can detect airborne sounds, but will be insensitive because it is designed to match the acoustic impedance of water, a denser fluid than air. Sound travels 4.3 times faster in water than in air, and a sound wave in water exerts a pressure 60 times that exerted by a wave of the same amplitude in air. Similarly, a standard microphone can be buried in the ground, or immersed in water if it is put in a waterproof container, but will give poor performance due to the similarly bad acoustic impedance match. It is also considered a sensor. History A hydrophone being lowered into the North Atlantic The first hydrophones consisted of a tube with a thin membrane covering the submerged end and the observer's ear on the other end. The design of effective hydrophones must take into account the acoustic resistance of water, which is 3750 times that of air; hence the pressure exerted by a wave of the same intensity in air is increased by a factor of 3750 in water. The American Submarine Signaling Company developed a hydrophone to detect underwater bells rung from lighthouses and lightships. The case was a thick, hollow brass disc in diameter. On one face was a thick brass diaphragm which was coupled by a short brass rod to a carbon microphone. =World War I= Early in the war, French President Raymond Poincar√©, himself a physicist, provided Paul Langevin with the facilities needed to work on a method to locate submarines by the echos from sound pulses. They developed a piezoelectric hydrophone by increasing the power of the signal with a vacuum tube amplifier; the high acoustic impedance of piezoelectric materials facilitated their use as underwater transducers. The same piezoelectric plate could be vibrated by an electrical oscillator to produce the sound pulses.Van der Kloot, 2014, pp. 110-112. The first submarine to be detected and sunk using a primitive hydrophone was the German submarine UC-3 on 23 April 1916. UC-3 was detected by the anti-submarine trawler Cheerio as the Cheerio was directly over the UC-3, the UC-3 was then caught in a steel net dragged by the trawler, and sank after a large underwater explosion. Hydrophones and directional hydrophones using a baffle. Later in the war, the British Admiralty belatedly convened a scientific panel to advise on how to combat U-boats. It included the Australian physicist William Henry Bragg and the New Zealand physicist Sir Ernest Rutherford. They concluded that the best hope was to use hydrophones to listen for submarines. Rutherford's research produced his sole patent for a hydrophone. Bragg took the lead in July 1916 and he moved to the Admiralty hydrophone research establishment at Hawkcraig on the Firth of Forth.Wood 1930,p. 457. The scientists set two goals: to develop a hydrophone that could hear a submarine despite the racket produced by a patrol ship carrying the hydrophone and to develop a hydrophone that could reveal the bearing of the submarine. A bidirectional hydrophone was invented at East London College. They mounted a microphone on each side of a diaphragm in a cylindrical case; when the sounds heard from both microphones have the same intensity, the microphone is in line with the sound source.Wood 1930,p. 457. Bragg's laboratory made such a hydrophone directional by mounting a baffle in front of one side of the diaphragm. It took months to discover that effective baffles must contain a layer of air.Van der Kloot 2014, p. 110. In 1918, airships of the Royal Naval Air Service engaged in anti-submarine warfare experimented by trailing dipped hydrophones.Report AIR 1/645/17/122/304 - National Archives Kew. Airship Hydrophone experiments. Bragg tested a hydrophone from a captured German U-boat and found it inferior to British models. By the end of the war, the British had 38 hydrophone officers and 200 qualified listeners, paid an addition 4d per day.Van der Kloot 2014, p. 125. From late in World War I until the introduction of active sonar in the early 1920s, hydrophones were the sole method for submarines to detect targets while submerged; they remain useful today. Directional hydrophones A small single cylindrical ceramic transducer can achieve near perfect omnidirectional reception. Directional hydrophones increase sensitivity from one direction using two basic techniques: =Focused transducers= This device uses a single transducer element with a dish or conical-shaped sound reflector to focus the signals, in a similar manner to a reflecting telescope. This type of hydrophone can be produced from a low-cost omnidirectional type, but must be used while stationary, as the reflector impedes its movement through water. A new way to direct is to use a spherical body around the hydrophone. The advantage of directivity spheres is that the hydrophone can be moved within the water, ridding it of the interferences produced by a conical-shaped element. =Arrays= Multiple hydrophones can be arranged in an array so that it will add the signals from the desired direction while subtracting signals from other directions. The array may be steered using a beamformer. Most commonly, hydrophones are arranged in a \\"line array\\" but may be in two- or three-dimensional arrangements. SOSUS hydrophones, laid on the seabed and connected by underwater cables, were used, beginning in the 1950s, by the U.S. Navy to track movement of Soviet submarines during the Cold War along a line from Greenland, Iceland and the United Kingdom known as the GIUK gap.Mackay, D.G. \\"Scotland the Brave? US Strategic Policy in Scotland 1953-1974\\". Glasgow University, Masters Thesis (research). 2008. Accessed 12 October 2009.

He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. He is the long-time clown host of Bart and Lisa's favorite TV show, a combination of kiddie variety television hijinks and cartoons including The Itchy & Scratchy Show. Krusty is often portrayed as a cynical, burnt-out, addiction-riddled smoker who is made miserable by show business but continues on anyway. He has become one of the most common characters outside the main Simpson family and has been the focus of several episodes, many of which also feature Sideshow Bob. Krusty was created by cartoonist Matt Groening and partially inspired by Rusty Nails, a television clown from Groening's hometown of Portland, Oregon. He was designed to look like Homer Simpson with clown makeup, with the original idea being that Bart worships a television clown who was actually his own father in disguise. His voice is based on Bob Bell, who portrayed WGN-TV's Bozo the Clown. Krusty made his television debut on January 15, 1989 in the Tracey Ullman Show short \\"The Krusty the Clown Show\\". Role in The Simpsons Krusty the Clown, born Herschel Shmoikel Pinchas Yerucham Krustofsky, was born in the Lower East Side of Springfield and is the son of Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky. Very little is known about his mother, aside from her name being Rachel and that she died when Krusty was around thirteen. Hyman strongly opposed Krusty's wish to become a clown and make people laugh, believing that it would distract him from his religion, wanting the boy to go to yeshiva instead. However, Krusty performed slapstick comedy behind his father's back. One day, he was performing at a rabbis' convention when one joking rabbi squirted seltzer on him, washing off his clown makeup. When Rabbi Krustofsky found out, he disowned his son, and did not speak to him for 25 years. Krusty was later reconciled with his father with the assistance of Bart and Lisa Simpson. It was later revealed that Krusty did not have a Bar Mitzvah service, because Hyman feared he would violate the sanctity of the rites by \\"acting up.\\" Krusty had two adult Bar Mitzvah ceremonies: a Hollywood gala which Krusty uses to stage a comeback after his show is cancelled, then a simple ceremony intended to reconnect with his father. After leaving the Lower East Side of Springfield, Krusty started his show biz career as a street mime in Tupelo, Mississippi (a reference to Elvis Presley's birthplace). Krusty later discovered that he has a daughter named Sophie. He had met Sophie's mother when she served as a soldier in the Gulf War and he was entertaining the troops. After spending the night together, he prevented her from assassinating Saddam Hussein to protect his Saddam-themed comedy act. After that she started hating clowns, and kept their daughter a secret from Krusty. Krusty and Sophie bonded over time, and while not a full-time father, he is known to keep up with her birthdays and to also make occasional in-show references to \\"my daughter.\\" Krusty has his own show on Channel 6 in Springfield: The Krusty the Clown Show, which is aimed towards a children's audience and has many followers, including Bart Simpson. Krusty has licensed the show to dozens of countries that produce localized versions, including Ireland, China, Jamaica, and Romania with the original version being the least popular. Krusty's show has gone through various phases: a clip from 1961 presents the show as a serious talk show featuring Krusty interviewing AFL-CIO president George Meany on the topic of collective bargaining agreements, while a clip from 1963 shows Krusty interviewing Robert Frost, then dumping a load of snow on the poet. The show later takes a different turn, featuring Ravi Shankar as a guest and having Krusty howl a drugged-out version of The Doors' \\"Break on Through (To the Other Side)\\" in 1973. By the 1980s, the show had devolved into a children's entertainment show, although in one episode Krusty provided updates on the 1982 Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands. During the series, the Krusty the Clown Show is shown to be aimed almost entirely at children and features many characters, including Sideshow Mel, Mr. Teeny, Tina Ballerina, and Corporal Punishment. Sideshow Bob begins the series as Krusty's main sidekick. However, years of constant abuse lead to Bob framing Krusty for armed robbery, although Bob is eventually foiled by Bart. Bob is replaced by Sideshow Mel, who has remained loyal to Krusty despite being constantly abused by Krusty as well. Krusty seems to retire from‚Äîand then get back into‚Äîshow business repeatedly throughout his career. One of his retirements is almost made permanent due to just-paroled Sideshow Bob's latest scheme: wiring plastic explosives to a hypnotized Bart and sending him up on stage. When Krusty makes a tribute to Bob at the last minute, however, Bob has a change of heart and stops Bart from fulfilling his mission. Bob and Krusty later reconcile, with Krusty exclaiming that Bob's attempts at Krusty's life make his ratings shoot through the roof. This reconciliation remains for the rest of the series, as Bob abandons his attempts for revenge on Krusty in favor of targeting Bart exclusively. Krusty finishes his show with a song. Bart Simpson is one of Krusty's biggest fans. In the episode \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\" (Season 1, Episode 12) he declares, \\"I've based my entire life on Krusty's teachings,\\" and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He exposes Sideshow Bob's attempted framing, helps Krusty return to the air with a comeback special, reigniting his career, and reunites Krusty with his estranged father. For his part, Krusty is usually grateful for Bart's assistance, but almost immediately forgets about it ‚Äî presumably due to his excessive drinking and drug habits‚Äîand usually does not even remember his name the next time they encounter each other. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attends Kamp Krusty, largely because of the promise that he would get to spend his summer with Krusty. The camp turns out to be a disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen, as the camp is simply a franchise location to which Krusty has licensed his image. Bart keeps his hopes up by believing that Krusty will show up, but one day the camp director, Mr. Black, brings in Barney Gumble with clown makeup masquerading as Krusty. This pushes Bart over the edge. He decides that he is sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and takes over the camp. Krusty immediately visits the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and manages to appease Bart. Krusty is a multimillionaire who has amassed his fortune mostly by licensing his name and image to a variety of substandard products and services, from Krusty alarm clocks to Krusty crowd control barriers. Many of these products are potentially dangerous, such as Krusty's brand of cereal, Krusty-O's, which in one episode boasts a jagged metal Krusty-O in each box. One of many lawsuits regarding these products is launched by Bart, who eats a jagged metal Krusty-O and has to have his appendix removed. The \\"Krusty Korporation,\\" the company responsible for Krusty's licensing, has also launched a series of disastrous promotions and business ventures, such as sponsoring the 1984 Summer Olympics with a rigged promotion that backfires when the Soviet Union boycotts the games, causing Krusty to lose $44 million. In the TV series and comic books, Krusty is also the mascot and owner of the restaurant Krusty Burger. He has been shut down by the health board many times for everything from overworking employees to stapling together half-eaten burgers to make new ones, as well as using beef infected with mad cow disease to save money. Krusty wastes money almost as fast as he earns it: lighting his cigarettes with hundred-dollar bills, eating condor-egg omelettes, spending huge sums on pornographic magazines and call girls, and losing a fortune gambling on everything from horse races to operas and betting against the Harlem Globetrotters. Krusty is a hard-living entertainment veteran, sometimes depicted as a jaded, burned-out has-been, who has been down and out several times and remains addicted to gambling, cigarettes, alcohol, Percodan, Pepto-Bismol, and Xanax. He instantly becomes depressed as soon as the cameras stop rolling; Marge states in \\"The Sweetest Apu\\" that, \\"off camera, he's a desperately unhappy man.\\" Krusty appears to have used cocaine, one time emerging from a restaurant bathroom with white powder under his nose; however, he explains that he was simply researching a part for a film in which he played himself. In his book Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner describes Krusty as \\"the wizened veteran, the total pro\\" who lives the celebrity life. He is miserable but he needs his celebrity status. In \\"Bart the Fink,\\" Bart inadvertently reports Krusty for tax fraud to the Internal Revenue Service and, as a result, Krusty loses most of his money. Bart soon discovers that Krusty has faked his death and is living as Rory B. Bellows on a boat. Krusty declares that he is finished with the life of a celebrity and is unconvinced when Bart reminds him of his fans and his entourage. Finally, Bart tells Krusty that leaving show business would mean losing his celebrity status, which convinces Krusty to return. Krusty has been described as \\"the consummate showman who can't bear the possibility of not being on the air and not entertaining people.\\" In the fourteenth season, Bart convinces Krusty to run for Congress so that Krusty can introduce an airline rerouting bill and stop planes from flying over the Simpsons' house. Krusty agrees and runs on the Republican ticket. Although his campaign starts off badly, Lisa suggests that he try connecting with regular families. He does so, resulting in a landslide victory. Krusty's term starts off badly, as he is completely ignored by his new, more politically savvy colleagues. With the help of the Simpsons and an influential doorman, however, Krusty succeeds in passing his bill. His body features include a third nipple, a veal-shaped birthmark, and a scar on his chest as a result of having a pacemaker inserted into his heart after suffering from a heart attack on the air in 1986. Character =Creation= Krusty in his first appearance in the Simpsons short \\"The Krusty the Clown Show\\" Krusty first appeared in \\"The Krusty the Clown Show\\", one of the Simpsons shorts from The Tracey Ullman Show that first aired on January 15, 1989. The character was partially inspired by TV clown \\"Rusty Nails\\" whom The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and director Brad Bird watched as children while growing up in Portland, Oregon. Groening describes Rusty Nails as being a sweet clown whose show sometimes had a Christian message, but whose name scared Groening. Dan Castellaneta based his voice characterization on Chicago television's Bob Bell who had a very raspy voice and portrayed WGN-TV's Bozo the Clown from 1960 to 1984. Krusty has been compared to an earlier incarnation named \\"Flunky the Late Night viewer mail clown\\" who had appeared on Late Night with David Letterman. Jeff Martin, a writer on Letterman‚Äôs show, created and played the character. Martin also went on to become a writer on The Simpsons writing episodes that included Krusty. Many events in Krusty's life parallel those of comedian Jerry Lewis, including his Jewish background, addiction to Percodan, hosting of telethons, and appearance in The Jazz Singer (Ford Startime). When asked, Groening has simply noted that \\"[Simpsons] characters are collaborations between the writers, animators, and actors\\" without specifically confirming or denying the association. Krusty's appearance and design is essentially that of Homer Simpson with clown makeup. Groening said that \\"The satirical conceit that I was going for at the time was that The Simpsons was about a kid who had no respect for his father, but worshipped a clown who looked exactly like his father\\", a theme which became less important as the show developed. One concept initially saw Krusty being revealed as Homer's secret identity but the idea was dropped for being too complex and because the writers were too busy developing the series. There are two instances of the one assuming the identity of the other. In a (non-canonical) Butterfinger commercial depicting a contest for $50,000 to find out who stole Bart's Butterfinger, a captured Homer appears to be the culprit until Maggie pulls off a mask, revealing Krusty. In the episode \\"Homie the Clown\\", Homer goes to Clown College and dresses up as‚Äîand is confused with‚ÄîKrusty. Krusty was originally just a normal man wearing clown makeup, but David Silverman noted that \\"at some point, we decided he looked [like a clown] all the time\\". The producers had long discussions about whether or not Krusty would always remain in his clown makeup but eventually decided that it did not matter. The writers had tried showing Krusty's real face a few times in early episodes, but decided that it did not look right, although his real face was seen in \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\" and \\"Like Father, Like Clown\\". Later episodes made jokes about Krusty's face. In \\"Homer's Triple Bypass\\", Krusty reveals that his \\"grotesque appearance\\" is the result of multiple heart attacks. Homer remarks that he seems fine, and Krusty replies, \\"This ain't makeup.\\" In \\"Bart the Fink\\", he abandons an idea to sail away with a new identity and swims towards shore, leaving a trail of yellow makeup in his wake and his natural white face underneath. On shore, he shakes off his black hair, revealing his natural green clown hair, and removes his normal-looking fake nose to reveal his natural red bulbous clown nose underneath. =Development= Dan Castellaneta based his voice characterization on Chicago television's Bob Bell. The third season episode \\"Like Father, Like Clown\\" is the first to establish that Krusty is Jewish. Krusty's religion had not been part of the original concept, and the idea came from Jay Kogen. The episode is a parody of The Jazz Singer, which is about a son with a strict religious upbringing who defies his father to become an entertainer. In order to make \\"Like Father, Like Clown\\" a full parody of The Jazz Singer, the decision was made to make Krusty Jewish and have his father be a Rabbi. Krusty's real last name, Krustofsky, was pitched by Al Jean. Krusty's father, Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky was played by Jackie Mason, who won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for the episode. It was established in \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\" that Krusty is illiterate. This was shown in subsequent episodes like \\"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge\\" but the trait was dropped after the first few seasons because it was hard for the writers to write for an illiterate character. Krusty's design has undergone several subtle changes since the early years. For the episode \\"Homie the Clown\\", Krusty's design was permanently enhanced and he was given a different shaped mouth muzzle and permanent bags under his eyes in order to distinguish him from Homer. In the episode \\"Lisa's Wedding\\", which is set fifteen years in the future, Krusty's design was significantly altered to make him look considerably older and was based on Groucho Marx. Krusty is a favorite character of several of the original writers, many of whom related themselves to him and wanted to write the Krusty-focused episodes. Krusty was used as a chance for show business jokes and thus many of Krusty's experiences and anecdotes are based on real experiences and stories heard by the writers. He was a particular favorite of Brad Bird, who directed the first two Krusty episodes and always tried to animate a scene in every Krusty episode. In 1992, Matt Groening and James L. Brooks began planning a live-action spin-off from The Simpsons that revolved around Krusty and would star Dan Castellaneta as Krusty. They pitched the series in 1994. Groening and Michael Weithorn wrote a pilot script where Krusty moved to Los Angeles and got his own talk show. A recurring joke throughout the script was that Krusty lived in a house on wooden stilts which were continuously being gnawed by beavers. Eventually, the contract negotiations fell apart and Groening decided to stop work on the project. Reception In 2004, Dan Castellaneta won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in \\"Today I Am a Clown\\", an episode that heavily features Krusty. Several episodes featuring Krusty have been very well received. In 2007, Vanity Fair named \\"Krusty Gets Kancelled\\" as the ninth best episode of The Simpsons. John Ortved felt, \\"This is Krusty's best episode ‚Äì better than the reunion with his father, or the Bar Mitzvah episode, which won an Emmy much later on. The incorporation of guest stars as themselves is topnotch, and we get to see the really dark side of Krusty's flailing showbiz career. Hollywood, television, celebrities, and fans are all beautifully skewered here.\\" Matt Groening cites \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\" as his ninth favorite episode and has said that he particularly loves Castellaneta's voice work. Groening claims that he has to leave the room every time Castellaneta records as Krusty for fear of ruining the take. Star News Online named \\"Krusty the Clown's hatred of children\\", Kamp Krusty, and Krusty's line \\"All these rules, I feel like I'm in a strip club\\" as some of the four hundred reasons why they loved The Simpsons. The Observer listed two Krusty products, \\"Krusty's Non- Toxic Kologne\\" and \\"Krusty's home pregnancy kit\\", as part of their list of the three hundred reasons why they loved the show. Merchandise Krusty has been included in many Simpsons publications, toys and other merchandise. Krusty- themed merchandise includes dolls, posters, figurines, Jack-in-the-boxes, Pint glasses, bobblehead dolls, costumes, and clothing such as T-shirts. Playmates Toys has made a talking evil Krusty doll, based on the one that appeared in \\"Treehouse of Horror III\\". In 1992, Acclaim Entertainment released the video game Krusty's Fun House for PC and home consoles. Krusty was made into an action figure, and several different versions were included as part of the World of Springfield toy line. The first, which shows Krusty in his normal clown attire with several Krusty products, was released in 2000 as part of \\"wave one\\". The second, released in 2002 as part of \\"wave nine\\", is called \\"busted Krusty\\" and shows him in a prison and without his clown makeup, as he was seen in \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\". The third was released in 2003 as part of \\"wave thirteen\\" and was called \\"Tuxedo Krusty\\". Several Krusty themed play sets were also released, including a Krusty-Lu Studios and Krusty Burger playset, both released in 2001. Krusty appears as a playable character in the toys-to-life video game Lego Dimensions, released via a \\"Fun Pack\\" packaged with a Clown Bike accessory in November 2015. In The Simpsons Ride, a simulator ride opened at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood in May 2008, Krusty builds and opens a cartoon theme park called Krustyland. Sideshow Bob makes an appearance and tries to murder the Simpson family. In July 2007, convenience store chain 7-Eleven converted eleven of its stores in the United States and one in Canada into Kwik-E-Marts to celebrate the release of The Simpsons Movie. Amongst the products sold were \\"Krusty-O's\\", which were made by Malt-O-Meal.

It existed circa 1860 under the name Au rendez-vous des voleurs meaning \\"Where the Thieves Meet.\\" Some twenty years later the walls were decorated with portraits of famous murderers and the place became known as the Cabaret des Assassins. Tradition relates that the cabaret received this name because a band of gangsters broke in and killed the owner's son in a robbery attempt. In 1875, the artist Andre Gill painted the sign that was to suggest its permanent name. It was a picture of a rabbit jumping out of a saucepan, and residents began calling their neighbourhood night-club Le Lapin √† Gill, meaning \\"Gill's rabbit.\\" Over time, the name had evolved into \\"Cabaret Au Lapin Agile,\\" or the Nimble Rabbit Cabaret. The original painting on canvas was stolen in 1893; a reproduction on timber was painted to take its place. The Lapin Agile was bought in the early twentieth century by the cabaret singer, comedian, and nightclub owner Aristide Bruant to save it from demolition. The Lapin Agile became a favourite spot for struggling artists and writers, including Picasso, Modigliani, Apollinaire, Roman Greco and Utrillo. The Lapin Agile is located in the centre of the Montmartre district in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, behind and slightly northwest of Sacre Coeur Basilica. Since this was the heart of artistic Paris at the turn of the twentieth century, there was much discussion at the cabaret about \\"the meaning of art.\\" The Lapin Agile also was popular with Montmartre residents including pimps, eccentrics, poorer people, local anarchists, as well as with students from the Latin Quarter and a sprinkling of upper-class bourgeoisie. Pablo Picasso's 1905 oil painting, Au Lapin Agile (\\"At the Lapin Agile\\") helped to make this cabaret world-famous. The cabaret was often captured on canvas other Montmartre artists such as Maurice Utrillo or Roman Greco. In 1993 American comedian and entertainer, Steve Martin, wrote a play, Picasso at the Lapin Agile, which had a successful run in Chicago, Los Angeles, and elsewhere. The play depicted an imagined meeting between Pablo Picasso and Albert Einstein at the Lapin Agile. Today, many people visit the Lapin Agile, sitting at wooden tables where initials have been carved into the surfaces for decades. Located in a stone building on the steep and cobbled Rue des Saules, the cabaret presents visitors with French songs dating back as far as the fifteenth century.

It was founded in 1918, making it the longest running newspaper currently in print in Israel, and is now published in both Hebrew and English in the Berliner format. The English edition is published and sold together with the International New York Times. Both Hebrew and English editions can be read on the Internet. In North America, it is published as a weekly newspaper, combining articles from the Friday edition with a roundup from the rest of the week. It is known for its left-wing and liberal stances on domestic and foreign issues. As of 2016, the newspaper had a weekday exposure rate of 3.9% in Israel. According to the Center for Research Libraries, among Israel's daily newspapers, \\"Haaretz is considered the most influential and respected for both its news coverage and its commentary.\\" History and ownership Haaretz was first published in 1918 as a newspaper sponsored by the British military government in Palestine. In 1919, it was taken over by a group of socialist-oriented Zionists, mainly from Russia. The newspaper was established on 18 June 1919 by a group of businessmen including the philanthropist Isaac Leib Goldberg, and initially, it was called Hadashot Ha'aretz (\\"News of the Land\\"). Later, the name was shortened to Haaretz. The literary section of the paper attracted leading Hebrew writers of the time. The newspaper was initially published in Jerusalem. From 1919 to 1922, the paper was headed by a succession of editors, among them Leib Yaffe. It was closed briefly due to a budgetary shortfall and reopened in Tel Aviv at the beginning of 1923 under the editorship of Moshe Glickson, who held the post for 15 years. The Tel Aviv municipality granted the paper financial support by paying in advance for future advertisements. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Haaretz's liberal viewpoint was to some degree associated with the General Zionist \\"A\\" faction (which would later help form the Progressive Party), though it was nonpartisan and careful not to espouse the line of any specific party. It was considered the most sophisticated of the Yishuv's dailies. Haaretz Press 1934 Salman Schocken, a Jewish businessman who left Germany in 1934 after the Nazis had come to power, bought the paper in December 1935. Schocken was active in Brit Shalom, also known as the Jewish‚ÄìPalestinian Peace Alliance, a body supporting co-existence between Jews and Arabs which was sympathetic to a homeland for both peoples. His son, Gershom Schocken, became the chief editor in 1939 and held that position until his death in 1990. The Schocken family were the sole owners of the Haaretz Group until August 2006, when they sold a 25% stake to German publisher M. DuMont Schauberg. The deal was negotiated with the help of the former Israeli ambassador to Germany, Avi Primor. This deal was seen as controversial in Israel as DuMont Schauberg's father, Kurt Neven DuMont, was member of the Nazi party and his publishing house promoted Nazi ideology. On 12 June 2011, it was announced that Russian- Israeli businessman Leonid Nevzlin had purchased a 20% stake in the Haaretz Group, buying 15% from the family and 5% from M. DuMont Schauberg. In October 2012, a union strike mobilized to protest planned layoffs by the Haaretz management, causing a one-day interruption of Haaretz and its TheMarker business supplement. According to Israel Radio, it was the first time since 1965 that a newspaper did not go to press on account of a strike. Management The newspaper's editorial policy was defined by Gershom Schocken, who was editor-in-chief from 1939 to 1990. Schocken was succeeded as editor-in-chief by Hanoch Marmari. In 2004 David Landau replaced Marmari and was succeeded by Dov Alfon in 2008. The current editor-in-chief of the newspaper is Aluf Benn, who replaced Alfon in August 2011. Charlotte Halle became editor of the English print edition in February 2008. Editorial policy and viewpoints Haaretz describes itself as having \\"a broadly liberal outlook both on domestic issues and on international affairs\\". Others describe it alternatively as liberal,  centre-left, or left-wing.  The newspaper opposes retaining control of the territories and consistently supports peace initiatives.Israel ‚Äî Hebrew- and English-Language Media Guide, p. 14 The Haaretz editorial line is supportive of weaker elements in Israeli society, such as sex workers, foreign laborers, Israeli Arabs, Ethiopian immigrants, and Russian immigrants. In 2006, the BBC said that Haaretz takes a moderate stance on foreign policy and security. David Remnick in The New Yorker described Haaretz as \\"easily the most liberal newspaper in Israel\\", its ideology as left-wing and its temper as \\"insistently oppositional\\". According to Ira Sharkansky, Haaretzs op-ed pages are open to a variety of opinions. J. J. Goldberg, the editor of the American The Jewish Daily Forward, describes Haaretz as \\"Israel's most vehemently anti-settlement daily paper\\". Stephen Glain of The Nation described Haaretz as \\"Israel's liberal beacon\\", citing its editorials voicing opposition to the occupation, the discriminatory treatment of Arab citizens, and the mindset that led to the Second Lebanon War. A 2003 study in The International Journal of Press/Politics concluded that Haaretzs reporting of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict was more favorable to Israelis than to Palestinians, but less so than that of The New York Times. In 2016, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, wrote \\"I like a lot of the people at Haaretz, and many of its positions, but the cartoonish anti- Israelism and anti-Semitism can be grating\\".Journalist Jeffrey Goldberg stirs storm after tweeting he might stop reading Haaretz, JTA, 2 August 2016Amos Schocken, third-generation proprietor of Ha‚Äôaretz, Financial Times, John Reed, 3 October 2016  Formatting, circulation and reputation  Front page of the Hebrew and English editions = Circulation = In 2016, the newspaper's readership fell to an all-time low of 3.9% on weekdays, far behind other national newspapers in Israel: Israel Hayom had an exposure rate of 39.7%, Yedioth Ahronoth 34.9%, Israel Post 7.2%, and Globes 4.6%. = Formatting and image = Haaretz uses smaller headlines and print than other mass circulation papers in Israel. Less space is devoted to pictures, and more to political analysis. Opinion columns are generally written by regular commentators rather than guest writers. Its editorial pages are considered influential among government leaders. Apart from the news, Haaretz publishes feature articles on social and environmental issues, as well as book reviews, investigative reporting, and political commentary. In 2008, the newspaper itself reported a paid subscribership of 65,000, daily sales of 72,000 copies, and 100,000 on weekends. The English edition has a subscriber base of 15,000. As of June 2011, readership was 5.8% of the public, down from 6.4% the prior year. In 2012, amid falling circulation, Haaretz was undergoing severe cuts (reportedly firing around 20% of its total workforce, and lowering salaries by between 15 and 35%), and cuts continued through 2013. Despite its historically relatively low circulation in Israel, Haaretz has for many years been described as Israel's most influential daily newspaper.  * * Its readership includes members of Israel's intelligentsia and members of its political and economic elites. * * In 1999, surveys show that Haaretz readership has a higher-than- average education, income, and wealth and that most are Ashkenazim. Some have said that it functions for Israel much as The New York Times does for the United States, as a newspaper of record. In 2007, Shmuel Rosner, the newspaper's former U.S. correspondent, told The Nation that \\"people who read it are better educated and more sophisticated than most, but the rest of the country doesn't know it exists.\\" According to former editor of the paper, Hanoch Marmari, the newspaper has lost its political influence in Israel, because it became \\"detached\\" from the country's political life. Criticism Andrea Levin, executive director of the American pro-Israel Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting (CAMERA), said the newspaper was doing \\"damage to the truth\\" and sometimes making serious factual errors but not often correcting them. According to The Jerusalem Post, Haaretz editor-in- chief David Landau said at the 2007 Limmud conference in Moscow that he had told his staff not to report about criminal investigations against Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in order to promote Sharon's 2004‚Äì2005 Gaza disengagement plan. In April 2017, Haaretz published an op-ed by a staff writer that said the religious right is worse than Hezbollah.\\"Paper draws fire for op-ed calling national religious worse than Hezbollah\\", Times of Israel, 13 April 2017.\\"Haaretz slammed for article calling national religious 'worse than Hezbollah, Ynetnews, 13 April 2017. Condemnation followed, including from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Reuven Rivlin, and other government ministers and MPs, as well as from Opposition Leader Isaac Herzog.\\"Haaretz op-ed draws condemnations across the political spectrum\\", Israel Hayom, 13 April 2017.  Internet editions  Haaretz operates both Hebrew and English language websites. The two sites offer up-to-the-minute breaking news, live Q&A; sessions with newsmakers from Israel, the Palestinian territories and elsewhere, and blogs covering a range of political standpoints and opinions. , the English online edition has an Alexa rank of 2,683 worldwide and 2,861 in the United States.

He was voiced by Phil Hartman, and his first appearance was in the season two episode \\"Bart Gets Hit by a Car\\". Hutz is a stereotypical ambulance chasing shady lawyer in Springfield with questionable competence and ethics. He is nevertheless often hired by the Simpsons. Following Hartman's death in 1998, Hutz was retired; his final speaking role was in the season nine episode \\"Realty Bites\\" five months earlier. Role in The Simpsons =Personality= Lionel Hutz is an ambulance chasing personal injury lawyer and, according to Lisa Simpson, a \\"shyster\\" whom the Simpsons nonetheless repeatedly hire as their lawyer (a fact remarked on by Marge Simpson in a typically self-aware aside), mostly because Hutz is the only legal counsel the Simpsons can afford. His legal practice, located in a shopping mall, is named \\"I Can't Believe It's a Law Firm!\\" and also offers \\"expert shoe repair.\\" He often tries to entice potential clients with free gifts, including a \\"smoking monkey\\" doll, a pen that looks like a cigar, an exotic faux-pearl necklace, a business card that \\"turns into a sponge when you put it in water,\\" and even an almost-full Orange Julius he was drinking from himself. John G. Browning of the Southeast Texas Record describes Hutz as a literal ambulance chaser; \\"Hutz typifies the sleazy lawyer. He exaggerates his academic credentials (\\"I've attended Harvard, Yale, MIT, Oxford, the Sorbonne, the Louvre\\") and is \\"the very worst in legal marketing\\". Hutz is characterized as both a grossly incompetent lawyer and an unethical individual in general. This, along with his greed in wanting half of the money, was supported in \\"Bart Gets Hit By a Car\\" in his first appearance. Hutz is disliked and mistrusted by both Marge and Lisa who see him for the person he is inside: especially when he, along with Homer, made Bart lie about the extent of his injuries. Marge later testified against Hutz out of spite for hiring Dr. Nick, a quack doctor with a shady reputation, along with making Bart lie about his injuries and being in intense pain, when he was fine. Hutz' incompetence and greed are also well noted by his rival, the more competent Blue Haired Lawyer. In the episode \\"Marge in Chains\\" he describes the following as his \\"problem\\" with Judge Snyder: > Well, he's had it in for me ever since I kinda ran over his dog... Well, > replace the word \\"kinda\\" with the word \\"repeatedly\\" and the word \\"dog\\" with > \\"son\\". Hutz is a recovering alcoholic. He once offered Marge a celebratory \\"belt of Scotch\\" at 9:30 in the morning, remarking that he hadn't \\"slept in days.\\" In the same episode, he hastily leaves the courtroom after handling a bottle of bourbon in order to consult his sponsor, David Crosby. He then gives his closing statement, unaware that he is not wearing any pants and thinks that Clarence Darrow was \\"the black guy on The Mod Squad\\". Beyond practicing law, he also tries his hand at selling real estate, reasoning that it was a natural move as most of his clients ended up losing their homes anyway. Out of desperation for work, he has resorted to babysitting. Hutz, left in charge of the children for longer than he was hired, nods off in a sitting position,; he produces a switchblade upon awakening suddenly. He burns all of his personal documentation in the Simpsons fireplace, claiming that \\"Lionel Hutz\\" no longer exists and he is now \\"Miguel Sanchez\\". But he did earn $8 for babysitting Bart, Lisa, and Maggie for 32 hours. His other alias is \\"Dr. Nguyen Van Phuoc\\". He also ran a shoe-repair business out of his law office. Hutz's incompetence and financial desperation sometimes lead him to resort to rooting through dumpsters, claiming it is client-related. Hutz was briefly married to Selma Bouvier, although this storyline is not shown in an episode and instead mentioned in \\"Selma's Choice\\". However, he only married Selma in order to get his hands on her Aunt Gladys' inheritance. When he was caught forging Gladys' signature by Marge and Lisa, Hutz was forced to properly read the will and give Marge's family Gladys' inheritance. Hutz has also been known to use a phone booth as an office. Hutz does not seem to care about conflict of interest; in \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\" he represents clients in a lawsuit against the producer(s) of a local production of A Streetcar Named Desire for not giving them any roles in the play, although he had a role himself. Another display of his incompetence takes place in \\"The Boy Who Knew Too Much\\" when, while representing a French waiter who is accusing Mayor Quimby's nephew Freddy of battery, he is surprised when the opposing counsel mentions that Hutz's client is an immigrant (despite the client's French accent). Hutz then demands that his client tell him everything from then on. Browning wrote that his \\"courtroom skills leave something to be desired\\"; in the episode \\"Marge in Chains\\", he motions for a \\"bad court thingy\\", at which the judge replies \\"You mean a mistrial?\\", and then refers to himself as the \\"law-talking guy\\".\\"Marge in Chains\\" =Cases won= Although Hutz loses most of his cases, he does win several cases for the Simpsons. In \\"Bart the Murderer\\", he represented Bart when the latter was suspected for the supposed murder of Seymour Skinner, and the charges were dropped when Skinner reveals himself to be alive. In \\"New Kid on the Block\\", he represents Homer in his case against the Sea Captain and the Frying Dutchman restaurant over its \\"All You Can Eat\\" offer (\\"The most blatant case of fraudulent advertising since my suit against the film The Never Ending Story\\"). He also wins a case for Bart Simpson in \\"The Day the Violence Died\\", by proving that Itchy was created by an old man named Chester J. Lampwick‚Äîthough the deciding factor of the case is mainly proven by Bart's footwork to collect the crucial piece of evidence, rather than Hutz's competence. Hutz initiates the trial with zero credible evidence. In \\"'Round Springfield\\", Hutz successfully sues Krusty the Clown after Bart consumes a jagged metal Krusty-O from a box of cereal, resulting in an inflamed appendix. After winning the case, Hutz gives Bart only $500 of the $100,000 settlement. In \\"Sideshow Bob Roberts\\", Hutz wins a case against Sideshow Bob, who was mayor at that time, for electoral fraud, in which Bart and Lisa found evidence connected to it. The only other case technically won by Hutz was in \\"Treehouse of Horror IV\\", where he represents Homer against Satan (represented as Ned Flanders). In a purportedly-deleted scene for this episode, as subsequently seen in \\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\\", Hutz's slogan is \\"Cases won in 30 minutes or your pizza is free\\". After he thinks he has lost the case, he gives the Simpsons their pizza. However, Marge informs him that they did win. Then, he tells them that the box was empty anyway. In the video game The Simpsons: Hit & Run, billboards can be seen around Downtown Springfield promoting Lionel Hutz's free pizza offer. Creation and retirement Phil Hartman was first suggested for the role of Lionel Hutz by Simpsons writer Jay Kogen, who liked Hartman's \\"great, strong voice.\\" Writer Mike Scully described Hutz as a \\"combination of overconfidence and incompetence. He never doubted his ability in the courtroom for some reason, even though he had no idea what was going on.\\" After Hartman's death in 1998, Hutz and Hartman's other recurring character, Troy McClure, were retired. The last episode to feature Hutz speaking was the season 9 episode \\"Realty Bites\\". Since the Simpson family frequently appears in court, other characters have represented the Simpsons in legal matters since Hutz's retirement. For example, in \\"Sweets and Sour Marge\\", the equally-incompetent Gil Gunderson stepped in. The Blue Haired Lawyer‚Äîwho is just as unethical yet very competent ‚Äì has also served as the family's attorney. Following Hartman's death, Hutz appeared infrequently in clip shows and flashbacks, as well as crowd scenes, but only in non-speaking roles. His last appearance in the series was in the season 12 episode \\"A Tale of Two Springfields\\". Hutz and McClure still appeared in Simpsons Comics until its end in 2018. Reception Entertainment Weekly named Hutz as one of their 15 favorite fictional television and film lawyers. His characterization as an ambulance chaser who is only concerned with money has been viewed as part of a trend away from more noble depictions of lawyers in literature, such as Atticus Finch, and towards more critical depictions of lawyers and the United States legal system. Hutz has also been examined as an example of a fictional depiction of a member of the professional service market in popular culture.

He is voiced by Hank Azaria and first appeared in the series premiere episode \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\". Moe is the proprietor and bartender of Moe's Tavern, a Springfield bar frequented by Homer Simpson, Barney Gumble, Lenny Leonard, Carl Carlson, Sam, Larry, and others. Grouchy, lonely, miserable and prone to violent outbursts, Moe is constantly down on his luck, and has attempted suicide numerous times. Other running jokes featuring him include being prank called by Bart Simpson, running illegal activities from his bar, and an ambiguous ethnic origin. Role in The Simpsons =Moe's Tavern= Moe is the owner and operator of Moe's Tavern, frequented by Homer Simpson and other characters including Lenny Leonard, Carl Carlson, Sam and Larry and his former most loyal customer, Barney Gumble. The bar is noted for its depressing atmosphere and uncleanliness. The regular patrons of the tavern have been abandoned by Moe in several episodes in which he changes its target audience. The first of these was \\"Flaming Moe's\\", in the third season. As a running joke, Moe is sometimes seen engaging in unlicensed or illegal activities at the tavern, such as smuggling pandas and an orca in \\"Cape Feare\\" and \\"The Springfield Files\\", respectively. Particularly in earlier episodes, the Tavern was frequently prank called by Bart Simpson, who would ask for a gag name which when said by Moe would involve innuendo or insults (e.g., Mike Rotch/\\"My crotch\\", Ivana Tinkle/\\"I wanna tinkle\\", and Seymour Butz/\\"See more butts\\"). =Personality= Moe is portrayed with a generally disagreeable personality: he has a short, violent temper, a penurious nature, a crass and undiplomatic manner of speech, and a mood that rapidly vacillates between anger, indifference and suicidal despair (the latter of which has become more apparent in later episodes of the show). He has an annual Christmas tradition of attempted suicide, but his attempts are comically unsuccessful (landing on a hot-air balloon after jumping out of a plane, for example), and he has already called the suicide hotline so many times that they've blocked his number.Vincent Terrace, Television Series of the 1980s (London: Rowman & Littlefield, 2017), 201-2. He is easily irritated, frequently threatening the patrons at his bar with a shotgun he keeps behind the counter. He is also gullible, and Bart's unending chain of successful prank calls to his bar are particularly infuriating to him, inevitably prompting a torrent of Red Deutsch-style threats of gruesome bodily harm in return. He also is, however, occasionally shown to have a sentimental and caring side to his personality, such as reading to sick children and the homeless, although he is secretive about such behavior. In his interactions with his various girlfriends, he has also shown genuine selflessness and kindness (as well as an unusual improvement in his disposition), although negative elements of his personality inevitably emerge and ruin things. In \\"Thank God It's Doomsday\\", he asks for salvation, because \\"I've done stuff I ain't proud of. And the stuff I am proud of is disgusting.\\"Audio snippet from Thank God It's Doomsday =Relationships= Moe has an almost non-existent love life due to his vulgarity towards women and his ugly appearance. Despite this, he has had a number of romantic experiences, including sleeping with his waitress Collette, dating a woman named Renee, and briefly enjoying the company of many women after he had plastic surgery. He also has a relationship and proposed to a dwarf named Maya, but Moe could not adjust to the difference in height, to the point where his ultimate plan to have his own leg bones shortened led Maya to leave him. He has long been infatuated with Marge Simpson, whom he usually calls \\"Midge\\", and has on occasion tried to win her away from Homer, although later episodes have shown him actively working to keep the two together. He has been romantically involved with Edna Krabappel as well as Marge's sister Selma Bouvier. Moe's romantic attractions have resulted in run-ins with the law; he has stalked Maude Flanders and other townspeople, he must register as a sex offender, and he has a restraining order placed upon him. At one point, he is seen on his way to a \\"V.D. clinic\\". Despite his disturbing approach, Moe has showed to be a caring and devoted lover. While dating Renee (and previously Edna), he wholeheartedly spoiled them with whatever they wanted and vowed to give up his bar and take them away from Springfield forever, even if it means losing his own money and doing illegal acts to make more money. When he thought he finally won Marge's heart, he promised to be \\"the best man she'd ever had\\". In \\"Pygmoelian\\", Moe and his three closest friends assess him as a gargoyle with cauliflower ears, lizard lips, little rat eyes, a caveman brow and fish snout, who is not pleasant to look at, listen to or be with.Moe Syzlak quote from \\"Pygmoelian\\", IMDB =Family and biography= Moe Szyslak illegally immigrated to the United States from the Netherlands (he reveals his Dutch heritage in \\"Bart-Mangled Banner\\"). As shown in \\"Bart's Inner Child\\", he also used to have an Italian accent, hinting at Italian heritage. The Season 29 episode King Leer, finally reveals Moe's backstory and shows his family. Revealing Moe's father, who is called Morty still lives, and that Moe has a brother and a sister. Moe's family works in the business of selling mattress and beds, having a franchise with multiple stores in Springfield, the key to the success was that Moe's father kept infesting all rival business with bed bugs, making his business the only reliable one. When Morty asks a young Moe to infest a rival business, Moe refuses, then the family of the business Moe refused to infest, infests one of the mattress stores of Moe's father, and as a consequence Moe's dad stops speaking to him. Decades later Moe and his father reconnect in the episode. Previous to that appearance of Moe's family, the show had given many wildly inconsistent backstories regarding Moe's past, in \\"Moe Goes from Rags to Riches\\" (2012), an infant Moe is even depicted living on Mount Everest as the son of a Yeti.\\"Moe Goes from Rags to Riches\\"https://tv.avclub.com/moe-goes-to-the-mattresses-with-his-family-on-a- service-1825282315 Moe (left) as \\"Smelly\\" in The Little Rascals. Prior to that revelation, numerous one-off jokes had been made regarding Moe's childhood and his earlier adult years. In \\"Radioactive Man\\" (1995), he is depicted as having been one of the original Little Rascals, but was fired after killing the \\"original Alfalfa\\". However, charges were not pressed against him as the \\"original Alfalfa\\" was in fact an orphan owned by the studio. As Homer's boxing coach in \\"The Homer They Fall\\" (1996), he shows photographs from throughout his own boxing career, stating that his ugly appearance was the result of competing in the sport. Moe's college years are also depicted, in \\"Homer the Moe\\" (2001), which shows Moe as having attended \\"bar-tending school\\" at Swigmore University (a play on Skidmore College) before opening what became Moe's Tavern. In \\"Springfield Up\\" (2007), footage from a documentary called Growing Up Springfield shows an 8-year-old Moe claiming that his father was a circus freak. He was unsure which one, but liked to think it was a little of all of them.\\"Springfield Up\\" This is further reinforced in \\"Sleeping With The Enemy\\" when he briefly asserts himself as a member of the Muntz family. After Nelson's father returns, blaming his absence on having been stolen away by the circus due to a peanut allergy disfiguring his face. Teenage Moe is shown again in \\"She Used to Be My Girl\\" (2004), where he is depicted working in the school cafeteria, given as his first job \\"since prison\\"; Marge is responsible for having him sent back there. \\"The Seemingly Never-Ending Story\\" (2006) depicts scenes set years prior to the series' present in which Moe and schoolteacher Edna Krabappel are shown to have had a brief love affair. In \\"Them, Robot\\" (2012), a flashback scene depicts a young child being stomped on by an elephant, and his face then changing to Moe. In \\"Flaming Moe's\\" (1991), he is called Morris by his lover, and while in \\"The Springfield Connection\\" (1995), (Homer refers to Moe by the Arabic \\"Moammar\\", and in \\"Eeny Teeny Maya Moe\\" (2009), he suggests that he only changed his name to Moe when he purchased Moe's Tavern. The show's many conflicting stories as to Moe's heritage have been sent up in the tie-in book The Book of Moe (2008), where Moe is depicted in several different foreign national folk costumes commenting upon them. An early joke in the series was that Moe was a European immigrant to the United States. In \\"Much Apu About Nothing\\" (1996), Moe is depicted taking his United States citizenship test; previously, \\"Bart's Inner Child\\" (1993) had depicted Moe's own inner child chastising him for abandoning his native Italian accent. Later, in \\"Bart-Mangled Banner\\" (2004), he reveals himself to be Dutch, and in \\"Lisa Goes Gaga\\" (2012), Moe describes himself as \\"half monster, half Armenian.\\" Moe is also hinted to be Armenian in \\"Judge Me Tender\\" (2010), claiming that Armenian Idol is his favorite show. As for indications he was born in America, in \\"Homer the Heretic\\" (1992), Moe's claims \\"I was born a snake handler and I'll die a snake handler\\" while in \\"Day of the Jackanapes\\" (2001) he claims to have been born in Indiana. Azaria has mentioned that Moe is from the Queens borough of New York City. Character =Creation= The creator of The Simpsons Matt Groening based Moe on Louis \\"Red\\" Deutsch, who was made famous when he was repeatedly prank called by two Jersey City residents. These prank calls were the inspiration for Bart Simpson's repeated prank calls to Moe, and Deutsch's often profane responses inspired Moe's violent temper. Comedian Rich Hall, an acquaintance of The Simpsons writer George Meyer, has stated that he believes further inspiration was drawn from himself and that Groening has verified this to him. Moe's surname \\"Szyslak\\" was revealed in \\"Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part One)\\". Writers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein found the name in a phone-book and gave it to Moe so that he would have the initials M.S., and hence be a suspect in the Burns shooting.Oakley, Bill (2005). Commentary for \\"Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part One)\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Moe was designed by animator Dan Haskett and his facial appearance was modelled after a gorilla.Silverman, David (2001). Commentary for \\"Bart the General\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.Reiss, Mike (2004). Commentary for \\"Homer's Barbershop Quartet\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Animator Mark Kirkland said that he often lets off-model drawings of Moe pass through production because the character is so ugly that no one will notice.Kirkland, Mark (2004). Commentary for \\"Bart Sells His Soul\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. =Voice= Hank Azaria Moe was the first voice Hank Azaria performed for the show. During the time of his audition, Azaria was doing a play in which he had the part of a drug dealer, basing his voice on actor Al Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon. He used the same voice in the audition, and was told by Matt Groening and Sam Simon, who were directing him, to make it more gravelly like Deutsch's voice. Groening and Simon thought that it was perfect and took Azaria over to the Fox network recording studio. The result is Moe's pronounced New York accent. Before he had even seen a script, Azaria recorded several lines of dialogue as Moe for the episode \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\".Azaria, Hank; Jean, Al (2004). Commentary for \\"Homer's Barbershop Quartet\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Moe was originally voiced by actor Christopher Collins. Hank Azaria explained that he did not discover this fact for several years, and it was explained that Collins' acting was fine, but other staff and actors found Collins unpleasant to work with. Collins recorded several lines as Moe which never aired. Reception In 2001 and 2003, Hank Azaria won Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for voicing Moe and various other characters.

He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta, and first appeared in the episode \\"Bart Gets an F\\". Quimby is the mayor of Springfield, and is a composite parody of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy and certain other members of the Kennedy family who have entered politics. Concept and creation Joe Quimby is a parody of U.S. Senator from Massachusetts Ted Kennedy and the Kennedy family, as well as of corrupt politicians in general. Like the Kennedys, Quimby \\"speaks with a Boston accent, throws money at political problems, and vacations in a coastal resort called the 'Quimby Compound. Castellaneta voices Quimby with Transatlantic and Boston accents, resulting in a voice reminiscent of that of President John F. Kennedy.Groening, Matt (2005). Commentary for the episode \\"Sideshow Bob Roberts\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. Twentieth Century Fox. Appearances Quimby has long served as the mayor of the city of Springfield. He appears as a slick, opportunistic politician whose chief priorities seem to be keeping himself in office and various other forms of corruption, including embezzling tax money, taking bribes from Fat Tony, and giving monthly kickbacks to Police Chief Wiggum. The seal on the wall of his office reads \\"Corruptus in Extremis\\", which means \\"extremely corrupt\\". Like Kennedy, Quimby is known as a womanizer, and occasionally amuses himself with pornographic playing cards during town meetings. Quimby was once the subject of 27 separate paternity suits. One of the women he impregnated is Cookie Kwan, whose baby is remarkably similar to Quimby in both looks and mannerisms. Quimby also is frequently noticed in bed with the same or similar blonde woman/women, at least one of whom was Miss Springfield. He also once accidentally courted his own niece, which is one of the few things Quimby has ever shown shame over. Despite being the mayor for such a long time, Quimby does not know or care much about his city, often privately (or even publicly) showing his outright contempt for Springfield's citizens. He frequently takes overseas vacations, which take him out of town for extended periods of time, leading to the headline \\"Mayor Visits City\\" in the Springfield Shopper. He once referred to Springfield as \\"Springfeld\\" at a public meeting. However, he makes frequent, albeit short, public appearances for local festivities, events, business openings, etc. If bending the law will suit Quimby's purposes, he will likely do so. He once arranged Marge Simpson's release after she was arrested for blocking traffic on a bridge after suffering a nervous breakdown, claiming that if she went to jail, Quimby could kiss the \\"chick vote\\" goodbye. He also resorted to bribing witnesses when assault charges were brought against his nephew, leading Bart Simpson to observe that \\"the system works: just ask Claus von B√ºlow\\". His catchphrase is \\"Vote Quimby\\", which he always finds an opportunity to say, even in situations where it would be disadvantageous to identify himself, like inadvertently being caught by Homer in a motel room with his mistress. Quimby was elected Mayor of Springfield in 1986 and has been re-elected several times since, despite openly admitting to fraud and wrongdoing. In the season 4 episode \\"Krusty Gets Kancelled\\" he admits to using taxpayer dollars to fund the murder of his enemies, but thanks to a clever use of a popular Gabbo catchphrase (\\"I'm a bad wittle boy\\"), he is re-elected in a landslide. Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Quimby. Quimby's political stranglehold on Springfield has earned him the hatred of Springfield's small but vocal Republican elite, themselves portrayed as mostly dark, ghoulish figures who meet in a castle. When the Republicans nominate Sideshow Bob as its mayoral candidate, Bob rigs the election, briefly deposing Quimby. He is re-instated when Bob is found guilty of fraud and imprisoned. Later, Quimby briefly flees the city thinking his corruption has been exposed and is deemed to have \\"abandoned office\\" and is replaced by a short-lived \\"council of learned citizens\\" headed by Lisa Simpson, Professor Frink, Comic Book Guy, Lindsey Naegle, Dr. Hibbert, and Principal Skinner. He also survives a recall election, with no candidate in the race against him (candidates include Rainier Wolfcastle (a Schwarzenegger reference), Kent Brockman, and even Homer Simpson) garnering the five percent necessary to force a recall. Reception Literary critic Paul Cantor has cited Mayor Quimby as an example of Springfield's atomistic politics, noting \\"Mayor Quimby is a demagogue, but at least he is Springfield's own demagogue. When he buys votes, he buys them directly from the citizens of Springfield.\\" During the USA Today contest to choose which Springfield would host the release of The Simpsons Movie, Ted Kennedy himself appears in a video in which he invited \\"Diamond Joe\\" Quimby and the film to premiere in Springfield, Massachusetts, and even mocked his own oft-mocked pronunciation of the word \\"Chowder\\" (as \\"Chow-Dah\\"); however, Springfield, Vermont was chosen instead. On May 17, 2013, following reporting on a new scandal, Justin Peters, crime reporter for Slate magazine compared gaffe-plagued Mayor of Toronto Rob Ford to Quimby. Peters prepared a list of 20 outrageous statements, and asked readers to guess which ones were uttered by the fictional Quimby, and which were uttered by the real life Ford.

It is located on the Chinde River, and is an important fishing center. It exports copra and sugar, and had a population of 16,500 in 1980. Chinde lies in Chinde District of Zambezia Province. History The small town of Chinde, located approximately 40 miles south of Quelimane, developed as the main point of entry for passengers and goods for the British Central Africa Protectorate which was proclaimed in 1891. Because of its favourable location on the Chinde River, part of the Zambezi River delta, it had potential for growth, and superseded both Quelimane and Concei√ß√£o as the most suitable port of entry .United States Department of Commerce and Labor, Bureau of Statistics, United States Bureau of Foreign Commerce (1854‚Äì1903), Commercial Relations of the United States with Foreign Countries, (1896), Published by University of Michigan, Retrieved 14 June 2008 Until the third quarter of the 19th century, Quelimane, which was linked to the Zambezi river by a shallow channel, was the main port giving access to Central Africa. The Congress of Berlin in 1884 established free navigation of the Zambezi and its tributary rivers, and a number of British missionaries and traders who had started to visit and settle in what is now Malawi traveled there using the Zambezi and Shire River.M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, London, Hurst & Co, p. 11. When the channel from Quelimane became blocked, the search for an alternative route led to the discovery of the Chinde mouth of the Zambezi in 1889. As part of the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891, the Portuguese government granted the British government the Chinde Concession for 99 years to establish a port where seagoing ships could transfer their cargoes to river steamers.A. Hetherwick, (1917) Nyasaland To-day and To-morrow, Journal of the Royal African Society, Vol. 17, No. 65, p. 12. The Inner Concession, which was exempt from Portuguese custom duties, had an area of 10 hectares, with a river frontage of 420 yards. This contained the government offices and the commercial warehouses, workshops and stores. A further 50 hectares without customs exemption, the Outer Concession, was designed to house the slowly growing population of Chinde. The site selected was a sandspit with the Indian Ocean to the south and the Chinde river to the north. A tidal creek virtually separated the Concession from the mainland, making it more of an island than a peninsula.C Baker, (1980). The Chinde Concession, 1891‚Äì1923, The Society of Malawi Journal, Vol. 33, No. 1, pp. 6-7. Chinde briefly flourished as the port for British Central Africa, which became Nyasaland in 1907. At the end of the 19th century, ocean-going ships of the Union Castle and German East Africa lines were met at Chinde by small river steamers which took passengers and goods up to the head of navigation on the Shire River at Katunga, the closest point on the river to Blantyre, the main town in the British Central Africa Protectorate, a journey of around seven days.J Perry (1969) The growth of the transport network of Malawi- The Society of Malawi Journal, Vol. 22, No. 2, pp. 25-6 The African Lakes Company had trading station at the Concession and maintained around six steamers of up to 40 tons on the Zambezi and Shire rivers. Two other British companies had five more steamers of 20 to 30 tons in this route.The Admiralty Hydrographic Office (1897) The Africa Pilot (Part III) South and East Coasts of Africa, Sixth Edition, London Admiralty Board, p. 239. For several years before 1922, the erosion of the soft sand in which the Concession was built became an increasing problem. Many of the earlier buildings had to be taken down and re-erected to avoid being washed away or replaced.C Baker, (1980). The Chinde Concession, 1891‚Äì1923, p. 14. By the time the port was severely damaged by a cyclone in February 1922 it was already in decline because only relatively small ships could use it and the port of Beira was a better alternative.G L Gamlen, (1935). Transport on the River Shire, Nyasaland, The Geographical Journal, Vol. 86 No. 5, pp. 451-2. It would have been difficult and very expensive to restore Chinde fully, but some attempt was made to repair the worst of the damage. However, once the rail link from Nyasaland to Beira was completed in 1922, the main purpose for the existence of the Concession was removed. The British Concession was abandoned and the lease was cancelled in 1923.C Baker, (1980). The Chinde Concession, 1891‚Äì1923, pp. 15‚Äì16. Chinde returned to Portuguese control: it ceased to serve as a port for Nyasaland, but continued to act as a local port, particularly for the sugar exports of Sena Sugar Estates from the Zambezi valley.M Newitt, (1995).

He is voiced by Hank Azaria and first appeared in the second-season episode \\"Three Men and a Comic Book\\", which originally aired on May 9, 1991. Comic Book Guy is the proprietor of a comic book store, The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop. He is based on \\"every comic book store guy in America\\" and represents a stereotypical middle-aged comic-book collector. He is well known for his distinctive accent, disagreeable personality and his catchphrase, \\"Worst [blank] ever!\\" Role in The Simpsons =Profile= Comic Book Guy (who states Jeff Albertson to be his real name in the episode \\"Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass\\") is a nerdy, snobby and quarrelsome man best known for his eloquence and crabby, sarcastic quips. He is obsessed with collecting comic books and is an avid science fiction buff. He holds a master's degree in folklore and mythology (having translated The Lord of the Rings into Klingon as part of his thesis),\\"Three Men and a Comic Book\\" as well as a degree in chemical engineering,Married to the Blob has an IQ of 170, and is a member of the Springfield branch of Mensa. He is morbidly obese and has long hair, which he always keeps tied in a ponytail. His catchphrase is the declaration \\"worst/best [subject] ever\\", sometimes to the point of breaking the fourth wall. For example, in the episode \\"Saddlesore Galactica\\", he wears a T-shirt saying \\"Worst Episode Ever\\" and criticizes the idea of the Simpson family keeping a horse since that was the subject of a previous episode. Another example of breaking the fourth wall occurs in an episode when Comic Book Guy's chair collapses, and he sarcastically says \\"Ooh, a fat man falls. Real original.\\" Despite his solitary life, in The Simpsons Movie, minutes before his likely death, Comic Book Guy says that his obsessive comic book collecting has been a \\"life well spent\\". However, in \\"Treehouse of Horror VIII\\", when a nuclear missile homes in on him, he says to himself, \\"Oh, I've wasted my life.\\", although the Treehouse of Horror episodes are not part of the normal Simpsons canon. In the 2008 episode \\"Any Given Sundance\\" it was revealed that he is also a writer and posts to his own site called \\"Ain't I Fat News\\", a take on the real-life movie review website Ain't It Cool News. =Romance= Comic Book Guy was once married in an online role-playing game. He and his Internet wife contemplated having children, but that would have severely drained his \\"power crystals\\". In Season 16's \\"There's Something About Marrying\\", he hopes to wed a Xena: Warrior Princess cardboard figure. While part of an intellectual junta that briefly ran Springfield in \\"They Saved Lisa's Brain\\", he proposes plans to limit breeding to once every seven years (a reference to the Vulcan blood fever of mating, called Pon farr), commenting that this would mean much less breeding for most, but for him, \\"much, much more\\". He is a virgin well into his forties, but becomes sexually and romantically involved with Principal Skinner's mother Agnes. He later dates Edna Krabappel after she leaves Skinner at the altar. They are nearly married at a science fiction convention with Skinner trying to stop the wedding, but Edna changes her mind, preferring not to be tied down to a relationship. Comic Book Guy is not particularly surprised by this, saying, \\"There are a million valid reasons, but which one did you pick?\\" When Edna gently explains \\"It's like I'm DC Comics, and you're Marvel\\", he accepts the comparison without any rancor. In \\"Married to the Blob\\" Comic Book Guy marries Kumiko Nakamura, a Japanese manga artist. =The Android's Dungeon= The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop Comic Book Guy is the owner of The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop, a local comic book store. The comics, collectibles, and toys he sells are of wildly varying quality and often have very high prices. His store is his sanctuary, where he holds some level of self-esteem, imperiously lording over pre-teen kids, like Bart Simpson and Milhouse Van Houten, using a heavily sarcastic tone and often banning certain customers for minor infractions. His store contains a lower level full of illegal videos (which include Mr. Rogers drunk, Alien autopsy, Illegal Alien Autopsy, a \\"good version\\" of The Godfather Part III, and Kent Brockman picking his nose). In \\"Husbands and Knives\\", the store was closed due to bankruptcy when a rival comic book shop opened across the road, run by an owner with significantly better customer service and social skills. Although his old store was bought by Marge Simpson in the same episode and not returned, Comic Book Guy continues running his store in future episodes and the rival store is usually not mentioned, though it was referred to again when its owner showed up in \\"Married to the Blob\\". Character =Creation= Comic Book Guy was partly inspired by a clerk at the Los Angeles comic book shop who often \\"[sat] on the high stool, kind of lording over the store with that supercilious attitude and eating behind the counter a big Styrofoam container full of fried clams with a lot of tartar sauce.\\" Groening noted: Azaria based Comic Book Guy's voice on a college contemporary named Mark who went by the nickname \\"F\\", short for \\"Flounder\\" from the movie National Lampoon's Animal House, and lived in the room next door to him at Tufts University. Hank Azaria further explained that \\"F\\" would listen to the song \\"867-5309\\" all day long and that Mark would keep a list of top five and bottom five people who he liked and hated in the dorm and post it hourly. Azaria stated that he himself was always on the bottom five of the list because he complained about the playing of the music.Azaria, Hank (2004). Commentary for \\"Homer's Barbershop Quartet\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Azaria \\"loves that the character is an adult who argues with kids as if they're his peers.\\" =Development= Within the series, the character Comic Book Guy is often used to represent a stereotypical inhabitant of the newsgroup alt.tv.simpsons. The first such instance occurred in the seventh-season episode \\"Radioactive Man\\", in which Comic Book Guy is logging on to his favorite newsgroup alt.nerd.obsessive.Turner, p. 282 David X. Cohen often read alt.tv.simpsons to gauge audience response to episodes. He decided to lampoon the passion and the fickleness of the fans. In the eighth-season episode \\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\\" after Comic Book Guy views the Itchy & Scratchy episode featuring Poochie, he immediately goes on the Internet and writes, \\"Worst episode ever\\" on a message board; a commentary on how the active audience nitpicks the episode. The writers respond by using the voice of Bart Simpson:Alberti, pp. 147‚Äì148 The catchphrase further appears on his T-shirt in the eleventh season episode \\"Saddlesore Galactica\\", and as the title of the twelfth season episode \\"Worst Episode Ever\\". The catchphrase can also be used for describing other things by saying, \\"Worst. (Noun). Ever.\\" =Name= A long-running gag on the show was never to reveal the character's name, with other characters referring to him as \\"Comic Book Guy\\". The writers had intended to name the character as early as his first episode, but they could not think of a name for him, and they called him \\"Comic Book Guy\\", with the intention of naming the character the next time they used him.Reiss, Mike (2002). Commentary for \\"Three Men and a Comic Book\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. However, they continually procrastinated. Finally, in the February 6, 2005 episode, \\"Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass\\", Comic Book Guy nonchalantly tells Ned Flanders: \\"My name is Jeff Albertson, but everyone calls me 'Comic Book Guy'\\". Showrunner Al Jean remarked: \\"That was specifically done to make people really mad. We just tried to pick a generic name. It was also the Super Bowl show. We did it so the most people possible would see it.\\" Groening stated that he had originally intended him to be called Louis Lane and be \\"obsessed and tormented by\\" Lois Lane, but Groening was not present when the writers chose the name. His name is also mentioned in The Simpsons Game. Reception Hank Azaria has won several Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his work on The Simpsons, winning one in 2001 for voicing Comic Book Guy and various other characters in the episode \\"Worst Episode Ever\\". Merchandising and other media Comic Book Guy is featured on the cover of the twelfth season DVD. He appears on other media as well, including T-shirts and drinking glasses. In The Simpsons Game, he explains all the clich√©s that the player comes across during the game. Comic Book Guy has appeared in his own five-part comic book, in which his death influenced a nerd and geek gang war. The Simpsons Library of Wisdom includes a volume entitled \\"Comic Book Guy's Book of Pop Culture\\". Comic Book Guy appears in Hit and Run as a drivable character, the host for bonus mission level four and host for a level seven mission. He is also a passenger in Road Rage. Comic Book Guy makes a cameo appearance in the season two finale of The Cleveland Show saying the line, \\"Worst. Cameo.

He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta and first appeared in the series premiere episode \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\". Barney is the town drunk of Springfield and Homer Simpson's best friend. His loud belches and desperation for alcohol serve as frequent sources of humor on the show, though Barney sobered up in the Season 11 episode \\"Days of Wine and D'oh'ses\\". Barney was inspired by the cartoon character Barney Rubble from The Flintstones and by several barflies from other television programs. In 2004, Castellaneta won an Emmy Award for voicing various characters, including Barney. Barney can be seen in The Simpsons opening credits since 2009, passed out under a pile of leaves (but still holding his beloved bottle of Duff Beer) and being awoken by Bart Simpson skateboarding over his stomach, causing him to let out his trademark belch. Role in The Simpsons Barney's father, Arnie Gumble, was a World War II veteran who died in 1979 in a parade float accident. Little is known about his mother, except that she lives in Norway and that she served in the United States Navy, including duty on a submarine.

Two episodes give different reasons for his alcoholism. \\"Mr. Plow\\" suggests that Barney was a dedicated student looking forward to a bright future. He had his mind set on going to Harvard University, until Homer introduced him to beer the day before the SATs. Season 16's \\"She Used to Be My Girl\\" attributes his drinking to his high school girlfriend Chloe Talbot leaving Springfield to pursue a journalism career. In \\"Homer's Barbershop Quartet\\", Barney formed a barbershop quartet with Homer, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, and Seymour Skinner called the Be Sharps. Barney was asked to join when the other members heard him singing in a beautiful tenor voice in the restroom of Moe's Tavern, replacing the group's original fourth member, Chief Wiggum, who was kicked out. In 1986, the Be Sharps won a Grammy Award for Outstanding Soul, Spoken Word, or Barbershop Album of the Year. Soon, creative disputes arose, and Barney left the group in all but name when he began dating a Japanese conceptual artist. The group realized that they were no longer popular and split up. Barney was rescued from a tar pit by Bart's pet elephant Stampy in \\"Bart Gets an Elephant\\" and he also started a snowplowing business rivaling Homer's in \\"Mr. Plow\\". Barney's commercial defamed Homer, causing Homer to lose his customers. As revenge, Homer fooled Barney into plowing a driveway on Widow's Peak, a treacherous mountain just outside Springfield. When Homer saw a news report showing that Barney had become trapped in an avalanche, Homer immediately drove to the mountain and rescued Barney. The friends resolved their differences and agreed to work together. However, a heat wave hit Springfield at that exact moment, driving them both out of business. However, in the episodes \\"O Brother, Where Bart Thou?\\" and \\"Miracle on Evergreen Terrace\\" it is shown that Barney still drives his Plow King truck. After being forced to spend a sober night at Moe's Tavern serving as designated driver, Barney left town in Homer Simpson's car to, among other things, give a guest lecture at Villanova (although, by his own admission, the guest lecture could just have likely occurred on a street corner). A gag in \\"Selma's Choice\\" suggests that Barney is the father of many local babies born through (presumably, paid) donation of semen and the resulting artificial insemination. Barney made a documentary film about his life as an alcoholic, titled Pukahontas. It won the top prize at the Springfield Film Festival. He was ready to quit drinking after winning the Festival, but unfortunately, the prize he received was a lifetime supply of Duff Beer. In \\"Deep Space Homer\\", Barney trained to become an astronaut for NASA. Under their alcohol-ban, he quickly regained his balance and diction and was quite appropriately selected to fly with Buzz Aldrin. However, he reverted to his old ways when he was presented with a bottle of non-alcoholic champagne. Barney served in the United States Navy Reserve as a submariner on the USS Jebediah, alongside his mother, in \\"Simpson Tide\\". In \\"Days of Wine and D'oh'ses\\", after watching a video of his drunken antics at his birthday party, Barney resolves to get sober. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, cleans up his appearance, and attends helicopter-flying lessons. It was revealed in the fourteenth season episode \\"I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can\\" that he had relapsed. Character =Creation= Barney was inspired by Barney Rubble, Fred Flintstone's best friend and next-door neighbor from the animated series The Flintstones.Groening, Matt (2001). Commentary for \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The writers originally wanted the character to be Homer Simpson's sidekick and next-door neighbor, but instead, while still portraying him as Homer's best friend, they decided to make him an alcoholic. Ned Flanders would become the next-door neighbor instead. \\"Barney was taking the standard sitcom sidekick and just making him as pathetic as possible,\\" said Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons. The writers drew further inspiration from Crazy Guggenheim, a character played by comedian Frank Fontaine on The Jackie Gleason Show. Part of the reason the writers went in that direction, according to Groening, was because of \\"a sort of unspoken rule about not having drinking on television as a source of comedy. So, of course, we went right for it.\\" The writers also patterned the character after Norm Peterson (George Wendt), a character from the sitcom Cheers.Castellaneta, Dan; Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Moore, Rich; Reiss, Mike; Silverman, David (2003). Commentary for \\"Flaming Moe's\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In some early first season episodes, Barney had yellow hair. Later in the production of that season, the producers had it changed to brown, because they thought that his hair looked like his skin;Jean, Al (2001). Commentary for \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. as well, during an artistic convention of the show, Groening stated that he wanted only the Simpsons to have yellow hair. Animation director Rich Moore modeled Barney's apartment on one he and several other animators who worked on the show shared, particularly the Farrah Fawcett poster and the cable spool table.Moore, Rich (2001). Commentary for \\"Homer's Night Out\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The writers originally intended for the character to be the owner of Barney's Bowl-A-Rama.Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Silverman, David (2001). Commentary for \\"Life on the Fast Lane\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. However, after making him \\"pathetic\\", they could not regard him as a business owner any longer, and it was explained seasons later in \\"And Maggie Makes Three\\" that his Uncle Al owns the alley and named it after him.Groening, Matt; Silverman, David (2005). Commentary for \\"And Maggie Makes Three\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. =Voice= Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Barney. Barney Gumble is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. Early on the show, Castellaneta discovered that it was not easy for him to do Barney's trademark belch every time a script called for it, so he identified his best belch and told the producers to make that the standard.Jean, Al (2002). Commentary for \\"Blood Feud\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Castellaneta has voiced Barney every time he has appeared in the series, with the exception of the episode \\"Homer's Barbershop Quartet\\", in which some of Barney's singing is provided by a member of The Dapper Dans, who recorded lines for all four members of the Be Sharps. Their recordings were intermixed with the cast's, often with a cast member singing the melody and the Dapper Dans providing backup.Martin, Jeff; Reiss, Mike (2004). Commentary for \\"Homer's Barbershop Quartet\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. =Sobriety= Castellaneta thought of the idea of Barney sobering up early in the series. He wrote a script together with his wife Deb Lacusta. They offered their script to showrunner Al Jean. Jean liked the story, but felt that it was too similar to a script the writers were already working on, \\"Duffless\\", so he turned it down. Castellaneta and Lacusta waited several years and offered their script, which they updated, to then-show runner Mike Scully, who liked it and had them make a few changes.Affleck, Neil; Castellaneta, Dan; Lacusta, Deb; Maxtone- Graham, Ian; Meyer, George; Scully, Mike (2008). Commentary for \\"Days of Wine and D'oh'ses\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Their script became the eleventh season episode \\"Days of Wine and D'oh'ses\\", which first aired April 9, 2000. The episode was directed by Neil Affleck, who said that he had \\"a vested interest in getting Barney sober.\\" However, some of the writing staff was opposed to the episode as they felt Barney sober would not be funny. Castellaneta commented, \\"He's still a goofy man-child...he's still got 15 years of booze left in his veins.\\" After a long discussion about how the episode should end, the writers decided that they did not want Barney to return to being drunk at the end of the episode. Barney stayed sober for several seasons. The animators modified the appearance of the character, straightening his hair, among other things, to indicate his sobriety. Castellaneta altered his voice for the character by no longer slurring. Barney was still seen at Moe's Tavern, but only drinking lattes. The character's new addiction to coffee was suggested by writer-producer David Mirkin, who has friends who stopped drinking alcohol and became addicted to coffee. Reception Filmcritic.com ranked Barney 18th on their 2008 list of \\"The 21 Best Movie Alcoholics of All Time\\". Recognizing the character for his appearance in The Simpsons Movie, Filmcritic called him \\"the most awesomely funny town drunk in pop culture\\". IGN ranked Barney fifth on their list of the \\"Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters\\" in 2006, stating that, \\"he's been a dependable source of humor through his many drunken asides, burps included...Occasionally he's sobered up...But let's face it, for comedy's sake, The Simpsons is better off with a drunken Barney mouthing off at Moe's.\\" Author Chris Turner (Planet Simpson) said, \\"Making [Barney] sober falls into the trap of all the stuff The Simpsons satirizes, all those simple sitcom narratives where everything is wrapped up in half an hour and everyone learns a lesson in the end.\\" Britain's The Guardian said that Barney \\"should be hailed for making compulsive drinking a source of comedy on US TV, a hitherto impossible dream.\\" Entertainment Weekly placed \\"Mr. Plow\\" sixth on their list of the best 25 Simpsons episodes in 2003. In 2004, Dan Castellaneta won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for voicing several characters, including Barney, in the episode \\"Today I Am a Clown\\". \\"Days of Wine and D'oh'ses\\" was nominated for a PRISM Award in 2001. =Merchandising= Playmates Toys created three Barney Gumble action figures as part of the World of Springfield toy line. The first one, released in August 2000, depicts Barney in his usual appearance. The second, Barney in his Plow King jacket from \\"Mr. Plow\\", was released in January 2003. The third, a Toys \\"R\\" Us retail exclusive, was released in July 2003 as part of a Be Sharps play set. The song \\"A Boozehound named Barney\\" from the episode \\"Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious\\" was included on the Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons album. Barney plays a role in The Simpsons Ride, launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood.

He is an Indian-American immigrant proprietor who runs the Kwik-E- Mart, a popular convenience store in Springfield, and is best known for his catchphrase, \\"Thank you, come again.\\" He was voiced by Hank Azaria and first appeared in the episode \\"The Telltale Head\\". A 2017 documentary, The Problem with Apu, written by and starring comedian Hari Kondabolu, critiqued the character as being a South Asian stereotype, which later led to Azaria announcing he was stepping down as the voice of the character so long as he maintains his current personality. However, Azaria also acknowledged that he does not have control over the character's future and that the decision was made in unison with the Simpsons production crew. Simpsons creator Matt Groening stated in August 2019 that Apu will remain on the show. Role in The Simpsons =Biography= In the episode \\"Homer and Apu\\", Apu says he is from Rahmatpur, West Bengal. Apu is a naturalized US citizen, and holds a Ph.D. in computer science. He graduated first in his class of seven million at 'Caltech' ‚Äì Calcutta Technical Institute ‚Äì going on to earn his doctorate at the Springfield Heights Institute of Technology (S.H.I.T.). Apu began working at the Kwik-E-Mart during graduate school to pay off his student loan, he stayed afterwards as he enjoyed his job and the friends he had made. He remained an illegal immigrant until Mayor Quimby proposed a municipal law to expel all undocumented aliens. Apu responded by purchasing a forged birth certificate from the Springfield Mafia that listed his parents as American citizens Herb and Judy Nahasapeemapetilon from Green Bay, Wisconsin, but when he realized he was forsaking his origins, he abandoned this plan and instead successfully managed to pass his citizenship test with help from Lisa and Homer Simpson. Thus, he refers to himself as a \\"semi-legal alien\\". In 1985, Apu was a member of the barbershop quartet The Be Sharps, along with Homer Simpson, Barney Gumble, and Principal Seymour Skinner. Upon the advice of the band manager Nigel, Apu took the stage name \\"Apu de Beaumarchais\\" (a reference to Pierre Beaumarchais, author of The Barber of Seville). Apu is a vegan, as revealed in the season 7 episode \\"Lisa the Vegetarian\\". =Family= In the episode \\"The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons\\", Apu enjoys a brief period as Springfield's leading ladies' man after being spontaneously drawn into a bachelor auction. He spends the days following the auction on a whirlwind of dates, which suddenly end when his mother announces his arranged marriage to a woman named Manjula, whom he had not seen since childhood. Apu tries to get out of the arrangement at first, with Marge Simpson pretending to be his wife, until Apu's mother finds her with Homer. However, he is won over when he meets Manjula at the wedding, and the two decide to give the marriage a try, with Manjula noting nonchalantly that they can always get a divorce. Later, the two actually fall in love. In the episode \\"Eight Misbehavin'\\", Manjula receives too many doses of fertility drugs, leading to her giving birth to octuplets: Anoop, Uma, Nabendu, Poonam, Priya, Sandeep, Sashi, and Gheet. This causes difficulties for the family but finally they decide to get on with their life. During the episode \\"Bart-Mangled Banner\\", when the town changes its name to Libertyville to be patriotic after it is claimed Springfield hates America, Apu temporarily changes his children's names to Lincoln, Freedom, Condoleezza, Coke, Pepsi, Manifest Destiny, Apple Pie, and Superman. Apu and Manjula have a mostly happy marriage, despite understandable marital problems caused by Apu's workaholic nature and long hours, and the strain of caring for eight children. A further strain came up when Apu was unfaithful to Manjula, causing him to briefly move out and even making him contemplate suicide. He and his family are devout Hindus, and he particularly venerates Ganesha.\\"I have a shrine to Ganesha, the god of worldly wisdom, located in the employee lounge.\\" Sanjay (voiced by Harry Shearer), Apu's brother, helps run the Kwik-E-Mart. Sanjay has a daughter named Pahasatira, and a son named Jamshed, all of whom share the Nahasapeemapetilon surname. Apu has another younger brother, who is only mentioned in \\"The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons\\", where Apu was shown on a chart as the oldest of three. Apu also has a cousin living in India named Kavi, also voiced by Azaria, who helped Homer while he was in India. Kavi works for several American companies taking service calls using General American, cowboy, and Jamaican accents. =Other appearances= Apu is a playable character in The Simpsons: Hit & Run video game. His quest in the game is to redeem himself for unknowingly selling the tainted Buzz Cola that has made the residents of Springfield insane. Apu also makes an appearance in The Simpsons: Road Rage as a passenger and unlockable playable character. He also is a character players acquire fairly early on in the open-ended online game The Simpsons: Tapped Out. Character Hank Azaria voiced Apu from the start of the show until 2020, when he stepped down Apu first appeared in the season one episode \\"The Telltale Head\\". Al Jean and Mike Reiss claim that while creating the character, the writers decided they would not make him ethnic, as they felt it would be too offensive and stereotypical and did not want to offend viewers, but that the concept stayed because Hank Azaria's reading of the line \\"Hello, Mr. Homer\\" received a huge laugh from the writers. Azaria, however, has disputed this account, claiming instead that the writers asked him to create a stereotypical Indian accent for the character. Azaria has said that he based Apu's voice on Indian convenience store workers in Los Angeles with whom he had interacted when he first moved to the area. He also loosely based it on Peter Sellers' character Hrundi V. Bakshi from the film The Party, whom Azaria thinks has a similar personality to Apu. Apu's first name is an homage to the main character in The Apu Trilogy directed by Satyajit Ray. His surname is Nahasapeemapetilon, and it was first used in the episode \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\". It is a morphophonological blend of the name \\"Pahasadee Napetilon\\", the full name of a schoolmate of Simpsons writer Jeff Martin. Apu marries Manjula in the episode \\"The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons\\". Rich Appel first constructed the idea for Apu's marriage. Andrea Martin provided the voice of Apu's mother in the episode, recording her part in New York. She wanted to get the voice perfect, so in between takes she listened to tapes of Azaria reading lines for Apu, to make sure her voice could realistically be Apu's mother's. Reception and criticism =Popularity= Apu is one of the most prominent South Asian characters on primetime television in the United States. Hank Azaria has won three Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance, winning in 1998 for his performance as Apu, again in 2001 for \\"Worst Episode Ever\\", and a third time in 2003 for \\"Moe Baby Blues\\" for voicing several characters, including Apu. Apu's image has been widely licensed, on items ranging from board games to auto air fresheners. In July 2007, convenience store chain 7-Eleven converted 11 of its stores in the United States and one in Canada into Kwik-E-Marts to celebrate the release of The Simpsons Movie. =Accusations of racial stereotyping= It has been argued that the portrayal of this character is a racist caricature. During the aforementioned 7-Eleven promotion in 2007, some members of the Indian-American community voiced concerns that Apu is a caricature that plays on too many negative stereotypes. Despite this, 7-Eleven reported that many of its Indian employees reacted positively to the idea, but noted that it was \\"not a 100 percent endorsement\\". Comedian Hari Kondabolu criticized Apu as a negative stereotype of Indians, and made the documentary The Problem with Apu. According to Hari Kondabolu, in a Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell web exclusive segment, there is a negative reaction to Apu in the Indian American community, as well as the greater South Asian diaspora community. Pakistani-American comedian and actor Kumail Nanjiani has also criticized the character, and has related that early in his career, he was asked to do the \\"Apu accent\\" as a stereotypical version of the \\"Indian accent\\". In a 2007 interview, Azaria acknowledged some of this criticism when he recalled a conversation with the writers of the show during the inception of the character: \\"Right away they were like 'Can you do an Indian accent and how offensive can you make it?' basically. I was like, 'It's not tremendously accurate. It's a little, uh, stereotype,' and they were like, 'Eh, that's all right.'\\" In a 2013 interview with The Huffington Post, Azaria said it should not be expected that the character's accent would \\"suddenly change now\\" or that the character would be written out, saying, \\"I'd be surprised if [the show's writers] write him any less frequently because he's offensive.\\" In 2016, Kondabolu announced his intention to produce a documentary about \\"how this controversial caricature was created, burrowed its way into the hearts and minds of Americans and continues to exist ‚Äì intact ‚Äì twenty-six years later.\\" In 2017, Kondabolu released the hour-long documentary The Problem with Apu. In the film, Kondabolu interviews other actors and comics of South Asian heritage about the impact that the character of Apu has had on their lives and the perception of South Asians in American culture. In April 2018, in the episode \\"No Good Read Goes Unpunished\\", The Simpsons reacted to the controversy surrounding Apu. The episode sees Marge introduce Lisa to her favorite childhood book, but is then shocked by its racist stereotypes and attempts to rewrite it to suit modern sensitivities. Lisa is bored by this revised version, and Marge asks what she should do; Lisa replies \\"It's hard to say. Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do?\\" She then looks at a picture of Apu with \\"Don't have a cow, man\\" written on it, and the two characters say that the issue will be dealt with later, if at all. Kondabolu said that he was saddened by the show's dismissive take on the controversy. Mike Reiss, The Simpsons' longtime writer and producer, acknowledged the problem, and pointed out that Apu had not had a line in the show for the last three years. On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Azaria said that he would be \\"perfectly willing to step aside\\" from the role of voicing Apu, saying that he was increasingly worried about the character causing harm by reinforcing stereotypes and that \\"the most important thing is to listen to Indian people and their experience with it ... I really want to see Indian, South Asian writers in the writers' room, genuinely informing whichever direction this character takes.\\" Kondabolu had a positive reaction to Azaria's comments. In an interview with USA Today, creator Matt Groening dismissed the criticism of the Apu character, saying, \\"I think it's a time in our culture where people love to pretend they're offended\\". Dana Walden, the CEO of 20th Century Fox Television, said in an August 2018 interview in regard to the Apu controversy that the network trusts the showrunners \\"to handle it in the way that's best for the show\\". In October 2018, in the South Park episode \\"The Problem with a Poo\\", Mr. Hankey is expelled and sent to a land where \\"people don't care about bigotry and hate\\" ‚Äì Springfield. The episode ended with a title card, #cancelthesimpsons, similar to the promo for South Park which called for the cancellation of itself. However, on the DVD commentary South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone stated that the people on The Simpsons are their friends and that joke wasn't a jab at The Simpsons but at the documentary and that they found it amusing how many misinterpreted the joke as an attack on The Simpsons. Al Jean also tweeted about the episode \\"It's actually in favor of us saying people are too critical.\\" Hugo Rifkind bemoaned in The Times the prevalent attitude to confect offense ‚Äì nobody needs to be actually offended, the possibility that somebody might be offended is enough. He also points out that Apu is portrayed very positively ‚Äì bar Lisa, he is smarter than everyone else, and that the show was much ruder about many other characters, e.g. Ned Flanders, Krusty and Groundskeeper Willie. On October 26, Adi Shankar stated in an interview with IndieWire that Apu would be leaving The Simpsons. On October 29, executive producer Al Jean responded to the speculation, stating \\"Adi Shankar does not speak for our show\\". On August 27, 2019, several sources reported that Groening had confirmed Apu's continued position on the show during the Simpsons panel at Disney's D23 Expo, telling a fan who asked whether or not Apu would remain \\"Yes. We love Apu. We're proud of Apu.\\" Azaria announced on January 17, 2020, that he and the production team agreed to allow him to step away from voicing Apu, \\"unless there's some way to transition it or something\\". Azaria had followed the debate over the previous years since Kondabolu's essay and documentary, and had read up on and attended seminars on racism and social consciousness, and spoke to Indian-American colleagues including fellow actor Utkarsh Ambudkar (who had performed as Apu's nephew in \\"Much Apu About Something\\") about the situation. He came to understand the issues around the character of Apu compared to the other stereotypical characters on The Simpsons was the idea of permissible use, leading to his decision to quit voicing Apu. Azaria said, \\"There hasn't been an outcry over these characters because people feel they're represented. They don't take it so personally, nor do they feel oppressed or insulted by it.\\" While Azaria will no longer voice the character, Groening confirmed that Apu will remain on The Simpsons.

He is voiced by Harry Shearer, and first appeared in the episode \\"The Telltale Head\\". Rev. Lovejoy is the minister at The First Church of Springfield‚Äîthe Protestant church in Springfield. Initially kind-hearted and ambitious, Lovejoy has become somewhat apathetic towards others because of Ned Flanders's constant asinine scrupulosity. Role in The Simpsons =Profile= Lovejoy is the pastor of the Western Branch of American Reform Presbylutheranism First Church of Springfield, which most of the show's characters regularly attend. He attended Texas Christian University.\\"Wedding for Disaster\\" He initially came to Springfield in the 1970s as an eager, enthusiastic, young man,In \\"Faith Off\\" he uses an electric guitar in the church to compete against Bart's faith healing musical show. only to become cynical and disillusioned about his ministry, mostly due to Ned Flanders, who constantly pesters him with minor issues such as \\"coveting his own wife\\" or thinking that he \\"swallowed a toothpick\\". Lovejoy would deal with Flanders' concerns very briefly, so that he could return to playing with his model trains. At one point, Lovejoy \\"just stopped caring\\",\\"In Marge We Trust\\" but rediscovered the joy of helping others, though Ned still irritates him. Lovejoy even suggests Ned join another religion, as \\"they are all pretty much the same\\". In the season two episode \\"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\\", Lovejoy helps Lisa with her family's illegal cable hookup. His sermons vary between dreary recitations of more opaque parts of the Old Testament, to the occasional \\"fire and brimstone\\" about Hell. =Tolerance= His tolerant side is demonstrated when he performs a Hindu marriage ceremony for Kwik-E-Mart shopkeeper Apu (though Lovejoy does not know much about the faith, referring to it in an earlier episode as \\"Miscellaneous\\"), co-hosts a religious radio program with Krusty the Klown's rabbi father, and admits evolution may be true. However, Lovejoy can also be intolerant. When Lisa Simpson converted to Buddhism, he referred to her as \\"Marge Simpson's devil-daughter\\". He appears bitter about the tall Episcopal church across the street, wanting to build a larger steeple, and when mentioning the other church, placing the emphasis on \\"pis\\". He maintains two rolodexes ‚Äì one for Christians, and one for non- Christians.Episode #8F05 Like Father Like Clown, Airdate October 24, 1991 While he seems to have originally accepted evolution, he later takes up the creationist cause to bolster his church's membership. He is especially intolerant of the Roman Catholic Church as he is shown brawling with a priest. He tells Marge that he might as well do a Voodoo dance for Abe Simpson when asked to give him the last rites. He also helps kidnap Bart to keep him from converting to Catholicism. Lovejoy also claims in There's Something About Marrying to various same-sex couple who arrive at his church to get married that \\"while I have no opinion for or against your sinful lifestyle, I cannot marry two people of the same sex anymore than I could put a hamburger on a hot dog bun\\" and tells them to \\"go back to behind the scenes of every facade of entertainment.\\" When Marge objects, Lovejoy tells her the Bible forbids same- sex relationships, but when Marge asks which book in Bible forbids it, he merely claims \\"The Bible\\" and then continuously rings the church bell after Marge continues to press him on the matter. =Negative qualities= Lovejoy has been shown to do things that would be considered sinful. Lovejoy has been known to exploit his congregation for money, brawl with a Roman Catholic priest, encourage his pet Old English Sheepdog to foul Ned Flanders's lawn, and implied that he once burned down his church for insurance money. In \\"Whacking Day\\", he made up a passage in the Bible to attempt to convince Lisa that \\"even God himself endorses Whacking Day\\". In \\"The Joy of Sect\\", the episode in which the whole town of Springfield is deceived into joining a cult, Lovejoy kidnaps Homer with Groundskeeper Willie from the cult and hits him across the head numerous times hoping to knock him out. Also, when Lovejoy sees the spaceship emerge from the \\"forbidden barn\\" he throws his religious collar on the ground. After it is revealed that the spaceship is fake, Ned Flanders notices his collar on the ground and informs Lovejoy, who picks it up and puts it back on. Lovejoy is not always enthusiastic about the Bible, calling it a \\"2000-page sleeping pill\\". It is unsure if he even owns a Bible, as it was once said he borrows one from the library every week. However, he can exactly quote even obscure passages from memory. In \\"Secrets of a Successful Marriage,\\" an episode that dealt with marriage counseling, Lovejoy and his gossipy wife, Helen, both recommend that Marge should divorce Homer. Marge objects to this, pointing out how the Bible has strict guidelines against things like divorce, but Lovejoy says, \\"Marge, everything is a sin. (holds up the Bible) Have you ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not allowed to go to the bathroom.\\" =Family= Lovejoy's wife Helen was originally portrayed as a moralistic, judgmental gossip, but in voice actress Maggie Roswell's long absence, her character was seen but not heard. The Lovejoys' manipulative daughter Jessica was the focus of the episode \\"Bart's Girlfriend\\" where she was voiced by guest star Meryl Streep, but is otherwise rarely seen. Lovejoy's father is briefly shown in the episode \\"Bart After Dark\\" as an older version of Lovejoy (including clerical collar) who visits the Maison Derri√®re. Creation and Reception Matt Groening has indicated that Lovejoy is named after Lovejoy Street (which in turn is named for Portland co-founder Asa Lovejoy)Corning, Howard M.

When the character was created, producer Sam Simon did not want Lovejoy to be a \\"cartoony hypocritical preacher\\" but rather \\"a realistic person who just happened to work as a minister,\\" as recalled by writer Al Jean. By season eight, the show had begun to explore secondary characters with Lovejoy being the central character in the episode \\"In Marge We Trust\\" because, aside from being noted as \\"the priest who didn't care\\", he had not had much character development. Author Mark I. Pinsky writes of Lovejoy as \\"a foil in the series, personifying many of the failings of organized religion and Christian conservatism,\\" and yet still a real human with faults and not simply evil.

Character development  Hank Azaria His surname \\"Wiggum\\" is Matt Groening's mother's maiden name. As \\"a conscious pun\\", Wiggum was designed to look like a pig. Hank Azaria first based his voice for Wiggum on David Brinkley, but it was too slow and he switched it to an Edward G. Robinson impression.  Biography  Chief Wiggum is of Irish descent.See \\"In the Name of the Grandfather\\" Per the episode \\"Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in \\"The Curse of the Flying Hellfish\\"\\", Wiggum's father Iggy served in Abe Simpson's infantry squad, implying the Wiggums emigrated to America by the early 1940s at the latest. In the episode \\"Mother Simpson\\", a teenaged Wiggum was a trainee security guard at Springfield University when Homer's mother Mona sabotaged the University's laboratory, which Mr. Burns was using for biological weapons. Antibiotics used to kill the weapons cured Wiggum's asthma, allowing him to join the police force. Many episodes have dealt with the back story of how Wiggum, despite his incompetence, occupies such a high rank in the police force. As with those of most supporting characters on the show, they are jokes for one episode and contradict each other. Wiggum was temporarily promoted to Commissioner of Police for Springfield's state in the 2005 episode \\"Pranksta Rap\\". He also appeared on Halloween novel depicting Stranger Things as chief Jim Hopper. = Positive qualities = Despite his severe incompetence at his occupation, Wiggum on occasion has helped various other characters, such as helping Homer find his wife in \\"Marge on the Lam\\". He rescued Maggie Simpson when she ran away from home to look for Marge in \\"Homer Alone\\", by helping Lisa Simpson find Mr. Burns' assailant in \\"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\\" as well as helping backing her up in a school protest on one occasion in \\"The President Wore Pearls\\". In the episode \\"Pranksta Rap\\" he manages to find the presumed kidnapped Bart Simpson in Kirk Van Houten's apartment. He also arrived just in time during crucial moments such as the various times Sideshow Bob had attempted to kill Bart Simpson. Wiggum is also shown to be a loving father of his son Ralph. Perhaps the best example of this is the episode \\"Mother Simpson\\", where it is implied that he leads the FBI astray in their search for Mona Simpson, allowing her to escape in gratitude for curing his asthma. Although Wiggum can often antagonize others as well, it is heavily implied that it is not out of malice but merely because he is doing his job or because he is ignorant of the situation.

Origins and variants  The surname is a variant of two Irish surnames: \\"√ì Murchadha\\"/\\"√ì Murchadh\\" (descendant of \\"Murchadh\\"), and \\"Mac Murchaidh\\"/\\"Mac Murchadh\\" (son of \\"Murchadh\\") derived from the Irish personal name \\"Murchadh\\", which meant sea-warrior or sea- battler (muir meaning sea and cath meaning battle). It is said of Murrough (Murchadh) as he entered the thick of the fight and prepared to assail the foreign invaders, the Danes, when they had repulsed the Dal-Cais, that 'he was seized with a boiling terrible anger, an excessive elevation and greatness of spirit and mind. A bird of valour and championship rose in him, and fluttered over his head and on his breath. In modern Irish, \\"√ì Murch√∫\\", rather than \\"√ì Murchadha\\", is used. \\"Murphy\\" is the most common surname in Ireland, the fourteenth most common surname in Northern Ireland, and the fifty-eighth most common surname in the United States.

He was originally voiced by Phil Hartman and first appeared in the second season episode \\"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment.\\" McClure is an actor who is usually shown doing low-level work, such as hosting infomercials and educational films. He appears as the main character in \\"A Fish Called Selma,\\" in which he marries Selma Bouvier to aid his failing career and quash rumors about his personal life. McClure also \\"hosts\\" \\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\\" and \\"The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase.\\" McClure was partially based on B movie actors Troy Donahue and Doug McClure, as well as Hartman himself. Following Hartman's murder at the hands of his wife in 1998, two of his Simpsons characters were retired, with Hartman's final appearance as McClure occurring in the tenth season episode \\"Bart the Mother\\" four months later. Since his retirement, McClure has often been cited as one of the series' most popular characters. In 2006, IGN ranked McClure No. 1 on their list of the \\"Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters.\\" Role in The Simpsons Troy McClure is a stereotypical Hollywood has-been. He was a star in the early 1970s, but his career went downhill due to rumors of a paraphilia involving fish. In most of his appearances in the show, he hosts short video clips that other characters watch on television or in a public place. He often presents educational videos and infomercials. McClure introduces himself by saying, \\"Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such [films, educational videos, voiceovers, etc.] as...,\\" mentioning two titles that are similar to his current performance. For example, in the episode \\"Bart the Mother,\\" McClure introduces a film about birds by saying, \\"Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such nature films as Earwigs: Eww! and Man vs. Nature: The Road to Victory.\\" McClure's most prominent role occurs in the seventh- season episode \\"A Fish Called Selma.\\" In the episode, McClure begins a relationship with Selma Bouvier, whom he meets when she gives him an eye test at the Department of Motor Vehicles. The relationship revives his career, leading him to star in Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off!, a stage musical version of the film Planet of the Apes. To further boost McClure's career, McClure's agent suggests that he get married. Unaware of McClure's motivation, Selma accepts his proposal, and moves into McClure's house, a Modernist building which resembles the Chemosphere. At his bachelor party, a drunken McClure tells Homer Simpson that the marriage is just a sham to help his career. Homer says nothing at the wedding, but later offhandedly mentions McClure's admission to Marge, who then informs her sister. Selma decides to remain with McClure anyway, but she becomes disturbed when McClure's agent advises the pair to have a child (since \\"all the big parts these days are going to family men\\"). Having a child will secure McClure's casting as McBain's sidekick in McBain IV: Fatal Discharge, but Selma is unwilling to bring a child into a loveless relationship and decides to leave McClure. McClure ultimately gets the role, but turns it down in order to direct and star in his own pet project, a 20th Century Fox film called The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel. In addition to his in- story appearances, McClure appears as host of \\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\\" and \\"The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase.\\" The first is a behind-the- scenes look at The Simpsons, answering questions and featuring extra \\"never- before-seen\\" material. The second is an episode presenting three possible spin-offs from The Simpsons. =In other media= McClure was made into an action figure as part of the World of Springfield toy line, and was released in the \\"Celebrity Series 1\\" wave. He also features briefly in the video game Virtual Springfield, introducing the town of Springfield to the player. Character =Creation= Phil Hartman voiced Troy McClure McClure was based on the typical \\"washed up\\" Hollywood actor. B movie actors Troy Donahue and Doug McClure served as inspiration for his name and certain character aspects. Doug McClure found the homage funny and his children called him \\"Troy McClure\\" when his back was turned. According to show creator Matt Groening, Phil Hartman was cast in the role due to his ability to pull \\"the maximum amount of humor\\" out of any line he was given. McClure's visual appearance is similar to that of Hartman himself. When he was designed, McClure was given an extra line under his eyes to suggest that the character had gotten a facelift.Bird, Brad. (2003). Commentary for \\"Homer Alone,\\" in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In a very brief appearance in the season 2 episode Bart's Dog Gets an \\"F\\", Troy was voiced by Dan Castellaneta. =Development= According to executive producer Al Jean, the writers often used McClure as a \\"panic button\\" and added the character when they felt an episode needed more humor.Jean, Al. (2003). Commentary for \\"Homer Alone,\\" in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. McClure's character is most developed in \\"A Fish Called Selma,\\" which provides a more in-depth look into his private life and backstory. Showrunners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were fans of Hartman, and wished to make an episode entirely about McClure in order to give Hartman as much to do as possible. From this came the idea of McClure's marriage to Selma Bouvier, as she was \\"always marrying people.\\" Animator Mark Kirkland was particularly pleased that McClure was the star of the episode. He enjoyed interpreting Hartman's voice- over performances, and the episode allowed him and the other animators to \\"open [McClure] up visually as a character.\\" Throughout \\"A Fish Called Selma,\\" it is hinted that McClure engages in strange sexual behavior. The writers did not initially know what the \\"unsavory\\" sexual preference would be, but eventually decided on a fish fetish, using a suggestion from executive producer James L. Brooks. Josh Weinstein described the fish fetish concept as \\"so perverted and strange, it was over the top.\\" =Retirement= After Hartman's murder in 1998, instead of recasting Troy McClure, the production staff retired the character, along with Hartman's other recurring character, Lionel Hutz, from the show. McClure last appeared in the season ten episode \\"Bart the Mother,\\" which was dedicated to Hartman. Before his death, Hartman had often expressed an interest in starring in a live-action film about McClure, which would be penned by some of the show's writers. He noted that he was \\"looking forward to his live-action movie, publicizing [McClure's] Betty Ford appearances.\\" Matt Groening later told Empire that the idea never \\"got further than enthusiasm,\\" but \\"would have been really fun.\\" Despite McClure's retirement, he is featured on the Digital Purchase cover for season 30 and has a cameo on a cover of a magazine in the season 30 episode \\"The Clown Stays in the Picture\\". Reception and cultural influence Even after his retirement, Troy McClure remains a popular supporting character. IGN ranked McClure first in their 2006 list of the \\"Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters,\\" calling him \\"a wonderfully bizarre and entertaining character that showcases the best of what small roles on The Simpsons can be.\\" In a 2007 article on Simpsons guest stars, Adam Finley of TV Squad wrote that McClure was \\"responsible for some of the funniest moments in Simpsons history.\\" Hartman ranked first on AOL's list of their favorite 25 Simpsons guest stars. Chris Turner argues in Planet Simpson that McClure and Lionel Hutz \\"together ... represent the most significant contribution to the show outside of its permanent cast,\\" adding that \\"the show's Golden Age is hard to imagine without them.\\" He continues, \\"The smarmy Hollywood type ... has been done to death, but Hartman's version breathed new life into it with each appearance. McClure has become the apotheosis of the stereotype, a gut-achingly funny reinterpretation whose trademark introduction ... has become a shorthand way to describe any grossly artificial media figure.\\" McClure's most prominent episode, \\"A Fish Called Selma,\\" is a favorite of many of the show's staff members, and has been cited as one of the series' best episodes by several publications. Entertainment Weekly placed the episode eighth on their top 25 The Simpsons episode list, and IGN named the episode the best of the seventh season, calling it the \\"obvious pick.\\" They also deemed McClure's Planet of the Apes musical the best moment of the episode and \\"maybe even the whole show.\\" McClure was one of Phil Hartman's best-known roles. He often used his McClure voice to entertain the audience between takes while taping episodes of NewsRadio. He remarked, \\"My favorite fans are Troy McClure fans.\\" He added \\"It's the one thing that I do in my life that's almost an avocation. I do it for the pure love of it.\\" Many obituaries of Hartman mentioned his work as McClure as one of the highlights of his career. The BBC said that \\"[Hartman's] voice was known to millions\\" because of McClure and Lionel Hutz. The title of a song on American indie-rock band Yo La Tengo's ninth full-length album, And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out, \\"Let's Save Tony Orlando's House,\\" is based upon a telethon that McClure hosts in the episode \\"Marge on the Lam.\\" In an interview with the A.V. Club, Ira Kaplan, the singer and guitarist of Yo La Tengo, states that James McNew, the band's bassist, titled a series of instrumentals from the Troy McClure filmography.

He is voiced by Harry Shearer and first appeared in the episode \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\". He is a grumpy, self-centered local Springfield news anchor. Profile Kent Brockman hosts the Channel 6 weekday news, as well as Smartline, a local current-affairs program (a parody of the national current-affairs program Nightline), Bite Back! With Kent Brockman (a parody of Fight Back! With David Horowitz), Eye on Springfield (a parody of Eye on LA), which focuses mostly on Springfield's entertainment news, the game show Springfield Squares, and has his own personal commentary segment of the six PM news, \\"My Two Cents\\". As seen in a flashback to the 1960s in the episode \\"Mother Simpson\\", Brockman was known as Kenny Brockelstein early in his career. Brockman has a daughter, Brittany, who may have been the product of his fling with the Channel 6 weather girl. In \\"Kamp Krusty\\", Brockman is revealed to have during his career, reported on the Vietnam War, the 1979-89 Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, and the 1991 Gulf War. In \\"Dog of Death\\", Brockman won the multimillion-dollar ($130 million) state lottery jackpot and left the news desk while still on the air. However, he remained a news anchor because he was under contract, though he also admitted that he likes making $500,000 a year. He has an ongoing feud with traffic reporter Arnie Pye, and has been shown to criticize Pye's reporting and also even chuckles when it was thought Pye had died in a helicopter accident. When Arnie Pye took Brockman's anchor position he admitted on the air he made out with Brockman's daughter but was sure to note it was with \\"the grown up one\\" thus revealing Brockman having an adult daughter. It has been hinted that Brockman is ethnically Jewish, having changed his surname from Brockelstein. He can sometimes be spotted wearing the Hebrew Chai symbol on a necklace. He is seen several times attending Reverend Lovejoy's Protestant church, and in \\"Marge on the Lam\\" he states his belief in the Book of Revelation, suggesting he professes Christian religious beliefs. Brockman's penchant for using offensive language works against him in the 400th episode, \\"You Kent Always Say What You Want\\", where, after Homer accidentally spills coffee on Brockman's crotch, he shouts what Ned Flanders calls a \\"super swear\\" that shocked everyone who watched it. Brockman was demoted to weather man due to the station paying a fine to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and was soon fired when the network executives deliberately mistook a ring of Splenda in Brockman's coffee for cocaine. Brockman was later given his job back to silence him (after doing an expos√© that was seen on YouTube uncovering the real reason the FCC is cracking down on obscenity in the media), with a 50% raise, making his new salary $750,000 a year. Creation and inspirations Brad Bird designed Brockman. Kent Brockman first appeared on television in the first season episode \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\", which originally aired April 29, 1990.Krusty Gets Busted, BBC.co.uk. Retrieved on 2008-12-30.\\"Krusty Gets Busted\\". The Simpsons.com. Retrieved on 2008-12-31. The character was based on Los Angeles anchormen Hal Fishman and Jerry Dunphy.Groening, Matt; Jean, Al (2003). Commentary for \\"Homer Defined\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The director of \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\", Brad Bird, designed the character and modeled him after anchorman Ted Koppel.Bird, Brad; Wolodarsky, Wallace (2001). Commentary for \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Another influence on the character was The Mary Tyler Moore Show's Ted Baxter, played by Ted Knight. Dunphy was proud of the fact that Brockman was based on him and would tell people that he was Kent Brockman. Cultural influence Brockman is responsible for popularizing the snowclone \\"I, for one, welcome our new [fill-in-the-blank] overlords\\", sometimes used to express mock submission, usually for the purpose of humor. It has been used in the media, such as New Scientist magazine, the Houston Chronicle and Ken Jennings on Jeopardy!: The Watson Challenge (versus Watson). Brockman's harangue about the Corvair spacecraft being taken over by a master race of giant space ants in \\"Deep Space Homer\\", which generated the meme, is considered to be one of the show's classic moments. The spacecraft was carrying an ant colony to see if they could be trained to sort tiny screws in space, but were released by Homer by accident. This led to an ant drifting by the video feed, appearing gigantic due to its proximity to the camera, at which point Brockman contemplates if the \\"master race of giant space ants ... will consume the captive earth men or merely enslave them\\" and eventually utters the line \\"And I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords\\". Author Chris Turner called it \\"perhaps his finest hour as a journalist\\" and said that it is \\"simply among the finest comedic moments in the history of television.\\" On May 6, 2014, Stephen Colbert made direct reference to the phrase by using it as his closing line. Reception The author of the book Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation, Chris Turner, said that \\"if the institution of the News has a single iconic face on The Simpsons, it's Brockman's\\" and that \\"in Brockman's journalism, we see some of the modern news media's ugliest biases\\", of which he says are glibness, amplification, and sensationalism. MSN called Brockman one of the worst TV news anchors. \\"You Kent Always Say What You Want\\" was well received by critics. IGN called it the second best episode of the season. Merchandise Playmates Toys created a Kent Brockman action figure for its World of Springfield toy line which was released in July 2001.

He is voiced by Kelsey Grammer and first appeared briefly in the episode \\"The Telltale Head\\". Bob is a self-proclaimed genius who is a graduate of Yale University, a member of the Republican Party, and a champion of high culture. He began his career as a sidekick on Krusty the Clown's television show, but after enduring constant abuse, Bob attempted to frame his employer for armed robbery in \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\". The plan was foiled by his arch-enemy, Bart Simpson, and Sideshow Bob was sent to prison. Bob made his second major appearance in season three's \\"Black Widower\\"; the writers echoed the premise of the Coyote chasing the Road Runner by having Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart's life, threatening to disrupt ‚Äì and sometimes end ‚Äì it. In each appearance thereafter, Bob has assumed the role on The Simpsons of an evil genius. Episodes in which he is a central character typically involve Sideshow Bob being released from prison and executing an elaborate revenge plan, usually foiled by Bart and Lisa. His plans often involve murder and destruction, usually targeted at Bart or, less often, Krusty, though these plans often involve targeting the entire Simpson family. In 2015, however, during the \\"Treehouse of Horror\\" segment, \\"Wanted: Dead, Then Alive\\", Bob finally gets his wish of killing Bart, commenting that he spent 24 years trying to kill a ten-year-old child; however, he becomes bored with Bart dead, so he brings him back to life so that he can repeatedly kill Bart over and over again. Sideshow Bob shares some personality traits of Grammer's character Frasier Crane from the sitcoms Cheers and Frasier, and has been described as \\"Frasier pickled in arsenic\\". Several parallels have been explicitly drawn in The Simpsons between Bob and Frasier Crane ‚Äì Bob's brother Cecil and his father were played by David Hyde Pierce and John Mahoney respectively, echoing the roles they played in Frasier. Grammer, who based Bob's voice on that of actor Ellis Rabb, has been praised for his portrayals of the character. In 2006, he won an Emmy for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his work in the episode \\"The Italian Bob\\". As of December 2019, Bob has had speaking appearances in 22 episodes and been featured in 14; the most recent of the latter, \\"Bobby, It's Cold Outside\\", aired during the 31st season. In addition to his recurring role in the series, Sideshow Bob has made several appearances in other Simpsons media. He appears in the Simpsons Comics, cameos in the 2007 video game The Simpsons Game, and stars as the main antagonist in The Simpsons Ride at Universal Studios' theme parks. A lover of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, Sideshow Bob is also known for his singing voice; several of Grammer's performances have been included in The Simpsons musical compilations. Appearances =On The Simpsons= The character of Sideshow Bob began his career as the non-speaking sidekick on Krusty the Clown's television show. The episode \\"Brother from Another Series\\" (season eight, 1997) reveals that Bob only received the job after his younger brother Cecil failed an audition, because Krusty considered Bob to be a perfect comic foil. After repeated instances of abuse, including being shot from a cannon and hit constantly with pies, the Yale-educated Bob became angry at Krusty and resentful of the clown's success. In \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\" (season one, 1990) Bob disguised himself as Krusty and framed him for armed robbery of the Kwik- E-Mart. After Krusty is arrested, Bob takes control of the show, introducing children to elements of high culture. However, Bob's reign is short-lived; Bart Simpson exposes him as the robber, Krusty is released, and Bob is fired and sent to jail. In \\"Black Widower\\" (season three, 1992), Bob's first major appearance after framing Krusty, he is released from prison and marries Bart's aunt Selma Bouvier. As part of a scheme to inherit money she has invested in the stock market, Bob attempts to blow Selma up during their honeymoon. Bart again foils the plan and Sideshow Bob returns to prison. After being paroled from prison in \\"Cape Feare\\" (season five, 1993), Bob targets Bart directly, threatening him repeatedly and forcing the Simpsons into hiding as part of the Witness Relocation Program. Bob follows them to their hideout, a houseboat on Terror Lake, and, after subduing the family, prepares to kill Bart. He allows a final request, however, and Bart asks to hear Bob sing the entire score of H.M.S. Pinafore. The delaying tactic leads to Bob's third arrest when the houseboat drifts all the way back to Springfield as Bob sings. Bob is released from prison once again in \\"Sideshow Bob Roberts\\" (season six, 1994), and runs for Mayor of Springfield as the Republican Party candidate. He defeats Democratic Party incumbent Joe Quimby in a landslide, but Bart and Lisa discover that Bob rigged the election, leading to another incarceration. Bob escapes from prison for the first time in \\"Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming\\" (season seven, 1995), and threatens to blow up Springfield with a nuclear bomb unless the city stops broadcasting all television shows. He is thwarted when he finds out that the bomb itself is a dud, then kidnaps Bart and flies the Wright Brothers' plane in an attempt to kill himself, Bart, and Krusty (who is hiding inside a shack, improvising a performance on the Emergency Broadcast System). This too is thwarted, and Bob returns to prison. In the following season, Bob takes advantage of the prison's work release program, and appears to be genuinely redeemed. In \\"Brother from Another Series\\", Reverend Lovejoy declares him a changed man and recommends him for a work release opportunity. Bob is discharged from prison into the care of his brother Cecil, who is Springfield's chief hydrological and hydrodynamical engineer. However, the scheming Cecil, still smarting over his failed audition for Krusty, tries to frame Bob by sabotaging the Springfield Dam. Bob, Bart, and Lisa together stop Cecil and save the town, and both brothers, despite Bob's genuine innocence, are sent to prison. In \\"Day of the Jackanapes\\" (season 12, 2001), Bob discovers that Krusty has erased all of the early shows featuring Sideshow Bob as Krusty himself is declaring his fifth and final retirement after being annoyed with the network executives. Bob is released from prison and develops a plot to kill Krusty using Bart as a suicide bomber during Krusty's retirement special. Just as Bob was to succeed, he overhears Krusty publicly holding himself responsible for turning Bob into a criminal, expressing his regret of mistreating Bob during his years as Sideshow. To appease things, Krusty sings himself a song on Bob's behalf, and being touched by this, Bob decides to abort his plan of attempted murder and reconciles with Krusty, although he is returned to prison for it. Bob's aid is sought by Springfield police in \\"The Great Louse Detective\\" (season 14, 2002). After an attempt is made on Homer Simpson's life, Bob is released from prison to help find the culprit. When the mystery is solved, he returns to murder Bart. However, Bob finds he is \\"accustomed to [Bart's] face\\" and cannot do it. It is revealed in \\"The Italian Bob\\" (season 17, 2005) that Bob has moved to Italy to make a fresh start. He is elected mayor of the village of Salsiccia in Tuscany and marries a local woman named Francesca, with whom he has a son named Gino. The Simpson family, in Italy to retrieve a car for Mr. Burns, encounters him by chance. Bob welcomes them with hospitality on the condition that they not reveal his felonious past; however, a drunken Lisa jokes about Bob's criminal deeds, alienating Bob from his citizens. He, his wife and son swear a vendetta on the Simpsons. The entire Terwilliger family returns in \\"Funeral for a Fiend\\" (season 19, 2007) in which Bob's father, Robert Terwilliger Sr., and mother, Dame Judith Underdunk, make their first appearances. Bob fakes his own death and locks Bart in the coffin, which he attempts to cremate at the otherwise empty funeral home as all the Terwilligers laugh maniacally. They are foiled by Lisa and the rest of the Simpson family and sent to prison. Bob briefly returns in the season 20 episode \\"Wedding for Disaster\\", when Bart and Lisa initially suspect Bob of kidnapping Homer to prevent him from attending his second wedding with Marge (due to a keychain they found had an 'S' and a 'B'), but Krusty provides him with an alibi, explaining to the kids that Bob was with him the whole day. Eventually, Bob and the kids discover the true culprits, Patty and Selma. Bob reappears again in the episode \\"The Bob Next Door\\" (season 21, 2010), where he switches faces with his prison cellmate Walt Warren. Bob returns to Springfield and moves into the house next to the Simpson family, assuming Walt's identity. He exploits this to make his latest attempt to kill Bart legally over state lines, but is foiled again and gets taken away by state police. Bob briefly appears in \\"At Long Last Leave\\" (season 23, 2012), where he attends a town meeting to decide if the Simpson family should be banished from Springfield, and is one of many who express their desire for it to happen. In \\"The Man Who Grew Too Much\\" (season 25, 2014), he was revealed as a Chief Scientist for a genetic engineering company named Monsarno, having received the position after he was selected as a test subject and published the results of the experiments to which he was subjected. He and Lisa bond over their interest in Walt Whitman, but Bob soon reveals that he has also genetically modified himself to give himself various superhuman abilities, intending to acquire DNA from the relics of various historical figures stored in the Springfield Museum to make himself a superhuman dictator. However, after he is provoked into a fight, he realizes that he has become a crude monster and jumps off the Springfield Dam, surviving because the gills he gave himself allow him to survive in the lake. Bob briefly appears in \\"Clown in the Dumps\\" (season 26, 2014), where he offered his condolences to Krusty after the death of his father, Rabbi Krustofsky. He also made a brief appearance on \\"Blazed and Confused\\" (season 26, 2014), where he meets Mr. Lassen, Bart's former teacher, who was now reduced to working in prison as a guard after Bart's actions got him fired. Despite Lassen's offer to get him out, Bob rejects the idea that they team up as Lassen thought that they would take turns gutting Bart. In Treehouse of Horror XXVI segment \\"Wanted: Dead, then Alive\\", Bob successfully kills Bart, but finds his life so meaningless in Bart's absence that he creates a machine to bring Bart back to life so that he can keep killing his enemy over and over, until the other Simpsons rescue Bart and Bart uses the resurrection machine to turn Bob into a twisted amalgamation of creatures. Bob has made a brief appearance in \\"Gal of Constant Sorrow\\", grunting in annoyance as he wipes off Bart's graffiti from Hettie Mae Boggs' promo poster on the wall along with Snake Jailbird and other inmates. Bob appeared in the 29th season in Gone Boy when he tries to track down the whereabouts of Bart Simpson. Sideshow Bob appears in the 31st season in Bobby, It's Cold Outside in where he plays Santa Claus at a theme park. =Other media= In addition to regular roles in the television series, Sideshow Bob has made several appearances in other Simpsons media. Kelsey Grammer recorded several Sideshow Bob lines for The Simpsons Movie, but the scene was cut. Sideshow Bob has made regular appearances in the monthly Simpsons Comics, and several of Kelsey Grammer's singing performances have been included in The Simpsons CD compilations. His performance of the H.M.S. Pinafore in \\"Cape Feare\\" was later included on the album Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons, and the song \\"The Very Reason That I Live\\" from \\"The Great Louse Detective\\" was included on The Simpsons: Testify. A previously unaired song, \\"Hullaba Lula\\", originally written for \\"Day of the Jackanapes\\", was also included on that compilation. The producers modeled the song after \\"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\\", but were forced to remove the song from the episode when they were unable to obtain the rights to it.Jean, Al. (2009). Commentary for \\"Day of the Jackanapes\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In The Simpsons Game, released in November 2007, Bob has a speaking cameo appearance at the end of the chapter titled \\"Invasion of the Yokel-Snatchers\\" in which he was working with Kang and Kodos. Sideshow Bob appears in the 1991 The Simpsons Arcade Game, on the fifth level where he is pulling a cart containing a roast chicken health pick up. Bob was also included as a level boss in the 1991 video game Bart vs. the Space Mutants. Sideshow Bob plays a lead role in The Simpsons Ride, which opened at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood in May 2008. Voiced by Grammer, he is the main villain in the ride, having escaped from prison to get revenge on the Simpson family. In The Simpsons: Tapped Out, a city- building game released in February 2012, Sideshow Bob occurs as a bonus. Popping up every couple hours, the players are given a chance to tap on him to receive a small sum of money, and \\"send\\" him to jail. In a later update to the game, Sideshow Bob also has a stand in Krusty Land, where players get to pop balloons for a chance to win donuts and Krusty tickets. The Simpsons: Tapped Out Terwilligers content update was released April 14, 2015 and has several references to the Simpsons episodes with Sideshow Bob. This game event was split in 3 acts and ended June 4, 2015. New characters, skins and costumes include Sideshow Bob, Cecil Terwilliger, Gino Terwilliger, Francesca Terwilliger, Dr. Robert Terwilliger Sr., Judith Underdunk, Captain Bob, and Opera Krusty. Most of the event action takes place at Monsarno Research and Opera House. Character =Creation= Sideshow Bob in his brief first appearance in \\"The Telltale Head\\". His design was simple compared to later versions and would be refined for his appearance in \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\". Sideshow Bob first appeared in \\"The Telltale Head\\", the eighth episode of season one. His design was relatively simple compared to later incarnations, and his hairstyle was rounded. However, towards the end of the episode, he appears again, in a panning shot of a crowd, with his familiar hairstyle. His first major appearance was in season one's twelfth episode \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\", written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky. Bob's design was updated for \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\"; as the episode's animation style evolved, director Brad Bird made the character of Sideshow Bob sleeker and more refined, to fit Grammer's voice technique. Following the re-design, animators tried to redraw his scenes in \\"The Telltale Head\\", but had insufficient time before the show was produced.Moore, Rich. (2001). Commentary for \\"The Telltale Head\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Bob has no lines of dialogue during the first half of \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\"; the character's only communication takes the form of a slide whistle. This was designed to make Bob appear simplistic, so that when he finally spoke, viewers would be surprised to hear his sophisticated vocabulary.Jean, Al. (2001). Commentary for \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. An early version of the script for \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\" called for James Earl Jones to voice Bob, but the producers instead selected Kelsey Grammer.Bird, Brad. (2001). Commentary for \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. For Bob's voice, Grammer performed an impression of theatre actor and director Ellis Rabb. Grammer had once worked for Rabb, whose \\"lamenting tones became [the] foundation for Sideshow Bob\\".Grammer, Kelsey. (2006). Commentary for \\"Brother From Another Series\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Sideshow Bob's full name is Robert Underdunk Terwilliger. His last name was first revealed in \\"Black Widower\\" while his middle name was first mentioned in \\"Sideshow Bob Roberts\\". Competing theories as to the origin of his name exist; some sources say he was named after the character Dr. Terwilliker, a megalomaniac outwitted by a boy named Bart in the film The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T by Dr. Seuss, but others say he was named after Terwilliger Boulevard in Portland, Oregon. Yet another theory is that he was named after Sergeant Terwilliger and Mrs. Underdunk in the pilot episode of the TV show Hunter.Unclaimed Simpsons Reference Finally Gotten While most official and unofficial Simpsons guides spell the character's middle name as ‚ÄúUnderdunk‚Äù, writer Bill Oakley has stated that he intended for it to be spelled ‚ÄúOnderdonk‚Äù, the name being taken from American bishop and composer of hymns Henry Ustick Onderdonk. =Development= For season three's \\"Black Widower\\", the writers echoed the premise of Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner from Looney Tunes cartoons by having Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart's life and attempt to kill him. Executive producer Al Jean has compared Bob's character to that of Wile E. Coyote, noting that both are intelligent, yet always foiled by what they perceive as an inferior intellect.Jean, Al. (2003). Commentary for \\"Black Widower\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. For \\"Black Widower\\", director David Silverman updated the character model to reflect the animation of director Brad Bird.Silverman, David. (2003). Commentary for \\"Black Widower\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. A rule for earlier episodes featuring Bob called for a recap of his evil deeds; this was dropped after season eight's \\"Brother from Another Series\\" when the chronology became too lengthy.Weinstein, Josh. (2006). Commentary for \\"Brother From Another Series\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Another rule established by the show's writers mandated Bob's return to prison at the end of each episode, although this pattern was abandoned in later episodes like \\"The Great Louse Detective\\" and \\"The Italian Bob\\". alt=A man wearing a cap smiles broadly. Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, the showrunners for the seventh and eighth seasons, believed that every season of the show should contain an episode starring Sideshow Bob. However, by the seventh season Bob had already been the focus of four stories, and writers were having trouble developing new ways to include him.Oakley, Bill. (2005). Commentary for \\"Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Weinstein describes Bob's dialogue as difficult to write, due to his unique and refined style of speaking.Weinstein, Josh. (2005). Commentary for \\"Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Despite these challenges, however, creators of The Simpsons usually look forward to \\"Sideshow Bob episodes\\"; the writers consider them enjoyable to write,Keeler, Ken. (2006). Commentary for \\"Brother From Another Series\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. and former director Dominic Polcino describes them as \\"a treat\\" to work on.Polcino, Dominic. (2005). Commentary for \\"Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In \\"Black Widower\\", Sideshow Bob notes that he is a \\"life-long Republican.\\" Kelsey Grammer initially expected Sideshow Bob to be a one-time role, and calls him \\"the most popular character I've ever played\\". Grammer usually joins the show's \\"table readings\\" (wherein cast members read each script together for the first time),Jean, Al. (2004). Commentary for \\"Cape Feare\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. and former executive producer David Mirkin described working with Grammer as very pleasant, due to his lively sense of humor. Grammer, Mirkin says, is capable of perfect readings, but noted that the actor dislikes performing Sideshow Bob's evil laugh.Mirkin, David. (2005). Commentary for \\"Sideshow Bob Roberts\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In a 2007 interview, Simpsons executive producer Al Jean listed Grammer as one of his favorite guest stars (second only to Phil Hartman), saying \\"his voice is so rich.\\" Writer George Meyer commented that \\"writing for Kelsey is great, he can give the kind of purple, florid, melodramatic speeches that most of the characters would never give. And he can sing.\\" The show's writers admire Grammer's singing voice, and try to include a song for each appearance. Alf Clausen, the primary composer for The Simpsons, commented that \\"[Grammer] is so great. He's just amazing. You can tell he has this love of musical theater and he has the vocal instrument to go with it, so I know whatever I write is going to be sung the way I've heard it.\\" Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which is played whenever Bob gets out of prison or is about to commit a sinister action, and was first used in \\"Cape Feare\\". It is based on the score of the film Cape Fear, composed by Bernard Herrmann. The musical score for \\"Cape Feare\\" earned Clausen an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Dramatic Underscore ‚Äì Series in 1994. Bob's prisoner number is often 24601, which is Jean Valjean's prisoner number in Les Mis√©rables.Reiss, Mike. (2003). Commentary for \\"Black Widower\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Another trademark for Bob is a visual gag of stepping on a rake and being struck in the face with its handle; this joke first appeared in \\"Cape Feare\\". To fill time, the writers added nine consecutive iterations of the same joke in quick succession. The sequence has become known as the \\"rake joke\\" and was described by Entertainment Weekly as showing \\"genius in its repetitive stupidity.\\" =Family= Sideshow Bob's brother Cecil was designed to resemble actor David Hyde Pierce, who also played the brother of Grammer's character on the show Frasier. The episode \\"Brother from Another Series\\" introduces Bob's brother Cecil. After writer Ken Keeler was assigned to write an episode featuring Sideshow Bob, he drew inspiration from episodes of Frasier. He decided to incorporate elements of Grammer's other show into the character of Sideshow Bob, and designed Cecil to resemble Grammer's brother on Frasier. Cecil is voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who portrayed Frasier Crane's brother Niles. Pierce commented, \\"Normally, I would not do something like this. But how often do you get a chance to work with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?\\" Several of Frasier producers were asked to review the original script and provide feedback. Their comments were positive; they only expressed concern with a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character whom he refers to as \\"Maris\\". In Frasier, Maris Crane is an unseen character, and the producers of Frasier asked that the scene be removed. Many of the interactions between Bob and Cecil were based on those of Niles and Frasier. Cecil was drawn to resemble David Hyde Pierce, while retaining a visual similarity to Sideshow Bob. According to director Pete Michels, it was difficult to draw Bob and Cecil standing together, because of their comically oversized feet.Michels, Pete. (2006). Commentary for \\"Brother From Another Series\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Cecil returns in season 19's \\"Funeral for a Fiend\\", which introduces the brothers' previously unseen father, Dr. Robert Terwilliger, played by John Mahoney. Mahoney portrayed Martin Crane, the father of Grammer's and Pierce's characters in Frasier. Whereas in Frasier, Mahoney played the \\"down-to-Earth, average guy\\" to Grammer's and Hyde Pierce's \\"uppity snobs\\", Robert Terwilliger Sr. was portrayed as equally highbrow as Bob. His wife, Bob's mother, is Dame Judith Underdunk, \\"the finest classical actress of her generation.\\" She sports the same curly spiked hair as her two sons. Bob also has a wife named Francesca (voiced by Maria Grazia Cucinotta) and a son named Gino, both of whom were introduced in season 17 episode \\"The Italian Bob\\" and returned for \\"Funeral for a Fiend\\". Reception Actress Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson, said in her book My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that Grammer's performance brings \\"deliciously vile energy\\" to the show. The character of Sideshow Bob and Grammer's voicework have received many accolades. In 2006 IGN listed him as the second-best \\"peripheral character\\" on The Simpsons, commenting that Bob is \\"a man of contradictions; his goofy appearance, complete with palm tree like hair, doesn't seem to match up to the well spoken and even musically talented maniac.\\" Also that year, Wizard Magazine rated Bob as the 66th greatest villain of all time. Adam Finley of TV Squad wrote that \\"that baritone voice, the Shakespearean delivery, and the ability to go from calm and collected to stark raving mad all within the same second make Sideshow Bob one of the best recurring characters on the show.\\" Kelsey Grammer has consistently received praise for his voicework, and has been described as \\"brilliant\\", \\"inimitable\\" and \\"a feast of mid-Atlantic anglophilia\\". In 2006, Grammer won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his role in \\"The Italian Bob\\"; he had previously won four awards in the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series category for his portrayal of the title role on Frasier. In 2008, Grammer was included in Entertainment Weeklys list of the sixteen best Simpsons guest stars; Hyde Pierce was also included in that list. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote that \\"Kelsey Grammer's grand voice-performance as Sideshow Bob is Frasier pickled in arsenic.\\" In her book My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy, Nancy Cartwright (who performs the voice of Bart Simpson) wrote that \\"Kelsey Grammer scores big-time by injecting caustic, bitter, contemptuous and deliciously vile energy into his rendition of Sideshow Bob. Springfield just wouldn't be the same without him.\\" Most of the episodes featuring Bob have been well received by fans and critics. \\"Cape Feare\\" is generally regarded as one of the best episodes of The SimpsonsGroening, Matt. (2004). Commentary for \\"Cape Feare\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. and placed third on Entertainment Weeklys 2003 list of the show's top 25 episodes. IGN considers it the best episode of the fifth season. In 2007, Vanity Fair called it the show's fourth-best episode, because of its \\"masterful integration of filmic parody and a recurring character\\". Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star listed \\"Cape Feare\\", \\"Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming\\" and \\"Brother From Another Series\\" among the best episodes of the series, writing \\"forget Frasier, these are Kelsey Grammer's best roles.\\" \\"The Italian Bob\\" and its writer John Frink won a Writers Guild of America Award in 2007 in the animation category. In December 2009, Robert Canning of IGN ranked the ten episodes to feature Bob that had aired at the time. The first five Bob episodes took up the top five, with \\"Cape Feare\\" being ranked first. \\"The Italian Bob\\" was ranked tenth, with the explanation that \\"All the things we love about a Sideshow Bob episode ‚Äì the vengeance, the familiar settings and characters, the elaborate scheming ‚Äì were missing from this half-hour. Without it, Bob wasn't nearly as entertaining, and the episode didn't result in a whole lot of laughs.\\" He noted that only \\"The Italian Bob\\" and the ninth ranked \\"Funeral for a Fiend\\" were \\"the only ones I'd consider clunkers. The remaining episodes are all quite fun.\\" The character's line in \\"Sideshow Bob Roberts\\", \\"Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel prize for attempted chemistry?\\", briefly became an Internet meme after a similar defense of President Donald Trump was repeated after the Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal. =Analysis= In Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner writes that Bob is built into a highbrow snob and conservative Republican so that the writers can continually use him as a strawman and pincushion. He represents high culture while Krusty represents low culture, and Bart, stuck in between, always wins out. In the book Leaving Springfield, David L. G. Arnold comments that Bart is a product of a \\"mass- culture upbringing\\" and thus is Bob's enemy.Arnold, pp. 2‚Äì3. Frustrated by his early role as the target of \\"Krusty's cheap gags\\", Bob frames Krusty and takes over the show. He changes the content of that show to present readings of classic literature and segments examining the emotional lives of pre-teens. He believes that by exposing the kids to high culture he will improve their lives. Arnold writes that \\"Bob's own conscience and morality are clearly unaffected by the high culture he represents.\\" He also tries to \\"manipulate the tastes of the masses\\" by becoming a criminal mastermind.Arnold, pp. 12‚Äì13. Arnold believes that this is most apparent in \\"Sideshow Bob Roberts\\", wherein he rigs the election to become the mayor of Springfield. When accused of election fraud, he rants, \\"Your guilty consciences may force you to vote Democratic, but secretly you yearn for a cold-hearted Republican who'll cut taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! You need me, Springfield!\\" He considers himself a member of the social elite, and happily uses Machiavellian methods to acquire and maintain power.Arnold, p. 17. Bob's intelligence serves him in many ways. During the episode \\"Cape Feare\\", for example, the parole board asks Bob why he has a tattoo that says \\"Die, Bart, Die\\". Bob replies that it is German for \\"The, Bart, The\\"; members of the board are impressed by his reasoning. Believing that \\"nobody who speaks German could be an evil man\\", they release him. However, his love of high culture is sometimes used against him. In the same episode, Bob agrees to perform the operetta H.M.S. Pinafore in its entirety as a last request for Bart. The tactic stalls Bob long enough for the police to arrest him.Arnold, p. 16.

He is voiced by Nancy Cartwright and was introduced in Season 1's \\"Bart the General\\" as an antagonist, but later became more of a minor antagonist, and a close friend of Bart Simpson. Role in The Simpsons Nelson is a 12-year-old student and bully at Springfield Elementary School. He is known to have terrorized virtually every kid in Springfield at one point or another. Most often, however, it is the school nerds and less popular students, such as Milhouse and Martin, who are the subject of his cruelty. Nelson shows the occasional glimpse of humanity, though, and other characters have occasionally warmed to him; Lisa dates him briefly in \\"Lisa's Date with Density\\", Marge informally adopts him in \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\", and Bart is shown as a friend to him several times, such as in \\"The Haw-Hawed Couple\\". His family life is dysfunctional. While some early episodes offer inconsistent histories (such as Nelson's dad going insane and abandoning him, Nelson's parents divorcing because of his mom's cough drop addiction, or Nelson's dad in prison while his mom \\"has bigger problems\\"), the canon story that has evolved is that he lives in a dilapidated house with his mother, who works on the fringes of the sex industry, either as a waitress at Hooters or in a topless bar. The character design and voice portrayal of both parents has varied throughout the course of the series. It is shown in many episodes that Nelson's father abandoned him and his mother at an early age when he \\"went to pick up some Pop-Tarts\\" although, later on in the series, he was said to have gone to pick up a pack of cigarettes. In the fourth-season episode \\"Brother from the Same Planet\\", Nelson's father is the children's soccer coach who awards Nelson with a free trip to Pele's Soccer and Acting Camp. Nelson's father also appears briefly in the sixth-season episode \\"Bart's Girlfriend\\", depicted capturing Nelson with a leash as the children run through the cornfields in an attempt to avoid attending church. He also appears in the ninth-season episode \\"Bart Star\\" to congratulate Nelson after a football game victory and take him to Hooters (with Nelson turning down the invitation because he \\"doesn't want to bother [his] Mom at work\\"). Nelson's father returns in the sixteenth-season episode \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\". It turns out that he did not leave Nelson deliberately; he bit into a chocolate bar, not knowing it had peanuts and had an allergic reaction, covering 90% of his body with large tumors. Looking like Joseph Merrick, he ran out of the store and encountered a circus that made him a part of its freak show. At performances, circus attendees threw peanuts at him, which perpetuated his reaction, preventing him from returning to normal. When the circus came through Springfield, Bart recognized him and brought him home to rid himself of Nelson (who had been taken into the Simpson home by Marge). Nelson is also a natural athlete. In the episode \\"Bart Star\\", Nelson almost singlehandedly carries the entire Springfield Pee-Wee football team. As the team quarterback, he also on one occasion catches his own pass and plows through the opposing team with extreme ease. In various episodes, he gives out the impression that he is a lot smarter than he may first appear. Nelson often points out painfully obvious things to adults and kids alike that take them longer to grasp. Another example is a running joke where Nelson does a class assignment that is implied to be of high quality. However, he is always brushed off by the teachers before he gets to show them his work. Another running joke, though, is Nelson presenting ridiculously simple assignments, such as repeatedly showing a can of tomato paste in Show and Tell, and a presentation on The Grapes of Wrath, consisting of himself crushing a bunch of grapes with a hammer, stating \\"Here's the grapes, and here's the wrath!\\" In later episodes, Nelson shows signs of being a tormented artist type, even submitting a film to the Sundance Film Festival about his life as a child living in poverty with a single, unfit mother and no strong father figure. He memorably says in the documentary, \\"I like to cry at the ocean, because only there do my tears seem small.\\" In the episode \\"Little Big Girl\\", it is revealed that Nelson is German-American. Ironically, in \\"Much Apu About Nothing\\", Nelson picks on foreign exchange student √úter for being German during Springfield's anti-immigration mania. He is shown to be a big fan of Andy Williams as he, Bart, Milhouse and Martin went to a concert performed by him in \\"Bart on the Road\\". In \\"The Simpsons Guy\\", he was captured along with Sideshow Bob, Principal Skinner, Jimbo Jones, and Apu by Stewie Griffin. Relationships with other characters Even though in the first season (and for many seasons afterwards) Nelson seemed to be Bart's antagonist, he eventually becomes what can be considered as Bart's second closest friend after Milhouse. In his debut episode, Lisa was the initial target of Nelson's bullying, which prompted Bart to defend her. Bart's actions resulted in frequent beatings by Nelson and his gang, but finally ended when Bart received help from Herman, who came up with the idea of standing up to Nelson and his gang by pelting them with water balloons. From that point on, Nelson shows a grudging respect for Bart, though he occasionally reverts to his past behavior towards him. Although still prone to violence, Nelson hangs out with Bart and his less popular friends, such as Milhouse Van Houten and occasionally even common bullying target Martin Prince. In \\"The Debarted\\", it is shown that Nelson has become Bart's \\"other best friend\\", along with Milhouse. Nelson has many other moments where he displays his hidden good nature, such as his brief amorous relationship with Lisa. Although he cannot control his delinquent tendencies, he treats her with respect and even tries to change for her, although both of them realize that he is not being true to himself by doing so. In \\"Lisa's Date with Density\\", Nelson kisses Lisa, only to be berated by Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph, who believe that kissing girls is \\"gay\\" (despite the events that occurred revolving around Jimbo in \\"New Kid On The Block\\"). He also punishes Sherri and Terri for tormenting Lisa. Another curious example of his \\"good side\\" is with Martin, a boy whom Nelson picks on perhaps more so than any other kid in town. Despite the utter cruelty, there are occasional hints that Nelson does not harbor any real hatred towards Martin and only does so to maintain his 'tough guy' reputation. In \\"Dial 'N' for Nerder\\", when it is believed that Martin has died, Nelson endeavours to learn the truth and find Martin's killers. When it is revealed that Martin is alive, Nelson mocks and punches him, but also states that he is glad Martin is not dead. In this same episode, however, when Lisa tries to bribe him to not rat her out by offering to get back together with him, he rejects it. In another episode, it is revealed that both Martin and Nelson went to space camp, and that Nelson was a loyal officer to Martin. (See \\"I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can\\") In \\"Loan-a Lisa\\", Lisa uses $50 to help Nelson fund his bicycle company, which becomes a success. When Nelson almost drops out of school to spend more time on the company, Lisa is saddened and attempts to stop him from doing so, but eventually respects his decision after realising he won't change despite the money used to fund it. Nelson eventually decides not to drop out after all and takes Lisa skating to make it up to her. Though Nelson is often said to not really have friends aside from his on-and- off relationship with Bart and the others, Nelson sometimes hangs out with his fellow school bullies Jimbo, Dolph, Kearney, and (to a lesser extent) two smaller and younger fraternal twin minions known as the Weasels. Though only seen with them occasionally, Nelson is also ironically the leader of the school bullies (possibly by virtue of being the most often seen and most recognizable of the gang). In \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\", Moe Szyslak appears briefly during a Muntz family reunion. The facial similarities between Moe and the Muntz are surprisingly quite apparent and Moe's childhood experiences and behaviors are somewhat relatable with Nelson's. Moe briefly appears and claims that he is part of the family and is then shunned off screen by the Muntz' confused looks. Character Nancy Cartwright voices Nelson, even though the role was not assigned to her originally. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening named Nelson after the wrestling hold of the same name.Groening, Matt (2004). Commentary for the episode \\"Lady Bouvier's Lover\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Cast member Nancy Cartwright voices the character, which first appeared in the fifth episode of the first season, \\"Bart the General\\" (1990). American voice actress Dana Hill was first supposed to provide Nelson's voice, and attended the read-through of the episode. However, as Cartwright wrote in her autobiography My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy, \\"the producers were still putting together this ensemble of [actors] and, come Monday, at the recording, she was nowhere to be found and the part was assigned to me. I didn't have time to ask why and I still don't have a clue.\\" Cartwright also commented that when she first found out she would be voicing Nelson, \\"I asked myself, 'What does a bully sound like?' Well... what you hear is what you get. When I first uttered, 'I'll get you after school, man!' I let out a sigh of relief when I got through the line and a double-sigh when it got a laugh.\\" By the eighth season of The Simpsons, the writers had begun to explore the secondary characters of the show. \\"Lisa's Date with Density\\" (season eight, 1996) was the first episode to center around Nelson and was used to explain why he acts the way he does. The idea of Nelson dating Lisa Simpson had already been around for a while, but this was the first time that the staff worked it into the show.Scully, Mike; Weinstein, Josh (2007). Commentary for the episode \\"Lisa's Date with Density\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Cartwright said in 2012 that she thinks Nelson \\"has evolved the most out of all the characters I do. There's a soft spot in him that the writers have found. He's got this special attraction to Marge, and he sings these songs, and he's got a crush on Lisa. There's something about this poor kid ‚Äì his mother works at Hooters, his dad went out to buy cigarettes and never came back. I wouldn't want him to come over for dinner, but I really love doing his voice.\\" Reception The episode \\"The Haw-Hawed Couple\\" in 2007 was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program.59th Primetime Emmy Nominations, emmys.tv.

Environmental science emerged from the fields of natural history and medicine during the Enlightenment. Today it provides an integrated, quantitative, and interdisciplinary approach to the study of environmental systems.Environmental Science: Iowa State University. Environmental Sciences provides an integrated and interdisciplinary approach to understand and mitigate hazards arising from anthropogenic and natural activities by focusing on key areas of environmental chemistry, earth sciences, environmental engineering, atmospheric sciences, and sustainable systems. http://www.ensci.iastate.edu (Accessed 17 February 2010) Environmental studies incorporates more of the social sciences for understanding human relationships, perceptions and policies towards the environment. Environmental engineering focuses on design and technology for improving environmental quality in every aspect. Environmental scientists study subjects like the understanding of earth processes, evaluating alternative energy systems, pollution control and mitigation, natural resource management, and the effects of global climate change. Environmental issues almost always include an interaction of physical, chemical, and biological processes. Environmental scientists bring a systems approach to the analysis of environmental problems. Key elements of an effective environmental scientist include the ability to relate space, and time relationships as well as quantitative analysis. Environmental science came alive as a substantive, active field of scientific investigation in the 1960s and 1970s driven by (a) the need for a multi- disciplinary approach to analyze complex environmental problems, (b) the arrival of substantive environmental laws requiring specific environmental protocols of investigation and (c) the growing public awareness of a need for action in addressing environmental problems. Events that spurred this development included the publication of Rachel Carson's landmark environmental book Silent SpringCarson, Rachel. Silent Spring (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1962), Mariner Books, 2002, along with major environmental issues becoming very public, such as the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, and the Cuyahoga River of Cleveland, Ohio, \\"catching fire\\" (also in 1969), and helped increase the visibility of environmental issues and create this new field of study. Terminology In common usage, \\"environmental science\\" and \\"ecology\\" are often used interchangeably, but technically, ecology refers only to the study of organisms and their interactions with each other as well as how they interrelate with environment. Ecology could be considered a subset of environmental science, which also could involve purely chemical or public health issues (for example) ecologists would be unlikely to study. In practice, there is considerable overlap between the work of ecologists and other environmental scientists. The National Center for Education Statistics in the United States defines an academic program in environmental science as follows: > A program that focuses on the application of biological, chemical, and > physical principles to the study of the physical environment and the > solution of environmental problems, including subjects such as abating or > controlling environmental pollution and degradation; the interaction between > human society and the natural environment; and natural resources management. > Includes instruction in biology, chemistry, physics, geography, climatology, > statistics, and mathematical modeling.National Center for Education > Statistics. Classification of Instructional Programs. United States > Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, 2000. (Accessed 29 > January 2010) Components Blue Marble composite images generated by NASA in 2001 (left) and 2002 (right) The Earth's atmosphere = Atmospheric sciences = Atmospheric sciences focus on the Earth's atmosphere, with an emphasis upon its interrelation to other systems. Atmospheric sciences can include studies of meteorology, greenhouse gas phenomena, atmospheric dispersion modeling of airborne contaminants, sound propagation phenomena related to noise pollution, and even light pollution. Taking the example of the global warming phenomena, physicists create computer models of atmospheric circulation and infra-red radiation transmission, chemists examine the inventory of atmospheric chemicals and their reactions, biologists analyze the plant and animal contributions to carbon dioxide fluxes, and specialists such as meteorologists and oceanographers add additional breadth in understanding the atmospheric dynamics. = Ecology = Biodiversity of a coral reef. Corals adapt and modify their environment by forming calcium carbonate skeletons. This provides growing conditions for future generations and forms a habitat for many other species. As defined by the Ecological Society of America, \\"Ecology is the study of the relationships between living organisms, including humans, and their physical environment; it seeks to understand the vital connections between plants and animals and the world around them.\\" Ecology deals with organisms, populations, communities, ecosystems and the biosphere.The place of living is the organism's environment. Hence, ecology is sometimes, called as environmental biology. In general, ecology is recognized as one of the natural sciences. It is considered to be a science concerned with the nature and the interrelations of living world.The term ecology has been derived from the Greek word \\"oikos\\" meaning 'habitation' or 'house' or 'living place[10] . For example, an interdisciplinary analysis of an ecological system which is being impacted by one or more stressors might include several related environmental science fields. In an estuarine setting where a proposed industrial development could impact certain species by water and air pollution, biologists would describe the flora and fauna, chemists would analyze the transport of water pollutants to the marsh, physicists would calculate air pollution emissions and geologists would assist in understanding the marsh soils and bay muds. = Environmental chemistry = Environmental chemistry is the study of chemical alterations in the environment. Principal areas of study include soil contamination and water pollution. The topics of analysis include chemical degradation in the environment, multi-phase transport of chemicals (for example, evaporation of a solvent containing lake to yield solvent as an air pollutant), and chemical effects upon biota. As an example study, consider the case of a leaking solvent tank which has entered the habitat soil of an endangered species of amphibian. As a method to resolve or understand the extent of soil contamination and subsurface transport of solvent, a computer model would be implemented. Chemists would then characterize the molecular bonding of the solvent to the specific soil type, and biologists would study the impacts upon soil arthropods, plants, and ultimately pond-dwelling organisms that are the food of the endangered amphibian. = Geosciences = Geosciences include environmental geology, environmental soil science, volcanic phenomena and evolution of the Earth's crust. In some classification systems this can also include hydrology, including oceanography. As an example study, of soils erosion, calculations would be made of surface runoff by soil scientists. Fluvial geomorphologists would assist in examining sediment transport in overland flow. Physicists would contribute by assessing the changes in light transmission in the receiving waters. Biologists would analyze subsequent impacts to aquatic flora and fauna from increases in water turbidity. Regulations driving the studies Environmental science examines the effects of humans on nature, such as the Glen Canyon Dam in the U.S. In the U.S. the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 set forth requirements for analysis of federal government actions (such as highway construction projects and land management decisions) in terms of specific environmental criteria. Numerous state laws have echoed these mandates, applying the principles to local-scale actions. The upshot has been an explosion of documentation and study of environmental consequences before the fact of development actions. One can examine the specifics of environmental science by reading examples of Environmental Impact Statements prepared under NEPA such as: Wastewater treatment expansion options discharging into the San Diego/Tijuana Estuary, Expansion of the San Francisco International Airport, Development of the Houston, Metro Transportation system, Expansion of the metropolitan Boston MBTA transit system, and Construction of Interstate 66 through Arlington, Virginia. In England and Wales the Environment Agency (EA),Environment Agency, UK formed in 1996, is a public body for protecting and improving the environment and enforces the regulations listed on the communities and local government site. (formerly the office of the deputy prime minister). The agency was set up under the Environment Act 1995 as an independent body and works closely with UK Government to enforce the regulations.

He has also been identified as Nathanael or Nathaniel, who appears in the Gospel of John when introduced to Jesus by Philip (who also became an apostle; John 1:43‚Äì51), although many modern commentators reject the identification of Nathanael with Bartholomew. According to the Synaxarium of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Bartholomew's martyrdom is commemorated on the first day of the Coptic calendar (i.e., the first day of the month of Thout), which currently falls on September 11 (corresponding to August 29 in the Julian calendar). Eastern Christianity honours him on June 11 and the Catholic Church honours him on August 24. The Church of England and other Anglican churches also honour him on August 24. The Armenian Apostolic Church honours Saint Bartholomew along with Saint Thaddeus as its patron saints. Bartholomew is English for Bar Talmai (, transliterated Bartholomaios in Greek) comes from the bar-Tolmay native to Hebrew \\"son of Talmai\\", or farmer, \\"son of the furrows\\". Bartholomew is listed among the Twelve Apostles of Jesus in the three synoptic gospels: Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and also appears as one of the witnesses of the Ascension; on each occasion, however, he is named in the company of Philip. He is not mentioned by the name \\"Bartholomew\\" in the Gospel of John, nor are there any early acta, the earliest being written by a pseudepigraphical writer, Pseudo-Abdias, who assumed the identity of Abdias of Babylon and to whom is attributed the Saint-Thierry (Reims, Bibl. mun., ms 142) and Pseudo- Abdias manuscripts. In art Bartholomew is most commonly depicted with a beard and curly hair at the time of his martyrdom. According to legends he was skinned alive and beheaded so is often depicted holding his flayed skin or the curved flensing knife with which he was skinned. New Testament references In the East, where Bartholomew's evangelical labours were expended, he was identified as \\"Nathanael\\", in works by Abdisho bar Berika (often known as \\"Ebedjesu\\" in the West), the 14th century Nestorian metropolitan of Soba, and Elias, the bishop of Damascus. Nathanael is mentioned only in the Gospel of John. In the Synoptic Gospels, Philip and Bartholomew are always mentioned together, while Nathanael is never mentioned. In John's gospel, however, Philip and Nathanael are similarly mentioned together. Giuseppe Simone Assemani specifically remarks, \\"the Chaldeans confound Bartholomew with Nathaniel\\". Some Biblical scholars reject this identification, however. Tradition Eusebius of Caesarea's Ecclesiastical History (5:10) states that after the Ascension, Bartholomew went on a missionary tour to India, where he left behind a copy of the Gospel of Matthew. Other traditions record him as serving as a missionary in Ethiopia, Mesopotamia, Parthia, and Lycaonia.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Microp√¶dia. vol. 1, p. 924. Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc., 1998. . Popular traditions and legends say that Bartholomew preached the Gospel in India, then went to Greater Armenia. =Mission to India= Two ancient testimonies exist about the mission of Saint Bartholomew in India. These are of Eusebius of Caesarea (early 4th century) and of Saint Jerome (late 4th century). Both of these refer to this tradition while speaking of the reported visit of Pantaenus to India in the 2nd century. The studies of Fr A.C. Perumalil SJ and Moraes hold that the Bombay region on the Konkan coast, a region which may have been known as the ancient city Kalyan, was the field of Saint Bartholomew's missionary activities. =In Armenia= Saint Bartholomew Monastery at the site of the Apostle's martyrdom in historical Armenia, now ruinous Along with his fellow apostle Jude \\"Thaddeus\\", Bartholomew is reputed to have brought Christianity to Armenia in the 1st century. Thus, both saints are considered the patron saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church. One tradition has it that Apostle Bartholomew was executed in Albanopolis in Armenia. According to popular hagiography, the apostle was flayed alive and beheaded. According to other accounts he was crucified upside down (head downward) like St. Peter. He is said to have been martyred for having converted Polymius, the king of Armenia, to Christianity. Enraged by the monarch's conversion, and fearing a Roman backlash, King Polymius's brother, Prince Astyages, ordered Bartholomew's torture and execution, which Bartholomew endured. However, there are no records of any Armenian king of the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia with the name \\"Polymius\\". Current scholarship indicates that Bartholomew is more likely to have died in Kalyan in India, where there was an official named \\"Polymius\\". The 13th-century Saint Bartholomew Monastery was a prominent Armenian monastery constructed at the site of the martyrdom of Apostle Bartholomew in Vaspurakan, Greater Armenia (now in southeastern Turkey). Relics Altar of San Bartolomeo Basilica in Benevento, containing the relics of Bartholomew The 6th-century writer in Constantinople, Theodorus Lector, averred that in about 507, the Byzantine emperor Anastasius I Dicorus gave the body of Bartholomew to the city of Daras, in Mesopotamia, which he had recently refounded. The existence of relics at Lipari, a small island off the coast of Sicily, in the part of Italy controlled from Constantinople, was explained by Gregory of ToursGregory, De Gloria Martyrum, i.33. by his body having miraculously washed up there: a large piece of his skin and many bones that were kept in the Cathedral of St Bartholomew the Apostle, Lipari, were translated to Benevento in 838, where they are still kept now in the Basilica San Bartolomeo. A portion of the relics was given in 983 by Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor, to Rome, where it is conserved at San Bartolomeo all'Isola, which was founded on the temple of Asclepius, an important Roman medical centre. This association with medicine in course of time caused Bartholomew's name to become associated with medicine and hospitals. Some of Bartholomew's alleged skull was transferred to the Frankfurt Cathedral, while an arm was venerated in Canterbury Cathedral. Miracles The Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew by Jusepe de Ribera (1634) Of the many miracles claimed to have been performed by Bartholomew before and after his death, two very popular ones are known by the townsfolk of the small Italian island of Lipari. The people of Lipari celebrated his feast day annually. The tradition of the people was to take the solid silver and gold statue from inside the Cathedral of St Bartholomew and carry it through the town. On one occasion, when taking the statue down the hill towards the town, it suddenly became very heavy and had to be set down. When the men carrying the statue regained their strength, they lifted it a second time. After another few seconds, it got even heavier. They set it down and attempted once more to pick it up. They managed to lift it but had to put it down one last time. Within seconds, walls further downhill collapsed. If the statue had been able to be lifted, all the townspeople would have been killed. During World War II, the fascist regime looked for ways to finance their activities. The order was given to take the silver statue of Saint Bartholomew and melt it down. The statue was weighed, and it was found to be only a few grams. It was returned to its place in the Cathedral of Lipari. In reality, the statue is made from many kilograms of silver and it is considered a miracle that it was not melted down. Saint Bartholomew is credited with many other miracles having to do with the weight of objects. Art and literature The appearance of the saint is described in detail in the Golden Legend: \\"His hair is black and crisped, his skin fair, his eyes wide, his nose even and straight, his beard thick and with few grey hairs; he is of medium stature...\\" Christian tradition has three stories about Bartholomew's death: \\"One speaks of his being kidnapped, beaten unconscious, and cast into the sea to drown. Another account states that he was crucified upside down, and another says that he was skinned alive and beheaded in Albac or Albanopolis\\", near Ba≈ükale, Turkey Pacino di Bonaguida c.1340 Florence St Bartholomew is the most prominent flayed Christian martyr. During the 16th century, images of the flaying of Bartholomew were so popular that it came to signify the saint in works of art. Consequently, Saint Bartholomew is most often represented being skinned alive. Symbols associated with the saint include knives (alluding to the knife used to skin the saint alive) and his skin, which Bartholomew holds or drapes around his body. Similarly, the ancient herald of Bartholomew is known by \\"flaying knives with silver blades and gold handles, on a red field.\\" As in Michelangelo‚Äôs Last Judgement, the saint is often depicted with both the knife and his skin. Representations of Bartholomew with a chained demon are common in Spanish painting. Saint Bartholomew is often depicted in lavish medieval manuscripts. Manuscripts, which are literally made from flayed and manipulated skin, hold a strong visual and cognitive association with the saint during the medieval period and can also be seen as depicting book production. Florentine artist Pacino di Bonaguida, depicts his martyrdom in a complex and striking composition in his Laudario of Sant‚ÄôAgnese, a book of Italian Hymns produced for the Compagnia di Sant‚ÄôAgnese c. 1340. In the five scene, narrative based image three torturers flay Bartholomew's legs and arms as he is immobilised and chained to a gate. On the right, the saint wears his own flesh tied around his neck while he kneels in prayer before a rock, his severed head fallen to the ground. Another example includes the Flaying of St. Bartholomew in the Luttrell Psalter c.1325‚Äì1340. Bartholomew is depicted on a surgical table, surrounded by tormentors while he is flayed with golden knives. Guido da Siena Due to the nature of his martyrdom, Bartholomew is the patron saint of tanners, plasterers, tailors, leatherworkers, bookbinders, farmers, housepainters, butchers, and glove makers. In works of art the saint has been depicted being skinned by tanners, as in Guido da Siena's reliquary shutters with the Martyrdoms of St. Francis, St. Claire, St. Bartholomew, and St. Catherine of Alexandria. Popular in Florence and other areas in Tuscany, the saint also came to be associated with salt, oil, and cheese merchants. Although Bartholomew's death is commonly depicted in artworks of a religious nature, his story has also been used to represent anatomical depictions of the human body devoid of flesh. An example of this can be seen in Marco d'Agrate's St Bartholomew Flayed (1562) where Bartholomew is depicted wrapped in his own skin with every muscle, vein and tendon clearly visible, acting as a clear description of the muscles and structure of the human body. The Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew (1634) by Jusepe de Ribera depicts Bartholomew's final moments before being flayed alive. The viewer is meant to empathize with Bartholomew, whose body seemingly bursts through the surface of the canvas, and whose outstretched arms embrace a mystical light that illuminates his flesh. His piercing eyes, open mouth, and petitioning left hand bespeak an intense communion with the divine; yet this same hand draws our attention to the instruments of his torture, symbolically positioned in the shape of a cross. Transfixed by Bartholomew's active faith, the executioner seems to have stopped short in his actions, and his furrowed brow and partially illuminated face suggest a moment of doubt, with the possibility of conversion. The representation of Bartholomew's demise in the National Gallery painting differs significantly from all other depictions by Ribera. By limiting the number of participants to the main protagonists of the story‚Äîthe saint, his executioner, one of the priests who condemned him, and one of the soldiers who captured him‚Äîand presenting them halflength and filling the picture space, the artist rejected an active, movemented composition for one of intense psychological drama. The cusping along all four edges shows that the painting has not been cut down: Ribera intended the composition to be just such a tight, restricted presentation, with the figures cut off and pressed together. The idea of using the story of Bartholomew being skinned alive to create an artwork depicting an anatomical study of a human is still common amongst contemporary artists with Gunther Von Hagens's The Skin Man (2002) and Damien Hirst's Exquisite Pain (2006). Within Gunther Von Hagens's body of work called Body Worlds a figure reminiscent of Bartholomew holds up his skin. This figure is depicted in actual human tissues (made possible by Hagens's plastination process) to educate the public about the inner workings of the human body and to show the effects of healthy and unhealthy lifestyles. In Exquisite Pain 2006, Damien Hirst depicts St Bartholomew with a high level of anatomical detail with his flayed skin draped over his right arm, a scalpel in one hand and a pair of scissors in the other. The inclusion of scissors was inspired by Tim Burton's film Edward Scissorhands (1990). Bartholomew plays a part in Francis Bacon's Utopian tale New Atlantis, about a mythical isolated land, Bensalem, populated by a people dedicated to reason and natural philosophy. Some twenty years after the ascension of Christ the people of Bensalem found an ark floating off their shore. The ark contained a letter as well as the books of the Old and New Testaments. The letter was from Bartholomew the Apostle and declared that an angel told him to set the ark and its contents afloat. Thus the scientists of Bensalem received the revelation of the Word of God.

St Bartholomew's Street Fair is held in Crewkerne, Somerset, annually at the start of September. The fair dates back to Saxon times and the major traders' market was recorded in the Domesday Book. St Bartholomew's Street Fair, Crewkerne is reputed to have been granted its charter in the time of Henry III (1207‚Äì1272). The earliest surviving court record was made in 1280, which can be found in the British Library. In Islam The Qur‚Äôanic account of the disciples of Jesus does not include their names, numbers, or any detailed accounts of their lives. Muslim exegesis, however, more-or-less agrees with the New Testament list and says that the disciples included Peter, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, Andrew, James, Jude, John and Simon the Zealot.
