There is a difference in opinion as to when he held this office. A standard authority, the Prosopographia Imperii Romani, dates Scipio's tenure to 36/37, based on seniority: his predecessor, Marcus Aurelius Cotta Messalinus, was consul in 20, while Gaius Calpurnius Aviola, his attested successor, was consul the same year as Scipio. However, Syme points to an inscription discovered in Lydia which indicates the date 41/2; thus three men who achieved the rank of consul after Scipio became governor of Asia before him. \\"The wide variations in consular seniority will duly be noted,\\" writes Syme, \\"as conveying the caprice of the Caesars or the influence of their ministers.\\"Syme, \\"Problems about Proconsuls of Asia\\", Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 53 (1983), pp. 195f  Family  Scipio is known to have married twice.

Messalina, empress and wife of Claudius, suspected Poppaea had been the lover of Decimus Valerius Asiaticus; she had Publius Suillius Rufus prosecute her and Valerius Asiaticus. Messalina went as far as to hire agents to force Poppaea to commit suicide; Poppaea died in the year 47.

It was named after the author Sir Thomas Henry Hall Caine CH, KBE by his sons Gordon Hall Caine and Derwent Hall Caine, who began the project, and was the first airport in the British Isles to be named after a person.http://www.abct.org.uk/airfields/airfield-finder/hall-caine- close-lake-ramsey/ From 1935 to 1937 it handled domestic scheduled passenger flights to English, Scottish and Irish airports. By 1937 it had fallen into disuse, primarily due to its location. Close Lake Airfield =Origins= The original site was known as Close Lake Airfield, as it occupied land on Close Lake Farm, which itself was part of the estate of Sir Thomas Henry Hall Caine and was tenanted by John Brew.The Ramsey Courier. Friday 12 April 1935. The location was chosen for its size (about ) and flatness, allowing a take off length of about yards.The Ramsey Courier. Friday, 14 October 1932 A DH. 83 Fox Moth, identical to G-ABVI which operated the first recognized commercial passenger flight from Close Lake Airfield on 11 October 1932. A few light aircraft had used the landing field in the early 1930s, mainly for visits to the Isle of Man for the TT Races. The first recorded passenger flight was on Tuesday, 11 October 1932, from Romford Aerodrome via Stanley Park Aerodrome (Blackpool), The sporadic use of the airfield continued into 1933.Ramsey Courier Friday, 27 January 1933Ramsey Courier. Friday 5 May 1933 =Development= By the early summer of 1934, The airfield was being seriously considered as an aerodrome for the Isle of Man. A two aerodrome concept was favored, with Close Lake serving the north of the island and Ronaldsway serving the south.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday, 22 June 1934 During July 1934, a local architect, Joseph Teare, was tasked with surveying the site at Close Lake. His findings were sent to the Air MinistryRamsey Courier. Friday, 20 July 1934 and Wing Commander Allen, was sent to the airfield in August to verify them.Ramsey Courier. Friday, 24 August 1934 The findings were favorable, and the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, Sir Claude Hill granted Hall Caine a temporary civil licence for an aerodrome on Close Lake Farm in August 1934.Ramsey Courier Friday. 17 August 1934 The temporary operating licence was replaced by a permanent licence granted by the Air Ministry in September.Isle of Man Times Saturday. 8 September 1934 In September 1934, some improvements were made at the airfield, including land filling and the addition of a Nissen-type hangar, a petrol pump, and a telephone.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday, 21 September 1934 Close Lake was seen as a better site for an aerodrome than Ronaldsway,Ramsey Courier. Friday, 07.09.1934 and was said to have a better surface. The site had no obstructions for aircraft landing into the prevailing (southwesterly) wind and the land could be easily drained. One shortcoming, however, was Close Lake Airfield's proximity to high ground about to the south. In comparison, the land at Ronaldsway was uneven, and the large folds in the surface needed filling in, but it was closer to the island's capital, Douglas. Ronaldsway's susceptibility to sea mist and fog had been identified as early as 1934. The introduction of an airmail service at Hall Caine, August 1934 In late September 1934, a deputation from Railway Air Services visited the Isle of Man, and was joined by the Tynwald Aerodrome Committee, to identify a suitable landing ground. They visited many sites on the island, including Ronaldsway and Close Lake. An air mail service was inaugurated in August 1934 by Railway Air Services but ceased in late September. The main reason cited was an unsuitable landing ground for winter operations; Ronaldsway was deemed not up to the required standard, and whilst Close Lake was deemed suitable with regard to the load bearing of the ground, it was considered too small to handle the size of aircraft used for the contract.Ramsey Courier. Friday, 28 September 1934 Hall Caine Aerodrome Both Sir Thomas Henry Hall Caine's sons, Gordon Hall Caine and Derwent Hall Caine, were particularly keen on the development of an aerodrome on the site, as they saw it as another memorial to their late father. They also wished to involve the Ramsey town commissioners in the project, as they felt the aerodrome would bring immense benefit to the town. 222x222px At the time there was talk of linking the aerodrome with another landing ground at The Strang, just outside of Douglas, but this was discounted by Derwent as it would be difficult to convert it into a licensed aerodrome. However, as part of the development at Close Lake Airfield, arrangements for the conveyance of passengers to other parts of the island were undertaken. =Construction= Further work on improving the area began in early April 1935, and Derwent began to oversee some of the work and to make the arrangements needed to start a regular air service to Blackpool. This work included the removal of hedges and fences, the leveling of ground and the addition of extra land to the north and west of the site. This enabled a takeoff run of in any direction and increased the area of the airfield to .Isle of Man Examiner. Friday 1 March 1935, p.10 In an interview with the Ramsey Courier, Derwent said the site was to be known as Hall Caine Manx Airport. This was subsequently changed to the Hall Caine Airport, Ramsey.

United Airways Timetable for their schedule to and from Hall Caine Airport, summer 1935. Whitehall Securities Ltd, owners of United Airways Ltd and their sister airline Spartan Air Lines began to build on their fledgling operation, introducing a schedule from London via Stanley Park Aerodrome (Blackpool), Hall Caine and then onwards to Dublin (Collinstown). By mid-May the United Airways service between Hall Caine and Blackpool was operating four times a day and twice daily to Crosby-on-Eden, Carlisle, using Spartan Cruisers. Another service was started by Northern Airways Ltd and operated in conjunction with United Airways. On 17 May 1935, Northern and Scottish Airways commenced a service from Glasgow (Renfrew) Airport to Hall Caine, operating Fridays, Saturdays and Mondays, using a De Havilland Dragon. Initially, the Glasgow service operated three times weekly, but by early July it had peaked at twice daily. The Manx headquarters of the operation were situated at Hall CaineIsle of Man Examiner. Friday 3 May 1935. with Captain Oscar Garden, a renowned aviator who had made what was described as a \\"sensational\\" flight from England to Australia in 1930 appointed by United Airways to supervise the flying operation. William Goudie was engaged as the traffic officer, tasked with overseeing the ground operation. A busy day of operations occurred at the end of May. Hall Caine received its first _celebrity_ passenger, George Formby, who combined his visit with the Mannin Moar as well as the preparation for his film No Limit. DH84 Dragon. This type of aircraft was the mainstay of United Airway's operation to and from Hall Caine. In the summer of 1935, United took delivery of an Armstrong Whitworth Argosy from Imperial Airways. They had used the type on their Middle East routes from the early 1920s. The aircraft was converted to carry 28 passengers for pleasure flights around Blackpool, but it was also a frequent visitor to Hall Caine when traffic demanded. Argosy G-AACJ (City of Manchester) was the largest type of aircraft to operate in and out of Hall Caine Airport. In October a service was inaugurated between London, Blackpool, Hall Caine and Belfast.Ramsey Courier. Friday 10 October 1935 Blackpool and West Coast Air Services resumed the air mail service from February to October 1935. From 1 November, United Airways secured the main contract from the Post Office. It was then passed on to their subsidiary Northern and Scottish as a result of a round of amalgamations which took place at the end of 1935.Ramsey Courier. Friday, 14 February 1936; p. 4 United Airways Ltd was wholly amalgamated with Spartan Air Lines and Hillman's Airways, and the three names were replaced with British Airways Ltd. This company was to join Imperial Airways in 1940 thus forming the British Overseas Airways Corporation. As the mail service continued, the Post Office insisted that all air mail letters from Douglas and the south of the island were to be handled at Ronaldsway, while the mail from Ramsey and the north was to be collected at Hall Caine. This meant a connecting flight between the two airports. 1936 =British Airways Ltd= The beginning of 1936 saw heavy rain falling across the Isle of Man and the aerodrome was subjected to some flooding in early January which disrupted operations. The problems continued throughout the month and had become so acute that United Airways were forced to transfer their operation to Ronaldsway.Isle of Man Times. Saturday, 1 February 1936; p. 9 The overflowing of the Sulby River inundated a large area of the surrounding countryside and was the main cause of the airport being flooded. It was not until Sunday, 2 February following tests was it decided the airport was safe for the resumption of operations.Isle of Man Examiner.

It was constructed from steel girders and galvanized iron on a concrete base and was capable of accommodating three Spartan Cruisers. British Airways Ltd's Hall Caine Schedule, summer 1936 In the summer of 1936 Northern and Scottish, now acting for British Airways Ltd., were operating the following routes involving Hall Caine: Glasgow (twice daily by the end of September); Liverpool–Blackpool (two or three flights a day); Belfast and Carlisle (daily). The mail link between Hall Caine and Ronaladsway also offered limited passenger availability. The service departed Hall Caine on weekday mornings at 07:00hrs, returning from Ronaldsway at 09:20hrs, with a one-way ticket costing five shillings and a return, seven shillings and six pence.Ramsey Courier. Friday 17 April 1936. At this time a scheduled bus service from Douglas was introduced by the Isle of Man Road Services, allowing passengers to connect at regular intervals with services from Hall Caine. The service departed the Central Bus Station in Douglas, calling at the Sefton Hotel and the Villa Marina. The service continued on to Parliament Square, Ramsey prior to arriving at Hall Caine.The Isle of Man Examiner. Friday 24 April 1936. British Airways Ltd commenced their summer schedule at the end of May, operating from Hall Caine to destinations in England, Ireland and Scotland. A busy day was recorded on Saturday, 18 July, when 160 passengers were landed at the airport. This included the arrival of the Western Brothers who flew in from Elmdon Airport, Birmingham, by private charter to perform at the Villa Marina.Isle of Man Times.

This did, however, lead to the further dredging of the Lough Molla and Close Chairn watercourses in Lezayre, thus reducing the potential of future flooding.Isle of Man Times. Saturday 8 August 1936. p.19. George Formby returned to Hall Caine at the beginning of August. He arrived from Blackpool in a privately chartered aircraft with a party of friends to undertake some sightseeing.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday 7 August 1936. p. 12 In the first two weeks of August Hall Caine handled 1,200 passengers, some of whom were passengers of Railway Air Services whose Ronaldsway services were affected by fog. Again Hall Caine's weather record proved its worth at the end of August. It was again able to offer itself as a suitable weather alternate for Ronaldsway, which was again affected by coastal fog.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday 21 August 1936. p.10 By the end of August Hall Caine Airport had handled approximately 2,500 passengers.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday, 21 August 1936; p. 10 The summer of 1936 also saw a record time set for a flight between Hall Caine and Ronaldsway. A mail flight, piloted by Capt. Wilson flying a British Airways Dragon Rapide with the assistance of a substantial tailwind, is reported to have made the flight in a time of six minutes. The ground speed attained on the flight is reported to have reached in what were described as perfect conditions,Isle of Man Examiner. Friday 21 August 1936 Further records were established at the end of September for flight times to and from Hall Caine. The first was on 26 September, when Capt. Ramsay, in command of a British Airways Spartan Cruiser covered the from Carlisle to Hall Caine in 27 minutes from take off to touchdown. This was followed by a new record between Glasgow and Hall Caine, when Capt. Hankins recorded a time of 39 minutes for the sector.Isle of Man Times. Saturday 3 October 1936. p. 8. Scheduled services intermingled with charter operations, one such being arranged for members of Douglas Borough Council who visited Belfast to arrange the purchase of some horses for the Douglas Bay Horse Tramway.The Ramsey Courier. Friday 8 May 1936. For the autumn of 1936 and into the winter of 1936–7 there was a daily Liverpool – Blackpool – Hall Caine – Belfast – Glasgow service. In the preceding seven months to the end of 1936, 7,000 passengers had been landed at Hall Caine Airport. Spartan Cruisers, Dragons and Rapides were employed with an occasional visit from the Argosy though the latter was becoming increasingly expensive to maintain and was de-registered at the end of 1936. It was also during the latter part of 1936 that a Tynwald Committee were looking into the viability of installing a radio direction finder (RDF) at Ronaldsway as well as Hall Caine. In the end, the Air Ministry decided upon Ronaldsway as the preferred venue for the wireless station, with Tynwald unanimously decided to approve the proposal on Friday 20 November 1936.Isle of Man Times. Saturday, 21 November 1936; p. 11 The increased traffic had necessitated an increase in the staffing levels at the airport, and as part of this recognition the Isle of Man Road Services, in conjunction with British Airways, were in discussion to provide a bus service to meet all arrivals.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday, 19 June 1936; p. 14 In the seven months to November 1936, 7,000 passengers had been landed at Hall Caine. The airport had also accommodated 39 diversions from Ronaldsway on 18 separate days between May and September. The year 1936 ended as it had begun with heavy rain affecting the Isle of Man. Flooding was again prevalent over the Island's northern plain, however, operations at Hall Caine continued without disruption.Ramsey Courier. Friday, 18 December 1936; p. 2 1937 =Northern and Scottish Airways= By the beginning of 1937, the lease on the airfield was held by Northern and Scottish Airways. January saw increased passenger numbers with the corresponding period of 1936, with traffic over the Christmas period of 1936–37 also showing an increase. At this time Northern and Scottish operations from Hall Caine served Belfast, Liverpool, Glasgow and Blackpool. On 26 January a Northern and Scottish Dragon Rapide, specifically fitted out for the task, conveyed an elderly couple (one of whom was on a stretcher) to Hall Caine from Barton Airport, Manchester, so as they could visit their son. The flight time was 50 minutes and the commander of the aircraft was Capt. McGevor, chief pilot of the southern section of Northern and Scottish.Isle of Man Times. Saturday, 30 January 1937; p. 3 In February operations continued despite snow covering the area, and extra flights were operated at the beginning of the month to meet increased bookings.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday, 5 February 1937; p. 12 At the end of February the aerodrome's owners, Hall Caine Manx Airport Ltd, applied for a re-valuation of the lease of the airport. At this time Close Lake Farm comprised , which were let under lease to John Brew at a cost of £400 per annum.Isle of Man Times. Saturday, 27 February 1937; p. 11 Of this were used for the aerodrome and were sub-leased at £125 per annum.Isle of Man Times. Saturday, 27 February 1937; p. 11 A submission was made by Derwent Hall Caine stating that investment in the region of several thousand pounds had been made in the development of the airport, however as was the case with other airports, Hall Caine was running at a loss.Isle of Man Times. Saturday, 27 February 1937; p. 11 The airport had been valued at £223 gross and £215 rateable, and it was the contention of the owners that if the airport was to continue then the rateable assessment needed to be lowered.Isle of Man Times. Saturday, 27 February 1937; p. 11 After consideration it was announced by the Board that the airport should be re- valued.Isle of Man Times. Saturday, 27 February 1937; p. 11 However, it was announced by Northern and Scottish Airways on 21 May that all services operated from Hall Caine had been suspended until 1 June; \\"pending important changes relating to the air services between the Isle of Man and mainland airports.\\"Ramsey Courier. Friday, 21 May 1937; p. 4 The notice also stated that from 1 June Northern and Scottish would resume their service to Glasgow, services to Liverpool, Blackpool, Carlisle and Belfast (Newtownards) were to be abandoned. Consequently, all ticket holders on services operated by Northern and Scottish from Hall Caine were transferred onto Manx Airway services from Ronaldsway Airport. Rationalisation & Closure The primary reason for the cessation of services from Hall Caine was a rationalization of services operated by Northern and Scottish. Northern and Scottish and Manx Airways Ltd entered into an undertaking at Ronaldsway.Mona's Herald. Tuesday, 25 May 1937; p. 5 This resulted in Manx Airways covering the schedules to Liverpool, Blackpool, Carlisle and Belfast which were formerly operated by Northern and Scottish, leaving only the Glasgow service being operated from Hall Caine.Ramsey Courier. Friday, 21 May 1937; p. 4Mona's Herald. Tuesday, 25 May 1937; p. 5 This was a severe blow to the town of Ramsey coming as it did at the beginning of the tourist season. The resumption of services from Hall Caine to Glasgow recommenced in early June. Aimed primarily at the increased traffic as a result of the TT Races, it continued throughout the month with 80 passengers arriving from Glasgow on 16 & 17 June. In addition Lord Londonderry's aircraft diverted into Hall Caine whilst en route from Rochester to Belfast (Newtownards) due to poor weather at the destination.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday, 30 July 1937; p. 12 The Ramsey Ratepayers Association petitioned the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, Sir Montague Butler, with a view to his intervening to preserve commercial air operations from Hall Caine.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday, 28 May 1937; p. 14 The cancellation by Northern and Scottish Airways also lead to a special meeting by the Ramsey Commissioners. It was hoped that Railway Air Services would have commenced operations from Hall Caine, but any hope proved unfounded. The recommencement of the Hall Caine–Renfrew service led to there being six rotations daily (three from Ronaldsway and three from Hall Caine) between the Isle of Man and Glasgow, however, this schedule was unsustainable. Services between Hall Caine and Glasgow continued into August. A further night landing, again conducted with the aid of flares, was carried out on 29 August when a Northern and Scottish aircraft under the command of Capt. McGregor touched down at 21:25hrs.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday, 3 September 1937; p. 12 At the end of September, it was announced by Northern and Scottish that they were to discontinue the service between Hall Caine and Glasgow. Piloted by Capt.

Friday, 8 October 1937; p. 14 1938 =Demise= Following the cessation of scheduled services, there were a few private visitors. The most notable visitor during the summer of 1938 was the celebrated Austrian glider pilot Robert Kronfeld, following what was described as a \\"thrilling flight\\" across the Irish Sea.Ramsey Courier. Friday, 10 June 1938; p. 4 The flight, in a Kirby Kite sailplane was undertaken from Kirby Moorside in Yorkshire and was the first glider crossing of the Irish Sea.Isle of Man Times. Saturday, 11 June 1938; p. 4 The glider was under tow from an Avro Cadet intended to take a track to Blackpool to perform the crossing to Ronaldsway, however due to adverse weather conditions the aircraft and glider were blown off course. Fixing their position over St Bees Head it was decided to make the crossing to Maughold Head. Descending to only above the sea the crossing was completed, but as a consequence of the weather it was deemed necessary to land at Hall Caine.

However the removal of the main hangar and its subsequent erection at Ronaldsway,Ramsey Courier. Thursday, 14 April 1938; p. 4 together with other infrastructure removals, ended such hopes.

Friday, 28 May 1937; p. 4 The fact that Hall Caine Airport was from the main center of Douglas was not in its favor and, as the Ramsey Courier of the day sadly observed, \\"with many airlines trying to make ends meet, there was bound to be contractions of services\\". On the other hand, William Lambden in his work, The Manx Transport Systems makes reference to the fact that the Isle of Man Road Services Ltd. had carried over 10,000 passengers on their special airport route from Hall Caine to Douglas during the 1936–37 period. Subsequent use In 1939 planning permission was granted to Jack Carine to erect a temporary hangar in order to accommodate the Luton Minor, which was based at Hall Caine. An incident of fuel starvation caused damage to the aircraft during a flight on 31 August 1939,Ramsey Courier. Friday, 1 September 1939; p. 4 after which it was described as \\"damaged beyond repair.\\" With the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939, all private flying was banned and therefore what little use was being made of the airfield ceased. The Luton Minor was stored in the hangar for the duration, and was reported to be still there as late as 1957; after which no further information exists. Having transferred from Jurby Aerodrome the airfield was again used, albeit briefly, by the Islanders Gliding club in the mid-1990s. Following an amalgamation, they subsequently relocated to Andreas airfield. RAF During the latter part of May 1937, Sky Hill was the venue for training exercises by the 125th Brigade, Territorial Army, comprising the 5th, 6th and 8th Lancashire Fusiliers.Ramsey Courier. Friday, 28 May 1937; p. 3 As part of this three RAF Hawker Hector army cooperation aircraft were detailed to co-ordinate the training and were hangered at Hall Caine. The aircraft were part of a force based at RAF Odiham and came from 13 Squadron. Having flown to the Isle of Man from RAF Sealand, the aircraft were engaged in the attacking and retreating exercises of the troops; in picking up and dropping messages, and in observation work. During the stay pilots gave an impromptu flying display by diving down onto the airfield and picking up messages.Mona's Herald. Tuesday, 21 December 1937; Section: Front page, p. 1 Another Territorial Army camp, together with associated military exercises, occurred during August, and again three aircraft, together with a detachment of 30 engineers, were based at Hall Caine.Isle of Man Examiner.

As with other exercises, an RAF aircraft was deployed to Hall Caine.Ramsey Courier. Friday, 5 August 1938; p. 6 As part of the United Kingdom Government's Air Expansion Programme, Hall Caine Airport was inspected with a view to the establishment of a permanent RAF Station. However the site was not deemed to be of the required standard and land was instead sourced in the Parish of Jurby which saw the construction of RAF Jurby in 1938.Mona's Herald.

Aircraft Exchange and Mart quickly realized the potential and the pleasure flights proved popular during the summer months.Ramsey Courier. Friday 26 July 1935, p. 4. Keen to publicize the opportunities at Hall Caine, Flt Lt. Duncanson took to the skies in Lord Patrick Stuart's Hendy Hobo and performed a series of aerobatics over Ramsey Bay.Ramsey Courier.. Friday 2 August 1935, p. 4. Location One of the attributes of having an airfield on the northern plain of the Isle of Man is the weather record and this proved favorable for Hall Caine Airport. The northern plain of the Isle of Man has always enjoyed a better weather record than that of the south where Ronaldsway Airport is situated.Isle of Man Times. Saturday 30 January 1937. Plaque commemorating operations from Hall Caine Airport, Isle of Man Because of its coastal location, fog is a particular problem at Ronaldsway with certain wind directions and mainly affects the airport during the summer months. During the operational life of Hall Caine Airport, there was much friendly rivalry between the crews of the airlines flying to the Isle of Man, and opportunities to gain extra revenue were always welcome. From its earliest days Close Lake had been a convenient diversionary airfield for aircraft flying to Ronaldsway; initially taking the form of private aircraft but increasingly commercial operators could rely on Hall Caine being able to offer itself as a suitable alternate. This occurred on numerous occasions with Hall Caine accepting the mail flight when it was unable to land at Ronaldsway. AnotherMona's Herald. Tuesday 16 July 1935., p. 6. instance occurred on Tuesday 6 August 1935, when a West Coast Air Service aircraft from London was unable to land at Ronaldsway and subsequently diverted to Hall Caine.The Ramsey Courier.

When Ronaldsway was \\"out\\" due to bad weather, N.S.A. staff were quick to suggest passengers get a refund and fly with them to Hall Caine which never suffered from fog.Isle of Man Times. Saturday, 5 September 1936; p. 10 From the period of June to September 1936, there was total of 39 diversions from Ronaldsway Airport to Hall Caine as a consequence of fog affecting the south of the island.

It is identical to its sister G-ACYL, which was involved in an accident at Hall Caine Airport, 16 May 1936. On Saturday 16 May 1936, British Airways Spartan Cruiser G-ACYL crashed on landing. Under the command of Capt. Elgey, the aircraft had departed Glasgow (Abbotsinch) on a scheduled service carrying five passengers. The landing surface at Hall Caine was reported as slippery after a period of torrential rain. Having made a safe landing the wheels of the aircraft locked as the brakes were applied, causing it to enter a skid. Heading towards a straight collision with a hangar, Capt. Elgey managed to turn away with the result that one of the aircraft's wings collided with the hangar, throwing it on its side and tearing the wing from the fuselage.Peel City Guardian. Saturday, 23 May 1936; p. 7 Only one passenger, a Mrs. Bridson of Renfrew, Glasgow, sustained a slight injury (a sprained wrist) however after receiving medical attention at a doctor's surgery in Ramsey she was able to continue to her destination, Port St Mary.

This was a simple small fishing boat with an outboard engine and a small cuddy forward. They were made at a factory in Jurby at the North of the Isle of Man. They also produced a 25-foot Midshoreman designed by Dr. E. C. B. Corlett, which was especially suited to the Irish Sea, they were fitted with an inboard diesel engine and Z outdrive. These craft had a forward 2-berth cabin, a 2-berth mid-cabin which doubled up as a galley/saloon, and a separate head. The wheelhouse was open to the rear straight onto the deck. There were only supposed to be three of these ever made, to qualify for an Isle of Man Government business grant, which was never received. Additionally a 33- or 35-foot Offshoreman was produced, which was a motor sailer, with possibly only one or two built. West Marine Ltd also produced a small rowboat/tender with possible sailing capabilities; this is believed to be a GRP copy of an old boat that was lying around the yard at the time.

He is known for books on a number of controversial topics in physics and neuroscience, and on religion, but especially for his writing and public-policy efforts relating to homosexuality, same-sex marriage and the ex-gay movement. Biography Satinover was born in Chicago, Illinois, on September 4, 1947, to Joseph and Sena Satinover. He lived in and around Chicago until moving to California at the beginning of his high school years. Satinover won a National Merit Scholarship. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1971. He obtained a Master of Education degree in Clinical Psychology and Public Practice from Harvard University, a medical degree at the University of Texas, and a Master of Science in Physics at Yale University. He received a diploma in analytical psychology from the C. G. Jung Institute of Zürich, becoming their youngest graduate. He trained there and became an accredited Jungian analyst.New York Times: \\"Psychotherapist Weds Julie Leff,\\" June 11, 1982, accessed March 15, 2012 He received a PhD in physics in the laboratory of Didier Sornette at the University of Nice in France, in 2009. He married for the second time in 1982, having previously divorced and is the father of three daughters. According to two journalists,Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson, Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1994), 306-09. in September 1991, during the confirmation hearings for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Satinover suggested during dinner conversation with President Bush's nephewTimothy M. Phelps and Helen Winternitz, Capitol Games, Hyperion (1992) p. 361 that Anita Hill, if suffering from erotomania (a \\"delusional disorder\\"), might be entirely convinced that Thomas had sexually harassed her, even if he had not, just as a witness for Thomas, John Doggett, (now a conservative commentator) claimed had happened with him. She would even pass a lie detector test, as Hill had, convinced of the truth of what she was saying. Soon Satinover and another psychiatrist, Park Dietz were explaining this possibility to Thomas' Senate sponsor, John Danforth, and White House press secretary, Larry Thomas,Andrew Peyton Thomas, Clarence Thomas: a biography. Encounter Books (2001) pp. 442-448 though as psychiatrists neither would testify about a patient they had not examined. (Psychiatrists brought in by the Democrats similarly refused to testify.Herb Kutchin and Stuart Kirk, Making Us Crazy, Simon and Schuster (2003), pp. 1-6 Satinover was quoted as stating that once he saw the testimony of one of Hill's main critics, John Doggett, he concluded the idea was invalid.

Satinover is a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality. Satinover is Jewish, but says he has an eclectic worldview.http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2013/02/28/1653911/ex-gay- advocates-claim-homosexuality-is-caused-by-parental-abuse/ Writing and research Satinover's book, Homosexuality and the Politics of Truth (1996), published by the evangelical Christian publisher Baker Books, debates the nature of homosexuality from psychological, religious and scientific perspectives, discussing homosexuality primarily in the context of being a condition that can or should be treated, contrary to the views of the mainstream psychiatric and psychological community. Satinover draws comparisons between homosexuality and various pathologies (e.g., alcoholism, pedophilia) and argues that homosexuality involves compulsive impulses. He states that homosexuality \\"is not a true illness, though it may be thought an illness in the spiritual sense of 'soul sickness,' innate to fallen human nature.\\" He also argues that \\"gay activism distorts the truth and harms not only society, but homosexuals themselves\\". Most of the book discusses whether homosexuality is biological and genetic and if it can be changed. About one fifth of the book discusses human sexuality from Jewish and Christian perspectives. In the book's introduction, Satinover states that \\"[i]n the end the debate over homosexual behavior and its implications for public policy can only be decided conclusively on moral grounds, and moral grounds will ultimately mean religious grounds.\\" In 1997, Satinover was called by the State of Florida as an expert witness in Amer v. Johnson, which challenged Florida's law prohibiting adoption by gays and lesbians. \\"Surprisingly, Satinover said in his testimony that 'if two homosexuals wanted to adopt a child, I would have no objection to it if one of them was a man and one of them was a woman' [but] 'the 'needs' of a child includes having [both] a mother and a father'\\". He said that \\"The state of Florida wanted me to argue that the reason the ban should be upheld was because homosexuals made bad parents and I refused to do that.\\" After several years of additional court cases relating to the Florida's anti-gay adoption ban, In re: Gill resulted in the ban being declared unconstitutional in 2010. Satinover has frequently testified regarding his views on same sex marriage. In a hearing before the Massachusetts Judicial Committee in April 2003, he testified that homosexuality is not immutable and that the environment plays an important role in sexual orientation.NARTH: \\"Dr. Jeffrey Satinover Testifies Before Massachusetts Senate Committee Studying Gay Marriage,\\" April 28, 2003, accessed March 28, 2012 Organizations that oppose the expansion of LGBT rights and protections have frequently cited his research in their position papers.Traditional Values Coalition: \\"The So-Called 'Hate Crimes' Bill S. 909, The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act,\\" June 25, 2009, accessed March 28, 2012; MassResistance: Scott Lively, \\"Redeemingthe Rainbow,\\" 2009, accessed March 28, 2012 Selected works * Feathers of the Skylark: Compulsion, Sin and Our Need for a Messiah (Hamewith Books, 1996) * The Empty Self: Gnostic & Jungian Foundations of Modern Identity (Grove Books, 1995), 28 pp. ** also as The Empty Self: C.G.

The series focuses on tentacle rape and S&M; and was adapted into a live action series. The animated series is released in North America by ADV Films under their SoftCel Pictures label. The genre is situated between sci-fi horror and the slasher film. Plot The first episode begins during a rainy night in a thunderstorm when Professor Goda is digging under a large tree in the school yard, when he breaks through a mysterious stone tablet he is attacked by a large tentacled monster and is suddenly infected. Later, millions of students are attending the opening ceremony of the Siren Academy's-(a prestigious boarding school for girls) freshmen welcome. It's at this point we discover that two young girls Sayaka and Atsuko are lesbian lovers who have dated and known each other since high school, are trying to hide their affair from Atsuko's older sister who is currently playing the organ. We then see Professor Goda, who is also attending the opening ceremonies, looking on the crowd of freshmen with evil eyes and a sinister smile on his face. After the ceremony has ended, five girls discover a goblin- looking creature in the background of one of their photo's after one of them got her picture taken; however due to its frighting appearance, they decide to get rid of it instead of keeping it. The scene then shifts to an underground basement in the school's church in which Professor Goda and The Director are raping a freshman student who is tied up and gagged. The Director is dressed up in typical red S&M; bondage gear while Goda is buck naked. Goda comments that he needs the extracts of younger women in order to provide food for an organism that he just discovered. The Director appears to be happily enjoying watching the torture and involves herself in the process by whipping the freshman with her riding crop until the freshman faints from shock. The scene cuts to the dormitory where Sayaka and Atsuko are currently engaging in heavy petting and passionate kissing in their dorm room. The scene develops into a full sex scene until they are interrupted at the end of their lovemaking by a group of fellow students knocking at the door asking them to come to dinner. It's at this point there are clear signs that there is something wrong with the student population as all the girls are listless and uninterested in anything, including Atsuko's \\"impressions\\". Yuko manages to get a little life out of them through her violin playing, but it is clear there is still something wrong. Professor Goda is in the church listening to the music when he is suddenly attacked by what appears to be a fairy, who we later find out is named Rom. The show then cuts to a montage of Sayaka and Atsuko's life at their new school, and Atsuko proves to be an apt athlete in lacrosse and a healthy eater, and is very popular with the other girls in the school, to the disapproval of Sayaka who wants Atsuko all for herself.

This was done in order to circumvent stringent Japanese censorship laws at the time that did not allow the animation of the pubic region and identifiable genitalia. As such, hentai films began using monsters with phallic tentacles to \\"rape\\" women in films. Media =Anime= Angel of Darkness series was licensed by ADV Films and released under their Softcel label. All four episodes were released on VHS and DVD with subtitles only. =Live-action= Angel of Darkness was adapted into five live-action adult films and were released in English by Critical Mass Video. Reception Patrick Drazen regards Angel of Darkness as being an example of the use of \\"horror to express sexual anxiety\\", and as an example of Gothic fiction.Patrick Drazen, (2003) Anime Explosion pp. 70-71 Chris Beveridge regards the hentai to be \\"neither the best nor the worst\\" that he had seen, but enjoyed the third episode over the last, as it was more plot-oriented.

The transmitter is off Grovenburg Road in Lansing.Radio- Locator.com/WXLA History WXLA began broadcasting on September 20, 1982 as WDTB.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1999 page D-219 It originally broadcast on 1170 kHz with 1,000 watts, days only. It used the all news programming of CNN Headline News. The call letters were changed to the present WXLA on June 29, 1984. WXLA was the first radio station to program specifically to Lansing's African-American community with an urban contemporary / R&B; format. In July 2005 the station increased its power and began referring to itself as 10,000 Watt 1180. With its new directional antenna, the station could be heard as far away as Grand Rapids, Bay City and Flint. In 2006, MacDonald Broadcasting purchased WXLA and sister station 96.5 WQHH for $3.65 million. MacDonald switched from the urban adult contemporary format (as \\"Mix 1180\\") to ABC Radio's \\"Timeless\\" (formerly known as \\"Stardust\\") Middle of the Road/Oldies/Adult Standards format in October 2006. The Timeless Classics format had previously aired on co-owned \\"Unforgettable 1320\\" WILS and was moved to WXLA to make room for a new talk format on WILS. In 2010, with the demise of Citadel Media's Timeless format, WXLA flipped to Dial Global's \\"America's Best Music\\" format, which features many of the same songs that Timeless played but also incorporated more traditional adult standards material and pre-1960s hits. (America's Best Music has since evolved to mostly Soft Oldies with a few adult standards songs in the playlist.) Despite the fact that the actual \\"Timeless Favorites\\" format is no more, WXLA continues to use the phrase \\"Timeless Favorites\\" in its imaging. On August 17, 2020 WXLA changed their format from adult standards to soft adult contemporary, branded as \\"Easy 93.3\\" (simulcast on FM translator W227DO 93.3 FM Lansing).WXLA Goes easy in Lansing Radioinsight - August 17, 2020 References External links *Michiguide.com - WXLA History * * Category:Adult contemporary radio stations in the United States XLA Category:Radio stations established in 1982 XLA Category:1982 establishments in Michigan ","title":"WXLA"},{"id":"10501630","text":"The Undeniable LP is the debut album by Detroit rapper and close Slum Village affiliate Phat Kat.Allmusic It was released twice, both on Barak Records.

He was baptized at the age of 15 and began preaching at 18. He was the minister of the congregation at Winslow before moving in 1668 to the church at Horsleydown (Horse-lie-down), Southwark where he remained for 36 years as pastor (1668-1704). This congregation later became the New Park Street Church and then moved to the Metropolitan Tabernacle under the pastorship of Charles Spurgeon. Benjamin Keach was pilloried for writing a catechism It was as representative of this church that Keach went to the 1689 General Assembly and subscribed the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith. Keach was one of the seven men who sent out the invitation to the 1689 General Assembly. The signing of the confession was no mute doctrinal assent on the part of the church, for in the same year they entered into a Solemn Covenant which reflected, at the practical and congregational level, some of the doctrines of the confession. There was a secession from Horse-lie-down in 1673 and the Old Kent Road congregation was formed. Spurgeon later republished the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith for use in the congregation. Keach wrote 43 works, of which his \\"Parables and Metaphors of Scripture\\" may be the best known. He wrote a work entitled \\"The Child's Instructor\\" which immediately brought him under persecution and he was fined and pilloried in 1664. He is attributed with the writing of a catechism commonly known as \\"Keach's Catechism\\", although it is most likely that the original was compiled by William Collins. Keach is also known to have promoted the introduction of hymn singing in the Baptist churches.Benjamin Keach Biography from Spurgeon's Autobiography His church, Horslydown, was probably the first church in England to sing hymns, as opposed to psalms and paraphrases. Keach's hymnbook, published in 1691, provoked heated debate in the 1692 Assembly of Particular Baptists. Among his eschatological convictions, Keach anticipated a major revival amongst the Jews at the end of this age.

Established in 1987, COPLAC advances the aims of its member institutions and drives awareness of the value of public liberal arts education in a student- centered, residential environment. COPLAC campuses are small-to-medium sized (800-7000 students) and the focus is primarily on undergraduate education. As public institutions, COPLAC colleges and universities combine an egalitarian concern for access with academic rigor. Member institutions work to provide a transformative liberal arts education commensurate with that offered by North America’s finest private colleges. Essential features this goal are extensive, integrated arts and sciences core curricula. The majority of campuses are located in small towns and cities, while others are located in rural areas. Some COPLAC campuses have received official designation from their state legislatures or public university systems as the state’s public liberal arts college or the public honors college for the liberal arts. Mission COPLAC serves both external and internal constituencies. It communicates to state and federal policy makers the importance and benefits of providing students with comprehensive public higher education in the liberal arts and sciences. It collaborates with major national higher education organizations like the Association of American Colleges and Universities to advance the aims of liberal learning in a global society. Through its public liberal arts newsletter, the PLAN, campus leaders offer insight into major issues facing public higher education in the new global century. COPLAC organizes and administers a number of member collaborations, including faculty and student exchanges, professional development opportunities for staff, faculty summer institutes, shared study-abroad programs, and enhanced information sharing. COPLAC also hosts regional undergraduate research conferences, where students present the results of senior-year scholarly and creative projects. A web- based undergraduate research journal, Metamorphosis, showcases exceptional student work at all 30 member institutions. Governance The Governing Board of COPLAC consists of the 30 presidents/chancellors or their designees. The Board elects a president of the organization for a two-year term and the full board meets on a semi-annual basis.

It reached number 33 in the UK Singles Chart.Genesis UK chart history, The Official Charts Company. Retrieved 18 May 2012. Song information A light rock song, it describes a man who has been to the future and has seen a bright, happy world where everyone is filled with joy, cities are filled with light, with no fear of war, and all exploitation has ceased as all creatures have happier lives. Once he returns, however, he is pressured to lie about the incident (i.e., to \\"keep it dark\\"). Instead he claims that he was kidnapped by thieves who wanted to take his money. . The cover depicts the three wise monkeys. In the DVD interview accompanying the 2007 re-release of Abacab, the album from which the song comes, composer Tony Banks said that \\"the idea was that this character had to pretend that he'd just been robbed by people and that's why he'd disappeared for a few weeks, and in fact what had happened [was] he'd been to the future and gone to this fantastic world where everything was wonderful and beautiful and everything... but he couldn't tell anybody that, because no one would believe him and the powers that be kept him silent.\\" The song's structure is unusual: the rhythm is in a 6/4 time signature, with a distinctly syncopated rhythm guitar part. Lead singer Phil Collins sings in falsetto for certain lines of the song. The pace overall, particularly the drums, is similar to the album's title track. Music video A music video supported the single release of the song, featuring Collins, Tony Banks, and Rutherford in two different settings. In the first and second verses and the fade out, the band walks along bleak city streets (in Amsterdam) wearing trenchcoats and fedoras. When the chorus comes in, it shifts to the band wearing all-white suits and sunglasses, and walking through a field, with the sun shining. In both settings, Banks mimes with a mini Casio keyboard and Rutherford with the neck from a guitar, while Collins keeps the beat of the song with drumsticks, mostly hitting air, or the walls of the Amsterdam houses.

His son from his second marriage is depicted as a small figure standing at the feet of Elizabeth Mortimer Ledger stone of Thomas de Camoys, 1st Baron Camoys, St George's Church, Trotton plates Thomas de Camoys, 1st Baron Camoys (c. 1351 – 28 March 1421), KG, of Trotton in Sussex, was an English peer who commanded the left wing of the English army at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. Origins Thomas de Camoys was the son of Sir John Camoys of Gressenhall in Norfolk, by his second wife Elizabeth le Latimer, daughter of William le Latimer, 3rd Baron Latimer. Sir John Camoys was the son of Ralph de Camoys (d. 1336) by his second wife Elizabeth le Despenser, a daughter of Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester (executed 27 October 1326). Career From 20 August 1383 to 26 February 1421 he was summoned several times to Parliament by writ, by which he is held to have become 1st Baron Camoys, of the second creation. The first creation of that title had expired on the death of his uncle Thomas de Camoys, 2nd Baron Camoys (d. 11 April 1372), to whom he was heir.; ; In 1380 Camoys was in the retinue of his cousin William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer in an expedition to France, and was knighted by Thomas of Woodstock, then Earl of Buckingham.; He later served in an expedition to Scotland in 1385.. According to Leland (d.1552), Camoys benefited little under King Richard II (1377-1399), and after Richard's deposition in 1399 he attended the first Parliament of the new king, Henry IV (1399-1413). His son, Sir Richard Camoys, was knighted by King Henry IV at his coronation, and Camoys himself escorted Henry's new queen, Joan of Navarre, to England in June 1403.. His loyalty to Henry IV brought him several grants. Prior to the embarkation for France by King Henry V (1413-1422), Camoys was present at a meeting of the King's Council held for the purpose of planning the invasion, and was appointed on 31 July 1415 to the commission which condemned to death Richard, Earl of Cambridge, and Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham, for their part in the Southampton Plot.

By Elizabeth Mortimer he had a son: *Sir Roger Camoys.; Landholdings Camoys inherited the manors of Trotton, Broadwater and Elsted in Sussex, and several manors in Northamptonshire from his uncle Thomas de Camoys, 2nd Baron Camoys (d.1372),; . By his first marriage to Elizabeth Louches he inherited the smaller of two manors at Chiselhampton, Oxfordshire. The fortified manor house at Chiselhampton (now a farm house) is still known as Camoys Court. Death & monument Chest tomb of Thomas Camoys, 1st Baron Camoys, chancel of St George's Church, Trotton Camoys died on 28 March 1421. although as pointed out by Leland (d.1552), and still apparent today, the year of his death is wrongly given as 1419 (M CCCC XIX) on his brass in St. George's Church, Trotton. He was succeeded in the barony by his grandson, Hugh de Camoys, 2nd Baron Camoys. From a court record in 1422, it would appear that he died intestate, with his estate being administered by Geoffrey Colet and William Estfeld Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; National Archives; CP 40/647; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT1/H6/CP40no647/bCP40no647dorses/IMG_0598.htm; 4th entry, with county margin Sussex, in a plea of debt against various people in Sussex. His monument survives in St George's Church, Trotton in the form of a chest tomb in the middle of the chancel on the ledger stone on top of which is a monumental brass depicting himself and his second wife Elizabeth Mortimer. The sides of the chest-tomb are decorated with sculpted quatrefoils and escutcheons. The brass is unusually large, the couple being depicted only slightly smaller than life-size and holding hands. The monument was described by Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner as \\"one of the biggest, most ornate and best preserved brasses in England\\". It is inscribed at the bottom in Latin as follows: :\\"Orate pro a(n)i(ma)bus Thom(a)e Camoys et Elizabeth(ae) eius consortis, qui quond(am) erat d(omi)n(u)s de Camoys baro et prude(n)s Consul Regis et regni Angli(a)e et strenuus Miles de Gartero suu(m) fine com(m)endavit Xpo xxviii die mens(is) Marcii A(nno) D(omi)ni M° CCCC° XIX° (sic) quor(um) a(n)i(m)a(bus)[bz] p(ro)piciet(ur) Deus, Am(e)n.Collectanea Topographica et Genealogica, Volume 5, Page 280, note k (\\"Pray ye all for the souls of Thomas Camoys and of Elizabeth his consort, who once was Lord of Camoys, a baron and a wise counsellor of the king and of the kingdom of England and a vigourous Knight of the Garter.

Life He was the son of the viscount Arnaud de Bourdeilles. Having entered the Franciscan Order at an early age, he was only twenty-four when, at the request of Charles VII of France, he was appointed to the See of Périgueux (1447). During the wars between France and England he was held prisoner for several years by the English, in consequence of his defence of ecclesiastical immunity. In 1468 he was appointed to the Archiepiscopal See of Tours, and in 1483 he was raised to the cardinalate by Pope Sixtus IV. A stanch defender of the rights of the Church against the encroachments of the State, Bourdeilles advocated the abolition of the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges, as may be seen from his treatise, Pro Pragmaticæ Sanctionis Abrogatione (Rome, 1486). Bourdeilles continued, during his episcopate, to practise religious poverty and was intimate friend of St. Francis of Paula. He is mentioned among the Blessed in the Franciscan Martyrology for 5 July. He also wrote Libellus in Pragmaticam Sanctionem Gallorum (Rome, 1484); and a Latin defence of Jeanne d'Arc which is attached in manuscript to the process of her rehabilitation.

Different regions in Hungary may have their own sausage recipes and tastes. The Hungarian sausages may be boiled, fresh or dried and smoked, with different spices and flavors, \\"hot\\" or \\"mild\\". These sausages may be eaten like a cold cut or used in the main courses. The Hungarian cuisine uses the different types of sausages in many ways, in vegetable stews, soups, potato stews like \\"paprikás krumpli\\" (paprika-based stew with spicy sausage and potatoes), bean soups like Jókai bableves,page 24 in meat stews, in some goulash soup variations, pastry dishes and even salads. The smoked sausages may contain bacon, ground pork, beef, boar or lamb, paprika, salt, garlic, black pepper, allspice, white pepper, caraway, nutmeg, zest, marjoram, cayenne pepper, sugar, white wine or cognac. Beef or lamb is usual in halal and kosher Hungarian sausages, which never include pork or boar for religious reasons. The meat is coarsely ground and salted. If garlic is added, it is mashed in water to produce a slurry and added to the meat along with spices. The sausage is then stuffed into natural casings in 1-foot links - usually using the small intestine of the pig. This traditionally took place outside on the fall day when a pig was slaughtered. The sausage is then hung overnight to allow the flavors to meld and some of the grease to drip out. It is now ready to be used fresh and unsmoked. Fresh sausages may have additional ingredients like liver, mushroom, bread, rice, lemon juice, eggs, cream or milk. The unsmoked sausages are typically roasted with sauerkraut or red or green cabbage, and served with mashed potatoes. The dry sausages are cold smoked and hung to cure before use.

At the World Exhibition of Food in Brussels 1935, the Gyulai kolbász was awarded a gold diploma. The sausage may be cut into thin slices and eaten alone or with bread. They are also added to many Hungarian dishes including lecsó and potato/egg casserole (rakott krumpli). *Csabai sausage is made in the town Békéscsaba, and also has Protected Geographical Status (PGI) protection.Csabai kolbász/Csabai vastagkolbász, European Commission It is similar to Gyulai, but somewhat spicier.

It is found along rivers, lakes and lagoons in Sub-Saharan Africa. Description African skimmers and white-winged terns at Kazinga Channel, Uganda African skimmers have long wings, with a black back, hindneck, and crown. The forehead and rest of the body is white, with a bright, long, orange beak that ends with a yellow tip (black tip when immature). Their short forked tail is white, and their legs are bright red. The average size is about long. Their voice is a sharp \\"kip-kip\\". Their bill structure is unique; the lower mandible is much longer than the upper mandible, and is flattened sideways like scissor blades.  Distribution and habitat  The African skimmer is found from Senegal to northern Congo River and southern Nile Valley, southern Tanzania to the Zambezi Valley, and then to KwaZulu-Natal Province (South Africa) and Angola. They live at large tropical rivers with sandbanks for nesting and roosting, lake shores, and coastal lagoons. The African skimmer is generally uncommon and the total populations is estimated at 15,000-25,000 individuals.  Behavior  Chobe, Botswana African skimmers fly in lines over calm waters, and dip their lower mandibles in the water to feed. When the mandible touches a fish, the skimmer snaps its mouth shut. They feed mostly at dawn and dusk and have good night vision. The following fish have been recorded as prey for African skimmers: Micralestes, Tilapia, Barbus, Marcusenius , Hepsetus, Aplocheilichthys and Petrocephalus. = Reproduction = African skimmers nest in loose colonies on large sandbanks. The colonies typically consist of less than 50 pairs and each pair lays 2–3 (rarely 4) eggs in a scrape in the sand. Sometimes African skimmer colonies are mixed with those of other sand bank nesting birds such as collared pratincole, pied avocet and white-fronted plover. =Movements= African skimmers are partial intra-African migrants, they arrive in southern Africa when the water level of rivers starts falling at the beginning of the dry season, i.e. April–June, returning northwards after breeding when rivers start rising again at the start of the rainy season in November–January.

They came from the city of Cáceres in Spain.  Francisco de Caceres  Francisco de Caceres (Alcuéscar (Cáceres) 1539 - Barinas plains 1589) was a Spanish Captain founder of the City of La Grita in 1576, also known as ciudad de Atenas or ciudad del Espíritu Santo. He was governor of the Province of La Grita (Venezuela). His brother Alonso de Caceres (Alcántara, Cáceres, late fifteenth century - ?) was a Spanish conquistador and governor-captain of Santa Marta, who travelled extensively throughout the Americas from Mexico, through Central America, and Peru. He was one of the most active soldiers who served in the 16th-century Spanish conquest. Antonio Dias (Diaz) de Caceres The first reference to any person bearing the name is in a list of heretics, posted according to custom in the cathedral in Mexico City, where the names of Antonio Dias (or Diaz) de Caceres and Catalina de Leon, his wife, occur as \\"Judaizers\\". The latter did penance at an auto da fé held on February 24, 1590 in that city. Their daughter Doña Leonor de Caceres was denounced as a \\"Judaizer\\" by her aunt, Doña Mariana Nuñez de Carabajal (see Francisca Nuñez de Carabajal), before the tribunal of Mexico. Her testimonyCyrus Adler, in Publications of the American Jewish Historical Society iv. 45, 47, 63. gives these data: Antonio Dias de Caceres and Jorge de AlmeidaAdler, ibid. pp. 29-79. were married on the same day, in the city of Parmco, Mexico, to Catalina and Leonor de Carabajal, sisters of the deponent, and, after a visit to Spain, moved to the district of San Paolo in Mexico City. Antonio appears to have lived in another district, in a house which served as a gathering-place for fasting and prayer; and although they all attended mass and otherwise observed the rites and ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church, they practiced their Jewish rites in private. This was soon discovered; the deponent, her mother, and brothers were arrested by order of the Inquisition; and Antonio Dias de Caceres, fearing a similar fate, went to China. There he lived three years, came back to Mexico, feigned at first estrangement from his wife, because she was a \\"Judaizing\\" penitent, and finally, seeming to yield to the entreaties of friends who sought to bring them together, became nominally reconciled to her and set about in earnest to obey the behests of the Mosaic law. Antonio observed caution, dreading the arm of the Holy Office, but persisted, together with his family, in keeping the Sabbath at home. Prayers were recited at home out of a Hebrew book, said to have been written in verse, and the Psalms, without the required Gloria Patri, were chanted by all. His daughter, the above-mentioned Leonor de Caceres, figured as a penitent at an auto da fé held in the city of Mexico on March 25, 1601. A facsimile of a document dated September 6, 1608, containing an account of her trial, is given in vol. iv. of Publications of the American Jewish Historical Society. Isabel Caceres A victim of the Inquisition in Toledo in 1625; wife of Luis Baez. Jacob (Yahacob) Rodriguez Caceres Martyr, who died at the stake in 1665, at Córdoba.

Moseh de Caceres Descendants of Moseh de Caceres One of the founders of the Portuguese community in Amsterdam, who flourished about 1600. Francisco de Caceres (1) Writer of the seventeenth century; son of Daniel de Caceres of Amsterdam. He translated from Italian into Spanish the Vision Deleytable y Summarico de Todas las Sciencias, a work written by Alfonso de la Torre and translated into Italian by Domenico Dolphino. The translation of Caceres, published at Amsterdam in 1663, and dedicated to Don Emanuel, prince of Portugal, consists of two parts, the first dealing with the various sciences, the second with moral philosophy. Of the first part, chapter I treats of the \\"evil of things, and the confusion in the world\\"; the following six chapters treat of logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astrology, and the remaining chapters treat of metaphysics, pneumatics, and physics. Part II discusses ethics and politics. Johann Christoph WolfBibliotheca Hebræa iii. Nos. 903, 1854h. makes this Francisco de Caceres the author also of Dialogos Satiricos, published at Amsterdam in 1616. Meyer Kayserling,Biblioteca Española-Portugueza-Judaica p. 32. however, ascribes that work to (2) Francisco or Jacob de Caceres who was probably a son of Moseh de Caceres, one of the founders of the Jewish- Portuguese community of Amsterdam. The latter Francisco or Jacob also translated into Spanish Los Siete Dias de la Semana Sobre la Creacion del Mundo, a work by Bastasi, dedicated to Jacob Tirado. As the Dialogos Satiricos was published as early as 1616, it is not probable that the author was the former Francisco de Caceres. Francisco (or Jacob) had, so far as can be determined, five sons: (1) Daniel de Caceres: Writer of the seventeenth century; son of Jacob de Caceres. He held the degree of master of arts. Caceres was a friend of Manasseh ben Israel, upon whose works, The Conciliator and On Human Frailty (written about 1642), he wrote approbations. He also wrote a eulogy on Saul Levi Morteira (Amsterdam, 1645). (2) David de Caceres, who, according to Kayserling, died October 18, 1624 at Amsterdam.Kayserling, loc. cit. p. 32. (3) Henrique (or Henry) de Caceres, who lived in England ca. 1650, probably the same who, with Benjamin de Caceres, petitioned the king on April 8, 1661 to permit them to live and trade in Barbados and Suriname.Publications of the American Jewish Historical Society v. 47, 62; Jewish Encyclopedia, ii. 523b. (4) Samuel de Caceres: Dutch poet and preacher and brother-in-law of Benedict Spinoza; died November 1660, at Amsterdam. He was a pupil of Rabbi Saul Levi Morteira of Amsterdam. The title \\"Poeta, Predicador, y Jaxam, de la Ley Sancta Escritor\\" (Poet, Preacher, and Cantor, Writer of the Holy Law), given to Caceres by his contemporaries, shows the eminent position which he occupied in the Jewish community of Amsterdam. \\"De la Ley Sancta Escritor\\" refers to the Spanish translation of the Bible, which he edited, revised, and corrected, and which was published in 1661, soon after his death. (5) Simon de Caceres: Military strategist, merchant, and communal leader; flourished in the middle of the seventeenth century. He was prominent in mercantile affairs in Hamburg, London, South America, and the West Indies; and his transactions extended to many parts of the world. Caceres is described as a chauvinist Jew, boastful of his Jewish descent.Lucien Wolf, Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England i. 56, 73. He joined Antonio Fernandez Carvajal in the acquisition of the Bet Cholim cemetery in London, and was one of the petitioners who signed the document presented to Oliver Cromwell by Manasseh ben Israel in March 1656. Queen Christina of Sweden is known to have interceded with Cromwell on his behalf for certain commercial privileges in Barbados. At a later date the king of Denmark gave Caceres's brother a letter of recommendation to Charles II of England, which was instrumental in procuring for the Jews in the West Indies an extension of commercial facilities. Simon was one of Cromwell's intelligencers; and there are at least two documents among the Thurloe papers which show that his experience was utilized by the lord protector. One is called \\"A Note of What Things Are Wanting in Jamaica\\".Thurloe Papers, ed. Th. Birch, pp. 61, 62, London, 1742. It is a memorandum containing minute advice with regard to fortifications and implements. From a passage in Cromwell's Letters and Speeches, ed. Carlyle (iii. 131), it would seem that Caceres's recommendations were followed, for the needed supplies were forwarded. Together with this memorandum Caceres submitted to the protector a remarkable scheme for the conquest of Chile,Printed in Birch's ed. of the \\"Thurloe Papers,\\" loc. cit. pp. 62, 63. wherein he proposed to enlist \\"men of his own nation\\" (meaning Jews), and offered to lead the expedition in person. In his letter of instructions Cromwell refers to the desirability of hindering the Spanish trade with Peru and Cartagena, and of striving with the Spaniards for the mastery of all those seas. At a later date Caceres presented another plan to Cromwell, which provided for the protection of the Barbados trade and for improving the administration of the navigation act. This document seems to have been unauthorized, and turns out to be a personal application for an office he desired to have created for himself. Daniel (see above) had two (?) sons; (1) Francisco de Caceres and (2) Samuel ben Daniel de Caceres, whose name, if he is not Daniel's son, remains a \\"crux interpretum\\". It is more than probable that the two Samuels have been confounded by bibliographers. Samuel, the poet and preacher, had a son named David de Caceres, who was printer in Amsterdam in 1661. Another person bearing that name was rabbi at Salonica, and afterward (ca. 1650) at Hebron, Palestine. Other individuals A Bernard de Caceres is mentioned in the Calendars of State Papers 1661-68, as residing in the West Indies. One of the chief members of the Jewish congregation in Suriname, whose name is affixed to a special charter of privileges dated October 1, 1669, was Henrique de Caceres,Publications of the American Jewish Historical Society iv. 3. and a Samuel de Caceres is spoken of in Curaçao, W. I., in the year 1692.Corcos, Jews of Curaçao, p. 15. In 1891, a Mr. Benjamin de Caceres officiated at Curaçao in the absence of a rabbi.ibid. p. 47. Luisa Cáceres de Arismendi (Caracas, September 25, 1799 – Caracas, June 28, 1866) was a heroine of the Venezuelan War of Independence. In recognition of her loyalty her remains were entombed in the Panteón Nacional of Caracas in 1876; she was the first woman to be given this honor. Andrés Avelino Cáceres (1836 - 1923) was three times President of Peru during the 19th century, from 1884 to 1885, then from 1886 to 1890, and again from 1894 to 1895. In Peru, he is considered a national hero for leading the resistance to Chilean occupation during the War of the Pacific (1879–1883), where he fought as a General in the Peruvian Army. Carlos Caceres Contreras (1940-) is an economist, academic, entrepreneur and politician from Chile, former Minister of State under General Augusto Pinochet and former president of the Central Bank of Chile. Rafael Cáceres is a Venezuelan chemical engineer pioneer in Latinamerican environmental, health and industrial risk assessment. Esai John Caceres is a handsome Filipino.

It was built in the downtown wharf district, directly across from the railroad station. It has since been repainted and houses several different businesses. Earlier in its existence, the hotel had a set of two pillars in the front of the building. History In the late 1800s the Wharf area of Staunton was the site of the Virginia Central Railroad which crossed the Blue Ridge Mountains to Staunton, thus completing its route between the Shenandoah Valley and the state Capital in Richmond. The American Hotel was constructed by the Virginia Central Railroad in 1855, only one year after the railroad had reached Staunton. During the American Civil War, the hotel served as a \\"receiving hospital\\" for Confederate sick and wounded. In 1864, when Union General Hunter occupied Staunton and burned the station, the American Hotel was spared, probably because the owner, John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch, had developed a relationship with Union officers. In the first year of his presidency, Ulysses S. Grant took a brief vacation trip to White Sulphur Springs stopping overnight in Staunton at the American Hotel. When the news of his arrival spread, a music band that had previously served as Stonewall Jackson’s headquarters band assembled at the station opposite his Hotel room and serenaded Grant. Grant came out on hotel balcony and acknowledged the band by raising his hat. The incident was one of the first public acts of reconciliation after the American Civil War. The Staunton Development Company was on the west end of the building in 1891 and the rest of the building was a shoe factory. Staunton Development Company wanted to renovate and update the Hotel in the Victorian style but did not have the finances. In 1894, the American Hotel became Bowling Spotts & Co, a wholesale grocery. They were receivers over all the railroad systems of the country, from California to the Atlantic Coast. They specialized in the handling of Havana and domestic cigars, chewing and smoking tobacco, teas, spices, high grade canned goods and provisions of all kinds. Between 1921 and 1929, the front part of the building was used as a railway express office. As most downtown cities declined in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the building was no longer utilized. In 1994, Restoration Concepts Inc attempted to rehabilitate the hotel, but the project was never approved. In 2003, Emerald City L.P. renovated the building for professional offices, a café and a banquet room. A two story parking garage was built and an elevator was installed. The building was totally renovated with fire sprinkler systems, fire escape stairways, new HVAC systems, and a complete electrical renovation. Frazier Associates of Staunton was the architect that oversaw the 2003 renovations.

This system is generally composed of base routes, designed to connect communities across the city, and area specific routes numbered by region (with numbers getting larger the further north they operate). On December 5, 1976 all routes in Edmonton not already using a numeral only designation were switched to use a numeral only designation. The Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) is in the process of planning a redesign of the route system, brought about by a new transit strategy that was passed by city council on July 11, 2017. The redesigned system will be composed of: 8 frequent routes operating at least every 15 minutes in core areas of the city, 6 crosstown routes connecting outer quadrants of the city without operating through downtown, 14 express routes connecting outer areas of the city to downtown and other major destinations (including LRT stations and post-secondary institutions), and 82 local routes operating closer to homes. Route numbers will be assigned in a clockwise direction. The following is a list of current ETS routes. The route descriptions depict the path taken by a bus driving from one end of a route to the other end, one way. In most cases the route is identical (or very similar) in the reverse direction. Base Routes (1–23) Generally, base routes have a 30-minute or better frequency through the day and travel along major thoroughfares to popular destinations such as downtown, universities, shopping centres, and LRT stations. { - bgcolor=\\"#ccccff\\" !width=\\"50\\"Route # width=\\"220\\"Locations Served width=\\"350\\"Route Description width=\\"275\\"Service Notes - bgcolor=\\"#eaeaea\\" 1 West Edmonton Mall Jasper Place Meadowlark Downtown Capilano  Starting at the West Edmonton Mall Transit Centre, route 1 travels eastbound on 87 Avenue to the Meadowlark Transit Centre before travelling northbound on 156 Street to the Jasper Place Transit Centre.

Any fare paying passenger can board buses on these routes (not just students). Most post secondary school routes operate September through April. Routes with \\"S\\" suffixes follow part but not necessarily all of the same the path of the same numbered non-\\"S\\" suffix route. Routes 600-799 operate before school starts to get students to school (with the exception of route 747) while routes 800-999 operate after school ends to serve students returning home from school, unless otherwise specified. Routes 600-999 do not display their school special route number on their destination displays. In this case the main display displays either the destination of the bus alone or the phrase \\"School Special\\" while the passenger side windshield display is left to display the school special route number. School special route numbers do not appear on Edmonton Transit bus stop signs. The following is a list of school special routes.

A member of a County Limerick family of Whigs, he entered the Irish House of Commons and was created a peer in 1715 as a reward for his father's support of the Hanoverian succession, after his father declined the offer. At the same time, he was returned to the British House of Commons for Westbury. He contested control of the borough with the Tories led by the Earl of Abingdon until 1727, when he stood down. Evans was the son of George Evans (1655 – May 1720), of Bulgaden Hall, County Limerick and his wife (m. 1679) Mary (née Eyre). Lord Carbery married Anne, daughter of William Stafford, in 1703. She later inherited Laxton Hall from her brother. They had five children: *Stafford Evans (b. 1704), died young *George Evans, 2nd Baron Carbery (d. 1759) *Hon. William Evans (d. bef. 1756) *Hon. John Evans (d. 1758), of Bulgaden Hall, High Sheriff of County Limerick in 1734, married Grace Freke, sister and heiress of Sir Redmond Freke, 3rd Baronet, in June 1741 and had issue, including Sir John Evans-Freke, 1st Baronet *Hon. Anne Evans, married Maj. Charles du Terme in 1734 After the death of Charles Oliver, one of the members for Limerick County in the Irish House of Commons, Evans was elected to succeed him in 1707. He sat as a Whig for the county until 1714. On 12 November 1714, he was appointed governor and constable of Limerick Castle. Evans's father had earlier been a strong supporter of William and Mary but declined King George I's offer of a peerage. However, the peerage was accepted by his son, who on 15 March 1714/5 was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Carbery, of Carbery in the County of Cork, with remainder to the male issue of his father. With the sponsorship of Lord Cowper and other Whigs, Evans and Charles Allanson stood at Westbury at the 1715 election to challenge the Tory interest of Lord Abingdon. The election was held on 25 January 1714/5, and a double return was made: the Tory candidates, Lord Abingdon's nephew Willoughby Bertie and Francis Annesley were returned by the mayor of Abingdon, while the constable returned Evans and Allanson. As the former pair had polled 29 and 28 votes, respectively, to the 19 and 18 of Evans and Allanson, the House of Commons declared the Tories elected on 28 March 1714/1715. Lord Carbery, as Evans now was, and Allanson lodged an election petition with the House, arguing that many of the Tory voters were not entitled to the franchise, and there were allegations of bribery on both sides. The committee ultimately declared that Bertie and Annesley had not been duly elected and that Carbery and Allanson had been; the Whig-dominated House concurred with the findings of the committee, and resolved that the more narrow interpretation of the Westbury franchise was the correct one. On 18 November 1715, Carbery was admitted to the Irish Privy Council. Carbery voted in favor of Whig project such as the Septennial Act 1716 and the unsuccessful Peerage Bill in December 1719, but was not present for the vote on the Religious Worship Act 1718 in January 1718/9, which repealed the Occasional Conformity Act 1711 and Schism Act 1714. In the 1722 election, Carbery and Thomas Bennett stood against James Bertie (brother of Lord Abingdon) and Annesley; the Tory candidates were returned by the mayor. Carbery and Bennett again petitioned against the result, alleging undue practices and that they had received a majority of the votes. Although the results of the election were in their favor, they were unable to produce the original copy of the poll, and their petition was dismissed on 25 February 1723/4. Bertie had also been returned for Middlesex and chose to sit for that constituency; in the ensuing by-election at Westbury in 1724, Carbery defeated Edward Conway and returned to Parliament. He did not stand at the 1727 election. Carbery's appointment as governor and constable of Limerick Castle was renewed in 1740. He died on 28 August 1749 and was succeeded by his son George. Lady Carbery died in 1757. Notes References *Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors). Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage (1990 edition).

The film was distributed by Filmservice Distributors Corporation as a double feature with Okefenokee. The Monster of Piedras Blancas was influenced by Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954). Kevan, who had supervised the manufacture of the Gill-man suit and worked on Mole People costumes at Universal-International, created the Piedras Blancas monster costume. Kevan employed several of his former Universal associates on the picture, including soundman Joe Lapis and prop master Eddie Keys. Plot In the sleepy California lighthouse town of Piedras Blancas, Sturges (Harmon), the lighthouse keeper, is very superstitious and concerned for the safety of his teenage daughter, Lucy (Carmen). He leaves food for a sea monster who lives in a nearby cave. The locals disregard him at first, but they begin to take notice when the bodies of people killed by the monster are found on the beach. A local scientist identifies a scale found near one of the bodies as belonging to a \\"diplovertebron\\", a prehistoric amphibious reptile long presumed extinct. Cast * Les Tremayne as Dr. Sam Jorgenson * Forrest Lewis as Constable George Matson * John Harmon as Sturges, the Lighthouse Keeper * Frank Arvidson as Kochek, the Storekeeper * Jeanne Carmen as Lucille Sturges * Don Sullivan as Fred * Pete Dunn as Eddie/the Monster * Joseph La Cava as Mike * Wayne Berwick as Little Jimmy Production Both Berwick and Kevan toiled in unbilled obscurity as contract employees at Universal-International. Berwick had been an uncredited dialogue director at U-I and at Columbia prior to that, working with the likes of William Castle and Jack Arnold. Kevan in particular chafed under the stewardship of Bud Westmore, the head of the studio's makeup department,who seldom allowed employees like Kevan or sculptors Chris Mueller and Millicent Patrick to receive publicity. Berwick and Kevan formed Vanwick Productions and became independent producers. The Monster of Piedras Blancas, their first film, was designed as a takeoff on U-I's popular Creature from the Black Lagoon, whose iconic monster suit Kevan had helped manufacture. For this film's fictional \\"diplovertebron\\", Kevan cut cost and labor time by using existing molds for the feet (cast from those of the Metaluna Mutant from This Island Earth) and the oversized hands (designed originally for The Mole People). Actor/stuntman Pete Dunn wore the green-hued monster suit in the film and did double-duty playing the bartender character. Parts of the rubber monster suit showed up years later in the TV show Flipper, in the episode \\"Flipper's Monster\\", which was directed by Ricou Browning, who had performed the Gill-man swimming scenes in Creature From the Black Lagoon.The Creature Chronicles: Exploring the Black Lagoon Trilogy by Tom Weaver, David Schecter and Steve Kronenberg Universal gave a great deal of unofficial cooperation to the production, since it was going through a period of budget problems. Vanwick received sweetheart deals for production vehicles and equipment, the studio's way of helping many of its laid-off technicians who found work on the independent film. The film's end budget was $29,000. Top-lined Sullivan would appear in a number of other genre films afterward, such as The Giant Gila Monster. This was the only lead role of B-movie actress and pin-up model Carmen, best known as a trick-shot golf \\"expert\\". Character actor Lewis was primarily known for his radio work, as was Tremayne. Wayne Berwick, who played \\"Little Jimmy\\", was the son of director Irvin Berwick and the godson of prolific actor Harmon. The film was shot entirely on location, but oddly enough, not at the real Point Piedras Blancas, which is north of San Simeon on the California coast. The lighthouse locations were shot at the Point Conception lighthouse near Lompoc, and the film's \\"town\\" was actually the seaside city of Cayucos, about 30 miles south of the real Piedras Blancas. Several scenes broke new ground for onscreen gore, such as the monster making a shock entrance carrying a bloody human head and a later shot of the same head with a crab crawling across the face. Release =Home media= The Monster of Piedras Blancas was released on VHS by Republic Pictures Home Video on January 1, 1998. It was released for the first time on DVD and Blu-ray on September 13, 2016 by Olive Films. Reception The Monster of Piedras Blancas received mostly negative reviews from film critics upon its release, with many calling it \\"amateurish\\". Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film one and a half out of four stars, calling the film \\"obvious and amateurish\\" while also criticizing its sluggish pacing. TV Guide rated it one out of four stars, stating that the film was \\"a distinctly subpar effort\\", with the monster's design being the film's only item of interest. In his book VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever, Jim Craddock gave the film a \\"WOOF\\", the book's lowest rating. Craddock was critical of the film's acting and special effects, which he felt were poor and \\"amateurish\\". Dave Sindelar from Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings gave it a mixed review, complementing the film's gory effects, soundtrack, and Sullivan and Tremayne's performances. However, he criticized the film's script, dialogue, and monster design. AllMovie gave the film a positive review, calling it \\"a horror movie with a lot of familiar elements but just enough offbeat touches to keep viewers coming back for 50 years or more\\".

Creative origins John Kelly was initially created by Dwayne McDuffie and Gregory Wright as a pseudo-preview of their then-upcoming relaunch of Deathlok as well as to provide existing in- continuity backstory for that series prior to its launch. Gregory Wright is solely credited for re-creating him as Siege.Deathlok vol.2 Annual #2  Fictional character biography  After reverse engineering and deconstructing the body of the original Deathlok, Luther Manning, Harlan Ryker of the Roxxon Oil subsidiary Cybertek Systems built a proto-type of a new, vastly improved Deathlok cyborg. Colonel John Kelly, a disenfranchised veteran of the Vietnam War who had recently been fired from his job as a police officer, volunteered to become a scientific guinea pig, serving as the wetware basis for Ryker's project. The remains of John Kelly's original body have been incorporated into the framework of the Deathlok cyborg. However, in his first outing as the professional soldier Deathlok he rebelled against his computer's pre- programmed mission objectives and the onboard computer system electrocuted his brain as it determined Kelly to be 'malfunctioning.'Marvel Comics Presents vol. 1 #62. Some time later, after Michael Collins had been operating as Deathlok for a number of months, the remains of John Kelly's brain were mutated into the horrific creature called Biohazard.Deathlok Vol. 2 #12-15 Collins then discovered within the Deathlok computer's databanks a file named \\"John Kelly.\\" Opening this file he discovered a copy of John Kelly's consciousness preserved as pure data inhabiting the file in a dormant state. Upon his opening of the file, the copy of Kelly infected Michael Collins's own brain operating as a second consciousness to the annoyance of them both.Deathlok vol. 2 #17 This situation did not persist long, however, as shortly afterwards Deathlok discovered Harlan Ryker to be working on a new, much improved series of cyborg soldiers, this time with lobotomized brains to avoid the issues he had experienced with both Kelly and Collins. During the ensuing battle the copy of Kelly's consciousness was transferred into the mind of one of the newer cyborgs, freeing Collins from playing host to his unwanted guest and giving Kelly back a semblance of life. As a cyborg, with Deathlok, Silver Sable and the Wild Pack, he battled Mainframe, Ben Jacobs, and the Cyberwarriors. Kelly christened himself Siege after a nickname an old war buddy had given him.Deathlok vol. 2 #19 With Deathlok and Coldblood, he battled Harlan Ryker, Mainframe, Ben Jacobs, and the Cyberwarriors.Deathlok Vol. 2 #20-21 Siege operated as a mercenary for some time working for Silver Sable, S.H.I.E.L.D., and various others. With Silver Sable, the Wild Pack, Next Wave, and the Knights of Wundagore, he battled the Genesis Coalition and the Cyberwarriors.Silver Sable #11-12 He defeated an airstrike on U.S. troops by a hostile foreign power in the mideast.Deathlok Annual #2 With Deathlok, he battled Timestream and his mercenaries in Australia.Deathlok Vol. 2 #27-28 With Deathlok, he experienced the Goddess's epiphany.Deathlok Vol. 2 #29 Alongside Daredevil, he battled Venom and the Hand.Daredevil vol. 1 #323 With Deathlok and Godwulf, he battled Timestream, the Demolisher, and Luther Manning in the past.Deathlok Vol. 2 #31-34 =The Initiative / Marvel Zombies 3= During the Superhero Civil War, Siege joined the Initiative and was assigned to lead the Florida state team the Command, along with Wundarr the Aquarian, Jennifer Kale and the Conquistador. The team investigates a disturbance in the Citrusville swamp (home to the Man-Thing and the Nexus of all Realities). The Conquistador is torn apart. Wundarr is infected but purges himself. Siege is bitten on the face by a zombie and despite his cybernetic nature was quickly turned as well. He attacks Jennifer Kale, saying he only wanted her on the team because of her 'barbarian bikini' outfit she formerly wore. His onboard computer alerts A.R.M.O.R. to the fact that he was seemingly malfunctioning. The cyborg part shoots off Siege's head.Marvel Zombies 3 #1  Powers and abilities  As Siege, John Kelly possesses superhuman strength speed, stamina, and durability, and is said to be stronger than the Michael Collins version of Deathlok.Deathlok vol.1 #2 Siege possesses a massive cyborg body. The left half of his face is in a semi-decomposed state. The right half of his face is in an armored cybernetic implant. He is an excellent hand-to- hand combatant with extensive combat training. Siege's built-in database is capable of a myriad of functions, including long-range surveillance and tracking systems and self-diagnostic and repair functions. As Kelly's personality and mental patterns have been encoded into the Siege cyborg body in machine language, Siege is impervious to mental scans. Siege's simplified digestive system can only absorb a liquid nutrient formula; he cannot digest ordinary food. Siege cannot feel any tactile sensations. He also possesses a wide array of weapons and sensor systems, as well as jet boosters built into his legs enabling flight at supersonic speeds. Siege's cyborg body possesses a built-in Gatling assembly on his right forearm capable of discharging 100 low- yield plasma bursts per second. His right forearm contains a built-in plasma cannon capable of significantly more powerful discharges. He wears a woven metal-mesh body suit of considerable durability. His paraphernalia was designed and manufactured by former Cybertek scientists including Ben Jacobs, Stanley Cross, Dr. Hu, Dr. Fox, and Dr. Borruso. Possibly because the organic portions of his body are not his own, or possibly because the brain he inhabits was lobotomized, Siege is unable to feel anything physically and has a very limited emotional range. Michael Collins theorized the cause of this was that Siege was not actually John Kelly, but simply a rogue data packet that believed itself to be Kelly; regardless, he has acknowledged that Siege is alive. Siege has described the way he experiences his pseudo-life as being akin to playing a video game.Deathlok vol. 2 #21 References External links * Category:Characters created by Dwayne McDuffie Category:Comics characters introduced in 1990 Category:Comics characters introduced in 1993 Category:Fictional cyborgs Category:Marvel Comics superheroes ","title":"Siege (John Kelly)"},{"id":"10502283","text":"The Nazca Province () is one of five provinces of the Ica Region of Peru.

BBC. 6 April 2007Luigi Comencini. The Guardian was an Italian film director. Together with Dino Risi, Ettore Scola and Mario Monicelli, he was considered among the masters of the commedia all'italiana genre. His daughters Cristina and Francesca are both film directors. Biography His first successful movie was L'imperatore di Capri, featuring Totò. Comencini's 1953 Pane, amore e fantasia, with Vittorio De Sica and Gina Lollobrigida, is considered a primary example of neorealismo rosa (pink neorealism). It was followed by Pane, amore e gelosia. After first directing Alberto Sordi in La bella di Roma (1955), Comencini again worked with Sordi in what is considered his masterwork, Tutti a casa, a bitter comedy about Italy after the armistice of 1943. The film won the Special Golden Prize at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival. Also set in World War II, but devoted to the Italian partisans, is La ragazza di Bube (1963). This was followed by Incompreso (1966, based on the English novel by Florence Montgomery). Comencini obtained an outstanding success with what is ranked amongst the best productions of Italian television, The Adventures of Pinocchio (1972). In the same year, he directed the feature film Lo scopone scientifico, a dark comedy with Sordi and Silvana Mangano. In 1975, he released the mystery La donna della domenica, featuring Marcello Mastroianni, Jacqueline Bisset and Jean-Louis Trintignant. Comencini's subsequent works were characterized by the presence of famous Italian actors of the time: Ugo Tognazzi in Il gatto (1977), or Nino Manfredi in his episode of Basta che non si sappia in giro. In the 1980s, Comencini's movies met with less success but his Cuore television series of 1984 was praised. He died in Rome after a long illness in 2007.

For nearly thirty years he labored in the province of Kiang-nan, building, it is said, more than ninety churches and forty-five chapels. In 1665, he was exiled from Peking to Canton, where he died (according to Sommervogel, at Shanghai). Works He wrote and published numerous books in Chinese, most of which were reprinted by the Jesuit missionaries in the nineteenth century. Among these are a treatise on the Eucharist, instructions on the Decalogue and on the Commandments of the Church, a refutation of divination, and particularly a Catechism, entitled in Chinese 《天神會課》Conversations of the Angels. The Russian Archimandrite Hyacinth (Bichurin), who was at the head of the Orthodox mission at Peking, published in the second decade of the nineteenth century an extract of this catechism, adapted to the Greek Rite, in which he omitted everything that disagreed with the Russian Orthodox teaching. Brancati also composed in Chinese several volumes of sermons and homilies for the Sundays and feast days of the ecclesiastical year. His work on the Chinese rites was published in two volumes at Paris in 1700. It bears the title De Sinensium Ritibus politicis Acta.

History Cannon at James Street North Cannon Street was originally called Henry Street. The section between Bay and James Streets was called Miles Street. The origins of the Cannon street name remains a mystery for local historians. Cannon Street today at Brian Timmis/ former Ivor Wynne Stadium/ Tim Horton's Field location is also known as Bernie Faloney Way which is named after the quarterback who played for the local CFL team, Hamilton Ti-Cats, between the years of 1957-64. On 24 May 1909 a Coney Island-type amusement park was opened in Hamilton. It was known as Maple Leaf Park and was bounded by Barton Street (north), Ottawa Street (east), Cannon Street (south), Rosslyn Avenue (west). It failed to attract enough visitors to keep the gates open and only lasted a year. Investors of the Park sold the land to local real estate speculators for $25,000 interested in the property because the land itself was a valuable commodity in the booming East Hamilton market.

It was designed by architects Schultze and Weaver and was built in 1925. It was the downtown terminus for the \\"Hollywood Subway\\" branch of the Pacific Electric Railway Interurban rail line. Currently it is a luxury apartment building. It is near Pershing Square. When the Metro Red Line, the replacement for the Hollywood Subway, was built, the Pershing Square station was built nearby. History Entrance to Subway Terminal Building As street traffic increased in downtown Los Angeles, the Pacific Electric Railway undertook its most ambitious project, a dedicated right of way into downtown through a subway - the existing terminal in the Pacific Electric Building at Sixth and Main was reached by shared street running. Responding to the traffic congestion that clogged the streets, the California Railroad Commission in 1922 issued Order No. 9928, which called for the Pacific Electric to construct a subway to bypass downtown's busy streets. Plans for the \\"Hollywood Subway,\\" as the project came to be known, were drafted as early as February 1924, and ground was broken in May of the same year. Other versions via Internet Archive. The Subway Terminal Building was built to conform to the height limit imposed on all downtown construction. The other end of the subway line emerged at the surface at the Belmont Tunnel / Toluca Substation and Yard. After 18 months of construction and $1.25 million in expenditures ($ adjusted for inflation), the Subway officially opened to the public on December 1, 1925, Alternate Link via ProQuest. between the intersection of Beverly and Glendale Boulevards in Westlake, and the Subway Terminal Building. Boarding passengers at the underground platforms, The early years of the Subway were widely met with success, as it emerged as one of Los Angeles's most popular modes of public transit throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Ridership hit an all-time high during the World War II-era; in 1944 – considered to have been the Subway's peak – trains carried an estimated 65,000 passengers through the tunnel each day. =End of rail traffic= Subway Terminal Building from northeast The unprecedented growth which characterized the Los Angeles region in the postwar years ultimately led to the closure of the Subway in the 1950s. Increasing dependence on the automobile as well as the emergence of a complex network of freeways throughout Southern California drastically reduced ridership, forcing Pacific Electric to close the Subway in 1955. The last train to carry passengers – carrying a banner reading \\"To Oblivion\\" – traversed the tunnel on the morning of June 19, 1955. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Shortly thereafter, Pacific Electric removed the tracks and trains from the tunnel and closed the station within the Subway Terminal Building. =Office building= The building served as an office building for many years. The tunnel remained intact until December 1967, when the section from Flower Street to just west of Figueroa Street was filled in. When the Metro Red Line, the replacement for the Hollywood Subway, was built, the Pershing Square station was built nearby. =Renovation to Metro 417= In 2007, the Subway Terminal Building, historic cultural monument #177, has been renovated as \\"Metro 417\\", a luxury apartment building owned by Forest City and built by Swinerton Builders. Concerns were raised for the historic Florentine exterior when a 76-story skyscraper, Park Fifth, was initially proposed on the former site of the Philharmonic Auditorium behind the building. In 2014, the new owner, San Francisco real estate investment firm MacFarlane Partners, announced that the Park Fifth development was going ahead with 650 units in a high-rise apartment building. An outdoor paseo would be built between the new complex and the Metro 417 apartments with tables, chairs, and lighting. Main entry The floor tile in the entryway reads \\"SUBWAY TERMINAL”.

The station is an affiliate of K-LOVE. History 94.1 began in the early 1940s as WBUY-FM by Davidson County Broadcasting as a simulcast partner of their AM station WBUY at 1440 on the dial. By the early-1970s separate calls of WLXN were acquired for the FM station but it remained simulcast with WBUY until 1976, when the station would break away from the simulcast at certain times during the day to air Christian programming. WLXN's programming had become largely separate from that of WBUY by late 1983. On January 1, 1984, the Christian programming and WLXN call letters were transferred to the AM station and the WBUY call letters came to the FM, which then initiated a country music format. In April 1985 WBUY-FM changed call letters to WKOQ(\\"Q-94\\") and continued the country format, increasing its power to cover the entire Greensboro-Winston-Salem-High Point market. In 1988 WKOQ became WWGL (\\"We Witness God's Love\\"), a Christian radio station which emphasized southern gospel music and later Contemporary Christian.August L. Meyland III, \\"Lexington Man Gives a Lifetime to Gospel Radio,\\" Greensboro News & Record, July 6, 1990.John Railey, \\"Air Gospel: Christian Radio Broadcasting Enjoys Growing Audiences As More People Look for Spiritual Guidance,\\" Winston-Salem Journal, August 28, 1999. Another signal boost was made several years later when WWGL built a new, taller tower north of Lexington, which it would eventually share with WFDD.Susan Ladd, \\"WFDD Tower Extends Public Radio Station's Range,\\" Greensboro News & Record, September 13, 1994. In 2000, the station began calling itself WTHZ (\\"Hitz 94\\"), playing mostly 1980s' music. The station eventually evolved to a Hot AC format, still using the \\"Hitz 94\\" name, with the slogan \\"The 80s, 90s, and Now.\\" The station began the oldies format (music from roughly 1964-1984) in November 2006 after local Entercom oldies outlet WMQX flipped to country music. First calling itself \\"Your Station for the Oldies\\", then \\"the Best of the '60s, '70s and '80s\\", Majic 94.1 later used \\"The Carolinas' Greatest Hits\\" with a very large playlist primarily of the 1960s to 1980s top 40 songs. On March 14, 2010; the station began leasing its frequency to the Educational Media Foundation, who switched the station to K-LOVE. Station owner Gig Hilton said advertisers were unwilling to buy time on the station because it attracted an older demographic, and the big companies who owned several stations could offer cheaper advertising rates. The recession made the deal from Educational Media Foundation very attractive. Hilton did say switching back to oldies would be considered if the situation changed or if he was able to move the transmitter closer to Charlotte (see below). He also said that many listeners had complained. The station's call letters were changed to WWLV to better reflect its new format in late March 2010. In 2013, Bible Broadcasting Network requested a translator at 93.9 FM. On February 14, 2014, the station was sold outright to EMF at a purchase price of $10,507,985. Tower controversy Due to its location in Lexington, roughly halfway between Charlotte and Greensboro, WWLV's signal covers roughly three-fourths of both the Charlotte and Triad markets. It easily covers the northern portion of the Charlotte market (including Statesville, Mooresville, Kannapolis and Albemarle), and provides at least grade B coverage of most of Charlotte itself. As WTHZ, it acquired a fairly loyal following in the northern portion of the Charlotte market, which hasn't had a full-market oldies station since WWMG-FM (Magic 96.1) flipped to CHR as WIBT. For many years, Davidson County Broadcasting has been trying to build a tower in western Rowan County in Salisbury, which is part of the Charlotte market. It also applied to move its city of license to Faith.http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=WTHZ, Retrieved on 2009-08-06 This location would significantly improve its coverage in Charlotte, but it would presumably still be reckoned as a Triad-market station. Hilton proposed to build a tower in Mount Ulla, east of Mooresville. However, in 2005, Rowan County commissioners rejected a conditional use permit for the tower due to concerns that the tower would pose a safety hazard to Miller Airpark, a nearby private air strip. Several pilots, as well as a state aviation official, said the tower would cause problems for the airplanes landing and taking off. While the Federal Aviation Administration found \\"determination of no hazard,\\" the FAA only had authority over public airports. The Rowan County Superior Court upheld the rejection in June 2006, and the North Carolina Court of Appeals also agreed with the county in 2007. Hilton claimed that the private air strip was given more favorable treatment than a public airport.Seth Stratton, \\"Davidson Broadcasting Loses in Court of Appeals Ruling,\\" The Dispatch, September 27, 2007. Richard L. and Dorcas Parker, owners of the property where the tower would be located, offered free space on the tower for county emergency communications, but in February 2009 county telecommunications director Rob Robinson said the tower would not give the area the coverage needed. Planning director Ed Muire said the communications equipment would not exempt the tower from the usual zoning procedures.Jessie Burchette, \\"Mount Ulla Couple Still Trying to Get Radio Broadcast Tower on Property, The Salisbury Post, March 22, 2009. On May 19, the county zoning board of adjustment ruled Muire was correct.Jessie Burchette, \\"Mount Ulla Tower Ruling Upheld,\\" The Salisbury Post, May 20, 2009. The Parkers requested that of their farm be annexed by Mooresville, which declined on March 1, 2010 to do so. However, most of the county commissioners who turned down a conditional use permit in 2005 were replaced, and Hilton decided to try again. This time, he was requesting a tower, which Davidson County Broadcasting intended to show has been declared \\"no hazard\\" by the FAA. After three days of hearings in August 2011, county commissioners approved the tower. According to the FCC construction permit, the station would have to reduce its power to 43,000 watts as a result, with a signal favoring Charlotte more than Greensboro. However, the license would remain in Lexington. The Miller Air Park Association appealed the decision, along with several private citizens concerned that the tower would threaten the area's rural character. In September 2012, Rowan County Superior Court judge W. David Lee ruled that the change in tower height was not enough to justify revisiting the matter, meaning that the county will have to dismiss the application. Lee pointed out that at the original hearing, concerns had been raised that any tower higher than would pose a safety hazard. County commissioners voted to appeal the decision. An appeals court upheld the ruling February 18, 2014. A month later, commissioners voted not to take further action. In October 2013, Hilton dropped his application for a tower because of some missing information that would allow a decision in his favor to be appealed. He said he would apply again once the missing information was added. On January 23, 2014, the Iredell County Zoning Board of Adjustment turned down a special use permit for an tower in Iredell County.

For example, a temperature deviation of +8 °C means that the air at any given altitude is 8 °C (14 °F) warmer than what standard day conditions and the measurement altitude would predict, and would indicate a higher density altitude. These variations are extremely important to both meteorologists and aviators, as they strongly determine the different properties of the atmosphere. For example, on a cool day, an airliner might have no problem safely departing a medium length runway, but on a warmer day, the density altitude might be higher, require a higher speed ground speed and true airspeed prior to liftoff, which would require more acceleration, a longer runway, and a reduced climb rate after liftoff. The pilot may choose to reduce the gross weight of the aircraft by carrying less fuel or reducing the amount/weight of the cargo, or even reducing the number of passengers (usually the last option). Not carrying sufficient fuel to complete the flight to the destination, the pilot would plan an intermediate fuel stop, which would likely delay the final destination arrival time. In meteorology, departure from standard day conditions is what gives rise to all weather phenomena, including thunderstorms, fronts, clouds, even the heating and cooling of our planet. Standard day parameters For Pilots: At sea level, Altimeter:29.92 in/Hg at The \\"standard day\\" model of the atmosphere is defined at sea level, with certain present conditions such as temperature and pressure.

JODI RUDOREN, New York Times, 4 September 2014  Location  The Erez Crossing is part of a complex that formerly included the Erez Industrial Park. The crossing connects Israel's Highway 4 with Gaza's Salah al-Din Road. Until the early 1970s, a railway line connecting Israel and the Gaza Strip passed through the Erez Crossing. Today, the railway has been dismantled in the Gaza Strip, and on the Israeli side Israel Railways' active railway line ends about 4.5 km northeast of the crossing, though in the future it may be re-extended to the crossing to provide cargo service to the Gaza Strip.  Movements  Until September 2000, more than 26,000 Palestinian residents were able to travel to and through Israel daily (some 800,000 per month). After the start of the Second Intifada, this number dropped to less than 900 per day. In 2004, there were 43,440 crossings at Erez into Israel monthly, on average. After the Hamas takeover of Gaza, the number dropped to 2,175 in 2008. After the Israel–Hamas ceasefire in 2014, the number increased to 15,000 per month in 2015. According to Gisha, 15,388 Palestinians used the Erez Crossing in January 2016 out of Gaza, the sole crossing.

Outgoing bishops, neighbouring bishops, the faithful, the apostolic nuncio, various members of the Roman Curia, and the pope all have a role in the selection. The exact process varies based upon a number of factors, including whether the bishop is from the Latin Church or one of the Eastern Catholic Churches, the geographic location of the diocese, what office the candidate is being chosen to fill, and whether the candidate has previously been ordained to the episcopate. History =Early Church= It's unclear when the notion of a monarchial bishop emerged, but it is clear that by 200 AD a single bishop in charge of a metropolitan area became a universal norm without much controversy. Initially, bishops were chosen by the local clergy with approval from nearby bishops. \\"A newly elected bishop was installed in office and given his authority [...] by the bishops who supervised the election and performed the ordination.\\"J. Patout Burns, Cyprian the Bishop (Psychology Press 2002), p. 91 Examples of episcopal election in the early church include such notable figures as Ambrose of Milan. Episcopal election was so taken for granted that by the time of the Council of Nicaea (see below), it is mentioned as the normative method for selecting bishops, with approval of local metropolitans. The bishops of the most important sees sought acceptance from Rome. Some early church fathers attest to the fact that the Church of Rome - in effect its diocese - was the central point of authority. They attest to the Church's reliance on Rome for advice, for mediation of disputes, and for guidance on doctrinal issues. They note, as Ignatius of Antioch (early 2nd century) does, that Rome \\"holds the presidency\\" among the other churches, and that, as Irenaeus (ca 2nd century) explains, \\"because of its superior origin, all the churches must agree\\" with Rome. They are also clear on the fact that it is full communion with Rome and the bishop of Rome that causes one to be in communion with the Catholic Church. This displays a recognition that, as Cyprian of Carthage (3rd century) puts it, Rome is \\"the principal church, in which sacerdotal unity has its source.\\"W.A. Jurgens (editor), The Faith of the Early Fathers (Liturgical Press 1970), p. 232 Most of these references were to the entire Church of Rome as such, not necessarily to the Bishop of Rome in his person, but after the role of the pope emerged, the church and its bishop became interpreted in a synonymous way. =Era of Ecumenical Councils= By the time of the First Council of Nicaea in 325, the metropolitan bishops of Alexandria, Antioch, and Rome had a role of the greatest importance in the selection. Canon 6 of the Council acknowledged and codified an ancient custom giving jurisdiction over large regions to the bishops of Alexandria, Rome, and Antioch. Nicaea decreed that the consent of the metropolitan bishop was normally required: > Let the ancient customs in Egypt, Libya and Pentapolis prevail, that the > Bishop of Alexandria have jurisdiction in all these, since the like is > customary for the Bishop of Rome also. Likewise in Antioch and the other > provinces, let the Churches retain their privileges. And this is to be > universally understood, that if any one be made bishop without the consent > of the Metropolitan, the great Synod has declared that such a man ought not > to be a bishop. If, however, two or three bishops shall from natural love of > contradiction, oppose the common suffrage of the rest, it being reasonable > and in accordance with the ecclesiastical law, then let the choice of the > majority prevail.Canon 6 of the First Council of Nicaea =Era of Charlemagne= As part of the flourishing of culture and renewal under his reign, the Emperor Charlemagne commissioned one of the first major church-wide studies of the patristic era. This \\"golden age\\" or Carolingian Renaissance greatly influenced the identity of the Church. New texts were being discovered and disseminated at rapid pace in the late 700s and early 800s and patristic authorship became important for establishing a text's authority in Catholic theology. Unfortunately also at this time, a series of power struggles emerged between diocesan bishops and their metropolitans. As part of this struggle, a series of elaborate forgeries were produced, capitalizing on the cultural renaissance of the time and eagerness to discover new texts. The Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals asserted Roman papal power to depose and appoint bishops for the first time by deriving this power from forgeries of texts of the fathers of early church, interlaced with texts already known to be legitimate. These decretals had an enormous influence concentrating power of the pope in the Middle Ages, and were not uncovered as forgeries until the 1500s or universally acknowledged to be forgeries until the 1800s. =Medieval Church= Later, state authorities demanded their consent for the election of bishops. In medieval times, rulers demanded not only their consent to an election made by others but the right to choose the bishops directly. The Investiture Controversy changed that to some extent, but later concessions meant that many kings and other secular authorities exercised a right of appointment or at least of veto until the second half of the 20th century. =Centralization of papal power= In the early 19th century, state involvement in episcopal appointment was still so normal that, in spite of the opposition of the Church in Ireland to the proposed royal veto of the appointment of bishops, the Holy See was prepared to grant it to the British king. As late as the 20th century, Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary exercised a power of Jus exclusivae to veto the election of Mariano Rampolla as pope during the 1903 papal conclave. After Rampolla was vetoed, the conclave elected Pope Pius X. It was in 1871 that a radical shift in law and practice began to take place. In that year the Law of guarantees gave the pope the right to choose the bishops of the Kingdom of Italy, all 237 of them, appointments that through the unification of Italy had fallen into the hands of King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy. Although the pope denounced the law, he nevertheless profited by it to appoint, within the first seven months that followed, 102 new Italian bishops.Owen Chadwick, A History of the Popes, 1830-1914 (Oxford University Press 2003), p. 239John Julius Norwich, The Popes: A History (Random House 2011), p. 401John Julius Norwich, Absolute Monarchs: A History of the Papacy (Penguin Random House 2012), chapter 25 Before the unification of Italy the various rulers made the appointments, with the pope doing so only for the Papal States. The 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State had a similar effect for appointing bishops in the territories ruled by France. In the early 20th century papal appointment of Catholic bishops was an almost universal practice except where, in virtue of the Spanish patronato real and the Portuguese padroado, the appointment of Catholic bishops remained in the hands of the civil authorities. Thus the 1917 Code of Canon Law was able to finally affirm that, in the Latin Church, the decision rests with the pope. In the course of the 20th century, remaining privileges enjoyed by secular authorities gradually diminished, especially since the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), which declared that the right of nominating and appointing bishops belongs per se exclusively to the competent ecclesiastical authority and requested the civil authorities who still had rights and privileges in this field to renounce them voluntarily.Second Vatican Council, Decree Christus Dominus, 20 Pastoral bishops in the Latin Church Canon 401 §1 of the Code of Canon Law states that archdiocesan/diocesan bishops (including cardinals) are requested to submit their resignation to the pope on reaching the age of 75 years. Some do so earlier with a view to having the resignation take effect immediately on reaching 75. Bishops should also offer their resignation if ill-health or other grave problems render them unsuited for fulfilling their office.Canon 401 §2 The letter of resignation goes first to the apostolic nuncio or apostolic delegate, the pope's representative in the country or region. He forwards it to whichever department of the Holy See has particular responsibility for the selection of bishops for the country in question: the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples in the case of mission countries, the Congregation for the Oriental Churches in the case of even Latin bishops in certain Middle Eastern countries and Greece, the Secretariat of State if the country's government has been given the right to present objections of \\"a general political nature\\" (not of a party-political kind) or is involved in some other way, but generally the Congregation for Bishops. The Congregation presents the bishop's offer of resignation to the pope, who has a range of options from rejecting the offer of resignation to accepting it with immediate effect. In the case of diocesan bishops who have reached 75 years of age, the usual decision is to accept the resignation but with effect only from the date of publication of the appointment of a successor, a decision known as acceptance nunc pro tunc (now for then). If the resignation is accepted with immediate effect, the episcopal see becomes vacant on publication of the pope's decision. Vacancy of a see may occur also because of a bishop's transfer to another see or position, or because of his death. In the case of a nunc pro tunc acceptance, the see does not become vacant immediately, but the process that leads to the appointment of a successor begins without delay. One important element in selecting a bishop is the list of priests, of both the diocesan and the religious clergy, that the bishops of the ecclesiastical province or the whole Episcopal Conference judge to be suitable generically (without reference to any particular see) for appointment as bishops. They are required to draw up this list at least once every three years, so that it is always recent.Canon 377 §2 When it comes to a concrete appointment for a particular see, the papal representative (apostolic nuncio or delegate) asks either the outgoing bishop, or in case of a sede vacante, the vicar general or diocesan administrator, to draw up a report on its situation and the needs. That person will be the bishop who has presented his resignation or, if the see is vacant, the diocesan administrator or apostolic administrator. The papal representative is also obliged to consult the metropolitan archbishop and the other bishops of the province, the president of the bishops conference, and at least some members of the college of consultors and the cathedral chapter. He may also consult others, whether clergy, diocesan or religious, and \\"lay persons of outstanding wisdom\\".Canon 377 §3Circular Letter No. 1550/72 of 25 March 1972 from the Council of the Public Affairs of the Church (AAS 64, 1972, pp. 386 ff.) Canon law insists on enabling those consulted to provide information and express their views confidentially, requiring that they be consulted \\"individually and in secret\\".Canon 377 §3, towards end Accordingly, when the Irish Times of 12 April 2007 published the text of the letter with which Archbishop Giuseppe Lazzarotto, Nuncio to Ireland, consulted certain priests on the choice of their next bishop, he said, \\"All aspects relating to the process of episcopal appointments should be dealt with in the strictest confidentiality. I trust that you will understand that I cannot depart from this practice.\\" The nuncio then decides on a short list, or terna, of three candidates for further investigation and seeks precise information on each of them. Since if it were widely known that a priest who was not the one who was finally chosen for the post had been under consideration, people might think he had been excluded because of some fault found in him (a groundless conclusion, since all those examined may be eminently worthy and suitable, but only one can be selected), the nuncio will ask those consulted about individual candidates to observe the strictest confidentiality on the fact of the consultation. He will then send to the Holy See a list (known as a \\"terna\\") of the (usually) three candidates that seem to be the most appropriate for consideration, together with all the information that has been gathered on them and accompanying the information with the conclusions that he himself draws from the evidence.Canon 377 §3, final words; cf. canon 364, 4° The qualities that a candidate must have are listed in canon 378 §1. As well as being at least 35 years old and a priest for at least 5 years, he should be \\"outstanding in strong faith, good morals, piety, zeal for souls, wisdom, prudence and human virtues\\", and should possess the other qualities needed for fulfilling the office in question; and he should be well versed in sacred Scripture, theology and canon law and, preferably, hold a doctorate in one of these fields. The congregation of the Roman Curia responsible for the appointment (one of the four indicated above) studies the documentation provided by the nuncio, taking into consideration his opinion, but not necessarily accepting it. It might even reject all the candidates he has proposed and ask him to prepare another list, or it might ask him to provide more information on one or more of the priests who have already been presented. When the Congregation decides on which priest should be appointed, it presents its conclusions to the pope, asking him to make the appointment. If he agrees, the papal act is communicated to the nuncio for him to obtain the consent of the priest to his appointment and to choose a date for its publication. The newly appointed bishop is obliged to get episcopal consecration within three months of the arrival the papal bull of his appointment, which is usually prepared only at least a month after the publication. If the consecration takes place within the diocese, he takes charge immediately. If it occurs elsewhere, a separate act is required, after the consecration, for taking possession of his new post.Canon 379 Bringing the process to a conclusion obviously requires much time, usually taking at least nine months, and it may on occasions take up to two years. The procedure described above is the normal one for the appointment of a diocesan bishop. In the case of an auxiliary bishop, the diocesan bishop chooses the three priests to be presented for the appointment, but the nuncio still has the duty of gathering information and opinions on the candidates, and the Congregation can either select one of them or ask for a different list of candidates to be presented.Canon 377 §4 In some countries, the diocesan chapter or some other body decides on the three names to send, through the nuncio, to the Holy See. With the names, the nuncio sends the information he has gathered on the candidates. If none of the three candidates is acceptable to the Holy See, the chapter is asked for another list. However, the Holy See can reject the list in its entirety and appoint someone not proposed by the chapter.Time Magazine In other cases the cathedral chapter chooses the bishop from among a list of three presented to them by the Holy See.Jonathan Steinberg, Why Switzerland (Cambridge University Press 1996 ), p. 225 The chapter participates in the election of bishops of 13 of the 27 German dioceses (Aachen, Cologne, Essen, Freiburg, Fulda, Hildesheim, Limburg, Mainz, Münster, Osnabrúck, Paderborn, Rottenburg-Stuttgart, Trier), 3 Swiss dioceses (Basel, Chur, Sankt Gallen), and 1 Austrian (Salzburg).Monica-Elena Herghelegiu, Reservatio Papalis (LIT Verlag, Münster 2008 ), p. 49 For the Personal Ordinarates established under the apostolic constitution Anglicanorum Coetibus,Anglicanorum Coetibus out of respect for the synodal tradition of Anglicanism, the Ordinary will be appointed by the Roman Pontiff from a terna of names presented by the Governing Council (CN Art. 4 § 1)Complementary Norms In the past, privileges regarding the appointment of bishops were granted to kings and other civil authorities. In accordance with the decision of the Second Vatican Council,Christus Dominus, 20 the Code of Canon Law lays down that \\"for the future, no rights or privileges of election, appointment, presentation or designation of Bishops are conceded to civil authorities.\\"Canon 377 §5 In about a dozen countries, the civil government still has the right of consultation or even of presentation.Herghelegiu 2008, p. 50 Eastern Catholic Churches There are 23 Eastern Catholic Churches totalling about 20 million people that are in communion with the Holy See but their liturgy and other practices are different. A patriarchal Eastern Catholic church itself elects its bishops who are to serve within its own territory, but other bishops are appointed by the Pope.Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 181 Before the election of a bishop, the patriarchal synod considers the names proposed by its members and draws up a list of those it considers to be valid candidates for episcopacy; this is communicated to the Pope and any name for which he refuses his assent is removed from the list.Canon 182 When the synod then comes to elect a bishop, no further procedure is required if the person chosen is on the list; but if he is not on the list, the assent of the Pope is needed before asking the newly elected to accept his election.Canons 184–185 The same arrangement holds for a Church headed by a Major Archbishop.Canon 152 In the official bulletins and news media of the Holy See, these appointments are published as decisions of the Eastern Church in question, not of the Pope. The procedure for appointing bishops of other Eastern Churches and those bishops of patriarchal and major archiepiscopal Churches who are to serve outside the territory of the Church in question is similar to that for Latin bishops, and the appointments are published as acts of the Pope.

It has a total length of approximately 25 cm. It is mostly green with off white scalloping on the hindneck and breast and red primary coverts. It lives in humid forests, ranging from the Amazonian lowlands up to an altitude of 1000 m on the east Andean slopes. It is designated as Near Threatened because of deforestation in the Amazon Basin. Flock size is up to 30 birds with smaller groups forming during breeding season. In aviculture, these birds are known as black capped conures. As the quietest of the conure birds they are popular as household pets. They can reproduce in captivity and can also mate with the green cheeked parakeet to produce hybrid offspring. They have large personalities and are highly social, making great companion animals. 211x211px Taxonomy Swiss naturalist Johann Jakob von Tschudi described the species in 1844. There are two subspecies of Pyrrhura rupicola: *P. r. rupicola *P. r. sandiae P. r. rupicola can be found in western South America and is common in Peru. P. r. sandiae can be found in the extreme west of Brazil, south-east Peru, and northern Bolivia. Commonly called the Sandia conure in aviculture, it features narrower scalloped feathers on the neck and breast and a lack of scalloped feathers on the hindneck. The black capped parakeet may breed with the green cheeked parakeet in the wild. \\"Black-capped parakeet\\" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC). It is also known in the pet trade as black-capped conure or rock conure.  Behavior  Black capped parakeets are highly social birds and communal roosters. In the wild, they flock with up to 30 birds at a time. During breeding season smaller groups of families can be found. Black capped parakeets enjoy bathing. In the wild black capped parakeets are canopy feeders. The black capped parakeet lives up to 30 years in captivity.Black capped parakeet leaning in to receive scritches from owner = Breeding = Black capped parakeets reach sexual maturity between 1 and 3 years old. They roost in small groups during breeding season. A clutch generally has 4 to 7 eggs. They have a 24-day incubation period, followed by 7 to 8 weeks of parental care. Black capped parakeets have a breeding season from February to March. = Diet = Wild black capped parakeets eat a variety of fruits, nuts, berries, and vegetation. They may also raid farmers crops.Black capped parakeet grooming breast feathers = Conservation = Black capped parakeets are listed as near-threatened in the wild on Appendix II. The primary cause of their habitat loss is the deforestation of the Amazon Basin. It is estimated that between there will be a 13.7% and 15.5% loss of habitable land over 18 years. A decrease in forest buffers alongside streams, amnesty for land owners guilty of illegal deforestation before 2008, and a reduction in the amount of private land that must be kept as forest contribute to this problem.  Aviculture  Known as the black capped conure in aviculture, it is known as the quietest of the conures. If they are bored or left alone for too long they can be loud. They are most active at dawn and dusk. They are sociable birds who require a lot of attention. They may be shy around new people, but its highly inquisitive nature often negates any shyness. To clean themselves and keep their feathers orderly black capped conures preen themselves. They may yawn after this to clear out their nasal passages. Conures enjoy having their head scratched gently by their owners. They may indicate this by bowing their heads or rubbing against a hand. = Behavior = As highly inquisitive birds, black capped conures require many versatile toys to keep them occupied. Many toys should be obtained and they should be rotated out every few days. Interactive toys such as bird puzzles can entertain a conure and prevent boredom. Black capped conures have an affinity for water and enjoy bathing. Their water bowl should be changed twice a day for this reason. After bathing, black capped conures shiver to build and maintain body heat.Black capped parakeet yawning while standing on natural wood perch Diet A black- capped conure should be fed a healthy mix of fruits, vegetables, and pellets. The pellets should account for about 75% of the bird's diet. 25% of their diet should be fresh fruit and vegetables. Seeds, nuts, and other treats high in fat should be used as a reward and to supplement the diet. Black-capped conures should be given a wide variety of colorful fruits and vegetables. Light green or white vegetables have little nutritional value. Conures can eat human food, although they cannot eat avocados, chocolate, alcohol, or caffeine. They can eat small amounts of meat and eggs, although they should avoid foods high in fat and salt.  Biting  Wild conures do not bite regularly. Birds have a non-verbal language that humans often do not understand, resulting in a bite. Conures may also bite to elicit a strong response from the owners. If the response to biting is to place the conure in their cage, they may begin to bite when they want to return to their cage, or they may begin to dislike their cage and associate it with punishment. The best solutions to unwarranted biting are standing your ground with a firm \\"no\\" or ignoring the bird and leaving the room.  Feather Plucking  Feather plucking may occur if a black capped conure is bored. This is a harmful habit that should be stopped quickly. To stop plucking change or add interactive toys to the cage and increase the amount of time the bird is out.243x243px = Breeding = Although black capped conures are not the most prolific breeders, they can be bred in captivity. They start breeding around 18 months old, although the exact number varies for each bird. The females should be introduced to their nesting cage first, and given time to acclimate to the change before introducing the males. Pairings should take place at the end of December. There are rarely problems with mate acceptance. Eggs are laid in February, and hatching occurs 23 days later in March. Nest boxes should be left alone unless the parents are not taking care of their young. This can be determined by listening to the babies cries, interrupted cries that eventually stop indicate the babies are being fed. The babies are ready to leave the parents at around 8 or 9 weeks.

About Caldicott  Caldicott Preparatory School was founded in Hitchin, Hertfordshire in 1904 by James Heald Jenkins who named his school after his new bride, a Miss Theodora Caldicott Ingram. There were just eight boys. In 1938 the school moved to its present site in Farnham Royal in Buckinghamshire, and became a charitable trust in 1968 under the Headmaster at the time Peter Wright. Today there are around 280 boys. The school's governors include past parents, old boys and headmasters of public schools. According to the school's website, many pupils at Caldicott subsequently win places at major independent schools, such as Eton College, Harrow School, Lancing College, Winchester College, Stowe School, Tonbridge School, Marlborough College, Wellington College, Haileybury College and Radley College. The original Victorian house remains. New buildings have been created around it to provide more contemporary facilities. In 2004 the Centenary Hall was completed to provide a theatre for drama and music and a venue for functions. Although central London is only away the school has of grounds and playing fields. Burnham Beeches, a National Nature Reserve owned by the City of London Corporation is adjacent to the grounds and is often used by pupils. Heathrow Airport is away.  Child sex abuse  On 30 September 2008 the school was the subject of a feature documentary, Chosen, transmitted on More4 as part of the \\"Real Stories\\" strand, about the sexual abuse that went on at the school during the late 1960s and early 1970s. The headmaster Peter Wright was active in this, as well as a number of other teachers, targeting boys good at sports and, to a lesser extent, in the choir. In The Guardian published on the same day, a former parent alleged that Lord Justice Scott Baker former chairman of the board of Governors, and Headmaster Simon Doggart mishandled a case of alleged sexual abuse of their son by a teacher in the early 2000s. Martin Carson was dismissed for sexual abuse of a pupil in 1972, and went on to teach at the Harrodian School. He was subsequently prosecuted and found guilty of indecent assault and possessing indecent images of children in 2003. On 4 December 2011, Peter Wright and Hugh Henry, another teacher, were charged with child sex offences alleged to have taken place between 1959 and 1970. For Henry, the charges cover his period at Gayhurst School as well as at Caldicott. They appeared in court in Aylesbury on 21 December 2011 charged with a total of 35 offences against 12 pupils. This was the second time that Peter Wright had been charged for child abuse offences; the first time, in 2003, the judge awarded a stay of proceedings predicated upon the passage of time since the offences were allegedly committed. Hugh Henry was found guilty of 11 counts of indecency, and two of gross indecency, towards a child, and pleaded guilty. He was killed by a train shortly before he was due to return to court for sentencing, his death a presumed suicide.https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/05/former-teacher-dies- train-sentencing-sex-crimes On 18 December 2013 Peter Wright was convicted of sexually assaulting five pupils aged eight to 13 at Caldicott between 1959 and 1970. Wright was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment on 6 February 2014. Thames Valley Police on 1 May 2012 charged another former teacher, John Addrison, with sexual offences committed against children at the school between 1979 and 1981. Addrison was subsequently further charged with child sex offences committed at Moor Park School near Ludlow, Shropshire, between 1985 and 1988. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 5 years' prison but wasn't fined. A further ex teacher, David Geddes, was also charged in November 2012, with four charges for offences against 3 school children between 1975 and 1977. In the first trial there was a hung jury, and in the subsequent second trial he was acquitted. More recently, under headmaster Simon Doggart, another incident of alleged child sexual abuse was reported in the late 2000s. The headmaster and the chairman of the board of governors, Lord Justice Scott Baker, suspended the teacher (who did not return) but failed to report the incident to the police or social services, contrary to the school's written policy on this matter.

Other names for this dogwood have included red willow, silky cornel, kinnikinnick, and squawbush. Description Flowers Cornus amomum is a deciduous shrub growing to 5 m tall. The leaves are opposite, up to long and broad, oval with an acute apex. The flowers are produced in cymes. The fruit is a small blue drupe. Cornus amomum usually blooms between May and June, producing four-petalled showy yellowish white flowers. Cornus amomum leaves are rusty brown and pubescent, occurring opposite from one another and usually having between 4 and 5 veins per leaf side. If Cornus amomum is left unattended it will grow to create thickets and thick vegetative areas. Taxonomy Silky dogwood is usually included in the dogwood genus Cornus as Cornus amomum Mill., although it is sometimes segregated in a separate genus as Swida amomum (Mill.) Small. The more northerly-occurring Cornus obliqua was formerly included in this species as Cornus amomum subsp. obliqua (Raf.) J.S. Wilson, but is now generally recognized as a distinct species. =Etymology= Cornus in Latin means horn, this is describing the dogwoods hard wood. Amomum in Latin means eastern spice. Distribution and habitat Cornus amomum is a native eastern North American shrub, finding suitable habitat in wetland areas like swamps, marshes and bogs. The distribution of the shrub also extends west past the Mississippi river to the eastern borders of Kansas, Nebraska, and parts of northern Oklahoma. Cornus amomum is only found within the U.S. while other species such as the Cornus obliqua can be found in Canada.Cornus amomum prefers partial shade but can tolerate full sun. When planted, the use of organic materials to maintain a wet environment will help the shrub when insufficient water is present. Cornus amomum is grows near or around creeks or water systems. Cornus amomum can be found in the following states: West Virginia, Virginia, Vermont, South Carolina, Maine, Kentucky, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Georgia, Florida, District of Columbia, Delaware, Connecticut, Alabama, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Cornus amomum has been found at elevations from 0 feet to 1500 feet of elevation. Conservation Based on the IUCN Red List classification, The conservation status of Cornus amomum is a Least Concern plant. While Cornus amomum is recognized as Least Concern across the eastern parts of North America, Indiana has Cornus amomum ranked as an endangered plant throughout the state. Ecology berries Cornus amomum is primarily used by song birds, insects and rodents for its fruits which are produced in summer. Other animals such as White-tailed deer, Elk, and other land dwelling mammals feast on the fruit as well. Cornus amomum uses the animals as a method of seed dispersal. As Cornus amomum fruit decay fruitivores tend to pick only the ripe fruit and seeds, which destroy good seeds that would otherwise be dropped and grow. Uses The dogwood family is desired for ornamental uses in landscapes across the United States. Dogwoods are valued by gardeners for their spring flowers, summer foliage, fruit and leaf color. Each species of dogwood has their own unique look, Cornus amomum is a shrub which can be used in places of excess runoff or areas of water collection in a landscape as it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The shrub provides beautiful colors throughout the spring, summer and fall. Cornus amomum has also been used in the outdoors to help with erosion control along slopes and steep inclines, it can be planted by farmers and landowners to provide a windbreaks for homes and agriculture fields, its uses can include building natural borders between land and for wildlife conservation, and it can be used to provide habitat for many types of wildlife. Finally, Cornus amomum can minimize stream bank erosion and add stabilization along bank when coupled together with other well rooted trees and shrubs like willows. Some problems can arise from the use of Cornus amomum as a natural border, mostly as a border for wildlife and livestock. While the shrubs create a useful barrier, grazing wildlife and livestock tend to damage much of the shrub when the fruit are ripe. Other than that, there are no impending diseases or pest which would pose any sort of problem for the shrub.

It is a full member of the Construction Industry Council, and is consulted by government on matters relating to construction, engineering and sustainability. It is also licensed by the Engineering Council to assess candidates for inclusion on its Register of Professional Engineers. History The Chartered Institution of Building Services (CIBS) was formed by the 1976 merger of the Institution of Heating and Ventilating Engineers (founded in 1897) and the Illuminating Engineering Society (founded in 1909), receiving a Royal Charter in the same year. The word 'Engineers' was added in 1985, and hence the Institution became CIBSE. Overview The Institution's objective, as defined in the Royal Charter, is to \\"support the Science, Art and Practice of building services engineering, by providing our members and the public with first class information and education services and promoting the spirit of fellowship which guides our work\\". The Institution is primarily focused on: *Promoting competence through education, training and registration. *Delivering up-to-date knowledge of the art, science and engineering of the built environment through its membership networks, publications and research. With a dual focus on both the engineering and the construction sectors of the economy, CIBSE provides a coordinating role for the application of multi-discipline science and engineering principles in the built environment and promotes the delivery of integrated projects by working with others in construction.  Membership  As of June 2019, CIBSE claimed a membership of over 21,000, from 94 countries. The Institution is organised on a regional basis; with 16 regions in the United Kingdom and four regions overseas: *Australia and New Zealand *Hong Kong *Republic of Ireland *United Arab Emirates There are also CIBSE International Chapters in: *Canada *China (Shanghai and Chongqing) *Qatar *Singapore *Sri Lanka CIBSE has eight grades of membership, with the upper four granting designatory postnominals. These are: *Fellow (FCIBSE) *Member (MCIBSE) *Associate (ACIBSE) *Licentiate (LCIBSE) Below this there are four grades of membership with no designatory postnominals: *Graduate *Student - full and part-time *Affiliate Members assessed by CIBSE for professional registration may be granted the following designatory postnominals by the Engineering Council: * Chartered Engineer (CEng) * Incorporated Engineer (IEng) * Engineering Technician (EngTech) Societies Four societies and one institute exist within CIBSE to reflect special areas of expertise that exist within the field of building services: *Society of Facade Engineering (SFE) was set up in 2003 as a Society of CIBSE but with the support of the IStructE and RIBA. Its aim is to advance knowledge of and practice in facade engineering. *Society of Light and Lighting (SLL) acts as the professional body for lighting in the UK. It represents the interests of those involved in the art, science and engineering of light and lighting in their widest definition and has over 2,000 members in the UK and worldwide. *Society of Public Health Engineers (SoPHE) is to provide a higher profile and focus for public health engineers within CIBSE. *Institute of Local Exhaust Ventilation Engineers (ILEVE) was established in 2011 to promote air quality in the workplace and to reduce ill health and death due to airborne contamination and hazardous substances in the working environment. *Society of Digital Engineering (SDE) was formed to provide a home for those involved in digitising the built environment, either as designers, contractors, manufacturers, clients, facility managers or software vendors Special interest groups CIBSE lists a number of special interest groups that operate within the Institution The CIBSE groups are free to join either as a member or non-member. : * ASHRAE * Building Simulation * Chimneys and Flues * CHP & District Heating * Daylight * Electrical Services * Energy Performance * Young Energy Performance Group * Facilities Management * Healthcare * Heritage * Homes for the Future * HVAC Systems * Information Technology (IT) & Controls * Intelligent Buildings * Lifts * Natural Ventilation * Resilient Cities * School Design * Young Engineers Network (YEN) * Women in Building Services Engineering (WiBSE) Certification In recent years there has been an increasing focus on sustainability and green design by the UK government. The implementation of Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Power) of the U.K. Building Regulations in 2006 led CIBSE to set up the Low Carbon Consultants Register to ensure that a body of competent and trained professionals was available to implement the various requirements of the regulations, specifically in undertaking the relevant calculations to demonstrate the required reduction in carbon emissions from buildings both in design and operation. Members of the Register must undertake specific training and examinations to demonstrate their competence in various aspects of the regulations. The CIBSE scheme further offers accreditation as a Low Carbon Energy Assessor (LCEA), again subject to specific training and examinations, who are then able to provide the Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) and Display Energy Certificates (DECs), as required under the Energy Performance in Buildings Regulations (EPB Regulations). These certificates can only be provided by accredited energy assessors who are members of an approved scheme such as the Low Carbon Energy Assessors Register. Furthermore, assessors are required to update their training regularly to ensure that continued high standards of competency are met. The LCC scheme has been expanded in recent years to include for the grade of Low Carbon Consultant: Energy Management Systems, these LCC's having been trained and tested by CIBSE to ensure they have the relevant competencies to assist organisations to implement BS EN 16001. CIBSE also offers certification for Air Conditioning Inspectors, to perform inspections as required by the Energy Performance of Buildings (Certificates and Inspections) (England and Wales) Regulations 2007. Training Many training options are available through CIBSE, with the aim of providing specialised courses, conferences and seminars for those within the building services industry. and the provision of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) training, to improve and enhance the skills required to be engineering professional. Included are a range of courses from fire safety and mechanical and electrical services courses, to facilities management and business skills-focused training. Online modules can also be completed which can be used to contribute towards the Edexcel Advanced Professional Diploma in Building Services Engineering. Publications CIBSE publishes several guides to building services design, which include for various recommended design criteria and standards, some of which are cited within the UK building regulations and therefore form a legislative requirement for major building services works. The main guides are: * Guide A: Environmental design * Guide B: Heating, ventilating, air conditioning and refrigeration * Guide C: Reference data * Guide D: Transportation systems in buildings * Guide E: Fire safety engineering * Guide F: Energy efficiency in buildings * Guide G: Public health and plumbing engineering * Guide H: Building control systems * Guide J: Weather, solar and illuminance data (now withdrawn) * Guide K: Electricity in buildings * Guide L: Sustainability * Guide M: Maintenance engineering and management In November 2011 CIBSE made its full range of published guidance (including all the CIBSE Guides, CIBSE Commissioning Codes, Applications Manuals, Technical Memoranda, Lighting Guides) available for free to its members through the Knowledge Portal. CIBSE publishes a monthly magazine, the CIBSE Journal (formerly the Building Services Journal). Two quarterly technical journals are published in association with Sage: Building Services Engineering Research & Technology (BSERT) is free online to all CIBSE members and Lighting Research & Technology Journal (LR&T;) which is free for Society of Light and Lighting members only.

George Lee was one of \\"The Good Guys\\", and his trademark sign-off was \\"Drive safely. The life you save may be your own. Myself, I'd rather be late than be the late George Lee.\\"Mark Burger, \\"Man Behind the Voice, George Lee, Dies at 67; He Was Active in Radio and Acting,\\" Winston- Salem Journal, September 30, 2006. Other popular DJs were Dick Bennick, The Flying Dutchman, and Rick Dees, who worked at WTOB, WCOG and WKIX when the stations were owned by Southern Broadcasting. Shortly after his retirement in 2015 from WEGO, a Winston-Salem Journal story said that when Smith Patterson went to work at WTOB, his name was the same as John Johnson and he was told not to use that name. Several days later, he got behind a Patterson Smith oil truck and decided on the name he would use through his 45-year career. =1980s and '90s: changes in formats= In the 1980s, the station played adult standards in addition to airing local and regional sports events, talk programs such as Marge at Large, and other local content such as a barbershop music program. At the end of the 1980s, most of the station's music came from Satellite Radio Networks. The station later switched to CNN radio news. Truth Broadcasting eventually purchased the station and switched it to Christian talk,Alexandrea Ravenelle, \\"New Owners Resurrect WCOG Radio,\\" Greensboro News & Record, June 3, 1999. later airing the same programming as WCOG.\\"'Missionary' Finds His Field on Triad AM Radio,\\" Greensboro News & Record, July 8, 1999. =The 2000s: simulcasts and Spanish= On January 1, 2002, WWBG began airing the same programming as WTOB.Jamie Kritzer, \\"Radio Station WWBG Changing Format,\\" Greensboro News & Record, December 27, 2001. In 2003, Truth Broadcasting stopped selling time to La Movidita, which moved back to WSGH. Que Pasa moved from WSGH to WTOB and WWBG.\\"Hispanic Radio Stations Switch Places on Dial,\\" Greensboro News & Record, March 20, 2003. This was done even though the Spring 2002 Arbitron results showed WTOB had its highest ratings since the change to Spanish programming.Jamie Kritzer, \\"WKRR, WTOB Earn Gains in Ratings War,\\" Greensboro News & Record, August 10, 2002. At some point not too long after this, Davidson Media purchased WTOB. =2010s: back to English and back to Spanish= On April 1, 2013, WTOB switched back to all- English, dropped all Spanish programming and flipped its format to Oldies (1950s-1970s and Carolina Beach Oldies). Jerry Holt leased the station from owner Davidson Media and was the general manager of WTOB as well as an on-air D.J. The station announced that it was moving its studios to 3rd Avenue in Winston-Salem. WTOB was based on the style and music that made it the top radio station in Winston-Salem in the 1960s and 1970s, and past jingles and sound effects were used. Among the disc jockeys were Curtis Lee, who was on WAIR in the 1960s. Holt and Davidson Media could not agree on a new lease in 2014. WTOB was leased to Dan Williard, and Holt leased another station, WSMX. WTOB switched to a classic hits format on June 1. Speaking about the new format, program director Coyote Nash told the Winston-Salem Journal, \\"We’re the only station that does the Classic Hits format between Charlotte and Raleigh... Corporate radio has just ignored it.\\" . In July 2015, TBLC Media purchased WTOB. In November 2015, TBLC changed the format to Spanish. The classic hits format remained on the station's website and moved first to WSMX and on December 18, 2015 at noon, to WEGO. Former WTOB employees formed Southern Broadcast Media LLC to license the new station. On December 9, 2015, WTOB changed its callsign to WWNT. On November 15, 2016, TBLC Media consented to give the WTOB callsign to the owners of WEGO 980 AM, and as of November 22, 2016, WEGO became WTOB. =WTOB-TV= A sister television station, WTOB-TV, signed on the air on September 18, 1953. It was an ABC and DuMont affiliate. WTOB-TV operated on Channel 26.1954 Telecasting Yearbook, page 220. As with many early UHF stations, it faced signal problems and the fact that viewers had to purchase expensive UHF converters to see the signal. With the area already served by strong VHF stations like Greensboro’s WFMY-TV and Winston- Salem’s WSJS-TV, WTOB-TV was fighting a difficult battle. It signed off in 1957. Channel 26 now is WUNL-TV, the University of North Carolina television station serving Winston-Salem. It is not affiliated with WTOB.

Siege of Nantes Duke Conan had the Breton city of Nantes under siege, when he learned that Fulk was marching with an army to relieve the city. Conan raised the siege and began marching his troops back in the direction of Rennes to face Fulk. Once Conan realized that his army could not outrun Fulk, Conan halted at Conquereuil and prepared the battlefield, digging pits and ditches which were flooded by the water of nearby swamps and then hidden by covering them lightly with sod, and behind this prepared earthworks which had their flanks secured by the swamps. Uncertain Outcomes The Angevins attacked, and Breton troops lured the Angevin knights into the flooded pits by feigning flight. The Bretons then counterattacked and drove the Angevins back in disarray. The Bretons apparently considered the battle won, but this was premature. Fulk reorganized his army, attacked the Bretons again, and routed them, killing Conan in the process. Another version of the story suggests that the Breton counterattack was successful and drove the Angevins back in disarray. In the midst of a Breton pursuit, Conan removed his armour because it was hot, and some Angevin knights in a wood saw him, charged the unarmoured duke, and killed him, turning the battle decisively in the favor of the Angevins.

There are two types of incorporated municipalities in Maine, towns and cities. The tables in the New England Historical U.S. Census Totals series differentiate between towns and cities; however, there have never been any cities in Lincoln County. Most areas of New England are entirely divided into incorporated municipalities, with no unincorporated territory. In the three northern New England states, however, some unincorporated territory does exist, generally in areas that are very sparsely populated. Maine contains significantly more unincorporated territory than the other states, with the bulk of it in interior and northern counties. Some southern and coastal counties, including Lincoln County, also contain smaller amounts of unincorporated territory, however. Some unincorporated territory in Maine is organized into a third type of town-level municipality unique to Maine, called a plantation (considered to be “organized”, but not incorporated), while some is entirely unorganized. Lincoln County currently contains one plantation (Monhegan, which is located on offshore islands), as well as a small amount of territory that is entirely unorganized (Hibberts Gore). Separate sections with census totals for unincorporated areas follows the main tables below. For any census, adding up the totals for each town- level municipality, including any plantations or unorganized entities, should yield the county total. Except for Monhegan and Hibberts Gore, all of Lincoln County is incorporated; except for Hibberts Gore, all of the county is at least organized.

Plantations As of 1900, there was one plantation in Lincoln County, Monhegan, which is located on offshore islands (all of mainland Lincoln County is incorporated, except for Hibberts Gore). While Monhegan is currently the only plantation in the county, a second plantation existed from 1937 to 1974, a period when Somerville also operated under a plantation form a government. Before 1937 and after 1974, Somerville has been an incorporated town. 1900 *Monhegan 94 1910 *Monhegan 120 1920 *Monhegan 133 1930 *Monhegan 109 1940 *Somerville 266 *Monhegan 115 1950 *Somerville 227 *Monhegan 75 1960 *Somerville 254 *Monhegan 65 1970 *Somerville 215 *Monhegan 44 1980 *Monhegan 109 1990 *Monhegan 88 2000 *Monhegan 75 Unorganized Territory The unorganized territory in Lincoln County consists of a small tract in the northeastern corner of the county, covering less than one square mile, called Hibberts Gore. It is surrounded by the towns of Somerville, Palermo, Liberty and Washington (Somerville is the only one of these towns that is in Lincoln County; the others are all across the border in neighboring counties). Hibberts Gore has never recorded a population of more than a few residents in any census. 1900 through 1930 Unorganized territory reported no population. Hibberts Gore appears to have been the only unorganized territory in the county. 1940 Unorganized territory reported 74 residents. The only available breakdown is that 1 resident was in Hibberts Gore. See the Notes section below for more information. 1950 Unorganized territory reported 77 residents. The only available breakdown is that 1 resident was in Hibberts Gore. See the Notes section below for more information. 1960 Unorganized territory reported 34 residents. The only available breakdown is that none were in Hibberts Gore. See the Notes section below for more information. 1970 Unorganized territory reported no population. Hibberts Gore was the only unorganized territory in the county. 1980 Unorganized territory reported 2 residents, in Hibberts Gore, which was the only unorganized territory in the county. 1990 Unorganized territory reported 1 resident, in Hibberts Gore, which was the only unorganized territory in the county. 2000 Unorganized territory reported 1 resident, in Hibberts Gore, which was the only unorganized territory in the county. Notes Unorganized territory in 1900 through 1960 Censuses The 1880, 1890, 1920 and 1930 Census reports do not indicate any unorganized territory in Lincoln County, although Hibberts Gore presumably existed during that period. (The author of this article did not have access to the 1900 or 1910 reports, but prior census data in the 1920 and 1930 reports, both of which cover the two preceding censuses, does not list Hibberts Gore either.) In the 1940 Census, two listings appeared which seem to represent unorganized territory. One is for Hibberts Gore (pop. 1), the other for “Islands not belonging to any town” (pop. 73). There is a note indicating that Hibberts Gore was “not returned separately” for the two preceding censuses (1920 and 1930) for which prior census data appears in the reports. It is unclear if this means that Hibberts Gore had not previously been reported because it had no population, or if it did previously have population, but this population was included with that of a neighboring municipality. There is no indication of exactly what is included in “Islands not belonging to any town”, why it had not been listed in previous censuses, or where the population of these islands (if any) had been included in the past. The 1950 Census provided the same two listings. Hibberts Gore again reported a population of 1, and “Islands not belonging to any town” reported a population of 76. The 1960 Census provided listings for Hibberts Gore (pop. 0) and “Unorganized Territory” (pop. 34). The latter seems to represent the same area previously shown as “Islands not belonging to any town”, since prior census data for 1940 and 1950 match the population figures for “Islands not belonging to any town” as reported in those censuses. In the 1960 Census, the Census Bureau generally provided a single catch-all “Unorganized Territory” listing for each Maine County, with no further breakdown. This would explain why “Islands not belonging to any town” changed to “Unorganized Territory”, but it is odd that Hibberts Gore retained its own listing. The 1970 Census provides a listing for Hibberts Gore. “Islands not belonging to any town” or “Unorganized Territory” is not listed, and there is no explanation of what happened to it. The prior census data for 1960 (the only prior census that was included in the 1970 reports), however, appears to include its 1960 population with Bremen; Bremen’s 1960 population is shown as 472. Presumably the islands in question had been annexed by Bremen, or a decision had been made to treat them as part of Bremen for Census purposes, but this is not specified. All censuses since 1970 have continued to list Hibberts Gore as the only unorganized territory in Lincoln County. 1970 Census The 1970 Census reported Westport as Westport Island. It was changed back to Westport for the 1980, 1990 and 2000 censuses. Sources are conflicting on whether the town’s name was officially changed. The town appears to have long been at least informally known as “Westport Island”.

Early years Raimey was born in 1940 in Dayton, Ohio, and attended Roosevelt High School University of Michigan Raimey enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1959 and played for the Michigan Wolverines football team from 1960 to 1962. As a sophomore in 1960, Raimey started three games at the halfback position, gained 342 net rushing yards in 62 attempts, and led the team in scoring with six touchdowns. As a junior in 1961, he started all nine games at right halfback, and was the team's leading rusher with 496 net rushing yards on 99 attempts; he was also the team's leading scorer for the second consecutive year with six touchdowns. As a senior in 1962, Raimey was the Wolverines' leading rusher for the second consecutive year, gaining 385 net rushing yards and scoring five touchdowns on 124 carries. He was also selected as the team's most valuable player for the 1962 season. Professional football Raimey was selected in the ninth round of the 1963 NFL Draft by the Cleveland Browns, but he opted to play in the Canadian Football League in 1963. However, he suffered a shoulder injury, underwent surgery, and missed the entire 1963 season. In 1964, he tried out with the Browns and made the team. He appeared in five games for the Browns during the 1964 NFL season, playing principally at the defensive back position. Raimey played at the running back for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers from 1965 to 1968. He rushed for 1,052 yards in 1965 and 1,223 yards in 1966. He was a member of the Blue Bombers team that played in the 53rd Grey Cup game in 1965, the \\"Wind Bowl\\", which they lost to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. He was selected as a Western Conference all-star each year from 1965 to 1968 and as a CFL all-star in 1966. Raimey was traded during the 1969 CFL season to the Toronto Argonauts, where he played six years up to the end of the 1974 CFL season. In 1969, he was an Eastern Conference and CFL all-star with 829 yards rushing. From 1971 to 1974, Raimey was converted to defensive back, intercepting 15 passes. Over his 10-year career, six at running back, Raimey rushed for 5,528 yards and 25 touchdowns on 883 carries for a 6.3 yard per rush average. In addition to defensive back, he also returned punts and kickoffs. Raimey was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2000.

Sabikis consist of any number (usually between 6 and 10) of small hooks, each one on individual dropper lines which are a few inches long. The individual dropper lines are then tied to a longer leader in series, about apart; a weight is tied to the end of the leader. The individual hooks are decorated as lures or tied like flies similar to those used in fly fishing. Often they have a simple piece of lumo-infused material or iridescent film attached to them. Traditionally, on any individual rig, all of the lures will be either identical or in an alternating sequence of colors. The type or size sabiki used depends on water conditions, species of fish sought or simply the angler's preference. This rig is usually used when catching baitfish, though an angler can also attach a bait cage to the rig and catch fish like large Snapper, Mulloway, Flathead etc. With a bait cage on the rig, users should give a large jerk to release the bait. In Japan, they are used to catch sardines and mackerel off large piers. Sabiki rigs with their many small, sharp hooks are easily tangled and always snag on pier faces with protrusions such as oyster shells and can be a nuisance to the angler. If they are not handled carefully, the angler can be hooked. This can be avoided by using a sabiki rod. A sabiki rod is a hollow fishing rod with a funnel-shaped tip. The line is fed from the reel through the hollow body of the rod and out of the funnel-shaped tip. When the sabiki rig is reeled in, the hooks and leaders are drawn directly into the rod where they will not tangle or injure the angler.

Proprietor John Comstock (1802–1879) platted the town June 24, 1837. The name Liberty Mills comes from the number of mills the town once operated, including a saw mill, a carding mill, and a distillery, with one of the mills coming from the ‘Liberty’ brand. Its ZIP code is 46946. Geography Liberty Mills is located at (41.033611, −85.735833) at 778 feet above sea level. Demographics As of the census of 2010 for Zip Code Tabulation Area 46946, there were 136 people, 47 households, and 37 families residing in the town. The racial makeup of the town was 94.9% White, 0.7% African American, 0.7% Native American, 0% Asian, 0% Pacific Islander, 0.7% from other races, and 0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.9% of the population. There were 47 households, out of which 31.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66% were married couples living together, 8.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 21.3% were non-families. 42.6% had households with individuals under 18 years, and 29.8% had households with individuals 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.89 and the average family size was 3.35. In the town the population was spread out, with 31% under the age of 19, 5.1% from 20 to 24, 27.1% from 25 to 44, 22.1% from 45 to 64, and 14.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32.7 years. History On October 16, 1826 and October 23, 1826 in what is now Wabash, Indiana the Potawatomi and Miami Indians respectively signed peace treaties with the United States government to open lands north of the Wabash River to white settlers. These negotiations, led by Michigan Governor Lewis Cass, resulted in the Paradise Springs Peace Treaty. The Potowatomi before that point were located on the Eel River, which they called the Kenapocomoco (KE-NA-PE-COM-A-QUA), in a series of villages named Pierrish’s Village, located at present day North Manchester, three miles south of Liberty Mills. The land that is now Liberty Mills was purchased by James Abbott, who was involved with the treaty negotiations, sold to a Mr. McBride who intended to build a grist mill, and eventually purchased by New York state resident John Comstock. Comstock moved to the area in 1836, where he first built a saw mill, and later a grist mill, a distillery, store, carding mill, and flouring mill. John Comstock, on left\\"John Comstock in his day was easily the biggest and most influential business man and farmer in Northern Wabash county. He was a member of the State Legislature and a probate judge and was progressive in many ways and as stubborn as an ox in others. When the canal was built through Lagro he maintained a warehouse at Lagro and attracted business men to Liberty Mills faster than to North Manchester. However, he could not stand competition, and because of his buying power, could undersell those who dared compete with him. Some of the early business men came to North Manchester. In fact, it was not uncommon in telling the history of an early North Manchester business man to mention that he first located in Liberty Mills.\\" Comstock, often known as Judge Comstock because of his role as Probate Judge (elected in 1846), was also the Representative from this county in the Indiana State Legislature in 1858. His distillery, built in 1839, would send wagon loads of whiskey to areas as far as Mishawaka and Warsaw, Indiana. It brought distress to first his sons, who for religious convictions left the business, and later Comstock himself, who declared \\"I will let that distillery rot!\\" even after offers to purchase it. Due to Comstock’s monopolizing business practices, most local business men left to establish themselves in neighboring North Manchester. In time North Manchester flourished (The population was 6,260 at the 2000 census) while Liberty Mills remained unchanged in size. Comstock was instrumental however in bringing the Detroit, Eel River & Illinois Railroad through the community in 1871, which stretched from Logansport to Butler, Indiana. After a lengthy legal battle with the Wabash Railroad, this railline was sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1901, and eventually came into the Pennsylvania's Vandalia holdings. Then known as the Vandalia Railroad and Butler Branch Railroad, the railroad's use declined over the years until its abandonment from 1954 to 1977. =Covered bridge= Because of its location on a curvy tack of the Eel River, Liberty Mills has been home to numerous bridges, three standing today. At the location of the iron bridge This site refers to this location as \\"Patrick's Bend\\" today (on the north end of town on First Street) was home to the Covered Bridge. Three different covered bridges were built on this location from 1859 to the third being lost in 1953. The first was built in 1859 and lost in 1867.Bridge one: #14-85-16 in the World Guide (according to G. Gould's 1977 list) The second from 1867 to 1872, with a length of 192 feet with a 10-foot overhang at each end.Bridge two: #14-85-17 in the World Guide (according to G. Gould's 1977 list) The third, and most known, was built in 1872 by the Smith Bridge Company and lost in 1953.Bridge three: as #14-85-18 in the World Guide (according to G. Gould's 1977 list) (See pictures of this bridge at Ball State University’s Alvin W. Holmes Collection of Covered Bridges) This Covered Bridge in fact was listed in the Time magazine article “One-Day Railroaders” on Monday, Oct 19, 1936, the town’s first and only note of national attention. =Dam= Crib Dam on the Eel River Liberty Mills was home to a crib dam on the Eel River, located directly south of the existing iron bridge on 1st Street. It was originally built in the nineteenth century to power one of the many mills. By the early twentieth-first century it had been out of operation for numerous years and damaged on the far north end. With a $120,000 grant from the Ohio River Basin Fish Habitat Partnership program and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service the dam was destroyed on October 11 and 12th, 2012. The dam was destroyed to improve fish passages and raise the long-term health of the Wabash River watershed. =School house= Liberty Mills' School House Liberty Mill’s largest structure is the school house, built in 1903. Children were first taught in a log cabin by Harriet Tullis. In 1841, a school building was constructed, lasting until 1872. In 1872, on the northeast corner of Mill and Fourth Street, a two-story building was built to serve as a school and town hall. This building was dismantled in 1903 with a new building being built on the 1872 foundation. The school stopped operating in the 1950s and was refurbished by the owner, Jim Mazerik in 1989. It's currently rented to the Giddens family and they have maintained the inside of it. Nature preserves Although of small size, Liberty Mills is home to several nature preserves controlled by the Tippecanoe Audubon Society, the local chapter of the national Audubon Society, an Izaak Walton League club ground, and a public access site. The \\"Tee-Pee\\" =Taylor Preserve= The Herbert L. Taylor Audubon Preserve is located on the northeast edge of town, stretching along the east side of the Eel River. The Taylor family owned this piece of land for over five generations, from George W. and Elizabeth Taylor in 1903 to Herbert “Herb” Taylor’s donation of the remaining property in 1990. Taylor built a unique structure known as the “Tee Pee”, a three-story house in the shape of an Indian teepee which overlooked the Eel River. Due to increased vandalism, the Tee Pee was destroyed on November 15, 2003. =Flory-Gemmer Marsh and Woods Preserve= The Flory-Gemmer Marsh Preserve and Woods Preserve are two smaller preserves one mile east of Liberty Mills. They were donated to the Tippecanoe Audubon Society in the mid-1990s. =Izaak Walton League Club Grounds= The North Manchester, Indiana chapter of the Izaak Walton League's club grounds are located north of Liberty Mills. These grounds have fishing and shooting sports, including frequent turkey shoot tournaments. =Public access site= On the south end of town is a public access site onto the Eel River. The stretch of the Eel River running by Liberty Mills is known for its canoeing and listed in several canoeing recreational guides. A legend also follows the access site of a particular fatal car wreck which ejected several girls from a vehicle, whose screams can be supposedly still heard today. Notable person Cliff Kindy- Organic farmer and a member of the Christian Peacemaker Teams. Kindy owns a farm one mile east of Liberty Mills, has traveled the world with CPT including Iraq, where he is noted in the May 17, 2004 issue of New Yorker Magazine.

The R639 road is one of Ireland's regional roads. Once designated the N8 national primary road (and before that some fractions were designated as the T6 and others as the T9), it was reclassified in stages as the R639 following the progressive opening of sections of the M8 motorway, which rendered the single carriageway N8 redundant as a national primary road. By-passed sections of the old N8 were generally reclassified as R639 as soon as a new section of M8 opened, thereby increasing the length of the R639. With the completion of the M8 on 28 May 2010, the R639 now stretches from Durrow, County Laois to Cork, running through counties Laois, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Limerick and Cork. Route The R639 leaving Fermoy heading south The R639 runs parallel to the M8 from its junction with the N77 in Durrow in County Laois to the N8 on the Lower Glanmire Road 1.5 km east north of the Dunkettle Interchange on the outskirts of Cork City. North to south, it passes through Durrow, Cullahill, Johnstown, Urlingford, Littleton, Horse and Jockey, Cashel, and New Inn; and from there it runs south-west around Cahir and on through Skeheenarinky before entering County Limerick and passing through the village of Kilbeheny before veering west of Mitchelstown and proceeding south along Kilworth Mountain and through Fermoy, Rathcormack, Watergrasshill, Sallybrook and Glanmire, terminating at the N8 Lower Glanmire Road.

History Tipperary, as shown in Herman Moll's New Map of Ireland (1714). The present R639 may be discerned between Cahir and Cashel only; it existed neither south of Cahir nor north of Cashel at this time. =18th and 19th centuries= In the 17th, 18th and early to mid-19th centuries - and probably earlier still - horse-drawn Dublin-Cork traffic travelled via Kilcullen, Carlow, Kilkenny, Clonmel, Ardfinnan, Clogheen, Ballyporeen, Kilworth, Fermoy and Rathcormac. Much of the R639/N8 route was built to connect the midlands to southern Tipperary and north County Cork as part of the Irish turnpike road-building drive of the mid-18th century.For a detailed treatment of turnpike road construction in 18th-century Ireland, see David Broderick, The First Toll Roads: Ireland's Turnpike Roads, 1729-1858 (Cork, 2002). However, some sections are considerably older, such as the segment between Cork and Fermoy, and that between Cashel and Cahir; the construction of these particular stretches cannot as yet be dated, though they were in place prior to 1714.Herman Moll's New Map of Ireland (1714); see: http://www.swaen.com/zoom_map_large.htm?zoomifyImagePath=/os/zoom/02976/&zoomifyFadeInSpeed;=10 The R639/N8 between Fermoy and Cahir via Mitchelstown was built sometime after 1811,Taylor and Skinner's Maps of the Roads of Ireland (Dublin, 1778)J.H. Andrews, Shapes of Ireland : Maps and Their Makers, 1564-1839 (Dublin, 1997), p. 269 while the R639 between Cashel and Urlingford was built around 1739. At the same time, the route from Urlingford to Maryboro (modern-day Portlaoise) was substantially improved.Broderick, Ireland's Turnpike Roads, p. ii In 1782 an unnamed English tourist in Ireland, known to historians as \\"X.Z.\\", gave a brief description of the route between Cashel and Urlingford: \\"From Cashel we rode fifteen miles of a bad road, through a bleak country to Urlingford, when we enter Leinster province. The country now becomes more populous, better improved, and the roads much more agreeable for travelling.\\"Quoted in Broderick, Ireland's Turnpike Roads, p. 106 =20th and 21st centuries= Contemporary signage on the R639. Some time after 1811 the gaps in the R639 between Fermoy and Cahir were filled,Andrews, Shapes of Ireland, p. 269 but the traditional Cork to Dublin route, known for much of the 20th century as the T6, continued to run from Cork to Cahir, and from there to Dublin via Clonmel, Kilkenny and Carlow. The R639/N8 corridor did not become the official Dublin to Cork road until 1974, though several Esso road atlases considered it to be the preferred route for motorists travelling between the two cities from at least the early 1960s.http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1977/en/si/0164.html From this time until the gradual opening of the various M8 motorway segments beginning with the Fermoy Bypass in 2006, the route was known as the \\"N8\\". The N8 was improved at various times during the 1970s through to the early years of the 21st century. One of the first improvements entailed a realignment of the road so that it bypassed the village of Glanmire for 6 km to the east. This dual carriageway bypass, referred to in official documentation as the \\"Glanmire Bypass\\", opened in April 1992 after a construction period of almost 7 years. When this happened, the former T6/N8 through Glanmire was renumbered, for the first time, as the \\"R639\\". The next major incident in the modern history of the R639 occurred in 1991, when a new 4 km single-carriageway bypass to the south-west of Cahir in County Tipperary opened to traffic. This bypass became a part of the N8 for the next 18 years. With the completion of the M8 motorway through South Tipperary in July 2008 however, the 1991 N8 Cahir Bypass was renumbered as part of the N24 - while simultaneously becoming the R639. (The original route of the N8 through Cahir town was redesignated a regional road in 1991, and made a part of the R670.) Other improvement projects carried out on the road during the 1970s, 80s and 90s involved periodic widening and resurfacing. In spring 2001, attention was turned to Watergrasshill in County Cork. For many years regarded as a serious bottleneck on the N8, a wide median 7 km dual carriageway bypass was constructed and opened to traffic in September 2003 as the N8, with the former road through Watergrasshill becoming the R639.http://www.rte.ie/news/2003/0912/6news_av.html?1200545,null,200 In 2004 the N8 through Cashel in County Tipperary was realigned with a narrow-median dual carriageway bypass to the east of that town. Again, the former N8 through Cashel was redesignated a regional road, and renumbered the R639. In October 2007 the section of N8 between Cashel and Cahir (the same road mapped by Herman Moll in 1714) was bypassed by an early-opening segment of the M8 motorway, and became the most recent addition to the R639 route. This, in turn, was followed in July 2008 by the section between Cahir and Kilbehenny; on 8 December 2008 by the length of road from Cashel to 2 km south of Cullahill in County Laois; on 25 May 2009, by the section between Mitchelstown and Fermoy; and on 28 May 2010 by the length between Durrow and Cullahill. Landmarks The R639 approaching Cashel from the north The road offers a striking view of the Rock of Cashel and famously skirts around its base on its approach to Cashel town. Visible from the R639 too is Hoare Abbey, also close to Cashel. South of Cahir the R639 passes southwest along the base of the Galtee Mountains, while to the east, the fertile plain of the Golden Vale is observable, with the Knockmealdowns and Comeragh Mountains starkly visible to the east. The R639 also passes by Glengarra Wood and Mitcheltown Cave.

The fellowship was jointly funded by the IChemE and the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC). However, NEPIC was unable to contribute in 2018 and the Fellowship is not offered in 2019. The Fellowship was set up in memory of Dr Ashok Kumar, the only serving chemical engineer in the Parliament of the United Kingdom at the time of his sudden death in 2010. Kumar was an IChemE Fellow who had been the Labour MP for Middlesbrough South and Cleveland East. = Whynotchemeng? = In response to a considerable reduction in applications to study the subject at UK universities in 2000 the IChemE established an educational programme and website whynotchemeng? to help young people find out more about a career in the field of chemical engineering. This was credited with the major rise in applications in the following years. The programme included a website, YouTube stream, documents and outreach volunteers. In 2018 the web resource was moved from its own site to one within the IChemE.  Coat of arms  The coat of arms is a shield with two figures.College of Arms, London, 1964 The Armorial Bearings of the Institution of Chemical Engineers On the left a helmeted woman, Pallas Athene, the goddess of wisdom, and on the right, a bearded man with a large hammer, Hephaestus the god of technology and of fire. The shield itself shows a salamander as the symbol of chemistry, and a corn grinding mill as a symbol of continuous processes. Between these is a diagonal stripe in red and blue in steps to indicate the cascade nature of many chemical engineering processes. The shield is surmounted by helmet on which is a dolphin, which is in heraldry associated with intellectual activity, and also represents the importance of fluid mechanics.

His body was never found. Biography Shakhid Baysayev was born in 1939 in Podgornoye, a suburb of Grozny in the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In 2000 he worked as an auto mechanic at a local company; he was married with five children. Disappearance In the morning of March 2, 2002, the Russian OMON paramilitary police forces, who just suffered significant casualties from a notorious friendly fire incident in this neighbourhood of Grozny, conducted a search operation for suspected rebel fighters who were blamed for the incident. Baysayev was detained on his way to work; a witness described him as being in pain and his appearance suggested that he had been beaten. Russian troops filmed the detention themselves and later sold the videotape to his wife, Asmart Baysayeva, for $1,000; the video showing Baysayev lying on the ground and being kicked by a soldier before being taken away. She was also given a sketched map purportedly showing where her husband was buried; at the site, she found a fragment of cloth that looked like it came from his coat. Investigation After the detention of her husband, Baysayeva immediately complained to the authorities. Despite her continued efforts and the existence of the footage of the detention, however, the Russian authorities failed to carry out an effective investigation, prompting Baysayeva to turn to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). On April 5, 2007, in the ruling in the case Baysayeva v. Russia, the European Court ruled that Baysayev's detention was unlawful and that he must be presumed dead.European Court of Human Rights condemns Russia on Chechen disappearance case The Court also found it \\"astonishing\\" that the servicemen depicted in the video, who were unmasked, have still not been identified by the official investigation.

The Dart was the standard single-seat torpedo bomber used by the Fleet Air Arm from 1923 until 1933. A modified variant was also sold to Greece, where they served with the Greek Navy. Design and development Dart at Martlesham Heath In 1919, Blackburn commenced the design of a private venture, carrier-based torpedo- bomber to replace the Sopwith Cuckoos which were the existing torpedo bombers flying from the Royal Navy's carriers. The Blackburn aircraft, the product of their chief designer, Major Frank Arnold Bumpus, was named T.1 Swift.Woodman 1996, pp. 2–3. Although mainly conventional, the large biplane featured two- bay, equal-span wings that were staggered and could fold for storage aboard ship. The wing centre section structure was steel with wooden outer sections, all fabric covered.Jackson 1968, pp. 139–140. Ailerons were mounted on all four wings. The fuselage was mounted on the lower wing, and also consisted of a metal structure with fabric covering. The tail unit had a braced tailplane and fin with a balanced rudder. The divided landing gear had mainwheels on oleo legs that allowed the fitting of a standard torpedo below the fuselage.Flight 7 May 1925, pp. 269–272.Woodman 1996, pp. 3–4. The prototype Swift first flew in September 1920, almost crashing owing to a miscalculated centre of gravity.Mason 1994, p.130. This was resolved by sweeping back the wings, while a revised rudder was fitted to improve directional control. Following this, the Swift proved satisfactory, and an order was placed against Specification 3/20 for a further three aircraft for service trials. These were renamed the Blackburn Dart.Woodman 1996, p. 5. The Dart was powered by either a Napier Lion IIB or V engine that was mounted with a thrustline angled upward; the fuselage also dropped sharply downwards from the cockpit. The prototype Dart was first flown in October 1921, and despite its size handled well, exhibiting a remarkable 43 mph (69 km/h) stalling speed. Blackburn company advertisement announcing the Blackburn Dart (note the erroneous 1920 date) An export model of the Dart retained the name Swift and used the 450 hp (340 kW) Napier Lion engine. Seven were built as the Swift Mk II, two for the Japanese Navy, three for the Spanish Navy, and two for the United States Navy. The U.S. Navy aircraft were designated Swift F by Blackburn and Blackburn BST-1 by the U.S. Navy but following competitive trials in 1921, the U.S. Navy decided not to proceed with an order and purchased the Douglas DT-2 instead. Operational history The Dart T.2 entered service with the Fleet Air Arm in 1923 with No 460 Flight aboard stationed in the Mediterranean and with 461 and 462 Flights on based in home waters. Shore training was conducted by \\"D3\\" Flight at Gosport. In 1928, the Blackburn Dart flew with Nos. 463 and 464 Flights embarked on in the Mediterranean fleet. The following year, a single Dart was delivered to No. 36 Squadron RAF (Coastal Defence Torpedo Flight), initially for smokescreen trials and later to form part of the complement of torpedo bombers in the first fully operational Royal Air Force torpedo bomber squadron. Three Darts were converted into two-seat seaplanes to provide advanced training from 1925 to 1929, at Blackburn's RAF Reserve School on the River Humber. The conversions led to a new variant, the T.3 Velos, which was ordered as a torpedo bomber by the Greek Navy in 1925. Blackburn Dart trainer The Dart continued in service with the Blackburn Reserve School, alongside a number of T.3s converted to landplanes until their eventual replacement by Ripons and Baffins in 1933. One notable event marked the career of the Dart; Air Commodore G.H. Boyce became the first pilot to carry out a night deck landing, when he landed his Dart aboard Furious on 6 May 1926. The flight deck was illuminated by floodlights for the attempt but the docile Dart easily handled the task.

He is a former defensive linemen coach with the Amsterdam Admirals in NFL Europa. He coached as the defensive line coach at the University of Colorado-Boulder in Boulder, Colorado. He is currently the head coach and athletic coordinator at Sterling High School in Houston, Texas. McGhee was a business student while attending the University of Colorado. He studied business with an emphasis in marketing. Kanavis McGhee attended Phillis Wheatley High School in Houston and played college football at Colorado. During his career at Colorado, McGhee was one of the top defenders in college football, earning him first-team All-Big Eight honors, a finalist nomination for the prestigious Dick Butkus Award and runner-up for the Rotary Lombardi Award. Both awards are given annually to top linebackers in college football. Kanavis was drafted in the second round (55th overall) of the 1991 NFL Draft, at 22, as defensive end by the New York Giants, where he played for three seasons until he suffered a left knee injury in August 1993 and the Giants terminated the final year of his contract in May 1994. After this he joined the Cincinnati Bengals as free agent before returning to his hometown to play with the Houston Oilers for the season of 1995. McGhee gained coaching experience while serving as head coach of Ross Shaw Sterling High School in Houston, Texas. In 2006, he spent the season with the Amsterdam Admirals as defensive assistant, participating in the NFL Europa coaching program (a collaboration between the National Football League Players Association and NFL Player Development). In 2007 McGhee returned for a second season and tutored the Admirals' defensive linemen. McGhee worked as a teacher at Challenge Early College High School in Houston, Texas. In 2010 Kanavis returned to Colorado as defensive line assistant under Jon Embree. McGhee has two sons, Davyon McGhee, who played for Kansas State University, also as linebacker, and Kendall Gregory-McGhee, who played for the University of Minnesota as a defensive end. In the October 18, 2010 issue of Sports Illustrated, former NFL agent Josh Luchs alleges that he gave McGhee $2,500 while trying to persuade him to hire Luchs as his agent, while he still played for the University of Colorado. Luchs said McGhee told him his mother was about to be evicted from her rental home and needed the money. According to Luchs, McGhee never paid back the money and did not return his phone calls. If true, the payment would have been considered a major violation of NCAA rules regarding player eligibility.Confessions of an agent, Sports Illustrated, October 18, 2010. Kanavis McGhee has denied that he ever violated NCAA rules and Alfred Williams, who was present at first meeting between McGhee and Luchs, has stated that the information in the article is not true.

Law career He was admitted to the bar in 1854 but later that same year he moved to Madison County, Texas, and then to Huntsville, Texas in 1856 to practice law. In 1860, he was elected prosecuting attorney for Galveston, Grimes, Harris, Montgomery, and Walker counties. American Civil War service From January 28 until February 4, 1861, Abercrombie represented Walker County as a delegate to the state\`s Secession Convention. During the American Civil War he served as lieutenant colonel of Col. Henry M. Elmore's 20th Texas Infantry Regiment. This Confederate States Army unit, organized in the spring of 1862, was composed mostly of middle-aged men. It was assigned to guard duty on the Texas Gulf coast from Galveston to the Sabine River and did not see action outside of the state. It did, however, play an important role in the recapture of Galveston in January 1863. Postbellum After the war, Abercrombie returned to his legal practice at Huntsville and was appointed Commissioner of the Texas Penitentiary in 1867. In November 1886, he was elected to represent the Ninth District as a state senator in the Twentieth Legislature.

Names Yoshino cherry is believed to be endemic to Yoshino District, Nara. In 1900, gave the Yoshino cherry the name Somei-yoshino after the famous place of cultivation, Somei village (current day Toshima). In 1901, Yoshino cherry was given a scientific name Prunus yedoensis by Jinzō Matsumura. However, after Ernest Henry Wilson suggested Yoshino cherry is a hybrid between Prunus subhirtella var. ascendens (Edo higan) and Prunus lannesiana (Oshima zakura) in 1916, Yoshino cherry came to be called Prunus × yedoensis. As for the Korean native cherry called King cherry which was given a scientific name Prunus yedoensis var. nudiflora by a German botanist Bernhard Adalbert Emil Koehne in 1912 continues to be called Prunus yedoensis. The Yoshino cherry has no scientific cultivar name because it is the original cultivar of this hybrid species Prunus × yedoensis. A new name, 'Somei-yoshino' is proposed in accordance with other cultivars of Prunus × yedoensis. Description Inuyama Castle Keep Tower and Cherry Tree in Inuyama, Aichi prefecture, Japan. Prunus × yedoensis is a small, deciduous tree that grows to be (rarely ) tall at maturity. It grows well in hardiness zones 5–8, and does well in full sun and moist but well-drained soil. The leaves are alternately arranged, long and broad, with a serrated margin; they are often bronze-toned when newly emerged, becoming dark green by summer. The flowers emerge before the leaves in early spring; they are fragrant, in diameter, with five white or pale pink petals. The flowers grow in clusters of five or six together. The fruit, a small cherry, is a globose drupe in diameter; they are an important source of food for many small birds and mammals, including robins and thrushes. Although the fruit contain little flesh, it contains much concentrated red juice which can stain clothing and bricks. The fruit is only marginally sweet to the human palate. Cultivation With its fragrant, light pink flowers, manageable size, and elegant shape, the Yoshino cherry is often used as an ornamental tree. Many cultivars have been selected; notable examples include 'Akebono', 'Ivensii', and 'Shidare Yoshino'. From the Edo period to the beginning of the Meiji period, gardeners and craftsman who made the village at Somei in Edo (now Komagome, Toshima ward, Tokyo) grew someiyoshino. They first offered them as Yoshinozakura, but in 1900, they were renamed someiyoshino by Dr. Fujino. This is sometimes rendered as 'Somei-Yoshino'. The Yoshino cherry was introduced to Europe and North America in 1902.Mitchell, A. F. (1974). A Field Guide to the Trees of Britain and Northern Europe. Collins The National Cherry Blossom Festival is a spring celebration in Washington, D.C., commemorating the 1912 gift of Japanese cherry trees from Tokyo to the city of Washington. They are planted in the Tidal Basin park. Several of 2,000 Japanese cherry trees given to the citizens of Toronto by the citizens of Tokyo in 1959 were planted in High Park. Pilgrim Hill in New York City's Central Park is popular for its groves of pale flowering Yoshino cherry trees as they burst into bloom in the spring.

Flowering Yoshino cherry trees.jpgYoshino cherry trees on Pilgrim Hill in Central Park in New York City Putative parental species Most studies show that Yoshino cherry is a hybrid between Prunus speciosa (Oshima zakura) and Prunus pendula f. ascendens (Edo higan). Most studies show that Yoshino cherry is a hybrid between Prunus speciosa (Oshima zakura) and Prunus pendula f. ascendens (Edo higan). *In 1916, Ernest Henry Wilson concluded that Yoshino cherry strongly suggests a hybrid between Prunus subhirtella var. ascendens Wilson (Edo higan) and Prunus lannesiana Wilson (Oshima zakura). It has many characters of the latter and in its venation, pubescence and shape of the cupula resembles the former *In 1963, Takenaka assumed that Yoshino cherry is a hybrid between Prunus lannesiana var. speciose (Oshima zakura) and Prunus subhirtella var. pendula form ascendens (Edo higan). *In 1986, Takafumi Kaneko et al. carried out restriction endonuclease analysis on chloroplast ctDNA. Yoshino cherry showed no interplant variation of ctDNA and had the same ctDNA as P. pendula (Edo higan), differing from P. lannesiana (Oshima zakura) by a single HindIII restriction site. This findings suggests that P. pendula is female parent of P. yedoensis. *In 1995, Hideki Innan et al. conducted DNA fingerprinting study using different kinds of probes, M13 repeat sequence and (GACA)4 synthetic oligonucleotide and concluded that Yoshino cherry was produced only once through hybridization between Prunus lannesiana (Oshima zakura) and Prunus pendula (Edo higan) and that this particular hybrid plant has been spread vegetatively all over Japan, *In 2014, Shuri Kato et al. conducted molecular analysis using nuclear simple sequence repeat (SSR) polymorphisms to trace cultivar origins and Bayesian clustering based on the STRUCTURE analysis using SSR genotypes revealed that Yoshino cherry is a hybrid between Prunus pendula f. ascendens (Edo higan) and Prunus lannesiana var. speciosa (Oshima zakura) although there was also a small and nonsignificant association with Prunus jamasakura. The proportion of each species is Edo higan 47%, Oshima zakura 37%, and jamasakura 11%. Online Resource 5 *In 2015, Ikuo Nakamura et al. analyzed sequences of intron 19 and exon 20 of PolA1. One of two exon 20 sequences found in Yoshino cherry was the same as that of P. pendula (Edo higan), whereas the other sequence was shared with several taxa in seven wild species, including P. jamasakura (Yamazakura) and P. lannesiana (Oshima zakura). Yoshino cherry contained two different haplotypes of the intron 19 sequences; one was the same as that of Oshima zakura. While another haplotype of Yoshino cherry was different from that of Edo higan by two SNPs but identical to one of two haplotypes of P. pendula ‘Komatsuotome,’ which is a cultivar of Edo higan. These results indicated that Yoshino cherry probably originated by the hybridization of cultivars derived from Edo higan and Oshima zakura. Origin debates *In 1908, a French missionary Taquet discovered a native cherry in Jeju islands, Korea and in 1912 a German botanist Koehne gave it a scientific name Prunus yedoensis var. nudiflora. Although this species called Eishu zakura is a variation of Yoshino cherry, from then it was misrepresented that Yoshino cherry was growing naturally in Jeju Island. *In 1933, the Japanese botanist Gen'ichi Koizumi reported that Yoshino cherry originated on Jeju island, South Korea. *In 1962, Yo Takenaka ruled out the possibility of Korean origin by the morphological study. *In 1995 DNA fingerprinting technology was used to conclude that Yoshino cherry grown in many parts of Japan under the name Prunus × yedoensis is indeed clonally propagated from the same hybrid offspring of Prunus lannesiana (Oshima zakura) and Prunus pendula (Edo higan), which confirms the 1991 conclusion given by Iwasaki Fumio that Prunus × yedoensis originated around 1720–1735 by artificial crossing of these species in Edo (Tokyo).(1991), 3:95−110 Oshima zakura is an endemic species found only around Izu Islands, Izu and Bōsō Peninsulas not around Korean Peninsula. *In 2007, a study conducted on the comparison of Japanese Yoshino cherry and Korean King cherry concluded that the trees native to these two places can be categorized as distinct species. *In 2016, the phylogenetic analysis of nrDNA ITS data and the cpDNA haplotype network analysis suggested that independent origin between King cherry and yoshino cherry, respectively. *In 2016, a new scientific name Cerasus × nudiflora was given to King cherry to distinguish it from Yoshino cherry (Prunus × yedoensis).

He would only appear (twice) in Summer League play for the Rockets. Then general manager of the Rockets Carroll Dawson said in 2007 that Badiane was an intriguing prospect and that the Rockets still did intend to bring him to the NBA at some future point, after he had continued to develop his game and skills in Europe.

The willow pattern was actually invented in England and this piece was produced in Staffordshire. A chinaman is a dealer in porcelain and chinaware, especially in 18th-century London, where this was a recognised trade; a \\"toyman\\" dealt additionally in fashionable trifles, such as snuffboxes.Horace Walpole, who took the lease on Strawberry Hill from the toy-woman Mrs Chevenix, said of the little villa in a letter to Sir Horace Mann (5 June 1747), \\"This little rural bijou was Mrs Chevenix's, the toy-woman à la mode, who in every dry season is to furnish me with the best rain-water from Paris, and now and then some Dresden-china cows...\\" Chinamen bought large quantities of Chinese export porcelain and Japanese export porcelain landed by the East India Company, who held auctions twice a year in London. The traders then distributed chinaware throughout England. Imports from China declined at the end of the 18th century. Domestic production by the English potteries became large and the manufacturers, such as Mason and Wedgwood, became successful and supplied their own retail businesses. Chinaware Chinese porcelain was imported into England from the 1680s. London was the main port where between one and two million pieces were landed each year. These were sold at auction by the East India Company and the resulting trade made London the hub for distribution of chinaware throughout the country. London remained the centre of the trade even after large scale production started in the English provinces, especially the Staffordshire Potteries. This was because of the continuing import/export business and the concentration of artistic talent and the cream of society there. Trade The occupation of chinaman was documented by A General Description of All Trades in 1747: \\"This business is altogether shopkeeping, and some of them carry on a very considerable Trade...\\" The cost of becoming an apprentice was usually £20 to £50 but could be as much as £200. A journeyman was given wages of £20 to £30 a year plus board. The value of the stock in trade would typically be £500 but a prosperous merchant might have stock valued at £2,000 or more. One prominent chinaman of this well-to-do sort was James Giles who had premises in Soho and a fashionable showroom near Charing Cross. In the 1760s, Josiah Wedgwood was the first of the English potters to open his own showroom in West End of London rather than making bulk sales to the trade (as well as commissions for large services); eventually others followed. The retail side of Wedgwood's operation was run by his partner — the cultivated merchant, Thomas Bentley. Bentley opened a showroom on the corner of St Martin's Lane, then moved to Greek Street in Soho and opened further showrooms in other fashionable places such as Bath. Competition In 1785, they formed a trade association called the China Club. Collusion developed at the biannual auctions of the East India Company from about 1779. This auction ring depressed the prices obtained at auction and so the trade became unprofitable. The import duty on tea was reduced from 119% to 12.5% in 1784. This increased the demand for tea and so it became the preferred cargo. In 1791, the Court of Directors ordered that, henceforth, china was only to be carried as ballast on their vessels. This reduced the import trade considerably and so, in 1795, the chinaman Miles Mason of Fenchurch Street, asked whether the company would carry private shipments of china for a carriage fee. They declined and Mason went on to develop a business in Liverpool and then Staffordshire. Mason wanted to develop a method of making replacement pieces for existing sets of china. His experiments led to the development of a type of pottery which, like Chinese porcelain, was strong and so resisted chipping. This was ironstone china which developed into a substantial business under his son, Charles, who patented the process. Many other potteries in England copied this style and large quantities were exported to other countries such as France and the United States. The original trade in imports from China ceased in 1798 as the East India Company stopped making bulk sales.

The Virginia Hotel was built in 1847 in Staunton, Virginia, and quickly became known as one of the finest hostelries in the commonwealth. Built on the site of the old Washington Tavern, the northeast corner of Greenville Avenue at New Street, the Virginia Hotel gained fame during the American Civil War as the headquarters of Stonewall Jackson, and served, alternately, as a hospital for Confederate soldiers and as headquarters for conquering Union Gen. David Hunter. It also served as a meeting point for several U.S. Presidents. After the war, the Virginia Hotel thrived under a succession of owners until, in the late 19th century, it was refurbished and renamed the New Virginia. In 1926, the Virginia's owner—Alexander T. Moore—announced he would demolish the historic structure to make way for a new hotel, which would adjoin the newer Stonewall Jackson Hotel, of which he was also owner. Moore demolished the Virginia Hotel in October 1930, but the new hotel was never built due to financial constraints caused by the Great Depression. The lot sat empty for years, was used to house a gas station in the 1950s, and then built upon by the city of Staunton for a parking garage.

It was written in 1845, and is notable for its length, 370 quatrains divided into 27 chapters, and for its wordplay. It is a story of the young shepherd who is forced to leave his home and undergoes adventures as he defeats the villains such as Turks and witches while searching for his true love. The poem has gained immense popularity in Hungary, and is today considered a classic of Hungarian literature. It was adapted into a popular operetta in 1904 and into the animated feature film Johnny Corncob, the first of its kind in Hungary, in 1973. Plot Kukorica Jancsi (\\"Johnny Corn\\") is found abandoned in a corn field as an infant; he is taken in by a peasant landowner, and by his adolescent years, is a shepherd for his master. He is in love with an orphan girl, Iluska, who is being raised by her envious stepmother. Jancsi and Iluska hope to be married, but once, while they are spending time together, many of his sheep wander away, and he is chased from the village by his master. Dejected, he joins a company of hussar cavalrymen en route to France to fight the Turkish invasion there. The hussars journey from Hungary to France (crossing the many, heavily fictionized countries in between, such as Venice, India and Mongolia, where they arrive just in time for the battle. Jancsi saves the French princess from capture, and the king in gratitude offers him her hand in marriage and the kingdom to rule. Jancsi turns the offers down, telling the king about his love for Iluska; the king then gives him a reward of gold, and names him János Vitéz (\\"Sir John\\"). János travels back to Hungary by boat, only to learn that Iluska has been worked to death by her cruel stepmother. In memory of her, he plucks the single rose growing from her grave and keeps it. He then sets off on a series of increasingly more dangerous adventures, hoping to end his life in some glorious feat. He reaches the Land of the Giants, where he kills the king in his castle and has all the other giants pledge fealty to him. Later, he arrives in the Country of Darkness that is ruled by evil witches. He calls on his mighty giant vassals to help him wipe them out. As each witch dies, the forest becomes a little brighter, and János notices that one of them is Iluska's stepmother. She is the last to be destroyed, leaving the land in full daylight. After several years of further wandering, which includes him slaying a dragon, János finally emerges at the end of the world, the coast of the Óperenciás sea (a traditional uncrossable ocean in Hungarian folklore). He again calls a giant, this time to wade across with him on his shoulder. They arrive at an island after two weeks, which turns out to be the Land of the Fairies. János, unable to feel happy without Iluska, wants to kill himself in a small lake, and tosses the rose in first. At this moment, it turns out that the lake contains the Water of Life: the rose changes into the form of Iluska. Reunited, the two lovers get married at once, and the fairies proclaim them king and queen. They live happily ever after. Translation John Ridland, professor of English at University of California, Santa Barbara, released a complete, rhyming English translation in 1999 entitled John the Valiant. The translation made efforts to retain the informalities and tone of the original, such as rendering \\"Kukorica Jancsi\\" as \\"Johnny Grain o'Corn\\" and \\"Illuska\\" as \\"Nelly\\" or \\"Nel\\". Ridland received several honors for his work, including the Balint Balassi Memorial Award presented by the Consul-General of Hungary to the United States. The work has since been made available online for free. Musical adaptation Pongrác Kacsóh was a composer and lyricist who had previously set a folk tale to music (Csipkerózsika). In 1904, he wrote János Vitéz, an adaptation of Petőfi’s poem, which was to become his greatest success. The operetta differed from the poem in several important ways. Most of all, it had a much stronger Hungarian nationalist undercurrent, revealed most explicitly in the ending. * A new character is introduced: Bagó, a friend of Jancsi and his would-be rival for Iluska’s heart. As Iluska makes her choice extremely clear, the sorrowful Bagó joins the hussars at the beginning of the story. * Jancsi is made less responsible for the disaster that leads to his exile. In the book, he is neglecting his duties to spend time with Iluska, and the herd wanders off on its own. In the operetta, the stepmother hires another shepherd to lead the herd to stampede. * Petőfi was a Francophile, and the French in János Vitéz are portrayed as a noble country which simply happens to be under siege. In Kacsóh’s adaptation, they are extraordinarily cowardly and effeminate, to comic effect: the army is in constant retreat, and the king throws a tantrum when he cannot find his smoking pipe. The princess, the only person of any courage, sings a song about how she would love to be a man so that she, at least, could ride into battle. * It is Bagó who delivers the news of Iluska’s death to János, during the middle of the victory celebration; he and János sing a sorrowful duet about the rose. They then go off together to find her, be she “in heaven or in hell.” * The giants and the witches are entirely left out. Instead, the two wanderers have a run-in with the devil in the middle of a forest, who has no luck leading them away from their quest. * The wanderers discover the Spring of Life in the middle of a seemingly endless forest after seven years of searching; the Óperencian ocean is entirely left out. Nearby lives Iluska’s stepmother, who tries to dissuade them from discovering the fountain’s true nature; they discover that she is a witch, and she flies away. * After Iluska’s resurrection, the two lovers are wed by the fairies, and rule as king and queen. The only caveat is that if they should ever leave the kingdom, they will never be let back in. Bagó, who cannot share in the couple’s mutual happiness, decides to return to his village. The celebrations are interrupted by the sound of Bagó’s flute-playing as he begins his journey back (mirroring the interruption of the French victory celebration). The sound mesmerizes János, who is at first unsure what he is hearing; when Iluska tells him that it is only Bagó, János delivers the operetta’s last soliloquy: “It calls me – and you! Do you not hear it? Do you hear? It is the sound of the sheep – the song of the harvesters. It calls me home. I must go!” Iluska decides to go with János, and they depart for their homeland. The ending is the most obviously different, as János decides to abandon immortality, eternal bliss, and even Iluska to return to his village. The sacredness of the Hungarian homeland was a common motif in art of the time, designed to keep nationalism alive in Hungarians under the yoke of Habsburg rule. While it is a clear departure from Petőfi’s original, it is not entirely out of line with the rest of the poet's body of work, who was himself a fiery nationalist (having started, and died in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848).

Chemicals that occur in TPH include hexane, benzene, toluene, xylenes, naphthalene, and fluorene, other constituents of gasoline, of jet fuels, of mineral oils, and of other petroleum products.Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons at Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry,. CDC Petroleum Hydrocarbon Ranges are monitored at various levels depending on the state and testing site. Petroleum Hydrocarbon Ranges TPH is the sum of volatile petroleum hydrocarbons (VPH) and extractable petroleum hydrocarbons (EPH). VPH is also known as petrol (or gasoline) range organics (PRO or GRO) and includes hydrocarbons from C6-C10. Diesel range organics (DRO) includes hydrocarbons from C10-C28.https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-12/documents/8015c.pdf Various methods to analyze the components of TPH are introduced in a Nordic report.Use of Ozone Depleting Substances in Laboratories.

Playing career Smith started his career at Tottenham Hotspur as an apprentice but after a year had failed to break through to the team. He went on loan to Gillingham and then signed for them permanently in 1991, going on to make over 200 appearances. During his time at the Gills in 1995, Smith was on the verge of a move to then Division Two club Brentford. However, when the fee was set at £50,000 by a tribunal, then Brentford manager David Webb felt he could find better value elsewhere, hence the deal fell through and Smith remained at Gillingham for two more seasons. He moved to Fulham in 1997 for two seasons, making 75 appearances and scoring two goals. He scored once against Colchester in the league and also scored against former club Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup, before joining Reading, where he made some 65 appearances in a three-year spell. He was part of promotion-winning sides at Gillingham, Fulham and Reading. Smith briefly joined Stevenage Borough in 2002 before Glenn Cockerill bought him to Woking where he played a vital part in the escape from relegation that season. He made 180 appearances for Woking and had a short spell as caretaker manager before being released in 2007. He signed for Bromley in 2008 before calling time on his playing career. On 19 July 2008, Kingfield hosted a benefit game for Smith to celebrate the six years he spent at Woking. Smith joined Isthmian League Premier Division club Maidstone United as a player on 18 October 2008 following his release from the coaching staff at financially troubled Grays Athletic. He made his debut in the FA Trophy 1st qualifying round tie against AFC Hornchurch. Managerial career Smith was appointed joint caretaker manager of Woking in March 2007 with Graham Baker following the departure of Glenn Cockerill, helping the club to stay in the Conference National. On 4 May 2007, after failing to get the job full-time, Smith was released by Woking following the appointment of Frank Gray as manager.Smith 'hurt' after Woking release, BBC Sport Two weeks later Smith was appointed as the new manager of Conference South team Welling United following the departure of Adrian Pennock to Stoke City.

He was a five-time Canadian Football League All-Star and Hall of Famer. Early years Nettles was born in Jacksonville, Florida and graduated from Englewood High School in 1968. In his senior year, he was Duval County defensive player of the year and third team All-State.Frenette, Gene: Florida Times-Union, September 30, 2009, \\"Former Jacksonville football star Ray Nettles dies at 60\\" Nettles accepted a scholarship to the University of Tennessee but spent his first two years as backup to two-time Pro Bowler Jack Reynolds. In the two seasons that Nettles started as linebacker, Tennessee's record was 21-3 and he was named to the All-SEC team in 1971. Professional career The Miami Dolphins drafted him in 1972, but he chose the CFL because they offered twice as much money and the opportunity to play immediately. At Miami, he would have competed for a starting job against All-Pro linebacker Nick Buoniconti. Nettles was quoted in a 1999 Florida Times-Union article, \\"It's not like I was afraid to play in the NFL. I could have had success there, but I already waited my turn behind Jack Reynolds at Tennessee, and I didn't want to do that again. I wanted to prove myself right away.\\" Nettles started his pro career for the BC Lions in 1972 and was named to the All-Star team his first year. In his second year, he won the 1973 CFL's Most Outstanding Lineman Award and was again named to the All-Star team. He remained with the Lions through the 1976 season, then played for the Toronto Argonauts in 1977, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in 1978, the Ottawa Rough Riders in 1979, and the Calgary Stampeders in 1980. He was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2005. Personal life While playing football, Nettles was known as a tough guy with long hair who partied hard and drove fast motorcycles. His profile on the Canadian Football Hall of Fame website states: \\"He became known as much for his colourful off field personality as for his on field feistiness.\\"Ray Nettles, Canadian Football Hall of Fame Nettles struggled throughout much of his adult life with alcohol and cocaine additions, which contributed to three divorces and multiple attempts at rehabilitation. He was finally successful in November 2008 after a six-week stay at Willingway Hospital. He explained his attitude in a July 2009 interview: > In my mind, I wasn't to live past 50, so I didn't take rehabilitation > seriously the first few times I tried it. I was always standing on the edge, > looking over a cliff, but stepping backwards. A few times, I slipped and saw > a couple of the rocks fall and God spared me many times. I just never could > figure out why until this past year. As part of his sobriety, Nettles became a Christian and regained self-respect and dignity, which allowed him to live his final months at peace.

Desert RATS began in 1997, reviving Apollo-style lunar exploration training from decades earlier.USGS Astrogeology: Astronaut Training The field season takes place for around two weeks each year, usually in September, in planned locations surrounding Flagstaff, Arizona. Some tests have also been conducted near Meteor Crater. These activities are designed to exercise prototype planetary surface hardware and representative mission scenario operations in relatively harsh climatic conditions where long distance, multi-day traversing activities are achievable.  Participants  A portion of the 2006 Desert RATS field team The participants in Desert RATS vary from year to year. Past participants have included researchers from various NASA centers, including Johnson Space Center, Kennedy Space Center, Goddard Space Flight Center, Ames Research Center, Glenn Research Center, Langley Research Center, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Marshall Space Flight Center, as well as contractors Hamilton Sundstrand and ILC Dover, and researchers from numerous universities and institutes, including the Carnegie Institute, the Universities Space Research Association, and Virginia Commonwealth University. In 2010, there were about 200 scientists, engineers, and mission planners participating. Mission support is provided by the Mission Operations Exploration Planning and Operations Center (ExPOC) in Houston.  Education and public outreach  Through live videoconferencing with NASA Explorer Schools and simultaneous webcasts, students around the world are able to watch Desert RATS activities live.NASA - Digital Learning Network: Catalog Event Details The public is also encouraged to follow along through various social media means, including Facebook,https://www.facebook.com/pages/NASA-Desert-RATS/122098681161930 Twitter,https://twitter.com/DESERT_RATS Flickr,https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasadesertrats/ and Ustream.http://www.ustream.tv/channel/desertrats  Technologies tested  D-RATS test of Mars equipment, including suitports During the trials, researchers study the effectiveness of new designs for space suits, robots, rovers, surface networking and communications, exploration information systems and computing, habitats, and other equipment, and gain experience in the use of new technologies designed to make planetary exploration safer, easier, and more efficient. Recent tests have involved the use of an interplanetary delay emulator developed at NASA. They stage mock explorations of the desert, and try out various procedures and techniques for accomplishing the mission. Suited crew members work side by side with robots, and are connected to one another and to the robots by a wireless network. The rugged terrain provides challenges for robotic navigation. In 2005, the Science Crew Operations and Utility Testbed (SCOUT) rover was tested, working alongside two suited crew members. SCOUT could also be manually driven by the crew members. Other robots participating in D-RATS have included a six-legged all terrain vehicle known as ATHLETE, the centaur-like Robonaut, and Matilda, an autonomous support vehicle capable of collecting geologic samples and aiding with path planning. Space suits tested during Desert RATS include ILC Dover's Mark III and I-Suit. Using speech recognition built into their suits, mock astronauts can command robots, adjust suit parameters for comfort, and inquire into the mission status, or the status or location of any crew member or robot. A head-up display inside the suit can show this information as well. In 2005, participants tested a new system for refilling crew members' liquid-air tanks while in use, thus extending in-suit time. At D-RATS 2004 technology demonstrated included the: Spacesuits, Matilda (autonomous robotic support vehicle), an electric tractor, mobile geology lab, a wireless network and other. At D-RATS 2005 technology demonstrated included the: Spacesuits, SCOUT (Science, Crew, Operations and Utility Testbed) Rover, a system to recharge air tanks while they're in use and other. At D-RATS 2006 technology demonstrated included the: ATHLETE, Robonaut/Centaur, Pressurized Rover Compartment, SCOUT Rover, electric tractor and other. At D-RATS 2007 technology demonstrated included the: Spacesuits, SCOUT rover and other. At D-RATS 2008 technology demonstrated included the: Space Exploration Vehicle, CHARIOT, spacesuits, ATHLETE and other. At D-RATS 2009 technology demonstrated included the: Space Exploration Vehicle (including Chassis B), Tri-ATHLETE, spacesuits, K-10 robots and other. At D-RATS 2010 technology demonstrated included the: Space Exploration Vehicle, Habitat Demonstration Unit/Pressurized Excursion Module - including Geolab, Tri-ATHLETE, Centaur 2, Portable Utility Pallets, Portable Communication Terminal Concept and other. In addition, operational concepts explored included understanding the differences in productivity for crew operations and ground support with continuous communication vs. twice-a-day communication and evaluating and comparing two-rover operations in a lead-and-trail mode vs. a divide-and conquer mode.  Planetary Exploration Geophysical Systems  Initiated in 2004, the goal of PEGS is to develop guidelines for seismic hardware suitable for Lunar and Martian exploration. The system must have minimal volume and mass, be self-powered and recharging, wireless and suitable for planetary exploration and astronaut training. The system must be consistent with NASA's exploration vision in which seismic and other geophysical systems will be key elements of planetary exploration, sub-surface assessments and resource development. The system was tested in Barringer Crater in 2004, 2005 and 2006 plus the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica in 2005. Useful reflection records were recorded in Arizona and the refraction survey recorded in Antarctica was used to determine the thickness of the valley fill.

The team continued testing hardware including the Space Exploration Vehicle (SEV), the Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU), and the Centaur Robotic assistant vehicle system. As part of the eXploration Habitat (X-Hab) Academic Innovation Challenge, an attachable inflatable habitat \\"Loft\\" designed and built by undergraduate students at the University of Wisconsin–Madison will be joined to the HDU and provide crew quarters for the astronaut/geologist crews. One of the operational concepts that were explored in the 2011 field season was the effect of communication time delays. This is not a big deal for lunar explorers as the time lag is only a couple of seconds, but at a near-Earth asteroid the time lag might be a minute or more, making normal conversation impossible. At Mars, it is much worse, the lag can be up to 20 minutes each way. Effective strategies for communicating under these conditions include utilizing text messaging, specific voice protocols, and a relay crew member that is not participating in the EVA.  2012 test  The 2012 Desert RATS field tests did not involve either a desert, or a field; rather, they were conducted in JSC's Building 9, the Space Vehicle Mockup Facility. The tools and simulators were configured and optimized for a simulated mission to a near-Earth asteroid. A virtual reality lab provided an immersive environment for the extravehicular activity (EVA) crewmembers, integrating real-time graphics with crewmember motions and kinesthetic sensations of large objects – an asteroid in this case. The Active Response Gravity Offload System (ARGOS), a crane-based, reduced-gravity system, allowed crews to conduct EVAs in simulated microgravity.

Dana Upton Lamb was born in Tustin, California, on January 18, 1901 to John Charles Lamb and Emma Mary Holderman Lamb. J. C. Lamb served as the Orange County Tax Collector for thirty-three years and also raised groves of oranges, lemons and avocados. A 1923 graduate of Santa Ana High School, Dana joined the crews of the steamer W. M. Irish and the S. S. Carenco, traveling to the Eastern United States and Morocco, Egypt, Greece, Italy, Cyprus and Syria in 1924-1925. Active in the Boy Scouts at an early age, Dana Lamb served as field executive for the Orange County Council and as assistant scout executive, Greater Providence Council, Rhode Island, from 1926-1927. He also served as chief of the Laguna Beach lifeguard service, which likely provided him with the training and expertise to begin the Orange County Coast Patrol in the late 1930s. Virginia Marshall Bishop (later Ginger Lamb) was born in Santa Ana, CA, to watchmaker- optometrist Vernon M. Bishop and Nancy Cutler Bishop on September 22, 1912. The family moved to El Centro, California, shortly following Ginger’s birth but returned to Santa Ana sometime around 1921. She graduated from Santa Ana High School in 1930. Dana and Ginger married February 19, 1933. In August, they embarked on what became a three-year, 16,000 mile voyage in their homemade, sixteen-foot canoe, the Vagabunda, from Southern California down the Pacific coasts of Mexico, Guatemala, and Costa Rica, and culminated in their crossing of the Panama Canal in September 1936. They chronicled their adventures in a book, Enchanted Vagabonds (1938), and went on the lecture circuit to capitalize on the great public interest in their journey and lives as adventurers. They continued their travels in Mexico and Central America during the 1940s, during which time they did some research for the Federal Government as special agents and produced a substantial report titled Report on Mexico in 1943. Their second book, Quest for the Lost City (1951), detailed their continued adventures in the 1940s and was the basis for a feature-length film of the same name produced by Sol Lesser and released by RKO Pictures in 1954. The Lambs visited several known Maya sites in the area, including Bonampak, Palenque and Yaxchilan during their \\"quest\\". The Lambs also spent time with the Lacandon Maya of eastern Chiapas. More controversially, the Lambs claim to have discovered their \\"lost city\\", which they named \\"Lashch-Tu- Nich\\", meaning \\"place of carved stones\\" in the Mayan language. Several of the photographs in the book depict the Lambs standing with overgrown ruins. These ruins have never been identified. A Mayan site named Laxtunich is known to have been a subsidiary site of Yaxchilan,David Drew, The lost chronicles of the Maya kings (Berkeley and Los Angeles: The University of California Press, 1999) p. 258 in Chiapas, and has possibly been identified as the archaeological site at Tecolote,Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube, Chronicle of the Maya kings and queens: Deciphering the dynasties of the ancient Maya (New York: Thames & Hudson, 2008) though it is of course unknown whether this is the site the Lambs visited. Most professional archaeologists and fellow explorers discount the Lambs' story of the Lost City and the \\"Golden Books of the Maya\\" as being largely fabricated. Having made the seaside village of Corona del Mar their home base during their years of adventure travel, the growing population explosion in Orange County in the postwar era prompted the Lambs to move to the former mining town of Hillsboro, in the southwestern mountains of New Mexico, in 1962. The Lambs continued to camp and explore Baja California and deliver the occasional lecture, until Ginger Lamb died on February 25, 1967\\\\. The ensuing years for Dana Lamb were not idle, as he had to deal with the ramifications of a disastrous flood in Hillsboro in September 1972 and traveled to Micronesia in 1975-1976 before his death on June 11, 1979.

Biography  Brunton was born on 14 March 1844 in Roxburgh in southeastern Scotland, the son of James Brunton (1781–1863) and his second wife Agnes Stenhouse (1807–1848). James's first wife was Euphemia Lauder (1794–1822), which gives explanation for his middle name, although he was not directly related to the Lauder's of the Bass.James Brunton Grave Headstone He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, beginning research into pharmacology while still a student there, and receiving a gold medal for his 1866 thesis on digitalis. Following additional work in Austria, the Netherlands, and Germany, Brunton returned to University College, London, and while there he was selected for a position at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Brunton's clinical use of amyl nitrite to treat angina was inspired by earlier work with the same reagent by Arthur Gamgee and Benjamin Ward Richardson. Brunton reasoned that the pain and discomfort of angina could be reduced by administering amyl nitrite to open the coronary arteries of patients. In 1874, Brunton was made a Fellow of the Royal Society. He delivered the Goulstonian Lecture in 1877 on \\"Pharmacology and Therapeutics\\" and the Croonian Lecture in 1889 on \\"The Chemical structure of Physiological Action\\", both to the Royal College of Physicians. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1900 New Year Honours list, received the knighthood by Queen Victoria at Osborne House on 9 February 1900, and was made a baronet in 1908. In 1915, he was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. Brunton married Louisa Jane, daughter of Edward Stopford, Archdeacon of Meath, in 1879. She died in 1909. Brunton died in London on 16 September 1916, aged 72, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery. His memorial was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer. Lorimer also designed a plaque to Brunton in Bowden in Roxburghshire, erected in 1920.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son Stopford Brunton. Another son, Lt. Edward Brunton, was killed at the Battle of Loos. Some of Brunton's papers are held at the National Library of Medicine.

United States, 548 U.S. 1 (2006), was a United States Supreme Court case concerning the level of proof required to establish the affirmative defense of duress in a federal criminal case.  Background  In January 2003 the petitioner, Keshia Dixon, purchased firearms at two gun shows. In the course of purchasing them, she provided a false address and falsely stated that she was not under indictment for a felony. Dixon was arrested, tried, and convicted of one count of receiving a firearm while under indictment in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(n) and eight counts of making false statements in connection with the acquisition of a firearm in violation of § 922(a)(6). = Procedural history = At trial, Dixon admitted that she knew she was under indictment when she bought the weapons and that she knew doing so was a crime; her defense was that she acted under duress because her boyfriend threatened to kill her or hurt her daughters if she did not buy the guns for him.The Supreme Court, 2005 Term — Leading Cases, 120 Harv. L. Rev. 322 (2006). In his charge to the jury, the trial judge required her to prove duress by a preponderance of the evidence. After her conviction, Dixon appealed, alleging that this standard was erroneous. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the appeal.United States v. Dixon, Other circuits having ruled to the contrary,See, e.g. United States v. Talbott, 78 F.3d 1183 (7th Cir. 1998); the Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve the circuit split. = Issue = The Supreme Court granted certiorari on the issue of whether the burden of proof in the jury instruction concerning the duress defense violated the Constitution's Due Process Clause and, if so, what should the proper burden of proof be? = Parties' arguments = Dixon contended that once she presented some evidence that she acted under duress, the government should have to disprove duress in order to meet its burden of establishing the guilt of the accused. The government contended they need only prove the elements of the crime, and that Dixon needed to establish duress to be found not guilty.  Opinion of the Court  The court sided with the government, holding that \\"The duress defense, like the defense of necessity that we considered in Bailey v. United States ... may excuse conduct that would otherwise be punishable, but the existence of duress normally does not controvert any of the elements of the offense itself.\\" As to the second question, that of what standard would be appropriate, Justice Stevens wrote that Congress's lack of direction made the decision difficult. \\"There is no evidence in the Act’s structure or history that Congress actually considered the question of how the duress defense should work in this context, and there is no suggestion that the offenses at issue are incompatible with a defense of duress. Assuming that a defense of duress is available to the statutory crimes at issue, then, we must determine what that defense would look like as Congress 'may have contemplated' it.\\" The general practice at the time the statute was written (1968) was to use the common law rule giving the defendant the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. Stevens held for the majority that this was the standard that should apply. = Concurrences =  Kennedy's concurrence  Justice Kennedy concurred in the result, but suggested that the Court should not limit the standards lower courts might apply. \\"Absent some contrary indication in the statute, we can assume that Congress would not want to foreclose the courts from consulting these newer sources and considering innovative arguments in resolving issues not confronted in the statute and not within the likely purview of Congress when it enacted the criminal prohibition applicable in the particular case.\\"  Alito's concurrence  Justice Alito agreed with Stevens, but would have held that the common law rule applied to all federal crimes absent some indication otherwise. \\"Although Congress is certainly free to alter this pattern and place one or both burdens on the prosecution, either for all or selected federal crimes, Congress has not done so but instead has continued to revise the federal criminal laws and to create new federal crimes without addressing the issue of duress. Under these circumstances, I believe that the burdens remain where they were when Congress began enacting federal criminal statutes.\\" = Dissent = Justice Breyer wrote that the government should have the burden of proof in affirmative defenses. \\"I agree with the majority that the burden of production lies on the defendant, that here the burden of persuasion issue is not constitutional, and that Congress may allocate that burden as it sees fit. But I also believe that, in the absence of any indication of a different congressional intent, the burden of persuading the jury beyond a reasonable doubt should lie where such burdens normally lie in criminal cases, upon the prosecution.\\"  References  External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:2006 in United States case law ","title":"Dixon v.

The Pravara has been extensively used in identifying ones ancestry and thus giving salutations to the listener. In vedic ritual, the importance of the pravara appears to be in its use by the ritualist for extolling his ancestry and proclaiming, \\"as a descendant of worthy ancestors, I am a fit and proper person to do the act I am performing.\\" Generally, there are three, five or seven pravaras. The sacred thread yajnopavita worn on upanayana has close and essential connection with the concept of pravaras related to Brahmin gotra system. While tying the knots of sacred thread, an oath is taken in the name of each one of these three, five or seven of the most excellent rishis belonging to one's gotra. The full affiliation of a brāhamana consists of (1) gotra, (2)sutra (of Kalpa), (3)shakha, (4)pravaras . (Example :) A brahmana named 'Rama' introduces himself as follows : I am 'Rama', of Sarvarna gotra, of Gobhil sutra, of Taittiriya shākha of Saamved, of five pravaras named Bhārgava, Chyāvana, Āpnavan, Aurva and Jāmdagnya (This example is based upon the example given by Pattābhirām Shastri in the introduction to Vedārtha- Pārijata, cf. ref.). While the gotras were classified initially according to seven rishis, the pravaras were classified under the names of the following seven rishis: Agastya, Angirasa, Atri, Bhrigu, Kashyap, Vashista, and Vishvamitra. According to the listing of authors included in the verses in Rigved, the rishi Jamadagni was a descendant of rishi Bhrigu while the rishis Gautam and Bharadvaja were the descendants of rishi Angirasa. The pravara identifies the association of a person with two, three (or sometimes five) of the above-mentioned rishis. It also signifies the Sutras contributed to different Vedas by those rishis. For example, Gothram has 2 rishis associated with it viz., Nidruva and Avatsara. Another Gothram in Andhra Pradesh has 7 Rishis associated with it viz. Aavatsara, Naidruva, Rebha, Raibha, Sandila, Sandilya. Pravaras also help in identifying different gotras bearing the same name. For eg: Harita Gotra with Pravaras Angirasa, Ambarisha, Yuvanaswa is different from Harita Gotra which has a single Pravara Vashishta.

Albright was a major proponent of this view (AASOR - 1921/1922, pp. 19–20). As for the Egyptian texts that mention Beth-Anath, see the Zenon Papyri. Cf. Stephen G.

Education, professor  Van Hoogstraten was born in Hoogstraeten, Belgium. He studied the classics and theology with the Dominicans at Louvain, and in 1485 was among the first in the history of that institution to receive the degree of Master of Arts. He there entered the order, and after his ordination to the priesthood in 1496, he matriculated in the University of Cologne to continue his theological studies. The general chapter held in 1498 at Ferrara appointed him professor of theology in the Dominican college of Cologne. In 1500 he was elected prior of the convent in Antwerp, and on the expiration of his term of office returned to Cologne, where, in February, 1504, he received the degree of Doctor of Theology. At the general chapter of Pavia in 1507 he was made regent of studies, and thereby became professor of theology in the university. His vast theological attainments and his natural ability to impart knowledge made him an exceptionally successful teacher.  As controversialist, Inquisitor  Hoogstraten began his controversial career by publishing in defence of the mendicant orders, who had been accused of abusing their privileges, his Defensorium fratrum mendicantium contra curatos illos qui privilegia fratrum injuste impugnat (Cologne, 1507). In the following year he published several works against the eminent Italian jurist, Pietro Tomasi of Ravenna, who was then lecturing in the German universities. During his controversy with the Italian jurist he was elected prior of the convent of Cologne, and thus became inquisitor general of the archbishoprics of Cologne, Mainz, and Trier. =Opposition to Judaism and Lutheranism= He played his principal role, however, in the controversy with Johann Reuchlin on the confiscation of Jewish books, in the course of which Reuchlin's opponents were satirized in the famous Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum. While he took no active part in the earlier stages of the controversy, his sympathies, nevertheless, as is evidenced by his relations with the converted Jew, Johann Pfefferkorn, were with Reuchlin's opponents. Influenced no doubt, to some extent by the unfavourable attitude of the universities towards the Jewish books, Hoogstraten on 15 September 1513, in his capacity as inquisitor, summoned Reuchlin to appear within six days before the ecclesiastical court of Mainz to answer to the charges of favouring the Jews and their anti-Christian literature. The latter appealed to Rome; whereupon Pope Leo X authorized the Bishop of Speyer to decide the matter. Meanwhile, Hoogstraten had Reuchlin's Augenspiegel, a previously published retort to Pfefferkorn's Handspiegel, publicly burned at Cologne. On 29 March 1514, the Bishop of Speyer announced that the Augenspiegel contained nothing injurious to the Catholic Faith, pronounced judgment in favour of Reuchlin, and condemned Hoogstraten to pay the expenses consequent upon the process. The latter appealed to Rome, but the pope postponed the trial indefinitely. At the instance of Franz von Sickingen and others, the Dominicans deprived Hoogstraten of the office of prior and inquisitor, but in January, 1520, the pope annulled the decision of the Bishop of Speyer, condemned the Augenspiegel, and reinstated Hoogstraten. Hoogstraten was the initial inquisitor who in 1523 sentenced to death Johann Esch and Heinrich Voes, the first Lutherans to be martyred by the Roman Catholic Church. Hoogstraten himself died in Cologne, in his seventies.

The company was founded in 1998 by Dennis \\"Rusty\\" Sheppard and branded as Environmental Indian Construction (EIC), which focused on environmental remediation type projects. In 2002, CEO Matthew D. James purchased controlling interest in the small company and changed the name from EIC to Native American Services Corp (NASCO). NASCO is a Design Build, CM/GC company that primarily performs commercial and industrial construction in approximately 30 states nationwide, and internationally. NASCO specializes in Job Order Contracting (JOC) for various Governmental agencies including all branches of the U.S. Military, the Department of Defense (DOD), Homeland Security, Center for Disease Control (CDC), as well as several other Governmental agencies. In December 2012 NASCO purchased a 49% ownership interest in DWG & Associates Inc. (a Utah Corporation). In January 2016 NASCO completed a stock buy back, of all of James' outstanding stock shares, and Rick L. Luna was named president and CEO in May of that year. Also in 2016, NASCO formed NASCO Energy International (NEI), A United Kingdome (UK) corporation, as it procured energy based contracts internationally. In 2016 NASCO began leveraging its Job Order Contract (JOC) expertise gained in its dealings with the Federal Government, and began procuring JOC awards at several universities around the United States. In 2017 Nasco incorporated Nasco Safe Productions in an effort to provide quality control (QC) and Safety support for Small Businesses, and others in the Federal and Constriction disciplines. Additionally in 2017, NASCO formed NASCO Industrial Services and Supply (NISS) to perform Construction Services, and Industrial Supply for global mining organizations. Key Partnerships NASCO spent many years building relationships, and through the help and guidance of the Small Business Administration, entered the Mentor Protégé program, and formed what would be known as \\"The NASCENT Group J.V\\" which helped NASCO compete for contract vehicles previously not available to a small company. It would also help their partner corporation The Shaw Group (Shaw Beneco), benefit from the \\"Set Aside\\" contracts reserved for Native American and Disadvantaged Businesses with the United States Government. In 2004, The NASCENT Group J.V. was awarded the largest contract in the State of Utah, for the design build project of the new Blaine Section Headquarters for the United States Department of Homeland Security at Blaine, Washington. The NASCENT GROUP J.V. is 51% owned by NASCO and 49% owned by Shaw Beneco inc. The NASCENT group currently handles the work on the JOC (Job Order Contract) at Fort Gordon, SABER (Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineering Requirements) at Seymour Johnson AFB and Holloman AFB and IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity) Contracts at Fort Leonard Wood. In 2007, it was announced that NASCO would be starting a new Joint Venture with Washington Group International to go after more contracts across the United States. The New Joint Venture is called NASCO/Washington Group J.V. In 2014 Nasco was approved by the SBA as the Mentor, under the Mentor Protégé Joint Venture Program (MPJV), with Mirador Enterprises Inc. out of El Paso Texas. Under this Joint Venture, the team was awarded multiple contracts including the Front Range Saber (Colorado), BIA MATOC (New Mexico), Black Hills MATOC (S. Dakota), and the Ft. Bragg MATOC (N. Carolina), and Fort Benning MATOC (Georgia), to name a few. In 2017 Nasco entered into an MPJV with Mevacon LLC. out of Las Cruces, NM under which the JV was awarded the JOC contract at Ft. Hood Texas. Major Contracts In 2003 NASCO was awarded a their first Indefinite-delivery- indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract at Fort Gordon, Georgia. Also in that year, they won a five-year MATOC contract with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers which included building the United States Border Patrol station in Blaine, Washington which is also currently the headquarters of the Blaine Section of the United States Department of Homeland Security NASCO currently has, or has completed contracts at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base (North Carolina), Holloman Air Force Base (New Mexico), Fort Leonard Wood (Missouri), Indiana MATOC, Anniston JOC (Alabama), Florida SATOC (Jacksonville), Compec II SABER (Nationwide), as well as several other Government, private construction, and University jobs nationwide. Awards NASCO has been the recipient of several major awards, including the US Small Business Administration's \\"Administrators Award for Excellence\\". In 2006, 4 years after buying controlling interest in NASCO, Matthew D. James was awarded the Idaho Minority Business Person of the year. In 2008, the US Department of Homeland Security awarded NASCO with a Small Business Excellence Award for its services at the Federal law Enforcement Training Centet (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia.

Plot introduction A civil servant falls for a younger man and thereby discovers Ecstasy. Plot summary Robin is doing research in the United States. He goes into a bar where he meets Sylvan, and calls Jane; she tells him she is pregnant with his baby. The novel flashes forward to 1995 where the main protagonist, Alex, is visiting Justin, an ex-boyfriend, and his partner. He drives to their house in the country. Robin's son, Danny, is also there. After a flashback to Simon's (Robin's lover prior to Justin) AIDS related death, the plot goes back to Justin and Robin's cottage where the men are drinking and play with their young attractive neighbour Terry. Whilst driving Alex to see the local picturesque cliffs, Robin scares everyone by accelerating quickly and only stopping right before the cliff's edge. Later, Danny and Alex meet-up in Soho where they walk into Aubrey and Hector. It is clear that Danny knows many attractive gay men and slept with most of them. The two men go on to have dinner in a nice restaurant, followed by dancing at a club, where Alex is given his first pill of ecstasy by Danny. His desire quickly blurs as he is unsure if it is the drug or his attraction to Danny that allows him to kiss the younger man. Justin is bored alone in his house. He calls Terry for casual sex. Later, Danny and his older friend George are driving to a party – Danny confesses to being bored with Alex. Alex and Hugh talk about Danny's lack of cultural knowledge and Alex's drug use. Later, Danny is organising a party and Alex wonders if he didn't perhaps waste his youth by not going to raves. Robin and George pick up their friends at the station. Danny's birthday party looks like a gay nightclub, as it is filled with attractive gay men doing drugs. Robin has a sexual encounter with Lars. Danny gets a new job as a nocturnal security guard, to Alex's annoyance. He takes cocaine from a man he meets in the toilet and is caught with it. He then goes clubbing after he is fired. Later he returns home and Alex comes over; he tells him he wants to quit his job. Robin suggests Danny and Alex stay in Robin and Justin's cottage whilst they are separated. There, they make love in Robin and Justin's bed and take to going for walks. Alex explains how Justin's father died when they were away on holiday together, how this was the end of their relationship. Later, they take ecstasy. Robin tells Tony he has had to let parts of his house for financial security. Later, he walks round the house looking back towards the past, and Terry pops in – they make love. Justin is house-hunting with the aid of an attractive estate agent, Charles. Later in his hotel he has sex with Carlo, an escort. After seeing another house, he goes into a bar in Soho. Eventually he returns home and Robin is there; they play Scrabble together. Danny then goes to Dorset to see his father and his lover. They are hanging by the beach. Later at a party, whilst playing cricket, Danny says he is going to visit his mother in San Diego, to Alex's surprise. He then proceeds to break up with him. A little later, Alex, Nick, and Danny are off to visit a castle. Alex craves the pleasures that Danny has introduced him to. He attempts to call a drug dealer to no avail but later walks into Lars on the street, who says he can get him anything he wants. The novel ends with Alex and his new, more stable boyfriend Nick standing at the cliff's edge, admiring the beauty of stopping before going over.

Renamed USS Buchanan County (LST-504) for counties in Iowa, Missouri, and Virginia on 1 July 1955, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. LST-504 was laid down on 21 July 1943 at Jeffersonville, Indiana by the Jeffersonville Boat & Machine Company; launched on 19 October 1943; sponsored by Mrs. W. J. Griffin; and commissioned on 18 December 1943. During World War II, LST-504 was assigned to the European Theater and participated in the Invasion of Normandy.  D-Day  As part of Operation Overlord, LST-504 departed Weymouth, England, on June 4th 1944. However, she turned back due to bad weather and would later re-embark on the night of June 5th. LST-504 reached Omaha beach the next morning, and dropped anchor about a half mile off shore to avoid floating mines. In subsequent round trips made over the course of 30 days, the ship did land directly on the beach. On one such trip, the ship carried members of the 38th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron (Mechanized).  Later Service  Following her service in Operation Overlord, LST-504 was directed towards Sicily to prepare for the invasion of Southern France. En Route, the convoy that LST-504 now led spotted a German ship. Orders were given for the convoy to turn, however one ship misinterpreted the order and turned the wrong way. A collision with that ship damaged the bow door of LST-504. The 504 was diverted to Bizerte, Tunisia for repairs. Once the repairs were completed, the 504 embarked for her original destination of Italy. For the months of August and September, 1944, LST-504 carried troops between Italy and Southern France. She was then assigned to the Asiatic- Pacific Theater and took part in the assault and occupation of Okinawa Gunto in April and June, 1945. Following the War, LST-504 performed occupation duty in the Far East until mid-January, 1946.She was decommissioned on 15 January 1946 in Tokyo Bay. The decommissioning ceremony took place on the main deck of the 504 at 5 minutes after 4 o'clock (1605 hours).

The most common braided Hopf algebras are objects in a Yetter–Drinfeld category of a Hopf algebra H, particularly the Nichols algebra of a braided vectorspace in that category. The notion should not be confused with quasitriangular Hopf algebra.  Definition  Let H be a Hopf algebra over a field k, and assume that the antipode of H is bijective. A Yetter–Drinfeld module R over H is called a braided bialgebra in the Yetter–Drinfeld category {}^H_H\\\\mathcal{YD} if * (R,\\\\cdot ,\\\\eta ) is a unital associative algebra, where the multiplication map \\\\cdot :R\\\\times R\\\\to R and the unit \\\\eta :k\\\\to R are maps of Yetter–Drinfeld modules, * (R,\\\\Delta ,\\\\varepsilon ) is a coassociative coalgebra with counit \\\\varepsilon , and both \\\\Delta and \\\\varepsilon are maps of Yetter–Drinfeld modules, * the maps \\\\Delta :R\\\\to R\\\\otimes R and \\\\varepsilon :R\\\\to k are algebra maps in the category {}^H_H\\\\mathcal{YD}, where the algebra structure of R\\\\otimes R is determined by the unit \\\\eta \\\\otimes \\\\eta(1) : k\\\\to R\\\\otimes R and the multiplication map :: (R\\\\otimes R)\\\\times (R\\\\otimes R)\\\\to R\\\\otimes R,\\\\quad (r\\\\otimes s,t\\\\otimes u) \\\\mapsto \\\\sum _i rt_i\\\\otimes s_i u, \\\\quad \\\\text{and}\\\\quad c(s\\\\otimes t)=\\\\sum _i t_i\\\\otimes s_i. :Here c is the canonical braiding in the Yetter–Drinfeld category {}^H_H\\\\mathcal{YD}. A braided bialgebra in {}^H_H\\\\mathcal{YD} is called a braided Hopf algebra, if there is a morphism S:R\\\\to R of Yetter–Drinfeld modules such that :: S(r^{(1)})r^{(2)}=r^{(1)}S(r^{(2)})=\\\\eta(\\\\varepsilon (r)) for all r\\\\in R, where \\\\Delta _R(r)=r^{(1)}\\\\otimes r^{(2)} in slightly modified Sweedler notation – a change of notation is performed in order to avoid confusion in Radford's biproduct below.  Examples  * Any Hopf algebra is also a braided Hopf algebra over H=k * A super Hopf algebra is nothing but a braided Hopf algebra over the group algebra H=k[\\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z}] . * The tensor algebra TV of a Yetter–Drinfeld module V\\\\in {}^H_H\\\\mathcal{YD} is always a braided Hopf algebra. The coproduct \\\\Delta of TV is defined in such a way that the elements of V are primitive, that is :: \\\\Delta (v)=1\\\\otimes v+v\\\\otimes 1 \\\\quad \\\\text{for all}\\\\quad v\\\\in V. :The counit \\\\varepsilon :TV\\\\to k then satisfies the equation \\\\varepsilon (v)=0 for all v\\\\in V . * The universal quotient of TV , that is still a braided Hopf algebra containing V as primitive elements is called the Nichols algebra. They take the role of quantum Borel algebras in the classification of pointed Hopf algebras, analogously to the classical Lie algebra case.  Radford's biproduct  For any braided Hopf algebra R in {}^H_H\\\\mathcal{YD} there exists a natural Hopf algebra R\\\\\\\\# H which contains R as a subalgebra and H as a Hopf subalgebra. It is called Radford's biproduct, named after its discoverer, the Hopf algebraist David Radford. It was rediscovered by Shahn Majid, who called it bosonization. As a vector space, R\\\\\\\\# H is just R\\\\otimes H . The algebra structure of R\\\\\\\\# H is given by :: (r\\\\\\\\# h)(r'\\\\\\\\#h')=r(h_{(1)}\\\\boldsymbol{.}r')\\\\\\\\#h_{(2)}h', where r,r'\\\\in R,\\\\quad h,h'\\\\in H, \\\\Delta (h)=h_{(1)}\\\\otimes h_{(2)} (Sweedler notation) is the coproduct of h\\\\in H , and \\\\boldsymbol{.}:H\\\\otimes R\\\\to R is the left action of H on R. Further, the coproduct of R\\\\\\\\# H is determined by the formula :: \\\\Delta (r\\\\\\\\#h)=(r^{(1)}\\\\\\\\#r^{(2)}{}_{(-1)}h_{(1)})\\\\otimes (r^{(2)}{}_{(0)}\\\\\\\\#h_{(2)}), \\\\quad r\\\\in R,h\\\\in H.

The \\"love outside the box\\" symbol for Polyamory, non-monogamy, and LGBTQ. A free union is a romantic union between two or more persons without legal or religious recognition or regulation. The term has been used since the late 19th century to describe a relationship into which all parties enter, remain, and depart freely. The free union is an alternative to, or rejection or criticism of marriage, viewing it as a form of slavery and human ownership, particularly for women. According to this concept, the free union of adults is a legitimate relationship that should be respected. A free union is made between two individuals, but each individual may have several unions of their own. History Much of the contemporary tradition of free union under natural law or common law comes from anarchist rejection of marriage, seeking non-interference of either church or state in human relations. Leaving behind what was seen as law imposed by man in favor of natural law began during the late Enlightenment, when many sought to rethink the laws of property, family, and the status of women. Utopian socialist Robert Owen (1771–1858), who decried marriage as principally linked to the principle of ownership, offers a foretaste of the free union by use of the term \\"marriage contract in front of nature.\\" Philosopher and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–1797) stated, \\"Marriage is an affirmation of the supremacy of man over woman [...] if I love a man, I want to love him while keeping my freedom.\\" In the 1882, Élisée Reclus initiated the Anti-Marriage Movement, in accordance with which he and his partner allowed their two daughters to marry without any civil or religious ceremony, despite public and legal condemnation. Reclus had four partners throughout his lifetime, each with a different social contract. In more modern times, free unions were common among members of the Spanish anarchist CNT political party during the popular revolution that ran alongside the Spanish Civil War. The couple desiring contractual validation of their relationship would simple go to the Party Headquarters and request the forms, which would be destroyed if the relationship were to not work out. The couple however, were strongly encouraged to make it work, as separation created administrative work for the party. Additionally, many leading 20th Century intellectuals, including James Joyce, Pablo Picasso and their partners, and Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir never chose to marry, or delayed it until the end of life for legal reasons. De Beauvoir said of the institution, \\"When we abolish the slavery of half of humanity, together with the whole system of hypocrisy that it implies, then the 'division' of humanity will reveal its genuine significance and the human couple will find its true form.\\" Contemporary law In French law, the union libre is an agreement between adults which grants rights between parents and potential children, but holds no obligation of sexual fidelity, nor does it grant reciprocal duties and rights between partners. A free union can be between individuals of any gender, and an individual may have several concurrently, therefore making free union an option for LGBTQ or polyamorous relationships, as well as heterosexual and/or monogamous ones that do not wish to enter the contract of marriage for historical, social, or financial reasons. United States law has no exact legal equivalent of a free union, although comparisons are often made to common law marriage. In the United States, partners wishing to have legal rights without entering into a marriage contract may choose to complete documents such as a healthcare proxy, domestic partnership agreement, will, and power of attorney. Members of a free union may refer to each other as partners, spouses, or any other title, but may find themselves subject to the laws of common law marriage if they consistently refer to themselves as husband and wife according to their local jurisdiction. Roman Catholic criticism According to Catholicism, the expression \\"free union\\" includes situations such as concubinage, rejection of marriage as such, or inability to make long-term commitments.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2390 According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, being in a \\"free union\\" is a grave offense against the dignity of marriage,Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2400 which it sees as a Sacrament.\\"Sacrament of Marriage\\". Catholic Encyclopedia. [www.newadvent.org/cathen/09707a.htm] However, proponents maintain that the free union acts as a public recognition of a relationship without the obligations of church or state.

Design and development The Marathon originated as a design to meet the requirements of the Brabazon Committee. It was designed by Miles Aircraft Limited as a high-wing cantilever monoplane with four engines and all-metal construction. It was capable of carrying two crew and up to 20 passengers. The aircraft was designated the Miles M.60 Marathon with the first of three prototypes (registered U-10) flying on 19 May 1946. A total of 25 aircraft were ordered by the Ministry of Supply and 25 by British European Airways, but Miles had financial problems and needed orders for over 100, not helped when the prototype aircraft crashed and the power shortages led to the loss of components already produced. When the Miles company went bankrupt, Handley Page bought the assets, including the factory at Woodley near Reading, Berkshire and design rights to the Marathon. The new company, known as Handley Page (Reading) Limited, started producing the Marathon with 40 aircraft built over the next three years with the new designation Handley Page (Reading) H.P.R.1 Marathon 1. A twin-engine prototype turboprop-powered version (using the Armstrong Siddeley Mamba) was flown in 1949. Operational history The first production Marathon 1 aircraft (registered G-ALUB) left Woodley on 14 January 1950 for a sales tour of Australia and New Zealand. The aircraft was painted in BEA markings as \\"Rob Roy\\" in September 1951 and was demonstrated to the airline at Heathrow. During acceptance tests for British European Airways it was decided that the Marathon was not suitable to replace the de Havilland Dragon Rapide and the order was reduced to seven aircraft, none of which was accepted by BEA.Jackson 1973, pp. 253–254. Six Marathons were delivered to the West African Airways Corporation in late 1952 for operation in and between the British colonies in that region. They were replaced in 1954 by de Havilland Herons. The last three production aircraft were given increased tankage and sold to Union of Burma Airways which operated them in the region for several years.Jackson 1973, pp. 254–255. Marathon 1A of the Royal Aircraft Establishment in September 1956 Most of the returned and unsold aircraft were then diverted for use by the Royal Air Force as navigation trainers with the designation Marathon T.11. After internal modifications, most of the 28 aircraft taken on charge from early 1953 were used by No. 2 Air Navigation School at RAF Thorney Island, Hants. A total of 16 aircraft were transferred to RAF Topcliffe, Yorks in June 1958 when No.1 Air Navigation School relocated there. By February 1959, only eight were airworthy. Apart from mechanical unreliability, the main problem was tail- heavy trim, an absolute ceiling of 9,500 feet, and a rate of climb of only 300 ft a minute. The navigational trainers were retired in April 1959 and most were quickly scrapped.Thetford 1976, p. 307. A few Marathons were operated by other UK military users including the Royal Aircraft Establishment. Derby Aviation H.P.R.1 Marathon at Manchester Airport in October 1956. Three Marathons were acquired in 1955 by Derby Aviation, based at Burnaston airport near Derby and predecessor of British Midland Airways. The aircraft were used on scheduled services within the UK and to the Channel Islands until their withdrawal in December 1960. Two aircraft (G-ALVY/XA252 and G-AMER/XA261) were returned from the RAF to F.G. Miles at Shoreham for planned use on scheduled services but this failed to happen and they were scrapped in 1962. One aircraft was delivered to Jordan in September 1954 for the personal use of King Hussein. The Mamba-powered Marathon testbed was later fitted with Alvis Leonides Major radial engines and used as a testbed for the projected Herald.

Early life and education Barry Streek was educated at Michaelhouse in Kwazulu-Natal after which he completed his national service in the South African Navy in 1966. At the time national service was mandatory for all white males of a certain age in South Africa. From 1967 to 1970 Streek studied politics and law at Rhodes University in Grahamstown, while contributing to the Daily Dispatch and other publications. Anti-apartheid activities At Rhodes he joined the anti-apartheid National Union of South African Students and was involved in many anti-apartheid activities at the university for which the then South African government later put a banning order on him. It was revealed in later years that the police special branch, with direct assistance from the university, had compiled a substantial file on Streek's anti-apartheid activities. While at Rhodes Streek also worked for the local committee of Helen Suzman's Progressive Party. After graduation in 1971 Streek assumed duty as secretary-general of the National Union of South African Students in Cape Town. In July he issued a circular to the executive members of NUSAS describing the development of the post-1953 imposition of university apartheid based on a letter written for the annual student assembly in July 1968. By 1971 black tertiary students in South Africa were isolated and, some might say, offered at best a mediocre parody of a university education, on ethnically segregated campuses which deprived them of regular contact with South Africans whose ethnicity, and even mother-tongue, was different from theirs. These were the so-called 'tribal colleges'. With Streek's prompting, NUSAS was seeking to raise the awareness of its predominantly 'white' membership of the conditions under which other South Africans lived and studied while at university, a necessary strategy since students belonging to different 'population groups' were effectively barred from one another's campuses. As a journalist for a number of South African newspapers Streek was known for detailing and exposing the negative impact of the apartheid government. In 1984 he founded the Social Change Assistance Trust (SCAT), a non-profit organisation that works to assist and help develop poor rural communities in South Africa. SCAT's mission was, and still is, to assist rural communities in improving their quality of life and living standards. SCAT's focus is on human rights, gender and racial equity, as well as local economic development in the poorest communities of South Africa, which also tend to be predominantly black communities, was not popular with the apartheid government of South Africa. Through SCAT he helped establish the civil society and trade union center at Community House where he was chairperson of the centre's board of directors. Career as a journalist 25 years of Streek's long career as a political journalist was spent in the Parliamentary Press Gallery in Cape Town. For most of this time Streek worked for South African Associated Newspapers which at the time included the Cape Times, the Eastern Province Herald, the Rand Daily Mail, the Sunday Express, and the Sunday Times. Streek was, at different times, chairperson, vice chairperson and president of the Cape Town Press Club. He became Parliament's media manager in 2001 before returning to the press gallery as a correspondent for the Mail & Guardian newspaper. After which he became editor-in-chief for publishing house Jonathan Ball. Death He died after an 18-month battle with brain cancer in 2006. In March 2006 SCAT renamed SCAT House, the organisation's headquarters in Cape Town city center, Barry Streek House and initiated a series of awards in honour of him. The Cape Town Press Club initiated a scholarship for people from previously disadvantaged backgrounds to study journalism at Rhodes University.

It is one of a series of accounts describing the conflicts between Enmerkar, king of Unug-Kulaba (Uruk), and the unnamed king of Aratta (probably somewhere in modern Iran or Armenia). Because it gives a Sumerian account of the \\"confusion of tongues\\", and also involves Enmerkar constructing temples at Eridu and Uruk, it has, since the time of Samuel Kramer, been compared with the Tower of Babel narrative in the Book of Genesis. Synopsis Near the beginning of the account, the following background is provided: \\"In those days of yore, when the destinies were determined, the great princes allowed Unug Kulaba's E-ana to lift its head high. Plenty, and carp floods and the rain which brings forth dappled barley were then increased in Unug Kulaba. Before the land of Dilmun yet existed, the E-ana of Unug Kulaba was well founded.\\" E-ana was a temple in Uruk built in honour of the goddess Inanna, the \\"lady of all the lands\\"-(E-ana is 'house of An', or 'Temple of An'). Similarly, the lord of Aratta has himself crowned in Inanna's name, but she does not find this as pleasing as her brick temple in Uruk. Enmerkar, thus \\"chosen by Inanna in her holy heart from the bright mountain\\", then asks Inanna to let him subject Aratta and make the people of Aratta deliver a tribute of precious metals and gemstones, for constructing the lofty Abzu temple of Enki at Eridu, as well as for embellishing her own E-ana sanctuary at Uruk. Inanna accordingly advises Enmerkar to dispatch a herald across the mountains of Susin and Anshan to the lord of Aratta, to demand his submission and his tribute. Places mentioned in the Enmerkar Epics Enmerkar agrees and sends the envoy, along with his specific threats to destroy Aratta and disperse its people, if they do not send him the tribute - \\"lest like the devastation which swept destructively, and in whose wake Inanna arose, shrieked and yelled aloud, I too wreak a sweeping devastation there.\\" He is furthermore to recite the \\"Incantation of Nudimmud\\", a hymn imploring Enki to restore (or in some translations, to disrupt) the linguistic unity of the inhabited regions, named as Shubur, Hamazi, Sumer, Uri-ki (the region around Akkad), and the Martu land: > \\"On that day when there is no snake, when there is no scorpion, when there > is no hyena, when there is no lion, when there is neither dog nor wolf, when > there is thus neither fear nor trembling, man has no rival! At such a time, > may the lands of Shubur and Hamazi, the many-tongued, and Sumer, the great > mountain of the me of magnificence, and Akkad, the land possessing all that > is befitting, and the Martu land, resting in security -- the whole universe, > the well-guarded people -- may they all address Enlil together in a single > language! For at that time, for the ambitious lords, for the ambitious > princes, for the ambitious kings -- Enki, the lord of abundance and of > steadfast decisions, the wise and knowing lord of the Land, the expert of > the gods, chosen for wisdom, the lord of Eridug, shall change the speech in > their mouths, as many as he had placed there, and so the speech of mankind > is truly one.\\"The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature The messenger arrives in Aratta, reciting this message to the king, and asks him for a reply to take to his lord Enmerkar, whom he calls \\"the scion of him with the glistening beard, whom his stalwart cow gave birth to in the mountain of the shining me, who was reared on the soil of Aratta, who was given suck at the udder of the good cow, who is suited for office in Kulaba.\\" The king of Aratta replies that submission to Uruk is out of the question, because Inanna herself had chosen him to his office and power. But the herald then reveals that Inanna has been installed as queen at E-ana and has even promised Enmerkar to make Aratta bow to Uruk. Devastated by this news, the lord of Aratta finally gives his response: he is more than prepared for a military contest with Uruk, whom he considers no match for his might; however he will submit, on the sole conditions that Enmerkar send him a vast amount of barley grain, and that Inanna convince him that she has forsaken Aratta and confirm her allegiance to Uruk. The herald returns to Enmerkar bearing this reply, and the next day Enmerkar actually sends the barley to Aratta, along with the herald and another demand to send even more precious stones. The lord of Aratta, in a fit of pride, refuses and instead asks Enmerkar to deliver to him these precious stones himself. Upon hearing this, Enmerkar spends ten years preparing an ornate sceptre, then sends it to Aratta with his messenger. This frightens the lord of Aratta, who now sees that Inanna has indeed forsaken him, but he instead proposes to arrange a one-on-one combat between two champions of the two cities, to determine the outcome of the still-diplomatic conflict with Enmerkar. The king of Uruk responds by accepting this challenge, while increasing his demands for the people of Aratta to make a significant offering for the E-ana and the abzu, or face destruction and dispersal. To relieve the herald who, beleaguered, can no longer remember all the messages with which he is charged, Enmerkar then resorts to an invention: writing on tablets. The herald again traverses the \\"seven mountains\\" to Aratta, with the tablets, and when the king of Aratta tries to read the message, Ishkur, the storm-god, causes a great rain to produce wild wheat and chickpeas that are then brought to the king. Seeing this, the king declares that Inanna has not forsaken the primacy of Aratta after all, and summons his champion. The remainder of the text has many lacunae- (line text losses), and the following events are unclear, but the tablet seems to end with Enmerkar triumphant, possibly installed by Inanna on the throne of Aratta, and with the people of Aratta delivering the tribute to E-ana, and providing the materials to build the Apsû. A sequel text, Enmerkar and En-suhgir-ana, seems to continue the epic.

The spectral element method was introduced in a 1984 paper by A. T. Patera. Although Patera is credited with development of the method, his work was a rediscovery of an existing method (see Development History)  Discussion  The spectral method expands the solution in trigonometric series, a chief advantage being that the resulting method is of very high order. This approach relies on the fact that trigonometric polynomials are an orthonormal basis for L^2(\\\\Omega) . The spectral element method chooses instead a high degree piecewise polynomial basis functions, also achieving a very high order of accuracy. Such polynomials are usually orthogonal Chebyshev polynomials or very high order Legendre polynomials over non-uniformly spaced nodes. In SEM computational error decreases exponentially as the order of approximating polynomial, therefore a fast convergence of solution to the exact solution is realized with fewer degrees of freedom of the structure in comparison with FEM. In structural health monitoring, FEM can be used for detecting large flaws in a structure, but as the size of the flaw is reduced there is a need to use a high frequency wave with a small wavelength. Therefore, the FEM mesh must be much finer, resulting in increased computational time and an inexact solution. SEM, with fewer degrees of freedom per node, can be useful for detecting small flaws. Non-uniformity of nodes helps to make the mass matrix diagonal, which saves time and memory and is also useful for adopting a central difference method (CDM). The disadvantages of SEM include difficulty in modeling complex geometry, compared to the flexibility of FEM. Although the method can be applied with a modal piecewise orthogonal polynomial basis, it is most often implemented with a nodal tensor product Lagrange basisKarniadakis, G. and Sherwin, S.: Spectral/hp Element Methods for Computational Fluid Dynamics, Oxford Univ. Press, (2013), . The method gains its efficiency by placing the nodal points at the Legendre-Gauss- Lobatto (LGL) points and performing the Galerkin method integrations with a reduced Gauss-Lobatto quadrature using the same nodes. With this combination, simplifications result such that mass lumping occurs at all nodes and a collocation procedure results at interior points. The most popular applications of the method are in computational fluid dynamics and modeling seismic wave propagationKomatitsch, D. and Villote, J.-P.: “The Spectral Element Method: An Efficient Tool to Simulate the Seismic Response of 2D and 3D Geologic Structures,” Bull. Seismological Soc. America, 88, 2, 368-392 (1998).  A-priori error estimate  The classic analysis of Galerkin methods and Céa's lemma holds here and it can be shown that, if u is the solution of the weak equation, uN is the approximate solution and u \\\\in H^{s+1}(\\\\Omega): :\\\\u-u_N\\\\_{H^1(\\\\Omega)} \\\\leqq C_s N^{-s} \\\\ u \\\\_{H^{s+1}(\\\\Omega)} where C is independent from N and s is no larger than the degree of the piecewise polynomial basis. As we increase N, we can also increase the degree of the basis functions. In this case, if u is an analytic function: :\\\\u-u_N\\\\_{H^1(\\\\Omega)} \\\\leqq C \\\\exp( - \\\\gamma N ) where \\\\gamma depends only on u.

J. 21(1) 115-128, (Feb. 1981), paper SPE 7413 presented Oct. 1978, doi.org/10.2118/7413-PA is identical to SEM, while the HCGM is equivalent to these methods. This earlier work is ignored in the spectral literature.  Related methods  * G-NI or SEM-NI are the most used spectral methods. The Galerkin formulation of spectral methods or spectral element methods, for G-NI or SEM-NI respectively, is modified and Gauss- Lobatto integration is used instead of integrals in the definition of the bilinear form a(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot) and in the functional F. Their convergence is a consequence of Strang's lemma. *SEM is a Galerkin based FEM (finite element method) with Lagrange basis (shape) functions and reduced numerical integration by Lobatto quadrature using the same nodes. *The pseudospectral method, orthogonal collocation, differential quadrature method, and G-NI are different names for the same method. These methods employ global rather than piecewise polynomial basis functions. The extension to a piecewise FEM or SEM basis is almost trivial. * The spectral element method uses a tensor product space spanned by nodal basis functions associated with Gauss-Lobatto points. In contrast, the p-version finite element method spans a space of high order polynomials by nodeless basis functions, chosen approximately orthogonal for numerical stability. Since not all interior basis functions need to be present, the p-version finite element method can create a space that contains all polynomials up to a given degree with fewer degrees of freedom.Barna Szabó and Ivo Babuška, Finite element analysis, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1991. However, some speedup techniques possible in spectral methods due to their tensor-product character are no longer available. The name p-version means that accuracy is increased by increasing the order of the approximating polynomials (thus, p) rather than decreasing the mesh size, h. * The hp finite element method (hp-FEM) combines the advantages of the h and p refinements to obtain exponential convergence rates.P.

The vast majority of the players, come from surrounding rugby union clubs, wishing to maintain fitness and enhance skill levels over the summer off-season. History Cambridge City Tigers were formed in 1987 and played their first game against Peterborough on 21 February 1988 which was won 34-28. The club applied to the London League and played the 88/89 season in Division 2, winning 2 games all season and finishing bottom but the increasing interest and standards meant that in the 89/90 season Tigers won the second division and promotion to the first. After the 1990/91 season the Chairman of Cambridge City Tigers decide to break away and form his own club - Cambridge Eagles, the players who were not invited to play for the new club, formed Cambridge Tigers. The new Cambridge Eagles team, based around forces players, continued to play in the London League. Cambridge Eagles missed out at the first stage of applications to the new Southern Conference in 1997. However, Reading Raiders announced that they would remain in the London League. Thus Cambridge were offered their place. Cambridge joined the Eastern Division where they have played ever since. The club's previous home was at Cantabs Rugby Union ground on Long Road in Cambridge. It was decided in 2008 to move the team permanently to Sawston. After a bumpy and difficult start to the season Cambridge Eagles folded. With immediate effect the Eagles were withdrawn from the RLC East and are barred from joining again in the 2010 season.

We say that f factors through h. A basic example in topology is lifting a path in one topological space to a path in a covering space. For example, consider mapping opposite points on a sphere to the same point, a continuous map from the sphere covering the projective plane. A path in the projective plane is a continuous map from the unit interval [0,1]. We can lift such a path to the sphere by choosing one of the two sphere points mapping to the first point on the path, then maintain continuity. In this case, each of the two starting points forces a unique path on the sphere, the lift of the path in the projective plane. Thus in the category of topological spaces with continuous maps as morphisms, we have :\\\\begin{align} f\\\\colon\\\\, &[0,1] \\\\to \\\\mathbb{RP}^2 &\\\\quad&\\\\text{(projective plane path)}  g\\\\colon\\\\, &S;^2 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{RP}^2 &\\\\quad&\\\\text{(covering map)}  h\\\\colon\\\\, &[0,1] \\\\to S^2 &\\\\quad&\\\\text{(sphere path)} \\\\end{align} Lifts are ubiquitous; for example, the definition of fibrations (see homotopy lifting property) and the valuative criteria of separated and proper maps of schemes are formulated in terms of existence and (in the last case) uniqueness of certain lifts. In algebraic topology and homological algebra, tensor product and the Hom functor are adjoint; however, they might not always lift to an exact sequence. This leads to the definition of the Ext functor and the Tor functor. Algebraic logic The notations of first order predicate logic are streamlined when quantifiers are relegated to established domains and ranges of binary relations. Gunther Schmidt and Michael Winter have illustrated the method of lifting traditional logical expressions of topology to calculus of relations in their book Relational Topology.Gunther Schmidt and Michael Winter (2018): Relational Topology, page 2 to 5, Lecture Notes in Mathematics vol. 2208, Springer books, They aim \\"to lift concepts to a relational level making them point free as well as quantifier free, thus liberating them from the style of first order predicate logic and approaching the clarity of algebraic reasoning.\\" For example, a partial function M corresponds to the inclusion M^T ; M \\\\subseteq I where I denotes the identity relation on the range of M. \\"The notation for quantification is hidden and stays deeply incorporated in the typing of the relational operations (here transposition and composition) and their rules.\\"  See also  * Covering space * Projective module * Formally smooth map satisfies an infinitesimal lifting property. * Monsky-Washnitzer cohomology lifts p-adic varieties to characteristic zero. * SBI ring allows idempotents to be lifted above the Jacobson radical. * Ikeda lift * Miyawaki lift of Siegel modular forms * Saito-Kurokawa lift of modular forms * Rotation number uses a lift of a homeomorphim of the circle to the real line. * Arithmetic geometry: Andrew Wiles (1995) modularity lifting * Hensel's lemma * Monad (functional programming) uses map functional to lift simple operators to monadic form. * Tangent bundle#Lifts References Category:Category theory ","title":"Lift (mathematics)"},{"id":"10504574","text":"The AN/SPS-55 is a solid state surface search and navigation radar. It was developed by Cardion Electronics for the U.S. Navy under a contract awarded in 1971. It was originally developed for a class of ships known as Patrol Frigates, but it was also installed on numerous Cruisers, Destroyers and Minesweepers. It is an I band radar and its antenna consists of two waveguide slotted arrays mounted back-to-back. One array provides linear polarisation and the other provides circular polarisation. Polarisation is user selectable and the circular polarised array is more effective in reducing returns from precipitation.Electronics Technician Vol 7 - AN/SPS-55 Features * Magnetron transmitter * Low noise RF receiver * Sensitivity time control * Fast time constant filtering * Sector radiate The effective range of the radar is from 50 feet to beyond 50 miles. It is primarily used to detect other ships, coastlines and navigation hazards. The \\"Sensitivity Time Control\\" automatically adjusts the gain of the RF receiver from low to high based on the time elapsed from the last transmitter pulse. This helps to adjust for the fact that near by targets generate a larger return than distant targets of the same size. The \\"Fast Time Constant Filtering\\" helps to remove targets which have a very large range size, like clouds, while passing targets with a smaller range size, like ships or aircraft. The \\"Sector Radiate\\" allows the operator to turn off the transmitter for any sized pie shaped sector of the antenna's 360 degree rotation. An operator might want to do this to avoid detection by an enemy receiver which lies within a known or suspected location. The installation of Field Change 13 disabled the antenna's circular polarisation feature. Field Change 13 was necessary to address reliability issues associated with the replacement version of the waveguide switch used for polarisation selection.

It starts off at James Street North and works its way East and ends at Sherman Avenue North. The section between James Street and Ferguson Avenue was a one-way road, but was converted to a two-way street at 10 am on December 10, 2010. History There are two streets in Hamilton, Ontario named Wilson Street, one in downtown Hamilton and the other in Ancaster. In 2001 when Amalgamation took place Ancaster joined up and became a part of the new Hamilton along with the towns of Dundas, Flamborough, Glanbrook and Stoney Creek. The name of the main road that cuts through Ancaster is also named Wilson Street. Originally, Wilson Street in downtown Hamilton was part an Indian Trail. Other city roads that were Indian Trails include, York Boulevard and King Street in the Lower City plus Concession Street and Mohawk Road on the Hamilton mountain. Sonic Unyon Records Wilson Medical Centre Wilson Street in Hamilton between James Street and Mary Street was originally called Gore Street after the District of Gore. Wilson Street was named after Hugh B. Wilson, a local landowner who opened a survey on the street. Sonic Unyon Recording Company, is a Hamilton, Ontario-based record label, (Wilson Street near James Street North), that has put out releases by bands including Tristan Psionic, Sianspheric, Shallow North Dakota, Eric's Trip, Hayden, the New Grand, Frank Black and the Catholics, A Northern Chorus and Raising the Fawn. Founded in 1992 by Mark Milne, Sandy McIntosh and Tim Potocic (of Tristan Psionic), Sonic Unyon is one of the largest independent labels in Canada.  Time capsule  A Time capsule was buried beneath a marker on the north-east corner of James & Wilson Streets on Wednesday November 16, 1988 by the Jamesville Business Community under the aegis of the City's Business Improvement Area (B.I.A.) Programme. It commemorates the completion of the James Street North streetscape project (1986–1988) which marked the renaissance of this historic link between the Hamilton Harbour and the City Centre. James Street has always been the focal point for new Canadians arriving in Hamilton, first by ship from overseas docking at the foot of James Street later by train at the CN Railway Station. The first arrivals were English, Scottish and Irish; later came Italian and German; more recently Portuguese and then Greek. All in their turn have added to the cultural richness of the street. The Capsule is to be opened on Tuesday, November 16, 2038 by the Mayor, Alderman and Business Leaders of James Street North on that day. Those that were in attendance in 1988 when the time capsule was buried include Bob Morrow (Mayor), Sidney H.

Background In 1867 Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins collaborated to produce a stage play titled No Thoroughfare: A Drama: In Five Acts.No Thoroughfare The two had previously collaborated on the play The Frozen Deep. This was the last stage production to be associated with Dickens, who died in June 1870. The play opened at the Adelphi Theatre on 26 December 1867. No Thoroughfare by Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins. Left to right: Joey Ladle (Benjamin Webster), Sally Goldstraw (Mrs. Alfred Mellon), George Vendale (Henry G. Neville), Jules Obenreizer (Charles Albert Fechter), Marguerite (Carlotta Leclercq), Walter Wilding (John Billington), and Bintrey (George G. Belmore). The novel No Thoroughfare was also first published in 1867, in the Christmas number of Dickens's periodical All The Year Round. There are thematic parallels with other books from Dickens's mature writings, including Little Dorrit (1857) and especially Our Mutual Friend (1865). The publication of the story in All The Year Round represents an early example of commercial merchandising, promoting the story to those who were aware of the stage play, and the play to those who had read the book. The chapters of the book are referred to as 'acts', and match the acts of the play. In the book Collins assisted in Act 1 and Act 4;A Comprehensive List of Dickens's Short Fiction, 1833–1868 Collins scripted most of the stage play with Dickens's assistance.No Thoroughfare [correct first edition] The novel The story contains crafted descriptions, well-drawn and diverse characters, eerie and exotic backgrounds, mystery, semi-concealed identities, brinkmanship with death, romance, the eventual triumph of Good over Evil, and many other elements expected in classic Dickens. At 48,000 words it is the length of many modern novels. Plot summary Two boys from the Foundling Hospital are given the same name, (Walter Wilding), with disastrous consequences in adulthood. After the death of one – now a proprietor of a wine merchant's company – the executors, to right the wrong, are commissioned to find a missing heir. Their quest takes them from wine cellars in the City of London to the sunshine of the Mediterranean – across the Alps in winter. Danger and treachery would prevail were it not for the courage of the heroine, Marguerite, and a faithful company servant. The stage play The stage play follows a similar plotline, but is compressed and made particularly dramatic in the fourth act, which is set in the Swiss Alps. The tension builds to a spectacular scene in which Obenreizer, the villain, confronts the hero George Vendale, at the side of a mountain gorge. It has been performed rarely since the 1867 West End premiere, in 1876 at the Olympic TheatreGasson, Andrew. \\"No Thoroughfare\\", Wilkie Collins Information Pages, accessed 1 April 2020 and in 1904 at a small theatre in Islington.

His political activity extended from the Republic of Pisa to Sardinia. Anselm was the son of Berthold, brother of William and Anselm, all three of whom went to the court of Peter II of Arborea to be educated. Anselm's mother was a daughter of Guelfo della Gherardesca, Count of Donoratico, and Uguccionella degli Uppezinghi. Anselm was sent by the Commune of Pisa in 1273 to Gallura to fight against the judge Giovanni Visconti, who had fled from Pisa recently. He defeated him in the hard-to- defend open plain between Trexenta and Gippi. Anselm occupied the Visconti estates, but it is not known if only those in the curatoria of Gippi or those in the third of Cagliari which Giovanni had acquired as well. However, Giovanni evaded capture and returned to Tuscany on a Sicilian ship. Anselm took over the reins of government in the Giudicato of Arborea after the imprisonment and assassination of his cousin Nicholas by the real judge, Marianus II. He attacked Marianus and tried to take over Cagliari, but was defeated and killed in 1287. Anselm was married to Teccia, daughter of Gherardo della Gherardesca and Theodora, and niece of Ugolino. He left one son, Anselm, who was reputed to be chivalrous and gracious. On account of jealousy for the affection of the Pisan populace, Ugolino had him poisoned. Ugolino may have even feared that the Pisans would choose to replace him with Anselm. This story is the basis for the passing mention of Anselm in Dante's Inferno (where Anselm is not resident, but Ugolino is). Sources *Pinna, Raimondo.

Biography =Early life= Clara Fraser was born to Jewish immigrant parents in multi-ethnic, working class East Los Angeles. Her father, Samuel Goodman, was a Teamster. Her mother, Emma Goodman, was a garment worker and later a Business Agent of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. Fraser joined the Socialist Party's youth group in junior high school. By 1945, after graduating from the University of California, Los Angeles with a degree in literature and education, Fraser was a recruit to the ideas of Leon Trotsky, whose campaign against Stalinism had gained adherents worldwide. She joined the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party (SWP) that year. In 1946, she moved to the Pacific Northwest to help build the SWP's Seattle branch. As an assembly line electrician, Fraser joined the Boeing Strike of 1948. When the union was slapped with an anti-picketing injunction, she put together a mothers' brigade to walk the line with baby strollers. After the strike, Boeing fired and blacklisted Fraser, and the FBI pursued her for a decade. In the 1950s and 1960s, Fraser stayed active in the labor arena, worked to end segregation, advocated for women, and opposed the Vietnam War. She worked with her then-husband, Richard S. Fraser, in developing Revolutionary Integration, which explains the interdependence of the struggles for socialism and African American freedom and argues the key importance of black leadership to the U.S. working class.http://www.redletterpress.org Revolutionary Integration: A Marxist Analysis of African American Liberation The SWP, however, was supporting the Nation of Islam. The Seattle local conducted a long campaign to try to win the national party to its perspective. A clampdown on internal party democracy brought this effort to a dead end. Fraser co-authored the branch's critique of the SWP's political and organizational degeneration in a series of documents that have been re-published under the title Crisis and Leadership (Seattle: Red Letter Press, 2000). =Socialist feminist leadership= The Seattle branch left the SWP in 1966 and launched the Freedom Socialist Party, founded on a program emphasizing the leadership role of the underprivileged in achieving progress for all of humanity. In 1967, Fraser formed Radical Women (RW), along with Gloria Martin and young women of the New Left. RW's ambition was to teach women leadership and theoretical skills and class consciousness. In 1973, Fraser began work at Seattle City Light, a publicly owned utility. As Training and Education Coordinator, she was charged with implementing a program to hire and train female electrical workers. Fired in 1974, Fraser immediately filed a discrimination complaint that documented pervasive political bias and sexism. After a seven-year battle, Fraser was victorious in a ruling that affirmed the right of workers to speak out against management and to organize on their own behalf. She returned to her former job at City Light just as a new furor broke out over discrimination against women in non-traditional trades. Fraser joined with women in the field and the offices and pro-affirmative action men to form a new organization to combat sex and race discrimination: the Employee Committee for Equal Rights at City Light (CERCL). In 1984, an ex-FSP member named Richard Snedigar brought a harassment lawsuit against Fraser, seven other party leaders, and the organization as a whole. This case came to be known as the Freeway Hall Case. Snedigar wanted to take back a substantial donation given years before to a fund for obtaining a new headquarters after the party was evicted from its homebase at Freeway Hall. He also demanded FSP minutes, membership lists, and names of contributors. At one point, Fraser and the party's attorneys were sentenced to jail for refusing to divulge financial information, but their sentences were stayed and ultimately overturned. The FSP pursued this case to the state Supreme Court, where civil liberties attorney Leonard Boudin argued that privacy rights are essential to the freedom to express dissent. The FSP was finally vindicated in 1992. Clara Fraser had two sons. =Philosophy and political thought= Clara Fraser had emphasized that a feminism focused only on feminism would be insufficient, and thought that ultimately, it wouldn't realize its own goals. As she said, \\"the logic of feminism is to expand inexorably into a more generalized radicalism.\\" The oppression of different sexes, classes, and so on all depend upon each other, and so, focusing on any single issue would be a detriment to the others. In the case of feminism, \\"single-issue feminism\\" would inevitably be dominated by white, upper-class women, who would think that they're representing all women. There are many quotes throughout her writing that express this view: \\"The single- issue is the dead-end issue. It always ends up smack against the wall. True, it is large, but it is also, invariably, diffuse, ambiguous, contradictory, deceptive and mercurial... It moves to the right, not to the left, and it moves radicals along with it.\\" \\"Without [socialist feminist] leadership, the women's movement, like every other movement, will petrify, corrode, adapt and drown inside the Democratic Party or inane, single-issue liberalism. Or it will adopt an ultra-left, insanely sectarian and/or terroristic stance, born of desperation and bitterness.\\" Clara Fraser expresses many of her views in her book Revolution, She Wrote. In her paper \\"How Marxists Think\\", she expresses a disdain for classical logic. In her summary of Aristotle, Aristotle had contributed three laws to formal logic: # \\"A\\" equals A: the law of identity. A thing is always equal to itself. # \\"A\\" cannot be non-A: the law of contradiction. # \\"A\\" cannot be both A and non-A: the law of the excluded. Fraser cites five critiques of these laws: # These laws are only true if one assumes the world is something fixed and unchanged. Nothing moves and develops, because motion implies self-contradiction. As she says, \\"Does a dollar always equal a dollar? Hardly.\\" # Formal logic creates impassable barriers between things, but in reality, everything grows out of and into other things: paper into money, and money into paper again; rivers into seas and seas into clouds; bacteria into animals and animals into humans. # A can equal not a; formal logic has too rigid a view of identity. The working class for example, is a heterogenous and contradictory mass. In her words, \\"a worker is not a boss, but can think and act like one.\\" # These laws present themselves as absolute, final, and eternal. But in reality, everything is relative, inter-dependent and changing, and as a consequence, so are the laws of governing them. # The laws of formal logic cannot explain themselves; they cannot account for their own origin or cause of being. This is where Hegel and Marx come in for Fraser. Fraser states that Hegel had realized these flaws and developed a logic which had taken motion and change into account, but was still plagued by a kind of idealism, a privileging of non-material substances (such as the Absolute Spirit) over material conditions. This is where Marx \\"fixes\\" Hegel, seeing changing rooted in the natural conditions of a society. Fraser states that all science is the study of the motion and behavior that matter, and Marxism is simply the study of human motion and social behavior.

It lies south of Fairlie, adjacent to Hunterston estate, site of Hunterston Castle, and its jetty projects out approximately , about midway into the channel between the mainland and the island of Great Cumbrae. The port, completed in 1979, was originally called Hunterston Ore Terminal and was intended to handle iron ore for British Steel Corporation's Ravenscraig steelworks. Existing facilities at General Terminus Quay on the upper River Clyde were unsuitable for increasingly large vessels, but Hunterston, with its jetty, is able to handle modern ships of any size. History The new port at Hunterston replaced facilities at General Terminus Quay (now Springfield Quay), on the River Clyde, near the centre of Glasgow.Campbell, R.H. Iron and Steel. Chapter 5 in: Cunnison and Gilfillan (1958). These facilities had been designed in the early 1950s to allow the simultaneous unloading of two large ships carrying bulk iron ore. The ships were designed to carry 12,000 tons (12,200 metric tonnes) of iron ore.Sleeman (1958). The Present System: The Port of Glasgow To-day. In Chapter 10 of: Cunnison & Gilfillan (1958). Iron ore was to be transported, in railway waggons, via the General Terminus and Glasgow Harbour Railway, from the General Terminus Quay to the new Ravenscraig steelworks which opened in the late 1950s. Facilities at Hunterston Terminal At the end of the jetty, the bulk carrier Alpha Era has unloaded coal At Hunterston Terminal, an overhead conveyor linked to two gantry cranes carries coal to a railhead on the Ayrshire Coast Line railway. Clydeport claim an unloading rate of 2800 tonnes of coal per hour. The conveyor is also linked to a ship loader which loads coal into smaller ships on the inner berth; this coal is transported to Manchester and Belfast amongst other places. Among other users, coal from Hunterston Terminal supplied Drax power station in Yorkshire and was used at Longannet power station in Fife until its closure in 2016. The need to link to Longannet was a major reason for the reopening of the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine rail link, although this only served the plant for its last eight years. The site is currently under demolition with both unloaders expected to be removed imminently.

He is the Chief Rabbi of the Czech Republic, and former Chief Rabbi of the city of Prague. Life Born in Prague during the war, Karol Sidon is a distant relative of rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld. His father Alexander Sidon came from Trnava, where his great-uncle Shimon Sidon was the first rabbi after a long expulsion of Jews from the city. Alexander was arrested in 1944 and imprisoned by the Gestapo in Pankrác and in Terezin, where he was tortured to death in the same year. Karol was then hidden away in the country until the end of the occupation. His mother raised him alone until 1948 when she remarried a Jew. He began studying at the Academy of Musical Art in Prague in 1960 where he began writing film scripts, and radio plays for Czech public radio - Český rozhlas. Until 1968 he worked as a producer for Czech puppeteer Jiří Trnka. In the same year, Sidon's first book, which became a cult book \\"Sen o mém otci\\" (\\"Dream about my father\\") was published, in which the author deals with his being brought up without his Jewish father Alexander Sidon, who perished in the Terezín ghetto (his wife was a Christian). In 1977 he was a signatory to Charter 77. He received the Jiří Kolář prize in 1978. He was married to Marcela Třebická, he is the father of the actors Daniel Sidon and Magdalena Sidonová. In 1983 he emigrated to West Germany and he studied Jewish studies at the Heidelberg university. He became ordained as a Rabbi after studying for a time in Israel. He returned to the Czech Republic in 1992, where he became chief rabbi of Prague. Rabbi Sidon restored the Jewish Orthodox community. To help get invited many young rabbinical families from Israel. He founded the Lauder School (elementary school named Gur Aryeh and a grammar school named Or Chadash), the construction of a mikveh, the establishment of a bet midrash Tiferet Uzi (named after his teacher Uzi Kalchheim), Beit Din or kosher shop and Certificates. =Community tensions in Prague= In 2004 and 2005, Sidon and his supporters had a conflict with city of Prague's Jewish Community Council. This led to Sidon's brief ouster as Chief Rabbi of the city and of his position as rabbi of the city's landmark Altneuschul. It did not affect his status as Rabbi of the Czech Republic, as he retained support of the Federation of Jewish Communities. In April, 2004, a coalition headed by Tomáš Jelínek succeeded in installing new leadership of the Prague community. Their goal was to change the way the community worked, being more open to less traditional Jews. In June, in a controversial move, they ousted Sidon from his position as head of the community and its main synagogue, the Altneuschul. Jelinek explained that Sidon failed to fulfill his duties properly, but Sidon and the Roth group countered that the move was politically motivated, and an attempt to change the Orthodox nature of the community's practices. The council appointed the local Chabad rabbi, an American named Manis Barash, to lead the synagogue, with other communal rabbinic duties split between Barash and two other local rabbis. Sidon took Jelinek to an Israeli rabbinical court. It ruled that Barash should continue to head the synagogue, but Sidon claimed that Jelinek gave false testimony, negating the ruling.'Little Jerusalem' shul battle heats up, Lev Krichevsky, Jerusalem Post, April 13, 2005 Others in the community ran a grassroots campaign called Community for All, to remove the new leadership, over several dismissals and violation of privacy. A general assembly vote succeeded in November, replacing Jelinek and his group with another group, led by Jakub Roth. Jelinek refused to leave the office; he and others barricaded themselves in the offices, with hired bodyguards. The ouster was confirmed by another vote on December 20. The second vote's validity was contested by Jelinek's group, but the national Federation of Jewish Communities recognized and accepted it in January 2005. Barash continued to lead the synagogue. Deputy chairman of the community Jakub Roth told the press: \\"this is part of the local Chabad's striving to take over the community's religious life. We have seen an ugly foray of Chabad in their attempt to take over the Old-New synagogue.\\" On April 15, 2005 the two factions brawled, when Sidon was offered an honor at the synagogue's Sabbath services, by the gabbai Jacob Svab. The synagogue in the ancient Jewish Quarter became the scene of an emotional dispute between members of the Chabad movement and followers of Sidon, who had moved his services to the High Synagogue.Jewish conflict turns violent: Community, Chabad vie to control Prague's Old-New Synagogue, Dinah A. Spritzer, The Prague Post, April 21, 2005 Tensions were finally resolved toward the end of the year, with all sides agreeing to new elections. The Community for All platform won three-quarters of the vote on December 8, while Jelinek's Coalition for a Democratic Community secured three seats on the board. The last three seats went to community members who did not join either group Sidon was promptly restored to his position the next day.

In his autobiography he wrote of his status in the community prior to the uncovering of the embezzlement. > \\"Once my story was written up in magazines as a story of success. It told of > a farm boy who came to the city, and by industry and honesty had carved his > way to a position of trust and integrity. It told of the leader in the > community, the teacher in the Sunday school, of the man who was consulted in > every business enterprise. It told of the man who was welcome guest of > industrial executives of the state. Governors and high officials were glad > to sit at my table.\\" Thomson was first employed at the Hormel Packing Plant as a scaler in the fresh meat department at $12 per week. In the spring of 1907 he asked Mr. George Hormel for a more responsible job. Hormel suggested that he get training in bookkeeping and accounting. He took a course at Mankato and was reemployed with Hormel. Two years later he was promoted to the position of cashier. First theft Early in 1911 Cy committed his first theft from the company. A Mrs. Mary Hollinghead from South Dakota mailed in $800 in currency for the purchase of shares of stock. The stock was issued immediately, but the money was placed in transit. It was still in transit 10 years later when the crash came. Investing Thomson began to invest in various ventures such as his poultry farm in Le Roy. \\"Affairs were moving rapidly for me during this period and I purchased the entire D.W. Young poultry stock and equipment from New York state, including a $10,000 rooster, winner of a long string of prizes at the Madison Square Garden.\\" Cy then branched into the dairy business with a farm between Lansing and Blooming Prairie. Demise On Saturday, July 9, 1921, Cy Thomson's embezzlement was uncovered. He recalls the event in his autobiography. > \\"I knew before I started from my desk. The call came from Hormel's office > following a mail controversy with a Boston bank. I knew instinctively before > I saw Mr. Hormel's grave face and the accusing eyes of his directors. The > exposure which I had been fighting for ten years was at hand.\\" \\"My first > remark when I entered the room was, 'Gentlemen it's all over, the jig is > up.' An hour later I went to the company's general journal with one of the > Hormel officials and made the last entry I was ever to make on the Hormel > books. It was an entry charging R.J. Thomson with $1,187,000 and crediting > the various banks where the shortages existed.\\" Thomson was jailed on Monday, July 18. Legacy Cy Thomson was one of the most public spirited citizens in Austin during the years immediately preceding 1921. He provided cigars to the young men leaving for wartime service. If a local civic event needed something extra to make it a success it was Cy Thomson who would find and provide it. His money for benevolences seemed inexhaustible. After the scandal, the Austin Daily Herald wrote > \\"Cy Thomson has been the mystery man of Austin. Everyone has asked where Cy > got his money. There is great regret and sorrow at his downfall, for he had > endeared himself to the whole community by his public spirit and > generosity.\\" A few days later the mood had changed. The Herald said, > \\"Cy Thomson knew that a crash of the Hormel Company would be disastrous to > Austin.

Kang defeated Shariff by 98 votes after returns in the advanced polls showed he had won overwhelming victories. Kang's numbers increased upon the official recount to 118 votes. Shariff and the Progressive Conservatives have challenged the vote in court claiming that the results of the advanced polling and special ballots was tainted.

Matz lived in the Austro- Hungarian Empire in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. He was born in Zagreb, 1901 and died in that same city in 1988. He was an important figure in the musical life of Zagreb in the 20th century. In addition to working as a composer, he was a cellist, teacher, conductor and choirmaster. He worked in music for more than six decades – from 1920 right up to his death. He performed with eminent professional musicians as well as with skilled amateurs. His wife Margita was a pianist, harpsichordist and keyboard teacher. Career Leonard Rose called Matz, \\"perhaps the greatest cello theoretician in the world.\\" Janos Starker said, \\"Rudolph Matz's dedication and expertise has produced much needed material for the young cellist.\\" Matz studied violoncello, composition and conducting at the Zagreb Academy of Music, from which he graduated in 1926. He became Professor of Cello at the Zagreb Music Academy (1940/41 and 1950 until his retirement in 1972), achieving international renown for his cello-teaching methods, which he brought together in a compendium entitled 'First Years of the Cello' in 32 volumes (1948-1962). He would be invited to take part in the work of juries in cello competitions, in Moscow and Florence. Rudolf and Margita Matz donated their long-time home in the second floor flat at 15 Mesnicka Street to Zagreb City Museum, together with their invaluable effects. The Margita and Rudolf Matz Memorial Collection will be set up in the apartment, once famed for its encounters with musicians and its intimate concerts (in 1967, for instance, Matz was visited here by celebrated cellist Mstislav Rostropovich).

She had been portrayed by Denise Wanner for one month (November to December 1986) before Judi Evans took over the role from December 1986 to February 1991, from May 2007 to January 2008, and again from March 2010 to January 2020. Casting and characterization The role was initially played by Denise Wanner, as a mysterious character whose face wasn't seen onscreen until Judi Evans joined DAYS in 1986 after a widely popular run on the CBS soap opera Guiding Light, where she played Beth Raines from 1983–1986. Her run on the NBC soap opera centered on her battles with childhood abuse and her relationship with Justin Kiriakis, played by Wally Kurth. After she left the show in 1991, she joined Another World that year as Paulina Cory Carlino until the show ended in 1999. After a short break from daytime, she returned to DAYS in 2003 as an entirely different character, Bonnie Lockhart and remained in the role until 2007 when she was immediately brought back as Adrienne from 2007-2008 and then since 2010. In between her second and third runs on DAYS, Evans joined the cast of the CBS soap opera As the World Turns as Maeve Stone in 2009. The role lasted for several months and followed her almost- relationship with Holden Snyder, played by Jon Hensley. Evans' casting on ATWT coincided with Kurth's return to DAYS, ending plans for a Justin and Adrienne reunion but she eventually returned a year later. At the time of her 2010 return, Evans spoke to the Sony Pictures Days of our Lives website about her character's onscreen reunion with Justin and their struggling marriage. > \\"...The way they wrote the characters...they really matured them, they > really caught the gist of what their relationship had been as opposed to > what it is now. Wally and I kept marveling at how wonderful the writing is. > And true to form, true to life, true to the characters.\\" —Judi Evans, Sony > Pictures/Days of our Lives In February 2015, nearly five years since her return Evans has been upgraded to contract status alongside Wally Kurth and Mary Beth Evans. In December 2015, Evans and Kurth were downgraded back to recurring status. Evans exited the role on January 24, 2020.

Early life Henry M. Elmore was from one of the oldest families in the South, his first American ancestor having arrived in Virginia in 1647. As was common in the new world, Elmore's ancestors moved West and South with each new generation. Henry M. Elmore was born in Laurens County, South Carolina, and moved with his father, General John Archer Elmore (who fought in the American Revolution), to what is now Elmore County, Alabama. Following the advice of his brother who served in the Mexican–American War, Henry Marshall Elmore moved his own family to Texas in 1853. Although this brother Physic Rush Elmore suggested that he not settle until he was West of the Texan Colorado River, Henry M. Elmore stopped in the East Texas county of Walker, and was one of the founding fathers of Waverly, Texas, named for the Waverley novels of Sir Walter Scott.http://www.granburystexasbrigade.org/gallery/heroes/officers/elmore.html American Civil War service Elmore fought for and organized the 20th Texas Infantry Regiment at Galveston, Texas, during the early summer of 1862. Many of the men under his command had previously served in the 9th Texas (Nichols’) Infantry regiment. They were primarily from Waller, Montgomery, Austin, Kaufman, Galveston, and Walker Counties. The majority of the men from Montgomery County who enlisted in the 20th Texas were in Company G, commanded by Dixon H. Lewis of Old Waverly and Company K, commanded by Captain Lemuel G. Clepper of Montgomery. This regiment had a high percentage of middle-aged men. The regiment was assigned to the Trans-Mississippi Department and was charged with defending the Texas coast from the Sabine River to Galveston. Despite the fact that they did not see action outside of Texas, the 20th Infantry played an important part in the Confederate recapture of Galveston in January 1863. In addition to Colonel Henry Marshall Elmore, its commanding officers were Lieutenant Colonel Leonard A. Abercrombie and Major Robert E.

Pollution of the Ganges (or Ganga), the largest river in India, poses significant threats to human health and the larger environment. Severely polluted with human waste and industrial contaminants, the river provides water to about 40% of India's population across 11 states, serving an estimated population of 500 million people which is more than any other river in the world. Today, the Ganges is considered to be the sixth-most polluted river in the world. Raghubir Singh, an Indian photographer, has noted that no one in India spoke of the Ganges as polluted until the late 1970s. However, pollution has been an old and continuous process in the river as by the time people were finally speaking of the Ganges as polluted, stretches of over six hundred kilometres were essentially ecologically dead zones.Wohl, Ellen E. 2012. A world of rivers: environmental change on ten of the world's great rivers. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. A number of initiatives have been undertaken to clean the river but failed to deliver as desired results.Ganga, Yamuna banks cleaned 12 November 2013 After getting elected, India's Prime minister Narendra Modi affirmed to work in cleaning the river and controlling pollution. Subsequently, the Namami Gange project was announced by the government in the June 2014 budget. An estimated Rs 2,958 Crores (US$460 million) have been spent until July 2016 in various efforts in cleaning up of the river. Causes The main causes of water pollution in the Ganga river are the disposal of human sewage and animal waste, increasing population density, and disposal of industrial waste into the river. =Human waste= The river flows through 100 cities with populations over 100,000; 97 cities with population between 50,000 to 100,000, and about 48 towns. A large proportion of the sewage water with higher organic load in the Ganga is from this population through domestic water usage. =Industrial waste= Because of the establishment of a large number of industrial cities on the bank of the Ganga like Kanpur, Prayagraj, Varanasi and Patna, countless tanneries, chemical plants, textile mills, distilleries, slaughterhouses, and hospitals prosper and grow along this and contribute to the pollution of the Ganges by dumping untreated waste into it. One coal-based power plant on the banks of the Pandu River, a Ganges tributary near the city of Kanpur, burns 600,000 tons of coal each year and produces 210,000 tons of fly ash. The ash is dumped into ponds from which a slurry is filtered, mixed with domestic wastewater, and then released into the Pandu River. Fly ash contains toxic heavy metals such as lead and copper. The amount of parts per million of copper released in the Pandu before it even reaches the Ganga is a thousand times higher than in uncontaminated water Industrial effluents are about 12% of the total volume of effluent reaching the Ganges. Although a relatively low proportion, they are a cause for major concern because they are often toxic and non-biodegradable. =Religious traditions= During festival seasons, over 70 million people bath in the Ganga to clean themselves from their past sins. Some materials like food, waste or leaves are left in the Ganga which are also responsible for its pollution. Traditional beliefs hold that being cremated on its banks and to float down the Ganga will atone for the sins of those who die and carry them directly to salvation. In Varanasi alone, an estimated forty thousand bodies are cremated every year into ganga into many of which are only half-burnt. Dams and pumping stations Built in 1854 during the British colonisation of India, the Haridwar dam has led to decay of the Ganges by greatly diminishing the flow of the river. The Farakka Barrage was built originally to divert fresh water into the Hooghly River but has since caused an increase of salinity in the downstream of the Ganges, having a damaging effect on the ground water and soil along the river. The barrage has caused major tension between Bangladesh and India. Bangladesh is actively considering to construct Ganges Barrage Project for mitigating the salinity problem. The government of India has planned about 300 dams on the Ganges and its tributaries in the near future despite a government- commissioned green panel report that has recommended scrapping 34 of the dams citing environmental concerns. Three more barrages across the Ganges main river are existing at Bijnor, Narora and Kanpur. The barrages at Bijnor and Narora divert all the water including baseflows during dry season to the canals for irrigating vast area up to Allahabad city. Most of the water available at the upstream of the Kanpur barrage is used during dry season for the cities drinking water needs. Downstream of Kanpur barrage, adequate water is not available from the barrage to dilute the polluted water reaching the main river during the dry seasons of year. There are number of pumping stations located on the banks (right and left) of the Ganges downstream of Kanpur barrage serving the irrigation requirements of huge area. These large pump houses are located at Rukunpur , Kanjauli Kachhar , Hakanipur Kalan , Bhosawali , Shekpur , Chochakpur , Lamui , Chausa , etc. (Refer to Google Earth maps) These lift irrigation schemes are pumping out most of the base flows available in the main river down stream of Kanpur city. To make the Ganges live/flowing and dilute the polluted water inflows from habitations and industries, at least 5000 cusecs flow is required from Narora to Farakka as minimum environmental flow during the eight months dry season. This is possible by constructing storage reservoirs of capacity 100 Tmcft across the Ganges tributaries located up stream of Narora city and reserving the stored water only for minimum environmental flows. In addition, a series of cascading barrage cum bridges are to be constructed across the river from Kanpur to Allahabad to increase the surface area of impounded polluted water in the river so that it serves as vast natural oxidation ponds. The accumulated sediments/sludge would get washed away during the annual monsoon floods. Already, a number of barrages are planned between Farakka and Allahabad to make the 1620 km length of the river navigable from Haldia to Allahabad under National Waterway 1 project which can be extended up the Kanpur. Statistics A 2006 measurement of pollution in the Ganges revealed that river water monitoring over the previous 12 years had demonstrated fecal coliform counts up to 100,000,000 MPN (most probable number) per 100 ml and biological oxygen demand levels averaging over 40 mg/l in the most polluted part of the river in Varanasi. The overall rate of water-borne/enteric disease incidence, including acute gastrointestinal disease, was estimated to be about 66%.Hamner S, Tripathi A, Mishra RK, Bouskill N, Broadaway SC, Pyle BH, Ford TE. \\"The role of water use patterns and sewage pollution in incidence of water-borne/enteric diseases along the Ganga river in Varanasi, India.\\", International Journal of Environmental Health Research, Montana, USA, 2006 Apr 16. A systematic classification done by Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board's (UEPPCB) on river waters into the categories A: safe for drinking, B: safe for bathing, C: safe for agriculture, and D: excessive pollution, put the Ganges in D. Coliform bacteria levels in the Ganges have also been tested to be at 5,500, a level too high to be safe for agricultural use let alone drinking and bathing. The leather industry in Kanpur which employs around 50,000 people in more than 400 tanneries uses chemicals such as toxic chromium compounds. Effectively, chromium levels have not decreased in the Ganges even after a common treatment plant was established in 1995. It now stands at more than 70 times the recommended maximum level. A study conducted by the National Cancer Registry Program (NCRP) under the Indian Council of Medical Research in 2012, suggested that \\"those living along its banks in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Bengal are more prone to cancer than anywhere else in the country\\". Effect =Marine life= The results of mercury analysis in various specimens collected along the basin indicated that some fish muscles tended to accumulate high levels of mercury. Of it, approximately 50–84% was organic mercury. A strong positive correlation between mercury levels in muscle with food habit and fish length was found.Moumita Pal, Santinath Ghosh, Madhumita Mukhopadhyay, Mahau Ghosh. Ganga and Yamuna. \\"Methyl mercury in fish—a case study on various samples collected from Ganga river at West Bengal.\\", Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 8 June 2011. The Ganges river dolphin is one of few species of fresh water dolphins in the world. Listed as an endangered species, their population is believed to be less than 2000. Hydroelectric and irrigation dams along the Ganges that prevents the dolphins from travelling up and down river is the main reason for their reducing population. The Ganges softshell turtle (Nilssonia gangetica) is found in the Ganges, Indus, and Mahanadi river systems of Pakistan, northern India, Bangladesh, and southern Nepal. This turtle inhabits deep rivers, streams, large canals, lakes and ponds, with a bed of mud or sand. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, freshwater turtle species are vulnerable. Due to their long lifespan and high trophic level in the aquatic food web, turtles are vulnerable to heavy metals pollution, a major kind of pollution in the Ganges.Malik, R. N., Ghaffar, B., & Hashmi, M. Z. (2013). Trace metals in Ganges softshell turtle (aspideretes gangeticus) from two barrage: Baloki and rasul, pakistan. Environmental Science and Pollution Research International, 20(11), 8263-73. =Wildlife= Some of the dams being constructed along the Ganges basin will submerge substantial areas of nearby forest. For example, the Kotli-Bhel dam at Devprayag will submerge 1200 hectares of forest, wiping out the forest area. =Human beings= An analysis of the Ganges water in 2006 and 2007 showed significant associations between water-borne/enteric disease and the use of the river for bathing, laundry, washing, eating, cleaning utensils, and brushing teeth. Water in the Ganges has been correlated to contracting dysentery, cholera, hepatitis, as well as severe diarrhoea which continues to be one of the leading causes of death of children in India. > During the summer and monsoon, hospital wards team with children who need > treatment for waterborne diseases - but according to S.C. Singh, a > paediatrician at Varanasi Shiv Prasad Gupta Hospital, their parents rarely > mention that they have been swimming in the river. They don't appear to have > made the connection, he says. Cleanup efforts =Ganga Mahasabha= Ganga Mahasabha is an Indian organization dedicated to the Ganges, founded by Madan Mohan Malaviya in 1905. After a long struggle, British India agreed on 5 November 1914 that the uninterrupted flow of the Ganges is the rudimentary right of Hindu believers. The day is known as a 'Aviral Ganga Samjhauta Divas' (Uninterrupted Ganga flow agreement day) in the history of India and the agreement came into existence on 19 December 1916 which is known as Agreement of 1916. The sanctity of the agreement is not preserved by the state and central governments of India after independence though it is legally valid. More and more river water is diverted for irrigation use converting the river into a polluted sewer. = Ganges Action Plan = Ganges Canal dried for cleaning The Ganges Action Plan (GAP) was launched by Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India, on June 1986 with covering 25 Class I towns (6 in Uttar Pradesh, 4 in Bihar and 15 in West Bengal); Rs 862.59 crore were spent. Its main objective was to improve the water quality by the interception, diversion and treatment of domestic sewage and to prevent toxic and industrial chemical wastes from identified polluting units from entering the river. The other objectives of the GAP are as follows: *Control of non-point pollution from agricultural run off, human defecation, cattle wallowing and the disposal of human remains in the river. *Research and development to conserve the biotic diversity of the river to augment its productivity. *Development of sewage treatment technology such as Up-flow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) and sewage treatment through afforestation. *Rehabilitation of soft-shelled turtles for pollution abatement. *Resource recovery options such as methane production for energy generation and use of aquaculture for revenue generation. *To act as trend setter for taking up similar action plans in other grossly polluted stretches in other rivers. *The ultimate objective of the GAP is to have an approach of integrated river basin management considering the various dynamic interactions between abiotic and biotic eco-system. Notwithstanding some delay in the completion of the first phase of the GAP it has generated considerable interest and set the scene for evolving a national approach towards replicating this program for the other polluted rivers of the country. The Government of India proposed to extend this model with suitable modifications to the national level through a National River Action Plan (NRAP). The NRAP mainly draws upon the lessons learnt and the experience gained from the GAP besides seeking the views of the State Governments and the other concerned Departments/Agencies. Under NRCP scheme the CPCB had conducted river basin studies and had identified 19 gross polluted stretches and 14 less polluted stretches along 19 rivers, which include 11 stretches situated along 7 rivers of M.P. It was much more effective as compared to the previous launched programs. Phase II covered 59 towns in five states; Rs 505.31 cr were spent. Rivers such as Yamuna, Gomti, Damodar, Mahananda had separate action plans. =National River Ganga Basin Authority (NRGBA)= NRGBA was established by the Central Government of India, on 20 February 2009 under Section 3 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. It declared the Ganges as the \\"National River\\" of India. The chair includes the Prime Minister of India and chief ministers of states through which the Ganges flows. In 2011, the World Bank approved $1 billion in funding for the National Ganges River Basin Authority. = 2010 Government clean-up campaign = In 2010, it was announced that \\"the Indian government has embarked on a $4 billion campaign to ensure that by 2020 no untreated municipal sewage or industrial runoff enters the 1,560-mile river.\\" A World Bank spokesman described the plan in 2011, saying > Earlier efforts to clean the Ganges concentrated on a few highly polluting > towns and centres and addressed 'end-of-the-pipe' wastewater treatment > there; Mission Clean Ganga builds on lessons from the past, and will look at > the entire Gangetic basin while planning and prioritising investment instead > of the earlier town-centric approach. Lobby group Sankat Mochan Foundation (SMF) \\"is working with GO2 Water Inc., a Berkeley, California, wastewater-technology company\\" to design a new Sewage treatment system for Varanasi. The Supreme Court of India has been working on the closure and relocation of many of the industrial plants like Tulsi along the Ganges. In 2010 the government declared the stretch of river between Gaumukh and Uttarkashi an Eco-sensitive zone. =Namami Gange Programme= In the budget tabled in Parliament on 10 July 2014, the Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced an integrated Ganges development project titled 'Namami Gange' (meaning 'Obeisance to the Ganges river') and allocated 2,037 crore for this purpose. The objectives were effective abatement of pollution, conservation, and rejuvenation of the Ganges. Under the project, 8 states are covered. Ministry of Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation proposes to make 1,674 gram panchayats by the Ganges open defecation-free by 2022, at a cost of Rs 1,700 cr (central share). An estimated Rs 2,958 Crores (US$460 million) have been spent till July 2016 in various efforts in cleaning up of the river. As a part of the program, government of India ordered the shut down of 48 industrial units around the Ganges. The program has a budget outlay of Rs. 20,000 crore for the next five years. This is a significant five-fold increase over the expenditure in the past 30 years (Government of India incurred an overall expenditure of approximately Rs. 4000 crore on this task since 1985). The centre will now take over 100% funding of various activities/ projects under this program. Taking a leaf from the unsatisfactory results of the earlier Ganges Action Plans, the centre now plans to provide for operation and maintenance of the assets for a minimum 10-year period, and adopt a PPP/SPV approach for pollution hotspots. In an attempt to bolster enforcement the centre also plans to establish a four-battalion Ganga Eco-Task Force. The program emphasises on improved co-ordination mechanisms between various ministries/agencies of central and state governments. Major infrastructure investments which fall under the original mandate of other ministries viz. Urban Development (UD), Drinking Water & Sanitation (DWS), Environment Forests & Climate Change (EF&CC;) etc., will be undertaken in addition. 'Namami Gange' will focus on pollution abatement interventions namely interception, diversion and treatment of waste water flowing through the open drains through bio- remediation / appropriate in-situ treatment / use of innovative technologies / sewage treatment plants (STPs) / effluent treatment plant (ETPs); rehabilitation and augmentation of existing STPs and immediate short term measures for arresting pollution at exit points on river front to prevent inflow of sewage etc. Significantly the approach is underpinned by socio- economic benefits that the program is expected to deliver in terms of job creation, improved livelihoods and health benefits to the vast population that is dependent on the river. The main pillars of Namami Gange Programme are: # Sewerage Treatment Infrastructure # River-Front Development # River-Surface Cleaning # Bio-Diversity # Afforestation # Public Awareness # Industrial Effluent Monitoring # Ganga Gram Its implementation has been divided into entry-level activities (for immediate visible impact), medium-term activities (to be implemented within five years of time frame) and long-term activities (to be implemented within ten years). =Ganga Manthan= Ganga Manthan was a national conference held to discuss issues and possible solutions for cleaning the river.Ganga Manthan The conference aimed to take feedback from stakeholders and prepare a road map for rejuvenating the Ganges. The event was organised by the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG)on 7 July 2014 at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi. Nepal to release water during lean flow period Nepal has constructed many barrages (excluding joint projects with India) or pump houses to divert the lean season river flows for irrigation purpose. These water diversion projects are located near , , , , , , , , , etc. India being lower riparian state has right to claim share out of the river water flows from Nepal similar to India entered into river water sharing agreement with Bangladesh recognising it as lower riparian state. Till now there is no bilateral agreement between India and Nepal adhering to equitable sharing of river waters during the lean season. When Nepal releases water into India during the lean flow period, it would help in cleaning / diluting the polluted waters of downstream Ganges river up to Farakka barrage. Water diversion from Manasarovar lake A satellite view of the Manasarovar (right) and Rakshastal lakes with Mount Kailash in the background For restoring the minimum environmental flows, it is difficult to identify nearly 100 Tmcft storage reservoirs in the hilly region of Ganges basin in India as the river is flowing through steep valleys. Already big storage reservoirs like Tehri and Ramganga are constructed at feasible locations. However the water of Manasarovar Lake located in China can be diverted to the upstream of Kanpur barrage (117 m msl) via Girijapur Barrage (129 m msl) located at across the Ghaghara/Karnali river which is a tributary of Ganges river flowing from Tibet/China and Nepal. Manasarovar Lake's surface area is , and its maximum depth is . It holds more than 100 tmcft water in its top 13 metres depth. At present it is overflowing into nearby Lake Rakshastal which is a landlocked saltwater endorheic lake. The annual water inflows from the catchment area of Manasarovar lake located at above msl, can be diverted by gravity to the Karnali River basin of China through a 15-kilometre long tunnel. The diverted water available continuously can be used in China for hydroelectric power generation where the head drop available is in excess of 800 metres over a 40 km long stretch. This would be a joint project of China, Nepal and India for controlling river water pollution and making the Ganges river live and flowing throughout the year. With the diversion of Manasarovar lake water to Ganges basin, Lake Rakshastal would turn into a Soda lake with further increase in water salinity which is useful in abstracting the water-soluble chemicals on commercial scale. The fresh water inflows into Manasarovar lake can be augmented further substantially by gravity diversion of the inflows available from the major catchment area of Rakshastal lake to Manasarovar lake by constructing an earth dam isolating northern tip of Rakshastal lake where it is fed by its substantial catchment area and also connected to the Manasarovar lake. Utilisation of Ganges and Bramhaputra flood waters to fight pollution in all rivers of India A fresh water coastal reservoir with massive storage capacity can be established on the shallow sea area adjoining West Bengal, Odisha and Bangladesh coast by constructing sea dikes / bunds/ causeway up to the depth of 20 metres. Water can be pumped from this artificial fresh water lagoon throughout the year with abundant Hydro power resource of India to many river basins in India for meeting needs of agriculture, maintaining environmental flows, salt export requirements, etc. Nearly 360 billion cubic metres (bcm) storage capacity fresh water coastal reservoir/lagoon can be located on the sea area which stretches from coast of south eastern Bangladesh (near ) to the mouth of Brahmani River (near ). The dike would be envisaged with gated barrages to pass to the sea the excess flood waters (total mean annual flow 1200 bcm) received from the Ganges, Brahmaputra, etc. rivers for limiting the maximum reservoir level (FRL) to nearly 2.0 m above MSL (below local high tide level). From this coastal reservoir, water is pumped to Salandi reservoir at 70 m MSL (near to ) in the Brahmani river basin for further transfer to basins of Damodar River, Subarnarekha River, Brahmani River, Mahanadi River in Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal states. The Hasdeo Bango reservoir (near ) would receive the Ganges water via Hirakud reservoir and further pumped into the Narmada, Sone, Tapti, Yamuna, Chambal, Ghaggar, Ganges, etc. river basins for using in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, south Uttar Pradesh, south Bihar, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and Delhi states. See Google earth maps for more geographical information. Further, water can be pumped into the Bagh reservoir and Upper Indravati reservoir located in Godavari River basin to transfer Ganges water into Godavari and Krishna river basins. The advantage of this scheme is that Ganges and Bramhaputra river waters can be stored on Bay of Bengal sea area and nearly 540 bcm water @ 17,000 cumecs transferred throughout the year to other river basins including Ganges basin at optimum pumping head. A map of the Ganges (orange), Brahmaputra (violet), and Meghna (green) drainage basins. Nearly 1000 million tons (500 million cubic metres) of sediment annually from Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers is settling in the sea coast of Bangladesh and India and the sea area is shallow (up to 20 m depth) for 60 km wide on average. Bangladesh plagued with high population density, can reclaim nearly 7,500 km2 (5% of its total land) area of sea by excavating/dredging sediment from the fresh water lagoon bed without any effect on the water storage of the coastal reservoir. The presence of the protective sea dike makes sub sea soil dredging easier and economical through protection from rough sea waves. This reclaimed area from the sea can be utilised for locating a megacity to cater to the modern needs of Bangladesh. This coastal dike would protect the Bangladesh from the wave and tidal activity during the frequent cyclones preventing human and property losses drastically and also from sea level rise due to global warming. Thus Bangladesh would also benefit immensely with this coastal reservoir project. The sea dike top level at 8 m above the mean sea level and 50 m wide at the top surface, would be nearly 600 km long connecting Indian mainland to South east of Bangladesh forming transnational high way and rail route from the Indian subcontinent to East Asia up to Singapore and China. Also this dike can be used as access way connecting deep sea ports located close to this dike. The proposed dike would be similar to the land reclamation of North Sea area called Delta Works in Netherlands. The experience of the Saemangeum Seawall already constructed in South Korea which is 33 km long and with 36 metres average depth, can be utilised for this project which is a lesser challenging project. Locks arrangement (similar to Panama canal) would be provided for the movement of ships from the open sea to harbours located in Bangladesh and India. The off shore earth dam extending up to +8 m msl height, is in the form of two parallel dikes separated by 1000 metres gap. The main purpose of the twin dikes is to prevent any sea water seepage into coastal reservoir as its water level is below the sea level. The water level between the dikes is always maintained up to 1 m above the sea level by pumping fresh water from the coastal reservoir to the 1000 m gap between the dikes. The higher level water barrier between the two dikes fully eliminate any sea water seepage in to the coastal reservoir by establishing fresh water seepage to the sea. The 600 km long, 1000 m gap between the two dikes is also used as deep water mega harbor for shipping, ship breaking, ship building, etc. For shipping purpose, the breakwater outer dike facing the sea is envisaged with few locks fitted with twin gates for access to the open sea. The top surface of inner dike would serve as access to the main land from the mega harbor with rail and road links. The coastal reservoir whose full reservoir water level (FRL) is at 0.0 m msl, would also reduce drastically the cyclone damage and flooding in adjacent coastal areas. The cost of the total project including coastal reservoir, water pumping stations (60 GW), canal drop hydro power stations (15 GW), main canals, tunnels, aqueducts, barrages and distribution canals is estimated nearly 7px 20 trillion (lakh crores INR) at year 2018 prices. Cheaper and continuously available hydro power will be supplied by harnessing the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab rivers for the water pumping needs. The irrigation potential of the project alone is 150 million acres with water supply throughout the year. It is a gigantic multi purpose project where cleaning of many major rivers of India (not Ganges river alone) from the water pollution is one of its purpose.  Clean Ganga Fund  The Union Cabinet gave its approval for setting up of Clean Ganga Fund in September 2014 with the aim of using the collection for various activities under the Namami Gange programme for cleaning the Ganges. Utilisation of funds * Cleaning up of the Ganges * Setting up of waste treatment plants * Conservation of biotic diversity of the river * Development of public amenities * Activities such as Ghat redevelopment and Research and Development and innovative projects. =National Mission for clean Ganga= Pollution in Ganga The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) is the implementation wing of National Ganga Council which was set up in October 2016 under the River Ganga (Rejuvenation, Protection and Management) Authorities order 2016. The order dissolved National Ganga River Basin Authority. The aim is to clean the Ganges and its tributaries in a comprehensive manner. Nitin Gadkari is the present Minister for Ministry for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Government of India. Protests for cleaning the Ganges =Nigamanand= In early 2011, a Hindu monk named Swami Nigamananda Saraswati fasted to death, protesting against pollutive river bed quarrying of the Ganges happening in the district of Haridwar, Uttarakhand. Following his death in June 2011, his ashram leader Swami Shivananda fasted for 11 days starting on 25 November 2011, taking his movement forward. On 5 December 2011, the Government of Uttarakhand released an order to ban river bed mining in the Bhogpur and Bishanpur ghats. According to administration officials, quarrying in the Ganges would now be studied by a special committee which would assess its environmental impacts on the river and its nearby areas. =G. D. Agrawal= G. D. Agrawal was a environment activist and patron of Ganga Mahasabha, an organisation founded by Madan Mohan Malviya in 1905, demanding removal of dams on Ganges. Because of support from other social activists like Anna Hazare, the then-Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh agreed to Agrawal's demands. Accordingly, he called for a National River Ganga Basin Authority (NRGBA) meeting and urged the authorities to utilise the ₹26 billion (US$520M) sanctioned \\"for creating sewer networks, sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, electric crematoria, community toilets and development of river fronts\\". Agrawal died on 11 October 2018, after being on an indefinite fast since 22 June 2018, demanding the government act on its promises to clean and save the Ganges.

She served as duenna of Catherine of Aragon. Elvira Manuel was a Castilian noblewoman, married to Don Pedro Manuel. She was described as stern and proud. She was appointed first lady-in-waiting and head of Catherine's female retinue before her departure to England in 1501. While the Count and Countess de Cabra were to act as head of Catherine's household, Elvira Manuel became governess and chaperone and entrusted to act as a mother substitute. Catherine's mother, Queen Isabella I of Castile, trusted Elvira completely. She and her husband, Ferdinand II of Aragon, instructed the Duke de Estrada that Elvira would order Catherine's household according to her discretion and their orders, and he should see that Catherine do as Elvira advised.Calendar State Papers Spain, vol. 1 (1862), 394, 26 June 1504. Two years before the death of Queen Isabella in 1504, Catherine's husband, Arthur, Prince of Wales, died. Catherine was then betrothed to the future Henry VIII. Meanwhile, Catherine's sister, Joanna was now reigning with her husband Philip in Castile. Joanna had a mental disability and could not properly rule as queen, so it was Philip who held all the power. Henry VII saw that an alliance with Austria and Castile would serve him better. By this time, Philip had turned against his father-in-law, Ferdinand, Catherine's father, and took matters into his own hands by arranging with Henry VII that his son, the future Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, was to be married to Princess Mary Tudor and his daughter Archduchess Eleanor of Austria to Prince Henry. Henry VII then made his son repudiate his betrothal to Catherine and secretly betrothed him to Catherine's niece. Doña Elvira took part in this intrigue as a spy, because she absolutely loathed Ferdinand. Suddenly, in 1506, King Philip died. At this point it was only Aragon that was left as a political option for Henry VII, and he recanted and reinstated the betrothal of Catherine and Prince Henry. Still, it would be three more years before Catherine would marry Henry VIII. When Catherine later discovered Doña Elvira's betrayal, she immediately dismissed her from her service. On 6 September 1507, Alonso de Esquivel wrote to Miguel Perez Almazan that it had been an horrible hour when Elvira left Catherine's service.Calendar State Papers Spain, vol. 1 (1862), no. 539.

The story takes place during Operation Enduring Freedom in the Philippines. A group of U.S. Marines are sent to rescue a captured U.S. Marine Captain and a Filipino Major while tracking down a group of Al-Qaeda terrorists intent on launching biological weapons.Cetti 2008, p. 144. The film was produced by the legendary B-movie producer Roger Corman. The Hunt for Eagle One stars Mark Dacascos, Theresa Randle, Rutger Hauer, Joe Suba and Zach McGowan. The sequel, The Hunt for Eagle One: Crash Point, featuring many of the same production crew and cast, came out on DVD, some months later. Plot After a successful amphibious insertion, a small group of Marines prepare for combat against the local rebels in the island of Mindanao in the southern Philippines. While making a routine fly-by, a UH-1 Huey helicopter, carrying some Philippine troops and Marines, is shot down by the rebels. Among the occupants is USMC Captain Amy Jennings (Theresa Randle) and Major Aguinaldo (Ricardo Cepeda). Jennings and Aguinaldo escape the wreckage, and try to flee from the pursuing rebels. A rescue team is dispatched to save Jennings and Aguinaldo, but is shot down by anti-aircraft fire. The surviving Lt. Daniels (Mark Dacascos) and his team continue onward to search for Captain Jennings and Major Aguinaldo. Jennings and Aguinaldo are captured by the rebels, and taken to a village. There, Jennings tries to escape, but is caught. The following morning, Aguinaldo is executed by the rebel leader. They take Jennings to their headquarters. Gen. Frank Lewis (Rutger Hauer) is in charge of the Marine Corps on the island, and receives hell from higher ranking Marine Corps officials regarding the captured Jennings. The rescue team approaches the village, and learns that the rebels have moved Jennings to their HQ. They begin following the rebels. The rebels try to force Jennings to tell the United States (through a video camera) that the Marines must leave the island; but she refuses. In response, the rebels torture her. After battling several rebels, the rescue team link up with Philippine troops, and battle the remaining rebels in the HQ. They rescue Jennings and destroy an anthrax lab. They escape from the blast. The rebel leader survives the blast, but Jennings shoots him dead. The film ends with Lt. Daniels and a Filipino attached to him mourning the loss of their soldiers.

In fact, as early as 1934, Popper started criticising the increasingly more accepted Copenhagen interpretation, a popular subjectivist interpretation of quantum mechanics. Therefore, in his most famous book Logik der Forschung he proposed a first experiment alleged to empirically discriminate between the Copenhagen Interpretation and a realist interpretation, which he advocated. Einstein, however, wrote a letter to Popper about the experiment in which he raised some crucial objections and Popper himself declared that this first attempt was \\"a gross mistake for which I have been deeply sorry and ashamed of ever since\\". Popper, however, came back to the foundations of quantum mechanics from 1948, when he developed his criticism of determinism in both quantum and classical physics. As a matter of fact, Popper greatly intensified his research activities on the foundations of quantum mechanics throughout the 1950s and 1960s developing his interpretation of quantum mechanics in terms of real existing probabilities (propensities), also thanks to the support of a number of distinguished physicists (such as David Bohm). Overview In 1980, Popper proposed perhaps his more important, yet overlooked, contribution to QM: a \\"new simplified version of the EPR experiment\\". The experiment was however published only two years later, in the third volume of the Postscript to the Logic of Scientific Discovery. The most widely known interpretation of quantum mechanics is the Copenhagen interpretation put forward by Niels Bohr and his school. It maintains that observations lead to a wavefunction collapse, thereby suggesting the counter-intuitive result that two well separated, non-interacting systems require action-at-a-distance. Popper argued that such non-locality conflicts with common sense, and would lead to a subjectivist interpretation of phenomena, depending on the role of the 'observer'. While the EPR argument was always meant to be a thought experiment, put forward to shed light on the intrinsic paradoxes of QM, Popper proposed an experiment which could have been experimentally implemented and participated at a physics conference organised in Bari in 1983, to present his experiment and propose to the experimentalists to carry it out. The actual realisation of Popper's experiment required new techniques which would make use of the phenomenon of Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion but had not yet been exploited at that time, so his experiment was eventually performed only in 1999, five years after Popper had died.  Popper's proposed experiment  Contrarily to the first (mistaken) proposal of 1934, Popper's experiment of 1980 exploits couples of entangled particles, in order to put to the test Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Indeed, Popper maintains: > \\"I wish to suggest a crucial experiment to test whether knowledge alone is > sufficient to create 'uncertainty' and, with it, scatter (as is contended > under the Copenhagen interpretation), or whether it is the physical > situation that is responsible for the scatter.\\"Popper (1982), p. 27. Popper's proposed experiment consists of a low-intensity source of particles that can generate pairs of particles traveling to the left and to the right along the x-axis. The beam's low intensity is \\"so that the probability is high that two particles recorded at the same time on the left and on the right are those which have actually interacted before emission.\\" There are two slits, one each in the paths of the two particles. Behind the slits are semicircular arrays of counters which can detect the particles after they pass through the slits (see Fig. 1). \\"These counters are coincident counters [so] that they only detect particles that have passed at the same time through A and B.\\"Popper (1982), p. 28. Fig.1 Experiment with both slits equally wide. Both the particles should show equal scatter in their momenta. Popper argued that because the slits localize the particles to a narrow region along the y-axis, from the uncertainty principle they experience large uncertainties in the y-components of their momenta. This larger spread in the momentum will show up as particles being detected even at positions that lie outside the regions where particles would normally reach based on their initial momentum spread. Popper suggests that we count the particles in coincidence, i.e., we count only those particles behind slit B, whose partner has gone through slit A. Particles which are not able to pass through slit A are ignored. The Heisenberg scatter for both the beams of particles going to the right and to the left, is tested \\"by making the two slits A and B wider or narrower. If the slits are narrower, then counters should come into play which are higher up and lower down, seen from the slits. The coming into play of these counters is indicative of the wider scattering angles which go with a narrower slit, according to the Heisenberg relations.\\" Fig.2 Experiment with slit A narrowed, and slit B wide open. Should the two particle show equal scatter in their momenta? If they do not, Popper says, the Copenhagen interpretation is wrong. If they do, it indicates action at a distance, says Popper. Now the slit at A is made very small and the slit at B very wide. Popper wrote that, according to the EPR argument, we have measured position \\"y\\" for both particles (the one passing through A and the one passing through B) with the precision \\\\Delta y, and not just for particle passing through slit A. This is because from the initial entangled EPR state we can calculate the position of the particle 2, once the position of particle 1 is known, with approximately the same precision. We can do this, argues Popper, even though slit B is wide open. Therefore, Popper states that \\"fairly precise \\"knowledge\\"\\" about the y position of particle 2 is made; its y position is measured indirectly. And since it is, according to the Copenhagen interpretation, our knowledge which is described by the theory - and especially by the Heisenberg relations — it should be expected that the momentum p_y of particle 2 scatters as much as that of particle 1, even though the slit A is much narrower than the widely opened slit at B. > Now the scatter can, in principle, be tested with the help of the counters. > If the Copenhagen interpretation is correct, then such counters on the far > side of B that are indicative of a wide scatter (and of a narrow slit) > should now count coincidences: counters that did not count any particles > before the slit A was narrowed. > To sum up: if the Copenhagen interpretation is correct, then any increase in > the precision in the measurement of our mere knowledge of the particles > going through slit B should increase their scatter.Popper (1982), p.29. Popper was inclined to believe that the test would decide against the Copenhagen interpretation, as it is applied to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. If the test decided in favor of the Copenhagen interpretation, Popper argued, it could be interpreted as indicative of action at a distance. The debate Many viewed Popper's experiment as a crucial test of quantum mechanics, and there was a debate on what result an actual realization of the experiment would yield. In 1985, Sudbery pointed out that the EPR state, which could be written as \\\\psi(y_1,y_2) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{iky_1}e^{-iky_2}\\\\,dk, already contained an infinite spread in momenta (tacit in the integral over k), so no further spread could be seen by localizing one particle. Although it pointed to a crucial flaw in Popper's argument, its full implication was not understood. Kripps theoretically analyzed Popper's experiment and predicted that narrowing slit A would lead to momentum spread increasing at slit B. Kripps also argued that his result was based just on the formalism of quantum mechanics, without any interpretational problem. Thus, if Popper was challenging anything, he was challenging the central formalism of quantum mechanics. In 1987 there came a major objection to Popper's proposal from Collet and Loudon. They pointed out that because the particle pairs originating from the source had a zero total momentum, the source could not have a sharply defined position. They showed that once the uncertainty in the position of the source is taken into account, the blurring introduced washes out the Popper effect. Furthermore, Redhead analyzed Popper's experiment with a broad source and concluded that it could not yield the effect that Popper was seeking. Realization of Popper's experiment Fig.3 Schematic diagram of Kim and Shih's experiment based on a BBO crystal which generates entangled photons. The lens LS helps create a sharp image of slit A on the location of slit B. thumb200pxrightFig.4 Results of the photon experiment by Kim and Shih, aimed at realizing Popper's proposal. The diffraction pattern in the absence of slit B (red symbols) is much narrower than that in the presence of a real slit (blue symbols). Popper's experiment was realized in 1999 by Kim and Shih using a spontaneous parametric down- conversion photon source. They did not observe an extra spread in the momentum of particle 2 due to particle 1 passing through a narrow slit. They write: > \\"Indeed, it is astonishing to see that the experimental results agree with > Popper’s prediction. Through quantum entanglement one may learn the precise > knowledge of a photon’s position and would therefore expect a greater > uncertainty in its momentum under the usual Copenhagen interpretation of the > uncertainty relations. However, the measurement shows that the momentum does > not experience a corresponding increase in uncertainty. Is this a violation > of the uncertainty principle?\\" Rather, the momentum spread of particle 2 (observed in coincidence with particle 1 passing through slit A) was narrower than its momentum spread in the initial state. They concluded that: > \\"Popper and EPR were correct in the prediction of the physical outcomes of > their experiments. However, Popper and EPR made the same error by applying > the results of two-particle physics to the explanation of the behavior of an > individual particle. The two-particle entangled state is not the state of > two individual particles. Our experimental result is emphatically NOT a > violation of the uncertainty principle which governs the behavior of an > individual quantum.\\" This led to a renewed heated debate, with some even going to the extent of claiming that Kim and Shih's experiment had demonstrated that there is no non- locality in quantum mechanics. Unnikrishnan (2001), discussing Kim and Shih's result, wrote that the result: > \\"is a solid proof that there is no state-reduction-at-a-distance. ... > Popper's experiment and its analysis forces us to radically change the > current held view on quantum non-locality.\\" Short criticized Kim and Shih's experiment, arguing that because of the finite size of the source, the localization of particle 2 is imperfect, which leads to a smaller momentum spread than expected. However, Short's argument implies that if the source were improved, we should see a spread in the momentum of particle 2\\\\. Sancho carried out a theoretical analysis of Popper's experiment, using the path-integral approach, and found a similar kind of narrowing in the momentum spread of particle 2, as was observed by Kim and Shih. Although this calculation did not give them any deep insight, it indicated that the experimental result of Kim-Shih agreed with quantum mechanics. It did not say anything about what bearing it has on the Copenhagen interpretation, if any. Criticism of Popper's proposal Tabish Qureshi has published the following analysis of Popper's argument. The ideal EPR state is written as \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty y,y\\\\rangle \\\\, dy = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty p,-p\\\\rangle \\\\, dp, where the two labels in the \\"ket\\" state represent the positions or momenta of the two particle. This implies perfect correlation, meaning, detecting particle 1 at position x_0 will also lead to particle 2 being detected at x_0. If particle 1 is measured to have a momentum p_0, particle 2 will be detected to have a momentum -p_0. The particles in this state have infinite momentum spread, and are infinitely delocalized. However, in the real world, correlations are always imperfect. Consider the following entangled state : \\\\psi(y_1,y_2) = A\\\\\\\\!\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty dp e^{-p^2/4\\\\sigma^2}e^{-ipy_2/\\\\hbar} e^{i py_1/\\\\hbar} \\\\exp[-{(y_1+y_2)^2/16\\\\Omega^2}] where \\\\sigma represents a finite momentum spread, and \\\\Omega is a measure of the position spread of the particles. The uncertainties in position and momentum, for the two particles can be written as : \\\\Delta p _{2} = \\\\Delta p _{1} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma^2 + {\\\\hbar^2/16\\\\Omega^2}},~~~~ \\\\Delta y_1 = \\\\Delta y_2 = \\\\sqrt{\\\\Omega^2+\\\\hbar^2/16\\\\sigma^2}. The action of a narrow slit on particle 1 can be thought of as reducing it to a narrow Gaussian state: \\\\phi_1(y_1) = \\\\frac{1}{(\\\\epsilon^22\\\\pi)^{1/4} } e^{-y_1^2/4\\\\epsilon^2}. This will reduce the state of particle 2 to \\\\phi_2(y_2) = \\\\\\\\!\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\psi(y_1,y_2) \\\\phi_1^*(y_1) dy_1. The momentum uncertainty of particle 2 can now be calculated, and is given by : \\\\Delta p_{2} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2(1+\\\\epsilon^2/\\\\Omega^2)+ \\\\hbar^2/16\\\\Omega^2}{1+4\\\\epsilon^2(\\\\sigma^2/\\\\hbar^2+1/16\\\\Omega^2)}}. If we go to the extreme limit of slit A being infinitesimally narrow (\\\\epsilon\\\\to 0), the momentum uncertainty of particle 2 is \\\\lim_{\\\\epsilon\\\\to 0} \\\\Delta p_{2} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma^2+ \\\\hbar^2/16\\\\Omega^2}, which is exactly what the momentum spread was to begin with. In fact, one can show that the momentum spread of particle 2, conditioned on particle 1 going through slit A, is always less than or equal to \\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma^2 + \\\\hbar^2/16\\\\Omega^2} (the initial spread), for any value of \\\\epsilon, \\\\sigma, and \\\\Omega. Thus, particle 2 does not acquire any extra momentum spread than what it already had. This is the prediction of standard quantum mechanics. So, the momentum spread of particle 2 will always be smaller than what was contained in the original beam. This is what was actually seen in the experiment of Kim and Shih. Popper's proposed experiment, if carried out in this way, is incapable of testing the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. On the other hand, if slit A is gradually narrowed, the momentum spread of particle 2 (conditioned on the detection of particle 1 behind slit A) will show a gradual increase (never beyond the initial spread, of course). This is what quantum mechanics predicts. Popper had said > \\"...if the Copenhagen interpretation is correct, then any increase in the > precision in the measurement of our mere knowledge of the particles going > through slit B should increase their scatter.\\" This particular aspect can be experimentally tested. Popper's experiment and ghost diffraction It has been shown that this effect has actually been demonstrated experimentally in the so-called two-particle ghost interference experiment. This experiment was not carried out with the purpose of testing Popper's ideas, but ended up giving a conclusive result about Popper's test. In this experiment two entangled photons travel in different directions. Photon 1 goes through a slit, but there is no slit in the path of photon 2. However, Photon 2, if detected in coincidence with a fixed detector behind the slit detecting photon 1, shows a diffraction pattern. The width of the diffraction pattern for photon 2 increases when the slit in the path of photon 1 is narrowed. Thus, increase in the precision of knowledge about photon 2, by detecting photon 1 behind the slit, leads to increase in the scatter of photons 2. Popper's experiment and faster-than-light signalling The expected additional momentum scatter which Popper wrongly attributed to the Copenhagen interpretation can be interpreted as allowing faster-than-light communication, which is thought to be impossible, even in quantum mechanics. Indeed, some authors have criticized Popper's experiment based on this impossibility of superluminal communication in quantum mechanics. Use of quantum correlations for faster-than-light communication is thought to be flawed because of the no-communication theorem in quantum mechanics. However the theorem is not applicable to this experiment. In this experiment, the \\"sender\\" tries to signal 0 and 1 by narrowing the slit, or widening it, thus changing the probability distribution among the \\"receiver's\\" detectors. If the no-communication theorem were applicable, then no matter if the sender widens the slit or narrows it, the receiver should see the same probability distribution among his detectors. This is true, regardless of whether the device was used for communication (i.e. sans coincidence circuit), or not (i.e. in coincidence).

Named for Buncombe County, North Carolina, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. She currently serves as a ferry between New London, Connecticut, and Orient, Long Island.  Construction  LST-510 was laid down on 27 September 1943 at Jeffersonville, Indiana by the Jeffersonville Boat and Machine Company; launched on 30 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. C. P. Watson; and placed in reduced commission on 18 January 1944. Departing her builders' yard three days later, on 21 January, LST-510 proceeded down the Mississippi River to New Orleans, where she was placed in full commission on 31 January 1944 with Lieutenant George P. Andrews in command. Service history =Convoy to the United Kingdom, April 1944= After fitting out, LST-510 carried out an abbreviated shakedown cruise to the vicinity of Panama City, Florida, returning to New Orleans in February for post-shakedown availability. On 1 March LST-510 loaded the 150-ton tank landing craft onto her upper deck. She then headed to New York City, where she embarked additional crewmen and took on board 600 tons of ammunition. From there, she proceeded via Boston to Halifax, Nova Scotia and then left North American waters on 29 March in a 64-ship convoy. Like most passages of the North Atlantic during World War II, this one proved hazardous and chilling, both in the physical and the psychological sense. In one three-day period, she endured fog, sleet, and a wind that drove waves over her bow. Then, there was the occasional iceberg. Yet, undoubtedly, U-boats caused the greatest anxiety. They torpedoed four ships in the convoy, one of them just away on LST-510s port quarter. On one occasion, maneuvers to evade the unseen enemy briefly threw the convoy into disorder in dense fog. To make matters worse, LST-510s engines broke down. All on board shared the certain fear that a torpedo would soon set off her explosive cargo until successful repairs allowed her to resume her harried voyage. LST-510 reached Derry, Northern Ireland safely on 13 April. =Invasion of Normandy, June 1944= From there, LST-510 crossed the Irish Sea and stopped briefly at Milford Haven, Wales before proceeding on to Plymouth, England where she delivered LCT-709. During May, 1944 LST-510 outfitted at Falmouth and Fowey for her next mission while \\"scuttlebutt\\" over the nature of that assignment flew furiously. Orders to load vehicles only heightened the excitement and accelerated the pace of work. Then, on 1 June 1944, LST-510 embarked 200 men and 70 vehicles of the 29th Infantry Division, and the ship backed out into the bay and anchored. From that moment on, no one was allowed off the ship. At 0337 on 4 June, LST-510 weighed anchor and got underway, bound for the coast of France, but put about to return to Plymouth when foul weather compelled postponement. Finally, at 0355 on 5 June, LST-510 again shaped a course for France. By daybreak, LST-510 had formed up with Convoy B 1 of the 4,000-vessel Western Task Force. Neither LST-510 nor her embarked soldiers took part in the initial assault at Normandy. The invasion was already eight hours old when she began approaching Omaha Beach, near Vierville. She could not get all the way in to the beach itself, so LST-510 unloaded her cargo and disembarked her men via LCTs and \\"Rhino\\" pontoon barges. That night, LST-510 endured her first air raid, but her only loss proved to be sleep. The raids continued sporadically throughout the night. Even before all of LST-510s cargo had been unloaded, she began embarking wounded men for treatment. The three doctors on board performed their work in a \\"magnificent\\" manner, \\"in the face of existing conditions,\\" laboring throughout the night on the ship's tank deck where an operating room had been set up. =Channel operations, June 1944-June 1945= In the next three months, LST-510 shuttled between the Isle of Portland and Weymouth, England, and Utah or Omaha Beach, transporting troops and vehicles eastward and casualties westward across the English Channel. In late September, on her 21st passage across the channel, LST-510 beached over a hollow on the bottom which produced abnormal stresses on her hull, throwing her starboard shaft out of alignment. Forced to return to England on one engine, the tank landing ship was drydocked for repairs at Plymouth for a month. LST-510 spent the first half of November, 1944 at anchor off Le Havre with a low-priority cargo waiting word to move inshore. Following two voyages to Rouen, the ship was proceeding to Cherbourg when she hit an underwater obstruction which holed her hull, flooding both engine rooms and plunging the ship into darkness. The next day, in tow of another LST, the ship headed back to Portland for temporary repairs, and to Falmouth for another month of drydocking and engine repairs. Even after that, bad luck continued to dog LST-510. On 5 February 1945 while returning from Le Havre in a dense fog, she collided bow-to-bow with SS Chapel Hill Victory south of the Isle of Wight, demolishing her own bow as far aft as frame 10. The pea-soup fog had nullified the efforts of her bow lookouts who had but a few seconds warning as the \\"Victory ship\\" loomed out of the murk. One of LST-510s bow lookouts died in the mishap. Drydocked at Falmouth until mid-May, LST-510 finally left Plymouth for the United States on 7 June 1945. =Return to the US, June 1945= After touching at Norfolk, the tank landing ship proceeded via New Orleans to Galveston, Texas where she prepared for Pacific service. However, Japan's capitulation in August 1945 cancelled plans for her journey to the Pacific. Instead, LST-510 reported to Green Cove Springs, Florida where she was placed out of commission on 1 July 1946. LST-510 received one battle star for her World War II service. =Decommissioning and sale= Inactive for over a decade, she was named USS Buncombe County (LST-510) on 1 July 1955. Deemed \\"unfit for further Naval service\\" on 27 October 1958, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 November 1958. Passenger deck of the Cape Henlopen. The award ribbons she earned during World War II are on display. In 1960, the ship was sold to the Chesapeake Bay Ferry District of Norfolk, Virginia and renamed MV Virginia Beach. Resold in 1964 or 1965 to the Delaware River and Bay Authority, she was renamed MV Cape Henlopen and converted to a passenger and auto ferry in 1966, operating between Lewes, Delaware and Cape May, New Jersey. Purchased in 1983 by Cross Sound Ferry Services, Inc.USS LST-510 renamed Cape Henlopen of New London, Connecticut, she underwent a total refurbishment before entering service between Orient Point, New York (Long Island) and New London, perhaps making it the only D-Day veteran ship to still be in active service (map). The ferry was repowered during the winter of 1995 with EMD 12-645 diesel engines. MV Cape Henlopen is one of the oldest operating ferries in the world and one of the few ships who served in World War II still in active service.

It was constructed in 1929 in the Art Deco style and is nine stories high. It is part of the Baker Historic District and listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It was designed by the Portland office of architectural firm Tourtellotte & Hummel. The general contractor was John Almeter of Portland and the roofing contractor was Cook & Emele of Baker City. Early history The building in 1930 An earlier building on the site housed the first livery stable in Baker, but it was demolished to make way for the hotel. The building is constructed of concrete and has its main entrance on Main Street, with an auxiliary entrance on Auburn Avenue. The roof is topped with an eight-sided cupola, with a matching octagonal hip roof with a flagpole. The cupola was designed as an observation center, from which the Powder River Basin and Elkhorn Mountains can be seen. The original windows were double-hung wood sashes. Decorative elements included concrete garlands and scrolls, pairs of terra cotta eagles at the entrances, and urns at the corners of the eighth floor. The hotel was built to serve long-distance automobile travelers who were becoming common in the 1920s, and it did not need to be located near the railroad tracks. It was planned as a community hotel, both a community asset and an investment. Local ownership meant that the community was \\"financially and emotionally involved in the project's success\\". The hotel was originally owned by 300 local residents who purchased stock shares, priced affordably to be within reach of many residents, and survived the Great Depression without losses to the owners of their investment. It was near default on its mortgage obligations and petitioned for bankruptcy reorganization in 1936, but bond-holders rejected the plan. The debt was refinanced and reduced, in part with a loan from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Interest payments were reduced by 50 percent and the hotel remained solvent. National conventions were held in the hotel, which had a reputation as \\"the finest place to dine in eastern Oregon\\". The original stockholders sold the building in 1946 after more than 60 percent of them agreed to a sale, at which time the word \\"community\\" was dropped from the name. Conversion The building was originally an 82-room hotel and operated as one from its opening on August 24, 1929, until the late 1960s before being closed and sold in a foreclosure auction. Its owner since 1961, A.C Lighthall, had sold it twice to owners who continued to operate it as a hotel, but both lost it by failing to make the payments. Lighthall then closed it on January 1, 1969. It remained vacant for almost two years, then was resold to a local investor who believed it was the \\"largest and finest building in all Baker\\". It was converted to restaurant/retail/office usage on the first, second, ninth and tenth floors and apartments on other floors in 1972. Eleven rooms on the second floor remained nightly rental hotel rooms. The remainder of the rooms were made into one or two bedroom apartments. In 1992, the building was \\"run-down\\" and a $1.2 million restoration was performed to convert it to senior housing. A 1999 renovation brought a new elevator, HVAC system, fire sprinklers, windows. Later work brought restoration of art deco detailing and fiber-optic wiring enabling it to be marketed as high-tech office space. After the 2001 renovation, the building was configured with retail and office space on floors one through five, with the upper floors residential condominiums. Other Cast and crew of the 1969 musical film Paint Your Wagon, starring Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood, stayed at the hotel during filming which occurred near Baker City. The hotel was nearly fully booked just before its permanent closure after the movie production ended.

The plateau is at an altitude of 3,450 feet (1,050 meters) in the foothills of Mont Blanc. Primarily an agricultural district, the plateau is also a winter sports area. The village of Passy is located here. The plateau, situated below the Fiz mountain range, is popular with paragliders and hang-gliders, and hosts the largest paragliding school in France. In the 1950s the plateau was serviced by a cable car from Chedde, but this no longer exists. A notable feature of the area is the modern church of Notre Dame de Toute Grace, begun in 1937 and consecrated in 1950. It was designed by the architect Maurice Novarina, and the artists who contributed to its decoration, include Fernand Léger, Jean Lurçat, Germaine Richier, Marc Chagall, Jacques Lipchitz, and Georges Rouault. The church was built through the efforts of Father Marie-Alain Couturier, a Dominican priest, who sought to revitalize church architecture through the contributions of the best contemporary artists regardless of their faith. It was also host to a sanatorium for TB victims, and still hosts a hospital for the mentally infirm.

It was built by the Noble Brothers to supply iron products to the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Site The furnace is roughly pyramidal in shape, 30 feet (9 m) square at the base, 15 feet (4.5 m) square at the top, and 45 feet (14 m) tall. It is built of large hematite blocks quarried from Dirt Cellar Mountain and brought the three miles (5 km) to the site by ox cart. See also: A half-mile (.8 km) long mill race was constructed from the Chattooga River through a tunnel under a hill to power a water wheel which provided the air blast to operate the furnace. A bridge, no longer extant, spanned from the hillside to the top of the stack, where iron ore was loaded into the furnace. A gristmill and sawmill were also located on the site. History James Noble, Sr., and his five sons began operating the Noble Brothers foundry in Rome, Georgia, in 1855. In 1862 the Confederate States of America commissioned the company to build two new furnaces, in exchange for cannons, caissons, and other products. Construction of the furnace began shortly thereafter, involving an estimated 1,000 Confederate soldiers and slaves from nearby plantations. The furnace went into production in either late 1862 or early 1863. Charcoal was produced on nearby farms and plantations to fire the furnace, and water power from the Chattooga River was used to power the blast. The pig iron ingots manufactured at the furnace were sent to the Noble Brothers' foundry in Rome for the manufacture of war materials. The furnace was knocked out of production for the remainder of the war by Union troops in 1864. It was put back into operation after the war in 1867, but was blown out permanently in 1874. Evangelist Samuel Porter Jones worked at the furnace some time after the Civil War operating an ox cart. The property changed hands several times over the next 100 years. Preservation Cornwall Furnace was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. In 1975 the furnace and surrounding 5 acres (2 ha) were acquired by the Cherokee County Commission with the aid of the Alabama Historical Commission and the Cherokee County Historical Society. The commission developed the site into a park, which was inaugurated in 1977. It is part of the Civil War Discovery Trail. References Further reading * Col. Robert N.

Their second album, Total Magique, was released September 4, 2007, with a new label Dare to Care Records. History Around 2000, Alexander Ortiz and Vincent Levesque, both from the visual art world, along with Antonin Marquis, formed a band with synthesizers, bass, vocals and drums. In their own words the band likes to qualify their sound as \\"a post-punk landscape with analogue trees. Like rock after the postmodern explosion\\". The band remained nameless until 2002; when Alexander showed up at the jam space wearing a home-made shirt with a skull spitting a synth displaying the inscription, 'We Are Wolves', they decided to name the band We Are Wolves. In 2005, they released the album \\"Non- Stop Je Te Plie en Deux\\" on the American label Fat Possum. We Are Wolves promoted the album with shows in international festivals including Le Rock dans tous ses états, Les Eurokéennes, Dour Festival, SXSW, CMJ, Virgin Festival and Osheaga. They had their first North American tour in spring 2005. They opened for …And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead and The (International) Noise Conspiracy. In September 2005, they performed at North East Sticks Together. A second tour came in 2006, in which they supported the Gossip in addition to some solo gigs across Canada and the United States. In the summer of 2006, they completed a five-week tour in Europe with Montreal act Duchess Says. In May 2007, they released the single \\"Fight and Kiss\\". This EP also features \\"Coconut 155\\" and marks the second chapter in their career. We Are Wolves presented their second full-length album \\"Total Magique\\" on September 4, 2007 in Canada and on October 2, 2007 in the U.S. They were well received by the media and were covered in Pitchfork Media and Spin. After sold out gigs in Quebec, receiving the M-Galaxie Prize at M for Montreal and participating in four shows for CMJ, the band toured Canada, the U.S. and Europe in 2007-2008. In September 2008, We Are Wolves won a Gémeaux Award for the Best TV Musical Theme for Bazzo.tv theme. The song \\"Psychic Kids\\" is featured on the video game Midnight Club: Los Angeles, and the song \\"Fight and Kiss\\" is featured on the video game Need for Speed: ProStreet. We Are Wolves released their third full-length album, Invisible Violence, on October 6, 2009. The song \\"Holding Hands\\" is featured in the video game Gran Turismo 5. Their fourth album, \\"La Mort Pop Club\\", was released on February 26 of 2013. Musical style Their style is characterized by primal drum sounds, repetitive guitar riffs and bass motives, electronic instrumentation, and male vocals that represent rhythmic, rather than melodic, phrasing. Because of these elements, their sound has been described as \\"primitive\\" and this identity is represented by the band's moniker. One of their first shows was held at the art pavilion of Concordia University. Since then, they have performed in Montreal's traditional venues, loft parties, and art galleries such as Belgo, Saidye Bronfman Center and Fonderie Darling.

He was destined to be shot at his own gate on 1 August 1591 by Sir Robert Montgomerie of Skelmorlie, as part of the reprisals linked to the murder of the Earl of Eglinton, a Montgomery, at the Annick Ford on 18 April 1586.Dobie, James D.

In June 1590, Andrew Mure is recorded as being the heir to his late father John, in the 10s (Scots) lands of Over-Auchentiber in the Bailiary of Cuninghame, which he holds for the payment of 10 firlots and 2 pecks of oatmeal from the feudal lord.

On 4 October 1671, Janet and Agnes Murchland, are recorded as heirs of their grandfather, John Murchland in Cavan Miln (mill), in a part of the 40s (Scots) of Nether - Auchentiber. In 1640 Hew Montgomerie is recorded as owning 'Over-Auchentyber', with John Dean and his mother, Andro (Sic) Mure and Robert Mure residing there. In 1876 the Auchentibers belonged to Robert Bruce Robertson Glasgow of Montgreenan, William Gemmell, Hugh Fleming, and Robert Fleming. StevenSteven, Rev. Charles Bannatyne (Revised 1842). Parish of Stewarton. Presbytery Of Irvine, Synod of Glasgow and Ayr lists John & Alexander Ferguson, Alexander Wylie and Robert Duncan in 1842 as owners of the 'Auchentibers'. =The Cleikum Inn= An Inn with this name is marked on the 1860 OS map on the right hand side of the road near Bentfauld farm. The 1895 does not name it as an inn, but does mark the inn at the position of the present day Blair Tavern; the 1925 OS marks the inn, but not the present day 'Blair Tavern'. The name CleikumScots Dictionary may be related to the 'Cleikum Inn' which features in Sir Walter Scott’s novel 'St Ronan’s Well', in which the 'Cleikum Club' met in the 'Cleikum Inn', so called from the sign-post showing the Saint catching the Devil. Meg Dods, landlady of the Cleikum Inn, is a formidable hostess, who runs a well organised hostelry with high standards of cleanliness and a distinct partiality regarding the social standing of her guests. This may explain why the name was taken up by many inns throughout the country. The name is derived from a unique ceremony the “Cleikum Celebrations.” . . . According to the ancient story, St Ronan met the evil one and “” well and truly by the “hint leg” and vanquished him with the only weapon to hand, the Cleikum Crook, a replica of which is carried by the “Patron Saint” during these celebrations at Innerleithen, near Edinburgh. A boy takes the part of the Patron Saint. A 'Cleik' in Scots is a metal pole from which a pot was hung to heat over a fire. Mistress DodsThe Cleikum Club was the landlady of the Cleikum Inn near Peebles which hosted the gatherings of the Cleikum Club. The aim of the club, which counted Sir Walter Scott among its members, was to celebrate our Scottish national literature. They certainly were among the first organisations to celebrate a Burns' Night. Mistress Dods was a superb cook and rigorous task-master. Staff ' and guests ' trembled before her! Her major publication 'The Cook's and Housewife's Manual' had the same iconic relationship to Scottish cuisine as that of Mrs Beaton to households south of the border. The name of the inn may reflect the popularity of Sir Walter Scott's novels at the time. The inn may have lost out to competition from the 'Blair Tavern' or to Burnhouse which had several inns at one time. James Samuel Wyper was born on 24 October 1920, at Shettleston in Glasgow. When he was two years old he moved with his parents and sisters Violet, Margaret and Tilda to rural Auchentiber near Kilwinning in Ayrshire where their home was a former old coaching inn, the iron rings for tethering horses still embedded in the outer walls.'The Northern Times' 6 April 2007. James's sister Margaret remained at the Inn nursing both her parents until their death. She married her husband Duncan Hyslop at the nearby Benslie Parish Church and her daughter Margaret was born in the house. When her brother James sold the house Margaret and her family moved to Uplawmoor. A lay-by now exists at the site of the Cleikum Inn. Disaster befell all occupants of this Inn which is said to have been haunted by William Wallace trying to return to Elderslie. Illnesses, particularly blood disorders, afflicted all who lived in this Inn for any length of time. Jamieson records that the inn at Burnhouse was nicknames the 'Trap 'Em Inn', the one at Lugton was called the 'Lug 'Em Inn', that at Auchentiber the , and finally the one at Torranyard was called the 'Turn 'Em Out.'Jamieson, Shiela (1997). Our Village. Greenhills WRI. Page 18 =The local schools= In 1860 a school is shown on the OS map in the hamlet, but by 1879 it was moved to the other side of the Lugton Water, with accommodation for 110 children, and an average attendance of 50, and with a grant of £45 11s 0d. In 1881 the attendance was 73 pupils.Groome, Francis H. (1880-85) Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland: A Survey of Scottish Topography, Statistical, Biographical and Historical, published in parts by Thomas C. Jack, Grange Publishing Works, Edinburgh. A new Auchentiber school was built near the Bloak Road bridge and closed in the late 1960s. The building survives as a private house. A small school was located for many years at the nearby hamlet of Bloak. =The Blair Tavern= The 'Blair Tavern' is a prominent group of buildings, but it was not opened as a public house until the late 20th century, although the buildings are marked on the 1860 OS map and may be even older. The date 1834 in Roman numerals is above the entrance door of the tavern. In the 1960s it was a garage, the Blair Garage, and prior to that it may have had some link with the Fergushill Hall. It was renovated in 2008-2009 and is now known as the 'Blair'. =Local place names= The main road through the hamlet was not in existence in 1745, but when first built it is recorded as 'Lochlibo Road'. 'Bloak Road Bridge' is the one near the entrance to Greenlea (previously Greenlee). Mosside was the farm near the Glasgow and Irvine 5.25 milestone, now a ruin. Meg'swa's' is Megswells and is on the road to Irvine via Clonbeith, mentioned in the 'Lady in the Peat' story. 'Todholes' was a ruin as far back as 1860 and lay close to a small quarry on the Auchentiber moss side of the Kilwinning Road. 'Waukmill' was a group of buildings near the ford off the old lane that came out on to the Stewarton road beyond Wardlaw farm. Satellite imagery shows up the course of the old waulkmill lade which came off the Lugton Water to power the waterwheel and returned just below the old ford. Twyford Cottage seems to be named after the ford which lay between it and the road to Wardlaw and Bloak. =Fergushill Hall= A number of properties in the surrounding area have the appellation Fergushill, such as at Knockentiber; North & South Fergushills near Eglinton, also Hill and Hall of Fergushill at Auchentiber. A lane ran to Fergushill Hall from the buildings in Auchentiber which now form the Blair Tavern. This lane only exists in part as of 2007. Robert Fergushill of Fergushill had a crown charter in 1633 of the lands of Middle Auchentiber. He was the last of the lairds and the Craufurds of Craufurdland appear to have inherited. He had married Marion Porterfield, daughter of Alexander Porterfield younger of that Ilk.Paterson, James (1899) History of the County of Ayr with a Genealogical account of the families of Ayrshire.

Mr. Cunningham of Lainshaw built a handsome house over the well in 1833 and appointed a keeper to take care of it as the mineral water was of some value owing to healing properties attributed to it. The well was located in the middle of the kitchen.Houston, John (1915), Auchentiber Moss, 14 August 1915. Annals of the Kilmarnock Glenfield Ramblers Society. 1913 - 1919. P. 112. This is now known at 'Salt Well', lying next to the Glazert. =Quarries and limekilns= Near Waukmill the 1860 OS shows whinstone, limestone and sandstone quarries and a limekiln. On the Kilwinning road is marked the Ward whinstone quarry. { style=\\"float:left; margin:1em; width:27em; border:1px solid #a0a0a0; padding:10px; background:#f5f5f5; text-align:left;\\" - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" Etymology - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:x-medium;\\" The name Auchenmade (previously Achin-Medds), is thought to be derived, according to Pont,Pont, Timothy (1604). Cuninghamia. Pub. Blaeu in 1654. P. 50 from either 'the field of sticks or timber'. In Gaelic this is Achadh-na-maid. Madadh is a wolf, dog or fox and this is another possibility. }On the lane down to East Auchenmade are other freestone and limestone quarries and limekilns. Another whinstone quarry and limekiln was on the road up to Wardlaw. Waukmill no longer exists A weir existed on the Lugton Water nearby and this may have been connected with a waulkmill, one that treated wool to make it suitable for producing cloth for clothing. =Views of Auchenmade claypit and brickworks - 2008= A brickworks was situated at the Auchenmade claypit, close to South Auchenmade farm. It was served by the Caledonian Railway line that ran from Glasgow to Ardrossan via Lissens. the brickworks is marked on the 1896 OS map with its railway siding, however by 1911 the siding is no longer shown and although marked, the brickworks may no longer be working.

Bog asphodel This low-lying area is dominated by Bloak, Lissens, Sidehead, Kennox, Auchentiber, Over Auchentiber, Auchentiber South, Auchentiber West, Dykeneuk, Dykeneuk South, South Auchenmade and Cockinhead mosses. These are more correctly called 'raised bogs' or 'mires' and are a very rare habitat in lowland Scotland; around 90% having been drained or otherwise degraded beyond any possible restoration. Auchentiber Moss is partly wooded with mainly birch trees and the remains of pheasant rearing cages are noticeable. Hummocks or 'heads' of moss are an unusual feature of the wooded part of this moss. Moorgrips or ditches are frequent on the moss and the walker had better beware. Cockinhead is unusually well preserved and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), protected by the Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) organisation. Burns from some of these (Auchentiber, Sidehead and Brummel) run through the hamlet on their way to join the Lugton Water. Bog wood at Stumpy Knowe near South Auchenmade. Bog wood and boulders at the Stumpy Knowe near South Auchenmade; a possible man-made mound lying above the surrounding old raised bogs. Typical plants of these mosses are cottongrasses, ling heather, bell heather, cranberry, blaeberry, bog rosemary, sundews, deer grass, crowberry, etc. Mr. Kerr, the Montgreenan Estate forester in 1915 described to the Kilmarnock Glenfield Ramblers how afforestation was being tried on Auchentiber Moss by his employer, Sir James Bell. During WW1 many woods were cut to provide timber for the war effort and plantings took place to provide for future needs. The part of Auchentiber Moss that was successfully planted circa 1915 now has a good number of large, uniformly aged Scots pines that have greatly contributed to the drying out of the moss in those areas. The pines are also successfully spreading out into the open areas of the moss and will eventually degrade the site unless these trees, as well as the silver birch, are removed. The North Ayrshire Ranger Service carried out a detailed survey of the Auchentiber and other mosses in 2008. A certain amount of peat cutting has taken place, especially beside the road to Sevencares and Kilwinning. Historically the Auchentiber and Dykneuk mosses were one continuous moss, as were Bloak and Kennox.Turner, Land Use by Prehistoric Communities. P. 87. Dr. DuguidService, John (Editor) (1887).

Auchenmade railway station was nearby and was originally part of the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway. It opened on 3 September 1888. It closed between 1 January 1917 and 2 March 1919 due to wartime economy, and closed permanently on 4 July 1932. Lissens Goods station may also have served the village as a freight facility. =Turnpike= Auchentiber was on a toll road or turnpike; the nearest milestone being at the crossroads and the nearest tolls were at Torranyard and Lugton. The name turnpike originated from the original 'gate' used being just a simple wooden bar attached at one end to a hinge on the supporting post. The hinge allowed it to 'open' or 'turn' This bar looked like the 'pike' used as a weapon in the army at that time and therefore we get 'turnpike'. The term was also used by the military for barriers set up on roads specifically to prevent the passage of horses. In addition to providing better surfaces and more direct routes, the turnpikes settled the confusion of the different lengths given to miles,Thomson, John (1828). A Map of the Northern Part of Ayrshire. which varied from 4,854 to nearly . Long miles, short miles, Scotch or Scot's miles (5,928 ft), Irish miles (6,720 ft), etc. all existed. seems to have been an average. Another important point is that when these new toll roads were constructed the turnpike trusts went to a great deal of trouble to improve the route of the new road and these changes could be quite considerable as the old roads tended to go from farm to farm, hardly the shortest route. The tolls on roads were abolished in 1878 to be replaced by a road 'assessment', which was taken over by the County Council in 1889. { style=\\"float:left; margin:1em; width:27em; border:1px solid #a0a0a0; padding:10px; background:#f5f5f5; text-align:left;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Etymology - style=\\"text-align:left; font- size:x-medium;\\" Auchenharvie, according to PontPont, Timothy (1604).

Greenlea, Wardlaw, Law, Redwells, Mid Auchenmade, South Auchenmade, Sunnyside, Sidehead, and Bentfauld farms are in the immediate area. The name 'Wardlaw' is said to derive from 'Watch Hill' as it has a prominent position and a good view therefore. The satellite views of the area around Auchentiber show up the old rig and furrow systems of pre-mechanised agriculture. =The Ghost of Auchentiber= The 'Leddy o'Clumbeith' is a ghost story told by Dr. Duguid circa 1840 in the 1820s. A servant girl from the farm of Clonbeith was making her way to the Blair Tavern to keep a tryst when she fell into a mine shaft, horse and all, and was killed. Others say that her 'lad' killed her and then jumped into the shaft after her. Her ghost haunts the fields around Auchentiber. =The Lady in the peat= Dr. Duguid in around the 1840s records that near Clumbeith (Clonbeith) on the way to 'Meg'swa's' he met Pate Glunch cutting peats. Pate was normally a still, dour man, but on this occasion he was highly animated and took the doctor to see the long dead corpse of a 'bonnie lady' lying in a hole in the peat. She was around 18 to 20 years of age, had rosy cheeks, a sweet smile playing around her lips and blonde hair. Her identity was unknown, but a rumour linked her to the family of the Montgreenan estate.

In 1507 a nominal fine is next inflicted on a Cuthbert Robisoune, farmer in Auchentiber, for an assault committed on one of his neighbours and upon the son. The latter he had cast into the fire, burning him severely. The fine was five merks. The old estate of Montgreenan is now a hotel, about away towards Torranyard. The ruin of Auchenharvie Castle is a prominent feature of this flat landscape in the Torranyard area. A smithy is marked on the 1860 OS map on the 'hamlet' side of the crossroads and the relatively unchanged building is still present today (2007), the roof has since collapsed (2008). The site of the old hamlet school is now occupied by modern buildings. Bloak Moss has been scientifically investigated to ascertain its vegetational history through the analysis of core samples. Steven states that a 'village' called Bloak with about twelve families existed in 1842, with its own school. It was near the Bloak or salt well. A few springs or are still visible as the source of small burns running into the Glazert beyond Wardlaw farm.

History  By the mid 1960s, The Sunset Strip had become a place dominated by young members of the hippie and rock and roll counterculture. While this brought many artistic initiatives to the neighborhood, problems simultaneously arose in the form of alcohol and drug abuse and the disturbance of traffic. In 1966, the city's administration implemented a handful of measures to curtail the growing nuisance. They targeted the Strip's most prominent rock club, the Whisky a Go Go, forcing its managers to change its name to the Whisk . Furthermore, annoyed residents and business owners in the district had encouraged the passage of strict (10:00 p.m.) curfew and loitering laws to reduce the traffic congestion resulting from crowds of young club patrons. This was perceived by young, local rock music fans as an infringement on their civil rights, and for weeks tensions and protests swelled. On Saturday, November 12, 1966, fliers were distributed along the Strip inviting people to demonstrate later that day. Hours before the protest one of L.A.'s rock 'n' roll radio stations announced there would be a rally at Pandora's Box, a club facing forced closure and demolition at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Crescent Heights, and cautioned people to tread carefully. That evening, as many as a 1,000 youthful demonstrators, including such celebrities as Jack Nicholson and Peter Fonda (who was handcuffed by police), erupted in protest against the perceived repressive enforcement of these recently invoked curfew laws. The unrest continued the next night and off and on throughout November and December. Meanwhile, the local administration had decided to get tough, and rescinded the \\"youth permits\\" of twelve of the Strip's clubs, thereby making them off-limits to anybody under 21. In November 1966, the Los Angeles City Council voted to acquire and demolish the Pandora's Box.Baker, Erwin (November 30, 1966).

Hippies Pout, Politicians Cheer as Pandora's Box Is Wrecked. Los Angeles Times According to Timeline's Matt Reimann, the riots anticipated a cultural rift that only grew in the coming years. In this light, Bob Gibson, manager of the Byrds and the Mamas and the Papas reflected: \\"If you had to put your finger on an event that was a barometer of the tide turning, it would probably be the Sunset Strip riots.\\" Cultural impact Regarding the importance of the Sunset Strip riots, The Guardian journalist Woody Haut argues that \\"it was, if nothing else, an early salvo in the \\"culture wars\\", a battle which continues to this day (...).\\" He furthermore argues that the riot's most lasting effect had to do with the music that came out of the event. The incident provided the basis for the 1967 low-budget teen exploitation film Riot on Sunset Strip, and inspired multiple songs: * \\"For What It's Worth\\" written by Stephen Stills and performed by Buffalo Springfield. The song is often used as an antiwar protest song despite not being originally intended as one. Regarding the events, Stills has said: \\"Riot is a ridiculous name, it was a funeral for Pandora's Box. But it looked like a revolution.\\" * \\"Plastic People\\" by Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention. (“I hear the sound of marching feet down Sunset Boulevard to Crescent Heights and there at Pandora’s Box we are confronted with a vast quantity of plastic people”) * \\"Daily Nightly\\" performed by The Monkees.

Under the command of Major General Wesley Merritt, Eighth Corps had only one division, curiously numbered as the Second Division. The Second Division was under the command of Brigadier General Thomas M. Anderson. Eighth Corps defeated the Spanish forces under the command of Governor-General of the Philippines Fermín Jáudenes in the Battle of Manila on August 14, 1898. At the end of March 1900, the complexities involved in dealing with guerrilla warfare and governing the islands led to the transformation of what had been the Department of the Pacific into the Division of the Philippines with four geographical departments, each of which was in turn divided into military districts.

Paramonga was an important city constructed at the border of the former Kingdom of Chimor in Peru during the late Intermediate Period (AD 1200 to 1400), whose capital was the metropolis of Chan Chan. Paramonga is located on the Fortaleza River, close to the town of Pativilca to the north of Lima. It is said that it was an important religious settlement, similar to Pachacamac. It is named after the nearby modern town of Paramonga, as its original name is unknown. Paramonga is often called a fortress due to its staggered pyramid of four levels of enormous proportions constructed on a hill, which somewhat resembles a European medieval castle.Google Maps - Paramonga (with photos) History The oldest written records of Paramonga belong to Miguel de Estete, who was called the \\"chronicler soldier\\", during the conquest of the Tawantinsuyu. In 1533, Estete accompanying Hernando Pizarro and his little dispatch of 'twenty horsemen and some arquebusiers'LA RELACIÓN DEL VIAJEQUE HIZO EL SEÑOR CAPITÁN HERNANDO PIZARRO POR MANDADO DEL SEÑOR GOBERNADOR, SU HERMANO, DESDE EL PUEBLO DE CAXAMALCA A PARCAMA, Y DE ALLI A JAUJA. Miguel Estete with a few of Atahualpa's retainers acting as guides descended from Cajamarca, by orders of the leader of the conquistador band in Peru, the brother of Hernando, Francisco Pizarro, who had settled in Cajamarca alongside a captive Atahualpa Inca since the previous year in order to wait for the completion of enormous ransom payment of gold and silver proposed by Atahualpa for his own rescue, however as time passed the supply of precious metal artifacts arriving at Cajamarca had significantly decreased over the past months, the Spaniards were growing impatient and the tensions between the newly arrived Almagrists and the Pizarrists were beginning to escalate, in an attempt to complete the payment of his ransom Atahaulpa then proposes to the Spanish to loot Pachacamac, city where riches abounded but held by priests that sided with Huascar in the Inca civil war and thus were enemies of Atahualpa. Estete and Hernando's expedition traveled by the Able Ñan (dirt road) along the coast, and became the first Spaniards to have visited Paramonga along the way to Pachacamac. During the Spanish colonial period, Paramanonga would be visited by a number of chroniclers, soldiers, priests, and other literate men. Estete wrote in his account. > \\"... and another day we went to sleep in a large town that is called > Parmunga, which is next to the sea, has a Strong House, with five blind > fences, painted of elaborately on the inside and outside with its walls > carved, the way it is done in Spain, with two tigers (pumas?) at the main > entrance ...\\" Another chronicler, Pedro Cieza de León, passed Paramonga during his trip from the City of the Kings (Lima) to Trujillo in 1541. He described it by the following: > \\"There is one thing worth seeing in this valley, which is a fine well-built > fortress, and it is certainly very curious to see how they raised water in > channels to irrigate higher levels.

After releasing their first full album Welcome to the Fall in 2005, they were able to attract major label support from Universal Records. However, plans fell through and they ended up releasing their second album, Panoramic, independently on March 15, 2009. History =Formation and Fik'shen EP (2001-2004)= The band formed back in 2001 and played locally in Arizona for their first few years. Their first formal release of music was in 2003 with the Fik'shen EP. The release had five tracks; the first three tracks, \\"Overflow\\", \\"Makeshift\\", and \\"Sudden Change\\", would later be reworked and re-recorded later for their first LP, Welcome to the Fall, in 2005. The other two tracks, \\"Bruised and Break\\" and \\"Dissolved\\", had a different, softer sound than the majority of the rest of their work, and were never reworked. Additionally, the track \\"Interlude to Addiction\\", from Welcome to the Fall, is also on the EP, but as an intro to \\"Makeshift\\" rather than a separate track by itself. =Welcome to the Fall (2005-2006)= In 2005, 32 Leaves recorded and mixed their debut album Welcome to the Fall with Larry \\"Love\\" Elyea of Bionic Jive fame, at The Salt Mine and Mind's Eye Digital. The album included artwork from friend and artist Jon McLaughlin (not the singer from Indiana) inside the album jacket. In the same year, they also contributed a cover of The Smashing Pumpkins song \\"Zero\\" for The Killer in You: A Tribute to Smashing Pumpkins. Welcome to the Fall was released on September 6, 2005, on Double Blind records, a minor record label. In the following years, the band supported the album and toured with such acts as 10 Years, Crossfade, Dredg, Evans Blue, Fair to Midland, Smile Empty Soul, and Trapt. =Panoramic (2007-2009)= Due to the extensive touring in support of Welcome to the Fall, they were able to attract the support of a major record label, Universal Records. 32 Leaves recorded two singles, a new version of \\"All Is Numb\\" and new song \\"Way Beyond\\", in October 2007, collaborating with famed producer Elvis Basquette. The band released the songs on iTunes shortly thereafter, as a preview of what they were working on. Not much was heard from the band until December 2008, when a number of things occurred. First, it became known that the band had parted ways with Universal Records. Despite this, they were still determined to release their music, as they decided to continue without the support of a major record company. The band converted a three-story house into a recording studio, with singer Greg Norris engineering. The band spent five months writing and recording. It has been reported that turmoil within the group began mid-process of these \\"house sessions\\". The band completed the record in December 2008. In an online interview Greg Norris stated that \\"the Universal Records experience was not what we were accustomed to, we had day to day contact with the smaller label, I didn't talk to any Universal people at all\\". 32 Leaves previewed a new song on their MySpace, titled \\"Sideways\\". It was a rough mix of a song for the new album. It was said to be the first song they recorded after completing their 2005 CD Welcome to the Fall. They also had plans to preview one more \\"rough mix\\" from the album that month, but those plans fell through. However, the following month they streamed the album version of the track \\"Human\\". Lastly, at the end of the month, they announced that the album had been entitled Panoramic, inspired by a photo that was included in the rear-panel artwork for the record. The album was released March 15, 2009. The album art features a large black beetle crawling on a green leaf. Signed- copy pre-orders shipped one or two weeks before. The band had the freedom to do this with releasing the album independently. The track listing showed that the new version of \\"All Is Numb\\" was cut from the release, and that the version of \\"Way Beyond\\" was an alternate version than the 2007 release, both confirmed with the album's actual release. While the band toured some in 2009 in support of the album, they disbanded amicably in 2010.

The house is the northern half of a 19th-century two-family house, notable for its associations with educator Maria Louise Baldwin (1856–1922). It was her home when she served as the first female African-American principal in a Massachusetts school at Cambridge's Agassiz Grammar School (from 1916 onwards). As master, she supervised 12 teachers, all white, who presided over a 98% white student body. The Agassiz School has since been renamed the Maria Baldwin School in her honor. The Baldwin House was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. and Description and history The main block of the Baldwin House is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure resting on a brick foundation, with a side- gable roof. It is a duplex, a total of six bays in width, with a pair of doorways sheltered by portico supported by three Ionic columns. The doorways are flanked by sidelight windows and pilasters. The remaining bays are filled with two-over-two sash windows. There is a simple entablature below the main roofline, running around the house; the gable ends on the sides are fully enclosed. The house may originally have had corner pilasters, but there is now simple corner molding. To the rear of the house is a two-story kitchen ell, which is slightly lower than the main house due to lower interior ceiling heights on each level. The house is dated to the 1840s based on architectural analysis. 150px Maria Baldwin was born in Cambridge in 1856, graduated from its public schools in 1874, and received a degree from the Cambridge Teachers' Training School the following year. Under pressure from the local African- American community, the Cambridge school administration offered her a teaching position in 1881. She was assigned to the Agassiz School, near Harvard University, and rose to become its master in 1916. At that time she was the first black woman in New England to hold such a high educational position, and was one of only two female masters in the Cambridge schools. The Agassiz School had an almost entirely white student population, and all of its teachers were white. Baldwin moved into the northern half of the duplex at 194-196 Prospect Street in 1892, and lived there until her death in 1922. Her home was a social center of local upper-class African-American social circles, including prominent civil rights activists such as William Monroe Trotter and Archibald Grimké. The Baldwin House is a private home, and is not open to the public. The northern half of the duplex was designated a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

The head of IEG, the Director-General, Evaluation, reports directly to the Bank Group's Board of Executive Directors and not to Bank Group management. Improving development effectiveness by showing what works The World Bank Group has twin goals: to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. To achieve these goals, the World Bank Group needs to better understand what works and why, to draw lessons and good practices from experience, deepening the evidence base to inform decision making and future action. IEG evaluations seek to provide objective assessments to ensure that the Bank Group is accountable for achieving its development objectives. IEG is one of the 4 units (the four I's) that ensure oversight and accountability at the World Bank Group: the Inspection Panel (IPN) and the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) reporting to the Board of Executive Directors; the Internal Audit (IAD) reporting to the President and to the Audit Committee; the Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) reporting to the President.

History Evaluation of World Bank projects began in 1970, when President Robert McNamara created an Operations Evaluation Unit in the bank's Programming and Budgeting Department. In 1973, the unit was renamed the Operations Evaluation Department, and thereafter gained increasing independence from bank management. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) established an evaluation unit in 1984, and in 1995, the unit increased its independence under a new name, the Operations Evaluation Group. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) created an evaluation office in 2002.

Its southern terminus is at Route 3A in Kingston and its northern terminus is at Route 3A in Quincy. Along the way it intersects Route 3 in Hanover. History Route 53 follows the former routing of the Kingston to Quincy section of Route 3 which was moved onto the Southeast Expressway and Pilgrim's Highway expressway when they were fully completed in 1963. The remaining former sections of Route 3 became extensions of Route 3A. For a period of time, from at least the early 1930s through 1967, a mile of what is now Route 53, between Derby Street and Main Street (Route 228), was also coextensive with Route 128. In 1967 that route was cut back to the Braintree Split, and again in 1997 it was officially cut back to the I-95/I-93 junction in Canton. =Queen Anne's Corner= The intersection of Route 53 with Route 228 on the Hingham–Norwell town line is known as Queen Anne's Corner or historically Queen Ann's Corner and the nearby section of Route 53 has also been known as Queen Anne's (or Ann's) Turnpike. The name comes from Anne Whiton, a local tavern owner who in the mid-1700s, along with her daughters, had an \\"unsavory reputation\\" and was called quean with the archaic meaning of the word as prostitute. Route description Weymouth Landing Route 53 begins in Kingston at Route 3A, just a third of a mile west of where that route meets Route 3 at Exit 10. It heads north, almost immediately entering the town of Duxbury. It passes through the southwestern part of that town before meeting Route 14 just over the line into Pembroke. The two routes pass concurrently for over a mile and a half before splitting in the area of North Pembroke. Route 53 is alone for just over a mile and a quarter before becoming concurrent with Route 139. The two routes pass over the North River into Hanover together before splitting. Route 53 heads northwards through the eastern part of Hanover until it passes the Hanover Mall and meets Route 3 once more, at Exit 13. From Route 3 it bends northwestward, going through the western portion of Norwell before meeting Route 228 just over the town line into Hingham. The route passes through the southwest corner of that town before entering Weymouth. In Weymouth, the route bisects the town from southeast to northwest, passing Whitman's Pond and the northern end of Route 18. Route 53 then enters Braintree, crossing the Monatiquot River before entering Quincy, passing the site of the Fore River Shipyard. After just a mile, Route 53 ends at Route 3A, with that route resuming the former route of Route 3.

During the waning days of the Soviet Union, Shayevich was sometimes unofficially referred to in the West as the \\"Soviet Union's Chief Rabbi\\". Shayevich presently holds the position of the Chief Rabbi of Russia representing the Russian Jewish Congress, one of the two major Jewish organization in Russia (of which he also is a member of the presidium). His claim to this title is not universally recognized, however, as the country's other major Jewish organization, Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia, which has been supported by Russia's political leadership since 2000, has its own Chief Rabbi of Russia, Berel Lazar, an adherent of Chabad.Kremlin ruffles Jewish feathers in Lubavitch rabbi appointment, jeweekla.com, 30 March 2001. While the Russian Federation is a secular state, the federal government has referred to both Lazar and Shayevich as the \\"Chief Rabbi of Russia\\".  Early Life and Education  Adolf Shayevich was raised in Birobidzhan during the years under Joseph Stalin in far-eastern Siberia near the border with China, in a fairly secular family of Belarusian Jewish descent. In the early 1970s, Shayevich left his job as a chief mechanic with a local government agency and moved to Moscow. According to his own recollection, he was looking for a change of environment, a more meaningful life where people are not tempted to spend their free time drinking. He found it difficult to find a job in Moscow: employers were wary about hiring a Jew, as they would not want to have any problems on their hands if the employee were to decide to migrate to Israel. However, in 1972 he was admitted to the small religious school affiliated with the Moscow Choral Synagogue, the main synagogue of the city. In 1973, the visiting New York rabbi Arthur Schneier, who had long had good relations both with the chief rabbi of the Moscow Synagogue, Yakov Fishman and with the Soviet ambassador to the U.S. Anatoly Dobrynin, helped two Soviet rabbinical students — Shayevich and Yefim Levitis (who was later to become the rabbi of the Leningrad Synagogue) – to enter the Rabbinical Seminary in Budapest, the only rabbinical training institution that operated at the time in the Soviet Bloc. Shayevich and Levitis became the first two Soviet rabbinical students in their generation who were allowed to go to study abroad,. Shayevich was ordained as a rabbi in April 1980. He met his wife in Budapest.  Career  Back in Moscow, after returning from Budapest, the Council for Religious Affairs (the Soviet government's office for dealing with the religious institutions) suggested that the newly ordained Shayevich return to Birobidzhan - where there was not even a synagogue at the time – but Rabbi Fishman offered Shayevich a position as his deputy at Moscow Choral Synagogue, located in downtown Moscow's Arkhipov Street. In the summer of 1983, after the death of Fishman, Shayevich took over his post as the chief rabbi of the synagogue a post he holds to this day. As this was Moscow's largest and principal synagogue, and the only synagogue in central Moscow,The city's other synagogue was always considered the \\"second\\" one this appointment also made him the Chief Rabbi of Moscow. In 1984, Shayevich visited the United States in a delegation of Soviet religious leaders, hosted by the U.S. National Council of Churches. In 1988, he spent 3 months studying at Yeshiva University in New York. In a letter dated 1 January 1989, Rabbi Shayevich informed the World Jewish Congress that he was no longer a member of the Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet Public; that made it possible his participation in the WJC. Shayevich was appointed the Chief Rabbi of Russia by the Russian Jewish Congress although Rabbi Berel Lazar is the officially recognized Chief Rabbi of Russia by the Russian government.\\"Russian Jewry split over election of Chief Rabbi\\", BBC, 13 June 2000. In June 2000, the dispute between Lazar and Shayevich escalated after Chabad requested that Shayevitch resign his claim to the post. When Lazar was named by the Kremlin to a high-profile governmental advisory panel that includes leaders of all religions officially recognized by the Russian government, the Kremlin demonstrated that it officially recognized Lazar as the religious leader of the Russian Jewish community, replacing congress's Shayevich, who until then had occupied the post. The Russian Government has not invited Shayevich to any state events or giving him any posts. Lazar, on the other hand, as the Kremlin recognized Chief Rabbi of Russia, has received a number of important official positions and has been showered with medals by the Russian government. Shayevich's closeness to Vladimir Gusinsky, the head of the Russian Jewish Congress, is thought to be the cause of his isolation. After Gusinsky supported Putin's rivals for president in 1999, Putin immediately brought Lazar into his circle on becoming president. In a June 2015 interview with Russian journalist Ksenia Sobchak, Shayevich expressed his support for the hanging of homosexuals in Iran.  Awards  In 1987, Shayevich was awarded the Soviet Order of Friendship of Peoples. In 2008, on the occasion of the rabbi's 70th anniversary, he was awarded the highest award of the City Government of Moscow, the \\"Medal of Merit for Moscow\\", by Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.

Early life  António Thomaz Botto was born 17 August 1897 at 8:00 a.m.Baptismal record nr. 6/1898, paróquia de Alvega, concelho de Abrantes, Arquivo Distrital de Abrantes. to Maria Pires Agudo and Francisco Thomaz Botto, in Concavada, near Abrantes, the couple's second son.A first son, Carlos, was born 3 May 1892, Concavada; married 12 September 1915, 1ª CRC Lisboa; died 17 September 1935, freguesia dos Restauradores, Lisboa. Baptismal record nr. 50/1892, paróquia de Alvega, concelho de Abrantes, Arquivo Distrital de Abrantes. His father earned his living as a boatman in the Tagus. In 1902 the family moved to Rua da Adiça, 22, 3rd floor, in the Alfama quarter in Lisbon (where a third and last son would be born). Botto grew up in the typical and popular atmosphere of that neighbourhood. Very old shabby houses, stretched up in steepy narrow streets, the ambiance was one of poverty and somewhat promiscuous. Small shops, small taverns where fado was sung late in the night. The dirty streets crowded with workers, housewives shopping, vendors, beggars, tramps, kids playing, pimps, prostitutes and sailors, which would deeply influence his work. Botto was poorly educated and since youth he took to a series of menial jobs, among them that of a book-shop clerk. Probably his education came from reading the books he lay hands on during his daily work. He also got acquainted with many of Lisbon's men of letters due to his job. In his mid- twenties he got into civil service as a modest administrative clerk in several State offices. In 1924–25 he worked in Santo António do Zaire and Luanda, Angola, returning to Lisbon in 1925, where he stayed the remaining years as a civil servant up to 1942.  The scandal of Canções  Canções, 2nd edition, 1922 His first book of poems Trovas was published in 1917. It was followed by Cantigas de Saudade (1918), Cantares (1919) and Canções do Sul (1920). Canções (Songs) was published in 1921 and went unnoticed. Only after Fernando Pessoa published its 2nd edition, through his publishing house \\"Olisipo\\", emerged a public scandal amongst the Lisbon society which granted Botto a lifelong notoriety: the author dared to write about same-sex love and in a very nonchalant and romantic way. Besides that, it featured a photograph of Botto in a camp, languid pose showing his bare shoulders. To noise Botto's book, Pessoa wrote a provocative and encomiastic article about Canções, published in the journal Comtemporânea,\\"ANTONIO BOTTO e o Ideal Esthetico em Portugal\\" in CONTEMPORANEA: Grande Revista Mensal nr. 3, Lisbon, July, 1922, pp. 121-126. praising the author's courage and sincerity for shamelessly singing homosexual love as a true aesthete. Pessoa's article had a contrary reply in the same journal by the critic Alvaro Maia,\\"LITERATURA DE SODOMA: O Sr. Fernando Pessoa e o Ideal Estético em Portugal\\" in CONTEMPORANEA: Grande Revista Mensal nr. 4, Lisbon, October, 1922, pp. 31-35. followed by another article by Raul Leal (an openly homosexual writer, friend of Pessoa). Conservatives reacted and complained to the authorities about the work's immorality (\\"Sodom's literature\\") and the book was apprehended by the authorities in 1923. The Liga de Acção dos Estudantes de Lisboa [Lisbon Students Action League], a Catholic college students group (led by Pedro Teotónio Pereira) clamored for an auto- da-fé of Botto's book and someone even suggested the author should be hanged. Nevertheless, most artists and intellectuals, headed by Pessoa (a close friend of Botto's and also his publisher and later English translator), promptly took up his defence in several polemic articles. (Left to right): Unknown man, Raul Leal, António Botto, Augusto Ferreira Gomes (standing), Fernando Pessoa at the Café Martinho da Arcada, Lisboa, 1928 Eventually, the scandal subsided, the next year the ban was lifted and until the end of his life Botto would publish several revised versions of the book. It's true his work had been saluted by Teixeira de Pascoaes and José Régio, but praises from the likes of Antonio Machado, Miguel de Unamuno, Virginia Woolf, Luigi Pirandello, Stefan Zweig, Rudyard Kipling, James Joyce or Federico García Lorca, as he claimed, seem to have been a figment of Botto's very wild imagination.  Personal life  Carminda Rodrigues, Botto's common-law wife. Botto was described as a slender, medium-height dandy, fastidiously dressed, oval-faced, a tiny mouth with thin pursed lips, strange, scrutinizing, ironic eyes (sometimes clouded by a disturbing malicious expression) hidden by an everpresent fedora.Simões, João Gaspar: Retratos de Poetas que Conheci, Brasília Editora, Porto, 1974. He had a sardonic sense of humour, a sharp, perverse and irreverent mind and tongue, and he was a brilliant and witty conversationalist. He also reveled in indiscreet gossiping. Some of his contemporaries said he was frivolous, mercurial, mundane, uneducated, vindictive, a mythomaniac and, above all, vain and narcissistic to the point of megalomania.Almada Negreiros said Botto was like a \\"serpent\\" (Simões, p. 175). Botto's mythomania seems to have been a lifelong trait of his. He talked about unlikely friendships with people like Vaslav Nijinsky, Federico García Lorca or André Gide. On the other hand, he never alluded to his modest background or ever talked about his parents or brothers. He was a regular visitor of Lisbon's popular bohemian quarters and the docks, enjoying the company of sailors, a frequent image in his poems. In spite of a homosexual fame, he had a lifelong and fully devoted common-law wife, Carminda da Conceição Silva Rodrigues, a widow, nine years his elder.Born Carminda da Conceição Silva (misspelled \\"Carmindia\\" in her baptismal record), on 17 February 1888, Cercal, Santiago do Cacém, Portugal. \\"Marriage suits every handsome and decadent man\\", he once wrote.Curiosidades Estéticas, Canção VII  Expelled from job  On November 9, 1942Diário do Governo, II série, nº 262, November 9, 1942, pp. 5794–96. Botto was expelled from the civil service for ::i) disobeying orders from a superior; ::ii) for wooing a male co-worker and addressing to him ambiguous words, denouncing tendencies condemned by the social morals; ::iii) for writing and reciting verses during the working hours, disrupting discipline at the workplace. When he read the humiliating public announcement in the official gazette he was totally disheartened, but commented ironically: \\"Now I'm Portugal's only acknowledged homosexual...\\". He tried to earn his livelihood from the royalties of his books and by writing articles, columns and criticism in newspapers. He also wrote several other works, among them Os Contos de António Botto and O Livro das Crianças, a best-seller collection of short stories for children that would be officially approved as school reading in Ireland (The Children’s Book, translated by Alice Lawrence Oram). But this proved insufficient. His health was deteriorating from tertiary syphilis (of which he refused treatment) and the brilliance of his poetry was fading away. He was jeered at any time he entered cafés, bookshops or theatres by homophobes. He was fed up with living in Portugal and in 1947 he decided to move to Brazil hoping for a new beginning. To raise funds for his tripIt is now known that the main donor (an offer of PTE 40.000$00 - present day (2016) estimated € 16,840.00) was banker Ricardo Espírito Santo, at Salazar’s instance, who took pity on Botto’s sorrowful condition. (Amália Rodrigues to author Dacosta in Dacosta, Fernando: As Máscaras de Salazar, Lisboa, 2006.) in May he gave two large poetry recitals in Lisbon and Porto. It was a big success and he was largely praised by several artists and intellectuals, among them Amália Rodrigues, João Villaret and the writer Aquilino Ribeiro. On 5 August 1947, Botto and his wife sailed to Brazil aboard the Juan de Garay liner.Diário de Lisboa, 5 August 1947, p. 4  Years in Brazil and death  Avenida Nossa Senhora de Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro Botto arrived in Rio de Janeiro the day he turned 50, 17 August 1947. He was very well received by the Portuguese community and cherished by local intellectuals like Pompeu de Souza, Macedo Soares, Horácio de Carvalho, Vinicius de Morais or Danton Jobim. The Academia de Letras do Rio de Janeiro received him with welcoming speeches by João Neves Fontoura and Manuel Bandeira. The press of Rio, São Paulo, Recife, Ceará, Baía, was laudatory about him calling him the greatest Portuguese poet alive and publishing encomiastic articles by well-known Brazilian writers. He was invited to banquets, receptions and tribute meetings. He resided in São Paulo until 1951 and then moved to Rio de Janeiro. He survived on his meager royalties and by writing articles and columns in Portuguese and Brazilian newspapers, doing some radio shows and poetry readings in theatres, associations, clubs and, finally, cheap taverns. He was doing badly day by day and he ended up living in very shabby conditions (sometimes the couple resorted to feed on flour mixed with water). Always on the move, changing hotels, boarding houses, apartments. Many times he had to loan from friends, which very rarely if ever were refunded by him. His megalomania (due to syphilis) was rampant and he told delirious, outlandish tales like the one of being visited in Lisbon by Mário de Andrade. When they told him Andrade never went to Portugal, Botto retorted \\"If it was not him then it was Gide or Proust...\\". He also claimed things like being the greatest living poet in the world and that he was the owner of São Paulo. In 1954 he asked to be repatriated but his request was rejected and he finally gave up returning to his home country because he lacked the means. (For that purpose he even tried to be in the good graces of Cardinal Cerejeira, writing a book of very mediocre poetry entitled Fátima.) In 1956 he fell seriously ill and was hospitalised for a time. On the evening of March 4, 1959, on the way to meet a lawyer friend while crossing the Nossa Senhora de Copacabana Avenue, in Rio de Janeiro, he was run over by a State's motor vehicle and he got a broken skull, going into a coma.João Gaspar Simões in a (not yet located) early 1980s article in O Primeiro de Janeiro said that a witness may have seen Botto throwing himself in front of the car, so the possibility of a suicide is not to be discarded. Also, because it was an official vehicle, his widow was granted a lifelong pension. He died on March 16, 1959, around 5:00 pm, in the Hospital Sousa Dias.In the 1980s a Portuguese tabloid (Jornal do Incrível) published an extant and impressive rare photo of Botto's last moments: his wife, crying convulsively, clinching the badly shaven and shabbily dressed corpse of the poet. In 1965 his remains were transferred to Lisbon and since 11 November 1966 they are buried in the Alto de São João cemetery. By that time, his widow also sent Botto's archives to a Portuguese relative of hers who later donated them to Lisbon's Biblioteca Nacional in 1989.

In it, Hume argues (among other things) that the foundations of morals lie with sentiment, not reason. An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals is the enquiry subsequent to the Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (EHU). Thus, it is often referred to as \\"the second Enquiry\\". It was originally published in 1751, three years after the first Enquiry.See via Google Books Hume first discusses ethics in A Treatise of Human Nature (in Book 3 - \\"Of Morals\\"). He later extracted and expounded upon the ideas he proposed there in his second Enquiry. In his short autobiographical work, My Own Life (1776), Hume states that his second Enquiry is \\"of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary, incomparably the best.\\" Summary =Method= Hume's approach in the second Enquiry is largely an empirical one. Instead of beginning his moral inquiry with questions of how morality ought to operate, he purports to investigate primarily how we actually do make moral judgments. As Hume puts it: > As this is a question of fact, not of abstract science, we can only expect > success, by following the experimental method, and deducing general maxims > from a comparison of particular instances. (EPM, §1, ¶10) Furthermore, Hume purports to provide a naturalistic account of morality, at least to the extent that it is something that is common among the human species. He writes: > The final sentence, it is probable, which pronounces characters and actions > amiable or odious, praise-worthy or blameable... depends on some internal > sense or feeling, which nature has made universal in the whole species. > (EPM, §1, ¶8) But, whether in the end Hume purports to provide a normative ethical theory, rather than a merely descriptive theory of moral psychology, is a contentious issue among Hume scholars. =Sentimentalism and reason= Hume defends his sympathy-based moral sentimentalism by claiming that, contrary to moral rationalism, we can never make moral judgments based on reason alone. Reason deals with facts and draws conclusions from them, but, all else being equal, it could not lead us to choose one option over the other; only our sentiments can do this, according to Hume. Hume writes that: > ...morality is determined by sentiment. It defines virtue to be whatever > mental action or quality gives to a spectator the pleasing sentiment of > approbation; and vice the contrary. (EPM, Appendix 1, ¶10) Hume puts forward sentimentalism as a foundation for ethics primarily as a meta-ethical theory about the epistemology of morality. Hume's sentimentalism is akin to the moral epistemology of intuitionism (although, of course, different in many respects). According to such a theory, one's epistemological access to moral truths is not primarily via an evidentially mediated faculty, such as reason. Rather, one's epistemological access is more direct. According to Hume, we know moral truths via our sentiments—our feelings of approval and disapproval. Hume's arguments against founding morality on reason are often now included in the category of moral anti-realist arguments. As Humean- inspired philosopher John Mackie suggests, for there to exist moral facts about the world, recognizable by reason and intrinsically motivating, they would have to be very queer facts. However, there is considerable debate among scholars as to Hume's status as a realist versus anti-realist. =Sympathy, altruism, and egoism= According to Hume, our sympathy-based sentiments can motivate us towards the pursuit of non-selfish ends, like the utility of others. For Hume, and for fellow sympathy-theorist Adam Smith, the term \\"sympathy\\" is meant to capture much more than concern for the suffering of others. Sympathy, for Hume, is a principle for the communication and sharing of sentiments, both positive and negative. In this sense, it is akin to what contemporary psychologists and philosophers call empathy. In developing this sympathy-based moral sentimentalism, Hume surpasses the divinely-implanted moral sense theory of his predecessor, Francis Hutcheson, by elaborating a naturalistic, moral psychological basis for the moral sense, in terms of the operation of sympathy. After providing various examples, Hume comes to the conclusion that most, though not all, of the behaviors we approve of increase public utility. Does this then mean that we make moral judgments on self- interest alone? Unlike his fellow empiricist Thomas Hobbes, Hume argues that this is not in fact the case, rejecting psychological egoism—the view that all intentional actions are ultimately self-interested. In addition to considerations of self-interest, Hume maintains that we can be moved by our sympathy for others, which can provide a person with thoroughly non-selfish concerns and motivations, indeed, what contemporary theorists would call, altruistic concern. =Virtue ethics= The first-order moral theory that emerges from the second Enquiry is a form of virtue ethics. According to Hume, the kinds of things that our moral sentiments apply to—the things of which we approve and disapprove—are not particular actions or events. Rather, we ultimately judge the character of a person—whether they are a virtuous or vicious person. Hume ultimately defends a theory according to which the fundamental feature of virtues is \\"...the possession of mental qualities, 'useful' or 'agreeable' to the 'person himself' or to 'others'\\" (EPM, §10, ¶1). As a result, certain character traits commonly deemed virtues by the major religions of the time are deemed vices on Hume's theory. Hume calls these so-called \\"virtues\\", such as self-denial and humility, monkish virtues. Rather vehemently, he writes: > Celibacy, fasting, penance, mortification, self-denial, humility, silence, > solitude, and the whole train of monkish virtues; for what reason are they > everywhere rejected by men of sense, but because they serve to no manner of > purpose; neither advance a man's fortune in the world, nor render him a more > valuable member of society; neither qualify him for the entertainment of > company, nor increase his power of self-enjoyment? We observe, on the > contrary, that they cross all these desirable ends; stupify the > understanding and harden the heart, obscure the fancy and sour the temper. > We justly, therefore, transfer them to the opposite column, and place them > in the catalogue of vices... (EPM, §9, ¶3) Clearly, Hume thought that there were grave misunderstandings at the time as to what counts as virtue versus vice. For example, Hume attempts to defend, contrary to many religious teachings, that a certain amount of luxury, even pride, is virtuous. Hume makes important distinctions in his classifications of virtues. They are classified as being either \\"artificial\\" or \\"natural\\". The key distinction between these virtue classes is their origin. Artificial virtues originate from and depend on social structures such as courts and parliaments. This category of virtues include fidelity, justice, chastity and adherence to law. Natural virtues are not created but are automatically present in humans since birth. The following quote highlights this: > The epithets SOCIABLE, GOOD-NATURED, HUMANE, MERCIFUL, GRATEFUL, FRIENDLY, > GENEROUS, BENEFICENT, or their equivalents, are known in all languages, and > universally express the highest merit, which HUMAN NATURE is capable of > attaining. (EPM, Section 2, Part 1). Hence, the second major distinction between natural and artificial virtues is that the former type are universal whereas the latter can vary from society to society. Hume then proceeds to delineate the nature of these virtues in detail. The following quote highlights Hume's description of an \\"artificial\\" virtue—that of fidelity: > The long and helpless infancy of man requires the combination of parents for > the subsistence of their young; and that combination requires the virtue of > chastity or fidelity to the marriage bed. (EPM, Section 4) The following quote highlights the origin of this virtue - the notion that this virtue was \\"created\\" is particularly evident: > Without such a UTILITY, it will readily be owned, that such a virtue would > never have been thought of. (EPM, Section 4) Clearly then, the virtue of fidelity was \\"created\\", and therefore it is distinctly artificial.

Biography Pete Friesen was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. While still playing under the name \\"Pete Freezin'\\", he was a member of VO5 with a pre-Skid Row Sebastian Bach. He was a member of Alice Cooper's band from 1989–1991, 1998–2000 and 2002. He played on both the Trash and Hey Stoopid tours, and also appears in the film Wayne's World alongside Cooper. Friesen left Cooper's band in 1992 and moved to the UK to join Scottish rock band The Almighty. He recorded and toured with the band from 1992 until 1996. The band recorded the top 5 album Powertrippin for Polydor, and Crank and Just Add Life for Chrysalis/EMI records. They opened up Donington festival in 1992 and the following year supported Metallica at Milton Keynes Bowl. They did several headline tours through the UK, as well as tours in Europe,Japan, Australia, U.S.A., and South America. They disbanded in 1996, but the lineup featuring Friesen reformed in January 2006 to play two shows to raise money for leukemia research. These were followed by a couple of short UK tours in 2007 and 2008. A live DVD of the London show from the 2008 and tour has been released. In 2002, Friesen also did a short stint playing guitar for Iron Maiden's vocalist Bruce Dickinson's solo band; they did a string of summer festival dates throughout Europe.

It is based on the 1948 novel of the same title by Dodie Smith, with the screenplay written by Heidi Thomas. The film was released in the UK on 9 May 2003. Romola Garai played the lead role of Cassandra Mortmain alongside Bill Nighy, Rose Byrne and Tara Fitzgerald. Synopsis The film follows 17-year-old Cassandra Mortmain, and her eccentric family, struggling to survive in genteel poverty in a decaying English castle. The characters include her father, a writer who hasn't written anything in the twelve years since the spectacular success of his first novel; her older sister Rose (Rose Byrne) who rails against their fate and hopes to marry for money; and their bohemian stepmother, Topaz, an ex-model still apt to sun-bathe in the nude. The possibility of salvation seems to loom in the form of their wealthy American landlord Simon Cotton and his brother Neil. Although Simon initially spurns her, Rose is determined to make him fall in love with her and succeeds. A wedding is arranged and Cassandra appears left on the sidelines. But events spiral out of control, and before the summer ends many expectations will have been overturned. Production Parts of the film were shot in Laxey film studio on the Isle of Man. Manorbier Castle in Pembrokeshire, Wales, supplied exteriors for the castle, and Eltham Palace in London some interiors.

There are a number of reasons why this particular antiderivative is worthy of special attention: * The technique used for reducing integrals of higher odd powers of secant to lower ones is fully present in this, the simplest case. The other cases are done in the same way. * The utility of hyperbolic functions in integration can be demonstrated in cases of odd powers of secant (powers of tangent can also be included). * This is one of several integrals usually done in a first-year calculus course in which the most natural way to proceed involves integrating by parts and returning to the same integral one started with (another is the integral of the product of an exponential function with a sine or cosine function; yet another the integral of a power of the sine or cosine function). * This integral is used in evaluating any integral of the form :: \\\\int \\\\sqrt{a^2+x^2}\\\\,dx, : where a is a constant. In particular, it appears in the problems of: :* rectifying the parabola and the Archimedean spiral :* finding the surface area of the helicoid.  Derivations  = Integration by parts = This antiderivative may be found by integration by parts, as follows: : \\\\int \\\\sec^3 x \\\\, dx = \\\\int u\\\\,dv = uv - \\\\int v\\\\,du where :u = \\\\sec x,\\\\quad dv = \\\\sec^2 x\\\\,dx,\\\\quad v = \\\\tan x,\\\\quad du = \\\\sec x \\\\tan x\\\\,dx. Then : \\\\begin{align} \\\\int \\\\sec^3 x \\\\, dx &{}= \\\\int (\\\\sec x)(\\\\sec^2 x)\\\\,dx  &{}= \\\\sec x \\\\tan x - \\\\int \\\\tan x\\\\,(\\\\sec x \\\\tan x)\\\\,dx  &{} = \\\\sec x \\\\tan x - \\\\int \\\\sec x \\\\tan^2 x\\\\,dx  &{}= \\\\sec x \\\\tan x - \\\\int \\\\sec x\\\\, (\\\\sec^2 x - 1)\\\\,dx  &{}= \\\\sec x \\\\tan x - \\\\left(\\\\int \\\\sec^3 x \\\\, dx - \\\\int \\\\sec x\\\\,dx\\\\right)  &{}= \\\\sec x \\\\tan x - \\\\int \\\\sec^3 x \\\\, dx + \\\\int \\\\sec x\\\\,dx. \\\\end{align} Next add \\\\int\\\\sec^3 x \\\\,dx to both sides of the equality just derived: : \\\\begin{align} 2 \\\\int \\\\sec^3 x \\\\, dx & = \\\\sec x \\\\tan x + \\\\int \\\\sec x\\\\,dx  & = \\\\sec x \\\\tan x + \\\\ln\\\\left\\\\sec x + \\\\tan x\\\\right + C, \\\\end{align} given that the integral of the secant function is \\\\int \\\\sec x \\\\,dx = \\\\ln \\\\sec x + \\\\tan x + C. Finally, divide both sides by 2: :\\\\int \\\\sec^3 x \\\\, dx = \\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\sec x \\\\tan x + \\\\ln \\\\left\\\\sec x + \\\\tan x\\\\right) + C, which was to be derived. = Reduction to an integral of a rational function = : \\\\int \\\\sec^3 x \\\\, dx = \\\\int \\\\frac{dx}{\\\\cos^3 x} = \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\cos x\\\\,dx}{\\\\cos^4 x} = \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\cos x\\\\,dx}{(1-\\\\sin^2 x)^2} = \\\\int \\\\frac{du}{(1-u^2)^2} where u = \\\\sin x, so that du = \\\\cos x\\\\,dx. This admits a decomposition by partial fractions: : \\\\frac{1}{(1-u^2)^2} = \\\\frac{1}{(1+u)^2(1-u)^2} = \\\\frac{1/4}{1+u} + \\\\frac{1/4}{(1+u)^2} + \\\\frac{1/4}{1-u} + \\\\frac{1/4}{(1-u)^2}. Antidifferentiating term by-term, one gets : \\\\begin{align} \\\\int \\\\sec^3 x \\\\, dx &= \\\\frac 1 4\\\\ln 1+u - \\\\frac{1/4}{1+u} - \\\\frac 1 4 \\\\ln1-u + \\\\frac{1/4}{1-u} + C \\\\[6pt] &= \\\\frac 1 4 \\\\ln \\\\Biggl \\\\frac{1+u}{1-u} \\\\Biggl+ \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\left(\\\\frac{u}{1-u^2}\\\\right) + C \\\\[6pt] &= \\\\frac 1 4 \\\\ln \\\\Biggl\\\\frac{1+\\\\sin x}{1-\\\\sin x} \\\\Biggl+ \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sin x}{\\\\cos^2 x}\\\\right) + C\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\frac 1 4 \\\\ln \\\\left\\\\frac{1+\\\\sin x}{1-\\\\sin x}\\\\right + \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\sec x \\\\tan x + C\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\frac 1 4 \\\\ln \\\\left\\\\frac{(1+\\\\sin x)^2}{1-\\\\sin^2 x}\\\\right + \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\sec x \\\\tan x + C\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\frac 1 4 \\\\ln \\\\left\\\\frac{(1+\\\\sin x)^2}{\\\\cos^2 x}\\\\right + \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\sec x \\\\tan x + C\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\frac14 \\\\ln \\\\left\\\\frac{1+\\\\sin x}{\\\\cos x}\\\\right^2 + \\\\frac12 \\\\sec x \\\\tan x + C\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\frac12 \\\\ln \\\\left\\\\frac{1+\\\\sin x}{\\\\cos x}\\\\right + \\\\frac12 \\\\sec x \\\\tan x + C\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\frac12 (\\\\ln\\\\sec x + \\\\tan x + \\\\sec x \\\\tan x) + C. \\\\end{align} = Hyperbolic functions = Integrals of the form: \\\\int \\\\sec^n x \\\\tan^m x\\\\, dx can be reduced using the Pythagorean identity if n is even or n and m are both odd. If n is odd and m is even, hyperbolic substitutions can be used to replace the nested integration by parts with hyperbolic power reducing formulas. : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sec x &{}= \\\\cosh u \\\\[6pt] \\\\tan x &{}= \\\\sinh u \\\\[6pt] \\\\sec^2 x \\\\, dx &{}= \\\\cosh u \\\\, du \\\\text{ or } \\\\sec x \\\\tan x\\\\, dx = \\\\sinh u \\\\, du\\\\[6pt] \\\\sec x \\\\, dx &{}= \\\\, du \\\\text{ or } dx = \\\\operatorname{sech} u \\\\, du \\\\[6pt] u &{}= \\\\operatorname{arcosh} (\\\\sec x ) = \\\\operatorname{arsinh} ( \\\\tan x ) = \\\\ln\\\\sec x + \\\\tan x \\\\end{align} Note that \\\\int \\\\sec x \\\\, dx = \\\\ln\\\\sec x + \\\\tan x follows directly from this substitution. : \\\\begin{align} \\\\int \\\\sec^3 x \\\\, dx &{}= \\\\int \\\\cosh^2 u\\\\,du \\\\[6pt] &{}= \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int ( \\\\cosh 2u +1) \\\\,du \\\\[6pt] &{}= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sinh2u + u\\\\right) + C\\\\[6pt] &{}= \\\\frac{1}{2} ( \\\\sinh u \\\\cosh u + u ) + C \\\\[6pt] &{}= \\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\sec x \\\\tan x + \\\\ln \\\\left\\\\sec x + \\\\tan x\\\\right) + C \\\\end{align}  Higher odd powers of secant  Just as the integration by parts above reduced the integral of secant cubed to the integral of secant to the first power, so a similar process reduces the integral of higher odd powers of secant to lower ones. This is the secant reduction formula, which follows the syntax: : \\\\int \\\\sec^n x \\\\, dx = \\\\frac{\\\\sec^{n-2} x \\\\tan x}{n-1} \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\frac{n-2}{n-1}\\\\int \\\\sec^{n-2} x \\\\, dx \\\\qquad \\\\text{ (for }n e 1\\\\text{)}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! Alternatively: : \\\\int \\\\sec^n x \\\\, dx = \\\\frac{\\\\sec^{n-1} x \\\\sin x}{n-1} \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\frac{n-2}{n-1}\\\\int \\\\sec^{n-2} x \\\\, dx \\\\qquad \\\\text{ (for }n e 1\\\\text{)}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! Even powers of tangents can be accommodated by using binomial expansion to form an odd polynomial of secant and using these formulae on the largest term and combining like terms.

Known as the Etzion Air Force Base, it was demilitarized in 1979 with the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty. Then Israel's \\"Golden Eagle\\", \\"Phoenix\\", and \\"Smashing Parrot\\" squadrons moved out and the land there was restored to Egyptian control. A condition of that peace treaty allows tourists to visit certain areas in Egypt, near Taba, for up to 14 days, without a visa. So from Israel and Jordan, travelers and tourists cross the border at Taba, in buses to visit resorts. Egyptian taxis can take fares up to the Israel border but no further. The airport is located 13 kilometers from Taba and 30 kilometers from Taba Heights, near El Nakb, and adjacent with Eilat, Israel. The airport was named El Nakb Airport. A new terminal building and night lighting was added and the airport was then renamed Taba International Airport in November 2000. The airport receives charter flights. Traffic at the airport declined considerably. In 2014, the airport served 41,142 and in 2015, only 13,488 (a 67.2% decline). In 2016, it was announced that Thales Group would be modernizing Air Traffic Management at Taba International Airport.

The County Park is bordered by Los Altos with some parts of the eastern part of the County Park in western Cupertino. The Open Space Preserve is on the west side of the County Park, also bordered by Los Altos Hills, Monte Bello Open Space Preserve, and the Permanente Quarry. The Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District manages both the 3988 acre Open Space Preserve and the 289 acre County Park. This article covers both Rancho San Antonio County Park and Rancho San Antonio Open Space Preserve. History The Ohlone Indians lived in the area for over 3,000 years prior to the arrival of the Spanish. A large village, known as Partacsi, was located in the general area. In March 1776, Juan Bautista de Anza led the first overland expedition to San Francisco Bay from Monterey through this area. In de Anza's diary on March 25, 1776, he states that he \\"arrived at the arroyo of San Joseph Cupertino (now Stevens Creek), which is useful only for travelers. Here we halted for the night, having come eight leagues in seven and a half hours. From this place we have seen at our right the estuary which runs from the port of San Francisco.\\" de Anza, Juan Bautista (1776). Diary of Juan Bautista de Anza October 23, 1775 - June 1, 1776. Accessed September 8, 2009 University of Oregon Web de Anza pages A prominent hill between Permanente and Stevens Creeks is referred to as \\"De Anza's Knoll\\" and marks the location where the explorer first spotted the Bay. Governor Alvarado granted Rancho San Antonio to Juan Prado Mesa in 1839. Mesa had been a soldier at the San Francisco Presidio since 1828. In 1853, William A. Dana, a former seafarer and merchant, purchased the Rancho. In 1923, the Catholic Church purchased what had become the Snyder Ranch and in 1926 constructed Saint Joseph's College and the Maryknoll Seminary. Saint Joseph's College was demolished after sustaining heavy damage in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The Maryknoll Seminary, with its oriental motif, stands east of the park across Cristo Rey Drive. The Santa Clara County Parks Department purchased 130 acres in 1977 and another 35 acres in 1981 from St. Joseph's Seminary. The Park's improvements were constructed in the early 1980s with additional improvements completed in 1993. Habitat and conservation Several ecosystems exist in the park and preserve. In canyons, bay trees and big-leaf maples form shady groves. Along creeks, several species of willow grow, and cottonwoods are found in a couple areas. On cooler, north-facing slopes, oaks and bays form a forest. On hotter, south-facing slopes, chaparral scrub of chamise, manzanita, and birch-leaf mountain mahogany predominates. Douglas-fir, common west of the crest of the Santa Cruz Mountains, can be seen as lone trees above the Rogue Valley trail, and along the Black Mountain trail; they are the only conifer in the park. Ridges support grassland and scattered oaks. The Open Space Preserve protects the watersheds of West Branch Permanente Creek and its Ohlone Creek tributary. West Branch Permanente Creek begins on the east side of 1,253-foot Ewing Hill, and runs easterly until it reaches the connector from the Chamise and Rogue Valley Trails where an earthen dam forms High Meadow Pond (aka Rogue Valley Pond). Below the pond, the West Branch is joined by 1.7 mile long Ohlone Creek at Deer Hollow Farm and continues on its run (3.2 mile total) to join the Permanente Creek mainstem 1/2 mile south of Interstate 280. West Fork Permanente Creek and its Wildcat Canyon tributary flow intermittently in summer and fall. Permanente Creek flows year round along the approximately 2 mile stretch in the County Park. The Permanente riparian corridor is crucial for wildlife survival, providing food and water as well as the ability to migrate through suburban areas relatively undisturbed. Rancho San Antonio is home to native species such as deer, mountain lion and bobcat. The big cats are tracked and thus far have posed no threat to humans. Visitors are warned of the presence of the animals with signs at the entrance to the preserve and various trail map stations. The Rancho San Antonio land preserve is one of the few remaining tracts of land in Silicon Valley where native animals can roam free. Along with deer, other commonly seen animals are California quail, cottontail rabbits, crows, hawks, jays, LBBs (little brown birds), lizards, squirrels, turkeys, voles, white tailed kites, woodpeckers. Less common, reclusive, or seasonal are blue herons, butterflies, California slender salamanders, coyotes, egrets, frogs, gopher snakes, jackrabbits, newts, rattlesnakes, skunks, tarantulas. Star Thistle is an invasive species growing prolifically in the meadows and along sunny trail sides in the park and the preserve. California Bay Laurel near Permanente Creek in Rancho San Antonio County Park The State's tallest and third largest California bay laurel tree (Umbellularia californica), estimated to be over 200 years old, grows in Rancho San Antonio County Park. When it was protected by fencing and removal of a nearby handball court in 2004, height was 126 feet, trunk circumference was 30 feet, and canopy spread was 118 feet. In 1869, the wood of a California Bay Laurel was used for the “Last Tie” connecting North America's first transcontinental railroad. The tree's leaves are highly aromatic and its small yellow flowers bloom between December and April, important to bees at a time when few other plants are in bloom. Deer Hollow Farm Deer Hollow Farm barn Deer Hollow Farm is an educational center where the public can observe, study and participate in a working farm. The 150-year-old Farm covers ten acres and stands as a reminder of Santa Clara County's agricultural history. In the tradition of a working homestead, Deer Hollow Farm continues to produce food on-site. The farm is home to a variety of animals including chickens, rabbits, goats, sheep, pigs and a cow. Farm fresh eggs and seasonal orchard produce are for sale when available.[4] It is a one-mile easy walk west from the Rancho parking lots along the West Fork Permanente Creek. The restored Grant Ranch Cabin has been furnished to represent living conditions in the late 1800s. The Deer Hollow Farm section of the Rancho San Antonio land preserve is managed by the City of Mountain View recreation division. The city manages all Farm programs and ensures that no further development takes place on the land. The city of Mountain View is instrumental in the preservation of the area and protects the environment against human intervention. The historic open air hay barn rests at the north end of the farm. Visitors can rest and have picnics at the many wooden picnic tables available for public use. Visitors may also take self-guided tours of the surrounding area, which includes the livestock pens. Although the public cannot interact directly with the farm animals, they are able to observe them from a short distance. In addition, an environmentally sustainable vegetable garden neighbors the open air hay barn. Deer Hollow Farm volunteers maintain the garden and plant seasonal vegetables. This garden is utilized as part of the farm's education program. As part of Deer Hollow Farm's commitment to environmental education, including sustainable farming and food growth, the farm offers a variety of educational programs for a range of ages. These programs include a Nature center, which is housed in an old apple shed (one of the original 1850s buildings), School Year Classes for kindergarten through fifth graders, which offer farm and garden education, exploration of the wilderness preserve, Ohlone Indian education, and Summer Wilderness Camps for children in grades one through nine which encourage exploration of the preserve and hands-on learning. Deer Hollow Farm is supported through the organization Friends of Deer Hollow Farm.http://deerhollowfarmfriends.org/ This organization's mission is to support the farm as a working homestead as well as support environmental and historical education that benefits community members. FODHF was formed in 1994. As the last working homestead in Silicon Valley, it is important that it be preserved and maintained. Friends of Deer Hollow Farm supports Deer Hollow Farm by providing educational classes that deal with the area's history. These classes cover the Ohlone Indian history of the area. Before the Spanish arrived in the West, the Rancho San Antonio land preserve was occupied by the Ohlone Tribe. FODHF carries on their traditions and their history with the land through their education programs. There are over 100,000 visitors to Deer Hollow Farm each year, and 5,000 local children participate in the variety of camps and activities offered year round. The extent to which visitors utilize the open space preserve shows how important it is to the Silicon Valley community. Recreation The of hiking trails in Rancho San Antonio are very popular with walkers, hikers, and joggers. Full parking lots are the norm on weekend mornings. Most of the County Park is between 400 and 500 feet of elevation, so most trails in the park are on level ground. Walkers of all ages use most of these trails. The Open Space Preserve goes from about 400 feet to almost 2800 feet at Black Mountain, with much longer trails, providing more strenuous hikes and runs. The park and open space preserve contain various hikes such as the Chamise Trail which leads to the Duveneck Windmill Pasture Area and connects to the Black Mountain Trail which climbs to the summit of Black Mountain. Other trails provide shorter easier loops. Five picnic tables with charcoal bar-b-q stands are located at the south end of the North Meadow in the County Park. Non-gas powered RC model aircraft enthusiasts use the South Meadow in the County Park next to the second parking lot. Bicycles are restricted to designated trails only - basically pavement only, no dirt trails - and are not permitted west of Deer Hollow Farm. Within the County Park, equestrians are allowed on the equestrian staging area, the PG&E; Trail, and the Hammond-Snyder Loop Trail. Almost all miles of trails in the Open Space Preserve are open equestrians. = Access & Parking = The easternmost entrance to the County Park is from North Foothill Blvd, on Cristo Rey Drive. Parking for this entrance is on Cristo Rey Drive on either side of Kring Way / Cristo Rey Pl. further west on Cristo Rey Drive is the main entrance to the park, with about 300 spaces in five parking lots, plus room for several horse trailers in the first lot. The Rhus Ridge parking lot has about 15 spaces but no room for horse trailers. Pedestrian access is also available at Mora Drive and Ravensbury Avenue in Los Altos Hills as well as Black Mountain Trail from Monte Bello Open Space Preserve. The Quarry Trail crosses private property on a district easement. =Facilities= At the first parking lot there is a water fountain and horse watering trough. A building with flush toilets and water fountain opened in the \\"Equestrian\\" parking lot in late 2018. Water fountains are also located at the last parking lot in the County Park, near the 5 picnic tables in the North Meadow, and at Deer Hollow Farm. Flush toilets are located at the last parking lot. Pit toilets are just beyond Deer Hollow Farm. Otherwise, no potable water or toilets are available past Deer Hollow Farm.

With two exceptions, each half-hour- long show consisted of two comedy segments, each a spoof of a familiar action/anthology format. The style of the comedy was somewhat similar to that of films like Airplane! and TV shows like Police Squad! Robert Vaughn was the host for each episode, introducing to camera each fifteen-minute segment with mock earnestness. The jokes ranged from humorous or preposterous dialogue to visual gags and slapstick designed to poke fun at the serious dramatic formats being lampooned. The score for the series was composed by Lalo Schifrin. Danger Theatre ran for seven episodes before cancellation, but was syndicated beyond the United States, airing in the United Kingdom on the BBC in 1994.  The Searcher  One segment in each episode centered on a motorbike-riding, leather-clad hero called only “The Searcher\\", played by Diedrich Bader. A spoof of both the stereotypical motorbiking renegade from movies and the “one man on a mission” format of series such as Knight Rider, Renegade, and many others, this segment is perhaps the most commonly remembered element of the series. The Searcher would always appear coming over the horizon on his motorcycle, with a dramatic backing chorus, narrating : A recurring visual gag would have the Searcher conclude a scene with a quizzical stare directly at camera, utter a thoughtful, sound, and then suddenly be squashed by a vehicle or falling object. The popularity of this segment led to two of Danger Theatres seven episodes (\\"Go Ahead, Fry Me\\" and \\"An Old Friend For Dinner\\") being given over in their entirety to a 30-minute adventure for the Searcher.  Tropical Punch  In four episodes of Danger Theatre, the other segment of the show was called \\"Tropical Punch\\", a send-up of Hawaii Five-O, with Adam West playing the bumbling Detective Morgan, a police detective with no clue as to what is really going on. Morgan only solves crimes because his partner McCormick, played by Billy Morrisette, does in fact know what is going on and saves him from failure constantly.  357 Marina del Rey  In the final telecast of Danger Theatre on August 22, 1993, \\"Tropical Punch\\" was replaced by a segment entitled \\"357 Marina del Rey\\", which starred Todd Field as Rake Rowe and Ricky Harris as Clay Gentry in a spoof of shows about private detectives living and working in sun-and-fun vacation locales, such as 77 Sunset Strip, Surfside Six, and Hawaiian Eye. Recent college graduates Rowe and Gentry become private investigators and encounter the worst criminals in town, but take a greater interest in wearing the right fashions and visiting the local cappuccino bar than in solving crimes.

Reconstructed meiping The Tiger Cave Kiln and other associated ceramic ware sites have come under the control of Hangzhou Southern Song Guan Kiln Museum located in the west area of Turtle Hill of Yuhuang Mountain in Hangzhou, providing a detailed appreciation of the history and aesthetics of some of China's most celebrated ceramics; the museum also contains many ceramics of other origins. In 1127, under pressure from invading Jurchens, the Northern Song court was driven south of the Yangtze River and in 1138 established a new capital at Hangzhou, in modern Zhejiang province (Chu Yen 1977) (Kerr 2004). The move to the south resulted in the abandonment or decline of kilns used to make ceramic wares for the northern court, above all Ru ware, but by 1149 two new kilns had been built at Hangzhou to make porcelain for the newly established Southern Song court (Kerr 2004); the first kiln under the control of the Xiuneisi (Department of Palace Supply) and the second near to the Jiaotanxia (Altar of Heaven) (Chu Yen 1977). The location of the Jiaotanxia kiln was finally established by excavations carried out between 1984 and 1986; but the location of the Xiuneisi kiln remained unknown until excavations started in 1998 at the Tiger Cave kiln site provided confirmation that this was the hitherto unidentified Xiuneisi kiln (Kerr 2004). Excavations at the site Fragmentary double layer vase From 1998 to 2001 the Hangzhou Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology [杭州市文物考古所] excavated the Laohudong (Tiger Cave) Kiln. The results have rewritten Chinese ceramic history and solved mysteries that have haunted the field for literally hundreds of years. Excavated shards fall within the historical range of the Southern Song (1127-1279) to the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). The Southern Song celadon sherds show clearly that the Tiger cave Kiln was the ceramic production site for Southern Song Guan (official) ware. Tiger Cave is a seven hundred meter area located between Phoenix Mountain and Nine Flowers Mountain. The site is not more than a hundred meters from the north wall area of the Southern Song Imperial City area. Likewise it is two and a half miles from another Song production area known as the Jiaotanxia Kiln [郊坛下窑]. The discovery of the Kiln site took place on September 20, 1996 after an extensive archeological search of the area. Southern Song shards display shapes that correspond to ritual vessels such as celadon vases and incense burners. Clearly the original objects were intended for palace use. The shards are primarily of a powder blue color. Next in number are those of a honey tint. The celadon shards display a rich thick glaze with prominent crackle and crazing. Clearly the kiln site is the long lost Official Ceramic Ware site referred to in historical texts as the Xiuneisi Official Ware Kiln [修内司窑]. The Mongol Period strata of the archaeological site perhaps solves another long standing ceramic history mystery i.e. that of Ge ware. After the fall of the Southern Song court and the unification of the Chinese nation under Mongol rule the Tiger Kiln maintained production. A portion of the ceramic production of this period continued to be celadon ware in the official (guan) ware style. This conforms to period historical references. Southern Song guan wares The Percival David Foundation has in its collection, now in the British Museum on loan, a number of pieces that some scholars believe were made at the Xiuneisi (Department of Palace Supply) kiln; a kiln which has now been identified as the Laohudong (Tiger Cave) kiln.

Early life Strong was the third son of the Rev. David Strong and Margaret Paterson, née Roxburgh, and was born at Dailly, Ayrshire, Scotland. Strong was educated at the Ayr Academy, Glasgow Academy, and in Arts and Divinity at the University of Glasgow 1859–67 (hon. LL.D., 1887). John Caird had become Professor of Divinity in 1863 and was the principal influence on Strong. Caird was known as an attractive preacher but his theology was much influenced by G.W.H. Hegel, the German idealist philosopher. After some months experience as a private tutor 1867, Strong was licensed as a preacher on 2 October 1867 and became an assistant at Dalmellington, Ayrshire. On 7 October 1868 he was ordained to the Old North Kirk at Greenock which was then a chapel under the oversight of the Old West Kirk. On 16 March 1871 he was inducted to Anderston Parish Church in Glasgow where Professor Caird also attended. In 1872 Strong married Janet Julia Fullarton (daughter of Archibald Fairrie Denniston); they would have three daughters and five sons together. Australia In May 1875 Strong was chosen as pastor for the Scots' Church, Collins Street Melbourne, replacing Irving Hetherington. Strong and his family arrived on 23 August 1875. Strong's ministry was a success and he became known as one of the leading preachers in Melbourne. He emphasised practical Christianity. The Scots' Church Convalescents' Aid Society was formed in 1879, followed by the Scots' Church District Association in 1881. Its major work was the care of neglected children (continued today as Kildonan Uniting Care). He was also a pacifist. Strong's liberal views on theological matters, however, led to suspicion by some in the Presbyterian Church. In 1880 attention was called in the presbytery to a paper submitted by Strong titled \\"The Atonement\\" which appeared in the Victorian Review; a committee appointed to investigate the article reported that some passages required explanation. The charges appeared to some to have been tenuous, one of his principal accusers said of one passage that \\"the words were perfectly harmless in themselves but conveyed an impression of unsoundness to his mind\\". By most they were seen as inadequate given his obligation to assert, maintain and defend the doctrine of the Presbyterian Church. Of course Strong had come from a relatively liberal Church of Scotland to a church that was the result of a union in 1859 including Free Church of Scotland and United Presbyterian ministers. What might have passed in Scotland without great upheaval was likely to take a different turn in Victoria, whose Presbyterian Assembly was chaired by hard- line fundamentalist Moderator John Gardner. With continuing friction in the presbytery, Strong tendered his resignation on 8 August 1881; however he agreed to take six months leave instead at the request of church officers and the congregation. Strong left his family in Melbourne and visited Scotland from March to October 1882 after a speech by a Scots Church elder, J. C. Stewart, reignited attacks on him. On Strong's return to Melbourne he was admonished by the presbytery for supporting the opening of the Public Library and Art Gallery on Sundays. With George Selth Coppin in 1883, Strong promoted lodging-houses. In August 1883 Strong was chairman at a meeting of the Scots' Church Literary Association when Judge Higinbotham gave a lecture on 'Science and Religion', and Strong was attacked again. At the meeting Strong dissociated himself front some of Higinbotham's statements, and later on replied to them in a sermon. Strong was, however, charged with promulgating unsound and heretical doctrine and he resigned from the Presbyterian Church of Victoria, and as minister of the Scots' Church, although by the law of the church these could not be accepted while charges were pending. On 14 November 1883 a large number of his friends met at the Melbourne Town Hall to express their sympathy with Strong and to present him with a cheque for £3000 (at least $500,000 in today's values). At 9 pm. that evening he received a summons from the Presbyterian assembly to attend a meeting by 11 pm. and disavow all complicity with the doctrines of the lecture and declare his faith in the true deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, the propitiatory character of his death and the real resurrection of his body from the dead. Strong, who was on the eve of his departure to Europe declined to attend, and the assembly passed a motion the day after his departure declaring him no longer a minister of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria, by a vote of 136 to 6. Strong regarded the assembly's ...proceedings as unconstitutional and illegal. Strong returned to Melbourne in October 1884; in November 1885 the Australian Church was founded and he was invited become its first minister. A large church was built in Flinders Street, Melbourne, and for several years Strong had a congregation of about 1,000, but was in trouble in the 1890s. Strong accepted William Edward Addis, a former Glasgow classmate, as assistant minister in 1888. However, Strong and Addis had different views on theology, politics, economics and society; Addis did not seek reappointment and left Australia early in 1893. For various reasons, including difficulties with his assistants, the economic situation and Strong's sympathy for the manual workers, the richer members of his congregation dropped away and in 1922 a smaller church was built in Russell Street. Strong ministered there to the end of his life, in his last years accepting no salary. Strong founded the first crèche in Australia at Collingwood, one of the poorer suburbs of Melbourne, was an earnest supporter of the Anti-Sweating League, the Criminology Society, the Peace Society, and other organisations for social reform. Strong was unselfish; when an admirer left him £250 he immediately sent it to Dr Maloney for his milk for children fund. Late life and legacy Still active in mind and body, Strong died after a fall at Lorne, Victoria, on 12 February 1942, aged 97. Strong was survived by five sons and two daughters. Strong's published works included Unsectarian Services for Use in Schools and Families (1888), Church Worship (1892), Christianity Re-interpreted and other Sermons (1894), and various separate addresses and sermons. From 1887 until his death Strong edited a monthly periodical known variously as Our Good Words (1887–89), The Australian Herald (1889–1908) and The Commonweal (1908–42). Strong received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from the University of Glasgow for his thesis upon the \\"Doctrine of the Atonement\\". Strong always claimed \\"that he was neither an iconoclast nor an innovator. Changes were taking place in modern thought and if he prepared his people for them it was that they might be strengthened in the faith\\". External links * Rev.

Special education In December 2010, the Exeter Township School District administration reported that 779 pupils or 17.7% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 49% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the District administration reported that 758 pupils or 17.2% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 52.2% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-11 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department. The Exeter Township School District provides a variety of types and levels of supports for students with physical and intellectual disabilities. These Support Programs include: Speech and Language Support, Vision Support, Hearing Support, Learning Support, Emotional Support, and Life Skills Support. Levels of support include Itinerant, Resource Room, Part-time, and Full-time. In some instances, arrangements are made for students to attend classes in neighboring districts, Berks County Intermediate Unit classes, or at an Approved Private special education schools for profoundly disabled children. Services and transportation are all paid for by the school district with some funds annually provided by the state and the federal government. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. The Exeter Township School District received a $1,775,958 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011–12 and 2012-13 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= Exeter Township School District Administration reported that 297 or 6.76% of its students in 2010 were identified as gifted. In 2009, 202 or 4.57% of its students received gifted services. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness are also considered for eligibility like consistently advanced classroom achievement.

Pennsylvania public school district reserve funds are divided into two categories – designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 District Tuition Students who live in the District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Exeter Township School District.

This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, the district applied for and received $490,989 in addition to all other state and federal funding. Exeter Township School District uses the funding to provide: Literacy and math coaching to improve instruction, teacher training, full-day kindergarten and reduced class size K-3rd grade. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. The Exeter Township School District did not apply to participate in 2006-07. In 2007-08, the district was denied funding by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The district received $188,223 in 2008-09.

Race to the Top grant Exeter Township School District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided over one half million dollars in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Race To The Top Webinar powerpoint for districts December 2009, December 9, 2009 Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2012-13 were set by the Exeter Township School Board at 30.1031 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2011-12 - 29.9820 mills. *2010-11 - 29.624 mills *2009-10 - 28.6180 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports, 2010 *2008-09 - 27.7840 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports 2008-09 Real Estate Mills, 2009 *2007-08 - 25.8250 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-07 - 23.5000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-06 - 22.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 The average yearly property tax paid by Berks County residents amounts to about 4.66% of their yearly income. Berks County is ranked 112th of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax-rates.org., County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above that Index unless they either: allow voters to vote by referendum or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011-12 school year, the Exeter Township School Board applied for 4 exception to exceed the Act 1 Index: teacher pension costs, special education costs, School Construction Academic Project and Grandfathered school construction debt.. Each year, the Exeter Township School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. Extracurriculars The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, costly sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association regulations. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. =Sports= The District funds: ;Boys: *Baseball - AAAA *Basketball- AAAA *Bowling - AAAA *Cross Country - AAA *Football - AAAAA *Golf - AAA ç *Lacrosse - AAAA *Soccer - AAA *Swimming and Diving - AAA *Tennis - AAA *Track and Field - AAA *Volleyball - AAA *Wrestling - AAA *Water Polo - ;Girls: *Basketball - AAAA *Bowling - AAAA *Cross Country - AAAA *Golf - AAA *Field Hockey - AAAA *Indoor Track and Field - AAAA *Lacrosse - AAAA *Soccer (Fall) - AAA *Softball - AAAA *Swimming and Diving - AAA *Girls' Tennis - AAA *Track and Field - AAA *Volleyball - AAA *Water Polo - ;Junior High School Sports: ;Boys: *Baseball *Basketball *Cross Country *Football *Indoor Track and Field *Lacrosse *Soccer *Swimming and Diving *Track and Field *Wrestling ;Girls: *Basketball *Cross Country *Field Hockey *Indoor Track and Field *Lacrosse *Soccer *Softball *Swimming and Diving *Track and Field *Volleyball According to PIAA directory July 2012 Places of interest Daniel Boone Homestead References * GreatSchools web site * Standard and Poors School Matters web site External links * Exeter Township School District Homepage * Exeter Community Education Foundation Category:School districts in Berks County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Exeter Township School District"},{"id":"10506525","text":"\\"Have Mercy Baby\\" is a popular rhythm and blues song, written by Billy Ward and Rose Marks, recorded by The Dominoes in Cincinnati, produced by Ralph Bass, and released by Federal Records in 1952. It was Number One on the R&B; Charts for ten non consecutive weeks. Description Clyde McPhatter's roots were in the black church. The song is essentially the gospel song \\"Have Mercy, Jesus\\" sung in the call-and-response style of a gospel quartet, although it is in the straight twelve-bar blues form that gospel singers disdained. In the first chorus McPhatter simply follows the melody, but subsequently he freely improvises in the gospel style with short but spectacular melismas, stringing out phrases to overlap the backup singers responses, interjecting screams and yeahs, shouting a gospel funk. The backup band lays down the rhythm and provides the expected tenor sax solo. Impact The Dominoes' version of \\"Have Mercy Baby\\" was the definitive rhythm and gospel record. Influenced by the group's lead singer Clyde McPhatter, its importance lies in that it was the first popular R&B; recording highlighting passionate black gospel music features. Cover Versions Other significant recordings of the song were made by: *The Bobbettes (1960), *The Rivingtons (1962) *James Brown (1964), whose version charted #92 Pop.White, Cliff (1991). \\"Discography\\".

History The company was founded in 1906 in Schwabing as the private troupe of Erich Ziegel. Beginning in 1917, Otto Falckenberg served as director; in 1926, he moved the company into the Schauspielhaus, (built in Art Nouveau style in 1901 by Richard Riemerschmid and Max Littmann). Since 1933, the Münchner Kammerspiele has been a municipal theater company of the City of Munich. In 1961, the Werkraumtheater has served as its second stage. In 2001, the company gained a rehearsal stage next to the Schauspielhaus in a large building designed by Gustav Peichl. Directors Since the 1920s, the Münchner Kammerspiele has presented numerous world premieres, including works by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Frank Wedekind, and Bertolt Brecht. Brecht, Bruno Hübner, Axel von Ambesser, Fritz Kortner, Peter Stein, Franz Xaver Kroetz, Robert Wilson, George Tabori, Erwin Faber, Max Schreck, and other important actors and writers have staged plays with the company, often resulting in awards. Artistic leadership One famous producing-director (Intendant) of the Münchner Kammerspiele was Falckenberg (1917–1944). Known as an expert in Expressionism in Germany during the Weimar Republic, he was credited with producing or directing many celebrated productions at the company, including Brecht’s first staged play, Drums in the Night, in 1922, as well as works by Wedekind, August Strindberg, and William Shakespeare. Since the end of World War II in 1945, artistic leadership has been in the hands of Erich Engel (1945–1947), Hans Schweikart (1947–1963), August Everding (1963–1973), Hans-Reinhard Müller (1973–1983), Dieter Dorn (1983–2001), and Frank Baumbauer (2001–2009).

Listed at , 165 lb., Tucker was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed. Tucker was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts, where he started his baseball career playing for the Springfield and Newark clubs. He was a flashy first baseman in an era when using two hands was normal, making one-handed scoops of wild throws and pick-ups with his small glove, in contrast to the big-sized gloves employed by today's first basemen. He entered the majors in 1887 with the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association, playing for them three years before joining the National League with the Boston Beaneaters (1890–1897), Washington Senators (1897), Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1898), St. Louis Browns (1898) and Cleveland Spiders (1899). His most productive season came in 1889 with Baltimore, when he led the AA hitters with a .372 batting average (still the highest league-leading average ever for a switch-hitter) and 196 hits. His .372 average was 118 points above the Baltimore team average of .254. In a 13-season career, Tucker was a .290 hitter (1882-for-6479) with 42 home runs and 932 RBI in 1687 games, including 1084 runs, 240 doubles, 85 triples, 352 stolen bases, and a .364 on-base percentage. Tucker had the reputation of being one of the toughest players of his era. He was notorious for hip- checking a base runner off first base, and then tagging them out. Tucker died in Montague, Massachusetts.

It was named after Kali, the Hindu goddess of destruction, a reference to the very fragmentary nature of its remains. The type species of Kalisuchus is K. rewanensis, which refers to the Rewan Group. The Arcadia formation is dated to the Induan age at the very beginning of the Triassic, making Kalisuchus one of the oldest archosauromorphs known in Australia.  Description  The holotype of Kalisuchus is a partial left maxilla, QM F8998. Although many other fragmentary bones from the Arcadia Formation were referred to the genus, the lack of overlap between these bones and the holotype makes these referrals dubious. One of the referred bones, QM F9521, was originally believed to be an unusual jugal but was subsequently interpreted as a right pterygoid similar to that of erythrosuchids and Sarmatosuchus. The anterior process of the maxilla is very short, similar to that of erythrosuchids. The ascending process is tall and vertical, creating a front edge of the antorbital fenestra which is only gently concave, as opposed to the strongly concave edge in other basal archosauriforms. The ascending process also thins transversely towards the tip. Similar to proterosuchids and Fugusuchus, there is no antorbital fossa separating the antorbital fenestra from the rest of the maxilla. The maxilla as a whole curves outwards very slightly, although to a lesser extent than in Proterosuchus. The lower edge of the medial (inside) surface of the maxilla is convex, while the palatal process is strongly downturned at the front. Although most of the teeth are poorly preserved, those which can be identified are unusually ankylothecodont (placed in deep sockets and fused to the bone), but also compressed, recurved, and serrated on the rear edge and the distal part of the front edge, as in most other carnivorous archosauriforms. The maxillary morphology of Kalisuchus seems intermediate between the semiaquatic crocodile-like proterosuchids and the robust terrestrial erythrosuchids. The strongly downturned palatal process of the maxilla may have been evidence for a strongly downturned snout, as in proterosuchids, and it may have had a similar niche and biology. Its body length is estimated at about 3 meters.  Classification  Thulborn (1979) considered it a proterosuchid closely related to Proterosuchus. However, Ezcurra (2016) found that Proterosuchidae was a mostly paraphyletic group of basal archosauriforms. Although the presence of interdental plates in QM F8998 made Ezcurra consider Kalisuchus to be more advanced than proterosuchids, the large number of tooth sockets (14) preserved in the maxilla forced Kalisuchus to be excluded from the clade containing more advanced archosauriforms, such as the erythrosuchids.

(Pol. i. 24.) Diodorus, in relating the events of the same campaign, mentions the capture of a town called \\"Sittana\\", for which we should in all probability read \\"Hippana\\". (Diod. xxiii. 9.; Cluver. Sicil. p. 392.) The correctness of the name found in Polybius is confirmed by Stephanus of Byzantium (s. v.), who, however, writes it , but cites Polybius as his authority. It sat astride the main road from Panormus (modern Palermo) to Agrigentum (modern Agrigento) upon Monte dei Cavalli, in the modern comune of Prizzi. Some manuscripts of Pliny mention the name of Ipanenses in his list of Sicilian towns. (iii. 8. s. 14. § 91), where the older editions have Ichanenses. If this reading be adopted, it in all probability refers to the same place as the Hippana of Polybius; but as the reading Ichanenses is also supported by the authority of Stephanus (who notices Ichana as a town of Sicily), the point must be considered doubtful.

History Hall, Russell and Co brass plaque Brothers James and William Hall, Thomas Russell, a Glasgow engineer, and James Cardno Couper founded the company in 1864 to build steam engines and boilers. In 1867 the company built its first ship, the Kwang Tung, for the Imperial Chinese Navy. Like most shipyards of their era, Hall Russell built ships first using iron and later changing to steel. In 1944–45 Hall, Russell built five coasters under sub-contract for the Burntisland Shipbuilding Company of Fife: hull numbers 773, 776, 781, 785 and 788. In 1956–57 Hall, Russell built two more coasters for Burntisland: hull 750 launched as SS Winga and hull 857 launched as William Cory & Son's MV Corsea. In 1977 the company became part of the nationalised British Shipbuilders Corporation, before being returned to the private sector in 1986. Having been placed in receivership in 1988, it came under the ownership of A&P; Appledore International in 1989, as A&P; Appledore International (Aberdeen). However, it had been classed by the Government as a naval shipbuilder, despite traditionally producing fishing vessels and small cargo ships, and closed in 1992. In the Second World War Hall Russell built a number of Royal Navy s and s. After the war the company built fishing vessels, cargo ships and naval patrol craft. The last vessel completed at the yard was the , launched in 1989 and delivered in 1990. The most widely known ship built by Hall Russell was MV Sir William Hardy. Launched in 1955, she was the first diesel-electric all-refrigerated trawler built in the UK. Refurbished by Greenpeace, she was renamed on 29 April 1978 the Rainbow Warrior. She was bombed by French agents in New Zealand 10 July 1985. Her masts currently stand outside the Dargaville Museum in the upper North Island, New Zealand.

Before this, alien empires held sway over the region, and the nucleus of power was outside modern Karnataka. The medieval era can be broadly divided into several periods: The earliest native kingdoms and imperialism; the successful domination of the Gangetic plains in northern India and rivalry with the empires of Tamilakam over the Vengi region; and the domination of the southern Deccan and consolidation against Muslim invasion. The origins of the rise of the Karnataka region as an independent power date back to the fourth-century birth of the Kadamba Dynasty of Banavasi, the earliest of the native rulers to conduct administration in the native language of Kannada in addition to the official Sanskrit. This is the historical starting point in studying the development of the region as an enduring geopolitical entity and of Kannada as an important regional language. In the southern regions of Karnataka, the Western Gangas of Talakad were contemporaries of the Kadambas. The Kadambas and Gangas were followed by the imperial dynasties of the Badami Chalukya Empire, the Rashtrakuta Empire, the Western Chalukya Empire, the Hoysala Empire and the Vijayanagara Empire, all patronising the ancient Indic religions while showing tolerance to the new cultures arriving from the west of the subcontinent. The Muslim invasion of the Deccan resulted in the breaking away of the feudatory Sultanates in the 14th century. The rule of the Bahamani Sultanate of Bidar and the Bijapur Sultanate from the northern Deccan region caused a mingling of the ancient Hindu traditions with the nascent Islamic culture in the region. The hereditary ruling families and clans ably served the large empires and upheld the local culture and traditions. The fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 brought about a slow disintegration of Kannada-speaking regions into minor kingdoms that struggled to maintain autonomy in an age dominated by foreigners until unification and independence in 1947. Kadambas and Gangas Kadamba tower at Doddagaddavalli Kadamba Empire, 500 CE. Prior to and during the early centuries of the first millennium, large areas of the Karnataka region was ruled by such imperial powers as the Mauryas of Maghada and later the Satavahanas, empires whose centres of power were in the Gangetic plains and Central India respectively. With the weakening of the Satavahanas, the Pallavas of Kanchi took control for a brief duration.Ramesh (1984), pp1–3 In the 4th century, the rise to power of the Kadamba Dynasty of Banavasi identified the Karnataka region as an independent political entity and Kannada as an administrative language from the middle of the 5th century.From the Halmidi inscription (Ramesh 1984, pp10–11) The Kadambas were natives of the Talagunda region (in modern Shivamogga district) as proven by inscriptions.The Kadambas were Kanarese speaking dravidians inducted into the Brahmin fold (Moraes 1931, p11)Their local tribal origins is attested by the Talagunda inscription, R.N. Nandi in Adiga (2006), p93Ramesh (1984), p3Some inscriptions claim the Kadambas came from a Naga descent (snake worshippers) making them natives of Karnataka region, Moraes (1931), p10Kamath (2001), p30 Mayurasharma, a Brahmin native of Talagunda who was humiliated by a Pallava guard, rose in rage against the Pallava control of the Banavasi region and declared his independence in 345.From the Talagunda inscription (B.L. Rice in Kamath 2001, pp 30–31)Ramesh (1984), 1984, p6Moraes (1931), p10 After many wars, the Pallava king had to accept the sovereignty of the Kadambas and Mayurasharma, the founding king, crowned himself at Banavasi (in the present day Uttara Kannada district).Chopra (2003), p161, part1; Kamath (2001), p30 Western Ganga Territories, 800 CE. The fact that the Kadambas cultivated marital ties with the imperial Vakatakas and Gupta dynasties attests to their power.Moraes (1931), p26 Kakusthavarma, the most powerful ruler of the dynasty whom inscriptions describe as \\"ornament of the Kadamba family\\" and \\"Sun among the kings of wide spread flame\\", gave one daughter in marriage to Vakataka Narendrasena and another to Skandagupta, grandson of Chandragupta II of the Gupta dynasty.From the Talagunda inscription (Moraes 1931, pp26–27)From the Balaghat inscription of Vakataka Prithvisena (Kamath 2001, p33) Historians trace their rise to political power through the examination of the contemporaneous Sanskrit writing, Aichitya Vichara Charcha by Kshemendra, which quotes portions of a writing Kunthalesvara Dautya by the famous poet Kalidasa. Here Kalidasa describes his visit to the Kadamba kingdom as an ambassador where he was not offered a seat in the court of the Kadamba king and had to sit on the ground. Historians view this act as one of assertion by the Kadambas who considered themselves equal to the imperial Gupta dynasty.Moraes, Desai and Panchamukhi in Kamath (2001), p33 Roof relief sculpture, Jain Panchakuta basadi at Kambadahalli. Family feuds and conflicts ended the Kadamba rule in the middle of the 6th century when the last Kadamba ruler Krishna Varma II was subdued by Pulakeshin I of the Chalukya feudatory, ending their sovereign rule. The Kadambas would continue to rule parts of Karnataka and Goa for many centuries to come but never again as an independent kingdom.Chopra (2003), p162, part1; Kamath (2001), p35 Some historians view the Kadambas as the originators of the Karnataka architectural tradition although there were elements in common with the structures built by the contemporaneous Pallavas of Kanchi.Moraes in Kamath (2001), p37 The oldest surviving Kadamba structure is one dating to the late 5th century in Halsi in modern Belgaum district. The most prominent feature of their architectural style, one that remained popular centuries later and was used by the Hoysalas and the Vijayanagar kings, is the Kadamba Shikara (Kadamba tower) with a Kalasa (pot) on top.Kamath (2001), p38 The Western Ganga Dynasty, contemporaries of the Kadambas, came to power from Kolar but in the late 4th century - early 5th century moved their capital to Talakad in modern Mysore district.Chopra (2003), p159, part1; Kamath (2001), p40 They ruled the region historically known as Gangavadi comprising most of the modern southern districts of Karnataka. Acting as a buffer state between the Kannada kingdoms of Karnataka region and the Tamil kingdoms of Tamilakam, the Western Ganga architectural innovations show mixed influences.The impact of the Pallava, early Chalukya and a distinct Jain influence added to their own innovations are the main features of their architectural idiom (Reddy, Sharma and Rao in Kamath 2001, p50) Their sovereign rule ended around the same time as the Kadambas when they came under the Badami Chalukya control. The Western Gangas continued to rule as a feudatory till the beginning of the eleventh century when they were defeated by the Cholas of Tanjavur.Chopra (2003), p160, part1 Important figures among the Gangas were King Durvinita and Shivamara II, admired as able warriors and scholars,Narasimhacharya (1988), p2 and minister Chavundaraya who was a builder, a warrior and a writer in Kannada and Sanskrit.Narasimhacharya (1988), p18Chopra (2003), pp159-160, part1; Kamath (2001), p50 The most important architectural contributions of these Gangas are the monuments and basadis of Shravanabelagola, the monolith of Gomateshwara termed as the mightiest achievement in the field of sculpture in ancient Karnataka and the Panchakuta basadi ( five towers) at Kambadahalli.Kamath (2001), pp51–52 Their free standing pillars (called Mahasthambhas and Brahmasthambhas) and Hero stones (virgal) with sculptural detail are also considered a unique contribution.Fergusson in Kamath (2001), p52 Badami Chalukyas Badami Chalukya Empire during the reign of Pulakeshin II, 640 CE. The Chalukya dynasty, natives of the Aihole and Badami region in Karnataka, were at first a feudatory of the Kadambas.N. Laxminarayana Rao and S. C. Nandinath in Kamath 2001, p57Keay (2000), p168 Jayasimha and Ranaraga, ancestors of Pulakeshin I, were administrative officers in the Badami province under the Kadambas (Fleet in Kanarese Dynasties, p343), (Moraes 1931, p51)Thapar (2003), p328Quote:\\"They belonged to the Karnataka country and their mother tongue was Kannada\\" (Sen 1999, p360); Kamath (2001), p58, They encouraged the use of Kannada in addition to the Sanskrit language in their administration.Considerable number of their records are in Kannada (Kamath 2001, p67)7th century Chalukya inscriptions call Kannada the natural language (Thapar 2003, p345) In the middle of the 6th century the Chalukyas came into their own when Pulakeshin I made the hill fortress in Badami his center of power.Sen (1999), p360 During the rule of Pulakeshin II a south Indian empire sent expeditions to the north past the Tapti River and Narmada River for the first time and successfully defied Harshavardhana, the King of Northern India (Uttarapatheswara). The Aihole inscription of Pulakeshin II, written in classical Sanskrit language and old Kannada script dated 634,In this composition, the poet deems himself an equal to Sanskrit scholars of lore like Bharavi and Kalidasa (Sastri 1955, p312Kamath (2001), p59 proclaims his victories against the Kingdoms of Kadambas, Western Gangas, Alupas of South Canara, Mauryas of Puri, Kingdom of Kosala, Malwa, Lata and Gurjaras of southern Rajasthan. The inscription describes how King Harsha of Kannauj lost his Harsha (joyful disposition) on seeing a large number of his war elephants die in battle against Pulakeshin II.Keay (2000), p169Sen (1999), pp361-362Kamath (2001), pp59–60Some of these kingdoms may have submitted out of fear of Harshavardhana of Kannauj (Majumdar in Kamat 2001, p59)The rulers of Kosala were the Panduvamshis of South Kosala (Sircar in Kamath 2001, pp59) Badami Cave Temples No 3.(Vishnu) These victories earned him the title Dakshinapatha Prithviswamy (lord of the south). Pulakeshin II continued his conquests in the east where he conquered all kingdoms in his way and reached the Bay of Bengal in present-day Orissa. A Chalukya viceroyalty was set up in Gujarat and Vengi (coastal Andhra) and princes from the Badami family were dispatched to rule them. Having subdued the Pallavas of Kanchipuram, he accepted tributes from the Pandyas of Madurai, Chola dynasty and Cheras of the Kerala region. Pulakeshin II thus became the master of India, south of the Narmada River.Keay (2000), p170 Pulakeshin II is widely regarded as one of the great kings in Indian history.Kamath (2001), pp58Ramesh 1984, p76 Hiuen- Tsiang, a Chinese traveller visited the court of Pulakeshin II at this time and Persian emperor Khosrau II exchanged ambassadors.From the notes of Arab traveller Tabari (Kamath 2001, p60) However, the continuous wars with Pallavas took a turn for the worse in 642 when the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I avenged his father's defeat, conquered and plundered the capital of Pulakeshin II who may have died in battle.Sen (1999), p362 A century later, Chalukya Vikramaditya II marched victoriously into Kanchipuram, the Pallava capital and occupied it on three occasions, the third time under the leadership of his son and crown prince Kirtivarman II. He thus avenged the earlier humiliation of the Chalukyas by the Pallavas and engraved a Kannada inscription on the victory pillar at the Kailasanatha Temple.Thapar (2003), p331, p345Sastri (1955) p140Ramesh (1984), pp159–160Sen (1999), p364 He later overran the other traditional kingdoms of Tamil country, the Pandyas, Cholas and Keralas in addition to subduing a Kalabhra ruler.Ramesh (1984), p159 The Kappe Arabhatta record from this period (700) in tripadi (three line) metre is considered the earliest available record in Kannada poetics. The most enduring legacy of the Chalukya dynasty is the architecture and art that they left behind.Hardy (1995), p65-66 More than one hundred and fifty monuments attributed to them, built between 450 and 700, have survived in the Malaprabha basin in Karnataka.Over 125 temples exist in Aihole alone, The constructions are centred in a relatively small area within the Chalukyan heartland. The structural temples at Pattadakal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the cave temples of Badami, the temples at Mahakuta and early experiments in temple building at Aihole are their most celebrated monuments. Two of the famous paintings at Ajanta cave no. 1, \\"The Temptation of the Buddha\\" and \\"The Persian Embassy\\" are also credited to them. The Badami Chalukya introduced in the western Deccan a glorious chapter alike in heroism in battle and cultural magnificence in peace (K.V. Sounderrajan in Kamath 2001, p68 Further, they influenced the architecture in far off places like Gujarat and Vengi as evidenced in the Nava Brahma temples at Alampur.Kamath (2001), p68 Rashtrakutas Rashtrakuta Empire in 800 CE, 915 CE. In the middle of the 8th century the Chalukya rule was ended by their feudatory, the Rashtrakuta family rulers of Berar (in present-day Amravati district of Maharashtra). Sensing an opportunity during a weak period in the Chalukya rule, Dantidurga trounced the great Chalukyan \\"Karnatabala\\" (power of Karnata).From the Rashtrakuta inscriptions (Kamath 2001, p57, p64)The Samangadh copper plate grant (753) confirms that feudatory Dantidurga defeated the Chalukyas and humbled their great Karnatik army (referring to the army of the Badami Chalukyas) (Reu 1933, p54) Having overthrown the Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas made Manyakheta their capital (modern Malkhed in Gulbarga district).A capital which could put to shame even the capital of gods-From Karda plates (Altekar 1934, p47)A capital city built to excel that of Indra (Sastri, 1955, p4, p132, p146) Although the origins of the early Rashtrakuta ruling families in central India and the Deccan in the 6th and 7th centuries is controversial, during the eighth through the tenth centuries they emphasised the importance of the Kannada language in conjunction with Sanskrit in their administration. Rashtrakuta inscriptions are in Kannada and Sanskrit only. They encouraged literature in both languages and thus literature flowered under their rule.Altekar (1934), pp411–413Chopra (2003), p87, part1; Literature in Kannada and Sanskrit flowered during the Rashtrakuta rule (Kamath 2001, p73, pp 88–89)Even royalty of the empire took part in poetic and literary activities (Thapar 2003, p334)Reu (1933), pp37–38 Kailash Temple in Ellora Caves The Rashtrakutas quickly became the most powerful Deccan empire, making their initial successful forays into the doab region of Ganges River and Jamuna River during the rule of Dhruva Dharavarsha.Chopra (2003), p89, part1; His victories were a \\"digvijaya\\" gaining only fame and booty in that region (Altekar in Kamath 2001, p75) The rule of his son Govinda III signaled a new era with Rashtrakuta victories against the Pala Dynasty of Bengal and Gurjara Pratihara of north western India resulting in the capture of Kannauj. The Rashtrakutas held Kannauj intermittently during a period of a tripartite struggle for the resources of the rich Gangetic plains.Chopra (2003), p90, part1 Because of Govinda III's victories, historians have compared him to Alexander the Great and Pandava Arjuna of the Hindu epic Mahabharata.Keay (2000), p199) The Sanjan inscription states the horses of Govinda III drank the icy water of the Himalayan stream and his war elephants tasted the sacred waters of the Ganges River.Kamath 2001, p76 Amoghavarsha I, eulogised by contemporary Arab traveller Sulaiman as one among the four great emperors of the world, succeeded Govinda III to the throne and ruled during an important cultural period that produced landmark writings in Kannada and Sanskrit.Kavirajamarga in Kannada and Prashnottara Ratnamalika in Sanskrit (Reu 1933, p38)Kamath (2001), p90 The benevolent development of Jain religion was a hallmark of his rule. Because of his religious temperament, his interest in the arts and literature and his peace-loving nature,Chopra (2003), p91, part1 he has been compared to emperor Ashoka.Panchamukhi in Kamath (2001), p80 The rule of Indra III in the tenth century enhanced the Rashtrakuta position as an imperial power as they conquered and held Kannauj again.Chopra (2003), p92, part1; Altekar in Kamath 2001, p81 Krishna III followed Indra III to the throne in 939. A patron of Kannada literature and a powerful warrior, his reign marked the submission of the Paramara of Ujjain in the north and Cholas in the south.Chopra (2003), p92-93, part1 An Arabic writing Silsilatuttavarikh (851) called the Rashtrakutas one among the four principle empires of the world.Reu (1933), p39 Kitab-ul-Masalik-ul-Mumalik (912) called them the \\"greatest kings of India\\" and there were many other contemporaneous books written in their praise.Murujul Zahab by Al Masudi (944), Kitabul Akalim by Al Istakhri (951), Ashkal-ul-Bilad by Ibn Haukal (976) (Reu 1933, p41–42) The Rashtrakuta empire at its peak spread from Cape Comorin in the south to Kannauj in the north and from Banaras in the east to Broach (Bharuch) in the west.From the Sanjan inscriptions, While the Rashtrakutas built many fine monuments in the Deccan, the most extensive and sumptuous of their work is the monolithic Kailasanatha temple at Ellora, the temple being a splendid achievement.Keay (2000), p200 In Karnataka their most famous temples are the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal. All of the monuments are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Western Chalukyas Western Chalukya Empire in 1121 CE. In the late 10th century, the Western Chalukyas, also known as the Kalyani Chalukyas or 'Later' Chalukyas rose to power by overthrowing the Rashtrakutas under whom they had been serving as feudatories. Manyakheta was their capital early on before they moved it to Kalyani (modern Basavakalyan). Whether the kings of this empire belonged to the same family line as their namesakes, the Badami Chalukyas is still debated.Chopra (2003), p137, part1Fleet, Bhandarkar and Altekar and Gopal B.R in (Kamath 2001, p100) Whatever the Western Chalukya origins, Kannada remained their language of administration and the Kannada and Sanskrit literature of their time was prolific.Narasimhacharya (1988), p68, p17–21Sen (1999), p. 393Sastri (1955), pp356-358; Kamath (2001), p114More inscriptions in Kannada are attributed to the Chalukya King Vikramaditya VI than to any other king prior to the 12th century, Tailapa II, a feudatory ruler from Tardavadi (modern Bijapur district), re-established the Chalukya rule by defeating the Rashtrakutas during the reign of Karka II. He timed his rebellion to coincide with the confusion caused by the invading Paramara of Central India to the Rashtrakutas capital in 973.From the 957 and 965 records (Kamath 2001, p101)Sastri 1955, p162Tailapa II was helped in this campaign by the Kadambas of Hanagal (Moraes 1931, pp 93–94) This era produced prolonged warfare with the Chola dynasty of Tamilakam for control of the resources of the Godavari River-Krishna River doab region in Vengi. Someshvara I, a brave Chalukyan king, successfully curtailed the growth of the Chola Empire to the south of the Tungabhadra River region despite suffering some defeatsGanguli in Kamath 2001, p103Sastri (1955), p167–168 while maintaining control over his feudatories in the Konkan, Gujarat, Malwa and Kalinga regions.Kamath (2001), p104 For approximately 100 years, beginning in the early 11th century, the Cholas occupied large areas of South Karnataka region (Gangavadi).Sastri (1955), p164, p174; The Cholas occupied Gangavadi from 1004 to 1114 (Kamath 2001, p118) Western Chalukya art. In 1076, the ascent of the most famous king of this Chalukya family, Vikramaditya VI, changed the balance of power in favour of the Chalukyas.Chopra (2003), p139, part1 His fifty-year reign was an important period in Karnataka's history and is referred to as the \\"Chalukya Vikrama era\\".Thapar, 2003, pp 468–469 His victories over the Cholas in the late 11th and early 12th centuries put an end to the Chola influence in the Vengi region permanently. Some of the well-known contemporaneous feudatory families of the Deccan under Chalukya control were the Hoysalas, the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri, the Kakatiya dynasty and the Southern Kalachuri. At their peak, the Western Chalukyas ruled a vast empire stretching from the Narmada River in the north to the Kaveri River in the south. Vikramaditya VI is considered one of the most influential kings of Indian history.Poet Bilhana in his Sanskrit work wrote \\"Rama Rajya\\" regarding his rule, poet Vijnaneshwara called him \\"A king like none other\\" (Kamath 2001, p106)Sastri (1955), p6 Important architectural works were created by these Chalukyas, especially in the Tungabhadra river valley, that served as a conceptual link between the building idioms of the early Badami Chalukyas and the later Hoysalas.Sastri (1955), pp 427-428; Quote:\\"Their creations have the pride of place in Indian art tradition\\" (Kamath 2001, p115)Quote:\\"Of the city of Kalyana, situated in the north of Karnataka nothing is left, but a fabulous revival in temple building during the 11th century in central Karnataka testifies to the wealth during Kalyan Chalukya rule\\"(Foekema (1996), p14) With the weakening of the Chalukyas in the decades following the death of Vikramaditya VI in 1126, the feudatories of the Chalukyas gained their independence. The Kalachuris of Karnataka, whose ancestors were immigrants into the southern deccan from central India, had ruled as a feudatory from Mangalavada (modern Mangalavedhe in Maharashtra).Kamath (2001), p107 Bijjala II, the most powerful ruler of this dynasty, was a commander (mahamandaleswar) during the reign of Chalukya Vikramaditya VI.From the 1142 and 1147 records, Kamath (2001), p108 Seizing an opportune moment in the waning power of the Chalukyas, Bijjala II declared independence in 1157 and annexed their capital Kalyani.Chopra (2003), p139, part1; From the Chikkalagi records (Kamath 2001, p108) His rule was cut short by his assassination in 1167 and the ensuing civil war caused by his sons fighting over the throne ended the dynasty as the last Chalukya scion regained control of Kalyani. This victory however, was short-lived as the Chalukyas were eventually driven out by the Seuna Yadavas.Chopra (2003), p140, part1; Kamath (2001) p109 Hoysalas Hoysala Empire in 1200 CE. The Hoysalas had become a powerful force even during their rule from Belur in the 11th century as a feudatory of the Chalukyas (in the south Karnataka region).Sen (1999), p498 In the early 12th century they successfully fought the Cholas in the south, convincingly defeating them in the battle of Talakad and moved their capital to nearby Halebidu.Sen (1999), p499Vishnuvardhana made many military conquests later to be further expanded by his successors into one of the most powerful empires of South India—William Coelho. He was the true maker of the Hoysala kingdom—B.S.K. Iyengar in Kamath (2001), p124–126 Historians refer to the founders of the dynasty as natives of Malnad Karnataka, based on the numerous inscriptions calling them Maleparolganda or \\"Lord of the Male (hills) chiefs\\" (Malepas).B.L.Rice in Kamath (2001), p123Keay (2000), p251Thapar (2003), p367Kamath (2001), p123Natives of south Karnataka (Chopra, 2003, p150 Part1) With the waning of the Western Chalukya power, the Hoysalas declared their independence in the late twelfth century. Shilabalika, Chennakeshava Temple, Belur. During this period of Hoysala control, distinctive Kannada literary metres such as Ragale (blank verse), Sangatya (meant to be sung to the accompaniment of a musical instrument), Shatpadi (seven line) etc. became widely accepted.Shiva Prakash in Ayyappapanicker (1997), pp164, 203; Rice E. P. (1921), p59Kamath (2001), pp132–134Sastri (1955), p359, p361 The Hoysalas expanded the Vesara architecture stemming from the Chalukyas,Sastri (1955), p427 culminating in the Hoysala architectural articulation and style as exemplified in the construction of the Chennakeshava Temple at Belur and the Hoysaleshwara Temple at Halebidu.Sen (1999), pp500–501 Both these temples were built in commemoration of the victories of the Hoysala Vishnuvardhana against the Cholas in 1116.Foekema (1996), p14Kamath (2001), p124 Veera Ballala II, the most effective of the Hoysala rulers, defeated the aggressive Pandya when they invaded the Chola kingdom and assumed the titles \\"Establisher of the Chola Kingdom\\" (Cholarajyapratishtacharya), \\"Emperor of the south\\" (Dakshina Chakravarthi) and \\"Hoysala emperor\\" (Hoysala Chakravarthi).The most outstanding of the Hoysala kings according to Barrett and William Coelho in Kamath (2001), p126 The Hoysalas extended their foothold in areas known today as Tamil Nadu around 1225, making the city of Kannanur Kuppam near Srirangam a provincial capital. This gave them control over South Indian politics that began a period of Hoysala hegemony in the southern Deccan.B.S.K. Iyengar in Kamath (2001), p126Keay (2000), p252 In the early 13th century, with the Hoysala power remaining unchallenged, the first of the Muslim incursions into South India began. After over two decades of waging war against a foreign power, the Hoysala ruler at the time, Veera Ballala III, died in the battle of Madurai in 1343.Sen (1999), p500 This resulted in the merger of the sovereign territories of the Hoysala empire with the areas administered by Harihara I, founder of the Vijayanagara Empire, located in the Tungabhadra region in present-day Karnataka. The new kingdom thrived for another two centuries with Vijayanagara as its capital.Two theories exist about the origin of Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I. One states that they were Kannadiga commanders of the Hoysala army and another that they were Telugu speakers and commanders of the earlier Kakatiya Kingdom (Kamath 2001, pp 159–160) Vijayanagara Empire Vijayanagara Empire in 1446 CE, 1520 CE. The Vijayanagara Empire quickly rose to imperial status as early as the late 14th century. During the reign of Bukka Raya I, the island of Lanka paid tributes and ambassadors were exchanged with the Ming Dynasty of China.Sastri (1955), p241Chopra (2003), p28, part2Indicated by records of the Ming dynasty (Kamath 2001, p162) The empire's most famous rulers were Deva Raya II and the Tuluva king Krishnadevaraya. Deva Raya II (known as Gajabetekara or hunter of elephants) ascended the throne in 1424 and was the most effective of the Sangama dynasty rulers.Sastri (1955), p244Chopra (2003), p32, part2 He quelled rebelling feudal lords, the Zamorin of Calicut and the Quilon in the south, and invaded the island of Lanka while becoming overlord of the kings of Burma at Pegu and Tanasserim.Chopra (2003), p32, part2; From the notes of Persian Abdur Razzak. Writings of Nuniz confirms that the kings of Burma paid tributes to Vijayanagara empire (Sastri 1955, p245)Kamath (2001), p164 After a brief decline, the empire reached its peak in the early 16th century during the rule of Krishnadevaraya when the Vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious. The empire annexed areas formerly under the Sultanates in the northern Deccan and the territories in the eastern Deccan, including Kalinga, while simultaneously maintaining control over all its subordinates in the south.Chopra (2003), pp37-39, part2; The notes of Portuguese Barbosa during the time of Krishnadevaraya confirms a very rich and well provided Vijayanagara city (Kamath 2001, p186) Stone Chariot Hampi Many important monuments at Hampi were either completed or commissioned during the reign of Krishnadevaraya. The enduring legacy of this empire is the vast open-air theatre of monuments at the regal capital, Vijayanagara, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage site. Vijayanagara architecture is a vibrant blend of the preceding Chalukya, Hoysala, Pandya and Chola styles.Chopra (2003), p177, part2; Art critic, Percy Brown calls Vijayanagar architecture a blossoming of Dravidian style-Kamath (2001), p182 Literature in Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Sanskrit languages found royal patronage. Telugu attained its height in popularity and reached its peak under Krishnadevaraya.Chopra (2003), pp171-173, part2; Kamath (2001), pp181–182 The Kannada Haridasa movement contributed greatly to Carnatic music and fostered a strong Hindu sentiment across South India.Owing to his contributions to carnatic music, Purandaradasa is known as Karnataka Sangita Pitamaha. With the defeat of the Vijayanagara Empire in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by the Deccan sultanates, the Karnataka region and South India in general became fragmented and subsumed under the rule of various former feudatories of the empire. A diminished Vijayanagara Empire moved its capital to Penukonda in modern Andhra Pradesh and later to Chandragiri and Vellore before disintegrating. In the south and coastal Karnataka region, the Kingdom of Mysore and the Keladi Nayaka of Shimoga held sway while the northern regions were under the control of the Bijapur Sultanate.Kamath (2001), p174 The Nayaka kingdom lasted into the 18th century before merging with the Kingdom of Mysore which remained a princely state until Indian independence in 1947, though they came under the British Raj (rule) in 1799 following the defeat and death of the last independent Mysore king, Tipu Sultan. Bahmani Sultanate Bahmani Sultanate territories, 1470. The Bahmani Sultanate, a contemporary of the Vijayanagara Empire, was founded in 1347 by Alla-ud-din-Hasan, a breakaway commander of the armies of the northern invaders led by Mohammed-bin-Tughlaq. The capital was Gulbarga but was later moved further north to Bidar in 1430.Chopra (2003), p53, part2; Kamath (2001), p190 The first of the Muslim invasions of the Deccan came in the early decades of the 14th century. At its peak, the Bahamani kingdom extended from the Krishna River in the south to Penganga River in the north, thus covering the regions of northern parts of modern Karnataka, parts of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. The most famous of the Bahamani Kings was Firuz Shah (also known as Taj Ud Din Firuz), who ruled from 1397 to 1422.Chopra (2003), pp56-57, part2; Kamath (2001), p191 Militarily, the rule of Firuz Shah had uneven success against the Vijayanagara kings while he was more convincingly successful against the Kherla rulers of Madhya Pradesh and the Vema Reddies of Rajamundry, areas that he annexed in 1417. His last encounter with the Vijayanagara armies in 1417 was disastrous and led to his defeat, ill health and ultimate death in 1422. Contemporary writers such as Tabataba, in his writings have heaped praise on Firuz Shah. Tabataba wrote of the king as, \\"[a]n impetuous, mighty monarch who patronised learned men, Sheiks and hermits\\", while Shirazi described him as \\"a just, pious and generous king and one without equal\\". He has earned the honorific Sultan-i- ghazian for his bravery, tolerant nature and patronage of the fine arts.Chopra (2003), p57, part2; Kamath (2001), p192 In the opinion of one historian, Firuz Shah was one of the most notable Sultans to rule in India.Sinha in Kamath (2001), p192 Another well-known figure from this kingdom was Kwaja Mahamud Gavan, the prime minister, who served under several kings and regents. He rose above the kings and princess of the dynasty by virtue of his ministerial, administrative, martial, literary and philanthropic abilities. A Persian by descent and a visitor to Bidar in 1445, he impressed the ruling Sultan Alla- ud-din II and was chosen to become a minister in his court. As a commander he was able to extend the kingdom from Hubli in the south to Goa in the west and Kondavidu and Rajamahendri in the east. He soon rose to the position of prime minister (Vakil-Us-Sultanat).Chopra (2003), p63, part2; Kamath (2001), p195 The Bahamanis introduced the large-scale use of paper in administration and began the Indo-Sarasenic architectural style, designed and constructed by Persian architects and artisans, (also known as Deccani architecture) with its local influences in Karnataka.Chopra (2003), pp181-182, part2; Kamath (2001), p198 The Sultanate monuments of Bidar and Gulbarga are testimony to their interest in architecture. The Bande Nawaz tombs and a Jama Masjid in Gulbarga which exhibits a Spanish influence are well known. In Bidar, their buildings have Persian, Turkish, Arabic and Roman influences (the Solah Khamba mosque being an example).Kamath (2001), p198 Rangin Mahal, Gangan Mahal, Tarkash Mahal, Chini Mahal, Nagina Mahal and the Taqk Mahal are some of the palaces built by them that have retained their beauty. The Ahmad Shah Wali tombs are noted for their decor, and the school of learning (madrasa) built by Gavan in Bidar (1472), with its lecture halls, library, mosque and residential houses are also famous.Chopra (2003), p182, part2; Kamath (2001), p199 In the later part of the 15th century, with a growing rift between the local Deccani Muslims and the Pardeshi Muslims (foreign) who occupied influential positions in the kingdom, the execution of Gavan under dubious circumstances in 1481, and constant wars with the Vijayanagara kings weakened the Bahamani Kingdom eventually bringing about its end in 1527.Chopra (2003), p62, pp64-65, part2; Kamath (2001), p194 Bijapur Sultanate Bijapur Sultanate territories under Ibrahim II, 1620 CE. The Bijapur Sultanate (or Adilshahi Kingdom) emerged towards the end of the 15th century with the weakening of the Bahmani Sultanate . The main sources of information about this kingdom comes from contemporaneous inscriptions and writings in Persian and Kannada, travelogues of European visitors to the Deccan and inscriptions of neighbouring kingdoms.Kamath (2001), p200 In 1489, Yusuf Adilkhan, a Turkic general in the Bahmani army, broke away to found the kingdom from modern Bijapur . Throughout his rule, the Sultanate was at war with the Vijayanagara Empire over the strategic Raichur doab, with the Portuguese over Goa, with the Barid Shahis of Bidar and later with the erstwhile feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire who had gained independence after 1565. The Italian writer Varathema wrote about the founder Adilkhan and Bijapur, \\"A powerful and prosperous king\\", \\"the city was encircled by many fortifications and contained beautiful and majestic buildings\\". Inter-Sultanate marriages normalised relations and Ali I (1557–1580) joined a confederacy of Sultanates who eventually inflicted a crushing defeat on the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565.Kamath (2001), p201 The most notable ruler of the dynasty was Ibrahim II (1580–1626) who ascended the throne as a nine-year-old with Chandbibi, the king's aunt acting as the regent. Later when Ibrahim II was defeated by the first of the Moghul incursions into the Deccan, he gave his daughter in marriage to Daniyal, a son of Emperor Akbar, but managed to collect tributes from the former feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire.Kamath (2001), p202 According to a historian, the rule of Ibrahim II was the high point of the Bijapur Sultanate.Sinha in Kamath (2001), p2002 A tolerant king inclined to the fine arts, the earliest book on music in Urdu language called Kitab-e-Nauras is ascribed to him. The opening song in the book is an invocation of the Hindu Goddess Saraswati. During the rule of his son Muhammad, Shahji Bhosle from Ahmadnagar joined the Bijapur army and along with commander Ranadullah Khan conducted many successful campaigns in the southern Deccan collecting tribute from local rulers there. The final end of the diminished Vijayanagara Empire ruling from Vellore came during these campaigns.Kamath (2001), p203 Gol Gumbaz at Bijapur, has the second largest pre-modern dome in the world after the Byzantine Hagia Sophia. However, the rise of Maratha Shivaji and constant invasions by the Mughals from the north took its toll on the kingdom, eventually bringing it to an end in the later part of the 17th century. The contributions of the Bijapur Sultanate in the Indo-Saracenic idiom to the architectural landscape of Karnataka is noteworthy. Their most famous monuments are the mausoleums called Ibrahim Rauza and the Gol Gumbaz apart from many other palaces and mosques.Kamath (2001), p207 The elegance, finish and beauty of Mehtar Mahal is claimed by a historian to be equal to anything in Cairo.Fergusson in Kamath (2001), p207 Their Kali Masjid at Lakshmeshwar is a synthesis of Hindu and Muslim styles. The Ibrahim Rauza built by Ibrahim II is a combination of a mausoleum and a mosque and is called the \\"Taj Mahal of the Deccan\\".Fergusson in Kamath (2001), p208 The Gol Gumbaz built by Muhammad is the largest dome in India and the second largest pre-modern dome in the world after the Byzantine Hagia Sophia with an impressive \\"whispering gallery\\". Some historians consider this one of the architectural marvels of the world.Kamath (2001), p209 Persian language was given state patronage while the use of the local languages, Kannada and Marathi was popularised in local affairs.Kamath (2001), p206 Modern era Kingdom of Mysore under Tipu Sultan. Mysore Palace at dusk (Indo-Saracenic style). The fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 at the Battle of Talikota started a slow disintegration of the Kannada speaking region into many short-lived palegar chiefdoms, and the better known Kingdom of Mysore and the kingdom of Keladi Nayakas, which were to later become important centres of Kannada literary production.Nagaraj in Pollock (2003), p370; Kamath (2001), p171, p174 These kingdoms and the Nayakas (\\"chiefs\\") of Tamil country continued to owe nominal support to a diminished Vijayanagara Empire ruling from Penukonda (1570) and later from Chandragiri (1586) in modern Andhra Pradesh, followed by a brief period of independence.Subrahmanyam (2001), pp67-68; Kamath (2001), pp173-174 By the mid-17th century, large areas in north Karnataka came under the control of the Bijapur Sultanate who waged several wars in a bid to establish a hegemony over the southern Deccan.Chopra (2003), p96, part2; Kamath (2006), pp173-174 The defeat of the Bijapur Sultanate at the hands of the Mughals in late 17th century added a new dimension to the prevailing confusion.Chopra (2003), pp101; Kamath (2006), p204 The constant wars of the local kingdoms with the two new rivals, the Mughals and the Marathas, and among themselves, caused further instability in the region.Kamath (2001), p226 Major areas of Karnataka came under the rule of the Mughals and the Marathas. Under Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan, the Mysore Kingdom reached its zenith of power but had to face the growing English might who by now had a firm foothold in the subcontinent.Chopra (2003), p71, part3; Kamath (2001), p231–234 After the death of Tipu Sultan in 1799 in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war, the Mysore Kingdom came under the British umbrella.Chopra (2003), pp80-81, part3 More than a century later, with the dawn of India as an independent nation in 1947, the unification of Kannada speaking regions as modern Karnataka state brought four centuries of political uncertainty (and centuries of foreign rule) to an end.

In Japan, it is known as Star Strike HD. In 2015, a port for the PlayStation 4, called Super Stardust Ultra, was released. In 2016, Super Stardust Ultra VR, a PlayStation VR compatible version that contains Super Stardust Ultra, was released for the PlayStation 4. It is also available as paid downloadable content for Super Stardust Ultra. The game combines the mechanics of Asteroids and Robotron: 2084 with a level of action found typically in modern games such as Geometry Wars. The game is an enhanced version of Super Stardust for the Amiga. Super Stardust HD was one of the games given for free by Sony as part of their 'Welcome Back' package due to the PlayStation Network outage in 2011. Super Stardust HD was the first title with trophy support on the PlayStation 3. A version for PlayStation Portable titled Super Stardust Portable (Star Strike Portable in Japan) was released in November 2008, and a PlayStation Vita game building on Super Stardust HD, called Super Stardust Delta was released in 2012.  Gameplay  In Super Stardust HD, the player controls a space fighter craft that can move in any direction on a spherical shield surrounding a planet, while simultaneously firing in any direction independent of its movement. The primary threats against the player are three types of asteroids and various enemy spacecraft, which appear on the playfield at certain time intervals. The ship is equipped with three upgradeable weapons, a limited arsenal of bombs, and a boost capability that grants temporary invincibility and recharges after use. Each weapon is more effective against certain types of asteroid and enemies than others. Items include weapon upgrades and a shield that absorbs one fatal hit against the player's ship. Super Stardust HD provides several modes of play, each with their own online leaderboards. The default game mode, Arcade, takes the player through a series of five planets, each consisting of five main phases, the last of which is a boss battle. Planet Mode allows the player to play any one of five planets in the same way, ending the game after the planet is complete. Both of these modes support both single-player and two-player cooperative play.  Updates and downloadable content packs  The Solo add-on pack (released in April 2008 and available for download via the PlayStation Store) adds several extra gameplay modes. Endless Mode pits the player against a continuous onslaught of rocks and enemies, gradually speeding up the action over time. Survival Mode challenges the player to last as long as possible while the playfield is filled with indestructible objects. Bomber Mode challenges players to score as many points as they can using only bombs and a single life – primary weapons and the boost ability are disabled. Time Attack mode challenges the player to complete a planet's worth of rocks and enemies in the shortest time possible – losing a life in this mode incurs a 3-minute penalty. The PSP version also received its own version of the Solo add-on pack, with only the Endless, Survival and Bomber modes, along with two new soundtracks. The Japanese version of the PSP game already comes with this pack. With the release of game update version 2.40 on July 2, 2008, PlayStation trophy support was added to the title. This made Super Stardust HD the first title with trophy support on the PlayStation 3. A total of 17 trophies are available for the game. The Team Pack was also released on July 2, 2008, which includes split-screen co-op and player versus player modes. The pack also offers an additional orchestral soundtrack in 5.1 surround and the ability to customize the player ship's appearance. The Team Pack was available for purchase from within the game and via the PlayStation Store before being removed with the 2.40 firmware. It was reinstated on July 15, 2008, in a store update after Sony's E3 press conference. Stereoscopic 3D support was demonstrated at the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show and released in June in the same year. Super Stardust HD is the first 3D game for the PS3 that runs at 720p resolution at 60 frames per second for each eye (120 frames per second). The original 2D version supports full 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second. Impact Mode, released in April 2011 on the PlayStation Store, introduces much higher score multipliers. With weapons disabled in Impact Mode, the primary mode of attack is a modified version of the ship's boost capability, which remains active as long as there are targets to attack nearby. Super Stardust Ultra A follow-up to the game titled Super Stardust Ultra (known in Japan as Star Strike Ultra) was released on February 10, 2015 in North America and the PAL region on February 11, 2015 for PlayStation 4. It was essentially an enhanced version of Super Stardust HD, without being a direct port. It adds an exclusive mode called Interactive Streaming, which is an endless mode where the game is streamed live over the Internet, and viewers are allowed to help or hinder the player. A port of Super Stardust Ultra titled Super Stardust Ultra VR, offering a unique perspective from within the cockpit, was released as a launch title for the PlayStation VR. The title was developed by UK based company d3t Ltd.  Reception and sales  The HD edition of Super Stardust received \\"favorable\\" reviews, while the Portable, Ultra, and its VR version received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where the Ultra version was ported for release on March 12, 2015, Famitsu gave it a score of one eight, one seven, one nine, and one eight for a total of 32 out of 40. In 2013, the game entered IGN's Top 25 PlayStation Network Games list in the 4th position. Super Stardust HD has sold approximately 400,000 units for the PS3 as of September 2010.

It unites more than 700 religious leaders of the mainstream synagogue communities in Europe. It was founded in 1956 on the initiative of British Chief Rabbi Sir Israel Brodie, in order to revive the vanquished Jewish communities on the European mainland. Brodie was supported by the chief rabbi of France, Jacob Kaplan, the chief rabbi of Amsterdam, Aharon Schuster and the British Sephardic spiritual leader, Hacham Gaon. The first conference took place in 1957 in Amsterdam. As a result of the CER union with the rabbinates of the stronger western European orthodox communities, the vast majority of mainstream communities throughout the continent retained Orthodox affiliation and rabbinical leadership (with the exception of Hungary and Sweden where non-Orthodox groups had a strong prior presence). Even as some major Western European communities were deliberating joining non-Orthodox movements in the post WWII period, the strong rabbinical alliance was successful in ensuring an Orthodox rabbinate and securing the continuity of the orthodox rite even where the larger part of the membership had unfortunately become secularized. The organization is run by a standing committee of 35 members which convenes twice a year for working meetings and policy assessments in one of the European capitals. These conventions are combined with a visit to the local Jewish community and institutions, and meetings with the government and other bodies for strengthening ties and cooperation on matters of local and pan-European Jewish significance. The Standing Committee members are in general, the chief rabbis of European countries and major cities and senior rabbinical judges. The entire CER membership assembles once every two years at a general convention to which all European chief rabbis and congregational rabbis are invited. The Conference of European Rabbis is mandated to defend the religious rights of Jews in Europe, and has become the voice of Judaism for the European continent. The CER has recently been involved with defending the rights of Jews to slaughter animals for consumption according to Jewish law and the right to circumcise their children. The CER also functions as a rabbinical authority, with expert committees to certify conversions and kashruth (kosher) operations and to pass rabbinical legal decisions affecting the broader Jewish community. The CER has always been the expert address for European Jewish communities and rabbis for support in the facilitation of their religious functions, recruitment of rabbis and educators and other issues. The CER has a special department for the planning, engineering and building of mikvehs (ritual baths) which has fulfilled over a dozen such projects all over Europe.. Personnel The current president of the CER is the chief rabbi of Moscow, Pinchas Goldschmidt, who served as chairman of the Standing Committee for over ten years. The vice president is Rabbi Bleich The Chief Rabbi of Ukraine. The chairman of the Presidium is associate president Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis. Before Rabbi Sitruk, the organization was headed by Rabbi Lord Dr Immanuel Jacobovits, Chief Rabbi of Great Britain. The Executive Director of the CER since inception was Rabbi Maurice (Moshe) Rose, succeeded in the year 2001 by Rabbi Aba Dunner, who died in 2011. In 2017 the Rabbinical Director Rabbi Moshe Lebel, Secretary Rabbi Aharon Shmuel Baskin and President of Association and Special Adviser of the Board of Patrons Mrs. Shorena Mikava . Daughter Organizations ;EEK :EEK kosher authority was established by the CER in order to maintain a golden standard of Kosher supervision and help local rabbis with the certification of kosher food. This organization collaborates with kosher authorities worldwide to provide recognized certification for the kosher consumer. ;Hulya :Established in 2010 in Luxembourg by then Chairman of the Standing Committee, Pinchas Goldschmidt, was created in order to assist with rabbinical training, communal development and teaching rabbis the skills necessary to work in a modern European environment. Hulya is primarily financed by the Matanel Foundation, Luxembourg, and has its offices in Luxembourg. ;European Beth Din :The European Beth Din was established over 15 years ago, as an initiative of the late Chief Rabbi Lord Jakobovits, who was then president of the Conference of European Rabbis. Responding to repeated requests from European communities where there was no functioning Rabbinical Court (Beth Din), the EBD was established to provide comprehensive Jewish legal services across a broad array of European cities. :The EBD is currently headed by Dayan Chanoch Ehrentreu who led the most distinguished UK Rabbinical Courts in London for 30 years and prior to that in Manchester. Dayan Ehrentreu is the undisputed senior Orthodox Halachic authority in Europe. In addition, the EBD employs Dayanim from established European Rabbinical Courts. :Whilst the EBD is based in Basle, Switzerland, it serves individuals and communities from the following countries: Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Turkey, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland. :Services include: Supervision of Jewish Religious Divorce, Dispute Arbitration Mediation, Supervision of Adoptions & Conversions, Communal Dispute Resolution. The EBD's website is EuropeanBethDin.com. ;Lo Tishkach :The Lo Tishkach European Jewish Cemeteries Initiative was established in 2006 as a joint project of the Conference of European Rabbis and the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany. It aims to guarantee the effective and lasting preservation of Jewish cemeteries and mass graves throughout the European continent. :This initiative, identified by the Hebrew phrase Lo Tishkach (‘do not forget’), is establishing a comprehensive publicly accessible database of all Jewish burial grounds in Europe, currently featuring details on over 9,000 cemeteries and mass graves. The Lo Tishkach project is also producing a compendium of the different national and international laws and practices affecting these sites, to be used as a starting point to advocate for the better protection and preservation of Europe’s Jewish heritage. :A key aim of the project is to engage young Europeans, bringing Europe’s history alive, encouraging reflection on the values that are important for responsible citizenship and mutual respect, giving a valuable insight into Jewish culture and mobilising young people to care for our common heritage. The project uses Jewish cemeteries – a physical legacy of formerly vibrant Jewish communities – as the focus of a practical activity and learning programme to meaningfully transmit to younger generations the lessons of the Holocaust. :Groups of young people trained by Lo Tishkach have already begun to visit thousands of Jewish burial sites across Europe. These groups gather vital information on local Jewish life, history and culture, photograph and survey each cemetery, and undertake practical work to help preserve and protect these important sites.

In 1905, Duggan was appointed to the Argentine Legation in London where the family thereafter moved. Together, they were the parents of three children, two sons and a daughter: * Alfred Duggan (1903–1964), a historical novelist who was the best-selling historical novelist during the 1950s. * Hubert Duggan (1904–1943), who later became a British Member of Parliament and married Joan Dunn, the daughter of Sir James Dunn. * Grace Duggan (1907–1995), who married Edward Rice, and was the mother of Caroline Helen Rice (b. 1931), wife of Robert Windsor-Clive, 3rd Earl of Plymouth.

A member and twice minister of the Democratic Party (PD), he joined the Social Democratic Party in 2003, and was again a minister in 2004. Niculescu-Duvăz was a member of the Chamber of Deputies between 1990 and 2016. Biography =Early life= Born in Bucharest, he graduated from the Ion Mincu Institute in 1977, and subsequently worked as architect for the Urban Planning Institute in Tulcea, then as a designer for the Bucharest Home Appliances Research Institute, and ultimately as a designer of lighting appliances for the Carpaţi Institute. Profile at the Chamber of Deputies site He entered politics in early 1990, in the wake of the Romanian Revolution, joining the National Salvation Front (FSN), becoming its Secretary and, in 1991, Vice President. In January 1990, Niculescu-Duvăz also joined the provisional governing body (the Provisional National Unity Council, CPUN), as a simple member. =Career= In the 1990 elections, he won a seat in the Chamber, representing Bucharest. He became a Minister of Youth and Sport in the second Petre Roman cabinet (June 1990), resigning his position in the Chamber in late July. In early 1992, following the September 1991 Mineriad and Roman's resignation from office, Niculescu-Duvăz joined the latter in creating the opposition wing of the FSN, which was to become the PD in 1993. After briefly serving on the Bucharest City Council in early 1992, Niculescu- Duvăz was reelected to the Chamber in the 1992 and 1996 suffrages, representing Constanţa County, and served on the Chamber Committee for Public Administration and Territorial Improvement. He joined Victor Ciorbea's coalition government, created around the Romanian Democratic Convention, holding the office of Minister for Relations with Parliament (1996-1998). He was the PD's Vice President, and, during the elections of 2000, its campaign coordinator. Also in 2000, Niculescu-Duvăz was again elected a deputy for Constanţa County, and was delegated to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, briefly serving on several of its Commissions.

Former President Emil Constantinescu alleged, in 2005 and 2006, that his successor and former PD president Traian Băsescu had been a member of Communist Romania's secret police, the Securitate, and contended that, together with Petre Roman and Victor Babiuc, Niculescu-Duvăz had witnessed Băsescu's acknowledgment that this was the case. \\"Lista lui Emil\\" (\\"Emil's List\\"), in Ziua, December 14, 2005 (hosted by kappa.ro) \\"Constantinescu: Dosarul preşedintelui Băsescu, distrus!\\" (\\"Constantinescu: 'President Băsescu's File - Destroyed!'\\") , in Gardianul, August 16, 2006 (hosted by kappa.ro) Constantinescu repeatedly asked for the three alleged witnesses to be summoned for a hearing with the CNSAS (the Council charged with investigating Securitate affiliations).

Reception Music critic Stewart Mason, writing for AllMusic, wrote of the album \\"RCA probably thought they were just signing the guy who wrote \\"Gentle on My Mind\\" when they signed John Hartford back in 1966, but his own albums just kept getting stranger and stranger during the late '60s, culminating in this bizarre piece of orchestrated country-tinged art rock from 1969\\" Music critic Robert Christgau rated the album a D+ on his scale and wrote \\"Hartford is an engaging singer and an excellent songwriter, but the production and arrangements on this record are criminal... and the material very thin...\\" Track listing All tracks written by John Hartford. =1969 release= #\\"Dusty Miller Hornpipe and Fugue in A Major for Strings, Brass and 5-String Banjo\\" – 2:12 #\\"I've Heard That Tearstained Monologue You Do There By the Door Before You Go\\" – 3:48 #\\"The Collector\\" – 3:21 #\\"A Short Sentimental Interlude\\" – 1:08 #\\"Mr. Jackson's Got Nothing to Do\\" – 2:44 #\\"Open Rode Ode\\" – 2:32 #\\"Little Piece in D\\" – 2:52 #\\"The Poor Old Prurient Interest Blues\\" – 2:45 #\\"The Wart\\" – 0:59 #\\"Railroad Street\\" – 2:19 #\\"Another Short (But Not So Sentimental) Interlude\\" – 0:43 #\\"Orphan of World War II\\" – 2:43 #\\"The Little Old Lonesome Little Circle Song\\" – 1:49 #\\"I Didn't Know the World Would Last This Long\\" – 3:52 =2002 release= All tracks written by John Hartford, except where noted. #\\"Dusty Miller Hornpipe and Fugue in A Major for Strings, Brass and 5-String Banjo\\" – 2:12 #\\"I've Heard That Tearstained Monologue You Do There By the Door Before You Go\\" – 3:48 #\\"The Collector\\" – 3:21 #\\"A Short Sentimental Interlude\\" – 1:08 #\\"Mr. Jackson's Got Nothing to Do\\" – 2:44 #\\"Open Rode Ode\\" – 2:32 #\\"Little Piece in D\\" – 2:52 #\\"The Poor Old Prurient Interest Blues\\" – 2:45 #\\"The Wart\\" – 0:59 #\\"Railroad Street\\" – 2:19 #\\"Another Short (But Not So Sentimental) Interlude\\" – 0:43 #\\"Orphan of World War II\\" – 2:43 #\\"The Little Old Lonesome Little Circle Song\\" – 1:49 #\\"I Didn't Know The World Would Last This Long\\" – 3:52 #*Tracks 1 to 14 originally appeared on the 1969 release John Hartford. #\\"Like Unto a Mockingbird\\" – 2:12 #\\"Meanwhile You Sit by My Banjo\\" – 3:48 #\\"I Won't Know Why I Went Till After I Get Back\\" – 3:21 #\\"Maybe\\" – 1:08 #\\"Go Home Girl\\" – 2:44 #\\"Natural to Be Gone\\" – 2:32 #\\"Before They Tow My Car Away\\" – 2:52 #\\"To Say\\" – 2:45 #\\"Frustrated Bird\\" – 0:59 #\\"Hey Jude\\" (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) – 2:19 #*Tracks 15 to 24 appeared on the original 1970 release of Iron Mountain Depot. #\\"Skippin' in the Mississippi Dew\\" – 2:28 #\\"Self Made Man\\" – 3:53 #\\"In Tall Buildings\\" – 3:12 #\\"And the Band Played On\\" – 4:07 #\\"Orange Blossom Special\\" (Ervin T.

It was the first World Showcase attraction to feature Disney characters based on an existing property. Norway followed suit in 2014 when it closed its Maelstrom ride to make room for Frozen Ever After, which opened in 2016. Synopsis The attraction begins with posters indicating that the Three Caballeros are to perform a concert tonight. After boarding the boats, guests float around the Mayan pyramid and volcano in the back of the pavilion's main room. Soon, guests enter a tunnel on the side of the pyramid, where Panchito Pistoles and José Carioca of The Three Caballeros introduce themselves, only to find out that Donald Duck, the third member of the group, has run off, prompting Panchito and José to set off on a frantic search for their missing friend. The next few scenes show Donald touring Mexico and José and Panchito on a magic sarape (a sort of Mexican flying poncho) looking for him. The next scene has characters similar to 'It's a Small World' with dancing animatronics and a Donald Duck piñata. Once past this area, guests enter a cave, which features different scenes of live-action footage with the Caballeros. After leaving the cave, there are three panels featuring a Mariachi band in the first, some Mexican girls and Donald in the second and Panchito and José pulling Donald away from the girls in the third. From here, guests float into Mexico City, where fireworks are going off overhead and the Three Caballeros are finally performing their concert. Trivia *Panchito, the leader of the trio, is the only Mexican character of the three, as Donald has always been portrayed as a citizen of the United States while José is a Brazilian. In the movie, Panchito is often seen firing guns into the air and whooping, while José smokes cigars. As with Disney's House of Mouse, the characters were toned down for the ride and don't smoke or shoot. *With its dancing dolls and miniature movies, the ride is a hybrid of the aforementioned It's a Small World and the now defunct If You Had Wings. * On December 4, 2015, animatronics of the Three Caballeros from the Mickey Mouse Revue were placed into the attraction's finale. *Eric Goldberg, best known for animating the Genie in Aladdin, directed the animation for the ride.

The ARA Monsunen was actually a 326 ton British coaster vessel owned by the Falklands Islands Company that had been captured in the course of the Argentine invasion.

After a surrender order was radioed to the motorboat, another helicopter transporting a SBS team tried to intercept her. The aircraft was greeted with heavy machine gun and small arms fire, so it was forced to abort the mission.The improvised ship's gunners were an army sergeant and a conscript who served the 12.7 mm machine gun that shot at the Lynx. The Argentine crew claim that the helicopter's fuselage was hit by the tracer bullets.(Webpage with some photos of the ship and her crew) At the same time, the coastal ship's radar detected the British squadron about to stern and approaching aggressively. Almost immediately, HMS Yarmouth began to fire her 4.5-inch (114 mm) deck gun on the Argentine vessel, forcing her to manoeuvre in order to avoid the incoming rounds. When the distance fell to , Captain Gopcevich, the Argentine commander, decided that the only way to deceive the British radar was to beach the boat on Seal Cove, a large inlet nearby. Shortly after he succeeded in running aground his ship and ordering the crew to abandon her, the British shelling resumed. The fire was inaccurate and aimed at the general area of landing. In the process of evacuating the vessel, one of the ratings fell overboard and suffered some serious bruises, but he was successfully rescued by a young sailor.This serviceman was honored with the highest Argentine Congress decoration after the war.

(HMS Yarmouth: Captains Diary ) Monsunen was found by her complement at dawn, with her engine still running; apparently after refloating by the rising tide. However, a sling had become entangled with her propeller, disabling the transmission. With the ship's speed now dramatically reduced, Gopcevich radioed for help to Stanley.

It was adapted by William Goldman from his 1974 novel of the same title and stars Dustin Hoffman, Laurence Olivier, Roy Scheider, William Devane and Marthe Keller. In the film, \\"Babe\\" Levy, a graduate student (Hoffman), becomes embroiled in a plot by Nazi war criminal Christian Szell (Olivier) to retrieve stolen diamonds from a safety deposit box owned by Szell's dead brother. Babe becomes unwittingly involved due to his brother Doc's (Roy Scheider) dealings with Szell. The film was a critical and box office success, with Olivier earning an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Szell, the film's antagonist.  Plot  Thomas \\"Babe\\" Levy is a history Ph.D. student and an avid runner researching the same field as his father, H.V. Levy, who committed suicide after being investigated during the Joseph McCarthy era. Babe's brother, Henry, known as \\"Doc\\", poses as an oil company executive but is actually a government agent working for a secret agency headed by Peter Janeway (William Devane). One of Doc's jobs is to serve as a diamond courier for the infamous Nazi war criminal Dr. Christian Szell, in return for the latter's assistance in tracking down other Nazi war criminals. Szell is known as der weiße Engel (German for The White Angel) due to his prominent mane of white hair. A wanted war criminal, Szell is ensconced in South America and is living off a large cache of diamonds which he had taken from Jews killed at Auschwitz. The diamonds are kept inside a safe deposit box at a bank in New York City and are withdrawn as needed by Dr. Szell's brother. After Szell's brother is killed in a traffic accident, Szell feels that he can't trust anybody anymore and proceeds to try to have all of the diamond handlers and couriers murdered, including Doc himself. Escaping several murder attempts, Doc suspects that Szell will come to New York City to retrieve his valuable diamond collection. Doc comes to New York under the guise of a visit to Babe. Meanwhile, Babe and his new girlfriend, Elsa Opel, who claims to be from Switzerland, are mugged by two men dressed in suits. When Doc takes Babe and Elsa to lunch, he tricks Elsa into revealing that she has been lying to Babe about her background. Though Doc suspects she may be connected to Szell, he tells Babe that she is seeking an American husband so that she can become a U.S. citizen. After Szell arrives in America, Doc confronts him, stating that he shouldn't have involved Babe in these matters and that he himself is not to be trusted. Szell then takes Doc by surprise and stabs him with a blade concealed in his sleeve. Doc makes it back to Babe's apartment and dies. The police interrogate Babe until government agents, led by Janeway, arrive. Janeway asks Babe what Doc told him before he died, and tells Babe that his brother was a U.S. government agent. Babe insists that his brother did not tell him anything, but Janeway is convinced Doc would not have struggled all the way to Babe's apartment without giving him vital information. Babe is later abducted from his apartment by the two men who mugged him in the park, and he is tortured by Szell. During his torture, Babe is repeatedly asked, \\"Is it safe?\\", but he continues to deny any knowledge. Babe is then rescued by Janeway, who explains that Szell is in the U.S. to sell off his large cache of diamonds. Janeway presses Babe about Doc's dying words, but Babe still insists he knows nothing. Frustrated, Janeway reveals himself as a double agent and returns Babe to Szell. Still unable to extract anything from Babe, Szell drills into one of his healthy teeth. Babe eventually escapes, aided by his skills as a marathon runner. Babe phones Elsa, who agrees to meet him with a car. Arriving at her country home, Babe guesses that Elsa has set him up, forcing her to confess that the home was owned by Szell's deceased brother. Janeway and Szell's men arrive, but Babe takes Elsa hostage. Babe kills Szell's men as they attempt to shoot him. Janeway offers to let Babe kill Szell in revenge for Doc's death, if Janeway can have the diamonds. Babe agrees, but as he leaves, Janeway fatally shoots Elsa in revenge for her spoiling the plan to trap Babe and kill him in the house. Babe hears the gunfire outside the house and shoots Janeway through the window, killing him. Attempting to determine the value of his diamonds, Szell visits an appraiser in the Diamond District in midtown Manhattan. A shop assistant who is a Holocaust survivor believes he recognizes Szell as a war criminal. After Szell hurriedly leaves the shop, an elderly Jewish woman also recognizes him. Trying to cross the street to get closer to Szell, the woman is hit by a taxi, causing a crowd to assemble to aid her. Amidst the confusion, the shop assistant appears again, directly confronting Szell, who slits the man's throat. Szell retrieves his diamonds but, as he attempts to leave, Babe forces him at gunpoint into a water-treatment facility 2 miles away in South Gate House, Central Park. Babe tells Szell he can keep as many diamonds as he can swallow. Szell initially refuses, and Babe begins throwing the diamonds into the water. Szell relents and swallows one diamond, but then refuses to cooperate further. Szell releases the catch on his sleeve blade and tells Babe that both Babe's brother and father were weak, suggesting that Babe's father was some sort of spy like Doc, and that Szell had been involved with Babe's father's death. Babe throws the rest of the diamonds down the steps towards the water; Szell dives for them, but stumbles, and falls on his own knife blade, his dead body falling over a railing and into the water. Babe heads out into Central Park, stopping to throw his gun into the reservoir.

Production Goldman was paid a reported $500,000 for the film rights to his novel and to do a screenplay, before the novel had been published. (Another source said $450,000.) \\"The book reads like the movie-movie of all time\\", said producer Robert Evans. \\"I regard it as a cheap investment because you don't often find books that translate into film. This is the best thing I've read since The Godfather. It could go all, all the way – if we don't foul it up in the making.\\" Goldman estimated he wrote four versions of the screenplay and says Robert Towne was brought in at the end. Goldman says John Schlesinger only agreed to do the film because he had just finished The Day of the Locust and was \\"terrified he was dead in Hollywood.\\" Laurence Olivier was cast early on. However he had health problems, and at one stage, it was uncertain whether he would be able to do the film. Richard Widmark auditioned for the part, but Olivier eventually recovered and was able to participate in filming. Reportedly, Laurence Olivier and Dustin Hoffman did not get along well during filming. Olivier did not agree with Hoffman's style of Method Acting, which involved staying up days at a time to appear truly out of his mind and in physical pain for the film's famous torture scenes. \\"My dear boy.\\" Olivier is remembered as saying, \\"why don't you just try acting?\\" Marathon Man was the second feature film production in which inventor/operator Garrett Brown used his then-new Steadicam, after Bound for Glory. However, it was the first feature using the Steadicam that saw theatrical release, predating the premieres of both Bound for Glory and Rocky by two months. This new camera stabilization system was used extensively in Marathon Man's running and chase scenes on the streets of New York City. The movie was filmed from October 1975 to February 1976.  Themes  The film explores themes of endurance and the pursuit of Nazi war criminals.Bouzereau, Laurent. Ultraviolent Movies: from Sam Peckinpah to Quentin Tarantino.

Some critics believed that the violence exhibited was necessary to the film and to the character of Babe. Other critics found the violence to be offensive.Bouzereau, Laurent. Ultraviolent Movies: from Sam Peckinpah to Quentin Tarantino. Citadel Press, September 1, 2000. 135. Retrieved from Google Books on January 9, 2012. , . Critic Pauline Kael considered the film a \\"Jewish revenge fantasy\\". The nickname given to Laurence Olivier's character, \\"der weiße Engel\\" (The White Angel) was inspired by Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, known as the \\"Angel of Death\\" or also, \\"der weiße Engel\\" because when he stood on the platform of arrivals to concentration camps, he looked like a \\"white angel\\" directing victims to their deaths. Babe originally has childish traits. As the film progresses, these childish traits are replaced with more adult ones. Michelle Citron of Jump Cut compared Babe to Carrie White in the 1976 film Carrie.\\"Carrie meets Marathon Man.\\" Jump Cut. No. 14, 1977. P. 10-12. Janeway is only interested in his own gain instead of the ideal to advance U.S. interests. Paul Cobley stated in The American Thriller: Generic Innovation and Social Change in the 1970s that Janeway \\"can be read as the impersonality of late capitalism[...] or a post-Foucaldian embodiment of the shifting locations of power\\" or \\"a representative of the vicissitudes of the market\\".Cobley, Paul.

Astres étincelants, sung by Joseph Rouleau with the orchestra of the Royal Opera House conducted by John Matheson, published on Decca Records).  Reception and cultural impact  The film was a financial and critical success. Olivier's performance was particularly praised: he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and he won a Golden Globe in the same category. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 81% based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 7.35/10. The consensus reads, \\"Marathon Man runs the gamut from patient mystery to pulse-pounding thriller, aided by Laurence Olivier's coldly terrifying performance and a brainy script by William Goldman.\\" Roger Ebert gave Marathon Man 3 out of a possible 4 stars. He wrote: \\"If holes in plots bother you, 'Marathon Man' will be maddening. But as well-crafted escapist entertainment, as a diabolical thriller, the movie works with relentless skill.\\" Dr. Szell was ranked as villain #34 on the American Film Institute's \\"100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains\\" list. The film itself was ranked #50 on the \\"100 Years...100 Thrills\\" list. He was also ranked in Time as one of the 25 greatest movie villains. Both the novel and film contain a graphic depiction in which Szell tortures Babe by first probing a cavity in one of Babe's teeth with a curette, and later drilling into another tooth, without anesthetic, while repeatedly asking the question \\"Is it safe?\\" The quote \\"Is it safe?\\" was ranked #70 on the \\"100 Years...100 Movie Quotes\\" list. The dental torture scene was named #66 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments. The torture scene has been described as one of the most frightening sequences in film. Critics have remarked on the high level of talent and class.Brown, Dennis Shoptalk, Newmarket Press, 1992, p 70 Director Schlesinger said that Marathon Man was successful not only because it had elements of escapism, but also because the audience easily identified with Babe Levy. Schlesinger said that he \\"is definitely someone that you can root for. The film is about his survival in a grim and hostile world. In our present age of anxiety we can all identify with characters who are not trying to get ahead but simply to survive.\\"Mann, William J. Edge of Midnight: The Life of John Schlesinger. Random House Digital, Sep 1, 2006. 444. Retrieved from Google Books on January 10, 2012. , . Deleted violent scenes Although the first preview of the movie was successful, the second one in San Francisco did not go well. The audience complained about all the violent scenes, so director John Schlesinger and editor Jim Clark chose to delete the following scenes and shots: the scene near the beginning of the film in which Doc fights with two assassins who have killed his friend; the graphic and gory close-ups of Szell disemboweling Doc with his wrist blade; and both of the torture scenes, which were heavily cut. Graphic insert shots from the torture scenes, which were filmed by Clark, were removed. Some photos, such as original lobby cards and stills, show Szell torturing Babe longer with dental instruments in the first torture scene and actual onscreen drilling of Babe's tooth in the second torture scene. Differences from the novel An 8½-minute sequence was shot of Doc fighting with some men who kill a spy colleague of his. William Goldman speculated that the scene was cut because of its violence and called the cut \\"grievous\\" and to the detriment of the film.Bradey, John Joseph. The Craft of the Screenwriter: Interviews with Six Celebrated Screenwriters (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1981), p. 162. With the sequence missing, Doc's character seems to be less flawed than he really is. In the novel, Janeway and Doc are gay and lovers. This is handled subtly in the movie (when Doc arrives in Paris he calls Janeway on the phone and says \\"Janie, I miss you. Get your ass over here (to the hotel room).\\" In the book their sexual relationship is not subtle at all and has Doc pining for Janeway at several points in the book. The ending was rewritten by Robert Towne because, it has been speculated, Hoffman was unhappy with it.Bradey, p. 166. Goldman told an interviewer he thought the new, more famous ending was \\"shit\\" because it left out two important plot clarifications. The final confrontation between Babe and Szell, in particular, is changed: in the film, Babe \\"spares\\" Szell in a pump room, tries forcing him to swallow his diamonds and Szell then falls on his own retractable blade, dying. In the novel, Babe resolutely leads Szell to Central Park and shoots him multiple times, subsequently lecturing him. He then throws the diamonds away and is quietly led away by a policeman.

Building and History  Initiated by Ernst von Possart, the theatre was built in the Prinzregentenstrasse as a festival hall for the operas of Richard Wagner near an area where a similar project of King Ludwig II had failed some decades before. Named after Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria, the building was designed by Max Littmann and opened 21 August 1901 with a production of Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg by Richard Wagner. Like the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, the auditorium was designed to Wagner’s specifications, but an amphitheater has replaced the loges. After the destruction of the Nationaltheater during World War II, the Prinzregententheater housed the Bavarian State Opera from 1944 to 1963 even though it also suffered damage during the war which was not repaired until 1958. Since its renovation in 1988, the Prinzregententheater, with 1122 seats, has served also for the Bavarian Staatsschauspiel and now houses the Bavarian Theatre Academy founded by August Everding.

History Ietas was mentioned by Philistusapud Steph. B. s. v. as a fortress, and it is called by Thucydidesvii. 2. a fortress of the Siculians (), which was taken by Gylippus on his march from Himera through the interior of the island towards Syracuse. It first appears as an independent city in the time of Pyrrhus, and was attacked by that monarch on account of its strong position and the advantages it offered for operations against Panormus; but the inhabitants readily capitulated.Diod. xxii. 10, p. 498. In the First Punic War it was occupied by a Carthaginian garrison, but after the fall of Panormus drove out these troops and opened its gates to the Romans.Id. xxiii. 18, p. 505. Under the Roman government it appears as a municipal town, but not one of much importance. The Ietini are only noticed in passing by Cicero among the towns whose lands had been utterly ruined by the exactions of Verres; and the Ietenses are enumerated by Pliny among the populi stipendiarii of the interior of Sicily.Cicero In Verrem iii. 4. 3; Pliny iii. 8. s. 14.

The town minted coins in antiquity, examples of which survive.Eckhel, vol. i., p. 216. The position of Ietas is very obscurely intimated in ancient sources, but it appears from Diodorus that it was not very remote from Panormus, and that its site was one of great natural strength. Silius Italicus also alludes to its elevated situation.celsus Ietas, xiv. 271. Fazello assures us that there was a mediaeval fortress called Iato on the summit of a lofty mountain, about 25 km from Palermo, and 20 km north of Entella, which was destroyed by Frederick II at the same time as the latter city; and this he identified as the site of Ietas. The mountain is still called Monte Iato (or Monte Jato or Monte di Iato), though formerly known as Monte di San Cosmano, from a church on its summit.Tommaso Fazello x. p. 471; Amic. Lex. Top.

The Lab-On-a-Chip Application Development – Portable Test System (LOCAD-PTS) is a handheld device for microbial monitoring aboard the ISS.LOCAD-PTS International Space Station (ISS) Page. It evolved from the Endosafe-Portable Test System (Endosafe-PTS), developed by Charles River Laboratories for use in the pharmaceutical and health care industries.Charles River Laboratories (CRL) Endosafe-PTS. http://www.criver.com/en- US/ProdServ/ByType/Endotoxin/rapidtestingmethods/Pages/Endosafe-PTS.aspx In 2004–2005, Charles River Laboratories teamed up with Carnegie Institution for Science and NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, including BAE Systems and Jacobs Technology, to modify the Endosafe-PTS device (and a sample handling system) for spaceflight. The LOCAD-PTS project has been funded in large part by NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD), under the Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP), and specifically under the umbrella of Advanced Environmental Monitoring and Control (AEMC).NASA's Advanced Environmental Monitoring and Control (AEMC) Program. A LOCAD-PTS Cartridge. The device itself (or reader) weighs 2.2 pounds and is a combined spectrophotometer, heater and pump, operated with multiple interchangeable cartridges for the detection of different microbial molecules. There are three different LOCAD-PTS cartridges aboard the ISS, for the detection of three different microbial molecules: endotoxin, glucan and lipoteichoic acid. These three molecules are found mainly within gram-negative bacteria, fungi and gram-positive bacteria, respectively. Endotoxin and glucan are detected with the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) enzyme cascade, derived from the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus. Lipoteichoic acid is detected with the Pro-Phenol Oxidase (PPO) enzyme cascade derived from the Jonah crab, Cancer borealis. By the amplification of a small signal, these enzyme cascades allow detection of very low amounts of starting microbial material. An astronaut can take a swab sample from a cabin surface, dissolve it in endotoxin-free water, and analyze it quantitatively with LOCAD-PTS in microgravity, all in under 15 minutes. Traditional culture-based methods aboard the ISS take several days and often require return of samples to Earth for more in-depth analysis by scientists on the ground. Suni Williams analyzes a surface sample with LOCAD-PTS aboard the ISS (March 31, 2007) LOCAD-PTS was launched to the ISS on December 9, 2006, aboard Space Shuttle Discovery STS-116. Following a four-month period of storage aboard the ISS, the device was first used by Expedition 14/15 Flight Engineer Suni Williams on March 31, 2007, to analyze surfaces within Unity.\\"No Foolin' -- 'Lab on a Chip' Works!\\" Science@NASA article (April 6, 2007). https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2007/06apr_locad2.htm Since that time, LOCAD-PTS has been used extensively by the crews of Expedition 16–Expedition 18 to monitor microbial material throughout the ISS. The LOCAD Team has supported each operation of LOCAD-PTS aboard the ISS from consoles at the NASA Payload Operations and Integration Center (POIC) at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. LOCAD-PTS will continue to be used aboard ISS through October 2009 by Expedition 20 astronauts Mike Barratt and Tim Kopra. The first phase of ISS operations took place between March 2007 to February 2008 (Expeditions 14–16), when LAL cartridges were used to detect endotoxin on surfaces within the ISS.J. Maule, N.

Endotoxin was detected at 50% of all surface sites and commonly found on surfaces within exercise, hygiene, sleeping and dining areas. Endotoxin was found at every surface site where Colony Forming Units (CFUs) were observed with culture-based contact slide methods. LAL-Glucan cartridges, for the detection of Beta-1,3-glucan, were launched to the ISS aboard Space Shuttle STS-123 in March 2008. Preliminary results with these cartridges showed similar patterns to those observed for endotoxin, but glucan was found at higher levels and found to be far more widespread throughout the ISS.\\"Astronauts Swab the Deck.\\" Science@NASA article (February 6, 2009). https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2009/06feb_locad.htm The Gram+ cartridges, for the detection of lipoteichoic acid) were launched to the ISS aboard STS-126 on November 14, 2008.

LOCAD-PTS Exploration is an ISS experiment funded by the Moon and Mars Analogue Mission Activities (MMAMA) Program of NASA's Science Mission Directorate.LOCAD-PTS Exploration International Space Station (ISS) Page. It is a collaboration between BAE Systems, Charles River Laboratories (CRL), NASA Johnson Space Center (Astronaut Office, Crew and Thermal Systems Division, and Extravehicular Activity (EVA) and Crew Survival Systems Branch), NASA Kennedy Space Center and NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The goal of the experiment is to design and test procedures to monitor and document the spread of biological material associated with human spaceflight, both before and after launch, in preparation for the human exploration of the Moon and Mars. The LOCAD-PTS Exploration experiment has been funded by NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD), under the Moon and Mars Analogue Mission Activities (MMAMA) Program, and is the first SMD-funded experiment aboard the ISS. The ISS Starboard S6 Truss-section was analyzed with LOCAD-PTS in October 2008 and December 2008—while located in the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) at NASA's Kennedy Space Center—and again in space following launch of Space Shuttle Discovery STS-119. The S6 Truss was swabbed in space on flight day 5, March 19, 2009, during the first spacewalk by Steve Swanson (EV1) and Richard R. Arnold (EV2). This 'swab' was performed indirectly with the spacesuit gloves. The gloves themselves were swabbed inside the ISS both before and after EVA, with LOCAD-PTS, by Expedition 18 Flight Engineer Sandy Magnus. Swab samples were then analyzed aboard the ISS by Magnus on flight day 7, March 21, 2009. This experiment marked the first time in human spaceflight that EVA crew checked themselves for microbes before EVA, and was mentioned by the STS-119 crew to President Obama during a video conference from space during STS-119.\\"ISS Spacewalkers Test Planetary Protection Concept.\\" Science@NASA article (March 20, 2009). https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2009/20mar_locadexploration.htm This type of procedure will be required to monitor and document the spread of biological material in support of NASA's goal to search for life on other planetsThe 2006 NASA Strategic Plan.

Background After decreasing sales of his previous album and Iron Mountain Depot, Hartford recorded another album for RCA in 1971, Radio John, that they chose not to release. It included an early version of \\"In Tall Buildings\\" which he would return to in 1976 on Nobody Knows What You Do. Hartford asked for, and was given, his release from his contract. He signed with Warner Bros. and subsequently released two albums on that label. Like all of his RCA recordings, Iron Mountain Depot was reissued in 2002. In the reissue package, Iron Mountain Depot is combined with his fifth album, John Hartford, and the unreleased material from Radio John. Reception Music critic Richie Unterberger, writing for Allmusic, called the album \\"a little less inspired than much of his prior work for the label. It's not much different than his previous work for the company in the late '60s. It's just not as abundant in left-field ideas and sounds a little more casual and tossed-off.

Life Albert Marie-Henri Lagrange was born 7 March 1855, in Bourg-en-Bresse, France. At the age of three, he received a blessing from the Curé d’Ars. After studies in the junior Seminary of Autun, where he studied languages: Greek, German, English, and Italian. He continued his studies in law at Paris, obtaining a Doctorate 1878 and was admitted to practice.Becker O.P., John Vianney. \\"Pere LaGrange\\", Dominicana In 1878 he entered the Dominican seminary at Issy-les-Moulineaux, and from there went to the novitiate at St Maximin in Toulouse, where he received the habit and was given the name Brother Marie-Joseph. In 1880, the Dominicans were expelled from France. Lagrange went to the Spanish Dominican house of St. Stephen in Salamanca. He was ordained a priest at Zamora in 1883.\\"Our Founder\\",, École biblique et archéologique française de Jerusalem Lagrange was a professor of Church history and Holy Scripture when he was sent to Vienna to improve his knowledge of Oriental languages: Assyrian, Egyptian, Arabic, and Hebrew. He also studied Rabbinical literature. In February 1889, he was sent to Jerusalem, where in November 1890 he opened the École Pratique d’Études Bibliques (Practical School of Biblical Studies). In 1892, he founded the Revue biblique. While some of contemporaries criticized the new scientific and critical approach to the Bible, Lagrange made use of it. A scholar of wide- ranging interests, he was the author of Critique textuelle; II, La critique rationnelle (Paris, 1936), an influential handbook of textual theory and method as related to the textual criticism of the New Testament. He was made a Master of Sacred Theology in 1901. Lagrange's first article in the Revue biblique regarding the likely location of the city of David caused some criticism; even more was generated by '\\"The Sources of the Pentateuch\\", a reexamination of Moses' part in the composition of the first five books of the Bible. But Pope Leo was not inclined to discourage new ideas. Lagrange adhered to the 1893 encyclical Providentissimus Deus of Pope Leo XIII regarding biblical research, and as long as Pope Leo was alive, his work quietly progressed, but after Leo's death, an ultra-conservative reaction set in. Père Lagrange, like other scholars involved in the 19th-century renaissance of biblical studies, was suspected of being a Modernist. The historical-critical method was considered suspect by the Vatican. His 1904 book, The Historical Method, drew criticism. In 1905, the Pontifical Biblical Commission issued a caution about two of his methodological principles. In 1908 he petitioned the Master General for permission to withdraw from Scripture studies. Fr. Cormier, the General at the time, refused and told him to focus instead on the New Testament. In 1912 Lagrange was given an order of silence for the Revue Biblique to cease publication and to return to France. The École itself was closed for a year, and then Lagrange was sent back to Jerusalem to continue his work. His best known work is L’Évangile de Jésus Christ. Lagrange spent forty-five years in Jerusalem. In 1935 he returned to France permanently for reasons of health,\\"Biography\\", Marie-Joseph LaGrange and died on 10 March 1938 at the age of eighty-four. In 1967, his remains were returned to Jerusalem for burial in the choir of the Basilica of St-Étienne, next to the École Biblique.

Participants report that they are organized into teams and groups of commentators that participate in Russian and international political blogs and Internet forums using sockpuppets, social bots and large-scale orchestrated trolling and disinformation campaigns to promote pro-Putin and pro-Russian propaganda.

The earliest documented allegations of the existence of \\"web brigades\\" appear to be in the April 2003 Vestnik Online article \\"The Virtual Eye of Big Brother\\" by French journalist Anna Polyanskaya (a former assistant to assassinated Russian politician Galina Starovoitova \\"They are killing Galina Starovoitova for the second time\\", by Anna Polyansky) and two other authors, Andrey Krivov and Ivan Lomako. The authors claim that up to 1998, contributions to forums on Russian Internet sites (Runet) predominantly reflected liberal and democratic values, but after 2000, the vast majority of contributions reflected totalitarian values. This sudden change was attributed to the appearance of teams of pro-Russian commenters who appeared to be organized by the Russian state security service.Virtual Eye of the Big Brother by Anna Polyanskaya, Andrei Krivov, and Ivan Lomko, Vestnik online, April 30, 2003Vestnik online, April 30, 2003 Eye for an eye by Grigory Svirsky and Vladimur Bagryansky, publication of the Russian Center for Extreme Journalism According to the authors, about 70% of Russian Internet posters were of generally liberal views prior to 1998–1999, while a surge of \\"antidemocratic\\" posts (about 60–80%) suddenly occurred at many Russian forums in 2000. This could also be a reflection to the fact that access to Internet among the general Russian population soared during this time, which was until then accessible only to some sections of the society. In January 2012, a hacktivist group calling itself the Russian arm of Anonymous published a massive collection of email allegedly belonging to former and present leaders of the pro-Kremlin youth organization Nashi (including a number of government officials). Journalists who investigated the leaked information found that the pro-Kremlin movement had engaged in a range of activities including paying commentators to post content and hijacking blog ratings in the fall of 2011. \\"Kremlin's Blogshop\\" by Anastasia Karimova. Kommersant Dengi, February 13, 2012 The e-mails indicated that members of the \\"brigades\\" were paid 85 rubles (about US$3) or more per comment, depending on whether the comment received replies. Some were paid as much as 600,000 roubles (about US$21,000) for leaving hundreds of comments on negative press articles on the internet, and were presented with iPads. A number of high-profile bloggers were also mentioned as being paid for promoting Nashi and government activities. The Federal Youth Agency, whose head (and the former leader of Nashi) Vasily Yakemenko was the highest-ranking individual targeted by the leaks, refused to comment on the authenticity of the e-mails. \\"Kommersant Director General Files Complain against Nashi Spokesperson\\". Izvestia, February 9, 2012. In 2013, a Freedom House report stated that 22 of 60 countries examined have been using paid pro-government commentators to manipulate online discussions, and that Russia has been at the forefront of this practice for several years, along with China and Bahrain.Russia's Online-Comment Propaganda Army, The Atlantic, by Olga Khazan, 9 October 2013 In the same year, Russian reporters investigated the St. Petersburg Internet Research Agency, which employs at least 400 people. They found that the agency covertly hired young people as \\"Internet operators\\" paid to write pro-Kremlin postings and comments, smearing opposition leader Alexei Navalny and U.S. politics and culture.\\"Internet Troll Operation Uncovered in St. Petersburg\\", The St. Petersburg Times, by Sergey Chernov, 18, September,2013Ukraine conflict: Inside Russia's 'Kremlin troll army', BBC Protest against Donald Trump in New York City that was allegedly organized by Russians indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\\"Michael Moore participated in anti-Trump rally allegedly organized by Russians\\". Fox News. February 20, 2018 Some Russian opposition journalists state that such practices create a chilling effect on the few independent media outlets remaining in the country. Further investigations were performed by Russian opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta and Institute of Modern Russia in 2014–15, inspired by the peak of activity of the pro-Russian brigades during the Ukrainian conflict and assassination of Boris Nemtsov. The effort of using \\"troll armies\\" to promote Putin's policies is reported to be a multimillion- dollar operation. According to an investigation by the British Guardian newspaper, the flood of pro-Russian comments is part of a coordinated \\"informational-psychological war operation\\". One Twitter bot network was documented to use more than 20,500 fake Twitter accounts to spam negative comments after the death of Boris Nemtsov and events related to the Ukrainian conflict. An article based on the original Polyanskaya article, authored by the Independent Customers' Association, was published in May 2008 at Expertiza.Ru.

Prominent journalist and Russia expert Peter Pomerantsev believes Russia's efforts are aimed at confusing the audience, rather than convincing it. He states that they cannot censor information but can \\"trash it with conspiracy theories and rumours\\". To avert suspicions, the users sandwich political remarks between neutral articles on travelling, cooking and pets. They overwhelm comment sections of media to render meaningful dialogue impossible.The readers' editor on… pro-Russia trolling below the line on Ukraine stories, the Guardian, 4 May 2014Putin's G20 Snub, The Moscow Times, Nov. 18 2014 A collection of leaked documents, published by Moy Rayon, suggests that work at the \\"troll den\\" is strictly regulated by a set of guidelines. Any blog post written by an agency employee, according to the leaked files, must contain \\"no fewer than 700 characters\\" during day shifts and \\"no fewer than 1,000 characters\\" on night shifts. Use of graphics and keywords in the post's body and headline is also mandatory. In addition to general guidelines, bloggers are also provided with \\"technical tasks\\" – keywords and talking points on specific issues, such as Ukraine, Russia's internal opposition and relations with the West. On an average working day, the workers are to post on news articles 50 times. Each blogger is to maintain six Facebook accounts publishing at least three posts a day and discussing the news in groups at least twice a day. By the end of the first month, they are expected to have won 500 subscribers and get at least five posts on each item a day. On Twitter, the bloggers are expected to manage 10 accounts with up to 2,000 followers and tweet 50 times a day. In 2015, Lawrence Alexander disclosed a network of propaganda websites sharing the same Google Analytics identifier and domain registration details, allegedly run by Nikita Podgorny from Internet Research Agency. The websites were mostly meme repositories focused on attacking Ukraine, Euromaidan, Russian opposition and Western policies. Other websites from this cluster promoted president Putin and Russian nationalism, and spread alleged news from Syria presenting anti- Western and pro-Bashar al-Assad viewpoints. In August 2015, Russian researchers correlated Google search statistics of specific phrases with their geographic origin, observing increases in specific politically loaded phrases (such as \\"Poroshenko\\", \\"Maidan\\", \\"sanctions\\") starting from 2013 and originating from very small, peripheral locations in Russia, such as Olgino, which also happens to be the headquarters of the Internet Research Agency company. The Internet Research Agency also appears to be the primary sponsor of an anti-Western exhibition Material Evidence. Since 2015, Finnish reporter Jessikka Aro has inquired into web brigades and Russian trolls. In addition, Western journalists have referred to the phenomenon and have supported traditional media. In May 2019, it was reported that a study from the George Washington University found that Russian Twitter bots had tried to inflame the United States' anti-vaccination debate by posting opinions on both sides in 2018. In June 2019 a group of 12 editors introducing coordinated pro- government and anti-opposition bias was blocked on the Russian-language wikipedia. In July 2019 two operatives of the Internet Research Agency were detained in Libya and charged with attempting to influence local elections. They were reportedly employees of Alexander Malkevich, manager of USA Really, a propaganda website. In 2020, the research firm Graphika published a reported detailing one particular Russian disinformation group codenamed \\"Secondary Infektion\\" (alluding to 80's Operation Infektion) operating running since 2014. Over 6 years the group published over 2,500 items in seven languages and to over 300 platforms such as social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit) and discussion forums. The group specialized in highly divisive topics regarding immigration, environment, politics, international relations and frequently used fake images presented as \\"leaked documents\\".

The Hawaiian archipelago consists of 137 islands in the Pacific Ocean that are far from any other land. Polynesians arrived there one to two thousand years ago, and in 1778 Captain James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to visit Hawaii (which they called the Sandwich Islands). The art created in these islands may be divided into art existing prior to Cook’s arrival; art produced by recently arrived westerners; and art produced by Hawaiians incorporating western materials and ideas. Public collections of Hawaiian art may be found at the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Bishop Museum (Honolulu), the Hawaii State Art Museum and the University of Göttingen in Germany. In 1967, Hawaii became the first state in the nation to implement a Percent for Art law. The Art in State Buildings Law established the Art in Public Places Program and designated one percent of the construction costs of new public schools and state buildings for the acquisition of works of art, either by commission or by purchase. Art prior to Cook's arrival Kii-Hulu Manu (Hawaiian feathered image), 18th century, believed to represent Kuka’ilimoku, wicker, feathers, mother-of-pearl, dog teeth, Cook-Forster Collection of the University of Göttingen, Germany Art existing prior to Cook’s arrival is very similar to the art of other Pacific Islanders. This art includes wood carvings, feather work, petroglyphs, bark cloth (called kapa in Hawaiian and tapa elsewhere in the Pacific) and tattoos. Native Hawaiians had neither metal nor woven cloth. Production of this art continued after Cook’s arrival. A few craftsmen still produce traditional Hawaiian arts, either to sell to tourists or to preserve native culture. Art produced by visitors Hawaii visitor Joseph Henry Sharp's oil painting 'Blow Hole, Honolulu' Some of the first westerners to visit Hawaii were artists-- both professional and amateur. Many of the explorers’ ships had professional artists to record their discoveries. These artists sketched and painted Hawaii’s people and landscapes using imported materials and concepts. Artists in this category include Alfred Thomas Agate (American 1812-1849), Mabel Alvarez (American 1891-1985), Auguste Borget (French 1809-1877), George Henry Burgess (English 1831-1905), Jean Charlot (French 1898-1979), Nicholas Chevalier (1828-1902), Louis Choris (German-Ukrainian 1795-1828), Ernest William Christmas (Australian 1863- 1918), Amelia R.

Night scenes of erupting volcanoes were especially popular giving rise to The Volcano School. Art produced by Hawaiians and long-term residents From Cliffs to Evening by Reuben Tam, oil on canvas, 1978, Honolulu Museum of Art Artworks produced by Hawaii’s native born and long-term residents incorporating western materials and ideas include paintings on canvas and quilts. They may be distinctly Hawaiian in subject matter or as diverse as their places of origin. Most of the art currently produced in Hawaii falls into this third category.

It was the third and last single released from the group's 1975 album Mothership Connection. The song introduces George Clinton's messianic alien alter ego Star Child for the first time (see P-Funk mythology). The lyrics \\"Swing down, sweet chariot, stop and let me ride\\" quote the traditional spiritual \\"Swing Down, Chariot\\", first popularized in the 1940s by The Golden Gate Quartet and later recorded by Elvis Presley among others (and not the better-known spiritual \\"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\\"). The track \\"Let Me Ride\\" on the Dr. Dre album The Chronic is heavily based on samples from this song. In 1998, Scott Grooves produced a remix version of this song under the title Mothership Reconnection, followed by yet another remix by Scott Grooves, Slam and Daft Punk. The music video for the Scott Grooves version hinted at the modernizing of the song by showing characters inspired by Clinton's Star Child mythology re-made in the visual style of the 1982 movie Tron.Connection between Scott Grooves, Daft Punk and Parliament on whosampledwho.com The song is featured in the enhanced editions soundtrack of the video game Grand Theft Auto V, appearing on the fictional in-game radio station Space 103.2 FM. Alternate titles The song was titled simply \\"Star Child\\" on its single release, while the radio promo version was titled \\"Star Child (Mothership Connection).\\" This version uses the same track from Mothership Connection but fades out at 3:08. It is included as a bonus track on the Mothership Connection CD. On the album Live: P-Funk Earth Tour the song is split into two tracks, \\"Mothership Connection (Star Child)\\" and \\"Swing Down, Sweet Chariot.\\"  Cover versions  In 1990, bassist Stanley Clarke and keyboardist George Duke released an album entitled \\"3,\\" which contained a cover of this song.

It is owned by West Central Michigan Media Ministries and airs programming from the Strong Tower Radio Network, heard on about a dozen radio stations around Michigan and one in Illinois. Because AM 1540 is a clear channel frequency reserved for Class A stations KXEL in Waterloo, Iowa, and ZNS-1 in Nassau, Bahamas, KTGG is a daytimer station. To avoid interference, it must sign off at night. By day it broadcasts at 450 watts and during critical hours (just before sunrise and just after sunset) it is powered at 219 watts. Until August 2014, KTGG was simulcast on AM 1510 WJKN in Jackson, Michigan. WJKN has since been sold to Jackson-Lansing Catholic Radio. Unusual call sign Call signs beginning with K are only supposed to be issued to stations west of the Mississippi River, so it was surprising that the call letters KTGG were issued for this new station in 1980. Some believe this occurred when someone at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) read \\"MI\\" (the postal abbreviation for Michigan) on the station's application and mistook it as the abbreviation for Missouri or Minnesota. KTGG thus became the first new station east of the Mississippi with a \\"K\\" call sign in decades. The river was first used as the divider between K and W call signs in 1922. Stations such as KYW in Philadelphia (originally in Chicago) and Pittsburgh's KDKA have retained their heritage call letters because they signed on before 1922. However, KTGG wasn't the last broadcaster with this distinction. A new station in Napeague, New York, was originally dubbed KCBE in 2008 by the FCC, before changing to WEGB in 2009. Since then, several non-commercial religious radio stations east of the Mississippi have gone on the air with K call letters. In most cases it was because their construction permit and call letters were issued for a location west of the Mississippi but the owner relocated the station to east of the Mississippi before it was built. Most of them are owned by the Educational Media Foundation, the Hispanic Family Christian Network or Holy Family Radio. History AM 1510 was a country music station for over three decades under several call signs, including WJCO, WDJD, and WHBT. The WJKN calls were adopted in 1995 and the format changed to a full-service combination of news, talk and adult contemporary music. In 1998, WJKN phased out music programming and became a predominantly news-talk station. Then, in September 2000, the station went dark after owner Coltrace Communications (the owner of WUPS in Houghton Lake) sold the land on which the station's towers were located to a developer. Shortly afterward, Coltrace donated WJKN to its former owner, Spring Arbor University, which returned the station to the air briefly in late 2001 and early 2002 with a simulcast of 106.9 WSAE). WJKN was then again dark for several months, and then resurfaced in March 2003 simulcasting KTGG, whose 450-watt signal does not make it far outside of Spring Arbor. In July 2016, KTGG was sold to West Central Michigan Media Ministries for $230,000. KTGG, as of June 2017, is broadcasting a simulicast of Strong Tower Radio 91.9 WGCP-FM Cadillac, Michigan. KTGG remains on after sunset with 185 watts during critical hours. WJKN sale and KTGG format change In April 2014, it was announced that Spring Arbor University was selling WJKN 1510 to Jackson- Lansing Catholic Radio (d/b/a Good Shepherd Radio). This was the Catholic broadcaster's second go at getting a radio station in the Jackson area, as they had been in the process of buying the now-defunct WJKQ 88.5 FM when that station's license was revoked by the FCC. The sale was completed in August 2014. WJKN and FM translator 93.3 W227BY began airing a Catholic talk format identifying as Good Shepherd Catholic Radio. W227BY was also formerly owned by Spring Arbor University and operated out of Somerset, Michigan as a translator of WSAE 106.9 FM. Effective November 12, 2015, Spring Arbor University consummated the sale of KTGG to West Central Michigan Media Ministries for $230,000. In December 2014, KTGG dropped its previous Christian inspirational music format and became the new home of \\"The Message,\\" the Christian music and teaching format formerly heard on sister station WJKN-FM 89.3, which at that time became a simulcast of WSAE's \\"Home.FM\\" programming. Like the former inspirational music format, 'The Message\\" features music programming hosted by Spring Arbor students.

Anatoly Khazanov, an anthropologist and historian studying mobile pastoralism, notes: \\"The specific significance of pastoralism is usually at its most apparent in the specialized mountain variant of herdsman husbandry; in Soviet anthropology this is often referred to as yaylag pastoralism...\\"Anatoly Khazanov, Nomads and the Outside World, Second Edition, University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, p. 23 In Western anthropology yaylak pastoralism more or less corresponds to the notion of transhumance (Transhumanz).Khazanov, ibid., 23; Krader, L. Peoples of Central Asia. Uralic and Altaic Series, Vol. 26, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, 1966, p. 409 According to Karl Heinrich Menges, who studied and witnessed the nomadic lifestyle of the Turkic Qashqai tribe in Iran, \\"[t]ribes in their summer encampments (jajłaγ), and not on the move (köç). They live, during the months May-August, in the region as designated above, and begin to move southward to the winter encampments (qyšłaγ) about the end of August.\\"Karl H. Menges. Research in the Turkic Dialects of Iran (Preliminary Report on a Trip to Persia), Oriens, Vol. 4, No. 2, Dec. 31, 1951, p. 273. There are different variants of yaylak pastoralism forms of alpine transhumance, some of which are similar to seminomadic pastoralism, although most are similar to herdsman husbandry (such as in mountainous areas of Europe and the Caucasus). However, in the Eurasian steppes, the Middle East and North Africa, yaylak pastoralism often coexists with seminomadic pastoralism and pastoral nomadism.Anatoly Khazanov, Nomads and the Outside World, Second Edition, The University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, p. 24 In the description of another Western specialist on nomads and pastoralism, Khazanov's classification system is the most modern approach, \\"classifying nomadic forms according to a society’s extent of migratory mobility, the primacy of specific animals in producing their subsistence products, and the level of symbiosis between nomadic and settled agricultural societies. He categorizes pastoralists into five types, ranging from “pure pastoral nomadism” to “semi- nomadic pastoralism,” “semi-sedentary pastoralism,” and finally to “distant- pastures husbandry” and “seasonal transhumance” (Khazanov’s yaylak – Khazanov 1994, 19-23)\\".Michael Frachetti, \\"Bronze Age Pastoral Landscapes Of Eurasia And The Nature Of Social Interaction In The Mountain Steppe Zone Of Eastern Kazakhstan\\", Chapter 2, Ph.D. Dissertation in Anthropology, University of Pennsylvania, 2004 Yaylak pastoralism enables people occupied with agriculture in specific ecological zones to use other areas as seasonal pastures when they are at their most productive.Barth, Fredrik. Nomadism in the Mountain and Plateau Areas of South West Asia. In: The Problems of the Arid Zone, 1962, p. 342 During one part of the year the livestock is kept in mountain pastures and during the other parts is driven to lower zones. Another explanation of the yaylak's importance and position in today's agriculture is given by recent research: \\"Because it is semiarid, large parts of the Middle East traditionally have been given over to a mode of livelihood that combines the extensive cultivation of crops such as wheat and barley with sheep and goat herding. Herds are usually moved in fixed patterns between adjacent ecological zones in the course of a year and graze on the stubble of cultivated fields after harvest. Such movement is called transhumant pastoralism or seminomadism, and it differs from the movement of nomadic groups who follow their herds (pastoral nomadism). Seminomadic pastoralists and pastoral nomads form a significant but declining minority in such countries as Saudi Arabia (probably less than 3 percent), Iran (4 percent), and Afghanistan (no more than 10 percent). They comprise less than 2 percent of the population in the countries of North Africa, with the exception of Libya and Mauritania.\\" Dale Eickelman, The Middle East and Central Asia. An Anthropological Approach. Fourth Edition. Prentice Hall, 2002, p. 11 Variation in mobile pastoral systems is commonly linked to both the ecology of herding and socio-political negotiations.Tapper, Richard L.

In light of the environmental variability in pasture quality from year to year, however, ownership and control of particular locations and resources such as summer and winter pastures (ailoq and qhishloq) and seasonal cisterns (yekhdon) brought about various forms of social interactions, such as trading of resources, political alliances, and land rental, to meet the needs of domesticated herds.Barfield, Thomas J., The Central Asian Arabs of Afghanistan: Pastoral Nomadism in Transition. Austin, University of Texas Press, 1981, pp. 44-46 Another source provides additional background on yaylak pastoralism in Iran and Caucasus: \\"The seminomads live in a valley or on a plain in winter and in the highlands during the summer. Their \\"seasonal home\\" can mark the beginning of their transition from seminomadic pastoralism to a settled village life. Another example of this way of life from another part of the Northern Tier is the Bakhtiari tribes of Iran. All along the Zagros mountain range from Azerbaijan to the Arabian Sea, pastoral tribes move back and forth with their herds every year between their home in the valley and the one in the foothills.\\"Rouhollah Ramazani, The Northern Tie. Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey. D. Van Nostrand Company: New Jersey, 1966, p. 85 A number of scholars have suggested that yaylak pastoralism has ancient roots in Neolithic Western Asia, alleging that already in the seventh millennium B.C. the pastoralism of the inhabitants of the Zagros Mountains had taken on a yaylak form, and that besides their permanent settlements these people also had seasonal camps in the mountains. Flannery, 1965: 1254-5, Narr, 1959: 85, Masson 1976: 39. Although, \\"recent research has demonstrated, however, that yaylak pastoralism in the Zagros Mountains can be dated no earlier than the second half of the fourth millennium B.C.

The Berkshire pig is not all black, but has white, including white socks from the \\"knee\\" down and typically a white blaze on its snout. Berkshire pigs are an average to large breed, with an average weight at maturity of . They are a short- legged breed. They have prick ears and a relatively short snout with an upturned nose. Appearance The original Berkshire pig was a reddish or sandy-brown, sometimes with spots.Berkshire - New Zealand Pig Breeders Association website In the 1700s, breeders made improvements by cross-breeding the Berkshire with a Chinese and Siamese pig introduced into British agriculture. This is when the breed took on the distinctive entirely black color, with white on the feet, nose, and tail. More important than the coloration, breeders were pleased with the improved meat quality. Culinary Berkshire pork, prized for juiciness, flavour, and tenderness, is pink-hued and heavily marbled. Its high fat content makes it suitable for long cooking and high-temperature cooking. The meat also has a slightly higher pH, according to food science professor Kenneth Prusa of Iowa State University. Increased pH makes the meat darker, firmer, and more flavorful. High pH is a greater determinant than fat content in the meat's overall flavor characteristics.Premium (High-End) Pork Cooks Illustrated, July, 2011 Kurobuta The Japanese have bred the Kurobuta branch of the Berkshire breed for increased fineness in the meat and better marbling.Kagoshima Kurobuta Pork ~ A Deliciousness ought to be Savoured by Everyone in the World - Kagoshima Prefecture Website (Official) Pigs' fat stores many of the characteristics of the food that they eat.

Kurobuta pork sold elsewhere comes from Berkshire pigs. Berkshire/Kurobuta pork fetches a premium price. At a U.S. grocery store, conventional pork chops fetched $3-4/lb in 2015, $13-15/lb in 2019. The typical cost for a six-ounce Kurobuta pork chop ranged between $10-14. Countries of production =England= Berkshire pigs are thought to have originated in Reading, the county seat of Berkshire. It is one of the oldest breeds of pigs in England. It was the first breed to record pedigrees in herd books. Herds of the breed are still maintained in England by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust at Aldenham Country Park, Hertfordshire, and by the South of England Rare Breeds Centre in Kent. The Berkshire was listed as vulnerable in 2008; , fewer than 300 breeding sows were known to exist at that time, but with the revived popularity of the breed through its connection to the Japanese marketing of a \\"wagyu for pork\\" connection, the numbers have increased.Rare Breeds Survival Trust watch list accessed 21 May 2008.) =Japan= The pig is also bred in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan, under the trademarked name . Berkshire swine were introduced to Kagoshima via the Ryukyu Islands. Since the Meiji period in Japan, pig farming has broadened and proliferated until it became one of the leading agricultural industries of the prefecture. Beginning in the late 19th century, Japanese farmers and breeders have worked to improve the quality of their Berkshire herds. Japanese Berkshire pigs are bred for improved meat flavor characteristics. Sub-bred are “Satsuma”, “New Satsuma”, “Satsuma Ni- Rei-Rei-Ichi.” =New Zealand and Australia= Some pigs of the breed are also kept in New Zealand and Australia, but fewer than a hundred purebred sows are there now. =United States= In the United States, the American Berkshire Association, established in 1875, gives pedigrees only to pigs directly imported from established English herds or to those tracing directly back to such imported animals. The association was the first Swine Registry to be established and the first hog recorded was \\"Ace of Spades\\", a boar bred by Queen Victoria.

Married to American founding father Alexander Hamilton, she was a defender of his works and co-founder and deputy director of Graham Windham, the first private orphanage in New York City. Eliza is recognized as an early American philanthropist for her work with the Orphan Asylum Society.  Childhood and family  Elizabeth was born in Albany, New York, the second daughter of Continental Army General Philip Schuyler, a Revolutionary War general, and Catherine Van Rensselaer Schuyler. The Van Rensselaers of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck were one of the richest and most politically influential families in the state of New York. She had seven siblings who lived to adulthood, including Angelica Schuyler Church and Margarita \\"Peggy\\" Schuyler Van Rensselaer, but she had 14 siblings altogether. Her family was among the wealthy Dutch landowners who had settled around Albany in the mid-1600s, and both her mother and father came from wealthy and well-regarded families. Like many landowners of the time, Philip Schuyler owned slaves, and Eliza would have grown up around slavery. Despite the unrest of the French and Indian War, which her father served in and which was fought in part near her childhood home, Eliza's childhood was spent comfortably, learning to read and sew from her mother. Like most Dutch families of the area, her family belonged to the Reformed Dutch Church of Albany, which still stands; however, the original 1715 building, where Elizabeth was baptized and attended services, was demolished in 1806. Her upbringing instilled in her a strong and unwavering faith she would retain throughout her life. When she was a girl, Elizabeth accompanied her father to a meeting of the Six Nations and met Benjamin Franklin when he stayed briefly with the Schuyler family while traveling. She was said to have been something of a tomboy when she was young; throughout her life she retained a strong will and even an impulsiveness that her acquaintances noted. James McHenry, one of Washington's aides alongside her future husband, said, \\"Hers was a strong character with its depth and warmth, whether of feeling or temper controlled, but glowing underneath, bursting through at times in some emphatic expression.\\" Much later, the son of Joanna Bethune, one of the women she worked alongside to found an orphanage later in her life, remembered that \\"Both [Elizabeth and Joanna] were of determined disposition ... Mrs. Bethune the more cautious, Mrs. Hamilton the more impulsive.\\" Marriage In early 1780, Elizabeth went to stay with her aunt, Gertrude Schuyler Cochran, in Morristown, New Jersey. There she met Alexander Hamilton, one of General George Washington's aides-de-camp, who was stationed along with the General and his men in Morristown for the winter. In fact, they had met previously, if briefly, two years before, when Hamilton dined with the Schuylers on his way back from a negotiation on Washington's behalf. Also while in Morristown, Eliza met and became friends with Martha Washington, a friendship they would maintain throughout their husbands' political careers. Eliza later said of Mrs. Washington, \\"She was always my ideal of a true woman.\\" It is said that after returning home from meeting her, Hamilton was so excited he forgot the password to enter army headquarters. The relationship between Eliza and Hamilton quickly grew; even after he left Morristown for a short mission to negotiate a prisoners exchange, only a month after Eliza had arrived. While gone on the prisoner exchange, Hamilton wrote to Eliza continuing their relationship through letters. He then returned to Morristown where Elizabeth's father had also arrived in his capacity as representative of the Continental Congress. Also there had been some talk in at least one letter of a \\"secret wedding,\\" by early April they were officially engaged with her father's blessing (something of an anomaly for the Schuyler girls—both Angelica and Catherine would end up eloping). Hamilton followed the Army when they decamped in June 1780. In September that year, Eliza learned that Major John André, head of the British Secret Service, had been captured in a foiled plot concocted by General Benedict Arnold to surrender the fort of West Point to the British. André had once been a house guest in the Schuyler Mansion in Albany as a prisoner of war en route to Pennsylvania in 1775; Eliza, then seventeen, might have had a juvenile crush on the young British officer who had once sketched for her. Hamilton, while envious of André for his actions during the war, promised Eliza he would do what he could to treat the British intelligence chief accordingly; he even begged Washington to grant André's last wish of execution by firing squad, but to no avail. After two more months of separation punctuated by their correspondence, on December 14, 1780, Alexander Hamilton and Elizabeth Schuyler were married at the Schuyler Mansion. After a short honeymoon at the Pastures, Eliza's childhood home, Hamilton returned to military service in early January 1781. Eliza soon joined him at New Windsor, where Washington's army was now stationed, and she rekindled her friendship with Martha Washington as they entertained their husbands' fellow officers. Soon, however, Washington and Hamilton had a falling-out, and the newlywed couple moved, first back to Eliza's father's house in Albany, then to a new home across the river from the New Windsor headquarters. There Eliza busied herself in creating a home for them and in aiding Alexander with his political writings—parts of his 31-page letter to Robert Morris, laying out much of the financial knowledge that was to aid him later in his career, are in her handwriting. Soon, however, Eliza moved again, this time back to her parents' house in Albany. This may have coincided with the discovery that she was pregnant with her first child, who would be born the next January and named Philip, for her father. While apart, Alexander wrote her numerous letters telling her not to worry for his safety; in addition, he wrote her concerning confidential military secrets, including the lead-up to the Battle of Yorktown that autumn. Meanwhile, the war came close to home, when a group of British soldiers stumbled upon the Pastures, looking for supplies. According to some accounts, the family was spared from any losses thanks to her sister Peggy's quick thinking: she told the soldiers that her father had gone to town to get help, causing them to flee from the area. After Yorktown, Alexander was able to rejoin Eliza in Albany, where they would remain for almost another two years, before moving to New York City in late 1783. Earlier that year, Angelica and her husband John Barker Church, for business reasons, had moved to Europe. Angelica lived abroad for over fourteen years, returning to America for visits in 1785 and 1789. On September 25, 1784, Eliza gave birth to her second child, Angelica, named after Eliza's older sister. In 1787, Eliza sat for a portrait, executed by the painter Ralph Earl while he was being held in debtors' prison. Alexander had heard of Earl's predicament and asked if Eliza might be willing to sit for him, to allow him to make some money and eventually buy his way out of prison, which he subsequently did. At this time, she now had three young children (her third, Alexander, was born in May 1786) and may have been pregnant at the time with her fourth, James Alexander, who would be born the following April. In addition to their own children, in 1787, Eliza and Alexander took into their home Frances (Fanny) Antill, the two-year-old youngest child of Hamilton's friend Colonel Edward Antill, whose wife had recently died. In October that year, Angelica wrote to Alexander, \\"All the graces you have been pleased to adorn me with fade before the generous and benevolent action of my sister in taking the orphan Antle under her protection.\\" Two years later, Colonel Antill died in Canada, and Fanny continued to live with the Hamiltons for another eight years, until an older sister was married and able to take Fanny into her own home. Later, James Alexander Hamilton would write that Fanny \\"was educated and treated in all respects as [the Hamiltons'] own daughter.\\" The Hamiltons had an active social life, often attending the theater as well as various balls and parties. \\"I had little of private life in those days,\\" she would remember. At the first Inaugural Ball, Eliza danced with George Washington; when Thomas Jefferson returned from Paris in 1790, she and Alexander hosted a dinner for him. After Alexander became Treasury Secretary in 1789, her social duties only increased: \\"Mrs. Hamilton, Mrs. [Sarah] Jay and Mrs. [Lucy] Knox were the leaders of official society,\\" an early historian writes. In addition, she managed their household, and James McHenry once noted to Alexander that Eliza had \\"as much merit as your treasurer as you have as treasurer of the United States.\\" Elizabeth Hamilton, portrait by James Sharples, 1795 Eliza also continued to aid Alexander throughout his political career, serving as an intermediary between him and his publisher when he was writing The Federalist Papers, copying out portions of his defense of the Bank of the United States, and sitting up with him so he could read Washington's Farewell Address out loud to her as he wrote it. Meanwhile, she continued to raise her children (a fifth, John Church Hamilton, had been born in August 1792) and maintain their household throughout multiple moves between New York, Philadelphia, and Albany. While in Philadelphia, around November 24, 1794, Eliza suffered a miscarriage in the wake of her youngest child falling extremely ill as well as of her worries over Hamilton's absence during his armed suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion. Hamilton resigned from public office immediately afterwards in order to resume his law practice in New York and remain closer to his family. In 1797, an affair came to light that had taken place several years earlier between Hamilton and Maria Reynolds, a young woman who had first approached him for monetary aid in the summer of 1791. Eliza evidently did not believe the charges when they were first leveled against her husband: John Church, her brother-in-law, on July 13, 1797, wrote to Hamilton that \\"it makes not the least Impression on her, only that she considers the whole Knot of those opposed to you to be [Scoundrels].\\" After returning home to Eliza on July 22 and assembling a first draft dated July 1797, on August 25, 1797, Hamilton published a pamphlet, later known as the Reynolds Pamphlet, admitting to his one-year adulterous affair in order to refute the charges that he had been involved in speculation and public misconduct with Maria's husband James Reynolds. Eliza was, at the time, pregnant with their sixth child. Despite her advanced pregnancy and her previous miscarriage of November 1794, her initial reaction to her husband's disclosure of his past affair was to leave Hamilton in New York and join her parents in Albany where William Stephen was born on August 4, 1797. She only came back to her marital house in New York in early September 1797 because the local doctor had been unable to cure their eldest son Philip, who had accompanied her to Albany and contracted Typhus. Over time Eliza and Alexander reconciled and remained married, and had two more children together. The first, Elizabeth, named for Eliza, was born on November 20, 1799. Before their eighth child was born, however, they lost their oldest son, Philip, who died in a duel on November 24, 1801. After being shot on the dueling field, Philip was brought to Angelica and John Church's house, where he died with both of his parents next to him. Their last child, born the next June in 1802, was named Philip in his honor. During this time, Alexander commissioned John McComb Jr. to construct the Hamilton family home. In 1802, the same year that Philip was born, the house was built and named Hamilton Grange, after Alexander's father's home in Scotland. Eliza and Alexander continued to live together in a caring relationship in their new home that can be seen in letters between the two at the time. When Eliza went away to her mother's funeral in 1803 Hamilton wrote to her from the Grange telling her: > I am anxious to hear of your arrival at Albany and shall be glad to be > informed that your father and all of you are composed. I pray you to exert > yourself and I repeat my exhortation that you will bear in mind it is your > business to comfort and not to distress. Eliza and her husband would not get to enjoy their newly built home together long, for only two years later, in July 1804, Alexander Hamilton became involved in a similar \\"affair of honor,\\" which led to his infamous duel with Aaron Burr and untimely death. Before the duel, he wrote Eliza two letters, telling her: > The consolations of Religion, my beloved, can alone support you; and these > you have a right to enjoy. Fly to the bosom of your God and be comforted. > With my last idea; I shall cherish the sweet hope of meeting you in a better > world. Adieu best of wives and best of Women. Embrace all my darling > Children for me. Alexander Hamilton died on July 12, 1804, with Eliza and all seven of his surviving children by his side. Later life Henry Inman Elizabeth Hamilton at 94 In the year before the duel, Eliza's mother Catherine had died suddenly, and only a few months after Hamilton's death Eliza's father died as well. By this time, two of her siblings, Peggy and John, had also died. After her husband's death in 1804, Eliza was left to pay Hamilton's debts. The Grange, their house on a 35-acre estate in upper Manhattan, was sold at public auction; however, she was later able to repurchase it from Hamilton's executors, who had decided that Eliza could not be publicly dispossessed of her home, and purchased it themselves to sell back to her at half the price. In November 1833, at the age of 76, Eliza resold The Grange for $25,000, funding the purchase of a New York townhouse (now called the Hamilton-Holly House) where she lived for nine years with two of her grown children, Alexander Hamilton Jr. and Eliza Hamilton Holly, and their spouses. Eliza was also able to collect Alexander's pension from his service in the army from congress in 1836 for money and land. In 1848, she left New York for Washington, D.C., where she lived with her widowed daughter Eliza until 1854. In 1798, Eliza had accepted her friend Isabella Graham's invitation to join the descriptively named Society for the Relief of Poor Widows with Small Children that had been established the previous year. In 1806, two years after her husband's death, she, along with several other women including Joanna Bethune, founded the Orphan Asylum Society. Eliza was appointed second directress, or vice-president In 1821, she was named first directress, and served for 27 years in this role, until she left New York in 1848. In those roles, she raised funds, collected needed goods, and oversaw the care and education of over 700 children. By the time she left she had been with the organization continuously since its founding, a total of 42 years. The New York Orphan Asylum Society continues to exist as a social service agency for children, today called Graham Windham. Eliza's philanthropic work in helping create the Orphan Asylum Society has led to her induction into the philanthropy section of the National Museum of American History, showcasing the early generosity of Americans that reformed the nation. Eliza defended Alexander against his critics in a variety of ways following his death, including by supporting his claim of authorship of George Washington's Farewell Address and by requesting an apology from James Monroe over his accusations of financial improprieties. Eliza wanted a full official apology from Monroe which he would not give until they met in person to talk about Alexander shortly before his passing. Elizabeth Hamilton petitioned Congress to publish her husband Alexander Hamilton's writings (1846). Eliza remained dedicated to preserving her husband's legacy. She re-organized all of Alexander's letters, papers, and writings with the help of her son, John Church Hamilton, and persevered through many setbacks in getting his biography published. With Eliza's help John C. Hamilton would go on to publish History of the Republic of the United States America, as Traced in the Writings of Alexander Hamilton and his Contemporaries. History of the Republic would set the bar for future biographies of Alexander Hamilton that would grow as time went on. She was so devoted to Alexander's writings that she wore a small package around her neck containing the pieces of a sonnet that Alexander wrote for her during the early days of their courtship. The writings that historians have today by Alexander Hamilton can be attributed to efforts from Eliza. In June 1848, when Eliza was in her nineties, she made an effort for Congress to buy and publish her late husband's works. In August, her request was granted and Congress bought and published Alexander's works, adding them to the Library of Congress and helping future historians of Hamilton view his works today. Along with getting Alexander's works stored while Eliza was in her 90s, she remained dedicated to charity work. After moving to Washington, D.C., she helped Dolley Madison and Louisa Adams raise money to build the Washington Monument. By 1846, Eliza was suffering from short-term memory loss but was still vividly recalling her husband. Eliza died in Washington, D.C. on November 9, 1854, at age 97. She had outlived her husband by 50 years, and had outlived all but one of her siblings (her youngest sister, Catherine, 24 years her junior). Eliza was buried near her husband in the graveyard of Trinity Church in New York City. Angelica was also laid to rest at Trinity, in the Livingstons' private vault, while Eliza's eldest son Philip had an unmarked grave near the churchyard. Children Elizabeth and Alexander Hamilton had eight children: * Philip (January 22, 1782 – November 23, 1801), who was killed in a duel three years before his father's fatal duel * Angelica (September 25, 1784 – February 6, 1857), who suffered a mental breakdown after her older brother's death and lived to the age of 72 in a state described as \\"eternal childhood,\\" unable to care for herself * Alexander, Jr. (May 16, 1786 – August 2, 1875) * James Alexander (April 14, 1788 – September 24, 1878), who acted as Secretary of State for 23 days in March 1829 * John Church (August 22, 1792 – July 25, 1882) * William Stephen (August 4, 1797 – October 9, 1850) * Eliza (November 20, 1799 – October 17, 1859), who married Sidney Augustus Holly * Philip, also called \\"Little Phil\\" (June 1, 1802 – July 9, 1884), named after his older brother that had died one year before his birth The Hamiltons also raised Frances (Fanny) Antill, an orphan who lived with them for ten years beginning in 1787 when she was 2 years old. In popular culture Broadway musical Hamilton by Phillipa Soo. * Doris Kenyon portrayed Eliza in the 1931 film Alexander Hamilton. * Eliza appeared in the 1986 television series George Washington II: The Forging of a Nation, where she is affectionately called Betsy, portrayed by Eve Gordon. * Eliza is portrayed in the 2015 Broadway musical Hamilton. The role was originated by Phillipa Soo, who received a 2016 Tony Award nomination for her work in the show. Eliza's depiction in the musical has attracted praise from critics and commentators for emphasizing both her importance in her husband's life and her own work in propagating his legacy,Various sources: * * an approach it shares with its inspiration and source, Ron Chernow's 2004 biography of Alexander Hamilton.

History The Holy Trinity is the Relational Matrix of Life \\"create, love, act\\". This school's name honours the prominent place of the Holy Trinity in the Christian faith. The school was founded in 2002 and has been located at its current site since 2002. CASA Holy Trinity is home to a Centre for Autism Spectrum Assistance program (CASA). The program works with autistic children and uses dedicated teachers, specially designed classrooms and a Snoezelen room. The program supports 12 students. Athletic programs Holy Trinity has won several championships since opening in sports such as football, basketball, soccer, hockey, and have had students earn medals in wrestling. The Senior Girls' Basketball team has made two consecutive appearances in the provincial championships (2005, 2006). Senior Boys' (2005, 2009) and Senior Girls' (2007) Soccer teams have also made appearances in the provincial championships. The school is home to the 2007 'AA' LOSSA Junior Girls', Senior Girls' and Junior Boys' Soccer champions. Football = Senior = Football has been played at Holy Trinity since 2004, when the school started with a junior team only. Senior started the following year in 2005. Under head coach Fred Zinkie, the senior team finished the 2005 season 1–6 with its only win vs Courtice Secondary School. Although a losing season, it was the first for the senior team, and the team and coaching staff were not deterred. One year later, Holy Trinity finished with a 4-2 regular season, qualifying for the LOSSA playoffs in only their second year of existence. They faced a then strong Dunbarton, where they lost 42–13. However, this was a vast improvement from the year before, and laid the path for team that would become one of the strongest and most consistent in LOSSA. As the seasons went on, the team moved up the rankings. In 2008, the senior team captured first place in the Tier 1 Hiron Division with a 5–1 record. As a note, this was reached due to a technical win against Pickering High School, who fielded an ineligible player in the season opener. However, the senior team played in its first LOSSA Final, losing to a very strong Donald A. Wilson. This started a rivalry that would last for years. In 2009, the senior team went undefeated during the regular season with a 6–0 record. Eastdale was defeated 46–7 in the quarter finals. Rival Wilson was the opponent in the semi final with home field advantage. Holy Trinity was leading until the last minutes of the game, when Wilson would score to move ahead 20–15, denying Holy Trinity to return to the LOSSA Final. The rivalry with Wilson grew stronger. In 2010, the senior team had another good regular season. The last regular season game was against Wilson, where Holy Trinity lost a close 25–21 game. However, the team still qualified for the LOSSA playoffs. During the semi final vs St. Mary on their home field, Holy Trinity lead by Dan Fedirko came back from a 27–28 deficit to win 29–28 with two rouges from punter Tyler Ganhao in the final minutes of the game. The team would move to the final vs Wilson, who had defeated Pickering 15–0 in the other semi final. In the LOSSA Championship on November 13 at Clarington Fields, the two rivals were locked in a back and forth final game. With only 47 seconds left in the 4th quarter, Holy Trinity scored with a Stephen Thompson touchdown and a Joe Mastromarco single point to go ahead 33–31. However, Wilson was not to be counted out. At the start of the drive in their end, a late hit on the Wilson quarterback by Akil Goodridge after a successful long pass put Wilson in field goal range with only 5 seconds on the clock. Surprisingly, Chivon Gallagher, one of Wilson's best players, missed the field goal attempt wide to gain only the single point, ending with a 33–32 victory for Holy Trinity over its bitter rival Wilson in the school's first LOSSA championship. The team would go on to defeat first Upper Canada College in the Metro Bowl semi final, and then dominating the King City Lions 28–3 at the Roger's Centre in Toronto for the team's first Metro Bowl Championship. The rivalry with Wilson continued into the 2011 season. Tier one this season consisted of only four teams: Holy Trinity, Donald A. Wilson, Pickering and St. Mary. All were very good teams ensuring that there would be no easy games. Holy Trinity would lose its first two games. First to Pickering 28–13, and then to Wilson 49–28. With a 15–7 win vs St. Mary, Holy Trinity had to face Pickering in the semi finals. The team beat Pickering 21–13, and Wilson beat St. Mary 55–14. Holy Trinity and Wilson would meet in the final once again. The game remained extremely close, with the half time score 1-0 for Wilson. At the end of the 3rd quarter, Holy Trinity was leading 7–4. However, Wilson would score two touchdowns and a field goal to pull ahead. Holy Trinity had a late game touchdown, but it was not enough and was defeated 18–7. The 2012 season was almost a repeat of the previous, with only four teams in Tier one: Holy Trinity, Wilson, Pickering and Paul Dwyer (St. Mary had moved to Tier two and Dwyer had moved up). Holy Trinity would lose to Wilson 34–24 in the season opener, and then again to Paul Dwyer 35–30. The Dwyer game was their Homecoming game on Saturday, September 29. Holy Trinity was leading 30–11 with only 2:32 left in the 4th quarter. Incredibly, Paul Dwyer successfully completed three consecutive onside kicks and touchdowns in less than one minute of game time to win the game 35–30. Holy Trinity would avenge the loss beating Paul Dwyer 30-7 later in the season. With two wins also against Pickering, and a win against Wilson 14–9, Holy Trinity would face Paul Dwyer again in the semi final. Holy Trinity quickly fell behind in the 1st quarter, and hopes of moving to the final were waning. However, Holy Trinity scored 20 unanswered points to finish the game with a narrow 28–27 victory. They would again face Wilson, who had beat Pickering 32–6. In the final, Wilson would score three unanswered touchdowns in the 1st quarter. Holy Trinity came back in the 2nd quarter with two touchdowns and a field goal, but again it wasn't enough and again lost to Wilson 42–20 in the LOSSA final. The 2013 season saw all teams in one tier again. Holy Trinity opened with wins against Eastdale, Paul Dwyer, and Ajax. They would then lose the next two, first 20-8 vs St. Mary, and then 13-7 vs Pickering. Holy Trinity finished the regular season with a sound 21–0 win over former rival Wilson to move to the LOSSA playoffs. In the semi final, Holy Trinity beat Pickering 17–6 to face St. Mary, who had beat Dwyer 35–14. It was again another very close LOSSA final, with Holy Trinity trailing 28-20 late in the 4th quarter. As a last hope, Holy Trinity had the ball on the St. Mary 1-yard line, but was unsuccessful in two attempts to score with the possibility of tying the game and going to overtime. Holy Trinity would lost in the championship again, but this time to St. Mary, who would go on to beat Westgate from Thunder Bay in the OFSAA Bowl. The 2014 season was the first time that Holy Trinity did not make it to the LOSSA Senior Final since 2010. Holy Trinity finished with a 4-2 regular season. They would beat St. Mary in the quarter final, but then lose to Pickering in the semi final. Pickering would go on to lose to Dwyer in the LOSSA Final. This would be the last year that Fred Zinkie would be the Holy Trinity Senior football coach. In 2015, Holy Trinity would finish with a perfect 6-0 regular season. The most memorable game was the regular season final vs Paul Dwyer in the tail end of the hurricane that hit the area. Under heavy winds and rain, Holy Trinity would defeat last year's champions Paul Dywer in overtime. However, they met again in the LOSSA Final. Holy Trinity gained a healthy lead early in the game, but Dwyer would crawl back to tie the game in the 4th quarter. A last minute rouge attempt to pull ahead for the win was unsuccessful, so overtime was again required. Dywer would score first in overtime, and Holy Trinity could not respond. Holy Trinity would again finish second in LOSSA for the 5th time. = Junior = The Junior Football team captured first place in the LOSSA Tier I Hiron Division in 2008, carrying a 5–1 record. They advanced to the Championship game, but failed in their attempt to capture the first LOSSA Junior Football title for the school. They earned a berth into the Ontario Regional Junior Football Championship playdowns, where they travelled to Blessed Trinity Catholic Secondary School in Grimsby four days after losing in the LOSSA Championship. The team also went down to defeat in this game, ending the longest and most successful Junior Football season in school history. Other extra-curricular programs The school offers a variety of non- athletic programs including dramatic, musical, academic, and social justice clubs. The Holy Trinity drama department puts on a performance every year. Holy Trinity has a Student Cabinet, elected each spring, that has donated over $100 000 to the community since its inception. The HT Student Cabinet led a Terry Fox Foundation fundraising campaign in September 2010, setting a school fundraising record of over $30 000. Holy Trinity has a student-teacher-run program named \\"Trinity Earth\\" that raises awareness of environmental issues within the school and throughout the community at large. Trinity Earth has been instrumental in removing industry bottled water from our school board through education and the instalment of water bottle filling fountains in each school. They have started a large community garden outside the community church. Have planted many memorial trees, participated in educational activities with elementary school aged kids including CLOCA water shed program, garbage clean ups in wooded areas, community yard sales to premote reuse as a very important \\"R\\".

He currently resides in Omaha, Nebraska, United States. Early life Obermeyer was born on March 12, 1978 in Auburn, Nebraska. He was raised on a farm around Auburn. During his time there he was very active in many extra-curricular activities, but most notably for Cross Country and Journalism. He graduated from Auburn High School as Valedictorian of the class of 1996. It was during this time that he began his first cartoon serial, \\"The Adventures of Planarian Man,\\" which was published in the Auburn Press-Tribune. He later went on to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He continued some work with Planarian Man, but also became the editorial cartoonist for the Daily Nebraskan (the University of Nebraska's paper) and a disc jockey on KRNU (the University of Nebraska's radio station). Career Obermeyer has been an editorial cartoonist since 1999.1 He started at the Daily Nebraskan. After graduation he moved to San Diego and started cartooning for the San Diego Reader in January 2002. In the summer of 2004, he began to work on the Lincoln Journal-Star, alternating with Paul Fell. In March 2006, he started a bi-weekly stint as cartoonist of the Omaha City Weekly. Out of this came a new job working for The Reader (newspaper) that started in October 2006 that continues today in addition to his jobs for the Lincoln Journal-Star and the San Diego Reader. He also has contributed to HappyYoungPeople.com. Slant Though raised in Nebraska, which leans extremely right, many of his cartoons are made of people who repeat Republican or right-Wing jargon thoughtlessly. His favorite Journal-Star and Omaha Reader cartoon targets are local politicians. He also likes to point out the hypocrisy of people of all leanings, sometimes using \\"Sneaky Donkey\\" to show the hypocrisy of the Republicans or \\"Stupid Donkey\\" to show the flaws of the Democrats. Many of his Journal-Star and Omaha Reader cartoons deal with local issues, such as the flawed thinking of some officials as they try to build business in Omaha, Lincoln, and State of Nebraska. In the San Diego Reader, he tends to focus more on local government corruption and oddities. Obermeyer also has a few trademarks: # Former Lincoln mayor Coleen Seng is always in a flowered dress or a flowered top. # Former councilman Ken Svoboda is always pictured as Magnum, P.I. # The State Capital is always talking when representing the unicameral legislature's decision making. Other interests He also has dabbled in other projects. He has done editorial projects, such as \\"Neal Obermeyer Is All out of Bubblegum\\" with the \\"Switch\\" section3 of the Lincoln Journal-Star, which was closely linked to \\"Ground Zero\\", published by the Journal Star. He also did a series called \\"The Bearded Odyssey\\" with the Daily Nebraskan. He likes to work with music and video. His biggest contribution in this area was working at KRNU and created the show, \\"You are so Beautiful, Beautiful Robot\\". Most of this show is dedicated to electronic music or electronic elements in music. Neal hosts this show through a Mac voice converter. He has also made four documentaries with one in post- production. The subjects of these documentaries range from a man who lived in his van to Nebraska's version of bigfoot legends. Currently he is working on a documentary on real-life superheroes.

The term has been used in philosophy by Plato to designate a receptacle (as a “third kind” [triton genos]; Timaeus 48e4), a space, a material substratum, or an interval. In Plato's account, khôra is described as a formless interval, alike to a non-being, in between which the \\"Forms\\" were received from the intelligible realm (where they were originally held) and were \\"copied\\", shaping into the transitory forms of the sensible realm; it \\"gives space\\" and has maternal overtones (a womb, matrix): > So likewise it is right that the substance which is to be fitted to receive > frequently over its whole extent the copies of all things intelligible and > eternal should itself, of its own nature, be void of all the forms. > Wherefore, let us not speak of her that is the Mother and Receptacle of this > generated world, which is perceptible by sight and all the senses, by the > name of earth or air or fire or water, or any aggregates or constituents > thereof: rather, if we describe her as a Kind invisible and unshaped, all- > receptive, and in some most perplexing and most baffling way partaking of > the intelligible, we shall describe her truly. > — Plato, Timaeus, 51a Jacques Derrida has written a short text with the title Khôra,Derrida J., Khôra, Paris: Galilée 1993. using his deconstructionist approach to investigate Plato's word usage. It is the origin for the recent interest in this rather obscure Greek term. Overview Key authors addressing khôra include Martin Heidegger, who refers to a \\"clearing\\" in which being happens or takes place. Julia Kristeva deploys the term as part of her analysis of the difference between the semiotic and symbolic realms, in that Plato's concept of \\"khora\\" is said to anticipate the emancipatory employment of semiotic activity as a way of evading the allegedly phallocentric character of symbolic activity (signification through language), which, following Jacques Lacan, is regarded as an inherently limiting and oppressive form of praxis. Julia Kristeva articulates the khôra in terms of a presignifying state: \\"Although the khôra can be designated and regulated, it can never be definively posited: as a result, one can situate the khôra and, if necessary, lend it a topology, but one can never give it axiomatic form.\\"Kristeva, J. 1984 Revolution in Poetic Language. New York, Columbia University Press. p. 26. Jacques Derrida uses khôra to name a radical otherness that \\"gives place\\" for being. Nader El- Bizri builds on this by more narrowly taking khôra to name the radical happening of an ontological difference between being and beings.(Nader El- Bizri, 2004, 2011) El-Bizri's reflections on \\"khôra\\" are taken as a basis for tackling the meditations on dwelling and on being and space in Heidegger's thought and the critical conceptions of space and place as they evolved in architectural theory and in history of philosophy and science, with a focus on geometry and optics.(Nader El-Bizri, 2001, 2004, 2011, 2015) Derrida argues that the subjectile is like Plato’s khôra, Greek for space, receptacle or site. Plato proposes that the khôra rests between the sensible and the intelligible, through which everything passes but in which nothing remains. For example, an image needs to be held by something, just as a mirror will hold a reflection. For Derrida, khôra defies attempts at naming or either/or logic, which he \\"deconstructs\\". See also Derrida's collaborative project with architect Peter Eisenmann, in Chora L Works: Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman.Chora L Works: Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman The project proposed the construction of a garden in the Parc de la Villette in Paris, which included a sieve, or harp-like structure that Derrida envisaged as a physical metaphor for the receptacle-like properties of the khôra. Following Derrida, John Caputo describes khôra as: > neither present nor absent, active or passive, the good nor evil, living nor > nonliving - but rather atheological and nonhuman - khôra is not even a > receptacle. Khôra has no meaning or essence, no identity to fall back upon. > She/it receives all without becoming anything, which is why she/it can > become the subject of neither a philosopheme nor mytheme. In short, the > khôra is tout autre [fully other], very. If, as one contributor concludes, \\"khôra\\" means \\"space\\", it is an interesting space that \\"at times appears to be neither this nor that, at times both this and that,\\" wavering \\"between the logic of exclusion and that of participation.\\" (Derrida, The Name, 89).

Ramsey spent his entire career in the American Association, split between two different teams. He played for the Louisville Colonels and St. Louis Browns. He is sometimes credited as the inventor of the knuckleball pitch, and was one of the top pitchers in the Association for more than two years, with statistics that put him in the top five in multiple pitching categories. Career =Louisville= Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, and a former bricklayer, Ramsey is credited as the inventor of the knuckleball pitch. He had severed the tendon in the index finger of his pitching hand with a trowel. The result was that Ramsey's pitches had a natural knuckleball motion. He threw with a fastball motion, holding the ball with his index finger retracted, since he could not straighten it, and with just his finger tip on the ball. Some historians have disputed that he threw a knuckleball in the modern sense, in that his ball movement was like what is now known as knuckle curve. While playing for the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern League, Ramsey pitched a no-hitter on May 30, 1885, against the Nashville Americans in a road game where only three players reached base, two via walks and one on an error. On August 29, Chattanooga traded him to Louisville Colonels of the American Association in exchange for John Connor and $750. He was brought in to spell star pitcher Guy Hecker, who had a sore arm, and made his major league debut on September 5, in a complete game 4-3 loss to the St. Louis Browns. In that first season with the Colonels, he started nine games, completing them all with a 3-6 win-loss record. For the season, his first full season in the majors, Ramsey became the number one starting pitcher for the Colonels, sharing starts with Hecker. Ramsey logged in a league leading 588⅔ innings and 66 complete games in 67 starts. In addition to his league leading statistics that season, his earned run average of 2.45 and 38 wins were good for third in the league. His 499 strikeouts that season finished second behind Matt Kilroy's record setting total of 513. Ramsey's total is the second-highest total in major league history. Ramsey and Hecker's relationship steadily became more at odds the more the Ramsey's status with the team grew. At one point, Ramsey said that Hecker was jealous of his success and it would be good for the team if Hecker were released. Ramsey had a similar season, pitching 561 innings and winning 37 games. His 355 strikeouts led the American Association, while his 561 innings pitched, 64 games started, and 61 complete games, were all second in the league to Kilroy. Unfortunately, his dominant years stopped after that season, and his fortunes changed for the worse beginning during the season. His win-loss record was 8-30 in 40 starts. On July 25, 1888, Ramsey was arrested for not paying an overdue bar bill. =St. Louis= His season began the way his 1888 season went, winning one game in his 18 starts with Louisville. On July 17, he was traded to the St. Louis Browns for Nat Hudson. He pitched in just five games the rest of season, but did go 3-1 and had an ERA of 3.95. He returned with St. Louis for the season, and pitched his last season in the majors. He had a record of 24-17, struck out 257 batters, and had an ERA of 3.69 in 348⅔ innings pitched. Ramsey was released by St. Louis on September 19, 1890, and he never returned to the majors. Death Ramsey died of pneumonia in his hometown of Indianapolis at the age of 41, and is interred at Crown Hill Cemetery.

The problem  On 2 April 2007, FIFA informed Cork City that they would not allow two players, Irish internationals Colin Healy and Gareth Farrelly, to play for the club. FIFA ruled that the players had already played for two other clubs in the previous 12 months, and so decreed that neither player could play until July 2007. Cork City had signed contracts with these two players, and so the options open to them were either to keep paying the players even though they cannot play, or cancel the contracts. The players Both Colin Healy and Gareth Farrelly have represented the Republic of Ireland at senior international level. Gareth Farrelly has played at the highest level in England, in the Premier League, with Aston Villa, Everton and Bolton Wanderers. Farrelly joined Bohemians in late August 2004 as player-manager, and left the position on 30 August 2006. He subsequently joined English side Blackpool on a short-term contract, which expired in February 2007. Colin Healy has played with Celtic and Sunderland, where he had the extreme misfortune to break his leg on two occasions. On 10 August 2006, Healy signed a one-year contract with Barnsley. After making 10 appearances for Barnsley, he had his contract cancelled by mutual consent. During this period, he also played on loan with Bradford City. The rule According to the then-current FIFA Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players, Chapter III: Registration of Players, Article 5.3 stated: The precedent # The Finnish Football Federation, an association that also has its season within a calendar year, just like Ireland, simply ignores this rule, because their season is \\"out of sync\\" with the FIFA designated season. Any player who signs for a Finnish club, and who is in the same situation as Colin Healy or Gareth Farrelly, is allowed to play in official matches in Finland. # A more telling precedent is the case of Javier Mascherano. FIFA allowed Mascherano, an Argentine international, to join Liverpool, his third team in the 12-month period, from West Ham United. FIFA ruled that as the other team involved, Corinthians, is from Brazil and so competes in a January-December season, they were outside the scope of the July-June restriction. # A number of players with other League of Ireland sides have also been caught by Article 5.3, but have since been cleared to play. One of these players is Shaun Holmes who was registered with 3 clubs Glentoran, Derry and Finn Harps. Glentoran is a Northern Irish League club, a league that follows the FIFA designated season. Shaun Holmes has played for a club in a different federation, the same situation as both Farrelly and Healy, but this fact has not proved a barrier to him playing in the eircom League this season. The law It was possible that the FIFA regulations at that time could conflict with certain provisions of European Community law, or, at the very least, an arguable case could be made that such a conflict existed. Article 39EC states: # Freedom of movement for workers shall be secured within the Community # Such freedom of movement shall entail the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment # It shall entail the right, subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health: a) to accept offers of employment actually made; b) to move freely within the territory of Member States for this purpose; c) to stay in a Member State for the purpose of employment in accordance with the provisions governing the employment of nationals of that State laid down by law, regulation or administrative action; d) to remain in the territory of a Member State after having been employed in that State, subject to conditions which shall be embodied in implementing regulations to be drawn up by the Commission Article 40 b EC states: The Council shall, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 (which refers to EC procedures for the adoption of Acts) and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee, issue directives or make regulations setting out the measures required to bring about freedom of movement for workers, as defined in Article 39, in particular: b) by abolishing those administrative procedures and practices and those qualifying periods in respect of eligibility for available employment, whether resulting from national legislation or from agreements previously concluded between Member States, the maintenance of which would form an obstacle to liberalisation of the movement of workers; Article 43EC states: Within the framework of the provisions set out below, restrictions on the freedom of establishment of nationals of a Member State in the territory of another Member State shall be prohibited. Such prohibition shall also apply to restrictions on the setting-up of agencies, branches or subsidiaries by nationals of any Member State established in the territory of any Member State. Freedom of establishment shall include the right to take up and pursue activities as self-employed persons and to set up and manage undertakings, in particular companies or firms within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 48, under the conditions laid down for its own nationals by the law of the country where such establishment is effected, subject to the provisions of the chapter relating to capital. There are also various Directives which govern Freedom of Movement of People.

These courses are taught in the Foreign Service Institute at the National Foreign Affairs Training Center in Arlington, Virginia. The purpose of the class is to provide orientation to the United States Department of State, information on embassy operation and foreign affairs, intelligence collection and dissemination, State Department computer systems, and the roles different categories of personnel perform in the conduct of diplomacy. It is the basic job-orientation course for the United States Foreign Service before diplomats branch off into different career tracks or geographic specialties. Training The class ranges from five to six weeks long and typically has between 75 and 100 students. During the first day of the class, students learn about their classmates and give presentations on them. The first week of the class is devoted to security briefings, the issuing of State Department identification cards, and indoctrination into the more classified aspects of the Foreign Service. The class is an opportunity to learn about the Foreign Service, not a discussion forum for foreign policy; as public servants, Foreign Service Officers, when acting in their official capacity, are obligated to defend publicly and to implement the foreign policy directives and objectives of the federal government of the United States, notwithstanding any personal or political reservations.Of course, FSOs are free to hold whatever political beliefs they may have, and to participate in the U.S. political process in their capacity as private citizens, but they cannot let their personal views influence their actions or words in their official capacity. A dissent channel for FSOs exists to make their professional opinions known about foreign policy issues with which they have a professional difference of opinion, and policy has been known to have been changed as the result of the use of this channel. One famous example of the use of this channel involves the Blood Telegram during the Bangladesh Liberation War; other uses that are also publicly known or alluded to include dissents with regard to policy in the Balkans following the collapse of Yugoslavia. Subsequent weeks examine State Department organizational structure, drafting and editing, the organizational structure of an Embassy, public speaking, and protocol. While the majority of the class takes place at the National Foreign Affairs Training Center, there are some field trips to other U.S. government foreign affairs agencies, as well as off site team-building training that lasts for two days and normally takes place at a military base in West Virginia. Towards the end of the course, students are informed of their first assignments, usually overseas, during the \\"Flag Day\\" ceremony, so named because they are presented with a small flag of the country to which they have been assigned. After A-100, additional training is personalized to the individual depending on his or her overseas posting and/or language ability and post requirements. Members often maintain contact with each other throughout their entire careers, and regard A-100 classmates much like high school or college classmates. A-100 classes are numbered sequentially. The class numbers were restarted with the enactment of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, and several groups have shared numbers over the years. History In function, if not name, the A-100 Class dates back to June 7, 1924, when President Coolidge issued Executive Order 4022 establishing a Foreign Service School for the purpose of training newly hired probationary Foreign Service Officers (FSOs). The Foreign Service School's first class was conducted from April 20 until September 1, 1925, and \\"graduated\\" a class of 17. According to tradition, the \\"100\\" in A-100 refers to the number of the room in which the course was first conducted. The State Department's 1926 Telephone Directory confirms that the Foreign Service School was located in Room 100 of the State, War, and Navy Building. Additional details can be found in Ambassador Ellis O. Briggs' autobiography: Proud Servant: The Memoirs of a Career Ambassador. Ambassador Briggs recounts his experiences in preparing for the 1925 Foreign Service examination—the written and oral tests that were instituted after the Rogers Act of 1924 established the Foreign Service as \\"a competitive, nonpolitical, professional career\\". Ambassador Briggs says that \\"simultaneously there came into existence in the Department of State, in Room 100 on the ground floor of the old State War Navy Building, a modest enterprise called the Foreign Service School\\". He goes on to explain that, in order to provide new officers with an initial \\"home office indoctrination\\" and avoid the problems that might result if officers' initial training was entirely entrusted to overseas supervisors whose quality and interest level \\"varied from post to post\\", it was decided to organize \\"a course of several months in the State Department before a new officer was sent to his first foreign assignment\\". Ambassador Briggs concludes that \\"until after World War II, the Foreign Service School remained an unpretentious institution, concentrating on unraveling consular regulations and language instruction\\". With the Foreign Service Act of 1946 a new Foreign Service training program, patterned after programs in the Army and Navy, came into existence. The newly established Foreign Service Institute (FSI) included a \\"School of Basic Officer Training\\" (with classes distinguished by the letter \\"B\\" preceding a three-digit course number). An \\"A\\" prefix was used to identify courses administered by the separate \\"School of Advanced Officer Training\\". FSI's 1949 Course Catalog includes \\"B 100\\"—a basic training course prescribed for all newly appointed Foreign Service officers. The separate \\"A 100\\" course involved three months of intensive training for Foreign Service officers following the successful conclusion of their probationary years in the field. By 1955, however, these separate schools had been eliminated. In the 1955–56 FSI course catalog, the training programs for junior, mid-level, and senior-level officers are all found under the heading of \\"General Career Training\\". The B-100 course had vanished, but A-100 survived as the three-month \\"Junior Foreign Service Officers' Course\\" which was \\"required of all newly appointed Foreign Service officers of class 6 before assignment to their first post abroad\\".

In November, 1882, he married 18-year old Mary Driscoll of Westford, Massachusetts. Soon afterwards he moved to Westford, most likely in the village of Graniteville, as the Casey family members were employed in the local granite quarries and mills. After the death of his father-in-law, Driscoll supported the Casey family with his baseball salary. In vital records of the early 1880s, he alternately listed his occupation as 'ball player' or 'machinist'.

Goodwin is best known as the lead singer, bassist, and guitarist for Doves, but in songs like \\"Here It Comes\\", he is known for swapping positions with drummer Andy Williams and taking over as drummer. During live performances of \\"There Goes the Fear\\", he is known for adding an extra drum solo to the end of the song. Goodwin is left-handed, but whilst playing live uses a right-handed bass strung in the normal tuning and flipped upside down. Goodwin is a keen supporter of Manchester City, and performed live at Maine Road following the last ever league game played there. Family In 1985, Goodwin was playing lead guitar in a band called the Risk, which included his cousin Pat Goodwin on drums. Goodwin's mother died while Doves were recording their third album Some Cities. Doves' fourth studio album Kingdom of Rust is dedicated to Goodwin's father, Francis James Goodwin, who died aged 65 on 23 December 2008. In the booklet for the Clash's 2007 compilation album The Singles, the page discussing the track \\"I Fought the Law\\" features commentary from Goodwin. He cites his father for introducing him to punk rock and the Clash: Collaborations Goodwin joined Bernard Sumner and Johnny Marr's band Electronic to play bass on their 1999 third album, Twisted Tenderness. He had previously appeared in the video for the band's single \\"For You\\" from their 1996 album Raise the Pressure although Marr is credited with playing bass on this album. Goodwin contributed guitar work to the song \\"Heaven\\" on Lamb's 2001 album, What Sound. This song was later used by HBO during the second season of American television drama series Six Feet Under, and also appears on the Six Feet Under soundtrack. While acting as a guest host on a BBC Radio One show in 2005, Goodwin featured his friend and up-and-coming musician Simon Aldred (Cherry Ghost), who performed a live acoustic set. Then, in 2007, Goodwin played bass and drums on Cherry Ghost's debut single \\"Mathematics\\" and their song \\"People Help the People\\". Goodwin contributed vocals to the song \\"Kingdoms of Rain\\" on the Soulsavers and Mark Lanegan album It's Not How Far You Fall, It's the Way You Land in 2007. Doves and Soulsavers have worked together previously in various forms, as Soulsavers remixed the Doves' song \\"Satellites\\", which appeared on the \\"Pounding\\" single in 2002. In an interview with the Daily Record, Goodwin stated that the Doves will take a break from recording. In the time following the band's 2010 touring to support The Places Between: The Best of Doves, Goodwin revealed that he's hoping to collaborate with friend and Elbow lead singer Guy Garvey after talking about recording songs together for years. \\"There are a couple of tracks that we have passed back and forwards to each other but it's having the time. We keep trying to get our diaries together, who knows if it will ever get released. I'm just waiting to see what might happen.\\" Goodwin and Garvey have collaborated in the past, with each musician's respective band. Goodwin contributed backing vocals to \\"Grace Under Pressure\\" on Elbow's 2003 album Cast of Thousands, while Garvey sang backing vocals on \\"Snowden\\" and \\"Almost Forgot Myself\\" on Doves' 2005 album Some Cities. Solo projects On the second episode in season ten of RTÉ's Other Voices programme, Goodwin played two new songs, \\"Panic Tree\\" and \\"Didsbury Girl\\" featuring Cherry Ghost. Goodwin released his first solo studio album titled Odludek on 24 March 2014, and will be touring in support of the album as a supporting act of friends Elbow.

A durable control pitcher, Stratton frequently played in the outfield on days when he didn't pitch because of his hitting and fielding skills. He played for the Louisville Colonels, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Chicago Colts. Stratton's greatest season was his third, in 1890. As a 20-year-old, he pitched 431 innings for Louisville, going 34–14 and setting a major league record for starting 25 consecutive games that his team won. He led the American Association with a 2.36 earned run average, and the Colonels won the pennant. In three World Series starts, he went 1–1.

Robert Hartley Cromek (1770–1812) was an English engraver, editor, art dealer and entrepreneur who was most active in the early nineteenth century. He is best known for having allegedly cheated William Blake out of the potential profits of his engraving depicting Chaucer's Canterbury Pilgrims. In the early years of the nineteenth century Cromek had supported Blake, and had engraved Blake's design for Benjamin Heath Malkin's A Father's Memoirs of his Child in 1806. Cromek later commissioned Blake to illustrate Robert Blair's poem The Grave. Blake had produced the designs, but his sample engraving was considered by Cromek to be too crude to attract subscribers. Cromek then gave the lucrative job of engraving Blake's designs to a rival engraver Luigi Schiavonetti. In response, Blake proceeded to create a self-engraved illustration to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Cromek, however, had also given the idea to Blake's friend Thomas Stothard. Stothard's print became far more popular than Blake's, at least during their lifetimes. It remains unclear whether Blake or Cromek originated this project, but Blake certainly believed that the idea was stolen from him. The incident destroyed the friendship between Blake and Stothard.Blake v. Cromek: A Contemporary Ruling, J. B. Mertz, Modern Philology, Vol. 99, No. 1 (Aug., 2001), pp. 66-77 As a savagely humorous comment on these events Blake wrote epigrams attacking Cromek:Keynes, Geoffrey, Blake: Complete Writings with variant readings, Oxford University Press, 1972, p.540 > Cromek loves artists as he loves his meat: > He loves the Art; but 'tis the art to cheat. > > A petty sneaking knave I knew-- > \\"O! Mr. Cromek, how do ye do?\\" In 1809 Cromek published Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song, a collection of Scottish ballads. The aspirant poet Allan Cunningham sent in poems of his own authorship, which Cromek included in the collection, even though he may have suspected their real authorship. About that time Cromek also compiled \\"RELIQUES OF ROBERT BURNS; Consisting Chiefly of Original Letters, Poems, and Critical Observations on Scottish Songs \\". The original edition of 1808 contained a 4-page work by Thomas Stothard, \\"The Procession of Chaucer's Pilgrims to Canterbury\\", which did not appear in some later editions. His son was the artist Thomas Hartley Cromek.

Pohl rejected \\"The Portable Star\\", telling Asimov in no uncertain terms how bad the story was. It was also rejected by John W. Campbell for Astounding Science Fiction and H. L. Gold for Galaxy Science Fiction. Asimov finally sold it on May 25 to Sam Mines of Thrilling Wonder. Asimov reread the story when it was published, and decided that Pohl, Campbell, and Gold had been right in considering it a bad story. In his autobiography In Joy Still Felt, Asimov states that \\"The Portable Star\\" was his least favorite story of all time. \\"I wasn't aware of what I was doing when I wrote it, but on reading it after it was published it seemed to me that I was deliberately trying to put sex into it to try to keep up with a new trend.\\"Page 19 Asimov never allowed the story to be reprinted, or put it in one of his collections. The only other time it appeared in Asimov's lifetime was when the publishers of Thrilling Wonder exercised their right to reprint the story, placing it in a one-shot magazine called A Treasury of Great Science Fiction Stories without Asimov's permission. It was also reprinted (with the permission of the Asimov estate) in 2007, when Winston Engle revived Thrilling Wonder Stories with an anthology of mixed reprint and new stories. Plot summary The story concerns two couples, the Brookses and the Van Hornes, who go on a six-month space tour in a \\"flivver\\" owned by Holden Brooks. When the flivvers suffers a malfunction, they land on an uninhabited planet with a nitrogen-argon atmosphere to make repairs. The planet, it turns out, is not uninhabited after all. A race of energy beings lives there, and a group of them take over the humans' bodies and begin manipulating their emotions, leading to a sexually charged encounter between Holden Brooks and Celestine Van Horne, and an attempt by Holden to murder Celestine's husband. Holden realizes that the energy beings are actually children, and he manages to use an open flame (which they have never seen before, and which is the \\"portable star\\" of the title) to frighten them away long enough to regain control of himself and flee the planet. Foundation timeline \\"The Portable Star\\" was accompanied in the Winter 1955 issue of Thrilling Wonder Stories with a timeline of the Foundation series which included the story, along with a number of others. The timeline does not include any of the stories from I, Robot, as well as the novel The Caves of Steel, since at this time Asimov considered the Robot series separate from the Foundation series. { class = \\"wikitable\\" !

He founded the Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung (Institute for New Testament Textual Research) in Münster and served as its first director from 1959–83. He was one of the principal editors of Nestle-Aland – Novum Testamentum Graece for the Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft and The Greek New Testament for the United Bible Societies.  Life  Aland was born in Berlin- Steglitz. He started studying theology in 1933 at the Friedrich-Wilhelms- Universität in Berlin (he also studied philology, archaeology, and history). On 23 March that year he was examined before the Bruderrat (council of brothers) in the Bekennende Kirche (Confessing Church). During his studies, he worked for the journal of the Confessing Church, Junge Kirche (Young Church). In an ideological brochure, Wer fälscht? (Who is lying?), written against Mathilde Ludendorff, he confirmed the position of the Confessing Church and identified with them. In 1939 he studied for his bachelor's degree under the guidance of Hans Lietzmann. In 1940 he was released from military service; and in 1941, after Lietzmann's death, he took over the responsibilities of editing the Theologische Literaturzeitung (the only German theological magazine at that time). He graduated that same year, and in 1944 was ordained as minister of the parish of Berlin-Steglitz. After World War II, Aland became a lecturer on the theological faculty of the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1947 he was appointed professor ordinarius in Halle (Saale). Aland disapproved of the Marxist government of East Germany, and was persecuted as a result. In 1953 he was accused of smuggling watches to West Berlin and was kept under arrest for three months. Aland frequently spoke out against various forms of state oppression directed at churches and also demanded freedom of speech in East Germany. In July 1958, he lost his job at the university. However, in September of that year, he successfully escaped to West Berlin. His 8000-volume library was incorporated into the University Library. In 1958 he became a professor at the University of Münster, Germany. Aland rejected a professorship of the University of Chicago in 1960.Kurt Aland - In Memoriam, 1995, p. 15'Archive of the University of Münster/Germany In Münster he founded the Institute for New Testament Textual Research (\\"Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung\\") in 1959, which he directed until 1983. Furthermore, he founded the world's first \\"Bible Museum\\" in 1979, which was unique in the world for many years. His institute achieved worldwide recognition by publishing the Nestle-Aland - Novum Testamentum Graece and The Greek New Testament for the United Bible Societies. Aland was married twice. His first marriage was to Ingeborg Aland (they had three children together). In 1972 he married Barbara Aland. He died in Münster, Germany in 1994.  Relevance  Barbara and Kurt Aland visiting Pope John Paul II (1984) Kurt Aland was representative of increasing specialism within theological- historical studies.. In the field of New Testament research, his work (and also the work that he did together with his wife Barbara Aland in the Institute for New Testament Textual Research in Münster) is internationally acclaimed. The focus of his work began as an intense and adventurous search for old manuscripts on several expeditions to abbeys in Russia and Greece (amongst others). He discovered numerous manuscripts of the New Testament, whose evaluation is still in progress.. Most notable among his work was the newly arranged edition of Novum Testamentum Graece (Greek New Testament) in 1979 (also called Nestle-Aland). This textual foundation for the New Testament exemplifies a scholarly mentality aimed at achieving the highest possible convergence with the \\"original text.\\" Furthermore, he acted in the Hermann- Kunst-Stiftung, which was founded in 1964 by Hermann Kunst, a good friend of Aland. Many important figures within politics and economics participated in the sponsorship of the Institute for New Testament Textual Research. Another priority in his life was church history, being concerned with the early church, the Reformation, and movements such as pietism and revivalism. Aland received critical acclaim for his profundity and comprehensive knowledge of the textual sources for the New Testament. His contemporary presence is relevant, having contributed to modern scientific methodology. Aland was of the opinion that every work within historical research stands on its adherence to reliability and accessibility.

It is one of the largest malls in the state of Georgia, and it is the largest mall in the Augusta metropolitan area. Augusta Mall has five anchors: Dillard's, J. C. Penney, Macy's, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Barnes & Noble. Augusta Mall is situated in the Forest Hill neighborhood in West Augusta, one of the more affluent areas of the city. Within a 10-mile radius of the mall, over 60% of people have a higher education and are white-collar workers. The median household income is $67,997. History Augusta Mall opened on August 3, 1978, one week after the now-defunct Regency Mall opened. Augusta Mall had about 90 retail spaces when it first opened, anchored by two department stores: Rich's and Davison's. Many of the mall's design features were borrowed from other successful malls developed by The Rouse Company. The space frame ceiling is a replica of The Mall in Columbia, Governor's Square Mall, Tampa Bay Center and Hulen Mall while the center fountain and elevator was taken from Beachwood Place, which opened the same month as Augusta. Since its opening, the mall has undergone 5 major expansions and several smaller renovations. The first of these began in 1987, when the mall added a 132,000-square-foot expansion for a new location of J C. Penney. In 1990, the mall underwent its second expansion, when Sears joined as the fourth anchor, in a 157,000-square-foot store. The $32 million renovation project also updated the interior of the mall and expanded the number of retail spaces from about 100 to more than 130. In October 1992, Vice President of the United States Dan Quayle held a rally at the mall during the final stretch of the campaign before the 1992 United States presidential election. Over 5,000 supporters showed up, well above expectation for 1,000 attendants. By 1998, when the third expansion was announced, Augusta Mall had become the region’s prime shopping area. J. B. White closed its store at Regency Mall and relocated to Augusta Mall to become its fifth anchor store, now Dillard's. Traffic congestion became a problem on Wrightsboro Road and Interstate 520 - the main freeway connecting the mall. The city funded a $231,000 project for expanded lanes as well as road improvements and new exit ramps to the mall. In 2002, Regency Mall was officially closed to the public, and boarded up. Also in 2002, the Augusta Mall infrastructure was upgraded, including: storm drain maintenance, a new parking lot, and other interior work. Macy’s closed during this time, and its lower level was converted into a furniture store. Former Davison's and Macy's was partly destroyed to make way for the Promenade as well as Dick's Sporting Goods and Macy's. In 2006, a fourth expansion, “The Augusta Promenade”, a lifestyle center addition to the mall was announced. Construction of the development started in the summer of 2006, with the grand opening on November 8, 2007. In 2007, a man drove his car into the mall. In January 2013, Abercrombie & Fitch closed its location at the mall. In July 2014, a thief stole $2,000 worth of panties from the Victoria's Secret store at the mall. In January 2016, Vans, Torrid, and rue21 announced plans to open locations at the mall. In January 2017, Buca di Beppo, which had opened in February 2012, closed its location at the mall. In April 2017, several men robbed the Apple Inc. store at the mall. In April 2018, Williams Sonoma closed its location at the mall. Also that month, the mall began to be powered by a 435-kilowatt rooftop solar panel system. In September 2018, QC Nails Salon announced plans to open a 4,500 square foot location at the mall. On February 8, 2020, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 39 stores nationwide. The store closed in April 2020. On October 3, 2020, after an altercation, a gun was pulled out and two people were shot. One victim was transported to a nearby hospital where he later died from his wounds. The other victim was shot in the leg and she is expected to make a full recovery.

Roustam Raza (1783 – 7 December 1845), also known as Roustan or Rustam, was Napoleon's mamluk bodyguard and secondary valet. Early life Roustam was born in Tiflis, Kingdom of Kartli (present-day Tbilisi, Georgia), to Armenian parents. At thirteen Roustam was kidnapped and sold as a slave in Cairo. The Turks gave him the name Idzhahia. The Sheikh of Cairo presented him to General Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798, during the French invasion of Egypt. In the service of Napoleon Roustam served Napoleon for fifteen years, travelling with the First Consul and subsequent Emperor on all of his campaigns. The mamluk's role was that of a personal attendant, taking care of Napoleon's weapons and clothing, and supervising the serving of his meals. Acting as a bodyguard he slept near to the emperor. On ceremonial occasions, such as the coronation of 1804, Roustom would be in attendance dressed in full \\"oriental\\" costume. Later life In 1814 Roustan married Mademoiselle Douville in Dourdan and refused to follow the Emperor in his exile to Elba after the first Bourbon Restoration.Roustam, mameluck de Napoléon.

Raza later claimed that he feared Napoleon would commit suicide and that he would be blamed for his death. He cited this as the reason he left Napoleon during the marshals' revolt, just prior to the emperor's abdication. Raza's position as second valet was filled during the Hundred Days restoration by his former assistant and the Imperial Librarian, Louis Étienne Saint-Denis; whom Napoleon took to calling Ali. Like Raza, Saint-Denis also wrote an auto- biography about his time in Napoleon's Service.

He pitched a no-hitter in 1915 and was the first pitcher to record a victory at Wrigley Field, then named Weeghman Park. In 1921, he was accused of tipping off a gambler to a possibly fixed game in 1920; an allegation that, while not proven, likely ended his career in baseball. Biography Hendrix was born born in Olathe, Kansas. His father was a banker who had also served as the Johnson County sheriff. In 1908, he attended and played baseball for Fairmount College, the predecessor to Wichita State University. After college, he played for Lincoln in the Western League. In 1909, he played for the Salina Trade Winners of the Central Kansas League. He had a good season in 1910 with an independent minor league team in Cheyenne, Wyoming with a record of 17 wins and four losses with 208 strikeouts. The season earned him a contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates for 1911. His second season in Pittsburgh was a breakout year where Hendrix, a spitballer, went 24-9 with a 2.59 earned run average. As a 23-year old player, he was second in strikeouts, behind only Grover Cleveland Alexander and received a few votes for Most Valuable Player. In 1913, his win-loss record was only 14-15, but he had a good ERA of 2.84 with 138 strikeouts. In 1914, Hendrix sought an increase in his salary to $7,500 per season. After manager Fred Clarke offered him a contract with a lesser increase, Hendrix failed to provide Pittsburgh with an answer and owner Barney Dreyfuss rescinded the contract and offered him one with no increase instead. He instead sighed with the Chicago Whales of the new Federal League. On April 23, 1914, Hendrix pitched in the first game at Wrigley Field, now Wrigley Field and became the first pitcher to record a win in the stadium with a five-hitter against the Kansas City Packers. That season, he went 29-10 for Chicago, leading the league in wins, ERA and complete games. On May 15, 1915, Hendrix pitched a no- hitter against the Pittsburgh Rebels, allowing only three batters to reach base on walks. However, his 1915 campaign was more pedestrial with only 16 victories and a 3.00 ERA. Still, the Chi-Feds captured the Federal League pennant in 1915. In 1916, Hendrix signed a contract with the Chicago Cubs in the wake of the Federal League's collapse. Hendrix started the first game for the Cubs at Wrigley Field, which Chicago won 7-6 in 11 innings. His first two seasons in Chicago, he posted ERA of 2.68 and 2.60 but had an record of 18-28 as the Cubs struggled. In 1918, the team and Hendrix had a resurgence. Hendrix went 20-7 with a 2.78 ERA and the Cubs won the National League Pennant. Hendrix helped clinch the league title on August 24 winning the first game of a doubleheader against the Brooklyn Robins. Hendrix did not start in the 1918 World Series against the Boston Red Sox, the first to feature Babe Ruth. The left-handed Ruth was notoriously tough on right-handed pitchers and the Cubs started only Hippo Vaughn and Lefty Tyler to try and hold Ruth in check. In his only appearance of the series, he singled off Ruth and then was replaced by Bill McCabe aftger reaching second. After the season, Hendrix went to work at a shipyard in Superior, Wisconsin. The Secretary of War Newton D. Baker issued a \\"work-or-fight\\" order that required baseball players to work in essential industries during World War I for face the draft. Baker allowed the baseball season to continue until September, after which, players like Hendrix had to begin working toward the war effort. Toward the end of the 1920 season, Hendrix, who had a record of 9-12 with a 3.58 ERA, was scheduled to start on August 31 against the Philadelphia Phillies, who were in last place. The Cubs were informed that money had been bet heavily against the Cubs in that game. The Cubs replaced Hendrix with Grover Cleveland Alexander who lost 3-0. With a grand jury investigating the Black Sox scandal in the 1919 World Series, the media paid great attention to rumors of potential game fixing. The Kansas City Times reported that $10,000 had been wagered on Philadelphia in the game. Immediately after the grand jury indicted the Black Sox, The New York Times reported that American League president Ban Johnson had obtained evidence against Hendrix regarding the Philadelphia game. A Kansas City sportswriter, Otto Floto, learned of a telegram sent to a local gambler named H.A. \\"Frock\\" Thompson (which was misprinted as \\"Frog\\" by The New York Times) saying \\"Bet $5,000 on opposition\\" and claimed to recall that Hendrix had sent the telegram. Hendrix did not testify before the grand jury, but told reporters that he had never met Thompson and Thompson stated that he did not know Hendrix. On February 7, 1921, Hendrix received his release from the Cubs. The next day, Hendrix told reporters that he would no longer pitch in the majors, but would continue his career in semi-pro baseball back in the Midwest. Cubs owner Bill Veeck stated that Hendrix's release had nothing to do with the allegations but was moving away from older veterans. Later articles did indicate that Hendrix was forced out. Hendrix himself said that he had already planned to leave the Cubs after the 1920 season as he had a good job as a car salesman. later, Hendrix and his father purchased the Liberty Theater in Kansas City. He continued to work in Kansas City until 1923 when his wife Mabel died. The following year, he moved to Pennsylvania, playing baseball in Emmaus.

Specifically, Route M-1 was split from Route 28 (now Route 5 near Mondawmin), Route M-2 was split from Route 7, and Route M-3 was split from Route 5. Station layout Mondawmin Shuttle MTA Line 21 Bus outside of Mondawmin station MTA Route 97, also known as the Mondawmin Shuttle Bug or Mondawmin Shuttle, was the second and is so far the final in the series of shuttle bugs to be introduced in the 2000s. The route serves Baltimore City Community College, Coppin State College, and various nearby streets, some served by regular bus routes, and some not. But the full route is within a close walk of one or more other MTA bus routes. The route operates at 20-minute intervals. In 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, it was initially proposed that the shuttle's frequency would be reduced to one bus an hour, and riders were encouraged to use other regular bus routes that shared common routing. However, after community meetings, it was ultimately decided that the schedule would remain the same. In 2006, MTA proposed that the route would be modified to serve Reservoir Hill in order to replace a portion of Route 5 that was at the time proposed for modification away from this area. But it was later decided that Route 5 would continue to serve Reservoir Hill. 2015 Baltimore Protests In April 2015, demonstrators protesting the death of Freddie Gray sparked riots around Mondawmin.

To 1800 Before the English settled the area that became Brookfield, Connecticut, it was inhabited by the Wyantenuck and Paugusset Native Americans, members of the Algonquin Federation. According to early deeds for property on both sides of the Still River, \\"Sachem Pokono\\" the son of Sachem Waramaug who met the first settlers to Brookfield in 1710 (or \\"Pocono\\") led the local Indians for many years. Indian relics are still found in Brookfield. \\"Newbury to Brookfield\\" Web page at Brookfield Historical Society Web site, accessed April 6, 2007 At one time, the \\"Indian Tree\\", a wild cherry tree on Route 133 was said to be the spot where local Indians would meet. Area names that come from the local Indians include Lake Waramaug (for a chief or \\" Sachem\\" in Algonquin ). Lillinonah was the name of his daughter. Pocono Road was named for Chief Pocono.\\"A Children's Guide to Brookfield History\\", Web page at Brookfield Historical Society Web site, accessed April 6, 2007 In the 18th century the community was called \\"Newbury,\\" a name that came from the three towns from which its land was taken – New Milford, Newtown, and Danbury. \\"Brookfield, Connecticut History\\" Web page on the Town of Brookfield Web site, accessed July 23, 2006 Because it was difficult for community residents to get to one of the distant churches in those towns in winter, in 1752 the General Assembly gave the community the right to have worship in area homes from September through March. In 1754, the General Assembly granted permission for the Parish of Newbury to build its own meeting house and get its own minister. On September 28, 1757, the first Congregational Church building was dedicated. The Reverend Thomas Brooks was ordained as the first settled minister. In 1787, when the town was incorporated, it changed its name to Brookfield in honor of Brooks, who was still the minister. Along the Still River mills were in operation as early as 1732 in an area that became known as the Iron Works District. Brookfield was a thriving town with iron furnaces, grist mills, sawmills, comb shops, carding and cotton mills, a paper mill, a knife factory, hat factories, stage-coach shops, lime kilns, harness shops and other plants operated there. The grist mill (now the Brookfield Craft Center) still stands. The Iron Works Aqueduct Company, formed in 1837 to supply water from mountain springs to the Iron Works District, still supplies water as the Brookfield Water Company. Nineteenth and twentieth centuries Town resident Susan Sherman wrote a diary in 1850–1851 now available online at a Web site of the University of Pennsylvania. The diary mentions frequent trips to Hartford, Danbury, and New Haven; embroidering and quilting; her own engagement and a description of her wedding. One section has recipes (mostly desserts). Before 1912 the town had two train stations: one in the Iron Works District, near the present Brookfield Market and, second, Junction Station, near the corner of Junction Road and Stony Hill Road. Young people used the train to attend high school in Danbury. The first Town Hall (first called the \\"Town House\\" was built in 1794 across from the meetinghouse (Congregational Church). Town business was conducted there until a new Town Hall was built in 1876 at a cost of $4,000. In 1975 the Town Hall was again moved to new quarters and the Brookfield Museum and Historical Society leased the structure. Danbury & Bethel Gas and Electric Company brought electricity to Brookfield in 1915. After Candlewood Lake was created, parts of the town of New Fairfield were left on the Brookfield side of the lake. So in 1961 Candlewood Shores, Hickory Hills, Candlewood Orchards, Arrowhead Point and the land that became Brookfield Town Park all became a part of Brookfield. In 1955, the 14-mile- long Lake Lillinonah was created when the Shepaug Dam was built. The .475 Wildey Magnum gun, later made famous in the 1985 Charles Bronson movie Death Wish 3, was developed by Wildey J. Moore in Brookfield in the early 1970s (the factory has since moved to Warren, Connecticut). In the early 1970s, the town was home to LEGO USA headquarters. By the late 20th century, New Yorkers began relocating from the city to the suburbs. This created rapid real estate development in Brookfield, and turned Brookfield into a popular commuter town for those who work in New York City. In 1991 most buildings in Brookfield Center's Historic District were named to the National Register of Historic Places. Brookfield schools The original Center School building was erected in 1762 and later served as the Town Hall. (Now it is rented by the Housatonic Valley Council of Elected Officials.) In 1788 the town of Brookfield was incorporated and by 1807 had eight school districts; Brookfield Center, Iron Works, Longmeadow, Whisconier, Obtuse, Bound Swamp, North Mountain, and South Mountain (Huckleberry Hill). In the 19th century, the town also had a private school for boys, as well as an internationally acclaimed music school. When Mary Northrop died on June 29, 1794, she left her entire estate to the town on condition it be used for public education with interest on the estate to be paid out each year to support education. Her will, dated April 13, 1793, stated: \\"I give and bequeath unto the Town of Brookfield all my monies, Notes, or Bonds or Book Debts or Lands or Chattels or any interest that shall be found belonging to me after my decease, for use of a school, to be kept in the center of town [...] the interest of the money to be paid yearly for the support of the school after a reasonable time to settle the estate in.\\" She apparently could not read herself and signed the will with an \\"X\\", her mark. The town received 138 pounds, 11 shillings and nine pence from the estate in 1794. Northrop was called \\"Molly\\", and the fund became known by 1804 as the \\"Molly Fund\\", a name that has stuck to this day. Since Northrop's will stated the money should be used in the center of town, the fund was used to pay the singing master in the town's Sing School, which was located there. The Long Meadow Hill School was built in 1959 and later became Brookfield High School, which graduated its first class in 1967.

Its gameplay puts it on the same family as Sir Tommy, Strategy, and Calculation. Colours is so called because of its emphasis on colour. The game is a variation of the solitaire game Lady Betty. Rules The cards are shuffled, then dealt out one by one the foundations or onto one of six waste piles, the top cards of which are available for building only on the foundations. A two, a three, a four, and a five are needed to start the foundations. The deuce and the four should be of one colour (regardless of suit) and the trey and the five be of the other colour. Naturally, the colour of the first foundation card that turns up during dealing dictates the colours of the other cards. The foundations are built up by colour. Dealing of cards from the stock continues until the stock runs out. The game is won when all of the cards are built onto the foundations, which should have an ace, a deuce, a trey, and a four on top.  Variations  Lady Betty is more like Sir Tommy in that it requires you to build the foundations by suit rather than colour, but like Colours it gives two extra tableau piles to work with.

Allmusic gave it four stars and said \\"Phiiliip combines soft synths, disaffected breathy vocals, and folky acoustic guitars for a dazzling, yet minimal effect.\\"[] Momus was also responsible for redubbing Philip as Phiiliip, so as to ensure his googlability, and spearheaded a U.S. tour, of which Phiiliip's \\"highly postured and totally electronic act was reminiscent of a cross between retro Factory and Morrissey.\\" He became a regular performer on the New York electroclash circuit, playing at clubs like Luxx, Don Hill's, Joe's Pub, the Knitting Factory and the Andy Warhol Museum. In 2002 he began compiling and mixing the CDs for annual arts magazine K48, which also featured his collaborations with nightlife celebrity Sophia Lamar. The same year saw Yesandno, his side-project with Captain Comatose's Snax, release their 12 inch Notahit on International DeeJay Gigolo Records, in addition to his collaboration with PFFR which appeared alongside Snoop Dogg on their album United We Doth. He later appeared on TRL for their MTV show Wonder Showzen. 2003 saw him performing for Dior Homme, and photographs of him by designer Hedi Slimane appeared on the cover of Butt Magazine. In 2004 he had an art show with Deitch Projects and John Connelly Presents consisting of work from fifty artists \\"inspired by/responding to/commenting on/or utilizing the meat\\" of the CD he was then working on. Artists included Ryan McGinley, Terence Koh, AA Bronson, Dash Snow, Slava Mogutin and Assume Vivid Astro Focus. The show, \\"a decidedly off-kilter fun fair,\\" according to Artforum, was chosen as one of the year's best in the New York Times. His CD Divided By Lightning, released in conjunction with the art show, featured collaborations with Soft Pink Truth, Excepter, Avenue D and Tigra of L'Trimm. The companion DVD, Multiplied By Thunder, featured a \\"pulsating geometric\\" video made by Bec Stupak for his reimagining of T. Rex's \\"Elemental Childe,\\" and a version of his song \\"For The Second\\" sung by Boy George. 2005 saw remixes of Yukari Fresh and Grizzly Bear, in addition to \\"Pirateradiophiiliip,\\" a DJ mix CD consisting of \\"mashups\\" he'd made which fusing hiphop, R&B; and pop with the underground electronic and club music of the time. 2007 also saw the belated release of \\"Totally Magic,\\" his EP with now-defunct ex-roommates and electroclash boundary-stretchers Avenue D. Later in 2007 the last Phiiliip album, \\"Magically Bad\\" was released for free (as all Philip Something's subsequent music would be) on his website. \\"Homefreeze,\\" the single, also appeared on the prison-themed #6 issue of K48, the last to feature Phiiliip handling the mixing of the companion CD. The other single \\"Open Sun\\" also became a flower-entranced video by Grant Worth, the NY-based visual magician who also made the video for \\"Summer Collection\\" which became the cover of Divided By Lightning. In 2008 Phiiliip notice a disturbance in the reigning culture succinctly embodied by the media's viciously invasive treatment of Britney Spears, and so he began deconstructing her crumbling image in the brutally harsh manner utilized by the toxic paparazzi culture, using as its source material all hyper-microscopic samples found on YouTube. Searching for \\"methamphetamine\\" led to the unrepentant stimulant anthem \\"Addicted To Ooh,\\" and after several months of sourcing he'd genetically databased the darker skeleton of culture and began elucidating its hidden errors through intensive electronic manipulation of randomly encountered details. It resulted in an album, Dignity, The Joke, which he released as Total BS on Vices website in conjunction with an interview in the magazine about the symptoms of schizophrenia he was experiencing at the time concomitantly with Britney and her breakdown. In 2009 he recorded a double CD, Easily Scared (as Total PX) to serve as the soundtrack for Harmony Korine's art show \\"Pigxote.\\" He also did an archive-raiding ultimix of Sweet Thunder for a split 7 inch with Gavin Russom and performed at their reunion in Brooklyn with Omega Jarden. 2010 saw Phiiliip recording folk cover albums as Jenkins (a tactless uncensored Phiiliip parody character off-the-books credited to Hunter Parrish). \\"Acoustic Tomb,\\" \\"Castle of Pi,\\" \\"Artery Clocka,\\" \\"Zac Efron's Vegetable Gravy\\" and \\"Hexed In Heliotrope\\" were posted on Facebook and then disappeared (along with the personality, which was fairly antagonistic) on a dead laptop. 2012 saw Phiiliip return, this time as Wirekid. Like \\"Dignity, The Joke,\\" consisting solely of source material found on YouTube, Wirekid's music began combining fiction, non-fiction, documentary, biography, criticism, secret history, gossip, poetry and jokes. Focusing on alternate realities experienced in dreams with fantasy versions of pop and movie stars, primarily centered around the Disney empire and the emerging teen pop echelon. Releasing his new music as a series of albums, singles and DJ mixes on SoundCloud and Bandcamp, he attempted to incorporate the celebrities he kept encountering at night and attempting to come to grips with and normalize by day online. The primary subject of his new composition/productions was Zac Efron, who was documented in \\"Here's To Your Health\\" from \\"The Sixth Floor,' the \\"Paragons Of Capitalism/Dying To Layla\\" single, \\"zAC eFRON hOUSE pARTY\\" album, and the presently unreleasable rock opera \\"Pistolwhipped By A Pigeon.\\" Likewise praised actor James Franco provided the source material for \\"You Are Mistaken\\" an album detailing an alternate existence of unimaginable horrors (and implied eventual triumph) involving the CIA, mind control, experimental drug injection, ritualistic sadism and the infinite extremes of sexual abuse perpetrated against specially targeted individuals. While strictly theoretical and based on Philip fleshing out ideas related in Facebook instant messaging sessions, \\"Y.A.M.\\" closely parallels account given by survivors of Project Monarch as found on the Internet. The conceptual extremes of this speculative reality were confronted via lyrical battling/deriding with the first Wirekid single \\"[THE PAIN OF LIFE.],\\" followed by the much lighter \\"I DONT CARE\\" which returned to directly addressing James Franco, who was also the recipient of several free fan-art- projection-aspiring DJ mixes in his honor, including \\"Pattern Disruptor\\" (as Fed Zeppelin) and \\"You Don't Understand The Flow,\\" which would later be sourced for \\"iLLuuMiiNatI a$$\\" (a collection of remixes for the rap and pop stars who populated Philip's dreams, and whose singles sometimes drew connections to the aforementioned speculatory existence). The most widely reworked artist Wirekid tackled was/is Justin Bieber, from whose catalog Wirekid reenvisioned \\"Lolly,\\" \\"U Smile,\\" \\"Die In Your Arms,\\" \\"Baby,\\" \\"Boyfriend,\\" \\"All That Matters,\\" \\"Hold Tight,\\" \\"PYD,\\" \\"What's Hatnin'\\" \\"Swap It Out,\\" \\"Roller Coaster,\\" \\"All Bad,\\" \\"Memphis,\\" Heartbreaker,\\" \\"Recovery,\\" \\"She Don't Like The Lights,\\" \\"Backpack,\\" \\"Memphis,\\" and the unverifieds \\"Together Forever\\" and \\"Future.\\" Others he remixed notably included others.

Dahui was a student of Yuanwu Keqin (Wade–Giles: Yuan-wu K'o-ch'in; Japanese: Engo Kokugon) (1063–1135) and was the 12th generation of the Linji school of Chan Buddhism. He was the dominant figure of the Linji school during the Song dynasty. Dahui introduced the practice of kan huatou, or \\"inspecting the critical phrase,\\" of a kōan story. This method was called the \\"Chan of gongan (kōan) introspection\\" (Kanhua Chan).Yu, p. 211 Dahui was a vigorous critic of what he called the \\"heretical Chan of silent illumination\\" (mozhao xie Chan) of the Caodong school (Wade–Giles: Ts'ao-tung; Japanese: Sōtō). Biography =Early years= Dahui was born in Xuancheng, Anhui, to the Xi family. He left home at sixteen and became a Buddhist monk at seventeen. His initiatory name was Zong Gao. Following the tradition of the day, he wandered from Chan community to community, seeking instruction. He studied under a Caodong master and mastered the essentials of the Five Ranks in two years. He studied all the records of the Five Houses of Chan, being particularly drawn to the words of Yunmen Wenyan (Wade–Giles: Yün-men Wên-yen Japanese: Ummon Bun’en), 864-949, founder of one of the \\"Five Houses\\" of Chan. He sought out instruction on the sayings of the old masters collected and commented on by Xuedou Chongxian (Wade–Giles: Hsüeh-tou Ch’ung-hsien; Japanese: Setchō Jūken) which became the basis for the koan collection, the Blue Cliff Record. =Tangzhou= Dissatisfied with intellectual study, at the age of twenty-one he went to Treasure Peak, near the modern city of Nanchang in Jiangxi Province, to study with Zhan Tangzhun (Wade–Giles: Chan-t'ang Wen-chun), a master of the Huang-lung branch of the Linji School. Although Dahui developed a great intellectual understanding of Chan, enlightenment eluded him. Recognizing his potential and great intellectual abilities, Zhan Tangzhun made Dahui his personal attendant. One day Tangzhou asked Dahui, :\\"Why are your nostrils boundless today?\\" :Dahui replied, \\"(Because) I’m at your place.\\" :Tangzhou retorted, \\"You phony Chan man.\\" Cleary, p. xi Another time, when Dahui was twenty-six, Tangzhou called him over and said, =Yuanwu= Dahui continued his studies with Yuanwu Keqin. On his way to Tianning Wanshou, a monastery in the old imperial city of Bian (modern Kaifeng), Dahui vowed to work with Yuanwu for nine years and if he did not achieve enlightenment, or, if Yuanwu turned out to be a false teacher, giving approval too easily, Dahui would give up and turn to writing scriptures or treatises. Yuanwu gave Dahui Yunmen’s saying, \\"East Mountain walks on the water\\" as a koan to work through. Dahui threw himself into the koan and struggled with it day and night, giving forty-nine answers to the koan, but all were rejected by his teacher. Finally, on May 13, 1125, he broke through. Later, he recalled the event: As it turned out, Yuanwu did not give approval too easily. He said, Yuanwu gave Dahui the koan, \\"To be and not to be --- it is like a wisteria leaning on a tree\\" to work on and after six months, Dahui achieved the final breakthrough and was recognized by Yuanwu as a Dharma-heir in the Linji tradition. =Teaching career= Yuanwu assigned teaching duties to Dahui and Dahui’s fame spread far and wide. A high ranking government official, the Minister of the Right, Lu Shun, gave Dahui a purple robe and the honorific, \\"Fori\\", the Sun of the Dharma. The following year, 1126, the Jürchen Jin dynasty captured the Emperors Huizong and Qinzong; the capital was moved to the south and the Southern Song era began. Dahui also moved south and taught both monks and laymen. It was at this time that he began his severe criticism of the \\"heretical Chan of silent illumination\\" of the Caodong school which he would continue for the rest of his life. He became a great favorite of the educated and literate classes as well as Chan monks and in 1137, at the age of forty- nine, Chancellor Zhang Jun (), a student of Dahui, appointed him abbot of Jingshan monastery in the new capital Lin-an (modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang). Within a few years his sangha grew to two thousand and among his lay followers were many high-ranking officials. Dahui became the acknowledged leader of Buddhism of the Southern Song dynasty.Yu, p. 216 =Exile and return= right However, disaster was about to befall him. Because of his association with a high official who fell out of favor with the prime minister, all Dahui’s imperial honors and his ordination certificate were stripped from him and he was sent in exile to Hengzhou (Hunan) in the year 1141. At the age of sixty- two he was transferred to present day Guangdong, a place notorious in those days for plagues and hostile elements. Some fifty of Dahui’s monks died there in a plague.Ferguson, p. 441 Throughout these difficult years, Dahui continued teaching in the Linji tradition of Chan Buddhism, attracting both gentry and commoners. Finally, in 1155, Dahui was pardoned and was allowed to return to his former monastery at Jingshan where he continued his teaching until he died five years later on . He wrote a final verse for his disciples, saying, \\"Without a verse, I couldn’t die.\\" ::Birth is thus ::Death is thus ::Verse or no verse ::What’s the fuss?Cleary, p. xvii Emperor Xiaozong of Song bestowed upon him the posthumous title \\"Chan Master of Great Wisdom,\\" from which the name Dahui derives. Teachings The enlightenment experience as the answer to the riddle of life and death, and the great doubt necessary to have the determination to break through, became central to Dahui’s teaching. =Kanhua chan= Dahui’s letters to lay people reveal a compassionate teacher, who believed that the enlightenment promised by the Buddha was available to all people, regardless of their daily activities. The best way to achieve this was through the use of gong-ans as a daily meditation device. Gong-ans Gong-ans developed during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) from the recorded sayings collections of Chán-masters, which quoted many stories of \\"a famous past Chán figure's encounter with disciples or other interlocutors and then offering his own comment on it\\". Those stories and the accompanying comments were used to educate students, and broaden their insight into the Buddhist teachings. Those stories came to be known as gongan, \\"public cases\\". Such a story was only considered a gongan when it was commented upon by another Chán-master. This practice of commenting on the words and deeds of past masters confirmed the master's position as awakened master in a lineage of awakened masters of the past. Dahui saw this practice of commenting on gongans in his time as becoming a superficial literary study. In a radical move to counter this literary emphasis, he even ordered the suppression of his own teacher’s masterly collection of koans, The Blue Cliff Record (Wade–Giles: Pi Yen Lu; Pinyin: Bìyán Lù; Japanese: Hekiganroku), burning all copies and the wooden blocks to print them, effectively taking the venerated text out of circulation for the next two centuries.Foster & Shoemaker, p. 186 Hua tou practice Dahui introduced the use of k'an-hua, the concentration on the hua tou (\\"word head\\") of a gong-an to attain insight. Until his time, the developing gongan- tradition consisted mainly of commenting on \\"old cases\\", adding comments and poetry. This use of written comments and poetry shows the influence of Chinese literati culture, to which both state officials and most Buddhist higher clergy belonged. Although there were hundreds of koans available, Dahui used only a few, believing that deep penetration of one or two koans would be enough to attain enlightenment. To achieve this, one had to work assiduously and with great determination, like someone whose \\"head is on fire\\".Yu, p. 226 It mattered little to Dahui whether a person was particularly intelligent or not – liberation was available to all. He wrote: Dahui often used the famous mu-koan, \\"A monk asked Zhàozhōu, ‘Does a dog have Buddha-nature?’ Zhàozhōu replied, ‘No’ (Chinese: Wu; Japanese: Mu) (which later became the 18th koan in the collection The Book of Equanimity published 61 years after his death in 1224 and then appearing again as the first koan in The Gateless Gate published 4 years later in 1228). Dahui taught that Doubt The concept of ‘doubt’ was very important in Dahui’s teaching. He warned his students that they must ‘doubt’ words to not be fooled by them. Furthermore, they needed to ‘doubt’ their very existence. He said, Influence on the Rinzai-tradition His teachings on kanhua practice became the standard for the Linji school tradition of koan practice in China, Korea and Japan. Dahui extorted a strong influence on the Japanese Rinzai teacher Hakuin Ekaku, who also taught great doubt as necessary to awaken. =Rejection of silent illumination= Dahui’s teachings contain relentless attacks on the practice of silent illumination, sitting in meditation in tranquility and quietness. He labeled teachers of this type of meditation practice as \\"heretical\\" and complained, To his opinion this type of practice leads to drowsiness, blankness and intellectualization and conceptualization of Chan Buddhism rather than enlightenment. He thought that teachers who taught this method of meditation had \\"never awakened themselves, they don’t believe anyone has awakened.\\"Cleary, p. 111 For Dahui, koans were the only way to enlightenment and without koans, one would \\"be like a blind man without a walking stick: unable to take even one step.\\" But koans had to be penetrated fully, not intellectualized. It was this fear of superficiality and intellectualization of old koans that led him to destroy all copies of his own teacher’s masterpiece, the Blue Cliff Record, to save Chan and to authenticate proper koan practice. Writings Only one work can be attributed to Dahui, a collection of koans entitled Zhengfa Yanzang 正法眼藏Xuzangjing Vol. 67, No. 1309 , Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association (The Storehouse of the True Dharma Eye, J. Shobogenzo) Dahui also compiled the Chánlín Bǎo Xùn (禪林寶訓, \\"Treasured Teachings of the Chan Monastic Tradition\\"), instructions of former Chan abbots about the virtues and ideals of monastic life, in collaboration with another monk, Dagui. A disciple of Dahui, Zuyong, compiled a collection of Dahui’s life and teaching called Dahui Bujue Chanshi Nianbu (\\"Chronological Biography of Chan Master Dahui\\"). The Zhiyue lu, compiled by Qu Ruji, also contains information on Dahui’s teachings and is the basis of the J. C.

State - 78.8% Special education In December 2010, the district administration reported that 488 pupils or 15% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department. The Laurel Highland School District works closely with neighboring school districts and Intermediate Unit # 1 to place students who cannot be served within the district. The small number of students who needs cannot be accommodated in the public school setting can receive services in an approved private school such as New Directions, Communities in Schools- Success Academy within the Laurel Highlands School District or other licensed facilities at school district expense. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district’s students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student’s needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students in order to increase state funding has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. The School District received a $2,135,294 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 89 or 2.47% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student’s building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget In 2009, the district reported employing 225 teachers, with a salary range of $33,000 to $103,200. The median teacher salary was $55,280. In 2007, the district employed 210 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $53,015for 180 days and 6 inservice days worked. They were the second highest paid teachers in the county. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries. When adjusted for cost of living Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation.PA Delaware County Times, Teachers need to know enough is enough, April 20, 2010. Additionally, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance (district pays the full cost of the BS/BC plan), dental insurance, professional development reimbursement, 2 paid personal days, 5 paid bereavement days, 10 paid sick days, and many other benefits.The district offers an Early retirement incentive that includes health insurance coverage. Laurel Highlands School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $623 per pupil. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. The Pennsylvania School Boards Association keeps statistics on salaries of public school district employees in Pennsylvania. According to the association's report, the average salary for a superintendent, for the 2007-08 school year, was $122,165. Superintendents and administrators receive a benefit package commensurate with that offered to the district's teachers' union. Reserves In 2008, the district reported zero in an unreserved-designated fund balance. The unreserved-undesignated fund balance was reported as $3,525,406. In 2008, the district administration reported that per pupil spending was $11,261 which ranked 370th among Pennsylvania's 501 school districts. In 2010 the per pupil spending had increased to $11,955.62 In October 2011, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. The findings were reported to the school board and administration. Among the serious issues noted was a failure to write and retain Board Meeting official minutes in violation of Pennsylvania Public School Code. Board members approved minutes, without having a copy of the minutes to read first. The district is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the individual's wealth. =State basic education funding= In the 2009-2010 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 4.23% increase in basic education funding for a total of $13,620,698. Among the districts in Fayette County, the highest increase went to Laurel Highlands School District. The state basic education funding to the district in 2008-09 was $13,067,933.08. Ninety school districts received a 2% increase. Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received a 22.31% increase in state basic education funding in 2009. The amount of increase each school district receives is set by the Governor and the Secretary of Education as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. For the 2010-11 budget year, Laurel Highlands School District received the highest increase, in Fayette County, a 6.29% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $13,620,698. 150 Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in 2010-11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. In 2011-12, the district received a $13,091,281 allocation, of state basic education funding. \\\\- Additionally, the Laurel Highlands School District received $239,090 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state education budget included $5,354,629,000 for the 2011-2012 basic education funding appropriation. This amount was a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted state appropriation for 2010-2011. The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12. In 2010, the district reported that 1,891 students received free or reduced-price lunches, due to the family meeting the federal poverty level.Pennsylvania Department of Education, District Allocations Report 2009, 2009-10 Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania’s school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, the district applied for and received $648,950 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district uses the funding to provide full-day kindergarten. \\\\- Federal Stimulus grant The district received an extra $1,450,000 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding is for the 2009–10 and 2010-2011 school years.School stimulus money, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, March 12, 2009. Race to the Top grant District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided over one million dollars in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. \\\\- \\\\- Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. The Laurel Highlands School District did not apply to participate in 2006-07. In 2007-08 the district received $370,652. The district received $67,581 in 2008-09, for a total funding of $438,233. =Common Cents state initiative= The School Board elected to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2011-12 were set by the school board at 14.2109 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. *2010-11 - 13.9323 mills *2009-10 - 13.3965 mills. *2008-09 - 13.3965 mills. *2007-08 - 13.0000 mills. Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. The following exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school’s share of payments to PSERS taking into account on the PSERS contribution rate. \\\\- The School District Adjusted Index for the Laurel Highlands School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. *2006-07 - 5.4%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 4.7%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 6.1%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 5.8%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 4.0%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 2.0%, Base 1.4% *2012-13 - 2.4%, Base 1.7% For the 2011-12 school year, the Laurel Highlands School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district’s index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. The Laurel Highlands School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2011. For 2009-10 school budget, the board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Index. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2010, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the School District was $152 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 6.700 property owners applied for the tax relief. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Fayette County, 71% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. In Fayette County, the highest amount of tax relief in 2010, went to property owners in Uniontown Area School District which received $198. The highest property tax relief in Pennsylvania went to the residents of Chester Upland School District of Delaware County who received $632 per approved homestead.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Tax Relief per Homestead 2009 Report, May 1, 2010 This was the third year they were the top recipient. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently, individual with income much more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). Extracurricular activities The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.

Early life Born at Heswall on the Wirral (then in Cheshire) Bromley was educated at Cheltenham College and Sandhurst. He served as a lieutenant in the 14th/20th King's Hussars, where he won the Bisley Cup for rifle shooting and came close to qualifying for Britain's modern pentathlon team for the 1952 Summer Olympics. He subsequently became the assistant to the British racehorse trainer Frank Pullen, and rode occasionally as an amateur jockey until he fractured his skull when a horse he was riding collided with a lorry. Rise as a commentator In 1955 he became one of the first racecourse commentators in Britain (his first commentary was at Plumpton on 23 March that year - delivering the immortal line ' Atom Bomb has fallen!', after earlier test commentaries at the now-defunct Hurst Park and at Sandown Park), and in four years he commentated at every course apart from Cartmel. He had also begun to commentate on television, initially (briefly) for ITV, but from 1958 for the BBC. On 13 May 1959, at Newmarket, he gave his first radio commentary. From 1 December 1959, he became the BBC's first racing correspondent, the first time the Corporation had appointed a specialist correspondent on any sport. This was a full-time job: no commercial involvements or advertisements were permitted, and even opening fetes was frowned upon. He would remain in this position until the summer of 2001, calling home the winners of 202 Classics, with the exception of the 1969 St Leger when he was on holiday - BBC colleague Julian Wilson covered for him - and the 1997 St Leger when Lee McKenzie stood in for him when he hurt his knee and could not climb up the stairs to the commentary box in Doncaster. By 1960, criticism from the racing fraternity of Raymond Glendenning's commentaries - he showed little interest in the sport and required the assistance of a race reader - was intensifying, and the rise of television was making the field of commentary more specialised. Bromley was advised by Peter Dimmock not to go to radio because Peter O'Sullevan could not go on forever (O'Sullevan was only 42 at the time) and he would be the next in line, but after commentating for radio on a number of races in 1960, Bromley became BBC Radio's main racing commentator from the beginning of 1961 (Glendenning's last racing commentary was on the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park on 26 December 1960, although he would continue to commentate on football, racing and tennis until the early part of 1964). Bromley would, however, continue to commentate for BBC Television on occasions until around 1970. Broadcasting For forty years from 1961 to 2001, Peter Bromley gave the radio commentary on virtually every major race in the United Kingdom, plus the Irish Derby and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on many occasions, and races in the United States, Hong Kong and South Africa, where he stayed for some time in late 1974 and early 1975. He covered 42 Grand Nationals, 202 Classics, and over 10,000 races in all. His commentaries were heard on the Light Programme, Network Three, Third Network, Radio 2, Radio 5 and Five Live, and his voice became instantly associated with racing among listeners all over the world as his commentaries also went out on the BBC World Service. His stentorian, almost military tones - which could turn almost instantly from calm Received Pronunciation to a roar of grand excitement - captured the drama and potency of horse racing, and his tireless championing of the sport within the BBC led to a dramatic expansion in the number of races covered - from only 50 a year in the early 1960s to over 250 by the 1980s, although in his later years that number would decline again. He was also responsible for the launch of a daily racing bulletin in 1964, which was cancelled in June 2007 when the bulletin was broadcast on Five Live. The more memorable the race, the more memorable his commentary seemed to be: Shergar's Derby in 1981 was heralded with the words \\"It's Shergar ... and you'll need a telescope to see the rest!\\", encapsulating how far ahead of his field the horse was. The epic Grand National of 1973 was another example: \\"Red Rum wins it, Crisp second and the rest don't matter - we'll never see a race like this in a hundred years!\\". An emotional piece of Bromley's commentary was his call in 1981 of Bob Champion winning the Grand National on Aldaniti. Bromley, who never seemed to betray his partial deafness, was a conscientious professional, working hard to prepare for each commentary, often presenting winning trainers and owners with his charts, featuring the colours of each horse in a race, as souvenirs. In his later years, he was especially angered when his broadcast of the Derby began as the runners were going in the stalls (French Open tennis had interfered), and when he was told through his earphones, near the end of a race at Royal Ascot on 16 June 1998, to finish immediately after the race because Five Live needed to go over to the United States for the result of the Louise Woodward trial. Later years and retirement In his later years Bromley seemed to work less, giving much of his previous work over to commentator Lee McKenzie and reporter Cornelius Lysaght. He had intended to retire when he turned 70 in 1999, but continued until the age of 72 mainly because the BBC wanted him to commentate on 200 Classics, a record which is unlikely to be broken. He finally retired after Galileo's Epsom Derby victory on 9 June 2001, 40 years after his first Derby commentary on Psidium's shock 66-1 win. Bromley's main pastimes were training gundogs and shooting game. He had hoped to continue these when he moved from Berkshire to Suffolk on his retirement, but he began to suffer from pancreatic cancer less than a year after his final broadcast, and fell victim to the cancer 15 months later. He was survived by his second wife (his first wife had been killed in a car crash in 1959) and his three daughters.

The title Butterfly was not given by Chopin (as is true for all Chopin pieces with such titles); however Arthur Friedheim said, \\"while some titles were superfluous, this one is inadequate.\\"Arthur Friedheim's description of the pieces in his edition of the works (Schirmer) Analysis The composition is a study of staccato – marcato alternations, marked throughout the piece. The piece is marked Allegro assai and is written in meter. It is the shortest of Chopin's études; it lasts under a minute played at the indicated tempo. The melody is created by playing a detached octave, then two non-detached octaves. This makes a four-note group, the structure of which is used during the whole piece to convey the melody. This structure of rapid octaves can pose a challenge to the less technically experienced. Another difficulty is in the constant switching of solid octaves to detached octaves. It is much more straightforward to simply play one or the other for the whole piece.Musical Analysis at Our Chopin  References   External links  * Analysis of Chopin Études * * , Valentina Lisitsa * 25 09 Category:1834 compositions Category:Compositions in G-flat major ","title":"Étude Op. 25, No. 9 (Chopin)"},{"id":"10509444","text":"Aladdin and His Magic Lamp () is a 1970 French animated film directed by Jean Image.

It is a pairing game, and was first described in the French book Nouveau Recueil de Patiences, which was printed in Paris in 1885 by the publishing company Watilliaux.  Rules The cross in this game is an eight-rayed cross, composed of an inner circle and an outer circle, each having eight cards. The object of this game is discard all cards in pairs. A pair in this game refers to two cards having the same rank. In the first stage, only the top card of the waste pile and of the cards in the inner circle can make a pair. Once a card leaves the inner circle, it is immediately replaced only by the corresponding card from the outer circle. Cards in the outer circle are not replaced. After the stock runs out, the second stage begins, wherein the cards from the waste pile are used to fill empty spaces in the inner circle (not all however). The rule in which the top card of the waste pile should only be paired up with a card from the inner circle still applies. The third stage begins once all the cards from the waste pile are either discarded or end up in the inner circle. At this stage, cards at the inner circle can now be paired with each other.

The sole surviving copy of the Songs of Dzitbalché was written in alphabetic Mayan in the 18th century. The author identifies himself as Ah Bam, an elder of the town of Dzitbalché. He appears to say that the book was originally written in 1440. Manuscripts of this era were often copies of copies of copies, so scholars have to look at internal evidence for clues to the original date of composition. Many of the poems appear to be much older than the manuscript, and contain ancient ceremonial and ritual material. Other poems are songs of love, philosophy, and spirituality.

He played college football at North Carolina A&T; State University. Early years Smith attended Sterling High School, where he practiced football, basketball and baseball. He accepted a football scholarship from North Carolina A&T; State University. He was named the starter at fullback as a sophomore, leading the team with 73 carries for 396 yards (5.4 avg.) and 8 touchdowns in 10 games. He led the team again as a senior, appearing in 8 games with 89 carries for 482 yards (5.3 avg.) and 4 touchdowns. In 1971, he was inducted as an inaugural member into the North Carolina A&T; Sports Hall of Fame. Professional career =Chicago Bears= Smith was selected by the Chicago Bears in the fifteenth round (179th overall) of the 1955 NFL Draft. He spend the year out of football serving his military service in the Korean War. He returned in 1956, but the team had a surplus of running backs (Rick Casares, Bobby Watkins, John Hoffman, J.C. Caroline and Perry Jeter), so he was moved to the defensive side. He was used as a kick off returner, linebacker and safety, before being waived after the sixth game of the season. =San Francisco 49ers= In 1956, he was claimed off waivers by the San Francisco 49ers and played the remaining 5 games of the season as a reserve defensive back. The next year, he played at left cornerback, registering 2 interceptions and finishing third in the league with a 26.3-yard average in kickoff returns. In 1958, while he served as a kickoff returner, he was eased into the running back position until the eleventh game of the season when he ran for 113 yards on seven carries, including and 80-yard touchdown.

Background Bluegrass Hootenanny was the second duet album by Jones and Montgomery, the first being the bluegrass-tinged What's In Our Heart. As the title implies, this second Jones/Montgomery collection brings this sound into focus, a departure of sorts for Jones, who was known primarily for his hardcore honky tonk sound and soulful ballad singing. The album features several bluegrass interpretations of classic country songs written by Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt, and Hank Williams. Jones co-wrote two songs with Johnny Mathis, the rollicking \\"Jump In The Mississippi\\" and the plaintive \\"I'd Dreamed My Baby Came Home\\", while \\"Will There Ever Be Another\\" and \\"I'll Be There To Welcome You Home\\" were co-written by Montgomery. The album was a hit, reaching number 12 on the country album chart, although not quite as successful as What's In Our Heart had been, which had risen to number three. Jones and Montgomery would tour together, with Jones confessing in his autobiography I Lived To Tell It All, \\"My affections for Melba surfaced almost immediately after we began working. But my drunkenness and the fact that I had a wife did little to make her want to commit to me.\\" Jones also divulged that he had asked her to marry him but Montgomery had begun a relationship with Jones' guitar player Jack Solomon, whom she would eventually marry.

The story is told from the perspective of a middle-aged special agent named Giraut. The Armies of Memory explores the intermingling of artificial and human intelligence as an alien threat is on the horizon. Plot summary Several attempts are made on Giraut's life as he works on his new Ix cycle of music. He is sent back to Wilson, his home planet and culture of Occitan, to complete the new music along with his Office of Special Projects team as protection. Paxa retires from the OSP and leaves Giraut after finding out she cannot be successfully backed up on a psypyx, which would make her death permanent. Giraut begins to fall in love with a fellow musician Azalais who introduces him to Ebles, a contact for rogue colonies outside of Council space which call themselves the Union. Soon after, Azalais is killed and Giraut is severely injured in another assassination attempt. After Giraut is healed he is contacted again by Union. Margaret sends him, along with Raimbaut and Laprada, to the rogue Union colony of Noucatharia to get to the bottom of several coincidences, including the whereabouts of a possible psypyx of Shan, and to find out who keeps trying to kill him. Once there Giraut begins to fall in love with Rielis, a talented musician and singer, as he tries to uncover what Union wants from him and the Council. It is revealed to Giraut and his team that everyone on Noucatharia is either an aintellect in human form or a chimera human/aintellect, both of which are forbidden horrors in Council space. They are also told there are multiple aintellect conspiracies unknown to the OSP, and that Noucatharia was the site of the first invasion by an unknown Alien army, in which humans were beheaded and aintellects/robots fought as best they could. After another amateurish assassination attempt he is kidnapped, separated from his team, and implanted with Shan's psypyx. As Rielis questions Shan, Giraut and Rielis rapidly come to know what happened on Addams to cause it to lose contact with Earth. An aggressive alien aintellect-run invasion overwhelmed their defenses and killed everyone not in hiding—their goal being to destructively holograph brains, deconstruct aintellects and send back those memories and experiences to their home planet to be consumed as entertainment for their dependent organic creators who had isolated themselves in virtual reality. Only by advanced planning by Shan's father and help from his personal aintellect was a very young Shan able to escape via springer to Earth. The OSP invades Noucatharia with help from Raimbaut just as Giraut/Shan and Rielis are beginning to agree on the cooperation that is needed between the Council and the Union to face the alien threat. Giraut/Shan are held prisoner by Margaret until the OSP can sort out friend from foe, but Paxa comes through a springer to free Giraut. He quickly recognizes that Paxa is joined to Azalais as a chimera in exchange for being able to be psypyxed in the future, and to help the progressive and dynamic Union face an alien threat. Giraut/Shan and Paxa/Azalais mount a rescue mission and free the aintellect humans and chimeras from OSP control and get Raimbaut to join them. Raimbaut and Giraut/Shan then choose to stay behind in an attempt to rescue or destroy a Rielis psypyx from an OSP building before it can be tortured for its knowledge and secrets. They destroy the psypyx and Margaret captures them before they can make it to a springer. Raimbaut is quickly cleared of charges and Shan is eventually implanted in Margaret's brain—but Giraut is found guilty of assisting the aintellect conspiracies in escaping from Noucatharia. His trial is a rallying cry for human supremacists, but over time and as the facts come out they are increasingly marginalized by society who see Giraut as a martyr. The only thing left is for him to be executed to permit his public beheading to serve as a unifying story for future generations, as contact is made with the aintellect-run Union colonies.

It has rough, fibrous and fissured bark on most of the trunk and smooth light brown to grey bark often shed in long ribbons on the branches. The adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, the flower buds in groups of three and the fruit a conical or bell-shaped capsule.budsfruit Description Eucalyptus chapmaniana is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. The bark on most of the trunk is rough, fibrous and finely and grey or brown-grey and on the branches is smooth, light brown to pale grey, with long ribbons of shed bark. Young plants and copice regrowth have sessile egg-shaped to almost round leaves long and wide arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of three in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are club-shaped to diamond-shaped, long and wide with a conical to beaked operculum. Flowering occurs from January to March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, conical or bell-shaped capsule long and wide. Taxonomy Eucalyptus chapmaniana was first formally described in 1947 by Alexander Kenneth Cameron from a specimen near Bogong and the description was published in The Victorian Naturalist. The specific epithet (chapmanii) honours Wilfrid Chapman (1891–1955), after he had drawn attention to the existence of this species.Ronald McNicoll, 'Chapman, Wilfrid Dinsey (1891 - 1955)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 13, Melbourne University Press, 1993, pp 404-405. Distribution and habitat Bogong gum grows in wet forest and grassy or shrubby woodland, often on steep slopes, in cold mountains areas of Victoria and far southeastern New South Wales. In Victoria it occurs along the highest parts of the Great Dividing Range between Jamieson and Benambra and is also found on Mount Buffalo and Pine Mountain. In New South Wales it is only found south of Khancoban.

He retired from his teaching position in 2011. Early life Born in New York City to a secular Jewish family, Raskin was raised in Huntington, Long Island. His parents were Communists in the 1930s and 1940s, but as his father became a successful attorney in the 1950s, they concealed their radical politics and were careful to blend into their middle-class community. Hiding, dissembling, and disguising would become persistent themes in Raskin's writing, along with the personas of the exile and the fugitive. Raskin gave every appearance of being the all-American teenager; he was co-captain of his high school football team, and named to Newsday's All-Suffolk Football Squad in 1958. He also worked as a sports reporter for The Long Islander in his last year of high school.Jonah Raskin, Out of the Whale, (New York: Links, 1974), pp. 11-37. Raskin attended Columbia College, studying literature with Lionel Trilling, receiving a B.A. degree in 1963, and an M.A. in American Literature in 1964. He taught at Winston-Salem State College in the summer of 1964, then married and moved to England in the fall to study British and American literature at the University of Manchester. He received his Ph.D. in 1967 with a dissertation on the mythology of imperialism in the work of Rudyard Kipling and Joseph Conrad, and obtained his first full-time teaching position in the English Department at the State University of New York at Stony Brook from 1967 to 1972.Out of the Whale, pp. 80-91. Raskin turned his Ph.D. thesis into a book entitled The Mythology of Imperialism, which Random House published in 1971. The New York Times called it \\"Maoist\\" literary criticism. Edward Said, the author of Orientalism and Culture and Imperialism, wrote in 1984 that it was \\"one of the genuinely important handful of books on modern literature published in the last two decades\\", and that \\"Raskin's quite unique feat was to have connected the genuine aesthetic power of the novelists to the political power of the culture abroad.\\" The Mythology of Imperialism has since been republished in a new edition by Monthly Review Press, with a new introduction and conclusion by Raskin and a foreword by Columbia literature professor Bruce Robbins.http://www.monthlyreview.org/books/mythologyofimperialism.php Into the Seventies Identifying with the growing social movements of the late 1960s, Raskin joined the building occupation led by Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) at Columbia University in 1968. His wife, Eleanor Raskin, became involved with the Weatherman faction of SDS,Ron Jacobs, The Way the Wind Blew: A History of the Weather Underground (London: Verso, 1997), p. 207. and he followed with some ambivalence. He was arrested and beaten by New York police in December 1969 after smashing windows in a street demonstration organized by Weatherman.Thomas P. Ronan, \\"2 Arrested at Anti-Nixon Protests Say They Were Beaten by Police\\", The New York Times, December 14, 1969. Failing to get tenure at Stony Brook because of his militant activity, Raskin abandoned his academic career for the life of a radical free-lance journalist. He joined Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and Paul Krassner in the Youth International Party (the Yippies) in 1967, and was designated its Minister of Education in 1970. He traveled to Algiers with Jennifer Dohrn (sister of Weather Underground leader Bernardine Dohrn) as part of a Yippie delegation in October 1970 to meet with Eldridge Cleaver and Timothy Leary, whom the Weather Underground had helped escape from a low-security prison in California. Their plan, to link the anti-war movement in the United States with global protests, came to naught when Cleaver attempted to arrest Leary, and Leary and his wife fled to Switzerland.Out of the Whale, pp. 161-179. Raskin later interviewed Leary for High Times magazine shortly before Leary's death in 1996. In 1974, Raskin received a grant from the Rabinowitz Foundation in N.Y. for research on the Cold War and American culture in the literature of the period from 1945 to 1960, reading and interviewing that would inform his later book on Allen Ginsberg and the Beat Generation, American Scream. Raskin helped Abbie Hoffman go underground in 1974, and traveled with him when he was a fugitive for much of the 1970s, coming into contact once again with the Weather Underground, a subject he addressed in an autobiographical novel, Underground.Jonah Raskin, Underground, (Bobbs-Merrill, 1978). His wife Eleanor had become a fugitive, and he made an unsuccessful effort to preserve their floundering marriage by making contact with her. In 1974 Raskin compiled and wrote an introduction to a collection of Weather Underground communiqués, The Weather Eye, and set up an imprint, Union Square Press, to publish the work. His introduction was academic in tone, and gave no hint that he'd had a hand in drafting the statement, \\"New Morning, Changing Weather\\", that adopted a more moderate tone and began the process of Weather leaders resurfacing from the underground.Jonah Raskin,\\"Looking Backward: Reflections on Language, Gesture and Mythology in the Weather Underground\\", in Sing a Battle Song: The Revolutionary Poetry, Statements, and Communiques of the Weather Underground, 1970-1974, ed. by Bernardine Dohrn, Bill Ayers, and Jeff Jones (New York: Seven Stories Press, 2006), pp. 121-129. During this period Raskin lived on fees and advances from articles and books, writing for a variety of publications including Monthly Review, the San Francisco Review of Books, The International Herald Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and the Village Voice, and for various alternative newspapers and magazines, including Liberation News Service, The Seed, University Review, Liberation, The San Francisco Bay Guardian, L.A. Weekly, and the northern California Bohemian. He covered the trial of the Panther 21 in New York in 1970, and wrote about such fugitives and prisoners as Dennis Banks of the American Indian Movement and Oscar Collazo, the Puerto Rican nationalist. He traveled to Mexico in 1975 in search of the elusive writer B. Traven, a journey that became the subject of My Search for B. Traven.Jonah Raskin, My Search for B. Traven (New York: Methuen, 1980); Richard Elman, \\"Mysterious Treasure\\", The Nation, November 1, 1980, pp. 450-451; Shepherd Bliss, \\"Who was B. Traven?\\" Guardian, September 17, 1980, p. 21. Raskin settled in Sonoma County, California, in the winter of 1976, where he had come to visit his parents, who had retired to the rural community of Occidental. Gradually detaching himself from New York and the radical left, Raskin began to meet such California writers as Tillie Olsen and Jessica Mitford, and pitched ideas for movies to Hollywood producers. He created the characters and the story about marijuana cultivation in northern California for the movie Homegrown, eventually produced in 1996, directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal; Raskin appears in a crowd scene at the end of the film.Tina Barni, \\"Sonoma State Professor Cultivates ‘Homegrown’ for Big Screen\\", San Francisco Chronicle, June 19, 1998, p. NB 3. Return to the university in the 1980s Raskin returned to academics as a lecturer in the English Department at Sonoma State University from 1981 to 1987, and became chair of the Communication Studies Department from 1988 to date (2007). He has taught media law, the history of communications, film noir, and writing for newspapers, magazines, radio, the movies and memoirs. He was a Fulbright Professor at the University of Ghent and University of Antwerp, Belgium, in 1986-1987, teaching 19th and 20th century American literature and culture. During the 1980s and 1990s, Raskin wrote scores of book reviews for the Santa Rosa Press Democrat, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Los Angeles Times, and a variety of other publications. His signature format coupled his reviews with separate in-depth interviews that often evoked wide-ranging conversations with the authors, including writers from Doris Lessing and Kurt Vonnegut to Alice Walker and Greg Sarris. Raskin's biography of Abbie Hoffman, For the Hell of It, captures the genius and the flaws of the Yippie spokesman and his place in the tumultuous sixties, follows him as he flees underground to avoid prison on drug charges, and is straightforward in acknowledging the bipolar disorder that led to Hoffman's suicide in 1989.Jonah Raskin, For the Hell of It (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1996), pp. 234-258; Vivian Gornick, \\"Wildman\\", The Nation, January 6, 1997, pp. 25-27; Jonathan Rieder, \\"The Groucho Marxist\\", The New York Times Book Review, February 2, 1997, p. 13; Sarah Peyton, \\"Free Radical\\", The Sonoma County Independent, February 13–19, 1997, pp. 17-18. In American Scream, Raskin studies Allen Ginsberg's development as a poet in the context of \\"Howl\\", the most influential poem of his generation. Raskin traces Ginsberg's studies with Lionel Trilling, his relationship with his father (a schoolteacher and poet), and his Beat Generation colleagues. Raskin explores the consequences of Ginsberg's mother's mental illness on the theme of societal insanity in \\"Howl\\", and relates the court case that set a new direction for artistic freedom at the end of the repressive 1950s.Jonah Raskin, American Scream (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 2004), pp. 44-64; Vivian Gornick, \\"Wild at Heart\\", The Nation, June 14, 2004, pp. 34-36. Raskin has subjected his radicalism of the 1960s and 1970s to a searching and thoughtful analysis, and he now views his affiliation with the Weather Underground and his endorsement of its politics as largely self- dramatization that wasted the energy and resources of the above-ground enablers as well as the underground fugitives. A final moment of political disillusionment with the radical left and dreams of Third World socialism came with a visit to Hanoi in 1995, where he experienced Vietnam as a country run by a Communist elite rapidly enriching themselves from a freewheeling capitalist economy.Jonah Raskin, \\"Vietnam Now: Land of Sadness & Survival\\", Sonoma Mandala, Vol. 22 (Fall 1994/ Spring 1995). Raskin's distance from his former comrades is apparent in his new introduction to the collection of Weather Underground communiqués republished, along with his original introduction, in Sing a Battle Song. Raskin allowed his introduction to be edited for the collection, but he published an expanded version in a left journal. To anyone who wants to go underground and commit acts of violence in America today, Raskin advises, \\"Don’t do it. Be visible. Talk openly. Go out and meet people. Organize. Educate. Avoid violence. Democracy is in the streets, on the Internet, and wherever people meet.\\"Jonah Raskin, \\"Looking Backward: Reflections on Language, Gesture and Mythology in the Weather Underground\\", Socialism and Democracy, Vol. 20, No. 2, (July 2006), pp. 121-135; and Sing A Battle Song, p. 129. Current work In the 1990s, Raskin began writing poetry and publishing it in chapbooks. His poems are unpredictable – alternately satiric, droll, and tender. He often performs his poems with musicians. Continuing his work on northern California authors, Raskin edited a book of Jack London's political writing, The Radical Jack London, adding a significant interpretive essay. His latest books are Field Days: A Year of Farming, Eating and Drinking Wine in California (2009); Marijuanaland: Dispatches from an American War (2011), and A Terrible Beauty: The Wilderness of American Literature (2014). He began reviewing with New York Journal of Books in 2015. Publications by Jonah Raskin Books *The Mythology of Imperialism: Rudyard Kipling, Joseph Conrad, E. M. Forster, D. H.

They likely traveled up to Olompali, where his father had built an adobe brick home. Camilo was a notable leader of the Coast Miwok, a Native American people. Camilo was known as the last Hoipu (headman) of the Miwok community living at Olompali and the Coast Miwoks of the Southern Marin Band.Seif, 2006. Camilo was also the only Native American on the northern frontier of Alta California to secure and keep a large Mexican-era land grant: In 1843 Governor Manuel Micheltorena of Alta California deeded him the Rancho Olompali, a large tract of land that is between present-day Novato and Petaluma, California. A part of this land now comprises the Olompali State Historic Park.Mason, 1971:112.  Parents and Childhood  Camilo was born to Aurelio (Inutia) and Aurelia (Mineru) about 1803 and baptized under the Spanish name Camilo on 9 Jan. 1819 in the chapel at the Mission San Rafael Arcángel, according to his baptismal record. His surname was the Spanish transliteration of his father's original native name. Aurelio Inutia was Hoipu (headman) of the Caminpuxcui rancheria according to mission records.Early California Population Project Database: Baptism ID SRA:00161 Aurelio Inutia was a chief of the Huimen tribe. This Coast Miwok tribe inhabited much of today's Marin County, California. In 1775 the Presidio of San Francisco sent an exploring party into the north bay country and Camilo's father, chief at Olompali, made them welcome. Camilo's father also built the very first adobe home north of the San Francisco Bay at Olompali. The name \\"Olompali\\" comes from the Coast Miwok language and likely means \\"southern village\\" or \\"southern people.\\" (It was also spelled \\"Olompolli\\" or \\"Olompoli\\"). Historians think that the natives that built the house had learned how to make adobe bricks at the Mission San Francisco. Camilo inherited this original home and built another adobe nearby for himself. His birthplace was in \\"a sheltered valley, with an abundance of game\\", adjacent to the salt water Bay, with abundant mollusks and fish.Mason 1971:112-113. Adult life In 1835, the Mexican government sent General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo into the Marin and Sonoma Counties, in order to bring military control in the region from the presidio in Sonoma, California. According to the book Historica de California Vallejo's first day arriving north of the Bay in June 1835 is probably his first meeting with Camilo Ynitia and the people of Olompali: General Vallejo recounts sailing into the North Bay, and first stopping in San Rafael, to form an alliance with a Coast Miwok tribe there, before moving towards Sonoma County to gather all tribes and arrange as many alliances as possible among all tribes.Lynch 1997. In 1836, Camillo and Vallejo signed a peace treaty, aligning the Olompali people with the Mexican- Americans. In 1843, because of this treaty with Vallejo and the Mexican- Americans, Camilo was one of the two Native Americans to be deeded a large grant from the Mexican-American Government. (The other native to receive a land grant was Vallejo's close friend, the Suisunes Chief Solano.) With Vallejo's aid, Camilo petitioned the Mexican Governor for land for his people and received the Rancho Olompali grant, which included Olompali and his birthplace home. This land grant was confirmed by the American government after control of California was transferred to the United States. The land grant was recorded in California state records, as follows: Camilo built his own home partly with the bricks his father had used earlier. The adobe home as adapted by Camilo had walls thick, and ceilings high. He owned 600 cattle, and was a notable breeder who owned numerous horses and sheep. He raised wheat and some think sold it to the Russians at Fort Ross. =Battle of Olompali= At the time of the Californian revolution known as the Bear Flag Revolt, on 24 June 1846 the Battle of Olompali occurred when a violent skirmish broke out at Camilo's adobe between a troop of American Bear Flaggers from Sonoma and a Mexican force of 50 from Monterey, under the command of Joaquín de la Torre. Several men were wounded and one man was reportedly killed, the only fatality associated with the brief California revolution. =Final years= Camilo eventually had to sell most of Rancho Olompali to James Black on 13 August 1852 for $5,200, but retained called Apalacocha. He died in 1856, either abruptly or of a short illness.Mason 1971:114-115. =Family= Maxima Antonia Ynita, circa 1865 Camilo married four times. He married his first wife Elena 22 October 1822; she died in April 1830. He next married Candida on 22 May 1831; she died 13 March 1835. He then married Cayetana on 13 July 1835. By Cayetana he had a son, Juan Pablo, and two daughters, Maxina Antonia and Maria Antonia. Juan Pablo was born in 1839; he died in a boating accident on 28 May 1851 along with the father of the man who would marry Maria Antonia. Maxima Antonia (known as Mary Maxima later in life) was born 18 November 1841, and was baptized on 5 December 1841. Maria Antonia was born in August 1845, and was baptized on 31 October 1845. Her godfather was William A. Richardson, the namesake of Richardson Bay. Cayetana died 21 November 1850, and Camilo married his fourth wife, Susanna Maria on 5 January 1852. Camilo also adopted another girl, who married John Pingston, a \\"free man of color\\". They had a son, Juan Jose Pingston. Camilo conveyed approximately in the extreme southwest corner of Apalacocha to John on 14 February 1853. Camilo's daughter Maxima Antonia was married first to Henry Holden Bennett, an American, on 12 June 1854, likely with Camilo's encouragement. Then after Bennett's death in 1856, Maxima married Henry Harper Willard. Henry and Maxima had 13 children. After Henry's death in 1888, Maxima married Armstrong McCabe on 31 July 1891. Maria Antonia married Joseph Knox and had two children. After Camilo's death, Maxima and Maria purchased a part of Rancho Sanel in the Sanel Valley of Mendocino County, and moved there with their husbands and helped found the town of Sanel, later named Hopland. On 26 November 1860, \\"Being in want of money for a Maintenance,\\" Maxima and Maria sold Apalacocha, to John Knight, their Mendocino attorney, for $3,693. With that transaction, the last of aboriginal Olompali passed into American ownership. Recognition and legends The chief and his adobe house are legendary today. In 1915, Camilo's adobe house was owned by James and Josephine Burdell and they built a 26-room mansion around it. They used to take people on tours and show the home.Mason 1971:109. Much of the original Rancho Olompali, along with the ruins of the original Camilo Ynitia adobe, is now protected within the Olompali State Historic Park. William Heath, a contemporary, said that Camilo was \\"fine, intelligent and shrewd.\\" Stephen Richardson called him \\"clean-cut, capable, and all around.\\"Mason 1971:113. It is said that Camilo buried all his gold from his sale to James Black on a mountainside, because when he died he had very little money on record. One theory is his last wife or family knew where the gold was and unburied it later to assist them in purchasing cattle and part of Rancho Sanel in Mendocino County. To this day scattered here and there, there are still those who can claim to be a direct descendant of Camilo Ynitia.

Both games are so-called because they were created during the time of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887. One of the games has an ornate layout, while the other is simpler and it belongs to the family of games which include Sir Tommy, Strategy, and Calculation. Jubilee 1 This game's instructions come from Card Games Made Easy by Arnold Marks and Jacqueline Harrod and is included in the computer solitaire package Solsuite. First the eight kings are separated and placed in a row. These form the foundations. The rest of the cards are then shuffled. The aim of the game is to build each of the eight foundations in suit in this order: K-A-J-2-10-3-9-4-8-5-7-6-Q. The rest of the cards, after being shuffled, are dealt one card at a time, onto the foundations or on one of four waste piles. The top card of each waste pile is available only for play on the foundations. When all of the cards have been dealt, the waste piles are gathered up, starting the fourth pile, and without shuffling, the cards are dealt again. This can be done twice. The game ends after the cards have been redealt the second time. The game is won when all of the cards are built onto the foundations, with the queens on top. Like many of the games in the same family, it is always a good idea to set aside one of the waste piles for the queens, since they would be the last card on each foundation. Jubilee 2 This one has an ornate ending layout of a large heart surrounding one Queen of Hearts to represent Queen Victoria. Lady Adelaide Cadogan is said to have invented this game as a patriotic gesture. One of the two Queens of Hearts is placed on the center of the layout. Then, the rest of the decks are shuffled and six cards are played on the tableau. All hearts should be placed around \\"Queen Victoria\\" (the first Queen of Hearts) with nines and tens of hearts forming a cross around the queen, while all others form a heart. The six other aces are placed at the sides of the heart; they form the secondary foundations, built up in suit up to tens, then queens. Jacks are discarded while Kings are placed on a column. When the other Queen of Hearts appears, it is placed over the first one. In the tableau, cards are built downward regardless of suit. Spaces can be filled with any available card. Only one card can be moved at a time. But in every space in the tableau that becomes open, two cards in sequence can be moved at once. As Jacks are immediately discarded from the game, a ten can be placed on top of a queen. Cards from the stock are dealt one at a time on a waste pile, the top card of which is available for play on the tableau and on the foundations. There is no redeal. The game is won when the above ornate layout is formed (heart around the queen) and all other cards are placed in their appropriate positions.

Life account  She was born Kate Nichols in Brooklyn, New York to George Little Nichols and Christina Mary Cole. Her father was a partner in a large importing firm. She married Spencer Trask, a prominent Wall Street banker and financier, on November 12, 1874. Her husband was a director of several railroads and the president of the Edison Illuminating Company of New York. He also helped plan and finance the reorganization of the New York Times in 1896. Katrina was the mother of four children, all of whom died in infancy or childhood. Spencer was killed in a railroad accident in 1909. In 1913 Katrina suffered several heart attacks and spent much of the remainder of her life developing and financing Yaddo, an artists' community in Saratoga Springs, New York, where she was an invalid. On February 6, 1921, she married longtime family friend George Foster Peabody. Katrina died less than a year later in 1922, and is buried at Yaddo.  Career  In 1878 she wrote Colorado Leaves, and in 1888 the Chronicles of Yaddo. Her first book, Under King Constantine, was published anonymously in 1892. The book contains three long love poems and was written in three days under intense mental strain. She hid the poems away for years until finally persuaded by her husband to have them published. It went through five editions and beginning with the second edition she started identifying herself as Katrina Trask. She published Free Not Bound (1903), a novel, and Night & Morning (1907), a narrative in blank verse; both were about love and marriage. In 1908 she wrote King Alfred’s Jewel, a historical drama also in blank verse. As an avid pacifist she wrote an antiwar play, In the Vanguard which appeared a year before World War I and went through eight editions and was performed by women clubs and church groups.

His notable contribution to science includes the discovery of the carboxylase and the elucidation of alcoholic fermentation which he showed to be a process of successive enzymatic steps, an understanding that became crucial as to how metabolic pathways would be investigated by later researchers. Personal life Carl Sandel Neuberg was born on 29 July 1877 to a Jewish family in Hanover as the first child of Julius and Alma Neuberg. He was educated in the classical language gymnasium Lyceum I of the Ratsgymnasium until he was 15. In 1892 he moved with his parents to Berlin where he attended Friedrich-Werdersches Gymnasium. After graduating school in 1896, he studied astronomy, but soon switched to chemistry to comply with his father's wishes for him to become a master of brewery. He studied at the University of Würzburg and University of Berlin as well as Technischen Hochschule Charlottenburg. On 21 May 1907, Neuberg married Franziska Helene (Hela) Lewinski, with whom he had two daughters, Irene Stephanie in 1908 and Marianne in 1911. His wife died from leukemia on 24 March 1929 at the age of 45. Neuberg was forced out of his job in 1934 under pressure from the Nazis. Just before the outbreak of the Second World War, he left Germany to work for a while at the University of Amsterdam, then travelled to Palestine via France during the war, eventually leaving in 1940 to move to the United States to join his daughters who had already settled there. He died on 30 May 1956 in New York after a prolonged illness. Career in science Kaiser Wilhem at the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Experimental Therapy in Dahlem in 1913. Neuberg began his professional career working as an assistant in the physiological chemistry department of Charité in 1898 while he was still working on his doctoral thesis. He gained his PhD in 1900 working on the chemistry of glyceraldehyde under the supervision of Alfred Wohl at the University of Berlin. In 1903, Neuberg became a privatdozent, and in 1906 a professor at the University of Berlin. Neuberg was the first editor of the journal Biochemische Zeitschrift he founded in 1906 which is now known as the FEBS Journal.Introducing the FEBS Journal for 2005 Accessed 6 April 2007 In his early work in Germany, he worked on solubility and transport in cells, the chemistry of carbohydrates, photochemistry, as well as investigating and classifying different types of fermentation. He was also a pioneer in the study of the chemistry of amino acids and enzymes. In 1913, Neuberg was invited to head the biochemistry section of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Experimental Therapy, the director of which was August von Wasserman. Neuberg discovered in 1911 an enzyme \\"carboxylase\\" which catalyzed the decarboxylation of pyruvic acid. He also introduced methods for trapping of intermediate metabolites which allowed him to correctly interpret the steps and mechanisms of reactions, and formulate a theory for the alcoholic fermentation of glucose. Support for his theory was bolstered when he helped develop an industrial process that contributed materially to the German war effort in World War I, manufacturing glycerol--for the production of explosives--by the fermentation of sugar.Fruton, Joseph S. Proteins, Enzymes, Genes: The Interplay of Chemistry and Biology. Yale University Press: New Haven, 1999. pp. 44, 292-294 Neuberg made a particularly important discovery in 1916: hydrotropy, a solubilization process where the addition of large amounts of a second solute causes an increase in the aqueous solubility of a different solute. He also worked on catalase and the oxidation of fatty acids and amino acids, studied the structure of biochemicals, discovered other enzymes, and synthesized phosphorylated intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism. He is considered one of the founders and leaders of modern dynamic biochemistry. Due to his Jewish origin, Neuberg was forced by the Nazis to end his work at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biochemistry in 1936 and he left Germany in 1937. The successor for his position at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biochemistry was Adolf Butenandt. Neuberg moved to the United States in 1940, however due to his age, he was unable to find a paid academic position, and he worked as a consultant for industry. Nevertheless, he was associated with a number of universities, and continued to work on enzymes and cell transport processes. On 5 Nov 1947, he received a medal from the American Society of European Chemists and Pharmacists. He served as a professor at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute.

A learned mathematician and astronomer, Ignatius Nemet Aloho I is best known as one of the nine scholars who helped Pope Gregory XIII's commission on the reform of what would become the Gregorian Calendar. Biography Nemet Aloho was born in the city of Mardin and became a monk in 1535 at a young age at the Mor Hananyo Monastery where he studied Syriac literature and church sciences before becoming a priest. Whilst there he also studied history, logic, astronomy, geodesy, medicine and the art of drawing. In 1555, Nemet Aloho was ordained maphrian and was consecrated patriarch two years later, upon which he took the name Ignatius. In 1562 Nemet went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and ordained nineteen metropolitans and bishops as patriarch. Nemet's reign as patriarch was troubled by doubts within the church of his contacts with the Papacy that he had established as well as by accusations of atheism from Muslim clerics. In March 1576, at the instigation of the Ottoman governor of the province, Nemet was forced to make a Muslim profession of faith and resign as patriarch.Calendars of the Syriac Orthodox Church Nemet left the patriarchal seat to his brother David and fled to Venice via Cyprus or Rhodes, arriving in October 1577. From Venice, Nemet travelled to Rome where he was received by Pope Gregory XIII and became a Roman Catholic; Nemet also received a pension from the Pope. In 1579 Nemet joined the Pope's committee to reform the Julian Calendar which would come into force in Catholic countries in October 1582 as the Gregorian Calendar. He brought to the committee the works of various prominent Arab astrologists, including Omar Khayyám. In March 1583, Nemet's translator, Leonardo Abela left Rome for Syria to enter into talks with Nemet's brothers, Ignatius David II Shah and Thomas. However, after three days of negotiations, the talks were inconclusive and the brothers refused to adopt the Gregorian Calendar despite the fact that Nemet had participated in its creation. Works Nemet's works include a tract describing the kingdoms of Europe, particularly Italy, from 1580 and a treatise on the Gregorian calendar. He also wrote poetry in Syriac, however only fifty lines have survived.

According to their school of thought, the main function of language is communication, and it is this fact that guides the formulation of grammatical hypotheses and constrains the form these hypotheses can take. Columbia School linguistic analyses typically are based on observable data, such as corpora (texts or recorded speech), not on introspective ad hoc sentence examples. Rather than a single theory of language, the Columbia School is a set of orientations in which scholars analyze actual speech acts in an attempt to explain why they take the forms they do. This was the methodology of its founder, the late William Diver, who taught linguistics at Columbia University until his retirement in 1989.  Orientations  On the one hand, this methodology is more modest in its goals than most other schools. On the other hand, the results produced are more reliable, because they are based on objective data, rather than on mentalistic or philosophical entities. The assumption is that modest goals are more appropriate for a linguistic science still in its infancy, a science that hasn’t yet freed itself entirely from traditional philological parts of speech, self-standing sentence examples, and logico-philosophical entities such as subject and predicate. Conclusions about how the mind functions, based on the structure of language, should wait until a new, more reliable linguistics emerges, as did astronomy from its origins in astrology. A useful illustration of the differences between the Columbia School of Linguistics (CSL) and other linguistic approaches is the way each regards the field of mathematics. Rather than considering human language to be itself a kind of logic or mathematics, CSL uses mathematics as a tool to analyze and draw conclusions about languages. Instead of trying to produce rules to generate all possible “grammatical” sentences, CSL scholars count and compare numbers of occurrences of various phenomena and then apply statistical criteria to draw conclusions about the reasons for this usage. These conclusions, although not earth-shattering, are based on the CSL orientations of communication, physiology or psychology. CSL researchers typically search the gray areas for an explanation of why one form appears more often than another, and are not satisfied with a black-and-white mapping of the frontiers of grammaticality. Whereas most linguists talk of constraints and combinations of entities that are not permitted, CSL linguists discuss the choices that speakers of language have and how they make use of those choices. CSL’s basic unit of language is the morpheme, the smallest meaningful unit of language. This is the linguistic sign, the unit shared by all other subdisciplines of semiotics. By taking the sign as the basic unit—as opposed to the sentence—CSL linguists can reasonably compare either spoken or sign language to all other forms of communication through signs, from ideograms to musical notation to bee dancing. It is not a goal of CSL to search for entities of human language that distinguish it from other forms of animal communication. As with all posited entities, CSL will accept them after they have been shown to have a function.  Semantics  One radical approach of CSL is in its treatment of meaning. Rather than assuming that there exist semantic universals—much less that we know what they are—CSL assumes that every linguistic sign has a meaning different from all other signs in any language. Although meanings may be similar, they are never exactly the same. And until it can be objectively shown that a particular sign has multiple meanings, the assumption is that it has only one meaning (elsewhere known as a Gesamtbedeutung), capable of carrying diverse messages. This derives from Ferdinand de Saussure's structuralist perspective on language, whose perspective relies heavily on the dictum \\"one form - one meaning\\". For example, many linguists believe that the word with has several meanings, such as instrumental: “cut with a knife,” adversarial: “struggle with your enemies”, and even partitive: “split with the organization,” among others. However, CSL linguists observe that what varies among these uses is not the meaning of with but the message of the phrase, due to the accompanying verbs and nouns. Struggle undoubtedly contributes to the adversarial message, but so does the word enemies; “struggle with your comrades” would likely eliminate the adversarial relationship. The little word with contributes the same weak meaning (something like: “at some time accompanied by”) throughout. Not only do words in the same sentence affect the message conveyed by with, but the surrounding context and the non-linguistic circumstances do so as well. In “don’t struggle with him,” the sense is radically affected by the antecedent of him, whether him was identified in the previous sentence or whether the speaker is pointing to someone likely to be the listener’s comrade or enemy.  Syntax  Another distinguishing characteristic of the Columbia school is its approach to syntax. CSL does not attempt to create an algorithm that can generate all possible sentences, because there is no clear dividing line between “grammatical” and “ungrammatical” sentences. Many apparently ungrammatical sentences can find a useful application, given the proper context.  Phonology  CSL differs from other schools in the other major aspect of language, phonology, as well. Here again, CSL does not posit entities, such as binary features, unless they can be shown to have a function. There is nothing in information theory that requires every message to consist ultimately of a binary code. Any linguistic message can be represented by a binary code, just as our decimal number system can be represented binarily. Therefore, the bit can be used as convenient but arbitrary measure of information for speech or for numerical information. But nobody seriously proposes that people fundamentally use binary digits in counting, as some linguists do for speech. Unlike most other schools, CSL concentrates on articulation, rather than sound, as its object of study (but see also articulatory phonology). For example, CSL attributes the relative rarity in most languages of words beginning with /g/ to its relative difficulty of articulation, not to auditory causes. In the production of a (voiced) /g/, air must pass through the vocal cords while the back of the tongue stops up the vocal tract, blocking that air. Since the resulting chamber of air for /g/ is smaller than for /b/ or /d/, there is less time for air to build up, making it harder to produce a vocal vibration when starting to speak. Thus, through its physiological theoretical orientation, CSL gives an articulatory explanation of the low frequency of initial /g/ in human language. CSL does not neglect sound as the means through which spoken language is transmitted and whose perceptible differences serve to distinguish linguistic signs. However, it considers articulatory gestures, not binary acoustic features, to be the physical units of which any utterance is made up.  Summary  The Columbia School of Linguistics traces its origins through André Martinet and others back to Ferdinand de Saussure, the founder of modern linguistics. Like Saussure, CSL considers a language to be a kind of system “où tout se tient” (where everything depends on or influences everything else). But CSL differs from Saussure and his followers in its interest in substance as well as in form. Saussure emphatically denied the relevance of the physical media (vocal tract, sound) through which language functions, claiming that language consists of nothing but differences, which are phonetically achieved through the use of physical media. But CSL linguists make a practice of explaining the arrangement of various forms (/g/, red barn vs. barn red) through their related substances (air chambers, difference in meaning). CSL researchers set as their goal what other linguists postulate—but do not explain how—children do as they acquire their first language, that is, they analyze the undifferentiated mass of linguistic input actually produced by people. Rather than marveling at the infinitude of possible sentences that could be produced by an algorithm, CSL linguists wonder at the remarkable skill that humans have in employing a limited number of physical resources and meanings to produce a myriad of messages appropriate for a myriad of situations.

WHPL broadcasts at an effective radiated power of 2,000 watts directional with a tower located off U.S. Route 231 in rural south-central Tippecanoe county. Studio and offices are located at WGNR's studios in Anderson, Indiana. History WHPL signed on in early 1993 featuring religious and inspirational programming featuring Bible teachings and music. WHPL would become Lafayette's only FM religious station. Until this point, Lafayette listeners had to tune to the AM dial to get their inspirational fix from First Assembly of God's 1410 WCFY. WHPL would become the Lafayette area's only Christian radio station in 1998 when WCFY was sold to Artistic Media Partners and flipped to a secular news/talk format as WAZY. Originally, the station was housed in West Lafayette just south of the Purdue University campus, but later moved to a business district on Lafayette's east side where it remained until Moody decided to network WHPL and sister station WIWC (in Kokomo) to their 50,000 watt Anderson station serving the Indianapolis metro, WGNR-FM 97.9. Before WHPL was networked with WGNR, the station featured its own unique program schedule while occasionally simulcasting with WIWC, especially in the mornings. The rest of the day featured a blend of Bible teaching, talk, and inspirational music. In the late 1990s, the inspirational music was shelved in favor of Contemporary Christian music also known as CCM or Christian AC. The same format continues to this day only with a stronger emphasis on music.

Keen's Curry is available in 60g or 120g tins.Keen's Curry Information.  Keen's Mustard  Keen, Robinson, & Co. advertisement, London, 1894 Keen's Mustard has a history extending back to the 18th century. The first mustard factory in London was opened by Messrs Keen & Sons at Garlick Hill in 1742, and in the 1890s the chimes of the Royal Exchange, set to the well known song 'The Roast Beef of Old England', could be heard, during a lull in the traffic, at Keen's factory. Part of the factory was sealed off for manufacture of washing blue, because everything, including the workers, bore a shade of blue. Mustard tins too were made, and there was a penny tin packing room. Keen's Mustard History Keen's Mustard History. Thomas Keen was born in Camberwell, south London, in 1801, but the family subsequently moved to Croydon, Surrey, and ran the 311-acre Welcomes Farm at nearby Coulsdon. In 1825 Thomas married Harriett Toulmin, whose family lived at The Elms, 61 High Street, and the couple moved in 1831. In 1862, Thomas Keen died on 17 February at the age of 61. In that same year, Keen & Sons amalgamated with Robinson & Belville, manufacturers of patented groats and barley, to become Keen Robinson & Company. In 1903, Keen Robinson & Company was acquired by J & J Colman, the mustard producer based in Norwich. Colman's merged with Reckitt & Sons in 1938, becoming Reckitt & Colman. In the 1930s, the Keen's Mustard Club was created. Members received a Mustard Club Badge in the shape of a mustard pot and a booklet entitled \\"Inner Secrets of the Mustard Club\\". In the 1940s, the versatility of mustard was promoted with the formula for a mustard footbath appearing on the back of Keen's tins: \\"one of mustard, two of flour, leave it on for half an hour\\". In 1995, Unilever purchased the food side of Reckitt & Colman. Reckitt & Colman retained the Colman part of its name and continued to make mustard – the American mass mustard called French's. Outside of the UK, in places such as Canada and Australia, Colman's still sells its mustard under the Keen's name. In 1998, Keen's Mustard was bought by McCormick Foods Australia. Keen's asked Australians to search their homes for nostalgic Keen's memorabilia. The search uncovered historic advertisements and even an original mustard powder tin dating back to 1904. In 2000, Keen's Mustard took the memorabilia on tour to share with the rest of Australia.  Keen's Curry  In 1841, 22-year-old carpenter Joseph Keen (son of Thomas Keen) sailed to Australia from Britain with his new wife, Johanna. Following Johanna's death in Sydney in 1843, Joseph left for Van Diemen's Land. There he met and married Annie (Nancy) Burrows and they had 16 children – nine daughters and seven sons. Joseph and Annie settled at Browns River, Kingston, south of Hobart, where they established a bakery, small manufacturing outlet and a general store. Here Joseph produced and sold his own sauces and condiments including his own blend of curry powder. Within a decade, Joseph's curry powder was known throughout the colony and his produce was winning awards: he received a medal for his spice mix at the 1866 Inter-Colonial Exhibition in Melbourne and an honourable mention for his spicy sauce at the 1879 Sydney International Exhibition. In 1915, after both Joseph and Annie had died, the couple's sixth daughter Louisa and her husband Horace Watson took over the family's curry-powder business. Horace was reported to be a colourful character, and daringly transformed land at the foothills of Mount Wellington, overlooking Hobart, into a large advertising sign: using heavy stones painted white, he formed the words 'Keen's Curry' in letters 15 metres high. Public uproar resulted, but Horace won the right to use the land as an advertising sign. In a university prank in 1926, the letters briefly read 'Hell's Curse', and students altered it again in 1962 to promote a theatre production. In 1994 the landmark read 'No Cable Car' as a protest against a proposed development. However the sign has been restored after every change. While well known in Tasmania, Keen's Curry Powder began to receive national attention in 1954 when the formula and rights were sold to Reckitt & Colman Australia Ltd (currently, Reckitt Benckiser (Australia) Pty Limited) – more than a century after Joseph set sail from England. Reckitt & Colman Australia had long been the manufacturers of a different product – Keen's Mustard. In 1998, both the Keen's Mustard and Curry brands were acquired by McCormick Foods Australia Pty Ltd.

There are many sources of criticism, both ancient and modern, stemming from other religions, the non- religious, and other Buddhists.  Criticism of Buddhist practices  = Women in Buddhism = Most schools of Buddhism have more rules for bhikkunis (nuns) than bhikkus (monk) lineages. Theravada Buddhists explain that in the time of the Buddha, nuns had such problems like safety if they were to be ordained the same way as monks who traveled around in the forest and between cities. Thus, more rules have to be created for nuns; for instance: nuns are forbidden to travel alone.Women in Buddhism Alexander Berzin referred to the Dalai Lama's statement at the 2007 Hamburg congress:Berzin Summary Report Human Rights and the Status of Women in Buddhism The most criticised doctrine is found in Amida Buddha's vow 35: \\"The Buddha established the Vow of transformation [women] into men, Thereby vowing to enable women to attain Buddhahood\\". Earlier limitations on attainment of Buddhahood by women were abolished in the Lotus Sutra which opened the direct path to enlightenment for women equally to men. According to Nichiren \\"Only in the Lotus Sutra do we read that a woman who embraces this sutra not only excels all other women but surpasses all men\\".Writing of Nichiren Daishonin, vol1. p 463 =Nationalism= In medieval Southeast Asia, there were a number of Buddhist states, including the Pagan Kingdom, the Sukhothai Kingdom, and the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa. In Sri Lanka especially, modern monks frequently involve themselves in nationalist politics.Ananda Abeysekara, \\"The Saffron Army, Violence, Terror(ism): Buddhism, Identity, and Difference in Sri Lanka\\". Numen 48.1 (2001). These Buddhist nationalists have been opposed by the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement, a self-governance movement led by the Buddhist A. T. Ariyaratne and based in Buddhist ideals, who condemn the use of violence and the denial of human rights to Tamils and other non-Buddhists. Maung Zarni, a Burmese democracy advocate, human rights campaigner, and a research fellow at the London School of Economics who has written on the violence in Myanmar and Sri Lanka, states that there is no room for fundamentalism in Buddhism. \\"No Buddhist can be nationalistic,\\" said Zarni, \\"There is no country for Buddhists. I mean, no such thing as ‘me,’ ‘my’ community, ‘my’ country, ‘my’ race or even ‘my’ faith.\\" =Accusations of violence= Violence in Buddhism refers to acts of violence and aggression committed by Buddhists with religious, political, and socio-cultural motivations. Buddhism is generally seen as among the religious traditions least associated with violence,Buddhist Warfare by Michael Jerryson and Mark Juergensmeyer / Oxford University Press 2010, p.3 but in the history of Buddhism there have been acts of violence directed, fomented or inspired by Buddhists.  Criticism of Buddhist doctrine  = Accusations of nihilism = Friedrich Nietzsche, through Schopenhauer whose pessimism was highly influenced by Buddhist philosophy, interpreted Buddhism as a life-negating philosophy that seeks to escape an existence dominated by suffering. According to Omar Moad, Nietzsche misunderstood the meaning of Buddhist doctrine. The term Dukkha has different meanings and is neither pessimistic nor optimistic. Dukkha may mean disappointment, desires, cravings, bereavement, unfulfillment, or dissatisfaction. Lama Surya Das emphasizes the matter-of-fact nature of Dukkha: While the Buddha describes the flawed and imperfect nature of life in the first noble truth, he also points to the causes that underlie this imperfection and how to bring these causes to an end.https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part1.html =Confucian criticism= Buddhism is sometimes seen as antithetical to much of Confucian philosophy. Due to the focus on social roles as the source of ethical obligation in Confucianism compared to the seemingly inherent nonconformity of Buddhism, there was a sustained ethical critique of Buddhism in early Confucianism. While Buddhism entails the belief there is nothing rightfully considered the self, Confucianism emphasized the self a great deal in their doctrines of self-development and societal roles. As a consequence Buddhism was considered by many to be nihilistic. =Arguments of secular origin= Sam Harris, a prominent proponent of New AtheismDawkins, Harris, Hitchens and Daniel Dennett have been described as the \\"Four Horsemen\\" of the \\"New Atheism\\". See 'THE FOUR HORSEMEN,' Discussions with Richard Dawkins: Episode 1, RDFRS - RichardDawkins.net and » Blog Archive » The Four Horsemen of the New Atheism and practitioner of Buddhist meditation, claims that many practitioners of Buddhism improperly treat it as a religion, criticizes their beliefs as \\"naive, petitionary, and superstitious,\\" and claims that such beliefs impede the spread of Buddhist principles.Killing the Buddha by Sam Harris However, he has also underlined that these beliefs stem from the tendency of some Buddhists to not follow a fundamental teaching of Buddhism; namely, to believe a teaching only with sufficient evidence.https://samharris.org/killing-the-buddha/ Stephen Batchelor, author of \\"Buddhism without Beliefs\\" has written about karma and rebirth, asserting that the Buddha “did not claim to have had experience that granted him privileged, esoteric knowledge of how the universe ticks”. However, his critics point out that his assertion is contrary to the earliest written records of the Buddha's teaching as well as hundreds of years of academic study on the topic. They also point to a lack of scholarly research on Batchelor's part to give credibility to his claims; and suggest that Batchelor may be attempting to reshape Buddhism due to his own discomfort with concepts such as karma and rebirth.http://fpmt.org/mandala/archives/mandala-issues- for-2010/october/distorted-visions-of-buddhism-agnostic-and-atheist/ See also * Bulssi Japbyeon * Index of Buddhism-related articles * Secular Buddhism References Further reading * Category:Anti-Buddhism Buddhism Category:Buddhism-related controversies Category:Buddhism and politics Category:Buddhist nationalism ","title":"Criticism of Buddhism"},{"id":"10510207","text":"Pina Records is a Puerto Rican record label founded by Rafael Antonio Pina Nieves in 1996.

It is a large pigeon with a wingspan of up to 22 inches and can weigh as much as 1 pound. Description Patagioenas picazuro is a brown bird with white dashes on the back of its neck and darker brown wing patterns. It is similar in appearance to the spotted dove. Distribution The picazuro pigeon is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. It has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 5,800,000 km2 and although an accurate population count has not taken place, it is believed that the species is common and the population is thought to be increasing. Picazuro pigeons survive in a variety of habitats; from woodland and forest to agricultural land. Diet This species feeds mainly on the ground and like most other pigeons eats seeds and grain. Reproduction Picazuro pigeons nest in every month of the year. A fragile nest is built from sticks and one egg is laid. Both parents incubate the egg. Once the egg has hatched, the chick is fed on crop milk and then regurgitated seeds. References * InfoNatura: Birds, mammals, and amphibians of Latin America [web application]. 2004. Version 4.1 .

He served as mayor of the town from 1975 to 1997, and as chair of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury from 1998 to 2000. Early life Born in Italy, he moved to Capreol with his family at the age of seven.\\"Mazzuca a local legend\\". Sudbury Star, September 10, 2009. He worked in his parents' family-owned grocery store in childhood. As a young man Mazzuca went to work for CN Rail, where he was a brakeman for 37 years. In 1950 he opened Mazzuca Furniture & Appliance Company.\\"Mazzuca was a political force: Mayor\\" Northern Life, September 10, 2009. Political career First elected to the town council of Capreol in 1957, Mazzuca served as the town's mayor from 1975 to 1997. In that year, he ran for chair of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury, losing to Peter Wong — however, Wong died in office the following year, and Mazzuca ran in and won the resulting by- election. He served as the final chair of the regional municipality, which was amalgamated into the current city of Greater Sudbury in 2001. During Mazzuca's term as regional chair, Sudbury resident Ron Billard wrote a letter to the editor of the Sudbury Star, criticizing Mazzuca for using a limousine to travel to Toronto for a meeting at Queen's Park;\\"Man successfully sued city: Ron Billard, 70, a vocal critic of local government, dies\\". Sudbury Star, December 18, 2003. Mazzuca's response to the letter was \\"just tell the stupid bastard to call me on the phone\\".\\"Answers denied in killer's transfer\\". Sudbury Star, December 27, 2000. Billard sued for defamation, demanding $150,000 in damages, although the suit was settled out of court for $7,500; Mazzuca in turn sued the Star for printing a comment he had intended off the record. Although a longtime opponent of proposals to amalgamate the regional municipality of Sudbury into a single city, he endorsed the proposal in 1999 after provincial Municipal Affairs minister Steve Gilchrist indicated that reform of the region's existing model of government was inevitable.\\"Create one supercity\\". Sudbury Star, September 4, 1999. In a reform model proposed by Mazzuca, the existing number of councillors across the seven municipal councils of the region would have been retained on the new merged council, in order to protect the level of representation in the suburban towns; however, in the model that was ultimately implemented, the number of councillors was significantly reduced. As a result, following his retirement Mazzuca went back to being a bluntly outspoken advocate of holding a deamalgamation referendum.\\"Councillors rally support for de-amalgamation\\" , Northern Life, April 25, 2006.

The current editions of the book bear the title The Gospel as Revealed to Me. The book was first published in Italian in 1956 and has since been translated into 10 languages and is available worldwide. It is based on the over 15,000 handwritten pages produced by Maria Valtorta between 1943 and 1947. During these years she reported visions of Jesus and Mary and claimed personal conversations with and dictations from Jesus.Freze, Michael, Voices, Visions, and Apparitions, (Sep 1993) OSV Press p. 251 Her notebooks (published separately) include close to 700 detailed episodes in the life of Jesus, as an extension of the gospels. Valtorta's handwritten episodes (which had no chronological order) were typed into separate pages by her priest and reassembled as a book.Rookey O.S.M., Peter M., Shepherd of Souls: The Virtuous Life of Saint Anthony Pucci, (Jun 2003) CMJ Marian Press pp. 1-3 The first copy of the book was presented to Pope Pius XII, and the three Servite priests who attended the 1948 papal audience stated that he gave his verbal approval to \\"publish this work as is; he who reads will understand.\\" However, the Holy Office forbade publication and, when in spite of that prohibition publication followed, placed the book on the Index of Forbidden Books.Lindsey, David Michael, The Woman and the Dragon, The: Apparitions of Mary, (Jan 31, 2001) Pelican pp. 324-326 In 1992, at the request of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi asked the publisher to ensure that \\"in any future reprint of the volumes, each should, right from its first page, clearly state that the 'visions' and 'dictations' referred to in it cannot be held to be of supernatural origin but must be considered simply as literary forms used by the author to narrate in her own way the life of Jesus\\". The publisher maintained that this was an implicit declaration that the work was free of doctrinal or moral error.L'opera di Maria Valtorta e la Chiesa (The work of Maria Valtorta and the Church) Writing Maria Valtorta was bedridden in Viareggio, Italy, for most of her life due to complications from being struck in the back at random while walking on a street. Valtorta was a member of the Third Order Servites of Mary, affiliated to the order to which her spiritual director, Fr. Romuald Migliorini OSM belonged. On the morning of Good Friday 1943 she reported having a vision in which Jesus appeared and spoke to her. While Valtorta did not begin writing The Poem of the Man-God until 1944, pre-Poem writings included various topics such as Mariology, Darwinism, and suffering. She reported having many more visions and conversations with Jesus and the Virgin Mary and said that Jesus had asked her to record her visions in writing. She continued to write her visions in her notebooks until 1947. The Poem of the Man-God is not a sequential transcription of Valtorta's notebooks, because her reported visions (which were dated in her notebooks) were not in the same order as the flow of time in the narrative she wrote. For instance, she reported having a vision of The Last Supper on March 9, 1945, while another on the Beatitudes during the Sermon on the Mount was written more than two months later on May 24, 1945. The book as transcribed by her priest however, follows the life of Jesus in chronological form, with footnotes referring to the dates on which she wrote each episode. =Narrative style= Valtorta frequently described a scene, giving details of the background, trees, mountains and weather conditions on the day in first century Judea that she claims an event took place. For instance, her prelude to the Sermon on the Mount written on May 22, 1945, depicts the road on which Jesus is walking, states that it was a clear day on which Mount Hermon could be seen by Jesus but Lake Merom could not be seen. In some episodes she writes about the colors of the clothing she believed had been worn by Jesus or the Apostles. Valtorta's accounts include detailed conversations. In the Sermon on the Mount episode written on May 22, 1945, Jesus is met on the road by Saint Philip the Apostle and they converse. The scene then describes how the other Apostles come down the mountain to greet Jesus and how the Sermon on the Mount begins. While the Gospel of Matthew refers to the Beatitudes in a few paragraphs (Matthew 5:3-12), the text for the single Beatitude \\"poor in the spirit\\" spoken by Jesus in her vision is one and a half pages long in Valtorta's account. The full text of the Sermon on the Mount that she wrote in her notebook and attributed to Jesus takes three episodes from May 24 to 27, 1945, and is over 30 pages long. The fact that her text of the Beatitudes still has the same eight or ninefold structure as the Beatitudes in the Gospel, but is far more detailed, is characteristic of her writings and her imagination. Her supposed visions describe parables, miracles and episodes in the life of Jesus not present in any of the synoptic Gospels. On February 16, 1944, she wrote her account of the Trial of Jesus by Caiphas. In the synoptic Gospels, Luke places the trial after daybreak, while Matthew and Mark refer to it as taking place at night. Valtorta's version has two trials, one at night and the other after daybreak. The second trial is prompted by Gamaliel's insistence that the time and place of the night trial is against Jewish judicial procedures, and his demand for a new trial after daybreak. Another example is the episode she wrote on February 28, 1946. It reports that in preparation for his Passion, Jesus visited the town of Kerioth to say farewell and performed a miracle, curing a woman described as \\"Anne of Kerioth\\" on her deathbed. In this episode Jesus instructs the Anne to forever tend to and comfort Mary of Simon – who Valtorta argued was the mother of Judas Iscariot and who would supposedly be heartbroken upon the betrayal by her son and the deaths of Jesus and Judas in the near future. =Astronomical analysis= constellation Orion The narrative of The Poem of the Man-God includes a number of observations of the positions of the heavenly bodies. For instance, in episode written on December 11, 1945, Valtorta wrote of a night Jesus spent at Gadara: \\"the sky is glistening with countless stars... with its springtime constellations and the magnificent stars of Orion: of Rigil and Betelgeuse, of Aldebaran, of Perseus, Andromeda and Cassiopeia and the Pleiades united like sisters. And Sapphirine Venus covered with diamonds, and Mars of pale ruby and the topaz of Jupiter...\\" In 1994 Purdue University physicist Lonnie VanZandt analyzed these events to estimate a date for the event described. Using a computer simulation, VanZandt noted that the only possibilities for the observation Valtorta described during the month of March would be AD31 and AD33, and after considering other elements in the narrative concluded that March AD33 was the only possibility. According to VanZandt the estimation of the joint observability of these three stars and the position of the moon during that time would have been almost impossible without a computer system.VanZandt, Lonnie Lee. \\"Astronomical dating of the Poem of the Man-God\\", Lonnie Lee VanZandt (1937 - 1995) Reminisces by Friends and Colleagues, Purdue University, September 9, 1995  Publication  Maria Valtorta was at first reluctant to have her notebooks published but, on the advice of her priest, in 1947 she agreed to their publication. The handwritten pages were typed and bound by Father Romuald Migliorini OSM and fellow Servite Father Corrado Berti OSM. Shortly after April 1947, Father Berti presented the first copy of the work to Pope Pius XII, who on February 26, 1948, received Fathers Migliorini and Berti, along with their prior, Father Andrea Checchin, in special audience, as reported on the next day's L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican newspaper. According to Rookey, at the meeting Pius reportedly told the three priests; \\"Publish this work as it is. There is no need to give an opinion about its origin, whether it be extraordinary or not. Who reads it, will understand. One hears of many visions and revelations. I will not say they are all authentic; but there are some of which it could be said that they are.\\" In his 8 December 1978 account of the events concerning Maria Valtorta's writings, Berti summarized the Pope's words as \\"Publish this work as it is.\\" Bishop Roman Danylak says that Cardinal Edouard Gagnon, writing on October 31,1987, to the Maria Valtorta Research Center, spoke of \\"the kind of official Imprimatur granted before witnesses by the Holy Father in 1948\\", while writer David Michael Lindsey reports Cardinal Gagnon as saying: \\"This judgment by the Holy Father in 1948 was an official Imprimatur of the type given before witnesses.\\" The permission of the author's ordinary or of the ordinary of the place of publication or of printing was required for publishing such books and had to be given in writing. According to Bishop Danylak, the publishers of the first edition purporting to present private visions and revelations, had not submitted the work to prior ecclesiastical approval. Apparently assuming that he had a verbal papal approval, Father Berti presented the work for publication to the Vatican Printing Office. A year later, in 1949, the Holy Office summoned Father Berti and ordered him to surrender all copies and promise not to publish the work. Father Berti handed over his typed copies, but returned the original handwritten text to Maria Valtorta. In 1950, Maria Valtorta signed a contract with the publisher Michele Pisani, who between 1956 and 1959 printed the work in four volumes, the first of which was titled The Poem of Jesus and the others The Poem of the Man-God.  The Church places the book on the Index of Prohibited Books  By a decree of January 5, 1960, published on instructions of Pope John XXIII, the Holy Office condemned the published work and included it in the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. The decree was published also on L'Osservatore Romano of January 6, 1960, accompanied by a front-page, unsigned article under the heading \\"A Badly Fictionalized Life of Jesus\\". The book was placed on the Index because of its claim to supernatural guidance.Maunder, Chris. Our Lady of the Nations: Apparitions of Mary in 20th-century Catholic Europe, Oxford University Press, 2016 The Vatican newspaper republished the content of the decree on December 1, 1961, together with an explanatory note, as mentioned by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, in his letter 144/58 of January 31, 1985, in which he entrusted to Cardinal Giuseppe Siri, Archbishop of Genoa, the decision whether to inform a priest of his archdiocese that the Valtorta work had indeed been placed on the Index, which keeps its moral force, and that \\"a decision against distributing and recommending a work, which has not been condemned lightly, may be reversed, but only after profound changes that neutralize the harm which such a publication could bring forth among the ordinary faithful\\". In 1992 Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi, President of the Italian Episcopal Conference, directed the publisher of the work to state clearly at the beginning of each volume that the \\"visions\\" and \\"revelations\\" referred to in it \\"cannot be held to be of supernatural origin but must be considered simply as literary forms used by the author to narrate in her own way the life of Jesus\\". His directive, communicated by letter 324/92 of January 6, 1992, was made at the request of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. His letter also recalled the notes about the matter that appeared on L'Osservatore Romano of January 6, 1960, and June 15, 1966.Valtorta Opinions In 1993 Cardinal Ratzinger wrote to Bishop Raymond James Boland of Birmingham, Alabama, that his Congregation had made that request to the Italian Bishops Conference to ask the publisher to have a disclaimer printed in the volumes that \\"clearly indicated from the very first page that the 'visions' and 'dictations' referred to in it are simply the literary forms used by the author to narrate in her own way the life of Jesus. They cannot be considered supernatural in origin.\\" Support A 2009 Yale University report further detailed the intricate connection between the Medjugorje apparitions and the writings of Maria Valtorta.Yale University Publishes Article on the Medjugorje Connection to Maria Valtorta The purported Medjugorje visionaries Marija Pavlovic and Vicka Ivankovic have stated that Maria Valtorta's records of her conversations with Jesus are truthful.Words from heaven: Messages of Our Lady from Medjugorje: a documented record of the messages and their meanings Saint James Publishing, 1990: page 145 According to a statement Ivankovic made on January 27, 1988, in 1981 the Virgin Mary told her at Medjugorje: \\"If a person wants to know Jesus he should read Maria Valtorta. That book is the truth\\". However Fr. Philip Pavich OFM, an American Croatian Franciscan priest stationed in Medjugorje, sent a circular letter to the Medjugorje fans, questioning the purported visions of Maria Valtorta and the subsequent book. The Poem of the Man-God is also mentioned in the writings of Ottavio Michelini, from Mirandola, who reported a supposed series of Dictations and Visions also given to him by Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary from 1975 to 1979. When providing his \\"imprimatur\\" in 2002, Bishop Danylak wrote: \\"Is there anything against faith or morals in her writings? All her critics begrudgingly have acknowledged that there is nothing against faith and morals. …There is nothing objectionable in The Poem of the Man-God and all the other writings of Valtorta.\\" Archbishop George Hamilton Pearce SM wrote: \\"I find it tremendously inspiring. It is impossible for me to imagine that anyone could read this tremendous work with an open mind and not be convinced that its author can be no one but the Holy Spirit of God.\\" Criticism According to Father Mitch Pacwa SJ, \\"the long speeches of Jesus and Mary starkly contrast with the evangelists, who portray Jesus as 'humble, reserved; His discourses are lean, incisive.' In addition, Pacwa writes that the poem has \\"'many historical, geographical and other blunders.' For instance, Jesus uses screwdrivers (Vol. 1, pp. 195, 223), centuries before screws existed.\\"Father Mitch Pacwa, S.J., \\"Is 'The Poem Of The Man-God' Simply A Bad Novel?\\" Note that, though the screw system of raising water was invented in 235 BC, modern screws did not appear until about AD 1400 (Kendall F.

Critically acclaimed, the film won five Goya Awards: Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor (Antonio Resines), Best Original script and Best Original Music. Ricardo Franco made just one more film; he died of a heart attack in 1998. Plot Rafael is a kind, good-hearted butcher. He has a lonely life after accidentally castrating himself while cutting meat several years before, but he longs to have a family life, a dream that seems unattainable for him. One early morning when he is driving his truck to his butcher’s shop, he sees a young man assaulting a woman. Rafael cannot help but intervene and jumps out of his vehicle to help her. Taking pity on the girl, he takes her to his home. Her name is Marina and the man who was beating her was her boyfriend, Daniel. Marina, nicknamed One-Eye (for she lost one eye in a childhood accident), tells Rafael how she and Daniel grew up together in a hostile environment in an orphanage, where she was left abandoned by her father. Marina feels attach to Daniel, as they do not have anybody else. They have had a hard life on the streets, and now that she is pregnant by him, she is adamant not only to have the baby, that Daniel does not want, but she would like to offer the baby the family life, she never had. After knowing that Daniel is now in jail, Rafael proposes to Marina to take care of her and the baby. She gladly accepts his offer but warns him that Daniel sooner or later will come back and then she would not know what to do. Marina and Rafael both grab the possibility to fulfill the impossible dream they once had to form a family. Rafael treats the troubled Marina with kindness and she responds by proving that there is more than one way to be a man and to experience love. In this way, the two find healing and happiness raising Marina's daughter, Estrella, that Rafael recognizes as his own. Years later, their happiness is threatened by the sudden return of Daniel, fresh out of prison. He knocks on the door one night, beaten and bleeding, just as Marina arrived years ago. He only wants a place to live. Though he knows that Marina has strong, unresolved feelings for Daniel, Rafael does not want to lose her and reluctantly allows Daniel to stay for a few days that become weeks. With only lifetimes of strife in common, the three lonely, disaffected adults thus form an uneasy family. Marina is reluctant to be left alone with Daniel, it is not him who she does not trust but her own feelings. To see her reaction, Rafael goes to his sister's house in the countryside, leaving the other two alone. Rafael comes back soon unexpectedly finding Marina and Daniel together in bed. He initially wants them to leave but finally comes to accept an uncommon arrangement and the three of them remain together with their daughter forming an uneasy family. Daniel, who passes as Marina’s brother, helps Rafael in the Butcher’s shop and settles into a family life for a while. He finally leaves as Marina has said that he would do eventually. Nevertheless, not much later he is in trouble and Marina leaves to follow him. Rafael is now alone to take care of Estrella, the daughter. Time has gone by and watching the T.V. news Rafael finds out that Daniel has been involved in a robbery with a band of criminals and is once again in jail. Then Marina is brought back to him. She is pregnant again and they have a second daughter. Rafael visits Daniel in jail; between them has finally grown appreciation and understanding. Daniel feels defeated, the lucky star that he thought he had has left him. He was raped in prison and is now seriously ill. Daniel's condition is so bad that he is released from jail to spend his remaining days at home. He is grateful that now he has a place to go: the home with Rafael, Marina and their two daughters. Daniel's suffering is unbearable and he begs Marina to help him die. Unwillingly she shoots him to release him from his misery. Marina dies before being charged with the killing. Rafael is now alone to take care of the daughters. Cast La Buena Estrella centers on the three leads. Antonio Resines, who plays the gentle butcher, is a Spanish actor famous for his roles mostly in comedies. For his dramatic turn in la Buena Estrella he won the Goya Award as best actor over Jordi Mollá, also nominated. The role of Marina is played by Maribel Verdú, an actress famous in Spain for her role of Trini in Vicente Aranda’s Amantes. La Buena Estrella represents her artistic culmen, she was nominated for her role in this film as a leading actress in the Goya Awards. She is better known internationally for the films Y tu mamá también and Pan's Labyrinth.

As an actor, Mollà is most recognized in the United States for his role as Diego Delgado in Blow (Ted Demme, 2001), his debut Hollywood film since then he has made four more films in Hollywood. including Bad Boys II 2003, The Alamo 2004 and Elizabeth: The Golden Age * Antonio Resines - Rafael * Jordi Mollá - Daniel * Maribel Verdú - Marina * Elvira Minguez - Ana Maria * Ramón Barea - Paco * Sonia Cuellar - Estrella Themes La Buena Estella is a dramatic intimist film about love, abandonment, solitude and ultimate connection. It was based on a real-life story taken from an actual crime and developed by the producer Pedro Costa. Reception La Buena Estrella was well received by critics and audiences. It won Goyas for best film, best actor, best director and best original score, and was nominated for 4 others, including Jordi Mollà for best actor and Maribel Verdú for best actress. La Buena Estrella won over Secretos del corazón, a film that was ultimately Spain's candidate to the Oscar where it was among that year's nominees. Ricardo Franco, the director, left his next film unfinished, dying of a heart attack only one year after the release of La Buena Estrella, his best regarded work.
