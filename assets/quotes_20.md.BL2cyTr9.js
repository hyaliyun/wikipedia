These pterosaurs were among the last to possess teeth. Members that belong to this group lived from the Early to Late Cretaceous periods (Valanginian to Cenomanian stages), around 140 to 96 million years ago. Ornithocheirids are generally infamous for having an enormously controversial and very confusing taxonomy. Although agreements that these animals were related, and therefore similar to istiodactylids and pteranodontians, there is still no virtual consensus over the exact content and interrelationships of this group. Ornithocheirids were the most successful pterosaurs during their reign, they were also the largest pterosaurs before the appearance of the azhdarchids such as Quetzalcoatlus. Ornithocheirids were excellent fish hunters, they used various flight techniques to catch their prey, and they are also capable of flying great distances without flapping constantly. The later existence of the crested pteranodontids made paleontologists think that ornithocheirids were their potential ancestors. This is due to their very similar aspects such as the different flying techniques, the long distance flights, and most of all their diet, which consists mainly on fish.  History   Naming  Holotype specimens of Ornithocheirus simus (A to D) and junior synonym O. platyrhinus (E to H) The family Ornithocheiridae is without a doubt, one of the most well-known pterosaur groups, this is mostly due to their very controversial and convoluted taxonomic history. Most of the ornithocheirid fossil record consists of isolated teeth, as well as fragmentary bones, reaching hundreds or even thousands of remains in some localities. The first uncovered ornithocheirid remains were described in 1861 by British paleontologist Sir Richard Owen; he assigned the fossil remains to a new species of Pterodactylus: P. simus. In 1869, British paleontologist Harry Govier Seeley erected the new generic name Ornithocheirus (from Ancient Greek meaning \\"bird hand\\"), and assigned P. simus as its type species, therefore creating Ornithocheirus simus. Later, in 1870, Seeley created the name Ornithocheirae to only contain Ornithocheirus. However, in the same year, this was emended to Ornithocheiridae by Seeley himself following the article 11.7.1.3 of the ICZN. In 1874, Owen had proposed two new genera for the Cretaceous British pterosaurs: Coloborhynchus (meaning \\"maimed beak\\") and Criorhynchus (meaning \\"ram beak\\") based on highly distinctive jaw fragments. Owen reassigned P. simus as the type species of Criorhynchus, creating Criorhynchus simus. He referred three species to Coloborhynchus, including the addition of a new species called C. clavirostris; no type species was designated however. In 1876 however, Seeley pointed out that Criorhynchus was a junior synonym of Ornithocheirus, a concept that was followed by paleontologist Richard Lydekker in 1888. In the latter year, Lydekker acknowlegded that Ornithocheirus simus was the type species of Ornithocheirus, he also distiguished O. simus by its tall rostrum, while other species referred to Ornithocheirus had lanceolate jaw tips. Therefore, to avoid confusion, Lydekker preferred to use the name Criorhynchus for O. simus, and Ornithocheirus for the species with lanceolate jaw tips, this concept was later favored by paleontologist Reginald Walter Hooley in 1914. In his review of Ornithocheirus, he divided the family Ornithocheiridae into two subfamilies: Ornithocheirinae and Criorhynchinae; the former consisted of Ornithocheirus and Lonchodectes, while the latter consisted of Amblydectes and Criorhynchus.Kellner AWA, Tomida Y (2000) Description of a new species of Anhangueridae (Pterodactyloidea) with comments on the pterosaur fauna from the Santana Formation (Aptian-Albian), northeastern Brazil. National Science Museum Monographs 17: 1-135. In his review, Hooley also considered the species Coloborhynchus clavirostris as a synonym of Criorhynchus simus. In 1967, paleontologist Oskar Kuhn placed Criorhynchus within the family Criorhynchidae (which is a term now considered synonymous to Ornithocheiridae), and also recognized Ornithocheirus within the family Ornithocheiridae and subfamily Ornithocheirinae. He also designated the species Coloborhynchus clavirostris as the type species of Coloborhynchus, but agreed with Hooley that it was synonymous with Criorhynchus simus. In 1994 however, Yuong-Nam Lee revalidated the genus Coloborhynchus (with C. clavirostris as its type species), and regarded it as distinct from Criorhynchus simus. Later, in 2001, paleontologist David Unwin revised the taxonomic history of the Cambridge Greensand pterosaurs, and divided Ornithocheiridae into three genera: Ornithocheirus, Coloborhynchus and Anhanguera. Unwin also designated Pterodactylus simus as the type and only species of Ornithocheirus. In 2003, Unwin defined the family Ornithocheiridae as Haopterus gracilis, Ornithocheirus simus, their most recent common ancestor, and all its descendants. He included the genera Anhanguera, Brasileodactylus, Coloborhynchus, Haopterus, Ludodactylus and Ornithocheirus within the family, and also concluded that Araripesaurus, Arthurdactylus and Santanadactylus may belong to this family as well. However, their taxonomic status and precise relationships with other ornithocheirids are uncertain. In 2019, upon the description of the pterosaur Mimodactylus, Haopterus, which was assigned to this family by Unwin, and recovered as a basal eupterodactyloid by Brian Andres and colleagues, was reassigned by Alexander Kellner and colleagues as the sister taxon of the former. In 2014, Andres and colleagues defined the Ornithocheiridae with a different definition: the most inclusive clade containing Ornithocheirus simus but not Anhanguera blittersdorffi. They placed the genera Coloborhynchus, Ornithocheirus and Tropeognathus within the Ornithocheiridae, while placing Anhanguera within the separate family Anhangueridae. However, back in 2001, Unwin considered the name Anhangueridae a junior synonym of Ornithocheiridae, a concept that was later followed by several paleontologists such as Mark Witton in 2013. Later phylogenetic analyses however, contradict this name synonymy, with Ornithocheiridae and Anhangueridae classified as different families, therefore following the 2014 analysis by Andres and colleagues instead.Longrich, N.R., Martill, D.M., and Andres, B. (2018). \\"Late Maastrichtian pterosaurs from North Africa and mass extinction of Pterosauria at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary.\\" PLoS Biology, 16(3): e2001663. Description Comparison between the holotypes of Ornithocheirus (A and C) and Tropeognathus (B and D) Among toothed pterodactyloids, ornithocheirids were the largest; they were also among the most successful and widely distributed pterosaurs. Ornithocheirids were characterized by long jaws that had spike-like teeth. Ornithocheirid wingspans varied in size, with smaller species having wigspans of approximately , while giant morphs reached wingspans of up to or more. Specimen NHMUK R481, a specimen that belongs to the species Coloborhynchus capito, the largest toothed pterosaur, had wingspan that may have reached .Martill, D.M. and Unwin, D.M. (2011). \\"The world's largest toothed pterosaur, NHMUK R481, an incomplete rostrum of Coloborhynchus capito (Seeley 1870) from the Cambridge Greensand of England.\\" Cretaceous Research, (advance online publication). However, in 2013, a specimen referred to the genus Tropeognathus (MN 6594-V) was calculated to have had a normal wingspan of , while a calculated maximum winspan reached , meaning that this specimen clearly shows that wingspans of toothed pterosaurs could exceed . Skull Skull comparisons between different anhanguerians, notice the ornithocheirids Caulkicephalus (D), Tropeognathus (E and F) and Uktenadactylus (I and J) Ornithocheirids had elongated jaws with rounded sagittal crests on both tips, as well as robust fang-like teeth. The sagittal crest of the species Ornithocheirus simus and Tropeognathus mesembrinus extended to the anterior end of the rostrum, a feature that is also seen in Siroccopteryx moroccensis; further synapomorphies between these three species were also found, including the premaxilla having a tall and narrow shape in anterior aspect, the anterolateral margins of the premaxilla being convex in both anterior and lateral view, a feature that resulted in a bluntly rounded outline of the tip of the rostrum. The rostrum in S. moroccensis lacks a constriction that is posterior to the anterior rosette, a feature also shared by O. simus and T. mesembrinus, therefore another synapomorphy supported by these three species. Yet another feature shared by these three species is that the teeth are short, straight, and relatively uniform in size, something that is not present in other ornithocheirans such as Coloborhynchus and Anhanguera. In Coloborhynchus, the teeth were found to have been heterodont, elongated, recurved and caniniform, which is similar to those seen in another ornithocheirid called Caulkicephalus. The genus Caulkicephalus, though having similarities with other ornithocheirids, including the anterior end of the rostrum being transversely expanded, or having a low, bony sagittal crest that includes a smooth dorsal margin on the rostrum, still possesses some unique features. The most distinct characteristic of Caulkicephalus is that it bores a frontoparietal crest, a feature that is only seen in pteranodontians such as Pteranodon, and in Ludodactylus, a pterosaur once assigned to the Ornithocheiridae, but many recent analysis however, have placed it within the more inclusive group Anhangueria, outside the Ornithocheiridae. Postcranial skeleton Restoration of three Tropeognathus in flight, notice their high aspect ratio The forelimbs of ornithocheirids were proportionally enormous, around five times longer than their legs. Substantial anchorage on the body is required given the mighty arms, and accordingly, ornithocheirids have robust scapulocoracoids, and stout, deeply keeled sterna, which served the purpose of housing their substantial forelimb muscles. The shoulder or pectoral girdle in ornithocheirids is set at a perpendicular angle to the spine, with the coracoids being much longer than the scapulae. The shoulder girdle is also of typical construction for ornithocheiroids. Over 60 percent of the wing length is occupied by the wing fingers, making them among the longest possessed by any pterodactyloids. In adult ornithocheirids, the sacrum develops a supraneural plate above its neural spines. The tails of ornithocheirids are poorly known, though they appear to be composed of at least eleven short vertebrae, and become relatively circular in cross section toward the end of the series. Like the related istiodactylids, the slender femora of ornithocheirids have femoral heads that project almost in line with the femoral shaft, but seem to lack prominent processes that anchor their hindlimb muscles. Ornithocheirid shinbones (or tibiae) are similarly developed and of equal length to the femora. Although the feet in ornithocheirids are poorly known, they seem to be relatively small and gracile, with undeveloped claws and a hooklike fifth metatarsal. Classification Holotype skull and mandible of the ornithocheirids Ferrodraco (A) and Mythunga (B), and holotype mandible of Aussiedraco (C) The family Ornithocheiridae has had a controversial and very confusing taxonomic history; paleontologists who have studied this group seem to have had a different opinion on the composition of ornithocheirid taxonomy. A term called Anhangueridae was coined by Diogenes de Almeida Campos and Kellner in 1985 to refer to pterosaurs that belong in this family. In 2001 however, Unwin argued that the name Ornithocheiridae refers to an identical group, and should have nomenclatural priority. He therefore considered Anhangueridae a junior synonym of Ornithocheiridae in his study of pterosaur phylogeny in 2003. However, in many recent studies, Anhangueridae is recovered as a separate and distinct family from Ornithocheiridae, each containing different genera. The original term Ornithocheirae by Seeley had been redefined as the least inclusive clade containing Anhanguera blittersdorffi and Ornithocheirus simus, therefore it is recovered as a larger group comprising the families Anhangueridae and Ornithocheiridae in recent analysis. Formerly assigned genera In the past, many pterosaur genera were assigned to the Ornithocheiridae, however, following recent studies, these supposed ornithocheirids had been reclassified to other groups or families. The pterosaur Boreopterus for example, was initially classified within the Ornithocheiridae, however, later analysis had found it in a different family called Boreopteridae, with Boreopterus being the sister taxon of Zhenyuanopterus; both pterosaurs were recovered as basal members of the Lanceodontia in several recent studies such as the ones by Rodrigo P√™gas and colleagues,Rodrigo V. P√™gas, Borja Holgado & Maria Eduarda C. Leal (2019) On Targaryendraco wiedenrothi gen. nov. (Pterodactyloidea, Pteranodontoidea, Lanceodontia) and recognition of a new cosmopolitan lineage of Cretaceous toothed pterodactyloids, Historical Biology, and Adele Pentland and colleagues, both studies of which are from 2019. Aetodactylus is another pterosaur that was initially classified within the Ornithocheiridae; later analysis have found it outside the Ornithocheiridae: Timothy Myers in 2015 and Nicholas Longrich and colleagues in 2018 for example, are two studies that found Aetodactylus as sister taxon to the two species of Cimoliopterus (C. cuvieri and C. dunni). In 2019, P√™gas and colleagues have found Aetodactylus, along with two other pterosaurs (Camposipterus and Cimoliopterus), within the clade Targaryendraconia, more specifically placed within the family Cimoliopteridae in a polytomy. The genus Haopterus was used to define the Ornithocheiridae in Unwin's 2003 study, however, Andres and Myers in 2013 argued that Haopterus had not been previously referred to the Ornithocheiridae besides a note added in proof to Unwin in 2001 that stated that Haopterus appeared to be a small ornithocheirid. Phylogenetic analyses since then have found Haopterus as a rogue taxon either within the Pterodactyloidea, the Ornithocheiroidea, the Pteranodontoidea, or the Istiodactylidae. In the phylogenetic analysis by Andres and Myers, Haopterus was recovered as a stable sister taxon to the group Ornithocheiroidea. Later analysis have also recovered this concept, with both Haopterus and the Ornithocheiroidea placed within the larger group Eupterodactyloidea. Phylogeny Different phylogenetic analysis have found Ornithocheiridae to comprise different genera, the most typical ones being Tropeognathus, Coloborhynchus and Ornithocheirus. In 2014, Andres and colleagues created the subfamily Ornithocheirinae to contain Coloborhynchus and Ornithocheirus, this subfamily was sister taxon to Tropeognathus, and altogether formed the family Ornithocheiridae. In 2018, Longrich and colleagues had included the genus Siroccopteryx in their phylogenetic analysis, specifically as a member of the ornithocheirine subfamily, sister taxon to Coloborhynchus. In 2019, a study performed by Adele Pentland and colleagues had found the Ornithocheiridae to comprise more genera; while the typical Tropeognathus, Coloborhynchus and Ornithocheirus clade was included in their analysis, Pentland and colleagues have found the genera Ferrodraco and Mythunga to belong the Ornithocheiridae as well, specifically sister taxa within the Ornithocheirinae, closely related to Ornithocheirus. In the same year, Megan Jacobs and colleagues have recovered a significantly different set of relationships for ornithocheirids in their analysis. Within the family, three clades emerge: the first one consists of Ornithocheirus, Tropeognathus and Siroccopteryx, the second one comprises Uktenadactylus with several Coloborhynchus species, and the third one comprises Cimoliopterus and Camposipterus. The close relationship between Siroccopteryx, Ornithocheirus and Tropeognathus is supported by several synapomorphies, such the teeth being short, straight, and relatively uniform in size. Cimoliopterus has generally been recovered outside the Ornithocheiridae; subsequent analyses have found it as sister taxon to Aetodactylus, as mentioned earlier. Another possible position for Cimoliopterus is within the clade Targaryendraconia, again, closely related to Aetodactylus, and together with Camposipterus, the three formed the family Cimoliopteridae. In the analysis by Jacobs and colleagues, the two Cimoliopterus species had been found as sister taxa to the three Camposipterus species (C. nasutus, C. colorhinus and C. segwickii), altogether formed an unnamed clade within the Ornithocheiridae. However, as noted by Jacobs and colleagues, support for some of these arrangements is relatively weak due to the limited number of characters that can be scored, and the levels of homoplasy are very high. Below are two cladograms showing the possible genera that are included within the ornithocheirid family. The cladogram to the left is a topology recovered by Jacobs and colleagues, and the one to the right is a topology recovered by Pentland and colleagues. Topology 1: Jacobs et al. (2019). Topology 2: Pentland et al. (2019).  Paleobiology   Diet and feeding  Restoration of Cimoliopterus stealing prey from a Lonchodectes Ornithocheirids are generally considered piscivorous animals, this is mainly because they seem to have been suited for flight over marine settings, in fact, most ornithocheirids are known from lagoonal, coastal and marine deposits. Although the manner in which ornithocheirids gathered their food has not been researched in detail, it is generally thought that members of this family either fed like modern-day skimmers, pushing their lower jaw through the water to snap up food upon impact, or fed by gleaning food from the water surface like some modern-day terns and frigatebirds. The skim-feeding hypothesis on ornithocheirids has been discounted in recent assessments of pterosaur skim-feeding, while dip-feeding is supported by a number of anatomical features. Elongated ornithocheirid rostra are ideal for reaching into the water to grab swimming creatures. The rostral crests of ornithocheirids would have worked well as stabilizers for the jaws tips while being plunged into the water. Large, forward-facing eyes and well-developed flocculi are ideal for dip-feeding as well, which permits effective spotting of prey as well as judgement of distances when striking at them, as such, it seems likely that at least several ornithocheirids were efficient dip feeders. Sedate foraging methods might have also been used when hunting, example of these methods are: reaching food while being alighted on the water surface, and shallow surface dives. Some discoveries however, found that at least some ornithocheirids weren't completely fish hunters or aquatic consumers. This is confirmed with a 2017 analysis of carbon isotopes found on teeth enamels of toothed ornithocheiroids. In the analysis, they compared the enamel values of toothed ornithocheiroids with the aquatic and terrestrial consumers near the fossil site. The ornithocheirid enamels found in the Twin Mountains Formation were shown with lower enamel values compared to the aquatic consumers that lived nearby, suggesting a more terrestrial diet, similar to the carnivorous theropods found in the site. Enamels found in the Paw Paw Formation however, were described with higher values in comparison to the nearby terrestrial consumers. These enamel remains were analyzed, and paleontologists then found out that the values seen were more similar to aquatic consumer enamels rather the terrestrial ones. The ones found in the Twin Mountains Formation dated back to the earlier Aptian stage, while the remains found in the Paw Paw Formation dated back to the later Albian stage, meaning that terrestrial consuming toothed ornithocheiroids were more primitive creatures, while the aquatic consuming ones had a younger age.  Locomotion and flight  Restoration of the species Coloborhynchus fluviferox Similar to modern-day albatrosses, most ornithocheirids used a flight technique called \\"dynamic soaring\\", which consists of travelling long distances without flapping using the vertical gradient of wind speed near the ocean surface as an advantage, but the flight speed is moderate. Several studies showed that most ornithocheirids sprawled their limbs to a large degree, similar to crocodiles, while other studies however, conclude that ornithocheirids were generally quadrupedal. Yet other studies concluded that ornithocheirids held their limbs more or less vertically extended, similar to an avian- or mammal-like configuration. Some studies in the later genera, show that ornithocheirids spend much of their time sea fishing, and as a result, they perhaps influenced the later pteranodontids with the same piscivorous diet, as well as their well developed flight techniques. Analyses of limb proportions in the genus Anhanguera however, show that some ornithocheirids were consistent on hopping, but the later genera were suggested that they most likely walked on four limbs, which consists on their wing-fingers as the front limbs, and using their hind limbs to balance.Habib, M. (2011). \\"Dinosaur Revolution: Anhanguera.\\" H2VP: Paleobiomechanics. Weblog entry, 20-SEP-2011. Accessed 28-SEP-2011: http://h2vp.blogspot.com/2011/09/dinosaur-revolution- anhanguera.html Paleoecology Ornithocheirids were a widespreaded type of pterosaurs, with many fossil remains found across the world. The first true ornithocheirid specimens were uncovered in the Cambridge Greensand of England, these belong to the infamous genus Ornithocheirus, and dated back to the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous. Within the fossil site, several other pterosaurs were also found, these include the ornithocheirids Amblydectes and Coloborhynchus, the targaryendraconian Camposipterus, the lonchodectid Lonchodraco, and the azhdarchoid Ornithostoma. The ornithischians Anoplosaurus, Acanthopholis, and the dubious Eucercosaurus and Trachodon were also found within the formation. Fossil remains of the sauropod Macrurosaurus were also present.H.G. Seeley, 1876, \\"On Macrurosaurus semnus (Seeley), a long tailed animal with procoelous vertebrae from the Cambridge Upper Greensand, preserved in the Woodwardian Museum of the University of Cambridge\\", Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London 32: 440-444 The bird Enaliornis, as well as the ichthyosaurs Cetarthrosaurus, Platypterygius and Sisteronia were also found alongside the remains of ornithocheirids. Geological map of the Araripe Basin of Brazil, with the extent of the Santana Group shown in dark blue A Lagerst√§tte called the Santana Group (sometimes known as the Santana Formation) in northeastern Brazil was found to contain a large number of pterosaur genera. The most diverse formation of the group is the Romualdo Formation, known for its wide variety of pterosaur remains.Veldmeijer, A.J. (2006). \\"Toothed pterosaurs from the Santana Formation (Cretaceous; Aptian- Albian) of northeastern Brazil. A reappraisal on the basis of newly described material .\\" Tekst. - Proefschrift Universiteit Utrecht. The formation dates back 111 to 108 million years ago, also during the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous. The Romualdo Formation is found to contain a variety of ornithocheirids, including Tropeognathus, Coloborhynchus and Araripesaurus, the targaryendraconian Barbosania, and the anhanguerids Anhanguera and Maaradactylus were also found alongside.

Many other pterosaur were found within, these include the tapejarid Tapejara, as well as the thalassodromids Thalassodromeus and Tupuxuara. Other animals such the theropods Irritator, Mirischia and Santanaraptor, as well as the crocodylomorph Araripesuchus were also found. Several turtle remains were found within the formation, with some specimens referring to the genera Santanachelys, Cearachelys and Araripemys, and along with these, many fish remains were also found, these were assigned to the genera Brannerion, Rhinobatos, Rhacolepis, Tharrhias and Tribodus. Ornithocheirids were also partially distributed in North America, and several specimens that were found are thought to belong to the genus Uktenadactylus (originally Coloborhychus wadleighi). This pterosaur was uncovered in the Paw Paw Formation of Texas, United States, which dated back to the Albian and Cenomanian stages. The formation includes several ankylosaurian dinosaurs such as Pawpawsaurus, Texasetes, and an indetermine nodosaurid.Coombs, W. P. 1995.

Originally known as HR 7165, it was noted to be variable by Charles Morse Huffer in August 1927, who observed its Cepheid pattern. It then received the variable star designation FF Aquilae. Analysis of its brightness over 122 years shows that its period is increasing by 0.072 ¬± 0.011 seconds per year.

A yellow supergiant, FF Aql pulsates with varying temperature, diameter, and luminosity. Like all Cepheids, it has exhausted its core hydrogen fuel, cooled and expanded off the main sequence, and is rapidly evolving towards the Asymptotic Giant Branch. FF Aql is a possible quadruple star system. Analysis of its spectrum shows that it is a spectroscopic binary system with the fainter companion calculated to be a main sequence star of spectral type A9V to F3V, orbiting every 3.92 years.

The station broadcasts a Farm format by day, with classic country music at night. The station airs regular news, weather and sports coverage. KWPC is owned by Prairie Radio Communications, which also owns stations in Illinois and Wisconsin. The studio, transmitter, and broadcast tower are located at 3218 Mulberry Avenue in northwest Muscatine, behind Muscatine High School. The tower is tall.FCC Antenna Structure Registration data KWPC shares its tower with sister FM station KMCS. History Portions of this history were taken from a taped interview with Mr. George Volger, which was conducted by Irene Sweitzer of the Musser Public Library on June 14, 1974. Additional details were provided by John and Darlene Schwandke in May 2007. Charles Henderson was the original owner of the land that was to become Muscatine's KWPC Radio. During the 1940s this portion of Mulberry Avenue was a gravel road extension and considered to be located just outside the city. The property was a working farm with grazing livestock. ‚ÄúCharlie‚Äù Henderson, who also owned an automobile dealership in Muscatine. In 1946 Henderson gave his daughter Thelma and her new husband George J. Volger the land and financial backing to start the radio station. Cattle continued to roam the land around the station's tower well into the 1970s and KWPC still occupies the original farmhouse today. Both George and Thelma were Muscatine natives. George, born in 1914, was the son of a local jeweler. Following graduation from the University of Iowa, he traveled with Roy Rogers and the ‚ÄúSons of the Pioneers‚Äù as a Public Relations agent. He began his career in ‚Äúbroadcast‚Äù with what was known early on as the ‚ÄúRed and Blue‚Äù Television Network. Eventually, the ‚ÄúRed‚Äù Network became the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and the ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù Network became the ‚ÄúAmerican Broadcasting Company (ABC). Over the years Roy Rogers frequently visited Volger at the radio station. The planning for a new AM radio station in Muscatine began during the mid-1940s. Radio signals broadcast in the AM Band (Amplitude Modulation) can travel hundreds, or even thousands, of miles. Part of the duties of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) includes protecting the ‚Äúsignal coverage‚Äù of each station to ensure that no other broadcast station interferes in the station's licensed coverage area. By the mid-1940s many AM licenses had already been issued and it was difficult to find a frequency for Muscatine that would not cause interference. The solution was found by sharing a common frequency with a station licensed in Ontario, Canada which was licensed to operate using high-power (50,000 watts) from sunset to sunrise. The terminology used is \\"clear-channel station\\". In 1946, through a special treaty coordinated between the licensing authorities of the United States and Canada, the frequency 860 AM was assigned to Muscatine with the restrictions of a maximum power of 250 watts and operation only between the hours of sunrise to sunset. Although KWPC did eventually receive permission to broadcast 24 hours a day (a provision added for national security reasons), the transmitter power is not permitted to exceed 7 watts after sunset, and that is why the signal strength changes so noticeably at night. The radio station's first broadcast day was January 6, 1947. Lee de Forest, the inventor of the ‚Äútriode vacuum tube‚Äù and considered by many to be the ‚ÄúFather of American Radio‚Äù, was keynote speaker at the event. The hand- written pages of his speech are on file at Muscatine's Musser Museum. The following day Sterneman's Clothing became the first official advertiser. KWPC was the first to broadcast Muscatine City Council Meetings and in the fall of 1947 became the first to broadcast from the West Liberty Fair. Mr. Volger thought it was important to use community members when building the staff. This included engineers, sales staff and all on-air positions. Important early programs on KWPC included: * Marian Templeman... hosting ‚ÄúProblems and Solutions‚Äù ... and ‚ÄúSwap Shop‚Äù * William D. Randall produced the ‚ÄúLittle Known Stories of Muscatine‚Äù series (Still available in book form today) * Thelma Volger enjoyed leading the Children's Programming ... and ‚ÄúHappy Hour‚Äù aired on Saturday mornings * Anna Opel provided philosophical ‚ÄúGardening Programs‚Äù * Don Wooten did both the news and sports, along with hosting a music program called ‚ÄúDon‚Äôs Den‚Äù * Bob ‚ÄúSpike‚Äù Woody also did sports * Joe Roth Jr. hosted Muscatine's first phone-in talk show. Afflicted with polio, Joe hosted the show ‚ÄúLive‚Äù from his home on Broadway Street. A dedicated telephone line connected the home to the radio station. The most common way of preserving radio broadcasts during radio's golden age was through the use of 16-inch transcription discs (also called ‚ÄúElectrical Transcripts‚Äù ... or, ET's). They were of various types and sizes, but the most commonly found today are 16‚Äù diameter. They are usually aluminum-based coated with cellulose nitrate lacquer, a thick black compound similar to that used in automotive paint from the 1920s through the '50s. They were used to create instantaneous recordings, records which could be played directly after being recorded. A large record cutting machine (essentially a phonograph with a heavy and precisely regulated turntable) was used to cut a groove into the coating to create an audio recording of the program. ET's were usually recorded at 33 1/3 RPM, although some were recorded at 78 RPM as well. (The original discs containing KWPC's 1947 sign-on ceremony were donated to the Musser Museum by John and Darlene Schwandke.) Another, and more portable recording device of the era, was the wire recorder which used steel piano wire on a stainless steel spool. The wire recorder was the very first reliable audio recorder to find its way into the American home in significant numbers. The popular ‚ÄúWebster 80-1‚Äù model sold for $150 in 1947. That would equate to $1,250 in year 2005 money. Magnetic tape recorders did not become available until the mid-1950s. George Volger wanted to add a second radio station using new technology known as FM, or frequency modulation. Although FM broadcasts at a very high frequency (VHF) and has limited range, advantages include a static free signal and broadcasting in stereo. It also meant a radio station that could broadcast at full power 24 hours a day. ‚ÄúKWPC-FM‚Äù went on the air in 1949. Additional space was added to the back of the old farm house for the transmitter and the FM antenna bays were mounted at the top of the existing broadcast tower behind the building. Like most FM stations of the 1950‚Äô and 60's KWPC-FM played ‚Äúeasy listening‚Äù music. To provide independent identity for the ‚ÄúFM‚Äù station the call letters were eventually changed to KFMH during the 1970s. The slogan at the time was... ‚ÄúFM is our middle name‚Äù! George Volger was a highly respected member of the broadcast community and served several terms on the Board of Directors of the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) which represents broadcasters on a national scale. In 1982 John Flambo purchased the Muscatine radio stations from Volger. John was the son of well known Quad-City personality G. Laverne Flambo, who had been the executive director of Mid American Media which owned two Quad City radio stations. John had been General Manager of Davenport's KRVR radio prior to purchasing KWPC-KFMH. Under his ten-year ownership, and with the help of station manager Steve Bridges (Captain Steve), the programming and talk show content of both radio stations gained national notoriety. KFMH programmed alternative rock music, which had gained widespread popularity on the west coast at the time. ‚ÄúThe Pirate FM‚Äù, as it became known, soon gained a devoted, fiercely loyal audience, as the station played lesser-known artists in a variety of genres... rock, jazz, blues and folk. KFMH disc jockey's included Borderline Bob, Sean Tracy, Dirty Judy, John Obvious and Captain Steve. The station was known for ‚Äúpushing the envelope‚Äù which became apparent following a broadcast in August 1991 that resulted in the station being fined for airing jokes the Federal Communications Commission deemed indecent. KWPC also drew attention with its controversial morning talk show. In 1991 Flambo Broadcasting constructed a new and much taller tower in rural Wilton on which to relocate the KFMH antennas and increase the range of its signal. In September 1992, Steve Bridges, who by then had become vice-president and minority owner of the two stations, contacted John Schwandke, who was managing the Washington Iowa radio stations at the time. The question was... ‚ÄúWould you be interested in purchasing Muscatine‚Äôs KWPC-AM radio station‚Äù? It was proposed that Flambo would sell KWPC, along with its buildings and property, while they retained ownership of KFMH and relocated those studios to Davenport. Schwandke, who is a Muscatine native and began his radio career under the tutelage of George Volger and Vincent Beckey, purchased the radio station where he had worked from 1970 through 1982. John and Darlene Schwandke began operating KWPC on January 1, 1993 with renewed emphasis on local news and information. Many of the philosophies applied to their ‚Äúcode of ethics‚Äù about station operation were extensions of what Volger and Beckey had implemented. Expanding the news department became a priority and included the addition of a state-of-the-art ‚Äúmobile studio‚Äù which made it possible to provide instant remote broadcasting, even while driving, from anywhere within KWPC's coverage area. The husband and wife team worked in partnership on a daily basis with John being responsible for sales, and programming and Darlene in charge of office management and accounting. Tim Scott Lissy handled the engineering. He had been employed with the station previously with Steve Bridges. Muscatine Communications Inc. was considered a ‚Äúfamily business‚Äù with son Warren active in advertising sales and the voice of John's mother being used on KWPC's daily sign-on and sign-off tapes. ‚ÄúThere was even a feeling of family among our young co-workers‚Äù, said Darlene, ‚ÄúSome of them called us Mom and Dad too. They are our radio family and we are proud of them!‚Äù Also during 1993, KFMH moved its studios to Davenport where it continued its alternative format for another year. It signed off on March 1, 1994 at 3:00 pm while playing ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Seen All Good People: Your Move‚Äù by the rock group ‚ÄúYes‚Äù. It was the same song they had signed the alternative format on with in June 1973. The night KFMH signed off about 500 people showed up outside the station to protest, but the door was locked. Later that same month the 99.7 MHz frequency was sold to New York- based Connoisseur Communications and the call-letters changed to KBOB. It was sold again to Cumulus Media and became KBEA. Even though the operation studios are located in the Quad Cities, the frequency of 99.7 MHz remains licensed as a Muscatine radio station. In March 2013, Steve Bridges launched 99 Plus KFMH as an internet station and picked up where it left off, playing rock, blues, and jazz. The original deejays returned, as well. The Schwandkes set out to explore the possibility of finding a new FM frequency that could be assigned to Muscatine. With the help of consulting engineers they were successful and in June 1996 brought 93.1 MHz - KWCC to the airwaves. KWCC is believed to be the first completely digital broadcasting facility to be built between Chicago and Denver, which was quite an achievement for a small town radio station. Every source of pre-recorded audio destined for transmission over the airwaves was in ‚Äúdigital format‚Äù and sourced from computer hard drives. Even the FM transmitter had digital capability... ready, in advance, for the day the FCC would finally mandate that mode of radio transmission (radio's version of HDTV). The station's call letters were later changed to KMCS. John and Darlene Schwandke were proud to have had the opportunity to give KWPC its 50th Anniversary Celebration. They invited George Volger Jr. to be the guest of honor and he shared stories about growing up at the station. Live bands played throughout the day from stages set up in the antenna field. Several visitors from far away brought historical memorabilia about KWPC that has since been donated to the Musser Museum. It was a grand ceremony as Muscatine's oldest and newest operating radio stations celebrated together. In the fall of 1999 the Schwandke's received an unsolicited offer to sell the two radio stations. After much consideration they agreed. W.P.W Broadcasting of Monmouth Illinois, who already owned 15 radio stations along the Mississippi valley between Quincy and Dubuque, became the new owners of KWPC and KWCC on December 1, 1999. On October 22, 2014 KWPC replaced the soft oldies portion of its format with classic country and added an FM signal via translator K233BI 95.1 FM Muscatine.KWPC Adds Translator; Flips to Classic Country References External links *KWPC AM website * *Radio Locator Information for K236CF WPC Category:Radio stations in the Quad Cities Category:Radio stations established in 1947 Category:1947 establishments in Iowa ","title":"KWPC"},{"id":"17761284","text":"The Fiske House is a historic house located at 1 Billerica Road in Chelmsford Center, Massachusetts.

Wound dehiscence is a surgical complication in which a wound ruptures along a surgical incision. Risk factors include age, collagen disorder such as Ehlers‚ÄìDanlos syndrome, diabetes, obesity, poor knotting or grabbing of stitches, and trauma to the wound after surgery. Signs Signs of dehiscence can include bleeding, pain, inflammation, fever, or the wound opening spontaneously. An internal wound dehiscence can occur internally as a result of hysterectomy at the site of the vaginal cuff. Cause A primary cause of wound dehiscence is sub-acute infection, resulting from inadequate or imperfect aseptic technique. Coated suture, such as Vicryl, generally breaks down at a rate predicted to correspond with tissue healing, but is hastened in the presence of bacteria. In the absence of other known metabolic factors which inhibit healing and may have contributed to suture dehiscence, sub-acute infection should be suspected and the protocol of obtaining wound cultures followed by treatment with the appropriate antibiotics should be undertaken. Dehiscence can also be caused by inadequate undermining (cutting the skin away from the underlying tissues) of the wound during surgery, excessive tension on the wound edges caused by lifting or straining, or the wound being located on a highly mobile or high tension area such as the back, shoulders or legs. Individuals with Ehlers‚ÄìDanlos syndrome also commonly experience wound dehiscence. Risk factors can include any of the above as well as obesity, smoking, previous scarring, surgical error, cancer, chronic use of corticosteroids and increased abdominal pressure. A very common cause is also use and especially overuse of nicotine in any form. Smoking should therefore be stopped a certain time before any surgery. Prevention Dehiscence can be prevented through adequate undermining to reduce stress on the wound edges, avoiding heavy lifting and hematomas, and speeding healing through adequate nutrition, controlling diabetes, and avoiding certain medications such as prednisone. Sterile strips may also be used to cover the sutures for up to a week. Antibiotics and cleaning the wound may also help.  Treatment  Once wound dehiscence occurs, it can be treated by allowing granulation, re-cutting and suturing the edges, and providing prophylactic antibiotics. Exposure to the air, debridement, and, if indicated, frequent dressing changes also help.

Thus Nevada became one of only two states admitted to the Union during the war (the other being West Virginia) and earned the nickname that appears on the Nevada state flag today: \\"Battle Born\\". Because its population at statehood was less than 40,000, Nevada was only able to muster 1,200 men to fight for the Union Army, but Confederate forces never posed any serious threat of territorial seizure, and Nevada remained firmly in Union control for the duration of the war. Largely isolated from the major theaters of the conflict, Nevada nonetheless served as an important target for political and economic strategists before and after gaining statehood. Its main contribution to the cause came from its burgeoning mining industry: at least $400 million in silver ore from the Comstock Lode was used to finance the federal war effort. In addition, the state hosted a number of Union military posts. Admission into statehood Signature page for the telegraph transmission of the first Nevada State Constitution, October 1864. The handwritten annotation shows the word count (16,543) and cost ($4303.27). Prior to the Civil War, the geographic area that makes up present- day Nevada belonged to several different U.S. territories. The region had long held economic ties to northern industry and financing, especially after the discovery of gold and silver in the eastern Sierra Nevada in the late 1850s, and was populated predominantly by secular Unionists who opposed slavery and sought some sort of territorial incorporation to bolster the area's economic growth: either through annexation by California or organization as an independent territory. Many early Nevadans also sought political segregation from Mormons living to the east, with whom they were often engaged in ideological conflict. The majority of what is now Nevada was separated from the Territory of Utah and formally organized as the Territory of Nevada on March 2, 1861, just as southern states began seceding from the Union and joining the Confederacy. The Nevada Territory was short-lived, however, as its entry into full statehood in the United States was expedited in 1864. President Abraham Lincoln sought the support of an additional Northern state that would presumably vote for his re-election and help force pro-Northern ideas into new amendments to the United States Constitution, specifically the 13th Amendment, by which he proposed to abolish slavery. Union sympathizers were so eager to gain statehood for Nevada that they rushed to send the entire state constitution by telegraph to the United States Congress before the 1864 presidential election since they did not believe that sending it by train would guarantee its arrival on time. The constitution was sent October 26‚Äì27, 1864, less than two weeks before the election on November 7. The transmission took two days; it consisted of 16,543 words and cost $4303.27 () to send. It was, at the time, the longest telegraph transmission ever made, a record it held for seventeen years until a copy of the 118,000-word Revised Version of the New Testament was sent by telegraph on May 22, 1881. Lincoln and Congress moved quickly to approve the constitution and Nevada was officially admitted to the Union as the 36th state on October 31, 1864. It had fewer than 40,000 inhabitants when it gained statehood, far fewer than the population at statehood of any other state. Nevada volunteers The Nevada volunteer group was made of residents from Carson City, Virginia City, Reno, and Dayton. This group was originally considered to be a part of the California volunteer group but, was actually organized, ran, and implemented in Carson City by Charles D. Douglas. The officers and members of the volunteer group were from the general public and used their own firearms while in battle. Most of the officers were veterans of the Mexican American War and many held elected public positions prior to serving in the volunteer forces. As the volunteer groups began to grow and become larger, more training was implemented. In 1863 at the outpost of fort Churchill, California was tasked with training Nevada Volunteers to be officers adequate to the standards of the United States Army. For the most part, these groups served without pay, but on occasion would reserve little bits of money from local government or by the local businesses, sometimes both. The work these volunteers did was out of gratitude and loyalty to the Union they had joined during the time of its establishment. In total, Nevada sent 1,200 men to fight for the Union.Sam P. Davis, editor, The History of Nevada, vol. I (1912), CHAPTER IX. NEVADA AND THE CIVIL WAR In May 1863, Nevada raised the 1st Battalion Nevada Volunteer Cavalry. In the summer of 1864, a battalion of infantry, the 1st Battalion Nevada Volunteer Infantry was mustered in. The adjutant-general of Nevada reported that since the beginning of the Civil War, 34 officers and 1,158 enlisted men had voluntarily enlisted in the service of the United States from Nevada. These troops were not used against the southern armies, but instead protected the central overland route and settlements on the frontier from Indians. With the units of California Volunteers engaged in the same service, they made incursions into Indian country, exploring large sections of territory which had never been entered by American forces, and had frequent skirmishes with the Indians. The Nevada volunteer group and all of the forts, outposts, training grounds and other military areas can be traced through history to today‚Äôs current Army and Air National Guard in Nevada.  Sanitary Commission  During the time of the Civil War, the Nation lacked an organization to help administer aid and help the wounded or sick soldiers. Similar to the role the Red Cross played later in history, The Sanitary Commission sought to find a way to help the wounded, sick and disabled soldiers of the war. This Commission was started in 1862 after the war had already begun and was disembodied in 1865. The Sanitary Commission in Nevada was able to raise the most per capita amount of money in the union, to the looks of . This wasn‚Äôt only money donated. The commission of volunteers created the Sanitary fund, which got its funding from subscriptions or by any other way people saw fit to assist the cause. They were able to create excitement around the idea and generate revenue by doing different promotional acts. One such promotional idea in the end raised around , being the ‚ÄúSanitary Sack of Flower,‚Äù which brought a lot of revenue in from just one event. This event brought both the republican and democrat party's together to help raise money for the war. It started out as a wager between the owner of a grocery store (Reuel Gridley, Democrat) and the collector of internal revenue for Nevada Dr. H. S. Herrick, Republican. The loser of the wager had to carry a fifty pound sack of flower from Clifton to Austin (about one mile) and if the loser is a republican they must march to the song of \\"Dixie\\" and if Democrat they must march to \\"John Brown's Body.\\" Dr. H. S. Herrick won the wager and in turn the southern sympathizer marched through the streets carrying the flour sack, decorated with American flags and painted red white and blue. This drew curious crowds of many people and ended up bringing a lot of attention and money towards the commission. Through the duration of the Sanitary Fund, they in total collected around to aid the sick and wounded soldiers. Although not everyone in Nevada was for joining the Union, this helped to bring the state together to focus its efforts on an issue that both sides could see was good and beneficial for the overall well-being of the nation. Also, this program helped to focus the attention of the nation on the generosity and community of the people living in Nevada. Comstock Lode However, Nevada's main contribution to the war was the Comstock Lode, whose silver totaling $400 million financed the Union war effort to defeat the southern states. A common belief is that Nevada achieved early statehood due to its silver, but its admission to the Union was much more influenced by political concerns, not economic. Confederate sympathizers in Nevada were not unheard of during the war; in fact, of the Pacific Coast states, none had more southern supporters.Sam P. Davis, editor, The History of Nevada, vol. I (1912), p.270] In Virginia City, in particular, sentiment towards the warring sides was split evenly. However, in strict military fashion, any strong sentiment that was pro-Confederate was struck down as Union army soldiers arrested the sympathizers and jailed them at Fort Churchill. The only time a Confederate flag was flown in the state was at a stone saloon, and defended at gunpoint by one of the saloon's owners until the owner's partner convinced him to change the flag to the United States flag before troops from Fort Churchill forced the matter. This perhaps contributed to the commander of Fort Churchill feeling additional paranoia about pro- Confederate sympathies in mining camps, and throughout the war Nevada was under martial law.Civil War History One particularly pro-Union organization was the Virginia City Fire Department. Many of them were originally from New York and had strong feelings for the New York Fire Zouaves they had known when they lived back east. When news arrived of the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run, with the New York Fire Zouaves in particular suffering heavy casualties, it was determined by the Virginia City firemen that they would book no celebrations by pro-Confederates, and they bullied any southern sympathizer they met that day by fist and weapons.

The MSR supported the return of Pierre Laval to the Vichy government, led by Petain, who removed Laval from the government in December 1940. The MSR collaborated with and was a factions of the Rassemblement National Populaire (RNP), which was founded in January 1941. A split in the RNP came after the Eastern Front opened up in July 1941, and the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism was formed. Another frontman in the RNP was Marcel D√©at, who had the confidence of Laval. When he found out that Deloncle was plotting against him, he had him and his faction removed from the RNP. Deloncle also took many member of the RNP's paramilitary wing with him. In October 1941, Deloncle plotted against seven Parisian synagogues with the help of a local SS officer, Hans Sommer, who provided the explosives for the attack. Further splits in the MSR happened over the next year, as Deloncle became more occupied with the LVF. The other factions then coalesced around Jean Filliol, a former Cagoulard, and revolutionaries Georges Soul√®s and Andr√© Mah√©. A coup against the Deloncle faction was completed on May 14, 1942, which left Deloncle without a political future.

Established c. 1646, it is the city's first and oldest cemetery. It occupies a parcel at the corner of Park and Centre Streets near Woburn Square. Most of the burials took place before 1794, and are marked by slate headstones. The last documented burial took place in 1903. In a manner typical of early colonial cemeteries, there is no formal circulation pattern, and graves are not laid out in any formal, organized manner. There are several prominent burials in the cemetery. Probably the most well-known individuals interred here are members of the Baldwin family. Loammi Baldwin, an American Revolutionary War veteran and early civil engineer, is buried here, as are two of his sons, Loammi Baldwin, Jr. and James Fowle Baldwin, both of whom followed their father into the civil engineering profession. Locally notable burials include Edward Johnson (1598-1672), one of Woburn's founders, and four of its early ministers. Another prominent family monument is that of the Fowle family, an column topped by an urn. Some of the early grave markers were carved by Joseph Lamson, a noted Charlestown carver. Stones attributed to him include slate markers carved with a traditional winged-skull motif, where the skull features eyebrows, a unique characteristic of his work. Lamson and other members of his family are known to have carved many markers in the area throughout the 18th century. The cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The cemetery is currently locked and can only be opened on weekdays by calling the Woburn Cemetery Commission.

History The cornerstone of the First Baptist Church was laid in 1826. The first services were held on January 1, 1827 by the Rev. Charles Train. Originally an \\"open\\" basement for the horses to stay dry during worship services, the Sanctuary floor was raised around 1881 and the basement closed in. Around 1888 a 4-room addition was added on the west side (rear) of building along with a baptismal on the altar stage. With the exception of some major renovations around 1998 to make the building handicap accessible, the building remains much as it was the day it was built. The original box pews were replaced by curved padded pews in the late 1800s, however the original box pews still exist in the balcony. Also still intact, however sealed in from the Main Sanctuary, are the original galleries which were closed off around 1840-50. In 1854 several members left with a \\"mothers blessing\\" to create the South Framingham Baptist Church in South Framingham. The name was changed to Park Street Baptist Church shortly thereafter. Major renovations were completed on the church in 1881. In 1998 due to dwindling membership in both congregations, the members of First Baptist Church and Park Street Baptist Church began worshipping together. In 2002 The members of Park Street Baptist Church officially rejoined First Baptist Church as one congregation now known as the First Baptist Church in Framingham. The church building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

In the United States Air Force it may be referred to by several names including Air Mobility Support Squadron, Air Mobility Squadron, Small Air Terminal, Mobile Aerial Port Squadron, and others. Smaller units performing the same mission may also be called Aerial Port Flights or Aerial Port Elements. Members of these units are normally graded by the Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) of 2T2X1,(formerly 605X1) Air Transportation. These \\"Air Transportation Specialists\\" tend to refer to themselves as \\"Aerial Porters,\\" \\"Porters,\\" or \\"Port Dawgs.\\" Aerial Ports are responsible for all management and movement of cargo and passengers transported in the Military Airlift System. Most Aerial Ports are divided into specific duty sections: Ramp Services, Cargo Processing, Passenger Service (PAX), Air Terminal Operations Center (ATOC), Special Handling and Fleet Service. Of these sections, the ATOC is the nerve center. In this section all flow of cargo and passengers being handled by the Aerial Port is managed, accounted for, and tracked by the In-Transit Visibility System. Some Aerial Ports also have an Aerial Delivery section that pack parachutes and rigs training loads for air drop missions. These training loads are designed to simulate cargo that is dropped to units in combat conditions by parachute over locations in which aircraft cannot land. One of the most important functions performed by Aerial Porters is the Joint Inspection of hazardous cargo and equipment. When any customer requires the movement of these types of shipments certain requirements must be met under U.S. Department of Defense regulations. Joint Inspectors ensure that all of these requirements are met and that the shipment is safe for flight. Because the logistical planning expertise they provide is so vital to the airlift mission, Aerial Porters may also be assigned or attached to other types of units that require their specific skills. Often these units are front line logistics units that have an Aerial Port function. Some of these units are Contingency Response Wingss (CRW), Air Mobility Operations Groups (AMOG), and Tanker Airlift Control Elements (TALCE).

The division maintained law and order until the arrival of the remainder of Force 134, the occupation force. During its time in Norway, the division was tasked with supervising the surrender of the German forces in Norway, as well as preventing the sabotage of vital military and civilian facilities. The German Instrument of Surrender was delivered on 8 May to General Franz B√∂hme, the commander of all German forces stationed in Norway, and the 1st Airborne Division landed near Oslo and Stavanger between 9 May and 11 May. The majority of the transport aircraft carrying the division landed safely, but three planes crashed with a number of fatalities. The division encountered little of the expected German resistance. Operational duties included welcoming back King Haakon VII of Norway, looking after Allied ex-prisoners of war, arresting war criminals and supervising the clearing of minefields. The division was also able to confirm the deaths of the British airborne troops that had taken part in Operation Freshman, an unsuccessful attempt to disrupt the German atomic weapons programme in November 1942. The division returned to Britain at the end of August and disbanded two months later. Background Since 1943 the Western Allies had been developing plans for the occupation of Norway, code-named Operation Apostle, after Germany's surrender.Hart, p.246 Force 134, the occupation force, was composed of Norwegian troops who were stationed in Scotland, as well as a British contingent (initially the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division), a few American troops,Otway, p.324 and some 12,000 Norwegian police troops stationed in neutral Sweden. In the event of an emergency, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force would deploy troops into Norway from Germany.Madsen, p.65 The operation came under Headquarters Scottish Command, which had been commanded by General Andrew Thorne since 7 May 1941.Hart, p.240 One of the reasons behind Thorne's appointment to Scottish Command, was a belief in British military circles that Adolf Hitler held Thorne in high regard.Hart, p.243 Thorne had met Hitler while serving as British Military Attach√© in Berlin (1934‚Äì1935). Following British Commando raids in Norway during 1941, Hitler had ordered substantial reinforcements for Norway, and British high command hoped that the appointment Thorne as head of Scottish Command would \\"focus the Fuhrer's attention on the threat [that the Allies] posed to [Axis forces] in Scandinavia.\\" Thorne, however, reportedly regarded his post as \\"being banished to Scotland\\", Two separate scenarios were considered in planning for Operation Apostle. The first, known as 'Rankin C (Norway)' was based on the assumption that all German forces occupying Norway would surrender as part of a more general unconditional surrender by Germany. The second was known as 'Rankin B' and assumed that there was no surrender and that only parts of Norway would be abandoned by the Germans in order to reinforce their troops stationed in north-western Europe against Allied advances there; in this scenario, Force 134 would encounter heavy German resistance. The development of plans for the liberation and administration of Norway were complicated by it being difficult to predict whether the landings would be opposed by German forces and the extent of damage resulting from Allied bombardments and any German \\"scorched earth\\" demolitions. As a result, planning for the administration of Norway was detailed and flexible.Donnison, p.161 Either of the two 'Rankin' scenarios would be difficult for Thorne to accomplish however, as the troops allocated to Force 134 were meagre; from late 1943 onwards the majority of military resources were dedicated to the campaign in north-west Europe. In September 1944 Thorne was even deprived of 52nd Lowland Division, which was attached to the 1st Allied Airborne Army by the War Office and earmarked for Operation Market Garden.Middlebrook, p.43 Instead Thorne was later given the 1st Airborne Division, under the command of Major General Roy Urquhart. However, owing to the heavy casualties the division had suffered during Market Garden it would not be combat ready until 1 May 1945 after being heavily reinforced. In order to bolster his forces, Thorne would therefore have to rely on Milorg, the Norwegian Resistance. The Allied civil affairs planners maintained very close contact with the Norwegian Government in exile which was based in London as well as Milorg. As a result, by the end of the war Milorg had been preparing for the arrival of an Allied force for some time; its 40,000 members were well-armed and trained, and led by more than 100 Special Operations Executive agents parachuted into Norway, and it was prepared to prevent any sabotage of key communication centres and other important facilities by German troops if they resisted the Allied forces.Moore, p.230 Prelude Allied preparations By early May 1945, 1st Airborne Division had been brought up to strength, albeit mainly with inexperienced replacements. 4th Parachute Brigade had been disbanded and its battalions merged with those of 1st Parachute Brigade in the aftermath of the Battle of Arnhem.Middlebrook, p.445 It was replaced by 1st Independent Polish Parachute Brigade. The Norwegian Parachute Company was also attached to the 1st Airborne Division.Donnison, p.163 However, on 4 May, Urquhart was ordered to despatch 1st Independent Polish Brigade to Dunkirk, and to detach 1st Parachute Brigade from the division; one of the brigade's battalions would immediately be transported to Denmark for occupation duties, with the rest of the Brigade remaining in Britain as a reserve formation. At the same time the rest of the division was warned that it would soon be transported by air to Norway as part of the occupation force, with the Special Air Service Brigade being temporarily attached to the division to replace 1st Parachute Brigade. Urquhart informed Thorne that the division could be ready for deployment in 48 hours, far less time than Thorne and his staff had expected.Baynes, p.174 When it entered Norway, the division would be responsible for maintaining law and order in the areas it occupied, ensuring that German units followed the terms of their surrender, securing and then protecting captured airfields, and finally preventing the sabotage of essential military and civilian structures. To achieve this, the division would be formed of three brigades: 1st Airlanding Brigade, Special Air Service Brigade and an ad hoc Artillery Brigade formed from divisional troops.Otway, p.325 1st Airlanding Brigade would land near to the Norwegian capital, Oslo, and occupy the city alongside other elements of Force 134. The brigade's commander, Brigadier R. H. Bower, would become Commander, Oslo area for the duration of the division's time in Norway. Oslo was chosen because it was the Norwegian capital, as well as being the centre of Norwegian and German administration. Similarly, the Artillery Brigade would land at Stavanger and its commanding officer Brigadier R.G. Loder-Symonds would become Commander, Stavanger area. Stavanger was the closest airfield to Britain, and would also be useful as a fighter base. Finally, Special Air Service Brigade would also land in Stavanger, from where it would advance to and occupy the area around Kristiansand. This was an important port from which the Royal Navy would sweep the surrounding waters for mines.Otway, pp.325‚Äì326 The division's operations would be divided into four phases over four consecutive days. On 8 May, fifteen transport aircraft would carry advance parties to airfields at Gardermoen, near Oslo, and Sola airfield by Stavanger; this was to be completed by the evening. The second phase, on 9 May, would see seventy Handley Page Halifaxes transport 1st Airlanding Brigade and elements of Headquarters 1st Airborne Division to both airfields, and another seventy- six C-47 Dakotas land the Artillery Brigade at Sola. On 10 May, the third phase would see Special Air Service Brigade land at Sola, and finally stores and vehicles would be landed at both airfields on 11 May.Otway, pp.326‚Äì327 Before the division began to land in Norway, specially selected Allied representatives known as 'Heralds' would accompany German diplomatic delegates to Norway; only when they signaled that the airfields were clear to land on would the first transport aircraft take off from Britain.Otway, p.326 Axis preparations German forces had started gradual withdrawal to northernmost Finland in early September 1944 in Operation Birke. As the value of Petsamo region had decreased, the Germans decided in early October 1944 to abandon Finland and most of northern Norway and had begun Operation Nordlicht (Northern Light), a retreat into prepared positions at Lyngen in northern Norway.Ziemke, p.307 Operation Nordlicht had come to an end at the beginning of January 1945, with only a few miles of Finnish territory remaining in German hands, and several isolated garrisons in Norwegian Finnmark.Ziemke, p.309 Soviet forces occupied eastern Finnmark, and the USSR asked that Western Allied forces be landed to support them. Only a single company of Norwegian mountain infantry could be spared for this duty, though the British and Norwegian governments provided food supplies for the civilian population in the area.Donnison, p.162 Due to the failure of the recent offensive in the Ardennes and the fact that several new types of U-Boat were ready to be deployed, the German positions in Norway became of great value to Grand Admiral Karl D√∂nitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Naval High Command as a way to continue submarine warfare against the Allies. They also were to Adolf Hitler, who denied requests from General Heinz Guderian that divisions should be withdrawn from Norway for use in the defence of Germany, and from B√∂hme in March that northern Norway should be abandoned and that construction of submarine pens should come to a halt due to lack of materials.Grier, p.190 He feared that any withdrawal might tempt neutral Sweden to enter the war in support of the Allies, and that any withdrawal from northern Norway would endanger U-Boat bases in the southern parts of the country.Grier, p.191 Until the last days of the war, D√∂nitz believed that Norway should be kept in order to deploy submarines against Allied vessels, and on 3 May the Kriegsmarine Naval Warfare Command informed U-Boat staff that even if Germany itself were occupied, submarines would still sail from Norway. Only on 4 May were orders issued by the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht that all German troops in Norway were to avoid actions that might provoke Allied forces. In May 1945, all German troops in Norway came under the command of the Twentieth Mountain Army, which had absorbed the Army Norway on 18 December 1944. It was commanded by General Franz B√∂hme, who had succeeded General Lothar Rendulic as Armed Forces Commander, Norway in January 1945.Ziemke, p.312 At the beginning of May, B√∂hme informed Grand Admiral Karl D√∂nitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Naval High Command and the new German President, with the death of Adolf Hitler, that all forces in Norway consisted of eleven divisions and five brigades. In total, they had a combined strength of between 350,000 and 380,000 troops. There were also a number of U-boats stationed in naval bases in Norway, including 10 Mark XXI and 17 Mark XXIII models. Yet although Allied forces had entered Germany, and rumours and speculation were rife about a possible invasion of Norway, the Twentieth Mountain Army almost seemed to be at a peace-time status; B√∂hme had complained in January that there were some units in the Army that took Sunday off as a holiday, and that he could do little to stop it. Occupation Arrival In the early hours of 7 May, D√∂nitz gave the order for all German military forces to unconditionally surrender, and on 8 May the German Instrument of Surrender was delivered to General B√∂hme. The Germans were to withdraw from all Norwegian towns and the Swedish border and gradually redeploy to areas pre-designated for disarmament; simultaneously, all senior Nazi party officials and security personnel were to immediately be arrested.Hart, p.248 Force 134 would be greatly outnumbered during its task; a total of 30,000 Allied troops would have to supervise the disarmament of more than 350,000 German troops.Hart, p.247 There were fears that the German forces might refuse to surrender and instead resist the Allied occupation forces, and there were particular concerns about what the large detachment of Kriegsmarine personnel at the port of Trondheim might do. Although the first phase of the operation had been scheduled for 8 May, no word was received from the 'Heralds' and so Doomsday was postponed by twenty-four hours. Contact was successfully established on 9 May and the first units of Force 134 arrived in Norway to begin their occupation, including the first elements of 1st Airborne Division and the Norwegian Parachute Company. All but one of the transport aircraft belonging to the first phase took off and landed in Norway without incident. Phase II was accelerated to compensate for the delay, with aircraft scheduled to leave Britain between 02:00 and 13:30. Unfortunately, after approximately 07:00 poor weather over Oslo caused many transport aircraft heading for the airfield there to return to Britain, although all of those destined for Stavanger landed successfully. Several crash-landed, and one was reported missing. The remaining aircraft took off again on 11 May, with one crashing on takeoff and another going missing; of the two missing aircraft, one landed at another airfield in Norway, but the other had crashed killing all of its occupants, including Air Vice-Marshal Scarlett-Streatfeild. The aircraft belonging to the next two phases suffered no more casualties, although a number of them were again delayed by inclement weather over the Norwegian airfields. 1st Airborne Division suffered one officer and thirty- three other ranks killed, and one other rank wounded, and the Royal Air Force six killed and seven injured. All of these losses had occurred after the general surrender had been declared.Otway, p.327 Occupation duties Crown Prince Olav addressing the welcoming crowd at Oslo, accompanied by Major General Urquhart. The original plan for the division called for two of the airborne battalions to march through Oslo on 10 May, but the delay meant that only a few troops had arrived by this date. Instead, two platoons from 2nd Battalion The South Staffordshire Regiment and four Military Policemen on motorcycles accompanied Urquhart, who rode in a commandeered German staff car. The soldiers, although somewhat nervous given the small size of their group, were greeted enthusiastically by the Norwegian population in Oslo.Otway, p.328 The only resistance came from the captains of several U-boats at Trondheim. Apart from this, 1st Airborne Division encountered no trouble from the German forces in Norway, who co-operated fully with the airborne troops. They were disarmed without problem, allowed themselves to be transferred to collection camps and also assisted in the clearing of numerous minefields they had sown during their occupation, which resulted in several German casualties.Baynes, p.175 Until the arrival of other units from Force 134, as well as the Headquarters of Allied Forces, Norway, Major General Urquhart and his headquarters staff had complete control over all Norwegian activities. This meant that it was Urquhart who welcomed Crown Prince Olaf of Norway and three ministers representing the Norwegian Government when they arrived on a Royal Navy cruiser, and the division also took part in the celebrations when King Haakon VII of Norway returned to his country from exile. Other duties for the division included rounding up war criminals, ensuring that German troops were confined to their camps and reservations and, with Royal Engineer assistance, clearing buildings of mines and other boobytraps. They were also given the responsibility of assisting Allied personnel who had, until the German surrender, been prisoners of war in Norway, a large number of whom were Russian. There were more than 80,000 Russian ex-prisoners of war, and many needed medical treatment because of the inhumane conditions of the camps in which they had been imprisoned. When a parade was held in late June to celebrate the Allied liberation, many of the Russians participated, wearing uniforms with Red Star badges they had made themselves. During the division's time in Norway, some 400 paratroopers under the command of Major Frederick Gough were temporarily transferred to the Netherlands, where they helped take part in Theirs Is the Glory, a documentary about the Battle of Arnhem.Baynes, p.177 The Norwegian resistance co-operated fully with 1st Airborne Division, often providing liaisons and performing guard duties, and the Norwegian population as a whole gave a warm welcome to the airborne troops. British forces were initially only in control of Oslo, Stavanger and Kristiansand with the resistance and, less commonly, local Norwegian authorities taking control of the rest of the country from the Germans.Donnison, pp.164‚Äì165 The resistance also helped the division discover the fate of 1st Airborne Division troops assigned to Operation Freshman, a failed attempt in November 1942 to sabotage the Norsk Hydro chemical plant at Vemork, which produced heavy water for Nazi Germany's atomic weapons programme. Two gliders had been assigned to the operation, and both had crash-landed after being released by the aircraft towing them.Otway, pp.72‚Äì73 The men who survived the crashes were executed shortly after being captured.Lynch, p. 35Otway, p.72 Although the local Norwegian population could not prevent the prisoners being executed, they later recovered their remains and reinterred them in marked graves. When it arrived, 1st Airborne Division was informed of the fate of the operation and cooperated with the Norwegian government to have a memorial erected and the fallen men buried with full military honours at Stavanger and Oslo.Otway, p.73Dahl, p.342 Aftermath Storeroom at Sola aerodrome, Stavanger, holding some of the estimated 30,000 rifles taken from German forces in Norway after their surrender The remaining units of Force 134 entered Norway throughout the rest of May, gradually reinforcing the airborne troops. On 10 May elements of the 12,000 strong Norwegian police force began to enter the country from Sweden,Hart, p.249 having been raised from young Norwegians who had fled to Sweden after Norway had been occupied in 1940. General Thorne arrived with the rest of his headquarters on 13 May, and took up his position as Commander-in- Chief Allied Liberation Forces. In the next two weeks further elements of Force 134 arrived, including a composite American regiment, a Norwegian brigade, and two British infantry brigades composed of re-trained anti- aircraft gunners who replaced the Special Air Service Brigade. Thorne was the de facto Head of Government of Norway until 7 June, when King Haakon returned, and from then until his departure at the end of October was Commander-in-Chief of all military forces in Norway. 1st Airborne Division was stationed in Norway until the end of the summer. It returned to Britain at the end of August, and its personnel were sent on leave. Initial plans had called for the division to be used as an Imperial Strategic Reserve, as it was believed that 6th Airborne Division would be required in the Far Eastern Theatre; however, when Japan surrendered in August it negated the need for 6th Airborne Division to be transferred. This created a problem, as two airborne divisions existed, but only one was included in the planned post-war British Regular Army.Otway, p.329 Although the tradition of seniority might have called for 6th Airborne Division to be disbanded as the junior airborne formation, 1st Airborne Division was still understrength after Operation Market Garden and not fully trained. As such, the division spent the next two months training and transferring troops to 6th Airborne Division, and then disbanded on 15 November 1945.Otway, pp.329‚Äì330 Notes References   Category:Conflicts in 1945 Category:1945 in Norway Doomsday O Doomsday Doomsday Doomsday ","title":"Operation Doomsday"},{"id":"17761604","text":"The Lehigh Gap is a water gap located in the townships of Lehigh, Washington, Lower Towamensing and East Penn in the Lehigh Valley that was formed by the Lehigh River where it cuts through the Blue Mountain in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States. The gap allows easy travel between Carbon County to the north and Lehigh and Northampton counties to the south of the mountain. One of the more distinctive features of the gap is Devil's Pulpit, a rock formation that reminds hikers of a pulpit. Lehigh Gap is also the name of a village also known as Weider's Crossing and located at the south end of the gap in Lehigh and Northampton Counties. Travel Pennsylvania Route 248 runs directly through the gap, connecting the two Lehigh Valley cities Allentown and Bethlehem to the smaller Carbon County boroughs of Palmerton, Bowmanstown and Lehighton. State Routes 873 and 145 connect to Route 248 just south of the gap. Besides vehicular travel, the gap also provides a crossing through the mountain for hikers on the Appalachian Trail. Appalachian Thru-hikers call this Dante's inferno because it is a very exposed rock scramble. The Delaware and Lehigh Heritage Corridor Trail also intersects Lehigh Gap. Rail transport The railroads Four railroad companies once had trackage (owned or leased) through the Lehigh Gap. The Lehigh & New England Railroad used to have a bridge crossing the Lehigh River within the gap. The bridge was abandoned in 1961 and torn down in 1967, but its foundations on each side of the river are still visible as are telegraph poles. The Lehigh Valley Railroad had its mainline the Lehigh Line on the south side of the Lehigh River. The Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad's mainline was on the north side of the Lehigh River; the Lehigh and Susquehanna was leased to the Central Railroad of New Jersey and labeled the operations of the lease as the \\"Lehigh and Susquehanna Division\\". Today- the Lehigh Line, the surviving rail line Today the Lehigh Valley Railroad's mainline, the Lehigh Line, now runs on the north side of the Lehigh River rather than on the south side, as the majority of the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad's mainline became part of the Lehigh Line. The Lehigh Line's absorption of the majority of the Lehigh and Susquhanna mainline caused some original trackage to break away from the Lehigh Line and became separate rail lines now operating as branch lines, including the Lehigh Line's former trackage on the south side of the Lehigh River. The Lehigh Line's original Lehigh Gap trackage which was on the south side and now operating as a separate rail line on its own was later abandoned and was removed by Conrail in 1984. With the Lehigh Line being the surviving rail line even though it now runs on the north side via the former Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad mainline trackage it got, the Lehigh Line is now owned by Norfolk Southern Railway (chartered in 1894 as the Southern Railway and is owned by the Norfolk Southern Corporation) and Canadian Pacific Railway (owned by Canadian Pacific Railway Limited) has trackage rights on the Lehigh Line so that it can reach the major cities Philadelphia and New York City. Lehigh Gap Nature Center Lehigh Gap Nature Center In 2002, the Wildlife Information Center, since renamed the Lehigh Gap Nature Center, purchased more than near Lehigh Gap. Their goal is to restore the wildlife along the Kittatinny Ridge. From 1898 to 1980, the New Jersey Zinc Company emitted sulfur dioxide at rates of up to 3,600 pounds per hour, killing plant life and animal habitats. Twenty years later, a noticeable lack of tree density remains on the Palmerton side of the gap. The Lehigh Gap Nature Center currently includes The Osprey House on the Slatington side of the river. The nature center works closely with colleges and universities on various wildlife-oriented research projects. The center also offers several clubs for young naturalists. The nature center is home to approximately 15 miles of hiking trails, open to the public from dawn to dusk.

He also designed the mass spectrometer for the Phoenix Mars Lander mission in May 2008. He is currently a professor of physics at the University of Texas at Dallas. Education Hoffman received his bachelor's degree from St. Mary's College in Winona, Minnesota and continued his education at the University of Minnesota under the mentorship of Professor A. O. C. Nier who pioneered the field of mass spectrometry. His PhD dissertation was on the helium isotopic distribution in large iron meteorites. Career Hoffman spent 7 years at the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D. C., developing miniaturized mass spectrometers for space flight. These were flown on Aerobee and Javelin rockets. He joined the Graduate Research Center of the Southwest in 1966. His main interest was in the study of atmospheric/ionospheric composition and isotopic ratios for which he has developed instrument packages that have flown on many rockets and satellites. Missions He developed instruments for the Apollos 15, 16, and 17 lunar missions, the latter being part of the ALSEP surface package. The goal was to detect and determine the composition of the lunar atmosphere. There is an atmosphere on the moon composed mainly of noble gases and hydrogen, but the pressure is lower than that in the best vacuum systems on earth. His instrument flew on the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe mission to Venus in 1978. Data was received throughout the descent of the probe to the surface. Carbon dioxide is the dominant gas in the atmosphere. A surprise discovery showed that for the two \\"sister\\" planets there is a two order of magnitude difference in the isotopic ratios (the ratio of the heavier to lighter forms of these gases) for hydrogen and argon than for those gases on earth. These isotopic ratio differences have had large implications on models of the nature of the solar nebula and the formation of the present (secondary) atmospheres of the terrestrial planets. Hoffman was a member of the team who flew a mass spectrometer on the European Space Agency's Giotto mission to Halley's Comet in 1986. This instrument was developed by laboratories in four countries, three European and at UT Dallas. It measured both the neutral and ionized constituents of the comet's coma. The coma contains, besides water vapor and H30 ions, an extended source of carbon monoxide. The atmosphere forms around a comet as it comes near the sun and is heated by radiation from the sun. Hoffman has also flown mass spectrometers on earth orbiting satellites, Explorer 31, ISIS-II, AE-C, D, and E, and Wake Shield, plus numerous sounding rockets and stratospheric balloon flights. The first observations of the polar wind, ions flowing out from the atmosphere, were made by his ion mass spectrometer flown on the ISIS spacecraft in 1971. Hoffman is a co-investigator for the TEGA experiment that flew on the Mars Scout Phoenix mission that descended on Mars on May 25, 2008. The spacecraft will land in the far northern region of Mars, above the Arctic Circle in the area that the Mars Odyssey spacecraft has found evidence for water. An arm on the lander will dig a trench a meter deep in the surface of Mars to look for water ice and other water related substances (minerals). These will be scooped up and analyzed in a series of small furnaces. The effluents from the furnaces will be analyzed by the UT Dallas mass spectrometer to determine the presence of water and the mineralogical composition of soil samples. Isotopic ratios of the principal elements in the samples will be determined and compared to the isotopic ratios of the atmospheric gases that will be measured by the mass spectrometer when it is not analyzing samples from the TEGA furnaces.

Biography Antoni Rubi√≥ i Lluch Son of the poet Joaquim Rubi√≥ i Ors, Rubi√≥ y Lluch studied philosophy and literature at the University of Barcelona under Manuel Mil√† i Fontanals and Francesc Xavier Llorens i Barba and in the company of Marcelino Men√©ndez Pelayo, who was a longtime friend and colleague. The two are icons of Catalan positivism. In 1880 he became a tutor in the literature faculty there and in 1885 a full professor of general literature at the University of Oviedo, from which he was transferred to Barcelona. In 1889 he became a member of the . In 1904 he taught Catalan literature at the Estudis Universitaris Catalans and in 1906 he was vice-president of the (I Congr√©s Internacional de la Llengua Catalana / Primer Congr√©s Internacional de la Llengua Catalana). The next year (1907) he was named both a member and the first president of the Institute for Catalan Studies. He later presided over the Jocs Florals in Barcelona. Politically, Rubi√≥ y Lluch defended Greek aspirations for Crete and, in 1897, inspired by Prat de la Riba, he wrote a manifesto of the Greek cause in the name of the institutions of Catalan civil life. He was recognised as honorary Greek consul at Barcelona for eight years and received the Greek decoration of \\"Knight of the Order of the Saviour\\"). He was made an honorary member of the Parnassos Literary Society. As well, he was a member of the Reial Acad√®mia Catalana de Belles Arts de Sant Jordi, a correspondent of the Academia de la Historia de Madrid and the Academia Espa√±ola (1930).

Different digital movie cameras output a variety of different acquisition formats. Cameras designed for domestic use have also been used for some low-budget independent productions. Since the 2010s, digital movie cameras have become the dominant type of camera in the motion picture industry. Types  Professional cameras  There are a number of video cameras on the market designed specifically for high-end digital cinematography use. These cameras typically offer relatively large sensors, selectable frame rates, recording options with low compression ratios or in some cases with no compression, and the ability to use high-quality optics. Some of the cameras are expensive and some are only available to rent. Blackmagic Cinema CameraThe digital movie camera Arriflex D-21 by Arri.Some of the most used professional digital movie cameras include: * Arri Alexa * Blackmagic URSA * Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Cameras * Canon Cinema EOS * Panavision Genesis * Red Epic * Red Scarlet * Red One * Sony CineAlta  Prosumer and consumer cameras  Independent movie-makers have also pressed low-cost consumer and hybrid prosumer cameras into service for digital cinematography. Though image quality is typically much lower than what can be produced with professional digital cinematography cameras, the technology has steadily improved, most significantly in the last several years with the arrival of high-definition cameras in this market. These inexpensive cameras are limited by their relatively high compression ratios, their small sensors, and the quality of their optics. Many also have integrated lenses which cannot be changed. Resolution  Standard definition  MiniDV was the predominant standard definition consumer video acquisition format in the early 2000s. Steven Soderbergh used the popular Canon XL2 MiniDV camera while shooting Full Frontal. The Danny Boyle directed British horror film, 28 Days Later was also shot on MiniDV using the Canon XL1S, albeit with traditional Panavision 35mm film lenses. One of the first MiniDV cameras used on a feature film was the Sony VX-1000, which was used to shoot Spike Lee's Bamboozled. In 2002, Panasonic released the AG-DVX100, which was the first affordable camcorder to support progressive scan at 24 frames per second, duplicating the motion characteristics of film and allowing for easier transfers to film. This feature made the camera extremely popular with low-budget movie-makers.  High definition  Sony, JVC, Canon and other vendors have brought high- definition video acquisition to the consumer and prosumer markets with the HDV format. HDV cameras are sold with a wide range of capabilities. Many support progressive shooting modes, and some have sensors with full 1920x1080 resolution (though the HDV format itself can only record 1440x1080 in non- square pixels, and DVCPRO HD only records at 1280x1080 or 960x720).

Peterson (1925 Warren, Pennsylvania -February 11, 2006) was an American newspaper writer who later became a freelance author of magazine articles and books, especially on the topics of sports and Scouting. His 1970 chronicle of Negro league baseball entitled Only the Ball Was White was hailed by The New York Times as having \\"recaptured a lost era in baseball history and a rich facet of black life in America\\". The baseball commissioner at the time, Bowie Kuhn, later credited Peterson's book with having \\"focused greater attention on the accomplishments of Negro League players\\", leading to their admission to the Baseball Hall of Fame. He was raised in Warren, Pennsylvania, Peterson played baseball while attending Upsala College. He was a writer and editor with the old New York World-Telegram newspaper, which folded in 1966. Peterson died of lung cancer on February 11, 2006, in Salisbury, Pennsylvania, survived by his wife Peggy and a son and daughter. At the time of his death, he was on a committee selecting Negro league players for the Hall of Fame. Peterson's book, The Boy Scouts: An American Adventure, was written in 1984 on the eve of the 75th anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). In it, he discusses the history of Scouting's various programs, such as the founding of the Order of the Arrow by E. Urner Goodman, and the influence Ernest Thompson Seton's successful use of American Indian culture in his Woodcraft Indians program had on Scouting's early development, particularly the Order of the Arrow. Peterson also wrote numerous articles for Scouting magazine in the 1970s-1990s, such as a tribute to William Hillcourt in 1985, acclaiming the influential BSA leader as \\"the foremost influence on development of the Boy Scouting program\\". He subsequently wrote another article for Scouter magazine about Hillcourt in 2001. Among the articles Peterson penned for the BSA's Scouting magazine was an account of Scouting activities in the Japanese- American internment camps during World War II.

Life and career Ferrara came from a family of Communists: his father Maurizio was a communist senator. Ferrara was active in the Italian Communist Party during his twenties. In 1982, he broke with the party and became vocal as an ex-Communist. Influenced by the political philosopher Leo Strauss, he initially gravitated toward socialism, but later moved toward social conservatism. He was in the Berlusconi I Cabinet and founded the newspaper Il Foglio. He has been one of the strongest supporters of Pope Benedict XVI. Although considered by his opponents a \\"devout atheist\\", he now considers himself a theist. He is married to writer Anselma Dell'Olio, who fought for woman's rights in the feminist movements during the 1960s and 1970s. Legal problems In 2003, Antonio Tabucchi wrote an article about bad facts about Giuliano Ferrara for the French newspaper Le Monde, but the article was never published because Giuliano Ferrara interfered with them publishing it on its own newspaper Il Foglio. He then said that he was happy to have reached the goal to get that article before Le Monde newspaper. He was condemned for unauthorized publishing and for copyright infringement. Political positions Abortion In 1989, Ferrara used the pages of Corriere della Sera to criticize what he perceived as a decline in male responsibility following the introduction of the first abortion pills. In 2008, he ran in the Italian general election on a platform favouring a moratorium on abortion, as part of a theoconservative Italian political current of which he is one of the most prominent leaders. These views might seem surprising as during his Communist period by his own acknowledgement three of his partners had abortions.The New York Times Europe's Christian roots Ferrara agrees with the Catholic Church regarding the defence of the Judeo-Christian roots of Europe.

Luttrell had played guitar with a local Champaign band, Terry Cook and the Majestics, in the early to mid-1960s. In 1968, Terry joined REO Speedwagon, replacing Mike Blair on vocals, at the University of Illinois. He sang on the band's debut album, which was released in October 1971 on Epic Records. Personal differences between Luttrell and REO Speedwagon's lead guitarist, Gary Richrath, led to Luttrell leaving the band in 1972. He was replaced by Kevin Cronin before the recording of the second album, R.E.O./T.W.O. Luttrell would go on to sing for the progressive band Starcastle on the albums Starcastle, Fountains of Light, Citadel, and Reel to Real, before the band folded in the late 1970s. He became a born-again Christian. Luttrell has participated peripherally in some Starcastle reunion projects, and can be heard on a few tracks from their 2007 album Song of Times. He helped produce some songs on an album for the country band South Of Georgia. He worked on some personal projects for himself and his daughter, Kristin Van Wynen. Kristin and her husband Dylan are the country music duo Dry Creek Station. Luttrell has said he co-wrote the REO Speedwagon song \\"Golden Country\\" with Richrath before leaving the band in 1972. Richrath is listed as the sole writer of the song and vehemently denied that Luttrell was a co- writer. The subject matter of \\"Golden Country\\" is actually one of the main issues that led to Luttrell being let go from the band. Luttrell thought that Gary Richrath was writing songs that were too politically motivated, and wanted to focus on less controversial material. Tensions came to a head one night. REO Speedwagon had a gig that was a significant drive from their home in Champaign, Illinois. During the performance, Luttrell became agitated and refused to continue singing. The band was forced to cut the show short. This angered the club owner, and he refused to pay the band for performing. On the drive back, Richrath and Luttrell argued over this for costing the band their performance money, as the money they had left would be spent on gas getting home and they would be completely broke. Luttrell became combative and Richrath ordered the car to be pulled over so he could fight Luttrell. When the car stopped, Luttrell fled into a cornfield. At Richrath's suggestion, the band drove away and left Luttrell to find his own way home. In a 2013 interview, Luttrell disputes the above account. According to Luttrell, \\"We had a pretty big discussion on the way home...It was one of those moments in time where I didn't want to sing Gary's love songs to his girlfriend. I was more into environmental change and things that were going on than what was going on in the band.\\" He concluded, \\"Time has a way of moving you around, the Lord has a way of moving you around in certain circumstances, and it was very beneficial to move on after that.\\" After a period of inactivity during which he became a FedEx driver, Luttrell returned to music as the lead vocalist for Champaign, Illinois-based band \\"Tons O' Fun.\\" Discography REO Speedwagon *REO Speedwagon (1971) Starcastle *Starcastle (1976) *Fountains of Light (1977) *Citadel (1978) *Real to Reel (1979) References Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Champaign, Illinois Category:American rock singers Category:REO Speedwagon members ","title":"Terry Luttrell"},{"id":"17762376","text":"CastTV was a former Internet video search and aggregation company based in San Francisco, California.

The show was titled ‚ÄúAugust‚Äù after its centerpiece, a 3D video from 2016 inspired by the life of August Sander, a German portrait and documentary photographer. But that video, along with an earlier one, was upstaged by Fast's surrounding installation that transformed Cohan‚Äôs white-box space into a New York Chinatown shop or bus company waiting room with metal chairs, broken ATMs, and a shabby facade. Fast seemed to have intended the Cohan gallery ‚Äúwaiting room‚Äù not as a replication of any real Chinatown but as a version of immigrant neighborhoods evoked to justify ‚Äúslum clearance.‚Äù While the Guardian wrote that the work was intended to provoke a strong reactionhttps://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/20/chinatown-omer- fast-art-poverty-porn, a group of activists and others called outhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/arts/artists-chinatown-depiction- ignites-protests.html the piece as racist ‚Äúpoverty porn‚Äù and demanded its removal. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/arts/design/omer-fast-chinatown- art-show-james-cohan.htmlhttps://hyperallergic.com/408511/protesters-return- to-james-cohan-gallery-to-say-goodbye-to-omer-fasts-racist-show/  Remainder (2015) In 2015 Fast released his first feature film, based on the Tom McCarthy novel Remainder.\\"  Continuity (2012)  Continuity features an older couple who hires male escorts to play out their dead son‚Äôs return from Afghanistan.

The Casting (2007)  In the four-channel video piece Casting,Holland Cotter (January 7, 2010), Is It Reality or Fantasy? The Boundaries Are Blurred New York Times. the viewer walks into the screening room initially encountering two hanging projection screens. Each contains a different depiction of a narrative showing the characters acting while silent and remaining completely still. The projection screens are double-sided and contain two additional images on the rear side where the viewer sees two men engaged in an interview. The two men are a young American Army sergeant and the artist in a dialog about the narrative. The artist states during the interview that he is interested only in memory and how memory gets mediated; he says the work he is trying to achieve has or should have no political slant. Although the work is politically ambiguous it shows the powerlessness of an American Army sergeant in the current Iraqi conflict and possibly the powerlessness of perceived American hegemonic power.  CNN Concatenated (2002) In 2002, Fast finished CNN Concatenated, an 18-minute-long single- channel video which uses CNN news anchor clips. The video is cut so that each word is spoken by a different newsperson.

Many think \\"Mr. Crump\\" was probably the same song as \\"Mr. Crump Don't Like It\\", later recorded by Frank Stokes of the Beale Street Sheiks (Paramount Race series, September 1927).Cheseborough, Blues Travelling, p. 35. According to a member of Handy's band, S. L. \\"Stack\\" Mangham, the tune copyrighted by Handy in 1912 was based on one heard by Handy at a dance in Cleveland, Mississippi around 1903, when it was played by a three-piece string band now known to have been led by Prince McCoy.\\"Mississippi Blues Trail Recognizes Prince McCoy\\", Mississippi.org, October 19, 2017. Retrieved 21 May 2019 New York Sheet music cover, 1913 Handy first published the song as an instrumental. He immediately sold it to the music publisher Theron Bennett, who took it to New York to attempt to promote it. Handy later claimed he had been robbed.Charters, The Country Blues, p. 40: \\"Handy later complained bitterly that he was cheated out of the rights to his song, but the man who bought the rights from him was acting in good faith and had as little idea as Handy did the song would become so successful.\\" In any case, Bennett convinced George \\"Honey Boy\\" Evans to use it for his \\"Honey Boy\\" Minstrels. Bennett hired a professional songwriter, George A. Norton, to write lyrics for it, and Evans had his director, Edward V. Cupero, arrange it for his band. Bennett published it a year later, but still the sheet music did poorly.Charters, The Country Blues, p. 40: \\"Discouraged by the lack of sales, he sold the plates and right for fifty dollars and a thousand unsold copies for another fifty dollars. the Memphis music-store owner who bought it managed to talk the famous minstrel man 'Honey Boy' Evans into using the piece in his New York engagement the next spring and engage a professional lyricist, George A. Norton, to write some words for it. It was republished in New York in the spring of 1913 with a picture of Evan's band on the cover and a note saying that the piece had been featured by the Famous Handy Orchestra of Memphis.\\" \\"As a song, 'Memphis Blues' was more successful than it had been as the old instrumental piece, but it still was not a sensation. It became more popular as other blues were published, and by 1915 and 1916 was very well known.\\" Bennett's 1913 publication advertises it as \\"Founded on W.C. Handy's World Wide 'Blue' Note Melody.\\"Hamm, Putting Popular Music in Its Place, p. 329: \\"Unlike folk and vocal blues, which usually consist of a string of 12-bar choruses, Handy's blues and other like them contain several contrasting strains. Both 'Memphis Blues' and 'St. Louis Blues' begin with a brief introduction, then contrast a strain in the 12-bar-blues form with another in the more standard 16-bar shape. To put it another way, commercialized blues of the 1910s and early 20s tend to have a 12-bar chorus embedded in a larger, multistrain structure.\\" Recordings \\"Memphis Blues\\", Victor Military Band, July 15, 1914 It was not until Victor Recording Company's house band (Victor Military Band, Victor 17619, July 15, 1914) and Columbia's house band (Prince's Band, Columbia A-5591, July 24) recorded the song in 1914 that \\"The Memphis Blues\\" began to do well.Tosches, Where Dead Voices Gather, p. 33: \\"The first recording of \\"The Memphis Blues,\\" by the Victor Military Band on July 15 of 1914.

Originally a user group for the Xerox 9700 laser printer, they reshaped its mission in the early 1980s to address the entire transaction document industry.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other activists. Mr. Simon, provided legal counsel regarding marches in Florida and throughout the Deep South. Simon also was a leader of Florida opposition to the death penalty in the 1960s and 1970s and was particularly concerned about the discriminatory imposition of the death penalty on blacks as well as the Florida case against loyalty oaths, Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, which was argued before the Supreme Court of the United States in 1961. Simon offered to represent Clarence Gideon after his case was turned back to the lower court after Gideon v. Wainwright, but was rejected. Simon was a native of Montreal, a graduate of Harvard Law School, began his law career in New York City, and moved to Miami. He died of cancer in February 1982, at the age of 52. The Tobias Simon Pro Bono Service Award, created in 1982, is Florida's highest statewide pro bono award. It is presented annually by the chief justice to a private lawyer for voluntary, free legal services to the poor. It is intended to encourage extraordinary contributions by recognizing the Florida attorney who best exemplifies the highest ideals of the profession by making legal services available to people who otherwise could not afford them, and to focus public awareness on the substantial voluntary services rendered by Florida lawyers in this area. The Tobias Simon Pro Bono Service Award is believed to be the first of its kind in the country conferring recognition by the state's highest court. See web site of The Florida Bar.

Keating is well known for his other recording synonyms Touche and Fake Blood. History Keating and Lord discovered each other through the Internet and had only physically met after they had worked on a significant amount of material together. The Black Ghosts' style was described as being \\"perverse, personal pop music\\", a tendency that has its roots in both Keating and Lord's early childhood. Keating was encouraged by his mother to watch horror movies at a young age; Lord's grandmother was considered psychic. The Black Ghosts released a series of singles followed by the DJ mix titled Mixtape and the well-received EP Anyway You Choose to Give It. Their self-titled debut album was released on 8 July 2008. The lead single \\"Repetition Kills You\\" features Damon Albarn as guest vocalist. The song \\"I Want Nothing\\" is currently featured on the Triple J Hit List. Each track from the album is to be accompanied by a music video. The song \\"Full Moon\\" is featured in the 2008 film Twilight and its accompanying soundtrack album. In March 2008, Lord performed a three-song live video set for LiveDaily Sessions during the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas.

The dam was constructed during the 1920s for primarily irrigation purposes. A portion of the dam failed unexpectedly in 1993 during unusually heavy rains. History The Gillespie Dam was constructed circa 1920 by a local rancher, Frank Gillespie, to replace an existing structure. As the dam was located at an important river crossing that would later become U.S. Route 80, the Arizona Highway Department - the predecessor to the Arizona Department of Transportation - constructed a concrete apron at the foot of the dam to allow for vehicular crossings. As the dam was a simple spillover construction, during times of heavy runoff cars would have to be pulled through the flow by trucks, and during floods could not cross at all. In anticipation of the formation of the United States Highway System in 1926, the Highway Department commissioned the construction of the Gillespie Dam Bridge, a steel truss bridge just downstream from the dam. The bridge was completed and opened to traffic on August 1, 1927 at a cost of US$320,000 (US$3,950,000 in 2007). The bridge, which was at the time the longest highway bridge in the state of Arizona, was immediately incorporated into the highway system as Route 80. The bridge carried US 80 traffic until 1956 when the highway was decommissioned, devolving to a county highway, thus placing the bridge under Maricopa County care. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 5, 1981. Failure The winter months of 1993 saw unusually high rainfall amounts that resulted in record flows through central Arizona rivers and streams, including the Salt River, a major tributary to the Gila upstream from the Gillespie Dam. At approximately 10:30 on the morning of January 9, the dam failed when a segment approximately in length collapsed into the river. While the precise cause of the failure is unknown, the extreme flooding was almost certainly a contributing factor. The precise size of the flood was not recorded due to equipment failure, but an estimate based upon a high-water mark recorded on USGS equipment yielded a peak flow of approximately per second, corresponding to a predicted 65-year flood, or a flood of a magnitude anticipated only once per 65 years. The previous high, recorded during similarly disastrous floods in 1980, had been per second. Due to the failure, three underground natural gas lines were exposed and later severed by the floodwaters. The bridge downstream survived, and was deemed safe for travel. The remnants of the dam remain in place and the area is largely accessible to the public. A small earthen embankment exists to divert water into nearby canals.

It combines a murder mystery with a portrayal of the strained, and often xenophobic relations between the Japanese rulers and the aboriginal inhabitants of Hokkaido, the Ainu (then called the Ezo). Plot summary The prologue begins in autumn of 1699, with the murder of an unidentified woman in Hokkaido, followed by the kidnapping of Sano Masahiro, son of the Shogun's Lord Chamberlain, Sano Ichiro, at the autumn festivities at the Z≈çj≈ç Temple in Edo city. Several months later, Sano is summoned by the shogun to undertake a mission. Lord , who administers the country's northernmost domain, has failed to report to the capital as scheduled, and messengers despatched to Hokkaido have not returned. With tensions rising between Sano and his rival, Lord Matsudaira, the last thing Sano wants is to leave Edo, but Matsudaira produces the piece of a toy sword belonging to Masahiro: it seems Matsudaira's agents have sent Sano's son north, leaving him no choice but to go to Ezogashima. Left with little choice, Sano departs, accompanied by a small retinue, including his wife Reiko, his chief retainer , and \\"The Rat\\", an Ezo migrant to Edo. Hirata had been training with an ancient martial arts mystic when he sensed Sano was in trouble. He also sensed that the attainment of the next level of mastery which had eluded him would be found in the mission. The mission was almost over before it began when their ship was wrecked off the coast of Hokkaido. The survivors were found and sheltered by local natives who refer to themselves as the Ainu instead of the derisive term Ezo used by the Japanese. The Ainu were much spiritually closer to their natural world than the Japanese, and in there Hirata sensed the key to his breakthrough. When Sano finally managed to get an audience with Lord Matsumae in his court at his castle in Fukuyama, he found the daimy≈ç half-mad with grief at the unsolved murder of his favourite concubine, who was an Ainu native. In order to locate and rescue his son, Sano agreed to investigate the murder to find the real culprit. He was simultaneously assisted and hindered by the daimyo's retainers, who on the one hand had little regard for the concubine for her perceived barbaric background, and on the other hand, desired their master's return to normalcy. As the story developed, Sano and his friends got a first- hand glimpse on the little-known effects of the impacts and clashes of the \\"civilised\\" Japanese people intruding into the lives of the natives who were of very different backgrounds and views of the world.

Beyond this point its concrete walls do not continue, and it becomes a mangrove-lined stream, flowing through Bicentennial Park and emptying into Homebush Bay. In 2008 the City of Canada Bay called for community responses to the Powells Creek Renewal Project, that intended to improve the appearance of the creek upstream of the confluence with Saleyards Creek. Canalisation of Powells Creek and Saleyards Creek in the 1930s affected salinity and pollution levels in nearby tidal wetlands. A drop board weir installed in 1998 has partly restored natural tidal flows. Once extensive, salt marsh borders of Powell's Creek have largely vanished with infilling and urbanisation.

It is northwest of Alton and northeast of Bentworth, just off the A339 road. The parish covers an area of and has an average elevation of above sea level. The nearest railway station is Alton, southeast of the village. According to the 2011 census, it had a population of 435. Bronze Age and Roman remains have been found in the area. The manor of Shalden was recorded in the Domesday Survey of 1086, and was included in the Odiham Hundred. A Saxon church was in the village, but was destroyed and replaced with a newer church, which was constructed in 1863. The village contains twelve Grade II listed landmarks, including St Peter and St Paul's church, Shalden Lodge and Manor Farmhouse, a Grade II* listed building. History Prehistory to Roman The village name has been spelled in various ways, including Seldene (11th century), Schalden, Scaldeden, or Scaudedene (12th century), and Chalden or Scalden (13th century). There is evidence of Roman occupation in the village, with several Roman coins and pottery remains being found near Shalden school in 1905. There is further evidence to suggest that a Roman villa was once constructed in or near the village. Bronze Age remains found in the area include a looped palstave and a cinerary urn. A Saxon church was formerly in the village; this was rebuilt in the nineteenth century, with flint with Bath stone. Medieval The manor of Shalden was first mentioned in the Domesday Survey of 1086 by William Mauditt of Hanslope. It had formerly been in the ownership of four freemen of King Edward the Confessor as an \\"alod\\". Shalden was included in the Odiham Hundred. The ownership of the manor was eventually passed to the descendants of William Mauditt alongside the manor of the nearby hamlet, Hartley Mauditt, of which the manor of Shalden was held under. The manor was apparently held by the Mauditt family of Hartley Mauditt until near the end of the 12th century, when William Mauditt gave the manor to his brother Robert Mauduit of Warminster, to be held by William and his heirs for the service of half a knight's fee. Robert Mauditt died in 1191, and his son and successor Thomas was holding the manor between 1235 and 1236. He died in 1244, and was succeeded by his son, also named William. William Mauditt left a son and heir, Warin, a minor, whose custody was assigned by Henry III to his brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall. During this time, Richard temporarily held the manor of Shalden from Henry until his death 1272. Consequently, Warin Mauditt held the manor until his death in either 1299 or 1300. Interest in the manor passed down to his son Thomas, in which he granted a sum of land at Shalden to a Knight named Walter Stoner and his freeman, in gratitude for his homage and services. At that time Sir Nicholas de Boys held the manor of Shalden as a tenant for life. In 1297 the Earl of Cornwall, in consideration of the services of Sir Nicholas, granted the manor to him and his heirs indefinitely. Sir Nicholas paid nothing for the manor, though his heirs were to pay ¬£12 a year. In 1309 Sir Nicholas de Boys granted the manor of Shalden to Robert de Kendale and his wife, Margaret, along with her heirs. The manor was then held by Ralph le Mareschal indefinitely. He was still holding it in 1310, however it had passed to Robert de Kendale sometime before 1316. Robert died in 1330, and his son Edward succeeded to the manor, but it was held by his widow Margaret until her death in 1347. Sir Edward de Kendale died in 1373, leaving a widow and a son as his heir for the manor of Shalden. Edwards's son and his brother, Thomas, both died without issue in 1375. Sir Robert Turk and his wife, Beatrice, conveyed the manor in 1376‚Äì7 to Sir William Croyser and William Bukbridge, trustees of Sir Edward de Kendale, to whom they transferred it in the same year. Edward's widow Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Croyser, soon married Sir Thomas Barre, and died in 1420. Her heir was her grandson, but the manor of Shalden passed to John de Kendale, who held it in 1428. Tudor to Georgian Ownership of the manor was passed on to William Dyer in 1444, who was a trustee of a lord named Robert Lee. Ownership was then transferred in 1485 to Maud, Anne, Elizabeth, Jane, and Ellen, daughters of John Lee, who had claimed the issues of the manor was under the will of their father, and complained that they had been prevented from enjoying them by Reginald Sandes and Robert Norton, who were also trustees. In 1567, William Lee sold the manor to Anne Twynne, and in 1591 Richard Miller sold it to Sir William of Kingswll. It was sold again in 1628 by Sir William's son and successor Edward Kingswell to Sir Richard Young of Weybridge, of whom it was purchased in 1632 by Sir Humphrey Benett. Benett then compounded his estate in 1649, and sold the manor of Shalden in 1653 to Anne Mynne. 19th century The village signpost displays the nearest settlements At the beginning of the 19th century, the manor of Shalden was passed to John Lewkenor and his wife, Anne, of whom it was eventually succeeded by their John, at an unknown point. The manor was then ceded on to the Knights of Chawton, in whose family it remained until 1840, when it was sold by Edward Knight to John Wood, the owner of Thedden Grange in Bentworth. Upon his death in 1871, it was finally renounced to his son John Gathorne Wood, who was the last owner of the manor from 1871 to some time after 1912. In 1870‚Äì72 the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales by John Marius Wilson described Shalden as: Geography and demographics Shalden is located in the eastern central part of Hampshire, in South East England, northwest of Alton, its nearest town. The parish covers an area of , of which are woodland. It has an average elevation of approximately above sea level, with some parts of the southern parish falling to heights of around . The landscape is dominated by farms and woodland such as Shalden Manor, Glenville Farm and Oldale Wood. The soil is of clay and chalk, with a subsoil of chalk, and the prominent crops produced in the area are cereals. A large number of old chalk pits indicate that the chalk was once worked in the parish. The parish contains four individual hamlets; Stancombe, Shalden Green, Pountley and Golden Pot. According to the 2011 census, the parish of Shalden had a population of 435 people. In addition, there are 168 households in the parish with an average size of 2.59 people.

The present church, St Peter and St Paul, was built in 1863, and is reminiscent of the 13th century in design. The bell-cot contains one modern bell. The old Saxon church stood a few feet to the south of the present one, and has been completely destroyed. The only piece of architecture that remains of the Saxon church is the font, which was re-used for the new church. The front dates from the 15th century and is of octagonal form, with a moulded octagonal stem and a panelled bowl. The old Saxon church was given by William Mauditt to the prior and convent of Southwick between 1147 and 1153. The grant was confirmed by Pope Eugenius III and Pope Urban III in 1185. In the present church, a book of the registers contains baptisms from 1686 and marriages and burials from 1687, baptisms running to 1790, and marriages to 1753. The churchyard contains the Commonwealth war grave of a Machine Gun Corps soldier of World War I. CWGC Casualty record, John George Miller. Shalden contains twelve Grade II listed buildings, in addition to one Grade II* listed building. St Peter and St Paul's church is a Grade II building, and the Manor Farmhouse in Shalden Lane is a Grade II* building. The Manor Farmhouse a late-medieval hall house, built with a timber framed structure that covers two stories, dates from the 16th century, with early 19th-century cladding and 20th-century extensions. The house has a boarded door and a large porch. Inside are two wide fireplaces and a room with a Tudor arch. Shalden Lodge, another Grade II building, dates from the late 18th century, with early and late 19th-century alterations and additions.

An historic granite lighthouse originally built in 1869 sits at the site, but no longer serves as an active aid to navigation. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. A short distance northwest of the granite lighthouse building is a metal tower that holds the automated light that has served as an aid to navigation since the earlier light was decommissioned in 1978. In 1826 the west end of Plum Island was purchased from Richard Jerome for $90 for the purpose of building a lighthouse. The following year a high stone tower had been constructed to support the first light. That first light consisted of ten whale oil lamps with reflectors. The light helped navigation near the entrance to Long Island Sound, especially through the \\"Plum Gut\\" channel between Orient Point and Plum Island. In 1856 the original lamps and reflectors were replaced by a sixth- order Fresnel lens. By the late 1860s the lighthouse was falling into disrepair. A new tall granite lighthouse building was constructed and in service by 1869. The structure is of the same design as lighthouses at Sheffield Island in Norwalk, Connecticut; Morgan Point in Noank, Connecticut; Great Captain Island in Greenwich, Connecticut, Old Field Point in Old Field, New York; and Block Island North on Block Island Rhode Island. The sixth order lens from the original lighthouse had been moved to the new building, then it was changed to a newer fourth-order lens in 1897. In 1897 Fort Terry was built on Plum Island. The relations between lighthouse keepers and army personnel remained congenial for many years, and the keepers could usually purchase food and supplies at the Fort commissary. But in 1916 an order came down and the keeper at Plum Island Light was informed that purchasing supplies at Fort Terry was no longer allowed. The rule forced William Chapel, the keeper at the time, to sail over a mile to Orient, or 12 miles to New London to purchase supplies. Eventually the United States Lighthouse Service was able to persuade the Army that lighthouse keepers should once again be allowed to purchase supplies at army commissaries. Starting in 1939 the Lighthouse Service duties were taken over by the United States Coast Guard. Coast Guard employed keepers were removed from Plum Island in 1978 when the light was automated on a structure built to the side of the 1869 lighthouse. In 1994 the Fresnel lens was removed from the lighthouse and moved to the East End Seaport Museum in Greenport where it is on display. Starting in 2000 the East End Lighthouses group (distinct from the Seaport Museum organization) was formed and has been working since that time with various government agencies to refurbish, and to hopefully eventually relight the Plum Island light as an active aid to navigation. On April 24, 2007 a resolution was passed by the Town of Southold that will transfer ownership of the lighthouse to the town. The Plum Island Lighthouse is not open for public visits except for community stakeholder groups who are considered for access to Plum Island on a case by case basis through the United States Department of Homeland Security. The light may be seen from the water, but landing on the island is restricted to persons authorized by the Department of Homeland Security for official business at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. Cultural The Archives Center at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History has a collection (#1055) of souvenir postcards of lighthouses and has digitized 272 of these and made them available online. These include postcards of Plum Island Light with links to customized nautical charts provided by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.

In that year, a man named Kaye, of Pennsylvania Dutch origin, built the first brick house in Louisville, Kentucky. The Blankenbaker, Bruner, and Funk families came to the Louisville region following the American Revolutionary War, and in 1797 they founded the town Brunerstown, which would later become Jeffersontown, Kentucky. Further early immigration of Germans took place as they slowly followed the Ohio River after arriving in the United States at New Orleans, and settled in the various river towns, which included not only Louisville, but Cincinnati, Ohio, and St. Louis, Missouri, as well.Kleber, John E. Encyclopedia of Louisville. (University Press of Kentucky). pg.338. 19th century By the 1850s 35% of Louisville's population would be German, totaling 18,000. Many of this number included a few Swiss and Austrians for whom German was their native language, and would often live amongst the Germans. This large population would introduce to Louisville two different concepts: bilingual education, and kindergartens. By 1854, Louisville public schools taught German. By 1900, 48,000 Louisvillians were at least half-GermanKleber pg.338,339 The Germans would found many of the city's churches. The first was St. Paul's German Evangelical Church in 1836. Others included St. Peter's German Evangelical Church and St. John's Evangelical Church. Even the first synagogue was created by Germans, as Jewish immigrants from Germany created Temple Adath Israel in 1838. In total, thirteen churches in Louisville specifically catered to Germans.Kleber pg.338 Germans would also be instrumental in food. Butchertown got its name for the various meat-packing companies operated there by Germans, with some in Germantown as well. The most prominent of these meat-packers would be Henry Fischer's, whose Fischer Packing Company still exists today as a popular local brand of meat. Throughout the city there were bakeries and confectioners of German heritage. The German-speaking Swiss ran the nearby dairy operations.Kleber pg.339 It was not entirely peaceful for the Germans in Louisville, particularly politically. The \\"Forty-Eighters\\", who had come to the United States due to the Revolution of 1848, and these immigrants were big believers in Marxism and atheism. Their views being so foreign to most Louisvillians caused the Bloody Monday riots of 1855, as members of the Know- Nothing Party blocked their ability to vote, creating the worst riot in Louisville history, much of it centered in Butchertown. Also, they opposed Kentucky seceding to the Confederate States of America, and their strong support of Northern causes led to the first German-born mayor of Louisville in 1865, Phillip Tomppert. Even through they were pro-Union, most Germans remained with the Democratic Party as the Republican Party had too many former Know-Nothings as its membership.Ky Modern era After 1900, German culture began to die out in Louisville, with many of the German churches switched to preaching in English rather than German. The advent of World War I increased this, forcing German names to either dropped the word \\"German\\" from their names (Germany Security Bank became Security Bank, for example), or were completely altered. Even the Louisville libraries got in the act by removing books written in German from their shelves. On March 4, 1938, the long-lasting German newspaper, Louisville Anzeiger, printed its final issue. In the 21st century, one third of Louisville's population claims German ancestry. The Kentuckiana German Heritage Society was started in 1991 to preserve Louisville's German heritage. The German-American Club Gesangverein, which was founded in 1878, also remains. Since 1977 Louisville has a maintained a relationship with Mainz, Germany, with the two cities officially town twinning in 1994. Every October a two-day Oktoberfest is celebrated.

It follows approximately the boundary between the suburbs of Homebush and Homebush West. Description Saleyards Creek has its source in the Rookwood CemeteryPowells Creek Landscape Design Framework, Volume 2. beside the suburb of Strathfield, and flows generally northward, approximately following the boundary between the suburbs of Homebush and Homebush West.Stephen Ambrose, Vertebrate Fauna Study for the Strathfield LGA, April 2009. Saleyards Creek flows through a man-made tunnel under Paddy's Markets Flemington. Emerging into daylight, it continues under Parramatta Road and the M4 Western Motorway. When driving westbound on the M4 Western Motorway it is possible to see a sign showing where Saleyards Creek flows under the motorway, not far east of Homebush Bay Drive. North of the M4 motorway, both banks of the creek are in the suburb of Homebush, and the creek finally flowing into Powells Creek at Bressington Park, at the boundary between Homebush and Concord West, which flows into Homebush Bay a short distance to the north. Saleyards Creek is now lined with concrete banks for its entire length, although the portions of the creek flowing through Airey Park and beside Bressington Park also have trees planted alongside. Since its water is largely provided by rainfall in the Sydney area, flows are reduced to little more than a trickle during dry weather. The southern part of Saleyards Creek was used as the boundary when cadastral divisions, used for land title purposes, were set down in the 19th century. As a result, the suburb of Homebush, which mostly lie east of the creek, is in the Parish of Concord, while the neighbouring suburb of Homebush West (commonly called Flemington), is in the Parish of Liberty Plains. On one definition, the creek also forms the boundary between the Inner West region of Sydney and the neighbouring region of Greater Western Sydney.

It relates the military and political careers of five graduates of the United States Naval Academy, most of whom served during the Vietnam War in either the United States Navy or United States Marine Corps: John McCain, Bud McFarlane, Oliver North, John Poindexter, and Jim Webb. Timberg himself was also a Naval Academy graduate and served in Vietnam with the Marine Corps, where he was badly wounded. The book examines how both the Annapolis and the Vietnam experiences shaped the different characters portrayed, and how it foreshadowed their political careers, and for some, their involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. The Nightingale's Song received generally strong reviews, with Geoffrey Norman in American Way stating that the individual narratives taken collectively \\"become something greater than the sum of their parts. They take the reader on an odyssey across some of the hardest terrain of recent American history.\\" The New York Times listed it as a \\"Notable Book of the Year\\" and Time magazine selected it as one of the year's five best works of nonfiction. Its sales were modest. In 1999, while Senator John McCain was campaigning for the Republican Party's nomination for president, Timberg excerpted the portions of The Nightingale's Song pertaining to McCain, augmented them with some early and recent biographical material, and put together another book, John McCain: An American Odyssey. It was in turn subsequently reissued by the Free Press in 2007, in conjunction with McCain's 2008 presidential nomination campaign, with a new foreword containing some updates on McCain in the 2000s.

It was recorded at The Power Station in New York between March and May 1980, as one of the last songs recorded for the album.Brucebase, On The Tracks: The River Originally Springsteen was going to keep the song off the album because it was so idealistic. While the album is noted for the juxtaposition of dark emotional songs (\\"The River\\", \\"Independence Day\\") and upbeat pop songs (\\"The Ties That Bind\\", \\"Hungry Heart\\"), \\"Out in the Street\\" is a mixture of both themes. Along with \\"The Ties That Bind\\" and \\"Two Hearts\\", \\"Out in the Street\\" is one of the key songs on The River about the need for community. The lyrics are reminiscent of the girl/party theme, and also evoke empathy for the blue collar working class. However, there is a sense of freedom in the chorus when the protagonist of the song leaves work and walks \\"Out in the Street.\\" The song features an echoing piano line played by Roy Bittan and also features a saxophone solo from Clarence Clemons. The final coda features weaving vocals from Springsteen, Roy Bittan, and Steven Van Zandt. For one line, Springsteen stops singing, leaving just Steven Van Zandt singing the \\"meet me out in the street\\" refrain and sounding like a plea to be met, altering the tone of the song for that moment from its otherwise assertiveness. \\"Out in the Street\\" has become a live favorite for E Street Band concerts and was performed at length during the 1999‚Äì2000 Reunion Tour, as captured on the Live in New York City album and video. During The River Tour, the vocal weaving was performed similar to the record. However, with Steve Van Zandt's absence on the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, the vocal weaving was occupied by Patti Scialfa and Nils Lofgren with Roy Bittan no longer singing. By the Reunion Tour, the vocal weaving was split between Springsteen, Van Zandt, Scialfa, Lofgren, and Clarence Clemons. Springsteen also has the audience join in.

It was established in 1920 and affiliated by International Tennis Federation and Asian Tennis Federation. All India Tennis Association operates all of the Indian national representative tennis sides, including the India Davis Cup team, the India Fed Cup team and youth sides as well. AITA is also responsible for organising and hosting tennis tournaments within India and scheduling the home international fixtures.  History  Tennis was introduced in India in the 1880s by British Army and Civilian Officers. Soon after, regular tournaments like the 'Punjab Lawn tennis Championship' at Lahore (Now in Pakistan) (1885); 'Bengal Lawn Tennis Championship' at Calcutta (1887) and the All India Tennis Championships at Allahabad in (1910) were organised. Initially the British like TD Berrington and LC Ogbourne won these championships, however slowly Indians started picking up the game. Mohd Saleem of Lahore won the Punjab Championship in 1915 and thereafter consecutively from 1919 to 1926. In 1917 NS Iyer lifted the Bengal Championship. In 1919 Mr. Nagu picked up the prestigious singles crown at the All India Tennis Championship at City's Gymkhana Club at Allahabad. Henceforth the Indians started playing the game with greater distinction. In March 1920, the All India Lawn Tennis Association was formed at Lahore. At this meeting the constitution and by laws were framed on the lines of the constitution of Lawn Tennis Association of Britain. In November 1920, the first AGM of AILTA was held at the Town Hall at Delhi. Samuel Perry O'Donnell, a British member of the Indian Civil Service (ICS) was elected as the first president. In this meeting, it was decided to hold the annual 'All India National Championships' at Allahabad and to participate in Davis Cup competition. In its debut, Indian team consisting of SM Jacob, Mohd Saleem, LS Deane and AA Fayzee upset a stronger French team to reach the semi finals. With AITA at the helm of affairs, different Provinces formed Provincial Associations (now known as State Associations and were affiliated to parent organisation. An Inter Provincial Tournament was organised with effect from 1922. Punjab LTA led by Mohd. Saleem became the first champions. This yearly competition continued till the eve of the Second World War (1939). Around the early 1980s the name of the association was changed to the 'All India Tennis Association'. From the beginning of the 1990s tennis in India has started getting a new look. The financial position of the association has improved considerably. The association constructed a full-fledged modern National Stadium at Delhi with a seating capacity of 5000 spectators in 1996.AITA History . All India Tennis Association. Retrieved on 2008-06-07.

It is based on the novel of the same name, written by Mary McNeil Fenollosa. It stars Sessue Hayakawa as a young painter who believes that his fianc√©e (played by Hayakawa's wife Tsuru Aoki), is a princess who has been captured and turned into a dragon. It was directed by William Worthington and filmed in Yosemite Valley, Yosemite National Park, California. The Dragon Painter was restored in 1988 by the American Film Institute with the George Eastman House and MoMA. In 2014, the film was added to the National Film Registry for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".  Plot  Tatsu (Hayakawa) lives within the mountains of Hakawa, Japan, creating a series of paintings and disposing of them upon completion, shouting to the gods to return his fianc√©e, a princess who he believed was turned into a dragon. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, Kano Indara (Peil, Sr.), a famous painter, seeks a protege and heir to continue the family bloodline of master paintings. Tatsu heads to a nearby village and demands some paper from the locals. His unusual behavior catches the attention of Uchida (Fujita), a surveyor and friend of Indara. While on a surveying expedition in the mountains, one of Tatsu's discarded paintings comes into Uchida's possession. Amazed at the artwork, Uchida invites Tatsu to Tokyo, claiming that Indara knows the whereabouts of the lost princess. Tatsu arrives at a dinner prepared in his honor, but his wild disposition causes a ruckus. He throws a cushion and chases off other guests. Tatsu is about to leave when Indara presents a dance by the lost princess, who he explains is in the form of his only daughter, Ume-ko (Aoki). Tatsu demands Ume-ko's hand in marriage; Indara agrees on the condition that Tatsu be his son and disciple to carry on the Indara name. Shortly after their marriage, Tatsu unable to paint, explains that ever since he found happiness, he has no reason to do so. The Indaras try to encourage Tatsu to paint but to no avail. Realizing that Tatsu's longing to find his lost princess is what granted him his ability to paint, Ume-ko tells her father that by her death, Tatsu's talent may be restored. The following morning, Tatsu discovers a letter from Ume-ko, saying that she had committed suicide in hopes that it would restore Tatsu's ability. Distraught at what has happened, Tatsu attempts suicide by drowning at a nearby waterfall, but is unsuccessful. Tatsu's sorrow continues to grow as time passes until one day he sees what appears to be Ume-ko's ghost at the family garden, which motivates him to paint once more. Tatsu's latest work gives him and the Indaras international recognition, but shortly after his success, his sorrow returns. This prompts Ume-ko, who was in hiding all the while, to return to an amazed Tatsu. The film ends with Tatsu painting in the mountains with Ume-ko by his side.  Cast  * Sessue Hayakawa as Tatsu, \\"Dragon painter\\" * Tsuru Aoki as Ume-ko * Edward Peil, Sr. as Kano Indara * Toyo Fujita as Uchida  Production  The film was produced by Hayakawa's own production company Haworth Pictures Corporation and distributed by Robertson-Cole Distributing Corporation. After Hayakawa starred in the critically and commercially successful film The Cheat, Aoki's film career was restricted to playing the love interest of Hayakawa in her future films. Aoki's off-screen image was that of a Japanese women who had adapted herself to America middle class habits. Daisuke Miyao suggests in the biography of Hayakawa Sessue Hayakawa: Silent Cinema and Transnational Stardom that the name of Piel's character might have been a mixture of names of a Japanese painter Kano and Chinese painter Indara. A print of the film was restored at the George Eastman House. In the print the hero's name is Ten- Tsuou instead of Tatsu. The film was publicized as showing the \\"exotic\\" Japan, its culture and landscape. An advertisement in Motion Picture World carried eight images of Hayakawa in kimono.  Reception  Sessue Hayakawa (left) with actress and wife Tsuru Aoki in a screen shot from the film Japanese film theorist Daisuke Miyao wrote in his book The Oxford Handbook of Japanese Cinema that \\"The Dragon Painter...a Hayakawa star vehicle...was a perfect example of Aoki providing authenticity to the Orientalist imagination of Japan.\\" He further wrote \\"Playing the role of Ume-ko, Aoki provides a sense of authenticity to the stereotypical self-sacrificing Japanese woman like Cio- Cio-San.\\" The film was praised for successfully reproducing an authentic Japanese atmosphere. However, the Japanese film magazine Kinema Jumpo noted that the film had not shown \\"either contemporary or actual Japan\\". Katsudo Kurabu, a Japanese film trade magazine, commented, \\"Even though Mr. Sessue Hayakawa took subject matter from Japan, Japanese styles and names in The Dragon Painter are very inappropriate...a film about Japan that does not properly depict Japanese customs is very hard to watch for us Japanese.\\" The Motion Picture World stated that Hayakawa had, \\"steadily advanced in popularity\\" and that several of the well known exhibitors had contracted for every collaboration between Hayakawa and Robertson-Cole. The film is regarded as the first in the series of \\"Hayakawa superior pictures\\" produced by Robertson-Cole. Margaret I. MacDonald praised the \\"authentic\\" Japanese presentation and wrote \\"one of the especially fine features of the production is the laboratory work, mountain locations of extreme beauty, chosen for the purpose of imitating Japanese scenery and supplying Japanese atmosphere, are enhanced by the splendid results accomplished, in the work of developing and toning.\\" Contemporary critics have rated the film favorably. According to New York Times review of a Hayakawa retrospective: \\"The film is a kind of visually sophisticated fairy tale, with tinting (best is the moonlit blue of the night scenes) and neatly composed interiors and silhouettes. Set in Japan with Japanese characters, The Dragon Painter, though written by an American, seems like a relic from a parallel Hollywood: one without the cultural and sexual fetishism that often characterized its forays into the exotic.\\"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E3DC143BF934A3575AC0A9619C8B63 Preservation A 35mm print was discovered in France and was restored by the American Film Institute with the George Eastman House and the Museum of Modern Art in 1988. In 2014, The Dragon Painter was deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. The restoration was supervised by Stephen Gong. In 1988, the restored print premiered in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles with a benshi narrator and traditional music. The restored film was packaged with The Wrath of the Gods (1914) on DVD in March 2008.
