It details the role of sea power during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and discussed the various factors needed to support and achieve sea power, with emphasis on having the largest and most powerful fleet. Scholars considered it the single most influential book in naval strategy. Its policies were quickly adopted by most major navies, ultimately leading to the World War I naval arms race. It is also cited as one of the contributing factors of the United States becoming a great power. Overview Mahan formulated his concept of sea power while reading a history book in Lima, Peru. The book was published by Mahan while president of the US Naval War College, and was a culmination of his ideas regarding naval warfare. Mahan began the book with an examination of what factors led to a supremacy of the seas, especially how Great Britain was able to rise to its near dominance. He identified such features as geography, population, and government, and expanded the definition of sea power as comprising a strong navy and commercial fleet. Mahan also promoted the belief that any army would succumb to a strong naval blockade.Crowl, 1986 The book then goes on to describe a series of European and American wars and how naval power was used in each. Impact on naval thought Timeliness contributed no small part to the widespread acceptance and resultant influence of Mahan's views. Although his history was relatively thin (he relied on secondary sources), the vigorous style and clear theory won widespread acceptance by navalists across the world.St. John, 1971 Sea power supported the new colonialism that Europe and Japan were imposing on Africa and Asia. Given the very rapid technological changes underway in propulsion (from coal to oil, from reciprocating engines to steam turbines), ordnance (with better fire directors, and new high explosives) and armor (hardened steel), the emergence of new craft such as destroyers and submarines, and the development of radio, Mahan's emphasis on the capital ship and the command of the sea came at an opportune moment.Patrick J. Kelly, \\"Militarism in a Global Age: Naval Ambitions in Germany and the United States before World War I.\\" German History (2013) 312 pp: 259-260. Mahan was initially introduced to the German navy by the strategist Ludwig Borckenhagen, in a series of influential papers. Subsequently, his name became a household word in the German navy, as Kaiser Wilhelm II ordered his officers to read Mahan, and Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz (1849‚Äì1930) used Mahan's reputation to build a powerful surface fleet. Mahan's ideas decisively shaped Japanese naval doctrine, especially in the fleet actions of World War II. Between 1890 and 1915, Mahan and British admiral Jacky Fisher faced the problem of how to dominate home waters and distant seas with naval forces not strong enough to do both. Mahan argued for a universal principle of concentration of powerful ships in home waters and minimized strength in distant seas, while Fisher reversed Mahan by utilizing technological change to propose submarines for defense of home waters and mobile battle cruisers for protection of distant imperial interests. The French at first adopted Mahan's theories. French naval doctrine in 1914 was dominated by Mahan's theory of sea power and therefore geared toward winning decisive battles and gaining mastery of the seas. But the course of World War I changed ideas about the place of the navy, as the refusal of the German fleet to engage in a decisive battle, the Dardanelles expedition of 1915, the development of submarine warfare, and the organization of convoys all showed the navy's new role in combined operations with the army.Crowl, 1986 The navy's part in securing victory was not fully understood by French public opinion in 1918, but a synthesis of old and new ideas arose from the lessons of the war, especially by admiral Raoul Castex (1878‚Äì1968), from 1927 to 1935, who synthesized in his five-volume Th√©ories Strat√©giques the classical and materialist schools of naval theory. He reversed Mahan's theory that command of the sea precedes maritime communications and foresaw the enlarged roles of aircraft and submarines in naval warfare. Castex enlarged strategic theory to include nonmilitary factors (policy, geography, coalitions, public opinion, and constraints) and internal factors (economy of force, offense and defense, communications, operational plans, morale, and command) to conceive a general strategy to attain final victory. Mahan's strategic theories continue to be influential into the 21st century, especially in the newly emerging naval powers India and China.David Scott, \\"India's 'grand strategy' for the Indian Ocean: Mahanian visions.\\" Asia-Pacific Review (2006) 13#2 pp: 97-129.Toshi Yoshihara and James R. Holmes. \\"Can China Defend a ‚ÄúCore Interest‚Äù in the South China Sea?.\\" The Washington Quarterly (2011) 34#2 pp: 45-59. Although Mahan's influence on foreign powers has been widely recognized, only in recent decades have scholars called attention to his role as significant in the growth of American overseas possessions, the rise of the new American navy, and the adoption of the strategic principles upon which it operated.Peter J.

It was developed by John C. Reynolds, Peter O'Hearn, Samin Ishtiaq and Hongseok Yang, drawing upon early work by Rod Burstall. The assertion language of separation logic is a special case of the logic of bunched implications (BI). A CACM review article by O'Hearn charts developments in the subject to early 2019. Overview Separation logic facilitates reasoning about: * programs that manipulate pointer data structures‚Äîincluding information hiding in the presence of pointers; * \\"transfer of ownership\\" (avoidance of semantic frame axioms); and * virtual separation (modular reasoning) between concurrent modules. Separation logic supports the developing field of research described by Peter O'Hearn and others as local reasoning, whereby specifications and proofs of a program component mention only the portion of memory used by the component, and not the entire global state of the system. Applications include automated program verification (where an algorithm checks the validity of another algorithm) and automated parallelization of software. Assertions: operators and semantics Separation logic assertions describe \\"states\\" consisting of a store and a heap, roughly corresponding to the state of local (or stack-allocated) variables and dynamically-allocated objects in common programming languages such as C and Java. A store s is a function mapping variables to values. A heap h is a partial function mapping memory addresses to values. Two heaps h and h' are disjoint (denoted h \\\\,\\\\bot\\\\, h') if their domains do not overlap (i.e., for every memory address \\\\ell, at least one of h(\\\\ell) and h'(\\\\ell) is undefined). The logic allows to prove judgements of the form s, h \\\\models P, where s is a store, h is a heap, and P is an assertion over the given store and heap. Separation logic assertions (denoted as P, Q, R) contain the standard boolean connectives and, in addition, \\\\mathbf{e}\\\\mathbf{m}\\\\mathbf{p}, e \\\\mapsto e', P \\\\ast Q, and P {-\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\ast}\\\\, Q, where e and e' are expressions. * The constant \\\\mathbf{e}\\\\mathbf{m}\\\\mathbf{p} asserts that the heap is empty, i.e., s, h \\\\models \\\\mathbf{e}\\\\mathbf{m}\\\\mathbf{p} when h is undefined for all addresses. * The binary operator \\\\mapsto takes an address and a value and asserts that the heap is defined at exactly one location, mapping the given address to the given value. I.e., s, h \\\\models e \\\\mapsto e' when h([\\\\\\\\![e]\\\\\\\\!]_{s}) = [\\\\\\\\![e']\\\\\\\\!]_{s} (where [\\\\\\\\![e]\\\\\\\\!]_{s} denotes the value of expression e evaluated in store s) and h is otherwise undefined. * The binary operator \\\\ast (pronounced star or separating conjunction) asserts that the heap can be split into two disjoint parts where its two arguments hold, respectively. I.e., s, h \\\\models P \\\\ast Q when there exist h_1, h_2 such that h_1 \\\\,\\\\bot\\\\, h_2 and h = h_1 \\\\cup h_2 and s, h_1 \\\\models P and s, h_2 \\\\models Q. * The binary operator -\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\ast (pronounced magic wand or separating implication) asserts that extending the heap with a disjoint part that satisfies its first argument results in a heap that satisfies its second argument. I.e,. s, h \\\\models P -\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\ast\\\\, Q when for every heap h' \\\\,\\\\bot\\\\, h such that s, h' \\\\models P, also s, h \\\\cup h' \\\\models Q holds. The operators \\\\ast and -\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\ast share some properties with the classical conjunction and implication operators. They can be combined using an inference rule similar to modus ponens :\\\\frac{s, h \\\\models P \\\\ast (P -\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\ast\\\\, Q)}{s, h \\\\models Q} and they form an adjunction, i.e., s, h \\\\cup h' \\\\models P \\\\ast Q \\\\Rightarrow R if and only if s, h \\\\models P \\\\Rightarrow Q -\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\ast\\\\, R for h \\\\,\\\\bot\\\\, h'; more precisely, the adjoint operators are \\\\\\\\_ \\\\ast Q and Q -\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\ast\\\\, \\\\\\\\_. Reasoning about programs: triples and proof rules In separation logic, Hoare triples have a slightly different meaning than in Hoare logic. The triple \\\\\\\\{P\\\\\\\\}\\\\ C\\\\ \\\\\\\\{Q\\\\\\\\} asserts that if the program C executes from an initial state satisfying the precondition P then the program will not go wrong (e.g., have undefined behaviour), and if it terminates, then the final state will satisfy the postcondition Q. In essence, during its execution, C may access only memory locations whose existence is asserted in the precondition or that have been allocated by C itself. In addition to the standard rules from Hoare logic, separation logic supports the following very important rule: \\\\frac{ \\\\\\\\{P\\\\\\\\}\\\\ C\\\\ \\\\\\\\{Q\\\\\\\\} }{ \\\\\\\\{P \\\\ast R\\\\\\\\}\\\\ C\\\\ \\\\\\\\{Q \\\\ast R\\\\\\\\} }~\\\\mathsf{mod}(C) \\\\cap \\\\mathsf{fv}(R) =\\\\emptyset This is known as the frame rule (named after the frame problem) and enables local reasoning. It says that a program that executes safely in a small state (satisfying P), can also execute in any bigger state (satisfying P \\\\ast R) and that its execution will not affect the additional part of the state (and so R will remain true in the postcondition). The side condition enforces this by specifying that none of the variables modified by C occur free in R, i.e. none of them are in the 'free variable' set \\\\mathsf{fv} of R.  Sharing  Separation logic leads to simple proofs of pointer manipulation for data structures that exhibit regular sharing patterns which can be described simply using separating conjunctions; examples include singly and doubly linked lists and varieties of trees. Graphs and DAGs and other data structures with more general sharing are more difficult for both formal and informal proof. Separation logic has, nonetheless, been applied successfully to reasoning about programs with general sharing. In their POPL'01 paper, O'Hearn and Ishtiaq explained how the magic wand connective {-\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!*} could be used to reason in the presence of sharing, at least in principle. For example, in the triple \\\\\\\\{(x \\\\mapsto -) \\\\ast ((x \\\\mapsto 42) {-\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!*} P)\\\\\\\\}\\\\ [x] = 42\\\\ \\\\\\\\{P\\\\\\\\} we obtain the weakest precondition for a statement that mutates the heap at location x , and this works for any postcondition, not only one that is laid out neatly using the separating conjunction. This idea was taken much further by Yang, who used {-\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!*} to provide localized reasoning about mutations in the classic Schorr-Waite graph marking algorithm. Finally, one of the most recent works in this direction is that of Hobor and Villard, who employ not only {-\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!*} but also a connective \\\\cup \\\\,\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!* which has variously been called overlapping conjunction or sepish, and which can be used to describe overlapping data structures: P \\\\cup \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!* Q holds of a heap h when P and Q hold for subheaps h_P and h_Q whose union is h, but which possibly have a nonempty portion h_P \\\\cap h_Q in common. Abstractly, P \\\\cup \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!* Q can be seen to be a version of the fusion connective of relevance logic. Concurrent separation logic A Concurrent Separation Logic (CSL), a version of separation logic for concurrent programs, was originally proposed by Peter O'Hearn, using a proof rule : \\\\frac{\\\\\\\\{P_1\\\\\\\\} C_1 \\\\\\\\{Q_1\\\\\\\\} \\\\quad \\\\\\\\{P_2\\\\\\\\} C_2 \\\\\\\\{Q_2\\\\\\\\}}{\\\\\\\\{P_1 * P_2\\\\\\\\} C_1 \\\\parallel C_2 \\\\\\\\{Q_1 * Q_2\\\\\\\\}} which allows independent reasoning about threads that access separate storage. O'Hearn's proof rules adapted an early approach of Tony Hoare to reasoning about concurrency, replacing the use of scoping constraints to ensure separation by reasoning in separation logic. In addition to extending Hoare's approach to apply in the presence of heap-allocated pointers, O'Hearn showed how reasoning in concurrent separation logic could track dynamic ownership transfer of heap portions between processes; examples in the paper include a pointer-transferring buffer, and a memory manager. A model for concurrent separation logic was first provided by Stephen Brookes in a companion paper to O'Hearn's. The soundness of the logic had been a difficult problem, and in fact a counterexample of John Reynolds had shown the unsoundness of an earlier, unpublished version of the logic; the issue raised by Reynolds's example is described briefly in O'Hearn's paper, and more thoroughly in Brookes's. At first it appeared that CSL was well suited to what Dijkstra had called loosely connected processes, (September 1965) but perhaps not to fine-grained concurrent algorithms with significant interference. However, gradually it was realized that the basic approach of CSL was considerably more powerful than first envisaged, if one employed non-standard models of the logical connectives and even the Hoare triples. An abstract version of separation logic was proposed that works for Hoare triples where the preconditions and postconditions are formulae interpreted over an arbitrary partial commutative monoid instead of a particular heap model. Later, by suitable choice of commutative monoid, it was surprisingly found that the proof rules of abstract versions of concurrent separation logic could be used to reason about interfering concurrent processes, for example by encoding the rely-guarantee technique which had been originally proposed to reason about interference; in this work the elements of the model were considered not resources, but rather \\"views\\" of the program state, and a non- standard interpretation of Hoare triples accompanies the non-standard reading of pre and postconditions. Finally, CSL-style principles have been used to compose reasoning about program histories instead of program states, in order to provide modular techniques for reasoning about fine-grained concurrent algorithms. Versions of CSL have been included in many interactive and semi- automatic (or \\"in-between\\") verification tools as described in the next section. A particularly significant verification effort is that of the ŒºC/OS- II kernel mentioned there. But, although steps have been made, as of yet CSL- style reasoning has been included in comparatively few tools in the automatic program analysis category (and none mentioned in the next section). O'Hearn and Brookes are co-recipients of the 2016 G√∂del Prize for their invention of Concurrent Separation Logic.https://www.eatcs.org/index.php/component/content/article/1-news/2280-2016-godel- prize- Verification and program analysis tools Tools for reasoning about programs fall on a spectrum from fully automatic program analysis tools, which do not require any user input, to interactive tools where the human is intimately involved in the proof process. Many such tools have been developed; the following list includes a few representatives in each category. *Automatic Program Analyses. These tools typically look for restricted classes of bugs (e.g., memory safety errors) or attempt to prove their absence, but fall short of proving full correctness. ** A current example is Facebook Infer, a static analysis tool for Java, C, and Objective-C based on separation logic and bi- abduction.Separation logic and bi-abduction, page, Infer project site.

Proofs have been done using embeddings of Separation Logic into interactive theorem provers such as the Coq proof assistant and HOL (proof assistant). In comparison to the program analysis work, these tools require more in the way of human effort but prove deeper properties, up to functional correctness. ** A proof of the FSCQ file systemUsing Crash Hoare Logic for Certifying the FSCQ File System, H Chen et al, SOSP'15 where the specification includes behaviour under crashes as well as normal operation.

Many tools require more user intervention than program analyses, in that they expect the user to input assertions such as pre/post specs for functions or loop invariants, but after this input is given they attempt to be fully or almost fully automatic; this mode of verification goes back to classic works in the 1970s such as J King's verifier, and the Stanford Pascal Verifier. This style of verifier has recently been called auto active verification, a term which intends to evoke the way of interacting with a verifier via an assert-check loop, analogous to the interaction between a programmer and a type-checker. ** The very first Separation Logic verifier, Smallfoot, was in this in-between category. It required the user to input pre/post specs, loop invariants, and resource invariants for locks. It introduced a method of symbolic execution, as well as an automatic way to infer frame axioms. Smallfoot included Concurrent Separation Logic. ** SmallfootRG is a verifier for a marriage of separation logic and the classic rely/guarantee method for concurrent programs. ** Heap Hop implements a separation logic for message passing, following the ideas in Singularity (operating system). ** Verifast is an advanced current tool in the in-between category. It has demonstrated proofs ranging from object-oriented patterns to highly concurrent algorithms and to systems programs. ** The Mezzo Programming Language and Asynchronous Liquid Separation Types include ideas related to CSL in the type system for a programming language. The idea to include separation in a type system has earlier examples in Alias Types and Syntactic Control of Interference. The distinction between interactive and in-between verifiers is not a sharp one. For example, Bedrock strives for a high degree of automation, in what it terms mostly-automatic verification, where Verifast sometimes requires annotations that resemble the tactics (little programs) used in interactive verifiers.

He was appointed the first ever President of the Local Government Board in 1871, an office he held until 1874 and again briefly in 1886. Background and education He was born at Akeds Road, Halifax, the only son of James Stansfeld (1792‚Äì1872), originally a member of a firm of solicitors, Stansfeld & Craven, and subsequently county-court judge in the district. His mother was Emma, daughter of John Ralph, minister of the Northgate-End Unitarian chapel, Halifax, and his sister married George Dixon. Brought up as a nonconformist, Stansfeld was in 1837 sent to University College, London, and graduated B.A. in 1840 and LL.B. in 1844. He was admitted a student of the Middle Temple on 31 October 1840, and was called to the bar on 26 January 1849; he does not seem, however, to have practised as a barrister, and later in life derived his income mainly from a brewery at Fulham. On 27 July 1844 Stansfeld married Caroline, second daughter of William Henry Ashurst, a radical and friend of Giuseppe Mazzini, to whom Stansfeld was introduced in 1847: they became close. Stansfeld also sympathised with the Chartist movement, even if Feargus O'Connor denounced him. He also took an active part in propagating radical opinions in the north of England, frequently spoke at meetings of the Northern Reform Union, and was one of the promoters of the association for the repeal of \\"taxes on knowledge\\". Political career In 1859, Stansfeld was returned to Parliament as Radical member for Halifax, which he continued to represent for over thirty-six years. He voted consistently on the Radical side, but his chief energies were devoted to promoting the cause of Italian unity. He was selected by Giuseppe Garibaldi as his adviser when the Italian patriot visited England in 1862. In 1863, he moved in the House of Commons a resolution of sympathy with the Poles, and two months later was made Civil Lord of the Admiralty. In 1864, as the result of charges made against him by the French authorities, in connection with Greco's conspiracy against Napoleon III, Disraeli, in the House of Commons, accused him of \\"being in correspondence with the assassins of Europe.\\" Stansfeld was vigorously defended by John Bright and William Edward Forster, and his explanation was accepted as quite satisfactory by Palmerston. Nevertheless, he only escaped a vote of censure by ten votes, and accordingly resigned office. In 1865, he was re-elected for Halifax, and in 1866 became Under-Secretary of State for India under Lord Russell. He served in the first William Gladstone administration of 1868 to 1874 as a Lord of the Treasury between 1868 and 1869, as Financial Secretary to the Treasury between 1869 and 1871 and as President of the Poor Law Board (with a seat in the cabinet) in 1871, before being appointed the first President of the Local Government Board, in 1871, a post he held until the Liberals lost power in 1874. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1869. The remainder of his life was mainly spent in endeavouring to secure the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts, and in 1886 this object was attained. He did not serve in Gladstone's 1880 to 1885 administration, but returned to the government in April 1886, when he again became President of the Local Government Board under Gladstone. However, the government fell in July of the same year. Personal life He died at his residence, Castle Hill, Rotherfield, Sussex, on 17 February 1898, and was buried at Rotherfield on the 22nd, aged 77.

He spent six seasons at the 'Ton, and was in the side that won promotion to Scottish Division One in 1928‚Äì29. In May 1933 he was signed by Arsenal, initially as cover for Frank Moss. He made his debut against Aston Villa on 10 March 1934 after Moss picked up an injury; Arsenal won 3‚Äì2.

Moss's injury did not heal and Wilson found himself as the Gunners' No. 1 throughout the 1935‚Äì36 season; he played 43 matches that season and kept goal in that season's FA Cup final against Sheffield United, which Arsenal won 1‚Äì0 thanks to a Ted Drake goal. However, Wilson's performances were not strong enough for manager George Allison's liking, and Arsenal signed not one but two goalkeepers that summer, George Swindin and Frank Boulton.

He looked to have become the club's third-choice goalkeeper; nevertheless he stayed on, and after Boulton was sold in 1938 Wilson and Swindin shared the goalkeeper's jersey for 1938‚Äì39, with both men playing in 22 matches that season. World War II then intervened, and competitive football was halted. Wilson returned to Scotland in 1939, joining St Mirren. In all he played 90 matches for Arsenal. He later had a brief spell at Brighton and Hove Albion, playing a single Third Division South match in 1947‚Äì48.Brighton & Hove Albion: 1946/47 - 2013/14, Post War English & Scottish Football League A - Z Player's Transfer Database After retiring from playing, Wilson pursued a career as a trainer and physiotherapist, starting out at Brighton before going to work for Birmingham City, Sunderland and Blackpool, as well as Kent County Cricket Club. He emigrated to the United States in 1967 and worked as a physio for the Boston Beacons of the NASL. He died in March 1971, aged 62.

Varenne is considered to be the best trotter of all time. No other trotter has won so many of the most important races in the world and set as many records as Varenne. Overview According to several veterinarians, Varenne would never race due to a leg malformation. His first owner bought him for $6000, but because of his perceived handicap (chip) sold him after the first race, considering him to have no future as a race horse. Varenne won 62 races (53 GPs-major races) at 11 distances (from 0,99 mile to 1,708 miles), while finishing second six times and third twice from 73 career starts. He earned US$8,750,000 (‚Ç¨6,035,665), a harness-racing record. Varenne holds the record as the most widely traveled horse in the history of horse racing, winning in 7 countries and on two continents. He is the sole European trotter to win the Breeders Crown (2001) in the U.S.A.,Varenne won ‚Ç¨ 6,035,665. In the conversion to USD, the rates of 2002-08-22, the date of Varenne's last race, has been used. where he set the world speed record ( 1 mile in 1.51.1 - average per kilometer 1.09.1). It was the first time he competed at the distance of 1 mile. Another historical victory took place at the World Cup 2002 in Vincennes, where Varenne won even though the wheel of the sulky was broken, setting the world speed record of 2100 metres (unbeaten record 1.10.8 average per kilometer - track 1 kilometer). In Finland on 14 July 2002, in \\"St. Michel Race\\" (Mikkeli), in front of 27,000 spectators, Varenne established the world speed record of 1.09.3 on 1000 metres tracks (includes 3 turns in comparison to American one- mile tracks with just two turns). This was his only race in Finland, the home country of his trainer, Jori Turja and keeper, Miss Iina Rastas. The owner of Varenne had earlier promised Turja that he could take Varenne to race in Finland once. In May 2002 in the Elitlopp, Varenne won in a world record time of 1:53.1 in the elimination and then bested that mark by winning the final in 1:53 ‚Äì the fastest mile so far (until St. Michel in Finland in July 2002) trotted around three turns (unbeaten record). He is the first foreign horse to win the Horse of the Year award in the U.S and the only foreign horse to win the Horse of the Year award in France, as well as the only horse to win Horse of the Year in 3 different countries, all in the same year (2001). Varenne has established numerous track records on various racetracks. He won the Prix d'Am√©rique twice (2001‚Äì2002), considered to be the most difficult race in harness racing (2700 meters / 1.708 miles - 18 starters). His most prestigious victories include the Prix d'Am√©rique, Elitloppet, Gran Premio della Lotteria and Breeders Crown. He is the only horse to win the most important races in the same year (2001). Varenne won prestigious races around the world, beating champions including Moni Maker (3 times), Magician (1 time), G√©n√©ral du Pommeau (4 times), Fan Idole (5 times), Victory Tilly (4 times), Viking Kronos (1 time), Fool's Goal (1 time), Dream Vacation (2 times), Plesac (1 time). In 2010, Varenne was inducted into the Harness Racing Museum & Hall of Fame in New York, an honor typically restricted to American horses only. In May 2011, Kanal 75, the Swedish company that broadcasts harness racing on TV4 Sport in Sweden, asked 38 international media to name the best horse of all time. Varenne came out on top. Known in Italy as \\"Il Capitano\\" (the Captain), he was the only animal in history with a press office staff. Thousands of gadgets, T-shirts and hats were produced in his name. For a number of months, the Italian cities were covered with giant posters depicting Varenne, and millions of Italians followed his victories on live television. His vet called him an \\"intelligent horse with incredible patience.‚Äù Varenne also raised money for disabled children. The proceeds of his 2002 victory at the ‚ÄúPremio Mario Locatelli‚Äù went entirely to charity for the Carlo Gnocchi Italian center. These proceeds helped complete the project on \\"Cascina Linterno\\" in Milan that provided a range of services for people with disabilities, including an equestrian facility for the rehabilitation of people with physical and mental disabilities, through horse therapy. Early life Varenne, the offspring of American stallion Waikiki Beach and Italian mare Ialmaz, was born at Zenzalino horse breeding centre in Copparo, Italy, on May 19, 1995. The foal was named after the street Rue de Varenne, where the Italian embassy in Paris is located. Breeder of Varenne - Jean-Pierre Dubois, a successful French horseman - brought him to Normandy, France. After the stay in France, Varenne returned to Italy. Racing career 1998 As a three-year-old, Varenne began his racing career in Premio Primavalle in Bologna on April 4. His driver was his early trainer, Swedish Roger Grundin, but Varenne was disqualified. The second attempt was more successful. With Italian driver Giampaolo Minnucci, Varenne won Premio Mirtillo at Tor di Valle, Rome, on April 30. In October, he won the Italian trotting derby (Italian: Derby Italiano del Trotto), which was his most lucrative victory until Prix d'Am√©rique in early 2001. Varenne ended 1998 by finishing third in Gran Premio Orsi Mangelli. In his first year on the track, he won 8 of 12 races. In 1998, Dubois sold his share in Varenne to Italian stockbroker Vincenzo \\"Enzo\\" Giordano for ‚Ç¨50,000. Varenne also switched trainera to Finnish-born and Italy-based Jori Turja. Turja, as well as driver Minnucci, remained Varenne's partner for the remainder of the horse's career. 1999 In 1999, Varenne had a perfect record: 14 wins out of 14 starts. He won Gran Premio d'Europa, Gran Premio Tino Triossi and Gran Premio Continentale, all major races in his native Italy. In the fall of that year, the stallion for the first time raced outside his home country. In October, at the Daglfing track in Munich, Germany, Varenne won Preis der Besten against older and more experienced competitors. After the win in Gran Premio delle Nazioni at San Siro, Milan, Turja and company again turned their attention abroad. On December 26, Varenne wrapped up his four-year-old season by winning Prix Ariste H√©mard at Vincennes, Paris. 2000 On January 30, 2000, Varenne made his first attempt to win Prix d'Am√©rique at Vincennes. He finished 3rd behind French horses General du Pommeau and Galopin du Ravary. In May, on his first try, he won Gran Premio della Lotteria, the biggest international Italian race. Later that month, he failed to win perhaps the most prestigious one-mile harness race in Europe - Elitloppet at Solvalla in Stockholm, Sweden. 18 races in 2000 meant 13 wins, including the European 5-year-old Championship, Olympiatravet, Gran Premio Giubileo and Gran Premio Gaetano Turilli. During the year, Varenne won World Cup Trot, a competition stretching over a number of races. He repeated the feat two years later. 2001 In 2001, Varenne took all of the top three aged harness events in Europe, as well as the biggest one in North America. It started with a victory in Prix d'Am√©rique on January 28. Varenne took the lead early in the race and maintained that position all the way. After a couple of smaller wins, he again took Gran Premio della Lotteria in Naples on May 6. Three weeks later, he defeated the reigning champion in Elitloppet, Victory Tilly, although he was parked for most of the race. Varenne suffered his only loss of the year to Jackhammer in Gran Premio U.N.I.R.E in Milan. After returning to his winning ways in Elite-Rennen at Gelsenkirchen, Germany, Varenne crossed the Atlantic for his first journey to North America. The first stop was Meadowlands Racetrack, New Jersey, and the biggest aged harness event in North America: the $1 million Breeders Crown Open Trot on July 28. After Varenne's sweep of the three greatest European races (he was the first horse to accomplish this in 34 years) the expectations were enormous. The competition consisted of some of the best American trotters, e.g. Dream Vacation, Plesac, Fool's Goal, and Magician. Varenne advanced to the lead, but Minnucci let John Campbell and Dream Vacation overtake them. Varenne was then parked outside Dream Vacation, and in the stretch, he left the opponents far behind. The winning margin was 4 ¬Ω lengths, and with the time of 1:51.1m (European way of timing: 1:09.1m km rate), Varenne beat Self Possessed's one-mile world record by two tenths of a second. After the success, Varenne was intended to race at Meadowlands again, this time in the Nat Ray Trot. This was nit the case, and he did not make an appearance until September 22, when he won the Trot Mondial in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. In December, Varenne rounded off the year with two wins in Italy. Out of the 14 races Varenne and Minnucci participated in, they were victorious in 13. 2002 In 2001, Varenne was the first horse in 34 years to win the Prix d'Am√©rique, Gran Premio della Lotteria, and Elitloppet in the same year. In 2002, he became the first to win the triple two years in a row. Varenne took the lead at an early stage in Prix d'Am√©rique in 2002 and grabbed the second biggest prize cheque of his career: ‚Ç¨400,000. In Gran Premio Mario Locatelli at San Siro, Milan, for the first time since his debut, Varenne was driven by a driver other than Minnucci. Finnish Jorma Kontio was chosen and won. After wins in Gran Premio Mario Locatelli, Grand Criterium de Vitesse and Olympiatravet, Varenne and Minnucci beat the event record in Gran Premio della Lotteria with the time of 1:10.8 (km rate). Elitloppet on May 26 meant another defended title and another event record (1:10.2 km rate). Thereafter, the people around Varenne focused their attention to the World Cup Trot. If one horse won all five legs of the world cup, a massive bonus (‚Ç¨1 million) would be paid. The first leg was Gran Premio U.N.I.R.E, the second leg was Hugo √Öbergs Memorial at J√§gersro in Malm√∂, Sweden, the third leg was Jubileumspokalen at Solvalla, Stockholm, and the fourth leg was Coupe du Monde de Trot at Vincennes, Paris. Varenne and Minnucci won all of these races. In between, Varenne won the St. Michel Race in Mikkeli, Finland. With the time 1:09.3 (km rate), he set a new world record on a 1000m track, a record that stood for 10 years. Combined with the world record set in the Breeders Crown the previous year, Varenne was the world record holder on a mile track as well as on a 1000m track. Before Trot Mondial in Montreal, reports appeared, saying the up-coming race would be Varenne's last. The event took place on September 28, 2002. Varenne and Minnucci faced, among others, American Fool's Goal and French mare Fan Idole. Varenne had the lead but was passed by Fan Idole in the stretch and finished second. After the race, Varenne was disqualified for running inside the pylons. Before the race, it seemed, according to Varenne's groom Iina Rastas, that Fan Idole got taken with Varenne. When Fan Idole in 2004 was retired from racing, Varenne was chosen to be her first stud. Despite rumours of a comeback, Trot Mondial was Varenne's last race. He ended his career by being disqualified, just as he had started it almost four and half years earlier, the only two races he finished outside the money. The 15 races and 14 wins in 2002 took Varennes' tally up to 62 career victories, 6 seconds, and 2 thirds from 73 starts. With US$5,919,961 (‚Ç¨6,035,665) earned, Varenne is the richest trotter ever. Awards and recognition Varenne was named the Horse of the Year in Italy 2000, 2001, and 2002 and received the same award in France in 2001, 2002, and in USA 2001. Harness Racing Museum & Hall of Fame in New York. Career as a sire From 2003, when Varenne started his breeding career, until 2008, he stood at Allevamento Il Grifone in his homeland Italy. His first foal, delivered by the mare Vendee on January 5, 2004, was a colt named Icaro del Ronco. During the four years at Allevamento Il Grifone, Varenne sired between 126 and 168 foals per year. Among the offspring born 2004-2005 are Swedish star mare Lie Detector (SEK 4 886 131) with several wins in classic races to her name. Italian mare Lana Del Rio has won a number of Group 1 races, e.g. Gran Premio Nazionale. Lord Capar (Sweden/Italy) and Southwind Serena (USA) are two other successful trotters sired by Varenne. In 2008, Varenne was moved to Menhammar Stuteri outside Stockholm, Sweden, where Varenne's stands for c. ‚Ç¨750 (insemination) + ‚Ç¨15,000 (live foal). Menhammar veterinarian Johan Hellander, claims that Varenne is \\"a marvellous stud stallion\\" that \\"does exactly what you ask him to\\" and that Varenne's service would be more expensive if he were not so fertile. Pedigree *Varenne is inbred 3x3 to Speedy Crown, meaning that the stallion appears twice in the third generation of his pedigree. He is also inbred 4x4x4 to Star's Pride.

London: University of California Press, p. 158. While at Berkeley, Enloe was the first woman ever to be a Head TA for Aaron Wildavsky, then an up-and-coming star in the field of American Politics. For much of her professional life she taught at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. At Clark, Enloe served as Chair of the Department of Political Science and as Director of Women's Studies. She also served on the university's Committee on Personnel and its Planning and Budget Review Committee. Enloe was awarded Clark University's Outstanding Teacher Award on three separate occasions.\\"Faculty Biography.\\" Cynthia Enloe Ph.D. N.p., n.d. Web. September 27, 2016. At the beginning of her career, Enloe mainly focused on studying ethnic and racial politics. She completed her dissertation in Malaysia on a Fulbright Scholarship from 1965-1966. There, she researched the country's ethnic politics. Ten years after receiving her PhD, Enloe had written six books on the subject of ethnical tensions and its role in politics, however she had yet to look at any of these subjects from a feminist angle; something she admits she is ‚Äúembarrassed of.‚Äù Lacey, Anita, and Thomas Gregory. \\"Twenty-five Years of Bananas, Beaches and Bases: A Conversation with Cynthia Enloe.\\" N.p., Aug. 2016. Web. 27 Sept. 2016. It wasn't until she first began teaching at Clark University, in the middle of the U.S.-Vietnam war, that Enloe really began to develop her feminist thought. Enloe spoke with a colleague at Clark, the only man on the faculty who was a veteran, about his experiences during the Vietnam war. He mentioned that Vietnamese women were hired by American soldiers to do their laundry. She began to wonder how history would be different if the entire war had been told through the eyes of these Vietnamese women. Ever since, Enloe's work has primarily focused upon how feminist and gendered politics have shaped the national and international conversations. Enloe focuses on the unfair treatment of women in globalized factory and the many ways in which women are exploited for their labor. She also critiques global as well as U.S. militarization, specifically the roles women play in combat. Enloe isn't afraid to address security from a feminist perspective. She argues that the U.S. military model trains men to be the protectors of women and then produces an environment in which women are the victims of physical violence.Van Hook, Stephanie. \\"Taking Women's Lives Seriously - an Interview with Cynthia Enloe - Waging Nonviolence.\\" Waging Nonviolence Taking Women's Lives Seriously an Interview with Cynthia Enloe Comments. N.p., September 13, 2012. Web. September 27, 2016. One of Enloe's many contributions to feminist writings has been her coining of the term ‚Äúfeminist curiosity.‚Äù It came about in 2003 when Enloe was giving a talk at Ochanomizu University, a historic women's university in Tokyo. She has said that she wanted to come up with a phrase that she felt could be understood in both English and Japanese as her lecture was being translated for those who attended. Enloe created this idea of ‚Äúfeminist curiosity‚Äù as a way of saying that feminism is about the questions you ask, not just the answers you give. Having retired from Clark, Enloe is a research professor in the Department of International Development, Community, and Environment and is still a frequent and energetic lecturer. In addition to serving on the editorial board for scholarly journals such as Signs and the International Feminist Journal of Politics, Cynthia Enloe has written fifteen books, mostly published by the University of California Press.Clark University Faculty Biography: Cynthia Enloe, Clark University Much of Enloe's research centers on women's place in national and international politics. Her books cover a wide range of issues encompassing gender-based discrimination as well as racial, ethnic, and national identities. She is also a member of the academic network of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.Cynthia Enloe's Report from The Syrian Peace Talks, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom January 30, 2014. Enloe states that she has been influenced by many other feminists who use an ethnographic approach, specifically, Seung-Kyung Kim's (1997) work on South Korean women factory workers during the pro-democracy campaign and Anne Allison's (1994) work on observing corporate businessmen's interactions with hostesses in a Tokyo drinking club. Enloe has also listed Diane Singerman, Purnima Mankekar, and Cathy Lutz as people who have inspired and influenced her work. When asked how Enloe defines feminism for herself, she stated that \\"Feminism is the pursuit of deep, deep justice for women in ways that change the behaviors of both women and men, and really change our notions of what justice looks like.\\" Van Hook, Stephanie. \\"Taking Women's Lives Seriously - an Interview with Cynthia Enloe - Waging Nonviolence.\\" Waging Nonviolence Taking Women's Lives Seriously an Interview with Cynthia Enloe Comments.

She currently lives in Boston with partner Joni Seager. Important writings  The Curious Feminist  Enloe pays particular attention to the effect of globalization on women's labor and wage ratios. This book not only addresses women's roles in economic markets, world conflicts, and power politics, but also shows Enloe's particular interest in linking these themes to women's everyday lives. She addresses themes similar to those in Bananas, Beaches and Bases, but in this book she also discusses how she became interested in becoming a feminist. She asserts that curiosity as a feminist means that no woman's life should be beyond the scope of her interest. She also focuses on the influence of American culture on women of other nations and scrutinizes the masculine aspects of such well-established organizations as the United Nations and the American military. Among other things, she explains that, though she views violence as fundamentally masculine, she does not view only men as perpetrators of violence.Enloe, The Curious Feminist, p. 133.  Bananas, Beaches, and Bases  Bananas, Beaches, and BasesEnloe, Cynthia. 2000. Bananas, Beaches and Bases: Making Feminist Sense of International Politics. Berkeley: University of California Press. presents sexism as a prevalent issue and gives readers a look at the history of such commonplace components of the modern world as the tourism industry. Enloe displays the links between women of different cultures during the 1800s. Enloe discusses colonialism in light of the typically held perceptions of the masculine West and the feminine East. Discussing women from varied cultures, Enloe investigates how Muslim women, among others, felt compelled to validate their cultural practices in the face of Orientalism. This book argues that lack of understanding of foreign cultures and fascination with the differences in clothing and lifestyles of indigenous and colonial populations contributed to their continued subjugation. Bananas Beaches and Bases conveys the issues that feminist movements face because of nationalism and socially instilled masculinity after years of Western colonialism. International politics have worked against feminist movements because of the long lasting influences of colonialism. The antiquated ideas of colonialism have complicated the goals of the feminist cause. Colonialism encouraged Western countries to believe they were superior to non Western countries, ultimately leading to Western men believing they were superior to women. During Western colonialism women were treated as sexual symbols of exploration, postcards specifically. Westerner exploration and tourism went hand in hand with the exploitation of women.Cock, Jacklyn. Agenda: Empowering Women for Gender Equity 11 (1991): 90-91. Web. Women who were invested in the ideas of nationalism were not valued as valid participants. Additionally, women wearing veils became a question of nationalism. European colonizers saw the veil in Muslim countries as a symbol of female seclusion. Then arose the question of whether Muslim women should demonstrate their commitment to the nationalist cause by wearing the veil or throwing it away. Bananas Beaches and Bases reinforces the fact that masculinity has been used to create a patriarchal system, leading to male dominance over women. Militarization during wartime has reinforced masculinized social order. The war in Vietnam which re-masculinized America serves as an example of how gender and warfare became intertwined through specific gender roles during war.Stiehm, Judith Hicks. Signs 17.4 (1992): 825‚Äì29. Web. In her writing, Enloe uses Afghanistan as an example of how national militarization was harmful towards women trying to establish a presence in nationalist movements. Afghani women living in rural communities were caught in war and were in danger of bombings or exile. The militarization in Afghanistan emphasized the importance of unity and ‚Äúnational survival‚Äù, this emphasis silenced women in the nationalist movements. National militarization benefited men and oppressed women who were seeking to change the patriarchal structure in place. The enforcement of world order through militarization consequently reinforced the influences of masculinity, further challenging feminist efforts to equalize society. Enloe continues to illustrate the struggle that feminist movements face in international politics through the domestic service industry. Enloe states that ‚Äúdomestic work is international business with political implications.‚Äù During the Industrial Revolution, female domestic workers were in high demand because middle class women believed they needed to protect their own femininity from manual labor. From the time of the Industrial Revolution to modern day, female domestic workers have faced the challenges of being treated as subordinate to the middle class. Female domestic workers continue to have the responsibility of providing for family abroad while facing increasingly strict immigration laws and restrictions from the International Monetary Fund.Enloe, Cynthia H. \\"Nationalism and Masculinity & \\"Just Like One of The Family\\": Domestic Servants In World Politics.\\" Bananas, Beaches & Bases: Making Feminist Sense of International Politics. Berkeley: U of California, 1990. 42+. Print. Bananas Beaches and Bases illustrates how feminist movements have been at a disadvantage because of colonial influences and patriarchal driven societal structures. These colonial influences have cause women to be viewed as sexual objects, disregarded as part of nationalist movements and looked down upon in the domestic service industry. Enloe brings to light the idea that in order for feminist movements to succeed we must support organizations seeking rights for women along with ridding the world of the obsolete colonialist thought in which men run the world. Through Bananas, Beaches and Bases the public is able to better understand the dynamics of sexual politics. \\"No commentator has done more than Cynthia Enloe to explore the numerous roles that ordinary women play in the international system and global political economy -- as industrial and domestic workers; activists; diplomats and soldiers; wives of diplomats and soldiers; sex workers; and much else besides,\\" wrote Adam Jones in his review of Maneuvers in the journal Contemporary Politics.Adam Jones, Maneuvers: The International Politics of Militarizing Women's Lives, by Cynthia Enloe (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000), Contemporary Politics, 7: 2 (2001), pp. 171‚Äì75. In Maneuvers: The International Politics of Militarizing Women's Lives Enloe elaborates upon the theme of militarization and how governments utilize women's labor in the process of preparing for and fighting wars.Enloe, Cynthia. 2000. Maneuvers: The International Politics of Militarizing Women's Lives. London: University of California Press, p. 33.  \\"Gender\\" Is Not Enough: The Need for Feminist Consciousness  In \\"Gender\\" Is Not Enough: The Need for Feminist Consciousness, Enloe reviews previous conversations with colleagues and fellow feminists, regarding masculinity and international relations. It is mentioned that women are generally disengaged in the UN's wartime peace process of \\"DDR\\": disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. Enloe comments on a recent meeting she attended pertaining to 'gender and small arms trade', and how attempts to focus the UN gathering on masculinity had been largely unsuccessful. The matter of international relations and masculinity is addressed, and with that, the concern of masculinity of peacemaking efforts in relation to security. Conversation about the politics of masculinity is quickly dismissed by delegates, suggesting the fear of having their masculinity ‚Äì and therefore reputation in the world of international relations ‚Äì examined. As important as it is to address the dynamics of masculinity in politics and specifically in international relations, it is also crucial not to neglect the women and girls. When masculinity is given proper thought, it seems the topic of feminism becomes non-existent. The invisibility of women in military measures and the political disregard for the needs and ideas of women and girls are highlighted and given proper context. Enloe discusses the question of serious feminist analysis in international relations. Two potential fears arise from this question; first, thought of one's own relationship to masculinity is necessary when deciding what is deemed a \\"serious\\" issue; and second, the potential to be seen as feminine based on one's judgment of said \\"serious\\" issue and therefore the possibility of being valued as less credible. Enloe warns the issues of letting masculinity and men override all aspects of international relations. She speaks of her own difficulties with writing candidly about women and the military and her fears of not being recognized as a legitimate political scientist because of her particular views. The stigma behind feminist thought in international relations needs to be reviewed and resolved. Enloe makes very clear that there is still an immense need for the study of masculinity in international relations and political economy. In order to better develop the international relations discipline, it is imperative that 'gender' be given a broader scope. In order to do so, there must be a feminist consciousness throughout the international relations community, as well as at the local level. A feminist consciousness will instill the education and interest in women and girls through their experiences, actions and ideas. Enloe finishes by reminding that without a proper feminist consciousness; we cannot fully comprehend or accurately analyze masculinity.  Nimo's War, Emma's War: Making Feminist Sense of the Iraq War  Unlike her previous books, Nimo's War, Emma's War: Making Feminist Sense of the Iraq War looks at how war itself is a cataclysm that disrupts countless lives. In this particular book, Cynthia Enloe solely focuses on capturing the impact of war and revolution on women during the Iraq War. The book looks at eight ordinary women, half Iraqis and half American, and all these women reflect different ideas about feminism through looking into their lives in detail. Importantly, Enloe does not only focus on the female half of this gender-driven phenomenon, but she also looks at their male counterpart in order to further investigate and provide an insight between the consequences of war and the effects on gender roles. Maha's Story talks about an Iraqi woman who, as well as many others, found themselves in a situation where their husband is either dead, divorced, detained, or missing, with children to care for, no social safety nets, meager finances, and no working papers. Maha finds herself caught in between an ethnic cleansing which Enloe terms, \\"the wielding of violence and intimidation for the sake of driving people of one ethnic or secretarian community out of a region...for the sake of securing that space for members of another ethnic or sectarian community.\\"Enloe, Cynthia H. Nimo's War, Emma's War: Making Feminist Sense of the Iraq War. Berkeley: U of California, 2010. Print. Kim's Story, reveals how gender and war affect each other on the other side of the world in the United States, whether or not one is actual place of war or away from it. Kim is a young American woman married to a National Guard soldier who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. Her story shows that their nation's state of war is dependent on wives playing certain roles. In the United States, \\"women who married active-duty, full-time American soldiers had been socialized to perform the demanding role of 'the military wife' ... each woman needed to be persuaded that she was most helpful and loyal to her own husband if she organized her labor and emotions in a way that enhanced the military as a whole.\\" Yet when the men comes home, there are stories that are untold. The American media are reluctant to pursue stories of domestic violence against women whose husbands are involved with the military largely because it is too great of a business risk during wartime. The blame for this neglect and decision to treat male domestic violence as a nonissue is on the entire military's masculinized culture.

Critiques of writings Bananas, Beaches and Bases would be considered Enloe's best-known work. It links various feminist issues regarding international relations throughout prior periods in time and throughout different cultures and places them at the forefront of discussion. In The Journal of Politics Karen Beckwith writes: \\"Enloe poses an initially simple question which leads to complex if necessarily partial conclusions: What happens to our international understanding of politics if we make the experience of women's lives central to our analysis?\\" Beckwith later states, \\"Her analysis is clear, complex, amusing demystifying, accessible, and insightful.\\" In The American Political Science Review Anne Sisson Runyan writes: ‚ÄúBananas, Beaches, and Bases offers a refreshing, insightful, and critical departure from conventional, top-down treatments of international politics.‚Äù Runyan later states, ‚ÄúAt a time when there is a need to explore the complex interplay of cultural, social, economic, and political forces in the face of the bankruptcy of modernist and masculinist ideologies, orders, and institutions as well as the enormity of global problems, this contemporary feminist reading of world politics makes eminent sense.‚Äù In The Journal of the History of Sexuality Manju Parikh writes, ‚ÄúEnloe's analysis is not only a timely contribution but also entertaining reading, which is a welcome addition to supplement the usual dry textbooks in the field.‚Äù Enloe also incorporates class and ethnicity into the shaping of women's behavior and our understanding of international relations as well. In Contemporary Sociology Kathryn Ward writes, \\"When seen from the everyday perspective of poor women of color, who are at the heart of our analyses, women's central roles in the world economic and political system become very clear, in contrast with past theories of the world economic and political system that have focused on the activities of white, elite men.‚Äù Ward later states, ‚ÄúSuch analyses may disturb some who are invested in past theories or who are uncomfortable with activism. However, I would argue, as does Enloe, that some of our most insightful and compelling analyses and theories will come from decentering past theories and looking at experiences, ideas, and emerging theories by activist women of color from around the world.\\" In Does Khaki Become You? The Militarization of Women's Lives, Enloe addresses the impact of militarization on gender relations and the social status of women. In The Journal of Peace Research Veena Gill writes, \\"In the context of militarism, [Enloe] analyzes the different roles of women from a social and economic perspective as army wives, nurses, prostitutes, soldiers, workers in defense and allied industries, and from the point of view of feminism. The military institution is exposed as a powerful patriarchal institution which women are urged to resist in their overall efforts towards social justice and equal status.\\" In Maneuvers; the International Politics of Militarizing Women's Lives, Enloe expands on her themes from Does Khaki Become You. She emphasizes the different experiences of women located in varied ethnic, national, class, and occupational contexts and how they are tailored to the needs of militarism, therefore embedding themselves in policy. In The American Political Science Review Mary Fainsod Katzenstein writes, \\"Those already among Enloe's wide readership will know some of this text's central arguments, but Maneuvers offers a trove of new insights. A thesis even more powerfully developed here than in Enloe's earlier writings is the title of the book‚Äîhow policymakers maneuver to make strategic choices.\\" Katzenstein later states, \\"Maneuvers has more than a functionalist lesson; by emphasizing policy choices and variability across time and national context, Enloe shows that militaries are not governed by primeval identities.\\" Recognition * Fulbright awards to Malaysia and Guyana * Guest professorships in Japan, Britain and Canada * ‚ÄúOutstanding Teacher‚Äù, Clark University (3 times) * Honorary Doctorate, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (2009). * The Susan B.

The school is situated on the southern side of the valley, and is 500 metres in length from the main gate on Conway Road, Cwmparc, to the rear gate at Tylecoch Bridge, Treorchy. Pupils who are identified as being proficient in Welsh will study RE, History, PE, PSHE and Geography through the medium of Welsh at KS3. At KS4, first language Welsh is offered at GCSE. History Formerly the site of the Tylecoch Colliery, Treorchy Comprehensive School began as the Upper Rhondda School and opened in 1965. In 1970 the school became a fully comprehensive school which could accommodate over 1,800 pupils taught by over 100 teachers. Subjects included English, Maths, General Science, French, Welsh, Geography, History, Physical Education, Art, Woodwork, Music and Religious Knowledge. The aim of the school is to satisfy the social and academic needs of children in the Upper Rhondda. The curriculum offers opportunities to study subjects in which pupils have a particular interest and aptitude. Pupils are placed in broad ability bands based on assessments from Primary schools they have attended. The school now serves 22 Primary Schools, 8 of which are in the catchment area and 3 of which are first language Welsh schools. Facilities The school contains a number of facilities, including I.T. suites spread across the school, sporting facilities, three canteens providing hot and cold foods, a swimming pool and drama and music suites. Courses Treorchy Comprehensive follows the basic English S.A.T. and GCSE Curriculum. It offers French and Spanish as modern foreign languages, and Welsh and English as compulsory subjects for all pre-A level students. Key Stage 3 The average Key Stage 3 pupil studies a maximum of 16 subjects taken from the National Curriculum, including English, Maths, Sciences, a modern foreign language, humanities, compulsory physical education, compulsory religious education, and compulsory Welsh. According to the last Estyn report, in 2006, the school achieves Key Stage 3 results just above the national average. Courses At Key Stage 4, students are offered to choose their own courses, which will be cut to 10 different courses, spread across a fortnightly timetable. The subjects from Key Stage 3 are offered at GCSE, GNVQ and BTEC levels. Compulsory P.E. and compulsory R.E. become 'short course' options, while students are offered the chance to study them as a 'full course' equal to a full GCSE. New courses are also offered at this level including Health and Social Studies, Leisure and Tourism, Media and Film Studies and Business and Communications Studies. The school has achieved an A*-G pass rate of over 90% since 2005. A.S./A-2 A-Level Courses A-level students are offered a range of courses to choose from. This range expands much more on the previous two key stages, and adds new subjects also. The student may choose a maximum of 5 or a minimum of 2 courses. The school is one of the few in the Rhondda that does not need pupils to travel to other schools to receive an A-level course. In 2007, the school began a compulsory Welsh Baccalaureate qualification for Sixth Form pupils. Other new courses on offer to pupils in the Sixth Form include Politics, Psychology, and Law and Electronics, as well as vocational subjects such as Hairdressing in the school's on site salon. Extra-curricular activities The school supports extra-curricular activity offers a wide variety of clubs and activities for pupils. These range from orchestra to rugby. The activities include: The Arts The school annually hosts performing arts events. As well as concerts in school, junior productions, the annual \\"Back To Broadway\\" performance and the Christmas concert, senior pupils perform a musical annually at the Parc & Dare Theatre. The performances are listed below: * 2020 - Our House * 2019 - The Wedding Singer * 2018 - Anything Goes * 2017 - Fiddler on the Roof * 2016 - Les Mis√©rables * 2015 - Singin' in the Rain * 2014 - West Side Story * 2013 - Miss Saigon * 2012 - Phantom Of The Opera * 2011 - We Will Rock You * 2010 - Guys & Dolls * 2009 - Jekyll & Hyde * 2008 - Les Mis√©rables * 2007 - My Fair Lady * 2006 - Calamity Jane * 2005 - Carousel The following activities take place daily within the school: *Drama Club *School Junior & Senior Brass Band *School Junior & Senior Choir *School Junior & Senior Orchestra *Various School Shows in the Parc and Dare Theatre Sports *Rugby *Football *Basketball *Netball *Cricket *Rounders *Athletics *Gymnastics *Circuit Training *Badminton *Dance *Hockey *Swimming Sixth Form Activities *Sign Language *Reading Support *Buddy Program *Sixth Form Council School-wide *Student Council *Conservation Club *Combined Cadet Force (CCF) Notable former pupils Arts *Brad Evans - author and political philosopher *Rachel Trezise ‚Äì author Biography ‚Äì About Rachel.

There is also one class for pupils with complex additional learning needs. Each class is assigned a colour. Pupils stay in these classes for both years. Pupils regularly complete assessments in all subjects. At the start of KS4 pupils are separated into one of two bands based on their maths, English and science abilities (determined throughout KS3). The band reflects whether a pupil will study for the Double Award Science GCSE (T band) or the three Triple Science GCSEs (P band). Pupils begin their KS4 studies in year 9 and complete them at the end of year 11. Pupils begin their KS5 studies in year 12 and complete them at the end of year 13.

Its local government area is the City of Mandurah. History Bouvard is named after Cape Bouvard some to the west, which was named by Nicolas Baudin, who sighted the cape en route to Rottnest Island from what is now Bunbury in 1802-1803, either after Charles Bouvard (1572-1658), a French chemist, or Alexis Bouvard (1767-1843), an astronomer and director of Paris Observatory. The Park Ridge estate was developed in the 1990s, and other estates have been built or proposed. Bouvard Coastcare, a volunteer group dedicated to maintaining the fragile coastal and dune environment, has won awards and grants for its work. Geography Bouvard consists of a narrow strip of land along both sides of the Old Coast Road, the main route between Mandurah and Bunbury and part of National Highway 1, between Yalgorup National Park and the Harvey Estuary. The western part consists of sparsely populated rural residential land with large lots separated by bushland buffers, while the eastern part follows more traditional coastal suburban development patterns along the estuary. At the 2011 census, Bouvard had a population of 821 people living in 483 dwellings, just under 20 percent of whom were elderly, and nearly all of whom were from Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the Netherlands or South Africa. * The 2011 figure represented an increase of 29 people from the 2006 census. There are walking trails and a couple of small roadside shops and a fuel station along the Old Coast Road. There are schools within easy reach of Bouvard, and the nearest shopping centre is at IGA Dawesville Transport Selected 594 services from Mandurah Station started servicing Bouvard in May 2011, and a Transperth school bus stops at the Bouvard Tavern. Private operator South West Coach Lines stops upon request at the Bouvard Tavern on its Perth to Bunbury service operating several times a day. Politics Bouvard is difficult to measure as it did not have a polling place at the election, but at the 2004 federal election, the nearest polling place at Dawesville recorded a 60.59% primary vote for the centre-right Liberal Party, while at the 2005 state election, the Liberals received 43.8% of the vote compared to 36.8% for the centre-left Australian Labor Party and 9.2% for the Nationals.

The term applies both to the mental processes used by humans, and to artificial processes of natural language processing. Speech segmentation is a subfield of general speech perception and an important subproblem of the technologically focused field of speech recognition, and cannot be adequately solved in isolation. As in most natural language processing problems, one must take into account context, grammar, and semantics, and even so the result is often a probabilistic division (statistically based on likelihood) rather than a categorical one. Though it seems that coarticulation‚Äîa phenomenon which may happen between adjacent words just as easily as within a single word‚Äîpresents the main challenge in speech segmentation across languages, some other problems and strategies employed in solving those problems can be seen in the following sections. This problem overlaps to some extent with the problem of text segmentation that occurs in some languages which are traditionally written without inter-word spaces, like Chinese and Japanese, compared to writing systems which indicate speech segmentation between words by a word divider, such as the space. However, even for those languages, text segmentation is often much easier than speech segmentation, because the written language usually has little interference between adjacent words, and often contains additional clues not present in speech (such as the use of Chinese characters for word stems in Japanese). Lexical recognition In natural languages, the meaning of a complex spoken sentence can be understood by decomposing it into smaller lexical segments (roughly, the words of the language), associating a meaning to each segment, and combining those meanings according to the grammar rules of the language. Though lexical recognition is not thought to be used by infants in their first year, due to their highly limited vocabularies, it is one of the major processes involved in speech segmentation for adults. Three main models of lexical recognition exist in current research: first, whole-word access, which argues that words have a whole-word representation in the lexicon; second, decomposition, which argues that morphologically complex words are broken down into their morphemes (roots, stems, inflections, etc.) and then interpreted and; third, the view that whole-word and decomposition models are both used, but that the whole- word model provides some computational advantages and is therefore dominant in lexical recognition.Badecker, William and Mark Allen. \\"Morphological Parsing and the Perception of Lexical Identity: A Masked Priming Study of Stem Homographs\\". Journal of Memory and Language 47.1 (2002): 125‚Äì144. Retrieved 27 April 2014. To give an example, in a whole-word model, the word \\"cats\\" might be stored and searched for by letter, first \\"c\\", then \\"ca\\", \\"cat\\", and finally \\"cats\\". The same word, in a decompositional model, would likely be stored under the root word \\"cat\\" and could be searched for after removing the \\"s\\" suffix. \\"Falling\\", similarly, would be stored as \\"fall\\" and suffixed with the \\"ing\\" inflection.Taft, Marcus and Kenneth I. Forster. \\"Lexical Storage and Retrieval of Polymorphemic and Polysyllabic Words\\". Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior 15.6 (1976): 607‚Äì620. Retrieved 27 April 2014. Though proponents of the decompositional model recognize that a morpheme-by-morpheme analysis may require significantly more computation, they argue that the unpacking of morphological information is necessary for other processes (such as syntactic structure) which may occur parallel to lexical searches. As a whole, research into systems of human lexical recognition is limited due to little experimental evidence that fully discriminates between the three main models. In any case, lexical recognition likely contributes significantly to speech segmentation through the contextual clues it provides, given that it is a heavily probabilistic system‚Äîbased on the statistical likelihood of certain words or constituents occurring together. For example, one can imagine a situation where a person might say \\"I bought my dog at a ____ shop\\" and the missing word's vowel is pronounced as in \\"net\\", \\"sweat\\", or \\"pet\\". While the probability of \\"netshop\\" is extremely low, since \\"netshop\\" isn't currently a compound or phrase in English, and \\"sweatshop\\" also seems contextually improbable, \\"pet shop\\" is a good fit because it is a common phrase and is also related to the word \\"dog\\". Moreover, an utterance can have different meanings depending on how it is split into words. A popular example, often quoted in the field, is the phrase \\"How to wreck a nice beach\\", which sounds very similar to \\"How to recognize speech\\".An often-used example in the literature of speech recognition. An early example is N. Rex Dixon, \\"Some Problems in Automatic Recognition of Continuous Speech and Their Implications for Pattern Recognition\\" Proceedings of the First International Joint Conference on Pattern Recognition, IEEE, 1973 as quoted in Mark Liberman, \\"Wrecking a nice beach\\", Language Log August 5, 2014 As this example shows, proper lexical segmentation depends on context and semantics which draws on the whole of human knowledge and experience, and would thus require advanced pattern recognition and artificial intelligence technologies to be implemented on a computer. Lexical recognition is of particular value in the field of computer speech recognition, since the ability to build and search a network of semantically connected ideas would greatly increase the effectiveness of speech-recognition software. Statistical models can be used to segment and align recorded speech to words or phones. Applications include automatic lip- synch timing for cartoon animation, follow-the-bouncing-ball video sub- titling, and linguistic research. Automatic segmentation and alignment software is commercially available. Phonotactic cues For most spoken languages, the boundaries between lexical units are difficult to identify; phonotactics are one answer to this issue. One might expect that the inter- word spaces used by many written languages like English or Spanish would correspond to pauses in their spoken version, but that is true only in very slow speech, when the speaker deliberately inserts those pauses. In normal speech, one typically finds many consecutive words being said with no pauses between them, and often the final sounds of one word blend smoothly or fuse with the initial sounds of the next word. The notion that speech is produced like writing, as a sequence of distinct vowels and consonants, may be a relic of alphabetic heritage for some language communities. In fact, the way vowels are produced depends on the surrounding consonants just as consonants are affected by surrounding vowels; this is called coarticulation. For example, in the word \\"kit\\", the [k] is farther forward than when we say 'caught'. But also, the vowel in \\"kick\\" is phonetically different from the vowel in \\"kit\\", though we normally do not hear this. In addition, there are language-specific changes which occur in casual speech which makes it quite different from spelling. For example, in English, the phrase \\"hit you\\" could often be more appropriately spelled \\"hitcha\\". From a decompositional perspective, in many cases, phonotactics play a part in letting speakers know where to draw word boundaries. In English, the word \\"strawberry\\" is perceived by speakers as consisting (phonetically) of two parts: \\"straw\\" and \\"berry\\". Other interpretations such as \\"stra\\" and \\"wberry\\" are inhibited by English phonotactics, which does not allow the cluster \\"wb\\" word-initially. Other such examples are \\"day/dream\\" and \\"mile/stone\\" which are unlikely to be interpreted as \\"da/ydream\\" or \\"mil/estone\\" due to the phonotactic probability or improbability of certain clusters. The sentence \\"Five women left\\", which could be phonetically transcribed as [fa…™vw…™m…ònl…õft], is marked since neither /vw/ in /fa…™vw…™m…òn/ or /nl/ in /w…™m…ònl…õft/ are allowed as syllable onsets or codas in English phonotactics. These phonotactic cues often allow speakers to easily distinguish the boundaries in words. Vowel harmony in languages like Finnish can also serve to provide phonotactic cues. While the system does not allow front vowels and back vowels to exist together within one morpheme, compounds allow two morphemes to maintain their own vowel harmony while coexisting in a word. Therefore, in compounds such as \\"selk√§/ongelma\\" ('back problem') where vowel harmony is distinct between two constituents in a compound, the boundary will be wherever the switch in harmony takes place‚Äîbetween the \\"√§\\" and the \\"√∂\\" in this case.Bertram, Raymond; Alexander Pollatsek; and Jukka Hy√∂n√§. \\"Morphological Parsing and the Use of Segmentation Cues in Reading Finnish Compounds\\". Journal of Memory and Language 51.3 (2004): 325‚Äì345. Retrieved 27 April 2014. Still, there are instances where phonotactics may not aid in segmentation. Words with unclear clusters or uncontrasted vowel harmony as in \\"opinto/uudistus\\" ('student reform') do not offer phonotactic clues as to how they are segmented. From the perspective of the whole-word model, however, these words are thought be stored as full words, so the constituent parts wouldn't necessarily be relevant to lexical recognition. Speech segmentation in infants and non-natives Infants are one major focus of research in speech segmentation. Since infants have not yet acquired a lexicon capable of providing extensive contextual clues or probability-based word searches within their first year, as mentioned above, they must often rely primarily upon phonotactic and rhythmic cues (with prosody being the dominant cue), all of which are language-specific. Between 6 and 9 months, infants begin to lose the ability to discriminate between sounds not present in their native language and grow sensitive to the sound structure of their native language, with the word segmentation abilities appearing around 7.5 months. Though much more research needs to be done on the exact processes that infants use to begin speech segmentation, current and past studies suggest that English-native infants approach stressed syllables as the beginning of words. At 7.5 months, infants appear to be able to segment bisyllabic words with strong-weak stress patterns, though weak-strong stress patterns are often misinterpreted, e.g. interpreting \\"guiTAR is\\" as \\"GUI TARis\\". It seems that infants also show some complexity in tracking frequency and probability of words, for instance, recognizing that although the syllables \\"the\\" and \\"dog\\" occur together frequently, \\"the\\" also commonly occurs with other syllables, which may lead to the analysis that \\"dog\\" is an individual word or concept instead of the interpretation \\"thedog\\".Jusczyk, Peter W. and Derek M. Houston. \\"The Beginnings of Word Segmentation in English-Learning Infants\\". Cognitive Psychology 39 (1999): 159‚Äì207. Retrieved 27 April 2014.Johnson, Elizabeth K. and Peter W. Jusczyk. \\"Word Segmentation by 8-Month-Olds: When Speech Cues Count More Than Statistics\\". Journal of Memory and Language 44 (2001): 548‚Äì567. Retrieved 27 April 2014. Language learners are another set of individuals being researched within speech segmentation. In some ways, learning to segment speech may be more difficult for a second-language learner than for an infant, not only in the lack of familiarity with sound probabilities and restrictions but particularly in the overapplication of the native language's patterns. While some patterns may occur between languages, as in the syllabic segmentation of French and English, they may not work well with languages such as Japanese, which has a mora-based segmentation system. Further, phonotactic restrictions like the boundary-marking cluster /ld/ in German or Dutch are permitted (without necessarily marking boundaries) in English. Even the relationship between stress and vowel length, which may seem intuitive to speakers of English, may not exist in other languages, so second- language learners face an especially great challenge when learning a language and its segmentation cues.Tyler, Michael D. and Anne Cutler. \\"Cross-Language Differences in Cue Use for Speech Segmentation\\".

Its local government area is the City of Mandurah. History The name \\"Coodanup\\" is of unknown origin, although the WA gazetteer states that in 1836, Lieutenant Henry Bunbury noted \\"Colanup\\" was the local Noongar name for the mouth of the Serpentine River. The Coodanup Park Estate was subdivided in 1956, including Beachley Street and the triangle between Wanjeep and Beacham Streets, and the suburb was gazetted in 1970. In the late 1980s, following the construction of the Mandurah Forum shopping centre in 1983, demand in the area grew and the northern part of the suburb adjacent to the Mandurah Bypass was developed, with Coodanup Senior High School (now Coodanup Community College) being built there in 1989. In 1996, a park home estate, Mandurah Garden Estate Caravan Park, was constructed on Pinjarra Road at the Serpentine River crossing. Several small estates have since been developed in eastern Coodanup and work is continuing. Geography Coodanup is bounded by the Serpentine River to the east, Harvey Estuary to the south, Pinjarra Road to the north and Mandurah Bypass and Wanjeep Street to the west.2006 StreetSmart directory, Department of Lands and Surveys, Perth. At the 2001 census, Coodanup had a lower-income population of 3,052 people living in 1,348 dwellings. Aboriginal people formed 5.8% of the population, while unemployment (24.4% in 2001) was far higher than in surrounding districts. Nearly 200 people live in the caravan park. Facilities Coodanup is a residential suburb built as a series of estates each built around well appointed, pristine community parks, with foreshores along the Serpentine River and Harvey Estuary. It relies on the Mandurah Forum shopping centre (formerly Centro Mandurah) on its north-western boundary for commercial services. The suburb contains two community centres, a wildlife sanctuary at the river mouth, Mandurah Catholic College and Coodanup Community College. Transport Both major residential sections of Coodanup are served by the 597 bus from Mandurah railway station. The service is operated by Transdev WA. Politics Coodanup normally strongly favours the Australian Labor Party at state elections, but have recently become more Liberal Party- leaning federally.

It is a prodrug form of penciclovir with improved oral bioavailability. Famciclovir is marketed under the trade name Famvir (Novartis). Famciclovir was patented in 1983 and approved for medical use in 1994. In 2007, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the first generic version of famciclovir. Generic tablets are manufactured by TEVA Pharmaceuticals and Mylan Pharmaceuticals. Medical uses Famciclovir is indicated for the treatment of herpes zoster (shingles), treatment of herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), herpes labialis (cold sores) in immunocompetent patients and for the suppression of recurring episodes of herpes simplex virus 2. It is also indicated for treatment of recurrent episodes of herpes simplex in HIV patients. Adverse effects Side effects: mild to extreme stomach upset, headaches, mild fever. Herpes  Early treatment  Several studies in humans and mice provide evidence that early treatment with famciclovir soon after the first infection with herpes can significantly lower the chance of future outbreaks. Use of famciclovir in this manner has been shown to reduce the amount of latent virus in the neural ganglia compared to no treatment or treatment with valaciclovir. A review of human subjects treated for five days with famciclovir 250 mg three times daily during their first herpes episode found that only 4.2 percent experienced a recurrence within six months after the first outbreak, a fivefold decrease compared to the 19 percent recurrence in acyclovir-treated patients. Neither drug affected latency if treatment was delayed for several months.

He is the twin brother of former footballer Damiano Zenoni. Club career Zenoni started his career at his native club Atalanta B.C., joining the team's youth system in 1994. After being promoted to the first team, in 1996, Zenoni was loaned to Serie C1 side A.C. Pistoiese for a season in order to gain playing time and experience. The following season, he made his Serie A debut with Atalanta on 5 October 1997, in a 1‚Äì1 draw against rivals Brescia; in total he made 17 appearances throughout the season. Despite his promising performances for the club, he was unable to help Atalanta avoid relegation to Serie B. He later helped Atalanta gain promotion to Serie A during the 1999‚Äì2000 season, and the next season, both he and his brother Damiano established themselves as two of the most exciting young full-backs in the league. Described by press as a promising young prospect, in June 2001, Cristian transferred to A.C. Milan along with Massimo Donati for 60 billion Italian lire in a cash plus player deal (the player was majority), but quickly transferred to Juventus F.C. as part of Filippo Inzaghi's transfer in the opposite direction, he was tagged for 30 billion Italian lire or about ‚Ç¨15.6M. He signed a 5-year contract. In the summer of 2003, Zenoni was loaned to U.C. Sampdoria with an option to sign permanently for 10 million euro. Six-Monthly Report at 31 December 2003 He was loaned out to the club once again in the summer of 2004, and at the end of the 2004‚Äì05 season, after almost helping the team qualify for the UEFA Champions League, he was signed permanently by Sampodoria for ‚Ç¨1M. Six-Monthly Report at 31 December 2004 After several seasons in Genoa, in 2008, Zenoni joined Bologna. In 2010, he moved to AlbinoLeffe, where he remained until 2011. He ended his career after spending the 2011‚Äì12 season with Monza, in Lega Pro. In total, he made 546 professional appearances, scoring 10 goals. International career After representing the Italy national under-21 football team three times between 1998 and 1999, Zenoni was capped at senior level for the Italy national football team twice, making his debut in a 2‚Äì1 friendly home loss against Argentina, on 28 February 2001, under manager Giovanni Trapattoni. He was recalled by Roberto Donadoni, for his first match as Italy's coach, in August 2006. Zenoni played the friendly match, his second and final Italy appearance losing 0‚Äì2 to Croatia on 16 August, as starter. Style of play A hard-working and athletic team player, Zenoni was regarded as a talented and promising young prospect, and as one of the best players in his position in Italy in his youth. He usually played as a right sided full- back, although he was known for his offensive prowess, stamina, and ability to cover the right flank, and was also capable of playing in more advanced positions on occasion, as a right winger.

Eala, better known as Noli Eala, was the sixth commissioner of the Philippine Basketball Association from 2003 to 2007. Before he became the commissioner of the league, he was a play-by-play commentator of Viva- Vintage Sports, which broadcasts the PBA Games, from the early 1990s until 2002. He was elected as commissioner of the league in 2002 after his predecessor, Emilio \\"Jun\\" Bernardino, retired from his post. Early life Eala studied high school at La Salle Green Hills before studying at Ateneo de Manila University, when he took a degree on Law. He also played a part as team manager for the Blue Eagles. Play-by-play commentator In his collegiate years, Eala used to call on the Man on the Ball radio show of Romy Kintanar. This later helped land him a job as commentator for PBA games on radio before joining Vintage Sports, later renamed as Viva-Vintage Sports on its TV panel. Eala started as an analyst from 1992 to 1994, then becoming a play-by-play commentator by 1995. Later on, Eala became one of the most popular commentators in the league with his famous lines such as Susmaryosep (a well known Filipino expression) and Nobody does it better, which drew raves and rants from fans. Eala also became the news anchor of IBC's early evening newscast, IBC Express Balita in 2002 together with Precious Hipolito-Castelo. He later left the newscast to anchor the late-night newscast, IBC News Tonight from 2002 to 2003. Eala had Andy Jao, Quinito Henson and Tommy Manotoc as color commentators during his years. However, in 2002, he was named as the sixth commissioner of the PBA. It also marked Viva-Vintage's last season as PBA TV coverer. He, alongside Manotoc, called Viva-Vintage's last PBA coverage during Game four of the All-Filipino Finals series between Coca-Cola and Alaska. Even with his current role as commissioner, Eala had brief appearances on the mic. He was one of the commentators during the 2005 Southeast Asian Games, calling mostly Badminton and Boxing matches. He also called a June 2005 Ateneo-La Salle Reunion Game for Studio 23. He also became one of the commentators for the MVP Cup 2 Badminton tournament. PBA commissioner Eala won the commissionership job in 2002 after a series of interviews by the PBA Board of Governors. He beat former Shell head coach and BCAP chair Chito Narvasa and Pilipinas Shell executive Rey Gamboa for the post. Disappointing first season Eala began his stint as commissioner in 2003, replacing Jun Bernardino as commissioner. Eala's first season was frustrating as the league was involved in several controversies. Early in the season, Talk N' Text's Asi Taulava and San Miguel's Dorian Pena were found to have tested positive of taking illegal substances by the Games and Amusements Board. This suspend both players for two games by the league. After this, Eala imposed a new drug testing policy on all PBA players. It led to massive discovery of less than 10 players testing positive, which drew several criticisms from fans and media alike. Attendance woes also affected the league during the said season. While the All-Filipino Conference had a decent number of attendance, the special Invitational tournament and the import-laiden Reinforced Conference drew disappointing numbers at the gate. One of Eala's plans to revive the league is by holding a tournament with foreign teams matching against PBA squads. This led to the Invitational tournament, in which four foreign squads were invited to join. However, Yonsei University, Novi Sad, Magnolia Jilin Tigers combined to win only a single game in the tournament, that drew another criticism on the league. While the Reinforced Conference had a decent success, the best-of-seven finals series between sister teams Coca Cola and San Miguel had a disappointing attendance during the full seven game series. New format Before the end of the 2003 season, Eala proposed a new format to the PBA Board of Governors. While Eala's plan was to have a one conference season for the league, instead of the usual three conference format, the Board decided to have two conferences in a season. The board also approved Eala's plan to move the league calendar from February to December to October to July, which took effect in 2004. One of the reason's for the move is for the PBA to take an active part in the formation of the national team in future international competitions. As part of the preparation for the new format, the league held a transitional conference known as the Fiesta Conference, which was held from February 22, 2004 until July 7, which was won by crowd-favorite Barangay Ginebra Kings, which drew a crowd of over 10,000 in the four games played at the Araneta Coliseum. The league's format during the said conference is to give the top two teams after the classification phase an outright quarterfinals berth, while the bottom eight will compete in a wildcard phase, with the winners facing off in the round robin quarterfinals format, joining two foreign teams, the University of British Columbia and a US-led squad. However, the format was criticized after the two foreign teams showed up losing all of their games in the quarterfinals. Aside from this, San Miguel, who had 16-2 record, was eliminated from the tournament. In the 2004-05 Philippine Cup, Eala changed the tournament format, to avoid top teams being eliminated early. The format would give the top two teams an outright semifinals berth, while the three to ten teams will play in a wildcard phase, with the winners advancing in the quarterfinals before facing the two teams in the semifinals. Fil-sham controversy Eala also made noise during the well-publicized Fil-sham (foreigners posing as Filipinos; only Filipinos can play as locals in the PBA, foreigners play as imports) controversy that has hounded the league for years. In 2004, Eala suspended six foreign cagers because of lack of documents to prove their Filipino blood. This also led to a controversial decision by Talk N' Text to suit up Asi Taulava during Game One of the Philippine Cup championship series against Ginebra. Taulava played for the Phone Pals, that resulted in a win. Two days later, however, the commissioner reversed the decision and awarded Ginebra the win. In 2005, Eala indefinitely suspend several Filipino-Americans, notably Eric Menk, for failing to secure additional documents to the league on time. In June 2005, after Taulava's citizenship was proven, Eala lifted the ban on the 6 ft 9 in center. Later in the year, the commissioner imposed an amnesty act that gave Menk and Mick Pennisi full authority to return and play for their mother teams. Reunion games In 2003, Eala announced a reunion game between Crispa and Toyota as part of the All-Star festivities at the Araneta Coliseum, featuring past players from both the Redmanizers and the Tamaraws. Toyota won the game 65-61, on the late-game heroics of Robert Jaworski. In 2005, the TM Legends Game was held, in which two teams compromising of the league's 25 Greatest Players will play at each other. The team of coach Baby Dalupan won 96-92, with Allan Caidic named as MVP. Eala, also played a part in forming the Ateneo-La Salle (Ateneo and La Salle are fierce rivals in the UAAP) Dream Games on December 8, 2005, which pit a group of PBA players and current players from both schools to face each others. The main event saw Ateneo defeating La Salle by three points. Marketing Under his watch, the league saw an improvement on its marketing aspects. An example of this are lowering of ticket prices that began in the 2005-06 PBA season, particularly on the Upper Box levels to only five pesos. This helped the league improved its average attendance from an estimated 4,000 in 2005 to more than 7,000 after the said season. Promotion was also imposed in the league with the help of several advertisements, TV programs like the league's in-house show iPBA and other gimmicks. Involvement with the national team In late 2004, Eala and the Basketball Association of the Philippines signed a memorandum of agreement for the pro league to send their players in international tournaments such as the FIBA-Asia Champions Cup, the William Jones Cup, the FIBA Asia Championship, and, if possible, the FIBA World Championship and the Olympics. Eala was given authority to choose then-Coca-Cola mentor Chot Reyes as the coach of Team Pilipinas. However, when the basketball crisis happened in April 2005, Eala sided with the Philippine Olympic Committee, instead of the heavily criticized BAP. Eala also made the constitution for the proposed new basketball body, known as Pilipinas Basketball. As it turned out, the BAP and Pilipinas Basketball were instead ordered by the FIBA to merge into a new body called the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas, of which Eala is a member. Under his watch, the national team suffered a 9th place showing in the recent 2007 FIBA Asia Championship in Tokushima, Japan, after failing to enter the next round with losses to eventual champion Iran and Jordan. In several interviews, Eala is urging for the implementation of the FIBA rules in the league in order for the players to easily adjust once they are called for the national squad. Disbarment and resignation On August 1, 2007, the Philippine Supreme Court (in a 9-page per curiam decision) disbarred Eala because of his \\"grossly immoral conduct\\" that stemmed from an extramarital affair. Eala violated Canons 1 and 7 of Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility because of his affair with a married woman named Irene Moje prior to the judicial declaration that her marriage was null and void.Supreme Court disbars PBA commissioner Eala, ABS-CBNNews.com On September 20, 2007, the Supreme Court of the Philippines dismissed with finality Eala's motion for reconsideration, ruling that, in engaging in an affair, Eala ridiculed marriage as mere \\"scrap of paper\\", and violated his lawyer's oath to uphold the Constitution and the laws. GMA NEWS.TV, SC upholds with finality Noli Eala's disbarment This resulted in the PBA board, during an emergency meeting on August 7, 2007, voting 5-3 to sack Eala as commissioner. On the same day, Eala announced his resignation from his post due to the circumstances of his disbarment case.Full statement of Noli Eala regarding his resignation. The league appointed former PBA executive director Sonny Barrios to act as temporary commissioner pending an election.BARRIOS BACK IN THE PBA AS OFFICER- IN-CHARGE On January 17, 2008, executive director Renauld \\"Sonny\\" Barrios was named new PBA commissioner by the board (after Chito Salud and Lambert Santos did not get enough votes) until 2009. www.abs-cbnnews.com, Sonny Barios named new PBA commish Criticisms Eala has been criticized by numerous fans for some of the decisions he made during his three-year run as commissioner. Eala was questioned in 2003 and 2004 for inviting ragtag foreign teams in a PBA sanctioned event. Eala was also questioned for the fil-sham controversy while some also questioned his role in the POC-BAP crisis. During his days as a commentator, some questioned his way of calling the games on television. However, some praised the commissioner for his role in the national teams initiative, the new league format, as well as the two reunion games held in 2003 and 2005. His decision to have the league hold its annual All-Star Games in the province, pitting the North and South All-Stars, was well received. Eala was also in hot water after the Eugene Tejada incident, when the latter suffered a life-threatening incident against Red Bull on May 14, 2006. In a column for the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Beth Celis wrote a piece in which claims that Eala was not in the venue and was \\"probably tired\\". After the piece was written, Eala reportedly complained to Celis for her somewhat poor judgment on the commissioner and also aired his side about his absence with Celis and in a separate article written by Quinito Henson. This was confirmed by Celis a later column, which accused Eala of having a \\"bad side\\". Eala also did not sanction Red Bull's Mick Pennisi and Enrico Villanueva after Pennisi landed on Tejada, both were accused of planning to injure Tejada, since \\"there was no malice on the incident.\\" Eala was also questioned for his proposed \\"3-point dunk\\" for the 2006-07 season. This proposal drew criticism from most PBA coaches and basketball purists, who believe that the league should focus on rules applicable to the international game. The rule was in fact used during the season in the April 2007 PBA All-Star Game in Baguio City. Post PBA commissioner activities On January 21, 2008, New Jersey promoter Gary Shaw confirmed (in Manila) IBF flyweight champion Nonito Donaire's title defense versus Hussein Hussein in Dubai on April 4. Third Force Promotions per president Noli Eala will stage the triple world championship card.

Abs-Cbn Interactive, Donaire to face Hussein in Dubai On May 31, 2008, Eala launched Liga Pilipinas, a regional basketball league. It folded in 2011, following the failed merger of the league with the Philippine Basketball League He became the Executive Director of Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas. Then in the late 2000s he was hired by the San Miguel Corporation to oversee the operations of their three PBA ballclubs: Barangay Ginebra, San Miguel/Petron and Purefoods/B-Meg.

It is largely residential and contains several canal estates developed since the 1980s.  Geography  Halls Head is one of four Mandurah suburbs (along with Erskine, Falcon and Wannanup) that lie on an island bound by the Mandurah Estuary to the north, the Peel-Harvey Estuary to the east, the Dawesville Channel to the south and the Indian Ocean to the west. Halls Head is the northernmost and most-populated of the four. The main roads include Mary Street, which links Halls Head directly to Mandurah CBD and Pinjarra Road. The other access road is the Old Coast Road, part of the national Highway 1 which links not only to Mandurah but also Perth and Bunbury. This road also acts as the eastern boundary, with Erskine on the opposite side of the road. Peelwood Parade and McLarty Road form a general north-south arterial through Halls Head, with other major roads including Leighton Road, Casuarina Drive and Seascapes Boulevard.  History  The locality was named after Henry Edward Hall (1790‚Äì1859, father of William Shakespeare Hall) who received a land grant of some to establish a farm there in the 1830s. Halls Head was officially gazetted as a suburb in 1970. It is the location of Hall's Cottage, the single-storey stone house built by the Hall family in 1833 and the only extant early settler's cottage in the district. Through the twentieth century the area was mostly a beach and fishing resort, with some permanent residents and many vacation homes. The 1000-hectare suburb of Halls Head was developed during the 1980s by the Parry Corporation and the state Government Employees Superannuation Board‚Äîone of the notorious WA Inc deals which later gave rise to a royal commission.WA Inc Royal Commission Report, Vol.I 19 October 1992, at State Law Publisher, Government of WA  Public transport  Halls Head is serviced by public transport provided by Transperth.

It was introduced alongside the Quadra 700 as the first computers in the Quadra family of Macintosh computers using the Motorola 68040 processor. It is also the first computer from Apple to be housed in an 18.6 inch (47 cm) tall mid-tower form factor, which by 1991 had gained momentum with PC manufacturers as a suitable design for departmental servers. The Quadra 900 had a short lifespan; it was discontinued about six months after the first shipments in favor of the more powerful Quadra 950.  Hardware  The Quadra 900 was more expandable than the Quadra 700 but cost US$7,200. The Quadra 900 could be upgraded to 256 megabytes of RAM, an astronomical amount for the time, when a typical midrange system would come equipped with 2‚Äì4 MB. The standard, as-shipped configuration for the 900 was 4 MB. The high RAM and storage capacity, along with the expandability of five NuBus 90 slots and fast 25 MHz processor, made it a very useful computer for scientific or design work. The mid-tower case design features a single 5.25-inch drive bay initially intended to hold a tape backup drive, that was often repurposed to hold a CD-ROM or SyQuest drive during the model's operational lifespan. Featuring 16 slots for 30-pin SIMMs (installed in groups of four), Quadra 900s with full complements of RAM were exceedingly rare due to the high cost (many thousands of dollars) of the SIMMs at the time. A new three-mode key-lock system on the front panel can be set to Off, On, and Secure. When set to Off, the machine can't be powered up. In Secure mode, the floppy drive and ADB port are disabled, offering a degree of local protection. System 7.0.1 was included and supports up to Mac OS 8.1. It is the earliest Macintosh model with the ability to run Mac OS 8. With the Power Macintosh Upgrade Card installed, the Quadra 900 runs at and its name is reported in the System Profiler as the Power Macintosh 900.

It is surrounded on three sides by water ‚Äî the Indian Ocean to the west, the Harvey Estuary to the east and the Dawesville Channel to the south ‚Äî and is home to the Port Bouvard development. It is one of four suburbs which lie on an island created by the building of the Dawesville Channel. History Wannanup is the original Aboriginal name for the suburb known as Florida. However, upon the development of the Dawesville Channel, the suburb was split in half. The southern section was placed in Dawesville while the northern section was regazetted as Wannanup in 1996. The 21st Century has seen the landscape of Wannanup transformed, with the development of Port Bouvard transforming the community from that of a sleepy fishing settlement to a commuter suburb and holiday destination. The Northport estate to the suburb's west lies close to Avalon and Village beaches and consists of modern townhouses based around a small shopping centre surrounded by a network of canals and modern mansions. Meanwhile, the Eastport estate is home to the Port Bouvard Marina, which is a popular area for activities such as boating and fishing. Demographics The Port Bouvard Bridge and Dawesville Channel dominates much of Wannanup as well as provides a popular recreation spot for fishing and boating At the 2011 census, Wannanup had a population of 2,769 \\\\- up from 1,958 people in the 2006 census ‚Äîand essentially tripling in size since the 2001 census (where 754 people were recorded). Politics Wannanup is located within the federal seat of Canning, currently held by Liberal Party member Andrew Hastie, and within the state seat of Dawesville, currently held by Zak Kirkup. The suburb does not have a polling place of its own, but at the nearby polling place at Dawesville, the two-party preferred vote favours the Liberal Party over the Labor Party. At federal level, the Liberals achieved 64.41% in 2004, 59.46% in 2007 and 58.33% in 2010. At the 2008 state election, the Liberals received 63.02% (up from 55.72% in 2005) of the two-party preferred vote at Dawesville from a primary vote of 58.05% (up from 43.83% for the Liberals and 9.26% for the Nationals). At local level, Wannanup is located within the Coastal Ward of the City of Mandurah, and is represented by three councillors: Bruce Blay (first elected 2006), Don Pember (elected 2007) and Rhys Williams (elected 2009). Transport Wannanup is bisected by Old Coast Road in a similar manner to neighbouring suburbs Falcon and Dawesville. Transperth routes 592, 593 and 594 frequently service the suburb. 592 runs six days a week through the Northport portion of Wannanup while 593 and 594 go straight through the suburb via Old Coast Road and run 7 days a week. Services generally run every twenty minutes during peak hour with 592 and 594 alternating every ten minutes in terms of departing Mandurah Station with some school specials deviating from this normal pattern.

In 1985 the network was electrified with a 25 kV overhead traction system. The network has been extended on several occasions as more mines come online. Two recent new mines were not initially electrified. These are Rolleston and Minerva Mines. The cost involved for the electrification of these two mines was considered too high as they are a considerable distance to join onto the current electrified network. However the electrification of the rail to Rolleston Mine was completed in December 2014. The rail to Minerva Mine is not electrified. There are both export and domestic customers served by this network. Domestic customers include Stanwell and Gladstone power stations. There are two rail operations in the network, Aurizon being the biggest operator and Pacific National being a newcomer to the network. Goonyella The Goonyella coal network is situated in Central Queensland.Goonyella Coal System QR National October 2011 Running from the dual ports of Hay Point (BMA operated) and Dalrymple Bay (BBI operated) to the mines in the northern section of the Bowen Basin coal area. This rail network transports coal from Gregory Mine, Oaky Creek coal mine, German Creek coal mine, Foxleigh coal mine, Norwich Park coal mine, Lake Vermont Mine, Saraji coal mine, Peak Downs Mine, Millennium Mine, Poitrel Mine, Moorvale Mine, Burton Downs Mine, Carborough Downs Mine, Issac Plains Mine, Moranbah North coal mine, Goonyella Riverside Mine, Hail Creek coal mine, Clermont Mine, Riverside Mine, North Goonyella coal mine, South Walker Creek coal mine, and Blair Athol coal mine.

In 1985 the network was electrified with a 25 kV overhead traction system. The network has been extended on several occasions as more mines come online. With each extension the electrified network has also been extended to accommodate the new mines. This line serves Anglo American Metallurgical Coal, BHP Mitsubitshi Alliance (BMA) Jellinbah Resources, Peabody Energy Australia, Rio Tinto Coal Australia, Vale Australia, Bowen Central Coal, Xstrata Coal Queensland, McCarthur Coal. There are two rail operations in the network, Aurizon being the biggest operator and Pacific National being a newcomer to the network. Xstrata has bought a number of locomotives and assures a part of its coal freight independently. There is actually a project for the \\"Norther Missing Line\\" GAP (Goonyella to Abbot Point) railway whose objective is to link the Goonyella line to the Abbot Point Coal Terminal. With growing orders from Asian countries (mostly China & India who have huge energetic needs), the GAP is a vital project as Abbot Point has the advantage of being 2‚Äì3 days closer to Asia than other ports, reducing tonnage price. There has been no press release regarding the electrification of this line.

Price Regulation As Aurizon's infrastructure is a monopoly, it is subject to regulation by government organisations such as the Queensland Competition Authority. Aurizon has disagreed with the QCA concerning the price that it should be allowed to charge its clients, for example when the QCA used a lower weighted average cost of capital that does not account for the risk that clean energy poses to fossil fuel.https://www.afr.com/business/mining/coal/aurizon- furious-with-regulators-draft-decision-on-queensland-coal-rail- access-20171218-h06lgt See also * Australian Railroad Group * Interail * Queensland Rail References Category:Interstate rail in Australia Category:Privatisation in Australia Category:Freight railway companies of Australia Category:Railway companies established in 2004 Category:Railway infrastructure companies of Australia Category:Transport in Queensland Category:Companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange Category:Australian companies established in 2004 ","title":"Aurizon"},{"id":"4273546","text":"Vladislav of Bosnia (/–í–ª–∞–¥–∏—Å–ª–∞–≤ –ö–æ—Ç—Ä–æ–º–∞–Ω–∏—õ; died 1354) was a member of the House of Kotromaniƒá who effectively ruled the Banate of Bosnia from September 1353 to his death. Vladislav was a younger son of Stephen I, Ban of Bosnia, and Elizabeth of Serbia. Upon the death of Ban Stephen I in 1314, Vladislav's mother assumed regency in the name of his older brother, Ban Stephen II. Unclear circumstances soon forced her to flee Bosnia and seek refuge in the Republic of Ragusa. She took her children with her, and Ragusan documents show they spent several years there in exile. The 16th-century chronicler Mavro Orbini states that only Stephen followed Elizabeth, while Vladislav and his brother Ninoslav went to the Croatian town of Medvedgrad. By the summer of 1319, the Kotromaniƒá family were back in Bosnia. Vladislav and Stephen took part in a great coalition of noblemen against their overlord Mladen II ≈†ubiƒá of Bribir, causing his downfall and bringing the House of Kotromaniƒá directly under the suzerainty of King Charles I of Hungary. The brothers then proceeded to assist the Ban of Slavonia in conflicts with Croatian magnates. Vladislav, titled knez, appears as co-granter of Stephen II's charters to the Hrvatiniƒá noble family between 1326 and 1331. In late 1337 or early 1338, he married Jelena, daughter of George II ≈†ubiƒá of Bribir. The marriage ceremony was performed by Lampridio Vitturi, Bishop of Trogir. The city authorities hostile to him later complained to the papacy that the marriage was uncanonical due to consanguinity of the couple. They nevertheless stayed together and had two sons, Tvrtko and Vuk. Stephen II died in 1353, leaving behind no sons. For reasons unknown, Vladislav was excluded from succession, and the title Ban of Bosnia passed directly to his son Tvrtko. Tvrtko, however, was only about 15 years old at the time, so Vladislav assumed the reins of government with his wife. He immediately took the young Ban on a tour throughout Bosnia, during which they settled relations with vassals. Despite his son being the enthroned ruler, Vladislav's name took precedence in charters, suggesting that the Ban was eclipsed by his father. Vladislav died in 1354, less than a year into his regency, leaving his widow to rule in Tvrtko's name until 1357.

The term is not precise and is applied to many different types of valve. The only consistent attribute is that the valve is designed to completely stop the flow when closed fully. Use Water service Stopcocks are used to grossly regulate the flow of tap water in residential and commercial services. One is found at the junction of a water main and the branch leading to an individual service (allowing the service to be isolated from the main trunk), a second inside the structure (allowing its plumbing to be isolated from the branch line leading into it). Either is employed when maintenance or emergency repairs are conducted. Laboratory A single hole hollow glass stopcock held in place by vacuum For laboratory glassware, items sometimes have plug valves with conically-tapered inserts called stopcocks (sometimes referred to as \\"plugs\\" by laypeople) with different bores. The valve bodies are usually made of glass, while the plugs are made of glass or Teflon. One can also find valves with Teflon spindle (for example one way valves or angled valves) When the plug is made of glass, the handle and plug are fused together in one piece out of glass. When both valve body and plug are made of glass, a suitable grease (e.g. silicone grease or Ramsay grease) is usually used to give a good seal, as well as to prevent the valve from seizing and subsequently cracking. Special stopcocks are available, such as a double-oblique design used in Schlenk lines which permit the application of inert gas and vacuum from the same stopcock. Stopcocks are often parts of laboratory glassware such as burettes, separatory funnels, Schlenk flasks, and columns used for column chromatography. The stopcock is a smooth tampered plug or rotor with a handle, which fits into a corresponding ground glass female joint. The stationary female joint is designed such that it joins two or more pieces of glass tubing. The stopcock has holes bored through it which allow the tubes attached to the female joint to be connected or separated with partial turns of the stopcock. Most stopcocks are solid pieces with linear bores although some are hollow with holes to simple holes that can line up the joints tubing. The stopcock is held together with the female joint with a metal spring, plastic plug retainer, a washer and nut system, or in some cases vacuum. Stopcocks plugs are generally made out of ground glass or an inert plastic like PTFE. The ground glass stopcocks are greased to create an airtight seal and prevent the glass from fusing. The plastic stopcocks are at most lightly oiled. Stopcocks are generally available individually with some length of glass tubing at the ports so that they can be joined by a glass blower into custom apparatus at the point of use. This is especially common for the large glass manifolds used in high vacuum lines. Many additional variations exist in both plug boring and joint assembly.

Founded by Edward Goldsmith, it addressed a wide range of environmental subjects and promoted an ecological systems thinking approach through its news stories, investigations and opinion articles. The Ecologist encouraged its readers to tackle global issues on a local scale. After cessation of its print edition in July 2009, The Ecologist continued as an online magazine.\\"The Ecologist website\\" In mid-2012, it merged with Resurgence magazine, edited by Satish Kumar, with the first issue of the new Resurgence & Ecologist appearing in print in September 2012.\\"Ecologist and Resurgence ‚Äì a stronger voice for change\\" The Ecologist was based in London.  History  The Ecologist emerged from the first wave of environmental awareness that followed the seminal book Silent Spring by Rachel Carson, which highlighted the dangers of bio-accumulative pesticides within food chains, and that culminated in the first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment at Stockholm in 1972. This period also saw the establishment of leading environmental organisations such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. The Ecologist was created in 1970 by Edward Goldsmith as a forum for himself and other academics to publish papers that were deemed too radical to be published in other magazines or the mainstream press. The Ecologist progressed from a small academic journal with an initial circulation of only 400, to one of the world‚Äôs leading environmental affairs magazines with monthly sales (including subscriptions and newsstand) of 20,000. As the magazine grew, its coverage became broader and its style more journalistic. The Ecologist covered topics including food, climate change, news, corporate affairs, chain stores, chemicals, pesticides and the corporatisation of the mass media. It was accused of being both left and right wing in its agenda, but did not follow the doctrine of any specific movement. It claimed to help readers ‚Äòrethink basic assumptions‚Äô about the world. On 8 April 2009, The Ecologist announced that it was relaunching solely online and that the July issue would be its last print edition. The website launched on 19 June 2009. Publication of The Ecologist's online, monthly newsletters ceased with the May 2012 issue. In June 2012 The Ecologist merged with Resurgence Magazine. A new, merged Resurgence & Ecologist print publication appeared in September 2012.\\"Frequently Asked Questions: Resurgence and the Ecologist\\", TheEcologist.org. Accessed: 14 September 2012. The Ecologist has also continued to publish online with new articles added daily.  Publishing landmarks  In 1972, The Ecologist published A Blueprint for Survival (1972), to which an entire issue was dedicated. Writing in the Guardian newspaper, former contributor Fred Pearce described it as \\"a radical green manifesto that went on to sell 750,000 copies and kept the magazine financially afloat for years.\\" A recommendation of the Blueprint led directly to the creation of the People Party which became the Ecology Party and then the Green Party (UK). A Blueprint for Survival follows through the consequences of what happens when humans disrupt the ecosystems in which they exist. It explains that when these systems are disrupted, they alter other ecosystems all over the world. Written in an age before climate change was understood, A Blueprint for Survival stands as one of the earliest forecasts of many of the environmental problems the world faces today. In the 'Monsanto' issue of September 1998, The Ecologist assembled a selection of articles critical of agri-business giant, Monsanto‚Äôs, environmental record. The Ecologist's printing firm at the time, Penwells, feared libel litigation from Monsanto and pulped the 14,000 copies of the edition. The issue was ultimately printed by a small London printer and went on to become the most-sold issue of The Ecologist ever.  Key people  Edward Goldsmith, founder of The Ecologist, was born in 1928 in Paris and was the first major influence on the publication. Having studied Politics, Philosophy and Economics, he served in the military and within a variety of different business ventures. Throughout his life he has taken on the roles of businessman, campaigner, lecturer, writer, editor and publisher. With the inheritance left to him by his father, Major Frank Goldsmith, Edward fulfilled his idea of creating a magazine which doubled as a platform for academic writers who were concerned about the world around them. Thirty-nine years later The Ecologist was still a major source of information on issues such as climate change, globalisation and sustainable economics. Edward Goldsmith was the editor from its foundation in 1970 until 1990, and then again from 1997 until 1998 whilst supporting his nephew, Zac Goldsmith. Former editors include Nicholas Hildyard, Peter Bunyard, Patrick McCully , Sarah Sexton, Simon Fairlie, Paul Kingsnorth (deputy editor), Malcolm Tait (managing editor), Harry Ram (managing editor), Jeremy Smith and Pat Thomas. When Hildyard left in 1997, Edward Goldsmith‚Äôs initial intention was that the Board of the International Society for Ecology and Culture (ISEC), directed by Helena Norberg-Hodge, should manage The Ecologist. Instead, Zac Goldsmith, who was then working for ISEC, became editor, as the other members of ISEC were occupied with other projects. Zac Goldsmith, born in 1975, joined at 22 years old as an intern before becoming editor of The Ecologist. Under Zac Goldsmith‚Äôs editorship a more diversified readership developed. In the 10 years that he was editor he developed a more conventional looking publication that could compete visually with other current affairs titles, while still maintaining its diverse content. In 2005 he became advisor to Conservative leader David Cameron's Quality of Life Policy Group, and in 2010 became Member of Parliament for Richmond. His influence continued in supporting The Ecologist financially but Goldsmith stepped down as editor in June 2007, saying, \\"The magazine has to remain impartial and feel free to have a go at the Government and at the Conservatives. So I can't both be the editor and a parliamentary candidate.\\" He remained as Chairman and Director of The Ecologist. Contributors to The Ecologist included Jonathon Porritt, Mark Lynas, Paul Kingsnorth, who was the magazine's deputy editor from 1999 to 2001, Tom Hodgkinson, Joss Garman, Chris Busby & Georgina Downs. Andrew Wasley, who joined the organisation in 2010, edited The Ecologist's website and newsletters.\\"Andrew Wasley - Profile\\" Oliver Tickell was appointed as the editor in October 2013.Oliver Tickell Appointed as Editor of The Ecologist Brendan Montague became the editor in October 2017.Brendan Montague is website editor at The Ecologist  Circulation  In its magazine format, The Ecologist had an average circulation of 20,000 per issue. In its online incarnation, in addition to the website there was a weekly e-newsletter and a monthly subscriber PDF newsletter, the last issue of which was published in May 2012. The Ecologist has a Facebook page at ‚ÄòThe Ecologist ‚Äì Official Page‚Äô and a Twitter account at ‚Äòthe_ecologist‚Äô with over 100,000 followers.  Editorial content  While The Ecologist did not adhere to any particular movements, its influence on anti-globalisation groups could be seen throughout its history in advocating the principle of localisation, with an emphasis on building community resilience in the face of peak oil and climate change while reducing food and other commodity supply chains.

The stadium holds 21,584 and was built in 1995, replacing the Stadio Mirabello. It was given the name Stadio Citt√† del Tricolore on 11 March 2012, having previously been called the Stadio Giglio.http://spazioreggioemilia.blogspot.it/view/classic On 8 July 2013, the stadium was given the current denomination for ownership reason (acquired by Mapei from the comune of Reggio Emilia).http://www.sassuolocalcio.it/news_dett.php?id=857  History  The need for a new stadium in Reggio Emilia started when Reggiana gained promotion to Serie A in 1993: the club launched multi-year season tickets in order to raise money to build a new stadium of its property. The stadium was opened in 1995 with a sold-out match between Reggiana and Juventus. In the aftermath of Reggiana's dissolution and reconstitution in 2005, the club lost the property of the stadium, which was assigned to the Tribunal of Reggio Emilia. The reconstituted Reggiana continued to play in the stadium and had its headquarters and its historical museum located in the Main Stand; in the same years the shopping mall \\"I Petali\\" was built behind the Away End and the East Stand, with a good range of shops, cinemas, gyms and restaurants. Stadio Giglio was renamed by the Municipality \\"Citt√† del Tricolore\\", referring to the creation of the Italian Tricolour in Reggio Emilia in 1797. The stadium is unique in that there is a water-filled moat built between the pitch and the stands to try to prevent pitch invasions. Because the water is supplied from a nearby river, there have even been cases in which bored fans have been seen successfully fishing in it. In 2013, the Tribunal hosted a public auction for the property of the stadium, which was won by the ceramic industry MAPEI, owned by former Confindustria president Giorgio Squinzi, which also owned U.S. Sassuolo Calcio, promoted in Serie A at the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season. The stadium was then renamed \\"MAPEI Stadium\\" due to sponsorship reasons. Sassuolo's move and MAPEI's acquisition and subsequent renaming of the stadium has caused much outrage from supporters of Reggiana. The protests included demonstrations at the 2015 TIM Trophy and during some Sassuolo's Serie A games and the formation of a group called \\"Via il Sassuolo da Reggio Emilia\\" (Sassuolo out of Reggio Emilia), but also marches through the city centre to raise the attention on the topic. In September 2016, Luca Vecchi, Mayor of Reggio Emilia, was heavily booed by the fans during the club's presentation due to the Municipality position on the dispute.  Events  It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home ground of Reggio Audace F.C.. It also hosts larger rugby union matches for Pro14 team, Zebre of Parma. Football club Carpi used the ground for home matches during the 2011‚Äì12 season. In the 2013‚Äì14 season, the promoted Serie A side, Sassuolo, played at the ground. They signed a two-year rent deal with Reggiana, which manages the venue. The agreement struck with Reggiana also included infrastructural improvements, including new benches and locker rooms, along with the development of new marketing and trade policies, which aimed to take advantage of the business opportunities that come with the club's Serie A promotion.http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2013/06/sassuolo-announce-stadium- change-to-accompany-serie-a-play/ The stadium was consequently renamed Mapei Stadium ‚Äì Citt√† del Tricolore.

In Switzerland, he is remembered as the hero of the Battle of Murten. Life Adrian von Bubenberg was born as the son of Heinrich IV. von Bubenberg, Schultheiss of Bern and lord of Spiez, whom he succeeded in 1465. During a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1466, he was dubbed a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre. Numerous times before and after the Burgundy wars, he led Bernese negotiations with other cantons of the old Swiss Confederacy and foreign powers including Savoy, Burgundy, France and the Holy Roman Empire. But his heroic stature in Swiss history is due to his tenacious defense during the siege of Murten. He had been appointed commander of the city garrison in April 1476. The city was besieged during twelve days in June by the troops of Charles, Duke of Burgundy, and Bubenberg managed to hold until he was relieved by confederate forces on 22 June, leading to the decisive defeat of Charles. Legacy Von Bubenberg was buried in the choir of the Berner M√ºnster, the Cathedral of Bern. Ever having been short of funds in spite of being the head of Berne's preeminent noble house, von Bubenberg was posthumously banned for his debts in 1481, but the government resisted Pope Sixtus IV's demand that he be exhumed and dishonourably buried because of this. The monument in its original setting (1915 photograph) Bubenberg's deeds figure already in the near-contemporary illustrated chronicles by Diebold Schilling the Elder. Later, he became an icon in Romantic nationalism, portrayed in literature as the ideal of knightly virtue and of patriotism, notably in the novel Ring i der Chetti by Rudolf von Tavel (1931). In 1897, Bern honoured Bubenberg with a bronze statue on Christoffelplatz, which was renamed to Bubenbergplatz on the occasion. The design for the statue triggered a dispute on whether it was proper to show Bubenberg on foot rather than as a knight in an equestrian statue. The statue was moved to the nearby Hirschengraben in 1930 to make room for tramway infrastructure; plans to move the statue triggered controversial debate in Bernese newspapers in early 1930, but the plan found popular support in a vote of 6 April, the statue was removed on 24 April and erected at its current location on 19 May.Karl F.

The stadium is also used for rugby matches, concerts and other events.  History  Stadio Brianteo, located on the north-eastern outskirts of Monza, was built as a replacement for the Gino Alfonso Sada stadium, located in the center near the station. The construction works started after a long debate and lasted a long time due to the technical difficulties in the construction of the structure that supports the coverage of the grandstand and the changes to the project in progress. Initially an athletics track was planned, but it was eliminated during the works. The stadium was inaugurated on 28 August 1988 during the Coppa Italia match against Roma, which ended with a score of 2‚Äì1 for Monza, with goals by Casiraghi, Giannini, and Mancuso. Since 4 September 2020, the stadium is known commercially as the U-Power Stadium for the 2020‚Äì21 Serie B season.

It consists of one or more cysts and tends to grow larger over time. The disorder usually develops while the fetus is still in the uterus but can also appear after birth. \\"What are cystic hygromas?\\" Healthline. Retrieved April 27, 2018 Also known as cystic lymphangioma and macrocystic lymphatic malformation, the growth is often a congenital lymphatic lesion of many small cavities (multiloculated) that can arise anywhere, but is classically found in the left posterior triangle of the neck and armpits. The malformation contains large cyst-like cavities containing lymph, a watery fluid that circulates throughout the lymphatic system. Microscopically, cystic hygroma consists of multiple locules filled with lymph. Deep locules are quite big, but they decrease in size towards the surface. Cystic hygromas are benign, but can be disfiguring. It is a condition which usually affects children; very rarely it can be present in adulthood. Currently, the medical field prefers to use the term lymphatic malformation, because the term cystic hygroma means water tumor. Lymphatic malformation is more commonly used now because it is a sponge-like collection of abnormal growth that contains clear lymphatic fluid. The fluid collects within the cysts or channels, usually in the soft tissue. Cystic hygromas occur when the lymphatic vessels that make up the lymphatic system are not formed properly. The two types of lymphatic malformations are macrocystic (large cysts) and microcystic (small cysts) lymphatic malformations. A person may have only one kind of the malformation or can have a mixture of both macro- and microcysts. Cystic hygroma can be associated with a nuchal lymphangioma or a fetal hydrops.Schwartz's principles of surgery: self assessment and board review, 8th edition, chapter 38, page 257; textbook p.1476 Additionally, it can be associated with Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, or Noonan syndrome. If it is diagnosed in the third trimester, then chances of association with Down syndrome are increased, but if diagnosed in the second trimester, then it is associated with Turner syndrome. A lethal version of this condition exists, known as Cowchock‚ÄìWapner‚ÄìKurtz syndrome, that, in addition to cystic hygroma, includes cleft palate and lymphedema, a condition of localized edema and tissue swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system.  Signs and symptoms  Cystic hygromas are classically found in the posterior triangle of the neck. Cystic hygromas are increasingly diagnosed by prenatal ultrasonography. A common sign is a neck growth. It may be found at birth, or discovered later in an infant after an upper respiratory tract infection. Cystic hygromas can grow very large and may affect breathing and swallowing. Some symptoms may include a mass or lump in the mouth, neck, cheek, or tongue. It feels like a large, fluid-filled sac. In addition, cystic hygromas can be found in other body parts, such as the arms, chest, legs, groin, and buttocks. Cystic hygromas are also often seen in Turner's syndrome, although a patient who does not have the syndrome can present with this condition. Diagnosis Lymphatic malformations may be detected in the human fetus by ultrasound if they are of sufficient size. Detection of a cystic malformation may prompt further investigation, such as amniocentesis, to evaluate for genetic abnormalities in the fetus. Lymphatic malformations may be discovered postnatally or in older children/adults, and most commonly present as a mass or as an incidental finding during medical imaging. Verification of the diagnosis may require more testing, as multiple cystic masses can arise in children. Imaging, such as ultrasound or MRI, may provide more information as to the size and extent of the lesion.  Treatment  Newborn infant with a cystic hygroma visible on right side of the neck A baby with a prenatally diagnosed cystic hygroma should be delivered in a major medical center equipped to deal with neonatal complications, such as a neonatal intensive care unit. An obstetrician usually decides the method of delivery. If the cystic hygroma is large, a cesarean section may be performed. After birth, infants with a persistent cystic hygroma must be monitored for airway obstruction. A thin needle may be used to reduce the volume of the cystic hygroma to prevent facial deformities and airway obstruction. Close observation of the baby by a neonatologist after birth is recommended. If resolution of the cystic hygroma does not occur before birth, a pediatric surgeon should be consulted. Cystic hygromas that develop in the third trimester, after 30 weeks' gestation, or in the postnatal period are usually not associated with chromosome abnormalities. A chance exists of recurrence after surgical removal of the cystic hygroma. The chance depends on the extent of the cystic hygroma and whether its wall was completely removed. Treatments for removal of cystic hygroma are surgery or sclerosing agents, which include: * Bleomycin * Doxycycline * Ethanol (pure) * Picibanil (OK-432) * Sodium tetradecyl sulfate Progression with surgeries Cystic Hygroma (cropped).jpgPatient with cystic hygroma Lymphangioma.jpgSame patient after first surgery Lymphangioma - After 4 surgeries (cropped).jpgSame patient after four surgeries See also *Branchial cleft cyst *Ranula *Thyroglossal duct cyst *Lymphangioma References  External links  Category:Congenital disorders Category:Otorhinolaryngology ","title":"Cystic hygroma"},{"id":"4273706","text":"Caroline Jack (born 29 July 1978 in Port Elizabeth) is a field hockey goalkeeper from South Africa, who represented her native country at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

Rich Brothers Dry Goods Company remained a family owned store, Davison-Paxon-Stokes sold out to R.H. Macy & Co. in 1925. By 1927, R.H. Macy built the huge Peachtree Street store, 200 Peachtree, which still stands today. The downtown Davison's store was a classic example of a downtown shopping experience. The main entrance on Peachtree features a very stately marble-floored cosmetics and jewelry area, modelled after Macy's flagship store on Herald Square in New York. There is a mezzanine overlooking the level with escalators leading to that floor. A bank of elevators in the rear serves floors from the basement through the sixth floor. The mezzanine and the third floor connected with the parking garage across Carnegie Way. When the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel opened next door in 1976, an entrance connected the two buildings, although the difference in floor heights required several steps up from Macy's into the hotel. Davison's was owned by Macy's for sixty years under its own name, and made no effort to disguise its affiliation with Macy's. Advertisements clearly stated \\"Davison's - a division of R.H. Macy & Co.\\" and charge cards from Davison's were usable at Macy's and Bamberger's (and vice versa). Growth Over time, the Davison-Paxon Company name was shortened to simply Davison's. Not long after, the company embarked on an aggressive expansion plan across Georgia and South Carolina. Locations opened in the downtowns of Athens, Augusta, Macon and Columbus, as well as a store in downtown Columbia, South Carolina. During this time, Rich's remained exclusively in Atlanta. In Augusta, Davison's competed with the J.B. White chain and in Columbus, Kirven's was its main rival. In 1959, Davison's opened its first suburban location at Lenox Square mall along with Rich's. Throughout the 1960s, Rich's began to very aggressively expand in the suburbs while Davison's remained a downtown player for the most part. However, Davison's did open one mall location at the now-demolished Columbia Mall (later known as Avondale Mall) near Avondale Estates. Davison's expanded once again in the 1970s and 1980s with locations at Cumberland, Southlake, Gwinnett Place, Shannon, Northlake and Perimeter Malls. New locations also replaced the downtown stores in all the other cities mentioned except Columbus, which faced stronger competition from regional chains. The Columbia store continued as the only downtown store (except for the headquarters Peachtree St. store) in the Macy's Atlanta division until it was forced to close in 1992 as part of the Chapter 11 reorganization. Today, it is the site of the Columbia Museum of Art. The new Davison's stores were typically white brick with small glass atriums at the entrance. Davison's also sponsored the Egleston Children's Christmas Parade, whose route still passes the former downtown store location. Mergers In the mid-1980s, Macy's began to consolidate its regional divisions to streamline its corporate structure. In January 1985, Davison's and Macy's Midwest were combined into one division, Macy's Atlanta. Macy's slowly began to retire the Davison's name. In 1984, the logo was changed to the same thin typeface of its more famous counterpart in the ITC Avant Garde font.Davison's/Macy's Banner from 1985. By early 1986, all Davison's stores were formally renamed Macy's. In late 1986, the first Atlanta-area store to begin under the Macy's name opened at Town Center at Cobb in Kennesaw. Final act By spring 2003, most all former Davison's stores were closed when Rich's and Macy's were consolidated under the \\"Rich's-Macy's\\" nameplate. That same year, the historic downtown Davison's/Macy's store on Peachtree Street was also closed. This ended the era of department-store shopping in downtown Atlanta. All of the old Davison's mall stores in Atlanta were left vacant except for three locations. The Perimeter Mall and Lenox Square locations were closed, renovated, and reopened several months later as Bloomingdale's in late 2003 and the Perimeter Mall location closed in March 2012 and became Von Maur and the Lenox Square location is still open as of 2014. The Northlake location was re-branded as Rich's-Macy's before changing back to simply Macy's two years later. One floor of the Town Center location, which had originally opened as Macy's, became a Rich's-Macy's Furniture Gallery location. It is now a Macy's Furniture Gallery location and a Macy's Furniture Clearance Center on the upper level, and now has a Macy's Men's Store on the lower level. And Macy's Furniture Gallery on the middle level. The remainder of Davison's former locations remain vacant except for the locations at Cumberland Mall, Avondale/Columbia Mall, Gwinnett Place and Augusta Mall. The Cumberland Mall location was torn down in late 2005 for a major overhaul at the 32-year-old center, a detached Costco now sits just to the west of the Davison's footprint The Cumberland Mall location is now a courtyard/lifestyle center containing Ted's Montana Grill closed in 2020 due to Covid 19 financial restraints , Cheesecake Factory, Pf Changs, and Maggiano's Little Italy. The Avondale/Columbia Mall location was completely demolished with the rest of the mall for a Wal-Mart SuperCenter. The Gwinnett Place location is now home to Korean chain Mega Mart. The Augusta Mall location was open till 2006 as a Macy's Furniture Showroom. It has closed to make way for a lifestyle center similar to Cumberland Mall, another General Growth Properties mall.  Current use The downtown location no longer functions as a department store. Most of the building (), with the address 180 Peachtree, is as of 2012 used as a data center.\\"180 Peachtree sells for $94.7 million\\", Douglas Sams, Atlanta Business Chronicle, January 12, 2012 Another part, owned by 200 Peachtree Retail, a group of investors embarked on a major effort to transform part of the historic building ‚Äî which had remained mostly vacant since Macy‚Äôs closed in 2003 ‚Äî into an event center called Southern Exchange Ballrooms, that hosts conferences, weddings, parties and other special events.

It takes its name from Douglas Park, the club's former stadium which was located immediately to the south of the current site. Stadium The stadium is located in the north of Hamilton, close to the Burnbank and Whitehill residential areas and to Hamilton West railway station. Construction of the stadium was completed by Ballast Nedam in 2001; the initial intention was for its name to be The Ballast Stadium. The pitch was converted to artificial FieldTurf in 2004, the more durable surface allowing the club to hold training sessions and youth academy matches there without damaging the playing field for first team matches. After Hamilton was promoted to the Scottish Premier League in May 2008, the artificial surface had to be replaced by grass due to league rules, an alteration which owner Ronnie MacDonald claimed had cost ¬£850,000 (including the installation of undersoil heating). In addition to the turf replacement, a small temporary stand with a capacity of 500 was erected in March 2008 to bring the stadium's capacity up to the league requirement of 6,000 all seater. At the beginning of season 2013‚Äì14, Hamilton returned to an artificial playing surface, this time produced by TigerTurf with an installation cost of ¬£400,000. In June 2018, that surface was voted as the worst of 42 SPFL venues in a survey of the league's players. The following day, the club made public their intention to install a new Greenfields surface in time for the 2018-19 season, costing ¬£750,000 and with the same specification as the SFA performance centre at Oriam. In July 2016 it was announced that as part of a ¬£750,000 sponsorship deal, New Douglas Park would be renamed the SuperSeal Stadium after a deal was agreed with Glasgow- based home improvements company SuperSeal. In July 2018 it became the Hope CBD Stadium following another sponsorship deal with a firm providing cannabidol products owned by the club's chief executive Colin McGowan. In July 2019 it changed again to the Fountain of Youth Stadium in another sponsorship deal worth ¬£750,000.

The castle was the ancestral home of the line of the St Lawrence family Howth Castle, family official site - History of Howth Castle, visited 6 October 2018 (see: Earl of Howth) that had held the area since the Norman Invasion of 1180, and held the title of Lord of Howth until circa 1425, the Baron Howth to 1767, then Earl of Howth until 1909. The castle and estate are held since 1909 by their distaff heirs, the Gaisford-St Lawrence family. The estate includes much of the peninsula of Howth Head, including extensive heathland and much of the famous Howth cliff walks, with views over Dublin Bay, light woodland, and the island of Ireland's Eye. On the grounds near the castle are golf, pitch and putt and footgolf facilities, a former hotel, formal gardens and a pond, rhododendron walks - and several small streams pass through the estate. In October 2018, the family announced their agreement to sell the castle, demesne and Ireland's Eye to Tetrarch investment group who intended to redevelop the hotel and course as a luxury resort. A 7 acre portion of the site zoned for residential development close to the castle gate was sold onwards by Tetrarch to Glenveagh Homes for ‚Ç¨14m after the sale closed. Glenveagh's interim financial report notes they intend to build 200 apartments on the site with first deliveries in 2023.Tetrarch buys 470 acres in Howth including its castle and former hotel Irish Times, 2018-10-05. History Since 1180 the St Lawrence family were the feudal lords of Howth. The original family castle, a timber structure, was sited on the edge of Howth village, on Tower Hill, overlooking Balscadden Bay. In some form, Howth Castle has stood on its present site for over 750 years. The great English architect Sir Edwin Lutyens in 1911 restyled a 14th-century castle built here, overlooking Ireland's Eye and the north Dublin coastline. The estate previously included much of coastal northern Dublin, including the lands of Kilbarrack, Raheny and parts of Clontarf, but these were gradually sold off from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century. In the second half of the 20th century, the castle's demesne was largely redeveloped to provide golfing facilities, and a mid-price hotel, with bar, restaurant and spa facilities, was opened. In the early 21st century the Castle saw the opening of a cookery school, and later a cafe, and was occasionally available for guided tours. In October 2018, Julian Gaisford St-Lawrence announced that the family had agreed to sell the property to a private investment group. The golf club and related facilities would remain open through 2019, the hotel would be redeveloped and reopened as a luxury property, and residential development would be possible. No details were given on whether the family would retain some land, or a life right to live in the castle, or of the future of the volunteer-operated Transport Museum located on the grounds. Legend A popular legend about the castle concerns an incident that allegedly occurred in 1576. During a trip from Dublin, the Gaelic chieftain and \\"pirate queen\\" Gr√°inne O'Malley attempted to pay a courtesy visit to the 8th Baron Howth. However, she was informed that the family was at dinner and the castle gates were closed against her. In retaliation, she abducted the grandson and heir, the 10th Baron. He was eventually released when a promise was given to keep the gates open to unexpected visitors, and to set an extra place at every meal. At Howth Castle today, this agreement is still honoured by the descendants of the Baron. Grounds Howth Castle, circa 1820 In 1892 Rosa Mulholland referred to the grounds thus: ‚ÄúBack on the lower land you must visit the ancient demesne of the Earl of Howth, where a quaint old castle stands in a prim garden with swan-inhabited pond, and plashing fountain, encircled by dark beautiful woods full of lofty cathedral-like aisles, moss carpeted, and echoing with the cawing of rooks.‚Äù(Mulholland 1892: 35) The grounds near the castle are noted for the wild rhododendron gardens, which are open to the public in summer, and some of the oldest beech hedges in Ireland, planted in 1710. At certain times, such as summer 2016, guided tours of the castle could be booked at weekends. As late as the mid-20th century, there was a rock garden near the Church of Ireland parish church, a \\"sundial garden\\" near the main entrance gate, an orchard and a moat and the site of a well or spring in front of the castle; all of these features later fell into disuse. A small sunken garden lay beside the castle's chapel wing, and a formal garden, of which parts remain, behind it, with a walk cutting through to the Swan Pond, beside which was a fern garden. The Bloody Stream ran in front of the castle, another stream used to pass directly by, and was later captured by castle drainage, and a third was connected to the Swan Pond. One of the streams in Sutton also comes from within the estate. The more remote parts of the estate are treated as more or less public land, with popular walks, and are substantially subject to a Special Amenity Area Order. In the 20th century, the 17th classical landscape was substantially modified to make the Deer Park golf courses, which had an associated hotel, the Deer Park Hotel, for many years. The \\"Kitchen in the Castle Cookery School\\" was opened by two members of the family, based in the restored Georgian kitchens of Howth Castle. The volunteer-operated National Transport Museum of Ireland is located in the grounds of the castle. It features lorries, trucks, fire engines and tractors. Also exhibited is the restored Hill of Howth No.9 Tram. Howth Park Racecourse (1829 - 1842) In 1829 a racecourse was established in the castle grounds by Thomas St Lawrence, 3rd Earl of Howth who had a particular passion for horses. The course was known as Howth Park Racecourse and ran from the backgate lodge of the castle on Carrickbrack Road down to the corner of the grounds of Seafield House (now Santa Sabina school) and North broadly along the route of Offington before circling Corr Castle and returning up along the Howth Road. The races were attended by all the leading owners, trainers and jockeys of the day with the race-card paying testament to the importance of the occasion. A sample of attendees from 1838 included Lord Howth, Lord Sligo, Sir John Kennedy, Captain Burke and Burnell and the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Constantine Phipps, 1st Marquess of Normanby. Although initially only members of respected racing clubs (Howth Park Club or the Corinthians Club at the Curragh) and gentry were allowed to enter, in 1834 access expanded to include a Trademen's Cup and in 1839 a Citizens' Plate. The races stopped permanently at Howth in 1842, likely due to the death of Emily, first wife of the Lord Howth however racing did eventually recommence post the Great Famine nearby at Baldoyle Racecourse from 1853 onward. Notable races included the St.Lawrence Stakes and the Vaughan Goblet. Popular culture Literature The locale of James Joyce's 1939 novel Finnegans Wake is \\"Howth Castle and Environs,\\" which is taken to mean Dublin, and it begins and ends with a reference to this. The initials HCE appear in many contexts in the novel, not least in the name of its presumed main character, Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker. There are also more than a dozen references to Howth, its team and the rhododendron walks near the castle, in Ulysses. Film location Howth Castle was depicted as the fictitious \\"Castle Haloran\\" from the 1963 Roger Corman and Francis Ford Coppola b-film Dementia 13 (a.k.a. The Haunted and the Hunted) where it was the setting of numerous scenes. Flashback scenes from the Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western, Duck, You Sucker were shot here.Duck, You Sucker, AKA A Fistful of Dynamite (2-Disc Collector's Edition, Sergio Donati Remembers) (DVD).

He is also professor of Computer programming at Middlesex University. Previously he was at Queen Mary, University of London.  Research  Bornat's research interests includes program proving in separation logic. His focus is on the proofs themselves; as opposed to any logical underpinnings. Much of the work involves discovering ways to state the properties of independent modules, in a manner that makes their composition into useful systems conducive. Bornat (in conjunction with Bernard Sufrin of the Oxford University Computing Laboratory) developed Jape, a proof calculator; he is involved in research on the usability of this tool for exploration of novel proofs. Richard Bornat's PhD students have included Samson Abramsky in the early 1980s. In 2004, one of Bornat's students developed an aptitude test to \\"divide people up into programmers and non- programmers before they ever come into contact with programming.\\" The test was first given to a group of students in 2005 during an experiment on the use of mental models in programming. In 2008 and 2014, Bornat partially retracted some of the claims, impugning its validity as a test for programming capability.  Publications  Bornat published a book entitled \\"Understanding and Writing Compilers: A Do It Yourself Guide\\", which is regarded as one of the most extensive resources on compiler development.

The name is derived from the wackiness and zaniness of the activities, segments, and overall personality of the show and its hosts. The morning zoo concept and name is most often deployed on Top 40 (CHR) radio stations. A morning zoo typically consists of two or more radio personalities, usually capable of spontaneous comic interaction as well as competent delivery of news and service elements. Most morning zoo programs involve scripted or live telephone calls, on-air games, and regular contests. History The first morning zoo program, focusing on the zany interactions of two hosts, was conceived and performed in 1981 by Scott Shannon and Cleveland Wheeler of WRBQ-FM in Tampa, Florida, known at the time as Q105 FM. Wheeler had been serving as the personality DJ hosting the morning drive program for the station's previous four years. Shannon was the new operations manager in January 1981. The two decided to break with tradition and work up a wilder show together, founded on their own playful, irreverent and provocative interaction, with spontaneous bits of parody and comedy leavened with straight news. They called the show the Q Morning Zoo, and it quickly became a hit. At its height it had 85 people working to produce it. (Prior to this development, radio station KZEW in Dallas was known as \\"the Zoo\\" because of its call letters. Beginning in September‚ÄìOctober 1976, morning DJ Charlie Kendall hosted a zany show initially named Zooloos In Your Morning, the name being a wordplay on the Zulu people. However, Kendall's was a one-man show, not a \\"zoo\\" with multiple radio personalities.) In July 1983, Shannon left Tampa to reinvent WHTZ \\"Z-100\\" in the New York City market, based out of Secaucus, New Jersey. On August 2, Shannon hosted the first Z Morning Zoo at WHTZ, soon settling into a team which included straight man Ross Brittain, newscaster Claire Stevens, public service director Professor Jonathan B. Bell, 22-year- old \\"Captain\\" Kevin on the phones, and production manager J. R. Nelson. Shannon's popular new format brought WHTZ from last place to first in just 74 days, and put longtime #1 morning DJ Don Imus in second place. When WHTZ became a huge ratings success, the name and format of the \\"Morning Zoo\\" was copied by stations across the USA. John Gorman was a program director at Cleveland rock station WMMS when they adopted the morning zoo concept in early 1984. Gorman traced the sequence of events: Tampa's WRBQ continued to run the morning zoo show after Shannon left; Wheeler teamed with Terrence McKeever and others to keep the show a success. Other US stations that adopted the morning zoo program in the early-to-mid-1980s include KKBQ-FM in Houston in 1982, WRVQ in Richmond, Virginia, in April 1983, WNIC with the \\"Harper & Gannon\\" show by early 1983, KMEL in San Francisco in early 1984, KFMB-FM in San Diego, California, by late 1984, WZOU in Boston by November 1984, WGTZ \\"Z-93\\" in Dayton, Ohio in March 1985, WKPE-FM in southeast Massachusetts in early 1985, WKRQ \\"Q102\\" and WEBN's Dawn Patrol in Cincinnati by October 1985, and WNVZ in Norfolk, Virginia in September 1985. Shows In Australia, the morning zoo format was heard on Triple M as The Cage, amongst other stations, including SAFM in Adelaide, whose version of the morning zoo was the highest rating breakfast show there between 1985 and 1990. The Don and Mike show originated as a morning zoo show at WAVA-FM in the 1980s, and retained some elements of the format. In Vancouver, British Columbia, LG73 (call sign CKLG) adopted this format for its popular morning program, led by Dean Hill, from 1985 to 1993. In Quebec City, CJMF-FM 93.3 had Le Zoo du 93 from 1985 to 1990. Not only does the show still hold a number of records in terms of ratings and market shares (a quarter-hour of 148,000 listeners), but it also skyrocketed the station to now unreachable numbers, with 573,200 listeners on a weekly basis (according to the BBM summer 1987 survey). Steve Wright introduced the format to the UK when in 1981 he started his Steve Wright in the Afternoon show on BBC Radio 1 which featured his \\"posse\\" of co-presenters and features. Chris Moyles and \\"Comedy\\" Dave Vitty also used the zoo format with great success. Their audience was measured at eight million listeners by RAJAR, and Simon Mayo also revolutionized British radio by introducing the format when on 23 May 1988 he took over The Radio 1 Breakfast Show from Mike Smith on BBC Radio 1 which also featured co-presenters including news anchor Rod McKenzie and three sidekick weather and travel girls, including Carol Dooley, Sybil Ruscoe, Jackie Brambles and Dianne Oxberry, and the show's producer Ric Blaxill who made regular speaking contributions. The programme also became known for various features, including On This Day In History, the long-running cryptic game The Identik-Hit Quiz, where Mayo and his co hosts would 'act' a short scene which cryptically led listeners to the title of a hit song, and also his Confessions feature where members of the public sought absolution for their (often frivolous or humorous) \\"sins\\". The format is used on stations of many different genres. Even Christian radio stations such as WAWZ in New Jersey have a morning zoo. Dayton, Ohio Classic Hits radio station WZLR reunited Dr. Dave Gross and Wild Bill originally from the Z Morning Zoo on WGTZ in Dayton. The show is now called The Eagle Morning Zoo.

History Kr√∂nleins Brewery was founded on February 15, 1836 when grocery businessman Anders Julius Appeltofft bought an old half-timbered hospital, or \\"curhuset\\", at Stora Torg in Halmstad, Sweden, and converted it into an office and a bar. The beer was brewed in the building next door. For the first ten years he made Svensk√∂l, a traditional sweet low-alcohol Swedish beer. Today the house is a caf√© and is in excellent condition due to a complete renovation in 2004. thumb In the beginning the business was quite modest. Every step in the production process was done manually. In 1849 new ground was bought, situated a couple of hundred meters from the brewery. On the new ground there was an old bastion from the early 17th century, placed next to the old moat. The purpose of the bastion was to protect the town from enemies from the west - hence the name \\"Wester Katt\\". The purchase of the ground had two purposes. An ice cellar was built and control was gained over the water supply. A malting for the production of malt was also built. Below the bastion was a well with spring water, where many citizens in Halmstad fetched their water. The water was of very high quality. It is from this well that Kr√∂nleins has taken its water since the start in 1836. Munich beer When Munich beer was first introduced in Sweden in 1843, it was hard to persuade people to drink it. Munich beer was too dark and not sweet enough. The man who introduced this beer in Sweden was Fredrik Rosenquist. His brewery was called \\"The German Brewery\\" and was situated in Stockholm. The taste of the new beer was less sweet and it contained more carbon dioxide. The storage time was longer and the beer itself was definitely of higher quality than \\"svensk√∂l\\". The introduction of the Munich beer was greatly helped by, for the time, modern marketing methods and the fact that the Swedish Royal Court became one of the company's biggest customers. The Queen's mother, of German heritage, had until 1843 bought her beer from Germany, but of course the German brewery around the corner became her new supplier. After only ten years Munich beer was the most popular beer in Sweden. It is worth mentioning that beer in Sweden has fought a hard battle with aquavit since medieval times. The brewers had a monopoly of the very profitable aquavit production and were not too interested in selling beer of high quality. This trend was broken with Munich beer and the Swedes finally had a good alternative to aquavit. There are conflicting sources of information as to when Appeltofft started to brew Munich beer. According to one source it was brewed from the start, but that is not very likely given the above information about the introduction in 1843. Another source says it was in the 1850s but most likely it must have been in the late 1840s. Munich beer requires longer storage time than \\"svensk√∂l\\" and we know that Kr√∂nleins had the possibility to store Munich beer in the ice cellar that was built in 1849. The fact is that the cellar was probably built for this purpose. In any case, Kr√∂nleins was well ahead in this respect compared to many other Swedish breweries. The local competitor \\"√ñstra Bryggeriet\\" did not start brewing Munich beer until 1863. The Brewery into Ltd Co thumb The founder Anders Julius Appeltofft died in 1851 of pneumonia - caught on a cold September night at a local restaurant. His widow ran the business until 1855 when their son Per Gustav Appeltofft took over, being the oldest of 8 brothers and sisters. Kr√∂nleins was by now in need of capital so the brewery was transformed into a joint stock company in 1861, which is one of the dates that can be seen on the facade of the brew house. The same year it is noted that the staff consisted of one brewer, one book-keeper, one cellar maid, nine brewer- and two stable boys as well as two more boys for cleaning the bottles etc. The business was still quite modest but a period of modernization and expansion began. The company board realized in 1867 that the cost of the water transportation by horse carriage could be lowered by building a pipeline from the well to the brewery. The project developed into Halmstad's first permanent pipeline with many subscribers to get water. The brewery also made an agreement with the fire department to always have the water reservoir filled with water in the event of fires. This was in 1870 ‚Äì 15 years before the city itself could offer such service. Pilsner beer thumb When pilsner beer was first brewed in Sweden in the 1870s, the market consisted of Munich beer that dominated the market, and a new kind of bottom-fermented beer called \\"Swedish lager\\". As perhaps many of you know, the original pilsner came from the town Pilsen in the present Czech Republic where it had been brewed for a couple of decades. The pilsner filled a gap in the Swedish beer market. Pilsner was easy to drink, less sweet with a notable hop-bitterness and lighter in colour than other beers. As is often the case, the Swedes were a bit slow in accepting a novelty and pilsner first became a success after deliberate marketing efforts were made towards the upper-class in Stockholm. However, it would still take some time until pilsner was accepted throughout Sweden. This did not happen until after World War I. Move In 1897, the company decided to move the business from Stora Torg to its present premises on \\"Wester katt\\" i.e. next to the well. A new house for brewing and malting was built in 1897-98, and it is still in use today. Apart from the brewhouse another building was built to house a fermentation basement and a cool ship. Electricity and steam entered the scene and turned the manual labour into something that more and more resembled an industry. In 1905 an electrical cooling machine was acquired which made the cooling of the wort and the fermented beer a lot easier. Before the cooling machine was taken into operation ice from frozen lakes was used. The brewing industry thumb The turn of the century was to be something of a golden age for the Swedish brewing industry, a period which will probably never be equalled, at least not by the number of breweries. In 1905 there were a total of 240 beer breweries in Sweden. Every village or town had its own local brewery. After 1905 the number of breweries diminished gradually. A number of taxes, such as malttax, were imposed on the brewing business. These taxes were increased with time and later turned into tax of the finished product in 1940. The tax of the product was then increased gradually. Not only the taxes made life hard for the brewers but also tough sales restrictions. The trend has also developed towards nationalization of the brewing industry. The reason why, is that when the state had control over the production, it was also easier to control the consumption of beer. In this tough climate the beer industry was transformed from a small-scale to a large-scale industry with only a few production units. New owner The next big change for the former Appeltofftska Brewery took place in 1920. The engineer Anders Kr√∂nlein took over the stock majority of the company. Extensive modernizations were made and the business grew. A new era began. New open fermentation tanks were bought. They were made of aluminium and now there was no need to take out the wooden vats once a year to rosin them, which took a lot of time and effort. The open fermentation tanks are still in use today. During the 1920s and 1930s machines gradually took over hard manual work like tapping, corking and labelling. For example, fully automatic tapping machines were installed. thumb The brewery was well ahead among its competitors and a lot of effort was put into product development. During the 1930s and 1940s only beer of 2.8% alcohol by volume had been brewed - pilsner. It was now time to develop a stronger beer. As the first brewery in Sweden, Kr√∂nleins began to produce a high grade strong beer in the beginning of the 1950s. The beer was given the name Three Hearts Export. In the beginning the strong beer was made solely for export, since beer of this strength was prohibited in Sweden at the time. Bottle caps became lucky-buttons in Africa Three Hearts Export was shipped by ocean and exported all the way to the United States with a shipping company called Brostr√∂ms Tenderservice. Kr√∂nlein also managed to sell his beer to Africa where the bottle caps were used in a most unexpected way. The natives of C√¥te d'Ivoire became delighted with the bottle caps with the three hearts printed on them and sewed them onto their clothes as lucky buttons. The buttons were believed to protect from evil spirits. The selling of strong beer became allowed in Sweden in 1955 and Three Hearts Export was soon one of the most sold brands of strong beers. Today Three Hearts Export is a true classic; it is still around with almost the same styling of the bottle. thumb Shortly before the next achievement, Anders Kr√∂nlein handed over to his son Hans. Hans Kr√∂nlein had studied at the most famous brewing school in Weihenstephan, Germany and holds a Diploma in Brewing. He first started as brewer in 1952 and fully succeeded his father in 1960. The next success came in 1965 when the so- called \\"mellan√∂l\\", or medium alcohol beer, was introduced in Sweden. The beer contained less alcohol than strong beer and could be sold outside the government controlled retail chain Systembolaget. This was an injection which was badly needed by the beer industry. Kr√∂nleins had a best seller with a medium strong beer called Three Hearts Middle Beer. Structural changes were made in the beer industry, which also affected Halmstad's two breweries. The competitor √ñstra Bryggeriet was bought by Kr√∂nleins in 1979. The same year Kr√∂nleins also stopped producing their own malt. thumb Hans Kr√∂nlein was the head of the company until 1991 when his two sons Carl and Tage took over. Hans remains as head of the board. Before Hans Kr√∂nlein handed over to his sons something of significance happened that supplied the finishing touch of a long and successful brewing career. He developed a beer that won first prize in the Brewing Industry International Awards 1990 for Lager type beer. The beer was called Crocodile Export Lager and was soon a success in the Swedish market, especially if you take into account the small size of the brewery. Kr√∂nleins today With regard to its owner structure, Kr√∂nleins Brewery Inc is a very stable company. The Kr√∂nlein family has had total ownership over the company since the 1920s, and it has been their firm conviction to keep it the same way in the future. The Kr√∂nleins have a long and strong brewing tradition of six generations of brewers. This tradition gives Kr√∂nleins a unique position in the Swedish brewing industry today. Not only do the Kr√∂nleins savour that tradition but also think ahead and use new technology to communicate with the market. Kr√∂nleins has f.ex. been on Internet with a homepage of their own since Nov 1995. Products The company produces a range of beers, ciders, spirits, soft drinks and water. They specialise in adding flavourings to vodka, beer, cider, etc. The cider brand is Halmstad which is produced in approx 10 different flavours including Wildberry, Dry Lime and Apple. The main soft drinks brand name is Three Hearts, a brand name which is also used for a range of beers and some bottled water. The main brand name for the water is Aqua Cristall.

History A1 Bulgaria was founded in March 1994 but was not launched commercially until September 1995 (as Citron). In 2001, M-Tel (the brand then) launched its prepayment sim cards which allowed customers to purchase credits prior to calling friends. This proved to be a great success and saw the number of customers using their network increase dramatically. The company had a market share of about 58% and 3,000,000 clients in September 2004. On 14 September 2006 M-Tel reached 4,000,000 clients. the company has 4,400,000 subscribers and its market share fell to 51.1%. Its contract customers increased to 1.7 mln, while the profit per customer dropped to 9.9 euros for Q1 2007. The operator has been owned by Telekom Austria Group since July 2005, when it was acquired for up to ‚Ç¨1.6 billion in one of Central and Eastern Europe's largest deals and one of the largest foreign investments in Austria. Mobiltel was the first Bulgarian operator to offer EDGE, UMTS, HSDPA, HSPA+ and second to offer LTE services to its clients, with video telephony services being available since 6 March 2006 in the capital Sofia and since mid-July 2006 throughout the Bulgarian Black Sea resorts. The company was the official sponsor of Bulgarian football club PFC Levski Sofia. Since 2005, the company also organizes the strong annual M-Tel Masters chess tournament, which is attended by six of the world's best International Grandmasters. Despite the difficult economic environment affecting the entire IT and Telco industry in Bulgaria, Mobiltel's performance remains stable with a customer base of 5.3 million. The postpaid subscribers increased from 61% to roughly 66%. Mobiltel's market share by end Q1/2011 stays at 49.3%. The Mtel network uses the access code 88. Until 2003, it also used the codes 89 and 87, which had been added as the network had expanded. In mid-2003, however, mobile numbers in Bulgaria increased by one digit and the M-–¢el network code returned to being 88 only. Mobiltel owns Loop, the largest virtual mobile operator operating in Bulgaria, specially designed for young customers. In 2011 Mtel created pre-paid service for cheap telephone calls, SMS and mobile Internet bob, which is available in Austria and Slovenia too. In 2012 M-tel was rebranded with a new logo, and the dash in the name was removed leaving Mtel (–ú—Ç–µ–ª) as shown in the new logo. On 28 July 2015, Mtel and Max signed a contract for national roaming. This is the first agreement for sharing networks in the Bulgarian telecom market. On 29 July 2015, Mobiltel said has agreed to buy cable TV and internet service provider Blizoo. On 18 September 2015, CPC gave green light of the deal and the merger was done by the end of the year. On 15 September 2016, Mtel became the official sponsor of the most successful Bulgarian football club CSKA Sofia. From 2016 to 2017 season Mtel became the team's principal shirt sponsor. On 14 January 2016 Mtel launched its own pay television sports pack ‚Äì MAX Sport (then under the brand Mtel Sport), consisting of two TV channels. , the company is operating under the A1 brand.  Network  A1 has built various types of networks. The company was first to launch GSM, GPRS, HSPA, HSPA+ and test LTE in Bulgaria. They also have fiber optic internet in most of the big cities (by recent acquisition of former blizoo). In 2012 after big commercials A1 (Mtel back then) announced DTH. depending on a viewer's location A1 can offer to IPTV (marketed as interactive television), CATV (former blizoo), HSPA, HSPA+, LTE and fiber internet (up to 1 Gbit/s).

It lives for between 5 and 8 months and the adults can grow up to 6 or 7 cm long with a mantle length of 3 to 4 cm. They are found in seagrass beds or areas with soft silty or muddy bottoms from Brisbane on the east coast to Shark Bay on the west, as well as around Tasmania. Southern dumpling squid are nocturnal and during the day hide in sand or mud covered in a mucus-lined coat of sediment. If disturbed acid glans can quickly remove this coat as an additional decoy to ink squirting.  Physical appearance  Like other bobtail squid, southern dumpling squid have a light organ fuelled by symbiotic bioluminescent bacteria. The light organ, which is butterfly-shaped, is situated in the mantle cavity and is used to cancel out the bobtail squid's silhouette. There are large semi-circular fins on the rear half of the mantle. Although they can change colour, they are usually an iridescent green or yellow with brown spots. The bobtail squid have four rows of suckers on each arm and both their arms and tentacles are armed with toothed horny rim. Euprymna tasmanica  Reproduction  Like many cephalopods the male can be distinguished from the female by an enlarged hectocotylus which occurs as the first left arm. Females lay 2 or 3 batches of round creamy orange eggs (25 ‚Äì 170 eggs per batch) over a few weeks towards the end of their life. Females die between a week and a fortnight after laying eggs and males die a short time after mating multiple times. Females mate with many partners and may use the sperm of more than one partner for one batch of eggs. Depending on temperature incubation can take up to four and a half months, because of this the eggs must be comparatively large to provide enough yolk for successful embryonic development. If the females are underfed while producing eggs they tend to produce fewer and smaller eggs which leads to high embryo mortality rates. Parent Southern Dumpling Squid do not look after their young however the hatchlings are highly developed when born and are capable of catching prey up to twice their size. Young are not born with the needed bacteria for their light organ and must capture them from the water column before the light organ can develop.  Naming  The southern dumpling squid is often referred to as the southern bobtail squid, however this common names also refers to a different smaller Australian species of bobtail squid which has yet to be scientifically named.

Its maximum altitude was about , which earned it the nickname stratosphere gun. The M1 gun was used by the Army for air defense from 1944 to 1960. The 120 served primarily in static defensive roles, although it had been designed to be mobile. It became obsolete with the development of anti-aircraft missiles and was phased out after 1954. History The Army first worked on a 120 mm gun after the end of World War I, with a prototype being presented in 1924. The system was considered far too heavy and expensive to be useful, and the project slowed, although it was never canceled outright. In 1938, the Army reviewed its needs for newer AA systems and decided to order new systems for both the heavy and super-heavy role. The former was filled by the new M1 90 mm gun, which replaced the earlier M3 3-inch gun then in use. For the super-heavy role, the 120 mm gun design was dusted off and mated to a new eight-wheel carriage, designated 4.7-inch M1 when it was accepted in 1940. Like the 90 mm, the M1 gun was typically operated in a battery of four guns, initially with an associated searchlight, SCR-268 radar (replaced later by the much-improved SCR-584), M10 gun director, and M4 Gun Data Computer that automatically laid the guns. The M6 Tractor was used as the prime mover. The M1 gun entered service late in World War II. One battalion of M1 guns, the 513th AAA Gun Battalion, was deployed in the Philippines in February 1945, but never fired on any hostile aircraft. After World War II ended and the Cold War with the Soviet Union began, M1 guns were deployed in many locations in the U.S. and Canada. To defend against long range Soviet Tu-4 bomber attack, the Army Anti- Aircraft Command (ARAACOM) formed 44 active duty and 22 National Guard battalions equipped with M1 guns, divided into seven brigades and 20 anti- aircraft artillery groups. Two Canadian anti-aircraft battalions were also equipped with M1 guns for the joint defense of the Soo Locks. These guns were guided by the long range Lashup Radar Network equipped with AN/CPS-5. M1 guns were deployed for the protection of nuclear production facilities, major industrial centers, strategic air force bases, and select major population centers. In 1954, the MIM-3 Nike Ajax surface-to-air missile became operational with ARAACOM. It substantially outranged the M1 gun, rendering it obsolete. ARAACOM began retiring the M1 gun from active-duty units and then from National Guard units. Then in 1957, the Soviet Union introduced the R7, its first ICBM, and the M1 gun became practically useless. By January 1960, all remaining National Guard units with M1 guns were converted to Nike missiles or deactivated.

While the 1960s extension was retracted back to its original eastern terminus around 1989, the highway was extended again in late 2004 westward along Old US 441 as part of a business route into Homer to join SR 51\\\\.

Between 1918 and 1920, the Big Six was offered only as a four-door touring car, the most popular body style for automobiles at the time. As the price of enclosed cars came down and consumers discovered the benefits of closed and semi-closed passenger compartments, a wider variety of body styles was made available beginning with the 1921 model year. By 1926, the Big Six was available in a variety of body styles, including a dual-cowl Phaeton and a Berline (sedan). 1918 and 1919 Big Sixes were powered by Studebaker's 354 in¬≥ (5.8-liter) Straight-6 engine, which produced at 2000 rpm. By 1926, the engine was delivering at 2400 rpm. The car's wheelbase was varied between 1918 and 1926 when the car was available in either short or long wheelbases. Studebaker's EK Big Six was popular with rum runners, for its large size and ability to reach up to ; its C$3000 price was not a deterrent. Windsor Public Library online (retrieved 13 June 2017) 1920s production 1923 Big Six In the 1920s, twelve of the fourteen Arizona counties issued Studebakers to their sheriffs, because of their reputation for power, reliability, and ability to withstand hard use and bad roads. In 1925, the company published a pamphlet about the Arizona sheriffs' Studebakers, and named their Big Six Sport Phaeton model the Sheriff. One of the Arizona sheriffs' Big Six cars has been restored, and is on display at the Arizona Historical Society museum in Tucson.History of Pima County Sheriff's Department At the 1924 New York Auto Show, Studebaker featured a 1918 Big Six that had a verified odometer reading of over , as a testament to the longevity and durability of Studebaker vehicles. Big Six President 1927 Big Six President limousine In 1927, the model gained the transitional model name Big Six President as Studebaker began the process of converting all of its model names away from engine-type-based, and towards the more evocative Dictator (Standard Six) and Commander (Special Six). In the case of the Big Six President, 1928 would mark the introduction of Studebaker's famed 313-in¬≥ Straight-8 which developed at 2600 rpm. The larger straight-six engine was utilised in the GB Commander before being replaced with a 248-in¬≥ engine in 1929, marking the end of the line for the famous Big Six. These sixes were the last descendants of rugged cars designed for poor roads in the early 20th century‚Äîloaded with torque and massively strong in construction. They were not suited to the higher cruising speeds which were made possible by better roads in later years.Maurice D.

Patricia Piccinini (born 1965 in Freetown, Sierra Leone) is an Australian artist who works in a variety of media, including painting, video, sound, installation, digital prints, and sculpture. Her works focus on \\"unexpected consequences\\", conveying concerns surrounding bio-ethics and help visualize future dystopias. In 2003, Piccinini represented Australia at the 50th Venice Biennale with a hyperrealist sculpture of her distinctive anthropomorphic animals. In 2016 The Art Newspaper named Piccinini with her \\"grotesque-cum-cute, hyper-real genetics fantasies in silicone\\" the most popular contemporary artist in the world after a show in Rio de Janeiro attracted over 444,000 visitors. Academia Piccinini begun studying economics at Australian National University. Later she completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Painting at the Victorian College of the Arts in 1991. In 2016 she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Visual and Performing Arts by the University of Melbourne's Victorian College of the Arts and appointed their Enterprise Professor. In 2014 she received the Artist Award from the Melbourne Art Foundation's Awards for the Visual Arts. Works  2000 to 2011  According to her 2002 National Gallery of Victoria biography: > Piccinini has an ambivalent attitude towards technology and she uses her > artistic practice as a forum for discussion about how technology impacts > upon life. She is keenly interested in how contemporary ideas of nature, the > natural and the artificial are changing our society. Specific works have > addressed concerns about biotechnology, such as gene therapy and ongoing > research to map the human genome... she is also fascinated by the mechanisms > of consumer culture.\\" In 2002, Piccinini presented 'Still Life with Stem Cells', which features a series of flesh-like masses. As she herself says: \\"Stems cells are base cellular matter before it is differentiated into specific kinds of cells like skin, liver, bone or brain. Pure unexpressed potential, they contain the possibility for transformation into anything. They are the basic data format of the organic world. Like digital data, their specificity lies in that, while they are intrinsically nothing, they can become anything. They are biomatter for the digital age. I am interested in how this changes our idea of the body. Already our understanding of the human genome leads us to imagine that we understand the construction of the body at its most intimate level; the stem cell provides us with a generic, plastic material from which we can construct it. In the last ten years, the body has gone from something that is uniquely produced to something that can be reproduced. This transformation has already occurred, with very little fuss given its magnitude. The question of whether this is a good or a bad thing is both too simplistic and a little academic. As with so much of this biotechnology, the extraordinary has already become the ordinary. The real question is 'what are we going to do with it'. Still life with Stem Cells is one possible answer.\\" In 2003, Piccinini represented Australia at the 50th Venice Biennale. The work exhibited was 'We Are Family', an exhibition which displayed humanlike mutant figures behaving like humans. 'The Long-Awaited' (2008) was a later work attempting to explore the theme of empathy through a lifelike sculpture of a child cradling a manatee-human hybrid.  2012 to 2013  \\"The Skywhale\\", commissioned for the centenary of Canberra. The Skywhale was a work commissioned by the ACT Government for its Centenary year. The ABC described the work as a \\"hot air balloon in the shape of a tortoise-like animal featuring huge dangling udders made from four hectares of nylon\\". The budget for the project was $300,000 and has been the subject of comments made by ACT Chief Ministers Jon Stanhope and Andrew Barr.  2014 to 2015  alt= In a 2014 interview with the Sydney Morning Herald, Piccinini said of her work, \\"It's about evolution, nature ‚Äì how nature is such a wonderful thing, we're just here to witness it, it's not here for us ‚Äì genetic engineering, changing the body.\\" Following her 2014 win in the Melbourne Art Foundation's Awards, she went on to say that: > The thing about this award on some levels is that my work ... all of it has > this first impact, the sort of impact of spectacle. It's beautifully made, > strong, aesthetic, so people are interested in that and it draws them in, > and then they get interested in the idea. It takes a while to get to the > idea. It's not easy. So this award says, \\"We get it, we get what you're > trying to do, we've gone beyond the surface, we can see that there are ideas > underneath, and these ideas are about the opportunity for connection\\". In 2015 she presented as part of a group exhibition titled Menagerie at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, Melbourne. Graham: a 2016 sculpture for the TAC's public safety campaign 'Towards Zero'.  2016  In 2016, the TAC commissioned Piccinini to work in collaboration with Dr. David Logan, a senior research fellow at the Monash University Accident Research Centre, and trauma surgeon Dr. Christian Kenfield, for \\"Project Graham\\" - as part of the TAC's road safety campaign Towards Zero.Henry, Lauren; Tribe, Matt (16 September 2016) \\"Unusual sculpture set to challenge regional Victorians' thinking about road safety\\", ABC. Retrieved 19 April 2020. \\"Graham\\", a lifelike, interactive sculpture, highlights how vulnerable the human body is to the forces involved in auto accidents. As the TAC explains: \\"Graham highlights the changes we need to make to protect ourselves from our own mistakes on the road. At the centre of this system is the belief that human health is more important than anything else, he is the embodiment of the Towards Zero vision.\\"  2018  The joint exhibition 'Patricia Piccinini & Joy Hester Through Love ...' at TarraWarra Museum of Art included a new site specific work 'Sanctuary': combining a sculpture of a pair of embracing anthropomorphic bonobo figures of silicone, fiberglass and hair; with a drawing on paper and digital wall print of multiple human limbs forming a horizon. Responses Australian art critic John McDonald gives two reasons for disliking Piccinini's body of work: her method of employing artisans to create her designs: \\"The problem with this method is that the artist's role becomes that of a factory manager.\\" and her engagement with issues such as cross-species relationships: \\"Given the current state of the planet, in which political leaders are allowing the most blatant forms of racism and ethnic tension to become normalised, Piccinini's interspecies fantasies seem horribly far-fetched.\\" Screen studies professor and animal ethicist Barbara Creed says Piccinini's work is loving and heals wounds of divisions: \\"In profound ways, Piccinini's artistic practice calls to the spectator to consider a new way of being, a new form of opening out an embracing difference, through new ways of looking ... that encourages us to look alongside and with her creations while reminding us we are all animals.\\"Barbara Creed, 'Entangled looking : The crisis of the animal', Artlink vol 38, no 1, March 2018, pp8-22.

It is the poorest municipality in the state. Location Buritin√≥polis is located in the V√£o do Paran√£ statistical micro-region in the area near Simol√¢ndia and Alvorada do Norte. It is close to the important BR-020 highway, which connects Bras√≠lia with Salvador. Neighboring municipalities are Posse, Simol√¢ndia, Alvorada do Norte, Mamba√≠, and Damian√≥polis. The distance to Goi√¢nia is 466 km. Highway connections are made by BR-153 / An√°polis / Alex√¢nia / BR-060 / Planaltina / Formosa / BR-020 / Simol√¢ndia / GO-236.Sepin Transporte Demographics *Geometric Growth Rate 1996/2007: 0.17% *Population density: 12.84 inhabitants/km2 *Urban population: 1,842 *Rural population: 1,600 Sepin Economy The main economic activities are cattle raising for meat and farming, especially soybeans and corn. Most of the inhabitants either have no work or are employed in subsistence farming. In 2007 there were 15 commercial units and no banks. The absence of investments in the town leaves the inhabitants without the chance of a job and many, mainly the young, leave the town to try to find a job that would allow them to survive. There were no hospitals in 2007. There were 100 automobiles in 2007, which was one automobile for every 34 inhabitants.

The two supermarkets are comparable to the little grocery stores in the slums of the large urban centers and the bars can only provide income for their owners. The agricultural activities provide few jobs since the small rural landowners practice subsistence farming and the large landowners opt for extensive cattle raising, which requires few workers. Urban erosion is a worry for all. It has already destroyed a large part of the main avenue that runs parallel to BR-020, the highway that cuts the city in two. With no money to build drains and pave the streets on both side of the highway, the city government is waiting for help from the state government.

From the 17th century the church was a place of worship for parishioners on Dublin's north-side, before it was closed in 1986. The church has since been deconsecrated and the building is now a pub and restaurant. The parish also had a chapel of ease - St Mary's - off Dorset Street, more commonly known as \\"The Black Church\\". History St. Mary's Abbey close to the location of the current building From the early middle-ages, the north-side of Dublin was served by the parish of St. Michan's and the abbey of St. Mary. After the dissolution of the monasteries, the abbey was all but closed, and in the late 17th century, the parish of St. Mary's was formed. As recorded by the original register book of the \\"Parish of St. Maries\\" (St. Marys), the parish \\"was separated from the Parish of St. Michans, & made a district Parish by Act of Parliament\\" on 20 November 1697. The current building was designed in 1697 by Sir William Robinson, and the foundation stone was laid in 1700. Some of the church construction was overseen by Thomas Burgh, and the church is notable as the first in Dublin to be built with galleries. It was consecrated in 1701. The organ of the church was built by Renatus Harris. The parish register records that the first rector was Peter Broun (or Browne), later Provost of Trinity College, and that the first church wardens were Robert Rochfort, the Attorney General, and Allen Brodrick, Solicitor General. The church closed in 1986 and became a retail outlet after deconsecration. It was later converted to use as a pub and restaurant. Originally named the \\"John M. Keating Bar\\", the pub changed hands in 2007 and is now simply called \\"The Church\\". The churchyard was converted into Wolfe Tone Square, a public park where the gravestones can be seen stacked up at the southern end. Notable parishioners and burials Arthur Guinness was married in St Mary's in 1761. Notable baptisms in the church include Se√°n O'Casey in 1880 and Theobald Wolfe Tone in 1763. (Wolfe Tone was born at 44 Stafford Street nearby. Stafford Street was later renamed after Wolfe Tone.)Detail taken from copies of Writings of Theobald Wolfe Tone edited by T W Moody, R B MacDowel and C J Woods published by Clarendon Press (USA). Copyright date, 1998. . The Earl of Charlemont was baptized in the church in 1728, and Richard Brinsley Sheridan in 1751. Records show that burials in the church vaults include Anne, daughter of the Bishop of Meath (interred 14 December 1725), the Rev Rawlinson Foord (also interred 14 December 1725), and Charles Campbell (interred in the chancel vault 2 November 1765). All the remains of those in the vault or crypts were later cremated and placed at St. Michans. This process was supervised by a Dublin Corporation Environmental Officer in consultation with the Representative Body of the Church of Ireland.1987 records of J. & C.

Dates for the Yoldia sea are obtained mainly by radiocarbon dating material from ancient sediments and shore lines and from clay-varve chronology. They tend to vary by as much as a thousand years, but a good estimate is 10,300 ‚Äì 9500 radiocarbon years BP, equivalent to ca 11,700-10,700 calendar years BP. The sea ended gradually when isostatic rise of Scandinavia closed or nearly closed its effluents, altering the balance between saline and fresh water. The Yoldia Sea became Ancylus Lake. The Yoldia Sea stage had three phases of which only the middle phase had brackish water. The name of the sea is adapted from the obsolete name of the bivalve, Portlandia arctica (previously known as Yoldia arctica), found around Stockholm. This bivalve requires cold saline water. It characterizes the middle phase of the Yoldia Sea, during which saline water poured into the Baltic, before the acceleration of glacial melting. Description Post- glacial sea level, combined with isostatic rebound, resulted in a sequence of Baltic lakes and seas. The Baltic Ice Lake, the Yoldia Sea, the Ancylus Lake and the Littorina Sea are four recognized stages in the postglacial progression of the Baltic basin ‚Äì there are also transition periods which can be considered as substages. From earliest to most recent they run: * The Baltic Ice Lake ‚Äì fresh water proglacial lake with level greater than sea level ‚Äì dammed by glacial ice until the ice dam broke free at the north slope of Billingen uplands ‚Äì the lake level then dropped ~ 26 meters to sea level - ~ 10,000 years before the present (BP). * Transition period - Between the Baltic Ice Lake and the Yoldia Sea there was a transient lake stage before the ingression of salt water. This lasted ~300 years (292 - 309 annual deposition varves are seen in the geologic record, depending on where measured). * The Yoldia Sea ‚Äì a short lived connection with the sea across south-central Sweden over the N√§rke strait ‚Äì approximately 10,000 to 9,600 BP.Some variation in the date reconstructions exist among various sources. * The Ancylus Lake ‚Äì creation of a fresh water lake through uplift, which blocked the N√§rke strait- 9,600 to 7,800 ŒíP. * The Littorina Sea ‚Äì with the rise in sea level and the submergence of the √òresund strait, the Baltic again communicated with the North Sea beginning ~ 7,800 ŒíP to present. This is sometimes split into substages: :* The Mastogloia Sea - a substage sometimes used to distinguish the period between 8000 and 7000 years ago when the Baltic became distinctly brackish - during this period the English Channel and the Danish straits circulation was established, increasing Atlantic water inflow. :* The Limnea Sea ‚Äì a substage sometimes used to distinguish the transition of the Baltic Sea to a more stagnant phase, which currently exists ‚Äì about 2,500 BP. The Baltic Ice Lake came to an end when it overflowed through central Sweden and drained, a process complete by about 10,300 BP (radiocarbon years). The straits through the present Stockholm region (via Lake V√§nern and the Strait of N√§rke) to the Atlantic were the only outlet at that time. When lake level reached sea level the difference in salinity caused a backflow from the North Sea, creating saline regions in which the marine bivalve Yoldia flourished. This phase lasted until about 10,000 BP. Subsequently, increased melting of the glacier provided additional fresh water and the lake became stratified (meromictic), with salt water on the bottom and fresh on top. Over the life of the sea and from location to location the salinity was a variable. Whether it is possible to speak of stages of salinity that would apply uniformly to the whole sea is debatable. At about 10,000 BP, the exit continued to rise and the lake/sea broke through Denmark creating the first Great Belt channels. The total opening was less than 1 km wide and included two channels at the northern end. The Great Belt channels was blocked again by rising land from the post-glacial rebound that created Ancylus Lake. Geographically, the Gulf of Bothnia remained under the ice. The Gulf of Finland was open but most of Finland was an archipelago, over which debris carried by glacial streams gradually spread. A land bridge joined Germany to southern Sweden through Denmark. Relieved of its weight of ice, Finland rose gradually and unevenly from the sea. Parts of the Yoldia shoreline are above sea level today while other parts remain below. The Yoldia Sea toward its end was about 30m below current sea level. A channel at the location of the Neva River connected Yoldia Sea to Lake Ladoga. The Yoldia Sea existed entirely within the Boreal Blytt-Sernander period. The forests and species lining its shores were boreal. Mesolithic cultures continued to occupy Denmark/south Sweden and the southern shores of the sea. The sea as an ecologic system came to an end when Scandinavia rose sufficiently to block the flow through the Stockholm area and the saline balance shifted toward a lacustrine ecology once again.

The chain was headquartered in Newark, New Jersey. History  1892 - 1912  Newark was known for manufacturing in the last half of the 19th century. By 1892, Newark was the forth largest American city and it manufactured products from leather to jewelry along with it being a rail hub. It also had a large Jewish population. It was these factors that lead Felix Fuld, Louis M. Frank, and Louis Bamberger to found the store on Dec 13, 1892 on Market Street on the corner of Halsey Street in Newark, New Jersey, taking over the location of a bankrupt store Hill & Craig. Fuld and Frank were Bamberger's brothers-in-law.  1912 - 1929  On October 16, 1912 the company opened its flagship store, designed by Jarvis Hunt, at 131 Market Street in downtown Newark. The historic building once ranked among the nation's largest department stores; after an expansion in 1929 it was the nation's sixth largest. The massive building covered an entire city block, bounded by Market, Washington, Bank and Halsey Streets - 1.2 million square feet. The phone exchange, 565 was devoted solely to Bamberger's, with local direct-dial numbers for most of New Jersey's suburbs for telephone orders, known as \\"TeleService\\". The building's loading dock was located well below ground on the fourth-basement level. Two massive elevators carried fully loaded 33 ft trucks from Washington Street down to the loading docks. The store had over 200 departments over 9 floors, and 2 basement floors. There was a restaurant on the 10th floor. The layout of the store changed over time but one layout of floor departments can be seen here. Bamberger's had its own Newark Public Library branch and US Post Office branch. It sold customized linens, engraved jewelry, furs and other speciality items.  1929-1959  In June 1929 Bamberger's was purchased by R.H. Macy Co, but the name remained Bamberger's. In the years immediately following World War II, the store was reorganized to become more \\"mainstream\\". In 1955, the tenth-floor restaurant complex was leased to the private Downtown Club. Dining service for customers continued at The Dinette, a counter style room on the first basement level and snack bars on the first and fourth floors. Eventually the lower-level eatery was remodeled into a formal restaurant named the Garden State Tea Room.  1960-1986  The 1960s and 1970s saw expansion throughout the state of New Jersey and into the Greater Philadelphia metropolitan area, and by the 1980s there were branches opened in the Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan area. On October 5, 1986, the Bamberger's stores adopted the name Macy's New Jersey, and in 1988 Macy's New Jersey was consolidated with sister division Macy's New York to form Macy's Northeast (now Macy's, Inc.). As northern New Jersey's population grew, Bamberger's followed the suburban population aggressively. Suburban branch stores of L. Bamberger & Co. were built in other New Jersey locations: downtown Morristown, Plainfield, and at Princeton, New Jersey. According to Greg Hatala, for nj.com, \\"With the post-World War II population shift towards the suburbs of major cities, Bamberger's built additional stores in locations such as East Brunswick, Garden State Plaza, Monmouth Mall, Nanuet Mall, Ocean County Mall, and Menlo Park Mall. In 1970, the East Brunswick location became an anchor store for the Brunswick Square Mall\\". Newark store, airborne voice. With studio on the 6th floor and showy antenna on the roof, Bamberger's launched WOR to sell more radios. Sales volume at the downtown Newark store was affected by the Newark civil unrest of 1967 -- sales space was decreased and Newark became a \\"value oriented\\" store. Evening hours were eliminated downtown by 1979.  1986-Today  In 1986, all Bamberger's stores were renamed Macy's, and the Newark store operated as Macy's until it was closed in 1992. Today the building serves the telecommunication, colocation, and computer support industries.  WOR Radio  WOR radio was established by Bamberger Broadcasting Service in 1922. The broadcast studio was located on the sixth floor of its downtown headquarters It was the first radio station on the East Coast to broadcast opera and a morning gym class in the 1920s. Its FM station, W2XOR (then W71NY, now WEPN-FM) began broadcasting in 1940 or 1941. On October 11, 1949, WOR-TV (channel 9) signed on the air, becoming the last of the New York metropolitan area VHF television stations to begin operations; in the same year, Bamberger was re-incorporated to General Teleradio, in part due to General Tire and Rubber's increased investment in the station. Transmission was from the WOR TV Tower in North Bergen, New Jersey, until 1953, and from the Empire State Building thereafter. In 1952, General Tire acquired General Teleradio from Macy's, merging it with the Don Lee Network to form General Tire's broadcasting division.\\"WOR merger; General Tire gets MBS control.\\" Broadcasting ‚Äì Telecasting, January 21, 1952, pg. 25.

He played college football at Michigan and was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fourth round of the 2006 NFL Draft. Avant has also been a member of the Carolina Panthers and Kansas City Chiefs. Early years Avant attended Carver Military Academy in Chicago, Illinois, graduating in 2002. He spent his freshman year of high school in Decatur, IL at MacArthur High School (Decatur, Illinois). While in high school at Carver, Avant played both on defense, as a free safety, and offense, as a wide receiver. He set school records for receptions (148), receiving yards (2,150), touchdowns (37), and interceptions (18). After his senior season, he was named a High School All-American at free safety. He played in the 2002 U.S. Army All-American Bowl. College career At the University of Michigan, Avant played as a wide receiver and on special teams. He played sparingly as a freshman, but as a sophomore emerged as the Wolverines' number-two receiver, behind Braylon Edwards. During his sophomore season in 2003, Avant caught 47 passes for 772 yards. As a junior, he was the team's second leading receiver. In his senior year, Avant led the team in receptions (82), receiving yards (1,007), and receiving touchdowns (eight). In his final two seasons, Avant was named as a candidate for the Fred Biletnikoff Award, given to the nation's top receiver. After his senior season, he was named an honorable mention All-American and was given the Bo Schembechler Award as Michigan's most valuable player. Professional career Philadelphia Eagles Avant was drafted in the fourth round of the 2006 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles traded a sixth round draft pick and tackle Artis Hicks to the Minnesota Vikings for the pick used to take Avant. In a post-draft interview, Eagles head coach Andy Reid said Avant \\"has great hands, toughness, leadership; he's very intelligent and a good route runner.\\" Scouting reports projected him as a consistent possession receiver who lacked the speed to be a deep threat. As a part of the Eagles crowded receiving corps, Avant saw limited playing time with the offense in his rookie season. He had his best performance‚Äîfour receptions for forty yards and one touchdown‚Äîin the final game of the season, while the Eagles rested their starters for the playoffs. After the 2009 season, in which he set new career-highs in all three categories with 41 receptions for 587 yards and 3 touchdowns, Avant was named to the USA Today All-Joe Team for his stellar play in the slot position. 32 of Avant's 37 catches on third down resulted in a first down. He was re-signed to a five- year contract on March 8, 2010. He was named the Eagles' Ed Block Courage Award recipient for 2010. Avant was released from the Philadelphia Eagles on March 4, 2014. The move was unanticipated and came shortly after re-signing Riley Cooper and Jeremy Maclin. Carolina Panthers On April 7, 2014, Avant signed a one-year deal with the Carolina Panthers. In week 2 against the Detroit Lions, Avant scored his first touchdown with the Panthers in a 24-7 win, finishing the game with five catches for 54 yards as well. It was Cam Newton's first touchdown pass of the season as he had not played in week 1.Cam Newton, Panthers top Lions to improve to 2-0 On November 18, 2014, Avant was released by the Panthers.Panthers cut receiver Jason Avant Coach Ron Rivera stated that Avant was released to allow more opportunities for rookie receiver Philly Brown.http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/panthers-release-avant-place- chandler-on-ir-111814 Kansas City Chiefs Avant signed with the Kansas City Chiefs on November q 2014, reuniting him with his former Eagles coach Andy Reid.

Saar has been called \\"a legend\\" in the world of contemporary art. She is a visual storyteller and an accomplished printmaker. Saar was a part of the Black Arts Movement in the 1970s, which engaged myths and stereotypes about race and femininity.Miranda, Carolina A. \\"For Betye Saar, there's no dwelling on the past\\", Los Angeles Times, Retrieved July 28, 2018. Her work is considered highly political, as she challenged negative ideas about African-Americans throughout her career; Betye Saar is best known for her art work that critiques American racism toward blacks. She is represented by Los Angeles based gallery Roberts Projects.  Personal life  Betye Saar was born Betye Irene Brown on July 30, 1926 to Jefferson Maze Brown and Beatrice Lillian Parson in Los Angeles, California. Both parents attended the University of California, Los Angeles, where they met. Saar spent her early years in Los Angeles. After her father's death in 1931, Saar and her mother, brother, and sister moved in with her paternal grandmother, Irene Hannah Maze in the Watts neighborhood in Los Angeles. The family then moved to Pasadena, California, to live with Saar's maternal great- aunt Hatte Parson Keys and her husband Robert E. Keys. Growing up, Saar collected various ephemera and regularly created and repaired objects. Her college education began with art classes at Pasadena City College and continued at the University of California, Los Angeles, after receiving a tuition award from an organization that raised funds to send minority students to universities. Saar received a B.A. in design in 1947. She went on to graduate studies at California State University, Long Beach, University of Southern California, California State University, Northridge, and American Film Institute. During her time in graduate school, she married Richard Saar and gave birth to three daughters: Tracye, Alison and Lezley Saar.  Artistic career   Early work  Saar started her adult life as a social worker and then later pursued her passion in art. She began her graduate education in 1958, originally working towards a career in teaching design. However, a printmaking class she took as an elective changed the direction of her artistic interests. She described printmaking as her \\"segue from design into fine arts.\\" In Saar's early work she collected racist imagery and continued throughout her career. She was inspired to create assemblages by a 1967 exhibition by found object sculptor, Joseph Cornell. She was also greatly influenced by Simon Rodia's Watts Towers, which she witnessed being built in her childhood. Saar said that she was \\"fascinated by the materials that Simon Rodia used, the broken dishes, sea shells, rusty tools, even corn cobs‚Äîall pressed into cement to create spires. To me, they were magical.\\" She began to create work that consisted of found objects arranged within boxes or windows, with items that drew from various cultures to reflect her own mixed ancestry: African-American, Irish, and Native American.  Rejection of white feminism and reclaiming the black female body  Saar was raised by her Aunt Hattie, who influenced her identity as a black woman. Saar described her Aunt as a woman with dignity and poise, which impacted her depiction of the black female body. This impact is evident in a work Saar dedicated to her Aunt titled, Record For Hattie, 1972\\\\. Saar's rejection of white feminism initially pushed her artistic focus on the black male but in the 1970s she shifted her focus to the black female body. Record For Hattie is a mixed media assemblage made from an antique jewelry box. Inside the top of the jewelry box is a broken picture frame containing a faded picture of a woman, representing her Aunt Hattie. Surrounding the picture frame rose materials are sewn along with a red and white star and crescent moon pendent. In the bottom of the jewelry box there is a metal cross on the right side, a red leather wallet in the middle, on top is an image of child, and on the left there are sewing materials. During the 1970s Saar responded to the racism, fetishization, and eroticization of the black female body by reclaiming the black female body. Saar's work resisted the artistic style of primitivism, as well as the white feminist movement that refused to address issues of race. Saar's work is a result of the convergence of black power, spirituality and mysticism, and feminism, as seen in Black Girl's Window, 1969., Black Girl's Window is an assemblage piece made from an old window, in which the painted silhouette of a girl presses her face and hands against the pane. Above her head are nine smaller window panes arranged three by three, which display various symbols and images, including moons and stars, a howling wolf, a sketched skeleton, an eagle with the word \\"love\\" across its chest, and a tintype woman. In the 1960s, Saar began collecting images of Aunt Jemima, Uncle Tom, Little Black Sambo, and other stereotyped African-American figures from folk culture and advertising of the Jim Crow era. She incorporated them into collages and assemblages, transforming them into statements of political and social protest. The Liberation of Aunt Jemima is one of her most notable works from this era. In this mixed-media assemblage, Saar utilized the stereotypical mammy figure of Aunt Jemima to subvert traditional notions of race and gender. \\"It‚Äôs like they abolished slavery but they kept black people in the kitchen as Mammy jars,\\" Saar says of what drove her to make the piece. \\"I had this Aunt Jemima, and I wanted to put a rifle and a grenade under her skirts. I wanted to empower her. I wanted to make her a warrior. I wanted people to know that black people wouldn‚Äôt be enslaved by that.\\" Saar's assemblage is laid inside of a shoebox-sized frame, plastered with Aunt Jemima advertisements. A caricatured sculpture of Aunt Jemima presents a notepad with a photograph of a Mammy with a white baby depicted. The Aunt Jemima sculpture holds a broom and a rifle, subverting her happy servant and caregiver stereotype by way of a militant alter ego who demands her own agency and power. A large, clenched fist, echoing the black power symbol, is collaged over and partially obscuring the Mammy photograph, recognizing the aggressive and radical means used by African-American activists in the 1970s to fight for their rights. Aunt Jemima is liberated through transformation from a racist domestic caricature into an image of black power.  Assemblage and installation  Saar's lifelong habit of scouring flea markets and yard sales deepened her exposure to the many racial stereotypes and demeaning depictions of blacks to be found among the artifacts of American commercial and consumer culture, such as advertisements, marketing materials, knickknacks, sheet music, and toys. Three years later, she produced a series of more than twenty pieces that, in her own words, ‚Äúexploded the myth‚Äù of such imagery, beginning with her seminal portrait of Aunt Jemima. In the 1970s, Saar moved on to explore ritual and tribal objects from Africa as well as items from African-American folk traditions. In boxed assemblages, she combined shamanistic tribal fetishes with images and objects intended to evoke the magical and the mystical. When her great-aunt died in 1974, Saar acquired family memorabilia and created a series of more personal and intimate assemblages that incorporated nostalgic mementos of her great-aunt's life. She arranged old photographs, letters, lockets, dried flowers, and handkerchiefs in shrine-like boxes to suggest memory, loss, and the passage of time. This became a body of work she referred to as her \\"nostalgic series.\\" In 1977, Saar created a piece named Spirit Catcher. It was inspired by and looks like a traditional craft item used in rituals, but was personally invented by her. She claims that although the object is not authentically sourced, it still has magical qualities. It is made from bones and straw. There is a mirror on the top of the artwork that could be interpreted as an evil eye against racism. In the early 1980s, Saar taught in Los Angeles at UCLA and the Otis Art Institute. In her own work she approached a larger, room-sized scale, and created site-specific installations. These included altar-like shrines exploring the relationship between technology and spirituality, and incorporated her interests in mysticism and Voodoo. Through the pairing of computer chips with mystical amulets and charms, these monumental constructions suggested the need for an alliance of both systems of knowledge: the technical and the spiritual. Saar continues to live and work in Los Angeles, working primarily in found object sculpture. She has been awarded honorary doctorate degrees by California College of Arts and Crafts, California Institute of the Arts, Massachusetts College of Art, Otis College of Art and Design, and San Francisco Art Institute. As of 2016, she celebrated her work with a couple parties and a solo show of new work at Roberts and Tilton Gallery. = The Liberation of Aunt Jemima = Betye Saar's 1972 artwork The Liberation of Aunt Jemima was inspired by a knick knack she found of Aunt Jemima although it seems like a painting, it is a three dimensional mixed media assemblage 11 3/4\\" x 8\\" x 3/4\\". The journal Blacks in Higher Education states that \\"her painting offered a detailed history of the black experience in America\\". Saar shows Aunt Jemima exaggerated in every way by stereotypes. She wears a large exaggerated colored dress, along with a bright checkered head piece. Her skin is depicted as really black, her eyes are large bulging out of her head. Her lips are large and highlighted with red color. She draws out the stereotype of being black. Holding a broom in one hand showing they were only good for cleaning. The woman also stands on cotton representing slavery. The Woman's Art Journal states: \\"African-American artists as diverse as Betye Saar reclaim and explore their identity. ‚ÄòNot good enough‚Äô and ‚ÄòBut good enough to serve‚Äô.\\" In her 2016 article \\"Influences\\" for Frieze (magazine), Saar explains directly about some of her artistic choices in the piece: \\"I found a little Aunt Jemima mammy figure, a caricature of a black slave, like those later used to advertise pancakes. She had a broom in one hand and, on the other side, I gave her a rifle. In front of her, I placed a little postcard, of a mammy with a mulatto child, which is another way black women were exploited during slavery. I used the derogatory image to empower the black woman by making her a revolutionary, like she was rebelling against her past enslavement\\" In the book Parodise of Ownership by Richard Schur states, \\"Saar deployed Aunt Jemima‚Äôs image to promote cultural nationalism during the 1960s and 1970s[‚Ä¶] sought to correct the injustice done by over one hundred years of stereotyped advertising and depicts Aunt Jemima in an angry, defiant, and/ or rebellious poses.\\" She wanted to promote support for political independence and break stereotypes used to describe black women. The artwork was originally inspired by the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In \\"The Women‚Äôs Art Journal Betye Saar: Extending the Frozen Monument\\", James Cristen Steward states: \\"Against the backdrop of pancake packaging is a grinning popped-eye 'Mammy\\" with a broom in one hand and a rifle in the other. In the foreground another vintage caricature of a jaunty, almost flirtatious Mammy, one arm balancing a willing white child against her corset hourglass waste she simply allows the derogatory images to speak for themselves\\". The broom symbolizes the domesticity that black women were forced to occupy jobs in serving, confining them to specific places. White people's perspective on black women was that they were only good for serving others. She portrays through her art the two representations of black women, how stereotypes portray them, defeminizing and desexualizing them and reality. Saar's intention for having the stereotype of the mammy holding a rifle to symbolize that black women are strong and can endure anything, a representation of a warrior. Saar has stated, that \\"the reasoning behind this decision is to empower black women and not let the narrative of a white person determine how a black women should view herself\\". As you look closer to Saar's artwork you start depicting the hidden additions that can not be seen by a quick glance. The portrait in front represents the black women and their black power. She stands confidently and happy, holding a white baby. As you look at her clothing it seems that she wears a dark skirt but by taking a closer look it can be seen that the woman is not wearing a skirt but her pride. She stands on a black hand in the form of a fist representing black power. In addition, Saar is encouraging black women to be strong, beautiful, and not let white narrative define them as black women.  Political activism  In the late 1960s, her focus turned to the civil rights movement and issues of race. Black women artists such as Faith Ringgold, Betye Saar, Adrian Piper, Howardena Pindell, and Barbara Chase-Riboud explored the African-American identities and actively rejected art world racism, while simultaneously being drawn to the cause of women's liberation. Saar, in her artistic journey through various artistic and activist communities from black nationalist to black feminist and womanist, maintained a \\"mobile of identity\\" that permitted her to interact freely with each group. Saar met with other black women artists at Suzanne Jackson's Gallery 32 in 1970. The resulting group show was titled Sapphire (You've Come a Long Way, Baby). This was likely the first contemporary African-American women's exhibition in California, and included watercolorist Sue Irons, printmaker Yvonne Cole Meo, painter Suzanne Jackson, pop artist Eileen Abdulrashid, Gloria Bohanon, and Saar. When asked about the politics behind her art in a 2015 interview with writer Shelley Leopold, Saar stated, \\"I don't know how politics can be avoided. If you happen to be a young Black male, your parents are terrified that you're going to be arrested‚Äîif they hang out with a friend, are they going to be considered a gang? That kind of fear is one you have to pay attention to. It's not comfortable living in the United States. I'm born in Los Angeles, with middle class parents and so I never really had to be in a situation that tense. My grandmother lived in Watts and it's still really poor down there. People just do the best they can.\\" Letter Campaign In the late 1990s, Saar was a recognizable and vocal critic of artist Kara Walker‚Äôs work. Kara Walker created artworks that some scholars said exhibited \\"the psychological dimension of stereotypes and the obscenity of the American racial unconscious\\". Walker's controversial works included Gone, An Historical Romance of a Civil War as it Occurred Between the Dusky Thighs of One Young Negress and Her Heart (1994), and The End of Uncle Tom and Grand Allegorical Tableau of Eva in Heaven (1995). The shocking images, her supporters said, challenged racist and stereotypical images of African Americans by offering stark images of the degradation of African Americans. Other critics, such as Saar and Howardena Pindell, disagreed with Walker's approach and believed the artist was reinforcing racism and racist stereotypes of African-American life. In an NPR Radio interview, Saar \\"felt the work of Kara Walker was sort of revolting and negative and a form of betrayal to the slaves, particularly women and children, and that it was basically for the amusement and the investment of the white art establishment\\". The difference in age between Saar and her contemporaries and Walker can explain the older critics‚Äô reactions to Walker's work. When Walker received the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Genius Award in 1997, Saar wrote letters to people in the art industry, protesting the award and asking, \\"Are African-Americans being betrayed under the guise of art?\\"  Solo exhibitions  * 1973 California State University, Los Angeles, California. * 1975 Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, New York. * 1976 Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut and Monique Knowlton Gallery, New York, New York. * 1977 Baun-Silverman Gallery, Los Angeles, California and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, California. * 1979 Baum- Silverman Gallery, Los Angeles, California. * 1980 Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York. * 1981 Baum-Silverman Gallery, Los Angeles, California and Monique Knowlton Gallery, New York, New York. * 1982 Quay Gallery, San Francisco, California. * 1983 Women's Art Movement, Adelaide, Australia and Canberra School of Art, Canberra Connecticut, Australia. * 1984 California, Los Angeles, California and Georgia State University Art Gallery, Atlanta, Georgia. * 1987 Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts. * 1988 Taichung Museum of Art, Taichung, Taiwan. * 1989 City Gallery Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand and Art space, Auckland, New Zealand * 1990 Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, California. * 1991 Objects Gallery, Chicago, Illinois. * 1992 The Ritual Journey.

They are predominantly fishers and cattle- herders. In the past, the Buduma carried out violent raids on the cattle herds of their neighbors. They were feared villains with aggressive reputations; thus, they were respected and left alone for many years, protected by their own habitat of water and reeds. Today, they are a peaceful and friendly people willing to adopt some modern changes. Although their neighbors call them Buduma, meaning \\"people of the grass (or reeds),\\" they prefer to be called Yedina. Their language is known as Yedina.  History  The Buduma traditionally claim to be descended from the peoples of the Sao civilization and Kanem-Bornu Empire. The Lake Chad region was integrated into the political realm of the Kanem-Bornu Empire. During this time (specifically around the 9th to 16th centuries), many ethnic groups in the area assimilated or merged in consequence of the new political power in the region. However, some communities stayed distinct and detached from the central government. This included the Buduma who established themselves in the remote islands and northern shores of Lake Chad.  Culture   Economy  The Buduma are largely fishermen and livestock herders. Some Buduma are engaged in commercial fishing but many fish for personal or familial subsistence. The cattle the Buduma raise are bred to have large and hollow horns. This allows the cattle to float easier when they're transported across the lake or other bodies of water. The Buduma extensively make use of papyrus reeds. The reeds are used for constructing fishing boats, lightweight huts (that can be moved to higher ground if the lake rises), and more. Staples foods of the Buduma include fish, cow milk, water lilly roots (that they grind to flour), and other foods native to the region. Even though they use or consume many products derived from their cattle, the Buduma don't commonly kill and eat them.  Clans  The Buduma are divided into two large groups which are the Kuri and Buduma. There are further divided into smaller groups though the Guria are the largest among them. Other subgroups include the Mehul, Maibuloa, Budjia, Madjigodjia, Ursawa, Media and Siginda. All these subgroups are also divided into specific lineages and clans.  Religion  The Buduma are Muslims. They were converted by Islamic missionaries during the era of French colonialism in Chad. The Buduma still incorporate many traditional beliefs and practices into their Islamic practices.

Science  The behavioral biometric of Keystroke Dynamics uses the manner and rhythm in which an individual types characters on a keyboard or keypad.Continuous authentication by analysis of keyboard typing characteristics The keystroke rhythms of a user are measured to develop a unique biometric template of the user's typing pattern for future authentication.A modified algorithm for user identification by his typing on the keyboard Vibration information may be used to create a pattern for future use in both identification and authentication tasks. Data needed to analyze keystroke dynamics is obtained by keystroke logging. Normally, all that is retained when logging a typing session is the sequence of characters corresponding to the order in which keys were pressed and timing information is discarded. When reading email, the receiver cannot tell from reading the phrase \\"I saw 3 zebras!\\" whether: *that was typed rapidly or slowly. *the sender used the left shift key, the right shift key, or the caps-lock key to make the \\"i\\" turn into a capitalized letter \\"I\\". *the letters were all typed at the same pace, or if there was a long pause before any characters while looking for that key. *the sender typed any letters wrong initially and then went back and corrected them, or if they got them right the first time.  Origin  On May 24, 1844, the message \\"What hath God wrought\\" was sent by telegraph from the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad \\"outer depot\\" in Baltimore, Maryland, a new era in long-distance communications had begun. By the 1860s the telegraph revolution was in full swing and telegraph operators were a valuable resource. With experience, each operator developed their unique \\"signature\\" and was able to be identified simply by their tapping rhythm. As late as World War II the military transmitted messages through Morse Code. Using a methodology called \\"The Fist of the Sender\\", Military Intelligence identified that an individual had a unique way of keying in a message's \\"dots\\" and \\"dashes\\", creating a rhythm that could help distinguish ally from enemy.  Use as biometric data  Researchers are interested in using this keystroke dynamic information, which is normally discarded, to verify or even try to determine the identity of the person who is producing those keystrokes. The techniques used to do this vary widely in power and sophistication, and range from statistical techniques to AI approaches like neural networks. The time to get to and depress a key (seek-time), and the time the key is held-down (hold-time) may be very characteristic for a person, regardless of how fast they are going overall. Most people have specific letters that take them longer to find or get to than their average seek-time over all letters, but which letters those are may vary dramatically but consistently for different people. Right-handed people may be statistically faster in getting to keys they hit with their right hand fingers than they are with their left hand fingers. Index fingers may be characteristically faster than other fingers to a degree that is consistent for a person day-to-day regardless of their overall speed that day. In addition, sequences of letters may have characteristic properties for a person. In English, the word \\"the\\" is very common, and those three letters may be known as a rapid-fire sequence and not as just three meaningless letters hit in that order. Common endings, such as \\"ing\\", may be entered far faster than, say, the same letters in reverse order (\\"gni\\") to a degree that varies consistently by person. This consistency may hold and may reveal the person's native language's common sequences even when they are writing entirely in a different language, just as revealing as an accent might in spoken English. Common \\"errors\\" may also be quite characteristic of a person, and there is an entire taxonomy of errors, such as this person's most common \\"substitutions\\", \\"reversals\\", \\"drop-outs\\", \\"double-strikes\\", \\"adjacent letter hits\\", \\"homonyms\\", hold-length-errors (for a shift key held down too short or too long a time). Even without knowing what language a person is working in, by looking at the rest of the text and what letters the person goes back and replaces, these errors might be detected. Again, the patterns of errors might be sufficiently different to distinguish two people.  Authentication versus identification  Keystroke dynamics is part of a larger class of biometrics known as behavioral biometrics; a field in which observed patterns are statistical in nature. Because of this inherent uncertainty, a commonly held belief is that behavioral biometrics are not as reliable as biometrics used for authentication based on physically observable characteristics such as fingerprints or retinal scans or DNA. The reality here is that behavioral biometrics use a confidence measurement instead of the traditional pass/fail measurements. As such, the traditional benchmarks of False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rates (FRR) no longer have linear relationships. The benefit to keystroke dynamics (as well as other behavioral biometrics) is that FRR/FAR can be adjusted by changing the acceptance threshold at the individual level. This allows for explicitly defined individual risk mitigation‚Äìsomething physical biometric technologies could never achieve. One of the major problems that keystroke dynamics runs into is that a person's typing varies substantially during a day and between different days, and may be affected by any number of external factors. Because of these variations, any system will make false-positive and false-negative errors. Some of the successful commercial products have strategies to handle these issues and have proven effective in large-scale use (thousands of users) in real-world settings and applications.  Legal and regulatory issues  Use of keylogging software may be in direct and explicit violation of local laws, such as the U.S. Patriot Act, under which such use may constitute wire-tapping. This could have severe penalties including jail time. See spyware for a better description of user- consent issues and various fraud statutes.  Patents   P. Nordstr√∂m, J. Johansson.

It is situated approximately 10 kilometres from Dublin city, just north of the hamlet of Balgriffin, within Fingal and in the traditional County Dublin, and is marked as \\"St Doulagh's Church, Balgriffin\\". Its complex also comprises an octagonal baptistry built over a holy well - Ireland's only surviving standalone baptistry - and a stone housing over a pool. St Doulagh's is one of the two churches in the Church of Ireland \\"United Parishes of Malahide, Portmarnock and St Doulagh's. St Doulagh's Church History and status The oldest part of the church as it stands is medieval dating from the 12th century, and believed to have been home to a small monastic settlement. However, according to studies on the site, Christian activity here dates back to the time of St. Patrick. Hudson (2005) states that King Sitric of Dublin gave land at St Doulough's, Portrane and Reachrain (probably Lambay Island) to Holy Trinity (Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin). In 1179, Pope Alexander III gave the \\"church lands at Clochar\\" to Laurence O'Toole, Archbishop of Dublin, so it was already church land - but there was no mention of a building. In regard to the other sites mentioned in the papal document, buildings are noted, suggesting that there may have been no useful building then at St Doulough's. The Canons Regular of St Augustine had by then been administering Christ Church. It seems possible that construction of the present building started about that time. However, there is no mention of a church at St Doulough's in the papal taxation lists of the early 14th century. It is not until 1406 that the first definite mention of a church at St Doulough's is made, when indulgences were granted by the Archbishop of Armagh to all who visited the church of St Doulough in the diocese of Dublin and confessed their sins to the resident chaplain Eustace Roche, and made a payment to the church. Rachel Moss believes that the church referred to is the eastern end of the medieval building and speculates that the funds generated may have then spurred building expansion. It seems likely from all this that construction of the present building started soon after the granting of the site to Holy Trinity by the Pope, and that additions and alterations were made in succeeding centuries, the dates of which are guesswork based on various narratives. Following the English Reformation, the church and its assets came into the control of the Established church. The majority Roman Catholic population was obliged to conduct its services elsewhere, often in private accommodations. There was a regular \\"pattern\\" held at the church until at least the 18th century. Since 1974, the church of the Holy Trinity in Donaghmede has served the Roman Catholic parishioners of that area, including later-built Clongriffin, and Balgriffin.Holy Trinity Parish (Roman Catholic). St Doulagh Hermit's window. Tradition has it that this low window in the church is where the hermit St. Doulough placed his plate in the hope of receiving food Very little is known of St Doulagh () who gave his name to the church. It is calculated that he lived in the early 7th century and was a hermit/anchorite. He is said to have lived isolated, in a cell attached to the church, and to have had only minimal contact with the outside world. Anchoritism was a feature of the Celtic church and one of many interesting points of similarity between Ireland's early Christianity and the Eastern churches. There is no extant history of St Doulough, and his dates are a matter for conjecture. Reeves (1859) stated that St Duilech is mentioned in Sacred Genealogies as the son of Malach, son of Sinell, and eighth in descent from Fergus Mac Rossa who is supposed to have lived in Christian Ireland. Reeves also mentions a St Mobhi (as told in the Leabhar Laighin, Book of Leinster) as an uncle of St Duilech. St Mobhi's death was mentioned by Tighernach as 630, and thus Reeves assigns the year 600 as approximately the time St Duilech lived. The Martyrology of Donegal says he was of the race of Conmac, son of Fergus, son of Ros, son of Rudhraidhe, and Clochar is given as the name of his church. The Gaelic for Grangegorman is Cill Duiligh, which suggests he had a connection with that place. There are other early documents that refer to St Duilech of Clochar (Rachel Moss, 2003) and the site is referred to as Clochar in many documents up to the late 1500s. The earliest historical reference to the church dates from the ninth century, in The Martyrology of Oengus; in that text the church is called Duilech Cain Clochair. The early documentation of St Doulough is sketchy, but legend has it that he was an anchorite. In the Calendar of Christ Church he is described as ‚ÄòEpiscopus and Confessor‚Äô, suggesting a ministry. A later anchorite, resident in St Douloughs, Eustace Roche, was also a confessor and the record of 1406 states that indulgences were granted to those who confessed to him and made a donation to the church. There was an alternative view of the origins of the name Doulough, but it was more tenuous. Dr Ledwich, in Antiquities of Ireland is quoted in an 1833 edition of the Dublin Penny Journal to the effect that the church was founded by St Olave, a Norseman, and that this name was corrupted to Doulough. Indeed, there are a number churches in Britain dedicated to the Norse saint. However the architecture of this building is agreed to be Irish. Dr Ledwich took the view that the western end of the church was much older than the eastern end or the tower. Dr Ledwich pointed out that the framing of some windows suggest that they were made by assorted carved stones gathered (possibly pillaged, which is what Norsemen were said to be prone to) from various sites. In any case, further re-arranging of these stones in times long after the Norsemen, is indicated by a sequence of alterations. However, Dr Ledwich's views of the founding saint and the dating of the church has been disproved by recent scholarship, especially by Reeves, Moss and Harbison. There is a curved ditch to the north of the site. This is thought to date from the 6th of 7th century (Rachel Moss, 2002) and indicate a Christian settlement and graveyard. St Doulough could have occupied the site at that time. Excavation work on the ditch by Grassroots Archaeology in 2015 at least does not disprove this theory, and suggests that a circular ditch once enclosed the entire site. The investigation by Grassroots Archaeology centred on a spot to the west of the church, by the road entrance where there was a ditch in medieval times. The fact that the road curves away from the church at this point suggests such a feature. The feast day of St Doulagh is November 17. The buildings The church The main historic building is 48 feet by 18 feet, with a double roof of rough stone set with cement. The space between the inner and outer, wedge-style, roof is usable. Partway along the roof is a small stone tower. There is a small door on the south face, with a rough arch, and traces of smoother arches on either side. Inside are a smaller room, with the reputed tomb of St Doulagh, and a larger room, the former main place of worship, with a stairway to the upper floor and tower. Along the stairway is the Prior's chamber, then an area where the clergy may have eaten and slept. A modern church structure was added in 1864, and consecrated in 1865. Holy well, baptistry and pool right The complex at St Doulagh's includes, in the field beyond the church and slightly nearer the road, a sunken stone enclosure. Within this is a low octagonal building, covering a spring, known as St Doulagh's Well. Outside the building is an open-air pool with stone seating, where pilgrims used to gather on November 17th. The octagonal building is believed to have been a baptistry, the only surviving detached baptistry in Ireland, and the pool alongside may have been used for adult immersion. The baptistry was repaired and supplied with fresco paintings of St Patrick, St Doulagh, St Bridget and St Columcille, and others, by a resident of the vanished village of Feltrim, in 1609. The frescos were damaged by soldiers of Sir Richard Bulkeley of Dunlavin after the Battle of the Boyne. Down a short path beyond the sunken enclosure is a stairway down to a small rectangular stone building which contains a pool of water, called St Catherine's Pond. This may also have been used for baptismal rites. It is connected to St Doulagh's well by a subterranean link, and a single spring supplies both. The cross There is also a cross, of non-local granite, at the entrance. Functions of the church building Detail of stone roof Moss (2003) took the view that south eastern part of this building, now known as ‚ÄòThe Oratory‚Äô, was erected first. At the very least this was to provide living accommodation, possibly functioning as a church . At ground floor level, to the west of The Oratory is a small room with its own entrance. This could have been accommodation for an additional resident clergyman or anchorite. It was common in medieval Ireland for such a room to be added to the west of a church for an anchorite who might be an un-ordained person following monastic rules. (O‚ÄôKeefe, 2015) It seems possible that the building of the tower house took place after the 1406 granting of an indulgence, centred on the church, generated the necessary funds. Certainly the battlements serve a purpose different from a simple cell. There is an arcade of two arches in the north western corner of the Oratory. This has led to speculation that an aisle was built in this position at the time the tower house was built, in order to accommodate a larger congregation. By 1406 the Normans were firmly established in their sphere of influence, The Pale. One of their colonising projects was Norman control of the Church. The Norman method of operating suggests that they established at some time, at their convenience, their own incumbent priest in St Doulough's. The tower house could well have been built for such a person, to provide better accommodation and to project a sense of power. The building of the tower house might suggest consolidation rather than significant expansion since a rural population, possibly poor, was unlikely to expand. Funds for the tower house might otherwise have come from tithes, were funds from tithes available. A decree of the Synod of Cashel in 1170 ordered that tithes be paid by every man to his parish. However Geraldus Cambrensis stated in 1185 that the Irish do not yet pay tithes. Norman efficiency may well have rectified that. There are records of tithes being granted to the Abbey of St Thomas in Dublin in the late 1100s. In 1506 a grant of lands was made by John Burnell of Ballygriffin (Balgriffin) to John Young, chaplin of St Douloughs for a chantry in the chapel of St Douloughs. (Moss, 2002) This would have provided funds for the saying of Masses for Burnell, patron of the church and would have enables him to be buried within the church. An investigation by Leo Swan in 1987 found evidence of a late medieval burial in the north wall. This may the grave of John Burnell. There is nothing to suggest that the chantry involved the building of a separate chapel. In medieval times tombs in such a position were used as ‚ÄòEaster Sepulchres‚Äô, the devotional practice of placing the consecrated host on such a tomb on Good Friday and Holy Saturday, symbolic of the entombment of Jesus. (O‚ÄôKeefe, 2015) That at least might be a possibility here. By 1630 St Douloughs had fallen on hard times. In visiting the building that year, Archbishop Burkeley found that the church was in a ruinous state with no ornaments and that the parishioners and indeed the owner of the lands were Catholic and worshipped elsewhere. (R Moss, 2002) The Civil Survey of Dublin, done between 1654 and 1656 found that ‚Äòthe church lands of St Dowlagh‚Äôs ‚Äô consisted of three small thatched houses and the wall of a decayed chapel. It would appear for that that St Douloughs was no longer a functioning church. It implies that the stone roofs were no longer intact. Rebuilding certainly took place in this era, post 1656, at the end of the Cromwellian war and it is to that time we may ascribe many of the features we see today : windows of varying shape and design, windows at low level believed to have been used as gun ports. Other changes may have been made at this time. (Moss, 2002) A stairway was inserted in the south west corner of the Oratory which blocked the lavatory which had earlier been installed in the tower house. We can still see the lavatory chute which ascends from near ground level to where the lavatory once stood. An earlier stair by the present south door was removed from the south east corner of the tower house and a hole made in the ceiling over the entrance, perhaps for defensive purposes. Ceremonies in the church The purpose of the church was for the assembly of the faithful for the celebration of Christian rites. In the medieval period, liturgical practices according to the Roman rite had become standardised in the Christian world, with some regional variations. (O‚ÄôKeefe, 2015) We can expect that there was Mass, weekly and perhaps daily, baptisms, marriages and funerals. We can expect that there was an altar, now gone. We have a small baptismal font on a pedestal inside, which would have been traditionally placed inside the church door, symbolising entrance to the church by baptism, and a more elaborate one to the north of the church, which clearly dates from a period much later than the church's foundation, having a design similar to the huge Renaissance baptistry in Florence. There are the remains of a piscina (Figure 21) for the washing of hands and vessels, possibly wall mounted, with a drain leading outside, or perhaps the waste water drained into a vessel. The church would have had wooden furnishings, now gone. Infant baptism had become standard by the eleventh century. Baptism was probably performed with much ceremony. The performance of baptism was evidence of a parochial church. A church decree from a synod in Dublin in 1186 ordered that an immovable baptismal font of stone be placed in the church in such a place as would allow a pascal procession to conveniently pass around. An immovable baptismal font in St Doulough's confined space may not have been practicable. There is indeed a movable baptism font. It is very likely that a pascal procession did take place. Within St Doulough's church there was limited space for a procession so it may have continued outside. A tradition in relation to baptisms may have been in place before any regulations were established that led eventually to the building of a baptistry outside, regarded as the only one of its kind in Ireland. The outside baptistry is centred on a well. Local tradition has it that baptisms took place at this well in the early Christian period in Ireland. Mass was obligatory for church members. A synod in Limerick in 1453 ordered that Mass was to be said in each church on each Sunday and holiday and all faithful, except the excommunicated, were to attend, on pain of excommunication. No work was allowed on Sundays and holidays. Possibly this formalised what was probably already common practice in many places. The same decree specified that the parishioners should provide the necessary church vessel, books, vestments. The bell was to be rung three times to announce the Mass. This provides a fairly clear picture of the rules under which St Douloughs operated. A small bell may have been used at some stage, but eventually St Douloughs got its own belltower. The consecrated host at that time in history was being treated with elaborate ceremonial. The Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 decreed the doctrine of Transubstantiation which reinforced the veneration and ceremonial centred on the consecrated host. Roman Catholic tradition reserves the consecrated host in a tabernacle near the altar, or in a panel attached to the wall behind the altar or hung from the ceiling. (O‚ÄôKeefe, 2015) No evidence has been found that establishes which method was used. The Oratory The eastern room on the ground floor of the medieval building is now called The Oratory. This is agreed to be the first element to be constructed and to have functioned as a church. It is aligned east‚Äìwest and the altar according to church practice would have been at the eastern end. There are no architectural features that would suggest any screen that might have existed between a nave and chancel. The principal window in the south wall of the Oratory has been dated by Harbison at 1230 AD. There is a taller window with a pointed arch behind the altar position in the east wall, possibly dating from the same time. There is a fragment of a piscina, for washing hands and vessels. A very narrow splayed window by the south east corner, beside the altar position is said to have been a viewing hole for lepers, who were not allowed in the church. In the west wall of the Oratory is a hole said to have been used as a cure for ailments. In the west wall are evidence of blocked up arches, said to have led at one stage to an aisle, now gone, which was built to accommodate congregation overflow. There is clear evidence of a blocked up door in the south wall of the Oratory. There is a recess near the altar, possibly for vessels and other ceremonial items. Restoration The complex was cleaned and the baptistry complex in particular restored in 1991, although the Victorian church element was not a main focus of the work, which was State-funded. Graveyard Granite cross at entrance to church There is a graveyard outside. There are no reported excavations to date the earliest graves. Burial within such a small church, indeed any parish church would have been extraordinary and a great privilege, reserved for founder and perhaps a very important benefactor. Tradition has it that St Doulough was buried just inside the church entrance. Excavations by Leo Swan uncovered evidence of a burial under the north wall, near the altar position. In fact burial of church founders in the north wall of churches became common in medieval Ireland, the celebrant taking his seat, as appropriate by the south wall of the chancel.

A majority of the five hundred politically motivated members, from the middle and upper class, settled in Missouri in 1834. The effort was considered a failure, but its leaders did much to contribute to the German influence of the state in the early 19th century. History Author Gottfried Duden, a German attorney, settled on the north side of the Missouri River along Lake Creek (now Dutzow, Missouri) in 1824. He was investigating the possibilities of settlement in the area by his countrymen. In 1827 he returned to Germany and in 1829 published Bericht √ºber eine Reise nach den westlichen Staaten Nordamerika's (\\"Report of a journey to the western states of North America\\") in 1829 which gave romantic and glowing descriptions of the Missouri River valley between St. Louis and Hermann, Missouri. The romantic description of the free life in the US motivated the Protestant minister Friedrich M√ºnch and the attorney Paul Follenius/Paul Follen in 1833 to found the Gie√üen emigration society. Muench and Follenius had participated in the outlawed student revolutions and political movements in Germany, prior to, and in the wake of the French July Revolution of 1832. As there was no immediate hope for success, they established the Giessen Emigration Society, with their publication \\"A Call for a Large Emigration\\" with the intentions to establish a \\"new and free Germany in the great North American Republic\\" to serve as model for a future German Republic. The small publication was circulated privately throughout Germany, secretly passed and discussed. Muench and Follenius's followers grew and became so large, they could not take all that responded on this first call, and closed at 500 members. The Statutes of the Society were lengthy, and the costs were high. Members were required to post dues in advance, have enough funds for all of their travel, their land purchased and the first few years of living. Character references were also required. Members were made up from all areas of Germany, several different religious groups, and many professions, farmers included. Membership dues would cover the costs of travel and settlement for the physicians and teachers, who were granted free membership. The group was to travel in two contingents from Bremen, in the spring of 1834. In May 1834, the Olbers, led by Paul Follenius, departed from Bremen, headed for New Orleans, where the group encountered Cholera. As they ascended the Mississippi River, now headed for St. Louis, many members grew ill, and some died. At the same time, unbeknown to the first group, the second contingent led by Friedrich Muench, was encountering their own difficulties in Bremen, and was delayed several weeks. They arrived in late July 1834 at Baltimore, and began to head quickly for St. Louis. At Cincinnati they met up with Baron von Bock of Dutzow who told them of the first groups arrival and misfortunes. Both leaders, Friedrich Muench and Paul Follenius, settled on farms next to that of Gottfried Duden near the German-populated Dutzow, Missouri. They soon realized that the plan for a separate German federal state would remain a Utopia. Other families settled nearby in southeastern Warren County, and in nearby Franklin and St. Charles Counties. Many of these early families would soon begin to write their own letters home, encouraging further emigration. As many were professionals and politically motivated, they were active in their communities efforts and politics. These families were actively involved in efforts regarding the abolition of slavery during the Civil War, and many created and joined companies of the Union Army that were made up completely of Germans. The influence of these first five hundred can still be found in the area today, that follows the Missouri River from St. Louis to Hermann - often called Little Germany, Missouri. This area, called the Missouri Weinstrasse, still retains much of the early German influence in its culture, and historic architecture.

Intended to parody MTV's Pimp My Ride, advertising agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky created a series of three television commercials directed by Jonas √Ökerlund, starring Swedish actor Peter Stormare as an effete German engineer named Wolfgang, and German model Sonja W√∂stendiek as his assistant Miss Helga. In each ad, Wolfgang introduces a \\"contestant\\" and Miss Helga showcases and insults their gaudy and distastefully modified compact car of a competitive make - specifically a Mitsubishi Eclipse, Ford Focus and a Honda Civic. Wolfgang then excitedly announces that they are going to \\"unpimp\\" the contestant's car, in which he presses a button on a handheld remote and the car is violently destroyed (such as being crushed by a shipping container or smashed by a wrecking ball) as the contestant watches. Each contestant is then given a brand new Volkswagen GTI, a car that has been \\"pre-tuned by German engineers\\". Wolfgang uses gestures and expressions reminiscent of hip-hop culture throughout the ads for humorous effect, such as when he proclaims \\"we just dropped it like it's hot!\\" after crushing a Ford Focus. Most notably, he opens every ad with \\"V Dub in the house!\\" and ends every ad by recreating the Volkswagen logo in a hand sign accompanied with, \\"V Dub! Representing Deutschland!\\" The commercials began airing in late February 2006. Prior to the full launch of the TV campaign, the three 30-second spots became an early example of a viral video when popular automotive news website Leftlane News uploaded the ads to video distribution service YouTube. The ads became an early example of an Internet meme, as other YouTube users created their own parodies of the ads. By early March 2006, the ads had received over two million views on YouTube. Three years later, that number was over 10 million. The ad campaign extended beyond the TV commercials. In one of the first examples of a company using social media to reach prospective customers, Volkswagen created a MySpace page for Miss Helga in which the character interacted with users. The advertised website, volkswagenfeatures.com, featured interactive videos of Miss Helga showcasing the car. The configurator on Volkswagen's website also allowed users to \\"test drive\\" their GTI around a test track while Miss Helga showcased the car's features from the passenger seat.

Overview  The national income of a country is an estimate of the yearly production of goods and services. The loss of possible uses of the non-human made physical surroundings, named environmental functions, on which humanity is dependent in all its doings remains outside the estimate. Also the present and future production is dependent on these environmental functions. The sustainable national income (SNI) in a given year is an estimate of the production level at which - with the technology in the year of calculation - environmental functions remain available ‚Äòfor ever‚Äô. The sustainable national income (SNI) in a certain year is defined as: :the maximum attainable production level whereby, with the available technology in the year of calculation, vital environmental functions remain available ‚Äòfor ever‚Äô.Meanwhile also the OECD uses this definition: http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6587 The production level in the same year that is registered in the standard national income (NI) does not meet this condition. Environmental functions and their preservation after all fall outside the NI. The NI is therefore always higher than the SNI. The difference gives information about the distance between the present production level and the production level in a sustainable situation. If the distance decreases then we are on the road to environmental sustainability, the part of the production that is based on unsustainable use of the environment decreases. If the distance increases then we are drifting further away from sustainability.  History  The original concept of ¬¥sustainability¬¥ refers to an equilibrium relation between human activities and their physical surroundings and has a long tradition going back to the nineteenth century. The sustainable national income is based on a definition of sustainability in conformity with this. The original concept of sustainability is introduced in the international discussion by 1980 publication of ‚ÄúThe World Conservation Strategy‚Äù of 1980IUCN, UNEP, WWF (1980), The World Conservation Strategy, WWF, Gland, Switzerland Since the publication of ‚ÄúOur Common Future‚Äù in 1987World Commission on Environment and development (1987), Our Common Future. Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford one has started to include in sustainability besides a sustainable use of the physical surroundings also elements that conflict with this, such as the growth of production as measured in the national income and some social measures.R. Hueting (1990), The Brundtland report: A matter of conflicting goals, Ecological Economics, 2 (2) p 109-117 By taking together environmental conservation and herewith conflicting goals in one and the same sustainability indicator the development of the state of the environment is being obscured. Moreover, there are examples of measures that worked socially advantageous in the short term but disastrous in the long term because of impairment of vital environmental functions. Arguments in support of this and some historical examples are given in the publications of Hueting and Reijnders (2004) and De Boer and Hueting for the OECD (2004) mentioned below. The theoretical and practical framework of the Sustainable national income is developed by the economist Roefie Hueting. Already in 1970 he published a collection of articles over the years 1967-1970 titled: ‚ÄúWhat is nature worth to us?‚Äù . His 1974 Ph.D. thesis was entitled ‚ÄúNew scarcity and economic growth: More welfare through less production?‚Äù In 1969 Hueting founded the Department of Environmental Statistics at Statistics Netherlands. A multidisciplinary team of biologists, chemists, physicists, electrical engineers and economists worked for nearly forty years on the SNI and the environmental statistics on what it is based.  Sustainable national income topics   Environmental functions  Central to the sustainable national income (SNI) is the concept of environmental function. Environmental functions are defined as the possible uses of our non-human made physical surroundings, on which humanity is entirely dependent in all its doings, whether they be producing, consuming, breathing or recreating. When use of one function is at the expense of another or the same function or threatens to be so in the future, there is competition of functions. As an illustration, once water pollutant thresholds have been exceeded, use of the function ‚Äòdumping ground for waste‚Äô may come to compete with the function ‚Äòdrinking water‚Äô. Competing functions are by definition scarce and consequently economic goods. Today most of the functions of our physical surroundings, which once were free goods, have become scarce goods.  Transition to environmental sustainability  With the present technology, population size as well as production and consumption patterns, the sustainable situation governments say they strive for cannot be reached. Given the distance to be bridged, achieving environmental sustainability will require a fairly long period. Besides many environmental measures have a time lag, sometimes of a few decades. The length of the period of the transition path to a sustainable situation is only limited by the condition that vital environmental functions must not be irreparably damaged. In view of the threat that this may happen it seems urgent to wait no longer with a change of course in the direction of sustainability. On account of the precautionary principle no technological progress during the transition period is anticipated. This is measured afterwards on the basis of the development of the distance (√©cart) between the SNI and the NI in the course of time.  Estimates  The work on the estimate of an SNI started in the mid-1960s. The first rough estimate of an ‚ÄòSNI‚Äô for the world by Jan Tinbergen and Roefie Hueting in 1991 arrived at 50 percent of the world production level: the sustainable world income.J.Tinbergen, R. Hueting, GNP and market prices: wrong signals for sustainable economic success that mask environmental destruction. In: R. Goodland et al. (editors), Environmentally Sustainable Economic Development: Building on Brundtland, Ch 4: 51-57, UNESCO, Paris, 1991. Also published in: R. Goodland et al. (eds.), Population, Technology and Lifestyle: The Transition to Sustainability, Ch. 4: 52-62, Island Press, Washington, D.C., 1992. Also published in: Environmentally Sustainable Economic Development: Building on Brundtland. R. Goodland et al. (eds.) Environment Working Paper 46, The World Bank, Washington, D.C., 1991. A much more advanced estimate for The Netherlands was made in 2001 by a collaboration of the National Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM), Statistics Netherlands (CBS) and the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM). The estimate arrived at around 50 percent of the production level, c.q. the national income of The Netherlands.H.Verbruggen, R.Dellink, R.Gerlagh, M.Hofkes, H.M.A. Jansen, 2001. Alternative calculations of a sustainable national income for the Netherlands according to Hueting. In: E.C. van Ierland, J. van der Straaten, H.R.J. Vollebergh, editors, Economic Growth and Valuation of the Environment, A Debate, Edward Elgar, Cheltenham UK p 275-312. This corresponds with the production level of the beginning of the 1970s. As the population was smaller at that time, the consumption per person was substantially higher than 50 percent of the present level. In accordance with the principles of the SNI it is assumed that all countries in the world simultaneously switch over to environmental sustainability and that the costs thereof are comparable with those of The Netherlands. In the period 1990-2000 the distance between de NI and SNI increased with approximately 10 billion euros.Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, Environmental Balance 2006, p 21  Reviews  Neoclassical economics finds opposition from ecological economics, while that opposition would be less needed due to Hueting's more neoclassical analysis of the environment. The neoclassical SNI has different results than e.g. Robert Costanza et al. (1997).Robert Costanza et al.

Rolovich majored in economics at the University of Hawaii, and received a master's degree at New Mexico Highlands University. He was a quarterback with the Las Vegas Gladiators in the Arena Football League. High school years Rolovich grew up in Novato. He attended Marin Catholic High School in Kentfield, California, and won varsity letters in football and baseball. In football, he led his teams to two league championships. College career City College of San Francisco Rolovich was a two-time junior college All-American (1998‚Äì99) at City College of San Francisco, where he led the Rams to a national championship in 1999. University of Hawaii Rolovich was a two-year letterman at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where he replaced starter and eventual all-time NCAA career passing leader Timmy Chang early in the 2001 season, leading the team to an 8‚Äì1 record. During those nine games, Rolovich threw for 3,361 yards and 34 touchdowns on 233-of-405 passing. He ended his college career with three straight 500-yard passing games. He also tossed school single-game records of 8 touchdowns and 543 yards in a 72‚Äì45 win over BYU on December 8, 2001. Those numbers helped him place tenth in the nation in pass efficiency (105.5) while breaking 19 school passing records and eight total offense records. Rolovich participated in and was named one of the two MVPs from the 2002 Hula Bowl college all-star game. Professional football career Rolovich signed with the Denver Broncos on May 18, 2002 after an impressive mini-camp. He rejoined the team in the following season before being allocated to the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe. In 2003, Rolovich completed 87-of-149 passes while leading the Fire to World Bowl XI. He connected on 14-of-19 passes for 164 yards and a touchdown in their 35‚Äì16 loss to the Frankfurt Galaxy in the championship game. In 2004 and 2005, Rolovich signed with the San Jose SaberCats of the Arena Football League where he served as Mark Grieb‚Äôs backup. He became the first San Jose QB other than Grieb to throw a pass in a game since the 2002 season. Rolovich signed with the Arizona Rattlers on October 31, 2006. Rolovich was released by both the Chicago Rush and Arizona Rattlers (after injuring his shoulder on January 16, 2006 in a non-contact scrimmage against Las Vegas, within a week he was waived) in 2006. On April 10, 2007, Rolovich was signed by the Las Vegas Gladiators. Coaching career While still playing in the AFL, Rolovich served as quarterback coach for his JC alma mater, the City College of San Francisco Rams for two years. Rolovich coached future quarterbacks Zac Lee and Jeremiah Masoli, who later went on to careers at Nebraska and Oregon, respectively. In 2008, he retired from pro-football and joined the coaching staff of his other alma mater, the Hawaii Warriors, as a full-time quarterback coach. In 2010, he was promoted to become Hawaii's offensive coordinator. In 2012, he was hired by Nevada to be their offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach after not being retained by new Warriors head coach Norm Chow. In 2013, Rolovich was set to be the offensive coordinator at Temple on Matt Rhule's inaugural staff before backing out on January 9th, 2013 after Nevada doubled his salary to $240,000.  Hawaii (2016‚Äì19)  On November 27, 2015, Rolovich was hired as the new head football coach at the University of Hawaii replacing Chow and interim head coach Chris Naeole. In Rolovich's first season, Hawaii finished the regular season 6‚Äì7, but had their first bowl invitation since 2010 to the Hawaii Bowl, where they beat Middle Tennessee 52‚Äì35. In 2017, Hawaii suffered a setback with injuries to John Ursua among other players, finishing the season 3‚Äì9 while losing their last 5 games. In 2018, Rolovich opted to change from a balanced spread offense to the pass- oriented run and shoot offense that June Jones successfully ran while Rolovich was a player at Hawaii. In their first year under the run and shoot, Rolovich and Hawaii finished 8‚Äì6 while losing to Louisiana Tech in the Hawaii Bowl 31‚Äì14. In 2019, Hawaii opened the season with wins against Pac-12 opponents Arizona and Oregon State before losing to No. 23 Washington. They clinched a berth in the Mountain West Championship Game with a 14‚Äì11 over San Diego State on November 23, 2019. He was named Mountain West Coach of Year in 2019 after leading Hawaii to a 10 win season and a division title.  Washington State (2020‚Äìpresent)  On January 13, 2020, Rolovich was announced as the new head coach for Washington State University, replacing Mike Leach who had departed to take the head coaching job at Mississippi State.

Drafted 224th overall in the 2020 NFL Draft by the Tennessee Titans.  Coaching style  Offensive philosophy During his stint as offensive coordinator at Hawaii, Rolovich used the run and shoot offense that June Jones had run when Rolovich was the team's starting quarterback. As the offensive coordinator, he made adjustments to the offense so that it could be run out of the pistol formation, creating opportunities for the quarterback to be a second runner. This led to an increase in success in the running game. When he became the offensive coordinator at Nevada, he ran the pistol offense that longtime Nevada head coach Chris Ault had popularized. When he was named head coach at Hawaii, he was the de facto offensive coordinator with Brian Smith and Craig Stutzmann named running game coordinator and passing game coordinator for one season before naming Smith the offensive coordinator for the 2017 season. After running a balanced spread offense for the first two years, he switched back to the run and shoot. With the rise in popularity of the run-pass option (RPO), Rolovich once again made adjustments to the run and shoot offense so that the quarterback of the offense could run RPO plays. Personality Rolovich is known for his zany personality, where he brought a tarot card reader, a Britney Spears impersonator, and an Elvis Presley impersonator to Mountain West Conference Media Days during his head coaching days at Hawaii. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Rolovich went around Washington State's Pullman campus on a bicycle FaceTimeing a recruit with a phone taped to his bike helmet to show the recruit what Pullman and the campus looked like. Personal Rolovich is married to Analea Donovan, his college sweetheart from Maui. They have four children, born in August 2007, May 2009, and twins born in 2013.

The rule was first established in the late 1940s. There have been more than ten amendments, most recently the refining of the draft bidding process in 2015. History The father‚Äìson rule was established during the 1949 season. The first player officially cleared under the father‚Äìson rule was Harvey Dunn Jr, who was recruited to his father's old club, Carlton, in 1951, instead of being recruited to North Melbourne under zoning rules. The original rule is thought to have originally come into place as a result of successful lobbying by the Melbourne Football Club, which had wanted the young Ron Barassi to follow in the footsteps of his father, Ron Barassi Sr., who had been killed during World War II. Barassi was officially cleared to Melbourne under the rule in 1953. Incorporation into the National Draft Prior to 1997, the rule allowed the son to be recruited by his father's club, bypassing the draft entirely. West Coast's Ben Cousins, for example, was recruited in this manner, without the Eagles parting with any draft picks. In 1997, the father‚Äìson rule was altered to force clubs to use a second-round draft selection for their first father‚Äìson selection. If two players were to be drafted by the same club in the same year, then a third round selection was used for the second player. Geelong used this rule in 1997 to draft Marc Woolnough with their second selection and Matthew Scarlett with their third-round pick, whilst Collingwood chose to not select Marcus Picken. In 2001, the rule was changed to only allow a single selection per year, costing the club a third-round selection. Notably, this rule allowed Geelong to draft Gary Ablett Jr. (who, while only rated a mid-range draft possibility at the time, went on to win two Brownlow Medals) to the club in 2001 using only their third-round (40th overall) draft pick. In 2003, the rules were changed again to allow multiple players to be drafted in a single year, with a third-round selection used for the first player and a second-round selection being used for the second player. Collingwood drafted cousins Brayden and Heath Shaw using their second- and third-round selection, respectively, in 2003.  Bidding system  In 2007, following concerns that potential first-round draftees were being selected for an unfairly low draft pick under the father‚Äìson rule, a bidding system was established to ensure father‚Äìson recruits could still be preferentially drafted by the father's club, albeit at a fair market value. Under the 2007 amendment, any club could bid on another club's son with one of its draft picks, and the father's club then had the right to recruit the son by giving up its next pick. The bidding process occurred prior to the draft, but the decisions made while bidding were binding during the draft.AFL amends Father/son rule ABC Sport, 25 April 2007Sportal.com.au Oct 2007: Three father‚Äìson nominations For example, in 2008 the Western Bulldogs used their first-round selection to secure Ayce Cordy after St Kilda bid its higher first-round selection for him. The bidding system was further refined in 2015. Under the current system: *Each draft pick is assigned a value (with No. 1 starting at 3000 points, declining exponentially until No. 74 which has no value), which is regressed from historical player salary data. *During the draft, any club may bid for a father‚Äìson eligible player with any draft pick. *The father's club, if it wishes to select the son, must then use its next one or more draft picks until the total points value of the surrendered picks adds up to the value of the draft pick used by the bidding, less a discount ‚Äì which is either 20% of the bid value or 197 points (equivalent to pick No. 56), whichever is greater. Any points left over after reaching the bid value result in the draft pick being shuffled down the order. *The club which originally made the bid then has the next selection in the draft. The same bidding process has also been used since 2015 by the New South Wales and Queensland clubs to gain access to their states' academy players. Player eligibility As of March 2011, eligibility of players differs depending upon the home-state of the team making the selection. All clubs A player is eligible if his father played 100 or more senior games for the clubs. In the cases of the two interstate clubs with historic links to Victorian Football League teams, namely the Brisbane Lions and the Sydney Swans, the sons of players who appeared 100 times for their Victorian predecessors: the Fitzroy Lions in the case of the Brisbane Lions; and the South Melbourne Football Club in the case of the Sydney Swans. West Australian and South Australian teams In addition to the standard eligibility rules, the South Australian and Western Australian clubs have a modified rule in place with eligibility to be determined by a certain number of games played for specific sides in SANFL or WAFL, if those games were played prior to the club entering the AFL. Specifically: *The West Coast Eagles could select any player whose father had made 150 WAFL appearances prior to 1987 for Claremont, East Perth, West Perth or Subiaco. *Adelaide could select any player whose father made 200 SANFL appearances prior to 1990 for South Adelaide, Norwood, Glenelg or Sturt. *Fremantle could select any player whose father has made 150 WAFL appearances prior to 1995 for East Fremantle, South Fremantle, Perth or Swan Districts. *Port Adelaide can select any player whose father has made 200 SANFL appearances prior to 1997 for the Port Adelaide Magpies, North Adelaide, West Adelaide, Central District, Woodville or West Torrens. Until 2006 these rules would only apply during the first 20 years of the club's existence in the AFL. This 20-year provision was removed because it was felt to be unfair if a player had a son later in life. These rules have been frequently criticised by non-Victorian AFL club officials as a \\"grandfather‚Äìson\\" ruleHeavy Hitters: Steven Trigg, Adelaide Crows Official website that is biased against them. For example, the Adelaide Crows have not had a single father‚Äìson selection in 21 years, and missed out on Bryce Gibbs despite his father's 253-game career with SANFL club Glenelg from 1984 to 1994. Gibbs was subsequently selected by Carlton with the first overall pick in the 2006 AFL Draft. Former eligibility rules Under previous rules, the sons of a senior administrator, such as a president, vice-president, general manager or senior coach, with a tenure of at least five years at a club, would be eligible to be drafted under the father‚Äìson rule by that club; and and were previously able to recruit players whose fathers had met eligibility criteria in the Queensland Australian Football League and the Sydney Football League respectively. Neither of these rules is in place as of 2012. More than one eligible team and player choice If a player is eligible to be selected by more than one team the individual player may choose which one of these teams is able to pick him under this rule. For example, Joe Daniher's father Anthony Daniher played 118 games with Essendon and 115 with Sydney. Joe selected Essendon.Darcy Daniher worth early pick Herald Sun Alternatively, a player has the right to decline to be selected under the father‚Äìson rule and instead be eligible to be drafted by any other club. An example of this was Marc Murphy who declined to sign with the Brisbane Lions despite his father, John Murphy, playing 214 games for the Fitzroy Football Club. Murphy was instead selected as the first pick in the 2005 National Draft by Carlton. AFL Women's With the establishment of AFL Women's from the 2017 season, the AFL will introduce an equivalent father‚Äìdaughter recruitment rule, enabling clubs priority recruitment access to daughters of former senior players. Unlike the father‚Äìson rule, the father needs to only have played one senior match for his club for his daughter to be eligible. Plans are in place in future years for a similar mother‚Äìson or mother‚Äìdaughter rule.

He played 15 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, the New York Yankees, and the Houston Astros. A seven-time All-Star and a six-time Silver Slugger Award winner, he won the 2017 World Series with the Astros. Early life McCann was born to Howard and Sherry McCann in Atlanta, Georgia. At the time, his father worked as an assistant baseball coach for the Georgia Bulldogs Baseball under Steve Webber and his mother worked at Athens Regional Hospital. Both of his parents attended Oswego High School in Oswego, New York, where they would later be inducted into the school's athletics hall of fame. McCann's father played college baseball at Mississippi State. Howard McCann would eventually become the head coach at Marshall. McCann's older brother, Brad, played at Clemson and was selected in the sixth round of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft by the Florida Marlins but was out of professional baseball by 2007. McCann attended Duluth High School in Duluth, Georgia. He was ranked the 26th best high school prospect by Baseball America and initially committed to play college baseball for Alabama. The Atlanta Braves selected him in the second round of the 2002 MLB draft. Career Atlanta Braves (2005-13) McCann made his MLB debut with the Braves on June 10, 2005 after playing in the minor leagues for the Rome Braves. A personal catcher for John Smoltz for most of the 2005 season, McCann hit his first home run in just his second regular- season game and became the first Braves player in franchise history to hit a home run in his first playoff at-bat on October 6, 2005. He accomplished the feat in the second inning of a 7‚Äì1 victory over Roger Clemens and the Houston Astros in Game 2 of the 2005 National League Division Series. McCann was named the everyday starter when the Braves traded Johnny Estrada to the Diamondbacks. During the 2006 season, McCann hit .333 with 24 homers and 94 RBI. He led all Major League catchers in homers, and his RBI total was matched only by Jorge Posada and Victor Martinez. The Braves rewarded McCann by buying out his arbitration years with a 6-year, $27.8 million contract during spring training in 2007. McCann was selected to play in the 2006 MLB All-Star Game, in his first full major league season, and then again in both 2007 and 2008, making him the first Braves player ever to be selected to the National League All-Star team in each of his first three seasons. In 2008, he allowed more stolen bases than any other NL catcher, with 93. Beginning in April 2009, McCann was bothered by blurry vision in his left eye, due to a slight vision change following 2007 LASIK surgery. He decided to opt for glasses when contact lenses proved uncomfortable. In May 2009, Oakley, Inc. made special glasses for McCann to correct the vision problem and allow for comfort under the catcher's mask. McCann remarked, \\"I need my Oakleys. I have to have the wraparounds for my peripheral vision.\\" In 2009, he had more errors at catcher than any other major leaguer, with 12, and had the lowest fielding percentage among them (.988). McCann was again selected for the All-Star Game in 2009 and 2010. In the latter, he was named the MVP after driving in all three of the National League's runs with a bases-clearing double in the seventh inning (driving in Scott Rolen, Matt Holliday, and Marlon Byrd), off of Chicago White Sox reliever Matt Thornton, giving the NL a 3‚Äì1 victory, its first in the midsummer classic since 1996. On August 23, McCann hit the first walk-off home run reviewed by instant replay. McCann hit a line drive to right field. The ball struck the top of the right field wall. The umpires called it a double, but McCann and Braves bench coach Chino Cadahia argued the call. The umpires went to go review instant replay. Replays showed that the ball struck the top of the right field wall, bounced into the stands, and then got onto the field. Thus, the umpires overturned the call and called it a walk-off home run. In 2010, he allowed more stolen bases than any other NL catcher, with 84. During spring training, on March 9, 2011, McCann hit a line drive foul ball which struck minor league manager Luis Salazar, blinding him in the left eye. On May 17, 2011, McCann hit a ninth-inning, game-tying, pinch-hit home run and an 11th-inning game-winning two-run home run to defeat the Houston Astros 3‚Äì1. Also in 2011, he allowed 104 stolen bases, more than any other major league catcher. On July 27, 2012, he became the first player since Jim Thome in 2007 to homer in six straight games versus an opponent. He did this on the same day Chipper Jones tied Pete Rose's major league record for extra base hits by a switch hitter. On July 14, 2013, McCann was chosen by National League manager Bruce Bochy to replace injured Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman in the 2013 All-Star Game. New York Yankees (2014-16) New York Yankees in 2015 On November 23, 2013, McCann agreed to a five-year, $85 million contract with the New York Yankees, with a vesting option for a sixth year. The Yankees officially announced the deal on December 3. McCann wore the number 34 as number 16 is retired in honor of Whitey Ford. On May 28, 2014, with limited options at first base, manager Joe Girardi slotted McCann into his first career start at first against the St. Louis Cardinals, going 2-for-4 with an RBI, a run scored, and a walk in a 7‚Äì4 Yankee win. On September 28, 2014, McCann entered the game against the Boston Red Sox as a pinch runner for Derek Jeter, after Jeter's final career hit. McCann led the Yankees in home runs (23) and RBI (75). On September 6, 2015, McCann hit his career-high 25th home run of the season, a game-tying three-run shot off of Chris Archer of the Tampa Bay Rays. McCann ended the season with 26 home runs and a career-high 96 RBI. On November 12, 2015, he earned his sixth Silver Slugger Award at catcher (his first in the American League). McCann struggled early on during the 2016 season. After the Yankees released Alex Rodriguez, rookie catcher Gary S√°nchez was brought up to share in catching duties. After S√°nchez had a big impact both on offense and defense, McCann became the primary designated hitter for the team. In 130 games, McCann batted .242 with 20 home runs and 58 RBI, the ninth season in a row in which McCann hit at least 20 home runs. Houston Astros (2017-18) Houston Astros in 2017 On November 17, 2016, the Yankees traded McCann to the Houston Astros for Albert Abreu and Jorge Guzm√°n. On April 14, 2017, McCann became the 14th catcher to record over 10,000 putouts at the position. On May 21, Houston put McCann on the 7-day disabled list for players who have sustained a concussion. Playing in only 97 games, McCann hit 18 home runs. He failed to reach 20 home runs for the first time since 2007, ending his streak at nine consecutive 20-home run seasons. In the 2017 American League Championship Series, McCann hit RBI doubles in Games 6 and 7 against his former team, the Yankees, to help the Astros reach the 2017 World Series. McCann caught every inning of the World Series, and hit 5-for-25 with a pivotal home run in Game 5 as the Astros defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in 7 games. On April 23, 2018, McCann became the 10th catcher all-time to record 11,000 career putouts at the position. For the season, he batted .212/.301/.339.Brian McCann Stats  Baseball-Reference.com He had the slowest baserunning sprint speed of all major league catchers, and the second-slowest speed of all major league players, at 22.7 feet/second.Statcast Sprint Speed Leaderboard  baseballsavant.comStatcast Sprint Speed Leaderboard  baseballsavant.com On October 31, 2018, the Astros declined the 2019 option on his contract, making him a free agent. Atlanta Braves (second stint, 2019) On November 26, 2018, McCann signed a one-year, $2 million contract with the Atlanta Braves, marking his return to the club. He was assigned uniform number 16, the number he wore during his first stint with the Braves; Charlie Culberson, who had worn the number during the 2018 season, switched his number to 8. On June 14, 2019, McCann recorded his 1,000th career RBI, a walk-off single against the Philadelphia Phillies. For the season, he batted .249/.323/.412. In 2019, he had the slowest sprint speed of all major league players, at 22.2 feet/second. On October 9, 2019, shortly after the Braves' Game 5 loss in the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, McCann announced his retirement from baseball. 2009 World Baseball Classic McCann played for the United States national baseball team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. Personal life McCann married Ashley Jarusinski in December 2007. Their first child, Colt Michael, was born in July 2012. Their second child, a daughter named Colbie, was born in September 2013. He resided in Rye, New York before being traded to Houston. Brian McCann's mother is now married to the father of former Yankee first baseman Mark Teixeira, who was McCann's teammate during his three seasons with the Yankees and approximately one season with the Braves. Philanthropy In 2008, McCann released a charity wine (The McCann Merlot) with 100% of his proceeds supporting the Rally Foundation for Childhood Cancer Research, an organization dedicated to raising funds to support pediatric cancer research and treatments. McCann also has baseball clinics for kids aged 5‚Äì18.

It is located on the border of the municipalities of Fauske and S√∏rfold in Nordland county, Norway--just west of the border with Sweden. Its highest point is above sea level and its lowest point is at an elevation of . Three outlet glaciers extend from the icecap. A small outlet spills over a subglacial ridge to the north damming an unnamed lake resulting in occasion outburst floods. To the east a large outlet extends towards the lake, Leirvatnet. A further outlet descends steeply to the west. The western and northern outlets are heavily crevassed, as is the snout of the eastern glacier calving into Leirvatnet. The glacier also calves into lake Bl√•mannsisvatnet, resulting in extensive crevasses in the glacier above that lake. Given the degree of crevassing at the margins, traversing the glacier can be dangerous, particularly in late spring or early summer when snow bridges may be weak. Bl√•mannsisen drains into the local Norwegian hydropower networks operated by Elkem and Saltens Kraftsamband and into the one in Lule√§lv, Sweden.

The term applies both to mental processes used by humans when reading text, and to artificial processes implemented in computers, which are the subject of natural language processing. The problem is non-trivial, because while some written languages have explicit word boundary markers, such as the word spaces of written English and the distinctive initial, medial and final letter shapes of Arabic, such signals are sometimes ambiguous and not present in all written languages. Compare speech segmentation, the process of dividing speech into linguistically meaningful portions.  Segmentation problems   Word segmentation  Word segmentation is the problem of dividing a string of written language into its component words. In English and many other languages using some form of the Latin alphabet, the space is a good approximation of a word divider (word delimiter), although this concept has limits because of the variability with which languages emically regard collocations and compounds. Many English compound nouns are variably written (for example, ice box = ice- box = icebox; pig sty = pig-sty = pigsty) with a corresponding variation in whether speakers think of them as noun phrases or single nouns; there are trends in how norms are set, such as that open compounds often tend eventually to solidify by widespread convention, but variation remains systemic. In contrast, German compound nouns show less orthographic variation, with solidification being a stronger norm. However, the equivalent to the word space character is not found in all written scripts, and without it word segmentation is a difficult problem. Languages which do not have a trivial word segmentation process include Chinese, Japanese, where sentences but not words are delimited, Thai and Lao, where phrases and sentences but not words are delimited, and Vietnamese, where syllables but not words are delimited. In some writing systems however, such as the Ge'ez script used for Amharic and Tigrinya among other languages, words are explicitly delimited (at least historically) with a non-whitespace character. The Unicode Consortium has published a Standard Annex on Text Segmentation,UAX #29 exploring the issues of segmentation in multiscript texts. Word splitting is the process of parsing concatenated text (i.e. text that contains no spaces or other word separators) to infer where word breaks exist. Word splitting may also refer to the process of hyphenation.  Intent segmentation  Intent segmentation is the problem of dividing written words into keyphrases (2 or more group of words). In English and all other languages the core intent or desire is identified and become the corner-stone of the keyphrase Intent segmentation. Core product/service, idea, action & or thought anchor the keyphrase. \\"[All things are made of atoms]. [Little particles that move] [around in perpetual motion], [attracting each other] [when they are a little distance apart], [but repelling] [upon being squeezed] [into one another].\\"  Sentence segmentation  Sentence segmentation is the problem of dividing a string of written language into its component sentences. In English and some other languages, using punctuation, particularly the full stop/period character is a reasonable approximation. However even in English this problem is not trivial due to the use of the full stop character for abbreviations, which may or may not also terminate a sentence. For example, Mr. is not its own sentence in \\"Mr. Smith went to the shops in Jones Street.\\" When processing plain text, tables of abbreviations that contain periods can help prevent incorrect assignment of sentence boundaries. As with word segmentation, not all written languages contain punctuation characters that are useful for approximating sentence boundaries.  Topic segmentation  Topic analysis consists of two main tasks: topic identification and text segmentation. While the first is a simple classification of a specific text, the latter case implies that a document may contain multiple topics, and the task of computerized text segmentation may be to discover these topics automatically and segment the text accordingly. The topic boundaries may be apparent from section titles and paragraphs. In other cases, one needs to use techniques similar to those used in document classification. Segmenting the text into topics or discourse turns might be useful in some natural processing tasks: it can improve information retrieval or speech recognition significantly (by indexing/recognizing documents more precisely or by giving the specific part of a document corresponding to the query as a result). It is also needed in topic detection and tracking systems and text summarizing problems. Many different approaches have been tried: e.g. HMM, lexical chains, passage similarity using word co- occurrence, clustering, topic modeling, etc. It is quite an ambiguous task ‚Äì people evaluating the text segmentation systems often differ in topic boundaries. Hence, text segment evaluation is also a challenging problem.  Other segmentation problems  Processes may be required to segment text into segments besides mentioned, including morphemes (a task usually called morphological analysis) or paragraphs.  Automatic segmentation approaches  Automatic segmentation is the problem in natural language processing of implementing a computer process to segment text. When punctuation and similar clues are not consistently available, the segmentation task often requires fairly non-trivial techniques, such as statistical decision-making, large dictionaries, as well as consideration of syntactic and semantic constraints. Effective natural language processing systems and text segmentation tools usually operate on text in specific domains and sources. As an example, processing text used in medical records is a very different problem than processing news articles or real estate advertisements. The process of developing text segmentation tools starts with collecting a large corpus of text in an application domain. There are two general approaches: * Manual analysis of text and writing custom software * Annotate the sample corpus with boundary information and use machine learning Some text segmentation systems take advantage of any markup like HTML and know document formats like PDF to provide additional evidence for sentence and paragraph boundaries.

The station is managed by Abellio ScotRail and is on the Aberdeen to Inverness Line. It is a category B listed building. The station appeared as 'Inverness' in the 1970 film The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes. History The station was first opened in 1855 by the Inverness and Nairn Railway. In 1857, the line was extended eastwards to Dalvey. The route from Aberdeen to Inverness was merged into one company, the Inverness and Aberdeen Junction Railway, in 1861. Many of the local stations either side of here succumbed to the Beeching Axe between 1965 & 1968, though Nairn was one of those that survived the cutbacks. The station is from (measured via ), and has a passing loop long, flanked by two platforms which can each accommodate an eight-coach train. The station was notable for being the last working example of Highland Railway signalling principles, where a signal box was provided at each end to work the signals & points whilst the key token instruments for working the single line were located in the main building. The distance between the boxes was such that a bicycle was officially provided by BR (and later Railtrack) for the signaller to use.Section C - 2000The Signal Box; Retrieved 2013-10-09 The practice came to an end in April 2000, when the station was resignalled with colour lights and control shifted to a panel in the station building - as a result, most passenger services use the northern (former eastbound) platform in both directions (the southern one is now only used by Aberdeen-bound services if two trains are scheduled to pass here).

The station is managed by Abellio ScotRail and is on the Aberdeen‚ÄìInverness line. Although Forres is still serving passenger trains to the east and west, it was once possible to travel south on the railway to Perth via on the Inverness and Perth Junction Railway, meeting with the GNSR (via Craigellachie) at Boat of Garten station. As of 2017, direct services to Perth and Dundee operate via Inverness and Aberdeen. History Prior to the Dava route opening, all services to the south began at Aberdeen (on the north- east coast). Problems occurred when connecting at Aberdeen from Inverness trains - Aberdeen was the terminus for two railway companies, and therefore had two separate stations: One served the east and the other was the starting point for services to the south (via the coast). Although they were connected by a bus, connections were often missed and passengers remained stranded after missing the daily connection south. Plans for a more direct route via Carrbridge had been rejected by parliament as too ambitious. Engineer Joseph Mitchell planned an alternative route via Dava and work was completed on the line by August 1863. Forres was chosen as the junction for the new mainline south, since it was the half-way point on the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway between Inverness and Keith. Keith was also an important railway junction and the point where the line joined the GNSR and branches to the coast and Strathspey. Station development 1858 The first railway station in Forres which was located at the end of Invererne Road. On the OS map for 1863, this road is named appropriately 'Old Station Road'. The station building was located between the current track and signal box, and the former goods loop (which was the original main line, before the junction was constructed). This served trains from Inverness to connect with the GNSR in Elgin. The station building was demolished in the 1950s. It had been used as the stationmaster's house since the junction opened. 1863 The opening of the junction required a new 'triangular' station to be constructed to allow all trains entering Forres, from either the East or West, to access the new line directly on a curve. The three curved platforms, and three junctions, gave the new Forres station its distinctive layout. The location of the new station was south-west of the existing Inverness-Aberdeen line. The original line was retained as a goods loop, with trains now leaving and re-joining the line (east-west) on a curve. Services from Inverness to Perth curved to the south on a junction at the west of the station, to arrive at the southbound platforms. Both Inverness-Keith and Inverness-Perth trains had double platforms for trains travelling in both directions. Since it was the mainline south, generous platforms were constructed to accommodate the expresses. Forres station, with an old Highland Railway locomotive Trains travelling from the east to the south had a single platform at the east of the station. This was not used for normal passenger services. The station was originally accessed from Tytler Street (originally 'Station Road'). Since the line and platform crossed the road, there was a gap in the east platform to allow the road into the station. The level crossing gates closed the entrance to the station, when the curve was used by trains. Three individual signal boxes controlled the junctions and each point of the triangle: *Forres East *Forres West *Forres South 1955 Forres station, as rebuilt 1956. During 1954‚Äì55, the station building was replaced with the current red brick building. This included a new ticket office, toilets and waiting rooms. The original 1863 building was constructed out of wood. The current building is located directly in front of the site of the 1863 station. Goods yard Wagon label from 1964 for a delivery of coke nuts to Dallas Dhu Distillery from Derwenthaugh Coke Works near Newcastle upon Tyne. Forres once had an extensive goods yard. Whisky from the Dallas Dhu distillery was moved from the distillery sidings in wagons, and coke used by the distillery was delivered via the yard. Locomotives were stored in a two-road engine shed equipped with coaling facilities and a turntable. Closure and remains The Inverness-Perth (via Forres) had become a secondary route following the eventual construction of the Inverness-Aviemore direct route by 1884. The Dava lines and platforms at Forres was eventually singled and a wall erected in its place of the down platform (now demolished). The Dava route closed to passenger traffic on 18 October 1965 (as a result of the Beeching Axe) and goods services ended completely by 1968.\\"Past The Tracks - The Aviemore to Forres line\\" www.imagine.fm; Retrieved 2013-12-19 A short section of the southbound platforms remains, whilst the trackbed is partially in use as a station car park. The exit from the station building to the Dava platforms still exists. The original gates protect a now abandoned corridor, with all waiting rooms and facilities now bricked-up. The east platform existed until the mid-1970s following closure of the junction to passengers in 1965 and to goods in 1967, after which the once extensive layout of Forres station was simplified to single track operations (with a passing loop to the east, at the former Forres East signal box). All traces of the part of the station has been obliterated by the construction of the Forres by-pass. For many years (until construction of the by-pass), one of the level crossing gates was retained for use as fencing beside the Royal Hotel. The Inverness-Aberdeen down platform was closed in 1965 and exists abandoned in-situ, although the track was lifted at closure. The standard Highland Railways over-bridge was removed, but the concrete bases remain and indicate its location. The signal boxes that controlled the west and the south junctions (Forres South, Forres West) have long gone, and no trace remains. The box at Forres East (latterly renamed 'Forres') remained in use until the old station was decommissioned on 6 October 2017. The box also supervised a level crossing and manual token exchanges between train drivers and the duty signaller would take place next to the box. The goods yard is now completely demolished and track lifted. The site is now overgrown and awaits development. However, the semaphore signal, and a short section of access track from the east, still exists. A single Highland Railway fencing post can be found at Robertson/Iowa Place, at the junction with Miekle Cruik. This was the location of a level crossing. Other demolished features The Nairn road crossed the railway on an over- bridge. This was located near to 'Old Bridge court' which was named in memory of the former railway bridge. No trace remains. The Grantown road also crossed the railway, on an over-bridge at the foot of Mannachie Road. The line emerged just to the right of the road to Thornhill farm. Another over-bridge remains further up Mannachie rise, where the trackbed can be found in a cutting. It is part filled as part of a housing development. The trackbed can be easily found out of Forres as part of The Dava Way. 2017 redevelopment After lengthy discussions in Scottish Parliament to replace the old station at Forres with a brand new reconfigured station equipped with double platforms,Parliament mentions station developments Transport Scotland eventually confirmed in March 2014 that this would indeed be the case. A ¬£170 million infrastructure improvement project was subsequently announced for the Aberdeen‚ÄìInverness line, to be completed by 2030.

The station is managed by Abellio ScotRail and is on the Aberdeen to Inverness Line. The station has two platforms linked by a footbridge, and a booking office/waiting room with a vending machine. One of the route's passing loops is located here, under the control of Inverness Signalling Centre (which also supervises an adjacent level crossing through CCTV).

History  Elgin was formerly served by two stations, one owned by the Highland Railway (first opened by the Inverness and Aberdeen Junction Railway and known as Elgin West) and one by the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNSR), which was first opened by the Morayshire Railway. The latter's lines to Lossiemouth and (where it joined the Strathspey Railway (GNoSR)) were subsequently joined by the GNSR Morayshire Coast line in 1886/7. All three of the GNSR routes were closed in the 1960s as a result of the Beeching Axe, with the Lossiemouth branch the first to go in April 1964 and the other two routes following in May 1968.Railscot: Chronology - Morayshire Railway www.railbrit.co.uk; Retrieved 2013-12-22 Both stations were located about one mile to the south of Elgin town centre, which made them inconvenient for local journeys, e.g. to Lossiemouth, and bus services soon eliminated much of the local passenger traffic - passengers would generally only use the train service if they were connecting to long-distance trains. The stations were less than 500 metres apart and linked by a footpath. The present station, formerly the West (ex-Highland) station, opened on 25 March 1858 was retained and was rebuilt in a modern style by British Rail in 1990. The GNSR station (known as Elgin East), opened on 10 August 1852, was closed with the end of services on the coast and Craigellachie lines on 6 May 1968.Butt (1995). Page 90. The GNSR station building is still used as office accommodation and stands on the site of the original Morayshire Railway station. A sizeable goods yard is still in operation on this site. Services The basic service at the station is (roughly) two-hourly in each direction (with peak extras) - west to Inverness and east to , though a small number of trains also start/terminate here from the Inverness direction. The first eastbound train each weekday continues through to and Edinburgh Waverley, with a balancing service in the opposite direction in the late evening. A single train per day terminates at Elgin having come from Kyle of Lochalsh on the west coast via Inverness.

He then notices Michael's tattoo and sees the hidden \\"maze\\" in it. Meanwhile, Veronica Donovan (Robin Tunney) meets with Nick Savrinn (Frank Grillo) from \\"Project Justice\\", who wants to assist. They question Lincoln regarding the evidence, which he insists was planted. Sucre (Amaury Nolasco) is visited by his cousin, Hector Avila (Kurt Caceres), who tells him that Maricruz (Camille Guaty) is with him now. He eventually gets hold of Maricruz, and learns that Hector told her lies to get her not to come. With this new development, Sucre urges Michael to get him back into the cell. Michael manages to get hold of two chemicals and uses them to corrode a pipe underneath the infirmary as part of the escape plan. He returns to his cell and notices Haywire has drawn his entire tattoo and ponders the pathway. Michael purposely injures himself to get the officers to take Haywire away before the plan is exposed. Sucre gets transferred back to Michael's cell and continues the plan. Agent Kellerman (Paul Adelstein) suspects that Scofield may try to break Lincoln out and orders to transfer Scofield out the very next day.

After the war, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Winship to become a judge advocate in the Army's Judge Advocate General's Corps. His duties, though 1917, included teaching at the United States Military Academy and authoring, with John Henry Wigmore, the dean of Northwestern University's law school, the Army's first rules of evidence for courts-martial.Joshua Kastenberg, To Raise and Discipline an Army: Major General Enoch Crowder, the Judge Advocate General's Office, and the Realignment of Civil and Military Relations in World War I.

Winship commanded the 110th and 118th Infantry Regiments in the 28th Division while also serving as the Staff Judge Advocate of First Army. Winship was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for \\"extraordinary heroism in action near Lachaussee, France, November 9, 1918.\\" He also received the Silver Star for gallantry in action near Villers sur Fere, France.\\"Regimental History\\", The Judge Advocate General's Corps Following the war, Winship returned to military law. He was appointed to serve as a military aide to President Calvin Coolidge. Eventually he became the Judge Advocate General of the Army, a position he held from 1931 to his retirement from service in 1933. Governor of Puerto Rico Governor Winship (left) meeting with Virgin Islands governor Lawrence W. Cramer (standing) and Senator Millard Tydings, before the Senate's Territories and Insular Affairs Committee met to consider legislation for U.S. Territories in April, 1938 In 1934, Winship was appointed by Franklin D. Roosevelt as governor of Puerto Rico, succeeding Robert Hayes Gore. This was in part due to major strikes that had taken place that year, causing the administration to fear social unrest. Colonel Francis Riggs accompanied Winship as chief of police. Riggs formerly had assisted Nicaragua's dictator Anastasio Somoza. As governor, Winship's primary mission was to crush the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, by imprisoning its leadership and intimidating the rank-and-file membership.A. W. Maldonado, Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n: Puerto Rico's Democratic Revolution, (San Juan, PR: Editorial Universidad de Puerto Rico, 2006) p. 121. Upon arrival he immediately set out to \\"militarize\\" the Insular Police force, arming it with machine guns and riot control equipment. Winship also recruited a new police chief, E. Francis Riggs, whose background was in military intelligence, and whose immediate prior occupation had been to \\"advise\\" Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua. Together, Winship and Riggs spent their weekends inspecting the new vigorous police training camps (modeled after military boot camps) which they created throughout the island.A. W. Maldonado, Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n: Puerto Rico's Democratic Revolution, (San Juan, PR: Editorial Universidad de Puerto Rico, 2006) pp. 119‚Äì121. During his time in office, Winship fought to exclude the recently passed minimum wage laws from applying to Puerto Rico, as it would have doubled the hourly wage of 12.5 cents which was standard for sugarcane plantation workers. Winship criticized many of Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes's policies toward the island (Interior had responsibility for territories and insular affairs). Relief spending during the Great Depression for Puerto Rico was (per capita) far below either that of the mainland or Hawaii. This lack of spending contributed to the poverty of the island, and in turn to social unrest. In October 1935, the Insular Police killed four Puerto Rican Nationalist Party members at the University of Puerto Rico in Rio Piedras, a neighboring town next to San Juan. The event became known as the R√≠o Piedras massacre.Aida Belen Rivera Ruiz, Certifying Official, and Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and Jacqueline Pagan, Architect.

Pagan, Pedro Qui√±ones, Eduardo Rodr√≠guez Vera, Jos√© Santiago Barea and a bystander were killed. On February 23, 1936, the nationalists Hiram Rosado and El√≠as Beauchamp retaliated by killing Col. Riggs in San Juan. Captured, both Rosado and Beauchamp were executed at the police headquarters without trial. No law enforcement officer ever stood trial for the executions. Following these events, the government rounded up numerous Nationalist Party members and charged them with sedition. The party's president, Pedro Albizu Campos, and others were sentenced to 10 years in prison by a United States federal court. =The Ponce massacre= Relatives of victims killed in the Ponce massacre. Machine gun bullet holes are visible in the wall. (Ponce, Puerto Rico)On Palm Sunday (March 21), 1937, Governor Winship cancelled a Nationalist parade, which was to have taken place in Ponce to commemorate the 1873 abolition of slavery, only an hour before it was to have begun. When the march continued anyway, Winship ordered police to fire upon the marchers and bystanders. They killed 19 people and wounded more than 200, all of whom were unarmed. 150 protesters were arrested. This event, called the Ponce massacre, sparked outrage across the island and in the U.S. Congress. The Minnesota Representative John Bernard gave a speech on April 14 denouncing the action. The full speech can be seen in the Congressional Record of April 14, 1937, page 4499. Congressman Vito Marcantonio of New York also criticized Winship, and in 1939, President Roosevelt eventually replaced him as governor of Puerto Rico. Congressman Vito Marcantonio, Five Years of Tyranny , The World of Piri Thomas: Piri Thomas official website. Note: The entire speech is contained in the Congressional Record of August 14, 1939. Part of it reads: Retrieved November 23, 2009. Following these events, many of the leaders of the Nationalist party were tried for insurrection, and after a hung jury and retrial, six were sentenced to life in prison. Because the prosecutors were appointed by Governor Winship, Congressmen Vito Marcantonio and John T. Bernard suggested that this may have contributed to a bias in Winship's favor. A second panel, an independent investigation led by Arthur Garfield Hays, general counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union, with Fulgencio Pinero, Emilio Belaval, Jose Davila Rice, Antonio Ayuso Valdivieso, Manuel Diaz Garcia, and Franscisco M. Zeno, as members, concluded that the police acted as a mob, and that the events on March 21 constituted a massacre. Their report harshly criticized the repressive tactics and massive civil rights violations by the administration of Governor Winship. =Removal from office= Following the events of the Ponce massacre, a grand jury convened to investigate the Ponce events, but it was closed before it could indict anyone. The prosecutor investigating the case reported at a news conference that Governor Winship was interfering with his investigation and resigned under protest. Almost simultaneously with the prosecutor's investigation, a federal law which allowed public officials to be indicted was repealed, effectively granting Governor Winship immunity from further prosecution. The following year, Governor Winship moved the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the United States invasion of Puerto Rico from the traditional San Juan location to the city of Ponce. During this celebration, on July 25, 1938, √Ångel Esteban Antongiorgi attempted to assassinate the governor and managed to fire several shots before being killed by the police (one police officer was also killed in the attempted assassination). Congressional turmoil continued to cloud the Winship governorship and President Roosevelt removed Winship from office on May 12, 1939 after charges were filed against him by New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio. President Roosevelt appointed William D. Leahy as Winship's successor, although Leahy did not take office for several months (during which time Jos√© E. Col√≥m served as acting governor). World War II left During World War II, Winship returned to active duty. During this time, he set precedents for military tribunals in the United States during participation in the military commission (created in July 1942) to try Nazi saboteurs arrested in this country. Winship retired for good in 1944. At 75, he was at that time the oldest Army officer on active duty. Legacy and death Winship's term had united many of the political factions in Puerto Rico against him. The newly formed Popular Democratic Party (PPD) had strong wins in 1940, taking a majority of seats in the Senate of Puerto Rico, and continued to gain strength through the 1940s. By 1950, the PPD held all but one seat in the senate. However, Winship‚Äôs infamous role in the Ponce Massacre resulted in his dismissal as governor of Puerto Rico in 1939 proving to be an everlasting stain on his legacy. Winship died in the United States and was buried at the Rosehill Cemetery in Georgia.

History of Iranian modernity  Long before the European Renaissance generated the radical ideas that eventually reshaped Europe and the United States, Persian statesmen, artists, and intellectuals had formulated ideas that strikingly anticipate those of modernity. Since more than thousand years ago there has been a conflict in Persia between the search for modernity and the forces of religious obscurantism. Some twenty-five hundred years ago, when Herodotus was writing his Histories, Persia was the West's ultimate other. It has been a common belief of scholars that modernity began in the West and is by its philosophical nature, economic underpinning, and cultural exigencies a uniquely western phenomenon. All other cultures, those who have lived on the darker side of Renaissance must emulate the Western experience, if they want to be modern. From Max Weber to Milan Kundera, many Western scholars and writers have argued that everything from representative democracy and rational thought to the art of the novel and the essay are not only western in origin but also uniquely suited to its culture, and native to its temperature climes. Persia with its impressively rich and varied cultural legacy had a formative role in shaping Western consciousness. The Bible is replete with profuse praise for Persia and its kings. The Bible's praise for Cyrus the Great was partially in recognition of his role in freeing the Jews from their Babylonian captivity; of equal importance was the fact that the vast Persian empire of the time was a paragon of religious and cultural tolerance. Hegel whose writings are considered by many as the apex of the Western philosophical tradition, uses superlatives in praising the role of Persia and Zarathustra in history. Following Hegel in 19th-century Germany, Nietzsche wrote his magnum opus, Thus Spoke Zarathustra that similarly touched upon this key figure of the Persian imagination. Nietzsche's book offers a radical critique, almost a total debunking, of the whole Western tradition of philosophy. It is no mere accident that Nietzsche chose to articulate his critical views in the name of Zarathustra. The end of the 19th century was not the only or the last time Zarathustra played a prominent role in shaping Western consciousness and philosophic discourse. In 1990s Persian influences on the millennial fever, and on other New Age themes, were so strong that Harold Bloom, the eminent American critic, suggested that the last decade of the twentieth century should in truth be called \\"a return to Zoroastrian origins.\\" Western art, no less than history and theology, bear testimony to the ubiquity of the Persian presence in antiquity. Of all the extant works of Greek tragedy, for example, the only one that is about a non-Greek subject is Aeschylus' play The Persians.  Generations of Iranian intellectuals  Portrait of Iranian prime minister, Amir Kabir by Sani ol molk. First generation The nineteenth century Persian reformers who are considered as the first generation of Iranian intellectuals were perfectly conscious of the fact that it was not enough to rely upon the antiquity of Persian civilization to think about its continued ability to survive. They tried to establish a relationship with men of power that would have permitted them to dictate their blueprints for reforms. These blueprints naturally remained without immediate impact among the men of power to whom they were addressed. These intellectual reforms encountered a widespread opposition from the court and the Ulama. Abd al-Rahim Talebof, Fath-'Ali Akhoundzadeh, and Sani o Doleh belong to this generation. Second generation The second generation intended to introduce modern civilization to Persia, not only by imitating the West, but through a coherent and systematic approach to European culture. Mohammad-Taqi Bahar, Ali Dashti, Ali Akbar Davar, Mohammad-Ali Foroughi, Sadeq Hedayat, Bozorg Alavi, Ahmad Kasravi, Saeed Nafisi, Hasan Taqizadeh, Abdolhossein Teymourtash and \`Abdu'l-Bah√° belong to this generation. Third generation The third generation of Iranian intellectuals signify the absorption of Russian Marxism into Iranian political and social thought. With the popularity of Marxist ideology among the third generation of Iranian intellectuals, the new culture for translation and knowledge of modernity was drawn inevitably toward moral and political absolutes. Intellectuals claimed to be \\"givers of lessons\\" and acted as \\"moral legislators\\" who were critics of both the state and the society. Jalal Al-e-Ahmad and Ali Shariati belong to this generation. Fourth generation Fourth generation of Iranian intellectuals are mainly characterized by the journals such as Goftegu and Kiyan. In contrast with the ideological generation of Iranian intellectuals who in their encounter with the western modernity favoured a monistic attitude exemplified by Marxist and Heideggerian philosophies, the Fourth Generation of Iranian intellectuals decided on a move away and a critical distanciation from master ideologies. The methodological position of the new generation of Iranian intellectuals is characterized by two main philosophical attitudes: the extension of an anti- utopian thinking on an intersubjective basis on the one hand, and the urge for a non-imitative dialogical exchange with the modern values of the West on the other. Javad Tabatabaei and Abdolkarim Soroush among many others belong to the fourth generation.  Modern art movement  Sahabi family (Ezzatollah Sahabi, Yadollah and Haleh Sahabi) are symbols of intellectuals who brought politics and ethics together. Iranian experience and development of modernity led to a unique style of cinema, painting and music. Iranian New wave, a movement in Iranian cinema, has found worldwide reputation due to its deeply Philosophical, poetic and artistic style. Abbas Kiarostami is the most notable figure in the New wave of Iranian cinema. In the artistic and aesthetic realm, features of New wave of Persian cinema, for example the works of Abbas Kiarostami, can be classified as postmodern. In his book Close Up: Iranian Cinema, Past, Present, Future (2001) Hamid Dabashi describes modern Iranian cinema and the phenomenon of [Iranian] national cinema as a form of cultural modernity. According to Dabashi, \\"the visual possibility of seeing the historical person (as opposed to the eternal Qur'anic man) on screen is arguably the single most important event allowing Iranians access to modernity.\\" Mehdi Saeedi, is an internationally renowned artist and designer. His aesthetics have become a mainstay of design in many regions, especially in those using the Arabic script as their alphabet. And on November (2009) he won Grand Price for the Five Star Designers at International Invitational Poster Triennial in Osaka, Japan. On 13 December 2006, graphic designer, Reza Abedini, received the Principal Award in the Prince Claus Awards for his way of applying the knowledge and accomplishments of Iran's artistic heritage, renewing them, and making them exciting again. Reza Abedini's Persian Sym style unites the rich calligraphic tradition of Persian culture with \\"modernity\\". It is believed that Ebrahim Golestan, Fereydoon Rahnama and Farrokh Ghaffari founded Iran's \\"different\\" cinematic style and Iranian intellectual movement in the 20th century. Marcos Grigorian and Hossein Zenderoudi were pioneers of Iranian modern painting and Sculpture. Modern and contemporary architecture movement Although the new era in Iranian architecture began with the rise of Safavid dynasty, (1501 - 1736), in fact, it is in the early decades of the twentieth century that the first generation of modern Iranian architects, almost like every generation of modern architects in the world, appears as being influenced by the Modern Movement and rationalism in architecture. Architects such as Vartan Hovanesian, Ali Sadegh, Mohsen Foroughi, Paul Akbar, Gabriel Guevrekian, Heydar Ghiai, Abdolaziz Farmanfarmaian and Hooshang Seyhoun are examples of this movement. Later, in the mid-1960s, Ali Sardar Afkhami, Kamran Diba and Nader Ardalan are among those Iranian architects who have opened their design approach to the history and traditions to represent a trend of Iranian Post-Modernism. Attention for the new trends in international architecture, is being carried out by Iranian architects, even after the Islamic Revolution. Like most architectural milieu of the world, in the 1980s the experiments on the transition from post-modernism to new developments, has influenced many Iranians architects, in architects such as Reza Daneshmir, Farhad Ahmadi, and Darab Diba. In this context, It is of interest the attempt by some architects like Abbas Gharib or Bahram Shirdel to go in deep within the most advanced theory and trends in contemporary and Post-contemporary architecture, such as the theory of Complex systems in architecture in the case of Gharib and folding Theory in the case of Shirdel. These experiments are valid methods and contribution to liberate architecture and design, from abstraction, flatness, stiffness, forced rectangular and Heterotopia of the modernist spaces for a more fluid, flexible, soft and dynamic architecture, open to the complexities of its environment and context Music movement Simultaneous with the constitutional revolution in Iran, young musicians sought new forms of music to synchronize with the tide of social changes. In 1937, Tehran's Symphonic Orchestra started working and performing western as well as Iranian music. The 1979 revolution launched a renaissance in Persian classical music. The emergence of three ensembles, the Aref Ensemble, the Sheyda Ensemble and the Masters of Persian Music revolutionized Iranian music during the late 20th century and at the turn of the millennium. New figures emerged in Persian Symphonic Music, and several symphony orchestras started their work despite a lack of support from national governments or international bodies. The new wave can be characterized by growing interest in using both Iranian and European instruments and musical genres. Perhaps the best examples are the Melal Orchestra and the National Iranian Symphony Orchestra. Folk music also enjoyed the emergence of figures such as Sima Bina and Kamkar. These musicians introduced Iranian folk music (Khorasani, Kurdish, Bandari, Mazandarani music, among others) to the international community by organizing numerous concerts worldwide.  Letters  Sadeq Hedayat Bahram Bayzai Literary criticism and comparative literature in Iran entered a new phase in the 19th century. Persian literature enjoyed the emergence of influential figures as Sadeq Hedayat, Ahmad Kasravi, Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub, Shahrokh Meskoob, Ebrahim Golestan and Sadegh Choubak.  Poetry after classics  Modern Persian poetry came into existence after Nima Yushij. Some notable figures include: * Nima Yushij * Bijan Jalali * Fereydoon Moshiri * Forough Farrokhzad * Manouchehr Atashi * Mehdi Akhavan-Sales * Hushang Ebtehaj * Ahmad Shamlou * Mohammad Ali Sepanloo * Mohammad Reza Shafiei-Kadkani * Mohammad Zohari * Simin Behbahani * Sohrab Sepehri  Drama  After the translation of Mirza Fatali Akhundov's plays into Persian in the 19th century, Persian drama came into a new period. 20th century saw the appearance of great playwrights such as Bahram Beyzai and Akbar Radi. Modern scientific movement Mohammad-Nabi Sarbolouki, an influential figure in science policy making, prominent scientist and one of the pioneers of biotechnology and biomaterial research in Iran The history of modern science in Iran dates back to the year 1851 and the establishment of Darolfonoon ‚Äì which was founded as a result of the efforts of Mirza Taghi Khan Amir Kabir, aiming at training and teaching Iranian experts on many fields of sciences, and it was the future minded Abbas Mirza who first dispatched students to Europe to obtain a western education.Patrick Clawson and Michael Rubin. Eternal Iran. Palgrave Macmillan. 2005. p.34 By the establishment of Tehran University, science in Iran entered a new phase. Mahmoud Hessaby, Ali Asghar Hekmat, Moslem Bahadori and many others played roles in initiating and forming these movements. The outcome of the movement has been the emergence of researchers who have been trained and received doctorate degrees in the country and have found international reputations. Modernization of Iranian medicine did not occur through the straightforward replacement of traditional Persian medicine by modern European medicine. Rather, the integration of modern medicine went through a long process that included both the reinterpretation of traditional theories by traditional physicians and the assimilation of modern theories through the prism of traditional medicine. One of the main Iranian scientific movements in the late 20th century was in the field of chemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry. The main leaders of this movement were Abbas Shafiee, Bijan Farzami, Mohammad-Nabi Sarbolouki, Issa Yavari and Ahmad Reza Dehpour. The movement resulted in hundreds of research papers in peer reviewed international journals. Other notable figures who promoted world-class research in Iran during the 20th century are: Reza Mansouri and Yousof Sobouti (Physics), Abolhassan Farhoudi (Immunology), Mohammad Reza Zarrindast (Pharmacology), Fereydoun Davatchi (Rheumatology), Taher Movassaghian (Chemistry), Ardeshir Ghavamzadeh (Hematology), Ali Radmehr (Radiology), Hossein Najmabadi (Medical genetics), Hormoz Shams (Ophthalmology), Moslem Bahadori (Pathology), Hormoz Dabirashrafi (Obstetrics and Gynecology), Hossein Esteky (Neuroscience), G.R. Baradaran Khosroshahi (Mathematics), Caro Lucas (Electrical Engg., AI), Jawad Salehi (Electrical Engg.) and Ali Kaveh (Civil Engg.). Iran's university population has swelled from 100,000 in 1979 to 2 million in 2006. Indeed, in Iran some 70% of science and engineering students are women. Iran is now a world leader in some areas like string theory. When a reporter for Nature asked Reza Mansouri: \\"Why do I see so many string theory papers coming out of Iran?\\" He explained how Iranian scientists worked together under revolution, sanctions and war to bring Iran to such a position: \\"I remember exactly the beginning of the revolution, some old colleagues just sat together and spoke about what we could do for Iran. Is it understood that we have to look for excellence, in some areas that we may be strong and that we may get strong at that so that will be the field of physics. So we began with that. It happens that the most active field physicists in our country were working on the string theory at that time. So they tried to be of a school, so to speak, and we did know that that was the only way which was somehow independent of all these political fluctuations regarding war, regarding cultural revolution, all that, and we really tried hard to build up schools. So we have it now, string schools, so to say somehow.\\" In 2007 United Nations awarded Hossein Malek-Afzali with the prestigious UN Population Award. Malek Afzali has helped design strategies to improve health procedures, particularly adolescent health, reproductive health and family planning. In the field of reproductive health, he has engaged policymakers and religious leaders in the planning and implementation of reproductive health programmes in Iran.  Iranian women's movement  Currently women's rights groups are among the most active social rights groups in Iran and are mostly involved in an effort to gain equal rights for women in the Iranian legal system by opposing specific discriminatory laws. However, under the Presidential regime of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, elected President in 2005, women's rights advocates have been beaten, jailed and persecuted.UN: Hold Ahmadinejad Accountable for Iran Rights Crisis, Human Rights Watch, September 18, 2008; accessed September 21, 2008.Iranian Dissidents at Forum Speak On Ahmadinejad, Women's Rights, New York Sun, Special to the Sun, October 17, 2007; accessed September 21, 2008.victory on marriage legislation, Borzou Daragahi, Los Angeles Times, September 3, 2008; accessed September 21, 2008. The presence of women in Iranian intellectual movements (science, modern literature, cinema, human-rights activism, etc.) has been remarkable throughout the history of modern Iran. According to the research ministry of Iran, women accounted for 56% of all university students in the natural sciences, including one in five Ph.D. students. Such education and social trends are increasingly viewed with alarm by the Iranian government.Women graduates challenge Iran, Francis Harrison, BBC, September 26, 2006; accessed September 21, 2008.Iran: Does Government Fear Educated Women?, Iraj Gorgin, Radio Free Europe, February 10, 2008; accessed September 21, 2008. In cinema and the visual arts, Shirin Neshat, Tahmineh Milani, Rakhshan Bani Etemad, and Samira Makhmalbaf created new cinematic styles which have attracted many from all over the world and in international festivals. Persian poet and literary figure Simin Behbahani was nominated for 1997 Nobel Prize for literature. The 2003 Nobel Peace Prize went to Shirin Ebadi for her efforts for democracy and human rights, especially for the rights of women and children. Simin Daneshvar's Savushun is a novel about the Iranian experience of modernity during the 20th century. Iranian writer and satirist, Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi was perhaps the first professional female satirist, critic and one of the notable figures involved in Persian constitutional revolution. In the early 20th century, Persian music enjoyed the emergence of Qamar ol-Molouk Vaziri, the \\"Lady of Iranian music\\".  Historical landmarks  Persian constitutional revolution Iran had undergone a phenomenal constitutional revolution at the turn of the twentieth century. The constitutional movement was concerned with modernity and human rights. It led to the establishment of a parliament in Iran. Mirza Jahangir-Khan Shirazi and Farrokhi Yazdi were among the most notable writers and critics of this era who sacrificed their lives for establishment of democracy and freedom in Iran. 28 Mordad coup In the 1953 Iranian coup d'√©tat, known in Iran as the 28 Mordad coup, the Prime Minister of Iran Mohammad Mosaddegh was overthrown on 19 August 1953. The coup d'√©tat was orchestrated by the United Kingdom (under the name 'Operation Boot') and the United States (under the name TPAJAX Project).CLANDESTINE SERVICE HISTORY: OVERTHROW OF PREMIER MOSSADEQ OF IRAN, Mar. 1954: p iii.The CIA's history of the 1953 coup in Iran is made up of the following documents: a historian's note, a summary introduction, a lengthy narrative account written by Dr. Donald N. Wilber, and, as appendicies, five planning documents he attached. Published June 18, 2000 by The New York Times Mossadegh had sought to reduce the semi-absolute role of the Shah granted by the Constitution of 1906, thus making Iran a full democracy, and to nationalize the Iranian oil industry, consisting of vast oil reserves and the Abadan Refinery, both owned by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, a British corporation (now BP). A military government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad-RezƒÅ ShƒÅh Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran (Persian for an Iranian king), to effectively rule the country as an absolute monarch according to the constitution. He relied heavily on United States support to hold on to power until his own overthrow in February 1979.U.S. foreign policy in perspective: clients, enemies and empire. David Sylvan, Stephen Majeski, p. 121. In August 2013 the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) admitted that it was involved in both the planning and the execution of the coup, including the bribing of Iranian politicians, security and army high-ranking officials, as well as pro-coup propaganda.CIA finally admits it masterminded Iran‚Äôs 1953 coup RT News The CIA is quoted acknowledging the coup was carried out \\"under CIA direction\\" and \\"as an act of U.S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government.\\"  Iranian Revolution  Some researchers believe that the Iranian Revolution was not a simple clash between modernity and tradition but an attempt to accommodate modernity within a sense of authentic Islamic identity, culture and historical experience. Perceived by many as a revolt against the secular modernity of the West, Iranian revolution was welcomed by some Western thinkers as a triumph of spiritual values over the profane world of capitalist materialism. For others the Iranian revolution was a protest against the very political rationality of the modern era.  2nd of Khordad movement  The election of the former President Mohammad Khatami in May 1997 was through the emergence of a new political force, the youth. Inspired by simultaneously individualist and democratic ideals that are incompatible in every respect with the authoritarian values and symbols traditionally associated in the Iranian intellectual arena with Marxist and Heideggerian World views. It is in this new social atmosphere that the emergence of a global community or a cyberpolis was able to reveal to the Iranian youth the true nature of instrumental rationality as modern universal standards. Saeed Hajjarian was widely believed to be the main strategist behind the 1997 reform movement of Iran. He allegedly showed the supremacy of politics as such over any religious norm when he said that the survival of the Islamic Republic was paramount and that no religious ritual should stand in its way. This kind of decision, he states, means that politics are more important than religion and that this acknowledges the secularization of religion. In this context, he argues, it is possible to reassess velayat faqih and to reject its supremacy within the political field in Iran. While calling to build a new reform movement, Hajjarian believes that the reform movement started in 1997, died during Khatami's second term. He believes that the reform project started by Persian constitutional revolution, has not been completed yet.(ref: Farhad Khosrokhavar, The New Intellectuals in Iran, Social Compass, Vol. 51, No. 2, 191-202 (2004)) The scope of 2nd of Khordad movement was much broader than President Khatami's reform plan. The latter has been criticised for wanting slow progress and not producing a real democratic alternative for the current Islamic republic. When asked about this during Khatami's visit to United Kingdom, he said \\"You know for centuries we have been under dictatorship so we cannot get to a democracy all of a sudden, we have to go step by step\\"  Campaigns against intellectuals  After the Iranian Revolution, the Cultural Revolution and the Chain murders of Iran were two major campaigns that involved the imprisonment, torture, emigration, and massacre of Iranian scholars. Intellectual circles in late 20th century Intellectual circles in postrevolutionary Iran can be classified into the following categories:  Revolutionary intellectual circles  The main figures in this category are Ali Shariati, Jalal Al Ahmad and Morteza Motahhari. Morteza Motahhari was the main theorist and thinker behind Iranian revolution. He is considered to be one of the most influential philosophical leaders of pre-revolutionary Iran and the impact and popularity of his thought continues to be felt throughout Iranian society many years later.  Reformist intellectual circles  Iranian scholar Mehdi Bazargan was an advocate of democracy and civil rights. He also opposed the cultural revolution and US embassy takeover. Main figures in this category are Mehdi Bazargan, Abdolkarim Soroush, Mohammad Mojtahed Shabestari, Mostafa Malekian, Mohsen Kadivar, Alireza Alavitabar and Hossein Bashiriyeh. The unifying traits of these intellectuals include their recognition of reform in the Islamic thought, democracy, civil society and religious pluralism and their opposition to the absolute supremacy of the Faqih. The rise of religious intellectuals can be followed through the writings of Abdolkarim Soroosh. Soroosh's main idea is that there are perennial unchanging religious truths, but our understanding of them remains contingent on our knowledge in the fields of science and philosophy. Unlike Ali Shariati, who turned to Marxism to bring a historicist perspective to the Shiite thought, Soroosh debates the relation between democracy and religion and discusses the possibility of what he calls religious democracy. Influenced by Persian mysticism, Soroush advocated a type of reformist Islam that went beyond most liberal Muslim thinkers of the 20th century and argued that the search for reconciliation of Islam and democracy was not a matter of simply finding appropriate phrases in the Qur'an that were in agreement with modern science, democracy, or human rights. Drawing on the works of Molana Jalaleddin Balkhi, Immanuel Kant, G.W.F. Hegel, Karl Popper, and Erich Fromm, Soroush called for a reexamination of all tenets of Islam, insisting on the need to maintain the religion's original spirit of social justice and its emphasis on caring for other people. Other influential figures in these circles are Saeed Hajjarian, Ahmad Sadri, Mahmoud Sadri, Ezzatollah Sahabi, Ahmad Ghabel and Hassan Yousefi Eshkevari. Akbar Ganji had also been associated with this circle before he published his Manifest of Republicanism. Moreover, Akbar Ganji took a tour around the world in order to invite non Iranian intellectuals to join Iran's intellectual movement. Many Persian scholars believe that such interactions with world scholars would promote Iranian intellectualism and democratic reform. Richard Rorty, Noam Chomsky, Anthony Giddens, David Hild, Shmuel Noah Eisenstadt among a few others accepted the honorary membership of Iranian intellectual society. Perhaps the most important achievement of this circle was training a new generation of Iranian intellectuals who are far ahead of their mentors and do not belong to any of well-established intellectual circles in Iran. Ahmad Zeidabadi and Mehdi Jami belong to this new generation of Persian scholars. Democratic religious circles (In-system reformers) These groups are characterized by the followings: *Support for Islamic republic as the best form of government *Calling for Religious tolerance *Calling for democratic values *Rejecting liberalism *Rejecting secularism *Calling for the rule of law and civil society *They believe that ethics has priority over politics. The main thinker and theorist of this circle is Mohammad Khatami, former president of Iran. Other notable figures include Yousef Sanei, Abdollah Noori, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mostafa Moin. They are mainly under the influence of ideas of Ayatollah Mirza Hossein Na'eeni and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.  Neo- conservative intellectual circles  Unlike the reformist intellectuals, the neo- conservative intellectuals in Iran are in favor of the supremacy of the Leader and against concepts such as democracy, civil society and pluralism. This movement includes figures such as Reza Davari Ardakani, Javad Larijani and Mehdi Golshani. The famous personality among these is Reza Davari Ardakani, who as an anti- Western philosopher is very familiar with the works of Martin Heidegger. Davari, unlike Soroosh, takes some of the features of Heidegger's thought, mainly the critic of modernity and puts it into an Islamic wording. He rejects the Western model of democracy, which is based on the separation of politics and religion.  Non-religious intellectual circles  Main figures in this category are Javad Tabatabaei, Dariush Shayegan, Amir Hossein Aryanpour, Ramin Jahanbegloo, Ehsan Naraghi, Khosro Naghed, Abbas Milani, and Aramesh Doustdar. Javad Tabtabaei deplores the deep roots of religion in the Iranian culture. For Tabatabai, the decline of the Iranian political thought goes back to the 9th and 10th centuries and, since then, it has been impossible for them to adequately understand the modernity. The social sciences, according to him, have been introduced in Iran without the secularization of thought and its rationalization and therefore, they reproduce in an unconscious way the ancient prejudices and the inability to think adequately. Dariush Shayegan criticizes a view of religion that does not take into account the major trends of the modern world where cultural homogeneity and religious absolutism are questioned. The quest for a holistic identity based on a monolithic view of Islam is alien to the evolution of modern world and means the isolation and regression of the (Iranian) society. Dariush Shayegan, who writes mainly in French (but has been extensively translated into Persian), shares some of the views of these particular intellectuals, but his major contribution is to invite Iranians to accept the ‚Äò‚Äòfragmented identity‚Äô‚Äô of the modern world and to renounce a unitary view of the Self which leads to a fascination with utopian and mythological ideologies. He insists that, since Iran has undergone the change directly from tradition to postmodernity without the mediation of modernity, it is experiencing a strong malaise. His solution is to open up Iran to the new multicultural world in which one has to accept the diversity of the perspectives and, therefore, to be tolerant towards others who do not think and behave in the same way as the Self. This invitation to become open-minded and to give up the idea of a homogeneous culture exerts an undeniable influence on many young people in Iran.  Traditional scholars  The most notable circle was associated with Hossein Nasr, founder of Imperial Iranian Academy of Philosophy. For Nasr, the traditional world was pervaded by a tremendous sense of the Sacred and the Absolute, whereas the inception of modernity involved precisely the severing off of that awareness, resulting in what Max Weber would later dub the disenchantment of the world. Nasr has been an unrelenting opponent of Islamic fundamentalism in all its forms throughout his career because he sees it as a somewhat vigilante reactionary movement operating within the paradigm of the modern nation state, but even more so, because it lacks a well thought out metaphysical basis rooted in a traditional Muslim understanding of the world which respects both nature and human dignity.  Other notable figures  Prof Moslem Bahadori, one of the pioneering figures in modern Iranian medicine There are several intellectual figures who continue to be very influential in Iranian society, while they do not belong to any of the above-mentioned philosophical circles: Scholars: *Yadollah Sahabi, prominent academic, writer and scientist *Mohammad Gharib, pioneering physician and academic *Fereydoun Hoveyda (prominent scholar, writer and filmmaker) *Daryoush Ashouri (prominent scholar, linguist and cultural theorist) *Masoud Behnoud (prominent journalist and writer) *Parviz Varjavand (scholar, archeologist and expert of cultural heritage) *Farrokhroo Parsa (scholar, politician and physician; first female minister of Iran) Economists: *Mousa Ghaninejad (senior Iranian economist) *Fariborz Rais-Dana (senior economist) Experts on law and political sciences: *Davoud Hermidas- Bavand (prominent scholar and political scientist) *Amir Nasser Katouzian (Tehran University professor of law and political sciences) *Jamshid Momtaz (Tehran University professor of international law) *Javad Zarif (prominent scholar, political analyst and expert on international relations) *Sadeq Zibakalam (leading political scientist and professor of Tehran University) *Amir Attaran lawyer and immunologist; expert on public health and global development issues. *Elaheh Koulaei (political scientist and expert on USSR at Tehran University)  Philosophy education in Iran  Hoseiniyeh Ershad, where Ali Shariati used to hold many of his speeches. Philosophy has become a popular subject of study during last few decades in Iran. Comparing the number of philosophy books currently published in Iran with that in other countries, Iran possibly ranks first in this field but it is definitely on top in terms of publishing philosophy books. Currently different approaches are working in a diverging fields of philosophy: * 1. Traditional Persian Islamic philosophy. traditional classic philosophy revived after a period of silence, in Tehran School, and notably works of Agha Ali Modarres Zonoozi in the early 20th century, after him both schools of Tehran and Ghom (with the works of Allameh Tabatabai and Imam Ruhollah Khomayni) activated philosophical debates. Nowaday, Islamic philosophy is the most fresh period all over the world in Iran all the way after Sfavid school of Isfahan. The most notable figures of our time include Allameh Hossein tabatabaii, Allameh Rafiai Gazvini, Mehdi Hayeri Yazdi, Falatouri, Hasan zadeh Amoli, Morteza Motahhari, Abolhasan Jelveh, Mohammad tagi Amoli, allameh hossein Gharavi Isfahani (kompani), Ibrahim Ashtiyani, Jalaloddin Ashtiyani, Kazem assar. * 2. Western philosophy. The Western philosophy is mostly welcome to Iran in the 19th century, but its full development began in the 1970s, with the reactive movement against the left political thought of Soviet sect of Toodeh party, most notably by refutation of their Marxist‚ÄìLeninist works (typically in Tagi Arani's works). The leading figures include Allameh Tabatabai, and his pupil Morteza Motahhari. Also Ahmad Fardid and his Circle who introduced phenomenology and very specifically Martin Heidegger to Iranian Academia. His pupils like Reza Davari, Dariush Shayegan who are now among famous Iranian philosophers developed his way to interpret modern conditions in Iran. Today the most dominant branch of Western philosophy in Iranian academia is Continental philosophy; The domination of the department of philosophy of the University of Tehran over the teaching of philosophy with laying on Islamic philosophy and Continental philosophy put it ahead of philosophy education in Iran. Department of philosophy of the University of Tehran traditionally is the top place of the greatest philosophers in secular education system in Iran; among the philosophers of the University of Tehran to be named are Reza Davari, Ebrahimi Dinani, and Mahmoud Khatami whose influences are clear all over students of philosophy. Reza Davari who is a philosopher with great debates on Modern condition, intellectualism and enlightenment ranked as the leading Persian philosopher with anti-Western approach. His ideas challenge the defender of Western culture and notably the defender of analytical philosophy and scienticism. Dinani is a defender of Islamic philosophy who also talks about the west; Mahmoud khtami, who is commonly considered as a phenomenologist, is ranked as a totally scholar with no political sign who teaches analytical and continental philosophies in the university, but he has developed a different philosophy of his own that is called [Ontetics]. However, analytical philosophy is also introduced in Iran in the 1970s by the translations from British Empiricism, and then, in 1980 to the present an increasing interest is in students of philosophy to learn more from this 20th- century branch of philosophy. Very specifically, analytic philosophy of science and social science, and moral philosophy introduced by Abdolkarim Soroush in the early 1980s, and followed by others. Philosophy of mind introduced to Iranian academia by Mahmoud Khatami, and philosophy of logic and philosophy of language introduced by Hamid Vahid Dastgerdi. Philosophy of religion is also most welcome branch with the Iranian scholars. * 3. Comparative philosophy is a tendency in Iranian scholarship. * 4. Traditionalist (sonnatgera)is also an approach introduced by Hossein Nasr.

Commissioned by a group of Spokane businessmen, the hotel is named after Louis Davenport, its first proprietor and overseer of the project. Architect Kirtland Cutter designed the building in 1914. The Davenport Hotel was the first hotel in the United States with air conditioning, a central vacuum system, pipe organ, and dividing doors in the ballrooms. It is also the place at which the first Crab Louis (named after Louis Davenport) was created and served. The hotel is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Davenport Hotel was completely restored by developer Walt Worthy in 2002 and operates today under the name The Historic Davenport Hotel within The Davenport Hotel Collection brand along with its three sister hotels. History Early years Picture of the Davenport extracted from a 1903 hotel directory Lewellyn \\"Louis\\" Davenport came to Spokane Falls, Washington Territory, in the spring of 1889 at the age of 20. He had been a clerk in San Francisco and came up to Spokane to work the summer in his uncle's \\"Pride of Spokane Restaurant.\\" The summer of 1889 was fateful for Spokane and for Louis Davenport. In August, a fire tore through the infant metropolis, turning 32 square blocks of civilization to ashes. Young Davenport salvaged what he could from the rubble, bought a tent, and opened \\"Davenport's Waffle Foundry.\\" Spokane rebuilt quickly after the big fire. Washington became a state that winter and Spokane dropped the Falls from its name. With timber, mining, agriculture and the railroad pouring money and people into the region, the city of Spokane was in the middle of it all and poised to become one of the great cities of the West. Banquet at the Davenport Hotel in September 1908 Depiction of Davenport's Restaurant. ca 1912 Davenport recognized his opportunity and leased a brick building on the North-east corner of Sprague Avenue and Post Street the next year. He expanded his culinary offerings to nearly 100 items. Within a few years, Davenport's Restaurant was described by a critic as \\"the finest thing of the kind in the country.\\" Business was so good, Davenport expanded into an adjoining building within a decade. He hired up-and-coming architect, Kirtland Cutter, to make the two buildings appear as one in 1904. Cutter offered a Mission Revival style theme. The white stucco walls and red tile roofs stood in marked contrast to every other building downtown. This remodel added the finest ballroom in the West on the second floor, the Hall of the Doges. Construction of the hotel The Davenport Hotel was neither Louis Davenport's idea nor was it built with his money. Instead, Cutter and Davenport were chosen by a group of leading Spokane businessmen, who thought the growing city required a large, grand hotel in which to board and entertain their guests. Leveraging Davenport's already strong reputation, the Davenport Hotel Company was formed in 1912 and preparation of the site began that year. The hotel tower went up in eight months in 1913, using horse carts, steam jacks and hand tools. Not a single worker was seriously injured or killed ‚Äî a rarity for the time. Cutter and Davenport shopped the world for ideas and furnishings for their new hotel. Cutter designed spaces inspired by the great architects of France, England and Spain. Davenport filled them with fine art and songbirds and prepared to seat his guests at tables dressed in the finest Irish linens from Liddell (whose linens sailed on the Titanic) and set with 15,000 pieces of silver (the largest private commission ever created by Reed and Barton). The hotel opened for business on September 1, 1914, and held its grand opening celebrations from September 17-19, 1914.https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/bd21b975-754b-4c41-b171-4313a1787f46 Ever since then, the hotel has promoted itself as \\"one of America's exceptional hotels.\\" Hotel years The Davenport Hotel at Post and First The hotel was so successful that a 53-room addition was constructed in 1917, followed by an eleven-story addition on the south side in 1929, containing 80 more rooms.https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/bd21b975-754b-4c41-b171-4313a1787f46 The Davenport Hotel was home to the first commercially licensed radio station in Spokane‚ÄîKHQ, which signed on the air in 1922. From its tower on the roof of the hotel, KHQ broadcast the first voices many people pulled from the air across the vast expanses of the Inland Northwest. KHQ featured many local bands, including The Musicaladers. That group's drummer dropped out of Gonzaga University and became world-famous for his singing voice. His name was Harry \\"Bing\\" Crosby.http://www.spokesmanreview.com/news/live/body.asp?ID=library/davenport/history KHQ radio remained a strong voice on the air for more than half a century. Both KHQ and The Davenport Hotel went dark in 1985. In 1928, Louis Davenport bought out the hotel's other stockholders. On April 26, 1945, Davenport sold the hotel and the restaurant to the William Edris Company of Seatlle, for $1.5 million.https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/bd21b975-754b-4c41-b171-4313a1787f46 Edris sold the property two year later, in 1947, to a group of three Spokane investors. The following year, two of them sold their interest to three other investors. Seattle-based Western Hotels bought out three of the investors in 1949, and bought out the fourth investor in 1953. Davenport died in his suite at the hotel in 1951; his wife Verus in 1967. Western Hotels remodeled the Davenport in the early 1960s and re-positioned it as a motel, with a motor entrance. In 1967, the owners, by that point renamed Western International Hotels, sold the Davenport to San Francisco-based John S. McMillan for $2.6 million.https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/bd21b975-754b-4c41-b171-4313a1787f46 McMillan sold the hotel two years later, in 1969, to Basin Industries, which announced renovation plans, but then went bankrupt in 1972 when one of its owners was convicted of securities fraud. The hotel was foreclosed on by their lenders, Dallas-based Lomas & Nettleton, one of the nation's largest mortgage bankers. In 1979, former Montana governor Tim Babcock bought the hotel for $4.25 million, along with Warren Anderson, a former General Manager of the hotel. Anderson sold his interest to Babcock in 1983. Babcock had to surrender ownership of the financially ailing property back to Lomas & Nettleton in 1985, which closed the hotel immediately. Lomas & Nettleton went bankrupt in 1989.https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/25/business/bankruptcy-filing-by- lomas.html Demolition of the hotel was considered. By the time the Davenports' only son died in 1987, it was generally believed that the Davenport Hotel would be destroyed. A demolition crew determined the entire block could be dropped in 20 seconds but the nightmare of airborne asbestos saved it from implosion. Due to the potential cost of removing the asbestos covering all the building's original plumbing, demolition was determined to be more expensive than the value of the resulting lot.https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/apr/27/john-webster-mission- accomplished-friends-of-the-d/ A citizens' group called Friends of the Davenport was founded in 1986 by City Council member (and future Spokane mayor) Sheri Barnard, with the goal of saving the hotel.https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/apr/27/john-webster-mission- accomplished-friends-of-the-d/ They held annual fund raisers in the lobby of the shuttered hotel and sought a buyer to restore it. In 1990, they found a potential savior, in Hong Kong businessman Patrick Wai-Meng Ng. His Sun International Hotels & Properties bought the hotel for $5.25 million. Ng began phased renovations, including the restoration of the lobby's skylight, but was unable to reopen the property.https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/apr/27/john-webster-mission- accomplished-friends-of-the-d/ Restoration and reopening The restored Davenport Hotel is an integral part of the Davenport Arts District in Downtown Spokane The Hall of Doges In March 2000, local entrepreneurs Walt & Karen Worthy purchased the entire city block for $6.5 million, then spent two years and $38 million of their own money to restore The Davenport. The hotel's public spaces and ballrooms were restored to their original appearance, with real gold leaf around the fireplace. The hotel's guest floors were stripped to bare concrete and rebuilt, with fresh wiring, plumbing, drywall, furniture and fixtures. The Hall of the Doges, Spokane's oldest and finest ballroom, was removed from the oldest part of the structure and re-installed in the new East addition. The removal was accomplished by lifting the ballroom out intact, making it the only flying ballroom in the world. The Davenport Hotel reopened on July 15, 2002 and celebrated its grand reopening from September 13-15, 2002https://www.historylink.org/File/8280 with the ringing of a ship's bell eight times signaling a change of the watch. Lobby Ornate main lobby The first fire in the lobby fireplace was lit in September 1914 by Kirtland Cutter. Hotel proprietor Louis Davenport decreed that as a symbol of hospitality. Originally wood-burning, the fireplace now burns natural gas. The fireplace is kept burning year-round, as a symbol of hospitality and still following Mr. Davenport's request. The painting above the fireplace depicts the Ni√±a, Pinta, and Santa Mar√≠a - the ships Christopher Columbus used to discover the New World in 1492. Architecturally, the hotel has elements of Italy, France, England, Spain, and Imperial Russia. The lobby is inspired by the Spanish Renaissance style. The art glass panels in the ceiling give the hotel's single largest space an atrium effect. There is a separate glass roof above this one for protection. The ceiling beams are cast plaster with faux wood graining. Over time, much of the detail on these was lost to the eye due to decades of smoke in the lobby - both from the wood-burning fireplace and cigars/cigarettes. When the beams were cleaned in the renovation of 2000 - with spray bottles of Simple Green and toothbrushes - the burgundy, teal, and gold colors appeared as they were when new. Mr. Davenport explained the hotel's iconography this way in 1915: Notable residents Poet Vachel Lindsay lived in the hotel, room #1129, from 1924 until 1929.

For use in emergency situations, it produced more than 100% of the engine's normal rated power for a limited amount of time, often about five minutes. Similar systems used by non-US forces are now often referred to as WEP as well, although they may not have been at the time, as with the German Luftwaffe's Notleistung and Soviet VVS' forsazh systems. WEP in World War II aircraft Maximum normal power would be limited by a mechanical stop, for instance a wire across the throttle lever slot, but a more forceful push would break the wire, allowing extra power. In normal service, the P-51H Mustang was rated at 1,380 hp, but WEP would deliver up to 2,218 hp, an increase of 61%. In the P-51D Mustang, the model most produced and used during World War II, the WEP increased the HP from 1490 to 1720. The Vought F4U Corsair, not originally equipped for WEP, later boasted a power increase of up to 410 hp (17%) when WEP was engaged. Several methods were used to boost engine power by manufacturers, including water injection and methanol-water injection. Some earlier engines simply allowed the throttle to open wider than normal, allowing more air to flow through the intake. All WEP methods result in greater-than-usual stresses on the engine, and correspond to a reduced engine lifetime. For some airplanes, such as the P-51D, use of WEP required that the engine be inspected for damage before returning to the air.AAF Manual 51-127-3, Pilot Training Manual for the P-51 Mustang, USAAF, August 1945, p.14. 5 hours' total use of WEP on the P-51D required a complete tear-down inspection of the engine. British and Commonwealth aircraft could increase power by increasing the supercharger boost pressure. This modification was common by the summer of 1940, with the widespread availability of 100 octane fuel. Raising supercharger boost pressure from 6 lb to 12 lb increased the Merlin III engine rating to 1310 hp, an increase of over 250 hp. Pilots had to log the use of emergency boost and were advised not to use it for more than 5 minutes continuously. The German MW 50 methanol-water injection system required additional piping, as well as a storage tank, increasing the aircraft's overall weight. Like other boost techniques, MW 50 was restricted by capacity and engine temperatures and could only be used for a limited time. The GM 1 nitrous oxide injection system, also used by the Luftwaffe, provided extreme power benefits of 25 to 30 percent at high altitude by adding oxidizer gases but required cooling on the ground and, like the MW 50 boost system, added significant weight. One of the few German aircraft that could be equipped with both Notleistung systems, the late war Focke-Wulf Ta 152H high-altitude fighter, could attain a velocity of some 756 km/h (470 mph) with both systems used together. Kurt Tank reportedly once did this, using both boost systems simultaneously when he was flying a Junkers Jumo 213E-powered Ta 152H prototype fitted with both MW 50 and GM-1, to escape a flight of P-51D Mustangs in April 1945.  Modern times  Perhaps the most dramatic WEP feature was found in the MiG-21bis fighter jet. This late variant of the standard Soviet light fighter plane was built as a stopgap measure to counter the newer and more powerful American F-16 and F/A-18 fighters until the next-generation MiG-29 could be introduced to service. The MiG-21bis received the upgraded Tumansky R-25 engine, which retained the standard 42 / 65 kN normal and forsazh power settings of earlier R-13 powerplants, but added a second fuel pump to supply the new super-afterburning system with jet fuel. Use of this \\"diamond regime\\" provided a massive 97.4 kN of thrust for no more than 3 minutes in actual wartime use. Use of this temporary power gave the MiG-21bis slightly better than 1:1 thrust-to-weight ratio and a climbing rate of 254 meters/second, equalling the F-16's nominal capabilities in close- quarters dogfight. In air combat practice with the MiG-21bis, use of WEP thrust was limited to one minute, to reduce impact on the engine's 800 flight hours lifetime, since every second of super-afterburner use counted as several minutes of regular power run due to extreme thermal stress. When WEP was on, the R-25 engine produced a huge 5 meter long blowtorch exhaust - the six or seven brightly glowing rhomboid \\"shock diamonds\\" visible inside the flames gave the emergency-power setting its \\"diamond regime\\" name.  WEP in surface vehicles  Some modern military surface vehicles also employ WEP features. The US Marine Corps Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (cancelled in 2011) sported a 12-cylinder 1200 bhp diesel engine developed by the German MTU company. When the EFV is swimming the powerplant can be boosted to 2700 hp via the use of open circuit seawater-cooling. Such extreme war power setting allows the MTU engine to drive four massive water-jet exhausts which propel the surface- effect riding EFV vehicle at sea speeds reaching 35 knots. Although the EFV prototypes demonstrated revolutionary performance on water and land, the reliability of their extremely boosted powerplants never met stringent military standards and the vehicle failed to enter Marine Corps service.

The series was created by Jane Hewland and Janet Street-Porter, who was also editor of the first series. Overview Network 7 was broadcast live on Sundays from noon until two o'clock and was conceived of as a 'channel within a channel', something young people could roll out of bed and watch the morning after the night before. Its mission statement was \\"News is Entertainment. Entertainment is News.\\" It was known for its heavily self-branded, frenetic visual style with wild camera work, rapid cuts, very short items and \\"blipverts\\" ‚Äî a dense combination of innovative graphics, and pop video style visuals explaining everything from Third World debt to bulimia. Much of Network 7's innovative style can be seen as being inspired by a combination of elements such as the aesthetic of the Max Headroom drama 20 Minutes into the Future and the studio- based anarchy of Tiswas. The show's logo and distinctive brand and graphics (that predicted a desktop computer style) were designed by Malcolm Garrett and Kasper de Graaf's design studio Assorted iMaGes. The show took place in a specially built 'caravan city' in Limehouse Studios, a deserted banana warehouse on the site of what is now One Canada Square. Presenters included Jaswinder Bancil, Magenta Devine, Sankha Guha, Eric Harwood, Murray Boland, Tracey MacLeod, Sebastian Scott, and Trevor Ward. Most presenters had previously worked in either television or journalism in a smaller capacity, but they all got their first major TV exposure on the show. Charlie Parsons was a presenter and also part of the production staff. He later set up the production company Planet 24, which produced The Word and The Big Breakfast with his partner Waheed Alli. Network 7 challenged the idea that youth programming could only be a niche concern in the television business. The series won a British Academy Television Award for Originality for Hewland and Street-Porter in 1987. The series has been credited with changing the language of factual television. Regular programme segments Flesh + Blood was a mini-series running each week for 14 minutes within Network 7, written by Joanna Hogg and featuring Vladek Sheybal and Diana Quick in the main roles.

There has been massive growth of Dyce station from 239,000 passengers in 2002‚Äì03 to more than three times that number, 824,000, in 2014‚Äì15. In addition to Dyce and the many businesses in the area, the station also serves the airport and is popular with oil workers returning from the rigs. In addition to the 80 DyceJet Connect shuttle bus, a taxi rank provides a different means of transport to the airport terminal. A bus-only turning circle was constructed in 2015 to provide quick links between the station and airport. Signalling Dyce signal box Dyce signal box, which opened in 1880, was a tall structure located at the south (Aberdeen) end of the station, on the east side of the railway. In 1928, the box was provided with a new frame of 46 levers, subsequently reduced in size to 26 levers. Dyce lost its semaphore signals in October 2007 when new colour light signals were brought into use. The lever frame was removed from the signal box (renamed from \\"Dyce Junction\\" to \\"Dyce\\") and a new relay interlocking and 'NX' (entrance-exit) panel was installed, initially housed inside a temporary signal box. The signal box was demolished in August 2019 as part of upgrades to the Inverness to Aberdeen line that saw the track between Inverurie and Aberdeen be doubled. The box had been offered for sale but due to its close proximity to a working line, no use could be found for it and nobody wanted to remove the box to another location.

The name was used on most trucks in the Studebaker E-series, but not all. The Transtar name was first introduced for the 1956 (2E series) model year in 1/2-ton, 3/4-ton, 1-ton, 2-ton, and 2-ton heavy duty capacities. The three smaller models were available with factory-built pick-up bodies. The basic styling of these trucks dated back to the 1949 models, though they had received some styling and engineering changes in 1954 and 55. The Transtar name continued to be used on most of the 1957-58 3E series trucks, though a stripped-down Studebaker Scotsman model without the Transtar name was introduced in the 1958 model year. The 57-58 Transtars received an aggressive new fiberglass grille that attempted (largely successfully) to make Studebaker's outdated cab design look fresh and new. For unknown reasons, the Transtar name was dropped for the 1959 4E series Studebaker trucks and changed to Deluxe. For 1960, Studebaker introduced a new line of 1/2-ton and 3/4-ton trucks under the name Studebaker Champ. The Champs used front-end and cab sheetmetal from the 1959-60 Lark passenger cars, mated to their existing light-duty truck chassis and drive trains. The Champs were created in response to the Ford Ranchero (introduced in 1957) and Chevrolet El Camino (introduced in 1959), which used passenger car styling and features in a light-duty pickup truck. The Transtar name reappeared on Studebaker's medium- and heavy-duty trucks (1- and 2-ton) for 1960, and continued to be used on these trucks up through its 1964 models.

Like most sauropods, it would have had a small head on the end of a long neck and an equally long tail. Andesaurus was a very large animal, as were many others of its relatives, which included the largest animals ever to walk the Earth. History of discovery Andesaurus compared to some humans. In 1991, paleontologists Jorge Orlando Calvo and Jos√© Fernando Bonaparte named Andesaurus, which refers to the Andes and also includes the Greek word sauros (\\"lizard\\"), because of the proximity of this animal's remains to the Andes. Andesaurus fossils were found by Alejandro Delgado, after whom the single known species (A. delgadoi) is named. The only known material of Andesaurus is a partial skeleton consisting of a series of four vertebrae from the lower back, as well as 27 tail vertebrae, divided up into two series from separate parts of the tail. The vertebrae from the middle part of its tail had elongated centra. Elements of the pelvis were also discovered, including two ischia and a pubis bone, along with rib fragments and an incomplete humerus and femur. Description Total length estimates place Andesaurus at Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 205 to long.Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2012) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up- to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2011 Appendix. In 1995, Jan Peczkis created mass estimates of dinosaurs and placed them into order of magnitude categories (each category was then subdivided into thirds); using a mass estimation technique that extrapolates from the circumference of the femur, Andesaurus was listed in the category. Gregory S. Paul, however, lists Andesaurus as in weight. In 2020 Molina-Perez and Larramendi estimated a total length of and . The dorsal vertebrae of Andesaurus bear the typical features of an centrum and large lateral (pneumatic depression). Unlike related Phuwiangosaurus, there is no ventral keel under any of the vertebrae, and there is a pneumatic feature on the front of the , the latter being found in most neosauropods. Potentially diagnostic for Andesaurus, there is an additional ridge supporting the lower articulation for the ribs (), although poor preservation in other vertebrae means it can only be identified on one bone. The of Andesaurus are smaller than more basal sauropods, but less reduced than in Argentinosaurus or Epachthosaurus, where the surface is only articular ridges, and also less reduced than more derived titanosaurs where the articulation is entirely absent. Pre- and post-spinal are present in the vertebrae of Andesaurus, like in other somphospondylans. Tail vertebrae (caudals) of Andesaurus are slightly , where the anterior face is concave and the posterior face of convex. This convexity is less prominent than more derived titanosaurs, but is still diagnostic of the clade as a whole. The first caudal has a flat anterior and slightly convex posterior face, different from the subsequent vertebrae similar to in Epachthosaurus. A prominent depression is present on the bottom surface of some anterior caudals, a feature present in diplodocids and multiple titanosaurs. Anterior caudals are shorter proportionally, the bones becoming almost double the proportional length towards the end of the tail. Lateral pleurocoels are present on some vertebrae, as well as small lateral foramina. These foramina are known in some titanosaurs and non-titanosaurs, but their phylogenetic distribution is poorly understood. Like in all titanosauriformes, the neural arch is on the anterior portion of the centrum, and the neural spines are elongate and rectangular. The variation along the caudal series is similar to Epachthosaurus and Malawisaurus. Classification Several plesiomorphic (primitive) features characterize Andesaurus as the most basal known member of Titanosauria. In fact, this clade has been defined to contain Andesaurus, Saltasaurus, their most recent common ancestor, and all of its descendants. The most prominent plesiomorphy is the articulations between its tail vertebrae. In most derived titanosaurs, the tail vertebrae articulate with ball-and-socket joints, with the hollowed-out socket end on the front (procoelous caudal vertebrae), while in Andesaurus, both ends of the vertebrae are flat (amphiplatyan caudals), as seen in many non-titanosaurian sauropods. Andesaurus itself is only characterized by a single feature, the tall neural spines on top of its back vertebrae, and needs further study. Some other basal titanosaurs from Argentina, including Argentinosaurus and Puertasaurus, were also sauropods of enormous size. The most derived group of titanosaurs, the Saltasauridae, included some of the smallest known sauropods, including Saltasaurus itself. Thus it is possible that the largest sizes were attained among the more basal members of the clade.  Palaeoecology  These fossils were discovered in the Candeleros Formation, the oldest formation within the Neuqu√©n Group of Neuqu√©n Province, Argentina. This formation dates to the Cenomanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period, about 99.6 to 97 million years ago. For the most part, the Candeleros represents an ancient braided river system, and besides Andesaurus, also contains fossils of theropods like Buitreraptor and the enormous Giganotosaurus, as well as other sauropods such as the rebbachisaurid Limaysaurus.

The structure is located in a remote area in the Abel Iturralde Province of La Paz Department and was visited by researchers in 2002. Based on the presence of millions of glass beads, it has been hypothesised that the structure was created in the Late Pleistocene (between 30,000 and 11,000 years ago) by the air burst of a non-impacting meteorite, similar to the Tunguska event in 1908.  Description  The structure was identified on the basis of Landsat imagery in 1985. It is located between the Manupari and Madidi Rivers. Being so circular, it is argued that it may be a meteorite crater. Because it is in an area of active sediment accumulation by rivers, it must be a geologically young feature, with estimates of its age ranging between 11,000 and 30,000 years. Unlike other young craters, it is very flat, so if it is of impact origin, perhaps the crater sunk into the soft sediments leaving only a circular 'ghost' marking the original rim. The site is very remote, but has been visited twice by scientific investigators, most recently by a team from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in September 2002. In both cases, the expeditions failed to find conclusive evidence for the origin of the feature. Later research of the samples collected in 2002 revealed tiny clusters composed of many glass beads in peak abundances of up to 90 clusters per kilogram at depths of . Some glassy fragments contain hundreds to thousands of bead clusters of almost sub-micron sizes, and the total number of such spheres is estimated as millions per kg. About 90% of the beads are rich in oxides of Al-Si-Ca-Fe, with up to 4.4% TiO2. The rest are mostly iron-rich beads with small amounts of Al and Ca. The presence of the glassy material supports the hypothesis that the Iturralde crater may have formed during an explosion (air burst) as a result of atmospheric impact by a low density extraterrestrial body.Malkova et al., 2013, p.1 For an air burst to have occurred, the extraterrestrial body must have been small enough and/or possessed low enough density (e.g. porous ice or stone) that made it unable to penetrate the atmosphere and reach the Earth's surface to form a classical impact crater. If so, the impactor would have encountered the atmosphere at velocities of approximately , and the released energy of the airburst would have been comparable to or greater than any known nuclear explosion. Extreme heat created by such atmospheric disruption would have formed convection cells that lifted the surface unconsolidated material into the fireball, where it melted and subsequently settled to Earth in the form of glass beads. The hypervelocity plume of such an airburst could have reached the ground and created the bowl-like feature visible today.

The album was a commercial failure and failed to chart. \\"Hell on Wheels\\" was released as the lead single which had a moderate success, peaking at number fifty-nine on the Billboard Hot 100. Album information Prisoner (initially planned to be released under the title Mirror Image) was Cher's second album of 1979, and was released nine months after Take Me Home. This was the last album of Cher's to date to be produced by Bob Esty, with Esty and Michelle Aller contributing several of the songs. Compared to the disco style of Take Me Home, Prisoner featured a relatively new wave sound. Prisoner also marked the first time that Cher released an album which featured songs that were written exclusively for her. The producer wanted to take advantage of Cher's image and the media obsession with her. On the front cover of the album, she appears to be completely naked, with long hair draped to cover her breasts. She is wrapped in chains and wearing a wide metal collar. Her wrists and ankles are tightly shackled with wide metal bands. The cover spurred controversy among some women's rights groups for her perceived \\"sex slave\\" image. Originally the album was planned to be titled Mirror Image, pointing out Cher's known brave side and her newly found 'wild disco' side. Since Cher wasn't really into the album (she wanted to \\"rock out\\") she kept on refusing songs on one hand and adding songs on the other hand. \\"Boys & Girls\\", a more rock-based song was added by Cher. Since there was nothing left from the album's original plan, the title was changed into Prisoner before release. Prisoner has been released on CD together with the first Casablanca Records album Take Me Home, in a CD entitled, The Casablanca Years. This CD unites all the tracks from both albums, merging them onto one single CD. Promotion Cher recorded an exclusive TV special called Cher...and Other Fantasies, featuring sketches, the unreleased tracks \\"Like a Number\\", a new version of \\"More than You Know\\" and the song \\"Ain't Nobody's Business\\" which was performed in the Take Me Home Tour. Singles \\"Hell on Wheels\\", the lead single from the album reached only number fifty-nine on the Billboard Hot 100. To promote the single a video was filmed. In it, Cher was featured wearing roller skates being followed by some truckers. The song was also included in the original soundtrack to the film, Roller Boogie. \\"Holdin' Out For Love\\" was released in Japan as a promotional single, and in the UK as a commercial 7\\", which failed to chart.

Publication history He first appeared in Justice League of America #3 (February 1961) in a story entitled \\"The Slave Ship of Space\\" and was created by Gardner Fox and Mike Sekowsky. Fictional character biography Kanjar Ro is the dictator of the planet Dhor in the Antares star system. Dhor is constantly at war with three other Antarean worlds: Alstair ruled by the plant-like Queen Hyathis, Mosteel ruled by the metal-skinned Kromm, and Llarr ruled by the lizard-like Emperor Sayyar. In his first appearance, he enslaves the Justice League with his Gamma Gong, and uses them to battle the other three monarchs by threatening to leave all humanity in a paralyzed state, to only be released if all three monarchs spoke Kanjar Ro's name at the same time. The League is able to defeat all three monarchs, and also defeat him, despite him taking away the monarchs' voices with his energi-rod (the League had recorded their voices so humanity was freed). The JLA imprisons all four monarchs on a small planet around which Green Lantern creates a power ring barrier. Ro escapes after the four villains make a crack in the barrier with their thought waves, but leaves the other three behind. Ro makes several attempts to conquer Rann, prompting the League to team-up with Adam Strange. He first uses radiation from Rann's Triple-Star to become three times as powerful as Superman and nearly defeats the JLA, but Adam defeats him with his own Dhorite Energi-rod (like Superman is weakened by Kryptonite, Kanjar is vulnerable to Dhorite) and imprisons Ro in a prison with bars of Dhorite. For some reason the yellow radiation he released means Adam cannot stay on Rann for more than a year. While the people of the planet Rann are distracted, Kanjar Ro creates a duplicate of himself from his own aura and leaves it in his place. He then uses the auras of the Flash, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, the Atom, and Aquaman to create doubles to draw the other members of the Justice League into various traps which Kanjar Ro has devised. The real members of the JLA are able to spot the duplicates as they do not have the same weaknesses or personalities as the real JLA members. Kanjor Ro's duplicate, upset at being left behind, reveals the real Ro's plan to the JLA, who return the camouflaged Earth back to its proper location and re-imprison the real Ro. Following the Crisis on Infinite Earths Kanjar Ro is reintroduced in Hawkworld as a plotting bureaucrat in the Thanagarian Ministry of Alien Affairs. This was originally intended to take place prior to JLA #3, but it is later revealed to occur in the present. Ro's pre-Crisis background still exists, however, as his Gamma Gong is kept in the Justice League Watchtower's trophy room. Kanjar Ro has subsequently appeared in both Superman and JLA vol. 3, attempting to conquer planets through force or guile. Kanjar Ro's sister, Kanjar Ru, appears in Valor as the warden of the Starlag II prison. Kanjar Ro is mentioned in Justice League of America #4 in passing by Black Lightning. He later appears in Justice League of America #19 on the planet Cygnus 4019, the intended prison planet for Earth's supervillains. After attempting to capture the League (who had come to check on the prisoners) he reveals that he planned to take control of the villains upon their arrival, only for their teleport beams to be redirected elsewhere. Kanjar Ro appears in Trinity, having disguised himself as Despero, in order to take his place in a ritual that takes the positions of \\"keystones of the universe\\" from Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Although the ritual is successful, granting Morgaine le Fey and Enigma great power, Kanjar gains nothing, due to his deception.Trinity #21 Revealed as a fake, Kanjar flees Morgaine and Enigma, but is confronted by a vengeful Despero.Trinity #23 He barters the location of the imprisoned Crime Syndicate of Amerika in exchange for leniency; after this, he is ignored when he demands vengeance against Morgaine, and is taken to Krona's polar base, from where he radios for the heroes to save himself from the destruction Krona prepares for Earth. In the end, as the Green Lanterns take custody of Despero's massive alien armada, he reveals he has copied Krona's files and notes and is ready to sell them to the highest bidder. He is last seen ready to sneak away from the fleet en route to the prison planet Takron-Galtos. Kanjar Ro is later seen in the Oan prison cells, and is present during a mass breakout. Unwilling to be killed by the rioting prisoners, Kanjar bargains with Kyle Rayner, offering to help quell the riot in exchange for leniency on his sentence.Green Lantern Corps(Vol. 2) #38 This pact later saves Kanjar's life--The Guardians had ordered the Alpha Lanterns to kill all the escaped prisoners, and Kyle is able to convince the Guardians to spare Kanjar by citing his assistance during the riot.Green Lantern Corps (Vol. 2) #39 After presumably being released from Oa, Kanjar Ro returns to Dhor and resumes his rule of the planet just as Starro the Conqueror begins his latest conquest. Vril Dox erects a forcefield barrier, stopping the spread of Starro's invasion, but also trapping a number of planets with the Star Conqueror, Dhor and Kanjar Ro included. Kanjar Ro is seen telling Dox he \\"will consider\\" Dox's request for his assistance in stopping Starro. After ending their communication, several members of Vril Dox's R.E.B.E.L.S. team speculate that Kanjar Ro is more likely to cut a deal with Starro to save himself rather than throw in with Dox. However, Kanjar Ro seeks the R.E.B.E.L.S.' help when Starro's horde begin their invasion of Dhor, and is denied by the Dominator Xylon. When Kanjar tries to use his gamma gong against the horde, Starro's general Smite shatters it to pieces. As Smite is about to kill Kanjar, Adam Strange, who had just heeded Dox's call for help, zeta-beams himself and Kanjar away to the R.E.B.E.L.S.' temporary base. It is revealed that Dox had originally sent Strange to retrieve the gamma gong, not its inventor, who Dox described as a \\"dithering idiot.\\" Nevertheless, Kanjar Ro is currently a member of the R.E.B.E.L.S. team. Powers and abilities Kanjar Ro is a cunning strategist and relies on advanced alien weaponry. He carries an Energi-Rod that allows him to levitate and communicate through hyper-space. Other versions * Kanjar Ro has appeared in the Justice League Unlimited spin-off comic book. His appearance is in issue #4. * In Green Lantern comics, an alien race called \\"the Laroo\\" have a distinct likeness to Kanjar Ro except they are blue. * The 1980s series Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew presented the parallel Earth of \\"Earth-C-Minus,\\" a world populated by funny animal superheroes that paralleled the mainstream DC Universe. Kanjar Ro had an Earth-C-Minus counterpart named \\"Kangar-Roo,\\" an alien kangaroo who battled his universe's heroic Just'a Lotta Animals, paralleling the story seen in Justice League of America (volume 1) #3. * In the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen volume 3 backup feature, Minions of the Moon, the Galley-Wag escaped from slavery aboard a space ship propelled by oar-like devices, similar to Kanjar Ro's in his first appearance. His captors are said to come from Antares, and are described as pink-skinned with compound eyes and wearing short shorts. One is named Kelger Vo. JLA/Avengers Kanjar Ro is among the enthralled villains defending Krona's stronghold in #4. He is shown fighting Yellowjacket. In other media Television * Kanjar Ro appears in Justice League, voiced by Ren√© Auberjonois. In the episode \\"In Blackest Night\\", Kanjar Ro testifies at John Stewart's trial on Ajuris 5, describing the destruction of Ajuris 4, and the death of 3 billion people by Stewart. With Kanjar Ro's testimony, the court decides to sentence Stewart to termination for destroying the planet. The Justice League learn of this and investigate, with Flash buying time by acting as Stewart's lawyer, thus risking sharing the termination sentence due to planetary law stating that lawyers share the same fate as their clients. The League discover that Ajuris 4 is still intact, but disguised as part of a plot by the Manhunter robots to distract the Guardians, and destroy Oa. Kanjar Ro admits to being paid off after the League reveals Ajuris 4 is intact. Afterwards, Kanjar Ro was held under intergalactic custody. Kanjar Ro's ship (shown in a flashback sequence and later again in his attempt to kill Superman and Martian Manhunter on Ajuris 4's moon) bears a striking resemblance to the Legion of Super Heroes' cruiser. Kanjar Ro as seen in Batman: The Brave and the Bold. * Kanjar Ro appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Marc Worden. He was enemy with Blue Beetle years ago who managed to defeat the alien using a sonic- emitting Gamma Gong that the Scarab is vulnerable to. In the episode \\"The Rise of the Blue Beetle!\\", he returns to the same planet to capture more of the Gribble aliens because their bodies can apparently be used as fuel. After defeating Batman and Jamie Reyes, he managed to use the Gamma Gong to get the Scarab off of Jaime and wear it in his next fight against Batman. Just before Kanjar Ro can use the Scarab to kill Batman, Jaime uses the Gamma Gong to remove the Scarab from the space pirate. In the opening of \\"The Super-Batman of Planet X\\", Kanjar Ro appears along with his bounty of Space Pirates. They were stopped by Batman, Will Magnus and the Metal Men. Kanjar Ro appears again at the beginning of \\"Night of the Batmen\\" where he is attempting to destroy a planet for profit. He and his robot army is stopped by Batman, Green Arrow, Aquaman, Captain Marvel and Martian Manhunter but Batman is injured while attempting to disarm the bomb. He reappeared again in \\"Four Star Spectacular!\\" in the World's War vignette where he is trying to take over Rann by attempting to teleport a negaton bomb, but was foiled by Adam Strange and a puppy after he made several failed attempts to teleport the bomb to the right planet, then was teleported with the bomb he promptly shut down and is last seen eaten to death by a creature. * Kanjar Ro is mentioned in Legends of Tomorrow. In the episode \\"Marooned\\", he is mentioned by Rip Hunter when telling the Time Pirates that Ray Palmer has outrun Kanjar Ro, although this is actually a command code established by Hunter to allow the Waverider to take particular action without Hunter's presence. * Kanjar Ro appears in Justice League Action, voiced by Khary Payton. In the episode \\"All Aboard the Space Train\\", he and his crew hijack a space train containing Justice League items where they ran afoul of Batman and Cyborg. As Kanjar Ro gave Batman and Cyborg a hard time with his cloaking technology, they enlisted Space Cabbie for help. After thawing out a frozen Jonah Hex, Space Cabbie leads him into fighting Kanjar Ro and his crew in order to retake control of the space train. The two of them managed to defeat Kanjar Ro and land the train on a nearby planet. Film * Kanjar Ro appears in Green Lantern: First Flight, voiced by Kurtwood Smith. This version has more squid-like facial features and is more insectoid in nature, having functional wings and being capable of flight. In the movie, he works alongside the corrupt Green Lantern Sinestro to acquire the \\"yellow element\\", a crystal that's the polar opposite of the green element which powers the Lantern Corps' battery. Sinestro plans to have Kanjar Ro use the Weaponers of Qward to create a ring for Sinestro who kills Kanjar Ro and frames Hal Jordan. Sinestro later briefly revives Kanjar Ro in the morgue reconnecting dead synapses with his energy rod to learn where Qward is. The rod and Kanjar Ro's corpse is later incinerated in a battle between Kilowog and Jordan against Sinestro's accomplice Boodikka. References 7\\\\.

John Davies, Nigel Jenkins, Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008) pg751 It is a Grade II* listed building. History The Parc and Dare Workingman's Club in 1894 The Parc and Dare Hall was built in 1892, and began its life as a working men's library and institute. The workers of the Park and the Dare Collieries funded the building by a donating a penny from each pound of their wages.Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council Cultural Services department It was a place where the miners could meet and socialise and featured a bar and a library. In the early twentieth century work began on the Parc and Dare Hall, adding a large theatre, initially to be used as a variety show venue. In 1913 the theatre was completed, the external style of the building being influenced by the contemporary architecture of Welsh Nonconformist chapels. Due to the declining popularity of theatre and the emergence of cinema, by 1920 a cinema screen was installed. In 1930, the first 'talkie' picture to be screened was The Broadway Melody, and people flocked from miles around to hear this innovation. In 1975, the theatre was in such a state of disrepair that its closure was inevitable. The Parc & Dare Workmen's Institute Committee, faced with this daunting possibility, donated the building to the then Rhondda Borough Council. Today the Parc and Dare is still used as a functioning theatre and cinema. Most theatre productions tend to be locally produced, though the venue is used by touring musicians and comedians, and over the years it has hosted the likes of Max Boyce, Ken Dodd and the Kinks' Ray Davies. In 2007 the Parc and Dare was used in filming the theatre stage scenes in \\"Daleks in Manhattan\\" and \\"Evolution of the Daleks\\", the fourth and fifth episodes of series 3 of the BBC's revived Doctor Who series. Over the years there has been numerous amateur dramatics such as The Rhondda Theatre group. Architecture and design The former Parc and Dare Institute is now connected at various levels to the Hall and provides the rehearsal rooms, offices and public areas. The fa√ßade conceals an unexpectedly ambitious auditorium that, as with most of its kind in Wales, is at first floor level. It is a fine hall with two curved galleries, the slips of each extending to and meeting the proscenium wall. Each gallery front retains its original decorative plasterwork. The proscenium arch is attractively decorated over its entire length with plasterwork representing fruit and flowers. The Parc and Dare is still an Edwardian proscenium-arched theatre that acts as a venue for live performance, cinema and community events. The Parc and Dare is a Grade II* listed building and stands as the tallest building in Treorchy. The Parc and Dare Workingmen's Hall once had a clock above its entrance. The clock, on Station Road, was added around the same time as the theatre hall, but was removed in the 1970s during renovations and was never replaced. The parc and dare theatre has graced the biggest stars in show business.

He currently presents the south's regional segment of the BBC's Sunday Politics programme. Career Beginning his media career at BBC Radio Leicester while still at university, Peter went on to Pennine Radio, where he was a reporter and newsreader for the Bradford station. He moved to Radio 210 in Reading, where he won a Sony award for coverage of the Clapham rail crash. Switching from radio to television, Peter became a reporter for southern ITV franchisee Television South, filing special reports from Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, and covering the weeks in which Michael Heseltine fought to replace Margaret Thatcher. When TVS lost its ITV franchise, Peter transferred to the new contractor, Meridian Broadcasting as a reporter and played a part in launching Meridian's Thames Valley news service. It was while here that he became one of Meridian's political correspondents, fronting Meridian's political coverage of the 1997 general election, a role he later repeated in the 2001 election. In the autumn of 2001, Peter transferred to the BBC to become BBC South's health correspondent. He soon after took his current role as political editor. His role includes presenting the regional section of Sunday Politics, broadcast weekly, and reporting on political stories on the regional television news programme South Today and on the region's local radio stations Radio Berkshire, Radio Oxford and Radio Solent. He also occasionally appears on the BBC News Channel reporting on political issues in the south, and has reported from the Portsmouth and Romsey counts at the 2005 and 2010 general elections for the national BBC election programmes. Part of Peter's popularity is sourced from the way in which he connects with the viewer. His belief that people should care about what happens in Westminster and how is affects local people, often results in their opinions being heard and voiced. His programme is often broadcast from a public location and audiences are occasionally used. Peter's use of technology has always extended this bond with the viewer. Text messages and responses left on social media sites are often posed to the panel on his programme, and he keeps the public informed through his BBC News correspondents blog, and his Henley's Hustings blog before it. Facebook and Twitter are also used, with his following '@BBCPeter H'.

It is situated in East Birmingham, West Midlands. Initially designated as Project Kingfisher by Birmingham City Council, the park was formally declared a country park in July 2004. The country park is located along an 11 km stretch of the River Cole from Small Heath (Birmingham) to Chelmsley Wood (Solihull) at the M6 motorway. It is a Local Nature Reserve. Project Kingfisher The overall aim of the project was to preserve and care for the River Cole valley. The project was inaugurated in 1985. Funding Both the Birmingham City Council and the Solihull MBC sponsored the project in a joint venture. Charities and organisations that funded the project were: * English Nature * The Environment Agency * Warwickshire Wildlife Trust * Wildlife Trust for Birmingham and the Black Country Geography The country park has an area of around and crosses the border between Birmingham and the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull. Within the original project, and now surrounding the country park, are several local nature reserves. These include Yorks Wood which was declared a local nature reserve by Solihull MBC in the 1990s after purchasing it in the 1980s. Other nature reserves include Babbs Mill Lake and Alcott Wood. Cole Bank, Smiths Wood, Elmdon Nature Park and Elmdon Coppice are proposed local nature reserves. Flowing through the country park is the River Cole which forms the River Cole Valley. The valley is home to different wildlife habitats and different types of landscape. The area contains a number of artificial lakes surrounded by plants ranging from grassland, wetland and woodland which dates back hundreds of years. Babbs Mill Lake in Kingshurst was dug to be a balancing feature in times of flooding at the river. Shard End Lake was created as a result of an old quarry being filled with water. The area is open to cyclists and walkers who can walk along the river towards other nearby country parks such as Shire Country Park and also walk to other places such as the Grand Union Canal, Coleshill, Kingshurst Brook, Meriden Park and Sheldon Country Park. Nature Animals seen along the river include herons, kingfishers (note the project name), water voles and mink. In the ponds created in Shard End, many invertebrates have nested as well as many amphibians. Skylarks have been seen around the course grassland and they have bred successfully for a number of years.

The only species is Antetonitrus ingenipes. As one of the oldest known sauropods, it is crucial for the understanding of the origin and early evolution of this group. It was a quadrupedal herbivore, like all of its later relatives, but shows primitive adaptations to use the forelimbs for grasping, instead of purely for weight support. Discovery and naming The Elliot Formation, where remains of Antetonitrus were discovered Adam Yates, an Australian expert on early sauropodomorphs, named Antetonitrus in a 2003 report co-authored by South African James Kitching. The name is derived from the Latin ante- (\\"before\\") and tonitrus (\\"thunder\\"), which refers to its existence, before other known sauropods, specifically Brontosaurus (\\"thunder lizard\\"). The one known species of Antetonitrus is called A. ingenipes, from the Latin ingens (\\"massive\\") and pes (\\"foot\\"), because it shows the beginning of the development of feet designed solely to support weight. The fossils now known as Antetonitrus were discovered by Kitching in 1981 in the Free State of South Africa, and were stored in the Bernard Price Institute where they were labeled as Euskelosaurus. Yates recognized them as a separate taxon and published a description several years later. The holotype, or original specimen, consists of several vertebrae and numerous bones from both forelimb and hind limb, all presumed to be from one individual. Five more limb bones from another smaller individual were also referred to the genus. Description Size of Antetonitrus compared to a human The holotype specimen may have measured 8 to 10 m in total body length and was 1.5 to 2 m high at the hips. However, the neural arches of the vertebrae were not fused with the centra, indicating that this individual perhaps was not fully grown. Antetonitrus shows several features which appear to be similar to those of later sauropods, but still retains some primitive features. Unlike most of its smaller and more lightly built ancestors, Antetonitrus was primarily quadrupedal. Like sauropods, its forelimbs were much longer relative to its hind legs than earlier animals, while the metatarsus was shortened. However, the first digit of the hand, also called the \\"thumb\\" or pollex, was still twisted and flexible, capable of grasping against the hand. In more derived sauropods, the wrist bones are large and thick, arranged in such a way as to lock the hand into a permanently pronated position for full-time weight support, and the hand is incapable of grasping. Antetonitrus already shows adaptations for an increasing body size as seen in all later sauropods: The wrist bones were broader and thicker to support more weight, whereas the femur was elliptical in cross section. The vertebrae bear high neural spines and well developed hyposphene-hypantrum articulations which add rigidity to the trunk. The first toe of the hind foot already bears a large claw longer than the first metatarsal; however, this claw was not sickle shaped as seen in later sauropods. The femur was slightly sigmoidal (S-curved) in lateral view rather than straight as in other sauropods. Classification Skeletal reconstruction of Lessemsaurus, a closely related genus of basal sauropod Restoration of Antetonitrus A cladistic analysis by Yates and Kitching recognizes Antetonitrus as a basal sauropod, occupying a position between more derived animals such as Isanosaurus or Vulcanodon, and more basal sauropods like Melanorosaurus. The back vertebrae are extremely similar to Lessemsaurus from South America, while the limb bones are similar to Blikanasaurus, another stocky early sauropod from South Africa. However, these animals were not included in a cladistic analysis with Antetonitrus because they are poorly known. Apaldetti et al. (2018) erected Lessemsauridae, a clade containing Antetonitrus, Lessemsaurus and Ingentia. Their cladogram is reproduced below: While Antetonitrus is not the earliest sauropod from a phylogenetic standpoint, it currently one of the oldest known sauropod chronologically, or rather tied for that distinction with other early sauropods from the same formation, like Melanorosaurus and Blikanasaurus. Fossils of these animals were recovered from the Elliot Formation. Initially it was thought to have been recovered from the Lower Elliot Formation which dates to the Norian stage of the Late Triassic, or approximately 221 to 210 million years ago. Later studies indicate that it was actually recovered from the Early Jurassic Upper Elliot Formation. Before Antetonitrus and the other animals recovered from the Elliot Formation were recognized as sauropods, the oldest known sauropod had been Isanosaurus from the Rhaetian stage of Thailand. Early sauropods and their prosauropod relatives were found around the world as all of the continents were at the time united into the single supercontinent, Pangaea, which made dispersal across the entire terrestrial world possible.

The Baths are adjacent to All Saints DLR station. A campaign to restore the baths won the support of Tower Hamlets Council in 2010 and the construction company Guildmore was appointed to complete the works to create a new leisure centre incorporating a swimming pool, gymnasium and affordable housing on adjacent land. The site reopened in July 2016. History The original Poplar Baths opened in 1852, costing ¬£10,000. It was built to provide public wash facilities for the East End's poor as a result of the Baths and Washhouses Act 1846. The baths incorporated slipper and vapour baths. The slipper baths section contained 12 baths in the men's first-class division, 24 in the men's second-class and six in both women's divisions. Steam and shower baths were located behind the slipper baths. A comprehensive public laundry was located at the rear of the building, on Arthur Street. It contained 48 wooden washing tubs, drying equipment and ironing rooms. An uncovered water tank supplied the baths and was erected above the boiler house with a capacity of 24,000 gallons. The Baths were rebuilt in 1933 to a design by Harley Heckford and the larger pool was covered over to convert the building into a theatre. Designated the East India Hall, it had seating capacity for 1,400 people and incorporated a dance hall, cinema, exhibition room and sports hall for boxing and wrestling programmes. This dual purpose sustained interest over the winter months, with the smaller pool remaining in use. Between 1938 and 1941 an office in the Baths was used by the Borough's electricity office and then later used by the Transport and General Workers' Union and the Poplar Labour Party. The main bath hall sustained bomb damage during the Second World War and was forced to close with the hall left unglazed for several years. Poplar Baths, East London reopened in 2016 Poplar Baths reopened in 1947 and continued to be used as a swimming facility, attracting on average 225,700 bathers every year between 1954 and 1959, before the facility's eventual closure and conversion to an industrial training centre in 1988. Restoration The Baths eventually became derelict and a bid to reopen the baths was put together by The Environment Trust, Swan Housing Group and the 'Poplar Baths Steering Group' receiving strong local support. It has been a listed building (Grade II) since 2001 and was listed on the English Heritage Register of 'Heritage at Risk'. A statue of the local shipowner and philanthropist, Richard Green stands outside the Baths on the A13 East India Dock Road. In 2010, the East London Advertiser confirmed that campaigners had won the battle to get it back into use. Redevelopment of the Baths began in January 2014 and works were expected to complete by the end of 2015. The construction of the leisure centre and 100 new homes cost an estimated ¬£36 million. The Baths re-opened on 25 July 2016 and were removed from the Buildings at Risk register.

Yamamoto, commander of the Combined Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy, was killed on Bougainville Island when his transport bomber aircraft was shot down by United States Army Air Forces fighter aircraft operating from Kukum Field on Guadalcanal. The mission of the U.S. aircraft was specifically to kill Yamamoto and was based on United States Navy intelligence on Yamamoto's itinerary in the Solomon Islands area. The death of Yamamoto reportedly damaged the morale of Japanese naval personnel, raised the morale of the Allied forces, and was intended as revenge by U.S. leaders, who blamed Yamamoto for the attack on Pearl Harbor that initiated the war between Imperial Japan and the United States. The U.S. pilots claimed to have shot down three twin-engined bombers and two fighters during the mission, but Japanese sources show only two bombers were shot down. There is a controversy over which pilot shot down Yamamoto's plane, but most modern historians credit Colonel Rex T. Barber.  Background  Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, commander of the Imperial Japanese Navy, scheduled an inspection tour of the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. He planned to inspect Japanese air units participating in Operation I-Go that had begun April 7, 1943; in addition, the tour would boost Japanese morale following the disastrous Guadalcanal Campaign and its subsequent evacuation during January and February. On April 14, the U.S. naval intelligence effort code-named \\"Magic\\" intercepted and decrypted orders alerting affected Japanese units of the tour. The original message, NTF131755, addressed to the commanders of Base Unit No. 1, the 11th Air Flotilla, and the 26th Air Flotilla, was encoded in the Japanese Naval Cipher JN-25D, and was picked up by three stations of the \\"Magic\\" apparatus, including Fleet Radio Unit Pacific Fleet. The message was then deciphered by Navy cryptographers (among them future Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens); it contained time and location details of Yamamoto's itinerary, as well as the number and types of planes that would transport and accompany him on the journey. The decrypted text revealed that on April 18 Yamamoto would be flying from Rabaul to Balalae Airfield, on an island near Bougainville in the Solomon Islands. He and his staff would be flying in two medium bombers (Mitsubishi G4M Bettys of the K≈çk≈´tai 705), escorted by six navy fighters (Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters of the K≈çk≈´tai 204), to depart Rabaul at 06:00 and arrive at Balalae at 08:00, Tokyo time. President Franklin D. Roosevelt may have authorized Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox to \\"get Yamamoto\\", but no official record of such an order exists and sources disagree whether he did so. Knox essentially let Admiral Chester W. Nimitz make the decision. Nimitz first consulted Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr., Commander, South Pacific, and then authorized the mission on April 17. These U.S. commanders judged that the benefits of a successful mission included that Japanese morale would be negatively impacted by news of Yamamoto's death and that Yamamoto's replacement would be less capable. When the issue was raised that the mission could reveal that the United States had broken Japanese naval codes, the commanders decided the knowledge could be protected as long as the true source of the intelligence was kept hidden from unauthorized American personnel and the press.  Interception  P-38G Lightnings were the aircraft chosen to carry out the mission. To avoid detection by radar and Japanese personnel stationed in the Solomon Islands along a straight-line distance of about between U.S. forces and Bougainville, the mission entailed an over-water flight south and west of the Solomons. This roundabout approach was plotted and measured to be about . The fighters would, therefore, travel 600 miles out to the target and 400 miles back. The 1,000-mile flight, with extra fuel allotted for combat, was beyond the range of the F4F Wildcat and F4U Corsair fighters then available to Navy and Marine squadrons based on Guadalcanal. The mission was instead assigned to the 339th Fighter Squadron, 347th Fighter Group, whose P-38G Lightning aircraft, equipped with drop tanks, had the range to intercept and engage. 339th Squadron Commander Major John W. Mitchell, already an ace pilot, was chosen to lead the flight. For better navigation, Mitchell asked for a navy compass, which was provided by Marine Corps Lt. Col. Luther S. Moore, and installed in Mitchell's P-38 the day before the attack. All of the P-38 fighters mounted their standard armament of one 20 mm cannon and four .50-caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns, and were equipped to carry two drop tanks under their wings. A limited supply of tanks was flown up from New Guinea, sufficient to provide each Lightning with one large tank to replace one of the small tanks. Despite the difference in size, the tanks were located close enough to the aircraft's center of gravity to avoid any performance problems. Eighteen P-38s were assigned the mission. One flight of four was designated as the \\"killer\\" flight, while the remainder, which included two spares, would climb to to act as \\"top cover\\" for the expected reaction by Japanese fighters based at Kahili. A flight plan was prepared by the Command Operations Officer, Marine Major John Condon, but this was discarded by Mitchell, who thought the airspeeds and time estimates were not best for intercepting Yamamoto. With several of his pilots assisting, Mitchell calculated an intercept time of 09:35, based on the itinerary, to catch the bombers descending over Bougainville, 10 minutes before landing at Balalae. He worked back from that time and drew four precisely calculated legs, with a fifth leg curving in a search pattern in case Yamamoto was not seen at the chosen point. In addition to heading out over the Coral Sea, the 339th would \\"wave-hop\\" all the way to Bougainville at altitudes no greater than 50 feet (15 m), maintaining radio silence. Although the 339th Fighter Squadron officially carried out the mission, 10 of the 18 pilots were drawn from the other two squadrons of the 347th Group. The Commander AirSols, Rear Admiral Marc A. Mitscher, selected four pilots to be designated as the \\"killer\\" flight: * Capt. Thomas G. Lanphier, Jr. * Lt. Rex T. Barber * Lt. Jim McLanahan (dropped out with flat tire) * Lt. Joe Moore (dropped out with faulty fuel feed) The remaining pilots would act as reserves and provide air cover against any retaliatory attacks by local Japanese fighters: * Maj. John Mitchell * Lt. William Smith * Lt. Gordon Whittiker * Lt. Roger Ames * Capt. Louis Kittel * Lt. Lawrence Graebner * Lt. Doug Canning * Lt. Delton Goerke * Lt. Julius Jacobson * Lt. Eldon Stratton * Lt. Albert Long * Lt. Everett Anglin * Lt. Besby F. Holmes (replaced McLanahan) * Lt. Raymond K. Hine (replaced Moore) A briefing included the designated cover story for the source of the intelligence stating it had come from Australian coastwatchers, who supposedly had spotted an important high-ranking officer boarding an aircraft at Rabaul. Several historians say that the pilots were not specifically briefed on the identity of their target, but Thomas Alexander Hughes wrote that Mitscher told the assembled pilots it was Yamamoto, to \\"provide additional incentive\\" to the fliers. The specially fitted P-38s took off from Kukum Field on Guadalcanal beginning at 07:25 on April 18. Two of the Lightnings assigned to the killer flight dropped out of the mission at the start, one with a tire flattened during takeoff (McLanahan) and the second when its drop tanks would not feed fuel to the engines (Moore). In Rabaul, despite urgings by local Japanese commanders to cancel the trip for fear of ambush, Yamamoto's airplanes took off as scheduled for the trip of . They climbed to , with their fighter escort at their 4 o'clock position and higher, split into two V-formations of three planes. Mitchell's flight of four led the squadron at low altitude, with the killer flight, now consisting of Lanphier, Barber, and spares 1st Lt. Besby F. Holmes and 1st Lt. Raymond K. Hine, immediately behind. Mitchell, fighting off drowsiness, navigated by flight plan and the navy compass. This has been called the longest-distance fighter- intercept mission of the war. Mitchell and his force arrived at the intercept point one minute early, at 09:34, just as Yamamoto's aircraft descended into view in a light haze. The P-38s jettisoned the auxiliary tanks, turned to the right to parallel the bombers, and began a full power climb to intercept them. The tanks on Holmes's P-38 did not detach and his element turned back toward the sea. Mitchell radioed Lanphier and Barber to engage, and they climbed toward the eight aircraft. The nearest escort fighters dropped their own tanks and dived toward the pair of P-38s. Lanphier, in a sound tactical move, immediately turned head-on and climbed towards the escorts while Barber chased the diving bomber transports. Barber banked steeply to turn in behind the bombers and momentarily lost sight of them, but when he regained contact, he was immediately behind one and began firing into its right engine, rear fuselage, and empennage. When Barber hit its left engine, the bomber began to trail heavy black smoke. The Betty rolled violently to the left and Barber narrowly avoided a mid-air collision. Looking back, he saw a column of black smoke and assumed the Betty had crashed into the jungle. Barber headed towards the coast at treetop level, searching for the second bomber, not knowing which one carried the targeted high-ranking officer. The crashed remains of Yamamoto's Mitsubishi \\"Betty\\" bomber in a Bougainville jungle Barber spotted the second bomber, carrying Chief of Staff Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki and part of Yamamoto's staff, low over the water off Moila Point, trying to evade an attack by Holmes, whose wing tanks had finally come off. Holmes damaged the right engine of the Betty, which emitted a white vapor trail, but his closure speed carried him and his wingman Hine past the damaged bomber. Barber attacked the crippled bomber and his bullet strikes caused it to shed metal debris that damaged his own aircraft. The bomber descended and crash-landed in the water. Ugaki and two others survived the crash and were later rescued. Barber, Holmes and Hine were attacked by Zeros, Barber's P-38 receiving 104 hits. Holmes and Barber each claimed a Zero shot down during this melee, although Japanese records show that no Zeros were lost. The top cover briefly engaged reacting Zeros without making any kills. Mitchell observed the column of smoke from Yamamoto's crashed bomber. Hine's P-38 had disappeared by this point, presumably crashed into the water. Running close to minimum fuel levels for return to base, the P-38s broke off contact, with Holmes so short of fuel that he was forced to land in the Russell Islands. Hine was the only pilot who did not return. Lanphier's actions during the battle are unclear as his account was later disputed by other participants, including the Japanese fighter pilots. As he approached Henderson Field, Lanphier radioed the fighter director on Guadalcanal that \\"That son of a bitch will not be dictating any peace terms in the White House\\", breaching security and endangering the code- breaking program. Upon landing, one engine quit from fuel starvation. He immediately put in a claim for shooting down Yamamoto.  Japanese-American involvement  The Military Intelligence Service (MIS) was made of mostly Nisei (second-generation Japanese Americans). They were trained in interpreting, interrogation, and translation with materials ranging from standard textbooks to captured documents, in the war against Japan. A major MIS contribution in the Solomons campaign was the ambush of Yamamoto. MIS soldier Harold Fudenna intercepted a radio message indicating the whereabouts of Admiral Yamamoto. Although this message was first met with disbelief that the Japanese would be so careless, other MIS linguists in Alaska and Hawaii had also intercepted the same message, confirming its accuracy.  Aftermath  Yamamoto's ashes return to Japan at Kisarazu aboard battleship Musashi on May 23, 1943 Yamamoto's state funeral, 5 June 1943 The crash site and body of Yamamoto were found on April 19, the day after the attack, by a Japanese search-and-rescue party. The crash site was located in the jungle north of the coastal site of the former Australian patrol post and Catholic mission of Buin (which was re-established after the war several kilometers inland). The retrieval party noted Yamamoto had been thrown clear of the plane's wreckage, his white-gloved hand grasping the hilt of his katana sword, his body still upright in his seat under a tree. Hamasuna said Yamamoto was instantly recognizable, his head tilted down as if deep in thought. A post-mortem of Yamamoto indicated two bullet wounds, one to the back of his left shoulder, and a separate wound to his left lower jaw that appeared to exit above his right eye. The Japanese navy doctor examining Yamamoto's body determined the head wound killed Yamamoto. These more violent details of Yamamoto's death were hidden from the Japanese public, and the medical report whitewashed, this secrecy \\"on orders from above\\" according to biographer Hiroyuki Agawa. In Japan, Yamamoto's killing became known as the \\"Navy k≈ç incident\\" (:ja:Êµ∑ËªçÁî≤‰∫ã‰ª∂). It raised morale in the United States and shocked the Japanese, who were officially told about the incident only on May 21, 1943. The announcement said that the admiral in April while directing strategy on the front lines had \\"engaged in combat with the enemy and met gallant death on a war plane.\\" Norman Lodge, an Associated Press correspondent in the South Pacific, had found out what had happened and had filed a detailed story about the mission on May 11 which said the United States had been tracking Yamamoto for five days before the shoot-down, but U.S. military censors prevented the story from going out. At this point, U.S. officials had not disclosed anything about the operation, and the American public first learned of Yamamoto's death when the May 21 Japanese statement was covered in the news. The Japanese account was augmented by American writers noting that Yamamoto's purported claim that he would dictate peace terms to the United States from a seat in the White House was now sure not to happen. Roosevelt was quoted as saying \\"Gosh!\\" on May 21 upon supposedly learning the news from reporters about the Japanese announcement. Over the next couple of days there were stories in the U.S. press speculating that the Japanese announcement was itself a cover for Yamamoto having committed hara-kiri because the war was not going well for the Japanese. Then on May 31 Time magazine ran separate stories several pages apart, one of which reported the Japanese announcement and one of which related how Lanphier and his P-38 pilots on Guadalcanal had shot down three Japanese bombers over Bougainville and then flown home wondering if they had killed \\"some Jap bigwig\\" in the bombers. However the Japanese did make any conclusion from this. Regardless of any cover story, intelligence officials in Great Britain were upset by the operation; not having suffered the Pearl Harbor attack themselves, they did not have the same visceral feelings towards Yamamoto and did not think that killing any one admiral was worth the risk to Allied codebreaking abilities against Japan. Indeed, Prime Minister Winston Churchill protested the decision to go ahead with the operation to Roosevelt himself. The American public did not learn the full story of operation, including that it was based on broken codes, until September 10, 1945, after the conclusion of the war, when many papers published an Associated Press account. Even then U.S. intelligence was frustrated because they wanted to keep the secret longer as they were still debriefing Japanese intelligence officers and feared knowledge of the code-breaking would rush those officers into shame-driven suicide.  The crash site today  The crash site of Yamamoto's aircraft, 323 is at a position . This is an area of jungle, around from the town of Panguna, and an hour's walk from the nearest road. Although the aircraft has been heavily scavenged by souvenir hunters, its main parts remain where they were when it crashed. The crash site is on private land; access was previously difficult, for the ownership of the land was disputed. However, , it is possible for visitors to gain access to the site by prior arrangement. Part of one wing has been removed and is displayed, on permanent loan, at the Isoroku Yamamoto Family Museum in Nagaoka, Japan. One of the aircraft's doors is at the Papua New Guinea National Museum and Art Gallery.  Credit controversy  Although Operation Vengeance was notable for its target, there has been controversy about who shot down the admiral's aircraft. The issue began immediately after the mission when the US military credited Thomas Lanphier with the kill. The captain claimed in his report that after turning to engage the escort Zeros and shooting the wings off one, he had flipped upside down as he circled back towards the two bombers. On seeing the lead bomber turning in a circle below him, he came out of his turn at a right angle to the circling bomber and fired, blowing off its right wing. The plane then crashed into the jungle. Lanphier also reported that he saw Lt. Rex Barber shoot down another bomber which also crashed into the jungle. From the report, US intelligence assumed that three bombers had been downed because Lt. Besby F. Holmes claimed the \\"Betty\\" that crashed into the sea. None of the remaining pilots were debriefed after the mission because no formal interrogation procedures existed on Guadalcanal at that time. Likewise, Lanphier's claim of the kill was never officially witnessed. Many of the mission's other pilots soon became skeptical about the official US Army version. Six months later, unauthorized details about the operation leaked into the press. In October 1943, an issue of Time magazine featured an article about Vengeance and mentioned Lanphier by name. An outraged US Navy considered it a serious breach of security. As a result Major John Mitchell, who had been nominated for the Medal of Honor, was downgraded to the Navy Cross; this was the same award subsequently presented to all the pilots of the killer flight. The controversy did not subside after the war because of the testimony of the surviving Japanese escort pilot who witnessed the mission. Zero pilot Kenji Yanagiya, who had been in Yamamoto's fighter escort, told John Mitchell he might have been responsible for the loss of Lt. Raymond Hine because he had heavily damaged a P-38 (escorting another Lightning that had not dropped its fuel tanks), although neither he nor any of the other Zero pilots had claimed a P-38 that day. The cause of Hine's disappearance is still officially undetermined. Yanagiya also affirmed that none of the escorting Japanese fighters were shot down, only one was damaged enough that it required a half day of repair at Buin. These details contradicted Lanphier's claim for a Zero. Likewise Japanese military records confirmed that only two Mitsubishi G4M bombers had been shot down on the day. Eventually Lanphier and Barber were officially awarded half credits for the destruction of the bomber that crashed into the jungle, and half credits to Barber and Holmes for the bomber that crashed at sea. Several ground inspections of Yamamoto's crash site have determined that the path of the bullet impacts validated Barber's account because \\"all visible gunfire and shrapnel damage was caused by bullets entering from immediately behind the bomber\\" not from the right. Subsequently, Barber petitioned the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records to have his half credit on the bomber shared with Lanphier changed to a whole credit. In September 1991, the Air Force History Office advised the board that \\"enough uncertainty\\" existed in both Lanphier's and Barber's claims for them both to be accepted; the board's decision was split on Barber's petition. Secretary of the Air Force Donald B. Rice ruled to retain the shared credit. Barber then applied to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to have the ruling of the Secretary of the Air Force overturned and the opposing claims re-investigated, but the court refused to intervene. In May 2006, Air Force Magazine published a letter by Doug Canning, a former pilot of the 347th Fighter Group who flew on Operation Vengeance (he escorted Lieutenant Holmes back to the Russell Islands). Canning, who was friends with both Lanphier and Barber, stated that Lanphier had written the official report, medal citations, and several magazine articles about the mission. He also claimed Barber had been willing to share the half credit for shooting down Yamamoto until Lanphier had given him an unpublished manuscript he had written claiming he alone had shot down the admiral. Canning agreed that Barber had a strong case for his claim citing the testimony of another pilot from Yamamoto's Zero escort, Kenji Yanagiya, who saw Yamamoto's \\"Betty\\" crash 20 to 30 seconds after being hit from behind by fire from a P-38. Likewise the second Betty carrying Ugaki crashed 20 seconds after being struck by aircraft fire. Canning stated categorically that the P-38Gs flown that day did not have aileron boost to assist in turning (as did later models) making it physically impossible for Lanphier's aircraft to have made the 180 degree turn fast enough to intercept Yamamoto's plane in less than 30 seconds. The Air Force later disqualified Lanphier's claim for shooting down a Zero in the battle, meaning that Lanphier lost his \\"ace\\" status as his total number of air-to-air kills dropped from five to four. In spite of criticism from Barber and other surviving pilots from the mission, Lanphier continued to claim credit for downing Yamamoto until his death in 1987. Most newspaper obituaries reporting Lanphier's death credited him with killing Yamamoto. Rex Barber continued to contest Lanphier's claim, mainly in military circles and publications, until his death in 2001. Lt. Julius Jacobson, another pilot on the mission, remarked in 1997, \\"There were 15 of us who survived, and as far as who did the effective shooting, who cares?\\" Donald Rice, the then secretary of the Air Force, commented in 1993, \\"Historians, fighter pilots and all of us who have studied the record of this extraordinary mission will forever speculate as to the exact events of that day in 1943. There is glory for the whole team.\\"  Notes   References   Contains interview with Besby Frank Holmes. * Contains another interview with Besby Frank Holmes. * * Further reading * * ‚Äì obituary on the death of Lt.

Earlier life Petro Doroshenko was born in Chyhyryn to a noble Cossack family with a strong leadership background. His father, a Registered Cossack, held the rank of colonel, and his grandfather Mykhailo held the bulava in the 1620s as hetman of the Registered Cossack Army. Though it is not known where Doroshenko studied, there is no doubt that he received an excellent education. Doroshenko became fluent in Latin and Polish and had a broad knowledge of history. In 1648 Doroshenko joined the forces of Bohdan Khmelnytsky in the uprising against the Polish domination of Ukraine. In the earlier stages of the uprising Doroshenko served in both a military and a diplomatic capacity. He primarily served in the Chyhyryn regiment, where he held the rank of artillery secretary, eventually being appointed colonel of the Pryluky regiment in 1657. When Khmelnytsky's death occurred in 1657 Doroshenko supported the election of general chancellor Ivan Vyhovsky as Khmelnytsky's successor. Between 1657 and 1658 he helped Hetman Vyhovsky to suppress the pro-Russian uprising of Iakiv Barabash and Martyn Pushkar, a bloody fratricidal conflict, resulting in some 50,000 deaths. Hetman Pavlo Teteria promoted Doroshenko to the rank of his chief (general) yesaul in 1663. Doroshenko became the leader of the Cossack starshyna (senior officers) and elements within the ecclesiastical authorities who opposed 1654 Treaty of Pereyaslav. Supported by Crimean Tatars and Ottoman Turkey in 1665, Doroshenko crushed the pro-Russian Cossack bands and eventually became Hetman of Ukraine (Right-bank Ukraine). Hetman Hetmancy and Treaty of Andrusovo Poland withdrew from the right-bank Ukraine due to numerous peasant and cossack uprisings, whose rebels sought to secure their liberties with military support from countries other than Poland and Moscow. They found it in the realm of the Ottoman Empire, the Crimean Khanate. In the beginning the first Hetman recognized by Crimea was Sotnyk (captain) Stepan Opara from the Medvedesky company. However, that same summer of 1665 he was replaced by Doroshenko. In order to strengthen his new position, Doroshenko introduced reforms in hope of winning the respect of the rank and file Cossacks. Doroshenko would often organize general councils where he would listen to the lower classes' opinions.Orest Subtelny. Ukraine a History. University of Toronto Press, 1988. And in order to rid himself of the dependence on the starshyna (senior officers), the hetman created the Serdiuk regiments which consisted of 20,000 mercenary infantry units who took orders only from him. When his hetmancy began, Doroshenko, like all Right-bank hetmans, followed a pro-Polish line, but he quickly changed this policy upon hearing the signing of the 1667 Treaty of Andrusovo. The treaty officially divided Ukraine between Russia and Poland, with Russia gaining sovereignty over Left-bank Ukraine and Poland acquiring Right-bank Ukraine. Once the news reached Doroshenko, he reportedly suffered a seizure upon learning of Ukraine's partitioning. Doroshenko quickly deserted his pro-Polish position and decided to seek aid from the Ottoman Empire. War with Poland and Turkish alliance In the fall of 1667 Doroshenko, with support of Crimean Tatars, defeated the Polish forces at the Battle of Brailiv (Brailiv) in Podolia.Petro Doroshenko at the Encyclopedia of Ukraine After the battle, Doroshenko's opposition, led by the Kosh Otaman Ivan Sirko and Tatars stopped his further advance against Poles. With the Right-Bank seemingly secured, Doroshenko and his men crossed into Left-bank Ukraine and supported an uprising of Ivan Briukhovetsky against Muscovy. Following Briukhovetsky's execution, Doroshenko was proclaimed the hetman of all Ukraine on . As Doroshenko was reaching his zenith of power after successfully reuniting Ukraine, his numerous enemies united against him. The new Polish offensive forced him to return to the Right-bank Ukraine, appointing Demian Mnohohrishny acting hetman of the Left-bank. Doroshenko managed to secure the release from Polish captivity of the Metropolitan of Kyiv, Yosyf Tukalsky- Neliubovych, who moved his seat to Chyhyryn. In January 1668 the Council of Officers (Seniors) in Chyhyryn expressed its support for Doroshenko's intentions to ally with the Ottoman Empire. In autumn of 1668 the Cossack delegation was sent to Istanbul with a proposal for military alliance between the Cossack state and the Ottoman Empire. The alliance was approved again at the 1669 Korsun Cossack Council (General Military Council) on 10‚Äì12 March. The alliance was eventually proclaimed by sultan Mehmed IV on 1 May 1669. Separatism of Mnohohrishny, Sukhoviy and Khanenko At the same time in the fall of 1668 Demian Mnohohrishny pledged his allegiance to Muscovy and on 13 March 1669 his election was confirmed. Also in the fall of 1668 some Zaporizhian Cossacks who opposed Doroshenko elected new hetman the Zaporizhian Sich chancellor Petro Sukhoviy who also secured support of Crimean Tatars.Petro Sukhoviy at the Encyclopedia of Ukraine. Sukhoviy challenged Doroshenko, but he was defeated at the battle of Olkhivets by the troops of Petro Doroshenko and Ivan Sirko. In summer of 1669 Sukhoviy along with Tatars attacked Doroshenko, but the Ottomans requested for Crimean Tatars to withdraw their support for Sukhoviy. In June 1669 Sukhoviy was deposed and he supported the election of the Uman Regiment Colonel Mykhailo Khanenko. Eventually Sukhoviy escaped to Crimea after Khanenko was defeated by Doroshenko at the battle of Stebliv on 29 October 1669. In 1670 in Ostrog through the local commission, Doroshenko unsuccessfully tried to revive the principles 1658 Treaty of Hadiach in negotiations with Poland. Meanwhile, Khanenko's envoys managed to conclude a treaty with the Poles in Ostrog on 2 September 1670.Mykhailo Khanenko at the Encyclopedia of Ukraine. Soon after the Poles recognized his hetmancy, Khanenko and Jan Sobieski launched a massive invasion onto the Right-bank. War campaign against Poland and Russia In 1672, with a force of 12,000 he aided the 100,000 strong Ottoman Army which invaded Poland defeated Polish army at the battle of Chertvenivka and laid siege to Kamenets (it had been captured and sacked) as well as Lviv. The war ended with the capture of Podolia and the signing of the Peace of Buchach. According to the terms of the treaty, the Podolia voivodeship was turned into an Ottoman province. And the Bratslav Voivodeship and the southern portion of the Kyiv Voivodship were to be recognized as Cossack territory administered by Doroshenko under a Turkish protectorate. But the war left consequences for Doroshenko, devastating his country. The vast Ukrainian territory was laid waste, cities were burned down, and hundreds of people were taken into captivity by the Crimean Tatars. Meanwhile, in summer of 1672, Demian Mnohohrishny was replaced by Ivan Samoylovych at the 1672 Cossack general council near Konotop, Cossack Grove. As the Right-bank faced devastation by the Turkish power, Doroshenko began to lose the respect of his previously loyal civilians because of his collaboration with the \\"hated infidels.\\" Although the alliance did perform an integral part in his successes, the rest of the population suffered at the hands of the Turks. As his forces were weakened from the ongoing wars, Doroshenko was forced to rely increasingly on the Ottomans. This was very unpopular with the majority of deeply Orthodox Christian Cossacks. As the Turks were considered the hated infidels of Europe.Paul Robert MagocsiA History of Ukraine. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. On the 1674 Council of Officers in Pereyaslav (17 March) Samoylovych was proclaimed the Hetman of all Ukraine. However the title was not in force until Doroshenko would abdicate.Ivan Samoylovych at the Encyclopedia of Ukraine. In summer of 1674 Samoylovych along with the Muscovite Grigory Romodanovsky launched an expedition against Doroshenko and besieged Chyhyryn. At that time Mykhailo Khanenko surrendered his hetman title to Samoylovych in exchange for some land estates. The Grand Vizier Kara Mustafa managed in time to lift the siege and drive the Muscovite forces beyond Dnieper. However, already in the fall of 1675 at the Cossack councilPetro Doroshenko at the Ukrainians in the World portal. in Chyhyryn Doroshenko abdicated and pledged his allegiance to Muscovy witnessing by Ivan Sirko. However, the Muscovite government demanded him to do that at the Left-bank Ukraine and it should be witnessed by Samoylovych and Romodanovsky, the request of which Doroshenko refused. In the fall of 1676 Samoylovych with 30,000 army crossed Dnieper and once again besiege Chyhyryn. After several hours of battle Doroshenko asked his 2,000 Serdiuk garrison stop resistance as he decided to abdicate (19 September 1676). Doroshenko was arrested and brought to Moscow where he was kept in honorary exile, never to return to Ukraine. Service for Russia Voivode of Vyatka Natalia Pushkina, countess of Merenberg, one of the most charming women of her time, painting, 1849 In 1676 Petro Doroshenko asked new Russian Tsar Feodor III to forgive him and promised his loyalty. In 1679 he was appointed voyevoda (governor-duke) of Vyatka in central Russia, and after a few years was granted an estate of Yaropolcha in Volokolamsk Uyezd. Petro Doroshenko died in 1698 near Volokolamsk. To this day he remains a controversial figure in Ukrainian history. Some consider him a national hero who wanted an independent Ukraine, while to others he was a power-hungry Cossack Hetman who offered Ukraine to a Muslim Sultan in exchange for hereditary overlordship of his native land. Descendants Among his descendants are Natalia Pushkina, Maria Nirod, and Dmytro Doroshenko. Natalia would marry the poet Alexander Pushkin, and have a daughter named also Natalia, who was named the Countess of Merenberg following her marriage to her husband, a Nassau prince. Their descendants subsequently married into, amongst others, the Romanov dynasty and the Westminster and Milford-Haven noble families of Great Britain. Dmytro on the other hand was a prominent Ukrainian political figure during the Russian Revolution and a leading Ukrainian emigre historian during the inter-war period. In 2013, with the support of the museum ‚Äúmyzei Hetmanstva‚Äù the \\"Hetman Petro Doroshenko fund‚Äù was created.

It was built during the latter stages of the Nine Years' War in June 1601 by Lord Mountjoy to help secure Moyry Pass and the Gap of the North. It is set in the corner of a small bawn and is a small rectangular tower three storeys high. Moyry Castle is a State Care Historic Monument sited in the townland of Carrickbroad, in Newry, Mourne and Down District Council area, at grid ref: J0576 1466. Moyry Castle, is built on solid rock, It is almost square, 8 metres each way and is three stories high. There are musketry loopholes on each wall except the North facing wall. This wall held the fireplaces which protrude on the outside. History From 1601 on this place became known as Ballinemoyree or place of the moyre and was called in Irish \\"Bother a Mhaighre\\". A captain Anthony Smith, was made constable of the castle and left to guard the pass with twelve men. In the patent rolls in 1606 King James I set aside the following area for the maintenance and security of the castle, fort and ward of Moyry: the towns, Dromintee, Carrickbroad, Dromad, Faughilotra, Faughart Faughiletra, part of Feede. The man who ordered the castle to be built was called Lord Deputy Mountjoy, who replaced Lord Deputy Essex who was beheaded after signing a truce with the enemy, the O'Neills. Lord Mountjoy's real name was Charles Blout. He was 36 when he was sent to Ireland by Queen Elizabeth. He was a soldier, Courtier, Scholar, Bookman and was also deeply religious. He could also speak French and Italian. It was Mountjoy's belief that \\"in every fort some little keepe (or tower) of stone be built, neither need these little castles be works of any great charge for they may be easily made such as this people will hardly force them\\". After this the Moyry pass was a relatively safe passage from North to South. In 1641 the confederates garrisoned the castle and in August‚ÄìSeptember 1690 King William's army, under the command of Schomberg marched from Belfast, through this pass to Dundalk on their way to the Boyne. Lieut. Colonel Laurence Dempsey of Galmoy's regiment commanding 40 dragoons and Lieut. Colonel Fitzgerald of Bellew's regiment with a company of infantry ambushed a Williamite detachment at the stone bridge near Jonesborough on 23 June early in the morning, routing the Williamite infantry and taking prisoners. There were casualties on both sides, and Dempsey, a veteran of almost half a century of European warfare died of his wounds on the eve of the Battle of the Boyne at Oldbridge. In one account of this journey this area is described as having vast mountains between which there is a great bog. Through the middle of this bog is a long road with a deep ditch and a small stone bridge. The road runs towards a place called the Four-mile house the present Half-way house. The bog is believed to be the Dun-a-ree bog which is now believed to be part of the railway embankment. The most famous story of this area, is about a cat. Mountjoy left his warder and 12 men to garrison the Castle in 1601. Shortly after this, his warder shot a local man reputed to be a wizard, as a spy. The wizards sole companion was an enormous black cat, who in revenge, destroyed the garrison. He slit the throats of the army's flocks and herds and carried them off. And so, for many a long day, the Cat of Moyry Castle was a terror to the soldiers of the pale.

Randy Tolsma finished the season for the team, who finished 29th in points that year. ;Bobby Hamilton Jr. (2002-2004) After 2001, Rensi switched to Ford Tauruses and signed Bobby Hamilton Jr. to drive. After a slow start, the two began to gain momentum, and they picked up their first win at the Busch 200, and finished eighth in points. This success carried over into the next season as well, as Hamilton won four races and finished fourth in points. They would not be able to win in 2004, and after the Cabela's 250, Hamilton left to drive for PPI Motorsports at the Nextel Cup level, and Mike McLaughlin took over for the rest of the season, finishing second at the Stacker 200 Presented by YJ Stinger. ;Ashton Lewis (2005-2006) In 2005, Rensi signed Ashton Lewis to drive the 25 car. Lewis had five top-ten finishes and a fourteenth-place finish in points. After many poor performances, however, Lewis was released and the Marines left as a sponsor. ;David Gilliland and Richard Johns (2007) For 2007, credit report site FreeCreditReport.com signed on as sponsor, with Nextel Cup driver David Gilliland and head engineer Richard Johns originally slated to share the ride. During the RoadLoans.com 200 weekend, Gilliland announced his departure from the No. 25, citing that he needed to focus on his Yates Racing No. 38 Cup ride. Johns drove for the remainder of the season. ;Bobby Hamilton Jr. (2008) The team returned Hamilton to the ride for the 2008 season in the newly renamed Nationwide Series, as his No. 35 team had folded. Smithfield Foods served as the sponsor for 30 races, and Hamilton drove to a fifteenth-place points finish with two top-ten finishes. Boris Said drove the 25 for two road course races with No Fear sponsorship. ;Part-time (2009-2011) The No. 25 returned for one race in 2009, at ORP with Hamilton Jr. driving. In 2010, the No. 25 raced at Richmond and Chalotte with Kelly Bires behind the wheel and Raybestos as the sponsor. For 2011, the No. 25 team, with driver Kelly Bires, quailifed for the Daytona race, but lack of funding caused them to start and park, only completing a few laps.  Craftsman Trucks  Team Rensi began fielding a Craftsman Truck team in 2000, after purchasing equipment from Dale Earnhardt, Inc.. Driver Jimmy Hensley drove the mostly unsponsored No. 16 Chevrolet Silverado to a 13th- place finish in points. In 2001, Donohue began running the No. 16, but after three races, the team shut down due to sponsorship issues. Randy Tolsma drove the No. 61 that year and was tenth in points when his team closed as well due to financial problems. He ran one final Truck race for Rensi in 2002 (driven by Butch Miller), finishing 18th in a Marine-sponsored truck at Martinsville Speedway, the last race for Rensi's truck program.

Early activism Mutambara was president of the Student Representative Council of the University of Zimbabwe in 1988 and 1989. He led anti-government protests at the University of Zimbabwe which led to his arrest and imprisonment.

Movement for Democratic Change In 2005 the MDC split into two factions following a dispute over whether or not to participate in the March 2005 senatorial election. While MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai, Mutambara, and others opposed participation, Welshman Ncube and Gibson Sibanda led a faction that favoured participation. Those supporting the senate elections won narrowly against the leader Morgan Tsvangirai's vote. Tsvangirai later overruled and overturned the decision of the plebiscite citing two absent members had sent in postal votes that canceled the slender margin. In February 2006 at a Congress of the breakaway faction Movement for Democratic Change, Mutambara was elected as president of the party. Commenting on the election, Mutambara said, \\"My position was that the MDC should have boycotted those Senate elections. I guess then that makes me the anti-Senate leader of the pro-Senate MDC faction. How ridiculous can we get? That debate is now in the past, let us move on and unite our people.\\" The choice of Mutambara as leader was said to have been inspired by the fact that he is a Shona whereas Sibanda and Ncube are both Ndebele, but realised that only a Shona candidate could win an election across the whole of Zimbabwe. Mutambara is not a member of the House of Assembly. The faction led by Tsvangirai described Mutambara's election as a nullity. In his MDC faction presidential acceptance speech,MDC faction presidential acceptance speech Communist University of Johannesburg Mutambara stated, \\"We believe that our views on land reform in Zimbabwe are different from those of Western governments. Our approach is not driven by the interests of white farmers, but by those of all Zimbabweans, white and black. While we put the failure of the land reform program squarely on the ZANU‚ÄìPF government, we also acknowledge the complicity of some Western governments which reneged on agreements, and the inertia of white farmers in seeking pre- emptive solutions.\\" However, David Karimanzira, a leading member of the ZANU‚ÄìPF, alleged that Mutambara was promoted by the West after Western governments decided not to continue backing Morgan Tsvangirai because the Zimbabwean people had allegedly rejected his party manifesto. He once called the African Union a \\"club of dictators\\".Zimbabwe: Era of Puppet Politics Over AllAfrica Mutambara was arrested by the Zimbabwe police on 19 May 2006 while leading a march in support of his faction's candidate on the eve of the Budiriro by-election.

History The company was formed on 30 September 1927 when Hubert Scott-Paine bought and renamed the Hythe Shipyard with the intention of transforming it into one of the most modern mass production boat building yards in the country. Together with his chief designer, Fred Cooper, the company produced the 26-foot single step hydroplane racing boat Miss England I.Fast Boats Flying Boats by Adrian Rance Later after Fred Cooper had left, Hubert Scott-Paine designed Miss Britain III. From 1930 the British Power Boat Company supplied seaplane tenders to the Air Ministry, commencing with RAF200, a 37-footer. The trials of this and other boats was carried out by T. E. Shaw (T. E. Lawrence) on behalf of the Royal Air Force, and he and Scott-Paine worked together over the next few years. These tenders were powered by twin 100bhp Meadows petrol engines giving a maximum speed of 29 knots (some of the later ones were fitted with Perkins S6M diesels). The company marketed its own modified Napier Sea Lion engines under the name \\"Power\\" Marine Engines.http://www.enginehistory.org/Napier/Bishop/NapierSealionMOTAT03.jpg On 3 August 1931 the factory burnt to the ground, but was rapidly rebuilt as the most modern and efficient boatyard in Britain. Motor Torpedo Boats with a hard chine were designed, built, and increasingly sold to the British Admiralty. Armoured target boats were also built for the RAF, proving very successful and cost-effective, together with tenders for Imperial Airways flying boats, and admiral's barges. PT-9 at Washington D.C., 1940 In 1939, due to the difficulties in obtaining British engines, Scott-Paine took PT-9 to the US to enable Elco to mass-produce PT boats using Packard motors.

The station is managed by Abellio ScotRail and is located on the Cumbernauld Line, north east of Glasgow Queen Street (High Level) station and the Motherwell to Cumbernauld Line, north of . Trains serving the station are operated by ScotRail. The patronage at Cumbernauld station does not compare well with that of stations in similar towns such as , possibly due to the awkward position on the southeastern periphery of the town, around a 20-minute walk from the town centre. Other residential areas (including Westfield and Balloch) are closer to , while Condorrat and Greenfaulds are served by Greenfaulds railway station. Some areas like the Village or Abronhill are not within reasonable walking distance of a station, although Abronhill is close to the line, which has recently been electrified. History Caley main line The station was built by the Caledonian Railway and opened on 7 August 1848 on their line from Gartsherrie (on the former Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway) to Greenhill on the Scottish Central Railway. The line gave the Caledonian access to central & north eastern Scotland from Glasgow and its main line from , but the station at Cumbernauld wasn't a commercial success as the village it served wasn't particularly large; and so it closed after just one year of operation. It was eventually reopened in 1870 to be served by local passenger services from Glasgow Buchanan Street on the lines toward Falkirk & Stirling. When planning the new town in the 1950s, there was some consideration made to siting the town centre near the current railway station rather than on the hill top. The railway station in this scheme would then have been moved to the Luggie and Shank valley near the A73, beyond Lenziemill and Blairlinn. However, it wasn't until the after the building of the new town started that the area's population began to expand significantly, and usage of the station increased. This also ensured that the station avoided the Beeching Axe in the early 1960s, even though (as noted) it wasn't particularly well sited for many of the newly built residential developments. The line did though lose its direct link with the city after the closure to passengers of the Buchanan Street terminus in November 1966.Railscot - Buchanan Street Extension Railscot; Retrieved 2014-01-28 The diversion of all main line expresses and the remaining local routes into Queen Street left the station without any trains serving it, and so a replacement service had to be introduced. This consisted of a DMU shuttle along the old main line into Glasgow, which was still operational as far as the works at St Rollox; however, just east of there they were re-routed onto the former Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway's Sighthill Branch to Cowlairs, which they used as far as . Trains terminated there, with passengers having to change onto North Clyde Line electric services over the former City of Glasgow Union Railway branch to and Queen Street Low Level. Regular local services southwards towards and had also ceased by this time, although a limited number of longer distance trains continued to call there - notably the London Euston to Clansman & Royal Highlander expresses from the early 1970s onwards. Through running to Queen Street High Level was eventually introduced in 1989, and since then several intermediate local stations along the line have reopened with backing from the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive. Services both northwards to (September 1999) and southwards to Motherwell (May 1996) have also been reintroduced, whilst the opening of the Cowlairs Chord in 1993 meant that services could now proceed directly to Queen Street without having to reverse alongside the depot at Eastfield as before. The lines to Glasgow & Coatbridge have been electrified (as part of the Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement Programme), with electric operation beginning in the spring of 2014. This has seen service frequencies on the Glasgow line increased to three per hour, and through running on electric services to the west end of Glasgow via the North Clyde Line through Queen Street Low Level. The station building is also undergoing major refurbishment as part of this work, with a new modular structure opened in July that year.\\"On the right tracks; work sees major change at Cumbernauld train station\\" Campbell, Scott Cumbernauld Media news article 19-05-2014; Retrieved 2014-05-19 Further electrification northwards to Greenhill Junction is due for completion in 2018 (as part of the next phase of the EGIP), which will coincide with a further planned timetable recast that will see the existing service to Falkirk doubled to two trains per hour and extended through to Edinburgh Waverley via .

These were not considered to be worth retaining in an exposed condition and so the area was re-covered. There were originally two villages: Bix Brand and Bix Gibwyn.South Oxfordshire Archaeology Group: The Search for the Site of the Lost Church of Bix Gibwyn The toponym has at various times been Byxe and Bixa.

On 17 July 2015 it became a weekly publication, Tydzie≈Ñ Polski, The Polish Week. After 75 years, the Polish Daily becomes a weekly Publication began within three weeks of the arrival in London of the Polish government-in-exile and the paper was considered the official organ of the legal Polish authorities, recognised by HM Government and the Allies of World War II. From 1959, in addition to the Monday to Friday issues, a weekend edition came out on Saturdays, under the title, Tydzie≈Ñ Polski, The Polish Week. The editorial offices were for many years in Charleville Road in London's West Kensington. History Between 1940 and December 1943 the paper appeared as \\"Dziennik Polski\\", (the Polish Daily). On 1 January 1944 it merged with \\"Dziennik ≈ªo≈Çnierza\\" (the Soldier's Daily) which had been the house journal of the I Polish Corps published in Glasgow between 1940 and 1943. Until 1945 the combined title became the mouthpiece of the Polish government in exile. It published news of events as the war unfolded, ministerial communiqu√©s and publicised tragic discoveries such as the Katyn massacre, the death of General Sikorski or the Tehran Conference preparatory to the Yalta Conference. There were reports from Occupied Poland and other theatres of war. It also carried information aimed at assisting the daily life of a population that had not yet sufficiently mastered English. Although the now shadow Polish government remained in London until a Polish government was freely elected in Poland in 1990, it had ensured the paper's future by a one-off financial settlement under a board of independent trustees which continued until 1968. From then the exiled Polska Fundacja Kulturalna (Polish Cultural Foundation) in London became its publisher. Post-war In the immediate aftermath of World War II, two seismic events affected the paper. The first was the transfer of British government recognition to the Communist authorities in Warsaw which had immediate financial repercussions. The second was the arrival in Great Britain of over 150,000 Polish allied troops and thousands of displaced persons emerging from camps in Western Europe. The Polish Resettlement Act 1947 did however grant permanent settlement rights to the Polish population which came mainly from the Kresy region of Poland and whose right of return to their homeland was permanently barred under the Yalta provisions. Accordingly, one third of Poland's territory had been ceded to the Soviet Union, including the two most important Polish centres of culture outside Warsaw and Krak√≥w, that were the cities of Lwow and Wilno. It was as a consequence of this, that historically many original contributors to the paper were Kresovians, as were their readers. 2011 logo of The Polish Daily As Poles in the United Kingdom became increasingly assimilated and the older generation passed on, Polish cultural structures came under severe financial pressure. The Polish Daily was no exception as it struggled with a dwindling circulation and falling advertising revenue so that combined with poor management in 2005 it came close to ceasing publication altogether. It was temporarily rescued by the appointment of new trustees and a generous donation from the Polish Combatants' Association. It was also somewhat aided by the influx of a new wave of Polish migrants. However, its format and competition from newer media meant a radical reorientation became inevitable. Current weekly publication With profound demographic changes in the readership over seven decades, and the appearance of free Polish language print publications after 2004 and offers online, the paper's strategy has had to adapt. The content includes British and Polish and world news, comments, readers' letters, features and obituaries as well as advertising of services pertinent to Polish migrants and older residents in a tabloid newspaper. The forty page edition comes out on Fridays. The paper has subscribers and is also sold through 2,500 outlets across the British Isles. It has an estimated readership of 30,000.

Pukhov fought in World War I as a junior officer, afterwards joining the Red Army and fighting in the Russian Civil War, rising to become chief of staff of a division. During the interwar period he served as an instructor at several military academies, and following the Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, he was given command of the 304th Rifle Division. In January 1942 Pukhov was promoted to command the 13th Army, which he led for the rest of the war. He was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for his leadership of the army during the Battle of the Dnieper in September and October 1943. Postwar, Pukhov commanded the 8th Tank Army and several military districts before becoming the head Soviet advisor to the Romanian People's Army, the last position he held before his death.  Early life and World War I  Pukhov was born on January 25, 1895, in the village of Grishovo in Kaluga Governorate. The son of an official, he graduated from the Kaluga Theological Seminary in 1915. He enrolled in the Moscow University but did not attend it, working as a history and literature teacher at the higher primary school in the village of Plokhino in Zhizdrinsky Uyezd of Kaluga Governorate from October, before being mobilized for service in the Imperial Russian Army in April 1916. He was sent to the 2nd Peterhof School of Praporshchiks, receiving the rank of Praporshchik upon graduation in October. Pukhov became a junior officer in the 163rd Reserve Infantry Regiment, stationed in Chelyabinsk. He was sent into combat on the Northern Front in June 1917 as a junior officer in the 186th Infantry Division's 744th Keidan Infantry Regiment. He served as chief of horse reconnaissance and intelligence for about two months but was gassed in the Battle of Riga near Ik≈°ƒ∑ile in August. In January 1918, Pukhov was demobilized with the rank of Praporshchik.  Russian Civil War  Pukhov joined the Red Guards in February 1918 at Liski as an adjutant in the headquarters for formation of Red Guard detachments, who conducted forced requisitioning in Voronezh Governorate and fought anti-Soviet forces. After the Red Guards were incorporated into the Red Army in May, he became the adjutant of the 2nd Voronezh Regiment (formed from the Red Guard detachments), fighting against the White Army led by Pyotr Krasnov in Voronezh Governorate in the areas of Pavlovsk and Bobrov. In early March 1919, Pukhov transferred to the 8th Army as chief of staff of its Kalach Group of Forces after the regiment was disbanded. In April, he became chief of staff of the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Special Division, formed from the group, and was appointed chief of staff of the Ryazan Infantry Division's 1st Brigade in October. The brigade was part of the screening force against White cavalry commander Konstantin Mamontov's raid into the rear of the Southern Front. In November, the brigade was sent to the 7th Army, where it became part of the 1st Consolidated Division of the Karelian Combat Sector (redesignated the 55th Rifle Division on 21 November), fighting the Finnish Whites on the Karelian Isthmus. Between January and February 1920 the brigade was renamed the 164th Brigade and was a separate unit, part of the Pytalovo group of the 15th Army; it fought against Latvian troops in the Latvian War of Independence in the Pytalovo area. In March the brigade served with the 55th and 11th Rifle Divisions in battles against Polish troops around Polotsk. During the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, the brigade continued to fight in the Polotsk area with the Northern Group of the 4th and 15th Armies. During July and August, with the Cavalry Corps of the 4th and 3rd Armies, and subsequently the Grodno Group of Forces, the brigade launched attacks towards Vilno, Grodno, ≈Åom≈ºa, Bia≈Çystok, and Brest. After the defeat of the Red Army in September, the brigade was disbanded and Pukhov transferred to become chief of staff of the 61st and then the 63rd Brigades in the 3rd Army's 21st Rifle Division, which retreated from Grodno to Lida in heavy fighting. In January 1921, he was promoted to chief of staff of the division, covering the White Sea coast near Arkhangelsk. In April, the 21st was transferred to Siberia, where it eliminated Andrey Bakich and Alexander Kaygorodov's remnant White forces in the Altai Mountains.  Interwar period  Prior to World War II, Pukhov had little command experience. After the end of the Russian Civil War, he became chief of staff of the West Siberian Military District's 35th Rifle Division in April 1923. Between January 1924 and 1929 Pukhov commanded the 12th Rifle Division's 34th Rifle Regiment in the Siberian Military District. In September 1925, he entered the Vystrel Officers Improvement Course, graduating in October 1926, and in March 1930 was transferred to become a Vystrel tactics instructor himself. Pukhov then transferred to the Red Army's new and growing mechanized forces, and became assistant chief of the 1st Department of the Red Army Auto- Armored Division in July 1932. He was sent to Officers Technical Improvement Academic Courses at the Military Academy of Motorization and Mechanization in March 1934 and graduated in January 1935, becoming senior head of the tactics department there following graduation. Pukhov was made a Colonel in December after the Red Army re-introduced regular military ranks. In July 1936, Pukhov became assistant chief in charge of training at the Gorky Armored School, which moved to Kharkov in March 1938. At Kharkov, he became the head of the school. In April 1939, Pukhov transferred to become an instructor at the Red Army Military-Economic Academy, and was promoted to Kombrig in April 1940. He became a Major General on 4 June when the Red Army reintroduced generals' ranks. That year he received the academic title of assistant in the tactics department. In January 1941 Pukhov became chief of the Training Department of the Military Quartermaster Academy after it was renamed from the Military- Economic Academy.  World War II  On August 28, 1941, more than two months after Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union began, Pukhov was ordered to replace the commander of the 38th Army's 304th Rifle Division; this was his first field command since the rifle regiment about 15 years earlier. At the beginning of September it was transferred to the Kozelshchyna area, where until September 17 it suffered heavy losses in heavy defensive fighting, retreating east to the area of Sanzhery, Reshetylivka, and Poltava. The 304th then fought in the Donbass Defensive Operation during October, then was withdrawn to the reserve in the Snezhny Kut area. Pukhov held this position until January 20, 1942, when he was given command of the 13th Army, which he held until mid-1946. Until the middle of 1942 the army, part of the Bryansk Front, held defensive positions on the line of Skorodnoye and Kolpny. The army fought in the Battle of Voronezh in mid-1942 and the Voronezh-Kastornensk offensive operation in early 1943. On 14 February, following the latter, Pukhov was promoted to Lieutenant General. During the Battle of Kursk in July, the army, holding positions on the northern face of the Kursk bulge, repulsed six days of German attacks in fierce fighting, preventing a German breakthrough and limiting the German advance to 10‚Äì12 kilometers. When the Soviet troops switched over to the attack after decisively defeating the German army, the 13th Army fought in Operation Kutuzov. The army advanced into Ukraine in the Chernigov-Pripyat Offensive. By 26 August, the army had advanced over 300 kilometers in less than a month. On 9 September, the army crossed the Desna River in the area of Obolonnaya and Spasskoye, repulsing German counterattacks for six days before resuming the advance. Between 15 and 16 September, the army crossed the bend of the Desna in the Chernigov and Morovsk area. Expanding the bridgehead, the army captured Chernigov on 21 September.

The band achieved success in their native Scotland, scoring five top twenty hits on the Scottish Singles Chart (two of which reached the top five) and also scored three top forty singles on the UK Singles Chart between 2002 and 2005. Despite some commercial success the group was subject to controversy in 2003, when one of their singles became ineligible to chart due to apparent bulk buying in an attempt to manipulate the charts. Their debut album also failed to chart in either the Scottish or UK Album charts and the group lineup changed several times before the band eventually disbanded in 2005. The band members consisted of Lisa Rose (2002‚Äì2003), Nikki MacLachlan (2002‚Äì2004), Sarah Cassidy (2002‚Äì2004), Shonagh Strachan (2002‚Äì2004), Leona Skimming (2003‚Äì2004) and Emma Cassidy (2003‚Äì2004). History Lemonescent came together through auditions for singers held by former Johnny Hates Jazz songwriter/member Iain MacDonald; He had chosen eight girls and then cut down to four with singer and dance champion Lisa Rose Harrison, former waitress Nikki Maclachlan, singer and dancer Sarah Cassidy, and Shonagh Strachan. They were signed to Supertone Records, distributed by Universal Music and came up with the name Lemonescent. They released their first single \\"Beautiful\\" on 17 June 2002 (originally recorded and released by Iain's band Purely Physical in 1991, and originally featured TV presenter Jenny Powell on vocals). The video was filmed at Culzean CastleMcGrath, Leanne (2002) \\"HOW TO MAKE A GIRL BAND ; Behind the scenes with Lemonescent\\", Sunday Mail, 14 April 2002, p. 36 by Brighter Pictures, Directed by Gavin Hay.

Harrison left the band due to disagreements with their manager over their sound. Their manager made several negative remarks about Lisa after she had left the band. After Harrison's departure, the remaining members auditioned for a replacement, eventually taking on two new members, Emma Cassidy (Sarah's cousin) and Leona Skimming. Their fourth single (and their first to include new members Emma and Leona), \\"Cinderella\\" was released in June 2003, and entered the UK charts at No.31, their highest charting hit of their career.

It is situated some 3.5 miles (6 km) north-west of the city centre, towards the seaward end of the Avon Gorge, lying between the former villages of Shirehampton to the west and Westbury-on-Trym & Stoke Bishop to the east, at the mouth of the River Trym where it joins the River Avon. Sea Mills forms part of the city ward of Kingsweston. Despite Roman remains, its place in the history of the area before the 20th Century is small. History Sea Mills was the site of a Roman settlement, known as Portus Abonae. The name and location suggest that this was a river or sea port. The Roman settlement seems to have been abandoned by the 4th century, and there is no evidence of Saxon settlement.Foundations of Roman building in Portus Abonae. By the Middle Ages Bristol had become a major port, with all traffic between the port and the sea having to pass through the Avon Gorge and past Sea Mills. In 1712, Joshua Franklyn, a Bristol merchant, built a wet dock at Sea Mills, to eliminate the need for large sailing ships to navigate the dangerous River Avon any further upstream. This was located where the River Trym enters the River Avon. However, poor transport links doomed the enterprise and the harbour facilities fell into disrepair by the end of the 18th century. Some remains of the dock still exist, and are used as a harbour by pleasure craft. In the 1920s and 1930s, Sea Mills was developed as a planned green suburb. Much of the housing was local authority, although it is now mainly in private ownership. Adjacent to the Portway is a small estate of prefabricated bungalows dating from a post-WW2 housing scheme. Sea Mills also has its own football team Sea Mills Park FC, formed in 1925 and has now been running for over 90 years, the 1st team currently play in the Bristol Premier Combination. They historically played their games at the Rec, opposite Sea Mills Square, but play all home games at Kingsweston Sports & Social, Napier Miles. They were recent Bristol & District Senior League Champions 2012/13 beating Chipping Sodbury Town Res. 6-1 on the final day of their league campaign to clinch the title. October 2006 saw the opening of The Portway Rugby Development Centre. The facilities there are 2 outdoor 3G Crumb pitches, suitable for Rugby and Football, outdoor grass Rugby pitches (ready for August 2007) and grass training grids. There are 2 meeting rooms situated and they host many meetings and aerobics classes. A number of local football clubs use this facility including Wanderers FC. Many of Bristol's rugby clubs use the facilities also, from St Brendans RFC to Clifton RFC. The remains of the dock wall and the Severn Beach line crossing the River Trym at Sea Mills Transport In 1865, the Bristol Port and Pier Railway opened from Hotwells to a deep water pier on the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth. Sea Mills railway station was one of the original stations on the line. The station still exists, although the line is now part of the National Rail network, and the line has been extended to run from Bristol Temple Meads to Severn Beach. The wide A4 Portway trunk road passes along the south-west edge of Sea Mills and links central Bristol with its port at Avonmouth. Running parallel to the serpentine path of the River Avon, the Portway was the most expensive road in Britain when it was opened in 1926. Both the Portway and the railway line have bridges over the harbour outfall into the Avon. Ocean-going ships used to sail past Sea Mills, going to and from Bristol Docks. Nowadays most of the shipping is in the form of pleasure craft, Bristol's main docks now being at Avonmouth and Portbury. There are frequent bus services to the city centre, Westbury and Cribbs Causeway.

The contemporary Fedoskino painting preserves the typical features of Russian folk art. The use of oil paint, typically applied in many layers, is a distinctive feature of a Fedoskino miniature, as well as the use of mother-of-pearl, pure gold or silver leaf under segments of the background to create the effect of a shimmering glow or silvery sparkle. Many boxes are painted inside and outside in imitation tortoiseshell, birch bark, mahogany or tartan. The heyday of Fedoskino miniature fell on the second half of the 19th century, and the works of that time are known as 'lukutins', named after the merchants Lukutins, who owned the Fedoskino factory at that time. Petr Lutukin inherited the factory in 1824 and it remained in the families ownership until 1904. After a brief interlude in the hands of former Lutukin workers ('The Fedoskino Artel of Former Lutukin Factory Workers') the factory effectively ceased trading until after the revolution, when in 1923, Fedoskino wares were awarded a diploma for 'superb artistic skill' at the All Union Exhibition of Agricultural, Industrial and Cultural Products; which was held in Moscow in that year. Some of the factory craftsmen had artistic education, and many of them had come from icon-painting studios. In 1931 the opening of a vocational school of miniature painting at Fedoskino ensured the perpetuation of the art form, which allowed the continued development through the following years. Stylistically the Fedoskino factory is distinct from the other schools of miniature lacquer painting: notably those of Palekh, Mstera and Kholui. Masterpieces of Russian Folk Art.

Kabel belongs to the \\"geometric\\" style of sans-serifs, which was becoming popular in Germany at the time of Kabel's creation. Based loosely on the structure of the circle and straight lines, it nonetheless applies a number of unusual design decisions, such as a delicately low x-height (although larger in the bold weight), a tilted 'e' and irregularly angled terminals, to add delicacy and an irregularity suggesting stylish calligraphy, of which Koch was an expert. A variety of rereleases and digitisations have been created. Design Kabel shows influence from Expressionism as much as from Modernism, and may be considered as a monoline sans-serif companion of Koch's Koch-Antiqua, sharing many of its character shapes and proportions. This is visible in its low x-height and its two-storey 'g' with a large, partly open lower loop, similar to William Morris's Troy Type, and its 'e' with a tilted centre-stroke, similar to early Renaissance typefaces and also seen in Morris's type designs. The termini of vertical and horizontal strokes are cut an angle, often at right angles to stroke direction, suggesting writing with a pen. This gives Kabel the effect of not quite sitting on the baseline and makes for a more animated, less static feeling than Futura. The capitals vary considerably in width and show influence of Roman square capitals, for instance in the wide 'M' and narrow 'E'. The capital 'W' has a four-terminal form. In the book/regular version, the uppercase 'U' has a stem to the right, which is especially noticeable in the light weight. The capital 'Y' forms a continuous stroke with its tail. Koch marketed Kabel with a specimen showing the capitals supposedly derived from a construction grid of perfect rectangles and circles, but Walter Tracy and others have noted that this graphic does not really resemble the letters of the printed type, which were clearly drawn freely rather than by uncorrected geometry: \\"Koch probably drew [his] letters without constraint, and then 'rationalised' them afterwards‚Ä¶Koch was evidently not a man to be bound by arbitrary rules. In Kabel Light the arms of E are actually three different lengths, the bowl of R is deeper than that of B, and in P it is deeper still‚Ä¶and Y does not have the vertical stem shown in the diagram. In short, Koch's sense of style is in command, rather than any geometric formula. The result is an alphabet of capitals that relate perfectly without need [of] 'mathematical harmony'‚Ä¶they are, for my taste, the most attractive of all sans-serif capitals.\\" Of the name, Adobe's release notes for their version of Kabel comment: \\"Kabel was not named after any specific cable, although the Zugspitze cable car been completed in 1926, and a Berlin-Vienna facsimile telegraphy line opened in 1927. The name had techie cachet in its day (Piet Zwart's NKF kabel catalogue of 1927 is well-known) and is primarily metaphorical and allusive, a pun referring to both the monolinear construction of the face, and the role of type as a means of communication.\\" Release The original release of Kabel was in four weights: Light (released first), Medium/Book, Black, and Heavy. The latter has a redesigned structure to fit the thicker strokes, with an enlarged x-height and more regularity, without the angled terminals of the lighter weights. Also released was an inline design, ‚ÄúPrisma‚Äù, a headline weight ‚ÄúZeppelin‚Äù, and condensed weights. Some metal type releases offered stylistic alternates, alternate characters with a different design. Many reduced the eccentricities of Kabel and in particular made it more resemble Futura, which was very dominant in printing of the period. (This offering of Futura-like alternates such as a single-storey ‚Äòa‚Äô, which historian Paul Shaw has called a \\"Futura-ectomy\\", was common among other sans-serifs of the time, including Monotype's Gill Sans, Linotype's Metro and Erbar.) Originally released by the Gebr. Klingspor Foundry, the design continued to be made available by the Stempel Foundry (which bought Klingspor in 1956, having already owned some shares) and briefly for phototypesetting systems. Linotype continues to sell Kabel in digital format. Owing to Kabel's popularity, many adaptations and simple knock-offs were sold by other companies, such as Phil Martin's Alphabet Innovations. This particularly occurred in the phototypesetting and digital type periods, taking advantage of the lack of international copyright protection for typefaces. ITC Kabel ITC Kabel Victor Caruso's 1975 adaptation for phototypesetting was created for the International Typeface Corporation, licensing the design rights from Stempel. It follows the standard ITC approach of a dramatically increased x-height accompanied by a unified set of weights from Book to Ultra, for instance retaining the angled-terminal motif into the bold weights. ITC also sold ITC Grizzly, an adaptation of the bold weight. Neue Kabel A 2016 release by Marc Sch√ºtz with an x-height between the original and the ITC digitisation in 9 weights with italic styles to complement them. Another distinction that Neue Kabel has are stylistic alternates such as lower-case letters \\"a\\", \\"g\\", \\"e\\" and \\"l\\", circular and 45¬∞ square tittles. Other Bhikkhu Pesala created the open-source revival Kabala, named after a PƒÅli word meaning 'a morsel of food' due to its intended use in Buddhist religious publications. This release is inspired by the ITC weight set and structure, but adds a number of features including italics, small caps and combined characters. Ray Larabie's Canada 1500 was based loosely on the original Kabel, with its low x-heights. Commissioned with a full set of characters to support the languages of Canada, he donated the original version, \\"Canada 150,\\" to the government of Canada upon its 2015 completion for use in Canadian sesquicentennial celebrations, then released it into the public domain shortly before Canada Day 2017 (the day of the sesquicentennial) as what he described as a \\"birthday gift\\" to his native country.

While normally a regular person named Joe, he obtains the ability to transform into Viewtiful Joe by entering a movie and gaining the ability from an older superhero named Captain Blue in order to save his girlfriend, Silvia. He was created by the game's director, Hideki Kamiya, and illustrated by Kumiko Suekane. In the video games he is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, while he is voiced by Jason Palmer and Tomokazu Seki in the English and Japanese dubs of the anime series respectively. Joe has appeared in several video games, both in his series and in spin-off material. He first appeared in Viewtiful Joe, where he obtained his signature costume and abilities. This release was followed by two sequels titled Viewtiful Joe 2 and Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble!; in the first, Joe is teamed with Silvia, who has become the superhero Sexy Silvia. One more game was released in the series titled Viewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble, a fighting spin-off game featuring Joe amongst other characters from the series. Joe has appeared in three other fighting games from Capcom: Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars, Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, and Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Joe has received generally positive reception. Concept and creation Joe's character design, created by Kumiko Suekane, was inspired specifically by 1960s and 1970s Japanese-costumed tokusatsu television shows such as Kamen Rider and Ultraman. The design is most akin to the Tatsunoko Productions hero, Casshern. The protagonist of Viewtiful Joe was originally going to be a cute and innocent- looking character who had great physical prowess and super powers, but the developers found this boring and went with a cooler character. In its earliest stages of development, the character went under the working title \\"Red Hot Man\\", but the name was changed due to copyright conflicts with the American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. When designing the star of the video game Bayonetta, Kamiya described two of his characters, Joe and Dante from Devil May Cry as a mischievous kid and a tough guy respectively, and that he wanted to create a different character from these archetypes. Characteristics Viewtiful Joe has the power to slow down the movie, speed it up, and to zoom into the picture, much like camera effects seen in movies. At first, he is only able to use his powers in movies; however in Viewtiful Joe 2, he demonstrated, when in the real world, that his V-Watch will respond when in front of an audience, enabling him to transform outside of the movie. His inability is again apparent in Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble! when he attempts to transform with nobody around; this is solved when Silvia points her special camcorder, The V-Cam, at Joe. Joe's arsenal also includes Voomerangs, a boomerang-like blade weapon thrown from Joe's helmet; and Shocking Pink, which is a short fused bomb. He also has control over the (Machine Six in the English anime) which can take the form of a jet ship, a digger and a large robot. Appearances His first appearance was in the 2003 video game Viewtiful Joe for the Nintendo GameCube, which was later ported to PlayStation 2. Joe first gains his super hero persona when he is taken into the film world and is granted it by aged super hero Captain Blue. After battling several super villains, he discovers that Captain Blue is the true villain, and defeats him. He appears in the sequel, Viewtiful Joe 2, along with his girlfriend, who now goes by the name Sexy Silvia. Joe is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker in both games. Joe also stars in the spin-off title Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble! and is a playable fighter in both his Viewtiful and normal \\"Movie Fan\\" forms in Viewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble. Joe is a playable character in the Wii version of the 2008 fighting game Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Cross Generation of Heroes and its update, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All- Stars, where his VFX Powers form some of his special moves. He also appears as a playable character in Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds and Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Joe appears in the mobile game, Combo Crew as a playable character. In other media Joe appears as the main protagonist of the Viewtiful Joe anime series, voiced by Tomokazu Seki in Japanese and Jason Palmer in English. The show loosely adapts the events of the first two games, with Joe battling to rescue Silvia from the Jadow organization, then later fighting to stop the Black Emperor and his Gedow soldiers. Unlike the games, Joe is accompanied in most episodes by Captain Blue Jr., an original character who acts as Joe's sidekick. Joe also appears in Archie Comics' Worlds Unite crossover between its Mega Man and Sonic the Hedgehog titles, where he and Silvia are among the many Capcom and Sega heroes recruited to battle Sigma. Reception Since appearing in Viewtiful Joe, Joe has received generally positive reception. IGN suggested Joe as a likely choice for inclusion in Super Smash Bros. series, pointing out that many fans had similar sentiments. Nintendo Power listed Joe as their 12th favourite hero, saying that he has an inimitable style and introduced the memorable quote \\"Henshin-a-go-go, baby!\\". Including him in the 2013 list of \\"The 30 best Capcom characters of the last 30 years\\", GamesRadar staff commented that \\"The character starred in a quick succession of games, then vanished almost as fast as he became popular, but recent guest appearances in Capcom crossover games have given the hero a new lease on life.\\" GameDaily listed him as the ninth best Capcom character, citing in part his carefree style. However, they also listed him as character that make people want to mute their games, commenting that while he was initially an interesting character due to being an \\"average joe\\" who turns into a superhero, his voice quickly became irritating. Similarly, Complex listed him as the 19th most annoying character in video games, noting the fact that he repeats \\"Henshin a go go\\" a lot, and stating that \\"The game might have been dope, but the title character needed to go. He was the worst thing about it.\\" References Category:Beat 'em up characters Category:Capcom protagonists Category:Male characters in anime and manga Category:Male characters in video games Category:Marvel vs. Capcom fighters Category:Parody superheroes Category:Video game characters introduced in 2003 Category:Video game characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Video game characters with superhuman strength Category:Video game superheroes Category:Viewtiful Joe (series) ","title":"Viewtiful Joe (character)"},{"id":"4275099","text":"Golitsyn on a 2020 stamp of Russia Prince Lev Sergeyevich Golitsyn (; 24 August 1845 ‚Äì 26 December 1915) was a leading Russian winemaker of the 1890s. He established the production of sparkling wines in Russia. Biography Lev Sergeyevich was born into the House of Golitsyn. After graduating from the University of Paris in 1862, between 1864 and 1867 he served as a clerical officer at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1872 he received a second degree, in law, from the Moscow State University, and from 1872 to 1874 studied in Germany. Later in the 1870s he participated in an archaeological expedition in Vladimir Directorate that discovered several Stone Age sites. In recognition for this work, in 1877 Golitsyn was elected as a corresponding member of the Moscow Archaeological Society. In 1878 Golitsyn bought a manor house near Sudak in Crimea. There he started cultivating grape, eventually growing up to ca. 600 varieties. His vineyards gradually spread across Crimea into the Caucasus. In the 1880s he established the production of sparkling wines using the classical French technology, that is, direct fermentation in bottles. He also setup mass production of table, liqueur and dessert wines, such as white and pink nutmeg and port wines. In those years Golitsyn became an avid collector of 17th‚Äì20th century wines, eventually accumulating ca. 50,000 bottles. Golitsyn's winemaking career peaked in the 1890s, when he was a leading Russian winemaker. By 1912 his fortune declined, and he donated a large part of his lands and vineyards to Nicholas II of Russia aiming to preserve them as part of the Imperial estates.

Dunseverick Castle and earthworks are Scheduled Historic Monuments in the townland of Feigh, in Moyle District Council area, at grid ref: C9871 4467. Dunseverick Castle and the peninsula on which it stands were given to the National Trust in 1962 by local farmer Jack McCurdy. The Causeway Cliff Path also runs past on its way to Dunseverick Harbour to the east and to the Giant's Causeway to the west. History Saint Patrick is recorded as having visited Dunseverick castle in the 5th century AD, where he baptized Olc√°n, a local man who later became a Bishop of Ireland. The original stone fort that occupied the position was attacked by Viking raiders in 870 AD. In the later part of the 6th century AD, this was the seat of Fergus Mor MacEirc (Fergus the Great). Fergus was King of Dalriada and great-uncle of the High King of Ireland, Muirceartaigh (Murtagh) MacEirc. It is the 500 AD departure point from Ireland of the Lia Fail or coronation stone. Murtagh loaned it to Fergus for the latter's coronation in western Scotland part of which Fergus had settled as his sea-kingdom expanded. The O'Cahan family held it from circa 1000 AD to circa 1320 AD, then regained it in the mid 16th century. The last of the family to have the castle was Giolla Dubh √ì Cath√°in, who left it in 1657 to settle in the Craig/Lisbellanagroagh area. Post 1660 they use the anglicised name McCain/O'Kane. The castle was captured and destroyed by General Robert Munro in 1642 and his Cromwellian troops in the 1650s, and today only the ruins of the gatelodge remain. A small residential tower survived until 1978 when it eventually surrendered to the sea below. It was a 'key' ancient site in Ireland. One of the five great royal highways, or slighe of ancient Ireland, Slige Midluachra, had its terminal point at Dunseverick castle, running from here to Emain Macha and further to Tara and the fording point on the Liffey at what is now Dublin.

That night, it was aired as the first of a two-part pilot special, along with \\"Allen\\", which was broadcast straight after this episode. The episode was directed by series producer Brett Ratner, noted director of such works as Rush Hour and Red Dragon, and written by series creator and producer Paul Scheuring. The episode was given numerous positive reviews in not just the US, but from the majority of the rest of world, reaching record ratings in various countries. The episode introduces the two main protagonists of the series: Michael Scofield (played by Wentworth Miller) and Lincoln Burrows (played by Dominic Purcell). Lincoln Burrows has been sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit: the murder of Terrence Steadman, the brother of the Vice President of the United States. Every motion to delay or appeal to Burrows' execution has been exhausted due to the high profile of the case. Burrows' brother Michael Scofield, a structural engineer, plans to get himself incarcerated so he can save his brother from his death sentence, by using his new body tattoo. Plot Michael Scofield receives a mysterious body tattoo, and then strips his apartment of articles of various people from Fox River, along with a hard disk which he throws into a river. The next day, he robs a bank, but surrenders without incident when the police arrive. Michael is sent to court, refusing to put up a fight, even after his lawyer, Veronica Donovan (Robin Tunney) attempts to defend him, so he is sentenced to 5 years at Fox River, the prison he requested to be sent to. Upon entering Fox River, Michael meets Capt. Brad Bellick (Wade Williams), whom he quickly discovers to be somewhat arrogant. He then meets his cell mate, Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco), who tells him the only thing he can do is serve time. Sucre shows Michael around the outside, noting the territories throughout. He then shows Michael to the isolated Lincoln Burrows (or \\"Link the Sink\\" as they call him) who killed Terrence Steadman, the Vice President's brother. Michael realizes the only way to get to his brother is to join PI (Prison Industries) of which John Abruzzi (Peter Stormare) is in charge. Michael approaches Abruzzi, but is rejected, where he calmly tells Abruzzi that he has something he needs - and leaves an origami crane, giving him a sign that he knows of Fibonacci, the informant who put Abruzzi in prison. Abruzzi allows him to join PI. In the infirmary, Michael introduces himself to Dr. Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies), whom he tries to charm. She gives him his insulin shot, since Michael claims to have Type 1 diabetes. On Michael's second visit, Sara notices his abnormally low glucose level and tells him that he is reacting to the insulin as if he is not diabetic. She then says that on his next visit, she would like to run a test. To keep up his bluff, Michael approaches C-Note (Rockmond Dunbar), the prison \\"pharmacist\\" and pays him in advance for PUGNAc, an insulin blocker. Elsewhere, Sucre proposes to his girlfriend, Maricruz Delgado (Camille Guaty), who visits him in conjugal, and accepts. Burrows' son, L.J. (Marshall Allman) starts dealing cannabis, but is arrested by the police. Veronica sees Michael, who tells her to find out who is setting Lincoln up. A bishop McMarrow (Chelcie Ross) attempts to delay Lincoln's death sentence, where he is visited by Secret Service agents Paul Kellerman (Paul Adelstein) and Daniel Hale (Danny McCarthy). After he ignores their warning, McMarrow is shot and killed in his sleep, at which point, Veronica starts to suspect Burrows may be framed. Fox River's warden, Henry Pope (Stacy Keach) asks Michael if he can finish making a model of the Taj Mahal for his anniversary with his wife, where he eventually starts working. Later, Michael meets Lincoln, and tells him he is going to get him out. After PI, a skeptical Lincoln asks Michael if he's seen the blueprints to the prison. Michael says, \\"Better than that -- I've got them on me.\\" He reveals his mysterious body tattoo, which is a series of geometric patterns that disguise the blueprints to Fox River, upon which Michael will base his escape plans throughout the series. Production The original concept of Prison Break--a man deliberately getting himself sent to prison in order to help someone else (his brother, in this case) escape--was suggested to Paul Scheuring by producer Dawn Parouse, who wanted to produce an action-oriented series. Although Scheuring thought it was a good idea, he was initially stumped as to why someone would embark on such a mission or how he could develop it into a viable television show. He came up with the story of the wrongfully accused brother, and began working on the plot outline and devising the characters. In 2003, he pitched the idea to the Fox Broadcasting Company but was turned down as Fox felt nervous about the long-term possibilities of such a series. He subsequently showed the concept to other channels but was also turned down as it was thought to be more suited for a film project than a television series.Goldman, E., \\"Paley Fest: Prison Break\\", IGN.

Martinez (born Maria Poveka Montoya), her husband Julian, and other family members examined traditional Pueblo pottery styles and techniques to create pieces which reflect the Pueblo people's legacy of fine artwork and crafts. The works of Maria Martinez, and especially her black ware pottery, survive in many museums, including the Smithsonian, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Denver Art Museum, and more. The Penn Museum in Philadelphia holds eight vessels ‚Äì three plates and five jars ‚Äì signed either \\"Marie\\" or \\"Marie & Julian\\". Maria Martinez was from the San Ildefonso Pueblo, a community located 20 miles northwest of Santa Fe, New Mexico. At an early age, she learned pottery skills from her aunt and recalls this \\"learning by seeing\\" starting at age eleven, as she watched her aunt, grandmother, and father's cousin work on their pottery during the 1890s. During this time, Spanish tinware and Anglo enamelware had become readily available in the Southwest, making the creation of traditional cooking and serving pots less necessary. Traditional pottery making techniques were being lost, but Martinez and her family experimented with different techniques and helped preserve the cultural art.  Early life  Born to Tomas and Reyes Pena Montoya, Maria had 4 sisters: Maximiliana (Ana), Juanita, Desideria, and Clara. Maris was the middle child. Her aunt, Nicolasa, taught her claywork. Maria and all four of her sisters made pottery, and some examples of her sisters' pottery can be seen in exhibits. She told people that she saw an alien on a mountain at eight.  History  A pot by Maria Martinez, approximately 1945, at the de Young Museum in San Francisco During an excavation in 1908 led by Edgar Lee Hewett, a professor of archaeology and the founder and director of the Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe, examples of black-on-white Biscuit Ware pottery were discovered. While searching through the sandy dirt and red clay of the New Mexico desert terrain, broken pieces of biscuit ware were uncovered. (The term biscuit ware was first applied by Kidder (1915) to describe the distinct pottery from Classic period ruins in the Pajarito Plateau and Santa Fe Valley. While biscuit wares appear to have developed directly out of Santa Fe Black-on-white and Wiyo Black-on-white, biscuit wares exhibit characteristics that are quite distinct from earlier pottery types. It is a common misconception that, \\"during the end of the 18th century, the use of plant pigments and finely powdered mineral substances became the preferred technique of painting and slowly caused the extinction of glazed pottery\\". In reality, the nearby inhabitants of Santa Clara Pueblo, were still producing the highly burnished black pottery, since the 1600s, though it had fallen into virtual disuse by the 1900s preceded by a decline in the finish. Hewett sought a skilled pueblo potter who could re-create Biscuit Ware. His intention was to place re-created pots in museums and thus preserve the ancient art form. Maria Martinez was known in the Tewa pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico for making the thinnest pots in the least time; therefore, Hewett saw her as the perfect Pueblo potter to bring his idea to life. This work was distinct from, but invariably confused with (in the popular narrative) the matte black on polished blackware that Maria and her husband experimented with and perfected on their own and for which there was no prior precedent, contrary to popular myth.  Challenges and experiments  Polychrome Avanyu plate by Maria and Popovi Da, 1969 A long process of experimentation and overcoming challenges was required to successfully recreate the black-on-black pottery style to meet Maria‚Äôs exacting standards. \\"As almost all clay found in the hills is not jet black, one specific challenge was to figure out a way to make the clay turn the desired color. Maria discovered, from observing the Tafoya family of Santa Clara Pueblo, who still practiced traditional pottery techniques, that smothering the fire surrounding the pottery during the outdoor firing process caused the smoke to be trapped and is deposited into the clay, creating various shades of black to gunmetal color.\\"Roller, Ryan A. - Santa Clara Pueblo. Great-grandson of Margaret Tafoya. Seventh generation traditional potter. She experimented with the idea that an \\"unfired polished red vessel which was painted with a red slip on top of the polish and then fired in a smudging fire at a relatively cool temperature would result in a deep glossy black background with dull black decoration.\\" Shards and sheep and horse manure placed around the outside and inside of the outdoor kiva-style adobe oven would give the pot a slicker matte finished appearance. After much trial and error, Maria successfully produced a black ware pot. The first pots for a museum were fired around 1913. These pots were undecorated, unsigned, and of a generally rough quality. The earliest record of this pottery was in a July 1920 exhibition held at the New Mexico Museum of Art. Embarrassed that she could not create high quality black pots in the style of the ancient Pueblo peoples, Martinez hid her pots away from the world. A few years later, Hewett and his guests visited the little Tewa Pueblo. These guests asked to purchase black ware pottery, similar to Martinez's pots housed in a museum. She was greatly encouraged by this interest and resolutely began trying to perfect the art of black ware pottery. Her skill advanced with each pot, and her art began to cause quite a stir among collectors and developed into a business for the black ware pottery. In addition, Martinez began experimenting with various techniques to produce other shapes and colorful forms of pottery.  Description of black ware pottery  Maria and Julian Martinez matte-on-glossy blackware wedding vase, ca. 1929, collection of the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art An olla jar has a slightly flattened rim and a marked angle at the shoulder. The one created by Maria and Julian Martinez is characteristic of this type, which is \\"decorated on the rims only, i.e. above the angle of the shoulder.\\" Light is reflected off of the shiny, smooth surface. The jet black ceramic product's finish appears unblemished in any way. A band of a lighter black decoration stands out against a solid black matte background. This type of pot ‚Äúdepends for decorative effect on the manipulation of surface finish alone‚Äù to appear as though the decorations are scratched into the pot's surface. The band wraps directly below the narrow neck of the pot. A wide-eyed avanyu, or horned serpent, encircles the pot and slithers inside the band. The serpent's tongue almost touches the tip of his tail. The snake's body movements seem alive; a tribute to the appreciation the Pueblo peoples have for nature and life. The decorations on the pot give the pot a personality and unique individualized look.  Process  Creating black ware pottery is a long process consisting of many steps requiring patience and skill. Six distinct processes occur before the pot is ready to be sold. According to Susan Peterson in The Living Tradition of Maria Martinez, these steps include, ‚Äúfinding and collecting the clay, forming a pot, scraping and sanding the pot to remove surface irregularities, applying the iron-bearing slip and burnishing it to a high sheen with a smooth stone, decorating the pot with another slip, and firing the pot.\\" The first step in creating a pot is gathering the clay. The clay is gathered once a year, usually in October when it is dry and stored in an old weathered adobe structure where the temperature remains constant. When Martinez is ready to begin molding the clay to form a pot, the right amount of clay is brought into the house. A cloth, laid upon a table, holds a mound of gray pink sand with a fist hole in the center filled with an equal amount of blue sand. A smaller hole is made in the blue sand and water is poured into the hole. The substances are then all kneaded together, picked up within the cloth, washed, and covered with a towel to prevent moisture from escaping where the clay will sit for a day or two to dry. The pukis or \\"the supporting mold, a dry or fired clay shape where a round bottom of a new piece may be formed\\" builds the base shape of the pot looking like a pancake. After squeezing the clay together with one's fingers, a wall is pinched up about an inch high from the pancake base. A gourd rib is used in cross-crossing motions to smooth out the wall, making it thick and even. Coiling long tube shapes of clay on the top of the clay wall and then smoothing it out with the gourd increases the pot's height. Air holes are patched with extra clay and sealed away with the gourd rib like a patch being sewn on a pair of blue jeans. After drying, the pot is scraped, sanded, and polished with stones. This is the most time consuming part of the entire process. A small round stone should be applied to the side of the pot in a consistent, horizontal, rhythmic motion. Rubbing the stone parallel with the side of the pot produces a shiny, polished, even look. Creating the polished finish with the stone is called burnishing. The pot is finally ready to fire after the secondary slip is applied, by painting onto the burnished surface various traditional designs.  Firing  When firing the pots, Maria Martinez used a firing technique called \\"fire reduction\\". A reducing atmosphere occurs when the amount of available oxygen is deficient. This causes the materials being fired to chemically react to obtain oxygen. Firing was a very long process that would take hours the day of in addition to the months of preparation beforehand. She would often receive help from either her husband or her children. The firing had to be done early in the morning on a clear, calm day when wind would not hinder the process. They started by carefully placing all of the pots to be fired in a fire pit, and then covered them carefully with broken pieces of pottery and aluminum sheets or any metal scraps they could find. In order to allow ventilation to keep the fire burning, they left small spaces uncovered, after which they meticulously surrounded the homemade kiln with cow chips - very dry cow dung - used to fuel the fire, careful to leave the vents free. The goal was to prevent any flame from actually touching the pots, hence the protective metal sheets. After covering the kiln with the cow chips, they lit the kindling on all sides to ensure an even distribution of heat. They continued to feed the fire with dry cedar until the fire reached the desired temperature of around 12 to 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on what look they were attempting. If the fire continued to burn, the pottery would achieve a red-brown color. But in order to make the black pottery that Maria was famous for, the fire was smothered with dry powered horse dung. By doing this, the amount of oxygen within the kiln was greatly reduced, therefore creating a reduction atmosphere which caused the color of the pots to turn black. After several hours, they shifted the horse dung around to kill the fire and bury the pots so they could cool slowly. After the kiln had cooled enough, they carefully pulled the pots out using either a stick if the pots were still hot, or waiting until they were cool enough to touch. During the process of firing, they didn't know whether the pots would make it or not.  Decorations  Julian Martinez, Maria's husband, began attempting to decorate the pots she made. Although Julian did eventually master decorating techniques for Maria's pots, the process consisted of many trials and errors. \\"To create his designs, a slurry of clay and water known as slip is created and applied to the already burnished, but yet unfired surface. You cannot polish a design into a matte background, as the stone is not as precise as a brush is.\\" He discovered that after the guaco juice burned out from the heat of the fire, he could mix the guaco with clay which then provided the perfect paint for his decorations. The process Julian settled on was to polish the background first, then matte paint the decoration in the negative. In 1918, Julian finished the first decorated black ware pot with a matte background and a polished Avanyu design. (Still achieved by painting the background on an already burnished surface). \\"The first rush of water coming down an arroyo after a thunderstorm, a symbol of thanksgiving and for water and rain\\" was the interpretation by Julian of an avanyu or a horned water serpent. Many of Julian's decorations were patterns adopted from ancient vessels of the Pueblos. Some of the patterns consisted of birds, road runner tracks, rain, feathers, clouds, mountains, and zigzags or kiva steps. The museum displayed the first two decorated black ware pots painted by Julian.  Signatures  Maria signed her creations in different ways throughout her lifetime. The signatures found on the bottom of the pottery help date the pieces of art. Maria and Julian's oldest work were all unsigned. The two had no idea that their art would become so popular and did not feel it was a necessity to claim their work. The unsigned pieces were most likely made between the years of 1918 and 1923. Once Maria gained success with her pottery she began signing her work as \\"Marie.\\" She thought that the name \\"Marie\\" was more popular among the non-Indian public than the name \\"Maria\\" and would influence the purchasers more. The pieces signed as \\"Marie\\" date the pottery between 1923 and 1925. Even though Julian decorated the pots, only Maria claimed the work since pottery was still considered a woman's job in the Pueblo. Maria left Julian's signature off the pieces to respect the Pueblo culture until 1925. After that, ‚ÄúMarie + Julian‚Äù remained the official signature on all of the pottery until Julian's death in 1943. Maria's family began helping with the pottery business after Julian's death. From 1943 to 1954 Maria's son, Adam, and his wife Santana, collected clay, coiled, polished, decorated, and fired pottery with Maria. Adam took over his father's job of collecting clay and painting the decorations. ‚ÄúMarie + Santana‚Äù became the new signature on the pots. For about thirty years Maria signed her name as ‚ÄúMarie.‚Äù Once her son, Popovi Da, began working alongside his mother, Maria began referring to herself as ‚ÄúMaria‚Äù on the pottery. They began co-signing their pieces around 1956 as ‚ÄúMaria+Poveka‚Äù and ‚ÄúMaria/Popovi.\\" Thus, studying the signature on one of Maria's pots may give a hint at the completion date of the pottery since dates were not added to the pottery until recent years. Although black ware pottery received a lot of success, the true legend behind the pottery is Maria Martinez herself. She won many awards and presented her pottery at many world fairs and received the initial grant for the National Endowment for the Arts to fund a Martinez pottery workshop in 1973. Martinez passed on her knowledge and skill to many others including her family, other women in the pueblo and students in the outside world. When she was a young girl she had learned how to become a potter by watching her aunt Nicolasa make pottery. During the time that she developed what we now know as the San Ildefonso style of traditional pottery, she learned much from Sarafina Tafoya, the pottery matriarch of neighboring Santa Clara Pueblo. When in 1932 she was asked to teach by the government Indian school in Santa Fe, Martinez refused to do so: \\"I come and I work and they can watch,\\" she stated. Her family members had not taught her, and she would not do it herself either - \\"nobody teaches.\\" See also * Cueva de la Olla, Paquime, Chihuahua, Mexico * List of indigenous artists of the Americas * List of Native American artists * Native American pottery * American Museum of Ceramic Art Her artworks has been exhibited and are a part of the Permanent Collection * San Ildefonso Self- Taught Group  References   Further reading  *  External links  * Fact sheet on Maria Martinez Category:1887 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Native American potters Category:Artists from New Mexico Category:American women ceramists Category:American ceramists Category:Pueblo artists Category:Puebloan peoples Category:20th-century American women artists Category:Native American women artists Category:Women potters Category:Cowgirl Hall of Fame inductees Category:People from San Ildefonso Pueblo, New Mexico Category:20th-century ceramists ","title":"Maria Martinez"},{"id":"4275178","text":"Fehriye Erdal (born 25 February 1977) is a female political activist from Turkey.

After her escape, Interpol issued a red bulletin for Fehriye Erdal sending a message to its 186 member countries that she is to be captured and returned to Belgium. Although there have been reports that she has been seen in Cyprus and Jordan, there was no solid information on her whereabouts. In 2008, the Belgian court of appeal acquitted Fehriye Erdal of all charges against her. The court ruled there is no evidence connecting Erdal with terrorist activities. In 2017 she was sentenced in absentia to 15 years in prison by a Belgian court. In 2019, the Belgian authorities declared that they were still looking for Erdal.

LeDoux (born December 7, 1949) is an American neuroscientist whose research is primarily focused on survival circuits, including their impacts on emotions such as fear and anxiety.\\"I'm not studying emotion. I'm studying the function of survival circuits. Survival circuits contribute to emotions but are not emotion circuits.\\" LeDoux as quoted in: LeDoux is the Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science at New York University, and director of the Emotional Brain Institute, a collaboration between NYU and New York State with research sites at NYU and the Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research in Orangeburg, New York. He is also the lead singer and songwriter in the band The Amygdaloids.  Research and theories  Work on threat response, anxiety, and emotions As explained in his 1996 book, The Emotional Brain,LeDoux JE (1996) The Emotional Brain. New York: Simon and Schuster. LeDoux developed an interest in the topic of emotion through his doctoral work with Michael Gazzaniga on split-brain patients in the mid-1970s.Gazzaniga MS, LeDoux JE (1978) The Integrated Mind. New York: Plenum. Because techniques for studying the human brain were limited at the time, he turned to studies of rodents where the brain could be studied in detail. He chose to focus on a simple behavioral model, Pavlovian fear conditioning. This procedure allowed him to follow the flow of information about a stimulus through the brain as it comes to control behavioral responses by way of sensory pathways to the amygdala, and gave rise to the notion of two sensory roads to the amygdala, with the \\"low road\\" being a quick and dirty subcortical pathway for rapid activity behavioral responses to threats and the \\"high road\\" providing slower but highly processed cortical information.LeDoux JE (1994) Emotion, memory and the brain. Sci Am 270:50-57. His work has shed light on how the brain detects and responds to threats, and how memories about such experiences are formed and stored through cellular, synaptic and molecular changes in the amygdala.LeDoux JE (2002) Synaptic Self: How our brains become who we are.

A long-standing collaboration with NYU colleague Elizabeth Phelps has shown the validity of the rodent work for understanding threat processing in the human brain. LeDoux's work on amygdala processing of threats has helped understand exaggerated responses to threats in anxiety disorders in humans.LeDoux JE (2002) Synaptic Self: How our brains become who we are. New York: Viking; LeDoux JE (2015) Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety. New York: Viking.

Work conducted with Karim Nader and Glenn Schafe triggered a wave of interest in the topic of memory reconsolidation,Nader K, Schafe GE, LeDoux JE (2000) Fear memories require protein synthesis in the amygdala for reconsolidation after retrieval. Nature 406:722-726 a process by which memories become labile and subject to change after being retrieved. This led to the idea that trauma-related cues might be weakened in humans by blocking reconsolidation. Studies with Marie Mofils, Daniela Schiller and Phelps showed that extinction conducted shortly after triggering reconsolidation is considerably more effective in reducing the threat value of stimuli than conventional extinction,Monfils MH, Cowansage KK, Klann E, LeDoux JE (2009) Extinction-reconsolidation boundaries: key to persistent attenuation of fear memories.

Science 336:241-245. Difference between threat response and emotions In 2012 LeDoux emphasized the value, when discussing brain functions in animals, of using terms that are not derived from human subjective experience.LeDoux J (2012) Rethinking the emotional brain. Neuron 73:653-676. The common practice of calling brain circuits that detect and respond to threats \\"fear circuits\\" implies that these circuits are responsible for feelings of fear. LeDoux has argued that so-called Pavlovian fear conditioning should be renamed Pavlovian threat conditioning to avoid the implication that \\"fear\\" is being acquired in rats or humans.LeDoux JE (2014) Coming to terms with fear. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 111:2871-2878. In 2015 he emphasised the notion of survival functions mediated by survival circuits, the purpose of which is to keep organisms alive (rather than to make emotions). For example, defensive survival circuits exist to detect and respond to threats, and can be present in all organisms. However, only organisms that can be conscious of their own brain's activities can feel fear. Fear is a conscious experience and occurs the same way as any other kind of conscious experience: via cortical circuits that allow attention to certain forms of brain activity. He argues the only differences between an emotional and non- emotion state of consciousness are the underlying neural ingredients that contribute to the state.LeDoux JE (2015) Feelings: What are they and how does the brain make them? Daedalus 144. These ideas and their implications for understanding the neural foundations of pathological fear and anxiety are explained in his 2015 book, Anxious.LeDoux JE (2015) Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety. New York: Viking. In this he says \\"Fear and anxiety are not biologically wired... They are the consequence of the cognitive processing of nonemotional ingredients.\\"ANxiety, 2015, Chapter 9, p232 In 2018 he further said that the amygdala may release hormones due to a trigger (such as an innate reaction to seeing a snake), but \\"then we elaborate it through cognitive and conscious processes\\". He differentiated between the defence system, which has evolved over time, and emotions such as fear and anxiety. He points out that even simple organisms such as bacteria move in response to threats; \\"It's in the brain to allow an organism, whether it be a bacterium or a human, to detect and respond to danger. ... It's not in the brain to create feelings like fear and anxiety.\\" Lisa Feldman Barrett takes a similar view.  Awards and professional recognition  LeDoux has received a number of awards, including the Karl Spencer Lashley Award from the American Philosophical Society, the Fyssen International Prize in Cognitive Science, Jean Louis Signoret Prize of the IPSEN Foundation, the Santiago Grisolia Prize, the American Psychological Association Distinguished Scientific Contributions Award, and the American Psychological Association Donald O. Hebb Award. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a William James Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.  Books and other public outreach  In addition to numerous publications in scholarly journals, LeDoux has written: * The Integrated Mind (with Michael Gazzaniga, Plenum, 1978) * The Emotional Brain (Simon and Schuster, 1998) * Synaptic Self: How Our Brains Become Who We Are (Viking, 2002) * Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety (Viking, 2015) * The Deep History of Ourselves: The Four-Billion-Year Story of How We Got Conscious Brains (Viking, 2019) He has also edited several volumes, including Mind and Brain: Dialogues in Cognitive Neuroscience (with William Hirst, Cambridge University Press, 1986), The Self: From Soul to Brain (with Jacek Debiec and Henry Moss, Annals of the New York Academy of Science, 2003), and Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder: Basic Science and Clinical Practice (with Peter Shiromani and Terrence Keane, Humana Press, 2009). He has also contributed to The New York Times Opinionator column on anxiety and to the Huffington Post, and has conducted numerous television, radio, online, and print interviews. LeDoux has also collaborated with filmmaker Alexis Gambis on a project called \\"My Mind's Eye\\" on the Scientific American website in which interviews with esteemed scientists and philosophers (including Eric Kandel, Michael Gazzaniga, Ned Block) are framed within the context of his music (see below).  Early life and education  Joseph LeDoux was born on December 7, 1949, in the Cajun Prairie town of Eunice, Louisiana, to Joseph E. \\"Boo\\" LeDoux, a traveling rodeo performer (bull rider) and butcher, and Priscilla Buller LeDoux. He attended St. Edmund's Elementary School and Eunice High School, graduating in 1967. LeDoux attended Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge where he majored in Business Administration and minored in Psychology. In 1972 he began work on a Masters of Science in Marketing from LSU. During this time, his interest in psychology grew and he volunteered in the laboratory of Robert Thompson, who introduced him to brain research.  Academic and professional history  In the fall of 1974 LeDoux began a PhD program at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and completed his degree in 1977. In 1978, LeDoux joined the Department of Neurology at Cornell Medical School as a postdoctoral fellow and remained there through the rank of associate professor until 1989. During most of his time at Cornell, he worked in the Neurobiology Laboratory where he received technical training in state-of-the-art neuroscience techniques and began the research program on the brain mechanism of emotional memory that he has pursued ever since. In 1989 he joined the newly formed Center for Neural Science at NYU as an associate professor. In 1991 he was promoted to full professor, and in 1996 he became the Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science. In 2005, he was named university professor, the highest honor for a faculty member at NYU.  Personal life  In 1971 LeDoux married LSU classmate Diana Steen. They divorced amicably in 1978. Since 1982 he has been married to art critic Nancy Princenthal. Currently they reside in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn. They have two children, Jacob S. LeDoux (died 2005) and Milo E. LeDoux. Milo is a graduate of the University of Oxford, where he studied classics, and is now pursuing a career in law.  Music  Cajun/zydeco, country, R&B;, rock, and their fusion into \\"swamp pop\\", were influences in LeDoux's childhood. In high school, he was a disc jockey at the local radio station, KEUN, and the rhythm guitarist of two bands: the Deadbeats and the Countdowns. Although he remained an avid music fan in later life, he did not actively play guitar for many years. In 2004, LeDoux and NYU Biology Professor Tyler Volk began performing as a cover band for small parties around NYU, and in 2006 they formed The Amygdaloids. The original band also included Daniela Schiller, (then an NYU postdoctoral fellow), and graduate student Nina Curley. The band's lyrics, mostly written by LeDoux, are based on neuroscientific, psychological, and philosophical themes, and offer scholarly insights into the role of mind and brain in daily life. Their inaugural CD, Heavy Mental, was released in 2007. On their second CD, Theory of My Mind, LeDoux and Grammy winner Rosanne Cash sing \\"Crime of Passion\\" and \\"Mind over Matter\\", both written by LeDoux. In 2012, the band released All in Our Minds, an EP in which all songs had \\"mind\\" in their title. Anxious, a companion to LeDoux's book with the same title, was released in 2015 and explores some of the same scientific themes as the book, but through song. The band's unique focus on original songs about mind and brain has landed them considerable press. They play regularly in New York City, and have also performed in Washington DC, San Antonio TX, Indianapolis IN, Lafayette LA, and Montreal. LeDoux and Amygdaloids' bassist Colin Dempsey perform as an acoustic duo called So We Are.

Historically this area formed part of the parish of Westbury on Trym, Gloucestershire, and is now part of Kingsweston ward of the city of Bristol. South of Coombe Dingle is Sea Mills; to the north is Kings Weston Hill; to the west are Kings Weston House and Shirehampton Park; and to the east, Henbury Golf Club and Westbury on Trym proper. The inhabited place appears simply as Combe, Coomb or Coombe, meaning 'short bowl-shaped valley', in documents from the 13th century onwards and on early maps. The name applied to Coombe Farm and Coombe House on the eastern side of the confluence of the Hazel Brook and the Trym, not where the modern suburb lies. This area later became noted for its cherry orchards, commemorated in a modern house-name, and a nursery. Strictly speaking, Coombe Dingle was the wooded narrow valley through which the Trym passes south-west of the farm and house to flow southwards through Sea Mills to the River Avon. The name of the narrow valley was borrowed for the new development consisting mostly of private housing built to the west of the Trym in the 1920s and 1930s on an area called Boulton's (or Bowden's) Fields. It was and remains a desirable area to live. Near the western edge is Haig Close, a small development of houses originally built for ex-servicemen in 1929 on land donated from the Kingsweston Estate by Philip Napier Miles, though this is generally said to be in Sea Mills. Coombe Dingle was once a popular destination for outings from Bristol, and there was a well-known tea-room in the wooded Dingle itself, now a private house. The original winding road passing it, also called The Dingle, has been bypassed by the modern A4162 which is carried across the river on a discreet bridge with a classical-style balustrade. In the Dingle itself, the river drove a flour mill called Coombe Mill. There is a parade of shops on Westbury Lane. There used to be, close to the road bridge and near the northern end of Coombe Lane, a \\"tin\\" (i.e. corrugated iron) Methodist chapel.Tin Tabernacles website It was a small building with plain Gothic-style windows dating from the 1890s, demolished in the mid-1990s and replaced by a house. There are no other places of worship in Coombe Dingle. Coombe Lane is the home of Bristol University sports complex, which is commonly referred to as Coombe Dingle, though it is really in Stoke Bishop.

All OB beers are brewed from rice, rather than the malted barley familiar to Western beer drinkers.In March 2001, the company merged Cass Beer (State) with the production capacity of 1,120,000 KLE per year, and produced red rock, OBE, KaprI, Budweiser, etc. In July 2002, it was the first beer industry to obtain the ISO 9001 certification from the Korea Standards Association. It became a foreign company when it was taken over by Dutch beer company Molte Industries in September 2010 and became a subsidiary of Belgian beer company Anheuser-Bush Inversh in April 2014.

Originally brewed by the Cass Brewery, the brand had been taken over by Jinro-Coors, one of the country's leading brewers. After having around 70% of the Korean lager market in the 1980s, by 1994 Cass had fallen behind Hite as Korea's top selling lager. Oriental Brewery bought the Cass brand from Jinro-Coors in 1999 and built it up again, with OB declaring a 51% market share in 2000. In 2007, the higher alcohol Cass Red was introduced. In 2011 Cass Lager became South Korea's number one selling brand, overtaking Hite. The beer became notable after an endorsement by British celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay who described it as \\"not pretentious\\", \\"easy\\" and \\"fresh\\"; citing it as his preferred beverage with Korean dishes since acquiring a taste for the cuisine 15 years ago. His appearance in several of the beer's adverts caused much derision from viewers who found Ramsay's preference for the beer ‚Äî which was considered to be poor in quality ‚Äî offending despite his status as a chef very scrutinizing of his food palate. Non-alcoholic look-alikes of Cass can be found with brand names such as \\"Cars\\" and \\"Cdss\\". Some norae-bang (song bars) establishments have been known to try to pass off these imitations as the real thing, as Korean law prohibits noraebangs marked as such from selling alcoholic drinks within its premises (as opposed to noraejujeom establishments which are allowed to sell alcohol).

Introduced in 1876 by Carl Conrad & Co. of St. Louis, Missouri, it has grown to become one of the highest selling beers in the United States, and is available in over 80 markets worldwide‚Äîthough, due to a trademark dispute, does not necessarily do so under the Budweiser name. It is made with up to 30% rice in addition to hops and barley malt. Produced in various breweries around the world, Budweiser is a filtered beer available in draft and packaged forms. Bud Ice Introduced in 1994 as \\"Ice by Budweiser\\", it has more alcohol (5.5% ABV) than Budweiser. It is best known for an advertising campaign that involved a malevolent penguin that stalked Bud Ice drinkers and stole their beer, announcing its presence by singing the \\"doo-be-doo-be-doo\\" phrase from \\"Strangers in the Night\\". Hoegaarden Hoegaarden Brewery is a brewery in Hoegaarden, Belgium, and the producer of a well-known wheat beer. Beck's Beck's Brewery, also known as Brauerei Beck & Co., is a brewery in the northern German city of Bremen.

US manufacture of Beck's Brew has been based in St. Louis, Missouri since early 2012 but some customers have rebelled against the US market version. Stella Artois Stella Artois is a Belgian pilsner lager of between 4.8 and 5.2% ABV which was first brewed by Brouwerij Artois (the Artois Brewery) in Leuven, Belgium, in 1926. Since 2008, a 4% ABV version is sold in Britain, Ireland, Canada and New Zealand. Through a series of mergers, Stella Artois is now ordinarily produced by Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer.

It has been translated into English by John Nathan and was published in 1977 together with Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness, Prize Stock and Aghwee the Sky Monster. The work deals with themes of militarism and emperor-worship through the reminiscences of an unreliable narrator. Plot summary The novella is set in the summer of 1970. It is narrated by a 35-year-old man (like all the characters he is not named) who is lying in hospital waiting to die of liver cancer, although the doctors do not believe that the cancer is real. Early on in the novel, the narrator associates his cancer with the imperial symbols, calling it, \\"a flourishing bed of yellow hyacinth or possibly chrysanthemums bathed in a faint purple light\\".The Day He Himself Shall Wipe My Tears Away translated by John Nathan, p. 9. He wears a pair of goggles with green cellophane lenses. The story opens with a late-night encounter between the narrator and a \\"lunatic\\", resembling both the narrator's father and a Dharma, who appears at the end of his bed. The lunatic asks the narrator what he is, to which he replies \\"I'm cancer\\" and throws his nostril clippers at the lunatic. The remainder of the novel comprises the narrator's recollections of his childhood. The main narrative is periodically interrupted by discussions between the narrator and \\"the acting executor of the will\\", who is transcribing the narrator's story. Looking forward to his death, the narrator sings the song, \\"Happy Days Are Here Again\\". He fantasises about obtaining revenge on his hated mother by summoning her to attend his death, and in his narrative tries to recreate his earlier \\"Happy Days\\" of the latter years of the Second World War. His first reminiscences, however, are of the immediate postwar years, in which he was ostracised by the other children for his poverty and \\"animal violence\\".The Day p. 29. He was caught and humiliated by his mother while attempting to commit suicide. He also remembers that by the end of the war he had picked up that his mother's real father had been executed for participating in a revolt against the emperor in 1912. She had then been adopted by a nationalist family working in China. There she met her future husband, who brought her to the village. The narrator's father was 'associated with the military', and was part of an anti-Tojo movement in the Kanto Army to promote General Ishiwara; after the plan failed, he returned to the village on New Year's Day 1943 and shut himself up in the storehouse. There he wore the goggles later used by the narrator and used headphones to listen to a radio. The narrator's parents broke off contact with one another after the father's son by his first marriage deserted from the Japanese army in Manchuria. Both parents sent telegrams to contacts in the army: the mother to help her stepson escape, and the father to preserve the family honour by having him shot. The son was shot. The mother claimed the ashes, and thereafter referred to her husband only as ano hito („ÅÇ„ÅÆ‰∫∫) ‚Äî \\"that man\\", or \\"a certain party\\". The narrator describes the time spent with his father in the storehouse after this breach as the first \\"Happy Days\\" of his life. They culminated in an attempted revolt led by his father on 16 August 1945, the day after the end of the war. The plan was to kill the emperor (to \\"accomplish what your father tried and failed to do\\", as the narrator's father said to his wifeThe Day p. 96.), and to blame the act on the Americans, thereby preventing the country's surrender. The father takes his son with him and his co-conspirators as he leaves the valley. The group sing the closing chorale from the Bach cantata (Ich will den Kreuzstab gerne tragen, BWV 56): Komm, o Tod, du Schlafes Bruder, Komm und f√ºhre mich nur fort; Da wischt mir die Tr√§nen mein Heiland selbst ab (Come, O death, brother of sleep, come and lead me forth; my saviour himself shall wipe my tears away). The father tells his son that the words mean that the emperor will wipe their tears away. The plot is a failure, and the conspirators are all killed (in the narrator's opinion, \\"very likely\\" by American agents in disguise). At the moment of his father's death, he recalls that he saw, \\"high in the sky... a shining gold chrysanthemum against a vast background of purple light... the light from that flower irradiated his Happy Days\\".The Day p. 100. By the time he reaches this part of the story, however, his mother has arrived at the hospital, and it is she who wipes away the tears he sheds. She recalls that her son only survived the massacre of the conspirators because he had already run away. The \\"acting executor of the will\\" agrees with the mother, and from her words it appears that she is the narrator's wife.The Day p. 105. Confronted with his mother's version of events, the narrator retreates further into his own world. He wears a set of earphones as well as the goggles, and listens to a recording of the cantata while singing \\"Happy Days\\". He imagines himself back at the moment of his father's death, crawling towards a father figure so that, \\"his blood and his tears will be wiped away\\".The Day p. 110. Response John Nathan, in the introduction to his 1977 translation of the work, calls it, \\"Oe's most difficult and disturbing work to date\\". Like other commentators, he sees the novel as a response to, and parody of, the militarism of Yukio Mishima, whose failed coup and suicide had taken place in 1970, the same year in which Oe sets his story.Nathan, John (1977). Introduction to Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness p. xi. He ascribes its power to the tension between the \\"anger and longing\\" which he finds in the author's work.Nathan p. xxiii. Susan Napier expands on this interpretation, seeing the narrator as feeling the desire to escape from his adult responsibilities back into childhood, and feeling resentment towards his mother who prevents him from doing so.Napier, Susan, Escape from the Wasteland:Romanticism and Realism in the Fiction of Mishima Yukio and Oe Kenzaburo, Harvard (1991), p. 169. The difficulty of the novel can be ascribed to a series of disruptive narrative techniques. Episodes are related out of order, repeated and altered in each re-telling. Oe also blurs the distinctions between the different characters, by the fluid use of pronouns and the omission of quotation marks.Wilson, Michiko, The Marginal World of Oe Kenzaburo: A Study in Themes and Techniques p. 71. M E Sharpe (1986). Oe uses the discussions between the narrator and the executor (towards the end, including contributions from the narrator's mother) to include criticism of the main narrative within the story. The executor asks about parts of the story omitted by the narrator, and suggests that he is hiding \\"unpleasant memories... creating the bloated feeling\\"The Day p. 67. Her comments also prompt observations from the narrator on his own story: when she questions his continual use of the term \\"a certain party\\" instead of \\"father\\", he responds that, \\"To make someone sound like an imaginary figure can be a way of debasing him, but it can also be a way of exalting him into a kind of idol\\". Michiko Wilson amplifies this latter point, arguing that this terminology furthers the identification of the father with the emperor, as he is traditionally not referred to by name.Wilson p. 71. The identification of the father with the emperor is only one of several archetypes which Wilson finds in the relationship between the father and the narrator: as well as emperor-subject, there are references to God-Christ and Don Quixote-Sancho Panza. Beyond the obvious satirical intent, she argues that these overlapping references are part of Oe's strategy of defamiliarisation, through which the reader is forced to look at events through fresh eyes.Wilson p. 76. Another element of this strategy is the use of counter-intuitive contrasting pairs within the family: the small boy looks after his obese father; the mother tries to save her stepson, while the father tries to kill him; the son hates his mother, and (in the narrator's view) vice versa.Wilson p. 74. Napier argues that the satirical aspect of the work is not completely effective. She notes the difficulty of having one narrator recount both his own romantic delusion and the sordid reality which undermines it, and comments that, \\"by having one narrative voice encapsulating both, [Oe] creates an ambivalent final impression\\".Napier pp. 161, 171.

It is one of a cycle of paintings on mythological subjects produced for Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, for the Camerino d'Alabastro ‚Äì a private room in his palazzo in Ferrara decorated with paintings based on classical texts. An advance payment was given to Raphael, who originally held the commission for the subject of a Triumph of Bacchus. At the time of Raphael's death in 1520, only a preliminary drawing was completed and the commission was then handed to Titian. In the case of Bacchus and Ariadne, the subject matter was derived from the Roman poets Catullus and Ovid. The painting, considered one of Titian's greatest works, now hangs in the National Gallery in London. The other major paintings in the cycle are The Feast of the Gods (mostly by Giovanni Bellini, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C), and Titian's The Bacchanal of the Andrians and The Worship of Venus (both now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid). Description Ariadne has been left on the island of Naxos, deserted by her lover Theseus, whose ship sails away to the far left. She is discovered on the shore by the god Bacchus, leading a procession of revelers in a chariot drawn by two cheetahs (these were probably modelled on those in the Duke's menagerie and were tigers in Ovid's original textP. Ovidius Naso, Ars Amatoria, Book I, Perseus Catalog). Bacchus is depicted in mid-air as he leaps out of the chariot to protect Ariadne from these beasts. In the sky above the figure of Ariadne is the star constellation Corona Borealis (Northern crown). There are two possible variations of the story both going back to Ovid. In his Metamorphoses,Ovid, Metamorphoses, translated by A. S. Kline, Book VIII:bv152‚Äì182 The Minotaur, Theseus, and Ariadne Ovid has Bacchus throw the crown of Ariadne into the sky where it becomes the constellation Northern Crown. In Ars Amatoria, Bacchus promises the entire sky to Ariadne where she then would become the constellation Northern Crown. The National Gallery's website states that in the painting, \\"Bacchus, god of wine, emerges with his followers from the landscape to the right. Falling in love with Ariadne on first sight, he leaps from his chariot, drawn by two cheetahs, towards her. Ariadne had been abandoned on the Greek island of Naxos by Theseus, whose ship is shown in the distance. The picture shows her initial fear of Bacchus, but he raised her to heaven and turned her into a constellation, represented by the stars above her head.\\" The composition is divided diagonally into two triangles, one of blue sky (using the expensive ultramarine pigment) and still but for the two lovers caught in movement, the other a riot of movement and predominantly green/brown in colour. The follower of Bacchus who struggles with a snake is sometimes falsely associated with the antique sculpture of Laoco√∂n and His Sons who had been killed by snakes. This statue had recently been discovered in Rome. But the satyr in Titian's painting is not in a mortal combat with the snakes, he is merely girding himself with them as is described in the original text by Catullus.Catullus, The Wedding of Peleus and Thetis, 250‚Äì265, Translated by Thomas Bank The King Charles Spaniel that barks at the boy satyr is a common motif in Titian's work and was probably a court pet. The gold urn inscribed with the artist's signature (TICIANVS) may also have been familiar to the Duke as one of the antiquities in his collection. The analysis of pigments used by Titian in this painting has been undertaken by scientists at the National Gallery in LondonLucas, A., Plesters, J. \\"Titian's 'Bacchus and Ariadne. National Gallery Technical Bulletin Vol. 2, pp. 25‚Äì47 and this analysis is illustrated at ColourLex.\\"Titian, Bacchus and Ariadne, Pigment Analysis\\" Restoration The canvas on which Bacchus and Ariadne is painted was rolled up twice in the first century of its existence, which had consequences for the painting. From the turn of the 19th century onwards it was frequently being restored to stop paint from flaking off, with the most controversial restoration being that carried out at the National Gallery between 1967 and 1968. This greatly brightened the surface of the painting, and came as something of a shock to many viewers, used to a heavy varnish finish. When discoloured varnish lying directly on top of the paint surface was removed, some of the paint itself came off as well and repainting was necessary. This has caused some critics to note that the expanse of blue sky on the left-hand side, one of the worst-affected areas of the painting, appears flat and pallid. It has also been argued that the removal of the varnish has left the painting tonally out of balance, since Titian is likely to have added some subtle glazes to the paint surface in order to tone down some of the more jarring colors. The National Gallery maintains that this was an unavoidable loss, because the accrued layers of later varnish had turned the painting brown and sludgy and had to be removed. More recent examination has confirmed that the paint remains largely original.Lucas, A., Plesters, J. 'Titian's \\"Bacchus and Ariadne\\"'. National Gallery Technical Bulletin Vol 2, pp 25‚Äì47. PDF Other paintings There are many other paintings of the subject in museum collections, including the following: *Giovan Battista Pittoni (1720‚Äì25), in the Louvre *Guido Reni (Los Angeles) *Ferdinand Bol, Hermitage Museum *Eustache Le Sueur, Boston MFA *Sebastiano Ricci, Chiswick House *Jacopo Tintoretto, Bacchus, Venus and Ariadne, Doge's Palace, Venice References in other media John Keats alluded to this painting (which was brought to England in 1806) in his \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\" (\\"Away! away! for I will fly to thee, Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards\\") and in Lamia (\\"Upon her crest she wore a wannish fire/Sprinkled with stars, like Ariadne's tiar\\"). Letitia Elizabeth Landon reviews this work in her poem Bacchus and Ariadne, first published in 1822, as a Dramatic Scene, being a dialogue between Leonardi and Alvine.

The program was made from segments and sketches taken from the first 20 years of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962-1982). Johnny Carson's full tenure on the program, which originally aired on the NBC Television Network, was from 1962 to 1992. The series is narrated by Ed McMahon, who, as a voiceover, introduces the program and each of the segments. The series was one of the results of Carson coming to terms with NBC on a contract extension in 1981. In exchange for his continued services, Carson received ownership of the show, including the rights to the entire extant archive of his hosting span. Carson's Comedy Classics was one of the most immediate ways Carson cashed in on his product; he and his staff created a clip show consisting of highlights from the 20 years of The Tonight Show Carson had hosted up to that point and sold the rights to Columbia Pictures Television for $26 million.Bushkin, Henry. How Johnny Carson Nearly Quit 'Tonight' and Scored TV's Richest Deal Ever. The Hollywood Reporter. Retrieved September 4, 2014. When Carson would have his annual Tonight Show Anniversary Show in prime time on NBC, the anniversary shows were mainly flashback clip shows, and it was usually the same vintage sketches which got the showcase on the shows (examples being Ed Ames' classic miffed tomahawk throw from 1965, Carson and Jack Webb doing a sketch about Copper Clappers from 1968, and John Twomey playing \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\" with his hands from 1974; later anniversary shows would feature stand-up comedians, new sketches and clips from the previous year of Tonight Shows). The popularity of the anniversary shows helped lead to the creation of Carson's Comedy Classics, which is essentially a classic clip show edited down to a half an hour. Carson's Comedy Classics showed that there were many other classic sketches and segments that had rarely if ever been seen between the original airing and 1982-1983 (when the show was put into production). Many of the sketches and segments in Carson's Comedy Classics have never been released on DVD either. Each segment was carefully edited to avoid any reference to \\"The Tonight Show\\" or \\"NBC\\" (as NBC was, then as now, the owner of the Tonight Show trademark). Recurring segments were classic Carnac the Magnificent, Aunt Blabby, Floyd R. Turbo, Stump The Band, Tea Time Movie and other sketches as well as vintage and memorable bits with animal trainers Jim Fowler and Joan Embery and the animals they brought on The Tonight Show. There are also moments where there are segments where Carson would do an activity, like learning karate (he broke a plywood board with his head on one episode), gymnastics, or volleyball, and even trying to start a campfire in a race to do so spearheaded by some Boy Scouts. Many clips also showcase celebrities with Carson, usually in sketches; George C. Scott, Juliet Prowse, Bob Hope and Don Rickles among others. The Tonight Show stock regulars who were unknowns but may have had a few lines here and there in certain sketches were referred to as The Carson Comedy Players in the opening credits of Carson's Comedy Classics (longtime Tonight Show stalwart Carol Wayne also appears in many Tea Time Movie sketches). And of course, Ed McMahon, who was Carson's sidekick and announcer, and stayed with Johnny for Carson's entire Tonight Show run (1962-1992), is prominently featured in Carson's Comedy Classics. McMahon also narrates the opening credits on the program as well. Final credits in each episode give mention to the staff of The Tonight Show and the producers and staff of Carson's Comedy Classics separately. The programs themselves have no real running order to them, and thus could be broadcast in any order chosen by the station, usually late in the evening. The program was produced and directed by Kenneth J. Koerner for Carson Productions and syndicated by Columbia Pictures Television. Other appearances Family Channel aired reruns of the show during its late- afternoon/early-evening and midnight time slots from October 1, 1996 until September 27, 1997. Family Channel censored certain segments that contained racial, sexually lewd or \\"gay\\" jokes. This would often be noticeable when scenes \\"flip\\". This would happen mostly during the 'Carnac' segments when certain questions or \\"curses\\" would be censored by Family Channel. In Australia, the show aired on the Nine Network throughout the 1980s and 1990s in various timeslots. Since then, reruns have aired on FOX Classics. In 2008, the Chicago-based TV station Me-Too (WMEU-CA) began to air the show late at night. As of January 1, 2009, the station no longer airs the show. Since the summer of 2009, ReelzChannel has aired reruns of the show in the 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM ET Monday through Friday morning block. Reruns have also aired on Comcast's Video on Demand. Pop culture In The Simpsons episode \\"Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious,\\" Krusty the Clown hosted a similarly named program, the Krusty Komedy Klassic, live at the Apollo Theater. He is promptly booed by the audience for having the show's initials, KKK, prominently displayed on the stage.

Playing as a winger, he scored 25 goals from 182 appearances in the Football League either side of the Second World War, and was on the winning side for Arsenal in the 1950 FA Cup Final. He then spent 14 years as a manager at Football League level. During the war, he served as a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Life and career Cox was born in Reading, Berkshire. He played for St George's Lads Club before joining Tottenham Hotspur as a youngster. Cox took his first steps in senior football with Spurs' nursery club, the Kent-based Northfleet United, in 1936, before turning professional with Tottenham in August 1938. A tricky and talented winger who usually played on the right, he made his first-team debut in a Second Division match against Swansea Town in November 1938, scoring Spurs' goal in a 1‚Äì1 draw. However, soon after he broke into the first team, the Second World War broke out and all competitive football was suspended. Cox served as a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. In his spare time he made guest appearances for his hometown club, Reading, and for Swindon Town. After the war, Cox returned to Spurs for another three seasons, taking his totals to 18 goals from 105 appearances in Football League and FA Cup. He then moved to their north London rivals, Arsenal, for ¬£12,000 in September 1949. Cox made his Arsenal debut straight away, on 7 September 1949 against West Bromwich Albion, and became an immediate regular in the side. His efforts were most evident in the FA Cup. In the semi-final, against Chelsea, Cox scored the first goal in a 2‚Äì2 draw, and went on to score the only goal in Arsenal's 1‚Äì0 victory in the replay. In the final, against Liverpool, he laid on a cross for Reg Lewis to score the only goal of the match, winning the Cup for Arsenal. Two years later, Arsenal again played Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals, and again Cox proved crucialhe scored Arsenal's goal in a 1‚Äì1 draw, and in the replay he scored twice and set up a third as Arsenal ran out 3‚Äì0 winners. However, the 1952 final was not to be a repeat of two years earlier; against Newcastle United, an injury-ravaged Arsenal side played most of the match with ten men after Walley Barnes was stretchered off, and lost 1‚Äì0. Despite his cup exploits, Cox was never an ever-present in the Arsenal side; he first faced competition from Ian McPherson for the right-wing spot, and then from the talented youngster Arthur Milton. After only appearing in nine matches in the 1952‚Äì53 season, in which Arsenal won the First Division title, he sought pastures new and was transferred to West Bromwich Albion as player-coach. In all he played 94 matches for Arsenal in League and Cup, scoring 16 goals. Cox only played four matches for West Brom, and at the end of the 1953‚Äì54 season was appointed as team coach by manager Vic Buckingham. In 1956 he moved on to Third Division South club Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic to become manager. Bournemouth fared reasonably steadily in the league, and pulled off a giant-killing feat in beating Wolverhampton Wanderers and Spurs in the 1956‚Äì57 FA Cup to reach the sixth round, in which they lost to Manchester United. In 1958 he moved along the coast to become Portsmouth's manager; here he was less successful as Portsmouth were relegated from the First Division in his first season, and Cox was sacked in February 1961. After a spell out of football while he established his newsagents' business, Cox took up the reins at Fourth Division Gillingham in 1962. He had an immediate impact, taking a side that had finished 20th the previous season up to 5th place, missing out on promotion on goal average. Cox's Gillingham team became renowned for their defensive discipline and unadventurous style, and the following season, 1963‚Äì64, they finished top and won promotion to the Third Division. The next season they started well and looked set to win a second successive promotion before slumping late on and finishing seventh. Cox resigned just before Christmas 1965 and rejoined his old club Bournemouth, who were also in the Third Division. After finishing as high as fourth in 1968‚Äì69, Bournemouth were relegated in 1969‚Äì70 after Gillingham won on the last day of the season, condemning the Cherries to the drop instead. Cox was sacked that summer and never worked in football again. Cox died in Bournemouth in 1973 at the age of 52.

It sits at the edge of the parish graveyard just west of Main Street. The castle is a State Care Historic Monument sited in the townland of Castle Balfour Demesne, in the Fermanagh and Omagh district area, at grid ref: H3622 3369. History Castle-skeagh was granted to Michael Balfour, Lord Balfour of Burleigh from Fife, Scotland, by King James I in the Plantation of Ulster. He sold his lands in Fermanagh to his younger brother James, Lord Balfour of Glenawley in 1615. In 1618/19 Captain Nicholas Pynnar reported that Balfour had begun his building at Castle-skeagh. The village of Lisnaskea developed around it. The castle was altered in 1652 and damaged in 1689. The last person to possess and inhabit the Castle was James Haire (1737-1833) who leased the castle from John Creighton, Earl Erne. James Haire and his family ceased to occupy the castle after it was destroyed by an arson-based fire in 1803. His mother, Phoebe Haire, was killed by the fire. It is believed that the perpetrator of the fire was a member of the Maguire clan. Major conservation and restoration was undertaken in the 1960s and further conservation work was completed in the late 1990s. Evidence of an earlier ringfort indicates the area had been inhabited from very early times. In Castle Balfour Demesne, slight surface evidence for a fosse between two banks was revealed after excavation to have been 2m deep. Attempts to find the outer fosse of a bivallate ringfort revealed ‚Äòno distinct, steep edges‚Äô contrasting with the steeply cut inner fosse. Radiocarbon dates of 359-428 AD were found from the ringfort at Castle Balfour. Features In 1618/19 Captain Nicholas Pynnar reported that Balfour had 'laid the foundation of a bawne of lime and stone 70 ft square, of which the two sides are raised 15 ft high. There is also a castle of the same length, of which the one half is built two stories high and is to be three stories and a half high‚Äô. Castle Balfour was a long, rectangular three storey building, on a north-south axis, the main block being 26m by 8m. It had a square wing to the east and west and a later rectangular block on the northern end. It has the style of a Scottish castle and the building is thought to be the work of Lowland Scots masons. The surviving castle is in a T plan with an entrance with gun-loops. The castle has vaulted rooms and a kitchen with fireplace and oven on the ground floor, main dwelling rooms on the first floor and corbelled turrets with gun slits.

It is even frequently played during non-American movie ceremonies, e.g. the French C√©sar Awards. The popularity of the song is notably due to the lyrics by Johnny Mercer, which reference the American movie industry and satirize the illusory desire of many people to become famous as actors.  Composition  The music was composed by Richard A. Whiting. In the original movie it was sung by Johnnie Davis and Frances Langford, accompanied by Benny Goodman and his orchestra. Lyrics can be difficult to fully understand today, as they refer to people (e.g. Aimee Semple) or cultural elements (e.g. rotos) which have since been forgotten. The lyrics have also evolved over the years. Notably, the line \\"where any shopgirl can be a top girl, if she pleases the tired businessman\\" vanished quite quickly, and is absent from the 1958 Doris Day version, having been replaced with \\"and any barmaid can be a star made if she dances with or without a fan\\" The latter part of the line refers to Sally Rand and her fan dance. Today the song is performed mostly as a melody.  Usage  * The melody was used on the Jack Benny radio show as the final theme song. * The song is played over the opening and closing shots of Robert Altman's film The Long Goodbye (1973) starring Elliott Gould as Philip Marlowe. *In 1977, the song was performed twice during an episode of The Brady Bunch Variety Hour.

The List The list caused controversy as a small number of recipients were wealthy businessmen whose principles were considered antipathetic to those held by the Labour Party. One businessman on the list, Lord Kagan, was convicted of fraud in 1980; Sir Eric Miller, committed suicide while under investigation for fraud in 1977. Another beneficiary was the buccaneering financier James Goldsmith. Other names on the list such as actor John Mills were, however, uncontroversial. Despite the notoriety of the name, Wilson's biographers, Professor Ben Pimlott and Philip Ziegler, both stress there was never any question at the time or subsequently of financial impropriety in the drawing up of the list. The origin of the name was the claim made by Joe Haines that the head of Wilson's political office, Marcia Williams, had written the original draft on lavender-coloured notepaper. No documentary evidence has been proffered to support this claim and Wilson and Williams denied it. Docudrama The docudrama was written by journalist Francis Wheen, deputy editor of the satirical magazine Private Eye. Wheen said that it was based on the political diaries of two members of Wilson's kitchen cabinet, press secretary Joe Haines and director of policy Bernard Donoughue. It starred Kenneth Cranham as Wilson and Gina McKee as Williams. The production received a good review from Victor Lewis-Smith of the London Evening Standard. Most reviews were critical and it even received criticism from some of the protagonists with regard to its handling of events. Haines noted what he considered 54 inaccuracies in the production.The truth about Wilson's 'lavender list' ‚Äì Telegraph The BBC paid Lady Falkender ¬£75,000 in damages over this drama documentary for claiming that she conducted an adulterous affair with Harold Wilson and exercised undue influence over the compilation of his resignation honours list.

It is spoken by the Paumari Indians, who call their language ‚ÄúPamoari‚Äù. The word ‚ÄúPamoari‚Äù has several different meanings in the Paumar√≠ language: ‚Äòman,‚Äô ‚Äòpeople,‚Äô ‚Äòhuman being,‚Äô and ‚Äòclient.‚Äô These multiple meanings stem from their different relationships with outsiders; presumably it means ‚Äòhuman being‚Äô when they refer to themselves to someone of ostensibly equal status, and ‚Äòclient‚Äô when referring to their people among river traders and Portuguese speakers. Speakers of Arawan languages, particularly Paumar√≠ (who have had the most contact with non-natives) are beginning to speak Portuguese. The result, for many of the speakers in Paumar√≠, is a hybrid of Portuguese and Paumar√≠, incorporating vocabulary from both languages while retaining the syntax of neither (Chapman, a researcher from the Summer Institute of Linguistics, claims that, at the time of her arrival in 1964, all Paumar√≠ spoke a mixture of Paumar√≠ and Portuguese). Out of the Paumar√≠ group that inhabits the Tapau√° River, the youth, which makes up nearly a majority of the population, spoke only Portuguese in 1964. This ‚Äòlinguistic Creole‚Äô tendency in the Paumar√≠ language highlights exactly why languages such as Paumar√≠ are endangered. It is a largely head-marking language with unmarked VOS order and an ergative alignment for marking of nouns combined with accusative marking of pronouns. Paumar√≠ has only two open word classes - nouns and verbs. However, it also has numerous closed classes including fourteen adjectives, adpositions, interjections, conjunctions and demonstratives. Paumar√≠ nouns are elaborately divided into over one hundred possessed nouns and a larger number of free nouns. Furthermore, each free noun has grammatical gender - being either masculine or feminine, with feminine being the unmarked gender and indicated by the suffix -ni. Verb roots have up to fifteen suffix positions, but all are only optionally filled. Most of these refer to location or aspect, plus a negative suffix -ra. Phonology Paumar√≠ has a larger consonant inventory than most languages of the Amazon Basin, and is notable for featuring bilabial and coronal implosives, which have been lost from other Arauan languages but are reconstructed clearly for the protolanguage of the family. It is one of very few languages in the New World to contrast implosives with other voiced stop consonants: similar contrasts are known only for a few other Amazonian languages. However, it has a very simple vowel system with only three contrastive vowels, the back one of which can range from to .

This is consistent among all Arawan languages (Dixon (1999), 295). Often two vowels will occur in a sequence, CVV, however, the length of the resulting syllable will often make a phonetic difference between the two vowels, and the syllable‚Äôs duration will correspond to the amount of vowels, reflecting a moraic structure also common in Japanese. Often in the Paumar√≠ language, when an identical vowel occurs word-final and then word-initial in two sequential words, one of the two vowels will be dropped within the phrase. Syntax Paumar√≠ tends to be a head-final language. Typically, in intransitive phrases (those without direct objects) the order is VS. The SV intransitive order also occurs, although only when the Subject is marked for informational prominence (the demonstrative (DEM) is occluded in such SV phrases). In transitive phrases, the word order is mainly SVO, in which the ergative case marking system tends to be used. The affix used for ergative marking is the suffix ‚Äú-a‚Äù, and the object of the sentence is preceded by a word denoting a demonstrative case. These demonstrative case nouns are either ‚Äúada‚Äù for male, or ‚Äúida‚Äù for female. The gender and number of the object noun, not the subject, dictates the gender and number suffixes on the verb . Two other word orders that occur in Paumar√≠ transitive phrases are OVS and SOV. In these cases, the object is marked with a suffix denoting it as such (-ra) and is placed directly before the verb. In these cases, it is thought that the accusative system has taken over, as the subject of the sentence no longer receives the ergative suffix ‚Äò-a‚Äô and is free to occur at the beginning or end of the phrase (but not directly before the verb). This shows the split ergativity evident in Paumar√≠ language ‚Äì they employ the ergative system for some word orders and the accusative system for others. Adjectives always follow the noun that they describe and if there is also a number in the clause, it follows the adjective (‚ÄúThree big dogs‚Äù becomes ‚Äúdogs big three‚Äù). The Paumar√≠ language has very few words that act as adverbs, but several ways of changing other words into adverbs via affixes. Adverbs do not modify adjectives in the Paumar√≠ language. Morphology Paumar√≠ is primarily an agglutinative language, and primarily suffixing, although many prefixes are also used. Prefixes on verbs are usually reserved for obligatory pronoun incorporation, whereas verb suffixes denote many different things. There exist affixes, mainly suffixes, to denote gender, number, and noun classes in verbs. Paumar√≠ nouns are intrinsically categorized in two independent systems: gender and another system of two noun classes. There are two genders: masculine and feminine. If possible, gender assignment of a noun based on the referent's biological sex, and a few other generalizations can be made, but for the most part gender assignment is semantically opaque. Gender is not represented on the noun itself, but manifests in affixes that verbs, demonstratives, certain adjectives, and possessed nouns take to indicate agreement. Because first and second person pronouns take feminine agreement, it appears that feminine is the unmarked gender. In a transitive verb phrase, the verb agrees in gender with whichever of the agent or the object is the pivot of the discourse. In either case, the verb takes the suffix -hi for feminine agreement and -ha for masculine agreement: The two classes in the other system of noun classes are called ka- class and non-ka-class, because the ka- class nouns cause certain other words to signal agreement with the prefix ka-. The semantic basis for assigning different nouns to these two classes is slightly less opaque than for gender: no abstract nouns are in the ka- class, and whether a concrete noun is in the ka- class roughly corresponds to whether its referent is large and flat, with certain semantic categories admitting other generalizations. A verb must take the prefix ka- if a particular argument is a ka-class noun; if the verb is in an intransitive clause that argument is the subject, whereas if it is in a transitive clause that argument is the object. Aside from verb- argument agreement, noun class agreement also occurs for modifying stative verbs, possessed nouns, and certain adjectives. This system of classifying nouns is eroding in the face of contact with Portuguese, with the agreement prefix often being left off of verbs in rapid speech. Portuguese contact There are some portions of the Paumar√≠ language that have been irreversibly changed by Portuguese influence. For example, Paumar√≠ use Portuguese narrative words such as dai (\\"from there\\") and ent√£o (\\"then\\") often in their speech. Also, Paumar√≠ have difficulty expressing equality/inequality within their own language. At the time of the 1964 SIL arrival, they used the Portuguese word mais (\\"more\\") in conjunction with adjectives to compare things and the researchers could not find anything in native Paumar√≠ tongue that served the same function in their language. Often, root duplication serves as a way for the Paumar√≠ to express that something is less like or becoming or trending towards another thing. This is an odd use of reduplication, as in many other languages, reduplication serves to strengthen the word; make it more immediate or intense. For adjectives, often the suffix ‚Äìki will be added to tag the word as descriptive. Reduplication of adjective roots denotes less of the description. Stress accent system Dan Everett of the University of North Dakota has extensively studied the accent/stress system of the Paumar√≠ and has claimed that the Paumar√≠‚Äôs accent system violates some of the most basic theories put forward by linguists with regards to stress systems. Paumar√≠ has iambic feet, which means the accent tends towards the right, or latter, portion of the word or syllable set, and they are not weight-sensitive. Everett theorizes that stress placement and syllables in the Paumar√≠ language are more exclusive from one another than many modern theories believe. Two types of accents are distinguished in Paumar√≠, primary stress and secondary stress. Primary stress is characterized by a sharp increase in intensity (volume) and by somewhat higher pitch, although the latter is difficult for non-speakers to distinguish and was found by digital analysis of sound wave of native speakers. Secondary stress in Paumar√≠ is characterized by a slight increase in intensity and often an increase in syllable duration. The final syllable of a word always has one of the two of these and therefore is always somewhat stressed. The stress system starts at the final syllable and works its way to the left, or the beginning of the word, skipping every other syllable. In disyllabic words, the primary stress is placed on the final syllable. In polysyllabic words, the primary stress is assigned to the antepenult (third from last) syllable, and the last syllable is assigned secondary stress. If the polysyllabic word is five syllables or more, every odd syllable (leftward) from the antepenult syllable is also assigned secondary stress. Therefore, regardless of how many syllables a word has, the primary stress is always on the last or antepenult syllable. The beginning syllable for a word will only have primary stress if it is a three-syllable word, and will have secondary stress only if it contains an odd-number (5, 7, 9, etc.) of syllables.

He plays as a half back flanker or midfielder and began his football career at Murray Bushrangers in the TAC Cup. He was the captain of Fremantle during the 2016 season. Fremantle career Mundy was drafted by Fremantle at selection 19 at the 2003 AFL Draft. This selection was traded to Fremantle by the Western Bulldogs in return for Steven Koops. Upon moving to WA in 2004 he was allocated to the Subiaco Football Club in the West Australian Football League (WAFL). Mundy playing for Fremantle in May 2014 He spent the entire 2004 season playing with Subiaco and was a part of their premiership team. Impressive WAFL form continued into 2005 and he was selected by Fremantle to make his AFL debut at the MCG against Melbourne in Round 6. His poise and composure in defence saw Mundy maintain his position in the side for all 17 remaining games for the season. In round 14 he was recognised by the AFL by being nominated for the AFL Rising Star award. In the final voting, he came 3rd behind Brett Deledio and Ryan Griffen with 15 votes. He also was awarded the 2005 Beacon Award as the best young talent on the Fremantle list. Mundy started the 2008 season in good form, and was shifted to a midfield role late in the season in order to use his kicking ability.Schmook, Nathan (14 February 2009) Midfield role for Mundy as Freo finds a leader In 2009, he played his 100th game and was only the eighth player in league history to play them consecutively from debut.Milestone fair reward for Docker Mundy He played 124 consecutive games from his debut until he was a late withdrawal due to stomach cramps before the Round 17, 2010 match against the Western Bulldogs. 2010 was his best season to date, and he was recognised by being named in the 40-man squad for the 2010 All-Australian teamAll-Australian team to have up to 17 first-time players and also won the Doig Medal as Fremantle's best player for the year.It's David's Doig At the end of the 2010 season, there was much speculation that Mundy would not renew his contract with Fremantle and would instead either return to play in Melbourne, or be recruited by the new Gold Coast Football Club.David Mundy counts down to big call However, he rejected all other offers and re-signed with Fremantle in September 2010 for an additional four years. He then later re-signed at the end of 2014 for another 3 years. He extended his contract for a further year early in the 2017 season. A highlight in 2015 was during the Round 17 clash with Richmond Football Club at the MCG. In the final minutes of the game, a Richmond kick out after a Fremantle behind was marked by Garrick Ibbotson who passed to Mundy approximately 45 metres out from goal. Mundy kicked a goal with 40 seconds left, leading Fremantle to a 4-point victory. He would repeat a very similar play again against Richmond at the MCG in 2017, when he marked the ball 25m out from goal with 11 seconds remaining in the game. He kicked the goal after the siren and gave Fremantle the win by 2 points. In 2016, he was named the captain of Fremantle, however, the team headed into one of their worst seasons to date, with only four wins that year. In 2017, the captaincy was passed to Nathan Fyfe. Mundy was the second Fremantle player to reach 300 games, after Matthew Pavlich. His 300th game was a win at Optus Stadium in April 2019.

It is often called pasta fasul (fazool) in the United States, derived from its Neapolitan name, pasta e fasule. Like many other Italian favorites, including pizza and polenta, it started as a peasant dish, being composed of inexpensive ingredients. Preparation Recipes for pasta e fagioli vary, the only true requirement being that beans and pasta are included. While dish varies from region to region, it is most commonly made using cannellini beans, Great Northern beans, or borlotti beans and a small variety of pasta such as elbow macaroni or ditalini. The base typically includes olive oil, garlic, minced onion, celery, carrots, and often stewed tomatoes or tomato paste. Some variations omit tomatoes and instead use a broth base. Preparation may be vegetarian, or contain meat (often bacon, ground beef, or pancetta) or a meat- based stock. Variations Pasta e fagioli The recipe varies greatly based on the region or town in which it is prepared, depending on available ingredients. The consistency of the dish can vary, with some being soupy, while others are much thicker. For instance, in Bari the dish is thicker in consistency and uses mixed pasta shapes. It also uses pancetta in the base of the sauce. Other varieties call for the beans to be passed through a food mill, giving it a stew-like consistency. The word for \\"beans\\" varies in different languages of Italy, e.g. in standard Italian, in Neapolitan, and in Sicilian. In popular culture \\"Pastafazoola\\", a 1927 novelty song by Van and Schenck, capitalizes on the Neapolitan pronunciation in the rhyme, \\"Don't be a fool, eat pasta fazool.\\" The song \\"That's Amore\\", by Warren and Brooks (popularized by Dean Martin), includes the rhyme \\"When the stars make you drool, just like pasta fazool, that's amore\\".

Their debut single, \\"The First Picture of You\\", became a hit in the UK and in continental Europe, notably France, Italy, Belgium and Spain. History Formation and success In September 1982, Peter Coyle and Jeremy \\"Jem\\" Kelly met for the first time. Kelly had been guitarist in the Dance Party with Michael Head and co-founded the Wild Swans in 1980. Coyle had previously been in the Jass Babies, who had recorded a session for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show in 1981. After an invitation to record a Peel session, a number of new songs were created. Joined on keyboards by Kelly's fellow ex-Wild Swans member Ged Quinn, drummer Alan Wills and bassist Phil Lucking, the session was recorded in October 1982 and included \\"The First Picture of You\\". This led to the band being signed by Arista Records. Produced by Nigel Gray, \\"The First Picture of You\\" became an iconic song for the Lotus Eaters in 1983, giving them a UK hit single before the band had even played a live gig. The band recorded a second session for Peel in October 1983. The band's debut studio album, No Sense of Sin, was released in 1984 on Arista subsidiary Sylvan Records, preceded by two further singles, \\"You Don't Need Someone New\\" and \\"Out on Your Own\\". Both of these songs hit the top 100 of the UK Singles Chart, but owing to difficulties with producers and marketing, the impact of \\"The First Picture of You\\" was not repeated in the UK.  Line-up changes and disbandment  After Quinn left, Coyle and Kelly recruited bassist Michael Dempsey (the Cure, Associates), keyboard player Stephen Emmer (formerly of Minny Pops and Associates) and drummer Steve Crease. The Lotus Eaters toured extensively in the UK, France and Italy before going on hiatus in 1985 after parting ways with Arista. \\"It Hurts\\", their final single, charted in the Italian Top 5 that year, but the band had already split up, leaving a promotional video featuring footage of Louise Brooks to represent them.  Aftermath  Coyle recorded as a solo artist, releasing the albums A Slap in the Face for Public Taste and I'd Sacrifice Eight Orgasms with Shirley MacLaine Just to Be There, and went on to found dance company 8 Productions and the G-Love nightclub. As a songwriter/producer, he had success with Marina Van-Rooy's 1990 single \\"Sly One\\", and worked with a host of emerging artists on Liverpool's dance scene. Coyle later pursued academic interests at the University of Edinburgh. Meanwhile, Kelly reformed the Wild Swans, releasing the Bringing Home the Ashes album on Sire in 1988. He co-wrote an album, Soul Fire (released in 2001), with Tom Hingley (ex-Inspiral Carpets), before leaving to study for a PhD in memory-themed multimedia theatre at the University of Reading. Since 1989, Kelly has been writing, staging and performing in music-driven theatre, including Phantoms of the Aperture Part 1: Ted (2015) and Phantoms of the Aperture Part 2: Pictures of Me (2016) examining intersections of time, space, memory and music. A compilation album of the Lotus Eaters' music, First Picture of You, was released in 1998 by Vinyl Japan/BBC Worldwide, consisting of sessions recorded at BBC Radio 1. No Sense of Sin was reissued that same year by Arista Japan.  Reunion  In 2001, the Lotus Eaters, comprising the duo of Coyle and Kelly, reformed after almost two decades, recording and releasing a new album titled Silentspace on the Vinyl Japan label. On 13 March 2009, the band announced a one-off concert to be held at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall on 25 July. The gig, a performance of the album No Sense of Sin, featured Coyle, Kelly and Emmer accompanied by a string quartet from the University of Huddersfield. In April 2009, Coyle and Kelly collaborated with Emmer, and announced that they were working with producer Steve Power on material for a new album called A Plug-in Called Nostalgia, which has yet to be released. A limited-edition acoustic album, Differance, was issued the following year as a limited release on Sylvan. The Lotus Eaters played their first London show in 10 years at the Camden Barfly on 11 June 2010, followed by a string of shows in the UK. The band also toured in Japan in October 2010, with gigs in Tokyo and Osaka. In 2015, the band announced on their Facebook page that they were still working to release A Plug-in Called Nostalgia. In 2017, Coyle performed solo in a one- night-only show in Manila.

Somerset Maugham in 1935 and loosely based on the life story of John Ellingham Brooks. It was included in the 1940 collection of Maugham stories The Mixture as Before. Plot summary The story begins in 1913 with the narrator's visit to a friend on the island of Capri in Italy. The friend introduces the narrator to Thomas Wilson, who had come to the island for a holiday sixteen years earlier. A year after that holiday, Wilson had given up his job in London as a bank manager to live a life of simplicity and enjoyment in a small cottage on Capri. Enchanted by the island during his visit, he had made the decision during the intervening year to forgo working another twelve or thirteen years for his pension and instead to take his accumulated savings and purchase at once an annuity that would allow him to live simply on Capri for twenty-five years. And what will happen at the end of that twenty-five years, fifteen of which have already passed, asks the narrator; many men die by sixty, but many do not. Wilson does not directly answer the question, but he implies that if nature does not carry him off by the age of sixty, he will be content to dispatch himself, having lived a life of his own choosing in the meantime. The narrator of the story is stunned by such a bold plan, all the more because Wilson has the appearance and manner of an unremarkable, ordinary man ‚Äì very much that of the bank manager he once was. The narrator soon leaves Capri, and, what with the intervening world war and other events, nearly forgets his acquaintance with Wilson until thirteen years later, when he revisits his friend on Capri. By then, of course, the ten years that remained of Wilson's bargain with fate have expired. His friend describes for the narrator what has happened in his absence. Wilson, his annuity exhausted, had first sold all that he owned; then he had relied on his excellent credit to borrow sums of the islanders to sustain himself; but at the end of a year after the expiration of his annuity, he could no longer even borrow. Wilson then had shut himself in his cottage and lit a charcoal fire to fill the room with carbon monoxide in an attempt to kill himself. But he lacked the will, the narrator says, to make a good-enough job of the attempt, and survived, though with brain damage that left him mentally abnormal but not unbalanced enough for the asylum. He lives out the remainder of his years in the woodshed of his peasant former landlord, carrying water and feeding the animals. As the narrator and his friend walk along, the friend nearing the end of the tale, the friend warns him to betray no sign of his knowledge of Wilson's presence; the confused and degraded man is crouching nearby behind a tree, like a hunted animal. After six years of this existence, he is found dead on the ground overlooking the beautiful Faraglioni (coastal stacks) that had enticed him to the island so many years before ‚Äì slain perhaps, the narrator suggests, by their beauty. The narrator had told Wilson shortly after meeting him that his own choice would have been the safe one: to work the additional dozen or more years that would have secured his pension and, thus, a guarantee of enough money to live on, however long that might be, before setting out for his idyll on Capri, even though, as Wilson said, the pleasures of a man in his thirties are different from those of a man in his fifties. But it is not to Wilson's original choice that the narrator attributes the tragedy of Wilson's final years; he applauds Wilson for having had the nerve to make of his life what he wanted instead of following society's approved path. The narrator speculates that Wilson might indeed have had the kind of resolve needed to carry out his decision to end his own life, if necessary, at the time he first enacted his bold plan to leave his workaday life in London for the full-time leisure that, Wilson had argued, is all anyone is working for anyway. But the very ease and indolence of his life on Capri had deprived him of the will he needed to carry out his decision when the time came. Without challenge, the narrator argues, human will grows flabby, just as muscles used to support one only on level ground will lose the capacity to climb a mountain. The story's name is a reference to the Lotus eaters of Greek Mythology, who similarly had a life of indolence. See also * W.

The western parts of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (as of 1940) became part of the Reichskommissariat Ostland in 1941, but in 1943 the German authorities allowed local collaborators to set up a client state, the Belarusian Central Rada, that lasted until the Soviets liberated the region. Background invaded by the Soviet Union. All Polish cities annexed to the Belorussian SSR are renamed in Russian, and the size of the SSR is nearly doubled. The Soviet historiography believes that this map constitutes Belarus during World War II, not the eastern Kresy The Soviet and Belarusian historiographies study the subject of German occupation in the context of contemporary Belarus, regarded as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR), a constituent republic of the Soviet Union in the 1941 borders as a whole. Polish historiography insists on special, even separate treatment for the East Lands of the Poland in the 1921 borders (alias \\"Kresy Wschodnie\\" alias West Belarus), which were incorporated into the BSSR after the Soviet invaded Poland on 17 September 1939. More than 100,000 people of different ethnic backgrounds, mostly Poles and Jews in West Belarus, were imprisoned, executed or transported to the eastern USSR by Soviet authorities before the German invasion. The NKVD (Soviet secret police) killed more than 1,000 prisoners in June/July 1941, for example, in Chervyen, Hlybokaye and Vileyka. These crimes stoked anti- Communist feelings in the Belarusian population and were used by German anti- Semitic propaganda. Invasion After twenty months of Soviet rule in Western Belarus and Western Ukraine, Nazi Germany and its Axis allies invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. Eastern Belarus suffered particularly heavily during the fighting and German occupation. Following bloody encirclement battles, all of the present-day Belarus territory was occupied by the Germans by the end of August 1941. With Poland regarding the Soviet annexation as illegal, the majority of Polish citizens did not ask for Soviet citizenship from 1939 to 1941, and as a result were Polish citizens under Soviet and later German occupation. Occupation Soviet POWs captured near Minsk is marched west In the early days of the occupation, a powerful and increasingly well- coordinated Soviet partisan movement emerged. Hiding in the woods and swamps, the partisans inflicted heavy damage to German supply lines and communications, disrupting railway tracks, bridges, telegraph wires, attacking supply depots, fuel dumps and transports, and ambushing Axis soldiers. In one of the most successful partisan sabotage actions of the entire Second World War, the so-called Asipovichy diversion of 30 July 1943, four German trains with supplies and Tiger tanks were destroyed. To fight partisan activity, the Germans had to withdraw considerable forces behind their front line. On 22 June 1944, the huge Soviet Strategic Offensive Operation Bagration was launched, finally regaining all of Belarus by the end of August. War crimes Germany imposed a brutal regime, deporting some 380,000 people for slave labour, and killing hundreds of thousands of civilians more. The population was to be exterminated for German colonization. At least 5,295 Belarusian settlements were destroyed by the Nazis and some or all their inhabitants killed (out of 9,200 settlements that were burned or otherwise destroyed in Belarus during World War II). More than 600 villages like Khatyn were annihilated with their entire population. Altogether, over 1 million were killed in Belarus during the three years of German occupation. A 2017 study found \\"that Soviet partisan attacks against German personnel provoked reprisals against civilians but that attacks against railroads had the opposite effect. Where partisans focused on disrupting German supply lines rather than killing Germans, occupying forces conducted fewer reprisals, burned fewer houses, and killed fewer people.\\" Belarusian Central Rada, Minsk, June 1943.

The list of eradicated Jewish ghettos in Nazi-Soviet occupied Poland extending eastward toward the border with the Soviet Belarus can be found at the Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland article. Post- occupation Later in 1944, 30 German-trained Belarusians were airdropped behind the Soviet front line to spark disarray. These were known as \\"ƒåorny Kot\\" (\\"Black Cat\\") led by Micha≈Ç Vitu≈°ka. They had some initial success due to disorganization in the rear guard of Red Army. Other Belarusian units slipped through Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest and full scale guerilla war erupted in 1945. But the NKVD infiltrated these units and neutralized them until 1957. In total, Belarus lost a quarter of its pre-war population in the Second World War, including practically all its intellectual elite. About 9,200 villages and 1,200,000 houses were destroyed. The major towns of Minsk and Vitebsk lost over 80% of their buildings and city infrastructure. For the defense against the Germans, and the tenacity during the German occupation, the capital Minsk was awarded the title Hero City after the war. The fortress of Brest was awarded the title Hero-Fortress.

It is part of Glenbard Township High School District 87. East draws around 2,300 students from Lombard, and portions of Glendale Heights, Addison, and Bloomingdale. History Glenbard East High School opened in September 1959 with a student body of 525 students and 28 staff members. In the week prior to the school's opening, a tornado or microburst hit the school, causing significant damage. The east wall of the Tower section of the building was sucked out and fell through the roof of the then-unnamed auditorium. The classroom wing was unaffected, but the start of school was postponed for two weeks. When choosing team names during the first semester the school was open, the \\"Tornadoes\\" was one of three final choices; the other two were the \\"Apaches\\" and the winner, the \\"RAMS\\"‚Äîshown in caps as an acronym for Right Attitude Means Success.

The first principal was William Rider. The approximate enrollment for the 2008/2009 school year was 2700 students and 180 staff members. Prior to the opening of Glenbard East in 1959, Lombard students in High School District No. 87 attended Glenbard West High School (then Glenbard High School) in Glen Ellyn. In Glenbard East's first year, school activities and sports were contained in the Glenbard West yearbook, the Pinnacle, in a special section. The first Glenbard East yearbook was the 1961 edition, and named the Aries. The yearbook staff, Aries, works year-round to produce the Glenbard East High School yearbook. In its first few years, Glenbard East competed in the Interim Conference, comprising mostly newly built suburban schools. Other schools in the conference were Willowbrook High School in Villa Park, Niles West High School in Skokie, Morton West High School in Berwyn, among others. The school celebrated its 50th anniversary in October 2009, with a display of memorabilia and special recognition to athletes of 50 years during a halftime celebration during a home football game October 2. In 2011, The Washington Post named Glenbard East one of the top public high schools in Illinois. Male athletics Glenbard East competes in the Upstate Eight Conference (UEC).

Glenbard West is known for its historically strong academic performance. The town of Glen Ellyn is passionate about athletics and West sporting events are often packed with supportive fans. History The first high school that area students attended was Glen Ellyn High School, which served students from 1916 to 1922. These classes were held at the DuPage Bank Building. By 1920, classes were spread between the bank building and local church basements. The administrators decided to build a dedicated high school building. The district purchased a site on Honeysuckle Hill for the price of US$1 ($, accounting for inflation). The current building opened in 1922 as Glenbard Township High School, the first of the district's high schools. It was built in the style of a castle, complete with roof turrets. Facilities Glenbard, as it was originally named, was constructed in 1922 atop Honeysuckle Hill, overlooking Lake Ellyn. Built with dark red brick, the building was built with castle-like design, complete with a turret and other minor castle details. Glenbard West also has a tower known as the sixth floor. From the window of the sixth floor tower, the Willis (formerly Sears) Tower in downtown Chicago can be seen on a clear day. Athletics were initially played in a gymnasium, built in 1936, in the school building itself, but with the construction of a $12 million state of-the-art field house across the street, the former gym was turned into the Robert D. Elliott Library, named after one of the most influential principals in the school's history. Biester Gym was built in 1958. Across the road from Glenbard West is Bill Duchon Field, where football, boys' and girls' soccer, and track are played. Originally built in 1923, it was renamed in 1980 in honor of a head football coach who led West to several conference championships. The stadium seats up to 5,000 spectators, with the home side overlooking Lake Ellyn. In 2001, Duchon field was named by USA Today as one of the top 10 places to watch high school football. Additions to the school were added beginning in 1926. The auditorium was built in 1931, and the East Wing in 1953. Glenbard East was built in 1959 in Lombard, and the original school became Glenbard West. There was a complete renovation of the school during the 1964-1965 school year, adding new choral, band, and physical science facilities. The George Zahrobsky Botanical Garden, Shakespeare Garden and Poet‚Äôs Corner were added in later years. A new library and field house were completed in 2001, and the most recent additions, the science wings, were added in 2016. In media Bill Duchon Field was used to stage the football field scenes in the 1986 film Lucas,Fuentes, Gabe; HOLLYWOOD ON LOCATION AT GLENBARD WEST STUDENTS GET CLOSE-UP LOOK AT FILMMAKING; 25 June 1985; Chicago Tribune; accessed 30 July 2009 which featured rising stars such as Corey Haim, Charlie Sheen, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Winona Ryder, and Jeremy Piven. The school building was also used for shooting scenes. Glenbard West cheerleaders appeared as extras in the film, though the school colors and school name were changed. The 1991 television documentary Yearbook was also filmed here.L.L; \\"\\"Yearbook\\": The Real Thing\\"; 3 March 1991; Los Angeles Times; \\"Au contraire, say seniors at suburban Illinois' Glenbard West High School, who willingly bared their souls for Fox's new reality series \\"Yearbook.\\"\\"; accessed 29 July 2009 Rowland, Debran; \\"A teen drama in Glen Ellyn?

It is notable as the first recognized rock and roll recording to appear on the national American musical charts, peaking at #12 on the Billboard Juke Box chartPage 33 for the week ending June 20, 1953, and #11 for two weeks on the Cash Box chart beginning for the week of June 13. Some sources indicate that the recording -- a blend of R&B;, western and pop music -- is a contender for the title of \\"first rock'n'roll record. Others state that it was merely \\"the first rock and roll song to be a hit on the pop charts\\".Page 34 It was also said to be the first rock'n'roll recording to be played on national television in the United States (in an episode of Omnibus\\" in 1953). The use of a comma in the title varies from source to source, but is present on the original single release, which is credited to \\"Bill Haley with Haley's Comets,\\" an early variant of the band's name. History The song was written by Bill Haley. BMI: Crazy Man Crazy Haley said in a 1967 interview with Vancouver, British Columbia DJ Red Robinson that he got the idea for the song from hearing popular catchphrases used by teenagers at school dances where he and his band performed.A recording of this interview was released in 1981 on the LP Bill Haley and His Comets Interview (Great Northwest Records) and on CD as The Bill Haley Tapes (Jerden JRCD 7023), 1995 One of these phrases was \\"Crazy Man Crazy\\" while another was \\"Go, go, go, everybody!\\" (the latter also featured in a song called \\"Go Go Go\\" by The Treniers which music historian Jim Dawson suggests may have been an influence). Haley (and Marshall Lytle) incorporated both phrases into the song. He is said to have written it sitting at the kitchen table while his wife prepared lunch. The song was recorded at Coastal Studios in New York City and was released soon after by Essex Records. Personnel on the recording included Haley's core Comets members (Lytle, Billy Williamson (steel guitar), and Johnny Grande (piano)), plus session musicians Art Ryerson (lead guitar) and Billy Gussak (drums). Also participating on backing vocals were Dave Miller (owner of Essex Records and Haley's producer) and Jerry Blaine, co- founder of Jubilee Records, who happened to be visiting the studio. (Miller and Blaine were recruited because of the need to create a rowdy party-like sound during the song's chorus and conclusion.) On May 23, 1953, the song entered the American Billboard chart and reached No. 12, becoming the first song generally recognised as rock and roll to be a pop hit.Joel Whitburn, Top Pop Singles 1955-2002, p.297Song artist 90 - Bill Haley & his Comets. The record was the Top Debut on the Cashbox chart for the week of May 23, 1953, debuting at no. 19. This was also Haley's first national success and his first major success with an original song (prior to this he had had regional success with cover versions of \\"Rocket 88\\" and \\"Rock the Joint\\"). The recording was also a crossover hit, reaching no. 10 on the Billboard Territorial Best Sellers Chart for R&B; records in Chicago.Billboard, Top Rhythm & Blues Records, May 30, 1953, p. 46. A cover version released on Modern by R&B; guitarist Lucky Enois with his Quintet was also reviewed in the Rhythm & Blues Record Reviews section in the same issue as \\"full of infectious excitement\\" and a \\"loot catcher\\". Essex Records ran a full-page ad in the April 25, 1953 Billboard magazine stating that the single had sold \\"over 100,000 in 15 days\\".Billboard, April 25, 1953, page 63. A photo of Bill Haley, Marshall Lytle, Billy Williamson, and Johnny Grande accompanied the ad. The recording was released on Essex Records as Essex 321, E-321-A, backed with \\"What'cha Gonna Do\\" by Bill Haley with Haley's Comets and was published by Eastwick Music, BMI. The record was manufactured by the Palda Record Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 78 and 45 formats with an orange label. The recording was also released in the UK in August 1953, as London L 1190 as a 78 with \\"What'Cha Gonna Do\\" as the B side. 1953 sheet music cover, Eastwick Music Co., Philadelphia, PA. In the summer of 1953, \\"Crazy Man, Crazy\\" became the first rock and roll song to be heard on national television in the United States when it was used on the soundtrack of Glory in the Flower, an installment of the CBS anthology series, Omnibus.\\"Glory in the Flower\\". Omnibus, October 4, 1953. IMDB. This live production featured James Dean and was a predecessor to his later Rebel Without a Cause. The Paley Center for Media maintains a copy of this production in its archives. Bill Haley and the Comets performed the song in the 1954 Universal International movie short Roundup of Rhythm, which was the motion picture debut of the band in a musical short directed by Will Cowan that featured a D.J. and his female guest introducing the Comets.IMDB. Roundup of Rhythm (1954). This film is regarded as the first rock and roll movie feature predating The Blackboard Jungle (1955) and Rock Around the Clock (1956). The band also performed the song in the 1961 Mexican film Besito a Papa (1961) directed by Jos√© D√≠az Morales made by Cinematogr√°fica Filmex S.A. and released on September 14, 1961.IMDB. Besito a Papa (1951). The film starred Mexican actress Lola Beltran. Haley would later claim (for example in a 1972 interview with CFQC Radio in Saskatoon, Canada) that \\"Crazy Man, Crazy\\" sold a million copies, however no evidence to support this claim has been located.Original interview conducted circa August‚ÄìSeptember 1972, CFQC Radio, Saskatoon, Canada; rebroadcast 9 February 1981 from which the source recording was made; transcript of the interview can be found at the Rockabilly Hall of Fame website (accessed 5 July 2008) Haley and the Comets would record new versions of the song (without notable commercial success) in 1960 (Warner Bros. Records) and 1972 (Sonet Records), plus a live performance in 1969 (Buddah/Kama Sutra Records). A 45 single was released on Radio Active Gold distributed by Buddah Records produced by Richard Nader. After Haley's death, surviving members of The Comets (which included Marshall Lytle) recorded new versions of the song in 1997 (Rockstar Records), 2000 (Rollin Rock Records) and 2002 (Bradley House Records). August, 1953 78 single release in the UK on London Records as L.1190. The Original Comets featuring Dick Richards on drums and Joey Ambrose on lead vocals performed the song live on July 5, 2014 at the Wildest Cats concert in the UK with Jacko Buddin on lead guitar. Cover versions Ralph Marterie and his Orchestra also had a major hit with their version in 1953 as Mercury 70153, which Cashbox paired with the Bill Haley recording on July 4, 1953, peaking at #11. Marterie reached no. 13 on the Billboard Jockey chart with his version for the week ending June 20, 1953. It is sometimes claimed that sax player Rudy Pompilli, later to join the Comets, was on this record, but there is no evidence of this. Ralph Marterie's recording was #93 on the Billboard Top 100 Records of 1953. The Ralph Marterie version on Mercury, Mercury 70153, with vocals by Larry Regan and the Smarty-Airs, backed with \\"Go Away\\", was also released on Oriole, CB. 1199, in the UK and Deutsche Austroton, M 70153.

It was originally built in the 16th century and now houses the Fermanagh County Museum and the regimental museum of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards. History The first Enniskillen castle was built on this site by Hugh Maguire in 1428. It featured greatly in Irish rebellions against English rule in the 16th century. It was besieged by Captain John Dowdall's troops at the start of 1594 and fell on 2 February after a short siege, when the occupants were massacred after they surrendered.James O'Neill, 'Threes sieges and two massacres: Enniskillen at the outbreak of the Nine Years War, 1593-5, The Irish Sword, xxx, no. 121 (2016), pp 241-9 The castle was again under siege later that year but was relieved. The fortress finally fell to the irish in 1595. The castle remained in Irish hands until it fell to the crown's Irish ally, Niall Garve O'Donnell in the summer of 1602. Captain William Cole remodelled and refurbished the castle adding the riverside tower at the south, known as the Watergate, in 1609. The castle was remodelled as \\"Castle Barracks\\" as part of the response to a threat of a French invasion in 1796. Castle Barracks became the home of the 27th Regiment of Foot in 1853. The regiment moved to purpose-built facilities at St Lucia Barracks, Omagh in 1875 and evolved, after amalgamation, to become the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers in 1881. The barracks continued to be used by other regiments and, from November 1939, they became to home of the North Irish Horse, a Territorial Army unit.Doherty p. 45 The barracks were decommissioned in 1950 and were converted for use as council depot. The castle was subsequently opened to the public as a heritage centre. Features and collections The Castle provided the main defence for the west end of the town and guarded the Sligo road. It consists of two sections, a central tower keep and a curtain wall which was strengthened with small turrets called Bartizans. The design of the castle has strong Scottish influences. This can be particularly seen in the Watergate, which features two corbelled circular tourelles which were built about 1609. It is a State Care Historic Monument. The castle is now home to the Fermanagh County Museum, which focuses on the county's history, culture and natural history. Exhibits include the area's prehistory, natural history, traditional rural life, local crafts and Belleek Pottery, and history of the castle. It also contains information on the Maguire family. The castle also houses the Inniskillings Museum, which is the regimental museum of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards.

The Working Men's Club and Institute Union (CIU or C&IU;) is a voluntary association of private members' clubs in Great Britain & Northern Ireland, with about 1,800 associate clubs. One club in the Republic of Ireland, the City of Dublin Working Men's Club is also affiliated. Most social clubs are affiliated to the CIU. They do not have to be working men's clubs, although most are. There are many village clubs, Royal British Legions, Labour Clubs, Liberal Clubs, and various other clubs involved. A member of one CIU-affiliated club is entitled to use the facilities of all other CIU clubs, although they will only be entitled to vote in committee elections in clubs where they are full members. The CIU has two main purposes: to provide a voice at national level for working men's clubs and social clubs, and to provide discounted products and services for its members. History The Club and Institute Union was founded by The Rev. Henry Solly in 1862. A great propagandist for clubs, he provided a much needed conceptual clarity to the notion of club work. He was also an important advocate for the extension of working class political rights and helped to set up the Charity Organisation Society. The CIU as a national body is non- political, but individual clubs can be affiliated to political parties. Originally, it was a middle class-led philanthropic organisation aimed at education and non-alcoholic recreation. However, working men themselves soon took over the running of the CIU and drinks were allowed. William Ewart Gladstone In the Victorian era, the Liberal Working Men's Clubs were prominent in increasing the Union's membership. Sometimes Liberal Clubs were called Gladstone Clubs in honour of the Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone. In some working-class areas, local landowners and business owners would contribute to the cost: however, as land was relatively cheaper in those days, it was fairly easy for groups of men to buy the land and establish the clubs using their own skills and labour. In the pre- and post-World War I era, these clubs were often associated with trade societies and trade union branches. In the miners' strike of the early 1980s, the Miners' Welfare Clubs played a key role in their support of the strike. Other such clubs can still be recognised by their name, e.g. Engineers or Railwaymen's Clubs. There were also Socialist Clubs, built before the establishment of the Labour Party. Labour Clubs were founded as that party grew in size in the 1920s. Generally, Conservative Clubs did not join, as they formed their own federation (though there are some such venues still in existence). Servicemen returning from the Great War would also found clubs, and Roman Catholic parishes had clubs. The only stipulation demanded for membership of the CIU was that clubs be owned by the members and accept the standards of membership, as they were often subject to inspection. The wealthier clubs have sports pitches and dining facilities, as well as indoor games and entertainment. Many entertainers developed their skills in them over the years, as depicted in the ITV series The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club. Until 2004, the CIU had its own beer brewed by the Federation brewery in Dunston, Tyne and Wear. Although CIU-affiliated clubs do still receive discounted beer, these discounts are largely passed on to the members, and Federation beer will generally be cheaper than beer available in local pubs. The brewery was taken over by Scottish & Newcastle in 2004 and now brews Newcastle Brown Ale. Together with other club organisations such as the Royal British Legion, the Association of Conservative Clubs, the National Union of Liberal Clubs and the National Union of Labour and Socialist Clubs, the CIU is part of CORCA (Confederation of Registered Club Associations) which lobbies Parliament on behalf of clubs. This group was active in the debate about smoking: as most clubs are known for working men who like to drink and smoke (in many cases without any women in the bar), there is some concern about the future prospects of clubs. The CIU holds a national congress every year and as part of its activities runs convalescent homes. In many ways, it could be said to be the oldest surviving friendly society still run by its members, and continues to play a part in the cultural life of working-class families. Today York R I Club, CIU-affiliated. The Working Men's Club and Institute Union is now the largest non-profit-making social entertainment and leisure organisation in the UK, representing the interests and views of six million club members. The Working Men's Club and Institute has come a long way since 1862. However, it could be said that working men's clubs have suffered from an old-fashioned image among young people, and have found it hard to compete with modern trends, resulting in many closures of clubs in recent years. The problem has recently become acute, particularly in relation to anti-smoking legislation, which the CIU unsuccessfully lobbied MPs to exempt clubs from. The CIU has changed in recent years, and women are now allowed full membership rights. Some clubs have broadened their appeal by letting local community groups use the facilities.

The Blaney area takes its name from Sir Edward Blaney, who was among the English advance party sent to Fermanagh to organise the Plantation. Tully Castle is a fortified house with a rectangular bawn and was built for Sir John Hume, a Scottish planter, in 1619. The bawn had four rectangular corner towers. During the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Rory Maguire set out to recapture his family‚Äôs lands. He arrived at Tully Castle with a large following on Christmas Eve, and found the castle full of women and children. Most of the men were away. Lady Mary Hume surrendered the Castle, believing that she had assured a safe conduct for all in her care, but on Christmas Day the Maguires killed 60 women and children and 15 men, sparing only the Humes. The castle was burnt and the Humes never went back. Captain Patrick Hume later testified about the events of Christmas Day, 1641, saying: :\\"And afterwards that same day, the rebels having stripped the Protestants of all their clothes (except the said Lady Hume), they imprisoned them in the vaults or cellars of the said castle, where they kept them with a strong guard all that night, and the next morning, being the Lord‚Äôs Day, and the 25th day of December, 1641, they took the Lady Hume, Alexander Hume, John Grier, and this examt., with their wives and children, away from the rest of the prisoners, forth of the said castle, and placed them in the barn of one John Goodfellow at Tully, aforesaid, within a stone‚Äôs cast from the castle, putting them in hopes that they meant to convey them to the Castle of Monea, upon horses which they provided for them, but as for the rest that were then left behind in the Castle of Tully, the rebels told those in the barn that they should go on foot after them to Monea aforesaid. But immediately after, upon the 25th of December, 1641, at Tully Castle and within and about the bawn and vaults of the same, in the county of Fermanagh, the rebels did most cruelly and barbarously murder the said Protestants, to the number of men and 60 women and children or thereabouts, the names of the persons so murdered followeth, viz.: Francis Trotter, Thomas Trotter, Alexander Sheringfield, Alexander Bell, George Chearnside, Robert Black, James Barry, Thomas Anderson, Robert Lawdon, John Brooke, David Anderson, James Anderson, and many others - men, women, and children - whose names this deponent doth not now remember. The actors in this massacre, this examt. saith, for the most part are since that time dead, or slain as he heard, and as for such of them as survive, this examt. remembers not their names. And this examt. saith, after the said rebels did pillage and plunder the said castle, they did burn it on the day and year aforesaid. And further this examt. deposeth not anything material.\\" PTK.

Hypersonic was built by S&S; ‚Äì Sansei Technologies, a company specializing in air-powered rides, and was the first compressed air launch coaster in the world. Hypersonic was S&S; ‚Äì Sansei Technologies's actual prototype for an air-launched coaster, called Thrust Air 2000. The ride was originally fabricated by Intermountain Lift, Inc. It was reconstructed at Kings Dominion after being moved from its original location in Utah. S&S; ‚Äì Sansei Technologies also greatly modified the section following the 90¬∞ drop to accommodate Kings Dominion's landscape and to properly bank the turn.Press Release (Hypersonic XLC, The Xtreme Launch Coaster- Designed to thrill!) Hypersonic XLC suffered extended downtime, and was closed for nearly three months at the beginning of Kings Dominion's 2002 season. In 2007, Hypersonic XLC was closed and later dismantled. The platform is all that remains at the ride's former location between Grizzly and Twisted Timbers. Ride experience After a launch from 0 to in 1.8 seconds up a 90¬∞ incline, the ride crested a hill, and without fully slowing, plummeted down a 90¬∞ dive. Next, the coaster performed a banked left turn, went through a smaller banked right turn, and skirted a small hill before heading into the brake run. Riders face the 90¬∞ dive in front of the now defunct Hurler. Launch system Hypersonic XLC's launch system was comparatively new technology utilizing compressed air to launch the ride train. It is very similar to the launch system used to launch Space Shot rides, also developed by S&S; ‚Äì Sansei Technologies. Characteristics of compressed air launches are shorter runways and quicker acceleration, when compared to hydraulic and LIM/LSM launch platforms. The compressed air launch system is used on the world's fastest accelerating ride, Do-Dodonpa, which accelerates to in just 1.56 seconds. It was also used on Ring Racer. Rides such as Kingda Ka and Top Thrill Dragster have a higher top speed than Dodonpa, but Dodonpa is the ride with the quickest acceleration. Current status During the 2006 off-season, Kings Dominion put Hypersonic XLC up for sale.http://www.italintl.com/detail_page.php?record_id=937 In January 2008, the park removed Hypersonic from its web site. On the park's opening day on March 22, 2008, Hypersonic XLC had been disassembled and was placed in its current laydown yard, along part of the park's back road.

It is part of the Greater Valpara√≠so metropolitan area. It is widely known as \\"City of the Sun\\" (Ciudad del Sol) and the urban part of it also comprises the town of El Belloto, an area that showed rapid growth in the late 1990s. Etymology There are various theories about the origin of the word Quilpu√©. According to some, Quilpu√© means place where there are pigeons, arguing that pigeons were found abundantly in the area and that the name derives from the aboriginal words cullpo (dove) and hue (place). Other authors suggest that it means place of the stone lancet, because the Picunches (the indigenous Mapuche people) were experts in the manufacture of these items that were used for medical procedures. Numbers of these stone lancets have been found in the area's archaeological sites, as well as the original formation which was quarried for them. Tourism Barrio Quilpu√©. Quilpu√© is called Ciudad del Sol because compared to Valpara√≠so, it has many more sunny days a year. It has metropolitan train, highway and bus connections to Vi√±a del Mar and Valpara√≠so to the coast, and also towards inland cities. Since housing is cheaper in Quilpu√©, thousands of people commute every day to the coastal cities. Quilpu√© is connected to Santiago through the Route 68, with an estimated travel time of 1.15h by car and 1.30h by inter-regional bus services, that departs and arrive mostly from Pajaritos metro and interchange station, west of the national capital. Local attractions include a Zoo (only one of the Valpara√≠so Region), and the rural towns of Colliguay and the Marga- Marga Valley, both with facilities for camping and hiking.

It was designed by G.D. Reynolds of Murphy Radio. Both AC and battery-operated versions were made. History When war broke out in 1939, British radio manufacturers devoted their resources to producing a range of military radio equipment required for the armed forces. This resulted in a shortage of consumer radio sets and spare parts, particularly valves, as all production was for the services. The war also prompted a shortage of radio repairmen, as virtually all of them were needed in the services to maintain vital radio and radar equipment. This meant it was very difficult for the average citizen to get a radio repaired, and with very few new sets available, there was a desperate need to overcome the problem. The government solved this by arranging for over forty radio manufacturers to produce sets to a standard design with as few components as possible consistent with the ability to source them. Earlier, the government had introduced the \\"Utility\\" brand to ensure that all clothing, which was rationed, was produced to a reasonable quality standard as, prior to its introduction, a lot of shoddy goods had appeared on the market; the brand was therefore adopted for this wartime radio. The Utility Set had limited reception on medium wave and lacked a longwave band to simplify the design. The tuning scale listed only BBC stations. After the war a version with LW was made available and modification kits to retrofit existing sets were marketed. About 175,000 sets were sold, at a price of ¬£12 3s 4d each. The set is sometimes characterized as the British equivalent of the German Volksempf√§nger \\"Peoples' Receiver\\"; however there were dissimilarities. The Volksempf√§nger were radio sets designed to be inexpensive enough for any German citizen to purchase one. A supply of higher quality consumer radios were always available to Germans who could afford to pay higher prices. By contrast, the Utility Set was the only consumer radio receiver that could be purchased on the British market for much of the latter part of the war. Starting in June 1942, manufacture of consumer radio receivers in the United States also ceased due to military production needs.  Specifications  The sets used a four-valve superhet circuit with an audio output of 4 watts at 10% total harmonic distortion; they performed as well as many pre-war sets. The valve complement consisted of a triode-hexode frequency changer, a variable-Œº RF pentode IF amplifier and a high slope output pentode. A \\"Westector\\" solid-state copper oxide diode was used for demodulation, which saved one valve and allowed use of an available type of pentode for the audio stage. The HT line was derived from a full wave rectifier. All valves were on International Octal sockets apart from the rectifier which was on a British 4-pin base. There were minor variations between set makers; for instance Philips used IF transformers with adjustable ferrite cores (so-called slug tuning) rather than the conventional trimmer capacitors.  Manufacturers  More than 40 manufacturers, such as Pye Ltd. and Marconiphone, made Utility radios. The manufacturer of a particular set was not readily apparent to the general public, although each manufacturer stamped a code letter on the radio to identify themselves to dealers. UK makers often used different designations for the same valve (tube), while octal tubes might be of USA origin. All valves in the Utility radio used standard designations prefixed by BVA (for British Valve Association). They were produced by valve makers such as Mullard, MOV, Cossor, Mazda and Brimar. Dealers, knowing the maker of a set and which valve manufacturer that maker used, could easily deduce which pre-war types these were and make warranty claims on the manufacturer.

Peneia is a poetic name for the peninsula, often found in classical texts. Characteristics Peneias generally stand between 10.1 and 14 hands high, and are usually bay, black, chestnut, or gray, although other colors are seen. They have a well-proportioned head with a convex profile and a well-set neck running into low withers, a wide chest, and muscular, sloping shoulders. They have a short back, sloping croup, and long legs with small, tough hooves. The natural gait of the Peneia breed is fairly stilted, so they are usually taught a smoother gait called the aravani. History The breed was founded on an autochthonous Greek variety very possibly related to the Pindos, and later crossed with Anglo-Arab, Anglo-Norman and Nonius strains. Its herdbook was only established in 1995. The breed is found in Elis and Achaea in the northwest of the Peloponnese. According to Greek Agriculture Ministry statistics, as of 2002 there were two hundred thirty-one breeding mares and sixty-nine stallions. Uses Peneias are used as draft animals, pack animals, and mounts for riding and jumping. The stallions are often used for breeding hinnies.

Unlike other concurrent pick-up trucks, the coupe express mated Studebaker's passenger car styling to a full size truck bed. The Coupe Express utilized the Dictator passenger car frame, running gear, and front sheet metal. A new body stamping was made to form the cab back. An all-steel pickup box was built for the pickup models. The model was sold as a cab and chassis, with rear fenders attached, so a service box could be fabricated by the end user (such as a plumber, or depot hack). The truck was powered by the larger of Studebaker's L-head six-cylinder flathead engines and mated to a 3-speed manual transmission. Studebaker offered a Borg-Warner 3-speed transmission with overdrive as an option. Other options included, a radio, heater, wire reinforced sliding back window and turn indicators. Two wheel options were available including a stamped steel disc wheel and a stamped steel 'artillery' spoked wheel. Production for the 1937 model year was approximately 3,000 units. The truck's passenger cab was restyled in 1938 to reflect the modernized passenger car sheet metal resulted a slightly longer pickup bed. Production for 1938 was approximately 1,200 units. The 1939 model was again remodeled to reflect Studebaker's annual design updates. Production was approximately 1,000 units. The Coupe Express model was discontinued after the 1939 model year, and Studebaker did not offer a successor model for 1940.

Completed in 1937, two years before the start of World War II, the ship served as a flagship and spent most of her time training although she did participate in the occupation of Memel in early 1939. Several days after the start of the war in September 1939, Z1 Leberecht Maass and another destroyer unsuccessfully attacked Polish ships in the naval base on the Hel Peninsula. She was lightly damaged during the action. In mid-February 1940, while proceeding into the North Sea to attack British fishing trawlers (Operation Wikinger), the ship was bombed by a patrolling German bomber that damaged her steering. A court of inquiry convened during the war determined that she and a sister ship were hit by bombs, but a post-war investigation determined that she had drifted into a newly laid British minefield. Z1 Leberecht Maass broke in half with the loss of most of her crew. Design and description Design work on the Type 34-class destroyers began in 1932, despite the limit imposed by the Versailles Treaty that had ended World War I. Initial designs were for large ships more powerful than the French and Polish destroyers then in service, but the design grew as the Reichsmarine now expected it to serve as a small cruiser. The design work appears to have been rushed and not well- thought out as the short forecastle and lack of flare at the bow compromised the ships' seakeeping ability and their stability was inadequate. The only real innovative part of the design, the high-pressure boilers, were an over- complicated system that received almost no shipboard testing before being installed in the Type 34s and frequently broke down throughout the life of the ships. The class had an overall length of and were long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of , and a maximum draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce using steam provided by six Wagner boilers. The ships had a designed speed of , but their maximum speed was . The Type 34s carried a maximum of of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of at a speed of , but they proved top-heavy in service and 30% of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship. The effective range proved to be only at 19 knots. The crew of the Type 34 class ships numbered 10 officers and 315 enlisted men, plus an additional four officers and 19 enlisted men if serving as a flotilla flagship. The Type 34s carried five SK C/34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the aft superstructure. The guns were numbered from one to five from front to rear. Their anti-aircraft armament consisted of four SK C/30 guns in a pair of twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six C/30 guns in single mounts. The ships carried eight torpedo tubes in two power- operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes was provided for each mount. Leberecht Maass had four depth charge launchers mounted on the sides of her rear deckhouse, which was supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern, with either 32 or 64 charges carried. Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. A system of passive hydrophones designated as 'GHG' (Gruppenhorchger√§t) was fitted to detect submarines. Construction and career Z1 Leberecht Maass, named after Rear Admiral (Konteradmiral) Leberecht Maass, who was killed while commanding German forces in the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914, was the first destroyer to be built in Germany since World War I. She was ordered on 7 July 1934 and laid down at Deutsche Werke, Kiel, on 10 October 1934 as yard number K232. The ship was launched on 18 August 1935 and completed on 14 January 1937, under the command of Lieutenant Commander (Korvettenkapit√§n) Friedrich T. Schmidt. As the first ship of her class to be completed, Leberecht Maass became the flagship of the Leader of Torpedo-boats (F√ºhrer der Torpedoboote (FdT)) on 1 May and spent much of her first year training in the eastern Baltic Sea, before making a port visit in Gothenburg, Sweden, in early April 1938. Upon her return, the ship was turned over to her builders to have her bow rebuilt to fix the large amount of water that came over it in head seas. The ship then participated in the August 1938 Fleet Review and the following fleet exercise. Korvettenkapit√§n Gerhard Wagner relieved Schmidt in October. In December, Leberecht Maass, together with her sisters Z2 Georg Thiele, Z3 Max Schultz, and Z4 Richard Beitzen, sailed to the area of Iceland to evaluate her seaworthiness in a North Atlantic winter with her new bow. On 23‚Äì24 March 1939, the ship was one of the destroyers that escorted Adolf Hitler aboard the heavy cruiser to occupy Memel. Korvettenkapit√§n Fritz Bassenge assumed command of Leberecht Maass the following month. Afterwards, she participated in the fleet exercise in the western Mediterranean, as the flagship of Konteradmiral G√ºnther L√ºtjens, and visited Ceuta, Spain, and R√≠a de Arousa in Spain in before departing for Germany on 13 May. The initial task of the Kriegsmarine when Hitler declared war on Poland on 1 September was to blockade the Polish coast and it deployed three light cruisers and ten destroyers to accomplish its mission. Leberecht Maass evaded an attack by the submarine on the first day of the war and it quickly became apparent that the Kriegsmarine had deployed too many ships off the Polish coast and the cruisers were withdrawn. Two days later, the ship and Z9 Wolfgang Zenker were ordered to investigate the ships in the naval base at Hel. They spotted the Polish destroyer and the minelayer and engaged both ships at a range around . German fire was ineffective, but the Polish return fire was more accurate and forced the German destroyers to make evasive maneuvers and to lay a smoke screen to throw off the aim of the Polish gunners. Leberecht Maass was hit by a shell from the coast defense battery defending the base at 06:57, which knocked out power to No. 2 gun, disabled its shell hoists, killed four crewmen and wounded another four. The ship fired 77 rounds of 12.7 cm ammunition during the battle. The following day, she sailed to Swinem√ºnde to have her damage repaired, a process that took until 10 September as it included repairs to the ship's boiler tubes. After its completion, Leberecht Maass helped to lay defensive minefields in the North Sea and L√ºtjens transferred his flag to Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, the ship being assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla (2. Zerst√∂rer Flotille). She began a previously scheduled refit in Swinem√ºnde on 29 September and was again the flagship of the FdT by 30 November, but rejoined 2. Zerst√∂rerflotille on 22 December. In retaliation for the Altmark Incident where the Royal Navy seized captured British sailors from the in neutral Norwegian waters on 16 February 1940, the Kriegsmarine organized Operation Nordmark to search for Allied merchant ships in the North Sea as far north as the Shetland Islands. 2. Zerst√∂rerflotille, including Leberecht Maass, escorted the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau as well as the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper during the initial stage of the sortie on 18 February, but Leberecht Maass and Z5 Paul Jacobi were detached the following day on an unsuccessful search for enemy shipping in the Skagerrak. A few days later, the Kriegsmarine planned Operation Wikinger in cooperation with the Luftwaffe in the erroneous belief that the British fishing trawlers off the Dogger Bank were cooperating with submarines. They believed that sinking or capturing the trawlers would force the British to spread themselves thin to defend the fishing fleet and might result in some useful auxiliary ships for the Kriegsmarine. The Luftwaffe promised fighter cover for the ships engaged in the operation as well as bomber support. Loaded with prize crews, Leberecht Maass and five other destroyers, Max Schultz, Richard Beitzen, Z6 Theodor Riedel, Z13 Erich Koellner and Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, sailed on 22 February. En route, the flotilla was mistakenly attacked by a Heinkel He 111 bomber from Kampfgeschwader 26. Leberecht Maass was hit by at least one bomb, lost her steering, and broke in half, sinking with the loss of 280 of her crew, including the ship's captain. Only 60 of her crew were saved. During the rescue effort, Max Schultz hit a mine and sank with the loss of her entire crew. Hitler ordered a court of inquiry to be convened to investigate the cause of the losses and it concluded that both ships had been sunk by bombs from the He 111. The Kriegsmarine had failed to notify its destroyers that the Luftwaffe was making anti-shipping patrols at that time and had also failed to inform the Luftwaffe that its destroyers would be at sea. Postwar research revealed that one or both ships may have struck a British minefield laid by the destroyers and .

First opened on September 28, 1986, the park is currently owned and operated by the Shijingshan District government. The park is accessible, via the Line 1 of the Beijing Subway, although had its own stop that‚Äôs called Bajiao Amusement Park Station (ÂÖ´ËßíÊ∏∏‰πêÂõ≠). Copyright infringement controversy In May 2007, the park was exposed by international media for having made unauthorized use of Japanese and American cartoon characters. According to a report originally broadcast on Fuji TV's FNN News, the park features a castle that resembles Disney's trademark Sleeping Beauty Castle and a structure that looks like Epcot's Spaceship Earth. The park also features a host of costumed characters that look remarkably similar to not only Disney's trademark characters, but also Shrek, Hello Kitty, Doraemon, Bugs Bunny and a number of other trademarked characters. Park officials denied any wrongdoing. When asked by the FNN News reporter if the characters are related to Disney, the theme park's general manager Liu Jingwang said that their characters are based on Grimm's Fairy Tales. According to a May 10, 2007, Associated Press report, the park deputy general manager Yin Zhiqiang said that the park's lawyers are in negotiation with The Walt Disney Company. Disney declined to comment directly on this matter. Between 2010 and 2011, the park was expanded and refurbished. China Daily reports the Disney-themed characters may have been removed from the park.

The Court held that there does not need to be a causal connection between the violation and the evidence, but rather there need only be a temporal link between the two. Background Joseph Strachan was under investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for drug related offences. A warrant was obtained under section 10(2) of the Narcotic Control Act to search his apartment. The police arrive at his apartment and found him with two other men, along with a substantial amount of drugs and money. All three men were arrested and read their rights. Upon arrest the officer in charge denied Strachan's attempt to use the phone to contact a lawyer on the basis that he still needed to get \\"matters under control\\". The officer later testified at trial that he intended to first question the suspects and find guns that were suspected of being there before he would allow them to call a lawyer. Strachan was finally allowed to contact his lawyer from the police station an hour and forty minutes after the arrest. At trial, it was held that Strachan's right to counsel, under section 10(b) of the Charter, was violated, that the evidence must be excluded under section 24(2) of the Charter, and that Strachan be acquitted. On appeal, it was held that Strachan's right to counsel was violated but the evidence should not be excluded as there was no causal connection between the violation and evidence collected. A new trial was ordered. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether there was a violation of Strachan's right against unreasonable search and seizure under section 8 of the Charter and whether the evidence should be excluded under section 24(2) of the Charter. Reasons of the court Chief Justice Dickson, writing for the majority of the Court, held that there was no violation of section 8 and the evidence should not be excluded under section 24(2) of the Charter. Justice Lamer wrote his own separate concurring opinion. Justice Wilson wrote her an opinion finding that there was a violation of section 8 but agreed with the rest of the Court that the evidence should not be excluded under section 24(2).

It is roughly bounded by City Avenue (U.S. Route 1), 58th Street, Woodbine Avenue, and 66th Street at Morris Park. The neighborhood is bisected by Lancaster Avenue (U.S. Route 30) and the original Pennsylvania Railroad \\"main line\\". Today the rail line is used by both Amtrak passenger service and SEPTA's commuter Paoli/Thorndale Line. This region of Philadelphia and its suburbs were originally settled by Welsh immigrants, who purchased land from William Penn. Two of these farms contributed land for what became the Overbrook Farms neighborhood, which was developed beginning in 1892. The neighborhood is often incorrectly considered to be a sub-section of the larger and densely developed Overbrook neighborhood. Overbrook Farms was the first of several planned communities along the Main Line of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The Overbrook Farms Company was the developer; its officers had links to directors of the Girard and Drexel banks and the Penn Railroad. This planned community includes some of the first residential projects by the first graduating class of the University of Pennsylvania's architectural program. Overbrook Farms maintains the oldest continually operating neighborhood association in the United States, the Overbrook Farms Club (OFC). OFC sponsors an annual house tour each Spring. The neighborhood was designated as a National Historic District and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its description and statement of significance can be found at \\"Overbrook Farms\\", Historic Districts.

Walmart Watch asserts that the memo portrayed worker's wages and benefits as being too low. The memo proposed ways to reduce spending on workers' benefits without damaging the reputation of Walmart. Specifically, one proposal suggested that Walmart begin hiring more part-time workers because they would not be bound to offer the same benefits as they do for full-time workers. This would also help Walmart cut costs buy being able to pay worker's a part-time wage rather than a full-time wage. Therefore, Walmart Watch took action by exposing this internal draft memo to the public to illustrate the worsening conditions of Walmart employees.Greenhouse, Steven, and Michael Barbaro. \\"Wal-Mart Memo Suggests Ways to Cut Employee Benefit Costs.\\" NY Times 26 Oct. 2005.

Effects On Walmart Walmart Watch's actions, geared toward influencing Walmart to alter its business practices, negatively effected Walmart financially as well as their reputation among consumers. By November 2006, Walmart's stock suffered from the negative publicity and was down 30 percent since 2000. In addition, Walmart's sales growth was 3.1 percent lower than their competitor, Target, at 1.5 percent.Gimbel, B. (2006, November 28). Attack of the wal-martyrs. Fortune Magazine , pp. 1-6.

In February 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decided, in a 2-to-1 ruling, that the lawsuit would proceed as a class action on account of the 1.5 million female employees, who claimed they were denied higher pay and company promotions.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Court Approves Class-Action Suit Against Wal-Mart.\\" The New York Times, February 7, 2007.

Walmart's Response In an attempt to reconcile its image, Walmart banded with Edelman Public Relations to create an opposing advocacy group, Working Families for Wal-Mart, on December 20, 2005. The goal of this advocacy group was to show Walmart in a positive light to society by highlighting Walmart's charitable contributions and corporate social responsibility initiatives.Goldberg, J.

It is a two-way single carriageway road. It was formerly known as the A8000, when it was the main road from the bridge to the M9 motorway and the M8 motorway. The A8000 was under the control of the City of Edinburgh Council, not a Trunk Road under the control of the Scottish Executive. Despite this, it was one of the most important strategic routes in the east of Scotland, carrying traffic from Fife, and further north, to the central Scotland motorway network, and the City of Edinburgh Bypass. During the morning and evening rush hours it was often jammed nose-to-tail for its entire length. It was replaced in this function in September 2007, when a new section of the M9 which bypasses the B800 was completed. During September 2009 signs amending the numbering of the A8000 to the B800 appeared at the start of the former A8000 and on the northbound slip road of the A90 at the Echline junction.  Route  From the north, the B800 leaves the A9000 (formerly part of the A90) just south of the Forth Road Bridge at Echline Roundabout and heads east to Ferry Muir Roundabout. This busy junction provides access to South Queensferry and a retail park. From Ferry Muir, the road curves south, back over the A9000 and A90, then continues for about 1.5 miles where it previously met a spur of the M9, at the Humbie roundabout. The roundabout has now gone and the M9 spur, now redesignated as M90, passes overhead.  Downgrading  The Scottish Executive and FETA (Forth Estuary Transport Authority) jointly agreed to fund a replacement of this road. The new road is built along a completely new route, extending the current M9 spur for about 3 km to a new north-facing junction on the A90 near Dalmeny. Following extensive ground stabilisation work, construction of the M9 Spur Extension started on 17 May 2006 and the new road opened to traffic, initially in a southbound direction only, on 5 September 2007, a month ahead of schedule.http://news.scotsman.com/edinburgh.cfm?id=1416402007 news.scotsman.com thumb References External links *CBRD Futures Page - A8000 *City of Edinburgh Council Leaflet (PDF) *Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA) Category:Roads in Scotland Category:Transport in Edinburgh ","title":"B800 road"},{"id":"4275786","text":"The Vancouver Film Critics Circle (VFCC) was founded in 2000 by David Spaner and Ian Caddell, in order to help promote Canadian films and the British Columbia Film and Television Industry.

Otis was played by Hal Smith and made frequent appearances on the show from 1960 to 1967 but stopped appearing toward the end of the series because of concerns raised by the sponsors over the portrayal of excessive drinking. Character overview Otis works as a glue dipper in a furniture factory Monday through Friday and drinks all weekend. After a binge, Otis will usually lock himself in the town jail until he is sober. He has a key to the front door of the courthouse and the cell keys are hung on a nail near the cells (presumably, to accommodate Otis). The lack of crime in Mayberry and the laid-back attitude of the Sheriff's department, easily accommodates Otis's drinking habit. On one occasion Otis brings a suit to the jail on Friday before his binge so that he can change into the suit for church on Sunday without going home first. Otis often lets himself in jail on the same day that a dignitary or a superior of Sheriff Andy Taylor is arriving at the courthouse, much to the chagrin of the sheriff or Deputy Barney Fife, played by Don Knotts. In the episode \\"The Case of the Punch in the Nose\\", it is revealed that Otis was first arrested for drunkenness on September 23, 1941, at 2 p.m. (a Tuesday) but was released because it was \\"his first offense.\\" A common joke on the show was to have Otis see something bizarre or unexpected while he was inebriated that was actually present, but which he would assume to be a drunken hallucination. Once, Sheriff Taylor locked a dynamite-laden goat in a padded jail cell to prevent an explosion. Predictably, Otis stumbled in after a night of drinking, and let himself into the same cell, only to find the mattress nailed to the wall (curiously, along with the blanket). Otis attempted to climb into the bed anyway, and naturally fell on the floor. Believing the peculiarity to be a result of his intoxication, he exclaimed, \\"First time I ever fell off a bed onto the wall.\\" On the Danny Thomas Show episode that was the pilot for The Andy Griffith Show, Andy had deputized another town drunk, Will Hoople, so that Will could arrest himself every time he got drunk. In the episode \\"Deputy Otis\\", Otis was temporarily deputized when it was learned that his family thought he worked in the sheriff's office because of his use of their stationary. During that time Otis became agitated with Barney's dictatorial style and Barney was especially concerned about having the town drunk made a deputy. An episode in Season 1 reveals Otis is the descendant of a local war hero. The Women's Historical Society want to award Otis an honorary plaque, which causes Barney and the mayor to worry about Otis' condition at the upcoming ceremony; and, they pressure Andy to find a substitute. Otis, however, appears sober, clean-shaven and in a suit. He humbly gives the award to the town stating that he cannot take credit for \\"just being born.\\" In episode \\"Deputy Otis,\\" the season 2 finale, it is revealed that Otis has a brother named Ralph (Stanley Adams), who is the town drunk in another community. Also in this episode viewers are introduced to Otis' wife, Rita. In the Season 1 episode, \\"Bringing Up Opie,\\" Aunt Bee is concerned with Opie's frequent trips to visit Andy at the jail because of the nature of Andy's work. This includes Otis' presence. Near the end of the episode, Opie is allowed to conditionally return if Otis is not there. Opie, then 7, responds \\"You mean when he's had a snootful?\\" At one point, Otis buys a car which concerns Barney who stakes Otis out for a possible DUI. When Otis emerges from a party drunk, Andy and Barney intervene and trick Otis into believing he died while driving drunk. Otis reveals he had already sold his car. Only twice was Otis arrested for something other than drunkenness. In the episode \\"Ellie For Council,\\" Otis is jailed for assault ‚Äî during a fight with Rita, Otis tries to hit her with a leg of lamb, misses, and hits his mother-in-law in the mouth (much to his delight). In \\"Barney and the Governor\\", while already in the jail for drinking, Otis spikes the courthouse's water cooler with whisky, causing Barney and Mayor Roy Stoner to get inadvertently drunk. This, as Andy says in the epilogue of the episode, is a \\"serious offense\\" in a dry county like Mayberry, and Otis has to serve a lengthier sentence than usual. Toward the end of the series, Andy mentioned that Otis is now doing his drinking in Mt. Pilot. In the 1986 television movie Return to Mayberry, it is revealed that Otis is now completely sober and employed as the town's ice-cream man, driving a van. Smith appeared as Calver Weems in the Don Knotts comedy The Ghost and Mr. Chicken (1966), playing essentially the same town drunk character, Otis. In 1969, he appeared in the Petticoat Junction episode \\"The Great Race\\". He played Jug Gunderson, a moonshiner that helped the Cannonball train win the aforementioned race. Though his character was never seen drinking or drunk, by the end of the episode, he makes an oath to himself to stop drinking and reform.

Viscount Ranelagh was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created on 25 August 1628 for Sir Roger Jones, son of Thomas Jones, Archbishop of Dublin and Lord Chancellor of Ireland. He was made Baron Jones of Navan, in the County of Meath, at the same time also in the Peerage of Ireland. Thomas Jones's father was Henry Jones, of Middleton in Lancashire. The first Viscount was succeeded by his eldest son, Arthur, the second Viscount, who represented Weobly in the English Parliament.

They remained dormant until 1759 when Charles Wilkinson Jones successfully claimed the titles, and became the fourth Viscount. He was the great-grandson of the Honourable Thomas Jones, younger son of the first Viscount. He was succeeded by his son Charles, the fifth Viscount, a captain in the Royal Navy. The fifth Viscount was unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother Thomas, the sixth Viscount. Thomas was succeeded by his son Thomas, the seventh Viscount, who is known for his involvement in the volunteer movement. The titles became extinct on the seventh Viscount's death in 1885. The Honourable Alexander Montgomery Jones, younger son of the fourth Viscount, was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy. After the earldom had become extinct and the viscountcy dormant in 1712, the Ranelagh title was revived in 1715 in favour of Sir Arthur Cole, 2nd Baronet, of Newland, who was made Baron Ranelagh. He was the son of Sir John Cole, 1st Baronet, by Elizabeth Chichester, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel John Chichester and the Honourable Mary Jones, daughter of Roger Jones, 1st Viscount Ranelagh, and aunt of Richard Jones, 1st Earl of Ranelagh.

History  The present name of the city appeared for the first time in a document of the year 964 CE as Maccia de Godena. It was a garrison post between the Lombard countdoms of Isernia and Boiano, and later a sighting post along the Pescasseroli-Candela tratturo (shepherds' track). A great number of feudal lords came one after the other to take control of the castle (due to the high vantage point overlooking the valley), including the Pandoni and the Mormile. Many of the early to mid 20th Century inhabitants emigrated to numerous countries, including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada and USA.  Main sights  The Castle of Macchiagodena, with a polygonal plant, was constructed on one limestone cliff spur. Of the castle today, only the basements of the old wall and two towers remain. The Castello (Castle) was put up for sale and was purchased in November 2009 by the Regione of Molise. The Regione decided to purchase the castle for its preservation for public use and part of it may be used as a regional historical museum. Also noteworthy is the Church of Santa Maria Assunta, with a statue made by Francesco Saverio Citarelli from Naples, and a precious processional cross.  Culture  Every year during the 3rd Sunday in May a fine large fair is held to celebrate the feast day of San Nicola, the patron saint of the town. A peculiar tradition is still maintained by some of the population: known as rapimento (\\"kidnapping\\"), it consists in the kidnapping of the future bride some time before the wedding is celebrated.

Established in 1982, the school's alumni include Olympic competitors Bode Miller, Seth Wescott, Kirsten Clark, and Emily Cook, as well as Jeremy Jones, nine-time Snowboard Magazine Big Mountain Rider of the Year. Since 1982 CVA alumni have included 12 Olympians, winners of 92 US national titles, 11 X-Games competitors, 26 NCAA and USCSA All-Americans, 39 US national team members, and six world champions. History The Sugarloaf Region Ski Education Foundation (SRSEF) was founded in 1968 as a non-profit organization offering advanced ski training. In 1972 the Maine State Board of Education approved a tutorial program at the center, held for four to five weeks during the winter. Students skied in the morning and were tutored in the afternoon. Their home schools provided work while the SRSEF provided tutors and a space to study. In 1982 the SRSEF helped found CVA as a five-month tutorial program, in a new campus in the former Capricorn Lodge, and the following year it became a nine-month ski academy, with 20 students. The SRSEF hosted all competitions at Sugarloaf, from high-school level races to the US Alpine championships, until 1992, when they created the Competition Center. In 1995 Sugarloaf and CVA took over the SRSEF weekend program, initially called the Junior Competition Program, then later Sugarloaf Carrabassett Valley Academy (SCVA). It is now known as the CVA Weekend Program. From the 1990s to early 2000s, a building known as the Lumberjack was used as a girls' dorm, but it was sold in the 1990s. The Capricorn Lodge was used for classrooms, dining, equipment storage, and the boys' dormitory. Today Murphey Hall, a three-story building, is used as a dormitory for all students. CVA has students from abroad, including Japan, Korea, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Since 2010 the school has maintained close links with Lycee Lannemezan, a winter sports school in Lannemezan, France.

Upon being told that she has been woken once or twice according to the toss of a coin, once if heads and twice if tails, she is asked her degree of belief for the coin having come up heads.  History  The problem was originally formulated in unpublished work in the mid 1980s by Arnold Zuboff (the work was later published as \\"One Self: The Logic of Experience\\") followed by a paper by Adam Elga. A formal analysis of the problem of belief formation in decision problems with imperfect recall was provided first by Michele Piccione and Ariel Rubinstein in their paper: \\"On the Interpretation of Decision Problems with Imperfect Recall\\" where the \\"paradox of the absent minded driver\\" was first introduced and the Sleeping Beauty problem discussed as Example 5.Michele Piccione and Ariel Rubinstein (1997) ‚ÄúOn the Interpretation of Decision Problems with Imperfect Recall,‚Äù Games and Economic Behavior 20, 3-24.Michele Piccione and Ariel Rubinstein (1997) ‚ÄúThe Absent Minded Driver's Paradox: Synthesis and Responses,‚Äù Games and Economic Behavior 20, 121-130. The name \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" was given to the problem by Robert Stalnaker and was first used in extensive discussion in the Usenet newsgroup rec.puzzles in 1999. The problem Sleeping Beauty volunteers to undergo the following experiment and is told all of the following details: On Sunday she will be put to sleep. Once or twice, during the experiment, Sleeping Beauty will be awakened, interviewed, and put back to sleep with an amnesia-inducing drug that makes her forget that awakening. A fair coin will be tossed to determine which experimental procedure to undertake: * If the coin comes up heads, Sleeping Beauty will be awakened and interviewed on Monday only. * If the coin comes up tails, she will be awakened and interviewed on Monday and Tuesday. In either case, she will be awakened on Wednesday without interview and the experiment ends. Any time Sleeping Beauty is awakened and interviewed she will not be able to tell which day it is or whether she has been awakened before. During the interview Sleeping Beauty is asked: \\"What is your credence now for the proposition that the coin landed heads?\\" Solutions This problem continues to produce ongoing debate. Thirder position The thirder position argues that the probability of heads is 1/3. Adam Elga argued for this position originally as follows: Suppose Sleeping Beauty is told and she comes to fully believe that the coin landed tails. By even a highly restricted principle of indifference, given that the coin lands tails, her credence that it is Monday should equal her credence that it is Tuesday, since being in one situation would be subjectively indistinguishable from the other. In other words, P(Monday Tails) = P(Tuesday  Tails), and thus :P(Tails and Tuesday) = P(Tails and Monday). Suppose now that Sleeping Beauty is told upon awakening and comes to fully believe that it is Monday. Guided by the objective chance of heads landing being equal to the chance of tails landing, it should hold that P(Tails  Monday) = P(Heads  Monday), and thus :P(Tails and Tuesday) = P(Tails and Monday) = P(Heads and Monday). Since these three outcomes are exhaustive and exclusive for one trial, the probability of each is one-third by the previous two steps in the argument. Halfer position David Lewis responded to Elga's paper with the position that Sleeping Beauty's credence that the coin landed heads should be 1/2. Sleeping Beauty receives no new non-self-locating information throughout the experiment because she is told the details of the experiment. Since her credence before the experiment is P(Heads) = 1/2, she ought to continue to have a credence of P(Heads) = 1/2 since she gains no new relevant evidence when she wakes up during the experiment. This directly contradicts one of the thirder's premises, since it means P(Tails  Monday) = 1/3 and P(Heads  Monday) = 2/3. Nick Bostrom argues that Sleeping Beauty does have new evidence about her future from Sunday: \\"that she is now in it,\\" but does not know whether it is Monday or Tuesday, so the halfer argument fails. In particular, she gains the information that it is not both Tuesday and the case that Heads was flipped. Double halfer position The double halfer position argues that both P(Heads) and P(Heads  Monday) equal 1/2. Mika√´l Cozic, in particular, argues that context-sensitive propositions like \\"it is Monday\\" are in general problematic for conditionalization and proposes the use of an imaging rule instead, which supports the double halfer position. Connections to other problems Nick Bostrom argues that the thirder position is implied by the Self-Indication Assumption. Credence about what precedes awakenings is a core question in connection with the anthropic principle. Variations Extreme Sleeping Beauty This differs from the original in that there are one million and one wakings if tails comes up. It was formulated by Nick Bostrom.  The Sailor's Child problem  The Sailor's Child problem, introduced by Radford M. Neal, is somewhat similar. It involves a sailor who regularly sails between ports. On one port there is a woman who wants to have a child with him, across the sea there is another woman who also wants to have a child with him. The sailor cannot decide if he will have one or two children so he will leave it up to coin toss. If Heads he will have one child and if Tails two children. But if the coin lands on Head which woman would have his child? He would decide this by looking at The Sailors Guide to Ports and the woman in the port that appears first would be the woman that he has a child with. You are his child. You do not have a copy of The Sailors Guide to Ports. What is the probability that you are his only child, thus the coin landed on Heads (assume a fair coin)?

It is claimed to be the shortest branch line in Europe, and many miniature railways are certainly longer. Now used solely for passenger traffic, it was originally constructed to allow transshipment with the Stourbridge Town Arm of the Stourbridge Canal. The passenger service along the branch is operated by Pre Metro Operations on behalf of West Midlands Trains. It is currently branded as part of the West Midlands Railway sub- brand. Under the previous franchise, which ended on 10 December 2017, the service was branded as the London Midland Stourbridge Shuttle. Service is provided using two Class 139 Parry People Movers. Replacement buses ran from December 2008 until March 2009 due to the previous Class 153 being reallocated from December 2008, this being the date the Parry People Mover was originally intended to start working the service. However, due to customer feedback, the Class 153 was re-introduced from 15 March until mid June, when the Parry People Mover finally entered full service. For the first time in many years, a Sunday service is operated.  History and usage  At , trains arrive and depart from platform 1, which is dedicated to the branch. After departure, the branch peels away from the main line, as seen in the left of this photo. Constructed by the Great Western Railway, the short and steeply inclined branch originally carried both passenger traffic from nearby to the terminus at and freight to the Amblecote Goods Depot at Stourbridge Basin. The branch opened for passenger traffic on 1 August 1879 and for goods traffic on 1 January 1880. It briefly closed between April 1915 and February 1919 due to the First World War, but has otherwise remained open since. Although the branch line was originally double-tracked, after 1935 the two tracks were worked as two parallel single lines, with the non-passenger track used for freight workings beyond the station over a bridge across Foster Street (a bridge rebuilt in 1957 then subsequently demolished in 1967 after the goods branch closed) towards the Stourbridge Basin. (Until the redevelopment of the bus station in 2012, the bridge abutment remained visible in Foster Street.) The station and branch were listed for closure under the Beeching Axe, but were later delisted in 1965. The goods branch closed in 1965. The 1879 Stourbridge Town station survived mostly intact until February 1979 when it was demolished and the branch cut back by 70 yards, leaving room for a bus station. The line was controlled by traditional semaphore signals until at least 1990, later than the adjacent main line. However, the line is currently worked by the 'One Train Working' system with a train staff as authority to occupy the line, and there are no working signals.  Rail traffic on the line  Parry People Mover approaching Stourbridge Town on 12 March 2006 The line has been used several times as the test route for new types of small rail transport. The Great Western Railway used both autotrains and one of the early railcars on this route, and in December 2005 the route began being used to test the Parry People Mover, a highly energy-efficient railcar, to provide the Sunday service. The experiment has been sufficiently successful to the extent that the Sunday service in June 2006 was included in both the Network Rail printed timetables and Internet site, and now runs on a permanent basis. The line has been operated by two Class 139 Parry People Movers since June 2009. It was previously operated by a single Class 153 car, and prior to that a Class 121, locally known as Daisy the DMU.Back Track Magazine, Volume 19, August 2005, p508 (on-line index) Although the line has been threatened with closure several times in the past, People Mover have suggested that should their railcar prove a success, their service could be further extended into Stourbridge town centre as a light rail system(By who?). Press reports in August 2010 marked the milestone of half a million passengers having been passed, and indicate substantial growth rates and reliability levels comparable to the Docklands Light Railway; a new depot could consolidate this early success.Stourbridge News: Revolutionary Tram Notches Up 500,000 Passengers The train operates six times per hour over the line, with a journey time of three minutes. Passenger volume These are the passenger figures on the line from the year beginning April 2002 to the year beginning April 2018. Comparing the two years, Stourbridge Town has increased by 251% and Stourbridge Junction by 489%.  Accidents  The branch has become notorious for the steep downhill gradient leading from Junction station, and over the years there have been several incidents: *15 June 1897 ‚Äì a train of empty cattle trucks and horse boxes was being reversed down the incline when the locomotive's vacuum brake failed. The locomotive and wagons ploughed into a line of stationary wagons, the office of a local coal merchant, and stables. One man was injured. *24 April 1905 ‚Äì the driver lost control of a locomotive descending the branch, head-first, at the head of 32 wagons. The train demolished the stop block and smashed into and through the goods office at the end of the branch. Luckily the crew managed to jump clear before impact. *10 February 1948 ‚Äì a heavily laden freight train slipped away despite brakes being applied, with the result that wagons telescoped into each other. *2 April 1977 ‚Äì BR Class 122 single-car diesel unit W55012 suffered a brake failure while descending the branch from Stourbridge Junction and crashed through the buffers and the wall beyond, leaving the front part of the train overhanging the road below. This unit is preserved at the Weardale Railway. *21 January 1989 ‚Äì apparently caused by trespassers on the line distracting the driver, who consequently misjudged his braking, class 121 unit W55033 ran through the buffer stops at the end of the line and crashed through the wall beyond. The train was sent out of operation and required an overhaul. *1 March 1990 ‚Äì in a very similar incident to the 1977 crash, brake failure caused class 121 unit W55034 to crash through the rebuilt wall at the end of the line. The buffer stop destroyed in the 1989 crash had not been replaced.

Background In April 1982, Brandon Dyment was in an auto accident on a highway. A doctor soon came to the scene, and Dyment was taken to the hospital by a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer. At the hospital a blood sample was taken from him for medical purposes while unconscious. When Dyment woke up, and while still suffering from a concussion from the accident, he told the doctor that he had been drinking and had taken antihistamine tablets. The doctor talked with a RCMP officer and handed over the blood sample. Police analysis of the blood found that the alcohol level was above the legal limit and so Dyment was charged with being in care or control of a motor vehicle having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the proportion in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood contrary to section 236 of the Criminal Code. At trial, Dyment was convicted. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether: # the taking of possession of the blood sample by the police officer amounted to a seizure as contemplated by s. 8 of the Charter; # taking of the sample was unreasonable and so infringed s. 8; # in excluding the evidence of the analysis of the blood under s. 24(2) of the Charter on the ground that the admission of this evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Reasons of the court The Supreme Court upheld the lower court decision that the RCMP's seizing of blood taken for medical purposes was a violation of section 8 of the Charter and should be excluded under section 24(2). La Forest, writing concurring reasons, examined the scope of protection provided by section 8. He found that underlying section 8 is a right to privacy, which he described as a constitutionally protected value, stating that: :privacy is at the heart of liberty in a modern state...[g]rounded in man's physical and moral autonomy, privacy is essential for the well-being of the individual. For this reason alone, it is worthy of constitutional protection, but it also has profound significance for the public order. The restraints imposed on government to pry into the lives of the citizen go to the essence of a democratic state.

Located on a hilltop near a modern village of the same name, Douiret was a fortified granary, or ksar (plural ksour.) Like other ksour created by North African Berber communities, Douiret was built on a hilltop to help protect it from raiding parties. Douiret is a regular stop on southern Tunisia's ksar trail, along with the villages of Chenini, Ksar Ouled Soltane and Ksar Hadada. The old village of Douiret is located 22 km southwest of Tataouine in a rugged mountainous region. The old village transformed into ruins is surmounted by its citadel or ksar overlooking troglodyte houses dug in the mountain and aligned in a meandering fashion along its cliff. A path of about 3 km is lined up with abandoned dwellings mostly in ruins with the exception of the eye-catching white mosque (known as 'the palm tree mosque' or Jamaa ennakhla) at midway and a couple of renovated dwellings serving as a showcase and/or an atypical motel to host visitors and tourists. History The ancestry of Douiret is believed to be traced back to a founding father with the name of Ghazi Ben Douaieb Bou Kenana, who migrated to the region more than 600 years ago ‚Äì possibly coming from the Moroccan region of Tafilalet (Louis, A. 1975. Douiret: √âtrange Cit√© Berb√®re. Societ√© Tunisienne de Diffusion, Tunis). In 1850, Douiret population was around 3500 inhabitants. It has been an important caravan stop between Gab√®s to the north and the Libyan city of Ghdam√®s to the south. In 1882, Douiret was chosen temporarily by colonial France as the center for its military administrative authority in the southern part of Tunisia before abandoning it in favor of Tataouine soon after that. In the 20th century, Douiret had seen its population progressively decrease as many of its inhabitants migrated mainly to the Tunisian capitol Tunis. By the close of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, the old village of Douiret has virtually transformed into a gost town in ruins as the few remaining families opted to move to the new village of Douiret built at the mountain foothills not far from their ancestors' historic site.

Actor and comedian Phil Hartman starred in the commercial for the game. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot Ice Hockey is a game of two-on-two ice hockey. One player on each team is the goalie, and the other plays offensive (although, the goalie is not confined to the goal). As in the real sport, the object of the game is to take control of the puck and shoot it into the opposing goal to score points. When the puck is in player control, it moves left and right along the blade of the hockey stick. The puck can be shot at any of 32 angles, depending on the position of the puck when it's shot. Human players take control of the skater in control of (or closest to) the puck. The puck can be stolen from its holder; shots can also be blocked by the blade of the hockey stick. Reception Ice Hockey was favorably reviewed in 1982 by Video magazine where it was described as \\"yet another example of Activision's innovative approach to programmable video-game software\\" and suggested that along with Championship Soccer the game \\"proves that cleverly conceived sports simulations can work on the Atari VCS\\". Reviewers identified several aspects setting Ice Hockey apart from other contemporary sports games including the ability of players to take actions that would normally result in penalties (e.g. tripping and slashing), and the fact that the game is playable in both solo and versus modes. Richard A. Edwards reviewed Ice Hockey in The Space Gamer No. 54. Edwards commented that \\"It's a good game overall, but not a great treatment of ice hockey. Due to the frustrations which can occur and the confusion involved in using two team members, this game straddles the fence on deciding about recommendation. Due to the price, it might be better left alone.\\" When Bill Kunkel reviewed the Atari 8-bit computer game Hockey by Gamma Software, he wrote, \\"Gamma's version misses the level of realism attained in Activision's programmable version for the VCS, by quite a bit.\\" References External links *Ice Hockey at AtariAge *Ice Hockey at AtariMania Category:1981 video games Category:Activision games Category:Atari 2600 games Category:Atari 2600-only games Category:Ice hockey video games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Ice Hockey (Atari 2600)"},{"id":"4276018","text":"The Merck Veterinary Manual is a reference manual of animal health care.

Political resolve The movement to commemorate the dead only took off when political differences between Federalists and Democratic- Republicans deepened in the last years of the eighteenth century and the latter took up the question of a memorial in response to the Federalist erection of a statue of George Washington in 1803.Cray, \\"Commemorating the Prison Ship Dead\\", pp. 575‚Äì8. The Tammany Society, headed by Benjamin Romaine\\"Benjamin Romaine\\" on the New York Society Library website\\"Timeline of the Burial of the Prison Ship Martyrs and Benjamin Romaine\\" on the RootsWeb website was created and grew into a Republican organization.

Mitchill asked the federal government to erect a monument to the fallen, but had no successCray, \\"Commemorating the Prison Ship Dead\\", pp. 578‚Äì9. They then turned their efforts to a grand ceremonial re-interment of the prisoners' remains, emphasizing less the construction of a monument than something more suited to the common man. Tammany formed the Wallabout Committee in January 1808. Their efforts took strength from renewed anti-British feeling stemming from British incidents in 1806 and 1807. Finally, when President Thomas Jefferson enacted the Embargo Act of 1808, Tammany and the Republicans used their plans for a re-interment as part of their campaign to bolster anti-British sentiment. Precursor vaults and monuments First vault and monument On April 13, 1808, there was a ceremony to lay the cornerstone of a planned vault. A grand ceremony of re-interment followed on May 26, 1808.Cray, \\"Commemorating the Prison Ship Dead\\", pp. 584‚Äì5. The state voted to provide the Tammany Society $1,000 to build a monument. The Society pocketed the money and the monument was never built. A small square building stood above the 1808 vault with an eagle mounted at the point of the roof. It was located on a triangular plot of land near the Brooklyn Navy Yard waterfront (Wallabout Bay) in what is now called Vinegar Hill.\\"The Prison Ship Martyrs Monument\\" on the Fort Greene Park Conservancy website A wooden fence with thirteen posts and bars painted with the names of the original thirteen states was erected in front.

Little was done to repair or maintain the vault and eventually the original monument was in a state of disrepair and neglect. In 1839, Benjamin Romaine purchased the land where the Martyrs were buried, in a tax sale from Henry Reed Stiles for $291.08. Later that year on July 4, 1839, Benjamin Romaine made an appeal for support (governmental or civic) to build a monument.

The new brick mausoleum in Fort Greene Park, then known as Washington Park, was constructed.Cray, \\"Commemorating the Prison Ship Dead\\", p. 588. The new mausoleum was constructed of Portland granite embellished with pillars and fret work of polished Aberdeen stone. The front of the tomb had the following inscription: \\"SACRED TO THE MEMORY, OF OUR SAILORS, SOLDIERS AND CITIZENS, WHO SUFFERED AND DIED ON BOARD BRITISH PRISON SHIPS IN THE WALLABOUT DURING THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION\\". On June 18, 1873, the first tomb was emptied of bones and they were moved to this tomb. The bones remained here until interest was again built and a new monument could be constructed. Third monument History =Planning and construction= The Fort Greene chapter of the DAR was formed in 1896 in Brooklyn to foster the construction of a \\"suitable memorial to the memory of martyrs, civilian, military and naval, who perished in the noisome prison ships anchored in the Wallabout Bay during the Revolutionary War\\". The group quickly partnered with the Old Brooklynites to increase focus on the memorial. Following the discovery of additional bones in the Brooklyn Naval Yard in 1899, interest in establishing a significant monument was again renewed.\\"Fort Greene Historic District Designation Report\\"C.B.B. \\"The Prison Ship Martyrs\\" (letter to the editor) New York Times (May 23, 1903) On June 16, 1900, the bones found during additional excavations in the Brooklyn Navy Yard were interred in the crypt with full military honors.

The ceremony was opened with a prayer delivered by Rev. S. Parkes Cadman, followed by a poem composed and read by the occasion's poet laureate Thomas Walsh. The principal address was delivered by Taft. He set out in detail the treatment of American prisoners and of the dead he said: \\"They died because of the cruelty of their immediate custodians and the neglect of those who, in higher authority, were responsible for their detention.\\" He carefully described British culpability: He discussed the treatment of prisoners of war throughout history and praised the recent Hague Convention on the rights of prisoners of war and the recent Sino-Japanese War in which \\"both parties exceeded, in the tenderness and the care which they gave to the prisoners of the other, the requirements of the Hague Convention\\". Following the initial dedication, the Society of Old Brooklynites has hosted an annual memorial for the martyrs every year since President Taft dedicated the monument in 1908. =Repeated neglect and restoration= In February 1914, one of the eagles was stolen. The thieves sold it as scrap metal for $24. They broke the eagle from the granite base, rolled it down the slope and loaded it on a three-wheeled pushcart, leaving tracks which the police were able to follow. When police found it at a recycling yard, the wings of the eagle had already been removed and partially melted. One of four bronze eagles by Adolph Weinman at the restored monument site. By 1921, the beacon was out. The twin helix stairways to the top of the monument, which visitors once paid a dime to climb,\\"Memorial to Revolutionary War patriots shines anew in Brooklyn\\" New York Daily News (November 14, 2008) were closed. Until then, visitors could go to the top to get impressive views of Manhattan. In 1923, the bronze door to the crypt was \\"battered from its hinges\\" by vandals and the crypt was exposed. The New York Times report of the incident described how the monument provided a play area for neighborhood children: \\"[A] score of children, white and black, who live in the neighborhood were using the granite coping of the walls leading to the crypt as a sort of 'chute the chutes.' The color line was sharply drawn. The slope of one side was used by the negro children while the slope of the other side amused the whites. The children of neither hue were concerned with the crime. They realized vaguely that something unusual had taken place, but it was not important enough to them to stop their daily sport.\\" However, neglect and damage to the park required it to be renovated. The memorial had become so scarred by vandals and unkempt from lack of proper maintenance as to present a dilapidated appearance. Work was done to clean and preserve the site. A staircase and elevator were installed inside the large column, and it was reopened in 1937 by Park Commissioner Robert Moses. Again, the park was neglected and restoration work was required. It began in 1948 to \\"keep the shrine from falling apart\\". The staircase and elevator, however, were both removed in 1949. In 1966, the eagles were removed and went missing until 1974. In the ensuing years, however, the park slowly decayed again and, by the 1970s, graffiti covered much of the base of the monument and vandalism was taking its toll.\\"The Monument\\" on the Prison Ship Martyrs Association website After being vandalized repeatedly, the four eagles were removed for repairs in 1966 and restored when $251,000 was spent to repair the monument about 1974, part of a larger $780,000 restoration of Fort Greene Park.Lockwood, Charles. \\"Restoration of Fort Greene Park to Begin\\" New York Times (June 10, 1973).

Accessed January 17, 2012 During the park system's inspection in 1995, graffiti was noted to be on the crypt's interior walls. The graffiti is questionably dated to go back to 1973, 1908, and as one tag was scribbled, 1776 ‚Äî which is anachronistic considering that this was before the tomb was even built, in 1908. During a site review on January 7, 2000, Park System workers raised the lid of the stone coffin of Benjamin Romaine. The interior of the coffin appeared to have contained a partially collapsed wooden coffin. By then, the monument was missing plaques, the plaza was potholed, the crypt had a plywood door, and the eternal flame had long been extinguished. =Archaeological excavation of original site= In December 2003, a dig was done on the original site of the Martyrs' Monument. The site dig was funded by a grant of $2,500 from the J. M. Kaplan Fund.O'Grady, Jim. \\"What Remains of the Day; In Vinegar Hill, a Last Look at a Revolutionary War Grave Site\\" New York Times (December 13, 2003) It was supervised by Dr. Joan H. Geismar an archaeological consultant. The original site (block 44, lot 14 Brooklyn) is located on 89 Hudson Ave (formerly Jackson Street: named after an early donor of the property for the Monument in 1808). The goals of the dig were to review if any more human remains could be found on the site and if evidence of the original crypt remained. The site was scheduled for housing development to begin on the site. The Crypt location was specifically identified from an 1855 Perris insurance atlas as well as a mid-19th-century manuscript map found in the National Archives. The work determined that the site at one time contained a deep void, but no foundations were found. They did find a massive stone side wall as well as the likely original post holes for the rail fence. The site development was allowed with a recommendation of a plaque when work was done. The redevelopment of the site was completed and eventually the property changed owners. The status of the plaque is not known and currently there is no plaque on the site. =Renovation and re-dedication ceremony= The city launched the renovation of the Prison Ship Monument with a $3.5 million budget in 2004. The scheduled repairs were plagued by cost overruns and the initial electrical contractor was fired by New York City and needed to be replaced. Additionally, a new spiral staircase was built inside the memorial. A budgetary study was conducted from March 6, 2006 to September 5, 2008 on electrical improvements and the cost estimated to about $341,000. The restored monument was unveiled on November 15, 2008, a centennial celebration, at a rededication ceremony commissioned by the Fort Greene Park Conservancy to celebrate the centennial and re-dedication of the Fort Greene Park Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument. More than 500 people gathered to take part in the relighting of the flame to mark the 100th anniversary. That night, the column and urn were lit by a spectacular lighting scheme. The overall restoration cost for the monument from 2006 to 2008 was an estimated $5,100,000. However, in November 2009, it was noted that the light was again not working. The parks department worked to restore the lights and noted that although the lights were working correctly, there was a programming issue with the light timer. = Snowden statue incident= In April 2015, a group of anonymous vandals illicitly installed a 100-pound statue of Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency whistle blower, atop one of the four columns at the edge of the memorial. It was removed the same day by Parks Department personnel.Associated Press. \\"Bust of Edward Snowden Sneaked Into, Removed From NYC Park\\" The New York Times (April 6, 2015) Description The plaque at the base of the monument Adolf Weinman eagles that stood at the base of the large column until 1966 =Details= * The column: Constructed of granite, its single Doric column in height sits over the crypt at the top of a staircase with 99 steps. When it was built, it was the world's tallest Doric column. The column carries the inscription: \\"1776 THE PRISON SHIP MARTYRS MONUMENT 1908\\". The monument's column contained a staircase accessed by a bronze door. The stone for the monument came from Lacasse quarry, about east of Newport, Vermont.Dale, T. Nelson.

The grand staircase of 100 granite steps rises in three stages. At the foot of the staircase, the entrance to the vault was covered by a slab of brown sandstone, now in storage, that bears the names of the 1808 monument committee and builders, as well as this inscription:New York Art Commission, Catalogue of the Works of Art Belonging to the City of New York (1920), Vol. II, pp. 27‚Äì8.

The top of the urn is glazed with extra heavy plate glass. The inside of the urn contains the mechanics for the lighting. The top had a light, the \\"eternal flame\\".

Around the urn is a bronze railing also cast at Whale Creek Iron Works. * Eagles: Four open-winged eagles stood at the corners of the square terrace at the column's base, each on its own pedestal in front of a Doric column. They were designed by Adolf Weinman, who also designed the six-ton brazier that sits upon the monument's principal column.Gordon, David. \\"Fort Greene Park to Get Lost Eagles\\" New York Times (March 10, 1974). Accessed: January 17, 2012 * Vault: The crypt is in a vault at the base of the stairs. Inside the vault the floor is made of concrete and the walls and ceiling are a bisque-colored brick. One enters the crypt through a copper-clad door. When entering it is three steps down and then a short passageway into the hill and at the end of the passage is the brick-lined crypt. The crypt is approximately square. There are a series of slate coffins inserted into a double-set of shelves on the right and left.\\"Prison Ship Martyrs Monument, Fort Greene, Brooklyn\\" on the RootsWeb website Various bones are said to be sorted by type into different coffins, presumably because individual bodies could not be identified and re-assembled for burial. =Monument additions= A plaque was added in 1960 located across from the front label on the monument. The plaque reads: During the Bicentennial Year ‚Äì 1976, King Juan Carlos of Spain dedicated a plaque honoring the 700 Spaniards who died on the prison ships. Currently surrounding the monument are secured exhibits explaining the history of the prison ships, the Battle of Brooklyn and a list of the 8,000 known martyrs. It is not documented when these exhibits were added. Near the monument, a small building designed to coordinate with the work of McKim, Mead, and White once provided restroom facilities but was re-purposed as a visitors' center for the park. The visitors center has pictorial exhibits plus displays of Revolutionary War weapons and uniform buttons that have been uncovered in the park over the years. It also houses a list of the 8,000 known prisoners on the ships copied from the records in the British War Department. Current designation and responsibility In the first half of the 20th century efforts were made to seek a national designation. However, the U.S. Department of the Interior declined at the time and noted that the prisoners didn't die at the site itself. Currently, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation is responsible for the preservation and supervision of the monument. A budgetary study was conducted from March 6, 2006, to September 5, 2008, on electrical improvements and the cost estimated at $341,000. The overall restoration cost for the monument from 2006 to 2008 was estimated at $5,100,000.\\"Fort Greene Park: Capital Projects\\" on the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation website. Accessed January 16, 2012 On April 11, 2013, U.S. Congressman Hakeem Jeffries ‚Äì representing parts of Queens and Brooklyn, including Fort Greene ‚Äì introduced the \\"Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument Preservation Act\\" to the United States House of Representatives. The bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to study the suitability and feasibility of designating the Prison Ship Martyr's Monument as a unit of the National Park System. The study would look at what it would cost to run the park and how its proposed designation as a National Park would affect the surrounding area. The House voted on April 28, 2014 to pass the bill in a voice vote. The legislation would authorize a $150,000 study to determine if turning the memorial into a national monument would be feasible.

It remains the longest, and with a maximum speed of nearly , it is one of the fastest that uses a traditional lift hill. Layout Out of the station, the track makes a right hand turn onto the lift hill. Due to the length of the lift hill, it utilizes two chains with separate motors. At the crest of the lift hill, the track plummets down a drop to the ground, before passing over a tall airtime hill. After this hill, the track rises over a tall hill before dropping to the right into a pair of helixes, the first one being clockwise and the second being counterclockwise. Following the second helix, the track maneuvers through the supports of the first helix and third hill and makes a left turn into the midcourse brakes, which start the return trip. The return trip consists of a series of airtime hills, running parallel to the outbound track, before hitting the final brake run next to the base of the lift hill. From the brake run, trains pass through the transfer track and storage area before making a sweeping left turn to return to the station.

Western Kentucky was at the forefront of the fight to integrate college basketball in the 1960s and early 1970s. Haskins served 13 years (1986‚Äì1999) as head coach of the University of Minnesota's men's basketball team, but was forced to resign due to his part in the University of Minnesota basketball scandal.Thamal, Pete ‚Äì Catching Up With Clem, New York Times, 27 March 2008. Due to his actions in the scandal, he was given a seven-year show cause penalty which effectively ended his coaching career.PLUS: COLLEGE BASKETBALL; N.C.A.A. Upholds Haskins Penalties, New York Times, 7 April 2001. Early life Haskins was born and grew up in Campbellsville, Kentucky, the county seat. He is the fifth of eleven children of Charles Columbus and Lucy Edna Haskins, who were sharecroppers. During his freshman and sophomore seasons, he attended the all-black Durham High School (public schools were segregated in the South). In 1961 Haskins attended Taylor County High School, the first African American to do so in the previously segregated system. His younger brother, Merion, was a standout player at the University of Kentucky, graduating in 1977. College career Haskins and teammate Dwight Smith were heavily recruited by Western Kentucky Hilltoppers coach Edgar Diddle and joined the team in 1963. They became the first African- American athletes to play for Western Kentucky. They won the Ohio Valley Conference two years in a row under the direction of the popular WKU head coach John Oldham, who succeeded Diddle their sophomore year. Haskins was the Ohio Valley Conference Player of the Year in 1966. In the 1966 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, the Hilltoppers were 2 points away from defeating Michigan and meeting the University of Kentucky Wildcats in the Mideast regional final. A controversial foul called against Smith during a jump ball put Cazzie Russell on the free throw line for Michigan, where he scored the tying and winning baskets.O'Donnell, Chuck ‚Äì Cazzie Russell: converting two free throws with no time left advanced Michigan in the 1966 NCAA Tournament ‚Äì The Game I'll Never Forget ‚Äì University of Michigan versus Western Kentucky University. Basketball Digest, January/February 2004 issue In 1967, Haskins had broken his wrist in a game against Murray State on February 6. His team still won the Ohio Valley Conference again. In the 1967 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, the #3-ranked Hilltoppers lost to eventual national runner-up Dayton in overtime in the Mideast quarterfinals. NBA career After a successful college career, Haskins was selected by the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the 1967 NBA Draft and by the Kentucky Colonels in the American Basketball Association draft. Haskins played nine years in the NBA with three teams (the Bulls, the Phoenix Suns, and the Washington Bullets). He retired in 1976 due to knee injuries, having tallied 8,743 career points. Coaching career After his NBA career, Haskins returned to Western Kentucky University, first as an assistant coach in 1977 and then as head coach in 1980. As head coach, he led Western Kentucky to two NCAA appearances and one NIT appearance. In 1986, Haskins was hired by the University of Minnesota to rebuild the school's men's basketball program.Weiner, Jay ‚Äì \\"COLLEGE BASKETBALL '87: CLEM HASKINS; FRESH START FOR HASKINS AND MINNESOTA\\". New York Times, February 1, 1987 He led the Gophers to a school-record 31 wins and the Final Four in 1997, winning the Clair Bee Coach of the Year Award in the same year. He also led Minnesota to NIT titles in 1993 and 1998. He joined Lenny Wilkens' staff to coach the United States men's basketball team to the gold medal in the 1996 Summer Olympics. Haskins was known for sitting on a four-legged bar stool at Minnesota home games. Williams Arena has a raised floor which was hard on his knees, and ordinarily the team sits off the floor. Minnesota academic scandal On the day before the 1999 NCAA Tournament, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported allegations by Jan Gangelhoff, the manager of the school's academic counseling office, that she had written more than 400 pieces of coursework (including theme papers, homework assignments and take-home tests) for 18 Golden Gophers players from 1994 to 1998, including the Gophers' run to the Final Four. The Gophers suspended four then-current players, including two starters, for the school's first-round game against Gonzaga (which the Gophers lost). At the time, it was not known whether Haskins was involved. The Pioneer Press was harshly criticized for the timing of their report.Robertson, Lori ‚Äì \\"Body Slam\\" , American Journalism Review, May 1999 The university forced Haskins to resign after the season for his part in violations. Minnesota withdrew its team from postseason consideration for the 1999‚Äì2000 season, docked itself 11 scholarships from 2000 to 2004, and imposed other sanctions on the basketball program. Initially, the university bought out Haskins's contract for $1.5 million. However, it sought to recover funds after learning more about Haskins' activities and, in 2002, a state judge ordered Haskins to return $815,000 of the buyout money. The decision was based on an arbitrator's recommendation and the university's conclusion that Haskins had lied to NCAA investigators and committed fraud by accepting the buyout. The university had learned during its internal investigation that Haskins had paid Gangelhoff $3,000 to write papers for the players. Haskins had initially denied making the payment during an interview in June 1999, but acknowledged it a month later. In October 2000, the NCAA placed the Golden Gophers program on four years' probation, and stripped the school of its wins in the 1994, 1995, and 1997 NCAA Tournaments, as well as its NIT wins in 1996 and 1998. The Gophers were docked an additional five scholarships over three seasons. A few days later, the Big Ten Conference stripped Minnesota of the 1997 conference title and forced it to vacate every regular season game it played from 1993‚Äì94 to 1998‚Äì99. Officially, Minnesota's record for those years is 0‚Äì0. If not for these vacated games, Haskins' 242 wins would rank second on the Golden Gophers' wins list. The NCAA imposed a seven-year \\"show-cause\\" order on Haskins. This meant that he would have to accept sanctions from the NCAA if he ever wanted to coach again, unless his new employer could convince the NCAA that he'd served his punishment. The penalty, the harshest that can be imposed on a coach, was made because Haskins had not only lied about the $3,500 payment, but advised several of the players involved to lie to the NCAA. Since most schools will not even consider hiring a coach with an outstanding \\"show- cause\\" on his record, Haskins was effectively blacklisted from coaching until 2007. After coaching Haskins did not return to coaching when his show- cause expired. He retired to his ranch near Campbellsville, Kentucky, where he raises cattle.Chicago magazine  Former Chicago Athletes: Where Are They Now?

Born in High Wycombe, Stephen was the son of John Taylor, a civil engineer, and his wife Beatrice (Lake) Taylor. Educated at Stowe School and then at St Thomas Hospital Medical School, London, where he qualified in 1934. When war broke out he joined the RNVR as a neuropsychiatrist. But in 1941, the government transferred him to the Ministry of Information. He worked on a plan to publish information about health services to the public during wartime. From 1940 to 1944 he was Director of Home intelligence and the Wartime Social Survey in the Ministry of Information. But by 1944 it appears he was already working for the Labour Party to achieve an electoral victory at the war's end. Successfully elected Member of Parliament for Barnet in July 1945, he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister and Lord President of the Council from 1947. He was an expert policy advisor on the National Health Service. In 1951 he was invited by the Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust to carry out a survey of general practice. He went on to make a significant contribution to the development of general practice, holding a number of positions on medical boards and other organisations, including two stints as a member of Harlow New Town Development Corporation. In 1955 he was appointed medical director to Harlow health Industrial Health Service for a period of nine years. But it appears was in such demand, that two years later resumed his role into retirement. Taylor was instrumental in the creation of Health Centres in Harlow. His model was rolled out to all major city centres across Britain, developing dental and nursing support within group practices. His survey of 1954 entitled Good General Practice was based on qualitative interviews at practices already identified as performing well by Joseph Collings report, General Practice in England : A Reconnaissance, (1950). NHS GP profession was still in its infancy, requiring much pioneering work to improve its services. Taylor sat on the Central Health Services Council, chaired by Sir Harry Cohen, the boss of Tesco. Local doctors had traditionally worked alone or in pairs, but the report resulted in group practice becoming the norm in Britain. House of Lords On 7 August 1958, he was created a life peer by letters patent as Baron Taylor, of Harlow in the County of Essex on Gaitskell's recommendation. In 1962, he mediated the end to the Saskatchewan doctors' strike in Saskatchewan, Canada. From 1964 he served the Labour government as Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. Lord Taylor objected to Labour's efforts to \\"abolish private medical practice, to prevent part-time medical work within the NHS and to abolish education...by destroying freedom of choice.\\" He resigned from Labour Party in 1981 to sit with the Social Democratic Party.The Times, 'Peer Leaves Labour', 8 July 1981. Lord Taylor was also President and Vice-Chancellor of Memorial University of Newfoundland from 1967 to 1973.

Early career Francisco Saavedra was born in Seville, Spain, in 1746, and trained as a doctor. He served alongside Bernardo de G√°lvez in Spain's military campaign at Algiers in the 1770s, and through him changed career to work in Spain's Ministry of the Indies, principally as a financial planner. In 1780 he was sent to try to sort out the Spanish administration at Havana in Cuba, with the additional task of working alongside G√°lvez once more, to retake Florida from British control. When the ship taking him to the Caribbean was captured by the British, Saavedra passed himself off as a merchant, and was allowed free movement within Jamaica (the British being completely unaware that just two years earlier he had been involved in planning for a future Spanish invasion of the island). He took the opportunity to find out all he could about Jamaica's ports, defences etc. A thoughtful and prescient man, he recorded in his diary in 1780: > What is not being thought about at present, what ought to occupy the whole > attention of politics, is the great upheaval that in time the North American > revolution is going to produce in the human race. Saavedra and Yorktown In January 1781 he was finally released by the British, and began work in Havana. After making initial recommendations for administrative changes, over the next few months he helped to organise, and actually took part in G√°lvez' successful siege of Pensacola, the key British base in Florida. On his return he found that his recommendations had been accepted by the Spanish government, and key officials had been replaced. In July, at the request of the Minister (Jos√© de G√°lvez, Bernardo's uncle), Saavedra, who spoke and wrote French fluently, met in the French colony of St. Domingue with Admiral de Grasse to discuss the best ways of using the large French fleet he had brought across the Atlantic, and they agreed a plan for the following year, known as the Grasse-Saavedra Convention. First priority was to aid the French and American forces in the United States, preferably by attacking the British force in Virginia under Lord Cornwallis. Next was to regain control of Caribbean islands captured by the British. The final goal of the plan was the capture of Jamaica, by far the richest British possession in the West Indies. To finance phase 1, Saavedra obtained 100,000 pesos from the Spanish treasury in neighboring Santo Domingo. The Spanish had planned to finance the French and North Americans with pesos shipped through Veracruz from the mines in Mexico. The ships had not arrived, and then, finding that most of the Government money from Havana had been sent on to Spain, he appealed to Cuban citizens, who raised a further 500,000 pesos in a matter of hours. Francisco Saavedra (Prado museum). Later career Over the next few months, while De Grasse went ahead with the plan, Saavedra made detailed preparations for the invasion of Jamaica. The defeat of the French fleet at the Battle of the Saintes in April 1782 was a major setback, but preparations continued. However, by the end of 1782 the Spanish government decided to abandon what looked likely to be a very costly project. From 1783 to 1788, Saavedra served as intendant of Caracas, following which he returned to Spain and became first a member of the Supreme War Council, then in 1797 Finance Minister, and the following year, Minister of State. However, his health was failing, so shortly afterwards he retired to Andalucia, only to come back to service in 1810 when Napoleon's French forces invaded Spain. He died on 25 November 1819.

In 1751 he co-founded the Pennsylvania Hospital, the first medical facility in the American colonies, with Benjamin Franklin, and also volunteered his services there as both physician and teacher. Education and professional life Bond was born in Calvert County, Maryland, the third of five sons of Richard Bond and Elizabeth Chew (n√©e Benson). The family moved to Philadelphia while Thomas was still a young man. He began his medical training in Annapolis but traveled to Paris and England in 1738 to complete it. He returned to Philadelphia in 1739, and two years later was made Port Inspector for Contagious Diseases in that city. In 1743, he helped his long-time friend Benjamin Franklin establish the American Philosophical Society. Having formed a favorable opinion of British hospitals in the course of his studies, Bond began trying to raise funds in 1750 to establish a place of care for both the sick and the mentally ill, particularly for the poor. Unable to raise the funds himself, he turned to his friend Franklin, who had more success. Together they co-founded the Pennsylvania Hospital, which is located on Eighth and Pine Streets in Philadelphia. The hospital quickly drew attention as a center for medical advancement, especially in maternity care and the humane treatment of mental illness, a poorly understood area of medicine at the time. Bond volunteered his services as a surgeon at this facility for more than three decades, from the year of its founding until he died. Some years after the hospital opened, he was joined there by his younger brother, Phineas Bond, who was also a skilled physician. Dr. Bond earned a high reputation as a surgeon, especially for amputations and bladder stone operations. Many patients traveled considerable distances (from as far away as Boston) to avail themselves of his surgical care. He performed the first lithotomy in the United States at Pennsylvania Hospital in October 1756 and developed a splint for fractures of the lower arm, known as a \\"Bond splint.\\" In 1737, he was also one of seven physicians to publicly recommend inoculation against smallpox. Thomas Bond also served as trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, where, in 1766, he began clinical lectures for the benefit of medical students. These formal lectures supplemented the bedside clinical instruction he conducted in the hospital. For his learning and pedagogy, he earned the title, \\"Father of Clinical Medicine.\\" The alumni association of the Pennsylvania Hospital is today known as the Thomas Bond Society. Service during the Revolutionary War When the American Revolutionary War broke out, the sixty-three-year-old doctor along with his son, helped to organize the medical department of the Continental Army. He established the first American field hospitals during the conflict. He was also a member of the local Committee of Safety during the war. He served as personal physician to Deborah Read, Benjamin Franklin's wife, and attended her during her final illness while Franklin was in France. Personal life Thomas Bond gravestone epitaph in Christ Church Burial Ground, Philadelphia Thomas Bond was a Quaker. His first wife, Susannah Roberts, was the daughter of Edward Roberts, the mayor of Philadelphia. They married in 1735, and with her he had two children. He remarried after her early death and had seven children by Sarah Weyman, among whom was another Dr. Thomas Bond. He is buried in Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia. His epitaph reads: \\"In Memory of Thomas Bond, MD who practiced Physic and Surgery with signal reputation and success nearly half a century. Lamented and beloved by many, respected and esteemed by all, and adorned by literary honors sustained by him with dignity.\\" Trivia His home at 129 South 2nd Street in Philadelphia is now a bed & breakfast, called simply Thomas Bond House. A letter written on August 24, 1781 by Dr. Bond provides an early (and possibly the earliest) reference to the production of morphine in the United States. He wrote to a Pennsylvania farmer, \\"The opium you sent is pure and of good quality. I hope you will take care of the seed.\\" Proceedings, American Pharmaceutical Association, 13 (1865): 51.

Edward Elgar Publishing. p. 326 In 1974 he obtained his Ph.D. in economics (cum laude) at the University of Groningen with the thesis \\"New scarcity and economic growth: More welfare through less production?\\" under supervision of Jan Pen. In 1959 he started as assistant public accountant. From 1962 till 1969 he was labour market researcher at the Ministry of Social Affairs, and from 1965 till 1968 at the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning. After joining the Statistics Netherlands in 1969 he founded its Department of Environmental Statistics. Until his retirement in 1994 he chaired the Department for Environmental Statistics. In 1991 he was decorated Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau, and in 1994 awarded the United Nation Global 500 award.  Work  Hueting developed the theoretical and practical framework of the Sustainable national income (SNI). Already in 1970 he published a collection of articles over the years 1967-1970 titled: ‚ÄúWhat is nature worth to us?‚Äù. He has analyzed the environment from the neoclassical point of view of scarcity and developed the concept of Sustainable National Income (SNI). The implication of the SNI is that the statistical measure of economic growth is revised.  Economics and the environment  The concept of sustainability was presented for the first time at The World Conservation Strategy, IUCN,http://www.iucn.org/en/about/ 1980: \\"This is the kind of development that provides real improvements in the quality of human life and at the same time conserves the vitality and diversity of the Earth. The goal is development that will be sustainable. Today it may seem visionary but it is attainable. To more and more people it also appears our only rational option\\". (UNEP, IUCN, WWF) There are various possible descriptions of this area of research but a good one is provided as follows: :\\"The increase in human numbers and economic activity has put Homo Sapiens in a position to influence nearly every flow of energy and matter on Earth. Explaining the extent and impacts of this influence is well beyond the theory and analytical tools of individual disciplines, such as economics or ecology. A new interdisciplinary approach is needed, one that unites the relevant aspects of different disciplines... :The theory and tools necessary to understand the relation among human populations, natural resources, the environment, and economic growth are brought together in the discipline of ecological economics. Ecological economics emphasizes the flow of matter and energy among socioeconomic systems and their environment. The methods of ecological economics can be used to provide a more thorough understanding of economy-environment interactions than that offered by a traditional economic analysis\\"(Quoted from Boston University) Examples of ecological suicide are given by Jared Diamond in his book Collapse. Neoclassical economics finds opposition from ecological economics, while that opposition would be less needed due to Hueting's more neoclassical analysis of the environment. The neoclassical SNI has different results than e.g. Robert Costanza et al. (1997).Robert Costanza et al. (1997), \\"The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital\\", Nature 387:253-260. This suggests that more discipline is required in this discipline.

The parish includes the hamlet of Sherborne. Very close to the village are the Litton Reservoirs.  History  Litton was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Litune, meaning 'The small enclosure' from the Old English lyt and tun. It was the property of Gisa, Bishop of Wells. The shape of some of the existing fields with cross- slope and down-slope field banks and cultivated ridges forming an interleaving irregular mosaic suggest they are of medieval origin. The parish was part of the hundred of Wells Forum.  Governance  The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. An aerial view of the village and the surrounding area. Litton is part of the Nedge Ward, which is represented by one councillor on the Non- metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Clutton Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Wells county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.  Demographics  According to the 2001 Census, the Nedge Ward (which includes Chewton Mendip), had 2,074 residents, living in 893 households, with an average age of 40.0 years. Of these 78% of residents describing their health as 'good', 18% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no qualifications; and the area had an unemployment rate of 1.8% of all economically active people aged 16‚Äì74.

While this practice is primarily used by chiropractors, AK is also used by a number of other practitioners of complementary therapy. In 2003, it was the 10th most frequently used chiropractic technique in the United States, with 37.6% of chiropractors employing this method and 12.9% of patients being treated with it. Some basic AK based techniques have also been used by nutritional supplement distributors, including multilevel distributors.Applied Kinesiology: Phony Muscle-Testing for \\"Allergies\\" and \\"Nutrient Deficiencies\\" , by Stephen Barrett, MD  Claims Applied kinesiology is presented as a system that evaluates structural, chemical, and mental aspects of health by using a method referred to as muscle response testing or manual muscle testing (MMT) alongside conventional diagnostic methods. The essential premise of applied kinesiology, which is not shared by mainstream medical theory, is that every organ dysfunction is accompanied by a weakness in a specific corresponding muscle in what is termed the \\"viscerosomatic relationship.\\" Treatment modalities relied upon by AK practitioners include joint manipulation and mobilization, myofascial, cranial and meridian therapies, clinical nutrition, and dietary counseling.  Muscle testing  A manual muscle test in AK is conducted by having the patient resist using the target muscle or muscle group while the practitioner applies a force. A smooth response is sometimes referred to as a \\"strong muscle\\" and a response that was not appropriate is sometimes called a \\"weak response\\". This is not a raw test of strength, but rather a subjective evaluation of tension in the muscle and smoothness of response, taken to be indicative of a difference in spindle cell response during contraction. These differences in muscle response are claimed to be indicative of various stresses and imbalances in the body. A weak muscle test is equated to dysfunction and chemical or structural imbalance or mental stress, indicative of suboptimal functioning. It may be suboptimal functioning of the tested target muscle, or a normally optimally functioning muscle can be used as an indicator muscle for other physiological testing. A commonly known and very basic test is the arm- pull-down test, or \\"Delta test,\\" where the patient resists as the practitioner exerts a downward force on an extended arm.Frost, Robert, Applied Kinesiology: A Training Manual and Reference Book of Basic Principles and Practices', p. 4, North Atlantic Books, 2002. available online Proper positioning is paramount to ensure that the muscle in question is isolated or positioned as the prime mover, minimizing interference from adjacent muscle groups.  Nutrient testing  Nutrient testing is used to examine the response of various patient's muscles to assorted chemicals. Gustatory and olfactory stimulation are said to alter the outcome of a manual muscle test, with previously weak muscles being strengthened by application of the correct nutritional supplement, and previously strong muscles being weakened by exposure to harmful or imbalancing substances or allergens. Though its use is deprecated by the ICAK, stimulation to test muscle response to a certain chemical is also done by contact or proximity (for instance, testing while the patient holds a bottle of pills).  Therapy localization  Therapy localization is another diagnostic technique using manual muscle testing which is unique to applied kinesiology. The patient places a hand which is not being tested on the skin over an area suspected to be in need of therapeutic attention. This fingertip contact may lead to a change in muscle response from strong to weak or vice versa when therapeutic intervention is indicated. If the area touched is not associated with a need for such intervention, the muscle response is unaffected.  Scientific research  In 2015 the Australian Government's Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance; applied kinesiology was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found. According to the American Cancer Society, \\"available scientific evidence does not support the claim that applied kinesiology can diagnose or treat cancer or other illness\\". A review of several scientific studies of AK-specific procedures and diagnostic tests concluded: \\"When AK is disentangled from standard orthopedic muscle testing, the few studies evaluating unique AK procedures either refute or cannot support the validity of AK procedures as diagnostic tests. The evidence to date does not support the use of manual muscle testing for the diagnosis of organic disease or pre/subclinical conditions.\\" Another concluded that \\"There is little or no scientific rationale for these methods. Results are not reproducible when subject to rigorous testing and do not correlate with clinical evidence of allergy.\\" A double-blind study was conducted by the ALTA Foundation for Sports Medicine Research in Santa Monica, California, and published in the June 1988 Journal of the American Dietetic Association. The study used three experienced AK practitioners and concluded that, \\"The results of this study indicated that the use of applied kinesiology to evaluate nutrient status is no more useful than random guessing.\\" Despite more than four decades of review, RCT (randomized, controlled trials) and other evaluative methods, even invested researchers delivered the following opinion: > \\"One shortcoming is the lack of RCTs to substantiate (or refute) the > clinical utility (efficacy, effectiveness) of chiropractic interventions > based on MMT findings. Also, because the etiology of a muscle weakness may > be multifactorial, any RCT that employs only one mode of therapy to only one > area of the body may produce outcomes that are poor due to these > limitations.\\"  Criticism  Nearly all AK tests are subjective, relying solely on practitioner assessment of muscle response. Specifically, some studies have shown test-retest reliability, inter-tester reliability, and accuracy to have no better than chance correlations. Some skeptics have argued that there is no scientific understanding of the proposed underlying theory of a viscerosomatic relationship, and the efficacy of the modality is unestablished in some cases and doubtful in others. Skeptics have also dismissed AK as \\"quackery,\\" \\"magical thinking,\\" and a misinterpretation of the ideomotor effect.Magical Thinking. Skeptic's Dictionary It has also been criticized on theoretical and empirical grounds, and characterized as pseudoscience. With only anecdotal accounts claiming to provide positive evidence for the efficacy of the practice, a review of peer-reviewed studies concluded that the \\"evidence to date does not support the use of [AK] for the diagnosis of organic disease or pre/subclinical conditions.\\"  Position statements  Allergy diagnosis In the US, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases have both advised that applied kinesiology should not be used in the diagnosis of allergies. The European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology, the National Institute for Clinical ExcellenceNICE consults on draft guideline on food allergies in children of the UK, the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy and the Allergy Society of South Africa has also advised similarly. The World Allergy Organization does not have a formal position on applied kinesiology, but in educational materials from its Global Resources In Allergy program it lists applied kinesiology as an unproven test and describes it as useless. In 1998, a small pilot study published in the International Journal of Neuroscience showed a correlation between applied kinesiology muscle testings and serum immunoglobulin levels for food allergies. 19 of 21 (90.5%) suspected food allergies diagnosed by applied kinesiology were confirmed by serum immunoglobulin tests. A follow up review published in 2005 in the Current Opinion of Allergy and Clinical Immunology concluded applied kinesiology had no proven basis for diagnosis. American Chiropractic Association According to the American Chiropractic Association, in 2003 applied kinesiology was the 10th most frequently used chiropractic technique in the United States, with 37.6% of chiropractors employing this method and 12.9% of patients being treated with it. They describe AK as follows:  Danish Chiropractic Association  According to a March 26, 1998, letter from the DKF (Dansk Kiropraktor Forening ‚Äì Danish Chiropractic Association), following public complaints from patients receiving homeopathic care and/or AK instead of standard (DKF defined) chiropractic care, the DKF has determined that applied kinesiology is not a form of chiropractic care and must not be presented to the public as such. AK and homeopathy can continue to be practiced by chiropractors as long as it is noted to be alternative and adjunctive to chiropractic care and is not performed in a chiropractic clinic. Chiropractors may not infer or imply that the Danish chiropractic profession endorses AK to be legitimate or effective, nor may the word/title chiropractic/chiropractor be used or associated with the practice of AK.Danish Chiropractic Association position  See also  * Ideomotor effect * List of ineffective cancer treatments * List of topics characterized as pseudoscience * Nambudripad Allergy Elimination Technique * Observer-expectancy effect  References   External links   Promotional sites  * The International Journal of Applied Kinesiology and Kinesiologic Medicine  Skeptical evaluations  * Applied Kinesiology: Muscle-Testing for \\"Allergies\\" and \\"Nutrient Deficiencies\\" by Stephen Barrett, Quackwatch * Applied Kinesiology by William T.

Early life He was born at Gie√üen, in Hesse-Darmstadt, Germany, to Christoph Follenius (1759-1833) and Rosine Follenius (1766‚Äì1799). His father was a counselor-at-law and judge. He was the brother of August Ludwig Follen and Charles Follen, and the uncle of the biologist Carl Vogt. During his studies at the University of Gie√üen he became friends with Friedrich Muench and in 1825 married Muench's sister Maria. Gottfried Duden Philanthropist Gottfried Duden, a German attorney, settled on the north side of the Missouri River along Lake Creek in 1824. He was investigating the possibilities of settlement in the area by his countrymen. In 1827 he returned to Germany, which he felt was overpopulated. There he published Bericht √ºber eine Reise nach den westlichen Staaten Nordamerika's (\\"Report of a Journey to the Western states of North America\\") in 1829. Friedrick M√ºnch The description of the free life in the US, by Duden, motivated the Protestant minister Friedrich M√ºnch and Follenius to found the Gie√üener Auswanderungsgesellschaft in 1832. Both had participated in the outlawed republican and democratic movements in Germany in the wake of the French July Revolution of 1832. As there was no immediate hope for success, they intended to establish a \\"new and free Germany in the great North American Republic\\" to serve as model for a future German republic. The Giessen Society was stillborn on its arrival in the United States in 1834. Follenius and Muench dissolved the society upon their meeting in St. Louis. It is important to note that they never intended to create any sort of \\"utopia\\" in America. They intended to fully participate in democracy as constituted in the United States. It was, after all, where THE experiment in enlightened government was playing out, and they wanted to be part of it. Follenius and Muench were merely searching for freedom. They planned to be bilingual from the start, which shows that they did not expect to be situated apart from the rest of U.S. society. Muench would eventually serve as a state senator in Missouri during the Civil War, and his brother, Georg, would turn down nomination to the state legislature for health reasons. Paul Follenius died of disease 10 years after emigrating to the United States. German settlers In 1834 they led 500 German settlers into Missouri. They soon realized that their plan for a separate federal state was untenable. They settled in the German populated Dutzow in Warren County, Missouri not far from the former farm of Gottfried Duden. Follenius died in Dutzow. His son Dr. William Follenius (1829‚Äì1902) married Emilie, a daughter of his friend, Friedrich Muench. His brother Karl had emigrated to the US already in 1824.

In 1990, its bird hospital was called \\"the largest wild bird hospital in North America\\". The sanctuary operated solely on private donations and was the largest not-for-profit wild bird sanctuary and rehabilitation center in the United States. The sanctuary was dedicated to the Rescue, Repair, Rehabilitation and Release of sick and/or injured wild birds, and provided a permanent home to non-releasable birds in a safe and healthy environment. In January, 2013, the sanctuary experienced a staff walk-out due to non-payment of wages. The sanctuary remained open, thanks to the tireless efforts of a handful of dedicated individuals. In April 2013, the Sumter Disaster Animal Rescue Team helped the Sanctuary refurbish and prep the wild bird hospital to reopen. Due to a legal settlement in September 2016, the Suncoast Seabird Sanctuary ceased operations and closed after 45 years of service. Following the closing of Suncoast, a new non-profit organization called the Seaside Seabird Sanctuary moved into the same Indian Shores location. The new organization rescues and rehabilitates birds from all over the Tampa Bay area. Continued relationships in the community with veterinarians, wildlife experts and volunteers has kept the sanctuary viable.

Early career Butz played high school football at Maine South High School in Park Ridge, Illinois, where he was two-time high school All-American. He also played basketball and was the Illinois High School discus champion, setting a state record. He then played college football at Purdue University, where he was a 1972 finalist for the Lombardi Award. He was a 1st team All-Big Ten member and played in both the East-West Shrine Game and Senior Bowl, where he was named the Defensive MVP. At the victory parade following the Redskins win in Super Bowl XXII, Butz famously shouted to the crowd, \\"We came, we saw, we kicked their butz.\\" Butz was later named to Purdue's All Time Football team and was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2014. Professional career Butz was drafted in the first round (fifth overall) of the 1973 NFL Draft by the St. Louis Cardinals, where he would play for two seasons. Redskins coach George Allen gave the Cardinals two first-round draft picks and a second-rounder for the right to Butz. Butz then played for the Washington Redskins for 14 years, where he had three Super Bowl appearances. He ranks third in franchise history in sacks (59.5). He was a one time Pro Bowler in 1983 in a season in which he got eleven sacks, a career-best. He only missed four games in his entire 16-year career. Butz was among the largest players in the NFL when he played standing 6'8\\" and routinely weighing around 300 pounds. When he retired, he was the oldest starting player in the NFL. Butz was selected to the NFL 1980s All-Decade Team and was named one of the 70 Greatest Redskins. In 1975 Butz was granted free agency due to a mistake in his contract that he signed as a rookie in 1973. George Allen quickly signed him, but the NFL ruled that the Redskins had to pay the Cardinals 2 first-round picks (1977 & 1978) and a second-round pick (1979). After football Butz has recently served as a consultant and board member for the National Rifle Association. Family Butz lives in Fairfax, Virginia.

The RQ-11 Raven was originally introduced as the FQM-151 in 1999, but in 2002 developed into its current form, resembling an enlarged FAI class F1C free flight model aircraft in general appearance. The craft is launched by hand and powered by a pusher configuration electric motor. The plane can fly up to at altitudes of appx above ground level (AGL), and over above mean sea level (MSL), at flying speeds of 28‚Äì60 mph (45‚Äì97 km/h). The U.S. Army deploys the Raven at company- level.Mini Drones Win Soldier Praise at Army Experiment - Kitup.Military.com, 6 March 2015 Design and development The Raven RQ-11B UAS is manufactured by AeroVironment. It was the winner of the US Army's SUAV program in 2005, and went into Full-Rate Production (FRP) in 2006. Shortly afterwards, it was also adopted by the US Marines, and the US Air Force for their ongoing FPASS Program. It has also been adopted by the military forces of many other countries (see below). More than 19,000 Raven airframes have been delivered to customers worldwide to date. A new Digital Data Link-enabled version of Raven now in production for US Forces and allies has improved endurance, among many other improvements. The Raven can be either remotely controlled from the ground station or fly completely autonomous missions using GPS waypoint navigation. The UA can be ordered to immediately return to its launch point by pressing a single command button. Standard mission payloads include CCD color video cameras and an infrared night vision camera. The RQ-11B Raven UA weighs about 1.9 kg (4.2 lb), has a flight endurance of 60‚Äì90 minutes and an effective operational radius of approximately 10 km (6.2 miles). The RQ-11B Raven UA is launched by hand, thrown into the air like a free flight model airplane. The Raven lands itself by auto-piloting to a pre-defined landing point and then performing a 45¬∞ slope (1 foot down for every 1 foot forward) controlled \\"Autoland\\" descent. The UAS can provide day or night aerial intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance. In mid-2015, the US Marine Corps tested Harris Corporation's Small Secure Data Link (SSDL), a radio device that fits onto a Raven's nose to provide beyond line-of-sight communications for Marines down to squad level. Acting as communications nodes for ground forces has become an important function for UASs, but has been restricted to larger platforms like the RQ-4 Global Hawk or RQ-21 Blackjack. Being certified for 'Secret' classification and at just (measuring 3 in √ó 5.3 in √ó 1.6 in) and weighing , the Harris SSDL allows the small Raven UAS to extend communications for troops in the field.Data link lets small UAVs serve as secure comm nodes ‚Äì Defensesystems.com, 1 July 2015 In August 2015 selected units began receiving upgrades to their Raven sensors.

As of early 2012, over 19,000 airframes have already been shipped, making it the most widely adopted UAV system in the world today. The British forces in Iraq used Raven equipment. The Royal Danish Army acquired 12 Raven systems in September 2007; three systems will be delivered to the Huntsmen Corps, while the remainder will be deployed with soldiers from the Artillery Training Center. A 2010 documentary film, Armadillo, shows Danish forces deploying a Raven in operations around FOB Armadillo in the Helmand province of Afghanistan. The drone also makes an appearance being used by the SEAL operators in the 2012 film Act of Valor. The Netherlands MoD has acquired 72 operational RQ-11B systems with a total value of $23.74 million for use within Army reconnaissance units, its Marine Corps and its Special Forces (KCT). At the turn of the year 2009 to 2010 the systems were deployed above the village Veen, as part of the Intensification of Civil-Military Cooperation. In 2012 and 2013 the Raven was loaned by the Defense department to the police department of Almere to combat burglary. In April 2011, the U.S. announced that it would be supplying 85 Raven B systems to the Pakistan Army. In June 2011, the U.S. announced $145.4 million in proposed aid for anti- terror efforts in north and east Africa, including four Raven systems to be used by forces from Uganda and Burundi as part of the ongoing African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia.

It was programmed by Larry Kaplan who left Atari to co-found Activision the same year. The game is an interpretation of the sport bowling, playable by one or two players. Gameplay In all six variations, games last for 10 frames, or turns. At the start of each frame, the current player is given two chances to roll a bowling ball down an alley in an attempt to knock down as many of the ten bowling pins as possible. The bowler (on the left side of the screen) may move up and down his end of the alley to aim before releasing the ball. In four of the game's six variations, the ball can be steered before it hits the pins. Knocking down every pin on the first shot is a strike, while knocking every pin down in both shots is a spare. The player's score is determined by the number of pins knocked down in all 10 frames, as well as the number of strikes and spares acquired. Variations Odd-numbered variants are one player games, while two players alternate on frames in even-numbered games. * Games 1/2: The bowling ball can be moved in one direction after being thrown. * Games 3/4: The bowling ball can be moved up and down after being thrown. * Games 5/6: The ball moves straight and cannot be moved. Reception Bowling was reviewed by Video magazine in its \\"Arcade Alley\\" column where it was praised as \\"an enjoyable version of a sport that is perfectly suited to the video arcade format\\". The reviewers singled out the graphics (including the automatic frame-by-frame scoring and \\"deft\\" character animation) as \\"one of the game's best points\\".

It is situated near the giant mall City Syd and the schools of KVT and Tiller. It harbors the grades 1-10 and therefore covers both the primary and the lower secondary role. History The school was built in 1986, by the same architects who designed Rostenhallen (the neighbouring sports arena) the following year. The school is designed to be an open classroom-landscape, and the structure is two U-shaped buildings knit together by a glass-roof and separated by an indoor \\"street\\", which according to the architects acts as a stimulative and attractive place of study. This design was not common in schools earlier, and Rosten is therefore seen as a model for other schools. The buildings create two schoolyards; one to the south and one to the north. Although the school is built squarely with a flat roof, it is compensated by the materials used; red, warm brick and blue windows. These materials reappear in the two neighbouring structures of Rostenhallen and Tiller, and creates a visual unity between them.

He is the author of three books focused on the southern Appalachians--A Fly Fisherman's Blue Ridge (Henry Holt, 1990), Another Country: Journeying Toward the Cherokee Mountains (Henry Holt, 1997), Hunting from Home: A Year Afield in the Blue Ridge (W. W. Norton, 2003) and of Time and Tide in Acadia: Seasons on Mount Desert Island (W. W. Norton, 2009). He worked under the editorship of William Strachan at Henry Holt and of Amy Cherry at Norton. His second book, Another Country, is perhaps his most complex, interweaving historical accounts of the southern Appalachians, reflections on the Cherokee language and its relationship to the landscape, and an account of efforts to reintroduce the endangered red wolf into Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Since 1995 Camuto has been the book review columnist for Gray's Sporting Journal, where he comments six times a year on sporting literature and art. Since 1998 he had written the quarterly \\"Watersheds\\" column, which he created, for Trout Unlimited's Trout. He was the book review columnist for Audubon from 1999-2002 and has written for a wide range of periodicals devoted to nature and the environment, including American Rivers, Audubon, The Boston Globe, Chesapeake Bay Journal, Field & Stream, Flyfishing, Fly Fisherman, Gray's Sporting Journal, Sewanee Review, Sierra, Sports Afield, Trout, Weber Studies in the Environment, and Wilderness. Camuto's work has been anthologized in a number of books devoted to distinguished nature writing, including The Gift of Trout (Lyons and Burford, 1996), The Height of Our Mountains: Nature Writing from Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains and Shenandoah Valley (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998), In Praise of Wild Trout (The Lyons Press, 1998), The Woods Stretched for Miles: Contemporary Southern Nature Writing (The University of Georgia Press, 1999), Uncommon Wealth: Essays on Virginia's Wild Places (Falcon Press, 1999), The Greatest Fishing Stories Ever Told (The Lyons Press, 2000), Into the Backing (The Lyons Press, 2001), Elemental South: Earth, Air, Fire and Water (The University of Georgia Press, 2004), Bartram's Living Legacy (Mercer University Press, 2010), and Afield: American Writers on Bird Dogs (Skyhorse Press, 2010). He wrote the introduction for the West Virginia University Press reprint, published in 2011, of Julia Davis' 1945 The Shenandoah, one of the titles in the celebrated Rivers of America series (1937-1974). In the 1990s, Camuto was instrumental in publicizing the acidification of southern Appalachian headwater streams, most notably in an extended feature in the Winter 1991 Trout: \\"Dropping Acid in the Southern Appalachians: A Wild Trout Resource at Considerable Risk.\\" During the 1980s and 1990s, he worked, as a writer and activist, on the controversies surrounding management of public forest lands in the southeast, especially the protection, preservation and restoration of coldwater streams and the preservation of roadless areas on national forest land. He is associated with the Southern Nature Project (www.southernnature.org), has done work on behalf of American Rivers, the Izaak Walton League, The Nature Conservancy, the Sierra Club, the Southern Appalachian Forest Coalition, Trout Unlimited, The Wilderness Society, and other environmental organizations. In the 1970s, he worked on behalf of migrant and seasonal farmworkers on the eastern shore of Virginia. A native New Yorker and a long-time resident of Virginia (the Eastern Shore, Albemarle and Rockbridge counties), Camuto currently lives at Wolftree Farm in Union County, Pennsylvania, a hard-used but biologically diverse 78-acre woodland he acquired in 2005 and which has become an eco- restoration project in progress. Located near the foot of Buffalo Mountain, between state-owned forest land and private farmland, the property is an instructive example of the condition of private woodlands in central Pennsylvania. Despite its name, Wolftree Farm is for the most part re-grown woodland rather than tillable land, its succession toward mature woods having been defeated repeatedly by select (high-grade) logging in past decades. Working on his own, Camuto is striving to mitigate the effects of this logging, inroads of invasive species, and ill-conceived white and red pine plantings from the 1960s. He is trying to encourage a naturally diverse mix of native hardwoods‚Äîwalnut, oak, hickory, black cherry‚Äîalong with a healthy understory of native shrubs. Despite its problems, the property is diverse in birdlife (over a hundred species) and wildlife (including black bear, wild turkey, ruffed grouse). Camuto hopes to establish the property as a nature preserve. He has established a modest homestead on land he cleared, including a cedar log house he partly built himself near the abandoned home site of one James Glover (1824-1898), grandson of John Glover, Sr., an eighteenth-century Irish immigrant to America and an early (1772) white settler in what became Hartley Township, Pennsylvania. This homestead and woodland are now the center of Camuto's new work in nonfiction, fiction and poetry, including Works and Days: Notes on a Woodland Farm (nonfiction), A Hunter's Book of Hours (poetry), Sympathy for the Settler (poetry), Amygdala: Stories (fiction) and A Dream of Darwin (prose/poetry). In recent years, Camuto has also been exploring his ancestral roots in Italy and the Mediterranean world. He is at work on a book of essays about his grandparents' connections to the Italian landscape‚Äîin Sicily (Bronte), in Basilicata (Melfi, Potenza, San Costantino Albanese) and Como‚Äîand a volume of poetry, Learning to Travel, about travel related to Magna Graecia, pre-Socratic philosophy, and classical Western literature, all of which are strong influences on his life, writing and teaching. He maintains close ties to the relations of his paternal grandmother, Delores Scutari, who live in Potenza, Senise and San Costantino Albanese, one of Basilicata's Arberesche mountain villages. Through his maternal grandmother, Mary Bocchetta Zanini, he is related to Vittore Bocchetta‚ÄîItalian sculptor, painter, scholar and anti-Fascist resistance fighter in World War II.

Groups with operators were extensively studied by Emmy Noether and her school in the 1920s. She employed the concept in her original formulation of the three Noether isomorphism theorems.  Definition  A group with operators (G, \\\\Omega) can be defined as a group G = (G, \\\\cdot) together with an action of a set \\\\Omega on G: :\\\\Omega \\\\times G \\\\rightarrow G : (\\\\omega , g) \\\\mapsto g^{\\\\omega} that is distributive relative to the group law: :(g \\\\cdot h)^{\\\\omega} = g^{\\\\omega} \\\\cdot h^{\\\\omega}. For each \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega , the application g \\\\mapsto g^{\\\\omega} is then an endomorphism of G. From this, it results that a Œ©-group can also be viewed as a group G with an indexed family (u_{\\\\omega})_{\\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega} of endomorphisms of G. \\\\Omega is called the operator domain. The associate endomorphisms are called the homotheties of G. Given two groups G, H with same operator domain \\\\Omega, a homomorphism of groups with operators is a group homomorphism \\\\phi: G \\\\to H satisfying :\\\\phi(g^\\\\omega)=(\\\\phi(g))^\\\\omega for all \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega and g \\\\in G. A subgroup S of G is called a stable subgroup, \\\\omega-subgroup or \\\\Omega-invariant subgroup if it respects the homotheties, that is :s^\\\\omega \\\\in S for all s \\\\in S and \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega.  Category-theoretic remarks  In category theory, a group with operators can be defined as an object of a functor category GrpM where M is a monoid (i.e. a category with one object) and Grp denotes the category of groups. This definition is equivalent to the previous one, provided \\\\Omega is a monoid (otherwise we may expand it to include the identity and all compositions). A morphism in this category is a natural transformation between two functors (i.e. two groups with operators sharing same operator domain M). Again we recover the definition above of a homomorphism of groups with operators (with f the component of the natural transformation). A group with operators is also a mapping :\\\\Omega\\\\rightarrow\\\\operatorname{End}_{\\\\mathbf{Grp}}(G), where \\\\operatorname{End}_{\\\\mathbf{Grp}}(G) is the set of group endomorphisms of G.  Examples  * Given any group G, (G, ‚àÖ) is trivially a group with operators * Given a module M over a ring R, R acts by scalar multiplication on the underlying abelian group of M, so (M, R) is a group with operators. * As a special case of the above, every vector space over a field k is a group with operators (V, k). Applications The Jordan‚ÄìH√∂lder theorem also holds in the context of operator groups. The requirement that a group have a composition series is analogous to that of compactness in topology, and can sometimes be too strong a requirement. It is natural to talk about \\"compactness relative to a set\\", i.e. talk about composition series where each (normal) subgroup is an operator-subgroup relative to the operator set X, of the group in question.

Norman was the lead singer of Smokie, an English soft rock band which found success in Europe in the 1970s. \\"Stumblin' In\\", a 1978 duet with Suzi Quatro, was a big US hit. Life and career With the advent of rock and roll, Norman acquired his first guitar at the age of seven. His early musical influences were Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and Lonnie Donegan. In these early years, Norman's parents moved around the country a lot which resulted in him going to nine different schools, and living in various locations around England, such as, Redcar, Luton, Kimpton and Nottingham. By 1962 however, the family had moved back to Norman's mother's home city of Bradford. Approaching his twelfth birthday, Norman started at St. Bede's Grammar School where he was to meet Alan Silson and Terry Uttley, future members of Smokie. As teenagers, influenced by the new era of groups such as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones and then folk singer, Bob Dylan, Norman and Silson began meeting up and spent nearly all their spare time learning new songs on their guitars. They managed to persuade Uttley to join them and, along with a drummer friend called Ron Kelly, they formed their first band. The Yen, Essence, and Long Side Down were just some of a variety of names they called themselves before settling on \\"The Elizabethans\\". When Ron Kelly left the group in 1973, an old friend called Pete Spencer was asked to take over on the drums, and the group, which was to become Smokie, was complete. Between 1974 and the early 1980s, Smokie enjoyed success touring all over the world, but the strain and pressure of constantly being away from home and family was beginning to tell on Norman. By the early 1980s he decided to spend more time writing and working in the studio. Norman and Spencer now worked together on songs for other artists including hits for Kevin Keegan (\\"Head Over Heels in Love\\", a No. 31 UK hit), and the England football team song \\"This Time (We'll Get It Right)\\". He also worked with Agnetha F√§ltskog (on her solo album), Racey (co-writer of \\"Baby It's You\\"), Donovan (backing vocals on Donovan), and Heavy Metal Kids. In 1978, Norman recorded a duet with Suzi Quatro, \\"Stumblin' In\\", which made No. 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and sold over one million copies. Norman's solo career took off in 1986 with the song, \\"Midnight Lady\\", which was a hit throughout Europe holding the number one spot in Germany for six weeks (where it sold 900,000 copies). Further success followed by the songs \\"Some Hearts Are Diamonds\\", \\"No Arms Can Ever Hold You\\", \\"Broken Heroes\\", \\"Fearless Hearts\\", \\"Sarah\\" and \\"Baby I Miss You\\". In 1994, Norman was honoured by CMT Europe as their 'International Video Star of the Year'. In 2004, he took part in the Comeback Show on the German TV station ProSieben and he performed \\"Stumblin' In\\" as a duet with C. C. Catch. In the final episode of the show, he was joined by Smokie for the final song. On 2 June 2007, Norman performed at the Peel Bay Festival, Isle of Man. Norman continues to this day to record and to perform gigs throughout Europe and beyond.

The construction embeds R in a larger ring, giving every non-zero-divisor of R an inverse in the larger ring. If the homomorphism from R to the new ring is to be injective, no further elements can be given an inverse.  Definition  Let R be a commutative ring and let S be the set of elements which are not zero divisors in R; then S is a multiplicatively closed set. Hence we may localize the ring R at the set S to obtain the total quotient ring S^{-1}R=Q(R). If R is a domain, then S=R-\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} and the total quotient ring is the same as the field of fractions. This justifies the notation Q(R), which is sometimes used for the field of fractions as well, since there is no ambiguity in the case of a domain. Since S in the construction contains no zero divisors, the natural map R \\\\to Q(R) is injective, so the total quotient ring is an extension of R.  Examples  The total quotient ring Q(A \\\\times B) of a product ring is the product of total quotient rings Q(A) \\\\times Q(B). In particular, if A and B are integral domains, it is the product of quotient fields. The total quotient ring of the ring of holomorphic functions on an open set D of complex numbers is the ring of meromorphic functions on D, even if D is not connected. In an Artinian ring, all elements are units or zero divisors. Hence the set of non-zero divisors is the group of units of the ring, R^{\\\\times}, and so Q(R) = (R^{\\\\times})^{-1}R. But since all these elements already have inverses, Q(R) = R. The same thing happens in a commutative von Neumann regular ring R. Suppose a in R is not a zero divisor. Then in a von Neumann regular ring a = axa for some x in R, giving the equation a(xa ‚àí 1) = 0\\\\. Since a is not a zero divisor, xa = 1, showing a is a unit. Here again, Q(R) = R. *In algebraic geometry one considers a sheaf of total quotient rings on a scheme, and this may be used to give one possible definition of a Cartier divisor.  The total ring of fractions of a reduced ring  There is an important fact: Proof: Every element of Q(A) is either a unit or a zerodivisor. Thus, any proper ideal I of Q(A) must consist of zerodivisors. Since the set of zerodivisors of Q(A) is the union of the minimal prime ideals \\\\mathfrak{p}_i Q(A) as Q(A) is reduced, by prime avoidance, I must be contained in some \\\\mathfrak{p}_i Q(A). Hence, the ideals \\\\mathfrak{p}_i Q(A) are the maximal ideals of Q(A), whose intersection is zero. Thus, by the Chinese remainder theorem applied to Q(A), we have: :Q(A) \\\\simeq \\\\prod_i Q(A)/\\\\mathfrak{p}_i Q(A). Finally, Q(A)/\\\\mathfrak{p}_i Q(A) is the residue field of \\\\mathfrak{p}_i. Indeed, writing S for the multiplicatively closed set of non-zerodivisors, by the exactness of localization, :Q(A)/\\\\mathfrak{p}_i Q(A) = A[S^{-1}] / \\\\mathfrak{p}_i A[S^{-1}] = (A / \\\\mathfrak{p}_i)[S^{-1}], which is already a field and so must be Q(A/\\\\mathfrak{p}_i). \\\\square  Generalization  If R is a commutative ring and S is any multiplicative subset in R, the localization S^{-1}R can still be constructed, but the ring homomorphism from R to S^{-1}R might fail to be injective. For example, if 0 \\\\in S, then S^{-1}R is the trivial ring.

He was born in Qudaghlo in the Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti to Prince Malkhaz Andronikashvili and Princess Mariam Bagrationi. (In 1801, the Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti became part of the Russian Empire.) His mother, Princess Mariam Bagrationi, was the sister of the last Imeretian king Solomon II. He himself was married to Princess Nino Imeretinsky, granddaughter of King David II of Imereti. When Andronikashvili turned nineteen, he was enrolled in the St Petersburg Cavalry Regiment of the Leib Guard. Seven years later he was transferred to the Nizhny Novgorod cavalry regiment with the rank of major. When the Russo-Persian war broke out in 1826 Andronikashvili became heavily involved in many decisive battles. He served later in the Caucasus during the wars with Persia (1826-1829) and Turkey (1828-1829). He was promoted Major General in 1841 and appointed Governor General of Tiflis in 1849. He took part in the Caucasian War and led an expedition against the rebellious Ossetes in 1840 and 1850. The Crimean War was the apex of Andronikashvili‚Äôs military career. On November 14, 1853, he defeated Ali Pasha's army of 20,000 men at Akhaltsikhe with as few as 5,000 soldiers, mostly irregular Georgian cavalrymen. He achieved another victory against considerable odds over Selim Pasha‚Äôs 36,000 troops at the Choloki River with the force of 13,000. Prince Andronikashvili was promoted to General of Cavalry just a few months before his death in 1868.

Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second installment of Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale and supported by Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Morgan Freeman. In the film, Bruce Wayne / Batman (Bale), Police Lieutenant James Gordon (Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart) form an alliance to dismantle organized crime in Gotham City, but are menaced by an anarchistic mastermind known as the Joker (Ledger), who seeks to undermine Batman's influence and throw the city into anarchy. Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut in 1940, the 1988 graphic novel The Killing Joke, and the 1996 series The Long Halloween, which retold Harvey Dent's origin. The \\"Dark Knight\\" nickname was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.Marc Tyler Nobleman (2012). Bill the Boy Wonder:The Secret Co-Creator of Batman. Charlesbridge Publishing, U.S. The Dark Knight was filmed primarily in Chicago, as well as in several other locations in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong. The film was the first mainstream feature to partially utilize IMAX 70mm cameras, with Nolan using them for 28 minutes of the film, including the Joker's first appearance. Warner Bros. initially created a viral marketing campaign for The Dark Knight, developing promotional websites and trailers highlighting screenshots of Ledger as the Joker. Ledger died on January 22, 2008, some months after he completed filming and six months before the film's release from a toxic combination of prescription drugs, leading to intense attention from the press and movie-going public. Upon its release on July 18, 2008, The Dark Knight achieved significant critical and commercial success. With over $1billion in revenue worldwide, it became the highest-grossing film of 2008 and the fourth- highest-grossing film at the time of its release; it also set the record for highest-grossing domestic opening with $158million, a record it held for three years. At the 81st Academy Awards, the film received eight nominations; it won the award for Best Sound Editing and Ledger was posthumously awarded Best Supporting Actor. The Dark Knight is considered one of the best films of its decade and one of the best superhero films ever made. The Dark Knight Rises, the final film in the trilogy, was released on July 20, 2012. Plot A gang of criminals robs a Gotham City mob bank, murdering each other for a higher share until only the Joker remains; he escapes with the money. Batman, District Attorney Harvey Dent and Lieutenant Jim Gordon form an alliance to rid Gotham of organized crime. Bruce Wayne is impressed with Dent's idealism and offers to support his career; he believes that, with Dent as Gotham's protector, he can give up being Batman and lead a normal life with Rachel Dawes‚Äîeven though she and Dent are dating. Mob bosses Sal Maroni, Gambol, and the Chechen hold a videoconference with their corrupt accountant, Lau, who has taken their funds for safekeeping and fled to Hong Kong. The Joker interrupts, warns them that Batman is unhindered by the law, and offers to kill him in exchange for half of their money. The Joker kills Gambol and takes over his gang, and the mob ultimately decides to accept the offer. Batman finds Lau in Hong Kong and brings him back to Gotham to testify, allowing Dent to apprehend the entire mob. The Joker threatens to keep killing people unless Batman reveals his identity, and starts by murdering Police Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb and the judge presiding over the mob trial. The Joker also tries to kill Mayor Anthony Garcia, but Gordon sacrifices himself to stop the assassination. Dent learns that Rachel is the next target. Bruce decides to reveal his secret identity. Before he can, however, Dent announces that he is Batman. Dent is taken into protective custody, but the Joker appears and attacks the convoy. Batman comes to Dent's rescue and Gordon, who faked his death, apprehends the Joker, securing a promotion to Commissioner. Rachel and Dent are escorted away by detectives on Maroni's payroll; Gordon later learns that they never arrived home. Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals that they have been trapped in separate locations rigged with explosives. Batman races to save Rachel, while Gordon attempts to rescue Dent. Batman arrives at the building, but realizes that the Joker sent him to Dent's location instead. Both buildings explode, killing Rachel and disfiguring half of Dent's face. The Joker escapes with Lau, whom he later kills along with the Chechen. Coleman Reese, an accountant at Wayne Enterprises, deduces that Bruce is Batman and tries to go public with the information. Not wanting Reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the Joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless someone kills Reese within the hour. Gordon orders the evacuation of all the hospitals in Gotham and goes to secure Reese. The Joker gives Dent a gun and convinces him to seek revenge for Rachel's death, then destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. Dent goes on a killing spree, deciding the fates of people he holds responsible for Rachel's death by flipping his lucky coin‚Äîone side having become scorched in the explosion. After announcing Gotham will be subject to his rule come nightfall, the Joker rigs two evacuating ferries with explosives, one containing civilians and the other containing prisoners. He says that he will blow them both up by midnight, but will let one live if its passengers (who have been supplied the detonator to the other boat's explosives) blow up the other. Batman finds the Joker by using a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant help of Lucius Fox. Both the civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while Batman apprehends the Joker after a brief fight. Before the police arrive to take the Joker into custody, he gloats that Gotham's citizens will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public knowledge. Gordon and Batman arrive at the building where Rachel perished. Dent shoots Batman, spares himself, and threatens to kill Gordon's son, claiming that Gordon's negligence is responsible for Rachel's death. Before he can flip for the boy, Batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building to his death. Batman persuades Gordon to hold him responsible for the killing spree and preserve Dent's heroic image. As the police launch a manhunt for Batman, Gordon destroys the Bat-signal, Fox watches as the sonar device self-destructs, and Alfred Pennyworth burns a letter from Rachel saying she planned to marry Dent. Cast Cast and crew of The Dark Knight at the European premiere in London. From left to right: Director Christopher Nolan, producers Emma Thomas and Charles Roven, actors Monique Gabriela Curnen, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Christian Bale. * Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman: :A billionaire socialite who, after witnessing his parents' death in a mugging at age 8, travels the world for seven years before returning home to operate as a bat-masked vigilante hailed as Gotham City's \\"Dark Knight\\", using fear against the city's criminal underworld at night. Bale said he was confident in his choice to return in the role because of the positive response to his portrayal in Batman Begins. He continued training in the Keysi Fighting Method and performed many of his own stunts, but did not gain as much muscle as in the previous film because the new Batsuit allowed him to move with greater agility. Bale described Batman's dilemma as whether \\"[his crusade is] something that has an end. Can he quit and have an ordinary life? The kind of manic intensity someone has to have to maintain the passion and the anger that they felt as a child, takes an effort after a while, to keep doing that. At some point, you have to exorcise your demons.\\" He added, \\"Now you have not just a young man in pain attempting to find some kind of an answer, you have somebody who actually has power, who is burdened by that power, and is having to recognize the difference between attaining that power and holding on to it.\\" Bale felt Batman's personality had been strongly established in the first film, so it was unlikely his character would be overshadowed by the villains, stating: \\"I have no problem with competing with someone else. And that's going to make a better movie.\\" * Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth: :Bruce's trusted butler and confidant, who supplies useful advice to Bruce and likeness as a father figure, leading him to be labeled \\"Batman's batman\\". * Heath Ledger as the Joker: :A psychopathic illegalist mastermind portraying himself as an \\"agent of chaos\\", who rises from the criminal underworld by thrusting Gotham into anarchy and drawing Batman ever closer to crossing the fine line between heroism and vigilantism. Before Ledger was cast in July 2006, Paul Bettany, Lachy Hulme, Adrien Brody, Steve Carell, and Robin Williams publicly expressed interest in it. However, Nolan had wanted to work with Ledger on a number of projects in the past (including unsuccessfully approaching Ledger for the role of Batman in Batman Begins) and was agreeable to Ledger's chaotic interpretation of the character. When Ledger saw Batman Begins, he had realized a way to make the character work that was consistent with the film's tone: he described his Joker as a \\"psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy\\". In the film, the Joker has a Glasgow smile, and his trademark chalk-white skin and red lips are makeup rather than the result of chemical bleaching, as in the traditional portrayal of the character. Throughout the film, the Joker states his desire to upset social order through crime, and comes to define himself by his conflict with Batman. To prepare for the role, Ledger lived alone in a hotel room for a month, formulating the character's posture, voice, and personality, and kept a diary, in which he recorded the Joker's thoughts and feelings. While he initially found it difficult, Ledger eventually generated a voice unlike Jack Nicholson's character in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman film. He was also given Batman: The Killing Joke and Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, which he \\"really tried to read and put it down\\". Ledger also cited A Clockwork Orange and Sid Vicious as \\"a very early starting point for Christian [Bale] and I. But we kind of flew far away from that pretty quickly and into another world altogether.\\" \\"There's a bit of everything in him. There's nothing that consistent\\", Ledger said, and added, \\"There are a few more surprises to him.\\" Ledger was allowed to shoot and mostly direct the videos the Joker sends out as warnings. Each take Ledger made was different from the last. Nolan was impressed enough with the first video shoot that he chose to not be present when Ledger shot the video with a kidnapped reporter (Anthony Michael Hall).. . On January 22, 2008, after he had completed filming The Dark Knight, Ledger died of an accidental prescription drug overdose, leading to intense press attention and memorial tributes. \\"It was tremendously emotional, right when he passed, having to go back in and look at him every day [during editing]\\", Nolan recalled. \\"But the truth is, I feel very lucky to have something productive to do, to have a performance that he was very, very proud of, and that he had entrusted to me to finish.\\" All of Ledger's scenes appear as he completed them in the filming; in editing the film, Nolan added no \\"digital effects\\" to alter Ledger's actual performance posthumously. Nolan dedicated the film in part to Ledger's memory. * Gary Oldman as James Gordon: :A lieutenant in the Gotham City Police Department and one of the city's few honest police officers, who forms a tenuous, unofficial alliance with Batman and Dent and is given the position of Police Commissioner by the city's mayor following the recent commissioner's assassination. Oldman described his character as \\"incorruptible, virtuous, strong, heroic, but understated\\". Nolan explained, \\"The Long Halloween has a great, triangular relationship between Harvey Dent and Gordon and Batman, and that's something we very much drew from.\\" Oldman added that \\"Gordon has a great deal of admiration for him at the end, but [Batman] is more than ever now the dark knight, the outsider. I'm intrigued now to see: If there is a third one, what he's going to do?\\" On the possibility of another sequel, he said that \\"returning to [the role] is not dependent on whether the role was bigger than the one before\\". * Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent: :The district attorney hailed as Gotham's \\"White Knight\\", whose campaign against the criminal underworld leaves half of his face disfigured, turning him into a murderer with a split-personality bent on revenge. Nolan and David S. Goyer had originally considered using Dent in Batman Begins, but they replaced him with the new character Rachel Dawes when they realized they \\"couldn't do him justice\\". Before Eckhart was cast in February 2007, Liev Schreiber, Josh Lucas, and Ryan Phillippe had expressed interest in the role, while Mark Ruffalo auditioned. Matt Damon stated that he was considered for the role, but could not accept due to scheduling conflicts. Hugh Jackman was also considered for the part. Nolan chose Eckhart, whom he had considered for the lead role in Memento, citing his \\"extraordinary\\" ability as an actor, his embodiment of \\"that kind of chiselled, American hero quality\\" projected by Robert Redford, and his subtextual \\"edge\\". Eckhart was \\"interested in good guys gone wrong\\", and had played corrupt men in films such as The Black Dahlia, Thank You for Smoking, and In the Company of Men. Whereas Dent is depicted as a crime boss in most characterizations, Nolan chose to portray him as a twisted vigilante to emphasize his role as Batman's counterpart. Eckhart explained, \\"[He] is still true to himself. He's a crime fighter, he's not killing good people. He's not a bad guy, not purely.\\" For Dent, Eckhart \\"kept on thinking about the Kennedys\\", particularly Robert F. Kennedy, who was \\"idealistic, held a grudge and took on the Mob\\". He had his hair lightened and styled to make him appear more dashing. Nolan told Eckhart to not make Dent's criminal persona \\"jokey with slurping sounds or ticks\\". * Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes: :Gotham City's assistant district attorney and Bruce's childhood friend, who is one of the few people who knows Batman's true identity. Gyllenhaal took over the role from Katie Holmes, who played the part in Batman Begins. In August 2005, Holmes was reportedly planning to reprise the role, but she eventually turned it down to film Mad Money with Diane Keaton and Queen Latifah. By March 2007, Gyllenhaal was in \\"final talks\\" for the part. Gyllenhaal has acknowledged her character is a damsel in distress to an extent, but says Nolan sought ways to empower her character, so \\"Rachel's really clear about what's important to her and unwilling to compromise her morals, which made a nice change\\" from the many conflicted characters whom she has previously portrayed. * Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox: :The recently promoted CEO of Wayne Enterprises who, now fully aware of his employer's double life, serves more directly as Bruce's armorer for the Batsuit in addition to his corporate duties. Monique Gabriela Curnen and Ron Dean portray Anna Ramirez and Michael Wuertz respectively, corrupt detectives in Gordon's unit. Nestor Carbonell appears as Anthony Garcia, the mayor of Gotham. Ng Chin Han portrays Lau, a corrupt Chinese LSI Holdings accountant Triad boss. Eric Roberts plays Sal Maroni, an Italian mafia boss who takes over Carmine Falcone's mob, and Ritchie Coster portrays the Chechen, a Chechen mafia boss in charge of drug-trafficking for the mob. Anthony Michael Hall appears as Mike Engel, a Gotham Cable News reporter, and Keith Szarabajka portrays Gerard Stephens, a detective in Gordon's unit. Joshua Harto plays Coleman Reese, an M&A; law accountant at Wayne Enterprises who deduces Bruce's persona of Batman from Fox and plans to reveal it to Gotham. Melinda McGraw appears as Barbara Gordon, Gordon's wife, while Nathan Gamble appears as James Gordon Jr., Gordon's ten-year-old son. Michael Jai White portrays Gambol, an African American mafia boss in charge of illegal gambling and extortion for the mob. Colin McFarlane reprises his role as Gillian B. Loeb, the Police Commissioner of Gotham. The film's supporting cast includes Nydia Rodriguez Terracina as Judge Janet Surrillo, and Tom \\"Tiny\\" Lister Jr. as a prison inmate on one of the bomb-rigged ferries. Vincenzo Nicoli played a crime boss in the meeting that had been held by the Joker and Lau. William Fichtner played the Gotham National Bank manager, and Cillian Murphy returns in a cameo as Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow, who is apprehended early on in the film by Batman. Musician Dwight Yoakam was approached for the roles of either the manager or a corrupt cop, but he chose instead to focus on his album Dwight Sings Buck. United States Senator Patrick Leahy‚Äîa fan of Batman comics who was previously an extra in the 1997 film Batman & Robin and also was a guest voice actor on Batman: The Animated Series‚Äîappears as a guest at Bruce Wayne's party. Matt Skiba, co-lead vocalist and guitarist of the bands Alkaline Trio and Blink-182, made a small appearance in the film. David Dastmalchian appears as Thomas Schiff, a paranoid schizophrenic from Arkham Asylum who joins the Joker's gang, but gets captured and held at gunpoint by Dent after posing as an Honor Guard at Loeb's funeral alongside the Joker himself. Production Development Before the release of Batman Begins, screenwriter David S. Goyer wrote a treatment for two sequels which introduced the Joker and Harvey Dent. His original intent was for the Joker to scar Dent during the Joker's trial in the third film, turning Dent into the supervillain Two-Face. Goyer, who penned the first draft of the film, cited the DC Comics 13-issue comic book limited series Batman: The Long Halloween as the major influence on his storyline. According to veteran Batman artist Neal Adams, he met with David Goyer in Los Angeles, and the story would eventually look to Adams and writer Denny O'Neil's 1971 story \\"The Joker's Five-Way Revenge\\" that appeared in Batman #251, in which O'Neil and Adams re-introduced the Joker.Spry, Jeff (February 2014). \\"Neal Adams: Up Close and Personal\\". Bleeding Cool. #8. Avatar Press. pp. 57‚Äì63. While initially uncertain of whether or not he would return to direct the sequel, Nolan did want to reinterpret the Joker on screen. On July 31, 2006, Warner Bros. officially announced initiation of production for the sequel to Batman Begins titled The Dark Knight; it is the first live-action Batman film without the word \\"Batman\\" in its title, which Bale noted as signaling that \\"this take on Batman of mine and Chris' is very different from any of the others\\". After much research, Nolan's brother and co-writer, Jonathan Nolan, suggested the Joker's first two appearances, published in the first issue of Batman (1940), as the crucial influences. Christopher had Jonathan watch Fritz Lang's 1933 crime film The Testament of Dr. Mabuse prior to writing the Joker,Nolan, Jonathan. Christopher Nolan: The Movies. The Memories.

Retrieved October 26, 2015. Jerry Robinson, one of the Joker's co- creators, was consulted on the character's portrayal. Nolan decided to avoid divulging an in-depth origin story for the Joker, and instead portray his rise to power so as to not diminish the threat he poses, explaining to MTV News, \\"the Joker we meet in The Dark Knight is fully formed... To me, the Joker is an absolute. There are no shades of gray to him‚Äîmaybe shades of purple. He's unbelievably dark. He bursts in just as he did in the comics.\\" Nolan reiterated to IGN, \\"We never wanted to do an origin story for the Joker in this film\\", because \\"the arc of the story is much more Harvey Dent's; the Joker is presented as an absolute. It's a very thrilling element in the film, and a very important element, but we wanted to deal with the rise of the Joker, not the origin of the Joker.\\" Nolan suggested Batman: The Killing Joke influenced a section of the Joker's dialogue in the film, in which he says that anyone can become like him given the right circumstances. Nolan also cited Heat as \\"sort of an inspiration\\" for his aim \\"to tell a very large, city story or the story of a city\\": \\"If you want to take on Gotham, you want to give Gotham a kind of weight and breadth and depth in there. So you wind up dealing with the political figures, the media figures. That's part of the whole fabric of how a city is bound together.\\" According to Nolan, an important theme of the sequel is \\"escalation\\", extending the ending of Batman Begins, noting \\"things having to get worse before they get better\\". While indicating The Dark Knight would continue the themes of Batman Begins, including justice vs. revenge and Bruce Wayne's issues with his father, Nolan emphasized the sequel would also portray Wayne more as a detective, an aspect of his character not fully developed in Batman Begins. Nolan described the friendly rivalry between Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent as the \\"backbone\\" of the film. He also chose to compress the overall storyline, allowing him to develop Dent into a criminal in The Dark Knight, thus giving the film an emotional arc the unsympathetic Joker could not offer. Nolan acknowledged the title was not only a reference to Batman, but also the fallen \\"white knight\\" Harvey Dent. During rehearsals, Nolan and cast members were mesmerised by Heath Ledger's interpretation of the Joker. Aaron Eckhart recalled, \\"Chris looked at me and he said, 'Heath is doing something special.' And we all felt that way... When you have Gary Oldman, who's one of our greatest actors, and he's in awe of what Heath was doing, it showed what a performance Heath was giving.\\" Filming While scouting for shooting locations in October 2006, location manager Robin Higgs visited Liverpool, concentrating mainly along the city's waterfront. Other candidates included Yorkshire, Glasgow, and parts of London. In August 2006, one of the film's producers, Charles Roven, stated that its principal photography would begin in March 2007, but filming was pushed back to April. For its release in IMAX theaters, Nolan shot four major sequences in that format, including the Joker's opening bank robbery and the car chase midway through the film, which marked the first time that a feature film had been even partially shot in the format. Additionally, it was also the first Batman film to use 70 mm film stock. The cameras used for non-IMAX 35mm scenes were Panavision's Panaflex Millennium XL and Platinum. For fifteen years Nolan had wanted to shoot in the IMAX format, and he also used it for \\"quiet scenes which pictorially we thought would be interesting\\". The use of IMAX cameras provided many new challenges for the filmmakers: the cameras were much larger and heavier than standard cameras, and produced noise which made recording dialogue difficult. In addition, the cameras had short film loads ranging from 30 seconds to two minutes and the cost of the film stock was much greater than standard 35mm film. Nevertheless, Nolan said that he wished that it were possible to shoot the entire film in IMAX: \\"if you could take an IMAX camera to Mount Everest or outer space, you could use it in a feature movie.\\" In addition, Nolan chose to edit some of the IMAX sequences using the original camera negative, which by eliminating generation loss, raised the film resolution of those sequences up to 18,000 lines. . Director Christopher Nolan (far left) and actor Heath Ledger (in make-up) filming a scene in The Dark Knight with an IMAX camera Warner Bros. chose to film in Chicago for 13 weeks, because Nolan had a \\"truly remarkable experience\\" filming part of Batman Begins there. Instead of using the Chicago Board of Trade Building as the location for the headquarters of Wayne Enterprises, as Batman Begins did, The Dark Knight shows Wayne Enterprises as being headquartered in the Richard J. Daley Center. While filming in Chicago, the film was given the false title Rory's First Kiss to lower the visibility of production, but the local media eventually uncovered the ruse. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times commented on the absurdity of the technique, \\"Is there a Bat-fan in the world that doesn't know Rory's First Kiss is actually The Dark Knight, which has been filming in Chicago for weeks?\\" Production of The Dark Knight in Chicago generated $45million in the city's economy and created thousands of jobs. For the film's prologue involving the Joker, the crew shot in Chicago from April 18, 2007 to April 24, 2007. They returned to shoot from June 9, 2007, to early September. Noticeably, unlike Batman Begins, less CGI was used to disguise Chicago. Many recognizable locations were used in the film, like the Sears Tower, Navy Pier, 330 North Wabash, the James R. Thompson Center, Trump International Hotel and Tower (which was still incomplete at the time of the film's release), LaSalle Street, The Berghoff, Randolph Street Station, and Hotel 71. An old Brach's factory was used as Gotham Hospital. The defunct Van Buren Street post office doubles as Gotham National Bank for the opening bank robbery. Several sequences, including one car chase, were shot on the lower level of Wacker Drive. The Marina City towers also appear in the background throughout the movie. Pinewood Studios, near London, was the primary studio space used for the production. While planning a stunt with the Batmobile in a special effects facility near Chertsey, England in September 2007, technician Conway Wickliffe was killed when his car crashed. The film is dedicated to both Ledger and Wickliffe. The restaurant scene was filmed at the Criterion Restaurant in Piccadilly Circus, London. The following month in London at the defunct Battersea Power Station, a rigged 200-foot fireball was filmed, reportedly for an opening sequence, prompting calls from local residents who feared a terrorist attack on the station. A similar incident occurred during the filming in Chicago, when an abandoned Brach's candy factory (which was Gotham Hospital in the film) was demolished. Filming took place in Hong Kong from November 6 to 11, 2007, at various locations in Central, including Hong Kong's tallest building at the time, the International Finance Centre, for the scene where Batman captures Lau. Filming also took place on the Central to Mid-Levels covered escalator. The shoot hired helicopters and C-130 aircraft. Officials expressed concern over possible noise pollution and traffic. In response, letters sent to the city's residents promised that the sound level would approximate noise decibels made by buses. Environmentalists also criticized the filmmakers' request to tenants of the waterfront skyscrapers to keep their lights on all night to enhance the cinematography, describing it as a waste of energy. Cinematographer Wally Pfister found the city officials a \\"nightmare\\", and ultimately Nolan had to create Batman's jump from a skyscraper digitally. Design Costume designer Lindy Hemming described the Joker's look as reflecting his personality, in that \\"he doesn't care about himself at all\\"; she avoided designing him as a vagrant, but still made him appear to be \\"scruffier, grungier\\", so that \\"when you see him move, he's slightly twitchier or edgy\\". Nolan noted, \\"We gave a Francis Bacon spin to [his face]. This corruption, this decay in the texture of the look itself. It's grubby. You can almost imagine what he smells like.\\" In creating the \\"anarchical\\" look of the Joker, Hemming drew inspiration from such countercultural pop culture artists as Pete Doherty, Iggy Pop, and Johnny Rotten. Ledger described his \\"clown\\" mask, made up of three pieces of stamped silicone, as a \\"new technology\\", taking less than an hour for the make-up artists to apply, much faster than more-conventional prosthetics usually requires. Ledger also said that he felt he was barely wearing any make-up. Hemming and Ledger's Joker design has had an impact in popular and political culture in the form of the Barack Obama \\"Joker\\" poster, and has since become a meme in its own right. Designers improved on the design of the Batsuit from Batman Begins, adding wide elastic banding to help bind the costume to Bale, and suggest more sophisticated technology. It was constructed from 200 individual pieces of rubber, fiberglass, metallic mesh, and nylon. The new cowl was modeled after a motorcycle helmet and separated from the neck piece, allowing Bale to turn his head left and right and nod up and down. The cowl is equipped to show white lenses over the eyes when the character turns on his sonar detection, which gives Batman the white-eyed look from the comics and animation. The gauntlets have retractable razors which can be fired. Though the new costume is eight pounds heavier, Bale found it more comfortable and not as hot to wear. The depiction of Gotham City is less gritty than in Batman Begins. \\"I've tried to unclutter the Gotham we created on the last film\\", said production designer Nathan Crowley. \\"Gotham is in chaos. We keep blowing up stuff, so we can keep our images clean.\\" Effects Aaron Eckhart with make-up and motion capture markers on set. Below is the finished effect. The film introduces the Batpod, which is a recreation of the Batcycle. Production designer Nathan Crowley, who designed the Tumbler for Batman Begins, designed six models (built by special effects supervisor Chris Corbould) for use in the film's production, because of necessary crash scenes and possible accidents. Crowley built a prototype in Nolan's garage, before six months of safety tests were conducted. The Batpod is steered by shoulder instead of hand, and the rider's arms are protected by sleeve-like shields. The bike has front and rear tires, and is made to appear as if it is armed with grappling hooks, cannons, and machine guns. The engines are located in the hubs of the wheels, which are set 3¬Ωfeet (1,067mm) apart on either side of the tank. The rider lies belly down on the tank, which can move up and down to dodge any incoming gunfire that Batman may encounter. Stuntman Jean-Pierre Goy doubled for Christian Bale during the riding sequences in The Dark Knight. The Batpod was highly unstable for riding, and Goy was the only stuntman who could manage to balance the bike, even commenting that he had to \\"nearly un-learn how to ride a motorcycle\\" to manage riding the Batpod. Bale did insist on doing shots on the Batpod himself, but was prohibited by the team fearing his safety. Nolan designed Dent's scarred appearance in the film as one of the least disturbing, explaining, \\"When we looked at less extreme versions of it, they were too real and more horrifying. When you look at a film like Pirates of the Caribbean‚Äîsomething like that, there's something about a very fanciful, very detailed visual effect, that I think is more powerful and less repulsive.\\" Framestore created 120 computer-generated shots of Dent's visage. Nolan felt using make-up would look unrealistic, as it adds to the face, unlike real burn victims. Framestore acknowledged they rearranged the positions of bones, muscles and joints to make the character look more dramatic. For each shot, three 720-pixel HD cameras were set up at different angles on set to fully capture Aaron Eckhart's performance. Eckhart wore markers on his face and a prosthetic skullcap, which acted as a lighting reference. A few shots of the skullcap were kept in the film. Framestore also integrated shots of Bale and Eckhart into that of the exploding building where Dent is burned. It was difficult simulating fire on Eckhart because it is inherently unrealistic for only half of something to burn. Music Batman Begins composers Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard returned to score the sequel. Composition began before shooting, and during filming Nolan received an iPod with ten hours of recordings. Their nine-minute suite for the Joker, \\"Why So Serious?\\", is based around two notes. Zimmer compared its style to that of Kraftwerk, a band from his native Germany, as well as bands like the Damned. When Ledger died, Zimmer felt like scrapping and composing a new theme, but decided that he could not be sentimental and compromise the \\"evil [Ledger's performance] projects\\". Howard composed Dent's \\"elegant and beautiful\\" themes, which are brass- focused. Marketing Joker's message \\"The only sensible way to live in this world is without rules\\", to send in photographs of these letters, and then featured their photos in a collage. In May 2007, 42 Entertainment began a viral marketing campaign utilizing the film's \\"Why So Serious?\\" tagline with the launch of a website featuring the fictional political campaign of Harvey Dent, with the caption, \\"I Believe in Harvey Dent\\". This is an updated version of that website. The site aimed to interest fans by having them try to earn what they wanted to see and, on behalf of Warner Bros., 42 Entertainment also established a \\"vandalized\\" version of I Believe in Harvey Dent, called \\"I believe in Harvey Dent too\\", where e-mails sent by fans slowly removed pixels, revealing the first official image of the Joker; it was ultimately replaced with many \\"Haha\\"s and a hidden message that said \\"see you in December\\". During the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con International, 42 Entertainment launched WhySoSerious.com, sending fans on a scavenger hunt to unlock a teaser trailer and a new photo of the Joker. On October 31, 2007, the film's website morphed into another scavenger hunt with hidden messages, instructing fans to uncover clues at certain locations in major cities throughout the United States, and to take photographs of their discoveries. The clues combined to reveal a new photograph of the Joker and an audio clip of him from the film saying \\"And tonight, you're gonna break your one rule.\\" Completing the scavenger hunt also led to another website called Rory's Death Kiss (referencing the false working title of Rory's First Kiss), where fans could submit photographs of themselves costumed as the Joker. Those who sent photos were mailed a copy of a fictional newspaper called The Gotham Times, whose electronic version led to the discovery of numerous other websites. (Source: The Fans.) Toyota Formula One racing car featuring the Batman insignia, at the 2008 British Grand Prix The Dark Knights opening sequence (showing a bank raid by the Joker), and closing montage of other scenes from the film, was screened with selected IMAX screenings of I Am Legend, which was released on December 14, 2007. A theatrical teaser was also released with non-IMAX showings of I Am Legend, and also on the official website. The sequence was released on the Blu-ray Disc edition of Batman Begins on July 8, 2008. Also on July 8, 2008, the studio released Batman: Gotham Knight, a direct-to-DVD animated film, set between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and featuring six original stories, directed by Bruce Timm, co-creator and producer of Batman: The Animated Series, and starring veteran Batman voice actor Kevin Conroy. Each of these segments, written by Josh Olson, David S. Goyer, Brian Azzarello, Greg Rucka, Jordan Goldberg, and Alan Burnett, presents its own distinctive artistic style, paralleling numerous artists collaborating in the same DC Universe. After the death of Heath Ledger on January 22, 2008, Warner Bros. adjusted its promotional focus on the Joker, revising some of its websites dedicated to promoting the film and posting a memorial tribute to Ledger on the film's official website and overlaying a black memorial ribbon on the photo collage in WhySoSerious.com. On February 29, 2008, I Believe in Harvey Dent was updated to enable fans to send their e-mail addresses and phone numbers. In March 2008, Harvey Dent's fictional campaign informed fans that actual campaign buses nicknamed \\"Dentmobiles\\" would tour various cities to promote Dent's candidacy for district attorney. Movie poster for The Dark Knight, seen in Paris's Rue Saint-Honor√© in August 2008 On May 15, 2008, Six Flags Great America and Six Flags Great Adventure theme parks opened The Dark Knight Coaster roller coaster, which cost US$7.5million to develop and which simulates being stalked by the Joker. Mattel produced toys and games for The Dark Knight, action figures, role-play costumes, board games, puzzles, and a special-edition UNO card game, which began commercial distribution in June 2008. (Source: Warner Bros. Consumer Products.) Warner Bros. devoted six months to an anti-infringement strategy that involved tracking the people who had a pre-release copy of the film at any one time. Shipping and delivery schedules were also staggered and spot checks were carried out both domestically and overseas to ensure illegal copying of the film was not taking place in cinemas. An unlicensed copy was released on the web about 38 hours after the film's release. BitTorrent search engine The Pirate Bay taunted the movie industry over its ability to provide the movie free, replacing its logo with a taunting message. Pandemic Studios was developing a tie-in video game adaptation, Batman: The Dark Knight. However, its development faced a series of disruptions and was canceled before completion. Release Warner Bros. held the world premiere for The Dark Knight in New York City on July 14, 2008, screening in an IMAX theater with the film's composers James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer playing a part of the film score live. Leading up to The Dark Knights commercial release, the film had drawn \\"overwhelmingly positive early reviews and buzz on Heath Ledger's turn as the Joker\\". The Dark Knight was commercially released on July 16, 2008 in Australia, grossing almost $2.3million in its first day. In the United States and Canada, The Dark Knight was distributed to 4,366 theaters, breaking the previous record for the highest number of theaters held by Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End in 2007. The number of theaters also included 94 IMAX theaters, with the film estimated to be played on 9,200 screens in the United States and Canada. Online, ticketing services sold enormous numbers of tickets for approximately 3,000 midnight showtimes as well as unusually early showtimes for the film's opening day. All IMAX theaters showing The Dark Knight were sold out for the opening weekend. The Dark Knight was re-released in IMAX for its 10th anniversary for a week starting on August 24, 2018. It played at the AMC IMAX theaters in Universal CityWalk, Lincoln Square, Manhattan, and Metreon, as well as the Ontario Place Cinesphere. Reception Heath Ledger's performance was widely praised and ultimately won him a posthumous Academy Award. The Dark Knight is considered one of the best films of the 2000s and one of the best superhero films of all time. On aggregating review website Rotten Tomatoes, The Dark Knight has an approval rating of 94%, based on 338 reviews, with an average score of 8.59/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Dark, complex and unforgettable, The Dark Knight succeeds not just as an entertaining comic book film, but as a richly thrilling crime saga.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating based on reviews from top mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 84 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim.\\" CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade cinemagoers gave the film was \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale; audiences skewed slightly male and older. The Dark Knight appeared on 287 critics' top- ten lists, more than any other film of 2008 with the exception of WALL-E, and more critics (77) named The Dark Knight the best film released that year. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, awarding four out of four stars, described The Dark Knight as a \\"haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy.\\" He praised the performances, direction, and writing, saying the film \\"redefine[s] the possibilities of the comic-book movie.\\" Ebert stated that the \\"key performance\\" is by Heath Ledger; he pondered whether he would become the first posthumous Academy Award-winning actor since Peter Finch in 1976. The Oscar was awarded to the late Ledger. Ebert ranked this as one of his twenty favorite films of 2008. Film critic Andrew Sarris acknowledged that after seeing The Dark Knight he would \\"rethink my past reservations\\" about Nolan's work. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that the film is deeper than its predecessor, with a \\"deft\\" script that refuses to scrutinize the Joker with popular psychology, instead pulling the viewer in with an examination of Bruce Wayne's psyche. (Postdated) Travers praised all the cast, saying each brings his or her \\"'A' game\\" to the film. He says Bale is \\"electrifying\\", evoking Al Pacino in The Godfather Part II, that Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent is \\"scarily moving,\\" and that Oldman \\"is so skilled that he makes virtue exciting as Jim Gordon.\\" Travers says Ledger moves the Joker away from Jack Nicholson's interpretation into darker territory, and expresses his support for any potential campaign to have Ledger nominated for an Academy Award, Travers says that the filmmakers move the film away from comic book cinema and closer to being a genuine work of art, citing Nolan's direction and the \\"gritty reality\\" of Wally Pfister's cinematography as helping to create a universe that has something \\"raw and elemental\\" at work within it. In particular, he cites Nolan's action choreography in the IMAX- tailored heist sequence as rivaling that of Heat (1995). Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, \\"Pitched at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertainment, it goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind.\\" Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, \\"best- of\\" list, saying, \\"Every great hero needs a great villain. And in 2008, Christian Bale's Batman found his in Heath Ledger's demented dervish, the Joker.\\" BBC critic Mark Kermode, in a positive review, said that Ledger is \\"very, very good\\" but that Oldman's turn is \\"the best performance in the film, by a mile\\"; Kermode felt Oldman was deserving of an Oscar nomination. Emanuel Levy wrote Ledger \\"throws himself completely\\" into the role, and that the film represents Nolan's \\"most accomplished and mature\\" work, and the most technically impressive and resonant of all the Batman films. Levy calls the action sequences some of the most impressive seen in an American film for years, and talks of the Hong Kong-set portion of the film as being particularly visually impressive. Levy and Peter Travers conclude that the film is \\"haunting and visionary,\\" while Levy goes on to say that The Dark Knight is \\"nothing short of brilliant.\\" On the other hand, David Denby of The New Yorker said that the story is not coherent enough to properly flesh out the disparities. He said the film's mood is one of \\"constant climax,\\" and that it feels rushed and far too long. Denby criticized scenes which he argued to be meaningless or are cut short just as they become interesting. (Postdated) Denby remarks that the central conflict is workable, but that \\"only half the team can act it,\\" saying that Bale's \\"placid\\" Bruce Wayne and \\"dogged but uninteresting\\" Batman is constantly upstaged by Ledger's \\"sinister and frightening\\" performance, which he says is the film's one element of success. Denby concludes that Ledger is \\"mesmerizing\\" in every scene. The vocalization of Christian Bale's Batman (which was partly altered during post-production) was the subject of particular criticism by some commentators, with David Edelstein from NPR describing Bale delivering his performance with \\"a voice that's deeper and hammier than ever.\\" Alonso Duralde at MSNBC, however, referred to Bale's voice in The Dark Knight as an \\"eerie rasp,\\" as opposed to the voice used in the Batman Begins, which according to Duralde \\"sounded absurdly deep, like a 10-year-old putting on an 'adult' voice to make prank phone calls.\\" In 2018, Bilge Ebiri of The Village Voice wrote, \\"Its politics have been discussed ad infinitum. Its stylistic influence has become ubiquitous, then pass√©, then somehow aspirational ... The Dark Knight is perhaps the most powerful exploration of guilt the modern American blockbuster has given us.\\" Decade and all-time lists The Dark Knight was ranked the 15th-greatest film in history on Empire's 2008 list of the \\"500 Greatest Movies of All Time,\\" based upon the weighted votes of 10,000 readers, 150 film directors, and 50 key film critics. Heath Ledger's interpretation of the Joker was also ranked number three on Empires 2008 list of the \\"100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.\\" In June 2010, the Joker was ranked number five on Entertainment Weekly \\"100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years.\\" Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker ranked second on The Hollywood Reporters list of greatest superhero movie performances of all time, behind Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine. Paste magazine named it one of the 50 best movies of the decade (2000‚Äì2009), ranking it at number 11. In 2016, Playboy ranked the film number five on its list of 15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals. The Dark Knight was included in American Cinematographers \\"Best- Shot Film of 1998‚Äì2008\\" list, ranking in the top 10. More than 17,000 people around the world participated in the final vote. In March 2011, the film was voted by BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra listeners as their eighth-favorite film of all time. On the March 22, 2011 television special Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time, The Dark Knight was voted the second-best action film while the Joker, as portrayed by Ledger, was voted the third-greatest film character. Film critics Barry Norman and James Berardinelli included The Dark Knight in their rankings of the top 100 films of all time. In 2012, Total Film ranked The Dark Knight as the sixth most accomplished film of the past 15 years, writing that \\"Christopher Nolan's psycho-operatic crime drama was its decade's most exciting blockbuster‚Äîand its most challenging.\\" In 2014, Time Out polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. The Dark Knight was listed at 80th place on this list. A few years later the same magazine ranked it 15th on their \\"the 100 best movies of all time\\" list. In 2014, The Dark Knight was ranked the third- greatest film ever made on Empires list of \\"The 301 Greatest Movies of All Time\\" as voted by the magazine's readers. The film was also included and ranked 57th on Hollywood's 100 Favorite Films, a list compiled by The Hollywood Reporter, surveying \\"Studio chiefs, Oscar winners and TV royalty.\\" The Dark Knight ranked 96th on BBC's \\"100 Greatest American Films\\" list, voted on by film critics from around the world. It was also voted as one of New Zealand's favorite films in a 2015 poll. It was ranked the 33rd-best film of the 21st century by 177 film critics, polled by BBC in 2016, and was included in The Guardian 2019 list of \\"The 100 best films of the 21st century\\". In 2020, Empire magazine ranked it the third-best film of the 21st century. Commentary Mystery writer Andrew Klavan, writing in The Wall Street Journal, compared the extreme measures that Batman takes to fight crime with those U.S. President George W. Bush used in the War on Terror. Klavan claims that, \\"at some level\\" The Dark Knight is \\"a paean of praise to the fortitude and moral courage that has been shown by George W. Bush in this time of terror and war\\". Klavan supports this reading of the film by comparing Batman‚Äîlike Bush, Klavan argues‚Äî\\"sometimes has to push the boundaries of civil rights to deal with an emergency, certain that he will re-establish those boundaries when the emergency is past.\\" Klavan's article has received criticism on the Internet and in mainstream media outlets, such as in The New Republics \\"The Plank\\". Reviewing the film in The Sunday Times, Cosmo Landesman reached the opposite conclusion to Klavan, arguing that The Dark Knight \\"offers up a lot of moralistic waffle about how we must hug a terrorist‚Äîokay, I exaggerate. At its heart, however, is a long and tedious discussion about how individuals and society must never abandon the rule of law in struggling against the forces of lawlessness. In fighting monsters, we must be careful not to become monsters‚Äîthat sort of thing. The film champions the anti-war coalition's claim that, in having a war on terror, you create the conditions for more terror. We are shown that innocent people died because of Batman‚Äîand he falls for it.\\" Benjamin Kerstein, writing in Azure, says that both Klavan and Landesman \\"have a point\\", because \\"The Dark Knight is a perfect mirror of the society which is watching it: a society so divided on the issues of terror and how to fight it that, for the first time in decades, an American mainstream no longer exists.\\" Former U.S. president Barack Obama used the film to help explain how he understood the role and growth of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). \\"There's a scene in the beginning in which the gang leaders of Gotham are meeting... These are men who had the city divided up. They were thugs, but there was a kind of order. Everyone had his turf. And then the Joker comes in and lights the whole city on fire. ISIS is the Joker. It has the capacity to set the whole region on fire. That's why we have to fight it.\\" Themes and analysis According to David S. Goyer, the primary theme of The Dark Knight is escalation. Gotham City is weak and the citizens blame Batman for the city's violence and corruption as well as the Joker's threats, and it pushes his limits, making him feel that taking the laws into his own hands is further downgrading the city. Roger Ebert noted, \\"Throughout the film, [the Joker] devises ingenious situations that force Batman, Commissioner Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent to make impossible ethical decisions. By the end, the whole moral foundation of the Batman legend is threatened.\\" Other critics have mentioned the theme of the triumph of evil over good. Harvey Dent is seen as Gotham's \\"White Knight\\" in the beginning of the film but ends up becoming seduced to evil. The Joker, on the other hand, is seen as the representation of anarchy and chaos. He has no motive, no orders, and no desires but to cause havoc and \\"watch the world burn\\". The terrible logic of human error is another theme as well. The ferry scene displays how humans can easily be enticed by iniquity, and how that could lead to potential disaster. The Dark Knight is described as a neo-noir film by some authors. Awards The Tumbler at the film's European premiere in Leicester Square, London Most notable among the nominations were Heath Ledger's almost complete sweep of over twenty awards for acting, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actor, the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture, and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The Dark Knight also received nominations from the Writers Guild of America (for Best Adapted Screenplay), the Producers Guild of America, and the Directors Guild of America, as well as a slew of other guild award nominations and wins. It was nominated for Best Film at the Critics Choice Awards and was named one of the top ten films of 2008 by the American Film Institute. The Dark Knight was nominated for eight Academy Awards for the 81st Ceremony, breaking the previous record of seven held by Dick Tracy for the most nominations received by a film based on a comic book, comic strip, or graphic novel. The Dark Knight won two awards: Best Supporting Actor for Heath Ledger and Best Sound Editing. It was additionally nominated for six others, these being Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Visual Effects, Best Makeup, and Best Film Editing. Heath Ledger was the first posthumous winner of the Best Supporting Actor award, and only the second posthumous acting winner ever (Peter Finch posthumously won the Best Actor award for his performance in the 1976 film Network). In addition, Ledger's win marked the first win in any of the major Oscar categories (producing, directing, acting, or writing) for a superhero-based film. Notably, Richard King's win in the Sound Editing category blocked a complete awards sweep of the evening by the eventual Best Picture winner, Slumdog Millionaire. Although it did not receive a Best Picture nomination, the show's opening song paid homage to The Dark Knight along with the five Best Picture nominees, including host Hugh Jackman riding on a mockup of the Batpod made out of garbage. In spite of the film's critical success, the film was noticeably absent from the Best Picture nominee list, prompting controversy and leading many to criticize the Academy Awards for \\"snubbing\\" the film. There was speculation that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences later changed their number of Best Picture nominees to ten, instead of the traditional five, because of the film's omission. In a question-and-answer session that followed the announcement, the Academy's then president Sidney Ganis said; \\"I would not be telling you the truth if I said the words Dark Knight did not come up.\\" A British-American production, the film was nominated for the 2009 Goya Award for Best European Film.2009 Goya Awards Alt Film Guide. Retrieved September 30, 2011 It had a nomination in Japan for the 2009 Seiun Awards under the Science Fiction category with a Japan Academy Prize Award for Best Foreign Film. Box office Coliseum cinema in Barcelona, Spain The Dark Knight earned $534.9million in North America and $469.7million in other territories for a worldwide total of $1billion. Worldwide, it became the fourth-highest- grossing film, the highest-grossing film of 2008, and the fourth film in history to gross more than $1billion. It made $199.7million on its worldwide opening weekend, which ranks 34th on the all-time chart. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 74.26million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run. In order to increase the film's chances of crossing $1billion in worldwide gross and of winning Oscars, Warner Bros. re-released the film in traditional and IMAX theaters in the United States and other countries on January 23, 2009. Before the re-release, the film's gross remained at $997million, but following the re-release, the film crossed the $1billion mark in February 2009. =North America= The Dark Knight opened on Friday, July 18, 2008. It set a record for midnight showings, earning $18.5million from 3,040 theaters (a record first surpassed by Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince). The midnight opening included $640,000 from IMAX screenings. It was then shown on 9,200 screens at a record 4,366 theaters (a record first surpassed by Iron Man 2), also setting an opening and single-day record gross, with $67.2million (both records first surpassed by The Twilight Saga: New Moon), and an opening-weekend record, with $158.4million (first surpassed by Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 2). The weekend per theater average of $36,283 stands as the fifth-largest of all time. It sold an estimated 22.37million tickets during its first weekend with 2008's average admission of $7.08, meaning the film sold more tickets than Spider-Man 3, which sold 21.96million with the average price of $6.88 in 2007. Additionally, the film set an IMAX opening-weekend record, with $6.3million (a record first surpassed by Star Trek). It achieved the largest Sunday gross with $43.6million and the largest opening week from Friday to Thursday with $238.6million (both records surpassed by Marvel's The Avengers). It also achieved the largest cumulative gross through its third and fourth days of release (both records first surpassed by Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 2) and so on until its tenth day of release (records surpassed by Marvel's The Avengers). Moreover, it was the fastest film to reach $100million (a record first surpassed by New Moon), $150million and each additional $50million through $450million (records surpassed by Marvel's The Avengers), and $500million (a record first surpassed by Avatar). Finally, it achieved the largest second- weekend gross (a record first surpassed by Avatar). It has grossed the fourth- largest Saturday gross ($51,336,732). On its first Monday, it grossed $24.5million, which stands as the largest non-holiday Monday gross and the fourth-largest Monday gross overall, and on its first Tuesday, it grossed another $20.9million, which stands as the largest non-opening Tuesday gross and the second-largest Tuesday gross overall. Notably, it topped the box office during the second-biggest weekend of all time in North America (aggregated total of $253,586,871) and it was the only 2008 film that remained on top of the box office charts for four consecutive weekends. The Dark Knight is the highest-grossing film of 2008, the second-highest-grossing superhero film, the second-highest-grossing film based on comics, and the fourth- highest-grossing North American film of all time. Adjusted for ticket-price inflation though, it ranks 28th. In contrast to Avatar and Titanic‚Äîboth which grossed more than The Dark Knight in North America and had slow but steady earnings‚ÄîThe Dark Knight broke records in its opening weekend and slowed down significantly after its first few weekends. =Outside North America= Overseas, The Dark Knight is the highest-grossing 2008 film and the fourth- highest-grossing superhero film. It premiered in 20 other territories on 4,520 screens, grossing $41.3million in its first weekend. The film came second to Hancock, which was screening in 71 territories in its third weekend. The Dark Knights biggest territory was Australia, where it grossed $13.7million over the weekend, setting a record for the largest superhero film opening. It topped the weekend box office outside North America three consecutive times and four in total. Citing cultural sensitivities to some elements in the film, and a reluctance to adhere to pre-release conditions, Warner Bros. declined to release the film in mainland China. Its highest-grossing market after North America was the UK, Ireland, and Malta, where it earned $89.1million. Also, in Australia, it earned of $39.9million, still remaining in the all-time top 10 of the country. The five highest-grossing markets outside North America also include Germany ($29.7million), France and the Maghreb region ($27.5million) and South Korea ($25.0million). Home media The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in North America on December 9, 2008. Releases include a one- disc edition DVD; a two-disc Special Edition DVD; a two-disc edition BD; and a special edition BD package featuring a statuette of the Bat-pod.

In March 2011, Warner Bros. offered The Dark Knight for rent on Facebook, becoming the first film ever to be released via digital distribution on a social networking site. Users in the United States were able to use Facebook Credits to view the film. The Dark Knight was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on December 19, 2017.  Legacy  According to David Sims of The Atlantic, The Dark Knight \\"legitimized\\" the genre of the comic book movie in the eyes of film studios, thereby setting the stage for the success of franchises such as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Darren Franrich of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the film \\"cemented a new way of talking about superhero movies,\\" specifically one that acknowledged them as serious vehicles for political commentary and artistic achievement. Multiple elements of The Dark Knight had a profound influence on a number of subsequent motion pictures. For example, director Ryan Coogler cited The Dark Knight depiction of Gotham City as a partial inspiration for the representation of Wakanda in the 2018 blockbuster Black Panther. Meanwhile, Michael B. Jordan named Ledger's performance as an influence for the former's portrayal of Killmonger, the villain in Black Panther. Director Sam Mendes called The Dark Knight a \\"game changer for everybody,\\" saying that it influenced his approach to making Skyfall (2012): \\"What Nolan proved was that you can make a huge movie that is thrilling and entertaining and has a lot to say about the world we live in ... That did help give me the confidence to take this movie in directions that, without The Dark Knight, might not have been possible.\\" Composer Blake Neely's music for the TV show Arrow likewise drew upon Hans Zimmer's score for The Dark Knight. Furthermore, in a tenth anniversary retrospective for Rotten Tomatoes, Erik Amaya credited Ledger's performance with providing a novel interpretation of the Joker for the general public, one that proved to be a template for later cinematic portrayals. Several critics have noted that later films imitated The Dark Knights dark and gritty tone without replicating the quality of its writing, acting, or plot structure. According to Charles Bramesco of The Guardian, many of the movies in the DC Extended Universe‚Äîsuch as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Suicide Squad, and Justice League‚Äî\\"affected a joylessness bastardized from Nolan's well-founded solemnity.\\" Chris Newbould of The National reached a similar conclusion, bemoaning how DCEU films \\"have failed to excite audiences and critics alike and have performed passably at best at the box office.\\" Nick Pope of Esquire accused The Dark Knight of encouraging future superhero films \\"to take [themselves] far too seriously.\\"  See also  *Batman in film *Vigilante film *List of films featuring surveillance *Film censorship in China *Crime film References Further reading * * * External links * (Warner Bros.) * (DC Comics) The Dark Knight: Blu-ray Disc Review at HD Report Category:2008 action thriller films Category:2008 crime drama films Category:2000s superhero films Category:2008 films Category:American action thriller films Category:American crime drama films Category:American films Category:American sequel films Category:American superhero films Category:BAFTA winners (films) Category:British action thriller films Category:British crime drama films Category:British films Category:British sequel films Category:Crime action films Category:English-language films Category:Films about bank robbery Category:Films about kidnapping Category:Films about psychopaths Category:Films about security and surveillance Category:Films about ship hijackings Category:Films about terrorism Category:Films about organized crime in the United States Category:Films directed by Christopher Nolan Category:Films featuring a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award-winning performance Category:Films featuring a Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe winning performance Category:Films produced by Charles Roven Category:Films produced by Christopher Nolan Category:Films produced by Emma Thomas Category:Films scored by Hans Zimmer Category:Films scored by James Newton Howard Category:Films set in 2006 Category:Films set in Hong Kong Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios Category:Films shot in Chicago Category:Films shot in Hong Kong Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in the United Kingdom Category:Films that won the Best Sound Editing Academy Award Category:Films using computer-generated imagery Category:IMAX films Category:Legendary Pictures films Category:American neo- noir films Category:Films with screenplays by Christopher Nolan Category:Films with screenplays by Jonathan Nolan Category:Syncopy Inc. films *2 Category:Warner Bros. films Category:2008 drama films ","title":"The Dark Knight (film)"},{"id":"4276485","title":"David Lodge (voice actor)"},{"id":"4276491","text":"√Åed mac Ainmuirech (born c.530 - died 598) was high-king of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill. He belonged to the Cen√©l Conaill and was a distant cousin of Columba of Iona. He was the son of Ainmuire mac S√©tnai (died 569), a previous possible high king.Byrne, Table 4; Appendix IV; Mac Niocaill, pg.81 His mother was Br√≠g, daughter of Chobtaig, son of Ailill, son of Nath √ç, son of Crimthann mac √ânnai son of √ânnae Cennsalach of the U√≠ Ceinnselaig dynasty from Leinster.'Corpus Genealogiarum Sanctorum Hiberniae', √ì Riain, P√°draig, ed., Dublin: Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1985, ¬ß380.1 He was born in 530 according to the Annals of Tigernach (596.2). He came to power some decades after the death of the last old, pagan style high-king of Tara, Diarmait mac Cerbaill (d. 565), after a period in which it is not clear that the U√≠ N√©ill had a high-king, nor is it certain that his contemporaries would have acknowledged √Åed as such.Byrne, pp. 110‚Äì111. The high kingship of Ireland rotated between the Cen√©l nE√≥gain and Cen√©l Conaill branches in the late 6th century.Charles-Edwards, pg.494‚Äì495 It is difficult to disentangle the reign of √Åed from that of his older second cousin B√°et√°n mac Ninneda (died 586). Various lengths are given to the reign of √Åed in the kinglists all of which would put the start of his reign before the death of B√°et√°n.Charles-Edwards, pg.487 Both kings are omitted from the Baile Chuinn, the earliest Irish king list of the late 7th century, but this was probably a partisan document.Charles-Edwards, pg.491 It is possible that B√°et√°n was not actually high king but was given this position by the synthetic historians to explain away the rule of B√°et√°n mac Cairill (died 581) of the Dal Fiatach of Ulster as high king.Byrne, pg.114 The kinglists only assign him a reign of one year. Whether B√°et√°n was king of Tara or not, the real effective power among the northern Ui Neill was √Åed mac Ainmuirech.Mac Niocaill, pg.72 He is known to have met with √Åed√°n mac Gabr√°in, king of D√°l Riata, in 575 at The Synod or Convention of Drumceat, to agree an alliance, presumably arranged by his cousin Columba. √Åed and √Åed√°n were both threatened by the activities of the Ulaid king, B√°et√°n mac Cairill of the D√°l Fiatach, and it served both interests that D√°l Riata not be subjected to the ambitious B√°et√°n. In this they succeeded.Adomn√°n, note 204; Byrne, pp. 109‚Äì111. √Åed may have become high king after this possibly in 576. It is also quite possible that this conference did not take place until circa 587 which is the date recorded in the Annals of Clonmacnoise.Charles-Edwards, pg.487, note79 The death of B√°et√°n mac Ninneda had occurred in 586 and the Annals of Ulster record two death dates for B√°et√°n mac Cairill, one being in 587.Annals of Ulster, 587.3 A challenge to the rule of √Åed among the northern Ui Neill was launched by Colcu mac Domnaill of the Cen√©l nE√≥gain branch. However they clashed at the Battle of Druim Meic Erce (Drumhirk, modern County Tyrone) in 580 and Colcu was slain.Annals of Ulster AU 580.1, 581.1; 586.2 Annals of Tigernach AT 578.1; Mac Niocaill, pg.80 Then in 586, B√°et√°n mac Ninneda was killed at L√©im in Eich at the instigation of Colm√°n Bec (died 587), the southern Ui Neill king of Uisnech who was making a bid for the high kingship, and who may have made an earlier bid in 573.AU 586.1; AT 584.1; Mac Niocaill, pg.80 In 587 √Åed ended this threat when Colman was slain at the battle of Belach Dathi.AU 587.2; AT 585.1; Mac Niocaill, pg.80 Another challenge to √Åed may have come from the direction of Ulster in the person of Fiachnae mac B√°et√°in (died 626) of the D√°l nAraidi. At the royal conference at Druim Cett the affairs of Osraige had been discussed implying an influence by √Åed over the affairs of Munster.Charles-Edwards, pg.490 In 597 Fiachnae won the Battle of Sliab Cua in the territory of Munster.AU 597.2; 603.5; AT 595.2 Fiachnae had earlier won a battle over the Ciannachta of Brega in 594.Au 594.1; AT 592.1 There is a possibility that Fiachnae was a king of Tara in the 590's.Charles-Edwards, pg.500 √Åed came into conflict with Brandub mac Echach, King of Leinster from the U√≠ Cheinnselaig who was resisting Ui Neill encroachment. According to the saga tradition preserved in the Bor√∫ma Laigin (Cattle Tribute of Leinster), Brandub had killed Cummascach, the son of √Åed for demanding the right to sleep with Brandub's wife during a royal tour.Mac Niocaill, pg.81‚Äì82; Byrne, pg.145 The annals record Brandub's killing of √Åed's son Cummascach in 597 at D√∫n Buchat.AU 597.1; AT 595.1 However, at the battle of D√∫n Bolg (Dunboyke, modern County Wicklow) in 598, √Åed was defeated and killed by Brandub.AU 598.2; AT 596.2; Mac Niocaill, pg.82 √Åed had close relations with his cousin Saint Columba. He may have commissioned a eulogy upon the saint's death and most likely granted the land for the monastery of Durrow.Charles-Edwards, pp.289, 555 √Åed was followed as king of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill by Colm√°n R√≠mid, son of B√°et√°n mac Muirchertaig, of the Cen√©l nE√≥gain. √Åed's son Conall C√∫ mac √Åedo (died 604) failed in a bid for the high kingship after his death but his sons M√°el Cobo (died 615) and Domnall (died 642) were later high kings of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill.Byrne, pp. 281, 283.

The school also has a sizable international population, with foreign nationals comprising 33% of the student body, representing 55 different countries.  Academics  As an International Baccalaureate (IB) World School, Lausanne's academic curriculum is vertically aligned from age 3 through 12th grade. The school became the 19th school nationwide to receive PK through 12th grade International Baccalaureate accreditation. Building blocks of the IB Diploma Programme can be seen across the Lower, Middle and Upper School. Lower School students presenting their findings about the solar system to their school.  Lower School (PK, JK, SK and Grades 1-4)  Each class in Lower School incorporates activities for individual levels of readiness to allow for children to grow at their own rate and pattern. Units of inquiry and hands-on projects are designed to enhance students' preparation to thematic teaching. Small class sizes, daily Mandarin and Spanish classes and a project approach to learning are highlights. The Lower School became IB Primary Years Programme accredited fall of 2018.

History of Lausanne  Founding and Central Avenue Campus (1926-1953)  In 1926, Emma DeSaussure Jett, Bessie Statler, and two other veteran teachers left St. Mary's Episcopal School and founded their own small private girls‚Äô school at 1649 Central Avenue in Memphis.left Originally named Lausanne School for Girls, the school was named after the Swiss city of Lausanne, a city that prided itself on elite education (see Education in Switzerland), and the area from which Mrs. Jett's DeSaussure ancestors had migrated to America. In the 1930s during the Great Depression, maintaining the private school was difficult. The women marshaled forward, lead by their vision of providing the best education possible. But even with the return of prosperity following World War II, Lausanne's viability remained tenuous. Luckily, the physical plant of recently dissolved Pentecost-Garrison School at Union Extended and Hollywood became available in 1952, and Lausanne secured a favorable lease on the property.  Union Avenue Campus (1953-1959)  To facilitate the school's continuation, Principals Statler and Jett converted what had been their proprietary school to a not-for-profit educational foundation. During the early years on Union, there were problems with the school's management, its enrollment declined, and it again seemed in danger of becoming defunct. Lausanne families, however, fought back. They held fund raisers like carnivals and spaghetti suppers to help generate revenue. More productively, Mrs. Nelse R. Thompson, a long time patron of the school and a member of the educational foundation's board, determined to make the school financially secure. Working in tandem with Headmistress Myrtle Cobb, whom the board had hired away from a tenured position at Memphis State College, Mrs. Thompson pulled off a near miracle. Her personal donations and astute solicitations insured the raising of sufficient funds for a new beginning as a boarding school. Within two years, Lausanne had purchased a twenty-acre campus site on Massey Road and had also acquired the funds necessary to build an impressive physical plant.  Massey Campus (1959-present)  Mrs. Thompson's plan for the school to provide a prestigious boarding environment was successful, and for a number of years brought in significantly more income than its operations cost. Walter Coppedge with B.F. Skinner Shortly after the school moved to Massey Road, Mrs. Cobb resigned as headmistress, and the board hired Walter R. Coppedge as Headmaster and the only male member of the faculty. Although he had no administrative training or experience, Coppedge proved a strong choice. He was generally popular with the school's board, faculty and staff, students, and parents. A cultured child of the Mississippi Delta, he was also a well- traveled former Rhodes Scholar. His innovations included: marvelous open letters to the school's various constituencies and a high-profile lecture series that brought in international caliber visiting lecturers including William Buckley, Jr., Dr. Margaret Mead and Aldous Huxley. He also expanded the school's push towards international education with annual traveling summer courses held in Europe and Mexico and other major educational travel experiences. Coppedge's five-year tenure took Lausanne to new levels of intellectual openness, community exposure and general excellence. Thomas Eppley, a Lausanne history teacher became headmaster in 1965 and his 21-year tenure brought many additional changes. Notable among these were: racial integration, a Montessori program, the school's gradual conversion to coeducational status and eventual growth away from the Montessori Method. Although boys had been enrolled in Lausanne's kindergarten program as early as the 1930s, the expansion of the Montessori Method through lower school expanded enrollment of boys in all grades pre-kindergarten through sixth. Extensive investigation led faculty, administration and board members to conclude that coeducation was preferable to single-sex education in many respects. The Upper School became gender integrated in the late-1970s, and Lausanne graduated its first co-ed class in 1981. The boarding school brought ethnically and regionally diverse students into the Lausanne community (enriching its informal learning) and its athletic and arts programs. Flags hanging in the Tully Dining Hall recognize 65 different countries represented by Lausanne students over the decades. Despite achievements and milestones during Eppley's administration, in his last few years the school faced declining enrollments and financial stresses. Eppley stepped down, replaced by Charles Henderson, who had been successful as headmaster at two other schools. Problems persisted, however, to the point that Lausanne strongly considered a merger with Hutchison School. In 1992, the board hired George Elder to run Lausanne. The school later added Tanner Hall, Shockey Hall and the Elder Performing Arts Center. He also expanded the arts, athletic and academic programs, especially strengthening the areas of technology, mathematics and science. After an interim headmaster, current Headmaster, Stuart McCathie, took Lausanne's helm in 2005. Headmaster Stuart McCathie shares some time with kindergarten students painting. McCathie has continued to expand the school's enrollment and financial viability, its physical plant (the Upper Middle School Building designed by The Crump Firm, the 60,000 square-foot library and indoor sports complex, a centralized technology center, the Blue Heron Caf√© and outdoor sports complex renovation) and its athletic programs. He also expanded the cafeteria, built a new library and gym, and placed a mini-caf√© in the lobby of the new library (2012). In 2010 Lausanne was designated as an International Baccalaureate World School (IB). In 2016, the school announced that they would open their second campus, Xiamen #1 Lausanne International School, in Xiamen, China in the fall of 2017. Lausanne Learning Institute The school's technology program, specifically its one-to-one laptop program has been internationally recognizedhttp://davidwarlick.com/wordpress/?p=1208http://www.wreg.com/wreg- laptop-institute,0,4118239.story through its operation of the Lausanne Laptop Institute since 2003. In 2013, the program was renamed the Lausanne Learning Institute to focus more on new styles of pedagogy for classrooms using technology.http://www.lausannelearning.com In 2017, Lausanne Learning began organizing and facilitating conferences across the United States on a variety of educational themes, such as technology in the classroom, social-emotional learning, and design thinking.

The tower house known as Jordan's Castle is a State Care Historic Monument sited in the townland of Ardglass, in the Newry, Mourne and Down District Council area, at grid ref: J5601 3713. It stands close to the junction of Kildare and Quay Streets in Ardglass and commands the harbour. Features It is a rectangular Tower house four storeys high, i.e. four superimposed single chambers each about . On the north face are two rectangular projections, one containing a stone spiral staircase, the other an inner closet at each level, with those on the lower stages having outlets to the ground. Architecturally there is little evidence to give a definitive date for the castle. The masonry is blue stone rubble with a little freestone in quoins and window jambs. Some of the window details suggest 15th century, but have had so much reconstruction that dating is difficult. The ground floor chamber is unfloored and the irregular surface of the outcropping rock can be seen. It therefore may have been a storehouse. The main room is apparently on the first floor, which contains its original stone floor supported on a pointed barrel vault. The floors on the second and third storeys are at the original levels but of modern construction, with the beams going at right angles to the original direction. The concrete roof is also an addition. The wall tops retain their stone-flagged rampart walls and archery turrets. The turret to the north-west contains a dovecote, the nest- holes of which are contemporary with the main structure. The entrance is at the bottom of the north-west tower and leads to a spiral stairway to roof level. It is protected by a machicolation at that level. The projecting towers are connected by a high-level arch which also functions as a machicolation. The Dublin Penny Journal of 30 March 1833 describes Jordan's Castle as follows: History Its early history is somewhat obscure. The earliest authentic reference is to a defence of the castle by Simon Jordan against the O'Neills for three years, until relieved by Lord Deputy Mountjoy in 1601. The 18th century historian, Harris, says that \\"it is most probable that Jordan's Castle was erected by one of the family, whose arms (a cross and three horseshoes) are fixed in a stone near the top\\". In 1911 the Belfast antiquarian, Francis Joseph Bigger, bought the castle and restored it, using it to display his extensive collection of antiquities and making it freely accessible to everyone to bring local people 'into touch with the Irish past, and give them some conception of the historic background of their life'.Stopford Green, Alice 'A Castle in Ardglass' in The Old Irish World, Gill & MacMillan (Dublin and London, 1912), p.151 It was also extensively used for get-togethers of the wide circle of Irish Cultural revival artists and writers to whom Bigger was friend and patron. Following suggestions by Alice Stopford Green and the archivist Henry Egan Kenny, Bigger renamed the tower \\"Castle Se√°n' in honour of the two years when Shane O'Neill (Se√°n √ì N√©ill) controlled Ardglass, and they believed, re-fortified the tower\\"Sean Ghall\\" (Henry Egan Kenny), 'An Historical Note on Shane O'Neill,' The Catholic Bulletin, vol XIII, April‚ÄìMay 1923, pgs, 311‚Äì314 following his defeat of the MacDonnells at Glentaisie in 1565.Stopford Green, Alice 'A Castle in Ardglass' in The Old Irish World, Gill & MacMillan (Dublin and London, 1912), pp. 141. When he died in 1926, the castle was presented by his executor, Dr Joseph Bigger, to the state on condition that, with its contents, it should be preserved as an Ancient Monument. The contents have since been dispersed among the Ulster Museums general collections and the tower is no longer open to the public.

After his exit from office in March 1998, he maintained a relatively low profile in politics. He was also denied party candidature for the Rajya Sabha once his last term ended in April 2000. As the President of the Indian National Congress After P.V. Narasimha Rao stepped down as president of the Congress in September 1996, Kesri was appointed as the new president of the Indian National Congress. The following years were difficult for the Congress Party. Kesri's lack of popular support among the masses caused further damage to the party. Kesri's most controversial act was the sudden withdrawal of support to H.D. Deva Gowda's United Front government, which led to the fall of the government in April 1997. However, a compromise was reached and the United Front elected I.K. Gujral as the subsequent new leader with continued support from the Congress party. In the first week of November 1997, part of the Jain Commission's report inquiring into the conspiracy angle of the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi was leaked to the press. It was reported that the Jain Commission had indicted Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) for its ties with the LTTE, the organisation involved in the assassination of Gandhi. The DMK was one of the constituents of the United Front that was in power at the center. Moreover the party had three ministers on the council of ministers headed by Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral. The Congress demanded removal from the government the ministers belonging to the DMK. Between 20 and 28 November 1997, an exchange of letters took place between Kesri and Prime Minister Gujral; however, the prime minister refused to meet the demands of the Congress. Finally, on 28 November 1997, Congress withdrew its support for the Gujral government. When no alternative government could be formed, the Lok Sabha was dissolved, paving the way for midterm elections. The Congress did not adequately prepare for the midterm elections. A number of senior leaders of the party, such as Rangarajan Kumaramangalam, Aslam Sher Khan, and other leaders, openly expressed displeasure with Kesri's leadership and left the party. After Sonia Gandhi decided to campaign for the party, she replaced Kesri as the main party campaigner. Sonia attracted huge crowds in her campaign rallies but did not win the election for the party. Nevertheless, the Congress did maintain a respectable tally of 140 seats. During the election campaign, there were a series of bomb blasts in Coimbatore, where BJP President Lal Krishna Advani was scheduled to address an election rally. About 50 people were killed in the blasts. After the blasts, Kesri made a statement that the bomb blasts were the handiwork of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and moreover, he had the proof of RSS involvement in the blasts. The RSS sued Kesri for defamation, but Kesri was granted bail by a city court in 1998.Sitaram Kesri gets bail in RSS defamation case Indian Express ‚Äì 5 May 1998 After the electoral defeat, Kesri was stripped of his post in March 1998 by the Congress Working Committee.Kesri and three transitions in Cong. The Hindu ‚Äì 26 October 2000 Sonia Gandhi was appointed president of the Congress party in his place. Kesri's removal from the Congress Working Committee is considered by some as a betrayal of the party constitution, considering how Pranab Mukherjee and others conspired to eliminate Kesri from the party for Sonia Gandhi.http://epaper.dnaindia.com/newsview.aspx?eddate=7/10/2011&pageno;=15&edition;=20&prntid;=144322&bxid;=31766966&pgno;=15 Kesri, along with other members of the Working Committee including Tariq Anwar, was \\"roughed up\\" at Congress Party headquarters on 19 May 1999 by what has been described as an \\"angry mob\\"\\"Congress Plans More Powers for Sonia\\", The Indian Express, 23 May 1999 and \\"Congress goons\\", following the split in the Congress that led to the formation of the Nationalist Congress Party.

(Grid ref: 561 371) History The 15th century structures were converted into a castellated house at the end of the 18th century by Charles FitzGerald, the first and last Baron Lecale. The castle was also lived in by his mother, Emily FitzGerald, Duchess of Leinster, and her second husband, William Ogilvie, who had been tutor to her son, Lord Edward FitzGerald. Ogilvie subsequently worked to develop Ardglass as a fashionable seaside resort and port. The old warehouses were given battlements, regular windows and the interior was decorated with plasterwork of the period. It was eventually inherited by William Ogilvie's daughter by a former marriage, who was the wife of Charles Beauclerk, a great grandson of Charles Beauclerk, 1st Duke of St Albans. In the later 19th century there was further work on the windows and a porch added to one front. The castle became the premises of Ardglass Golf Club in 1911.

Pierlot, a lawyer and jurist, served in World War I before entering politics in the 1920s. A member of the Catholic Party, Pierlot became Prime Minister in 1939, shortly before Belgium entered World War II. In this capacity, he headed the Belgian government in exile, first from France and later Britain, while Belgium was under German occupation. During the German invasion of Belgium in May 1940, a violent disagreement broke out between Pierlot and King Leopold III over whether the King should follow the orders of his ministers and go into exile or surrender to the German Army. Pierlot considered Leopold's subsequent surrender a breach of the Constitution and encouraged the parliament to declare Leopold unfit to reign. The confrontation provoked a lasting animosity between Pierlot and other conservatives, who supported the King's position and considered the government's exile to be cowardly. While in exile in London between 1940 and 1944, Pierlot served as both Prime Minister and Minister of Defence and played an important role in wartime negotiations between the Allied powers, laying the foundation for Belgian post-war reconstruction. After the liberation of Belgium in September 1944, Pierlot returned to Brussels where, against his wishes, he headed a fresh government of national unity until February 1945. Criticism from the political left and the failure of the new government to deal with the serious issues facing the country following the liberation led to the fall of the government in February 1945 and he was replaced by the socialist Achille Van Acker. Pierlot's stance against Leopold III during the war made him a controversial figure during his lifetime and he was widely disliked in the same royalist and conservative circles from which his own Catholic Party (later the Christian Social Party) drew most of its support. He retired from politics in 1946 amid the crisis of the Royal Question, surrounding whether Leopold could return to the Belgian throne, and died peacefully in 1963. After his death, Pierlot's reputation improved as the decisions he took during the war were reconsidered by historians. Birth and early career Pierlot was born in Cugnon, a small village between Bertrix and Bouillon, in the Belgian Province of Luxembourg on 23 December 1883. His parents belonged to an eminent and wealthy Catholic family which was part of the Belgian conservative establishment. His brother, Jean Pierlot, would later become a member of the Belgian Resistance during the war and died in a German concentration camp in 1944. View of the village of Cugnon where Pierlot was born in 1883 Hubert Pierlot was educated in religious schools in Maredsous and later attended the prestigious Jesuit Coll√®ge Saint-Michel secondary school in Brussels. He studied at the Catholic University of Louvain where he received a licence in Political Science and a doctorate in Law. During his early life, he travelled to the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. He later married Marie- Louise ( De Kinder) and had seven children. With the German invasion of Belgium in August 1914, he volunteered for the Belgian infantry as a private. He served at the Battle of the Yser and on the Yser Front where he was decorated for valour. By the end of the war, he had reached the rank of Lieutenant and was serving in the 20th Regiment of the Line. After the war, Pierlot joined the Catholic Party (Parti catholique), the main centre-right party in Belgium and one of the three that dominated Belgian political life. The Catholic Party, which was considered the party of stability and the establishment, was extremely electorally successful during the interwar period and headed a series of coalition governments. On 23 December 1925, Pierlot entered parliament as a member of the Chamber of Deputies representing Neufch√¢teau-Virton but left just a week later to become a senator. He served as provincial senator for Luxembourg from 1926 to 1936 and as directly elected senator for the same province between 1936 and 1946. He received a reputation for his oratorical abilities and for personal sincerity during the late 1920s. In the successive Catholic government of the interwar period, he served as Minister of Internal Affairs (1934‚Äì35), Minister of Agriculture (1934‚Äì35; 1936‚Äì39), and Minister of Foreign Affairs (1939). He first led a coalition of Catholics and Socialists, and then one of Catholics and Liberals. As Prime Minister During the interwar period, Belgium pursued a policy of political neutrality and attempted to avoid confrontation with Nazi Germany. When the Phoney War broke out, Pierlot became the leader of a tripartite national government of Catholics, Liberals and Socialists which stayed in power until the German invasion in May 1940. Break with Leopold III fighting in Belgium created a political crisis and lasting personal animosity. During the fighting in May 1940, the Pierlot government came into conflict with King Leopold III who had taken personal command of the Belgian Army. The first confrontation between the government and the King occurred on 10 May, when the King, against the wishes of the government, left for his military headquarters without addressing the Chamber of Representatives like his father, Albert I, had done in 1914. Contact between the King and the government became sporadic while the government feared that the King was acting beyond his constitutional powers. Like his father, Leopold was subject to Article 64 of the constitution which specified that no act of the King was valid unless counter-signed by a government minister, yet also given supreme power in military matters under Article 68. The two clauses appeared to contradict each other and gave all the king's acts in military-political matters an unclear constitutional footing. As the Belgian forces, together with their French and British allies, were forced to retreat, Leopold decided that surrendering the army was the only viable course of action. On 24 May, as the government was leaving the country for exile in France, a group of ministers including Pierlot held a final meeting with Leopold at the Kasteel van Wijnendale. They called for him to follow the example of the Norwegian king, Haakon VII, and join them in exile as a symbol of continued resistance. Leopold refused, believing that as commander, he should surrender alongside his army, provoking real animosity. He also believed that, by leaving for France, the Belgian government would surrender its neutrality and become a puppet government. He also believed that, as a neutral power with no formal treaty of alliance with France or Britain, the Belgian army was not obliged to hold out as long as it possibly could if it incurred huge casualties and had no chance of defending its own territory. On 28 May, after a brief attempt to form a new government of sympathetic politicians under Henri De Man and after denouncing Pierlot and his government, Leopold surrendered to the Germans and was made a prisoner of war. Leopold's decision to surrender was seized on by the British and French press who blamed him for the military situation. The Belgian government met in Paris on 26 May and invoked Article 82 of the Constitution, declaring the monarch unable to reign (dans l'impossibilit√© de r√©gner), and resolved to continue the fight against Germany. The following day, Pierlot held an important meeting with the French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud, in which the French premier called for the Belgian government to publicly denounce the King and his surrender. Following the meeting, Pierlot gave a radio speech denouncing the King whom he accused of acting unconstitutionally and in sympathy with the Germans. Before being broadcast, Pierlot's speech was heavily edited by the French minister Georges Mandel to ensure a position favorable to the French. The denunciation of the King, who was popular across most strata of Belgian society and supported by the church, led to a big loss of public support and alienated Pierlot from his supporters and party.

This is commemorated by a plaque on the building. The government met in Limoges and then withdrew to Poitiers and Bordeaux, but as the French military situation deteriorated, became split over what should happen. The government was split between those who supported staying in France or staying with the French government and those who supported withdrawing to the United Kingdom. Pierlot supported retreating to London, but was keen to preserve the unity of his government, most of which supported remaining in France. Hoping to keep the Belgian Congo under Belgian sovereignty, Pierlot allowed the Minister of the Colonies, Albert de Vleeschauwer, to leave France while the government met to consider whether it should resign to make way for a new constitutional authority in occupied Brussels. Fearing a surrender to the Germans, Marcel-Henri Jaspar, a junior minister, left France for London where, together with Camille Huysmans, he appeared to form a rebel government or Belgian National Committee (Comit√© national belge) condemned by the official government. De Vleeschauwer arrived in London, where he was joined by Camille Gutt, the Minister of Finances, to deal with the threat. Pierlot remained in France. De Vleeschauwer travelled to neutral Spain where, at Le Perthus on the French-Spanish border, he met with Pierlot and Paul-Henri Spaak, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to attempt to persuade them to join him in London. Pierlot refused. Continued negotiations with the new Vichy government of Philippe P√©tain proved fruitless. In August 1940, under pressure from the Germans, the French broke off diplomatic relations with the Belgian government and ordered it to disband. On 22 August, Pierlot and Spaak received the permission of the government to leave for London while the rest of the government remained in France. Pierlot and Spaak, together with Pierlot's family, crossed into Francoist Spain with an official visa, but were arrested in Barcelona and held under house arrest in a hotel. On 18 October, they escaped from confinement and headed for Portugal where the regime of Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar, although neutral, was more sympathetic to the Allied cause than Spain. They finally arrived in London on 22 October. Exile government in London View of Eaton Square in London, where the government in exile was based through much of the war Shortly after his arrived in London, during the middle of the Blitz, Pierlot narrowly avoided being killed when the Carlton Hotel, where he was staying, was destroyed in bombing in November 1940. The arrival of Pierlot and Spaak officially began the period of the \\"Government of Four\\" (Pierlot, Spaak, Gutt and De Vleeschauwer) which formed the core of the Belgian government in exile. Nonetheless, the Foreign Office distrusted Pierlot for not leaving France sooner. The Foreign Minister, Anthony Eden, is said to have remarked that \\"Pierlot is not impressive, but he is legitimate\\". Pierlot's status as the last elected Prime Minister did however provided sufficient legitimacy for the official government to undermine the Jaspar-Huysmans government in the eyes of the British government and achieve officially-approved status. The government in exile received full diplomatic recognition from the Allied countries. The bulk of the Belgian government was installed in Eaton Square in the Belgravia area of London, which before the war had been the location of the Belgian Embassy. Other government departments were installed in nearby Hobart Place, Belgrave Square and in Knightsbridge. By May 1941, there were nearly 750 people working in the government in London in all capacities. The government in exile directed the formation of the Free Belgian Forces and was negotiated with the Resistance and other Allied governments. The government in exile also controlled much of Belgium's gold reserves, which had been evacuated before the defeat, which it loaned to the British and American governments. It was also involved in coordinating the war effort of the Belgian Congo which was an important source of raw materials, like uranium, to the Allies. From early in the war, the government was able to make contact with Leopold, through various intermediaries, but was unable to create a full reconciliation between the royal and Pierlot factions. On 28 April 1941, Pierlot's two eldest children were travelling to their boarding school when the train they were on caught fire near Westborough, Lincolnshire. Both were killed. Pierlot was one of the chief supporters of the Benelux Customs Union negotiated with both the Dutch and Luxembourgish governments in exile and signed in September 1944. Unlike Spaak, who was a staunch supporter of greater cooperation between states in Western Europe, Pierlot supported a transatlantic alliance with the United States to guarantee Belgian independence after the end of the war. =Defence ministry crisis= Pierlot addresses a parade of Belgian soldiers at Tenby, Wales in 1940 From its inception, the position of Minister of Defence in the government in exile was heavily contested. The appointment of Henri Rolin, an academic, to the position was particularly resented. In October 1942, Pierlot dismissed Rolin who he accused of involving himself in factional internal politics of the army, parts of which had begun to behave mutinously about their perceived inaction. To resolve the deadlock, Pierlot decided to take on the position personally. He began a major restructuring of the command structure of the infantry in an ultimately successful attempt to resolve the situation. A minor mutiny among soldiers from an artillery battery was quickly suppressed in November 1942, but Pierlot was widely criticised by the British press during the soldiers' court martial in January 1943. In 1944, Pierlot began drawing up plans for the reorganization of the Belgian Army after the liberation, known as the Pierlot Plan (Plan Pierlot). The plan called for the formation of two brigades of infantry, six battalions of fusiliers, logistics and support units in Belgium immediately after liberation in order to fight alongside Allied troops during an invasion of Germany. In the longer term, these troops would form the core of a new division around which more troops could be raised. Liberation governments The liberation of Belgium begun in September 1944 as Allied forces moved eastwards. Brussels was liberated on 3 September. On 8 September, Pierlot and the government in exile arrived in the city by aeroplane. The return of the government was met with general indifference by the population, which felt the government had been indifferent to the plight of the population during the occupation. Parliament met for the first time since 1940 on 19 September 1944 in which Pierlot presented a summary of the government's actions in Britain during the occupation. One of the first acts of the government was to make Prince Charles, Leopold's brother, the prince regent on 20 September. On 26 September, a new liberation government of national unity was created. Because of a shortage of candidates, Pierlot continued to head it. The new government included members of the Communist Party of Belgium (PCB-KPB) for the first time. It presided over the eventual liberation of all of Belgium, delayed by a German offensive in the Ardennes in the winter of 1944. The government was weakened by continued problems with the national food supply in the winter of 1944 which caused popular discontent. During this period, the government was involved in launching Gutt's monetary reform plan as well as the disarming of the resistance as part of the transition to stability. A major crisis emerged within the government over the refusal of the Front de l'Ind√©pendance (FI-OF) and the Partisans Arm√©s (PA), two large left-wing resistance groups, to disband and disarm. Pierlot, suspicious of the their motivations, came into confrontation with the Communists. The three Communist ministers resigned from the government, and the party began agitating against Pierlot. Amid fears of a Communist coup d'√©tat, parliament voted through emergency powers allowing the Gendarmerie to forcibly disarm the resistance though sporadic strikes continued. The government also voted through important social security reforms. Continued problems with the food supply, coupled the unpopularity of some of the government's measures, led to widespread press criticism of the Pierlot government. Strikes across the country in February 1945 further destabilised the government. On 7 February 1945, Pierlot publicly defended the actions of the government in parliament, but failed to make a significant impression. The government fell in February, and was replaced by a new, short- lived national union government under Achille Van Acker while the polemic surrounding the possible dismissal or restatement of Leopold III were considered. Later life and death Portrait of Pierlot in old age After the fall of his government, Pierlot returned to his position as senator of the arrondissements of Arlon, Marche-en-Famenne, Bastogne, Neufch√¢teau and Virton until the elections of February 1946. In September 1945, Pierlot was appointed to the honorary role of Minister of State by Charles and, shortly after the 1946 election, was awarded the title of Count. Because he was considered an anti-Leopoldist during the crisis surrounding the Royal Question, he was ostracised by the pro-Leopoldist successor to the Catholic Party, the Christian Social Party (Parti social-chr√©tien or PSC-CVP). Retiring from politics, Pierlot returned to practicing Law in Brussels. In 1946, a book entitled the Livre Blanc (White Book) was published at the request of Leopold, defending the King and attacking the exile government's record. Responding to the criticism, Pierlot published a widely distributed series of articles in the newspaper Le Soir. He remained a controversial figure. King Baudouin, replacing his father as King in 1950, also refused to receive Pierlot at the palace. After 1947, he refused to return to politics or to respond publicly to criticism from his political enemies. Pierlot died in Uccle, a wealthy suburb of Brussels, on 13 December 1963, ten days before his 80th birthday. He is buried in Cugnon. A charitable organisation, the Fondation Hubert Pierlot (Hubert Pierlot Foundation), was established by friends of Pierlot in 1966. Posthumous rehabilitation After his death, Pierlot's political reputation was reappraised by historians who reconsidered the decisions he took during his wartime government. He was notably praised by his colleague, Paul-Henri Spaak who later became first President of the United Nations General Assembly, Secretary General of NATO, and one of the founding fathers of the European Union. In his 1969 memoires, Spaak praised Pierlot as \\"serious to the point of severity, honest to the point of scrupulosity, a tireless worker, a devout Christian, a patriot, a model of civic, professional, and family virtues, he was an exceptional man.\\" References Bibliography  * External links *Hubert Pierlot at the official website of the Belgian Prime Minister *Hubert Pierlot, du devoir au sacrifice at La Libre Belgique *Hubert Pierlot, Premier ministre oubli√© at L'Avenir * * Hubert Pierlot in ODIS - Online Database for Intermediary Structures Category:1883 births Category:1963 deaths Category:People from Bertrix Category:Catholic University of Leuven (1834‚Äì1968) alumni Category:Belgian military personnel of World War I Category:Belgian lawyers Category:Catholic Party (Belgium) politicians Category:Prime Ministers of Belgium Category:Belgian Ministers of State Category:Members of the Belgian government in exile Category:World War II political leaders Category:Counts of Belgium Category:20th-century lawyers ","title":"Hubert Pierlot"},{"id":"4276674","text":"Goofspiel (also known as The Game of Pure Strategy, GOPS or Psychological Jujitsu) is a card game for two or more players. It was invented by Merrill Flood while at Princeton University in the 1930s, and Alex Randolph describes a similar game as having been popular with the 5th Indian Army during the Second World War. The game is simple to learn and play, but has some degree of strategic depth. It is commonly used as an example of multi-stage simultaneous move game in game theory and artificial intelligence. Game play Goofspiel is played using cards from a standard deck of cards, and is typically a two- player game, although more players are possible. Each suit is ranked A (low), 2, ..., 10, J, Q, K (high). One suit is singled out as the \\"prizes\\"; each of the remaining suits becomes a hand for one player, with one suit discarded if there are only two players, or taken from additional decks if there are four or more. The prizes are shuffled and placed between the players with one card turned up. Play proceeds in a series of rounds. The players make sealed bids for the top (face up) prize by selecting a card from their hand (keeping their choice secret from their opponent). Once these cards are selected, they are simultaneously revealed, and the player making the highest bid takes the competition card. Rules for ties in the bidding vary, possibilities including the competition card being discarded, or its value split between the tied players (possibly resulting in fractional scores). Some play that the current prize \\"rolls over\\" to the next round, so that two or more cards are competed for at once with a single bid card. The cards used for bidding are discarded, and play continues with a new upturned prize card. After 13 rounds, there are no remaining cards and the game ends. Typically, players earn points equal to sum of the ranks of cards won (i.e. ace is worth one point, 2 is two points, etc., jack 11, queen 12, and king 13 points). Players may agree upon other scoring schemes. Mathematical analysis Goofspiel (or variants of it) has been the subject of mathematical study. For example, Sheldon Ross considered the case when one player plays his cards randomly, to determine the best strategy that the other player should use. Using a proof by induction on the number of cards, Ross showed that the optimal strategy for the non-randomizing player is to match the upturned card, i.e. if the upturned card is the Jack, he should play his Jack, etc. In this case, the expected final score is 59¬Ω - 31¬Ω, for a 28-point win. The game as defined by Ross, where payoffs are point differences, was solved using linear and dynamic programming in 2012. Strategy Any pure strategy in this game has a simple counter-strategy where the opponent bids one rank higher, or as low as possible against the King bid. As an example, consider the strategy of matching the upturned card value mentioned in the previous section. The final score will be 78 - 13 with the King being the only lost prize. In general, making a very low bid can be advantageous if the player has correctly guessed that the opponent is making a high bid; despite losing a (presumably high-scoring) prize, the player gains an advantage in bidding power that can last for multiple turns. In the variant in which tie bids cause prizes to accumulate, the player with a bidding advantage might make bids that are more likely to tie, knowing that he can then use his uncontested high-bid card to win the accumulated group.

The nearby East Jersey Olde Towne Village is home to a permanent exhibition about the Raritan Landing. History Raritan Landing emerged as a vital port community during the 1720s. It was situated at the farthest inland point on the Raritan River that could be navigated by merchant ships of the day. In its heyday, the Landing was the center for local trade and, along with New Brunswick, served as a hub for imports and exports to and from the Raritan Valley. Agricultural goods and lumber brought to Raritan Landing from throughout central New Jersey were stored in warehouses here, awaiting shipment to either New York or sometimes the Caribbean. Imported goods were off-loaded and taken by traders to stores and merchants throughout the area. The majority of the community existed between present-day River Road and the Raritan River, near the intersection of Landing Lane and River Road. By the 1740s, there were approximately 70 structures and more than 100 inhabitants. By the early days of the American Revolution the community was occupied by British troops. The bluffs provided safe haven for the troops, and an unobstructed lookout toward New Brunswick, enabling clear views of approaching Patriot forces.

This order could not be saved under section 1 of the Charter. The case involved a 13-year-old Sikh named Gurbaj Singh, who in November 2001 dropped a metal kirpan at his school, √âcole Sainte‚ÄëCatherine‚ÄëLabour√©. This prompted the school board to request certain limits on the wearing of the kirpan, including that it be covered at all times. The Sikh family accepted this request. However, another board, in February 2002, overrode the school board, deciding that the kirpan was a weapon and thus was not allowed under the code of conduct. The council of commissioners agreed with the latter decision, although they suggested a non-metal kirpan could be used. The Quebec Court of Appeal found in favour of the council of commissioners. Decision First, the majority of the Court, whose opinion was authored by Justice Louise Charron, denied that the case should be decided under the rules of administrative law, which required simple reasonableness. The majority believed this would limit the rights under the Charter. As Charron wrote, \\"The rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Canadian Charter establish a minimum constitutional protection that must be taken into account by the legislature and by every person or body subject to the Canadian Charter.\\"Para. 16. The rule against weapons under administrative law was not the subject of this case. The real focus was how in practise the law banned the kirpan.Para. 19. The Court went on to note that the council of commissioners, which had banned the kirpan, was bound by the Charter. This was because the council was created by a statute and thus received its powers from a legislature. While the concurring justices Deschamps and Abella believed section 1 of the Charter could only be used on unconstitutional written laws, Charron wrote that section 1 can also be applied to delegated power. If the power is used according to the law, it is \\"prescribed by law\\" as required by section 1; Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Minister of Justice) (2000) was an example of a case in which delegated power was not prescribed by law.Para. 22. Since the council acted according to the law, the Court could now look at the freedom of religion issue.Para. 23. Freedom of religion A student's right to carry a kirpan is an example of religious freedom according to the Supreme Court. This raised the question of whether freedom of religion was an \\"absolute right\\" or had \\"internal limits\\" aside from the limits under section 1. Trinity Western University v. British Columbia College of Teachers (2001) was cited to suggest freedom of religion is limited by other values aside from under section 1, in this case the goals of order and security.Para. 24-25. The Supreme Court noted that since R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd. (1985), there had been recognition that freedom of religion should not be used to harm others, but section 1 was the ideal place for this consideration.Para. 26. In contrast, in the Trinity Western University case, the Court merely had to address a situation in which freedom of religion and equality rights might contradict each other. As this contradiction was prevented by the Supreme Court, section 1 was not used to harmonize the two rights.Para. 28. With these issues in mind, the Court turned to apply freedom of religion analysis to this case. The decision followed precedent in Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem (2004) that for a claim to freedom of religion to succeed, an individual should show they believe a practise is connected to a religious belief. Next, the infringement of freedom of religion should be serious. In this case, the carrying of the kirpan was deemed to be connected to religion because it was necessary according to Orthodox Sikhism. The same beliefs also dictated that the kirpan not be used to harm others.Para. 36. The claimant's belief that the kirpan must be metal was also considered sincere. While other Sikhs used non-metal kirpans, that was irrelevant to the beliefs of this individual.Para. 39. The Court then moved on to find the violation of freedom of religion was considerable. The claimant had to leave public school.Para. 40. Reasonable limits The Court then turned to consider whether the violation of freedom of religion could be upheld under section 1 of the Charter. Following R. v. Oakes (1986), the Court asked whether there was a sufficient objective for the violation. The main concern, as noted by the Quebec Court of Appeal, was school safety, which helps to maintain an atmosphere in which students can learn. The Supreme Court agreed that would qualify as an important objective under section 1. However, they then noted there were varying degrees of safety, with the highest degree of safety being excessive.Para. 45. The Court contemplated the highest degree of safety would require the banning of scissors and other such objects. Thus, safety in school is usually only supposed to be \\"reasonable.\\"Para. 46. However, because the council wanted to rid the schools of weapons, the Court deemed the council's objective to be reasonable. This raised the question as to whether the rights infringement was rational and proportionate to the objective. The banning of the kirpan was considered rational because it was a weapon, and thus the banning fit the objective of ridding the school of weapons. However, the banning of the kirpan was not proportionate to the objective. It was noted the claimant could not wear the kirpan at school at all, even though the claimant would have accepted limitations.Para. 54. The council had said that the kirpan could be stolen, or it could encourage other students to bring weapons to school.Para. 55. The Supreme Court replied the claimant himself was not violent, and the limitations accepted by the claimant made a theft unlikely. The thief would have to seize the claimant and look under the claimant's clothing.Para. 58. Additionally, there was little to no proof students have used kirpans as weapons in schools. Although cases involving airline security have resulted in the banning of kirpans on planes, the Court quoted the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal as saying whereas people know each other in a school, planes will always carry different people who never know each other. There is little opportunity to judge whether a passenger is violent.Para. 63. As for the argument that the kirpan could encourage other students to bring weapons to school, as defence against the kirpan, the Court replied this was speculative. Of relation to this concern was the worry that the school atmosphere would be negatively affected. The Court replied it was untrue that the kirpan represented violence, and that it had religious meanings instead. The Court also found this theory could be offensive to Sikhs and would thus contradict multiculturalism.Para. 71. If some students feel it is unfair that the claimant can wear a kirpan to school while they cannot carry knives, the Court suggested schools should teach these students the importance of freedom of religion.Para. 76. It was noted that in Trinity Western University v. British Columbia College of Teachers, the Court had said schools should teach values and promote civic virtue. Allowing the kirpan would thus be beneficial in that it would teach students the importance of freedom of religion.Para. 79. Concurrences Deschamps and Abella Justices Marie Deschamps and Rosalie Abella wrote a concurring opinion. While they agreed with Charron's decision to overturn the ban on the kirpan, they found that the proper way to do this was through the rules of administrative law. Constitutional law should be used primarily for statutes and regulations, and the tests used in constitutional law, such as the Oakes test, work best on these laws. Section 1 of the Charter indicates the Oakes test best applies to decisions \\"prescribed by law.\\" Meanwhile, administrative law would work when dealing with what in this case was an administrative body.Para. 85, 121. Following the Trinity Western University case and Chamberlain v. Surrey School District No. 36, Charron and Abella also felt a measure of deference was appropriate. There was also indication that the law meant for local authorities rather than courts to have a greater say in such matters.Para. 94-96. At any rate, Descamps and Abella found that \\"it is difficult to imagine a decision that would be considered reasonable or correct even though it conflicted with constitutional values.\\"Para. 109. The ideal situation would be for administrative laws to apply Charter values rather than to have their decisions challenged as violations of the Charter.Para. 123. Administrative law required reasonableness. The Quebec Court of Appeal found that kirpans could only be harmful, but Abella and Deschamps criticized this opinion for neglecting other evidence. Other objects commonly found at school can be used as weapons.Para. 97. Moreover, the Sikh student had accepted limits on the wearing of the kirpan. Thus, the decision was judged unreasonable. LeBel Another concurrence was written by Justice Louis LeBel. He noted the difficulty of using a section 1 analysis, in this case on administrative law. He wrote that the Canadian Charter and Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms do not always need to be used when administrative law provides an analytical framework. However, the Constitution of Canada inevitably has an impact in some cases. In this case freedom of religion was invoked, as well as security of person under section 7 of the Charter when it came to other students' safety. To reconcile these conflicting rights, LeBel wrote that section 1 was not the only possible answer. He pointed to Young v. Young (1993) to support this proposition. In this situation, evaluating the ban on kirpans should be done through administrative law regarding the commission's authority to protect security of person, and then this evaluation should be judged in light of the Constitution. Before moving to section 1, the rights should be defined. In this case, LeBel found no evidence anyone's security of person was at risk. Turning to the Oakes test, he disregarded the requirement for a sufficient objective for rights violations since the governing statutes were not questioned. On the issue of proportionality, he felt the commission did not effectively prove its case.

Avometer 15 Volt BLR121 battery AVOmeter is a British trademark for a line of multimeters and electrical measuring instruments; the brand is now owned by the Megger Group Limited. The first Avometer was made by the Automatic Coil Winder and Electrical Equipment Co. in 1923, and measured direct voltage, direct current and resistance.GB Patent 200977 Possibly the best known multimeter of the range was the Model 8, which was produced in various versions from May 1951 until 2008; the last version was the Mark 7. The multimeter is often called simply an AVO, because the company logo carries the first letters of 'amps', 'volts' and 'ohms'. The design concept is due to the Post Office engineer Donald Macadie, who at the time of the introduction of the original AVOmeter in 1923 was a senior officer in the Post Office Factories Department in London. Technical features The original AVOmeter was designed to measure direct current (3 ranges, 0.12, 1.2 & 12 A), direct voltage (3 ranges, 12, 120 & 600 V) and resistance (single range, 0 - 10,000 ohms, 225 ohms mid-scale). All ranges could be selected by a single rotary switch which set both the function and the range value. A second switch brought a rheostat into circuit in series with the instrument and could be used to control the current through a device under test and the meter. The movement drew 12 mA for full-scale deflection and used a \\"universal shunt\\" permanently in parallel with the movement which increased the input terminal full-scale current to 16.6 mA, corresponding to 60 ohms per volt. It had a knife edge pointer and an anti-parallax mirror. Additional patents were taken out in Czechoslovakia (1923),Czech Patent CA236252 Austria,Austrian Patent AT98613B France,French Patent FR566295 Germany,German Patent DE405863 and Switzerland Swiss Patent CH107655 (1924). A US patent US Patent US1593024 followed in 1926 The case of the original AVOmeter was a comb-jointed oak box with an ebonite lower front panel. The upper part of the front panel was cast aluminium. After around three years production, the volume of sales was sufficient to justify a redesign of the instrument, now with a movement whose full-scale current was 6 mA. The redesigned meter had 13 ranges and was constructed on a one piece phenolic moulding with the characteristic \\"kidney\\" shaped window. The back case was a deep drawn aluminium can on the back of which was a summary of the operating instructions, a feature of all future AVOmeters. The movement was originally protected by a short length of wire, selected to act as a fuse, soldered to supports on the back of the movement. Later versions had a calibrated, screw-in, fuse on the front panel. After copper oxide instrument rectifiers became available in the late 1920s, a 20-range \\"Universal\\" version of the AVOmeter was introduced in 1931 having both direct and alternating voltage current ranges.L. O. Grondahl and P. H. Geiger, A New Electronic Rectifier, A. 1. E. E. 46, 357-366 (1927).GB Patent GB404015 Unlike many similar multimeter designs, all Universal AVOmeters, with the exception of the short-lived \\"High Resistance (HR) AVOmeter\\" (c. 1948 - 1951), could measure up to either 10 A or 12 A (AC) depending on the model. From 1933, the number of available voltage and current ranges in Universal AVOmeters was doubled by incorporating a dual sensitivity movement circuit.GB Patent GB423199 The higher sensitivity was selected by a push button switch marked √∑2 (Divide by two) signifying that the pointer indication should be halved. For the Model 8, this feature was not used but the push button was retained for reversing the direction of deflection of the moving coil. A design feature of AVOmeters was simplicity of use and towards this end, all measurements could generally be made using only two input terminals. However, the AVOmeter HR had additional 2500 V (AC) and (DC) ranges which used the corresponding 1000 V ranges, and were connected through two additional terminals at the top corners of the front panel. This feature was continued in the Model 8 and, with an increase to 3000 V to match their 1 - 3 - 10 ranges sequence, in the Model 9, Marks II and IV and the Model 8 Mark V. The 3000 V ranges were deleted in the Model 8 Marks 6 and 7 due to concerns for compliance with contemporary safety standards. This also led to a significant cost saving by eliminating the high voltage multiplier resistors. As an ohmmeter the Model 8 Mark II measures from 1 Œ© up to 20 MŒ© in three ranges. The instrument has an accuracy of ¬±1% of FSD on DC current ranges, ¬±2% of FSD on DC voltage ranges, ¬±2.25% of FSD on all AC ranges and ¬±5% of reading (at centre scale only) on resistance ranges. AVO Model 8 Service Manual. Its maximum current draw of 50 ŒºA at full-scale deflection (corresponding to 20,000 ohms per volt) is sufficient in most cases to reduce voltage measurement error due to circuit loading by the meter to an acceptable level. The AVOmeter design incorporates an electrical interlock which prevents AC & DC ranges being selected simultaneously.GB Patent GB404015 Claim 6 For example, none of the DC ranges, current or voltage, can be connected unless the AC switch is set to its \\"DC\\" position. On a Model 8, this is the position with the AC switch arrow vertical. Similarly, to use the AC ranges, the DC switch must be set to its \\"AC\\" position. With the DC switch set to its \\"AC\\" position and the AC switch set to \\"DC\\", no current can flow through the instrument. However whenever any moving coil instrument is likely to be subjected to heavy shock in transit, it is good practice to damp the movement by short circuiting the moving coil using a heavy gauge wire connected across the terminals. On earlier Avometers, this may be done by short-circuiting the input terminals and selecting the most sensitive direct current range. The Model 8 Mark V, 6 & 7 were provided with an \\"OFF\\" position on the DC switch which both disconnected the meter's terminals and short-circuited the moving coil. AVOmeters designed from 1936 onwards were fitted with an overload cut- out operated by the moving coil frame hitting either forward or reverse sprung end stops.GB Patent GB464867 The Model 7 was the first type to use the end stop cut-out and it also featured an acceleration trip which, in the event of heavy overloads, could open the cut-out before the pointer had reached two- thirds of full scale. The acceleration cut-out was not however used in the Model 8. From the Mark III version, the Model 8 had further protection by a fuse on its resistance ranges and fuse protection was provided on all ranges of the Model 8 Marks 6 & 7\\\\. AVO multimeters were almost ubiquitous in British manufacturing and service industry, research and development and higher and further education. They were also widely used by utilities, government agencies and the British armed forces. A number of special versions were produced to British Admiralty and Air Ministry specifications and for other customers. The Model 8 Marks V, 6 & 7 were designed to meet a NATO specification and were standard issue to NATO services. Many commercial and military service manuals specified that values for measurements of current or voltage had been made with a Model 7 or Model 8 AVOmeter. Advertisements of the late 1930s compared the utility of the AVOmeter to the slide rule. Even nowadays it can still be found in regular use. The earlier versions of models 7, 8 and 9 had a design flaw which resulted in many instruments sustaining damage to the movement in transit. Users would habitually 'switch off' the instrument by setting the AC switch to 'DC' and the DC switch to 'AC'. With the switches at these settings, the movement is completely undamped.Model 7, 8 and 9 schematic diagrams. The operating manuals for the affected instruments did contain a note that they should not be switched to 'AC' and 'DC' (or the blank position either side of the 'AC' and 'DC') though failed to explain why.AVOmeter user manual for AVO 8 Mk 2. The problem was solved on later instruments by providing the DC switch with an 'OFF' position (see illustration above). Present times Despite continuing demand from customers, production was stopped in 2008, reportedly due to increasing problems with suppliers of mechanical parts. The last meter to leave the factory was an AVOmeter Eight Mk 7 (Serial Number 6110-610/081208/5166) which was presented in February 2010 to the winner of a competition run by the Megger company.

Background Yahyah Michot was the president of the Higher Council of Muslims in Belgium from 1995 to 1998. Yahyah Michot teaches at the Hartford Seminary, Connecticut as a professor of Islamic Studies and Christian-Muslim Relations. He is also the current editor of the journal \\"The Muslim World\\" edited by the Seminary. He is also a guest speaker for the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies. Controversy In 1997, under the pseudonym of Nasreddin Lebatelier, he published Le Statut des Moines from Lebanon. This pamphlet included a translation of a short work by the famed 13th-14th century Muslim scholar Ibn Taymiyya, called On the Statute of Monks, which is read by some as a call for the killing of Christian monks if they are found outside their monasteries in a Muslim country. Lebatelier's introduction referred to the Algerian Armed Islamic Group's (GIA) killing of seven Trappist monks in Tibhirine in 1996. He analysed not only the GIA's justification for the killings but also the Muslim community's consensus (ijm√¢') which condemned these assassinations, and explained the religious authoritativeness of such a consensus. He was nevertheless accused of having condoned the killing of the seven Trappists by Catholic authorities and media, notably by Marcel Crochet, the Rector of the Catholic University of Louvain where he was employed (June 26, 1997). Michot negotiated his departure from the University of Louvain, which paid him a financial indemnity, including 50% of his lawyer's fees. Once appointed as the first Muslim lecturer of Islamic theology in Oxford, Michot faced renewed Catholic hostility, notably in various articles by Margaret Hebblethwaite in The Tablet (22 and 29 August 1998; 12 September 1998) and in an interview of the same activist on BBC 4, Sunday program (27 September 1998). Oxford nevertheless confirmed his appointment (Oxford University Gazette, 23 September 1999). In England, Michot issued a statement which made clear that he had \\"never developed any kind of apology for murder\\" in his writings or statements. He \\"completely endorsed the condemnation of the GIA by the consensus of the Muslim community\\" and had always considered that \\"these killings were a particularly tragic event in Islamo‚àíChristian relations\\".British Muslims Monthly Survey for September 1998 Vol. VI, No. 9 However, in 2010, Michot, agreed with that the misprint of the Mardin fatwa resulted him that resulted him writing an erroneous analysis in Le Statut des Moines,and distanced himself from condoning any killings by jihadist groups. A Jesuit specialist of Ibn Taymiyya wrote to Michot in January 1999, \\"Your book is certainly not advocating murder, as I had been led to believe before I read it. I see your point, the case of the killing of the monks does present legal questions which are important for Muslims to address.\\" Works *IBN S√éN√Ç. Lettre au vizir Ab√ª Sa'd\\", 2000; *\\"AVICENNE.

Plot Genoshan magistrates, backed by the cyborg Cameron Hodge, and including an amnesiac Havok (a member of the X-Men), attack the X-Mansion and kidnap Storm and the New Mutants Warlock, Boom Boom, Rictor, and Wolfsbane. After expending his energy on freeing the others from their cell, Warlock is taken to have his power transferred to Hodge. Wolfsbane returns to rescue him, but instead unintentionally causes the transfer to go awry, killing Warlock. Wolfsbane is brainwashed, turned into one of Genosha's mindless mutate slaves, which form the backbone of the Genoshan economy and lifestyle. The remaining New Mutants and the X-Men recruit X-Factor and head to Genosha to save their teammates, only to be ambushed by Havok and the Genoshan magistrates. As Cyclops unsuccessfully attempts to jog Havok's memory, the Genoshans meet a humiliating defeat. Wolverine, Psylocke, and Jubilee rescue Rictor and Boom-Boom from Genoshan magistrates. After entrusting Rictor and Boom Boom to the care of Jubilee, Psylocke and Wolverine put on the magistrates' uniforms to enter Hammer Bay. Havok, seeing someone else is wearing his lover's uniform, attacks his former teammates. Psylocke incapacitates Havok, but Hodge takes her and Wolverine prisoner. Meanwhile, Storm attempts to kill Genoshan engineer David Moreau, but is captured by Hodge and turned into a mutate slave. Jean, Cable, Gambit, Sunspot, and Forge place bombs throughout the outer levels of the capitol building, the Citadel, but are captured after the magistrate Wipeout blocks their powers. The remaining heroes set a trap at their hideout and attack the Citadel, but are defeated. Wanting payback for his earlier humiliation, Havok confronts Cyclops personally. This time Cyclops succeeds in making Havok remember who he is. However, deciding his only chance of helping is as an inside man, Havok tranquilizes Cyclops and turns him over to Hodge. The X-Men, X-Factor, and New Mutants are put on trial, but when Wolverine attempts to kill the judge, he turns them over to Hodge to do with as he will. Pretending to be traumatized by Hodge's brutalities, Psylocke submits herself to the mutate process. She then escapes while being taken to Moreau. Once the others are left alone, Gambit uses a dart Hodge fired into his leg to pick their locks. Thinking the mutants are all safely captured, Hodge initiates his plan to betray Genosha, killing a number of magistrates, including Wipeout. The Chief Magistrate turns to the mutant teams for help against Hodge, using Storm's electrical power to restore their powers. The process inexplicably also undoes Storm's brainwashing and restores her to adulthood. Jubilee, Rictor, and Boom-Boom stumble upon Moreau, who is taking his own steps to counter Hodge's treachery. He takes them to the Citadel. There, they are reunited with their teammates. Moreau directs Wolfsbane to change into wolf form; only by remaining in this form can she be free of her brainwashing. Moreau shoots Hodge point blank with a prototype weapon, but Hodge kills him before he can finish him off. The mutant teams hunt Hodge throughout the Citadel, with Cyclops and Havok finally destroying his body. Hodge's severed head still lives on due to the immortality bestowed on him by N'Astirh, so Rictor brings down the Citadel, burying him alive. Days later, Havok and Wolfsbane decide to stay in Genosha to help settle tensions between humans and mutants in the country. The mutant heroes return home and hold a funeral for Warlock. Per Wolfsbane's wishes, they spread his ashes over the grave of their teammate Cypher. Impact Published during the comic book speculator boom, the involvement of Jim Lee and Rob Liefeld caused the issues of the crossover to sell for $10‚Äì20 on the secondary market when the books were first published, though the issues have since gone down in value. The storyline also had several lasting effects on the various titles. *The loss of longtime New Mutants members Wolfsbane, Rictor and Warlock would begin the book's transition to X-Force. *The various X-Men in the story (Storm, Wolverine, Banshee, Forge, Psylocke, Jubilee, Gambit) would form the first official X-Men roster since the Australia-based team disbanded. *The mutate process would psychically bind Wolfsbane to Havok - a plot thread that would be picked up after both joined X-Factor.

In the parts of Bogdanove he's long haired, has a moustache and lacks the glasses. * In the parts drawn by Liefeld and Lee Wolverine is wearing his orange and brown suit, in the parts drawn by Bogdanove he's \\"Patch\\" wearing a plaid jacket and jeans. * When a tearful Wolfsbane gives Warlock's ashes to Boom-Boom in the scene drawn by Liefeld, she's wearing her Genosha slave outfit and has a humanoid appearance, in the Bogdanove drawn reprise of that scene she's drawn completely wolf-like wearing torn rags. Secret Wars (2015) The Secret Wars storyline features a new \\"X-Tinction Agenda\\" miniseries that is part of the event. Ten years since the Summers brothers took out Cameron Hodge and end his fascist regime in Genosha, Havok and Wolfsbane have toiled and labored to rebuild the island into the proud mutant homeland it once was. But a decade removed from Hodge and his iron rule, their work may all be for naught. A plague has spread across the nation, infecting mutants and threatening the domain known as X-Topia. Faced with an extinction problem, Baroness Rachel Grey had no other solution than to quarantine the island from the rest of the domain, leaving Havok in charge. With the country quarantined and seemingly abandoned by their God and the rest of their fellows X-Men, Havok and Wolfsbane will stop at nothing to save those who are currently trapped on Genosha.X-Tinction Agenda #1 While walking around X-City, Rachel Grey is discussing with Beast about the experiment he is currently developing, more precisely where Beast had time- transplanted some X-Men. In this case, Banshee, Thunderbird and Wolverine just to prove the concept that its possible to bring the dead back to live by taking them from the time before they died. Just then, they are attacked by Havok and his Press Gang in an attempt to capture the mutant healer Triage, the last ray of hope for the mutants of Genosha. The battle is fast and fierce, pitting mutant against mutant, and showing that Havok is taking no chances in reaching his end goal. When Triage is found, Havok pulls the team back to Genosha taking former friends as prisoners along the way. Tests are set up to ensure that Triage's powers will work against the virus. Seeing this as an act of treachery, Rachel Grey prepared to wage war on Genosha.X-Tinction Agenda #2 Baroness Grey gathered a small group of mutants to invade Genosha in order to save the kidnapped X-Men and punish Havok and his allies for their attack. Unbeknownst to them, Dr. Aldus Kluge (known as the Genegineer) didn't want Triage's power to stop the virus, but to resurrect Cameron Hodge so he could continue his mission to eradicate mutantkind. Upon Hodge's resurrection, Kluge revealed to him that he was the one responsible for creating and spreading the Extinction Virus and that his ultimate goal was to resurrect Hodge and merge him with an Adamantium Exoskeleton and the Transmode Virus (which he acquired from the remains of Warlock) so he could purge Genosha from its mutant population. As Triage and Rogue were curing the mutant population of Genosha from the virus, Baroness Rachel Grey launched an attack on the island nation. During the battle, Wolfsbane was launched in the air by Storm and Bulletproof was forced to flee from his battle against Thunderbird to save her, ending up crashing into Kluge's lab and discovering what he had done and what he was up to. Afterwards, Bulletproof was attacked by Ink and accidentally merged with part of the Transmode Virus, then proceeding to kill Kluge for his betrayal. With Kluge dead, the X-Men had a new problem at hand....a fully resurrected Cameron Hodge merged with what remained of the Transmode Virus.X-Tinction Agenda #3 With the threat of Hodge growing as he learned how to use his newfound powers, both the X-Men of Genosha and X-City called a truce and allied themselves to fight him. However, Hodge was too powerful to be defeated by their combined effort. Wolfsbane then devised a plan to stop him and used Mystique as a distraction to buy her enough time to get to their airplane along with Havok and Bombshell. With their powers combined, Havok and Bombshell exploded Genosha as Wolfsbane crashlanded into Hodge, leaving no trace of them behind. Having survived the explosion along with the X-Men of Genosha and X-City which she protected using her powers, Baroness Grey vowed to rebuild Genosha in honor to the mutants who died defending it and to unite it with X-City, as it was meant to be from the beginning. Meanwhile, what little remained of Warlock rose from the island's ruins and brought Warlock back to life.X-Tinction Agenda #4 Publication #Uncanny X-Men #270 (November 1990) #New Mutants #95 (November 1990) #X-Factor #60 (November 1990) #Uncanny X-Men #271 (December 1990) #New Mutants #96 (December 1990) #X-Factor #61 (December 1990) #Uncanny X-Men #272 (January 1991) #New Mutants #97 (January 1991) #X-Factor #62 (January 1991) Collected editions The storyline has been collected into a trade paperback: *X-Men: X-Tinction Agenda (224 pages, September 17, 2001, ) Collects Uncanny X-Men #270-272; New Mutants (1983) #95-97; X-Factor (1986) #60-62 It has also been collected into a hardcover: *X-Men: X-Tinction Agenda (304 pages, August 10, 2011, ) Collects Uncanny X-Men #235-238, #270-272; New Mutants (1983) #95-97; X-Factor (1986) #60-62 References Category:Comics by Chris Claremont Category:Comics by Jim Lee Category:Comics by Louise Simonson ","title":"X-Tinction Agenda"},{"id":"4276836","text":"__NOTOC__ Photochrom of the Cirque de Gavarnie, circa 1900 Snow on the walls of the Cirque de Gavarnie The Cirque de Gavarnie is a cirque in the central Pyrenees, in Southwestern France, close to the border of Spain. It is within the commune of Gavarnie, the department of Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es, and the Pyr√©n√©es National Park. Major features of the cirque are La Br√®che de Roland (English: Roland's Pass) and the Gavarnie Falls. It was described by Victor Hugo as \\"the Colosseum of nature\\" due to its enormous size and horseshoe shape resembling an ancient amphitheatre. The cirque is 800 m wide (on the deepest point) and about 3,000 m wide at the top. The rock walls that surround it are up to above the floor of the Cirque. During the warmer seasons of spring, summer and fall, there are a number of large meltwater falls that spill into the cirque. The largest of these is Gavarnie Falls, the second-highest waterfall in Europe. It descends some over a series of steps before reaching the floor of the cirque. There are also several passes and clefts between the peaks that form the rim of the Cirque. The largest is La Br√®che de Roland, at above sea level. According to legend, its sheer walls were cut into the mountain by the sword of the hero Roland, nephew to Charlemagne. The cirque, and many others like it in the Pyrenees, was formed by the process of glacial erosion. The Cirque de Gavarnie's uniquely immense size was likely caused by repeated cycles of glacial scraping over millions of years. A number of rare plants and animals live on the peaks at the upper rim of the Cirque de Gavarnie, protected on both the French and the Spanish sides by national parks. Martagon lilies grow in the pine forests. Saxifraga and other tiny alpine flowers cling to the rock faces. Chamois, a type of mammal similar to goats or antelope, live among the crags.

The group is consider to be a very important band that helped define powerviolence with a style that incorporated political lyrics, blast beats, and quick tempos. They have been named as the \\"dark lords of powerviolence\\" by Beau Beasley of Insect Warfare. History Crossed Out played sixteen shows and released a demo, 7\\", split 7\\" with Man Is the Bastard, split 5\\" with Dropdead, and two songs for the Son of Blleeaauurrggh compilation. Many bands, such as The Locust, Dropdead, Su19b, Slices, and Iron Lung, have covered songs originally performed by Crossed Out. In 1991, Spazz bassist and vocalist Chris Dodge, who also ran Slap-a-Ham Records, asked the band to send him a demo. Five months after that recording, in the fall of 1991, their seven song self-titled 7\\" was released, including a firing squad cover photo. In 1992, the band recorded a live radio show on KSPC, a split 5\\" with Dropdead, a contribution to Slap-a-ham's Son of Blleeaauurrggh compilation 7\\", and a split 7\\" with Man is the Bastard. By 1993, Crossed Out, along with Man is the Bastard, No Comment and Capitalist Casualties, played 924 Gilman Street's first power violence-only show, the Fiesta Grande. After the departure of original bassist Rich Hart, Eric Wood - bassist and vocalist of Man is the Bastard - volunteered to play bass; he remained with the group until their break up. The summer that followed, Dropdead toured the U.S with the release of their split 5\\", playing two shows with Crossed Out. An August 1993 show with Spazz, Anal Cunt, and Dropdead, titled \\"Grindcore Night\\", on a flyer at Gilman St., led to the vocalist's comment \\"Fuck grindcore\\". \\"Fuck Grindcore\\" later became a bootleg 10\\" of their self-titled record.

He was the head coach at Brigham Young University (BYU) from 1964 to 1971, and the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) from 1972 through 1973, compiling an overall college football record of 40‚Äì56‚Äì1. Hudspeth served in the same capacity for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL) from 1976 until 1977, and Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL) in 1981, posting a mark of 13‚Äì17. Career Early positions Hudspeth graduated from the University of Tulsa in 1953 after completing his playing career at the school. He moved into the coaching ranks that fall as an assistant coach at Norman High School in Oklahoma, then served the next two years in the military. Upon his release, he accepted an assistant position at Tulsa Central High School in 1956. Returning to his alma mater the following year, Hudspeth served as an assistant for the next four years, then moved up north to the Canadian Football League (CFL), working in a similar capacity with the Calgary Stampeders from 1961 to 1963. BYU In 1964, Hudspeth became a head coach for the first time, taking over the Brigham Young Cougars struggling football program. Husdspeth recruited a number of ex-Marines to play for the Cougars in his first couple of seasons and BYU saw a dramatic rise in its football fortunes. In his second season 1965 BYU won its first Western Athletic Conference (WAC) championship and posted a 6‚Äì4 record. Hudspeth led the Cougars to an 8‚Äì2 mark in 1966 and had two more winning seasons in 1967 and 1969. Over an eight-year span, he compiled a record of 39‚Äì42‚Äì1. Hudspeth is credited with recruiting the program's first black player, Ronnie Knight, in 1970, following pressure from the LDS leadership and the \\"Black 14\\" Incident with Wyoming the previous year. On January 22, 1972, Hudspeth resigned and was replaced by one of his assistant coaches, Lavell Edwards. Edwards built BYU into a national power by the end of the decade and later led the school to its first and only football national championship in 1984. \\"I can't take any credit for what LaVell did at BYU\\", Hudspeth said. \\"LaVell was a brilliant coach. When we worked together back in the 1960s, LaVell already had a great understanding of what to do on offense. I recommended him when I left to take the job at UTEP, but everyone knew what a smart young coach he was.\\" UTEP Hudspeth accepted a job as offensive coordinator at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) shortly after leaving BYU. He became interim head coach on October 22, 1972 when head coach Bobby Dobbs resigned following a 56‚Äì7 loss. Hudspeth closed out the year 1‚Äì3, but followed up with a disastrous 0‚Äì11 record the next year. He was subsequently fired from UTEP. Pro ranks The advent of the new World Football League (WFL) in 1974 provided a new job opportunity for Hudspeth. He was hired as an offensive backs coach for the Chicago Fire. A major reason he was hired was because he had coached Chicago's quarterback Virgil Carter, at BYU. However, during the course of the season, the team's weak defense, coupled with severe financial troubles, eventually saw Hudspeth also take over the defensive backfield coaching duties. Escaping from the ill-fated league, Hudspeth took an off-the-field job the next year as the coordinator of personnel and scouting for the Detroit Lions. He remained in that position until October 5, 1976, when Lions' head coach Rick Forzano resigned following a 1‚Äì3 start and Hudspeth was tabbed to replace him. The new coach had mixed results during the remainder of the 1976 NFL season, with team owner William Clay Ford actively pursuing Los Angeles Rams head coach Chuck Knox to replace Hudspeth. After Knox elected to stay with the Rams, Hudspeth was re-hired on February 9, 1977, signing a three-year contract. Only 11 months later, Hudspeth was dismissed, ending his Lions' tenure with an 11‚Äì13 mark. On March 7, 1979, Hudspeth returned to Canada when he signed a three-year contract to become the general manager of the CFL's Toronto Argonauts. He would return as a head coach on September 14, 1981, when he replaced Willie Wood with the reeling Argonauts sporting an 0‚Äì10 record. Once again, he closed out the season, then returned to the front office. Return to Tulsa In 2006, Hudspeth was hired by University of Tulsa director of athletics Bubba Cunningham as an assistant in the area of development and fundraising for athletics.TU Alumnus Tommy Hudspeth Returns to Hurricane, TulsaHurricane.com article, Jan. 16, 2006, accessed March 30, 2012.

From left: Ludwig Wolff from ≈Å√≥d≈∫, from Katowice, Josef Wagner, Mayor from Bielsko-Bia≈Ça, SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Werner Lorenz, Senator from Ciechocinek, Baron from Wielkopolska, Weiss from Jarocin. Josef Wagner (12 January 1899 - 22 April or 2 May 1945) was from 1931 the Nazi Gauleiter of the Gau of Westphalia-South, and as of December 1934 also of the Gau of Silesia. In 1942 he was expelled from the Nazi Party (NSDAP), imprisoned by the Gestapo, and likely executed around the time of end of the war in Europe. Early life and First World War Josef Wagner was born in Algrange, Alsace-Lorraine, to miner Nikolaus Wagner. Beginning in the summer of 1913 he went to the teachers' seminary in Wittlich, and as of June 1917 he was a soldier at the Western Front during the First World War. There he ended up as a prisoner of war of the French, but managed to escape in 1918. In 1919 he returned to Germany by way of Switzerland. He ended his training as a Volksschule teacher and first worked as a finance official in Fulda, and by 1921 at the Bochumer Verein. Joining the Nazis Wagner joined the Nazi Party quite early on, in 1922, and founded the NSDAP local (Ortsgruppe) in Bochum. In 1927, he was a Volksschule teacher at the Volksschule Horst-Emscher ‚Äì and by 1928 at the Gelsenkirchen branch ‚Äì from which he was fired for political reasons. On 20 May 1928 he was elected as one of the first 12 Nazi deputies to the Reichstag in Berlin. He would continue to be elected to the Reichstag in every subsequent election in the Weimar and Nazi regimes. On 1 October 1928, when the Gau Ruhr was split up, he was appointed Gauleiter of the newly formed Gau of Westphalia, and after this Gau was split in two on 1 January 1931, he was given the office of Gauleiter of Gau Westphalia-South, whose seat was in Bochum. Career ‚Äì 1933 to 1941 After the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933, Wagner was appointed to the Prussian State Council on 1 September. Then on 6 December 1934, after the removal of Helmuth Br√ºckner, Wagner was also appointed as Gauleiter of Gau Silesia with its capital at Breslau (today Wroc≈Çaw, Poland). Retaining his Gauleiter position in Westphalia-South, he was one of only a very few Gauleiters to simultaneously head two Gaue. In addition, he also succeeded Bruckner as Oberpr√§sident (High President) of the Prussian provinces of Lower Silesia and Upper Silesia. He thus united under his control the highest party and governmental offices in the two provinces. After the two provinces were united into the Province of Silesia on 1 April 1938, Wagner became its Oberpr√§sident until the province was split again on 27 January 1941. On 29 October 1936, Wagner was appointed Reichskommissar for Pricing, a high position in Hermann G√∂ring's Four Year Plan. From the outbreak of the Second World War on 1 September 1939 he was also Reich Defence Commissioner for Silesia (Defence District VIII).Karl H√∂ffkes: Hitlers Politische Generale. Die Gauleiter des Dritten Reiches, ein biographisches Nachschlagewerk. Grabert-Verlag, T√ºbingen, 1986, p. 368 . Dismissal and death Wagner, now at the peak of his career, had made powerful enemies, including Heinrich Himmler and Martin Bormann. In addition, his Deputy Gauleiter in Silesia, Fritz Bracht, was intriguing against him.Dietrich Orlow: The History of the Nazi Party: 1933-1945 (University of Pittsburgh Press), 1973, Pages 270, . On 9 January 1941, Wagner was removed as Gauleiter of Gau Silesia and it was divided into two separate Gaue on 27 January. Bracht succeeded him in Gau Upper Silesia and Karl Hanke in Gau Lower Silesia. Wagner was also removed as Oberpr√§sident, with Bracht and Hanke succeeding him in this capacity in the two new provinces of Upper and Lower Silesia. Subsequently, on 9 November 1941, Wagner was also dismissed as Gauleiter of Gau Westphalia-South directly by Adolf Hitler.Peter H√ºttenberger: Die Gauleiter. Berlin 1969. p. 143 This outcome was due to a letter Wagner's wife had sent to their daughter, which had come to official attention. The Wagners were Catholics, and she disapproved of, and forbade, her daughter's planned marriage to a non-Catholic SS man on religious grounds. Wagner's successor as Gauleiter in Westphalia-South was Paul Giesler. Wagner was brought up on charges before the Party's High Court, and expelled from the Party on 12 October 1942.Detlef M√ºhlberger, Hitler's Voice: Organisation & development of the Nazi Party, Peter Lang, 2004, p. 224. Wagner moved back to Bochum and lived there. Later when suspected of involvement in the attempt on Hitler's life at the Wolf's Lair on 20 July 1944, he was arrested by the Gestapo after its failure. His name had appeared in a document prepared by the conspirators. It referred to \\"upright and capable\\" individuals who should be approached to be \\"convinced of the necessity of such a step and to support it. e.g. Gauleiter Wagner.\\"Peter Hoffmann, Behind Valkyrie: German Resistance to Hitler, Documents, McGill-Queen's Press, 2011, p. 326. The circumstances of his death in late April 1945 are unclear. Most likely, he was put to death by the Gestapo in Berlin though he may have died from an accidental discharge of a Red Army firearm.Antony Beevor, Berlin: The Downfall 1945 - Viking 2002 - P387 Selected works * Leitfaden der Hochschule f√ºr Politik der NSDAP, Munich 1933, published by the Hochschule f√ºr Politik der NSDAP (editor) * Die Reichsindexziffer der Lebenshaltungskosten.

According to Diego Barros Arana it is likely that Ignatius of Loyola was his uncle. Early life As a young man in 1568, he arrived in Peru at the side of the new viceroy Francisco de Toledo, Count of Oropesa, as captain of the guard. In 1572, during the military expedition against T√∫pac Amaru- the last descendant of the Incas resisting foreign domination - O√±ez de Loyola lead a brilliant action of an advance column which fell upon the camp of the Inca and captured him. For this great feat, he gained the rank of corregidor in a number of Peruvian towns, entitling him to their goods and labor. He was also rewarded with a wife, Beatriz Clara Coya, daughter of Inca ruler Sayri T√∫pac and niece of T√∫pac Amaru. With these recommendations, the king named him governor of the R√≠o de la Plata and Paraguay in 1592. However, just before he assumed the position, Philip II designated him Royal Governor of Chile, as he was considered the officer most apt to finish the Arauco War. Governor of Chile Qui√±√≥nez, √ì√±ez de Loyola and Viscarra √ì√±ez de Loyola arrived in Chile on September 23, 1592. He was determined to pacify the Arauco. To further this end he immediately set out for Concepci√≥n at the head of 110 troops which he had met at the capital. However, he realized that with such scarce resources he would not be able to achieve his objective and he requested reinforcements from Peru. However, the appearance of the British pirate Richard Hawkins alarmed the authorities in Peru and their reinforcements were recalled for the defense of Peru itself. Hawkins also attacked Chile during his campaigns, assaulting Valparaiso, for example where he captured a ship. Because of the limited capacity of his ship, he only took things he needed and let the captured sailors go free. The governor did not receive the requested soldiers, but members of the Jesuit and Augustinian orders did arrive. The first would have great importance for later events in the colonization of Chile, until they were eventually expelled. The governor decided that he could not wait any longer and in 1594 he began a campaign to the south with the small contingent that he had assembled. He founded a fort at Santa Cruz de √ì√±ez in May 1594, near the confluence of the Bio-Bio and Laja Rivers in Catiray, where gold mines were located on the Rele River. The fort was elevated to the rank of city in 1595 giving it the name of Santa Cruz de Coya. Three years later a group of 140 reinforcements arrived, but they were not enough. The lack of reinforcements was not the fault of the viceroy ‚Äî who offered generous inducements to join the army ‚Äî but rather the name of Chile, which had become so stained by the interminable conflict that no one wanted to risk their lives going to such a hell. Death The governor was in La Imperial when news arrived that the Mapuches had renewed their attacks against Angol. In order to reinforce this point, he set out with 50 men on December 21, 1598. On the second day of the march they arrived at a place called Curallaba or Curalava (the broken rock), on the banks of the Lumaco River, where they rested without taking any precautions against attack. On the nights of the 23rd and 24th the natives approached the camp, and with shouts and the sounds of horns they attacked the Spanish. O√±ez de Loyola and a pair of soldiers at his side fought very valiantly, but finally succumbed to the spears of the natives. In the melee almost all the Spaniards died, save a cleric named Bartolom√© P√©rez, who was taken prisoner, and a soldier named Bernardo de Pereda, who received 23 wounds on his body and was left for dead but improbably survived.

The Court held that a social host does not owe a duty of care to a person injured by a guest who has consumed alcohol. Background Julie Zimmerman and Dwight Courrier hosted a New Year's pot- luck dinner to which guests were to bring their own alcohol. Desmond Desormeaux, a guest at the party and long-time heavy drinker, drank approximately 12 beers in over 2 and a half hours that evening. According to the version of events accepted by both sides, the hosts did not monitor his drinking more closely than the drinking of the other guests. Desormeaux drove home after a brief conversation with Courrier, who asked him, \\"Bro, are you going to be all right?\\". On the way home, he was involved in a car crash, paralyzing the passenger Zo√´ Childs and killing another passenger, Derek Dupre. Finding liability in this case would mean recognizing a new duty of care. To determine whether or not such a duty existed, all three levels of court used the standard test in Canadian law: the Anns two-stage test. This test was introduced in the United Kingdom in the case of Anns v. Merton London Borough Council [1977] 2 All ER 492; it was adopted in Canada in City of Kamloops v. Nielsen (1984), 10 DLR (4th) 641. The two-stage test was also adopted by other common law jurisdictions, but has since been repudiated in the United Kingdom and every major common law jurisdiction except Canada. In Canada, the test has undergone several developments since Kamloops, most notably in Cooper v. Hobart, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 537. The trial judge at the Ontario Superior Court of Justice found that the injury to Childs was reasonably foreseeable, that is, a reasonable person in the position of Mr. Courrier and Ms. Zimmerman would have foreseen that Mr. Desormeaux might cause an accident and injure someone else‚Äîbut refused to impose a duty of care based on public policy grounds (2002), 217 D.L.R. (4th) 217). Like the trial court, the Court of Appeal for Ontario held that Zimmerman and Courrier did not owe a duty of care to Childs, but for different reasons: the relationship between the hosts and the guest was not proximate enough to ground a duty of care. This was because, among other things, the hosts did not serve alcohol to Desormeaux and did not know he was intoxicated, they did not assume control over the service of alcohol, there was no statute imposing a duty to monitor drinking on social hosts, and the hosts did not otherwise assume responsibility for Desormeaux's safety. Supreme Court Decision The Supreme Court held that a duty of care did not exist between the social hosts (Courrier and Zimmerman) and the third-party users of the road (Childs) injured by Desormeaux. Like the Ontario Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court found that the proximity between the plaintiffs and defendants was not sufficient to ground a duty of care. Unlike the Ontario court, however, the Supreme Court did not even discuss the second stage of the Anns/Kamloops Test, writing simply that since sufficient proximity was not present in the relationship between the parties, it was not necessary to discuss the second stage. Development of the two-stage Anns/Kamloops test Looking at the three decisions in sequence, a pattern emerges. First, the trial judge found sufficient proximity under the first stage of the Anns/Kamloops test but declined to impose liability because of policy concerns under the second stage. Second, the Ontario Court of Appeal found insufficient proximity, disagreeing with the trial judge, but still went on to an extensive discussion of the second stage's broader policy concerns. Finally, the Supreme Court did all its analysis under the first stage, concentrating on the relationship between the defendant social hosts and Desormeaux. There are two possible readings of this progression. First, they could each represent different accounts of the facts under a fundamentally similar version of the Anns/Kamloops test. Second, they could represent different versions of the Anns/Kamloops test, with each court successively reducing the role of the second stage. Under this interpretation, one could see Canadian Courts as moving towards a rejection of the two stage test that would bring Canada into line with other common law jurisdictions that have also rejected the test. One could see the Supreme Court as paying lip service to the second stage test which continues to exist merely as a vestigial limb. This interpretation would build on the Court's decision in Cooper v. Hobart, where the Court held that most duty-of-care cases would be decided under the first stage of the Anns/Kamloops test. However, the second stage was only not engaged in this case because no duty of care was found by analysis at the first stage, making proceeding with the second stage irrelevant (as the Court noted). Moreover, in Cooper v. Hobart the Court reaffirmed the importance of the 2-stage test at length. See also * List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (McLachlin Court) * Menow v.

Early life Barnes was born at Hamilton, South Australia, the son of John Thomas Barnes, a drover who had emigrated from Somerset, England, and his wife, Mary, n√©e Comerford, from County Clare, Ireland. Barnes was educated at a local primary school but left to obtain work as a farm labourer, shearer, miner and general bush worker; his father had died when the boy was six. In his swag he carried copies of works by Henry George, Robert Blatchford, Henry Lawson and other writers on economic and social questions and he thus became largely self- educated. Career Barnes was an early member of the Shearers' Union, (later named the Australian Workers' Union), became General Secretary in 1908 and afterwards President. He was Secretary of the Victoria-Riverina branch for a period, and held that position when he was elected a federal Senator for Victoria in 1913. He was defeated at the 1919 general election but was again elected in 1922 and in 1928. He was Assistant Minister for Works and Railways from 22 October 1929 to 3 March 1931 and then Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate until 6 January 1932. He was then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate until 30 June 1935. Though he held his seat until this date, he had been defeated at the general election held in 1934. He was re-elected to the Senate in 1937, his term due to begin on 1 July 1938. Late life and legacy Barnes, however was suffering from cancer and died in East Melbourne on 31 January 1938 as a Senator-elect. He left a widow, one son and five daughters. He was given a state funeral, the procession travelling through the city, pausing at Trades Hall, and continuing to the Melbourne General Cemetery. Barnes, at the time, was the most notorious practical joker in Australian federal politics. His sense of humour went along with earnestness and a belief in the cause of Labour. He was well regarded amongst colleagues and in union circles, where he was for many years a leader before entering politics.

Some theosophists like Helena Blavatsky, Helena Roerich and Henry Steel Olcott also became Buddhists. Henry Steel Olcott helped shape the design of the Buddhist flag. Tibetan Buddhism was popularised in the West at first mainly by Theosophists including Evans- Wentz and Alexandra David-Neel. Blavatsky sometimes compared Theosophy to Mahayana Buddhism. In The Key to Theosophy she writes:  The Theosophists as Buddhists and Buddhologists   The Founders of the Theosophical Society  25 May 1880 Blavatsky and Olcott embraced Buddhism: they publicly took in Galle the Refuges and Pancasila from a prominent Sinhalese bhikkhu. Olcott and Blavatsky (she received US citizenship previously) were the first Americans who were converted to Buddhism in the traditional sense. In Buddhology there is an idea that the \\"Theosophical Buddhists\\" were the forerunners of all subsequent Western, or, as they were called, \\"white\\" Buddhists. In addition, they attempted to rationalize Buddhism, to cleanse the doctrine, removing from it elements of \\"folk superstition\\". They also tried to identify Buddhism with esoteric doctrine, recognizing the Lord Buddha as the \\"Master-Adept.\\" And finally, they considered it their duty to provide assistance and political support to the oppressed Sinhalese Buddhists. ; Theosophical revival of Buddhism In 1880 Olcott began to build up the Buddhist Educational Movement in Ceylon. In 1880 there were only two schools in Ceylon managed by the Buddhists. Due to the efforts of Olcott the number rose to 205 schools and four colleges in 1907 (Ananda College in Colombo, Mahinda College in Galle, Dharmaraja College in Kandy and Maliyadeva College in Kurunegala). Thus began the great Buddhist revival in Ceylon. Olcott also represented the Buddhist cause to the British government, and found redress for the restrictions imposed against Buddhists, such as the prohibition of processions, Buddhist schools, the improved financial administration of temple properties, and so on. Olcott \\"united the sects of Ceylon in the Buddhist Section of the Theosophical Society (1880); the 12 sects of Japan into a Joint Committee for the promotion of Buddhism (1889); Burma, Siam, and Ceylon into a Convention of Southern Buddhists (1891); and finally Northern and Southern Buddhism through joint signatures to his Fourteen Propositions of Buddhism (1891).\\"  Anagarika Dharmapala  An important part of Olcott's work in Ceylon became the patronage of young Buddhist Don David Hewavitharana, who took himself later name Anagarika Dharmapala. Dharmapala, a founder the Maha Bodhi Society, Sri Lanka's national hero, was one of the major figures in the movement for the revival of Buddhism in Ceylon during the British colonial rule. In December 1884 Blavatsky, accompanied by Leadbeater and the marrieds Cooper- Oakley came to Ceylon. Leadbeater, following the example of the leaders of the Theosophical Society, has officially become a Buddhist, without renouncing Christianity (he was an Anglican priest). David joined the Blavatsky's team to go to India. Upon arrival in India Dharmapala as a member of the Theosophical Society worked with Blavatsky and Olcott. They advised him to devote himself to the service of \\"the benefit of mankind,\\" and begin to study Pali and the Buddhist philosophy. Sangharakshita wrote that at the age of 20 years Dharmapala was equally fascinated by both Buddhism and theosophy. After returning from India, Dharmapala worked in Colombo as general secretary of the Buddhist section of the Theosophical Society, and as director of the Buddhist press. In 1886, he was a translator, when together with Olcott and Leadbeater made a lecture tour of the island. He helped Olcott in a work on the organization of Buddhist schools. When Olcott instructed Leadbeater to prepare a shortened version of the Buddhist Catechism, Dharmapala undertook to translate it to Sinhala. Work of Dharmapala and theosophists contributed to the revival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka and other countries of the Southern Buddhism. Leadbeater has initiated the organization in various parts of Colombo a large number of Buddhist Sunday schools. He also founded an English school, which later became known as Ananda College (one of the most famous schools of Ceylon). Among the pupils of this school was a young Buddhist Jinarajadasa, who later worked as the fourth President of the Theosophical Society Adyar. In 1893, Dharmapala went to the West, first to England and then to the Chicago, where he represented Buddhism at the World Parliament of Religions. Although he was only 29 years old, he was the most famous representative of Buddhism in parliament. At the conference, he made several appearances on three main themes. Firstly, he said that Buddhism is a religion, which perfectly consistent with modern science, because the Buddhist teachings are completely compatible with the doctrine of evolution. He outlined the Buddhist idea that the cosmos is a sequential process of deployment in accordance with the laws of nature. Secondly, Dharmapala said that in the ethics of Buddhism is much more love and compassion than in the sermons of Christian missionaries working in Ceylon. By a third paragraph of his performances was the assertion that Buddhism is a religion of optimism and activity, but in any case not of pessimism and inactivity.  Christmas Humphreys  In 1924 in London Humphreys founded the Buddhist Lodge of the Theosophical Society. According to Humphreys, conceptually the Theosophy and Buddhism are identical: the single life after many incarnations returns to the Unmanifest; all the individual consciousness are unreal compared to the \\"Self\\", which is a reflection of the Absolute; karma and reincarnation are a basic laws. Path lays through self-fulfillment with Nirvana in the end. Thus, wrote Humphreys, the difference between the Theosophy and Buddhism is only in emphasis. Thanks to the missionary efforts of Dharmapala, in 1926 the British Buddhists established their branch Maha Bodhi Society. At the same time the Buddhist Lodge was transformed into the British Buddhist Society, whose president become Humphreys. Humphreys was a tireless lay Buddhist as a lecturer, journalist, writer and organizer. He was the author and/or the editor of The Buddhist Lodge Monthly Bulletin, Buddhism in England, The Middle Way, and The Theosophical Review.  Watts and Conze  British philosopher and Buddhist author Alan Watts became a member of the Buddhist Lodge of the Theosophical Society in London at the age of 15. His first book, The Spirit of Zen came out when he was 19 years old. Another active member of the Theosophical Society was Edward Conze, who later became a famous buddhologist.  D. Suzuki and B. Suzuki  The famous Buddhist philosopher and popularizer of Zen D. T. Suzuki and his wife Beatrice Suzuki became members of the Theosophical Society in Tokyo in 1920; their names appear on the list of Theosophical Society members sent to Adyar on 12 May 1920. After moving to Kyoto in 1924, the Suzukis formed a new branch of the Theosophical Society called the Mahayana Lodge. Most of the Lodge members were university professors. In 1937 Jinarajadasa, future president of the Theosophical Society, read two lectures in Tokyo which were translated into Japanese by D. T. Suzuki.  Analysis of the theosophical texts According to buddhologists Reigle and Taylor, Blavatsky herself, and her immediate Masters, and the Master of her Masters were Buddhists by faith and lexis, who were strongly associated by relationships \\"pupil-teacher\\". Blavatsky often uses in her works the references to Buddhism, in particular, to the Mahayana teachings, while in the \\"mahatma letters\\" Buddhism is present on virtually every page, and it is immediately evident from the frequent use of specific terminology on the Sanskrit, Pali, Tibetan, Chinese and Mongolian languages.  The Mahatma letters  Humphreys wrote that theosophists got their knowledge from two Masters who prepared Blavatsky for her mission in the world. Their letters were published later, in 1923: it was a book The Mahatma Letters to A. P. Sinnett. He noted that the founders of the theosophical movement, Blavatsky and Olcott, publicly declared themselves Buddhists and, more important still, the two Masters, who founded the Theosophical movement, spoke: \\"Our Great Patron is the Teacher of Nirvana and the Law.\\" And their Master, the Maha- Chohan, once said, describing himself and his fellow-adepts, that they were all \\"the devoted followers of the spirit incarnate of absolute self-sacrifice, of philanthropy, divine kindness, as of all the highest virtues attainable on this earth of sorrow, the man of men, Gautama Buddha.\\" Speaking about Buddha, Humphries repeatedly quoted the Master Kuthumi, for example: * \\"Our great Buddha‚Äîthe patron of all the adepts, the reformer and the codifier of the occult system.\\" * \\"In our temples there is neither a god nor gods worshipped, only the thrice sacred memory of the greatest as the holiest man that ever lived.\\" Humphreys stated: \\"All who dare to call themselves Theosophists or Buddhists must study, and teach and strive to apply this garnered Wisdom.\\"  The Secret Doctrine and the Books of Kiu-te  Oldmeadow wrote that Blavatsky's second major work, The Secret Doctrine, includes elements that clearly derive from the Vajrayana, often conflated with Vedantic ideas. He noted: \\"Lama Kazi Dawa Samdup was sufficiently confident of Blavatsky's account of the Bardo to endorse her claim that she had been initiated into 'the higher lamaistic teachings'.\\" Lama Kazi Dawa Samdup (a translator of The Tibetan Book of the Dead) believed that Blavatsky had \\"intimate acquaintance with the higher lamaistic teachings\\". Humphreys in his autobiography praised The Secret Doctrine. At the time he published an abridgment of this book. Blavatsky claimed to have access to a popularised version of Buddhist secret doctrines, a fourteen volume esoteric commentary, \\"worked out from one small archaic folio, the Book of the Secret Wisdom of the World\\", as well as secret texts she termed Kiu-Te. Buddhologist David Reigle identified Blavatsky's \\"Books of Kiu-te\\" as the Tantra section of the Tibetan Buddhist canon.  The Voice of the Silence  Zen Buddhism scholar D. T. Suzuki wrote about Blavatsky's book The Voice of the Silence: \\"Undoubtedly Madame Blavatsky had in some way been initiated into the deeper side of Mahayana teaching and then gave out what she deemed wise to the Western world.\\" He also commented: \\"Here is the real Mahayana Buddhism.\\" In 1927 the staff of the 9th Panchen Lama Tub- ten Cho-gyi Nyima helped Theosophists put out the \\"Peking Edition\\" of The Voice of the Silence. The 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso wrote in the preface to the 1989 Centenary edition of The Voice of the Silence, \\"I believe that this book has strongly influenced many sincere seekers and aspirants to the wisdom and compassion of the Bodhisattva Path.\\" Humphreys wrote: \\"The Buddhists and Theosophists of the West, all converts, be it noted, from some other faith, have much in common: The Voice of the Silence ('a pure Buddhist work', as the late Anagarika Dharmapala of Ceylon wrote to me, and the Dalai Lama signed my copy long ago) and Colonel Olcott's Buddhist Catechism.\\" According to Kalnitsky, the contents of The Voice of the Silence reflects \\"authentic Buddhist sentiment, even if not universally acknowledged as a pure Buddhist historical document.\\"  Esoteric Buddhism  According to Lopez, the author of Esoteric Buddhism \\"has a broader view of the Buddha\\" than that of Western Buddhologists and scholars of Oriental studies. Sinnett stated that the Buddha is simply one of a row \\"of adepts who have appeared over the course of the centuries.\\" Buddha's next incarnation happened approximately sixty years after his death. He appeared as Shankara, the well-known Vedantic philosopher. Sinnett noted that for the uninitiated it is known that date of Shankara's birth is one thousand years after Buddha's death, and that he was hostile to Buddhism. Sinnett wrote that the Buddha came as Shankara \\"to fill up some gaps and repair certain errors in his own previous teaching.\\" The Buddha had departed \\"from the practice of earlier adepts by opening the path\\" to adeptship to men of all castes. \\"Although well intentioned, this led\\" to a deterioration of occult knowledge when it was penetrated into ignominious hands. Sinnett wrote that to further appeared a need \\"to take no candidates except from the class which, on the whole, by reason of its hereditary advantages, is likely to be the best nursery of fit candidates.\\" Sinnett claimed that the Buddha's next incarnation was as the great Tibetan adept reformer of the 14th century Tsong-ka-pa.  Criticism  The existence of a hidden or esoteric teaching in Buddhism is not accepted by Theravadin Buddhists. For example, Rhys Davids wrote: > \\"In this connection I shall doubtless be expected to say a few words on > Theosophy, if only because one of the books giving an account of that very > curious and widely spread movement has been called Esoteric Buddhism. It has > always been a point of wonder to me why the author should have chosen this > particular title for his treatise. For if there is anything that can be said > with absolute certainty about the book it is, that it is not esoteric, and > not Buddhism. The original Buddhism was the very contrary of esoteric.\\" Gu√©non believed that Blavatskyan \\"theosophism\\" is a \\"confused mixture\\" of Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, Jewish Kabbalah, Hermeticism, and occultism. He wrote: \\"From the start this heteroclite mixture was presented as 'esoteric Buddhism'; but since it was still too easy to see that it presented only very vague relationships with true Buddhism.\\" Oldmeadow claimed: > \\"Despite the legend which she and her hagiographers propagated, Blavatsky > never stepped on Tibetan soil. Her claims that her later writings derived > from Himalayan Mahatmas, forming a kind of Atlantean brotherhood residing in > secrecy in a remote region of Tibet and with access to longhidden, > antediluvian sources of esoteric wisdom, need not be treated seriously.\\" In 2015 Uditha Devapriya stated that Olcott's Buddhist Catechism was based on the Catholic Catechism, and his schools were by same institutions which he criticised: \\"This meant that the Buddhism he 'founded' was not the sort of Buddhism which Gunananda Thero began a journey to find.\\" See also * Buddhism and science * Buddhist modernism * Christianity and Theosophy * Esoteric Buddhism * \\"Is Theosophy a Religion?\\" * Theosophy and literature * Roerichism * Theosophy and Hinduism * Theosophy and Western philosophy * Vipassana movement * \\"What Is Theosophy?\\" References Notes Citations  Sources     * Further reading  * Theosophy Category:Religious studies Buddhism ","title":"Buddhism and Theosophy"},{"id":"4276970","text":"Oof is an album by the punk rock band Happy Flowers.

History   Cornelius Low, Jr.  Cornelius Low Jr. (c. 1700‚Äì1777) was the third of fifteen children. His grandfather, Peter Cornellessen Low, left Holland for the American colonies in 1659 and settled near Kingston, New York. Peter's eldest son, Cornelius Low, moved to New York and established himself as a merchant. He married Margareta Van Borsum in 1695. During the 1720s, Cornelius Low, Jr. became a successful merchant in Newark, New Jersey. In 1729, he married Johanna Gouveneur and they made plans to move to the emerging port community of Raritan Landing, near New Brunswick. Having shipping capabilities, Low became one of the community's most prosperous businessmen. During a great flood in 1738, Low lost his first home, located along the wharf near Landing Lane, in Raritan. Low obtained property for a new house on the bluff, opposite the Great Road (River Road) and overlooking the Landing. Low called the new home the ‚Äúnew house on the mountain,‚Äù referring to an entry in his family Bible. The new location allowed Low to keep a watchful eye on the activities at the wharves, and especially at his warehouse located between the river and the Great Road. Cornelius Low died in early 1777, but the British spared his house because his loyalty to the King of England remained steadfast until his death.  Architecture  The main portion of the home measures forty feet by thirty feet and originally included a -story kitchen wing. When it was built, it was one of the largest and most expensive in the province of East Jersey. It was built with more than 350 tons of sandstone. While most of the homes at Raritan Landing had stone foundations, this was the only house to have been built entirely out of stone. Today, the community of Raritan Landing is all but forgotten. The remains of the once-thriving village lie beneath portions of Johnson Park and River Road. The Low House is one of two remaining structures from the Landing and is a vital link to Piscataway and Middlesex County history. Low wished the front of his home to reflect his stature as one of the most influential and prosperous men of the community. To that end, a ledge, or sill course, sits approximately three feet up from the ground and encircles the house. This sill makes the house appear to be sitting on a pedestal. Low purchased large, rectangular blocks of high quality stone for the front facade (facing the river and the community of Raritan Landing), most likely quarried in the Newark area. Low was a frugal man and the only finely dressed stone is on the side of the house facing Raritan Landing. The other three sides were built of less expensive rubble stone, or irregular pieces that required minimal dressing.  Kitchen \\"ghost\\"  It is believed the Metlar family removed the kitchen wing around 1870.. A shadow, or kitchen \\"ghost,\\" of the removed structure is visible on the exterior due to the different colored mortar between the stones. Within the shadow, an outline of the doorway that led into this room is visible. Due to its proximity to the kitchen, this room was most likely used primarily for dining or entertaining. Delft tiles The fireplaces in the Low House contain original 18th century Delft tiles. Delft tiles take their name from the city Delft, in Holland, where the tiles were first created in the 16th century. Until that time, tiles had been used as flooring and were made from red clay. By the end of the 16th century the tiles were used as wall tiles in many homes. Dutch houses were built near the water and, given the climate, tiles were ideal for keeping out the dampness and were used on the joining of walls and floors and for walls behind fireplaces..  Restoration   Preservation  The five families that have owned the property‚Äîthe Lows, Pools, Metlars, Voorhees and the Strongs‚Äîtook their charge very seriously. They were, for the most part, wealthier families who could economically afford the maintenance necessary with a property such as this. The Low House today is one of only two remaining structures from Raritan Landing, and is considered one of the finest examples of Georgian-style architecture in America. In 1979, Middlesex County, New Jersey bought the house and grounds. Under the guidance and administration of the Middlesex County Cultural and Heritage Commission. The County acquired the Low House to use as a local heritage museum for discussing the history of New Jersey and its context within that of national events.  Exterior restoration  While the house was in fair condition when obtained by the county, some changes were made. A garage and pool were removed from the back yard, and a new parking area was created next to the building. The ivy, which caused people to refer to the house as ‚ÄúIvy Hall,‚Äù was removed. The entire roof, including the badly deteriorated support structure, was replaced in 1982‚Äì1983. Cedar shingles replaced the slate tiles that had been put on decades earlier. In 1987‚Äì1988, restoration replicas were installed to replace badly worn windows on the side of the house facing the water. During the 1990s, a massive restoration was initiated to address major issues plaguing the Low House. In 1995, the Cultural and Heritage Commission and the Board of Chosen Freeholders accepted a grant from the New Jersey State Historic Trust for the restoration of the Low House. Under the guidance of Ford Farwell Mills and Gatch architects of Princeton, the restoration took place between 1995 and 1996. The Commission also installed new landscaping and built an \\"interpretive path,\\" which included installations that tell the history of the house. The front facade was also repointed. The first and second floor windows are approximately three inches off square and appear crooked. Originally, the two basement windows closest to the front entrance were doorways. These allowed access to the basement for Low's servants and workers so that certain goods could be stored there rather than in the warehouse along the Great Road. The front yard has since been substantially filled but the doorway outlines are still visible in the basement. Sometime after Low's death, these doorways were altered and turned into windows. Subsequently, the house settled and these windows are no longer square. In the mid-1980s, the front windows, having been severely exposed to the elements, were replaced. Rather than square up the window openings, the restoration firm installed fully functional, though crooked, windows in their place.  Interior restoration  From 1995 through most of 1996, Arvid Myhre Building Construction Company of Frenchtown, New Jersey completed the physical rehabilitation of the house. 26 layers of paint were stripped from the woodwork which was then repainted in historically accurate colors. Behind-the-scenes work included complete upgrades of heating and cooling systems, new electrical wiring encased in metal conduit, a state- of-the-art dry-feed fire suppression system, and new plumbing and water supply systems. Additionally, an exhibit system was fabricated to protect the original plaster walls, while still allowing the museum to install changing exhibitions.  Archaeology  Prior to restoration, an archaeological study of the grounds was undertaken, led by Hunter Research of Trenton. These digs yielded a wide variety of objects including clay pipe fragments, Delft tiles, glass pieces, and a British military button. The artifacts would help give more clues to what was going on in and around this house over the years, and would also confirm previous theories and thoughts regarding its history.

He has written three books, collaborated with a number of musicians, and has released twelve solo albums. Fred Frith called Ostertag his \\"guru\\", and Robert Fripp once described him as \\"the only guy on synthesizer who interests me\\".  Early career  Raised in Colorado, Ostertag studied at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. In 1976, he formed the improvisation ensemble Fall Mountain with Ned Rothenberg on reeds and Jim Katzin on violin, himself on electronic keyboard. The ensemble released Early Fall in 1979. Later that same year, Ostertag relocated to New York City, where he befriended John Zorn, Fred Frith, Zeena Parkins, and several other musicians interested in collaborative improvisation. In 1980, Ostertag released Getting a Head with guitarist Fred Frith and drummer Charles Noyes. Ostertag's use of sampling, tape manipulation, and electronic custom-made instruments created a unique sound and approach to improvised music. Following the release of Getting a Head, Ostertag became the first of his generation of musicians to have his work presented at The Kitchen, at the time New York City's premiere venue for new music.  Musical inactivity  With his sudden success came a greater involvement in politics, specifically in the turbulent revolutions and counter-revolutions of South America in the 1980s. In response to the political climate, Ostertag released Voice of America. As Ostertag became increasingly involved in such political issues, and increasingly dissatisfied with the music industry, he moved to El Salvador in 1982 and, for nearly seven years, abandoned music altogether. His experiences in El Salvador were later synthesized into his piece Sooner or Later. Ostertag became an expert on the political crisis in Central America and published widely for a diverse range of publications, including Pensamiento Propio (Nicaragua) Pensamiento Critico (Puerto Rico), The Guardian (London), the Weekly Mail (South Africa), Mother Jones and the NACLA Report on the Americas (US), AMPO (Japan), and even the clandestine theoretical journal of the New People's Army in the Philippines. He alternated his time in Central America with organizing and public speaking in the US, giving lectures at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Rutgers, and many other schools and institutions. Some of his writings from Central America are included in his 2009 book of collected essays, \\"Creative Life: Music, Politics, People, and Machines\\"  Return to music  Ostertag returned to music in 1989 and toured with Fred Frith's Keep the Dog. He also appeared in Nicolas Humbert and Werner Penzel's 1990 documentary film on Frith, Step Across the Border. Ostertag released Attention Span in 1990, featuring Frith on guitars and John Zorn on saxophone. Ostertag followed Attention Span with the release of Sooner or Later, his musical response to his years in El Salvador and the first part of a trilogy to treat the themes of grief, anger, and joy. In 1992, The Kronos Quartet commissioned a new work from Ostertag. This commission produced the landmark work Bob Ostertag: All the Rage. Ostertag composed the piece using a recording of the AB101 Veto Riot in San Francisco. Ostertag originally conceived Bob Ostertag: All the Rage as a collaboration with writer/painter/photographer/film maker David Wojnarowicz, but David was ill with AIDS. When David died before the collaboration could take place, Ostertag made a second, solo piece from the riot recordings, Burns Like Fire, and dedicated it to Wojnarowicz. In 1993, Ostertag formed Say No More, a virtual quartet, with vocalist Phil Minton, drummer Joey Baron, bassist Mark Dresser, percussionist Gerry Hemingway. The group's music was actually composed by a computer and sampler from separate individual performances and then released as Say No More in 1993, the live ‚Äì In Person in 1994, Verbatim in 1996 and Verbatim Flesh & Blood in 2000. In 1999, after 10 years working with the same Ensoniq ASR-10 sampler, Ostertag switched to a laptop computer and began writing his own audio performance software through Max/MSP. This allows him use various controllers, including joysticks, game pads, and drawing tablets in his performances. This same year, Ostertag released Like a Melody, No Bitterness his first CD of solo improvisation. This CD is a tribute to his sampler that he spent the last decade mastering as an instrument. Ostertag has also scored multimedia pieces such as Spiral in 1996. In 2000, Ostertag began work with Pierre H√©bert and Baltazar L√≥pez on a full- scale multi-media and theater work, Between Science and Garbage, commissioned by Meet the Composer and the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. On March 25, 2006, Ostertag made all of his recordings to which he owns the rights available as digital downloads under a Creative Commons Attribution- NonCommercial 2.5 license.  Writing  Ostertag‚Äôs first book was the anonymously published \\"The Yes Men: The True Story of the End of the World Trade Organization (2004)\\". In 2006 he published a history of radical journalism in the US, \\"People's Movements, People's Press: The Journalism of Social Justice Movements\\". Three years later he published a collection of essays on music, politics, and technology, \\"Creative Life: Music, Politics, People, and Machines\\". In 2012 he co-authored \\"Raising Expectations (And Raising Hell), My Decade Fighting for the Labor Movement\\" with Jane McAlevey. The book was named \\"the most valuable book of 2012\\" by The Nation magazine. For many years he wrote a blog on The Huffington Post.  Later activities  In 2007 Ostertag released his first download only recording w00t, a CD-length work composed of fragments of computer game music. He returned to synthesizer music in a series of releases, including Motormouth: Bob Ostertag Plays the Buchla 200e (2011), Bob Ostertag Plays the Aalto (2013), and Bob Ostertag Plays the Serge!, which was released in 2014 but featured early synthesizer music recorded between 1978 and 1983. In 2011, Ostertag released a collaborative EP released on underground techno label Sandwell District with artist Rrose. Her interpretation of Ostertag's work was well received by critics, which led to another collaborative EP, released during the summer of 2012, entitled \\"The Surgeon General.\\" With A Book of Hours (2012), Ostertag introduced a new ensemble featuring saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell and vocalists Phil Minton, Shelley Hirsch, and Theo Bleckmann. His collaboration with Quebecois animator Pierre H√©bert produced numerous multi-media works, including Between Science and Garbage, Special Forces, A Portrait of Buddha, Endangered Species, and Shadow Boxing, which was premiered on an extensive tour of China and Southeast Asia in 2013. In 2019, Bob Ostertag premiered his documentary, Thanks to Hank about the life of artist and activist Hank Wilson. It features music by the Kronos Quartet, Carla Kihlstedt, and The Tin Hat Trio, and animation by Jeremy Rourke. , he was Professor in the faculty of Technocultural Studies at UC Davis.

Or, the mystery of Admiral Beaufort's cipher. Mathematics and Computers in Simulation 35 (1993) 327-367 Its most famous application was in a rotor-based cipher machine, the Hagelin M-209.Mollin, Richard A., An Introduction to Cryptography, page 100. Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2001 The Beaufort cipher is based on the Beaufort square which is essentially the same as a Vigen√®re square but in reverse order starting with the letter \\"Z\\" in the first row, where the first row and the last column serve the same purpose. Using the cipher To encrypt, first choose the plaintext character from the top row of the tableau; call this column P. Secondly, travel down column P to the corresponding key letter K. Finally, move directly left from the key letter to the left edge of the tableau, the ciphertext encryption of plaintext P with key K will be there. For example if encrypting plain text character \\"d\\" with key \\"m\\" the steps would be: # find the column with \\"d\\" on the top, # travel down that column to find key \\"m\\", # travel to the left edge of the tableau to find the ciphertext letter (\\"J\\" in this case). To decrypt, the process is reversed. The Beaufort cipher is a reciprocal cipher, that is, decryption and encryption algorithms are the same.  Algebraic description  The Beaufort cipher can be described algebraically. For example, using an encoding of the letters ‚Äì as the numbers 0‚Äì25 and using addition modulo 26, let M = M_1 \\\\dots M_n be the characters of the message, C = C_1 \\\\dots C_n be the characters of the cipher text and K = K_1 \\\\dots K_n be the characters of the key, repeated if necessary. Then Beaufort encryption E can be written, :C_i = E_K(M_i) = (K_i- M_i) \\\\mod {26}. Similarly, decryption D using the key K, :M_i = D_K(C_i) = (K_i-C_i) \\\\mod {26}. Decrypting as a Vigenere cipher Due to the similarities between the Beaufort cipher and the Vigen√®re cipher it is possible, after applying a transformation, to solve it as a Vigen√®re cipher. By replacing every letter in the ciphertext and keytext with its opposite letter (such that 'a' becomes 'z', 'b' becomes 'y' etc.) it can be solved like a Vigen√®re cipher. Distinguished from 'variant Beaufort' The Beaufort cipher should not be confused with the \\"variant Beaufort\\" cipher. In variant Beaufort, encryption is performed by performing the decryption step of the standard Vigen√®re cipher, and likewise decryption is performed by using Vigen√®re encryption.

It was a re- badged Philips-designed product (Philips CDF-100) which was sold in addition to Apple's speakers and also included a remote control. The PowerCD was capable of reading Kodak photo CDs, data CDs and audio CDs. It can connect to Apple Macintosh personal computers through SCSI and also to stereo systems and televisions. History With the success of the Apple Newton, in mid-1992 Apple Industrial Design Group created a division called Mac Like Things which was to focus on what they saw as a whole new market for Apple in consumer electronic devices. The PowerCD marked Apple's first stand-alone consumer- oriented product brought to market, which did not require a computer for use. It was analogous to Sony's Discman portable CD players of the time, however, unlike Sony's and most others, Apple's could also be used as computer peripheral as well. And while most desktop Macs at the time included built-in CD-ROMs, the PowerCD was designed to match the PowerBook series which would not include a built-in CD-ROM for several more years. Its ability to be operated under battery power alone made it not only a portable drive for computers, but gave it the added ability to be marketed as a stand-alone portable CD player. However, Mac Like Things was short-lived and by September 1992, it was folded into Apple's New Media Group having only brought to market the PowerCD and AppleDesign Powered Speakers series. AppleDesign Powered Speakers AppleDesign Powered Speakers (M6082) Along with the PowerCD, Apple released two versions of their desktop speakers: the AppleDesign Powered Speakers and the redesigned AppleDesign Powered Speakers II a year later. The original speakers came in Platinum gray to match Apple's desktop line, while the second generation were curvier and also came in a darker gray color designed to match the PowerBook line and PowerCD. Both were powered with an AC adapter and could be attached to any audio output source, with two separate inputs for the computer and an external CD player. Both had a headphone jack in the front of one speaker along with the volume control and an optional subwoofer connection port on some models.

History  The castle was transferred in 1015 from the private estate of Meinwerk, bishop of Paderborn to the city of Paderborn. Since 1150 it is the seat of the noble lords of Plesse, who named themselves for the castle. Holy Roman emperor Henry VI traded Plesse Castle in 1192 for Desenberg Castle close to Warburg in Westphalia, but the trade was already reverted in 1195. In 1447 the lords of Plesse transferred their possession of Plesse Castle to the Landgrave Ludwig of Hesse and in return received it as a fiefdom. The explanation for it lies in the fragmentation of the dukedom of Brunswick-G√∂ttingen. The leading noble families could not avoid being drawn into the ensuing conflicts. They therefore sought protection from a powerful liege lord. They found this protection and backup with another ruler, who was Ludwig of Hesse. In 1536 the protestant reformation was introduced to the dominion of Plesse, which also comprised the surrounding villages. The house of Plesse became extinct with the death of Dietrich IV of Plesse in 1571. Landgrave William IV of Hesse- Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) then took possession of the dominion of Plesse, as this was his right as liege lord. Moritz of Hesse-Kassel converted the people of the Plesse dominion to the reformed creed in 1614. Between 1623 and 1624 he and his family took refuge in the castle various times. After a siege in 1627 during the Thirty Years' War the castle and the dominion of Plesse were ceded temporarily to the landgrave George II of Hesse-Darmstadt. In 1660 the castle was abandoned finally and afterwards served as a quarry for the residents of the surrounding villages. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe visited the castle in 1801. Prior to French occupation in 1807, the dominion became the Canton Bovenden in the Kingdom of Westphalia. After the collapse of Westphalia in 1813 the now Electorate of Hesse-Kassel retook control of the dominion of Plesse. In a barter between Prussia, the Kingdom of Hanover and the Electorate of Hesse-Kassel the dominion of Plesse became part of Hanover on May 1, 1817. Starting in 1821 first attempts to restore parts of the castle were undertaken, and between 1853 and 1864, on initiative of the ruling family of Hanover, it came to a complete restoration of the castle.

Editorial El Nacional, most widely known for its El Nacional newspaper and website. It, along with √öltimas Noticias and El Universal, are the most widely read and circulated daily national newspapers in the country, and it has an average of more than 80,000 papers distributed daily and 170,000 copies on weekends. Producto, De Caracas para Venezuela It has traditionally had a center-left ideology, but has recently moved to the center. The paper supported the candidacy of Hugo Chavez in 1998. Current editor and proprietor Miguel Henrique Otero founded the Movimiento 2D opposition movement, which supports the opposition electoral coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democr√°tica. Since the increase of censorship in Venezuela during the presidencies of Hugo Ch√°vez and Nicol√°s Maduro, El Nacional has been described as one of the last independent newspapers in Venezuela. El Nacional published its final print edition on 14 December 2018 (after having been cut to five print editions per week back in August), joining in the dozens of anti-government newspapers in the nation that have stopped printing due to paper and toner shortages. It will become an exclusively online newspaper after the date. Contributors and owners El Nacional was founded in August 1943 in Caracas by Miguel Otero Silva and is directed by Chief Editorial Officer Miguel Henrique Otero, grandson of the founder, and by Chief Executive Officer Manuel Sucre. The newspaper's first director was poet Antonio Arr√°iz (1903‚Äì1962). In the newspaper have contributed many of the most recognized Venezuelan writers. Arturo √öslar Pietri, one of the most important intellectuals of the country and its director, wrote for more than fifty years in an opinion column in the newspaper. Former editors include Jos√© Ram√≥n Medina and Miguel Otero Silva. In 1961 an advertising boycott in opposition to the paper's leftist views (its then editor, Miguel Otero Silva, had been a member of the Communist Party of Venezuela) nearly forced the paper into bankruptcy.Virtue, John et al (1994), Journalists in the Andes, Florida International University, p119 Editorial position and management Historically, the newspaper received criticism by the governments under the AD and COPEI parties for it had tended to support the political beliefs of the moderate left and the middle class.EL PERI√ìDICO EL NACIONAL DE VENEZUELA Y LAS ELECCIONES EN ESTADOS UNIDOS In late 2007 editor and proprietor Miguel Henrique Otero founded the Movimiento 2D opposition movement, which supported the opposition electoral coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democr√°tica in the September 2010 parliamentary election.

Controversy On 14 April 2018, colectivos attacked the headquarters of El Nacional, kidnapping security workers and a janitor. Weeks after the Venezuelan presidential election in 2018, the newspaper had their Hypertext Transfer Protocol momentarily censored by the state-run CANTV from 7 June to 11 June 2018. The newspaper has since had its website continuously censored in Venezuela, being described as one of the last independent media organizations in Venezuela. After the government pressed charges against El Nacional, proposing the payment of a fine of 1 billion bol√≠vares, Bolivarian government official Diosdado Cabello replied to the newspaper's publishing of Venezuela's hyperinflation figures stating \\"if it was a billion bol√≠vares, let's ... put five zeros next to it\\". Cabello targeted the newspaper even further, stating in late-September 2018 that he sought to acquire the newspaper's headquarters and convert it into a university.

Early life He was born in Knottsville, Kentucky and attended local schools. He became a newspaper writer after being fascinated by papers as a boy. Marriage and family Gore married and he and his wife had nine children. Newspaper career He went on to become an editor-publisher in the Scripps chain, soon heading newspapers in Evansville, Indiana, and Terre Haute, Indiana. While the editor-publisher of the Terre Haute Post, Gore conceived the idea of \\"giving away\\" $1,000 travel life insurance policies with new newspaper subscriptions. After securing an underwriter, Gore took his program nationwide. Within a year, he was worth just over a hundred million dollars (2.6 billion in 2015), later establishing another publishing house in Terre Haute and an insurance agency in Chicago to handle the business. Governor of Puerto Rico While residing in Terre Haute, Gore met Franklin D. Roosevelt campaigning for Vice President of the U.S. That fortuitous meeting ultimately resulted in Gore's appointment as Governor of Puerto Rico. Prior to his stint in Puerto Rico, he split his time between his interests in Terre Haute, Chicago and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. According to The Washington Post, Gore was a strong campaigner for Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 election. This contributed to Roosevelt's decision to reward Gore with the appointment as governor the following year. According to his biography, Gore was a key Roosevelt supporter. During his inaugural speech as governor, on July 1, 1933, Gore outlined his platform for the protectorate in three major elements: eventual statehood, opposition to birth control (there had been considerable controversy over this issue during the term of his predecessor, Governor James Rumsey BeverleyA Guide to the James R. Beverley Papers, 1904-1967, Briscoe Center for American History, University of Texas at Austin, Retrieved 20 December 2012) and legalizing cockfighting, which Gore believed would benefit tourism. (His plan included a yearly \\"great carnival of cockfighting\\" to attract mainland tourists.) Rather than suggesting birth control to the predominantly Catholic residents, Gore advocated a plan to relocate Puerto Ricans to Florida to relieve overcrowding on the island. He also recommended greater links with his home city of Chicago, and minimizing government spending. During his term as governor, a political satire drama was written by Gustavo Jim√©nez Sicard√≥, entitled \\"Gore's Hell,\\" which criticized his political views on Puerto Rico.Un pueblo que quiso vivir, by Gustavo Jim√©nez Sicard√≥, pgs. 158-163. There was an attempt against his life, organized by a group of 14 individuals from different political views on the island.M√°s de cien a√±os de carpeteo en Puerto Rico, by Jos√© E. Mart√≠nez, 2003, pg. 18. On January 12, 1934, Gore's \\"resignation\\" was accepted.Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n: Puerto Rico's Democratic Revolution by A. W. Maldonado, pg. 112. He was replaced by Blanton Winship. After his stint as governor, Gore served as an alternate delegate to the 1944 Democratic National Convention. Orchids After learning about orchids in Puerto Rico and returning to Florida, he began to cultivate and sell orchids maintaining a very large green house.

These samples provided a deliberately provocative backdrop for beatbox rhythms and cryptic, political raps. Shortly after independent release in June 1987, the JAMs were ordered by the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society to destroy all unsold copies of the album, following a complaint from ABBA. In response, the JAMs disposed of many copies of 1987 in unorthodox, publicised ways. They also released a version of the album titled 1987 (The JAMs 45 Edits), stripped of all unauthorised samples to leave periods of protracted silence and so little audible content that it was formally classed as a 12-inch single. A limited edition release subjected to recall and a destruction order, 1987 became something of a rarity and by 2000, mint condition copies were trading for ¬£60. Background and recording On New Year's Day 1987, Bill Drummond decided to make a hip hop record under the pseudonym \\"the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu\\". First broadcast in 1994, per Knowing little about modern music technology, he invited Jimmy Cauty, a former member of the band Brilliant, to join him. Cauty agreed, and the JAMs' debut single \\"All You Need Is Love\\" was independently released on 9 March 1987 as a limited-edition one-sided white label 12-inch. Cauty became \\"Rockman Rock\\", and Drummond used the nickname \\"King Boy D\\". The reaction to \\"All You Need Is Love\\" was positive; the British music newspaper Sounds listed it as the single of the week, and lauded The JAMs as \\"the hottest, most exhilarating band this year\\". \\"All You Need Is Love\\"'s reliance on uncleared, often illegal samples made commercial release impossible. In response, the JAMs re-edited the single, removing or doctoring the most antagonistic samples, and re-released it as \\"All You Need Is Love (106 bpm)\\" in May 1987. According to Drummond, profits from this re-release funded the recording of their first album. This was the first of many \\"Information Sheet\\"s that KLF Communications would send out to fans and the press. The JAMs had completed and pressed copies of the album by early May 1987, but did not have a distributor.News item, Sounds, 9 May 1987 The basic track for \\"All You Need Is Love\\" was written in part on a Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer Like \\"All You Need Is Love\\", the album was made using an Apple II computer, a Greengate DS3 digital sampler peripheral card, and a Roland TR-808 drum machine. Being a guide to recreating the record at home, this communique from The JAMs provided detailed information about the construction of the album and the samples used. Using portions from existing works and pasting them into new contexts, with the duo stealing \\"everything\\" and \\"taking... plagiarism to its absurd conclusion,\\" several songs were liberally plagiarised. This mashup of samples was underpinned by rudimentary beatbox rhythms and overlaid with Drummond's raps of social commentary, esoteric metaphors and mockery. Drummond would later say in an interview that: Composition 1987 is built around samples of other artists' work, \\"to the point where the presence of original material becomes questionable\\". The album is raw and unpolished, the sound contrasting sharply with the meticulous production and tight house rhythms of the duo's later work as the KLF. The beatbox rhythms are basic (\\"weedy\\", according to Q magazine), samples often cut abruptly, and distinctive plagiarised melodies are often played with a high-pitched rasping accompaniment. The plagiarised works are arranged so as to juxtapose with each other as a backdrop for the JAMs' rebellious messages and social comments. The lyrics include self- referential statements of the JAMs' agenda, imbued with their fictional backstory adopted from The Illuminatus! Trilogy. Several songs (such as \\"The Queen and I\\" and \\"All You Need Is Love\\") have specific societal targets for Drummond's satirical raps. Side one The album's opening song, \\"Hey Hey We Are Not The Monkees\\", begins with simulated human sexual intercourse noises arranged as a rhythm. The album's first sample is \\"Here we come...\\" from the Monkees' theme. It progresses into a cryptic and bleak spoken verse from Drummond: \\"Here we come, crawling out of the mud, from chaos primeval to the burned out sun, dragging our bad selves from one end of time, with nothing to declare but some half-written rhymes\\". A cacophone of further samples from The Monkees' theme and Drummond's voice follow ‚Äì \\"We're not The Monkees, I don't even like The Monkees!\\" ‚Äì before it gets interrupted by an original a cappella vocal line that later became The KLF's \\"Justified and Ancient\\" ‚Äì \\"We're justified/And we're ancient ... We don't want to upset the apple cart/And we don't wanna cause any harm\\". The track is followed by a long sample of a London Underground train arriving at and leaving a tube station, with its recorded warning to passengers, \\"Mind the gap...\\". \\"Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)\\" follows, featuring The JAMs' associates Chike (rapper) and DJ Cesare (scratches). Built around The Dave Brubeck Quartet's \\"Take Five\\" and Fred Wesley's \\"Same Beat\\", the lyrics are mostly unconventional, with the majority of the song containing references to food: \\"I was pushing my trolley from detergent to cheese when I first saw the man with antler ears. I tried to ignore but his gaze held my eyes when he told me the truth about the basket of lies\\". Sounds considered the message of the song (if any) to be a modern version of Robin Hood: \\"This is piracy in action, with the venerable music industry figure, King Boy D, setting himself up as the Robin Hood of rap as he steals from the rich vaults of recording history\\". The first side of the LP closes with \\"Rockman Rock (Parts 2 and 3)\\", a homage to Jimmy Cauty that plagiarises from an array of sources, including the \\"Bo Diddley Beat\\" and \\"Sunrise Sunset\\" from the Fiddler on the Roof soundtrack. Led Zeppelin's \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" and \\"Houses of the Holy\\" can be also heard in this track. Side one would not close until \\"Why Did You Throw Away Your Giro?\\", a track consisting of a question in reference to a line from \\"Rockman Rock\\" from a female adult jokingly answered by a male person, ended in 20 seconds. Side two The second side begins with \\"Me Ru Con\\", a traditional Vietnamese song performed a cappella by the JAMs' friend Duy Khiem. According to Drummond, it was a spontaneous recital by Khiem, who was in the studio contributing clarinet and tenor sax to the album. Khiem's vocal performance was later sampled by The KLF on the ambient house soundtrack to their movie, The Rites of Mu. \\"The Queen and I\\" features extensive samples from ABBA's \\"Dancing Queen\\", often overlain with a rasping detuned accompaniment. These lead into Drummond's satirical and discontent rapping, a fictional account of his march into the British House of Commons and Buckingham Palace to demand answers. The song also protests the involvement of cigarette companies in sport (\\"When cancer is the killer/John Player run the league\\") and lambasts the \\"tabloid mentality\\" (\\"They all keep talking about Princess Di's dress\\"). The Sex Pistols' \\"God Save the Queen\\" is briefly sampled. After nearly three minutes of samples from the television show Top of the Pops, as well as sound clips from programmes and advertisements on other TV channels, Drummond cries \\"Fuck that, let's have The JAMs!\\". The acerbic \\"All You Need Is Love (106 bpm)\\" follows. A \\"stunning audio collage\\" featuring an AIDS public information film, a rerecording of glamour model Samantha Fox's \\"Touch Me (I Want Your Body)\\", and the nursery rhyme \\"Ring a Ring o' Roses\\", \\"All You Need Is Love\\" comments on sex and the British media's reaction to the AIDS crisis. The final track on the album is \\"Next\\", which Drummond describes as \\"the only angst-er on the album\\", with \\"imagery of war and sordid sex\\". The track samples Stevie Wonder's \\"Superstition\\", Scott Walker's \\"Next\\" from Scott 2, the Fall's \\"Totally Wired,\\" and Julie Andrews' \\"The Lonely Goatherd\\" from The Sound of Music, alongside Khiem's original melancholy clarinet and tenor saxophone contributions (\\"a saxophone of stupefying tediosity\\", according to Danny Kelly [Album review of 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)]). Bill Drummond summed up The JAMs' approach to composition in the first \\"KLF Information Sheet\\", sent out in October 1987: \\"We made [the album] not giving a shit for soul boy snob values or any other values, we just went in and made the noise we wanted to hear and the stuff that came out of our mouths.... Not a pleasant sound but it's the noise we had. We pressed it up and stuck it out. A celebration of sorts.\\" Jimmy Cauty defended sampling as an artistic practice: \\"It's not as if we're taking anything away, just borrowing and making things bigger. If you're creative you aren't going to stop working just because there is a law against what you are doing.\\" In 1991, Drummond admitted: \\"We didn't listen to 1987 What The Fuck's Going On for a long time, and when we did we were embarrassed by it because it was so badly recorded. But I still felt we were able to get a lot out of ourselves through it.\\" Release and controversy 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?) was released in June 1987 on The JAMs' own record label, \\"The Sound of Mu(sic)\\". 1987 was met with mixed reviews in most of the major British music publications, including Melody Maker, NME, Sounds, and Q, and the album came to the attention of the management of Swedish pop group ABBA: The JAMs had sampled large portions of the ABBA single \\"Dancing Queen\\" on the track \\"The Queen And I\\". A legal showdown with ABBA and the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society (MCPS) followed, 1987 was forcibly withdrawn from sale, and The JAMs were ordered to \\"deliver up the master tape, mothers, stampers and any other parts commensurate with manufacture of the record\\".News item, Sounds, 12 September 1987.Davage, I., letter from the MCPS to The JAMs, reproduced in \\"The KLF 1987 Completeist List\\" [sic], an insert to Who Killed The JAMs?, KLF Communications JAMS LP2, 1988. King Boy D and Rockman Rock travelled to ABBA's home country of Sweden, in the hope of meeting with ABBA personally, taking an NME journalist and photographer with them, along with most of the remaining copies of the LP and a gold disc of the album. Failing to find ABBA in residence at Polar Studios in Stockholm, they instead presented the gold disc to a blonde prostitute they pretended was Agnetha \\"fallen on hard times\\". Of the original LP's stock, some copies were disposed overboard on the North Sea ferry trip across, and the remainder were burned in a field in Gothenburg before dawn (as shown on the cover of their next album, Who Killed The JAMs?, and detailed in that album's single \\"Burn the Bastards\\"). The JAMs also played a recording of \\"The Queen and I\\" loudly outside the offices of ABBA's record label, Polar Music. The trip was unexpectedly eventful, the JAMs accidentally hitting and killing a moose, and later being shot at by a farmer, a bullet cracking the engine of their Ford Galaxie police car. They were, by their own account, towed back to England by the AA. The JAMs were not entirely sure what they would have said to ABBA if they had been able to meet them. Rockman told NME: \\"We were hoping to explain [our artistic justification] to them and that maybe we'd come out of it friends, you know, them producing our album and us producing theirs‚Äîthe kind of thing that often happens at these meetings.\\" King Boy: \\"Yeah, we'd have said, 'Look, you haven't had many hits lately, you don't really wanna bother with all this West End musical shit do you? Come and do the new JAMMS [sic] album.'\\" In 1994, The Guardian looked back on the Swedish sojourn as \\"a grand, futile, attention-grabbing gesture, the kind that would come to characterise [the duo's] collaborative career... \\"We were being totally stupid about it\\" Drummond later acknowledged.\\" The JAMs offered what they claimed were \\"the last five\\" copies of 1987 for sale at ¬£1000 each in a full-page advertisement in the April 1988 edition of The Face.KLF Communications, advertisement, The Face, April 1988. Drummond argued that the offer exploited a loophole in The JAMs' agreement with the MCPS: \\"We were browsing around this record shop and came across these five copies of 1987.... We made it perfectly clear to the MCPS that we couldn't actually force the shops to send our LPs back.... [B]ecause we bought them in a shop, these LPs don't come into the agreement and we can do what we like with them and not break any laws.\\" Critical response Q magazine had mixed reactions to 1987, saying that there are \\"too few ideas being spread too thin\\". The magazine criticised some songs as \\"overlong\\" and questioned the overuse of sampling as \\"the impression of a random hotchpotch\\". Q also unfavourably commented that The JAMs' \\"use of the beatbox is altogether weedy\\". It liked some of its tracks: \\"there are some wickedly amusing ideas and moments of pure poetry in the lyrics while some of the musical juxtapositions are both killingly funny and strong enough to stand repeated listenings\\". A reviewer for Melody Maker found 1987 \\"inspirational\\", and \\"the most exciting, most original record [he'd] heard in years\\". He also argued that: \\"Some snatches [of plagiarised music] rather outstay their welcome, tugging tell-tale glitz away from the clifftop and dangerously close to smug obviousness, but when the blows are kept short, sharp and very bloody, they make anything else you're very likely to hear on the radio dull and desperately humourless.\\" \\"It's easy to dismiss The JAMs frolics as little more than a brightly coloured sideshow to the shabbiest circus in town\\", a later article said, but \\"believe me, it's far more than a gimmick\\". In awarding 1987 the highest rating, a maximum five stars, Sounds‚Äîa publication that offered the duo's work consistent approval‚Äîmused, \\"Taking the sound of the moment (hip hop) as a backbone, 1987 steals sound artefacts from anywhere ... and meshes them together with King Boy's hysterical 'Clydeside' rap method with bewildering effect. ... [Y]ou could call this sampling technology's answer to T. S. Eliot's arch cut up work, The Wasteland. \\" \\"What's so good about The JAMs\\", the magazine said, \\"is the way they are capturing on disc the whole social and musical confusion and instability of 1987 Britain\\". NME's Danny Kelly was not so impressed. He also felt that the record was underdeveloped and The JAMs were not the most skilled of practitioners. \\"Audacity, completely unfounded self-confidence, utter ruthlessness and a fast car will, of course, be useful attributes to the go- ahead noise-pirate of the 90s, but skill, feel, instinct, vision‚Äîy'know, boring old talent‚Äîwill still be bottom line compulsories... it's in these latter commodities that the JAMs seem conspicuously undertooled.\\" Compared to the output of DJ Code Money or Cut Creator (\\"all humour, vibrancy and colour... ‚Äì aerosoled version[s] of The Book of Kells\\") Kelly felt Drummond's efforts to be a \\"glitter-crusted charity Christmas card\\". A later NME item called 1987 \\"the best comment on sampling culture ever made\\". A retrospective review by AllMusic commented that 1987 is \\"a hilarious record\\" filled with \\"comments on music terrorism and [The JAMs'] own unique take on the Run-D.M.C. type of old-school rapping\\"; and The Penguin Price Guide for Record & CD Collectors called 1987 an \\"entirely brilliant example of the art of disc- jockey-as-producer\\". Giving another retrospective review from across the Atlantic, Trouser Press described 1987 as \\"energetic\\" and \\"a loopy dance album that isn't unlike a lot of sampled records, but proceeds from an entirely different cultural understanding.\\" Personnel Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty were responsible for the concept and production of 1987, its lyrics and the TR-808 beatbox rhythms. Drummond provided rap, and an additional rapper introduced as 'Chike' appears on \\"Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)\\" and \\"Rockman Rock (Parts 2 and 3)\\". Duy Khiem contributed lead vocals to \\"M·∫π Ru Con\\", as well as clarinet and tenor sax to \\"Rockman Rock (Parts 2 and 3)\\" and \\"Next\\". Female vocalists on \\"Hey Hey We Are Not The Monkees\\", \\"Rockman Rock (Parts 2 & 3)\\" and \\"All You Need Is Love (106 bpm)\\" are not credited.

The single was released on 16 October 1987, and on 31 October 1987 The JAMs announced that the case with ABBA \\"is now closed\\".News item, Sounds, 31 October 1987 The sleevenotes to \\"1987: The JAMs 45 Edits\\" explain to the purchaser in a rather tongue-in-cheek fashion how to recreate the original 1987 album for themselves: > This record is a version of our now deleted and illegal LP '1987, What The > Fuck Is Going On?' with all of the copyright infringing 'samples' edited > out.

Often the mapping from functions on phase space to operators is called the Weyl transform or Weyl quantization, whereas the inverse mapping, from operators to functions on phase space, is called the Wigner transform. This mapping was originally devised by Hermann Weyl in 1927 in an attempt to map symmetrized classical phase space functions to operators, a procedure known as Weyl quantization. It is now understood that Weyl quantization does not satisfy all the properties one would require for quantization and therefore sometimes yields unphysical answers. On the other hand, some of the nice properties described below suggest that if one seeks a single consistent quantization procedure mapping functions on the classical phase space to operators, the Weyl quantization is the best option. (Groenewold's theorem says that no such map can have all the properties one would ideally like.) Regardless, the Weyl‚ÄìWigner transform is a well-defined integral transform between the phase-space and operator representations, and yields insight into the workings of quantum mechanics. Most importantly, the Wigner quasi-probability distribution is the Wigner transform of the quantum density matrix, and, conversely, the density matrix is the Weyl transform of the Wigner function. In contrast to Weyl's original intentions in seeking a consistent quantization scheme, this map merely amounts to a change of representation within quantum mechanics; it need not connect \\"classical\\" with \\"quantum\\" quantities. For example, the phase-space function may depend explicitly on Planck's constant ƒß, as it does in some familiar cases involving angular momentum. This invertible representation change then allows one to express quantum mechanics in phase space, as was appreciated in the 1940s by Hilbrand J. Groenewold and Jos√© Enrique Moyal. Definition of the Weyl quantization of a general observable The following explains the Weyl transformation on the simplest, two-dimensional Euclidean phase space. Let the coordinates on phase space be , and let be a function defined everywhere on phase space. In what follows, we fix operators P and Q satisfying the canonical commutation relations, such as the usual position and momentum operators in the Schr√∂dinger representation. We assume that the exponentiated operators e^{iaQ} and e^{ibP} constitute an irreducible representation of the Weyl relations, so that the Stone‚Äìvon Neumann theorem (guaranteeing uniqueness of the canonical commutation relations) holds. The basic formula The Weyl transform (or Weyl quantization) of the function is given by the following operator in Hilbert space, Throughout, \\\\hbar is the reduced Planck constant. It is instructive to perform the p and q integrals in the above formula first, which has the effect of computing the ordinary Fourier transform \\\\tilde{f} of the function f, while leaving the operator e^{i(aQ+bP)}. In that case, the Weyl transform can be written as Section 13.3 :\\\\Phi [f] = \\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi)^2}\\\\iint\\\\tilde{f}(a,b)e^{iaQ+ibP}\\\\,da\\\\,db. We may therefore think of the Weyl map as follows: We take the ordinary Fourier transform of the function f(p,q), but then when applying the Fourier inversion formula, we substitute the quantum operators P and Q for the original classical variables p and q, thus obtaining a \\"quantum version of f.\\" A less symmetric form, but handy for applications, is the following, : \\\\Phi [f]= \\\\frac{2}{(2\\\\pi \\\\hbar)^{3/2}}\\\\iint \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\iint\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! dq dp d\\\\tilde{x} d\\\\tilde{p} ~ e^{ \\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} (\\\\tilde {x} \\\\tilde {p} -2(\\\\tilde{p}-p)(\\\\tilde{x}-q))}~ f(q,p) ~ \\\\tilde{x}\\\\rangle\\\\langle \\\\tilde{p}. In the position representation The Weyl map may then also be expressed in terms of the integral kernel matrix elements of this operator, Definition 13.7 : \\\\langle x \\\\Phi [f] y \\\\rangle = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty {\\\\text{d}p\\\\over h} ~e^{ip(x-y)/\\\\hbar}~ f\\\\left({x+y\\\\over2},p\\\\right) . The inverse map The inverse of the above Weyl map is the Wigner map, which takes the operator back to the original phase-space kernel function , If one replaces \\\\Phi[f] in the above expression with an arbitrary operator, the resulting function may depend on Planck's constant , and may well describe quantum-mechanical processes, provided it is properly composed through the star product, below. In turn, the Weyl map of the Wigner map is summarized by Groenewold's formula, :\\\\Phi [f] = h \\\\iint \\\\,da\\\\,db ~e^{iaQ+ibP} \\\\operatorname{Tr} ( e^{-iaQ-ibP} \\\\Phi). The Weyl quantization of polynomial observables While the above formulas give a nice understanding of the Weyl quantization of a very general observable on phase space, they are not very convenient for computing on simple observables, such as those that are polynomials in q and p. In later sections, we will see that on such polynomials, the Weyl quantization represents the totally symmetric ordering of the noncommuting operators Q and P. For example, the Wigner map of the quantum angular-momentum-squared operator L2 is not just the classical angular momentum squared, but it further contains an offset term , which accounts for the nonvanishing angular momentum of the ground-state Bohr orbit. Properties Weyl quantization of polynomials The action of the Weyl quantization on polynomial functions of q and p is completely determined by the following symmetric formula: Proposition 13.3 :(aq+bp)^n\\\\longmapsto (aQ+bP)^n for all complex numbers a and b. From this formula, it is not hard to show that the Weyl quantization on a function of the form q^k p^l gives the average of all possible orderings of k factors of Q and l factors of P. For example, we have :6 p^2 q^2 ~~ \\\\longmapsto ~~ P^2 Q^2 + Q^2 P^2 + PQPQ+PQ^2P+QPQP+QP^2Q. While this result is conceptually natural, it is not convenient for computations when k and l are large. In such cases, we can use instead McCoy's formulaMcCoy, Neal (1932). \\"On the Function in Quantum Mechanics which Corresponds to a Given Function in Classical Mechanics\\", Proc Nat Acad Sci USA 19 674, online . : p^m q^n ~~ \\\\longmapsto ~~ {1 \\\\over 2^n} \\\\sum_{r=0}^{n} {n \\\\choose r} Q^r P^m Q^{n-r}={1 \\\\over 2^m}\\\\sum_{s=0}^{m} {m \\\\choose s} P^s Q^{n}P^{m-s}. This expression gives an apparently different answer for the case of p^2 q^2 from the totally symmetric expression above. There is no contradiction, however, since the canonical commutation relations allow for more than one expression for the same operator. (The reader may find it instructive to use the commutation relations to rewrite the totally symmetric formula for the case of p^2q^2 in terms of the operators P^2Q^2, QP^2Q, and Q^2P^2 and verify the first expression in McCoy's formula with m=n=2.) It is widely thought that the Weyl quantization, among all quantization schemes, comes as close as possible to mapping the Poisson bracket on the classical side to the commutator on the quantum side. (An exact correspondence is impossible, in light of Groenewold's theorem.) For example, Proposition 13.11 :Theorem: If f(q,p) is a polynomial of degree at most 2 and g(q,p) is an arbitrary polynomial, then we have \\\\Phi(\\\\\\\\{f,g\\\\\\\\})=\\\\frac{1}{i\\\\hbar}[\\\\Phi(f),\\\\Phi(g)]. Weyl quantization of general functions * If is a real-valued function, then its Weyl-map image is self-adjoint. * If is an element of Schwartz space, then is trace-class. * More generally, is a densely defined unbounded operator. * The map is one-to- one on the Schwartz space (as a subspace of the square-integrable functions). Deformation quantization Intuitively, a deformation of a mathematical object is a family of the same kind of objects that depend on some parameter(s). Here, it provides rules for how to deform the \\"classical\\" commutative algebra of observables to a quantum non-commutative algebra of observables. The basic setup in deformation theory is to start with an algebraic structure (say a Lie algebra) and ask: Does there exist a one or more parameter(s) family of similar structures, such that for an initial value of the parameter(s) one has the same structure (Lie algebra) one started with? (The oldest illustration of this may be the realization of Eratosthenes in the ancient world that a flat earth was deformable to a spherical earth, with deformation parameter 1/R‚äï.) E.g., one may define a noncommutative torus as a deformation quantization through a ‚òÖ-product to implicitly address all convergence subtleties (usually not addressed in formal deformation quantization). Insofar as the algebra of functions on a space determines the geometry of that space, the study of the star product leads to the study of a non-commutative geometry deformation of that space. In the context of the above flat phase-space example, the star product (Moyal product, actually introduced by Groenewold in 1946), ‚òÖƒß, of a pair of functions in , is specified by :::\\\\Phi [f_1 \\\\star f_2] = \\\\Phi [f_1]\\\\Phi [f_2].\\\\, The star product is not commutative in general, but goes over to the ordinary commutative product of functions in the limit of . As such, it is said to define a deformation of the commutative algebra of . For the Weyl-map example above, the ‚òÖ-product may be written in terms of the Poisson bracket as :f_1 \\\\star f_2 = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {1}{n!} \\\\left(\\\\frac{i\\\\hbar}{2} \\\\right)^n \\\\Pi^n(f_1, f_2). Here, Œ† is the Poisson bivector, an operator defined such that its powers are :\\\\Pi^0(f_1,f_2)=f_1f_2 and :\\\\Pi^1(f_1,f_2)=\\\\\\\\{f_1,f_2\\\\\\\\}= \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_1}{\\\\partial q} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_2}{\\\\partial p} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_1}{\\\\partial p} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_2}{\\\\partial q} ~, where {f1, f2} is the Poisson bracket. More generally, :\\\\Pi^n(f_1,f_2)= \\\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k {n \\\\choose k} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^k }{\\\\partial p^k} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{n-k}}{\\\\partial q^{n-k}} f_1 \\\\right) \\\\times \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{n-k} }{\\\\partial p^{n-k}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^k}{\\\\partial q^k} f_2 \\\\right) where {n \\\\choose k} is the binomial coefficient. Thus, e.g., Gaussians compose hyperbolically, : \\\\exp \\\\left (-{a } (q^2+p^2)\\\\right ) ~ \\\\star ~ \\\\exp \\\\left (-{b} (q^2+p^2)\\\\right ) = {1\\\\over 1+\\\\hbar^2 ab} \\\\exp \\\\left (-{a+b\\\\over 1+\\\\hbar^2 ab} (q^2+p^2)\\\\right ) , or : \\\\delta (q) ~ \\\\star ~ \\\\delta(p) = {2\\\\over h} \\\\exp \\\\left (2i{qp\\\\over\\\\hbar}\\\\right ) , etc. These formulas are predicated on coordinates in which the Poisson bivector is constant (plain flat Poisson brackets). For the general formula on arbitrary Poisson manifolds, cf. the Kontsevich quantization formula. Antisymmetrization of this ‚òÖ-product yields the Moyal bracket, the proper quantum deformation of the Poisson bracket, and the phase-space isomorph (Wigner transform) of the quantum commutator in the more usual Hilbert-space formulation of quantum mechanics. As such, it provides the cornerstone of the dynamical equations of observables in this phase-space formulation. There results a complete phase space formulation of quantum mechanics, completely equivalent to the Hilbert- space operator representation, with star-multiplications paralleling operator multiplications isomorphically. Expectation values in phase-space quantization are obtained isomorphically to tracing operator observables with the density matrix in Hilbert space: they are obtained by phase-space integrals of observables such as the above with the Wigner quasi-probability distribution effectively serving as a measure. Thus, by expressing quantum mechanics in phase space (the same ambit as for classical mechanics), the above Weyl map facilitates recognition of quantum mechanics as a deformation (generalization, cf. correspondence principle) of classical mechanics, with deformation parameter . (Other familiar deformations in physics involve the deformation of classical Newtonian into relativistic mechanics, with deformation parameter v/c; or the deformation of Newtonian gravity into General Relativity, with deformation parameter Schwarzschild-radius/characteristic-dimension. Conversely, group contraction leads to the vanishing-parameter undeformed theories‚Äîclassical limits.) Classical expressions, observables, and operations (such as Poisson brackets) are modified by -dependent quantum corrections, as the conventional commutative multiplication applying in classical mechanics is generalized to the noncommutative star-multiplication characterizing quantum mechanics and underlying its uncertainty principle. Despite its name, Deformation Quantization does not constitute a successful quantization scheme, namely a method to produce a quantum theory out of a classical one. It amounts to a mere representation change from Hilbert space to phase space. Generalizations In more generality, Weyl quantization is studied in cases where the phase space is a symplectic manifold, or possibly a Poisson manifold. Related structures include the Poisson‚ÄìLie groups and Kac‚ÄìMoody algebras.

The school is named for Sir John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada and a Father of Confederation and Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the first French-Canadian Prime Minister of Canada. Formerly part of La Commission Scolaire J√©r√¥me-Le Royer, the school has been part of the English Montreal School Board since 1998. Both its male and female sports teams compete as the Rams. Enrolment is slightly over 800 students in Secondary III, IV and V. Luigi Santamaria is the current principal of Laurier Macdonald High School. Nicholas Romano and Cynthia Canale are the two vice- principals. The school has two full-time guidance counsellors and a nurse. The school colours are orange and black. Traditional uniform colours are white and grey. The motto is Finis Coronat Opus (Latin for \\"The end crowns the work\\"). History Laurier Macdonald opened in September 1969 without a building. The new school was to serve the English-speaking Catholic population of the City of Saint-L√©onard. While an older building at 5750 Metropolitan Autoroute (A-40) originally built as a factory was being converted into a high school, the Commission Scolaire J√©r√¥me-Le Royer rented classrooms at a nearby Protestant school (Dunton High School) so that students could attend classes during the late afternoon and early evening. This arrangement ended in early 1970 when the Metropolitan Autoroute facility was ready. Within a few years, however, the old building's limitations were judged to be too serious, in spite of the renovations, and the school board began discussing the construction of a new building in earnest. The changing political climate in the province proved to be a problem, however. The Parti Qu√©b√©cois government had declared a moratorium on the construction of English schools shortly after its accession to power in the fall of 1976. A student strike was organized in the month of November 1973, led by a rebellious student named Frank Fazzari, to bring to the public‚Äôs attention the harm caused by the treatment of all English speaking schools in the eastern part of Montreal. The strike by students was the answer to the school being neglected by the Jerome le Royer School Board. An overpopulated school with the capacity of 800 students was being attended by 1200 students. The school was in complete disarray with one janitor to maintain the facilities, with no washroom facilities operational, doors with no locks, holes in cinder block walls, shortage of classrooms, and unsanitary conditions. Needless to say the facilities were not the ideal setting for teachers and students vying for the ultimate goal of a proper education. The walkout was well documented in the English media along with the French media . A front-page article in the now defunct Montreal Star depicted the story of neglect with a picture of Frank Fazzari holding up one broken sink in the washroom as a symbol of defiance towards the neglect of English speaking students had to endure. As this was happening, the J√©r√¥me Le Royer School Board had just completed, in 1969, the most advanced comprehensive French speaking high school on the territory of Saint-L√©onard, Antoine de St- Exup√©ry, while Laurier Macdonald was nothing more than a school in rented facilities. This was much to the dismay of the population of Saint-L√©onard's English speaking parents and students. The only positive benefit of the new Antoine de St-Exup√©ry French high school was that the building formerly used to house French-speaking students was liberated. The Aim√© Renaud building (also a rented building on Metropolitan) became a junior English High School to feed Laurier Macdonald. This greatly alleviated the overcrowding at Laurier Macdonald. Aime Renaud High School was used as a junior high for Secondary I and II while Laurier Macdonald was used for Secondary III, IV and V. The media pressure and exposure prompted a quick reaction from the school board with a meeting with the student council who presented a petition on behalf of the students with the demands that their school be equipped with the maintenance and the proper equipment to operate a school burdened by overpopulation. The board‚Äôs reaction was a temporary closing of the school for one week and much to the dismay of all the members at the school board, they managed to repair, paint and fix all the anomalies. in the school. The media was invited to see all the repairs. This spurred the quest to build a school that would match the comprehensive high school of the French-speaking community. It is the belief of many that attended the first years at the Metropolitan facilities that their determination was to be the voice of defiance that led to the awakening of the necessity for better school facilities. A debt of gratitude is owed to Joseph Lalla for directing the students on the eve of the strike, with the use of his political savviness and knowledge of using the media as a propaganda tool and the use of his telephone in his office to contact the media. The school board then decided to extend a small elementary school, √âcole Sir George-√âtienne-Cartier, at the corner of Jean-Talon and Viau streets. The project would not have been approved by the provincial Department of Education had it been presented otherwise. The new (and current building) opened for the 1983‚Äì4 school year. Roussin Academy in Pointe-aux-Trembles was closed and the students were transferred to the new Laurier Macdonald for the 1983‚Äì4 school year. Laurier Macdonald was a comprehensive high school from 1983 (or in French, √©cole polyvalente) until that distinction was abolished provincially in the early 1990s. These schools offered high school students the possibility of vocational training in the last cycle of secondary education. Today, the school is the only remaining English-language senior high school on the island of Montreal, serving only Secondary III, IV and V students. It has been non- confessional since the school board reorganization of 1998. Previously, public schools in the province of Quebec had been organized along confessional lines (Protestant or Catholic) instead of linguistic lines (English or French). Past staff and alumni Louis Balena served as the second principal of Laurier Macdonald, succeeding Miss T. Arbour, from the early 1970s until the late 1980s. Frank Vatrano and Tony Cambria succeeded him but both had short tenures, with Vatrano passing away shortly after becoming principal. Renzo Orsi (1991‚Äì1993) followed. He organized the Honours Plus Programme, the forerunner of today's IB Programme, and supported the expansion of the school's Communication Arts programme. Other principals included Joseph Lalla (1993‚Äì1996), Mario Tirelli (1996‚Äì2000), Pasquale Buttino(2000‚Äì2007), Eileen Kelly (2007‚Äì2011) and Luigi Santamaria (2011-present) Notable graduates of Laurier Macdonald include multiple, award-winning IMAX producer and filmmaker Pietro L.

The school named its pastoral centre (now referred to as the Spiritual and Community Life Centre) after Father Gagn√©, a former pastoral animator at Laurier Macdonald, its sports complex after Canadian runner and activist, Terry Fox, its auditorium after Ralph Iadeluca, a former school commissioner at J√©r√¥me-Le Royer, and one of its lounges after Marguerite McKee, a former French teacher. All designations were made posthumously. Laurier Macdonald High School is one of the few public high schools in the Montreal area to have an alumni association. It was founded by Francis Scardera (Class of 84) and is a registered non-profit association. The association helps organize 10, 20, and 25 year reunions. All proceeds go to special projects in the school. The association has a web site. Alumni can register their email addresses on the web site. Facebook groups are created for reunions as needed. Today The reorganization of the school boards in 1998 opened up Laurier Macdonald to students from throughout the Island of Montreal, allowing anyone who lives (roughly) east of the D√©carie Autoroute (A-15) to attend. Nevertheless, most students still come from Saint-L√©onard and Anjou, with significant numbers from Rivi√®re-des-Prairies, Laval and Montr√©al-Nord. The student body is overwhelmingly Italian, Catholic and middle-class, reflecting the generally homogeneous make-up of Saint-L√©onard's English-speaking population. John Paul I Junior High School (secondary I and II) is the main feeder school for Laurier Macdonald. The English elementary schools of St. Leonard (Dante, Honor√©-Mercier, Pierre-de-Coubertin and General Vanier) are the main feeder schools for John Paul I Junior High School. Laurier Macdonald is not a 240 school (named for the corresponding section of the provincial Education Act) and therefore accepts any student eligible by law to receive English instruction in a Quebec public school. While the school's performance in the controversial Fraser Institute rankings has improved slowly over the past several years, Principal Pasquale Buttino commented in local newspapers in 2005 that he felt the school's academic record was being misrepresented. Buttino observed that Laurier Macdonald has always boasted a graduation rate of over ninety percent since it opened in 1969 and that many avant-garde projects, specifically those of the Communication Arts department, are not considered by the Fraser Institute during the preparation of school rankings.  Athletics  Laurier Macdonald was traditionally strong in basketball and football. During the 1980s, the school also won titles in swimming and volleyball. Since the 1990s, the school's strongest showings, including several championships, have been in soccer, track and field and flag football. During the 2003 outdoor season a milestone was achieved when Coach Sam Longo led both the senior and junior men's team to the GMAA championships. This achievement was displayed in The Montreal Gazette. Greats from the senior teams included Brian Ceterina, goalie. Several players from the squad have played for Quebec's provincial team including Massimo Di Ioia who currently plays for The Canadian U20 national team and has signed a pro contract with the Montreal Impact for the 2007 season. He led the team in scoring with an outstanding 27 goals in 12 regular season games and was named MVP for the men's soccer team. Many of the championship teams are honoured with mosaics in the school's sports complex. Championship banners hang in the gymnasium...  Publications  The school regularly published several newspapers and magazines until they were all discontinued over the past several years. OPUS, a quarterly school newspaper, won the Montreal Gazette's award for excellence in student journalism several times during the 1990s. Circulation peaked at over 5000 copies when the newspaper was distributed not only to students at Laurier Macdonald but also to those at its feeder schools in Saint-L√©onard, Anjou and Pointe-aux- Trembles. Other publications included: Inkblot (student artwork), the Laureate (student creative writing and poetry), Mediascape (student photography) and Wrap-Up, a daily school newsletter. The Communication Arts department at Laurier Macdonald has become especially renowned over the past several years for its innovative curriculum. Students have published award-winning books on the Canadian immigrant experience which have received praise both at home and abroad.  Laurier Macdonald RadioClub Radio Laurier Macdonald began regular broadcasts in May 2006. The station broadcasts throughout the campus via carrier current on 560 AM. Radio RUNTS existed in the old Laurier Macdonald on Metropolitan. It was a 15-minute radio show that was broadcast over the intercom system once every 2 weeks at the end of the last period on Friday afternoons. When the move was made to new building, it became a lunchtime broadcast in the cafeteria. In 2007 it was re-opened by former students; Gino Gentile, Michele Infante and Giuseppe Baldino until their graduating year of 2008. Unfortunately, the lack of funds and neglect of equipment caused it to forgotten and left behind ever since.

She was named after the Yura River near Kyoto, Japan. She served in the early stages of World War II, and was the first Japanese light cruiser to be lost in that conflict. Background Following the production of the five s, an additional three 5,500-ton class light cruisers authorized under the 8-4 Fleet Program were ordered by the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1920. Due to minor changes in design, primarily due to advances in torpedo technology, these three vessels were initially designated as \\"modified Kuma-class\\", or \\"5500-ton class Type II\\", before being re-designated as a separate class named after the lead vessel, . A second set of three vessels was authorized in late 1920.Stille, Imperial Japanese Navy Light Cruisers 1941-45 , page 22-26; Design The Nagara-class vessels were essentially identical to the previous Kuma-class cruisers, retaining the same hull design, engines and main weaponry, with the addition of the new 610 mm Type 93 Long Lance Torpedoes, which required a larger launcher.Gardner, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906‚Äì1921; page 238 However, in silhouette, a major difference from the Kuma class was in the configuration of the bridge, which incorporated an aircraft hangar. Initially, a 33-foot platform was mounted above the No.2 turret, extending over the forward superstructure below the bridge. This was later replaced by an aircraft catapult. Even so, the arrangement proved unwieldy, and the catapult was moved to the rear of each ship in the class, between the No.5 and No.6 turrets during retrofits in 1929‚Äì1934. Service career Early career Yura was laid down on 21 May 1921, launched on 15 February 1922 and completed at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal on 20 March 1923. She was commanded by Captain Soemu Toyoda from November 1926 to November 1927. In 1930, she served as a test platform for aircraft catapults installed in front of her bridge and, in 1933-34 received a rotating catapult amidships as well as a new mainmast to support an aircraft derrick. Following the Manchurian Incident, Yura was deployed to Shanghai in early 1932 under the command of Captain Mataro Tanimoto until December 1932, and by Captain Rokuz≈ç Sugiyama from June to November 1933. She was again deployed between 1937‚Äì1939, to cover landings of Japanese troops in northern China. CombinedFleet.com: Yura Tabular Record of Movement; Early stages of the Pacific War On 1 September 1941, Yura was appointed flagship of Rear Admiral Daigo Tadashige's Submarine Squadron 5 and was based in Hainan. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Yura was covering the first wave of the Malaya Invasion Force south of the Cape of Camau, French Indochina. On 9 December 1941, Yura and her squadron were ordered to pursue and sink the Royal Navy \\"Force Z\\" (the battleship , battlecruiser and supporting destroyers). Although Yura received word from the submarine that the British ships were spotted, due to poor wireless reception, the location was unclear and the British vessels were overwhelmed by torpedo bombers of the IJN 22nd Air Flotilla from bases in Indochina before Yura and her submarines could take action.Dull, A Battle History Imperial Japanese Navy , page 40; Yura was then assigned to the invasion of Sarawak from 13 ‚Äì 26 December 1941, covering landings in Brunei, Miri, Seria, and Kuching. The 2,500 men of the \\"Kawaguchi Detachment\\" and the No. 2 Yokosuka Special Naval Landing Force (SNLF) quickly captured Miri's airfield and oil fields. The operation was completed, and Yura returned to its base at Camranh Bay, Indochina by the end of the year. In February, Yura was assigned to Vice Admiral Ib≈ç Takahashi's IJN Third Fleet, to cover the invasion of Sumatra, protecting the landings of troops at Palembang, Banka Island, and Bantam Bay and Merak on Java. On 1 March 1942, the Dutch submarine made visual contact with Yura and attacked, launching two torpedoes from 2500‚Äì3000 meters, but both either missed or were duds. The Japanese made six depth charge attacks, dropping about 25 depth charges, but K XIV survived and escaped via Sunda Strait to Colombo, Ceylon. On 4 March, Yura rescued the crew of the tanker Erimo (sunk by the submarine ). On 6 March, Yura was assigned to the No. 1 Escort Unit, and continued to cover troop landings in Sumatra and the Andaman Islands through the end of the month. Indian Ocean Raids In April, Yura was assigned to the raids in the Indian Ocean under Vice Admiral Jisabur≈ç Ozawa's Second Expeditionary Fleet. Yura, accompanied by the destroyers , , , and , departed Mergui and steamed into the Bay of Bengal with the cruisers and , , and and the light carrier to attack Allied merchant shipping. On 6 April 1942, east of Kalingapatnam in the Bay of Bengal Yura and Y≈´giri sank the Dutch merchant vessel Batavia en route from Calcutta to Karachi. Yura and Y≈´giri also sank the Dutch motorship Banjoewangi and the British steamer Taksang. At the end of April, Yura returned to Sasebo Naval Arsenal for a refit. Battle of Midway On 10 May 1942, Yura was made flagship of Rear Admiral Sh≈çji Nishimura's 4th Destroyer Squadron. At the Battle of Midway, the squadron also included Captain Ranji Oe's 3rd Destroyer Division of 4 destroyers and Captain Yasuo Sat≈ç's 9th Destroyer Division of 3 destroyers. The 4th Destroyer Squadron was under the overall command of Vice Admiral Nobutake Kond≈ç, but did not see combat at Midway. Solomon Islands Campaigns On 7 August 1942 the United States began \\"Operation Watchtower\\" to retake Guadalcanal and the Solomon Islands. Yura was dispatched to Truk with Vice Admiral Kond≈ç's IJN Second Fleet to begin reinforcement operations, and was thus at the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24 August 1942. Although the light carrier Ry≈´j≈ç was sunk and was damaged, Yura emerged unscathed, and returned to Truk on 5 September 1942. For the remainder of September 1942, Yura patrolled between Truk, Guadalcanal and the Shortland Islands. On 25 September 1942, while at Shortland, she was attacked by two Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers of the USAAF 11th Bomb Group based at Espiritu Santo and was slightly damaged. On 11 October 1942, the submarine claimed a torpedo hit forward of Yuras bridge that inflicted minor damage, but postwar analysis failed to confirm this attack and Yura was apparently not damaged this day. On 12 October 1942, Yura departed Shortland to escort the seaplane tender and Chitose returning from a transport run from Guadalcanal, and on 14 October 1942, Yura assisted in landing 1,100 troops on Cape Esperance, Guadalcanal. Another \\"Tokyo Express\\" troop transport run to Guadalcanal was made on 17 October 1942 to carry 2,100 troops, field artillery pieces and anti-tank guns. On 18 October 1942, en route back to Shortland, Yura was attacked by the submarine off Choiseul Island. Grampus fired four Mark 14 Torpedoes at Yura. One hit but did not explode, and Yura departed the area with a dent in her port side. On 24 October 1942, Yura departed Shortland to bombard Guadalcanal with the No. 2 Attack Unit consisting of Rear Admiral Tamotsu Takama's flagship , , and . At the north entrance to Indispensable Strait, off Guadalcanal, on 25 October 1942 (the day before the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands), Yura, leading an attack group of destroyers off Santa Isabel Island in the Solomons was attacked by five SBD Dauntless dive-bombers of VS-71 and hit aft by two bombs near the engine room. She flooded and settled by the stern. After receiving reports of the attack, Vice Admiral Mikawa, CINC, IJN Eighth Fleet, cancelled Rear Admiral Takama's bombardment mission. The No. 2 Attack Unit reversed course back towards Shortland. On the way back, Yura was attacked again by three USAAF P-39 Airacobras and by four Marine SBDs, but these attacks failed to cause any additional damage. Captain Shiro Sato attempted to beach Yura but she was attacked again by four SBDs, three F4F Wildcats and four P-39s. Soon afterwards, Yura was attacked again by six USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress bombers from Espiritu Santo. These attacks reignited Yuras fires. At 18:30, after her crew was taken off, Japanese destroyers Harusame and Y≈´dachi scuttled Yura with torpedoes. She broke in two and her forward portion sank. At 19:00, her stern portion was sunk off Savo Island by gunfire from Yudachi at . Yura was removed from the navy list on 20 November 1942.

This activity is caused by matter flowing onto a 65 million solar mass () supermassive black hole at the core. Morphologically, this is an unbarred lenticular galaxy with tightly-wound spiral arms, while shell and tidal tail features suggest that it has undergone a cosmologically-recent merger or interaction event. NGC 5548 is approximately 245 million light years away and appears in the constellation Bo√∂tes. The apparent visual magnitude of NGC 5548 is approximately 13.3 in the V band. In 1943, this galaxy was one of twelve nebulae listed by American astronomer Carl Keenan Seyfert that showed broad emission lines in their nuclei. Members of this class of objects became known as Seyfert galaxies, and they were noted to have a higher than normal surface brightness in their nuclei. Observation of NGC 5548 during the 1960s with radio telescopes showed an enhanced level of radio emission. Spectrograms of the nucleus made in 1966 showed that the energized region was confined to a volume a few parsecs across, where temperature were around and the plasma had a dispersion velocity of ¬±450 km/s. Among astronomers, the accepted explanation for the active nucleus in NGC 5548 is the accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the core. This object is surrounded by an orbiting disk of accreted matter drawn in from the surroundings. As material is drawn into the outer parts of this disk, it becomes photoionized, producing broad emission lines in the optical and ultraviolet bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. A wind of ionized matter, organized in filamentary structures at distances of 1‚Äì14 light days from the center, is flowing outward in the direction perpendicular to the accretion disk plane. The mass of the central black hole can be estimated based on the properties of the emission lines in the core region. Combined measurements yield an estimated mass of . In other words, it is some 65 million times the mass of the Sun. This result is consistent with other methods of estimating the mass of the SMBH in the nucleus of NGC 5548. Matter is falling onto this black hole at the estimated rate of per year, whereas mass is flowing outward from the core at or above the rate of each year. The inner part of the accretion disk surrounding the SMBH forms a thick, hot corona spanning several light hours that is emitting X-rays. When this radiation reaches the optically thick part of the accretion disk at a radius of around 1‚Äì2 light days, the X-rays are converted into heat.

The plant was discovered by Burbidge on an expedition in Borneo. Frederick William Thomas Burbidge (1847 in Wymeswold, Leicestershire, England ‚Äì 1905 in Dublin, Ireland) was a British explorer who collected many rare tropical plants for the famous Veitch Nurseries. Biography Burbidge was born at Wymeswold, Leicestershire, on 21 March 1847, was son of Thomas Burbidge, a farmer and fruit-grower. Burbridge entered the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society at Chiswick as a student in 1868, and proceeded in the same year to the Royal Gardens, Kew. Here he showed skill as a draughtsman and was partly employed in making drawings of plants in the herbarium. Leaving Kew in 1870, he was on the staff of the Garden from that year until 1877. In 1877 Burbidge was sent by Messrs. Veitch as a collector to Borneo. He was absent two years, during which he also visited Johore, Brunei, and the Sulu Islands. He brought back to Great Britain many remarkable plants, especially: *pitcher plants, such as \\"Nepenthes rajah\\" and \\"N. bicalcarata\\"; *orchids, such as \\"Cypripedium laurenceanum\\", \\"Dendrobium burbidgei\\" and \\"Aerides burbidgei\\"; *ferns, such as \\"Alsophila burbidgei\\" and \\"Polypodium burbidgei\\". The first set of the dried specimens brought back by Burbidge numbered nearly a thousand species, and was presented by Messrs. Veitch to the Kew herbarium. Sir Joseph Hooker in describing the Scitamineous \\"Burbidgea nitida\\" names it: In 1880 Burbidge was appointed curator of the botanical gardens of Trinity College, Dublin, at Glasnevin. There he did much to encourage gardening in Ireland. cites Gardeners' Chronicle, 1901, ii. 460. In 1889 Dublin University conferred on him the honorary degree of M.A., and in 1894 he became keeper of the college park as well as curator of the botanical gardens. On the establishment of the Victoria Medal of Honour by the Royal Horticultural Society, in 1897, Burbidge was one of the first recipients, and he was also a member of the Royal Irish Academy. He died from heart-disease on Christmas Eve 1905, and was buried in Dublin. Burbidge is commemorated in the name of the genus Burbidgea (Hook.f.) and several species including Globba burbidgei (Ridl.). Nepenthes burbidgeae (Hook.f. ex Burb.) is thought to be named after his wife. In the opinion of Frederick Corder the author of his biography in the Dictionary of National Biography (DNB) \\"Although no scientific botanist, nor very skilful as a cultivator, Burbidge did admirable service as a horticultural writer\\". Family Burbidge married in 1876 Mary Wade, who died, six months before him. They had no children.  Works  During his period at Kew and working on the Gardener Burbidge published: * The Art of Botanical Drawing (1872); * Cool Orchids and how to grow them, with a Descriptive List of all the Best Species (1874); * Domestic Floriculture, Window Gardening and Floral Decorations (1874) ‚Äî Which according to Frederic Corder (1912, his biographer in the DNB) was one of the best books of the kind; * [The Narcissus: its History and Culture (1875), with coloured plates drawn by himself and a scientific review of the genus by Mr. John Gilbert Baker; * The volume on \\"Horticulture\\" (1877) in G.

A mess of pottage is something immediately attractive but of little value taken foolishly and carelessly in exchange for something more distant and perhaps less tangible but immensely more valuable. The phrase alludes to Esau's sale of his birthright for a meal (\\"mess\\") of lentil stew (\\"pottage\\") in and connotes shortsightedness and misplaced priorities. The mess of pottage motif is a common theme in art, appearing for example in Mattia Bortoloni's Esau selling his birthright (1716) and Mattias Stomer's painting of the same title (c. 1640).See Old Testament figures in art, by Chiara de Capoa, ed. by Stefano Zuffi, tr. by Thomas Michael Hartmann (Los Angeles : Getty Museum, 2003), pp. 111-112. Biblical usage Although this phrase is often used to describe or allude to Esau's bargain, the phrase itself does not appear in the text of any English version of Genesis. Its first attested use,See Middle English Dictionary s.v. \\"mes n.\\" already associated with Esau's bargain, is in the English summary of one of John Capgrave's sermons, c. 1452, \\"[Jacob] supplanted his bro√æir, bying his fader blessing for a mese of potage.\\"John capgrave, \\"A Treatise of the Orders under the Rule of St. Augustine,\\" in John Capgrave's Lives of St. Augustine and St. Gilbert..., ed. by J. J. Munro, EETS 140 (London, 1910), p. 145. In the sixteenth century it continues its association with Esau, appearing in Bonde's Pylgrimage of Perfection (1526) and in the English versions of two influential works by Erasmus, the Enchiridion (1533)Desiderius Erasmus, A booke called in latyn Enchiridion militis christiani, and in englysshe the manuell of the christen knyght, (London : Wynkyn de Worde, 1533). and the Paraphrase upon the New Testament (1548):Desiderius Erasmus, The first tome or volume of the Paraphrase of Erasmus vpon the Newe Testamente [s.v. Luke, chap. 4] (London : Edward Whitchurche, 1548) \\"th'enherytaunce of the elder brother solde for a messe of potage\\". It can be found here and there throughout the sixteenth century, e.g. in Johan Carion's Thre bokes of cronicles (1550)The thre bokes of cronicles, whyche Iohn Carion ... gathered wyth great diligence of the beste authours (London, 1550). and at least three times in Roger Edgeworth's collected sermons (1557).Sermons very fruitfull, godly, and learned, preached and sette foorth by Maister Roger Edgeworth (London, 1557): \\"Esau...for a messe of potage sold his first frutes.\\" Within the tradition of English Biblical translations, it appears first in the summary at the beginning of chapter 25 of the Book of Genesis in the so-called Matthew Bible of 1537 (in this section otherwise a reprint of the Pentateuch translation of William Tyndale), \\"Esau selleth his byrthright for a messe of potage\\";Matthew's Bible : a facsimile of the 1537 edition, (Peabody, MA : Hendrickson, 2009). thence in the 1539 Great Bible and in the Geneva Bible published by English Protestants in Geneva in 1560.The Geneva Bible : a facsimile of the 1560 edition (Peabody, MA : Hendrickson, 2007). According to the OED, Coverdale (1535) \\"does not use the phrase, either in the text or the chapter heading..., but he has it in 1 Chronicles 16:3 and Proverbs 15:7.\\", OED DRAFT REVISION Dec. 2009, s.v. mess n.(1), sense 2. Miles Smith used the same phrase in \\"The Translators to the Reader\\", the lengthy preface to the 1611 King James Bible, but by the seventeenth century the phrase had become very widespread indeed and had clearly achieved the status of a fixed phrase with allusive, quasi-proverbial, force.  Examples of usage  In different literary hands, it could be used either earnestly, or mockingly.See A Dictionary of Biblical tradition in English Literature, ed. by David Lyle Jeffrey (Grand Rapids : Eerdmans, 1992), s.v. \\"birthright.\\" Benjamin Keach (1689) falls into the former camp: \\"I know not.. / whether those who did our Rights betray, / And for a mess of Pottage, sold away / Our dear bought / Freedoms, shall now trusted be, / As Conservators of our Libertie.\\"Benjamin Keach, Distressed Sion Relieved (London, 1689), line 3300. As does Henry Ellison (1875) \\"O Faith .. The disbelieving world would sell thee so; / Head turned with sophistries, and heart grown cold, / For a vile mess of pottage it would throw / Away thy heritage, and count the gold!\\".Henry Ellison \\"Skepticism\\" in Stones from the Quarry (1875). Karl Marx' lament in Das Kapital has been translated using this phrase: The worker \\"is compelled by social conditions, to sell the whole of his active life, his very capacity for labour, in return for the price of his customary means of subsistence, to sell his birthright for a mess of pottage.\\"Das Kapital, Volume One, Part III, Chapter \\"The Working Day\\". The original German text has ein Gericht Linsen, which literally means \\"a lentil dish\\". Esau and the Mess of Pottage, by Jan Victors. Swift and Byron use the phrase satirically: \\"Thou sold'st thy birthright, Esau! for a mess / Thou shouldst have gotten more, or eaten less.\\"Byron, \\"The Age of Bronze,\\" lines 632-3\\\\. Cp. Jonathan Swift, \\"Robin and Harry,\\" line 36: \\"Robin ... swears he could get her in an hour, / If Gaffer Harry would endow her; / And sell, to pacify his wrath, / A birth-right for a mess of broth.\\" The Hindu nationalist V. D. Savarkar borrowed the phrase, along with quotations from Shakespeare, for his pamphlet Hindutva (1923), which celebrated Hindu culture and identity, asking whether Indians were willing to 'disown their seed, forswear their fathers and sell their birthright for a mess of pottage'. Perhaps the most famous use in American literature is that by Henry David Thoreau: \\"Perhaps I am more than usually jealous with respect to my freedom. I feel that my connection with and obligation to society are still very slight and transient. Those slight labors which afford me a livelihood, and by which it is allowed that I am to some extent serviceable to my contemporaries, are as yet commonly a pleasure to me, and I am not often reminded that they are a necessity. So far I am successful. But I foresee that if my wants should be much increased, the labor required to supply them would become a drudgery. If I should sell both my forenoons and afternoons to society, as most appear to do, I am sure that for me there would be nothing left worth living for. I trust that I shall never thus sell my birthright for a mess of pottage. I wish to suggest that a man may be very industrious, and yet not spend his time well. There is no more fatal blunderer than he who consumes the greater part of his life getting his living.\\"Thoreau, Henry David, Life without principle (1854) Another prominent instance of using the phrase in American fiction is James Weldon Johnson's famous protagonist Ex-Coloured Man who, retrospectively reflecting upon his life as a black man passing for white, concludes that he has sold his \\"birthright for a mess of pottage\\".James Weldon Johnson, The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man (New York, 1989), p. 211. By a conventional spoonerism, an overly propagandistic writer is said to have \\"sold his birthright for a pot of message.\\" Terry Pratchett has his character Sergeant Colon say this in Feet of Clay, after Nobby of the Watch has guessed that the phrase is ‚Äúa spot of massage.‚Äù Theodore Sturgeon had one of his characters say this about H. G. Wells in his 1948 short story Unite and Conquer; but Roger Lancelyn Green (in 1962) ascribed it to Professor Nevill Coghill, Merton Professor of English Literature at the University of Oxford. The phrase also appears in Myra Brooks Welch's poem \\"The Touch of the Master's Hand,\\" in which \\"a mess of pottage ‚Äî a glass of wine ‚Äî a game\\" stand for all such petty worldly pursuits, contrasted to life after a spiritual awakening. The phrase also appears in the 1919 African-American film Within Our Gates, as used by the preacher character 'Old Ned' who having ingratiated himself by acting the clown with two white men turns away and states, \\"again, I've sold my birthright. All for a miserable mess of pottage.\\" Notes  External links  * Translators to the Reader Category:Figures of speech Category:Biblical phrases ","title":"Mess of pottage"},{"id":"4277208","text":"A season premiere is the first episode of a new season of an established television show.

He was a New Brunswick alderman and an associate of John Adams and author Thomas Paine.http://www.newbrunswick.com/content.php?content=history_block#6 It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 24, 1976. Henry Guest, who operated a tannery, bought two and a half acres on the corner of Livingston Avenue and Carroll Place (New Street) in 1755. He built a sandstone house five years later and lived there with his family until his death in 1815. Henry Guest said, \\"If his descendants would only keep a roof on it, the house would stand till Gabriel blew his trumpet.\\" In an 1817 sales advertisement the building was described as \\"one of the best stone houses in the State of New Jersey.\\" By the 20th century the house was threatened with demolition, and in 1924, it was moved up Livingston Avenue next to the New Brunswick Free Public Library. Over time, the roof and other parts of the building deteriorated. In 1992, the city and the New Jersey Historic Trust funded a major exterior renovation. A new roof, repointing of the mortar, and other repairs prevented further decay and today the Guest House is mostly used for meeting rooms.

Peterson landed a role as Susie, the coffee shop waitress on The Bill Dana Show, another spin-off from The Danny Thomas Show, which aired from September 1963 to January 1965. Peterson grew up in a musical family. While growing up in Colorado, she has said her earliest memories were of music. Peterson, her brother Jim and two of Jim's friends formed a small group called the Ja-Da Quartet. They would ride around in the back of a pickup truck singing to people. In 1954 at a Capitol Records convention, Dick Linke (manager of Andy Griffith and Jim Nabors) heard Peterson singing and was so impressed with her, he encouraged her to come to New York. So in 1958 after graduating high school Maggie and the group did just that. They landed a number of stints on the Perry Como Show and the Pat Boone Show, and in 1959 they released their album \\"It's the Most Happy Sound.\\" Soon after, the band broke up and went back home. A short time later, Peterson joined another group, The Ernie Mariani Trio (later renamed Margaret Ann and the Ernie Mariani Trio). The group traveled for several years and had stints in resort areas such as Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe and Reno, where Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack were often seen in the audience while Maggie performed. It was while she was on tour that Maggie was discovered by The Andy Griffith Show director Bob Sweeny and producer Aaron Ruben. For The Andy Griffith Show, Peterson initially read for the role of love interest for Sheriff Andy Taylor, but the role went to Elinor Donahue (Ellie Walker). Soon after, she was selected to play the role of Charlene Darling. The only daughter of Briscoe Darling, she had a crush on Sheriff Taylor (\\"Pa, can't I just look at the pretty man?\\"). Peterson would later return to The Andy Griffith Show in its final season, in A Girl For Goober, as Doris who was the dating interest to Ken Berry's character. The Darlings, including Briscoe's four boys (played by The Dillards bluegrass band), lived in the mountains and came to town on many occasions. When in town, they enjoyed playing music with Andy. One of Charlene's favorite songs is \\"Salty Dog.\\" The ones that made her cry were \\"Slimy River Bottom,\\" \\"Boil that Cabbage Down\\" and \\"Keep Your Money in Your Shoes and it Won't Get Wet.\\" Ernest T. Bass had his eyes on Charlene and believed he had courting rights because her marriage to Dud Wash had been performed by Sheriff Andy Taylor acting as a justice of the peace. He tried to steal her away on the day they were to be remarried by a preacher. Threatening the gathering with a high-powered rifle, he runs off with the fully veiled \\"bride.\\" While Charlene and Dud are hurriedly married by the preacher, Ernest T. discovers the person in the veil is really Barney Fife. Charlene and Dud had a daughter together, Andilina. They tried to betroth Andilina to Opie as it was customary in their family. Briscoe called off the engagement of Opie and Andilina when he discovered there was witchery in the Taylor family. According to Jim Clark of The Andy Griffith Show Rerun Watchers Club, the three songs on which Charlene performed on the show can be found on the album Songs That Make Me Cry. In 1968, while she was singing as an opening act for Andy Griffith at a casino in Lake Tahoe, Peterson met jazz musician Gus Mancuso who was playing bass in a lounge act. The two married and have been together ever since. The couple spent a number of years in Los Angeles, where Peterson worked doing commercials, until they decided to settle in Las Vegas where Maggie now works as a location scout for film and television. In April 2008 The Darlings received a star on the Missouri Walk of Fame in Marshfield, Missouri. Peterson and Darlings/Dillards band members Dean Webb and Mitch Jayne were on hand representing The Darlings. In May 2016 and also May 2019, Peterson appeared as a guest of honor at the Mayberry In The Midwest Festival in Danville, Indiana.

Feist. It is the second book in the Darkwar Saga and was published in 2006. It was preceded by Flight of the Nighthawks and followed by the final book in the saga, Wrath of a Mad God. Plot introduction Leso Varen has moved to wreak havoc on the world of Kelewan and Pug and the Conclave of the Shadows are determined to find him, only to find out he has stolen a body of a Tsurani magician. Meanwhile, Pug, Magnus, Nakor and Ralan Bek lead a desperate expedition into the Dasati realm hoping to find the key to defeating the enemy who threatens their homeworld. Plot summary Into a Dark Realm continues the Darkwar saga and mostly concentrates on two groups of characters. The first group consists of Pug, Magnus, Nakor and Ralan Bek who are attempting to reach the Dasati home world. The main problem facing them is that the Dasati exist on the Second Plane, the next lower plane of existence, a separate reality considered to be the first of the seven planes of hell (where the seven upper planes are considered heaven). The second group consists of Tad, Zane and Jommy who are sent into training by the Conclave of Shadows for their future as generals in the Conclave. Tad, Zane and Jommy are sent to a monastic university in Roldem, where they will undergo training and education to prepare them for their future roles with the Conclave. Upon arrival, they instantly clash with a group of boys led by a bully named Servan, who they later discover is related to the king of Roldem. Eventually, the two groups of boys are forced to work out their differences, for they are soon released from the university, and commissioned as junior officers in the Roldemish army, where they immediately begin serving together in campaigns against raiders from Roldem's border colonies. There Tad, Zane and Jommy are reunited with Kaspar, another agent of the Conclave, who is a senior officer with the army. Meanwhile, on their journey to the Dasati realm, Pug and his companions spend time with the Ipiliac, a race related to the Dasati, on their world of Delecordia, halfway between the first and second planes. There they become acclimated to the conditions they will face in the second plane, and undergo crucial training and education to help them survive in the harsh Dasati society. As he spends more and more time closer to the second plane, Bek realizes he belongs there, easily acclimating to the nature of the plane as well as the culture, and expresses a desire to stay behind when the others return. An additional plot thread is added halfway through the novel, introducing Dasati culture as seen through the eyes of a young Dasati warrior, Valko, as he rises to become Lord of his clan, the Camareen. Unbeknownst to him at first, Valko's family are agents of The White, a secret organization of servants of Good who oppose the Dasati's Dark God and seek to restore balance to the Dasati. After completing their training, Pug and his companions succeed in reaching the Dasati realm, on the outer world of Kosridi, finding themselves guided by allies of Valko and The White. When they finally reach the Dasati homeworld, the leader of the Dasati resistance, known as The Gardener, is revealed to be none other than Macros the Black, reincarnated as a Dasati. They also discover that the Talnoy hidden on Midkemia contain the souls of 10,000 lost Dasati Gods, banished after the Dasati Chaos Wars. Into a Dark Realm is very much an intermediary book, setting up the final book in the trilogy, Wrath of a Mad God.

It is for higher education in art of music, dance and theatre. The NCS also offers academic subjects at the secondary and college levels. It is the only circus school in the Americas to offer professional programs in circus arts: Preparatory program, Circus and High School Studies, and Higher Education in Circus arts. It also prepares professional circus arts educators. History In 1981 at the Immaculate Conception Centre, a circus school begins to attract young artists interested in theatrical acrobatics. Soon the Immaculate Conception Centre could no longer contain the rapid growth of the National Circus School (NCS). In 1989 the school moved to the Dalhousie station facilities in Old Montreal. The only institution to offer professional circus teaching in North America, the NCS has become one of the world's circus schools. The need to train a greater number of versatile and highly skilled artists, by now the hallmark of the Quebec circus, is apparent. The NCS launches into a new phase of growth that sees it relocating to the Cit√© des Arts du Cirque as a founding member, along with Cirque du Soleil and En Piste, the national network for circus arts. In 2003 the NCS completes the move to a new building custom built to its specifications in the heart of Tohu, as this new complex is known. In addition to circus arts training, the NCS also offers academic subjects at the secondary and college levels. Programs Preparatory program The first level of training, this extracurricular program is aimed at students 9 to 13 years old. This program allows students to continue their primary in another school. Disciplines taught during the program are dance, acting, physical training, manipulation, balancing, acrobatics and aerials. Circus and High School Studies Program This arts/academic program is offered to students in Grades 7 through 11. It combines required academic subjects as outlined by the Quebec secondary school curriculum with professional training in the circus arts. After obtaining their high school diploma, students pursue higher education through the Diploma of Collegial Studies in Circus Arts (DEC) program. The following academic subjects are taught as outlined by the secondary teaching schedule of the Quebec Ministry of Education: French, English, mathematics, science and technology, human biology, geography, social studies, history, economics, career choice, morality instruction and personal and social development. Disciplines taught during the program are dance, acting, physical preparation, manipulation, balancing, acrobatics and aerials. French is the language of instruction for both academic subjects and circus art training. However, the School's French immersion program favors Canadian students who have not previously attended a French-language school. Diploma of Collegial Circus School Studies This 3-year program marks the pinnacle of higher education in the circus arts and leads directly to a professional career. Graduates receive a college diploma, Diploma of Collegial Studies in Circus Arts or DEC, from the Quebec Ministry of Education. Intended for Canadian and French students who have completed their high school studies, the program combines specialized training in the circus and theatre arts with a general college education. The general education component includes courses in literature (French or English), philosophy and a second language. Specialized training in circus arts, technical courses: physical conditioning, dance, acting, voice and music, performance and creation as well as basic and advanced techniques of aerials, acrobatics, balancing and manipulation. Theory courses: circus history, applied anatomy, methodology, health and safety, staging techniques and career management. Training is given in French. Diploma of National Circus Studies Intended exclusively for foreign students who have completed their high school studies, this 3-year program constitutes the final phase of higher education in the circus arts. Graduates receive a diploma from the School or DEE, as they prepare for a professional career. Specialized training includes courses in physical technique, dance, acting, voice and music, as well as the basic techniques for aerials, acrobatics, balancing and manipulation. Courses in theoretical and applied anatomy, nutrition, staging techniques and career management complement practical subjects. Students continue their training in the circus arts through courses in their chosen minor and/or major from among 5 disciplines: aerials, balancing, acrobatics, manipulation and clowning arts. Intensive summer camps This summer program in the form of a two-week intensive summer camp allows young people ages 13 to 17 to experience professional training in circus arts. Activities are scheduled 5 days a week, 6 hours per day, and represent a balance between learning physical techniques such as physical conditioning, flexibility, acrobatics, trampoline and \\"powertrack\\" with receiving an introduction to such circus arts as aerials, manipulation and balancing. Creative and acting workshops are among the many diverse activities that complement the training participants receive, culminating in performing before an audience. Student services The school offers a range of services such as on-campus housing, a library, a scholarship program, food services and health services.

A son of the well-known playwright Dion Boucicault and actress Agnes Robertson, he followed his father into the theatrical profession and made a career as a character actor and a director. In addition to extensive work in the West End of London, he spent considerable time in Australia, where he went into management in the 1880s. As an actor, his greatest successes included Trelawny of the 'Wells' and Mr. Pim Passes By. His best-known success as a manager was Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, of which he presented the premiere and many revivals. His last big success was Lilac Time in 1922. Early life Darley George Boucicault,Banerji, Nilanjana, \\"Boucicault, Dion, the younger (1859‚Äì1929)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, online edition, January 2008, accessed 13 January 2011 later known as Dion Boucicault Jr., was born in New York, the third child of Dion Boucicault, the well-known actor and dramatist, and his wife, Agnes Kelly n√©e Robertson (1833‚Äì1916), who was also well known on the stage. He had two elder siblings, Dion William (1855‚Äì1876), Eva (1857‚Äì1909), and three younger siblings, Patrice (1862-?1890), Nina (1867‚Äì1950), the first actress to play Peter Pan, and Aubrey (1868‚Äì1913) a handsome and dashing matinee idol. Boucicault was educated at Esher, Cuddington and Paris, and served briefly in the militia. After his elder brother died, Boucicault adopted his name Dion. Theatrical career Punch illustration of Boucicault and Irene Vanbrugh in the 1920 London production of Mr. Pim Passes By Boucicault made his stage d√©but in his father's play, Louis XI at Booth's Theatre in New York City on 11 October 1879. His London d√©but was in November 1880, when he played Andy in another of his father's plays, Andy Blake. From then he was constantly on the stage either acting or directing productions. In 1881 and 1882 he appeared at the Court Theatre, and in 1883 he went on tour as the original Harry Marsland in The Private Secretary. He also adapted two plays, My Little Girl (1882) and Devotion (1884), both of which were produced at the Court. In 1885 he went to Australia with his father, and decided to remain there. He entered into partnership with Robert Brough in 1886, and at the Bijou Theatre in Melbourne and the Criterion in Sydney a long series of plays by Robertson, Pinero, Jones and other dramatists of the period was produced with great care and artistry. A fine company was assembled which included Boucicault's sister Nina, afterwards to make a reputation in London, G. S. Titheradge, and G. W. Anson. The Brough and Boucicault Comedy Company inaugurated their lesseeship and management of Her Majesty's Opera House, Melbourne, on 9 October September, 1886, by the first production in Australia of \\"Turned Up\\" by Mark Melford. Though modern comedy was usually played, there was one excursion into Shakespeare, a notable performance of Much Ado About Nothing with Titheradge as Benedick, and Mrs Brough as Beatrice. Boucicault had invaluable experience both as a producer and as an actor, and when he returned to London in 1896 he was capable of taking any part that his lack of height, 5 ft 7 in (170 cm), did not disqualify him for. On 20 January 1898 he played one of his most successful parts, Sir William Gower, in Trelawney of the Wells, and a long succession of important parts followed, including many characters of \\"crusty senility\\". He directed the first production of Peter Pan and other well-known plays by Barrie, Milne and various leading dramatists of the time. From 1901 to 1922, Boucicault was active as a producer, first in partnership with Charles Frohman, and, after Frohman's death, on his own. His last successful production was Lilac Time in December 1922. Boucicault visited Australia again in 1923 with his wife Irene Vanbrugh, with a repertoire which included Mr. Pim Passes By, Belinda, The Second Mrs Tanquerary, Trelawney of the Wells, His House in Order and Aren't We All. He returned to London in 1925 but was back again in Australia in 1926 (accompanied by Brian Aherne), and in South Africa in 1927, and once again in Australia and New Zealand in 1927-28 when plays by Barrie, Milne and others were staged. He played the part of the Chinese character Ong Chi Seng in the production of Somerset Maugham's play The Letter in Melbourne in 1927. Late life and legacy Boucicault's health began to deteriorate in Australia, and returning to England via New Zealand, he died at his home in Berkshire on 25 June 1929, survived by his wife. Boucicault was a great producer of comedy and paid great attention to detail. In Australia he set a standard that has seldom, if ever, been surpassed. He was a most finished actor in a wide range of parts and in his later years became the legitimate successor of Sir John Hare in playing old men's parts. News of his death in Australia had critics mourning his death.

An omnidirectional antenna (which broadcast in all directions) is typically used for a repeater system that amplify coverage for all cellular carriers. A directional antenna is used when a particular tower or carrier needs to be isolated for improvement. The use of a highly directional antenna can help improve the donor's signal-to-noise ratio, thus improving the quality of signal redistributed inside a building. Indoor antenna Some cellular repeater systems can also include an omnidirectional antenna for rebroadcasting the signal indoors. Depending on attenuation from obstacles, the advantage of using an omnidirectional antenna is that the signal will be equally distributed in all directions. Signal amplifier Cellular repeater systems include a signal amplifier. Standard GSM channel selective repeaters (operated by telecommunication operators for coverage of large areas and big buildings) have output power around 2 W, high power repeaters have output power around 10 W. The power gain is calculated by the following equation: :: \\\\quad P_\\\\mathrm{dB} = 10 \\\\log_{10} \\\\left(\\\\frac{P}{P_0} \\\\right) \\\\ A repeater needs to secure sufficient isolation between the donor and the service antenna. When the isolation is lower than actual gain plus a margin (of typically 5‚Äì15 dB), the repeater may go into in loop oscillation. This oscillation can cause interference to the cellular network. The isolation may be improved by antenna type selection in a macro environment, which involves adjusting the angle between the donor and service antennas (ideally 180¬∞), space separation (typically the vertical distance in the case of the tower installation between donor and service antenna is several meters), insertion into an attenuating environment (e.g. installing a metal mesh between donor and service antennas), and/or reduction of reflections (no near obstacles in front of the donor antenna such as trees or buildings). Isolation can be also improved by integrated feature called ICE (interference cancellation equipment) offered in some products (e.g., NodeG, RFWindow). Activation of this feature has a negative impact on internal delay (higher delay => approximately +5 Œºs up to standard rep. delay) and consequently a shorter radius from donor site. Amplification and filtering introduce a delay (typically between 5 and 15 Œºs), depending on the type of repeater and features used. Additional distance also adds propagation delay. Reasons for weak signal Rural areas In many rural areas the housing density is too low to make construction of a new base station commercially viable. Installing a home cellular repeater may remedy this. In flat rural areas the signal is unlikely to suffer from multipath interference. Building construction material Certain construction materials can attenuate cell phone signal strength. Older buildings, such as churches, often block cellular signals. Any building that has a significant thickness of concrete, or a large amount of metal used in its construction, will attenuate the signal. Concrete floors are often poured onto a metal pan, which completely blocks most radio signals. Some solid foam insulation and some fiberglass insulation used in roofs or exterior walls have foil backing, which can reduce transmittance.Nguyen, James \\"11 Major Building Materials that Kill Your Cell Reception\\", 4 August 2017. Retrieved 20 March 2019. Energy efficient windows and metal window screens are also very effective at blocking radio signals. Some materials have peaks in their absorption spectra, which decrease signal strength. Building size Large buildings, such as warehouses, hospitals, and factories, often lack cellular reception. Low signal strength also tends to occur in underground areas (such as basements, and in shops and restaurants located towards the centre of shopping malls). In these cases, an external antenna is usually used. Multipath interference Even in urban areas (which usually have strong cellular signals throughout), there may be dead zones caused by destructive interference of waves. These usually have an area of a few blocks and will usually only affect one of the two frequency ranges used by cell phones. This happens because different wavelengths of the different frequencies interfere destructively at different points. Directional antennas can be helpful at overcoming this issue since they may be used to select a single path from several (see Multipath interference for more details). Diffraction and general attenuation The longer wavelengths have the advantage of diffracting more, and so line of sight is not as necessary to obtain a good signal. Because the frequencies that cell phones use are too high to reflect off the ionosphere as shortwave radio waves do, cell phone waves cannot travel via the ionosphere. (See Diffraction and Attenuation for more details). Different operating frequencies Repeaters are available for all of the GSM frequency bands. Some repeaters will handle different types of networks (such as multi-mode GSM and UMTS). Repeater systems are available for certain Satellite phone systems, allowing these to be used indoors without a clear line of sight to the satellite.  Regional Approval  Approval in the USA by the FCC It used to be legal to use the low power devices available for home and small scale use in commercial areas (offices, shops, bars, etc.). On February 20, 2013, the FCC released a Report & Order, thus establishing two Safe Harbors and defining the use of \\"network safe\\" consumer boosters on licensed spectrum. The Safe Harbors represent a compromise solution between Technology Manufacturers and Wireless Operators. Only a few companies have a product compatible with the new FCC regulations. The FCC has defined two types of repeaters: # Wide-band (or broadband) signal boosters are usually repeaters that amplify all frequencies from cell phone carriers. Because interferences can be generated from such boosters, the manufacturers who apply to the FCC must limit their gain (among other things), to 65 dB (for the low LTE 700MHz bands) to 72 dB (for higher frequencies such as AWS). By limiting the system gain, such boosters are only useful when the outdoor signal is relatively high, and need a complex outdoor installation of specific antennas. # Carrier specific (or provider specific) signal boosters. These boosters are only designed to boost those frequencies (and signal) that belong to a particular carrier. Usually, such carrier specific boosters do not produce interferences on other carrier's frequencies, and are allowed to have much larger system gains (sometimes 100 dB). In these conditions, such devices boost signal in a larger coverage area, and can still be efficient when outdoor carrier signals are weak, but are only boosting the signal for the carrier it is designed to operate. These new rules by the FCC were implemented on March 1, 2014. Here are the rules. Approval in the UK by Ofcom and the UK market In May 2011, Ofcom stated the following: Installation or use of repeater devices (as with any radio equipment) is a criminal offence unless two conditions are satisfied: # That the equipment is CE marked, indicating that the manufacturer has declared that it complies with all relevant EU regulatory requirements, including the Radio equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment (R&TTE;) Directive; # That the use of the equipment is specifically authorised in the UK, either via a licence or by regulations made by Ofcom to exempt the use from licensing. Under WT Act 2006 section 1.15, the wireless act also allows an exemption if the device does not \\"involve undue interference with wireless telegraphy\\". This is expected to follow the US- style regulations where a mobile repeater must have protection built in against interference. Ofcom stated that \\"Repeater devices transmit or re- transmit in the cellular frequency bands. Only the mobile network operators are licensed to use equipment that transmits in these bands. Installation or use of repeater devices by anyone without a licence is a criminal offence under Section 8 of the WT Act 2006.\\" Repeaters operating in rural and less densely populated areas do not pose a quantifiable problem.

Traditionally they are considered to be St. Charles Parish, St. James Parish, and St. John the Baptist Parish. These parishes also made up a historical area once referred to as the German Coast of Louisiana. Two of the River Parishes, St. Charles and St. John the Baptist, are also part of the New Orleans metropolitan area, based on the U.S. Census Bureau definition. The third River Parish, St. James, together with Ascension Parish, was known historically as the Acadian Coast. Ascension Parish, sometimes included as part of the River Parishes sub-region, is home to the River Parishes Community College, chartered in 1997. The area contains a large number of architecturally- significant historic plantation homes. The three traditional parishes have a combined land area of 1,939.04 km¬≤ (748.67 sq mi). They have a total 2010 census population of 120,459 inhabitants. If Ascension Parish is included, the total land area is 2,694.10 km¬≤ (1,040.198 sq mi) and the census population is 228,345. Its four largest communities are all unincorporated census-designated places: LaPlace, Luling, Destrehan, and Reserve.

Its largest community is also an unincorporated community in Ascension Parish census- designated place: Prairieville according to 2020 estimates. Another sizable community within the traditional parishes is St. Rose, also unincorporated. Still smaller in population, however, are the largest incorporated towns in the three-parish area: Lutcher and Gramercy. The largest of all communities in this region is LaPlace in St. John the Baptist Parish. But with Ascension Parish, the largest community would be instead Prairieville.

The course is where golf legend Arnold Palmer learned to play the game of golf from his father. The grounds are located in Unity Township in Westmoreland County, south of Latrobe, and nearer Youngstown. History Latrobe Country Club was founded in 1920 by a group of leading industrialists, bankers and professionals from Latrobe, Pennsylvania. The group had acquired of the Kennan Farm bordering on what was then the National Lincoln Highway (U.S. Route 30) just west of Youngstown. By the summer of 1921, work was well underway on the golf course and clubhouse. Among those on the job was a teenager named Milford (Deacon \\"Deke\\") Palmer, Arnold Palmer's father. From that hilly plot of ground emerged a short but imaginative nine- hole course. Despite tough economic times, the club made steady progress over the next two decades. Additional tracts of land were purchased, allowing for revisions that greatly improved the course. In 1944, the Unity Land Company was created and became owner of the property and financed further expansion of the clubhouse and other facilities. By the early 1960s, sufficient land had been acquired to enable plans for an 18-hole course. Both Deacon and Arnold Palmer contributed heavily to the design of the nine new holes and the revamping of the existing holes to fit the layout. Construction began in 1963 and the new course opened for play the following season. The then 6,377-yard, par-72 course has matured into a beautiful and demanding test of golf. Course improvement and the modernization and expansion of the clubhouse was accelerated when Arnold Palmer purchased the club in 1971. The interior of the clubhouse was redesigned. Tennis courts, maintenance buildings and cart storage areas were all constructed. Over the years, many of the holes have been revised and lengthened, a modern irrigation system was installed, permanent cart paths were added and a practice range was created. Deacon Palmer, who had become the grounds superintendent in 1926 and the golf professional in 1931, remained active until his death at the age of 71 in February 1976. Covered Bridges When Arnold Palmer was designing the back nine at Latrobe Country Club, he wanted to create something that was innovative, yet reflective of western Pennsylvania's rich culture and traditions. He found his inspiration in a watery hazard. A picturesque creek cuts comes into play on several challenging holes on the back nine. So instead of building utilitarian rain shelters on this part of the course, Palmer decided to construct covered bridges that could provide protection when storms kicked up. These beautiful, red, covered bridges are so popular that artists and photographers from across the United States now come to Latrobe just to capture their image. Tree Carving When Latrobe Country Club was founded in 1921, the golf course was built on farmland. It's hard to imagine today, but back then there were very few trees on this relatively open parcel of land. So, Deacon Palmer embarked on a massive tree planting campaign. About 75 percent of the trees found on the course today were planted by Deacon. One of them, a red pine between the first and eighteenth hole, died recently and was in the process of being cut down. Arnold Palmer suggested that the stump be left and converted into a giant carving of his father. His brother, Jerry, hired renowned local woodcarver Joe King to transform the red pine into a sentimental tribute to their father.

The tackler wraps their arms around the ball carrier's thighs and lifts them a short distance in the air before forcibly driving them to the ground. The move is frowned upon in many rugby communities as a dangerous tackling technique, as it puts the player being tackled at risk of a spine, neck, or head injury. However, the move is still popular in some places, and is often considered a crowd-pleaser. A similar tackle to the dump tackle is the spear tackle, a more dangerous (and illegal) move. This can be done by adding additional rotation to the player being tackled, causing the player to hit the ground head or neck first.  Rugby Union  According to World Rugby rules, \\"a player must not lift an opponent off the ground and drop or drive that player so that their head and/or upper body make contact with the ground.\\" This applies to both dump tackles and spear tackles, although the calling of a penalty for these tackles is up to the discretion of the referee. Illegal dump tackles can be penalized with a yellow card, red card, or penalty only depending on the severity of the tackle and the danger to the player being tackled. In an effort to reduce tackle- related injuries, World Rugby has emphasized to referees the importance of penalizing players who use this tackle technique dangerously.  Rugby League  The dump tackle is a tackling technique favored mainly by rugby league players. A player is guilty of misconduct if they \\"uses any dangerous throw when affecting a tackle,\\" which includes any lifting of the player being tackled beyond the horizontal (i.e., a spear tackle). As per Rugby League International Federation (IRLF) laws, > \\"Dangerous throw (d) If, in any tackle of, or contact with, an opponent that > player is so lifted that he is placed in a position where it is likely that > the first part of his body to make contact with the ground will be his head > or neck (‚Äúthe dangerous position‚Äù), then that tackle or contact will be > deemed to be a dangerous throw unless, with the exercise of reasonable care, > the dangerous position could not have been avoided.\\"  See also  *Tackle (football move) *Spear tackle - similar to a dump tackle *Grapple tackle - another controversial tackling technique *High tackle * Glossary of rugby league terms *Glossary of rugby union terms * One on one tackle References Category:Rugby league terminology Category:Rugby union terminology ","title":"Dump tackle"},{"id":"4277343","text":"Nesophontes, sometimes called West Indies shrews, is the sole genus of the extinct, monotypic mammal family Nesophontidae in the order Eulipotyphla. These animals were small insectivores, about 5 to 15 cm long, their mass ranging from 10 to 125 g, and a long slender snout and head and a long tail. They were endemic to Cuba, Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti), Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Cayman Islands. Although reliable estimates are unavailable, these animals are widely believed to have survived the Pleistocene extinction since remains have been found among those of Rattus and Mus species. Some authorities estimate extinction coinciding with the arrival of rats aboard Spanish vessels in the early 16th century (1500). Others, such as Morgan and Woods, claim that some species survived until the early 20th century. A phylogenetic study in 2016, based on DNA extracted from a specimen about 750 years old, suggests their nearest relatives are the solenodons, although the two groups diverged close to 65 million years ago, and specifically near the end of the mesozoic era.

Recent efforts to locate surviving populations have been unsuccessful. Although some Nesophontes remains (in owl pellets) have been reported as fresh-appearing, radiocarbon dating has failed to support any post-16th century dates, suggesting that the nesophontids became extinct very rapidly at approximately the time of European discovery of the Greater Antilles, although one species, N. hemicingulus, possibly survived until around c.1632-1774.

The rocker cover has been removed, so the pushrods, rocker arms and valve springs and valves are visible A valvetrain or valve train is a mechanical system that controls operation of the intake and exhaust valves in an internal combustion engine. The intake valves control the flow of air/fuel mixture (or air alone for direct-injected engines) into the combustion chamber, while the exhaust valves control the flow of spent exhaust gasses out of the combusion chamber once combustion is completed. Layout The valvetrain layout is largely dependent on the location of the camshaft(s). The common valvetrain configurations for piston engines are: ; Cam-in-block : The camshaft is located within the engine block, as either an overhead valve (OHV) or flathead engine. Because they often use pushrods, OHV engines are often called \\"pushrod engines\\". ; Overhead camshaft : The camshaft(s) are located near the top of the engine, above the combustion chamber. ; Camless : This layout uses no camshafts at all. Technologies such as solenoids are used to individually actuate the valves.  Components  The valvetrain consists of all the components responsible for transferring the rotational movement of the camshaft into the opening and closing of the intake and exhaust valves. Typical components are listed below in order from the crankshaft to the valves.  Camshaft  The timing and lift profile of the valve opening events are controlled by the camshaft, through use of a carefully shaped lobe on a rotating shaft. The camshaft is driven by the crankshaft and‚Äî in the case of a four-stroke engine‚Äî rotates at half the speed of the crankshaft. Motion is transferred from the crankshaft to the camshaft most commonly by a rubber timing belt, a metallic timing chain or a set of gears.  Pushrod  Pushrods are long, slender metal rods that are used in overhead valve engines to transfer motion from the camshaft (located in the engine block) to the valves (located in the cylinder head). The bottom end of a pushrod is fitted with a lifter, upon which the camshaft makes contact. The camshaft lobe moves the lifter upwards, which moves the pushrod. The top end of the lifter pushes on the rocker arm, which opens the valve.  Rocker arm / bucket tappet  Depending on the design used, the valves are actuated by a rocker arm, finger or bucket tappet. Overhead camshaft engines use fingers or bucket tappets, upon which the cam lobes contact. Overhead valve engines use rocker arms, which are actuated by a pushrod and pivot on a shaft or individual ball studs in order to actuate the valves.  Valves  Most modern engines use poppet valves type, although sleeve valves, slide valves and rotary valves have also been used at times. Poppet valves are typically opened by the camshaft lobe or rocker arm, and closed by a coiled spring called a valve spring. Valve float occurs when the valve spring is unable to control the inertia of the valvetrain at high engine speeds (RPM).

A drama‚Äìromance of the race film genre, The Exile was Micheaux's first feature-length talkie, and the first African-American talkie.The Exile (1931) on AfricanAmericans.com.Beckerman, Jim, \\"Pioneering African-American film comes back to Fort Lee, where it all began\\", NorthJersey.com, February 16, 2014. Adapted from Micheaux's first novel, The Conquest (1913), it has some autobiographical elements: like the film's central character Jean Baptiste (played by Stanley Morrell), Micheaux spent several years as a cattle rancher in an otherwise all-white area of South Dakota. Cast *Eunice Brooks as Edith Duval *Stabley Morrell as Jean Baptiste *Celeste Cole as Singer *Nora Newsome as Agnes Stewart *Carl Mahon as Jango *Kathleen Noisette as Madge *Charles R. Moore (actor) as Jack Stewart *George Randol as Bill Prescott *A.B. DeComathiere as An Outlaw *Lou Vernon as District Attorney *Louise Cook as Dancer *Roland Holder as Tap Dancer *Donald Heywood as Bandleader Synopsis The story begins in Chicago, where Edith Duval (Eunice Brooks) has become a power in the African American community, largely because she came into possession of a South Chicago mansion where she used to be a servant: the white family that owned the mansion abandoned it when blacks started moving into the neighborhood. She is in love with Baptiste, and at first it seems like they may be a match, but she rejects his idealism and he her cynicism: she wants to turn the mansion into a speakeasy and nightclub. Baptiste, instead, buys land in South Dakota and becomes a successful rancher. Five years into his time there, he falls in love with young Agnes Stewart (Nora Newsome), and she with him. He considers the situation hopeless, though, because she is white. The audience has already been cued in that he may be wrong about that: when she first heard about him, and it is mentioned to her that he is a \\"Negro\\", she conjectures on how light or dark he may be, with words to the effect that \\"some Negroes are no darker than my mother -- although with no sign of her ever having questioned her late mother's racial identity, or her own. Further, her father has demurred from another rancher's racist remark, quoting Robert Burns, \\"A Man's A Man for A' That\\". Fleeing back to Chicago to escape his supposedly doomed relationship, the previously teetotaling Baptiste returns to Edith's club, her liquor, and her charms. They plan to marry, but her former lover, an Ethiopian named Jango (Carl Mahon) appears on the scene, sneaks into Edith's room and complains of how she has ruined him. He threatens suicide; she hands him a gun as a gesture of contempt. Instead of killing himself, however, he kills her. Baptiste is initially suspected of the murder, but is cleared. Meanwhile, Agnes's father, discovering that Baptiste has fled, tells her about her own background. Earlier in the film, there has been reference to the one-drop rule: it is clear that in the time's (and Micheaux's) conception of race, this defines her as black. She takes a train to Chicago, where she and Baptiste are reunited; they marry and return to South Dakota. Production The film was shot in Fort Lee, New Jersey, when many early film studios in America's first motion picture industry were based there at the beginning of the 20th century. Filming took place in rented space at the Metropolitan Studios in and had to be scheduled around the work schedules of many cast members who were busy with commitments on Broadway. Principal photography wrapped in late February 1931 and post-production was completed in March. The film had a successful preview screening and premiered at the Lafayette Theater in May to sold-out crowds and very positive reviews.

Biography Born in Lowell, Ohio, Fohl's involvement in professional baseball began in the early 1900s, when he served as a catcher for minor-league clubs in Ohio. His subsequent major-league playing career consisted of just five games as a catcher and 17 at-bats over two seasons. In 1915, he took over as manager of the Indians, with his best finish coming in 1918 when the Tribe finished in second place behind the Red Sox. He never made an important move, however, without consulting Tris Speaker, who arrived via a trade with Boston in the same year Fohl took over. In 1919, Fohl resigned as the Indians' manager after 78 games, and Speaker stepped in as manager for the remainder of the season. Fohl resurfaced in 1921 with the Browns, where in 1922 the team was only eliminated from the pennant race on the penultimate game of the season, finishing just one game behind the New York Yankees. When the 1923 Browns fell back closer (but still above) .500, he was fired in midseason. In 1924, he joined the Red Sox, where he finished his managerial career on a dismal note; his Red Sox teams never finished higher than seventh place.

It lies beside the River Chew in the Chew Valley. It is 7 miles from Bristol, 9 miles from Bath, and 4 miles from Keynsham. The principal settlement in the parish is Pensford. The parish also includes the village of Belluton and part of the village of Woollard. At the 2011 census it had a population of 1,119.  History  Publow anciently belonged to the St Loes of Newton, and later came into the hands of the Hungerfords along with Compton Dando. The manor having many owners Henry Hastings (Third Earl Becher (c1517-1570)), Sir John Popham, Sir Francis Popham. It is close to the route of the ancient Wansdyke. The name Publow is believed to mean 'The public meadow' from the Latin publicus and the Old English leah. An alternative explanation is that the name was originally Publo or Publoe meaning Priests Hill and the nearest hill still bears that name. The parish of Publow was part of the Keynsham Hundred, Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within their area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. They are also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters are in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 the parish was part of the Clutton Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It was also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Publow has its own parish council, which has some responsibility for local issues and is part of the Publow and Whitchurch Ward, which is represented by one councillor on the Bath and North East Somerset Unitary Authority, which has wider responsibilities for services such as education, refuse, tourism etc. The village is a part of the North East Somerset constituency and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.  Demographics  According to the 2001 Census, the Publow and Whitchurch Ward (which includes Belluton and Pensford), had 1,087 residents, living in 429 households, with an average age of 40.8 years. Of these 73% of residents describing their health as 'good', 24% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no qualifications; and the area had an unemployment rate of 2.3% of all economically active people aged 16‚Äì74. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, it was ranked at 26,408 out of 32,482 wards in England, where 1 was the most deprived LSOA and 32,482 the least deprived.  Buildings   Church  Church of All Saints at Publow The Church of All Saints dates from the 14th century has a 15th-century tower with gargoyles. The pulpit is Jacobean. It is a Grade I listed building. The church consists of a west tower, nave, north aisle and porch, south aisle and porch, and chancel. The west tower has four stages with set back buttresses terminating in diagonally set pinnacles at the bell chamber stage. The nave has a clerestorey of four 2-light trefoil headed windows. The east end of the chancel has an early Perpendicular (restored) 3-light window with reticulated tracery. The pulpit dates from the early 17th century, and is made of oak with carved, arcaded panels to the upper part and rosettes on the lower part.  Bridge  The bridge over the River Chew dates from the medieval period and was rebuilt and dated 1788 and 1810, and is Grade II listed. The bridge developed a crack and showed other signs of potential weakness, which required extensive renovation work involving an unusual combination of cutting-edge engineering techniques and the use of traditional materials, complicated by the presence of two protected species: Daubenton's bats, which were roosting in cavities under the bridge, and white clawed crayfish in the river below. The renovation by Bath & North East Somerset Council's transportation team, and partner Mott MacDonald, working with experts from English Heritage and the Environment Agency, received a commendation at the Historic Bridge and Infrastructure Awards in London in November 2006, which were sponsored by the Institution of Civil Engineers.

This contrasts with an overhead camshaft (OHC) design which places the camshafts within the cylinder head and drives the valves directly or through short rocker arms. Placing the camshaft inside the engine block has a long history in its use in valve-in-block engines, in straight and V configurations, the Ford flathead being exemplary of the type. Pushrod overhead valve engines with the cam in the block were long used in Chevrolet and Buick straight engines from the 1930s through the mid-1950s and in various similar six-cylinder engines until the extensive employment of the V6 configuration in the 1980s. There are three main cam-in-block designs: * L-head, also known as L-block, flathead or sidevalve * F-head * I-head, also known as overhead valve (OHV) __TOC__ L-head L-head engine with Ricardo's turbulent head L-head (flathead) refers to the pushrod valvetrain configuration in which the valves are placed in the engine block beside the pistons. The design was common on early engine designs, but has since fallen from use. Generally L-head engines use a small chamber on one side of the cylinder to carry the valves. This has a number of advantages, primarily in that it makes the cylinder head much simpler. It also means that the valve can be operated by pushing directly up on it, as opposed to needing some sort of mechanical arrangement to push the valves down. It may also lead to slightly easier cooling, as the valves and operating rods are out of the way of the cylinder, making a cooling jacket simpler to construct (but see below). The line of intakes along the side of the engine lead to the name L-head, due to the cylinders having the shape of an upside-down L. This configuration is also known as sidevalve, as the valves are located beside the cylinders. On the downside, the L-head engine also requires the airflow to make at least a 90¬∞ turn to enter the cylinder, which makes it less efficient; colloquially it's said that such an engine has poorer \\"breathing\\". Breathing was not greatly emphasized in past production cars because engines could not run long and reliably at high speed due to other factors. This was a minor concern given the benefits in simplicity. Although L-head inline 4 and 6-cylinder engines were frequently used for automobiles, tractors, etc., the best known L-head automotive engine is the early 20th century Ford V-8, which has both sets of valves (intake and exhaust) located on the inside of the \\"Vee,\\" and which are all operated by a single camshaft located above the crankshaft. The exhaust follows a lengthy path to leave the engine. This virtually guarantees that the engine will need an unusually large coolant radiator to avoid overheating under sustained heavy use. A flathead design in a V engine, with the air intake/fuel system and all of the exhaust and intake valves inside of the \\"V\\" requires that the exhaust gas be passed between the cylinders to outside of the V to the exhaust system. Exhaust heat is thus passed to the coolant (as it exits the engine between the cylinders). In the Ford V-8 flathead design, manufactured from 1932 through 1952, the center exhaust port on the outside of the block exhausts the gasses from two cylinders, exacerbating the high heat problem. This \\"very hot in the middle\\" problem makes this particular engine prone to heat-related stress and cracks in the cylinder block. In line engine exhaust gas exits the block more directly and does not cross between the cylinders and is a more temperature-stable design. Whenever exhaust ports and valves are in the cylinder head, exhausting heat has far less time to heat the coolant, and such engines are more durable under high load conditions and a similar sized engine will require less coolant radiator capacity than a flathead V-8. Due to the heating and efficiency problems, L-head engines fell from high power uses such as aircraft engines fairly quickly, prior to World War I. They lived on for some time in the automotive world and were used in the World War II Jeep, for instance. L-heads are no longer used in automobile engines, although they remain in common use for small-engine applications in lawnmowers and generators. Because of their heat-retaining design, the size of valves and the compression ratio are limited (the valve/combustion chamber is away from the piston top typically creating a larger combustion space--a lower compression ratio), which in turn reduces available power and economy. Not all L-heads are cam-in-block engines; the location of the camshaft varies in this layout... T-head crossflow engine T-head flathead engines have a crossflow layout, with the exhaust valves on the opposite side from the inlet valves. A single-cylinder T-head engine needs only a single camshaft; multi- cylinder T-heads need two. I-head : The I-head design is one in which the entry and exit valves and ports are contained in the cylinder head. It was developed by the Scottish-American David Dunbar Buick. It employed pushrod- actuated valves parallel to the pistons and is still in use today in some designs (notably several engines produced by General Motors and Chrysler). It has several advantages over L- and F-head designs, but the most notable is the fact that the intake charge and exhaust gases have a more direct path into and out of the combustion chambers, increasing power, improving fuel efficiency and reducing noxious exhaust emissions. F-head : The F-head layout (not to be confused with flathead) can be thought of as a combination of L-head and I-head: the intake manifold and its valves are located atop the cylinders (in the cylinder head, as in an I-head design) and are operated by pushrods, but the exhaust manifold and its valves are located beside the cylinders (in the block, as in an L-head design). The exhaust valves are either roughly or exactly parallel with the pistons; their faces point upwards and they are not operated by pushrods, but by direct contact with a lifter contacting the camshaft. Reverse variation of F-head with side intake and in head exhaust were also made- the Ford V8 overhead exhaust valve conversions to flathead engines were to decrease the overheating under load problems in commercial service. The Indian/Henderson 4-cylinder motorcycle engine family used both designs- the overhead exhaust was again an overheating consideration design. This was a more expensive engine design. Its advantages over competing L-head engines included more power from its higher compression, better intake mixture flow, less susceptibility to pinging, and greater reliability from its cooling of the exhaust valve and its spring (and having half the number of pushrods of an OHV engine). With only one valve in the head, and one in the block, larger valves can be used than in an OHV engine, to offset the poorer airflow of a side exhaust valve. For years the British motor car firms Rolls-Royce and Rover used this arrangement. From 1927 to 1929, the American firm Hudson used a 6-cylinder engine of this form as well, but this engine is not to be confused with that of the race-winning Hudsons of the 1950s. The last major use was the Willys Hurricane engine, used in civilian Jeeps in the 1950s and 1960s. It was replaced by the I-head design.

From 1982 to 2007 Rinder served on the board of directors of CSI and also held the post of executive director of its Office of Special Affairs, overseeing the corporate, legal and public relations matters of Scientology at the international level. Rinder left Scientology in 2007. From 2016 to 2019, he co-hosted the A&E; documentary series Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath. Scientology career Early years Rinder is an Australian national who joined the Sea Org on the ship Apollo at 18. This ship functioned as the headquarters for Sea Org. Rinder quickly became an early member of the Commodore's Messenger Organization, after which he continued to rank up until he had his position with the Office of Special Affairs. In a 2006 interview with Rolling Stone, Rinder said he had experienced discrimination in Australia during the period when the Australian state of Victoria had banned Scientology: \\"You couldn't own Scientology books ... If you did, you had to hide them because if the police came and found them, they'd take them away.\\" Office of Special Affairs As executive director of the Office of Special Affairs, he served as the chief spokesperson and representative of Scientology to the media for 25 years until replaced by Tommy Davis in 2005 under orders from David Miscavige. This office is responsible for overseeing public relations and legal issues for the church, as well as handling \\"internal investigations into members' behavior.\\" In a 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, Rinder describes the alleged scope of his position: Rinder cites specific examples of this duty, saying that he personally traveled to London to prevent journalist John Sweeney, who is responsible for Scientology and Me, from attending a movie premiere and to attempt to \\"discredit Sweeney in any way that he could\\". Departure Rinder has said that he was living in The Hole for over two years \\"when he was suddenly pulled from his prison and sent on [a] mission to London to defend the Church against John Sweeney‚Äôs film\\", Scientology and Me, in March 2007. Rinder defended Scientology leader David Miscavige, but Miscavige was unhappy with the documentary. As a result, Rinder \\"was to report to the church's facility in Sussex, England, and dig ditches\\" and then was to be allowed to return to the United States. Rinder says that his moment of clarity came from a confrontation with the filmmaker, which was recorded on video. Instead of reporting to Sussex, Rinder decided to leave Scientology. Rinder went to Virginia and told Scientology officials that he wanted to speak to his wife and also wanted his possessions. He did not speak to his wife, but was sent a FedEx package with a check for $5,000. His family photos were not sent. Rinder and his first wife, Cathy, divorced after 35 years. He and his second wife, Christie King Collbran, were married in 2013 and have a son. He has no contact with his two adult children from his first marriage. Rinder's official biography has since been removed from the official Scientology website. In 2009, St. Petersburg Times asked Rinder for an interview, but he declined. Then a month later, two Washington-based Scientology lawyers went to his home unannounced, informed Rinder that they knew about the newspaper's visit and asked what he had revealed. Subsequently, he spoke to the Times about Scientology's management and repeated beatings he gave as well as received. The interviews became part of the paper's \\"The Truth Rundown\\" special issue. Rinder said he was speaking out because \\"I don't want people to continue to be hurt and tricked and lied to.\\" In October 2009, Rinder and Marty Rathbun revealed to the St. Petersburg Times how Scientology silenced critics, such as Bob Minton, by digging into personal details and secretly recording conversations. Rinder told the Times: \\"There were things that, really, he was worried about and had caused problems for him in the investigation that we had done\\" and Minton and the Scientology organization reached a private settlement. Rinder considered Minton a friend at the time of Minton's death in January 2010. In March 2010, Rinder again confirmed allegations of abuse within Scientology to CNN's Anderson Cooper on Anderson Cooper 360¬∞. Rinder did not speak on camera because he promised his first interview to the BBC. In April 2010, Rinder, who lived in Clearwater, Florida, for more than a year, went to meet his son who also lives in Clearwater but his son refused to see him. Rinder, Rathbun and two others were cited for trespassing by the Clearwater Police. A few days later, according to police reports: \\"five senior members of its [Scientology's] California-based international management team ‚Äì surrounded and screamed at [Rinder] a former Scientology executive. At the time he was approached, Rinder was sitting in his car at a doctor's office parking lot during a phone interview with BBC journalist John Sweeney. The screaming was so loud, Sweeney was able to record the episode and later aired the recording on The Secrets of Scientology broadcast by the BBC's Panorama program. On 28 September 2010, Rinder appeared on The Secrets of Scientology broadcast by the BBC series Panorama. He discussed his life, losing his family, and behind-the-scenes activity in Scientology. The documentary claims that private auditing sessions are secretly recorded, including ones with secrets about Tom Cruise. Rinder appears in the HBO documentary entitled Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief by Alex Gibney, which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2015. The documentary is based on the book of a similar title by Lawrence Wright. Along with Leah Remini, Rinder co-hosts the A&E; documentary series Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath. Personal life Rinder lived in Denver, Colorado, until 2009. According to his blog, he has since lived in Palm Harbor, Florida, with his wife and son.

Ajax preserved at the Technisches Museum Wien Jones, Turner and Evans The company opened in 1837 with subcontracts from Edward Bury and Robert Stephenson. They provided locomotives for the North Union Railway and the Midland Counties Railway (MCR), the latter all 2-2-2 with diameter driving wheels, and cylinders. In 1840, they built two four-coupled 0-4-2s for the MCR. Further orders included engines for the Great Northern Railway, London and Brighton Railway and the Grand Junction Railway. They also supplied six broad gauge engines for the Great Western Railway, the first of the class being Firefly. In 1841 built four for the Eastern Counties Railway. Also in 1841 they exported two 0-4-2 locomotives to Austria: Minotaurus and Ajax. Ajax is now the oldest preserved steam locomotive in mainland Europe. It was built for the inauguration of the Kaiser Ferdinands-Nordbahn in 1837. Originally built to transport goods it was, due to its large wheels and capability for high speeds, used for passenger services also. In 1874 it was withdrawn from service but not scrapped. From 1897 Ajax' was stored at the Austrian Railway Museum. In 1908 on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Kaiser Ferdinands-Nordbahn it was restored and shortly afterwards transferred to the Techisches Museum in Vienna, where it is still on display. Jones and Potts After the initial railway boom, by 1844, orders were becoming slack and Jones formed a partnership with Arthur Potts, renaming the company Jones and Potts. Mr. Potts was instrumental in securing many more orders, particularly from the Eastern Counties Railway. Two long-boilered freight locomotives, No. 36 and 37 Bristol and Hercules, were supplied to the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway in June 1844. On Midland Railway takeover they were renumbered 222 and 223 and rebuilt around 1855 as Well tanks and assigned to banking duties on the Lickey Incline. Locomotive designs By 1850, the design of most of the locos was to Alexander Allan's pattern, with outside cylinders, and the long-boiler 4-2-0 popularised by Robert Stephenson. As a result, they had a very rough ride and derailed frequently. They also built five 0-6-0 engines for the Scottish lines, which, however were converted to 0-4-2. Seven 2-2-2 well tank engines were provided to the London and Blackwall Railway which served for many years. Closure Business tailed off again, and the company closed down in 1852. The works were leased by the London and North Western Railway, who then bought it outright in 1860, forming the nucleus of the Earlestown railway works. John Jones and Son One partner, John Jones, however carried on as John Jones and Son with a factory in Liverpool to continue building locomotives, until 1863. The firm continued beyond his death in 1866, making marine boilers and marine steam engines in the St George's Engine Works.\\"Boilers and Engines, Marine\\", Lloyd's List, 30 June 1884, p18 In adverts the firm claimed to have been established in 1832, which is when John Jones dissolved his partnership with William Yates at the Newton-le-Willows Viaduct Foundry. By 1900 the firm was building ships at their yard in Tranmere Bay, such as the steam ferries Lily and Rose built for Wallasey corporation in 1900. In December 1900, noting the decline in shipbuilding in the Mersey area, it was said that Laird Brothers Ltd and John Jones and Sons were the only 2 remaining firms who are in any sense producers of new shipping. During 1900 Messrs John Jones & Sons (of Liverpool and Tranmere) had produced 13 small vessels with an aggregate tonnage of 2802 tons.Lloyd's List, 11 Dec 1900, p10 The ship building facility appears to have been sold to the Tranmere Bay Development Company (formed by Laird Brothers at the end of 1902), but the production of engines at the St George's Engine Works continued. As examples of their production, in 1872 Messrs John Jones & Sons built the 80 nominal HP engines for two screw steamers, Miguel Saenz and Moratin.A Year's shipbuilding on the Mersey, Shipping and Mercantile Gazette, 30 Dec 1872, p2 In 1894 they are noted as producing the boilers for the Dublin Steam Packet \\"Liverpool\\" - at 80 tons the largest boilers ever made in Liverpool.Dundee Evening Telegraph, 20 Feb 1894, p2 Messrs John Jones & Sons of Liverpool built the Eastham Ferry paddle steamers Ruby and Pearl in 1897 and the Sapphire in 1898.The Eastham Ferry Service, Lloyd's List, 22 Nov 1897, p8 These operated until 1929 and were the last paddle steamers on the Mersey.

Out the road is a colloquial term for a region of the City and Borough of Juneau, capital of the U.S. state of Alaska, extending from Auke Bay north to a point roughly 45 miles (72 km) from downtown Juneau to where \\"The Road\\" dead ends at Echo Cove, a natural harbor with a boat ramp, parking lot, and several camping areas. Juneau is accessible only by boat or plane. Out the road is by far the largest percentage of land area of Juneau, but very sparsely populated; in spring 1998, the Juneau Economic Development Council put its population at 1,348. Residents of this region get much less rain than the rest of Juneau, with more sunny days. However, it still rains more than half the year. Houses in the area are usually expensive, many selling in the $500,000 to $1,000,000 range. For most of its length there are no city utility services such as water and sewer lines or connections to the Alaska Electric Light & Power grid, requiring generators, septic tanks, and alternative water sources. \\"The Road\\" is referred to as such simply because it is the only road extending north of Auke Bay. There are two official names recorded: Old Glacier Highway is the name of the root road, and at one point was the name for the entire length. The state government then dubbed the section from Auke Bay to Echo Cove the Veterans Memorial Highway. This name is used by the State, while the City and Borough has retained the name Old Glacier Highway, and continues to publish materials using that name. In 2005, construction started on a seven-mile extension to the road, the first phase of a proposal to increase access to Kensington mine, which lies approximately 13 miles north of the 'End of the Road'. It is slated to become operational in late 2007. Plans in the past have called for the Lynn Canal Highway to continue north from the end of the road to Cascade Point.

Company history Manhattan Records was formed in 1984 by Bruce Lundvall and was later renamed EMI Manhattan Records after absorbing the EMI America Records imprint. EMI Manhattan was used to reissue back catalogue titles from Capitol Records and other EMI labels such as United Artists Records and Liberty Records. It also distributed new albums from Gamble and Huff's Philadelphia International Records during the later half of the 1980s, after a 15-year stint with CBS Records. The deal gave EMI distribution rights to PIR's back catalog from 1976 onward (CBS, later Sony Music, would retain the rights to PIR's catalog up to 1975 and later acquire the rest in 2007). An unrelated late 1970s label also named Manhattan Records was owned and distributed by United Artists Records, which was sold to EMI before its closure in 1980. Notable artists signed to EMI Manhattan included Kenny Rogers, Richard Marx, Natalie Cole, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Queensr√øche, and Thomas Dolby. In 1989, EMI Manhattan was dissolved and absorbed into Capitol Records to become EMI Records USA, with the catalog bearing the EMI label. In 1985 Manhattan Records and Island Records entered into a joint venture to release the U.S. version of Grace Jones' album Slave to the Rhythm. The album used the Manhattan prefix number. In the UK the album was released by ZTT via Island Records with neither Manhattan nor Capitol nor EMI being part of the release. From 1988 to 1992 albums by D'Atra Hicks, Phil Perry, Gary Brown, and Rachelle Ferrell were released under the Capitol Manhattan label. All releases in the U.S. used both the Capitol and Manhattan logos respectively. The vinyl versions (Brown and Ferrell were not released on LP) were still using the original Manhattan Records colored bricks graphics on the record even though the Capitol logo was added. In 2001, the Manhattan label was relaunched (without the EMI prefix) as a division of EMI Classics by veteran record producer Arif Mardin. Richard Marx, one of its flagship artists during the label's heyday, returned to the label upon its revival. In 2006, EMI reorganized its adult music operations and put the Manhattan label under the aegis of the Blue Note Label Group. As of 2013, following the reorganization of labels as a result of Universal Music Group's acquisition of EMI, Manhattan currently operates under the umbrella of the Capitol Music Group.

It was released on their 1980 album Permanent Waves. Composition and recording The song was developed on the band's warm-up tour during soundchecks. \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" uses several time and key signatures, and possesses a dark, ominous feel in its first half. The lyrics are based on a simple concept; a vision of sunlight breaking through storm clouds. The song's title is a reference to the natural phenomenon of the sun breaking through the clouds in visible rays, which in turn was named after the Biblical ladder to heaven on which Jacob saw angels ascending and descending in a vision. Drummer and lyricist Neil Peart said of the song: > Whereas most of the ideas we were dealing with this time were on the lesser > side, and in some cases, like in \\"Jacobs Ladder\\", looked at as a cinematic > idea. We created all the music first to summon up an image ‚Äì the effect of > Jacob's Ladder ‚Äì and paint the picture, with the lyrics added, just as a > sort of little detail, later, to make it more descriptive. Robert Telleria said in the Rush book Merely Players: > Part heavy metal, part New Age, this song is not about the vision seen by > Jacob in the Bible but rather the atmospheric phenomena that has been named > after that image.

Description Camilo Wilson was an author and computer consultant who in 1981 planned to use the new IBM PC to write a book about the computer. One of the first to receive it in California, he purchased IBM's EasyWriter word processor‚Äîa launch title for the PC‚Äîand later said that its \\"horrors ... were such that I decided to write my own ... to get the book done\\". After writing the new application in Pascal in less than four months Wilson borrowed $15,000 to market it, and formed Lifetree Software with his girlfriend. Volkswriter debuted at the spring 1982 West Coast Computer Faire and, as Plainwriter, in a small listing in the first issue of PC Magazine. By the next issue Lifetree described the renamed Volkswriter in a full-page advertisement as \\"a high performance word processor\\" with which \\"you cannot erase data unintentionally\\". EasyWriter was so poor in quality that Volkswriter was for a while, as Andrew Fluegelman wrote in late 1982, \\"the only fully functioning word processor available for the PC\\". To compete with WordStar, which appeared on the PC six weeks after Volkswriter, Wilson emphasized its ease of use. By early 1984 Lifetree had 40,000 customers, $2 million in sales‚Äîabout half to companies‚Äî27 employees, and released an enhanced $295 Volkswriter Deluxe, also ported to the Atari ST running OS-9 and, as GEM Write, to the GEM. The company published versions of the software until May 1989 when due to profitability problems, the Volkswriter product line was sold to employees. The new company formed with the name Volkswriter Inc. Reception Fluegelman of PC Magazine wrote that \\"Like the inspiration for its name, VW doesn't go in for a lot of frills but performs essential functions very well\\". Although criticizing the lack of headers or footers, he stated \\"If I needed to have a novice using a word processor within an hour, Volkswriter would be my choice\\". In a May 1983 review of several IBM PC word processors, BYTE described Volkswriter as \\"simple in design ... quite straightforward to use for minor writing projects ... just enough features to get most jobs done\\".

They achieve high efficiency (typically greater than 90% on the higher heating value) by condensing water vapour in the exhaust gases and so recovering its latent heat of vaporisation, which would otherwise have been wasted. This condensed vapour leaves the system in liquid form, via a drain. In many countries, the use of condensing boilers is compulsory or encouraged with financial incentives. Principles of work In a conventional boiler, fuel is burned and the hot gases produced pass through a heat exchanger where much of their heat is transferred to water, thus raising the water's temperature. One of the hot gases produced in the combustion process is water vapour (steam), which arises from burning the hydrogen content of the fuel. A condensing boiler extracts additional heat from the waste gases by condensing this water vapour to liquid water, thus recovering its latent heat of vaporization. A typical increase of efficiency can be as much as 10-12%. While the effectiveness of the condensing process varies depending on the temperature of the water returning to the boiler, it is always at least as efficient as a non-condensing boiler. The condensate produced is slightly acidic (3-5 pH), so suitable materials must be used in areas where liquid is present. Aluminium alloys and stainless steel are most commonly used at high temperatures. In low temperature areas, plastics are most cost effective (e.g., uPVC and polypropylene). The production of condensate also requires the installation of a heat exchanger condensate drainage system. In a typical installation, this is the only difference between a condensing and non-condensing boiler. To economically manufacture a condensing boiler's heat exchanger (and for the appliance to be manageable at installation), the smallest practical size for its output is preferred. This approach has resulted in heat exchangers with high combustion side resistance, often requiring the use of a combustion fan to move the products through narrow passageways. This has also had the benefit of providing the energy for the flue system as the expelled combustion gases are usually below 100 ¬∞C (212 ¬∞F) and as such, have a density close to air, with little buoyancy. The combustion fan helps to pump exhaust gas to the outside. Usage Condensing boilers are now largely replacing earlier, conventional designs in powering domestic central heating systems in Europe and, to a lesser degree, in North America. The Netherlands was the first country to adopt them broadly.Nefit B.V. In Europe, their installation is strongly advocated by pressure groups and government bodies concerned with reducing energy use. In the United Kingdom, for example, all new gas central-heating boilers fitted in England and Wales since 2005 must be high-efficiency condensing boilers unless there are exceptional circumstances ; the same regulations apply to oil-fired boilers from April 2007 (warm air central heating systems are exempt from these regulations). In the United States, there is a Federal tax credit for the installation of condensing boilers and additional rebates from power companies in some states. In Western Canada, energy suppliers now offer energy rebates when these systems are installed in multi-unit dwellings. The decrease in natural gas prices in North America has resulted in increased retrofitting of existing boiler installations with condensing equipment. Efficiency Condensing boiler manufacturers claim that up to 98% thermal efficiency can be achieved,Viessmann Gas Fired Boilers compared to 70%-80% with conventional designs (based on the higher heating value of fuels). Typical models offer efficiencies around 90%, which brings most brands of condensing gas boiler in to the highest available categories for energy efficiency. In the UK, this is a SEDBUK (Seasonal Efficiency of Domestic Boilers in the UK)Sedbuk Band A efficiency rating, while in North America they typically receive an Eco Logo and/or Energy Star Certification. Boiler performance is based on the efficiency of heat transfer and highly dependent on boiler size/output and emitter size/output. System design and installation are critical. Matching the radiation to the Btu/Hr output of the boiler and consideration of the emitter/radiator design temperatures determines the overall efficiency of the space and domestic water heating system. One reason for an efficiency drop is because the design and/or implementation of the heating system gives return water (heat transfer fluid) temperatures at the boiler of over 55 ¬∞C (131 ¬∞F), which prevents significant condensation in the heat exchanger. Better education of both installers and owners could be expected to raise efficiency towards the reported laboratory values. Natural Resources CanadaOffice of Energy Efficiency, Natural Resources Canada also suggests ways to make better use of these boilers, such as combining space and water heating systems. Some boilers (e.g. Potterton) can be switched between two flow temperatures such as 63 ¬∞C (145 ¬∞F) and 84 ¬∞C (183 ¬∞F), only the former being \\"fully condensing.\\" However, boilers are normally installed with higher flow temperature by default because a domestic hot water cylinder is generally heated to 60 ¬∞C (140 ¬∞F), and this takes too long to achieve with a flow temperature only three degrees higher. Nevertheless, even partial condensing is more efficient than a traditional boiler. Most non-condensing boilers could be forced to condense through simple control changes. Doing so would reduce fuel consumption considerably, but would quickly destroy any mild steel or cast-iron components of a conventional high-temperature boiler due to the corrosive nature of the condensate. For this reason, most condensing boiler heat-exchangers are made from stainless steel or aluminum/silicon alloy. External stainless steel economizers can be retrofitted to non-condensing boilers to allow them to achieve condensing efficiencies. Temperature control valves are used to blend hot supply water into the return to avoid thermal shock or condensation inside of the boiler. The lower the return temperature to the boiler the more likely it will be in condensing mode. If the return temperature is kept below approximately 55 ¬∞C (131 ¬∞F), the boiler should still be in condensing mode making low temperature applications such as radiant floors and even old cast iron radiators a good match for the technology. Most manufacturers of new domestic condensing boilers produce a basic \\"fit all\\" control system that results in the boiler running in condensing mode only on initial heat-up, after which the efficiency drops off. This approach should still exceed that of older models (see the following three documents published by the Building Research Establishment: Information Papers 10-88 and 19-94; General Information Leaflet 74; Digest 339. See also Application Manual AM3 1989: Condensing Boilers by Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers). Control The control of the domestic condensing boiler is crucial to ensuring that it operates in the most economic and fuel efficient way. Almost all have modulating burners. The burners are usually controlled by an embedded system with built-in logic to control the output of the burner to match the load and give best performance. Reliability Condensing boilers are claimed to have a reputation for being less reliable and may also suffer if worked on by installers and plumbers who may not understand their operation.Guardian newspaper: The new boiler that's causing a heated row. 2 April 2005 Claims of unreliability have been contradicted by research carried out by the UK-based Building Research Establishment (see Building Research Establishment). In particular, the problem of 'pluming' arose with early installations of condensing boilers, in which a white plume of condensed vapour (as minuscule droplets) becomes visible at the outlet flue. Although unimportant to boiler operation, visible pluming was an aesthetic issue that caused much opposition to condensing boilers. A more significant issue is the slight (pH 3-4) acidity of the condensate liquid. Where this is in direct contact with the boiler's heat exchanger, particularly for thin aluminium sheet, it may give rise to more rapid corrosion than for traditional non-condensing boilers. Older boilers may also have used thick cast heat exchangers, rather than sheet, which had slower time constants for their response but were also resistant, by their sheer mass, to any corrosion. The acidity of the condensate means that only some materials may be used: stainless steel and aluminium are suitable, mild steel, copper or cast iron are not. Poor design or construction standards may have made the heat exchangers of some early condensing boilers less long-lived. Initial testing and annual monitoring of the heat transfer fluid in condensing boilers with aluminium or stainless steel heat exchangers is highly recommended. Maintenance of a slightly alkaline (pH 8 to 9) liquid with anti- corrosion and buffering agents reduces corrosion of the aluminium heat exchanger. Some professionals believe that the condensate produced on the combustion side of the heat exchanger may corrode an aluminium heat exchanger and shorten boiler life. Statistical evidence is not yet available since condensing boilers with aluminium heat exchangers have not been in use long enough. Building Research Establishment The Building Research Establishment, which is the UK's major research body for the building industry, produced a leaflet on domestic condensing boilers. According to the Building Research Establishment: *modern condensing boilers are as reliable as standard boilers *condensing boilers are no more difficult to service, nor do they require more frequent servicing *servicing is not expensive; the only (minor) additional task is to check the correct function of the condensate drain *condensing boilers are not difficult to install *under all operating conditions, condensing boilers are always more efficient than standard boilers Exhaust The condensate expelled from a condensing boiler is acidic, with a pH between 3 and 4. Condensing boilers require a drainpipe for the condensate produced during operation. This consists of a short length of polymer pipe with a vapour trap to prevent exhaust gases from being expelled into the building. The acidic nature of the condensate may be corrosive to cast iron plumbing, waste pipes and concrete floors but poses no health risk to occupants. A neutralizer, typically consisting of a plastic container filled with marble or limestone aggregate or \\"chips\\" (alkaline) can be installed to raise the pH to acceptable levels. If a gravity drain is not available, then a small condensate pump must also be installed to lift it to a proper drain. The primary and secondary heat exchangers are constructed of materials that will withstand this acidity, typically aluminum or stainless steel. Since the final exhaust from a condensing boiler has a lower temperature than the exhaust from an atmospheric boiler 38 ¬∞C (100 ¬∞F) vs. 204 ¬∞C (400 ¬∞F) a mechanical fan is always required to expel it, with the additional benefit of allowing the use of low-temperature exhaust piping (typically PVC in domestic applications) without insulation or conventional chimney requirements. Indeed, the use of conventional masonry chimney, or metal flue is specifically prohibited due to the corrosive nature of the flue products, with the notable exception of specially rated stainless steel and aluminum in certain models. The preferred/common vent material for most condensing boilers available in North America is PVC, followed by ABS and CPVC. Polymer venting allows for the added benefit of flexibility of installation location including sidewall venting saving unnecessary penetrations of the roof. Cost Condensing boilers are up to 50% more expensive to buy and install than conventional types in the UK and the US. However, , at UK prices the extra cost of installing a condensing instead of conventional boiler should be recovered in around 2‚Äì5 years through lower fuel use (for verification, see the following three documents published by the Building Research Establishment: Information Papers 10-88 and 19-94; General Information Leaflet 74; Digest 339; see also Case studies in Application Manual AM3 1989: Condensing Boilers by Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers), and 2‚Äì5 years at US prices. Exact figures will depend on the efficiency of the original boiler installation, boiler utilisation patterns, the costs associated with the new boiler installation, and how frequently the system is used. The cost of these boilers is dropping as the mass takeup enforced by government takes effect and the manufacturers withdraw older, less efficient models, but production cost is higher than older types as condensing boilers are more complex. The increased complexity of condensing boilers is as follows: *increased size of heat exchanger, or the addition of a second heat exchanger (it is important that the heat exchangers are designed to be resistant to acid attack from the \\"wet\\" flue gases) *The necessity of a fan-assisted flue (as cooler flue gases have less buoyancy). Many non-condensing boilers also have this feature, however *as the cooler flue gases produce condensate, this needs to be drained, and so the boilers are plumbed into a waste or drain With respect to modern boilers, there are no other differences between condensing and non-condensing boilers. Reliability, as well as initial cost and efficiency, affects total cost of ownership. One major independent UK firm of plumbers stated in 2005 that it had made thousands of call-outs to mend condensing boilers, and that the greenhouse gas emissions from its vans were probably greater than the savings made by the shift to eco-conscious boilers. However, the same article points out that the Heating and Hotwater Information Council, together with some installers, have found that modern condensing boilers are just as reliable as standard boilers.

L&YR; locomotive Victoria c.1878-80, designed by Bury and built by the Clarence Foundry in 1847, converted later to Edward Bury established the works in 1826, under the name Edward Bury and Company. He employed James Kennedy as foreman; Kennedy later became a partner. About 1828, the firm moved to bigger premises in Love Lane, Liverpool, known as the Clarence Foundry. Locomotives Their first engine was built in 1830. Called Dreadnought, it ran on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. It was objected to because it was on six wheels and was sold to the Bolton & Leigh Railway. The second, the four-coupled Liverpool, later in 1830, used a cranked driving axle, and was also objected to (by George Stephenson) because the 6 ft diameter wheels were too big. The Bury type However, they refined their designs and the resulting and locomotives quickly became a standard which was emulated by many other manufacturers, becoming known as the \\"Bury type\\". Distinguishing features of these engines were inside horizontal (or near-horizontal) cylinders, inside wrought-iron bar frame, which gave them a light appearance, and the round firebox (D-shaped in plan), with a large domed top surmounted by a safety valve. Railways supplied Thirteen were supplied to the Great Northern Railway (six of them being sub-contracted to William Fairbairn & Sons), and they became the standard classes on the London and Birmingham Railway, the Eastern Counties Railway, the Midland Counties Railway, the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Navigation and Railway Company, the Lancaster and Preston Railway and the North Union Railway. Several were exported to the USA, more than from any other British company except R. Stephenson & Co., and where Bury's \\"bar-frames\\" became standard. The firm had a reputation for good workmanship, cheapness and reliability. Train operating contract In 1836 Edward Bury contracted to run the trains of the London and Birmingham Railway at a farthing per mile per passenger at a speed not to exceed , the L&BR; providing locomotives to Bury's specification. This contract was annulled in July 1839 because of the unexpected growth in traffic and the increased speed required, and Bury acted thereafter as Locomotive Superintendent of the L&BR; in the normal way. The engines he had specified were built by seven different firms, Bury's firm providing 45 of the original stock of 90. Formation of partnership Potteries, Shrewsbury and North Wales train at Abbey Station, Shrewsbury, behind an 1848 Bury, Curtis and Kennedy locomotive In 1842, Bury took Kennedy, Timothy Abraham Curtis and John Vernon as partners, and the company changed its name to Bury, Curtis and Kennedy. Bury continued as Locomotive Superintendent of the London & Birmingham Railway but a few months after it had become part of the London & North Western Railway he resigned in March 1847. In February 1848 he was appointed Locomotive Superintendent of the Great Northern Railway, and in June 1849 became also its general manager. Meanwhile the firm of Bury, Curtis & Kennedy continued building locomotives, some of advanced design which had a great influence on subsequent practice, such as the s for the L&NWR; which led directly to the Bloomers, as well as one-offs such as the gigantic Crampton Liverpool for the L&NWR;, the most powerful locomotive in the world in 1848. Six locomotives were built in 1848 for the LNWR (Southern Division) with 16 in. x 20 in. cylinders, 5 ft. driving wheels, and 3 ft. trailing wheels. Production In all Bury, Curtis and Kennedy's Clarence Foundry built about 415 locomotives, but they produced much else besides, from church bells to iron ships. At its height, the firm employed 1,600 men. Closure The firm lost heavily in making components for the large bascule Blagoveshchensky Bridge over the River Neva at St Petersburg ‚Äî for which the Imperial Russian Government never paid, according to Bury's widow. This, plus a serious decline in the shipbuilding trade in Liverpool led to the firm's closing down in 1851. Preservation Engine No.36 ran from Dublin to Cork, remaining in service until 1874; displayed at the Cork International Exhibition 1902, British Empire Exhibition, Railway Centenary, 1925 and the bi-centenary of the Royal Dublin Society, 1930. Two of the firm's locomotives have been preserved, Furness Railway 0-4-0 No. 3 (nicknamed \\"Old Coppernob\\" or \\"Coppernob\\"), built in 1846, now in the National Railway Museum, York and Great Southern and Western Railway No. 36, built in 1847, now at Cork Kent railway station, Cork, Republic of Ireland.

The book was first published in 1963 in London by William Heinemann under the pseudonym Joseph Kell. The series began with the publication in 1963 of Inside Mr. Enderby, continued in 1968 with Enderby Outside and 1974 with The Clockwork Testament, or Enderby's End, and concluded after a ten-year break in 1984 with Enderby's Dark Lady, or No End to Enderby. Plot summary The story opens on a note of pure fantasy, showing school children from the future taking a field trip through time to see the dyspeptic poet Francis Xavier Enderby while he is asleep. Enderby, a lapsed Catholic in his mid-40s, lives alone in Brighton as a 'professional' poet - his income being interest from investments left to him by his stepmother. Enderby composes his poetry whilst seated on the toilet. His bathtub, which serves as a filing cabinet, is almost full of the mingled paper and food scraps that represent his efforts. Although he is recognised as a minor poet with several published works (and is even awarded a small prize, the 'Goodby Gold Medal', which he refuses), he has yet to be anthologised. He is persuaded to leave his lonely but poetically fruitful bachelor life by the editor of a woman's magazine, Vesta Bainbridge, after he accidentally sends her a love poem instead of a complaint about a recipe in her magazine. The marriage, which soon ends, costs Enderby dearly, alienating him from his muse and depriving him of his financial independence. Months pass, and Enderby is able to write only one more poem. After spending what remains of his capital, he attempts suicide with an overdose of aspirin, experiencing disgusting (and rather funny) visions of his stepmother as he nears death. His cries of horror bring help, and he regains consciousness in a mental institution, where the doctors persuade him to renounce his old, \\"immature\\" poetry-writing self. Rechristened \\"Piggy Hogg\\", he looks forward contentedly to a new career as a bartender.

This space has the important property that the Fourier transform is an automorphism on this space. This property enables one, by duality, to define the Fourier transform for elements in the dual space \\\\mathcal{S}^* of \\\\mathcal{S}, that is, for tempered distributions. A function in the Schwartz space is sometimes called a Schwartz function. A two-dimensional Gaussian function is an example of a rapidly decreasing function. Schwartz space is named after French mathematician Laurent Schwartz. Definition  Motivation  The idea behind the Schwartz space is to consider the set of all smooth functions on \\\\mathbb{R}^n which decrease rapidly. This is encoded by considering all possible derivatives D^\\\\alpha f=\\\\partial_{x_1}^{\\\\alpha_1}\\\\cdots\\\\partial_{x_n}^{\\\\alpha_n} f (with multi-index \\\\alpha) on a smooth complex-valued function f:\\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} and the supremum of all possible values of D^\\\\alpha f multiplied by any monomial x^\\\\beta and bounding them. This restriction is encoded as the inequality > \\\\sup_{x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n}x^\\\\beta D^\\\\alpha f < \\\\infty Notice if we only required the derivatives to be bounded, i.e., > \\\\sup_{x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n} D^\\\\alpha f < \\\\infty this would imply all possible derivatives of a smooth function must be bounded by some constant c_\\\\alpha, so > \\\\sup_{x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n} D^\\\\alpha f = c_\\\\alpha < \\\\infty For example, the smooth complex-valued function f \\\\in C^\\\\infty(\\\\mathbb{R}) with f(x) = x^2 gives D^1f(x) = 2x, which is an unbounded function, so any polynomial could not be in this space. But, if we require in addition the original inequality, then this result is even stronger because it implies the inequality > D^\\\\alpha f < \\\\frac{k_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta}}{x^\\\\beta} for any \\\\beta and some > constant k_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta} since > x^\\\\beta\\\\cdot D^\\\\alpha f < x^\\\\beta\\\\cdot \\\\frac{k_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta}}{x^\\\\beta} = > k_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta} This demonstrates the growth of all derivatives of f must be far lesser than the inverse of any monomial.  Definition  Let \\\\mathbb{N} be the set of non-negative integers, and for any n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, let \\\\mathbb{N}^n := \\\\underbrace{\\\\mathbb{N} \\\\times \\\\dots \\\\times \\\\mathbb{N}}_{n \\\\text{ times}} be the n-fold Cartesian product. The Schwartz space or space of rapidly decreasing functions on \\\\mathbb{R}^n is the function space > S \\\\left(\\\\mathbb{R}^n, \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\right) := \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ f \\\\in > C^\\\\infty(\\\\mathbb{R}^n, \\\\mathbb{C}) \\\\mid \\\\forall \\\\alpha, \\\\beta > \\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}^n, \\\\f\\\\_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta} < \\\\infty\\\\right \\\\\\\\}, where C^{\\\\infty}(\\\\mathbb{R}^n, \\\\mathbb{C}) is the function space of smooth functions from \\\\mathbb{R}^n into \\\\mathbb{C}, and > \\\\f\\\\_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta}:= \\\\sup_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^n} \\\\left x^\\\\alpha (D^{\\\\beta} > f)(x) \\\\right. Here, \\\\sup denotes the supremum, and we use multi-index notation. To put common language to this definition, one could consider a rapidly decreasing function as essentially a function f(x) such that f(x), f ‚Ä≤(x), f‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(x), ... all exist everywhere on R and go to zero as x ‚Üí ¬±‚àû faster than any inverse power of x. In particular, S(Rn, C) is a subspace of the function space C‚àû(Rn, C) of smooth functions from Rn to C. Examples of functions in the Schwartz space * If Œ± is a multi-index, and a is a positive real number, then ::x^\\\\alpha e^{-a x^2} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\mathbf{R}^n). * Any smooth function f with compact support is in S(Rn). This is clear since any derivative of f is continuous and supported in the support of f, so (xŒ±DŒ≤) f has a maximum in Rn by the extreme value theorem. * Because the Schwarz space is a vector space, any polynomial \\\\phi(x^\\\\alpha) can by multiplied by a factor e^{-ax^2} for a > 0 a real constant, to give an element of the Schwarz space.

They form the second largest community of the Armenian diaspora after Armenians in Russia. The first major wave of Armenian immigration to the United States took place in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Thousands of Armenians settled in the United States following the Hamidian massacres of the mid-1890s, the Adana Massacre of 1909, and the Armenian Genocide of 1915 in the Ottoman Empire. Since the 1950s many Armenians from the Middle East (especially from Lebanon, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Egypt and Turkey) migrated to America as a result of political instability in the region. It accelerated in the late 1980s and has continued after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 due to socio-economic and political reasons. The 2017 American Community Survey estimated that 485,970 Americans held full or partial Armenian ancestry. Various organizations and media criticize these numbers as an underestimate, proposing 800,000 to 1,500,000 Armenian Americans instead. The highest concentration of Americans of Armenian descent is in the Greater Los Angeles area, where 166,498 people have identified themselves as Armenian to the 2000 Census, comprising over 40% of the 385,488 people who identified Armenian origins in the US at the time. The city of Glendale in the Los Angeles metropolitan area is widely thought to be the center of Armenian American life (although many Armenians live in the aptly named \\"Little Armenia\\" municipality of Los Angeles). The Armenian American community is the most politically influential community of the Armenian diaspora. Organizations such as Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) and Armenian Assembly of America advocate for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the United States government and support stronger Armenia‚ÄìUnited States relations. The Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU) is known for its financial support and promotion of Armenian culture and Armenian language schools. History  Early history  The first recorded Armenian to visit North America was Martin the Armenian from Iran. He was an Iranian Armenian tobacco grower who settled in Jamestown, Virginia in 1618. In 1653‚Äì54, two Armenians from Constantinople were invited to Virginia to raise silk worms. A few other Armenians are recorded as having come to the US in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but most moved as individuals and did not establish communities. By the 1770s over 70 Armenians had settled in the colonies. The persecution of Christian minorities under the Ottoman Empire and American missionary activities resulted in a small wave of Armenian migration to the US in the 1830s from Cilicia and Western Armenia. Hatchik (Christopher) Oscanyan, a Constantinople American missionary school student, arrived in America in 1835 to pursue higher education. He later worked for the New York Herald Tribune and became the New York Press Club president. Many Armenians followed him and went to the US for education. During the Civil War three Armenian doctors--Simeon Minasian, Garabed Galstian, and Baronig Matevosian--worked at military hospitals in Philadelphia. The only Armenian known to have participated in hostilities was Khachadour Paul Garabedian, who enlisted in the Union Navy. A naturalized citizen from Rodosto, Garabedian served aboard the blockade ships USS Geranium and USS Grand Gulf as a Third Assistant Engineer and later an officer from 1864 until his honorable discharge from the Navy in August 1865. An Armenian family in Boston, 1908 The number of Armenians rose from 20 in 1854 to around 70 by the 1870s. In the late 1870s, small Armenian communities existed in New York City, Providence, Rhode Island, and Worcester, Massachusetts. By the late 1880s, their number reached 1,500. Many of them were young male students of the American Evangelical Missions spread throughout the Ottoman Empire. About 40% came from the Province of Kharpert. Before 1899, immigrants were not classified by ethnicity, but rather by country of birth, obscuring the ethnic origins of many Armenians. After 1869, however, Armenians from the eastern regions of the Ottoman Empire were registered as \\"Armenian\\" in American records. The number of Armenians who migrated to the US from 1820 to 1898 is estimated to be around 4,000. First wave of immigration and the Interwar period Armenians began to arrive in the US in unprecedented numbers in the late nineteenth century, most notably after the Hamidian Massacres of 1894‚Äì96, and before, during and after the Armenian Genocide. Before this mass migration to the US, the number of Armenians in the country was from 1,500 to 3,000, and mostly consisted of unskilled laborers. Over 12,000 Armenians from the Ottoman Empire went to the US throughout the 1890s. This period witnessed cultural contact between American and Armenian through Armenian nationalist dissident organizations within the Ottoman Empire and intense activity of American missionaries in the region who were sympathetic to the Armenian cause, making the long road of migration somewhat more bearable. With the exception of Fresno, California, which had land suitable for farming, the earliest Armenian immigrants mostly settled in the northeastern industrial centers, such as New York City, Providence, Worcester, and Boston. Armenian emigrants from the Russian Empire were only a minority in emigration from Armenian lands across the Atlantic (about 2,500 moved in 1898‚Äì1914), because Armenians were treated relatively better in Russia than in the Ottoman Empire. Once in America, some Armenians organized political parties to serve various causes in America and in the homeland. Turkish Armenian migration rose gradually in the first decade of the 20th century, partly due to the Adana Massacre of 1909, and the Balkan Wars in 1912‚Äì1913. Before the start of the World War I, there were already 60,000 Armenians in the US. As more Armenians fell victim to the genocide and more Armenians were deported, the Armenian American community grew dramatically. Church of Our Savior in Worcester, Massachusetts was the first Armenian church in the US. According to the Bureau of Immigration, 54,057 Armenians entered the US between 1899 and 1917. The top listed countries of origin were Turkey (46,474), Russia (3,034), Canada (1,577), Great Britain (914) and Egypt (894). Immigrants were asked to indicate which state they were going to settle in; for Armenians, the most popular answers were New York (17,391), Massachusetts (14,192), Rhode Island (4,923), Illinois (3,313), California (2,564), New Jersey (2,115), Pennsylvania (2,002), Michigan (1,371). The largest Armenian American communities at that time were located in New York City; Fresno; Worcester, Massachusetts; Boston; Philadelphia; Chicago; Jersey City; Detroit; Los Angeles; Troy, New York; and Cleveland. According to estimates, around 77,980 Armenians lived in the US by 1919. An unprecedented number of Armenians entered the country in 1920, but the Immigration Act of 1924 that restricted immigration from southern and eastern Europe barred many other Armenians from emigrating to the US. Most of the post-World War I immigrants were women and children, in contrast to the prewar immigration, which was predominantly young and male. Like Italians, for whom this practice was known as campanilismo, Armenian communities were often formed by people from the same village or town in the Ottoman Empire. This practice almost entirely disappeared after World War II. In total, 81,729 Armenians entered the US from 1899 to 1931. Discrimination toward Armenians was visible, and many Armenians struggled against overt discriminatory and housing restrictions. Although four Ottoman- born Armenians were the first ones to get the legal recognition as \\"whites\\" - instead of \\"Asiatics\\" - as early as 1909, the discrimination most Armenians faced in their day-to day life didn't get any better. The Armenians living in central California were often referred to by natives as \\"Fresno Indians\\" and \\"lower class Jews.\\" This first wave of immigration lasted until the mid-1920s, when the new immigration quotas were passed. This wave of immigrants established Armenian communities and organizations in the US, most notably the Armenian Apostolic Church. In the 1920s, Armenians began to move from rural regions to cities. Second wave of immigration Armenian American dancers in New York City in July 1976 during the United States Bicentennial A new wave of Armenian immigrants moved in the late 1940s, including Soviet Armenian prisoners of war who were able to make their way westward after being freed from Nazi camps. The Displaced Persons Act of 1948 allowed people displaced during the World War II to immigrate to the US. From 1944 to 1952, 4,739 Armenians migrated to the US, many with the help of George Mardikian's American National Committee to Aid Homeless Armenians (ANCHA). However, the true second wave of immigration did not begin until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 abolished national origins quotas. After the passage of that act, Armenians from the Soviet Union, Turkey, Lebanon, Iran and other Middle Eastern countries began migrating in large numbers, many fleeing political instability in their host countries. In the 1950s, most Armenian immigrants in the US were from Soviet Armenia and Turkey. The Istanbul pogrom in 1955 frightened the local Turkish Armenian population, which looked to the West for a safe and more prosperous life. Soviet Armenians, on the other hand, were mostly genocide survivors who never fully integrated into Soviet life after their repatriation in the 1940s. The large-scale emigration of Soviet Armenians, mainly to Western countries, began in 1956. About 30,000 Soviet Armenians entered the country from 1960 to 1984, and another 60,000 moved throughout the late 1980s, during the Perestroika era. The total number of Soviet Armenian emigrants from 1956 to 1989, over 80% of them to the US, is estimated at 77,000. The 15-year-long Lebanese Civil War that started in 1975 and the Iranian revolution of 1979 greatly contributed to the influx of Middle Eastern Armenians to the US. The Armenian communities in these Middle Eastern countries were well established and integrated, but not assimilated, into local populations. Armenians in Lebanon and Iran are even represented in the parliaments as ethnic minorities. Many lived in luxury in their former countries, and more easily handled multilingualism, while retaining aspects of traditional Armenian culture. This wave of newcomers revitalized the Armenian American community, especially in the Los Angeles area, where most second-wave Armenian immigrants settled. In 1970 about 65,000 Armenians resided in Southern California, and two decades later, in 1989, the number of Armenian Americans was estimated at 200,000. Although the 1980 US Census put the number of Armenians living in Los Angeles at 52,400, of which 71.9% were foreign born: 14.7% in Iran, 14.3% in the USSR, 11.5% in Lebanon, 9.7% in Turkey, 11.7% in other Middle Eastern countries (Egypt, Iraq, Palestine, etc.), and the rest in other parts of the world.  Contemporary period  Immediately before and continuing into the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, waves of Armenians from Armenia and other former Soviet republics arrived for political reasons and economic opportunities, settling in older established Armenian communities across the country. The 1988 Armenian earthquake and the energy crisis in Armenia during the Nagorno-Karabakh War caused an estimated number of 700,000 Armenians to leave the country, most of whom ended up in Russia, still others in the US, and some in Europe. Annually, on average 2,000 people from Armenia migrated to the US since 1994, not including ethnic Armenians from Middle Eastern countries. According to the 2000 US Census, there were 65,280 Armenian-born people in the US: 57,482 in California, 1,981 in New York and 1,155 in Massachusetts. According to the 2011 American Community Survey, there were 85,150 Armenian-born people in the US, about 20,000 more than in 2000. According to the US embassy in Yerevan, about 21,000 citizens of Armenia have moved to the US for permanent residency in the period from 1995 to 2012. Meanwhile, Armenian immigration from the Middle East continues, contributing to California's distinction of having, by far, the highest Armenian American population of any state. According to Dr. Anny Bakalian, Associate Director of the Middle East Center at the City University of New York, \\"country of birth and childhood socialization, generation, and even cohort effect are important variables in understanding the behavior and attitudes of people of Armenian descent\\". The main subgroups of foreign-born Armenian Americans are Hayastantsis (Armenians from Armenia), Parskayes (Armenians from Iran) and Beirutsis (Armenians from Beirut, Lebanon). A 1990 University of California, Los Angeles study showed that by education and occupation, native-born and Iranian-born Armenians \\"tend to have the highest socioeconomic status... while those from Turkey have the lowest\\", although Turkish Armenians boast the highest rate of self-employment. In 1988, The New York Times article claimed that Middle Eastern Armenians prefer to settle in Glendale, California, while Armenian immigrants from the Soviet Union were attracted to Hollywood, Los Angeles. Armenians from Lebanon, where they had effectively established an active community, are more politicized, while Turkish Armenians are mostly connected with the Armenian Apostolic Church. About 1/3 of all Turkish Armenians in America are self-employed. A group of Armenian Americans from Istanbul founded the Organization of Istanbul Armenians (OIA) in 1976, which claimed over 1,000 members in Southern California as of 2011. Iranian Armenians are known for fast integration into American society; for example, only 31% of Armenian Americans born in Iran claim not to speak English well. Armenian American criminal organizations have received widespread media attention, such as during the 2010 Medicaid fraud. However, in the city of Glendale, California, where Armenians compose 27% of city's total population, only 17% of the crime in the city were committed by Armenians in 2006. According to the 2000 US Census, there were 385,488 Americans of Armenian ancestry at that time. The 2017 American Community Survey estimate found 485,970 Americans with full or partial Armenian ancestry. Higher estimates of 800,000 to 1,500,000 are offered by many Armenian and non-Armenian organizations, media and scholars. The German ethnographer Caroline Thon puts their number at 800,000, a number also offered by Dr. Harold Takooshian of Fordham University. Prof. Dennis R. Papazian of University of Michigan‚ÄìDearborn claimed that there were 1,000,000 people of Armenian ancestry living in the US. Armenian Mirror-Spectator the German news website Spiegel Online and The New York Review of Books reported the estimate of 1,200,000, while the World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples, U.S. News & World Report, and Los Angeles Times put the number at 1,400,000. The Armenian National Committee of America, The Armenian Weekly, The Armenian Reporter, and Reuters offer the highest number, at around 1,500,000 Armenian Americans. 467,890 people have reported Armenian ancestry for American Community Survey. 2,516 Armenians were naturalized, and an additional total of 3,543 obtained lawful permanent residence the same year. Of the latter, 1,589 achieved this status through family reunification, 1,286 through diversity lottery, 304 through family sponsorship, 256 as refugees or asylees, 102 through employment, and 6 through other unspecified categories Geographic distribution Distribution of Armenians in Los Angeles County, 2000. Most Armenian Americans are concentrated in major urban areas, especially in California and the Northeast, and to a lesser extent in the Midwest. The highest concentrations of Americans of Armenian ancestry are in Los Angeles, New York and Boston. According to the 2000 Census, the states with largest Armenian populations were California (204,631), Massachusetts (28,595), New York (24,460), New Jersey (17,094), Michigan (15,746), Florida (9,226), Pennsylvania (8,220), Illinois (7,958), Rhode Island (6,677) and Texas (4,941). California The first Armenian arrived in California in 1874 and settled in Fresno.Nectar Davidian, The Seropians (Berkeley, 1965). p. iii; Bishop Mushegh Seropian [Serobian], ed., Amerikahay Taretsuytse 1912 [American Armenian Almanac] vol. 1. Boston: Kilikia Tparan, 1913, p. 56. Fresno and the Central Valley in general were the center of California Armenian community, but in the later decades, especially since the 1960s, when significant number of Middle Eastern Armenians arrived in the US, Southern California attracted more and more Armenians. Los Angeles and the surrounding area is, by far, the most crowded Armenian community in the US. It holds a little less than half of all Armenians living in the US, making it one of the most populous Armenian communities outside of Armenia. The estimated numbers of Armenians of Southern California vary greatly: 250,000,Kouymjian, 2000 \\"... and particularly Los Angeles, which alone has nearly a quarter of a million Armenians in places like Hollywood, Glendale, and Pasadena.\\" 350,000, 400,000, 450,000, 500,000, although the 2000 census reported 152,910 Armenians in Los Angeles County. Just eleven years later, the 2011 American Community Survey one-year estimates put the number of Armenians in Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana area 214,618, about 29% growth from 2000. The city of Los Angeles itself had an Armenian population of 64,997 in 2000. Several districts of Los Angeles have high concentrations of Armenians, particularly in San Fernando Valley: North Hollywood, Van Nuys and Encino. On October 6, 2000, a small community in East Hollywood was named Little Armenia by the Los Angeles City Council. The city council file on the adoption states that \\"the area contains a high concentration of Armenian businesses and residents and social and cultural institutions including schools, churches, social and athletic organizations.\\" Glendale, California has the highest concentration of Armenians in the nation and the highest outside of Armenia. Glendale, just a few miles away from Downtown Los Angeles, has a population of about 200,000, of which, according to some estimates, 40% is Armenian. According to the 2000 Census 53,840 people or 27% of the population identified themselves Armenian in Glendale. Glendale also home to the highest percentage of people born in Armenia. Other than Glendale and Los Angeles proper, significant Armenian populations reside in Burbank (8,312), Pasadena (4,400), Montebello (2,736), Altadena (2,134), La Crescenta-Montrose (1,382). The Armenian Genocide Martyrs Monument, the oldest and largest Armenian Genocide memorial in the US, is located in Montebello. Dr. Seta Kazandjian described the community in her 2006 dissertation as follows: Fresno, California was the first major Armenian community in the Western US. It was a major destination for early Armenian immigrants from the Ottoman Armenia, many of whom were engaged in agriculture. Armenians were the largest minority group in Fresno County. The city is also widely known as the birthplace of William Saroyan, many of whose stories are set there. Today, an estimated number of about 40,000 Armenian live in Fresno. According to the 2000 Census 9,884 Armenians lived in Fresno County at the time. The area around the Holy Trinity Church is called Old Armenian Town. The Northern Californian Armenian population is not as populous as the Southern portion of the state. Armenians are mostly concentrated in and around the cities of San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland. The 2000 Census reported only 2,528 Armenians in San Francisco, but Hayk The Ubiquitous Armenian, stated \\"the actual number is probably much higher since the census is usually lower than actuals.\\" Northeast Since the 19th century the first Armenians appeared in New York. The states of New York and Massachusetts were top destinations for Armenian immigrants in the early twentieth century. The area between East 20th Street, Lexington Avenue and First Avenue, where a compact Armenian population lived and Armenian shops existed, was called \\"Little Armenia\\" until the 1960s. The area was mentioned in 1914 book Our Mr. Wren: The Romantic Adventures of a Gentle Man by Sinclair Lewis (the 1930 Nobel Prize Winner). Today, according to estimates there are 150,000 Armenians in the Tri-State area. Queens is home to some 50,000 Armenian Americans, Manhattan has 10,000 Armenian population centered in Gramercy Park, Kips Bay and Murray Hill, where St. Vartan Armenian Cathedral is. The Armenian Heritage Park in downtown Boston Stepan Zadori, a Hungarian Armenian, is the first known Armenian to come to Boston, The Armenian community in Boston was not founded until the 1880s. Today, estimates say that Armenians number from 50,000 to 70,000 in the Greater Boston area. The Armenian Heritage Park, dedicated to the victims of the Armenian Genocide, was opened in downtown Boston on May 22, 2012. Watertown, Massachusetts is the center of Boston Armenians, where according to estimates about 8,000 people of Armenian origin reside, though the 2000 Census put the number only at 2,708. Worcester, Massachusetts was also a major center for Armenian immigrants in the early part of the twentieth century. The Armenian Library and Museum of America is located in Watertown. The National Association for Armenian Studies and Research (NAASR) is located in Belmont, and \\"starting in early 2018, NAASR will undertake top-to-bottom renovations...to transform it into a welcoming hub and first-class Armenian Studies research center for scholars and myriad others, Armenians and non-Armenians alike.\\" Other towns in the area with significant Armenian populations are Worcester (1,306), Belmont (1,165), Waltham (1,091) and the city of Boston (1,080). Other major northeastern cities with significant Armenian populations include Philadelphia and Providence. Like other Armenian communities in America, Armenian communities in these cities have their roots in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Currently, Philadelphia holds about 15,000 Armenian American population and over 7,000 live in Providence. There is also a small Armenian community in Portland, Maine; this community was founded in 1896 and is currently represented by the Armenian Cultural Association of Maine (ACAME). One of the ACAME's first projects (in 2003) was to build a monument dedicated to the victims of the Armenian Genocide, located at the intersection of Cumberland Avenue and Franklin Arterial in Portland. Other communities Other sizable Armenian American communities exist in the Midwest and in the South, but in much smaller numbers than the Northeastern states and California. The early Armenian immigrants in Detroit were mostly laborers. In later decades, particularly since the 1960s Middle Eastern Armenians immigrated to Michigan. The Armenian community has been described as \\"highly educated, professional and prospering.\\" Today, they number about 22,000. Chicago's Armenians also first settled in the city in the late 19th century in small numbers, but it increased through the 20th century, reaching about 25,000 by today. As of 2003 more than 8,000 Armenian Americans lived in Washington, DC. The Armenian Genocide Museum of America is also located in the capital. Since the turn of the century there been a trend towards an increase in number of Armenians living outside of traditional settlement areas. For instance, the number of Armenians in Nevada increased from 2,880 in 2000 to 5,845 in 2010, Florida from 9,226 to 15,856, and Texas from 4,941 to 14,459. Culture In Glendale, California crosswalk warnings in Spanish, English and Armenian were stenciled at several intersections in 2011. Language As of 2000, 53% of the Armenians living in the US speak the Armenian language. For comparison, about 6% of Italian Americans, 32% of Greek Americans and 70% of Albanian Americans speak their ancestral language. The Armenian language has two distinct standardized forms: Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian, both widely spoken among the Armenian American community. Armenians from Lebanon, Turkey, Syria and few other countries speak the Western dialect, which was spoken in Turkish (Western) Armenia, the eastern regions of Turkey with historical Armenian presence. Eastern Armenian is primarily spoken in Armenia and Iran, though the Iranian Armenians have their own dialect; in the United States, speakers of Eastern Armenian are primarily immigrants from the former Soviet Union who mostly arrived during the 1990s, or their children. Furthermore, Western and Eastern Armenian use two different spellings. In Armenia, the reformed orthography is used, while most Armenians in the diaspora (including Lebanon, Syria, Turkey and Iran) use the classical orthography. Between 1910 and 1970, the language of only the foreign-born population in the United States was taken into account. In 1910, the number of Armenian speakers in the US was 23,938. It grew up to 37,647 in 1920, 51,741 in 1930, 40,000 in 1940, 37,270 in 1960 and 38,323 in 1970. According to the 1980 US Census 100,634 people in the nation spoke Armenian, 69,995 of them were foreign-born. The 1990 US Census revealed 308,096 people of Armenian ancestry at the time and 149,694 people who indicated Armenian as their native language. A majority of Armenian-speakers (115,017) were foreign-born. According to the 2000 US Census there were 385,488 ethnic Armenians living in the US, and 202,708 people identified Armenian as 'Language Spoken at Home'. The overwhelming majority of Armenian-speakers lived in California (155,237). Other states with significant number of Armenian-speakers were New York (8,575) and Massachusetts (8,091). About 2/3 of Armenians speakers call Los Angeles County home. The 2009-2013 American Community Survey estimates put the number of Armenian-speakers at 237,840. A 2007 study showed that 16% of Armenians born in Lebanon, 29% in Armenia (including Soviet Armenia), 31% in Iran and 36% in Turkey are not proficient in English. Many foreign-born Armenians are multilingual, speaking at least one language other than Armenian and English. For instance, Armenians from Armenia or the rest of the former Soviet Union might know Russian, those from Lebanon and Syria may know Arabic and French, almost all Iranian Armenians speak Persian and Istanbul Armenians speak Turkish. A 1999 paper delivered by Bert Vaux described Armenian as \\"severely endangered\\" in the United States. Rose and Alex Pilibos Armenian School in Little Armenia neighborhood of East Hollywood is one of the largest Armenian schools in the US with more than 500 students. Education Early Armenian immigrants were one of the most literate ethnic groups to enter the US with 76% literacy. In comparison, 46% of southern Italians, 74% of Eastern European Jews and 99% of Finns were literate. As of 2007, 41% of US-born Armenians had at least a 4-year college degree. The rate is lower for foreign- born Armenians. The first Armenian Sunday school in the US was founded in the late 1880s in New York by Barsegh Vardukyan. Since the 1960s many Armenian bilingual schools have been established in communities throughout the country. Ferrahian Armenian School, founded in 1964, is the oldest Armenian daily school in America. Besides this, there are over one hundred Armenian schools that operate on weekends only. Mashdots College in Glendale, founded in 1992, is the only Armenian higher education institution in the country. Armenian Americans constitute a highly educated community. Of the 339,732 Armenian Americans who are 25 or above, 26% are with a college degree, and 26,1% hold a bachelor's degree. Religion Most Armenian Americans are adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church, the largest Oriental Orthodox church in the US. It possess over 90 churches throughout the nation. It was reported that 80% of Armenian Americans are Armenian Apostolic, 10% are Protestant (mostly Armenian Evangelical) and 3% are Armenian Catholic. The Armenian Apostolic Church is the oldest national church in the world, and had a major role in protecting the Armenian identity through the centuries of foreign domination. Many Armenian communities in the country are concentrated around churches that serve as community centers. The first Armenian Apostolic church in America, named Church of Our Savior, was built in 1891 in Worcester. The American Diocese of the Church was established in 1898 by Catholicos Mkrtich Khrimian. In 1916 there were 34 Armenian parishes with 27,450 members with a predominantly male population. The top states with Armenian church followers were Massachusetts, Michigan, California and New York. The Western Diocese was established in 1927. St. Vartan Cathedral in midtown Manhattan After the Soviets took over Armenia in 1920, the Armenian American community was divided into two camps: one supporting Soviet Armenia (mostly members of the Hunchak and Ramgavar parties), another one against it (mostly made up of ARF members). During the 1933 World's Fair, Leon Tourian, the primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church of America, refused to give a speech because the Armenian tricolor of the 1918-1920 Republic was hanging behind him, while Etchmiadzin, the seat of the Catholicos of All Armenians, was in Armenia that was then part of the Soviet Union and used a different flag. This upset the Dashnak members present in the ceremony. The conflict reached a crisis on December 24, 1933, when several members of ARF assassinated Archbishop Tourian during the Christmas Eve service in New York's Holy Cross Armenian Apostolic Church. On October 12, 1957, during the peak of the Cold War, a number of parishes of the Armenian Apostolic Church in America, which were unaffiliated since 1933, came together under the Holy See of Cilicia with the headquarters in Lebanon, close to the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. After the World War II, Archbishop Tiran Nersoyan led the church through a second founding, which saw the framing of by-laws to govern the diocese, the creation of a nationwide youth organization. the initiation of a project to build an Armenian cathedral in Manhattan and the entry of the Armenian Church into the ecumenical movement. The middle 1950s saw an uptick in immigration and a building boom of Armenian churches, with new communities proliferating across the US. A generation of leaders born in America also began to exert itself. The first American-born Armenian priest was ordained in 1956. In 1961, St. Nersess Armenian Seminary was established in Illinois (later, it would move to New York). A spirit of renewed vigor was embodied by Archbishop Torkom Manoogian, who governed the diocese as primate from 1966 to 1990. The period saw a large influx of Armenian immigrants. These developments refocused the priorities of the Armenian Church in America. The need for humanitarian relief to the Armenian homeland, as well as outreach to refugees settling throughout the US (concentrated in New York and Los Angeles), led to the creation of the Fund for Armenian Relief‚Äîthrough which the church delivers material and medical aid to Armenia. Today, more than 120 Armenian parish communities exist on the continent, with two-thirds operating as fully organized churches with sanctuaries. Archbishop Khajag Barsamian is primate of the Eastern Diocese (since 1990); Archbishop Hovnan Derderian of the Western Diocese (since 2003). The dioceses maintain strong connections to the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, and the current Supreme Patriarch, Karekin II, the 132nd Catholicos of All Armenians. Armenian Evangelical form the second largest denomination among Armenian Americans, with 1 out of 10 being a follower. As of 1993 there were 28 Armenian Protestant Churches. A small number of Armenian Americans are followers of the Armenian Catholic Church. Their number is estimated to be around 25,000. In 1990 there were 6 Armenian Catholic Churches in the United States. Media The first Armenian-language newspaper in the US, named Aregak (‘±÷Ä’•’£’°’Ø, \\"Sun\\"), was published in Jersey City in 1888. Over 300 newspapers have been published since then. Today, numerous Armenian newspapers (both in Armenian and English) are published throughout the country. Asbarez (‘±’Ω’∫’°÷Ä’ß’¶, \\"Arena\\") is the only daily, published in Los Angeles since 1908. Hairenik (’Ä’°’µ÷Ä’•’∂’´÷Ñ, \\"Fatherland\\") is published since 1899 in Boston. Both are affiliated with the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. Other notable weeklies include The Armenian Weekly, Armenian Mirror-Spectator, Nor Hayastan (’Ü’∏÷Ä ’Ä’°’µ’°’Ω’ø’°’∂, \\"New Armenia\\"), The Armenian Reporter. Traditions Armenian cuisine, and Middle Eastern cuisine in general, is popular among Armenian Americans. A number of restaurants function in the Los Angeles area and other locations with high concentration of Armenian- Americans. Zankou Chicken, a family-owned chain of Armenian and Middle-Eastern fast casual restaurants within the Los Angeles area, is among the most famous Armenian restaurants. Tens of amateur Armenian folk dance ensembles have been founded in the United States in the last decades. Homenetmen, an Armenian Revolutionary Federation-affiliated sports organization, is very active in the United States, also engaged in scouting. The Western US branch of Homenetmen holds the Navasartian Games in the Los Angeles area every summer since 1975. Today, it brings together more than 6,000 athletes from 300 teams, 2,000 scouts. More than 35,000 people come to watch the event. Politics Armenian National Committee of America headquarters in Washington Early period The three major Armenian political parties of the late 19th century and early 20th century ‚Äî the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutyun), Social Democrat Hunchakian Party (Hunchak) and Armenakan Party (later Ramgavar) were present in America not too long after their foundation. They established their own newspapers: Hairenik and Asbarez by Dashnaks and Baikar by Ramgavars. After the Bolsheviks took over Armenia in 1920, Ramgavars and Hunchaks formed a coalition supporting Soviet Armenia, while the ARF, the ruling party of the Republic of Armenia from 1918 to 1920, remained anti-Soviet in the diaspora. The 1988 Spitak earthquake and the Karabakh movement brought the separate groups of the Armenian community together. Armenian lobby The Armenian American community has been described as the \\"most influential\\" Armenian community in the world, though smaller in size than the one in Russia. The Armenian American lobby is one of the most powerful ethnic lobbies in the US,Brzezinski, Zbigniew. \\"A Dangerous Exemption.\\" Foreign Policy 1 July 2006: 63. It is today considered to be the second most powerful ethnic lobby in America after the Jewish lobby. The Armenian Assembly of America (AAA) and the Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) have as their main lobbying agenda the pressing of Congress and the US President for the reduction of economic and military assistance to Turkey and efforts to include reaffirmation of a genocide by Ottoman Turkey in 1915.Cameron, Fraser United States foreign policy after the Cold War The Armenian-American'lobby, Routledge 2002 p.91 According to one scholar, the political clout of the Armenian community in the United States \\"countervails the powerful big-oil lobby in Washington that promotes Azeri interests.\\" According to Shawn Dorman, the author of Inside a U.S. embassy, the main goal of Armenian lobby is the \\"persuasion of US Congress to favor Armenian interests, especially to recognize the Armenian Genocide.\\" He then claims that \\"it had significant role in the United States providing financial support to Armenia. From 1992 to 2010 the US provided nearly $2 billion, the highest per capita amount for a post- Soviet state.\\" Fund for Armenian Relief is a humanitarian organization providing long-term programs focusing on human development. Armenia Fund raises millions of dollars every year for infrastructural development in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. In 1992, Dr. Dickran Kouymjian of the California State University, Fresno stated: Montebello Genocide Memorial Armenian Genocide The official recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the US federal government is seen one of the most vital steps in international and full recognition of the 1915‚Äì1923 events. Many Armenians think that the US has the ability to force Turkey to recognize the past and pay Armenians and Armenia their reparations, that includes (for some) the return of the so- called Wilsonian Armenia to the Republic of Armenia. Several official US documents describe the events as \\"genocide\\" (1975, 1984, 1996); President Ronald Reagan also described the events as \\"genocide\\" in a speech on April 22, 1981. On March 4, 2010, the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs recognized the massacres of 1915 as \\"genocide.\\" Also, 49 of the 50 US states have made individual proclamations recognizing the events of 1915 to 1923 as genocide. Armenian Americans gather in multiple towns and cities every year on April 24 for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The largest of such gatherings occurs in the Los Angeles area. The Armenian National Institute lists 30 Armenian Genocide memorials in the US. The oldest one is Montebello Genocide Memorial, which was completed in 1965. Khachkars across America were erected in honor of the 1.5 million victims of the Genocide. Recently, the Armenian Heritage Park was opened in Boston, MA. Notable people Armenians in the US have attained success and prominence in diverse areas, including business, politics, entertainment, sciences, sports and the arts.  Arts and entertainment  System of a Down is composed of four Armenian-Americans Rouben Mamoulian, a film and theater director also known as co-producer of the first feature film (Becky Sharp, 1935) to use the three-strip Technicolor process. Armenian Americans have found a lot of success in the field of entertainment. Singer Cher (born Cherilyn Sarkisian), is Armenian from her paternal side. The metal band System of a Down is composed of four Armenian members of the diaspora: Serj Tankian, Daron Malakian, Shavo Odadjian, and John Dolmayan. Composer Alan Hovhaness, born to an Armenian father and a Scottish-American mother, \\"wrote more than 400 pieces, among them 67 symphonies of varying quality.\\" Kim Kashkashian won the Grammy Award for Best Classical Instrumental Solo in 2013. Sebu Simonian, one of two founders of the band Capital Cities, is Lebanese Armenian. Ross Bagdasarian Sr. (known by the moniker David Seville) created Alvin and the Chipmunks. In 1959, at the First Grammys he won 2 awards: Best Recording for Children and Best Comedy Performance. Mike Conners (born Krekor Ohanian), is the actor who starred in the long-running TV series Mannix, for which he earned a Golden Globe award in 1970. His acting career spanned over 6 decades. Numerous Armenian musicians have been successful in American pop culture. Los Angeles is considered one of the main centers of Armenian music production of the last decades.

Her career as a leader ended with her capture by the Burgundians during a skirmish outside the town on 23 May 1430. Although this was otherwise a minor siege, both politically and militarily, the loss of France's most charismatic commander was an important event of the Hundred Years' War. Background During this era, late in the Hundred Years' War, the politically independent Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, was allied with England under the regency of John, Duke of Bedford (who was the uncle of the child King, Henry VI). These two allies had conquered most of northern France during the preceding ten years. They suffered stunning losses in 1429 to a reinvigorated French army under joint command of Joan of Arc and Duke John II of Alen√ßon. The French had defeated the English at Patay on 18 June 1429 and had proceeded northeastward to crown King Charles VII of France at Rheims without further resistance, accepting the peaceful surrender of every town along their path. Compi√®gne was not along that road ‚Äî its location is north of Paris ‚Äî but along with several other cities it declared allegiance to Charles VII shortly after his coronation. It had previously been under Burgundian control. Events Preparation In March 1430 the French court learned that Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, planned to lay siege to the city. The count of Clermont delivered a message to the city that Compi√®gne was his according to legal treaty and demanded a surrender. Residents of the city expressed strong opposition to the demand and the French garrison commander Guillaume de Flavy readied the city for action. Count John of Luxembourg departed for the expedition in command of the vanguard on 4 April. Philip the Good departed from P√©ronne on 22 April. Meanwhile, the Duke of Bedford was waiting at Calais for the arrival of King Henry VI of England, a nine-year-old boy who had recently been crowned king of England. According to R√©gine Pernoud and Marie- Veronique Clin, Philip the Good planned to retake command of the cities that controlled the Oise river. Bedford supported the strategy in order to protect √éle-de-France and Paris, which was then under Anglo-Burgundian control. King Charles VII of France realized on 6 May that military defense was necessary to protect the town. Joan of Arc had sensed the danger and began making private preparations for war in March, but she had not been granted command of a substantial force since the failed attack on Paris the previous September. By April she had assembled a company of a 300‚Äì400 volunteers. She departed for Compi√®gne, possibly without the king's knowledge, and arrived at the city on 14 May. Combat Several minor actions took place in the days that followed. Two days later Captain Louis de Flavy fled artillery bombardment at Choisy-au-Bac and took refuge at Compi√®gne. On May 18 Joan of Arc attempted to surprise the Burgundians at Soissons, bringing Regnault of Chartres and the Count of Vend√¥me on the expedition. Residents of Soissons refused them entry and declared allegiance to Burgundy the following day. Joan of Arc then planned a surprise assault against the Burgundians at Margny with the assistance of Guillaume de Flavy, attacking an outpost while it was separated from the main force. Count John of Luxembourg noticed the action by chance while taking a survey of the territory and called in reinforcements. These reinforcements outnumbered the attackers and Joan of Arc ordered a retreat, taking the position of honor at the extreme rear of her forces. Capture of Joan of Arc The next moments remain a source of scholarly debate. The city gate closed before all the French defenders could return to the town. This was either a reasonable action to prevent the Burgundians from entering the city after they had seized the end of the bridge; or an act of betrayal by Guillaume de Flavy. In the words of Kelly DeVries, \\"both the accusers and defenders must in turn either indict or vindicate the character of Compi√®gne's governor, Guillaume de Flavy, and the role he played in shutting off any escape possibility for Joan of Arc on that day.\\" The French rear guard that remained outside had no alternative to capture. In the description of Burgundian Georges Chastellain: :\\"Then the Maid [Joan of Arc], surpassing the nature of a woman, took on a great force, and took much pain to save her company from defeat, remaining behind as the leader and as the bravest of the troop. But there fortune permitted for the end of her glory and for the last time that she would ever carry arms. An archer, a rough and very sour man, full of much spite because a woman, who so much had been spoken about, should have defeated so many brave men, as she had done, grabbed the edge of her cloth-of-gold doublet, and threw her from her horse flat to the ground.\\" She surrendered to Lionel, Bastard of Vend√¥me, who was in the service of the Count of Ligny. Although the defense of Compi√®gne was successful, accusations of misconduct regarding Joan of Arc's capture caused the decline of de Flavy's career.
