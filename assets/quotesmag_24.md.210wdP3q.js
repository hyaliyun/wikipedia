Early life and education Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Vander Veen attended the local public schools and graduated from Muskegon High School in 1940. He earned a B.S from the University of South Carolina in 1946 and an LL.B. from Harvard Law School in 1949. He was admitted to the Michigan bar in 1949 and commenced practice in Grand Rapids. In 1951, he, Walter Freihofer and George Cook formed what was to become the third-largest law firm in Grand Rapids. He retired from the law firm when he was elected to Congress. He is a relative of Musician Anthony Keidis. Military service With the outbreak of World War II, Vander Veen enlisted in the United States Navy in January 1941 and served until 1946, seeing active duty in the South Pacific Theater. He also served in the Korean War from 1950 to 1952 with the rank of lieutenant (junior grade). Political career Vander Veen with John F. Kennedy Vander Veen in 2002 In 1958, Vander Veen made an unsuccessful bid as the Democratic Party candidate to unseat incumbent Republican U.S. Representative Gerald Ford in Michigan's 5th congressional district. He became chair of the Michigan Fifth District Democratic Party in 1959 and was an unsuccessful candidate in the Democratic primary election for Lieutenant Governor of Michigan in 1960, losing to T. John Lesinski. He was chairman of the Michigan State Democratic Convention in 1960, and was a delegate to the state conventions in 1962 and 1964. He served on the Michigan State Mental Health Commission, 1958–1963, and the Michigan State Highway Commission, 1964–1969. In 1969, he was elected to the East Grand Rapids Board of Education. After Gerald Ford resigned his House seat in 1973 to become Vice President of the United States, Vander Veen was elected in a special election on February 18, 1974, to fill Ford's seat in the 93rd Congress. Vander Veen's election from the heavily Republican district was seen as a stunning upset defeat for the Republican Party. He is the only Democrat to be elected to Congress from the Grand Rapids area since 1912. The Republican candidate, Robert VanderLaan, was the Republican leader of the Michigan Senate and, up to that point, had never lost an election. Vander Veen turned the election into a referendum on the increasingly unpopular U.S. President Richard Nixon. He stopped campaigning directly against his opponent, and instead took out newspaper advertisements \\"in which he promised to do his utmost to dislodge Nixon and turn the presidency over to Ford, a political folk hero in the district.\\"In the Shadow of Watergate: Bob Michel Becomes a Congressional Leader by Frank H. Mackaman, The Dirksen Congressional Center This upset caused a panic in the Republican Party leadership, as it appeared to foreshadow more losses for the party in the November elections.\\"Nixon: Lots of People Cheat on Taxes\\" The Tech, March 1, 1974, p. 4\\"An Early Alarm Bell For the G.O.P.\\", TIME, March 4, 1974 Political analyst Larry Sabato writes in his Crystal Ball newsletter that Vander Veen's capture of Gerald Ford's solidly Republican district after Ford had been elevated to the Vice Presidency was an electrifying victory that foreshadowed the Democratic Watergate landslide of November 1974. (see also 1974 Midterm Senate and House elections) Vander Veen was reelected in November 1974 to a full term in the 94th Congress, but lost his seat in 1976 to Republican Harold S. Sawyer. In 1978, Vander Veen ran for the United States Senate, but lost his bid for the Democratic nomination to Carl Levin, who went on to win the general election in November. Vander Veen formed two environmental companies: Resource Energy and Enigered. In 1990, he founded the Ryerson Library Foundation, and served as its president. After his service in Congress, Vander Veen served as a member of the Michigan State Waterways Commission. Vander Veen died of prostate cancer at his home in East Grand Rapids at the age of 83.

The first settlers arrived around 1769 in a place called Morro do Chapéu. A chapel was built to honor Santo Antonio, giving the town the name Santo Antônio do Morro do Chapéu. The bandeirantes, who came up from São Paulo, brought 2,000 Negro slaves with them. In 1957 the municipality of Chapéu had its name changed to Monte Alegre de Goiás. There are settlements nearby founded by runaway slaves. These Afro- Brazilians are known as Kalunga. They live on the slopes of the Paranã River and in valleys called \\"vãos\\".

The battle was fought between the followers of King James III of Scotland and a large group of rebellious Scottish nobles including the future Alexander Home, 2nd Lord Home, who were nominally led by the king's 15-year-old son, Prince James, Duke of Rothesay. Father and son James III had faced rebellion for months, with a complicated series of events leading to Sauchieburn. The rebels having made Prince James their figurehead earlier in the year, James III became determined to get hold of his son and settle the matter. However he broke his written word that he would negotiate first, instead travelling south to Edinburgh from his stronghold in the north. This breaking of his word apparently caused some of his strong supporters to desert him, such as Huntly, Erroll, Marishal, and Glamis; they adopted a neutral stance on the issues.Macdougall, Norman, James III, John Donald (2009), page 338 In May, James crossed the river to use Blackness as a base, with the prince at Linlithgow. However, attempts to reach the prince at Linlithgow were defeated in a small skirmish, and James was forced back to Blackness, from where he fled, leaving behind those he had given as hostages to the rebels. By the 16th of May he was back in Edinburgh, and began spreading money around to raise supporters, including to his half uncle, John Stewart, 1st Earl of Atholl. At this point the rebels were geographically split, some at Stirling, some at Linlithgow. James again took the initiative with a sudden move over to Fife with his supporters and their men, advancing on Stirling, where on the 10th of June he took the rebels by surprise, driving them southwards. This left James with the town of Stirling, perhaps not the castle, from where he advanced on the 11th of June to meet the combined forces of the rebels driven from Stirling and those who had come from Linlithgow in support. To aid him in battle he had the sword of Robert the Bruce with him. Dr John Ireland heard the King's confession. His army was arrayed by the advocate John Ross of Montgrenan and battle began. The battle went badly for the Royalists. Persistent legends, based on the highly coloured and unreliable accounts of sixteenth-century chroniclers such as Adam Abell, Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, John Lesley, and George Buchanan, claim that James III was assassinated at Milltown, near Bannockburn, soon after the battle. There is no contemporary evidence to support this account, nor the allegation that he fled the battle, nor the tale that his assassin impersonated a priest in order to approach James. Pitscottie provided a story that, on the eve of the battle, his ancestor David Lord Lindsay of the Byres presented James III with a \\"great grey horse\\" that would carry him faster than any other horse into or away from the battle. Unfortunately, the horse threw the King during the battle, and James III was either killed in the fall, or was finished off by enemy soldiers.Macdougall, Norman, James III, John Donald (1982), pp.261-2 Prince James ascended to the throne, and reigned as James IV for 25 years. Throughout his reign he wore a heavy iron chain around his waist, next to the skin, as a constant reminder of his role in the death of his father. The battlefield is currently under research to be inventoried and protected by Historic Scotland, under the Scottish Historical Environment Policy of 2009.

History William Fairbairn opened an iron foundry in 1816 and was joined the following year by a Mr. Lillie, and the firm became known as Fairbairn and Lillie Engine Makers, producing iron steamboats. Their foundry and millwrighting factory burned down on 6 August 1831 with damage estimated at £8,000. The business survived this event. Shipbuilding In 1830, they built the iron paddle-steamer Lord Dundas, for use on the Forth and Clyde Canal. She proved so successful that the firm built eight more of a larger size within the next two or three years for Scottish canals, two passenger- boats with 40 horsepower engines for the Humber and two for the lakes of Zurich and Walenstadt in Switzerland, which, after being tried, were sent out dismantled.Chronology of Iron Ships, The Fouling and Corrosion of Iron Ships, Chapter 3, by C.F.T. Young, London Drawing Assoc., London, 1867 In 1831, they built the Manchester, in 1832, La Reine des Beiges, with engines of 24 horsepower, which went from Liverpool to Ostend. In 1834, they built the , with 40 horsepower. Minerva was sent in pieces to Hull where she was assembled. She then made the voyage to Rotterdam in 33 hours, and steamed up to the Rhine Falls, where she was again dismantled and carried overland to Lake Zurich. The difficulties which were found to exist in an inland town like Manchester for the construction of iron vessels led to this branch of the business moving to London in the years 1834-5. There at Millwall on the Isle of dogs, William Fairbairn constructed more than eighty vessels of various sizes, including the Pottinger, of 1250 tons and 450 horsepower, for the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, the Megaera and other vessels for the Royal Navy, and many others. Thus introducing iron shipbuilding on the River Thames. Until in 1848 when Fairbairn retired from this branch of his business. Railway locomotives When Mr. Lillie left the firm in 1839, the name changed to William Fairbairn & Sons and the company's attention turned to railway locomotives. Their first designs were of the four-wheeled \\"Bury\\" type, built for the Manchester and Leeds Railway. Generally they built to the design of the customer or similar to those being produced by Edward Bury and Company and Sharp, Roberts and Company. In all they produced over sixty-nine locomotives for the M&LR;, their main customer, but they also built for the \\"little\\" North Western Railway and for lines in Ireland. Their production was mainly lightweight 0-4-0, then 2-2-2, 2-4-0 and 0-4-2 engines typical of the day. One example of a Fairbairn locomotive, a small 2-2-2 tank engine, is preserved, in Rio de Janeiro. In 1852, Fairbain delivered four locomotives to Estrada de Ferro Mauá, Brazil's first railway company, the four of them said to be 2-2-2T. The locomotive first used during the railway line construction works was one called Manchester, but the one to pull Mauá Railway's - and therefore Brazil's - inauguration train 30 April 1854 was the one called Baroneza (modern spelling is \\"Baronesa\\"). It is not known if the three others still were in use in 1883, the year \\"Baronesa\\" was surrendered to DPII where she was regauged from - some literature says it was - to and numbered #1. In 1890, due to the proclamation of the Republic, DPII was renamed into CB and Baroneza continued #1 until her withdrawal before World War I. She was preserved by CB and after 1957 by RFFSA's railway preservation agency PRESERFE. Today under the responsibility of IPHAN, as mentioned above she's exhibited at former RFFSA's Engenho de Dentro railway museum in Rio de Janeiro, RJ. However, in 1851-5 they built 40 larger engines to the design of James McConnell for the Southern Division of the London and North Western Railway. In 1862 they built some 2-2-2 locomotives to the design of the Great Eastern Railway. The Midland Railway and the West Midland Railway bought a number of 0-6-0 and in 1861, the Furness Railway bought two 0-4-0s. The locomotive building part of the business was sold to Sharp Stewart and Company in 1863.  Work  William Fairbairn was an innovative engineer and his company was involved in many developments across the whole field of engineering. When the Albert Hall was built as a memorial to Prince Albert the company was involved in the design. Although the hall itself was built of brick and terracotta the dome (designed by Rowland Mason Ordish) on top was made of wrought iron and glazed. There was a trial assembly made of the iron framework of the dome at William Fairbairn's Manchester works, then it was taken apart again and transported to London via horse and cart. When the time came for the supporting structure to be removed from the dome after reassembly in situ, only volunteers remained on site in case the structure dropped. It did drop – but only by five-sixteenths of an inch.

Life Osborne was born at Chicksands Priory, Bedfordshire, England, the youngest of twelve children born to a staunchly Royalist family. Her father was the nobleman Sir Peter Osborne, who was the Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Guernsey under Charles I. Her mother was Dorothy Danvers, whose brother was Sir John Danvers the regicide. After refusing a long string of suitors put forth by her family, including her cousin Thomas Osborne, Henry Cromwell (son of Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell) and Sir Justinian Isham, in 1654 Dorothy Osborne married Sir William Temple, a man with whom she had carried on a lengthy clandestine courtship that was largely epistolary in nature. It is for her letters to Temple, which were witty, progressive and socially illuminating, that Osborne is remembered. Only Osborne's side of the correspondence survives, comprising a collection of 79 letters held in the British Library (ADD. MSS. 33975). Osborne fell in love with Temple in 1647, when the pair were both about nineteen years old. Although both families opposed the match on financial grounds, seventeenth-century marriages frequently being business arrangements, she steadfastly remained single. Following the death of her father, the couple's families sanctioned the match, bringing to a close nearly seven years of intermittent courtship—the latter two marked by the famous exchange of letters. The wedding took place on 25 December 1654, and the marriage lasted until Lady Temple's death on 7 February 1695. Although there is little extant trace of Osborne after she wed, a few of her married notes and letters survive, though they lack the wit and verve of her courtship letters. Scattered references indicate that Osborne was keenly involved in her husband's diplomatic career and matters of state. Sir William's career posted the couple abroad for periods of their married life, including time in both Brussels (in the Spanish Netherlands) and the Dutch Republic. Temple was Ambassador in The Hague twice, latterly during the marriage negotiations of William and Mary. In 1671 Charles II of England used Dorothy to provoke the Third Anglo-Dutch War by letting her on 24 August sail through the Dutch fleet on the royal yacht Merlin, demanding to be saluted with white smoke. Osborne was an important and acknowledged figure in the later marriage negotiations because of her friendship with both William III of Orange and Princess Mary. Osborne's close friendship with Mary lasted until the Queen's death in 1694. Osborne (Lady Temple) had nine children, all but two of whom died in infancy. A daughter, Diana, succumbed to smallpox at age fourteen, and a son, John, took his own life in his twenties, but not before he had married and fathered two children, providing Sir William and Lady Temple with two granddaughters: Elizabeth and Dorothy Temple. Lady Temple died at Moor Park, Surrey, and is buried in the west aisle of Westminster Abbey, along with her husband Sir William Temple, daughter Diana Temple and Temple's sister, Martha, Lady Giffard, whose adult life was spent as a member of the Osborne/Temple household. Publication history Dorothy Osborne's letters have been published numerous times since their initial appearance in print in 1888. The most recent edition is edited by Kenneth Parker: Dorothy Osborne: Letters to Sir William Temple, 1652–54: Observations on Love, Literature, Politics and Religion (Ashgate, 2002), although that edition is not without problems for specialised users, namely with regards to the correct order of some of the letters, many of which were undated and are difficult to place sequentially. The text of editor Sir Edward Parry's 1888 edition is available online at . Parry's edition is particularly valuable for its useful commentary, although unfortunately he did not retain the original orthography for his transcription, and the \\"modern English\\" in some cases lessens the considerable charm of Osborne's prose. G. C. Moore Smith's (1928) and Parker's critical editions retain Osborne's spelling and punctuation. Critical appreciations * F. L.

Biography After receiving her Bachelor of Arts degree from Cornell University and Bachelor of Laws from Harvard Law School, she was hired by the National Labor Relations Board. She worked as a legislative assistant to United States Senator Harrison A. Williams (D-NJ), and subsequently for United States Congressman Jonathan B. Bingham (D-NY). Kessler worked for the New York City Board of Education, and then opened a public interest law firm. In June 1977, she was appointed Associate Judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, and from 1981 to 1985 served as Presiding Judge of the Family Division. She was President of the National Association of Women Judges from 1983 to 1984, and currently serves on the Executive Committee of the American Bar Association Conference of Federal Trial Judges and the U.S. Judicial Conference's Committee on Court Administration and Management. District Court service On March 22, 1994, President Clinton nominated Kessler to serve as a United States District Judge for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, to the seat vacated by Judge Michael Boudin. She was confirmed by the Senate on June 15, 1994 and received her commission on June 16, 1994. She took senior status on January 22, 2007 and was succeeded by Judge Amy Berman Jackson. Detainee treatment cases Kessler is the first judge to consider an appeal that the Executive branch is violating the Detainee Treatment Act. In 2006, she heard the case of Mohammad Bawazir, a prisoner at Camp Delta. The George W. Bush Administration argued that the Detainee Treatment Act, legislation spearheaded by John McCain banning cruel or inhuman treatment, did not apply to Bawazir and other detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, Cuba. On October 10, 2007, the Washington Post headlined \\"Judge Orders U.S. Not to Transfer Tunisian Detainee,\\" and reported that Judge Kessler \\"ruled last week that Mohammed Abdul Rahman cannot be sent [from Guantanamo] to Tunisia because he could suffer 'irreparable harm.\\" The detainee's lawyer said, \\"The executive has now been told it cannot bury its Guantanamo mistakes in Third World prisons.\\" He also stated that, \\"This is the first time the judicial branch has exercised its inherent power to control the excesses of the executive as to treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.\\" Kessler twice denied relief to detainee Jihad Ahmed Mustafa Dhiab, first determining that she had no jurisdiction over his confinement conditions, and, after that theory was rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, that the government was permitted to use force-feedings on detainees during the Guantanamo Bay hunger strikes.. Kessler did, however, twice grant news media requests for access to classified video of the force-feedings, before ultimately being reversed by the D.C. Circuit.

It is the third of Burgess' four Enderby novels and was first published in 1974 by Hart-Davis, MacGibbon Publishers.Novel Style: Ethics and Excess in English Fiction Since The 1960s, Oxford University Press, Ben Masters, p. 184 It is usually subtitled Enderby's End, as it was originally intended to be the last book in the Enderby series. However, a further sequel, Enderby's Dark Lady, followed in 1984. Plot summary Enderby is a dyspeptic British poet, 56 years old, and The Clockwork Testament is an account of his last day alive. The day in question is a cold one in February. He spends it in New York City, where for the past several months he's been working as a visiting professor of English literature and composing a long poem about St. Augustine and Pelagius. Enderby's present situation arose from a chance encounter with an American film producer in Tangiers, where he owns a bar. Publican Enderby served the man a Scotch and pitched him an idea for a new film—an adaptation of Gerard Manley Hopkins's famously obscure poem \\"The Wreck of the Deutschland\\". The producer, intrigued, asked for a script, which Enderby duly composed. The eventual film bears little resemblance to this script or to Hopkins's poem; however, his name is prominently credited, and the film, and Enderby, are now famous. This unwanted public recognition has led to an invitation to teach English at the University of Manhattan for a year. Also, since the film has controversial elements—including, for some reason, a lurid rape scene with Nazis and nuns—the reclusive, little-read poet has been receiving a barrage of ranting phone calls from angry citizens who are eager to denounce \\"his\\" film. Invariably, these callers (and other critics) have never read the original poem; indeed, they don't even know it exists. Enderby suffers three heart attacks over the course of the day, and succumbs to a fourth some time after midnight. Between attacks, he goes about his business: he happily works on his Pelagian poem; eats dyspeptic American food and smokes White Owl cigars; refuses an offer of sex from a female poetry student who wants him to give her an A; struggles through two lectures; appears on a smarmy talk show; and draws a sword he carries hidden in his cane to defend a middle-aged housewife from a gang of thugs on the subway. Everywhere—even on the subway—he encounters incomprehension and, usually, disapproval. When he finally gets home, however, a woman he's never seen before drops by and pulls a gun on him; she has come to tell him she's read and re-read all his poetry, and is now going to murder him for writing it. First, however, she orders him to strip naked and urinate all over his collected works. Enderby strips, but since he has an erection he cannot obey the rest of her command. The scene ends, apparently, in a sexual encounter. Enderby dies later that night. Themes A Clockwork Testament is laced with Burgess's usual mordant wit, deft literary allusions, and virtuosic wordplay. The world of the book takes its hue from Enderby's brilliant but ever-irritable outsider's psyche. In some ways, the novel echoes Joyce's Ulysses; it covers one day only, casts an unheroic man in the role of hero, and explores that man's physical and mental processes in intimate detail. In place of The Odyssey, Burgess incorporates extended references to St. Augustine and Pelagius, and also to Gerard Manley Hopkins, author of a phrase Enderby makes peculiarly his own: \\"I am gall, I am heartburn.\\" The book blends social satire with self-mockery. In a classroom scene, for example, Enderby is unable to remember his planned lecture on minor Elizabethan dramatists and so on the spur of the moment invents a playwright called 'Gervase Whitelady'. He discourses learnedly on this personage for some time, helped on by a student who begins as a know-it-all but ends as a collaborator, earnestly prompting him with the details of Whitelady's life. Enderby abruptly concludes the lecture by dismissing his imaginary playwright as a failure-- at which point he recognises his creation as a mirror image of himself. Later, at his poetry- writing class, Enderby finds little to admire in his students' undisciplined effusions and tries to impress on them that poetry arises from craftsmanlike effort, not emotional self-indulgence. The students, however, just look at him pityingly and ask him when he plans to leave. As the title suggests, The Clockwork Testament also gives the author a chance to explore his own bemusement over Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of A Clockwork Orange: Burgess came to hate the film that made him famous. This autobiographical element is most apparent in the talk show scene, where Enderby's fellow guests (an actress and a psychologist) attack the poet for his involvement in a film version of \\"The Wreck of the Deutschland\\", which has been accused of inspiring violence against nuns. Enderby, forced to defend a movie that he considers a punishment to Hopkins, reiterates the central themes of A Clockwork Orange: the human need to choose freely between good and evil, and the daemonic, joyous nature of man's creative inner self. At this point, he quotes directly from the novel. Burgess faced similar criticism over Kubrick's version of A Clockwork Orange; he, too, for example, found himself being blamed for the rape of a nun because the movie allegedly inspired it.

The railway was of gauge. Construction began in 2000 and the line closed at the end of 2006. It was the most northerly passenger carrying railway in the British Isles, and although it was primarily the owner's hobby it did achieve the status of a tourist attraction and local curiosity. The railway sometimes ran one of its two steam locomotives, a 2-4-2 and a 2-4-0, but more often one of three petrol locomotives. The railway also owned a number of items of rolling stock, including a very rare Cromar White first-class carriage. Although trains had been operating occasionally in some form beforehand, the railway was officially opened to the public in August 2006 by Sir Peter Maxwell Davies just a few months before its closure, which was variously attributed to the owner being unable to keep his promise to hold Sir Peter's civil partnership ceremony there or unreasonable demands placed upon the railway's operators by local council officials. As at 2008 the owner was taking legal action against a number of organisations over perceived discrimination and misconduct by those organisations, in relation to the railway, its associated tea-rooms and the abortive civil partnership ceremony.

It is the fifth book in Card's The Tales of Alvin Maker series and is about Alvin Miller, the Seventh son of a seventh son. Heartfire was nominated for the Locus Award in 1999. Plot summary Alvin marries Peggy, and they conceive a daughter (not born by the end of the book). Alvin, Verily Cooper, Arthur Stuart, and Mike Fink are joined by John James Audubon, a French-speaking painter of birds. This group go to a Puritan-dominated place near Boston and end up confronting the witch laws. Meanwhile, Peggy has gone to the Crown Colonies - slave states that ruled by the Stuart dynasty in exile - in an attempt to free the slaves. We learn the story of Purity, a Puritan girl whose parents were hanged for their knacks, which are considered witchcraft by the Puritans. Purity meets Alvin's band and Arthur Stuart tells her the whole story of their travels. Purity goes away convinced they are witches and tells a local witcher, Quill, who is evil and twists her words against her and the boys. Quill intends to hang them as well as Purity. Alvin whisks away Arthur Stuart, Mike Fink, and Audubon by leading them into the greensong that lets them run hundreds of miles without tiring, but turning back without the others en route. Alvin gives himself up to the men sent to bring in the \\"witches\\" while Verily hides for the moment. Quill has both Purity and Alvin running in tight circles to wear them down - a semi-legal form of torture, intended to make them confess to witchery. Verily comes by and loudly scolds Quill in front of the crowd, saying it's inhumane. At the trial, Verily Cooper makes a case for overturning the witchery laws: in all previous witch trials, it was the witcher who brought up any connection with Satan, while the defendant had been too beaten down to resist. The judge, John Adams, is sympathetic, but realizes that a sudden overthrow of long-kept laws will cause social instability. However, based on Verily's evidence, he suspends the licenses of all witchers in New England for alleged misconduct; since, to reinstate their licenses, a witcher would have to prove his claims in a normal court, and since this is impossible, it effectively ends the practice of witch trials while leaving the laws on the books. Calvin has come back to America from France with Honoré de Balzac, the French boy-writer. The two meet up with Peggy and Calvin gets himself in serious trouble.

Dil Aasha Hai's budget was 14.6 million and it earned just 1 million on opening day and was declared a \\"flop\\" By Box Office India. Despite the film appealing to a niche audience due to its progressive theme; the late Divya Bharti as the central protagonist was impressive and it is considered one of her best performances. It was one of Shahrukh Khan's early romantic roles and his chemistry with Divya Bharti; whom he also co-starred with in his debut film Deewana was also appreciated. The performances of senior actresses Dimple Kapadia, Amrita Singh and Sonu Walia in supporting roles were also appreciated; this was Hema Malini's directorial debut film. Trivia The fun fact of this film is that Divya Bharti, who was a new comer, was given a bigger role in the film compared to Shah Rukh Khan (who was also a new comer), Jeetandra, Mithun Chakraborty, Dimple Kapadia & Amrita Singh (who were already flourished actors in Bollywood).

It is the fourth book in Card's The Tales of Alvin Maker series and is about Alvin Miller, the Seventh son of a seventh son. Alvin Journeyman won the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel in 1996. Synopsis Alvin is a Maker, and what he can make is a new future for America. But to do that he must defeat his ancient enemy, the Unmaker, whose cruel whispers and deadly plots have threatened Alvin's life at every turn. Now a grown man and a journeyman smith, Alvin has returned to his family and friends in the town of Vigor Church, to share in their isolation, to work as a blacksmith, and to try to teach anyone who will learn the knack of being a Maker. For Alvin has had a vision of the city he will build, and he knows that he cannot build it alone. But the Unmaker is not through with Alvin. If that spirit of destruction cannot stop him by magic, or war and devastation, then it will try to crush the young Maker by simpler means - more human means. By lies and innuendo, and by false accusations, Alvin is driven from his home back to Hatrack River, only to find that the Unmaker has been there before him, and that he must now stand trial for his life. Against him in this trial stands Daniel Webster. Meanwhile, his brother Calvin has started to grow into his own knacks, which he views to be equal to Alvin's. When Alvin returned to Vigor Church he found that Calvin had been doing all the jobs that Alvin had done prior to his apprenticeship. When Alvin started to teach how to be a maker, Calvin resented the way he felt he was being treated and decided to learn how to be a Maker on his own, but by any means he deems necessary. He finds passage to the United Kingdom, and then to the courtship of Emperor Napoleon himself in Paris, to treat him for his gout. By healing the pain each day, he spends a few hours a day learning from Napoleon on how to rule. Calvin makes a friend in Paris, with whom he then leaves Napoleon (healed from ever feeling pain again) and heads to America.

He was a Juilliard-trained pianist and a veteran of World War II. He studied Zen in Japan for sixteen years while teaching university-level piano and voice there, then returned to the United States to teach music and Zen in Surry, Maine, where he founded Moonspring Hermitage. He founded the Surry Opera Company in the mid-1980s and retired from formal Zen teaching in 1985. Zen and The Art Of Opera by EVAN EISENBERG, September 2, 2001 New York Times Biography Early years Nowick's parents were immigrants of Russian-Polish origin. He grew up on Long Island, New York on a potato farm. He showed an early talent for music and studied piano at Juilliard with Henriette Michaelson. She summered in Surry, and he first came to Maine as a teenager to study with her. He left his piano study to serve in the Pacific during World War II, taking part in the final sweep of Okinawa after the island had surrendered. He eventually returned to his piano studies with Miss Michaelson. Having seen a book on Zen on her coffee table, began to sit at the First Zen Institute of America, where Michaelson was a member. Japan Nowick went to Japan in 1950 to study Zen with Zuigan Gotō of Daitoku-ji. Nowick stayed in Japan some sixteen years until the death of Zuigan Gotō in 1965. Janwillem van de Wetering lived a year and a half in Daitoku-Ji with Nowick, and described this in The Empty Mirror. Sōkō Morinaga, Walter Nowick's Dharma brother, wrote in Novice to Master about traditional practices at the time Walter first went to Japan. During Nowick's years in Japan he supported himself teaching piano and voice at the Kyoto Women's University. Nowick became known in the United States Zen community, which was very small at the time, as the first Westerner to have gone to Japan and completed the traditional Zen practice on their terms. Nowick was not given formal Dharma transmission—a point emphasized by Sōkō Morinaga Roshi during a visit to London. Nowick was also never ordained a priest but instead remained a layman. Three students of Zuigan Gotō are listed: Oda Sessō, Sōkō Morinaga and Walter Nowick.Buddhist Studies WWW Virtual Library, Hakuin School of Zen Buddhism Moonspring Hermitage After the death of Zuigan Gotō in 1965, Nowick returned to the United States and began teaching Japanese musicians at his farm in Surry. After a few years, students of Zen began to arrive and many settled nearby. Some built homes on land provided by Walter, sometimes living on his farm. There were both single and married people with children. A student organization was incorporated as Moonspring Hermitage, a non-profit religious group, with a board of officers elected from among the students. The students built a zendo and meeting hall on a parcel of Nowick's land, with an agreement specifying that the corporation and buildings belonged to the students and that the land would be turned over to them after fifteen years. A Rinzai Zen-style practice was established, though Nowick did not practice many of the externals of Japanese Zen. There were no chants, robes, Buddhist names, lectures, precepts, and such. Instead there was just work on his farm and koan study. At its peak in the mid-1970s, the group may have had an overall membership of 40 people. In 1975, Janwillem van de Wetering documented his experiences in this community in A Glimpse of Nothingness. His third Zen-book \\"Afterzen\\" has been dedicated to Walter Nowick. Surry Opera Company In the mid-eighties, concerned with the looming possibility of nuclear holocaust, Nowick founded the Surry Opera Company, an amateur group that intended to strengthen ties with the Soviet Union at a personal level. This group went to the USSR a number of times and received national attention in its heyday.ellsworthamerican.com, Singing for Peace: Surry Opera Company In 1985, shortly after the founding of the opera company, some of his students became concerned that he was spending too much time on the project. He offered his resignation as a teacher, which was accepted by the student committee, and devoted himself to music full-time. After some legal wrangling, the property reverted as had been agreed before the student committee accepted his resignation, to the corporation, which had been reconstituted as the Morgan Bay Zendo, with Walter reserving some rights of usage. The MBZ has used and maintained the property ever since, with Walter visiting occasionally. Walter Nowick continued to live in Surry much of his life, spending some of the winter in Japan and Russia. In the summer, he gave piano concerts and Russians come for extended visits. Nowick suffered a stroke in 2012 and also developed pneumonia. In declining health, he removed his feeding tube shortly before his death in the morning hours of February 6, 2013. He was 87 years old.

It is a subsidiary of Terminix Global Holdings, Inc. History In 1927, E. L. Bruce, owner of the E. L. Bruce Company in Memphis, Tennessee, wanted to find a way to protect the hardwood floors they manufactured from damage by termites and founded the Bruce Terminix Research Laboratory. In 1932, senior chemist Frank Lyons created the first termiticide, an insecticide specifically designed to kill termites. The company began to franchise under the name Bruce Terminix. In 1955, Terminix was the first company to offer a termite protection contract, with annual inspections and a guarantee. In 1957, franchisees began offering residential and commercial pest control services. In 1968, the E. L. Bruce Company, including Bruce Terminix, was sold to Cook Industries. The company began looking to expand its business both inside and outside of the United States and purchased a pest control company in Mexico. Terminix partnered with Sears, Roebuck and Company to offer pest control services under the Sears Termite and Pest Control name. In 1972, the company changed their name to Terminix International to highlight their expanded operations. ServiceMaster, a global holding company, purchased Terminix from Cook Industries in 1986. It continued to acquire pest control companies, including former franchisees, to become the largest pest control company in the world by 1990. The company expanded into Europe in 1994 with the acquisition of Peter Cox PLC, a pest-control and wood-preservation business in Britain. In 2001, Terminix purchased its former partner, Sears Termite and Pest Control. In 2007, ServiceMaster moved its main offices from Downers Grove, Illinois to the site of Terminix's headquarters in Memphis, Tennessee. Over the first three months of 2009, Terminix acquired nine pest management companies across seven states. In December 2012, Terminix closed six acquisitions adding over $10 million in revenue. In 2013, Terminix acquired two Canadian pest control companies, Magical Pest Control, based in Toronto, and Vancouver-based Care Pest & Wildlife Control. During the first five months of 2014, Terminix acquired eight pest and wildlife control companies in ten states. Terminix's parent company, ServiceMaster, held its IPO in June 2014. In November 2015, Terminix acquired the Utah-based company, Alterra Pest Control. In October 2020, ServiceMaster Global Holdings, Inc., sold its ServiceMaster Brands segment and associated trademarks to Roark Capital, and subsequently changed its name to Terminix Global Holdings, Inc., and its NYSE ticker symbol to TMX. Products Terminix works with residential and commercial customers for pest control services including termite, mosquito and bed bug treatments, as well as insulation options. Terminix released the environmentally safe mosquito bait Attractive Targeted Sugar Bait in 2014. The garlic oil makes mosquitoes sick and kills 90 percent of the mosquitoes within three weeks. The company also produces AllClear mosquito repellant, which is an all natural mix of essential oils. Legal proceedings In May 2008, termite inspectors in California sued ServiceMaster and its Terminix unit for failure to pay overtime, rest breaks, and other work-required expenses. Terminix held that termite inspectors were outside sales employees.Pablo et al. v. ServiceMaster Global (Terminix), CASE NO. 3:08-cv-03894-SI(U.S. Dist. Ct. N. Dist.

The ARS mascots are Dandy and his sidekick Pronto. History ARS was established in 1975. The name \\"Rescue Rooter\\" was trademarked in 1976 by the California-based Rescue Industries Inc. It was a family-owned West Coast plumbing and drain cleaning company. In 1996, ARS was founded to consolidate local and regional HVAC service companies. Shortly after, The Servicemaster Company, based in Downers Grove, Illinois, acquired both Rescue Rooter and ARS, in 1998 and 1999 respectively, and brought them together under the \\"ARS/Service Express\\" brand. The company eventually dropped the \\"Service Express brand and the parent brand was known primarily as “ARS/Rescue Rooter.” In 1998 the company had around 5,000 employees.

The station serves the Athens area and is currently owned by the University of Georgia. History The station first broadcast on October 16, 1972, with a 3,200 watt signal. In 1977, WUOG's wattage was increased to 10,000 watts, and in 1994 the station reached its current 26,000 watts, making it one of the most powerful college stations in the country. The transmitter sits atop on the UGA campus, broadcasting at an effective radius of 60 miles or 100 km. With the exception of a period of time in 1981 and 2005 when the station was shut down for non-compliance of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules, WUOG has operated for 18 to 24 hours each day. The station is maintained and run entirely by a 200-student staff of volunteers. 18 executive members oversee the staff and the day-to-day operation of the station. WUOG offers regular rotation programming as well as specialty shows. \\"Rotation\\" consists of new and old music of any genre that falls within the bounds of WUOG's music philosophy. Once stated as the axiom \\"If they don't need us, we don't need them\\", the music philosophy strives to include artists whose music is rarely heard elsewhere. WUOG also carries specialty show programming ranging from Middle Eastern music to new wave, oldies to bluegrass music. News shows, talk shows and sports shows air throughout the week. The program \\"Live in the Lobby,\\" broadcast on Tuesday and Thursday each week, features live on air in-studio sessions from local Georgia musical artists. It was on WUOG that R.E.M. were first broadcast; a live recording of \\"Hippy, Hippy Shake\\" was played in the summer of 1980. Drummer Bill Berry was also in a short-lived combo of radio personalities from the station, known as the WUOGerz. In late June 2006, it was discovered that the station was causing electromagnetic interference to a nuclear chemistry laboratory on campus. To alleviate this, the station temporarily went off-air on weekdays from 7AM and resumed broadcast at 4PM, as well as late nights and weekends, while the lab work was done. Electronic filters eliminated the problem on July 13, allowing WUOG to return to a normal schedule. On February 21, 2009 the lobby of the new WUOG station inside of Tate was named in honor of Wilbur Herrington. The Wilbur Herrington Lobby memorializes Wilbur's service as station engineer since the station's first broadcast in 1972. Herrington had received help in the early stages of applying for an FCC license from broadcast engineers at Athens commercial station WRFC(AM) (960 kHz), chiefly Larry Melear (a graduate of the UGA School of Broadcasting) and Everett Langford.

He served with the HAC in Northern France in 1914 and was wounded by shellfire in November 1914 towards the end of the First Battle of Ypres and evacuated to England.Lewis op. cit. pp.123–127. He rejoined the HAC in January 1915 in London but in February was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the 2/5th Manchester Regiment, the regiment his father had been a Lieutenant colonel in.Lewis op. cit., p.129. After training on a machine gun course, he served at Gallipoli from September 1915 as Machine-Gun Officer of the 5th Manchester's until he was evacuated in October 1915 suffering from jaundice.

Meanwhile, he had been awarded his Kent cap in 1920 and scored 553 runs for the country during the season. The 1921 season was Bryan's only full season of cricket as his job as a teacher prevented him playing regularly outside of the school holidays thereafter.Wilde S (2013) '1922 Five Cricketers of the Year' in Wisden Cricketers of the Year: A Celebration of Cricket's Greatest Players, pp.98–100.

The Triffids 1976–1989 While still at high school, partly in response to the emergence of punk rock, McComb and Alan \\"Alsy\\" MacDonald formed Dalsy (a multimedia project, producing music, books and photographic work, and its output reflected his early interests, in Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, the Velvet Underground and Patti Smith), in 1976. Dalsy, later known as Blök Music then evolved into The Triffids (from the post-apocalyptic John Wyndham novel, The Day of the Triffids). McComb and MacDonald wrote and performed songs with Phil Kakulas (later in Blackeyed Susans), Andrew McGowan, Julian Douglas-Smith, and later Byron Sinclair, Will Akers and Margaret Gillard. By Christmas 1978, they had released several home-recorded cassette tapes and been through many line-up changes. McComb became established as the band's main songwriter and common denominator in the band's various line-ups.Spencer et al, (2007) 'Triffids, The' entry.Australian Rock Database entries: * The Triffids: * The Blackeyed Susans: * Four Hours Sleep: * John Kennedy * Lawson Square Infirmary: * Graham Lee: * David McComb: In 1980, The Triffids won a band demo competition and released their first 7-inch vinyl single, \\"Stand Up\\", on the Shake Some Action label in the following year. The Triffids then moved to Melbourne before eventually settling in Sydney in 1982. After a couple of singles and EPs, Reverie EP, \\"Spanish Blue\\", and the Bad Timing and Other Stories EP, the group had saved up money from support slots with the Hoodoo Gurus, The Church and Hunters and Collectors, to record and release the band's debut 12-inch vinyl album, Treeless Plain, for Hot Records, a Sydney independent label. McComb sold the rights to three songs to ABC-TV, for their 1984 series Sweet and Sour: \\"On The Street Where You Live\\", \\"Digging a Hole\\", and \\"Too Hot To Move\\". Lead vocals on the first two were sung for the series by Cathy McQuade (of Deckchairs Overboard) and the latter was performed by Deborah Conway (of Do-Ré-Mi). As part of the sale, The Triffids were no longer able to perform the songs. McComb later said that he regretted selling the songs and that he had bought back \\"Too Hot to Move\\", which The Triffids began to perform again: they recorded it for their 1989 album, The Black Swan. It has also been performed by The Blackeyed Susans (with Rob Snarski on lead vocals). In 1985, The Triffids moved to London, with the addition of 'Evil' Graham Lee on pedal steel guitar, recorded their second album, Born Sandy Devotional in 1986, and Wide Open Road EP. The group were hailed by the British media, were featured on the John Peel show and supported Echo & the Bunnymen. In 1986, with delays in releasing Born Sandy Devotional, the Triffids returned to Western Australia where they built an eight-track machine inside a shearing shed on the McComb family's farming property and recorded their third album In The Pines. On their return to the UK, they signed a three-record deal with Island Records. In 1987 armed with the considerable budget of £125,000, and the production skills of Gil Norton, David McComb and a new recruit, Adam Peters, concocted the lush orchestrations of the poignant \\"Bury Me Deep in Love\\" and the melancholic wide-screen atmosphere of the subsequent Calenture album. Despite the release of another two tracks from the album as singles, \\"Trick of the Light\\" and \\"Holy Water\\", Calenture didn't have the impact expected of it. In 1989, the \\"Goodbye Little Boy\\" single featured in the Australian soap opera Neighbours. 1989 also saw the Triffids record their last studio album, The Black Swan, in England, with producer Stephen Street. Despite being well received, the album wasn't an overwhelming success, which disappointed McComb and the rest of the band to the point where they decided to dissolve the band. In order to fulfill their contractual obligations with Island Records a live album recorded in Stockholm, Stockholm was released in 1990 the year after the Triffids split up. Post-Triffids career 1990–1999 McComb lived in London in 1990–1992 with his girlfriend, and launched a solo career. In 1991, McComb and Adam Peters contributed to the Leonard Cohen tribute album I'm Your Fan with a cover of \\"Don't Go Home With Your Hard-On\\", later mentioned favorably by Cohen himself. Following this, McComb formed the first incarnation of the Red Ponies and played three London shows in quick succession, at the Powerhaus, Subterranea and the Borderline. The line-up consisted of McComb and Peters along with Nick Allum of Fatima Mansions, who also had played drums on Calenture, Gary Sanford of Aztec Camera, and Martyn P. Casey. When he returned to Australia, McComb settled in Melbourne, where he commenced studies at the University of Melbourne in art history. He recorded with the Blackeyed Susans, completed a solo album, Love of Will, for Mushroom Records, and undertook a solo tour of Europe with his backing band, The Red Ponies, consisting of Graham Lee, Warren Ellis, Peter Luscombe, Bruce Haymes and Michael Vidale. In June 1993 three former members of The Triffids: McComb, Robert and Lee; as well as Charlie Owen and Chris Wilson guested on Acuff's Rose's debut studio album, Never Comin' Down. He also performed in Australia with his last band, Costar, who recorded a three- track EP. (This has never been released, but may be released on the W.Minc label when the Triffids reissue program is complete.) Recording for a Costar album was also underway at the time of McComb's death. McComb made occasional appearances with the Blackeyed Susans in Australia, giving Rob Snarski a break from vocals (as did Kim Salmon). Health problems and death McComb suffered from back pain which worsened over the years. He also struggled with alcoholism, and amphetamine and heroin abuse, which greatly affected his health. He developed cardiomyopathy, a heart condition that, when found in young men, is most commonly caused by alcoholism. In 1996, he underwent a successful heart transplant, but continued his drinking and drug use. In January 1999 he was driving a car which was involved in a collision. He was hospitalised overnight and released with bruising. A few days later he died at home, on 2 February 1999 just before his 37th birthday. In February 2000, after the State Coroner of Victoria finally published his findings, The West Australian newspaper wrote: \\"Mr Johnstone [the Coroner] said McComb's mental and physical condition had deteriorated after his accident but his death was due to heroin toxicity and mild acute rejection of his 1996 heart transplant.\\" His ashes were spread under the pine trees at the family farm (Woodstock) at Jerdacuttup, approximately 22 km north of Hopetoun, Western Australia. Legacy and influence In 2001 the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th Anniversary celebrations, named his 1986 composition \\"Wide Open Road\\" as one of the thirty greatest Australian songs of all time. On 21 February 2006 David McComb was posthumously inducted into the West Australian Music Industry Association Hall of Fame, as a composer. In June 2006, his work with The Triffids was reissued in remastered and extended form on the Domino label, commencing with Born Sandy Devotional. McComb's work is held in high regard in Europe, to the extent that The Triffids reformed and travelled from Australia to play live performances in Belgium and the Netherlands, in July 2006, with guest vocalists replacing McComb. The band also played four consecutive nights in Sydney in January 2008 with many guest singers and musicians, including Mick Harvey, Rob Snarski and Melanie Oxley. These performances were released as a DVD (It's Raining Pleasure) in late 2009. On 1 July 2008 The Triffids were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame with McComb's contribution acknowledge by a tribute performance. In September 2009, \\"Vagabond Holes: David McComb & The Triffids\\" - edited by Chris Coughran and Niall Lucy, and featuring contributions from Nick Cave, DBC Pierre, Laurie Duggan, John Kinsella, Bleddyn Butcher, Steve Kilbey, Robert Forster, \\"Handsome\\" Steve Miller and others - was published by Fremantle Press. A feature length biopic entitled Love in Bright Landscapes (working title only), commenced shooting in January 2008. It is being produced by Melbourne-based Tornado Alley Productions. In late 2009, a live tribute album entitled Deep in a Dream: An Evening with the Songs of David McComb, featuring The Blackeyed Susans and other Melbourne-based acts, was issued by the filmmakers to help fund the ongoing production of the documentary. In 2009 a collection of David McComb's poems, titled Beautiful Waste: Poems by David McComb, was published by Fremantle Press. The anthology was edited by Chris Coughran and Niall Lucy, and includes an introduction by poet John Kinsella. In 2020 an album of cover versions of McComb's unreleased songs was released under the name of The Friends Of David McComb. It featured artists including Frente!'s Angie Hart.

His writing often draws on the history and landscape of Newfoundland and Labrador. Early life and education Crummey was born in Buchans, Newfoundland; he grew up there and in Wabush, Labrador, where he moved with his family in the late 1970s.\\"Michael Crummey writing the poetry and stories of Newfoundland\\". CBC Radio Canada International, By Carmel Kilkenny  23 March 2017 He began to write poetry while studying at Memorial University in St. John's, where he won the university's Gregory J. Power Poetry Contest in 1986 and received a B.A. in English in 1987. He completed a M.A. at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, in 1988, later leaving the Ph.D. program to pursue his writing career.\\"Michael Crummey\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia Career In 1994, he became the first winner of the Bronwen Wallace Memorial Award for young unpublished writers. His first volume of poetry, Arguments with Gravity (1996), won the Writer's Alliance of Newfoundland and Labrador Book Award for Poetry. Hard Light (1998), and his second collection was nominated for the Milton Acorn People's Poetry Award in 1999. Also in 1998, Crummey published a collection of short stories, Flesh and Blood, all of which take place in the fictional mining community of Black Rock, which strongly resembles Buchans. That year Crummey was nominated for the Journey Prize. Crummey returned to St. John's in 2001. Inthat year published his debut novel, River Thieves, which details the contact and conflict between European settlers and the last of the Beothuk in the early 19th century, including the capture of Demasduwit. The book became a Canadian bestseller, and won the Thomas Head Raddall Award, the Winterset Award for Excellence in Newfoundland Writing, and the Atlantic Independent Booksellers' Choice Award. It was also shortlisted for the Giller Prize, the Commonwealth Writers' Prize, the Books in Canada First Novel Award, and was long-listed for the International Dublin Literary Award. Crummy's second novel, The Wreckage was published in 2005; the story of young Newfoundland soldier Wish Fury and his beloved Sadie Parsons during and after World War II, it was longlisted for the 2007 IMPAC Award.

Moritz Traube - portrait, source: Ber. d. deutschen chem. Gesellsch. 28 (1895) S. 1085 Traube worked on chemical, biochemical, medical, physiological, pathophysiological problems. He was engaged in hygienics, physical chemistry and basic chemical research. Although he was never a staff member of a university and earned his living as a wine merchant, he was able to refute theories of his leading contemporaries, including Justus von Liebig, Louis Pasteur, Felix Hoppe-Seyler and Julius Sachs, and to develop significant theories of his own with solid experimental foundations. The chemistry of oxygen and its significance to the organism were the central objects of his research and provided the common thread uniting almost all of his scientific activity. Moritz Traube was a younger brother of the famous Berlin physician Ludwig Traube (physician), the co-founder of the German experimental pathology. A son, Wilhelm Traube, evolved a process of purine synthesis. Hermann Traube, another son, was a mineralogist.  Biography   Education period  Traube's father was a Jewish wine merchant, the grandson of a rabbi from Krakow. Traube graduated from the Gymnasium in the provincial town of Ratibor when he was only 16 years old. His older brother Ludwig advised him to begin scientific studies at the University of Berlin (1842-1844). He studied experimental chemistry with Eilhard Mitscherlich, chemistry and stoichiometry with Heinrich Rose, mineralogy with Christian Samuel Weiss, physics with Heinrich Wilhelm Dove; and practised experimental chemistry in the laboratory of Karl Friedrich August Rammelsberg. He moved to Giessen to participate in Liebig's practical-analytical course in 1844/45. He attended lectures in botany (Hermann Hoffmann) and logic (Moritz Carrière). In 1845 he returned to Berlin (geology with Heinrich Girard). In 1847 he received his doctorate with a thesis entitled \\"De nonnullis chromii connubiis\\". The later well-known botanist Nathanael Pringsheim supported him. For a while Traube worked in a Berlin dyeworks (1848/49), then continued his studies: anatomy with Friedrich Schlemm, physiology and comparative anatomy with Johannes Müller, pathology with Rudolf Virchow and pharmacology with Eilhard Mitscherlich. For a few weeks he attended lectures in clinical disciplines such as surgery (with Bernhard von Langenbeck) and auscultation and percussion (Ludwig Traube). The extraordinarily wide spectrum of his qualifications was a basis of his universal research.  The period in Ratibor (1849–1866)  When another brother, who was to have taken over their father's wine business, suddenly died of diabetes, Traube's father ordered him home to Ratibor to help manage the business. After agonizing for several weeks, Traube complied. But he could not abandon science. In a poorly-heated attic of his house, lacking time and money, isolated from scientific communication, he developed his extensive chemical-physiological projects. He completed numerous well-planned, accurately executed experiments, the correctness of which his contemporaries were forced to acknowledge. Traube was also successful as a wine merchant. Together with his brother Ludwig he donated 500 Taler to the Ratibor Gymnasium for students' prizes. He married Bertha Moll of Lissa in 1855. The marriage produced 3 daughters and 2 sons.  The period in Breslau (1866–1891)  To facilitate his research Traube moved to Breslau. He worked for a time in the laboratory of his friend Theodor Poleck and in the Physiological Institute of Rudolf Heidenhain. Later he erected his own, well equipped laboratory and employed assistants. Every year he travelled to Hungary to survey and purchase wine himself. One of his customers was Otto von Bismarck. In 1886 Traube resigned from business. From 1866 to 1890 he was a member of the \\"Schlesische Gesellschaft für vaterländische Kultur“. He was elected to the board of this society in 1884.  The period in Berlin (1891–1894)  When Traube came to Berlin, he was already ill, probably from diabetes and coronary ischaemia. Here his two sons were employed at the university. He worked tirelessly even in the last year of his life. His death attracted great attention. He was laid to rest in the cemetery in Gudrunstrasse, Berlin-Lichtenberg. On the grave, no longer preserved, stood a bronze bust by the sculptor Fritz Schaper. The gypsum model survives in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin.  Scientific achievements   Medicine and clinical chemistry  Traube showed that sugar excretion in the urine of a diabetic patient rose after starch intake but fell after protein consumption. Additionally he demonstrated the unrestricted intestinal absorption of fats in diabetics. He thus contributed to the scientific basis for a diabetic diet. For diagnosis he proposed to measure sugar levels at specific, regular intervals: in the morning before breakfast and after meals. He thus anticipated modern principles of blood sugar measurements. Elsewhere he investigated the laxative qualities of lactose.  Theory of fermentation  Traube's main work, the Theorie der Fermentwirkungen (1858) is the first comprehensive theory of fermentation to be based on experiments and elaborated consequently from the chemical point of view. The discovery in 1837 that yeast was a living organism suggested that fermentation itself was a living process. Only a few scientists rejected this vitalistic protoplasm theory, notably Traube. He was the first to define enzymes as specific protein-like compounds and to formulate the necessity of direct molecular contact between enzyme and substrate for fermentation to occur. He classified enzymes by reaction type, much as is done today. Long before Eduard Buchner discovered non-cellular fermentation in 1897, Traube isolated an enzyme from potatoes which could turn guaiacum blue, thus demonstrating the continued efficacy of plant enzymes after they had been extracted from the cell. Until recently, biochemical history has not noted that Traube began to investigate the kinetics of reactions and also demonstrated a reciprocal relationship between reaction time and quantity of enzyme. To defend his theory, Traube had to argue vigorously against Louis Pasteur and Felix Hoppe-Seyler. He contradicted Pasteur's assertion that fermentation could not occur without vital activity. In the context of these experiments Traube became the first to describe a process for making pure yeast. His differences with Hoppe-Seyler had to do with the mechanism by which oxygen was activated in fermentation reactions. Traube's experiments were designed to demonstrate activation via enzymes as catalysts and refute Hoppe- Seyler's hypothesis of oxygen activation by nascent hydrogen produced by enzymes.  Physiology of plants and the invention of artificial semipermeable membranes  In 1864 Traube was the first to produce artificial semipermeable membranes, recognizing them as molecular sieves and using them in developing the first physical-chemical theory of plant cell growth. The artificial cells were created by putting droplets of glue in tannic acid; these grew under infusion of water. (Other membranes were created with tannic acid plus verdigris or potassium ferrocyanide plus copper chloride). These membranes laid the foundation for research into osmotic pressure in solutions (Wilhelm Pfeffer and Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff used them), and Traube himself did research on the manifestations of diffusion and osmosis.  Pathophysiology, bacteriology and hygienics  Traube also made an important contribution to the study of the etiology of disease. Together with Gscheidlen, an assistant of Rudolf Heidenhain he was the first to demonstrate via animal experiments that the organism has the ability to eliminate putrefactive bacteria. In evaluating the results, he distinguished chemical poisoning from infection with microorganisms on the one hand, and pathogenic from putrefactive bacteria on the other. Further, he was the first to propose a relation between immune system to infections and active oxygen in the blood cells. In his last work Traube proposed disinfecting drinking water with calcium chloride. This technique became very important. By 1914 the method was used in more than 100 cities in America. It was reintroduced to Germany after World War II via the American occupation.  Biological oxidation  Traube developed a homogeneous concept of the critical significance of cellular respiration for the generation of heat, formation and maintenance of structures and organ function. From his point of view biological oxidation takes place not only in the blood but in all tissues. Traube's theory of muscular metabolism is significant because it showed the close relationship between respiration, muscular activity and heat generation, thus contributed to the refutation of Liebig's theory of nutrients. The substrates for creating muscle power were thus primarily nitrogen-free compounds and not just proteins. To investigate the process of enzymatic oxygen activation in organisms Traube did experimental research into inorganic autoxidation and oxygen activation. He thus demonstrated the role of water as active partner in slow oxidations and showed the intermediate character of hydrogen peroxide generation.  Accolades and appreciations  In consistently applying chemistry to physiology, Traube was a follower of Liebig and peer of Hoppe- Seyler. Traube produced 51 publications, lectured and occasionally taught. His significant pupils were Guido Bodländer and his own son Wilhelm Traube. His biochemical concepts influenced later research. In his time he was especially noted for his clarification of the role of nutrients in metabolism and his work with semipermeable membranes. The University of Halle-Wittenberg conferred an honorary doctorate of medicine on Traube in 1867 and he was elected a corresponding member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin in 1886. Louis Pasteur called Traube an excellent physiologist and professor; extensive appreciations were written by August Wilhelm von Hofmann, Hermann Emil Fischer and Ferdinand Cohn. In 1875 Charles Darwin had asked Traube to send him his work on cell formation. Philosophers, too, showed great interest in his results. In the 1870s Karl Marx met Traube in Karlsbad to learn more about inorganic cells because Friedrich Engels was working on the relation between organic and inorganic nature, i.e., the dialectics of nature in Anti- Dühring, and Traube's artificial cells served as models of living plant cells. When the young Robert Koch in 1876 presented his discovery of bacillus anthracis as the specific cause of anthrax to the leading bacteriologist Ferdinand Cohn in Breslau, Traube, who had by then achieved academic recognition, was one of the few invited to witness this momentous event.

Early life  On 18 May 1863, Heinemann was born in Surbiton, Surrey, England. Heinemann's father Louis Heinemann, a director of Parr's Bank and a native of Hanover, Germany. Heinemann's mother was Jane Lavino. Both his parents were Jewish by descent, although they had been Anglican for two generations. In his early life he wanted to be a musician, either as a performer or a composer, but he came to believe that he lacked the ability to be successful in that field.  Career  Heinemann took a job with the music publishing company of Nicolas Trübner. When Trübner died in 1884, Heinemann founded his own publishing house in Covent Garden in 1890. The company published many translations of the classics in Great Britain as well as publishing such authors as H. G. Wells, Robert Louis Stevenson, Rudyard Kipling and Sylvia Plath.  Personal life  On 2 February 1899, Heinemann married Magda Stuart Sindici, a writer who used the pseudonym Kassandra Vivaria, at St. Antonio's Church in Anzio, Italy. Her father was Augusto Sindici, an Italian poet. Her mother was Francesca Stuart Sindici, a Spanish-Italian painter. Wedding guest included James Abbott McNeill Whistler, a painter. Whistler attended their wedding as the bestman and painted the bride's portrait in 1900. In 1904, Heinemann divorced his wife. On 5 October 1920, Heinemann died unexpectedly in London, England.Hall Caine: Portrait of a Victorian Romancer by Vivian Allen, Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1997, pp.373-384 Heinemann had no children and his presumptive heir, his nephew John Heinemann, had died in the First World War. Heinemann's share of the company was bought out by Frank Nelson Doubleday, the New York publisher. He bequeathed funds to the Royal Society of Literature to establish a literary prize, the W. H. Heinemann Award, awarded from 1945 to 2003.

It is produced by Beiersdorf AG in Germany and Austria. The labello lip care sticks are also sold under the name Labello Nivea, Liposan and Nivea Lip Care. Labello makes lip care products that are used for medical treatments, moisturizing, protection from sun or solely for cosmetic purposes. The word \\"labello\\" comes from the Latin words \\"labium\\" (\\"lip\\") and \\"bellus\\" (\\"beautiful\\"). History In 1909, Dr. Oscar Troplowitz created a lip caring balm. The brand was introduced in Germany and later in Switzerland and Austro-Hungary. At that time, the products were sticks wrapped in paper that had to be applied with a finger. In 1911, a new sliding case made of tin was introduced. This turned out to be a rather successful approach. During the First World War, the shortage of the tin resources caused the production of tin packaging to be stopped. However, refills that could be inserted in the existing tubes were available in the market. In 1922, the packaging was replaced with a light aluminium stick, which made it easier for the consumer to carry it around. This was also a success. By 1935, Labello was made available in markets of over thirty countries. During the Second World War, Labello products were again in extremely short supply as aluminum was almost unobtainable until the end of the war. In 1953, a plastic sleeve replaced the metal one, which had been used for more than 30 years. In 1958, Labello started to make products for use by men as well. A practical twist mechanism was added in 1963, making application easier. This was apparently the most successful product launch in the history of the Labello brand. In 1973, the 'Labello Classic' in blue casing was introduced which is produced even today. In 1978, the brand released 'Labello Med' that provided treatment for severe lip problems. A year later, 'Labello Sun' was introduced which provided protection of lips from harmful sun rays. In 1984, another product, 'Labello Camomile' was made available in market. This was the first time the brand made a product containing natural flavors and ingredients. Two years later, 'Labello Rosé' was also released. In 1989, 'Labello Sport' was introduced for physically active consumers who wanted lip care. In 1992, 'Lip Balance' series were released for consumers wanting immediate moisturizing for their lips. The series consisted of two products: 'Labello Hydro', which is still used today and 'Labello Regeneration'. The later of which was the first product in the brand to be released in a squeezable tube packaging. Two years later, 'Labello UV Alpin' was made available that provided care for lips in winter and cold weathers. In 1999, the brand launched 17 different fruit flavored lip pomades for the first time including 'Apricot Cream', 'Lemon Twist', 'Manadarin Vanilla', 'Orange', 'Sweet Melon' and 'Tropical Shake' among others. Today's assortment includes 'Cherry', 'Strawberry','Pomegranate' and 'Pink Guava'. In 2001, a lip balm and gloss, 'Labello Pearl & Shine', was introduced for women. This marked the first time the brand took a turn into the cosmetics direction. Three years later, 'Care Gloss & Shine' lip gloss range were introduced in the market. These were available in trendy colours and as well as a transparent gloss. In 2009, Labello celebrated their 100 years by launching a limited edition of 'Labello Classic'.

Such a registration is achieved by filing a concurrent use application (or by converting an existing application to a concurrent use application) and then prevailing in a concurrent use proceeding before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (\\"TTAB\\"), which is a judicial body within the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\\"USPTO\\"). A concurrent use application may be filed with respect to a trademark which is already registered or otherwise in use by another party, but may be allowed to go forward based on the assertion that the existing use can co-exist with the new registration without causing consumer confusion. The authority for this type of registration is set forth in the Lanham Act, which permits concurrent use registration where the concurrent use applicant made a good-faith adoption of the mark prior to the registrant filing an application for registration. Such registrations are most commonly achieved by agreement of the parties involved, although the USPTO must still determine that no confusion will be caused. Statutory basis The authority of the USPTO to issue a concurrent use registration is set forth in the Lanham Act, section 2 (d), enacted in 1947 and coded at , which states in relevant part: The headquarters of the United States Patent and Trademark Office in Alexandria, Virginia, where Concurrent Use applications are evaluated. Through these provisions, the Act effectively places three requirements on marks for which a later applicant seeks a concurrent use registration: :1) the later applicant must have used the mark in commerce prior to the time that the earlier registrant filed its application for registration, unless the senior registrant consents to the junior user's registration; :2) the later applicant's use in commerce must have been lawful :3) concurrent use of the marks must not result in a likelihood of confusion. The statute essentially codifies the Tea Rose- Rectanus doctrine, established by the United States Supreme Court in two cases decided in 1916 and 1918.Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U.S. 403 (1916) (the \\"Tea Rose\\" case), and United Drug Co. v. Theodore Rectanus Co., 248 U.S. 90 (1918). The Court had established in those cases that a junior user of a mark that is geographically remote from the senior user of the mark may establish priority over a senior user's claim to the mark in the junior user's area. Any party may voluntarily limit the geographic scope of its application while conceding the rights of another party to a different geographic territory.TMEP § 1207.04(a), Concurrent Use – In General. A concurrent use application may not be filed based on a party's intent to use a mark, but must rely on actual use in commerce.TMEP § 1207.04(b), Filing Basis of Application Seeking Concurrent Use. The concurrent use application must identify all other parties who are entitled to use the mark, and provide the names and addresses of the parties identified.TMEP § 1207.04(d)(i), Requirements for All Concurrent Use Applications. Instead of making the usual assertion that no other party has the right to use the mark, the applicant must assert that no other party \\"except as specified in the application\\" has such a right. Where two or more geographically unrestricted applications are pending at the same time, and no registration has yet been issued, the USPTO will proceed with the earliest application, and put all later applications on hold pending a determination on the earliest.TMEP § 1208.01, Priority for Publication or Issue Based on Effective Filing Date. Use in commerce prior to an adverse filing for registration By the terms of the Act, the critical dates with respect to concurrent registration are the date of the applicant's first use and the earliest filing date of any other registrant. In other words, as the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Manual of Procedure (\\"TBMP\\") states, \\"an application seeking concurrent registration through a concurrent use proceeding normally must assert a date of first use in commerce prior to the earliest application filing date of the application(s)... involved in the proceeding.\\"TBMP § 1103.01(b) (2004). The TBMP has twelve chapters, numbered 100 through 1200; Chapter 1100 is dedicated entirely to the subject of \\"Concurrent Use Proceedings\\". The Lanham Act requires that an Applicant's use in commerce must have been lawful. The TTAB (and its predecessor, the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (\\"CCPA\\")) has read this to mean that the applicant's use must not have infringed another party's use at the time that applicant adopted its mark. Therefore, one potential pitfall facing applicant is that \\"[g]enerally, concurrent rights arise when a party, in good faith, and without knowledge of a prior party's use in another geographic area, adopts and uses the same or similar mark for the same or similar goods or services within its own geographic area.\\"TBMP § 1103.01(d)(2). The mere fact that an applicant's use was geographically remote from a registrant or other opposer's use does not establish good faith, as \\"courts have generally held that the remote use defense... is unavailable where the junior user adopts a substantially identical mark in a remote geographic area with full knowledge of the senior user's prior use elsewhere.\\"Woman's World Shops Inc. v. Lane Bryant Inc., 1988 TTAB LEXIS 72 (TTAB 1988). However, the TTAB has also previously held that \\"mere knowledge of the existence of the prior user should not, by itself, constitute bad faith.\\"Weiner King, Inc. v. Wiener King Corp., 615 F.2d 512, 522 (CCPA 1980) (applicant did not know of a prior use of the mark at the time it was adopted, but the applicant expanded the use of its mark after learning of the prior use). Likelihood of confusion The factors under which the TTAB evaluates the likelihood of confusion were established in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.,In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 177 USPQ 563 (CCPA 1973). and are commonly referred to as the \\"du Pont factors\\". The thirteen du Pont factors are: :(1) The similarity or dissimilarity of the marks in their entireties as to appearance, sound, connotation and commercial impression. :(2) The similarity or dissimilarity and nature of the goods or services as described in an application or registration or in connection with which a prior mark is in use. :(3) The similarity or dissimilarity of established, likely-to-continue trade channels. :(4) The conditions under which and buyers to whom sales are made, i.e. \\"impulse\\" vs. careful, sophisticated purchasing. :(5) The fame of the prior mark (sales, advertising, length of use). :(6) The number and nature of similar marks in use on similar goods. :(7) The nature and extent of any actual confusion. :(8) The length of time during and conditions under which there has been concurrent use without evidence of actual confusion. :(9) The variety of goods on which a mark is or is not used (house mark, \\"family\\" mark, product mark). :(10) The market interface between applicant and the owner of a prior mark: ::(a) a mere \\"consent\\" to register or use. ::(b) agreement provisions designed to preclude confusion, i.e. limitations on continued use of the marks by each party. ::(c) assignment of mark, application, registration and good will of the related business. ::(d) laches and estoppel attributable to owner of prior mark and indicative of lack of confusion. :(11) The extent to which applicant has a right to exclude others from use of its mark on its goods. :(12) The extent of potential confusion, i.e., whether de minimis or substantial. :(13) Any other established fact probative of the effect of use.In re E. I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973). In many instances, only a few of the categories will be applicable to the facts of the case before the TTAB. Procedure to acquire The procedures to acquire such a registration are set forth in the TBMP Chapter 1100. They are initiated when a concurrent use application is submitted to the USPTO, which will initiate a concurrent use proceeding to determine if the applicant is entitled to such registration. An existing application that has been denied registration because of a conflict with an existing mark may be converted into a concurrent use application against that existing mark. In either case, the applicant must assert that its mark was used in commerce before the owner of the existing registration, called the \\"senior registrant\\", had filed its own application for registration. The applicant must also demonstrate that the marks can both be used in their specific geographic areas without causing a likelihood of confusion. The USPTO will contact the senior registrant to inform that party of the claim against their mark. The proceeding in which the respective rights of the parties are determined is like a trial in which the applicant must submit evidence showing that the applicant had adopted the mark in good faith, that the applicant had adopted the mark prior to the senior registrant's date of registration, and that the confusion is not likely. The senior registrant may present evidence to the contrary, in order to prevent the loss of control over the use of the registered mark in the applicant's claimed territory. Both parties may take discovery in the form of requests for admission, interrogatories, requests for production, and depositions. As with a regular trial, the TTAB may be called upon to resolve disputes over whether discovery requests are overbroad, and whether discovery responses are inadequate. The senior registrant in such a proceeding has ample incentive to oppose the grant of a concurrent use registration, because a registered trademark is presumed to apply throughout the entire United States. Thus, the grant of a concurrent use registration carves out some geographic territory from the senior registrant's exclusive control. As 15 U.S.C. § 1052 (d) indicates, a concurrent use registration may also be issued \\"when a court of competent jurisdiction has finally determined that more than one person is entitled to use the same or similar marks in commerce.\\" As a matter of right, the TTAB will issue such a registration pursuant to a court order that an applicant has the right to use its mark in certain geographic area. Where a court has issued such an order, a concurrent use proceeding is not needed, as evidence has already been taken in the court proceeding, and the rights of the parties have already been determined. Most concurrent use proceedings result in a legal settlement between the parties.Cheryl L. Slay, in Brian E. Banner, Trademark Infringement Remedies, 2007 Cumulative Supplement (2007) p. 35. Frequently, one party will surrender its concurrent use claim and instead receive a trademark license from the other party. In other situations, each party may agree to geographic limitations on its use of the mark at issue, which the TTAB will honor if the settlement stipulates to facts which show that no confusion is likely. A benefit of such an agreement is that the parties can agree to terms beyond the scope of the TTAB's decision, such as specific restrictions on time and place of advertising, or modifications to the appearance of either mark. However, irrespective of the agreement reached, the TTAB must still make an independent finding that no consumer confusion is likely to result from the concurrent use registration. Even if both parties assert that no confusion is likely, the TTAB may still make findings of fact which demonstrate that confusion is likely, and deny registration to the junior user of the mark. A pivotal factor in assessing the likelihood of confusion in such a circumstance \\"is whether the parties whose marks are in question have agreed, in some form, to memorialize methods of avoiding confusion.\\"Amalgamated Bank of New York v. Amalgamated Trust & Savings Bank, 842 F.2d 1270, 1273 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In that case, the court held that such an agreement \\"is viewed in light of the parties' interests and the prevailing marketplace\\", further stating: Furthermore, the issuance of concurrent use registrations need not prevent either party from engaging in advertising or other activities which might result in the incidental publication of one registrant's mark in the territory of the other registrant. In the Amalgamated Bank case, the Federal Circuit found acceptable a term in the agreement that \\"nothing in this agreement will preclude Amalgamated New York from conducting advertising which might enter in the State of Illinois or from dealing with customers who happen to be located in the State of Illinois.\\"Amalgamated Bank, 842 F.2d at 1272. Courts have similarly held that a concurrent use registration does not curtail either party from advertising over the Internet, particularly where the junior user includes a disclaimer of some form on their website. Geographic divisions A concurrent use registration can be very detailed in the geographic divisions laid down. It may, for example, allow one party to own the right to use a mark within a fifty-mile radius around a handful of selected cities or counties, while the other party owns the right to use the same mark everywhere else in the country. It may even divide the rights to use a mark within a particular city by reference to roads or other landmarks in that city. The TTAB succinctly describes its territorial analysis in Weiner King, Inc. v. Wiener King Corp.:Weiner King, Inc. v. Wiener King Corp., 615 F.2d 512, 523 (CCPA 1980). The TTAB has found that in concurrent use proceedings, \\"[t]he area for which registration is sought is usually more extensive than the area in which applicant is actually using the mark.\\" \\"As a general rule, a prior user of a mark is entitled to a registration covering the entire United States limited only to the extent that the subsequent user can establish that no likelihood of confusion exists and that it has concurrent rights in its actual area of use, plus its area of natural expansion.\\"Pinocchio's Pizza, Inc. v. Sandra, Inc., 11 USPQ2d 1227 (TTAB 1989). Between lawful concurrent users of the same mark in geographically separate markets, the senior registrant has the right to maintain his registration for at least those market areas in which it is using the mark. However, the senior registrant does not always maintain the right to use the mark in territories not yet occupied by either party. In Pinocchio's Pizza, for example, the first applicant (but the junior user of the mark in commerce) owned one small restaurant in Maryland and had expressed no plans for expansion, while the second applicant (but senior user of the mark in commerce) owned multiple restaurants in Texas and was planning aggressive expansion. The TTAB held that \\"purpose of the statute is best served by granting [the second] applicant a registration for the entire United States except for registrant's trading area.\\" The TTAB therefore restricted the first applicant's registration to permit exclusive use in Maryland, and within 50 miles of the first applicant's restaurant in areas crossing into other states. Furthermore, although the general rule provides that the entire United States should be covered by the respective registrations, it is permissible for parties to a proceeding to resolve the issue of territorial rights in a way that leaves some part of the country uncovered entirely. In a contested proceeding In re Beatrice Foods Co., the court held that the senior user of a mark was entitled to a registration covering the entire United States, outside of the junior user's area of actual use. However, the court went on to say: The few courts that have considered the antitrust implications of concurrent use registration have determined that it does not raise any violation of antitrust laws. Although it is considered a violation of such laws for companies to agree to divide up geographic territories for the sale of goods, concurrent use agreements dividing up trademark territories are specifically provided for by Congress. Furthermore, even with such an agreement in place, a company can still sell competing products in the trademark territory of another company, so long as the intruding party sells that product under a different mark.See, e.g., VMG Enterprises, Inc. v. F. Quesada & Franco, Inc., 788 F. Supp. 648 (D.P.R. 1992). Impact The availability of concurrent use registration is not commonly invoked, even where the applicant might stand an excellent chance of demonstrating the existence of geographically distinct markets. Proceedings before the TTAB, like proceedings before any court, can be expensive and time-consuming. A contested concurrent use proceeding may last for two or three years before the resolution of a claim, and the outcome will remain uncertain until the end. The outcome of the proceeding will then be subject to an appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or to a collateral challenge in a United States District Court. Perhaps the most notable instance of a continuing concurrent use registration is that of Holiday Inn. Although the national chain owns numerous trademark registrations, there is one registration for an unrelated \\"Holiday Inn\\" which is \\"restricted to the area comprising the town of Myrtle Beach, S.C.\\". The Myrtle Beach hotel had used that name since the 1940s, and initiated a concurrent use proceeding in 1970. While this proceeding was pending, the national chain commenced an action in the United States District Court. The concurrent use proceeding was suspended during the pendency of the federal litigation, which resulted in a judgment in 1973 authorizing the Myrtle Beach hotel to use a distinctive, noninfringing Holiday Inn service mark within the Town of Myrtle Beach. Holiday Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Inn, 364 F. Supp. 775, 786-87 (D.S.C.1973), aff'd 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 8226, 182 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 129 (4th Cir. 1974). The concurrent use proceeding resumed, and in 1976, the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals awarded the Myrtle Beach hotel a federal trademark registration.Holiday Inn v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 534 F.2d 312 (C.C.P.A.1976). Even where a concurrent use registration is issued, the parties may eventually come to an agreement under which one party will surrender its registration. In some instances, a party will simply happen to cease using the mark in favor of a new brand name, and the registration will lapse.

He was posthumously made a Hero of the Soviet Union. Biography Ivan Golubets was born in the city of Taganrog on 8 May 1916 into the family of a Ukrainian worker. He worked at the iron and steel factory after 7 years in Taganrog's high school No. 2. In 1937, Ivan Golubets enrolled into the Soviet Navy. In 1939, he graduated from the Coast-guard school in Balaklava, and served at the 2nd and in the 1st divisions of the Black Sea Fleet's coast-guard ships in the city of Novorossiysk. He participated in World War II beginning in June 1941, serving as steersman on the corvette (сторожевой корабль) SK-0183 (3rd division of guard-ships), making the brave feat in the spring of 1942 in Sevastopol. On 25 March 1942 German artillery fired at the Streletskaya Bay, the engine department of another guard ship, SK-0121, was hit and burst into flames. Ivan Golubets took necessary measures for extinguishing the fire. After the second shell hit the Soviet ship, there was an explosion of the fuel tanks, which could lead to the explosion of anti- submarine bombs on board, threatening a chain explosion on other ships in the Bay. Golubets understood the situation and started rolling the anti-submarine depth bombs off the ship, until the last bomb exploded, but many other ships and people's lives were saved. On 14 June 1942, Presidium of the Supreme Soviet issued a decree posthumously naming Ivan Golubets the Hero of the Soviet Union.

He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the St. Louis Browns, Philadelphia Phillies, and Chicago Cubs. Killefer, who was nicknamed \\"Reindeer Bill\\" due to his speed afoot, is notable for being the favorite catcher of Hall of Fame pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander and, for being one of the top defensive catchers of his era.Deadball stars of the National League, Thomas P. Simon, Brassey's, 2004 After his playing career, he continued to work as a coach and a manager for a Major League Baseball career that spanned a total of 48 years. Major League career Killefer made his major league debut at the age of 21 with the St. Louis Browns on September 13, 1909. After the 1910 season in which the Browns finished in last place, Killefer was released to the Buffalo Bisons of the Eastern League. Under the tutelage of Bisons' manager George Stallings, Killefer developed into a refined catcher. His contract was purchased by the Philadelphia Phillies on August 19, 1911, and he played his first game as a starter on October 3. The Phillies pitcher on that day was Grover Cleveland Alexander, and the game marked the first of 250 times the pair teamed up as a battery in the major leagues. Although he was a light hitter, Killefer became known for his strong defensive skills. In 1913, he led National League catchers with 166 assists, 130 baserunners caught stealing, a 50.6% caught stealing percentage, and finished second in putouts and fielding percentage. In 1914, Killefer made news when it was reported that he had signed with the Chicago Whales of the Federal League, although he denied the report. When the Phillies offered him a salary increase, he decided to sign with the Phillies, which led the Federal League to file a lawsuit against him and the Phillies. A judge ruled against the Federal League and Killefer remained with the Phillies. From 1915 to 1917, Alexander and Killefer solidified their reputation as the best battery in baseball, with Alexander posting three consecutive 30-win seasons. Killefer had one of his best seasons for the Phillies in 1917. He led National League catchers with a .984 fielding percentage, as well as in putouts, double plays, and total chances. He also had one of his best seasons offensively with a .274 batting average. After the 1917 season, in one of the most lopsided trades in major league history, the financially strapped Phillies sent Killefer and Alexander to the Chicago Cubs for two players and $55,000 in cash. With the Cubs, Killefer was credited with strengthening their pitching staff.Babe Ruth and the 1918 Red Sox, Allan Wood, iUniverse, 2000 The Cubs won the 1918 National League pennant before losing to the Boston Red Sox in the 1918 World Series. Killefer had another strong season in 1919, hitting a career-high .286 batting average and leading National League catchers in fielding percentage, putouts and assists. He served as player-manager for the Cubs in 1921 before retiring as a player at age 33. Career statistics In a thirteen-year major league career, Killefer played in 1,035 games, accumulating 751 hits in 3,150 at bats for a .238 career batting average along with 4 home runs and 240 runs batted in. He had a career fielding percentage of .977. While he was not a powerful hitter, he possessed a strong throwing arm and a talent for working with pitchers. Killefer led National League catchers in fielding percentage four consecutive seasons from 1916 to 1919. He also led the league three times in putouts, assists and in baserunners caught stealing. Killefer caught 115 shutouts in his career, ranking him 16th all-time among major league catchers. Killefer's reputation as a defensive standout is enhanced because of the era in which he played. In the Deadball Era, catchers played a huge defensive role, given the large number of bunts and stolen base attempts, as well as the difficulty of handling the spitball pitchers who dominated pitching staffs. Richard Kendall of the Society for American Baseball Research devised an unscientific study that ranked Killefer as the most dominating fielding catcher in major league history. Managing and coaching career After his playing career ended, Killefer continued as manager of the Cubs until he was fired after 75 games in 1925. He was hired by St. Louis Cardinals manager Rogers Hornsby as a coach for the 1926 season. The Cardinals went on to win the 1926 World Series with Killefer receiving credit for his help with the pitching staff. In 1927, he was hired by the St. Louis Browns as a coach, and became their manager in 1930. Killefer enjoyed little success as the Browns' manager, never finishing above fifth place as the depression-era team had cut its payroll significantly. He was fired in 1933 and took two years off from organised baseball. Killefer accepted a role as manager for the Sacramento Solons in the Pacific Coast League, leading them to a first-place finish in 1937. He later coached for the Brooklyn Dodgers and managed the minor league Milwaukee Brewers. His managerial record was 524–622 (.457) in nine seasons. Killefer's last on-the-field position in the major leagues was as a coach for the 1942 Philadelphia Phillies. He also served as a scout for the Cleveland Indians, the Phillies and the Dodgers. As a scout for the Indians, Killefer was involved in the signing of Larry Doby in 1947 (the American League's first black player). Killefer was credited with helping the development of such catching standouts as Bob O'Farrell, Gabby Hartnett, Rick Ferrell, and Walker Cooper. He died in Elsmere, Delaware, at age 72. His brother, Red Killefer, was also a major league baseball player. Political economist Nancy Killefer is a granddaughter.

She was also the great-grandmother of the Emperor Caligula and Empress Agrippina the Younger, maternal grandmother of the Emperor Claudius, and paternal great-grandmother and maternal great-great-grandmother of the Emperor Nero. One of the most prominent women in Roman history, Octavia was respected and admired by contemporaries for her loyalty, nobility and humanity, and for maintaining traditional Roman feminine virtues. Life Childhood Full sister to Augustus, Octavia was the only daughter born of Gaius Octavius' second marriage to Atia Balba Caesonia, niece of Julius Caesar.Suetonius, Augustus 4.1 Octavia was born in Nola, present-day Italy; her father, a Roman governor and senator, died in 59 BC from natural causes. Her mother later remarried, to the consul Lucius Marcius Philippus. Octavia spent much of her childhood travelling with her parents. Marcius was in charge of educating Octavia and her brother Octavian, later known as Augustus. First marriage Before 54 BC, her stepfather arranged for her to marry Gaius Claudius Marcellus (consul 50 BC). Marcellus was a man of consular rank, a man who was considered worthy of her and was consul in 50 BC. He was also a member of the influential Claudian family and descended from Marcus Claudius Marcellus, a famous general in the Second Punic War. In 54 BC, her great uncle Caesar is said to have been anxious for her to divorce her husband so that she could marry Pompey who had just lost his wife Julia (Julius Caesar's daughter, and thus Octavia's cousin once removed). The couple did not want to get a divorce so instead Pompey declined the proposalSuetonius, Caesar 27.1 and married Cornelia Metella. So Octavia's husband continued to oppose Julius Caesar including in the crucial year of his consulship 50 BC. Civil war broke out when Caesar invaded Italy from Gaul in 49 BC. Marcellus, a friend of Cicero, was an initial opponent of Julius Caesar when Caesar invaded Italy, but did not take up arms against his wife's great uncle at the Battle of Pharsalus, and was eventually pardoned by him. In 47 BC he was able to intercede with Caesar for his cousin and namesake, also a former consul, then living in exile. Presumably, Octavia continued to live with her husband from the time of their marriage (she would have been about 15 when they married) to her husband's death when she was about 29. They had three surviving children: Claudia Marcella Major, Claudia Marcella Minor and Marcus Claudius Marcellus.Suetonius, Augustus 63.1; Plutarch, Antony 87 All three were born in Italy. Although according to the anonymous Περὶ τοῦ καισαρείου γένους Octavia bore Marcellus four sons and four daughters.Spyridon Lambros, Ἀνέκδοτον ἀπόσπασμα συγγραϕῆς περὶ τοῦ Καισαρείου γένους, Νέος Ἑλληνομνήμων 1 (1904), p. 148https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/classical-quarterly/article/marcia- catonis-and-the-fulmen-clarum/786E542AA13E96391FB133D4AB8B369E Her husband Marcellus died in May 40 BC. Second marriage Mark Antony and Octavia By a Senatorial decree, Octavia married Mark Antony in October 40 BC, as his fourth wife (his third wife Fulvia having died shortly before). This marriage had to be approved by the Senate, as she was pregnant with her first husband's child, and was a politically motivated attempt to cement the uneasy alliance between her brother Octavian and Mark Antony; however, Octavia does appear to have been a loyal and faithful wife to Antony.Plutarch, Antony 31; Appian, Civil Wars 5.64 and 5.66; Cassius Dio, Roman History 48.31.3 Between 40 and 36 BC, she travelled with Antony to various provinces and lived with him in his Athenian mansion.Plutarch, Antony 33; Appian, Civil Wars 5.76 There she raised her children by Marcellus as well as Antony's two sons; Antyllus and Iullus, as well as the two daughters of her marriage to Antony, Antonia Major and Antonia Minor who were born there. Breakdown The alliance was severely tested by Antony's abandonment of Octavia and their children in favor of his former lover Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt (Antony and Cleopatra had met in 41 BC, an interaction that resulted in Cleopatra bearing twins, a boy and a girl). After 36 BC, Octavia returned to Rome with the daughters of her second marriage. On several occasions she acted as a political advisor and negotiator between her husband and brother.So at the treaty of Taranto in 37 BC: Plutarch, Antony 35; Appian, Civil Wars 5.93-95; Cassius Dio, Roman History 48.54 For example, in the spring of 37 BC, while pregnant with her daughter Antonia Minor, she was considered essential to an arms deal held at Tarentum, in which Antony and Augustus agreed to aid each other in their Parthian and Sicilian campaigns. She was hailed as a \\"marvel of womankind.\\" In 35 BC, after Antony suffered a disastrous campaign in Parthia, she brought fresh troops, provisions, and funds to Athens. There Antony had left a letter for her, instructing her to go no further.Plutarch, Antony 53; Cassius Dio, Roman History 49.33.3-4. See also a modern source, Mark Antony divorced Octavia in late 33 BC.Plutarch, Antony 57.4-5; Cassius Dio, Roman History 50.3.2 Following Antony's rejection of her and their divorce, Octavia became sole caretaker of their children.Plutarch, Antony 87; Cassius Dio, Roman History 51.15.5 She took his sons Antyllus and Iullus with her when she left Antony's house in 33. He had to sue her for custody and won back his sons, but not their daughters. After Antony's suicide in 30 BC, her brother executed Antyllus but allowed Octavia to raise Iullus and Antony's children by Cleopatra: The two sons Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus, and one daughter, Cleopatra Selene II. Later life Taillasson In 35 BC Augustus accorded a number of honours and privileges to Octavia, and Augustus' wife Livia, previously unheard of for women in Rome. They were granted sacrosanctitas, meaning it was illegal to verbally insult them. Previously, this had been only granted to tribunes. Livia and Octavia were made immune from tutela, the male guardianship which all women in Rome except for the Vestal Virgins were required to have. This meant they could freely manage their own finances. Finally, they were the first women in Rome to have statues and portraits displayed en masse in public places. Previously, only one woman, Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi, had been part of the public statues displayed in Rome. In Augustus' rebuilding of Rome as a city of marble, Octavia was featured. In all her representations she wore the \\"nodus\\" hairstyle, which at the time was considered conservative and dignified, and worn by women from many classes. Augustus adored, but never adopted, her son Marcellus. When Marcellus died of illness in 23 BC unexpectedly, Augustus was thunderstruck, Octavia disconsolate almost beyond recovery. Aelius Donatus, in his Life of Vergil, states that Virgil > recited three whole books [of his Aeneid] for Augustus: the second, fourth, > and sixth—this last out of his well-known affection for Octavia, who (being > present at the recitation) is said to have fainted at the lines about her > son, \\"… You shall be Marcellus\\" [Aen. 6.884]. Revived only with difficulty, > she sent Virgil ten thousand sesterces for each of the verses.\\"Life of > Virgil She may have never fully recovered from the death of her son and retired from public life, except on important occasions. The major source that Octavia never recovered is Seneca (De Consolatione ad Marciam, II.) but Seneca may wish to show off his rhetorical skill with hyperbole, rather than adhere to fact. Some dispute Seneca's version, for Octavia publicly opened the Library of Marcellus, dedicated in his memory, while her brother completed the Marcellus's theatre in his honor. Undoubtedly Octavia attended both ceremonies, as well as the Ara Pacis ceremony to welcome her brother's return in 13 from the provinces. She was also consulted in regard to, and in some versions advised, that Julia marry Agrippa after her mourning for Marcellus ended. Agrippa had to divorce Octavia's daughter Claudia Marcella Major in order to marry Julia, so Augustus wanted Octavia's endorsement very much. Death Today's appearance of the Porticus Octaviae. Octavia died of natural causes. Suetonius says she died in Augustus' 54th year, thus 11 BC with Roman inclusive counting.Suet. Div. Aug. 61. A Roman child is 1 year old until its 365th day, when it becomes 2. Thus Augustus' 54th year = 10 BC, since he was born in 63. Note that Dio 54.35.4-5 is not datable. Her funeral was a public one, with her sons-in-law (Drusus, Ahenobarbus, Iullus Antony, and possibly Paullus Aemillius Lepidus) carrying her to the grave in the Mausoleum of Augustus. Drusus delivered one funeral oration from the rostra; Augustus the other and gave her the highest posthumous honors (e.g. building the Gate of Octavia and Porticus Octaviae in her memory).Dio 54.35.5 Augustus also had the Roman senate declare his sister to be a goddess. Augustus declined some other honors decreed to her by the senate, for reasons unknown. She was one of the first Roman women to have coins minted bearing her image; only Antony's previous wife Fulvia pre-empted her.

This is as opposed to the regular triangle choke, which denotes a chokehold using the legs, albeit with a similar mechanism of strangulation against the opponent's own shoulder. An arm triangle choke where the practitioner is on the side of the opponent and presses a forearm into the opposite side of the neck of the opponent is known as a side choke, such as from the kata-gatame hold. Anaconda choke An anaconda choke is an arm triangle from the front headlock position. The performer threads his or her arm under the opponent's neck and through the armpit, and grasps the biceps of the opposing arm. The performer then attempts to pin the opponent onto the trapped shoulder so as to better interrupt the flow of blood, all the while applying pressure with the grasped biceps. The performer may accomplish this by rolling the opponent over the trapped shoulder, (known as a gator roll) and use the momentum to turn the opponent onto his or her trapped shoulder. The creator of this choke is unknown, although many sources point towards UFC veteran Milton Viera.https://jitsmagazine.com/submission-history-the-origins-of-the-head-and- arm-choke/ Viera himself has disputed this however and has gone on record as not claiming to be the originator of the Anaconda Choke, explaining that it is likely that multiple people came up with the same choke simultaneously.https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2012/06/ufc-147s-milton-vieira- doesnt-want-credit-for-anaconda-choke D'Arce choke/Brabo choke The D'Arce choke, or Brabo choke, is similar to the Anaconda choke. The difference is that the choking arm is threaded under the near arm, in front of the opponent's neck, and on top of the far arm. The choke gets its name from Joe D'Arce, a third-degree Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt under Renzo Gracie. D'arce is not the inventor of the choke however, he merely popularized its use in competition. Instead the Luta Livre practitioners point to its originator being Bjorn Dag Lagerstron who discovered the choke when attempting to perform an Anaconda Choke in practice, and getting his arms the wrong way round.https://jitsmagazine.com/submission-history-the-origins-of-the-head-and- arm-choke/ During a sparring session with Jason Miller, the choke surprised Miller, who gave it the name and pronunciation \\"Darce\\" rather than the proper \\"D-Arsee,\\" when D'Arce did not have a title for the technique.

It also served as a light bomber, transport, fighter and reconnaissance aircraft, and finally as an advanced trainer, with examples in service as late as 1940. 50 examples were also license-built in Poland at ZM E. Plage & T. Laśkiewicz, but were not a success due to poor quality. Development Based on Ansaldo's highly successful World War I Balilla and S.V.A scouts, the A.300 was a conventional single-engined two-bay open cockpit biplane of mixed metal and wood-and-fabric construction, powered usually by a water-cooled Fiat A.12bis V12 engine. Most variants had two fixed Vickers guns and one mobile gun mounted in the rear cockpit. It first flew in 1919. Early examples were two seaters, but the A.300/3 was a three-seater intended for reconnaissance use, of which around 90 were delivered. The most significant variant was the A.300/4, again mostly three-seaters, which started full production in 1923, just as Ansaldo was absorbed into FIAT. This became the standard multi-role aircraft in the newly formed Regia Aeronautica and served in Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, Corfu, Libya and Eritrea. Operational history The A.300 was one of the most numerous aircraft of its time, with the production run of the A.300/4 alone, at 700 units, exceeding the total production of any other type of the 1920s except the Breguet XIX and Potez 25. Despite this, and possibly because it was Italian rather than French or British, it remains one of the least documented contemporary types, certainly the most obscure produced in anything like these numbers.

The action of Cabral in this first military confrontation of the Argentine War of Independence gave him lasting fame and a prominent place among Argentine patriots. Biography Little is known about the life of Cabral. It is estimated that he was born in the town which now bears his name in the city of Saladas, Corrientes. He joined the second squadron of the newly formed Granaderos Cavalry Regiment in 1812. According to Pastor Obligado, Cabral's diligence and leadership led to corporal's stripes in December of the same year, and to promotion to sergeant the next year. Contrary to this assertion, Bartolomé Mitre (in his Historia de San Martín y de la Emancipación Americana) states that he was a private (\\"soldado raso\\") on the date of the battle. Scene of the Battle of San Lorenzo. Regardless of his rank, his action took place right after the battle started. The royalist forces (loyal to the Spanish Crown) had sailed up the Paraná River and landed on San Lorenzo, Santa Fe. Enemy fire overturned San Martín's horse, trapping the colonel beneath it, while the royalists drew close charging with bayonets. Cabral dismounted and assisted San Martín. The exact details have been embellished to the point that it is impossible to say how much risk he took. Some versions have Cabral placing himself between the bayonets and San Martín, which is doubtful. In any event, Cabral was critically wounded, and he died in the refectory of the neighboring San Carlos Convent, which was used as a field hospital. On his deathbed he said \\"I die happy, General; we have beaten the enemy.\\" According to Mitre, the rank of sergeant was given him posthumously due to meritorious actions in the battle. Argentine history has made him a national hero, and there are many monuments erected in his honor. The San Lorenzo march, by C. J. Benielli, is dedicated to him, and is taught in primary school. The famous Paraguayan composer and guitar virtuoso Augustin Barrios Mangoré composed a piece dedicated to the memory of him called Sargento Cabral. The Argentine Army's school for NCOs is named in his honour.

Its corporate headquarters is in Newport Beach, California, and it has stores in eight states, with two stores located in Illinois. The first Tastee-Freez was established in Keithsburg, Illinois. History Tastee-Freez was founded in 1950 in Joliet, Illinois, by Leo S. Moranz and Harry Axene (formerly of Dairy Queen).About Us at its official website Moranz invented a soft serve pump and freezer which enabled the product, and their Harlee Manufacturing CompanyHarry and Le(e)o produced the machines which franchisees would buy and use in their respective locations.. Originally stores focused on iced milk and other frozen dairy-based desserts. Expansion of the brand was rapid in the 1950s; in 1952, there were 315 locations, and by 1957 there were nearly 1,800 locations. In 1982, Tastee-Freez was sold to the Denovo Corporation of Utica, Michigan, which also owned the Stewart's Restaurants and root beer, Dog n Suds Root beer and drive-ins and B&K; Rootbeer drive ins, and Dairy Isle ice cream shops. In 1992, there were 340 locations. Newer locations have a larger fast food menu, far beyond the original offerings. Since 2003, the company has been owned by Galardi Group Franchise & Leasing, a franchisor based in California that also owns Wienerschnitzel hot dog restaurants. Wienerschnitzel has begun to incorporate Tastee-Freez soft serve products in their approximately 350 restaurants. Select Tastee-Freez soft serve products can also be found at The Original Hamburger Stand locations. There are fewer than fifty freestanding stores in the United States. Manufacturing Tastee Freez had its own manufacturing arm; \\"Freez King\\"; located on Homan Ave in Chicago IL. These machines were the single-barrel 2500 and double barrel 6500; whose most notable feature was the pressurized pump forks going up and down... and later the 2600 and 6600 high production models which remain as the most sought after commercial grade soft serve freezers on the market; for exceptional high volume and efficient production. Armin Fiedler was Chief Engineer for Tastee Freez and bought out the manufacturing arm Freez King in 1971; creating the \\"Freez King\\" division of International Freezer Corporation; which continued the Tastee Freez / Freez King tradition of unequaled engineering excellence. Omar Knedlick pumps in the TF/FK 2600/6600 models - which could only be produced for Tastee Freez alone; but Freez King under Tastee Freez also manufactured soft serve/shake/slush dispensing freezers for the commercial restaurant market; usually models 925/975 which are single/double barrel machines with options such as air/water cooled; pressurized or gravity fed product to the evaporator/ freezing cylinder; electrical options, etc. which could fit almost any distributor or restaurant owner's needs. Marketing In the 1950s, Tastee-Freez had the Tastee-Freez Twins mascots: Tee (female) and Eff (male). The mascots were clothed with ice cream (strawberry and chocolate respectively) on their heads. In popular culture In his 1982 hit song \\"Jack & Diane\\", John Mellencamp (recording at the time as \\"John Cougar\\") sings about Jack \\"suckin' on chili dog outside the Tastee-Freez\\".

More specifically, a monoidal functor between two monoidal categories consists of a functor between the categories, along with two coherence maps—a natural transformation and a morphism that preserve monoidal multiplication and unit, respectively. Mathematicians require these coherence maps to satisfy additional properties depending on how strictly they want to preserve the monoidal structure; each of these properties gives rise to a slightly different definition of monoidal functors * The coherence maps of lax monoidal functors satisfy no additional properties; they are not necessarily invertible. * The coherence maps of strong monoidal functors are invertible. * The coherence maps of strict monoidal functors are identity maps. Although we distinguish between these different definitions here, authors may call any one of these simply monoidal functors.  Definition  Let (\\\\mathcal C,\\\\otimes,I_{\\\\mathcal C}) and (\\\\mathcal D,\\\\bullet,I_{\\\\mathcal D}) be monoidal categories. A lax monoidal functor from \\\\mathcal C to \\\\mathcal D (which may also just be called a monoidal functor) consists of a functor F:\\\\mathcal C\\\\to\\\\mathcal D together with a natural transformation :\\\\phi_{A,B}:FA\\\\bullet FB\\\\to F(A\\\\otimes B) between \\\\mathcal{C}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{C}\\\\to\\\\mathcal{D} functors and a morphism :\\\\phi:I_{\\\\mathcal D}\\\\to FI_{\\\\mathcal C}, called the coherence maps or structure morphisms, which are such that for every three objects A, B and C of \\\\mathcal C the diagrams :332px, :225px and 225px commute in the category \\\\mathcal D. Above, the various natural transformations denoted using \\\\alpha, \\\\rho, \\\\lambda are parts of the monoidal structure on \\\\mathcal C and \\\\mathcal D.  Variants  * The dual of a monoidal functor is a comonoidal functor; it is a monoidal functor whose coherence maps are reversed. Comonoidal functors may also be called opmonoidal, colax monoidal, or oplax monoidal functors. * A strong monoidal functor is a monoidal functor whose coherence maps \\\\phi_{A,B}, \\\\phi are invertible. * A strict monoidal functor is a monoidal functor whose coherence maps are identities. * A braided monoidal functor is a monoidal functor between braided monoidal categories (with braidings denoted \\\\gamma) such that the following diagram commutes for every pair of objects A, B in \\\\mathcal C : :225px * A symmetric monoidal functor is a braided monoidal functor whose domain and codomain are symmetric monoidal categories.  Examples  * The underlying functor U\\\\colon(\\\\mathbf{Ab},\\\\otimes_\\\\mathbf{Z},\\\\mathbf{Z}) \\\\rightarrow (\\\\mathbf{Set},\\\\times,\\\\\\\\{\\\\ast\\\\\\\\}) from the category of abelian groups to the category of sets. In this case, the map \\\\phi_{A,B}\\\\colon U(A)\\\\times U(B)\\\\to U(A\\\\otimes B) sends (a, b) to a\\\\otimes b; the map \\\\phi\\\\colon \\\\\\\\{*\\\\\\\\}\\\\to\\\\mathbb Z sends \\\\ast to 1. * If R is a (commutative) ring, then the free functor \\\\mathsf{Set},\\\\to R\\\\mathsf{-mod} extends to a strongly monoidal functor (\\\\mathsf{Set},\\\\sqcup,\\\\emptyset)\\\\to (R\\\\mathsf{-mod},\\\\oplus,0) (and also (\\\\mathsf{Set},\\\\times,\\\\\\\\{\\\\ast\\\\\\\\})\\\\to (R\\\\mathsf{-mod},\\\\otimes,R) if R is commutative). * If R\\\\to S is a homomorphism of commutative rings, then the restriction functor (S\\\\mathsf{-mod},\\\\otimes_S,S)\\\\to(R\\\\mathsf{-mod},\\\\otimes_R,R) is monoidal and the induction functor (R\\\\mathsf{-mod},\\\\otimes_R,R)\\\\to(S\\\\mathsf{-mod},\\\\otimes_S,S) is strongly monoidal. * An important example of a symmetric monoidal functor is the mathematical model of topological quantum field theory, which has been recently developed. Let \\\\mathbf{Bord}_{\\\\langle n-1,n\\\\rangle} be the category of cobordisms of n-1,n-dimensional manifolds with tensor product given by disjoint union, and unit the empty manifold. A topological quantum field theory in dimension n is a symmetric monoidal functor F\\\\colon(\\\\mathbf{Bord}_{\\\\langle n-1,n\\\\rangle},\\\\sqcup,\\\\emptyset)\\\\rightarrow(\\\\mathbf{kVect},\\\\otimes_k,k). * The homology functor is monoidal as (Ch(R\\\\mathsf{-mod}),\\\\otimes,R[0]) \\\\to (grR\\\\mathsf{-mod},\\\\otimes,R[0]) via the map H_\\\\ast(C_1)\\\\otimes H_\\\\ast(C_2) \\\\to H_\\\\ast(C_1\\\\otimes C_2), [x_1]\\\\otimes[x_2] \\\\mapsto [x_1\\\\otimes x_2]. Properties * If (M,\\\\mu,\\\\epsilon) is a monoid object in C, then (FM,F\\\\mu\\\\circ\\\\phi_{M,M},F\\\\epsilon\\\\circ\\\\phi) is a monoid object in D.  Monoidal functors and adjunctions  Suppose that a functor F:\\\\mathcal C\\\\to\\\\mathcal D is left adjoint to a monoidal (G,n):(\\\\mathcal D,\\\\bullet,I_{\\\\mathcal D})\\\\to(\\\\mathcal C,\\\\otimes,I_{\\\\mathcal C}). Then F has a comonoidal structure (F,m) induced by (G,n), defined by :m_{A,B}=\\\\varepsilon_{FA\\\\bullet FB}\\\\circ Fn_{FA,FB}\\\\circ F(\\\\eta_A\\\\otimes \\\\eta_B):F(A\\\\otimes B)\\\\to FA\\\\bullet FB and :m=\\\\varepsilon_{I_{\\\\mathcal D}}\\\\circ Fn:FI_{\\\\mathcal C}\\\\to I_{\\\\mathcal D}. If the induced structure on F is strong, then the unit and counit of the adjunction are monoidal natural transformations, and the adjunction is said to be a monoidal adjunction; conversely, the left adjoint of a monoidal adjunction is always a strong monoidal functor. Similarly, a right adjoint to a comonoidal functor is monoidal, and the right adjoint of a comonoidal adjunction is a strong monoidal functor.

Powell was most active during the silent film era and is best known for directing Mary Pickford in Pollyanna (1920). Career Born in Peoria, Illinois, Powell was one of six children of Charles Henry and Anna Clara Powell (née von Schoenheider). His father was a publisher who founded the Peoria Evening Star. Powell was educated in Peoria and later attended Bradley Polytechnic Institute. After graduation, he worked at his father's newspaper as a typesetter and editor before becoming a reporter. In the early 1900s, Powell worked as a reporter for the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Express. In 1910, he quit his job as a reporter to work in the film industry. The following year, he became the assistant of director and screenwriter Wilbert Melville. In 1914, D. W. Griffith hired Powell to be the director of Mutual Film Corporation films. Two years later, Griffith hired Powell to direct features for Triangle-Fine Arts Film Corporation. While working for Triangle- Fine Arts, Powell directed Mary Pickford in the film adaptation of the 1913 novel Pollyanna. The film was a tremendous success and grossed $1.1 million upon its release. Powell also supported a young Rudolph Valentino while working on films such as A Society Sensation and All Night, who later recalled \\"He was the first to say, 'Stick to it and you'll make a name for yourself.'\\" Valentino later became one of the silent era's most cherished stars. Powell's final films in the late 1920s and 1930 were musical comedy shorts for Pathé Exchange. Death He died in Pasadena, California on July 2, 1944.

A portion of the shore of Goleta Bay is managed by the County of Santa Barbara as Goleta Beach County Park —GBCP. The beach itself is partly man-made as sand was spread onto an existing sandspit in 1945. The beach is a seasonal habitat for migrating shorebirds including the snowy plover, an endangered species. The beach is occasionally closed due to nourishment efforts. Elements Slough and wetlands Goleta Slough is a nearby tidal estuary that empties into the Pacific Ocean. The slough drains the Goleta Valley and watershed, and receives the water of all of the major creeks in the Goleta area including the southern face of the Santa Ynez Mountains. The slough ecosystem has been affected by numerous berms and tide gates that alter tidal circulation (Audubon, 2003). The Goleta Slough wetlands once covered approximately but the current size is about 430 acres (SAIC, 1996). Most of the habitat conversion occurred in the early 1940s when a small airport was expanded to accommodate an airfield for the Marine base located immediately south of the estuary on what is now the University of California at Santa Barbara. After the war that airfield became the Santa Barbara Municipal Airport. Groups such as the Sierra Club and Audubon Society have been especially concerned regarding the flora and fauna in the Goleta Slough and its surrounding uplands. The UCSB student-supported and student-led Coastal Fund has worked with the Goleta Slough Management Committee to conduct minor ecological restoration (such as the removal of non-native plants). The Goleta Slough Management Committee has been a vocal supporter of the California Coastal Conservancy’s plans for a major restoration project that would allow an experimental opening prior to a return to tidal circulation in at least one of the marshland basins. It was able to secure approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to go ahead with the experiment as the action may affect the Santa Barbara Airport. Park The park is a day-use park (open from 8:00 am to sunset) that features 27 picnic tables, four horseshoe pits, three restrooms, a volleyball court and other amenities. The park once featured a “Windamajig”, an active wind animated art piece sculpture. Unfortunately the art installation was damaged by strong winds in 2006 and removed. The park itself is large and of beach are included in the domain (Kisner, 1998). The Beachside Restaurant leases property from the Parks Department and its café and bait and tackle shop draw additional visitors. The pier, More’s Landing, was first built in 1874 and further modifications were done in the late 1920s by the federal Department of Forestry (Kisner, 1998). The park is popular with locals and tourists alike and receives about 1.5 million visitors per year, making it the most heavily used park in the Santa Barbara County Park system (SBCPD, 2003). The park provides 580 parking spaces, as many visitors arrive by car, via Highway 217. The western point The base of the point is described as “a rocky intertidal habitat, although species present there are more like those [found near] pier pilings” (Kisner, 1998). Freshwater seeps and some exposed pipes drain from the UCSB campus nearby the point. Most importantly, the rocky point and surrounding bluffs suffer from serious erosion most often associated with El Nino events. The shape of the bay focuses wave energy at the location. Because of the erosion, the edge of the bluffs above has become somewhat unstable and may be dangerous for those walking nearby. History The estuary mouth fluctuated along the beach while 40,000 years of coastal uplift raised the mesa to the east and west. Since the late 19th century, Santa Barbara residents have been modifying the Goleta Beach area. Cattle grazing in the watershed begun in 1846 and fires caused hillsides to erode and fill parts of the Goleta Slough with sediment. In the early 20th century, local landowners invited citizens to bring fill to the beach on which a state beach park was established. Meanwhile, in 1943 the federal government continued the filling of the estuary when it bulldozed the historic Mescalitan Island just inside the estuary to create an airbase for use during World War II (SBCPD, 2003). In the 1960s, further construction continued on the wetlands including a sewage treatment facility and California Highway 217, and the state park was turned over to Santa Barbara County. Erosion An ongoing problem concerning Goleta Beach is coastal erosion; sand and sediment is constantly being washed away and the beach is narrowing. In fact, in the last 14 years, the beach has been eroding at an average rate of -per-year. If no action is taken, the park, which consists of outdoor grills, horseshoe pits, a playground, public restrooms and shower, five parking lots and other county-maintained facilities (SBCPD, 2006), as well as the private Beachside Bar Café, is in danger of being lost. However, some proposed solutions designed to absorb wave energy and prevent erosion -- particularly the so-called “hard engineering” solutions -- may increase erosion elsewhere or alter the south central coast littoral cell. A number of plans have been proposed by different stakeholders and they generally fall under three broader philosophies. The first belief is that the park must be saved at all costs and supporters have argued for “hard engineering” coastal defense. A second group of stakeholders on the opposite extreme of the spectrum calls for managed retreat where existing utilities and structures are ripped out and nature is allowed to take its course. A third option, a moderate compromise suggests that the current ‘soft’ beach nourishment strategy is worth continuing. Coastal defense The structural proposals consist of numerous strategies. One possible structure is a breakwater. Breakwaters are placed a few hundred feet offshore and create a harbor. Unfortunately, a breakwater would likely adversely affect littoral drift and the creation of a Goleta Bay harbor is probably too extreme. Another strategy is the installation of groynes (or groins), wood or concrete ‘fences’ that stretch out into the ocean, perpendicular to the beach. Groynes cause sediment to build up on one side but have the unhelpful consequence of preventing sediment to accumulate on the other side. Another structure proposed is a seawall. A seawall is a concrete wall placed against the base of bluffs or sea cliffs that runs parallel to the ocean. While a sea wall may appear to be stopping erosion, a seawall can only diffuse wave energy which means that the areas on either side of the wall are likely to experience accelerated erosion. Again, this is not desired as the UCSB mesa might be adversely affected. A fourth type of structure is a revetment. A revetment is similar to a seawall but usually consists of boulders piled at the base of cliffs. While it is less likely to accelerate erosion to either side, the area in front of a revetment may suffer. Sediment that would normally have been deposited on the beach instead bounces off the rocks and is dispersed elsewhere. Managed retreat Some organizations of users, such as the Surfrider Foundation, have called for managed retreat. Scientists and coastal engineers know that hard structures cause greater erosion of the beach sand. This option would protect coastal resources while preserving park amenities by reconfiguring them. There is no evidence that the current protection measures currently in place have caused the erosion of beach sand at either Goleta Beach or any down coast beaches. The California Coastal Commission permits armoring in order to protect public access and recreational uses. This beach is visited by over 1.4 million visitors annually. Beach nourishment A third strategy is that of beach nourishment (a ‘soft’ approach). Nourishment consists of depositing sand on top of the beach in order to expand its width. This approach is not extremely expensive and is already being done at Goleta Beach. In addition to the direct transporting of sand to the beach, it would also be helpful if sediment built up in upriver basins (behind dams) be removed and placed slightly downstream to be naturally washed down to the ocean. The mouth of the slough should be kept open by periodic dredging as blockage causes eutrophication. The Northern Gold Coast Beach Protection Strategy is an example of a successful execution of this technique. Between 1992 and 1999, the Gold Coast City Council worked with experts on a proposed plan to stop beach erosion. Options originally considered included groynes, breakwaters, and others but the City Council finally chose to dredge sediment from the nearby Gold Coast Broadwater, pump it through large pipes, and deposit it along five kilometers of coast. In addition, they planned a near- shore artificial reef to protect the project. Between 1999 and 2000, the plan was carried out with 1.1 million cubic meters of sediment being transported from the Broadwater to the beach (Jackson, 2004). Further dredging of nearby areas provided sand that was used to fill large geotextile sandbags that were dropped nearshore to create the reef. Since then, the beach has been monitored with coastal imaging technology and has fared well. Due to the significant differences in the coastline and tidal conditions, this alternative may not be applicable at Goleta Beach. The area in dispute is currently fully armored with large boulders to the west of the Beachside Cafe and has been so for a number of years. Another option on this project is to request the Coastal Commission to permit the existing rocks. There is no scientific evidence that the current protective measures have resulted in loss of sand to down coast beaches.

At one point, Peter eats a piece of his guitar, and him and Lois lie on the sofa naked in front of Brian and Stewie. At the show, they initially appear to wow the entire crowd with their performance, but, later, they realize that they lost. Chris explains that they were completely high and they just shouted \\"Aah!\\" to the crowd while plodding chords on the guitar and he then preaches the dangers of marijuana to Lois and Peter. Production It was originally intended for Mayor West to beat Meg up when she is applying for a job within his office, but the scene was never used. The clay cars sketch was not animated by the regular show producers, rather it was drawn by Eileen Colehep, a woman who attended college with show producer Seth MacFarlane. The voice of Bruce the performance artist was performed by Mike Henry, and was originally scheduled to last longer, but it was reduced for unknown reasons. The concept behind the storyline of Peter and Lois performing in pubs when they were younger relates to MacFarlane's father, who used to do stage performances in bars. When he was performing, the woman who was to be MacFarlane's mother, came into the bar and tracked his father down, asking for guitar lessons once she had found him. The song which Peter and Lois were singing when remembering their performances they hosted in their earlier years was created by Alec Sulkin and Patrick Megan, producers of Family Guy. Alex Borstein, voice actor of Lois Griffin had originally wanted Meg to be wearing a business outfit in the episode during her employment by Mayor West, but it was not used. Alex Borstein wrote the episode. The episode marks the first time in the series that Stewie has expressed an attraction for Brian. The name of Peter and Lois' band was originally intended to be \\"Mouthful of Peter,\\" but broadcasting standards insisted that the show producers change the name to \\"Handful of Peter.\\" In response to this, MacFarlane comments that \\"a handjob is more acceptable than a blowjob.\\" When performing for the Quahog Talent Competition, one of the lyrics to Peter and Lois' song was scheduled to be \\"God would do her from behind, even do it a second time,\\" but it was never used. Sound mixer Patrick Clark organized the format of the credits, which were different from the regular set. Peter singing \\"Ding Fries are Done\\" was shortened for the televised version of the episode, with an extended version on the DVD. Cleveland sticking his middle finger up to Brian after he fails to stop in his taxi was allowed on the televised version of the episode. This was permitted because MacFarlane rang the show's broadcasting standards and asked for their explicit permission, explaining that it was very distant, and they allowed it. After smoking marijuana, Peter and Lois are shown lying on top of each other on the sofa; in the television version, they are wearing underwear, but are completely naked on the DVD, Adult Swim, and TBS versions. Similarly, Lois' comment during the scene, \\"Brian, he's knocking on the back door, what should I do? Should I let him in?\\" was censored from Fox airings, as it is a reference to anal sex, but remains intact on Adult Swim and TBS airings. In addition to the regular cast, voice actors H. Jon Benjamin and Frank Welker, and actress Kate Jackson guest starred in the episode. Recurring voice actors Lori Alan, Ralph Garman, and Mike Henry, writers Chris Sheridan, Danny Smith, and John Viener, and actor Adam West, who portrays an exaggerated version of himself, also made minor appearances. Cultural references The episode takes its title from a scene when an anonymous informant (later revealed to be Kermit the Frog) secretly meets Brian in an underground parking lot. Brian calls the informant \\"Deep Throat,\\" in a reference to the anonymous informant Deep Throat. The meeting itself is a reference to the meeting with Deep Throat or to the 1976 film All the President's Men. The part-time job Peter had wherein he sings a song \\"Ding Fries are Done,\\" was based on a song that was popularized by Doctor Demento in the 1990s concerning Burger King, and is a parody of the popular Christmas song \\"Carol of the Bells\\".Carol of the Bells , Sean Spurr, Carols.co.http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2011/12/ding_fries_are_done_funny_chri.html The Noid attempting to ruin Mayor West's pizza is a reference to the Noid from former Domino's Pizza television advertisements. The scene where Cleveland runs off as a black panther when he notices Meg and Brian looking at him as he destroys Brian's cab with a crowbar is a reference to Michael Jackson's \\"Black or White\\" second ending known as the Black or White Panther Dance. Stewie references his cousin, Stewie Cruise, showing him jumping up and down on Oprah's couch while shouting \\"I'm in love with Katie Holmes! I'm not gay!\\" When Lois mentions to Peter that it would be fun to be in the community talent show, Stewie says \\"You know what else is fun? Watching Mr. Belvedere without people talking so loudly!\\". He then proceeds to sing the theme song loudly. When Peter is being driven around by Brian, he refers to him as Bitterman, a reference to the chauffeur in the 1981 film Arthur. The song Mayor West and Meg are listening to in the hotel together is the theme song to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from the 1987 series. In the DVD version of the episode, Stewie and Brian bump into Scooby-Doo and the gang from Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?. Fred Jones and Stewie argue about who got to City Hall first, but then Stewie sends them off by humming a familiar tune.

Life  After his first work, the short documentary film Ein vergnügter Wintertag im Berliner Grunewald, made for the producer Oskar Messter in 1909, Wilhelm worked for many other Berlin production companies. For example, in the years before World War I, he filmed for Deutsche Mutoskop- und Biograph GmbH in Lankwitz and BB-Film-Fabrikation Bolten-Baeckers in Steglitz a series of comedies starring the silent film star Leo Peukert. The two comedies he shot in 1913 and 1914 with Ernst Lubitsch - Die Firma heiratet and Der Stolz der Firma - were very successful. As late as 1919 a critic could write: \\"Die Firma heiratet and Meyer aus Berlin are still our best films.\\"Bobby E. Lüthge im Film-Kurier, Nr. 15, 22 June 1919 In 1915, with his company Cewe-Films, and in 1920/21, with Carl-Wilhelm-Film GmbH, he also operated as his own producer. In 1917 and 1918 he made a number of films in Hungarian. Carl Wilhelm remained a sought-after director until the end of the silent film period. He then ceased to work almost entirely - he is last heard of as a production assistant in 1935. He left Germany for Vienna after the coming to power of the Nazi party in 1933 and, already ill, joined his son Wolfgang in London where he died in 1936.

D. IV. 73 The authorship is uncertain, and the work in question is said by some to be only a copy of a chronicle written by Alfred of Beverley in the twelfth century, while others claim it is almost entirely based on that of Geoffrey of Monmouth. It is a valueless compilation, describing English history from the invasion of the Saxons to the year 1129. Because the manuscript bears the name Godridus de Malmesburg, it was originally believed that it was written by Godfrey of Malmesburg, a native of Jumièges, who became Abbot of Malmesbury in 1081. Godfrey was regarded as a man of literary tastes because he founded the abbey's library, but his authorship of the manuscript was disproved, apart from its identity with Alfred of Beverley, by the fact that his death took place in or before 1107, when Edulf became the abbot. Indeed, it is likely that the signature merely indicates ownership.

Ethnic Mennonite remigrants from Latin America brought the original Kleine Gemeinde back to Canada and the US.  Biography  Reimer was born in 1770 to Heinrich Reimer and Agatha Epp (b. 1745) in the Vistula delta Mennonite settlement of Petershagen, Prussia, located about 35 km east of the city of Danzig (Gdańsk). Heinrich died while his son was still young; his mother later remarried Abraham Janzen (1747–1822), a wealthy farmer. During his childhood, Reimer received no formal education. At age twenty, Klaas was baptized and accepted into the Danzig Mennonite fellowship. In 1792, he moved to Neuenhuben, a village just east of Danzig, where he joined a newly established Werder Gemeinde, a Mennonite splinter church. Six years later, at the age of 28, Klaas married Maria Epp (1760–1806), who was ten years his senior. Maria was the daughter of Peter Epp, a highly influential Mennonite church leader. Maria died in 1806 at age 46. Klaas and Maria had only one child, Aganetha, who was born in 1801, who later dies an early death in Russia. About three months after his first wife died, Reimer remarried to Helena von Riesen (1787–1846), together they had ten children, of which three sons and two daughters survived to adulthood. Reimer was ordained into the ministry in 1801. In 1804, he led a group of about 30 adults in an immigration to south Russia, settling in the newly opened Mennonite colony, Molotschna, in the spring of 1805. Here, Reimer was frequently in conflict with the elder of the colony, Jacob Enns, who attempted to have the local authorities silence him. Reimer appealed to Chortitza elder Johann Wiebe, only to be threatened by Wiebe with banishment if he did not stop his activities.Smith p. 275. The struggle finally came to a head in 1812, when Reimer and eighteen of his followers began to hold their own church meetings in private homes. Seen as a secession by the Molotschna leadership, Reimer was threatened with dire punishment, including exile to Siberia. Reimer was joined by another minister, Cornelius Janzen, and about 20 members, who together recognized themselves as a separate church body in 1814. Similar groups in several villages seceded at the same time. These later united to form the Kleine Gemeinde, which was recognized by the Russian government and granted the same rights and privileges of the main Mennonite group. The hostility against Reimer and his fellowship toned down somewhat a few years later, when Elder Enns died. Reimer's challenges were not limited to the main Mennonite body from which they separated. He also faced difficult challenges within his own fellowship. A crisis that has been called the false- humility movement almost destroyed the Kleine Gemeinde in 1828–29 and for a time threatened his leadership. A faction within the church apparently dwelt on guilt and fear and attempted a daily routine of extreme asceticism and self-inflicted punishment. When Reimer strongly admonished this faction in a sermon, many in the congregation walked out in disapproval. At a special meeting, his leadership was challenged and barely survived a vote of confidence. Over time, the movement subsided and Reimer regained control of the fellowship. On December 18, 1837 Klaas Reimer died in Lindenau, Molotschna, South Russia at the age of 67 years.  Legacy  Reimer remains a controversial figure in Mennonite history. One of Klaas' prominent critics was Mennonite historian Peter M. Friesen (1849–1914) who wrote that Klaas was \\"devoid of any joyous knowledge of God's grace\\" and that his movement \\"was too narrow-minded, too frightened, too isolationist and opposed to education, it never made a profound impact.\\"Friesen, p. 93. Delbert Plett, an outspoken advocate of Klaas, writes that \\"Klaas Reimer was a conservative intellectual whose voice speaks with singular clarity over the centuries.\\"Plett (1999), p. 70. Klaas' autobiography, penned in 1836, has been translated into English and published in the book Leaders by Mennonite historian Delbert Plett.

Background Her career began in 1990, when her first album, Goldfish Don't Talk Back, was released to critical acclaim. Her punk-tinged folk music led to a major label deal with the Chaos label at Columbia Records, and in 1992, Kahn released Epiphany in Brooklyn. This album, which featured Kahn's darkly humorous stories of love, confusion, and tragedy in urban America, was heralded by critics and fans throughout the United States. People magazine compared her to the Violent Femmes and Patti Smith.{1993 People Magazine]Creem Magazine dubbed her \\"the high priestess of the apocalyptic relationship.\\" Kahn was selected to open up for Bob Dylan and The Kinks, toured the US and Europe, and seemed on the brink of stardom. Chaos Records folded just two weeks before Kahn's awaited third release, the rock-tinged Destination Anywhere. Her next two albums, both featuring more electric guitar, were released under the independent label Shanachie Records, and she continued to tour Europe (particularly Germany), the east coast and midwest through the late 1990s. Kahn performed at Lilith Fair in 1998 and 1999. In 1999, she founded Womanrock.com, Inc, an online magazine and music store designed to unite and empower female artists and give tips on how to navigate through the record industry. That same year, she self-released her fifth album, the acoustic and spoken word Hunger, which was a tribute to her late friend Jeff Buckley. In 2010 Kahn released her sixth full-length album \\"Seven Laws of Gravity\\" featuring New York studio musicians Jack Petruzelli, Adrian Harpham and Craig Dreyer and produced by Craig Dreyer. Review by Soundtrack3 praised the album saying, \\"Kahn’s music is less punk-folk now, and more alternative-country, but the lyrics remain poetic and beautiful. The hooks in this album dig their heels in and don’t let go. It’s great to have Kahn making music again.\\" In 2017 Kahn released \\"Rocket to the Moon\\", a children's album, featuring the production work of multi-instrumentalist and engineer Matt Molchany.

It is situated in the Ruhr area, the fourth largest urban area in Europe. The university is highly ranked in terms of its research performance in the areas of physics, electrical engineering, chemistry and economics. Uni-News: Handelsblatt Ranking History The University of Dortmund (German: Universität Dortmund) was founded in 1968, during the decline of the coal and steel industry in the Ruhr region. Its establishment was seen as an important move in the economic change (Strukturwandel) from heavy industry to technology. The university's main areas of research are the natural sciences, engineering, pedagogy/teacher training in a wide spectrum of subjects, special education, and journalism. The University of Dortmund was originally designed to be a technical university, but in 1980, it merged with the adjacent Pädagogische Hochschule Ruhr that housed mostly humanities. In 2006, The University of Dortmund hosted the 11th Federation of International Robot- soccer Association (FIRA) RoboWorld Cup. The university's robot soccer team, the Dortmund Droids, became vice world champion in the RoboWorld Cup 2002 and finished third in 2003. On November 1, 2007, The University Dortmund has been renamed as TU Dortmund University. The University is part of the cooperation program \\"University Alliance Ruhr\\", together with the Ruhr University Bochum and the University of Duisburg-Essen.

It was directed by Val Guest and released in 1961, and is one of the classic apocalyptic films of its era.Variety film review; 22 November 1961Harrison's Reports review; 13 January 1962, page 2.Dirks, Tim.filmsite.org The film opened at the Odeon Marble Arch in London on 23 November 1961. The film, which was partly made on location in London and Brighton, used matte painting to create images of abandoned cities and desolate landscapes. The production also featured the real Daily Express, even using the paper's own headquarters, the Daily Express Building in Fleet Street, London, and featuring Arthur Christiansen as the Express editor, a job he had held in real life. Plot A lone man walks through the sweltering streets of a deserted London. The film then goes back several months. Peter Stenning (Judd) had been an up-and-coming journalist with the Daily Express, but since a divorce threw his life into disarray, he has been drinking too much (one of his lines is \\"Alcoholics of the press, unite!\\") and his work has suffered. His editor (Christiansen) has begun giving him lousy assignments. Stenning's only friend, Bill Maguire (McKern), is a veteran Fleet Street reporter who offers him encouragement and occasionally covers for him by writing his copy. Meanwhile, after the Soviet Union and the United States accidentally detonate simultaneous nuclear bomb tests, strange meteorological events begin to affect the globe. Stenning is sent to the British Met Office to obtain temperature data, and while there he meets Jeanie (Munro), a young typist who is temporarily acting as telephonist. They \\"meet cute\\", trading insults; later, they fall in love. Stenning then discovers that the weapons tests have had a massive effect on Earth. He asks Jeannie to help him get any relevant information. It becomes apparent that Earth's nutation has been altered by 11 degrees, affecting the climatic zones and changing the pole and the equator. The increasing heat has caused water to evaporate and mists to cover Britain, and a solar eclipse occurs days ahead of schedule. Later, characters realise that the orbit of the Earth has been disrupted and the planet is spiralling in towards the Sun. The government imposes a state of emergency and starts rationing water and supplies. People start evacuating the cities. Scientists conclude that the only way to bring Earth back into a safe orbit is to detonate a series of nuclear bombs in western Siberia. Stenning, Maguire, and Jeanie gather at a bar to listen to the radio broadcast of the event. The bombs are detonated, and the shock wave causes dust to fall from the bar's ceiling. At the newspaper print room, two versions of the front page have been prepared: one reads \\"World Saved\\", the other \\"World Doomed\\". The film ends without revealing which one will be published. Cast * Edward Judd as Peter Stenning * Leo McKern as Bill Maguire * Janet Munro as Jeannie Craig * Michael Goodliffe as 'Jacko', the night editor * Bernard Braden as the news editor * Reginald Beckwith as Harry * Gene Anderson as May * Renée Asherson as Angela * Arthur Christiansen as Jeff Jefferson, the editor * Austin Trevor as Sir John Kelly * Edward Underdown as Dick Sanderson * Ian Ellis as Michael Stenning * Peter Butterworth as second sub-editor (uncredited) * Michael Caine as a police constable (uncredited) Arthur Christiansen, a former editor of the Daily Express, played himself as the editor of the newspaper. Three years before Zulu, a then-unknown Michael Caine played an uncredited police officer diverting traffic. Production Val Guest said there was a lack of enthusiasm to make the film and he only managed to persuade British Lion to finance it by putting up his profits from Expresso Bongo as collateral. All the finance was British. In the film's orange-infused opening sequence, Edward Judd walks through a devastated and deserted London. The film was made in black and white but in some original prints, the opening and closing sequences are tinted orange-yellow to suggest the heat of the sun. It was shot with 35 mm anamorphic lenses using the French Dyaliscope process. Title card from The Day the Earth Caught Fire, showing a dried-up riverbed of the River Thames Critic Doug Cummings said, about the look of the film, \\"Guest also manages some visual flair. The film was shot in anamorphic widescreen, and the extended frame is always perfectly balanced with groups of people, city vistas, or detailed settings, whether bustling newsrooms, congested streets, or humid apartments. Although the film's special effects aren't particularly noteworthy, matte paintings and the incorporation of real London locations work to good atmospheric advantage (heavy rains buffet the windows; thick, unexpected fog wafts through the city; a raging hurricane crashes into the British coast). Guest also cleverly incorporates stock footage to depict floods and meteorological disasters worldwide. The visual style of the film is straightforward and classical, but each scene is rendered with a great degree of realism and sense of place.\\" Reviewer Paul A. Green wrote, \\"Guest and his editor Bill Lenny worked with archive footage. There's a quick shot of a fire- engine from The Quatermass Experiment - but otherwise you can't see the joins.\\" In his commentary track for the 2001 Anchor Bay DVD release, director Val Guest stated that the sound of church bells heard at the very end of the American version had been added by distributor Universal, in order to suggest that the emergency detonation had succeeded and that the Earth had been saved. Guest speculated that the bells motif had been inspired by the film The War of the Worlds (1953), which ends with the joyous ringing of church bells after the emergency (and a nuclear explosion). But Guest maintained that his intention was to always have an ambiguous ending. In August 2014 a restored version was screened at the British Museum's summer open air cinema. }} Certification The film was rated \\"X\\" (minimum age 16 admitted) by the British Board of Film Censors on its initial release. A 2001 DVD release from Network Releasing was given a BBFC DVD/Blu-ray certificate of \\"15\\" (years and over). On the 2014 BFI release, the rating was reduced to \\"12\\". Locations The film was shot in London and South East England. Principal photography included Fleet Street (the Daily Express building), Battersea Park, the HM Treasury Building in Westminster and on Palace Pier, Brighton.  Themes  Essayist Paul A. Green discusses many of the themes in the film in his review: *News media - \\"We see a media landscape that is largely defined through the press and its heavy-duty Gutenberg technology, and a political landscape that is defined through the Cold War... The bustling newsroom with its exhorting wall poster slogans (Go for IMPACT!) is a nexus of conflicting information and misinformation, conjecture and rumour as the hacks try to get an angle on freak weather conditions in the silly season.\\" Green adds about a late scene, \\"Today the sequence reads like an elegy for the old Fleet Street culture of \\"The Print\\" which gave life-time employment to thousands of Cockneys, until Murdoch introduced computerised newsrooms, smashed the print unions and moved operations to Docklands, eventually dragging the rest of Fleet Street with him.\\" *Nuclear weapons testing - \\"Then the premise of the film - that nuclear tests alter the earth's orbit, disrupt the climate and send the planet spiralling towards the sun - makes a deeper impact... Global destruction through nuclear war is becoming an existential reality... Nuclear holocaust anxieties in the movies were not new, of course. But these fears were usually externalised as monster mutation narratives...\\" *Escapism - \\"Everyone's keeping busy except boozy Stenning, who clearly resents being tasked to write a lightweight piece about sun-spots, when he used to be the paper's hotshot columnist with serious ambitions as a writer. He'd rather be in Harry's Bar, a cosy all-day drinking club modelled on Fleet Street's El Vino's.\\" *Social class - \\"Stenning's discontent is not explicitly political, in any specific ideological sense... But there's the same restlessness about the restrictions of class. Stenning voices a distrust of traditional upper- crust Anglo-Saxon attitudes that parallels the increasingly awkward questions the narrative raises about the inertia of the British Establishment, as well as the mood of a Britain on the edge of social change. \\"You ought to see the way they're bringing him up, Bill. It'll be the right prep school next. And then the right boarding school. And by the time they finish with him, he'll be a right bowler-hatted, who's-for-tennis, toffee-nosed gent, but he won't be MY son....\\" *Gender politics - \\"This encounter with Jeanie signals the beginning of Stenning's slow transformation. It also exemplifies the transformation of gender politics in UK bureaucracy since 1961. Today a bright woman like Jeannie would probably be running the whole department rather than servicing a duplicating machine, which is where Stenning discovers her. \\"I'm not women!\\" she informs Stenning, when he makes one of his bar-room generalisations.\\" *End of the world - \\"Stenning manages to photograph the flaring black disc of the sun - a superb piece of metonymy for the looming threat of extinction... As I.Q Hunter points out in British Science Fiction Cinema the film progresses through a reprise of the city's collective memories and myths of World War Two - the Blitz, fire-storms, black-out, the miseries of rationing, evacuation of children, black marketeering and gangsterism. It raises the issue of whether post-war Britain could maintain the Dunkirk spirit in the face of a new threat. There's a hint, voiced by Maguire earlier, that \\"we've gone soft\\" and that under these new and even more extreme circumstances, social cohesion might unravel and give way to hysteria.\\" Reception Box Office The film made a profit of £22,500. Critical response The film holds an 86% \\"Certified Fresh\\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes. Critic Doug Cummings called it \\"an unusually literate and thematically nuanced genre film,\\" adding, \\"The disaster genre is not generally known for its insights into characters or its clever dialogue, but The Day the Earth Caught Fire is an admirable exception. Its attention to the inner and outer lives of its protagonists makes its physical doom an externalized metaphor for Stenning's personal life, off-kilter and spinning out of control, both fates equally weighted between hope and despair.\\" Reviewer Dennis Schwartz wrote, \\"An intelligent low-budget sci-fi doomsday pic that gives us an authentic Fleet Street look at an old-fashioned newspaper office back in the day and a suspenseful scenario of the world tinkering on destruction as seen through the eyes of the newspaper. Val Guest ... efficiently directs by making good use of the atmospheric effects such as the extreme heat and mist on Londoners, which gives this fascinating story an eerie feel. Guest and Wolf Mankowitz write a taut screenplay, with an observant look at the London scene.\\" Paul Green, cited above, wrote in a 2005 commentary, \\"London is on the cusp of the sixties, where protest and youth cultures are breaking through, but social and sexual mores are still semi-formalised and girls work in typing pools... In a contemporary context of global warming, asymmetric warfare, nuclear proliferation and dwindling resources, the film's underlying optimism seems touching.\\" Awards Val Guest and Wolf Mankowitz received the 1962 BAFTA for Best Film Screenplay for The Day the Earth Caught Fire.

At this stage the possibility of air-to-air combat was considered highly speculative, and the speed of these aircraft relative to their contemporaries was seen as an advantage in gaining immunity from ground fire and in the ability to deliver timely reconnaissance reports. Almost from the beginning of the war, various experiments were carried out in the fitting of armament to scouts to enable them to engage in air-to-air combat – by early 1916 several types of scout could fire a machine gun forwards, in the line of flight, thus becoming the first effective single-seat fighter aircraft – in effect, an entirely new class of aircraft. In French and German usage these types were termed \\"hunters\\" (chasseur, Jäger), but in the Royal Flying Corps and early Royal Air Force parlance \\"scout\\" remained the usual term for a single-seat fighter into the early 1920s. The term \\"fighter\\", or \\"fighting aircraft\\" was already current, but in this period referred specifically to a two-seater fighter such as the Sopwith 1½ Strutter or the Bristol Fighter. This usage \\"scout\\" (or sometimes \\"fighting scout\\") for \\"single-seat fighter\\" can be found in many contemporary accounts, including fictional depictions of First World War air combat such as the Biggles books. These often refer to French or German \\"scouts\\" as well as British ones. The usage also survives in some much later non-fictional writing on First World War aviation.

Titles and offices He was made Marquess of Ormond at his baptism. He was created Earl of Ross in 1481 after that title was forfeited to the crown by John, Lord of the Isles. Of his father's three sons, James of Ross was the favourite. James III even tried to marry him to Edward IV's daughter, Catherine of York. This increasing preference shown to James of Ross was a factor in the rebellion of his elder brother (the future James IV) against their father; and later, as king, James IV was suspicious of his brother's loyalty. Nonetheless, when the elder James succeeded to the crown in 1488, he raised James of Ross's title to Duke of Ross, aged 12. Around May 1497, his brother the King nominated James of Ross (then 21 years old) to be Archbishop of St Andrews. King James thought that would keep James of Ross from rebelling against him. Also, James of Ross was a minor, and so the revenues of the archbishopric would be controlled by King James.Norman Macdougall James IV (Edinburgh, 1989) James of Ross also became Lord Chancellor of Scotland in 1502. Name He was one of three brothers, his two brothers being King James IV of Scotland and John Stewart, Earl of Mar. It may seem surprising that there were two brothers both called James. It has been suggested that at the time the younger was born the older was seriously ill and seemed unlikely to survive, but it is unclear whether there is any evidence for this hypothesis.

Bill is a 2D action video game published by Imagine Software in 1984. It was released for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, TRS-80 Color Computer, Dragon 32/64 and BBC Micro. Gameplay The player controls the eponymous B.C. Bill, a caveman, and must gather wives and enough food to feed his growing family, while avoiding predatory dinosaurs. Bill is armed with a club, which he uses to stun cavewomen and to kill a variety of roaming creatures. Smaller creatures may be dragged back to the cave as food, whereas larger dinosaurs will eat potential wives and food, and will kill Bill on contact. Bill can die from a broken heart if too many wives leave the cave, and from starvation if he is unable to provide enough food to feed himself and his family. The game features changing seasons, which affect the number and variety of food animals and also act as an internal gameplay timer: in spring, every wife who has food will produce a child, while in autumn any wife with no food will die and any child with no food will leave home. Development B.C. Bill was developed in the UK by Creative Technology Group, and was published in the UK by Imagine Software in 1984 and in Spain by ABC Soft. Versions of the game were developed and released for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, TRS-80, Dragon 32/64 and BBC Micro home computers. The game was the last title published by Imagine, which was wound up in July 1984 due to unpaid debts of £10,000. Prior to the company's collapse Beau Jolly acquired the rights to market Imagine's games, so after the company's demise Beau Jolly took over marketing and distribution of B.C. Bill. Reception The game received generally favourable reviews at release, with reviewers variously praising its graphics, sound and playability. Looking back at the game in 2010, however, Retro Gamer described it as \\"an exceedingly poor game\\". While reviewers praised the gameplay, the game has been criticised by both contemporary and modern reviewers for its sexist subject matter, as a core element of gameplay involves the protagonist clubbing women and then dragging them by the hair into his cave to become his wife. Your Sinclair's (then Your Spectrum) Ron Smith speculated that this might have been deliberate on the part of Imagine, and Imagine's Tim Best appeared to confirm this, saying that he expected the \\"Greenham Common women\\" to take up residence outside Imagine's Liverpool offices.

She began her musical career as a young schoolgirl, singing in village halls throughout the remote communities of west Cornwall. Wootton became active on the folk scene in the early 60s, helping to keep the Cornish folk song tradition alive for many years. Her early albums were recorded on Cornwall's Sentinel label, often with John the Fish (John Langford), with whom she sang for six years. Wootton later sang with Robert Bartlett and with guitarists Pete Berryman, Mike Silver, Al Fenn, David Penhale and Chris Newman. Many of her songs were composed by Richard Gendall. Her repertoire over the years covered folk, rock, blues, jazz and even hymns, but she is best remembered for her Cornish \\"standards\\" such as Lamorna, The White Rose, Camborne Hill, The Stratton Carol and the ballads Mordonnow, Tamar, Silver Net and Lyonesse. She was equally at home when singing in Cornish, Breton or English and was as famous in Brittany, which she visited regularly, as she was in her native Cornwall. She opened her own folk club, the Pipers Folk Club, at St Buryan, Cornwall and appeared in the first ever Lorient Interceltic Festival in Brittany. Wootton was a member of the Gorseth Kernow, where she was known by her Bardic name of Gwylan Gwavas (Seagull of Newlyn). In her later years, she became well known in Cornwall as a presenter for BBC Radio Cornwall where she hosted the popular weekly request show Sunday Best, until her death in 1994. She was also the Honorary President of Radio Beacon, the hospital radio service for St Lawrences Hospital in Bodmin. Wootton died in March 1994, aged 66, after a long illness, at her home in Penzance. Legacy In 1994, Wootton's daughter, Sue Luscombe, published a book of her lyrics, comic-verses, ballads and stories entitled, Pantomime Stew – An Anthology of Poetry, Doggerel and Nonsense by Brenda Wootton.Luscombe, S. (ed.) (1994), Pantomime Stew – An Anthology of Poetry, Doggerel and Nonsense by Brenda Wootton, Hayle, 1994. Wootton in concert at Quimperlé, Brittany, in 1980 In 2010, it was announced that a previously unreleased audio tape had been discovered of a concert given by Wootton in June 1984 at the 'Bobino' theatre/music hall in Paris with Camborne Town Band and local musicians Ray Roberts, Dave Freeman and the renowned British acoustic guitarist Chris Newman. Analogue master tapes of the concert were discovered by John Knight, her recording engineer, in his studio in Cornwall, and were then digitally mastered and edited for the new album. Knight commented at the time \\"Brenda wanted to have a personal record of the concert. She never released a live album. I don't think it was intended for release. But now I think we have the potential there\\" adding \\"Ideally we would love to release it on cd with some of the stories from the tour.\\" Subsequently, a new CD, All of Me, was released. The recording is unique as all nineteen tracks were previously unheard and represents a fitting tribute to Wootton, performing at what was considered to be the peak of her international career. A sixteen-page souvenir booklet, researched by Gloria Knight, is included featuring unpublished photographs, many from Wootton's own private collection.

It was mentioned by European explorers, who described it as very indecent. It is not quite clear how similar the gestures at that time were with the now immensely popular tāmūrē. In both dances the performers form groups of pairs of a boy and a girl, dancing more or less in sexually oriented movements. History A upaupa around 1900 After having arrived on Tahiti in 1797, the LMS missionaries quickly intimidated the local rulers of the island and fixed themselves in a position of power. Although this enabled them to abolish such habits as infanticide, cannibalism and tribal wars, it also enabled them to introduce the idea of sin, which was unknown on Tahiti until then. The joy of dancing, so dear to the Polynesian heart, was one of the first to be axed. The famous Pōmare code of 1819 declared the upaupa (and tattooing in the same line) to be bad and immoral habitudes, severely to be opposed. The Leewards followed suit soon after. But dancing continued in secret. In the code of 1842 many restrictions were relaxed, but the upaupa (the general term for dancing then) remained on the black list. In the same year the French proclaimed the protectorate. Being Catholic with some broader views on life than the Protestants, and considering that 'if you cannot beat them, join them', they proclaimed in the official bulletin of 1849 that the upaupa was still forbidden, except on public feastdays, but then still without the indecent gestures. The act of 1853, repeated in 1876 was more restrictive. In the hope that the Tahitians would spend their time on more pious occupations than dancing and drinking, a system of licences was introduced. A license could only be obtained by a chef and only on Saturday evenings. Costume in 1909 Despite all these restrictions, dancing went on, less secret or more secret depending on the law at that moment. Nevertheless, many years of suppression had left a mark on it, and although the idea and the steps were still there, the upaupa of the old did not really exist anymore. In the beginning of the 20th century Tahitian dances were only performed on such festivities as 14 July and saw an evolution into what they have become nowadays. Around 1900 the traditional costumes came back, and although they still looked more like mother Hubbard dresses or ponchos, at least they were made of traditional materials. Around 1920 strips of raffia were added, which soon would develop into the characteristic more or grass skirt (in reality made from hibiscus fibers) of Tahiti. The bare torso (for men only) became acceptable. Prizes started to be awarded to the best dancers on a festival. But it was not until 1956 that Madeleine Moua organised a dance group, called the heiva, of which Terii and Takau, daughters of the last queen of Tahiti became patrons. Finally then traditional dancing had the blessing from the establishment. The opening of Faaa international airport in 1961 and the real start of the tourist industry on Tahiti made all the dances which had come forth from the upaupa a part of daily life once more.

Fearless is based in Culver City, California, and are best known for their early pop punk moments captured in the Fearless Flush Sampler and Punk Bites releases, as well as additional releases by bands such as Bigwig and Dynamite Boy, and later Sugarcult, Plain White T's, The Aquabats, Amely and post-hardcore releases by At the Drive-In and Anatomy of a Ghost. However, the label has experimented with different styles in recent years. Acts like Blessthefall, The Word Alive, Ice Nine Kills, Mayday Parade, Pierce The Veil, Starset and The Color Morale have showcased post-hardcore, metalcore and alternative rock bands that have emerged in recent years. Fearless Records' releases are currently distributed nationwide by RED Distribution, but after Concord Music Group's take-over in 2015, they will be distributed by Universal Music Group. History Bob Becker started Fearless Records when he was selling his friends tacos at their shows. He would also go to record stores and put their records on consignment. The record label name came from Bob not knowing what he was doing at the time and \\"not being afraid to jump in head first.\\" Fearless Records was officially formed in 1994. In 2000, Fearless Records released Punk Goes Metal, the first compilation album from the Punk Goes... series. Since then the Punk Goes... series has expanded. It has included seven Punk Goes Pop releases, two Punk Goes Acoustic releases, Punk Goes 80's and 90's, Punk Goes Crunk, Punk Goes Classic Rock, and Punk Goes X which features cover songs that were featured at the 2011 Winter X Games. Punk Goes Pop 5 was released on November 6, 2012. On January 1, 2014, Fearless Records released a video on their page on YouTube announcing bands that will be releasing albums in 2014 and also announced Fearless Records' compilation of Punk Goes 90's 2. In 2005, Fearless Records released the studio album All That We Needed by Plain White T's, a thirteen-song collection that proved to be a breakthrough for both the label and the Illinois-based band. \\"Hey There Delilah,\\" a single from that album, reached No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100, became a success for the label and was certified as a multi-platinum single. On November 8, 2010, Fearless announced the release of a Christmas-themed compilation album, titled 'Tis the Season to Be Fearless. It would feature eight of their signed artists recording original songs. The album was available for pre-ordering on iTunes the same day, and was released on November 22, 2010. three years later, Fearless Records released Punk Goes Christmas featuring original & cover tracks from All Time Low, ISSUES, New Found Glory, and more. In 2011, Fearless Records released Breathe Carolina's album Hell Is What You Make It. \\"Blackout,\\" a single from the album, became another success for the label. It debuted at No. 32 on Billboard Hot 100 and was certified as a gold single. In October 2012, Fearless Records announced that they had launched a sister label called \\"Old Friends Records,\\" which would sign more indie rock artists including Hellogoodbye. In November 2013, Fearless Records announced a second imprint label called \\"Outerloop Records,\\" along with their first signing Ice Nine Kills. The label, with a back-catalog of about 150 albums, was acquired by Concord Bicycle Music in May 2015 for an estimated $10,000,000.

She was mentioned in a battle call because she was the wife of American Revolutionary War general John Stark. A state park and state highway in Vermont are named after her. Life and significance Elizabeth \\"Molly\\" Page was born on February 16, 1737/8 to Puritans Caleb Page and Elizabeth Merrill. She was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts, moved with her family to Dunbarton, New Hampshire, around 1755, and was the daughter of the first postmaster of New Hampshire, Caleb Page. Her mother died when she was five, and she was adopted by her aunt, Ruth Wallingford, a widow with ten children of her own. She spent ten years with the Wallingfords. She later returned to live with her father in Starkstown in 1752 at the age of 15. Her father owned slaves, which was not common in New Hampshire. She married John Stark on August 20, 1758. Together they had 11 children, including their eldest son Caleb Stark. The Molly Stark House still stands in Dunbarton at Page's Corner, denoted by a New Hampshire historical marker (number 111). Stark gained historical notoriety due to her husband's battle call of \\"There are your enemies, the Red Coats and the Tories. They are ours, or this night Molly Stark sleeps a widow!\\" before engaging with the British and Hessian army in the Battle of Bennington. Stark is also known for her success as a nurse to her husband's troops during a smallpox epidemic and for opening their home as a hospital during the war. In late November 1778, she petitioned the New Hampshire Court \\"praying for leave to inoculate herself and family for the Small Pox,\\" but was denied by state authorities who continued to ban inoculation for fear that it would spread the disease. In New England Stark is honored throughout New Hampshire and Vermont with many businesses, streets and schools bearing her name, as well as the Molly Stark State Park in Wilmington, Vermont and a statue of a gun-toting Molly which overlooks the Deerfield River. There was a gazebo next to the statue, but, during Hurricane Irene's visit in 2011 which flooded downtown Wilmington, the gazebo disappeared. The inn on the other side was badly damaged, but, the statue stood tall, and never moved. Also named for her is the Molly Stark Trail, otherwise known as Route 9, which crosses southern Vermont and is thought to be the route used by General Stark on his victory march home from the Battle of Bennington. Molly Stark Mountain is one of the Green Mountain peaks on the Long Trail, just south of Camel's Hump and north of Route 17; the adjacent peak is Baby Stark. The Molly Stark cannon, or \\"Old Molly\\", bears her name, and is kept by the New Boston Artillery Company in New Boston, New Hampshire, denoted by a New Hampshire historical marker (number 146). The Molly Stark Chapter of the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution is located in Manchester, New Hampshire. In Ohio and Minnesota Numerous revolutionary war veterans settled in Ohio, so the General and his wife were honored there. Molly Stark Park is located in Nimishillen Township, Stark County, in northeastern Ohio. It is the grounds of the former Molly Stark Hospital, which served as a tuberculosis sanatorium between 1929 and 1956 and as a general hospital and geriatric facility until 1995. In 2008, the county park board offered to buy the hospital and its grounds for a dollar, and the county opened the first public park in the township in April 2009. Molly Stark Lake in Otter Tail County, Minnesota, is named for her.

Release and background Bowie wrote and recorded five songs for the film, in which he also starred as Jareth, the king of the goblins. A love ballad, \\"As The World Falls Down\\" was written for a dream sequence in which Jareth and the film's heroine, Sarah Williams, dance at a fantastic masquerade ball. Bowie said of the song, \\"[Director] Jim Henson wanted something which was fairly old-fashioned in its sentiments and it is, for me, the prettiest tune in the movie, and the most relaxed.\\" \\"As The World Falls Down\\" is the seventh track on the Labyrinth soundtrack album, which was released in July 1986 to coincide with the film's U.S. premiere. EMI planned to also release the song as a single in late 1986. As a result, a 3:40 edit was produced along with a promotional music video. However, perhaps because Bowie did not want the love ballad to lessen the impact of his upcoming harder-sounding release Never Let Me Down, the single release was cancelled. The edit was released as a bonus track on the Virgin Records re-release of Tonight in 1995, and the video was included on Bowie – The Video Collection (1993) and on the DVD version of Best of Bowie (2002). The full-length 4:50 album version of the song was included on the 5-track CD I Am Iman, personally compiled by Bowie as a promotional device packaged with initial copies of his wife Iman's 2001 autobiography of the same name.* Music video A promotional video was shot by Steve Barron to accompany the edit of the song slated for single release. The video splices clips from Labyrinth with monochrome footage of Bowie performing the song in an elegant room accompanied by the character Hoggle from the film. The storyline follows photocopies of Bowie enchanting a woman in an office building (portrayed by French actress Charlotte Valandrey). Barron's videos for \\"As The World Falls Down\\" and the Labyrinth theme song \\"Underground\\" so impressed Jim Henson that he recruited Barron to direct his television series The Storyteller. Reception Rolling Stone called the song a \\"hidden gem\\" of Bowie's career and included \\"As The World Falls Down\\" on its list of 30 essential Bowie songs, describing it as a \\"sparkling, subdued ballad...which intermingles a tender vocal performance from Bowie and a sinewy bass line with glassy New Romantic synths\\". Smooth Radio chose \\"As The World Falls Down\\" as number 11 on its ranking of Bowie's 20 greatest songs, and argued that it \\"deserves to be considered amongst Bowie's finest ever songs\\". Newsweek deemed the song \\"pure 80s cheese\\", conceding that \\"it does have a lovely chorus\\" however. Gigwise named the song as one of \\"the 50 best ever original songs made for movies\\". According to Bowie biographer David Buckley in 2015, \\"As The World Falls Down\\" was in the top 30 highest-selling Bowie songs on iTunes in the United Kingdom, and the Labyrinth soundtrack was Bowie's third-best selling iTunes album. At the time of Bowie's death in 2016, \\"As The World Falls Down\\" was the 32nd highest- selling Bowie UK download.

This time, \\"Fear not the crusted warblers, but be wary of the Mad Cheese Grater for he shall slaw the features from your face. Beware the public carnivores as they inevitably edibly have a soft nosed hollow point magnum behind every bush.\\" \\"Great White Buffalo\\" is one of the mainstays of Nugent's catalog and was generated on this album. In an interview with Classic Rock Revisited he discusses how he and Grange developed the song idea: \\"This was yet another magical moment like the original musical burst of so many of my songs. This amazing lick/song erupted spontaneously during a recording session around 1972-73,\\" Nugent says. \\"As I was tuning up my Blonde Byrdland, that pattern leaped forth with a force to reckon with. Killer bass player, Rob Grange, stopped me and asked what the hell that was, and I said \\"I don't know, just jackin’ around, tuning up.\\" He told me to play it again, but I failed to play the lick the same as I had just done moments before and he kept badgering me to re-discover the lick. I didn't. But after recording some other songs, I again went to tune up my Gibson and the lick burst forth again. Rob Grange yelled 'That's it! That's it!' So I played it a few times, showed the guys where I wanted to stop and start it up again, turned on the tape machine and recorded it in one fell swoop, making up the lyrics as I went along, articulating to the best of my ability my take on the great Indian legend of the spiritual beast of yore. Rob Grange came up with that wonderful fluid bass melody at the end, Vic the thundering double bass drum assault, and history was made. To this day it is one of my and the audiences' and band's all time favorites.\\" Also featured, a frantic and happily deranged version of \\"Maybellene\\", a 1955 classic of Chuck Berry (often quoted by Nugent in the late 70s as a major influence on his playing). Ted Nugent is credited for a one-finger guitar solo under the moniker \\"Rev Atrocious Theodosius\\". The album includes one of very few \\"calm\\" Nugent songs of this era, \\"Sasha\\", which Nugent dedicated to his newly born daughter. Due to Warner Bros distributing the album worldwide, Ted Nugent's music eventually began to reach overseas markets, but his royalties were not up to his expectations - DiscReet's manager & owner Frank Zappa reported mediocre sales. In late October 1974, rhythm guitarist Derek St. Holmes joined the band at least for one of the Amboy Dukes' final shows at Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago. By 1975, Nugent abandoned the troubled DiscReet label and signed with Epic Records. He teamed with producer Tom Werman and Aerosmith’s managers, Leber- Krebs, who organized his live tours into commercially successful operations. The only Amboy Dukes member who continued with Nugent in his solo career is bassist Rob Grange. Nugent's band also included Derek St. Holmes on vocals and guitar, and drummer Clifford Davies; Ted Nugent moved forward to national and worldwide success. In the 1993 film Dazed and Confused, the character Wooderson, played by Matthew McConaughey, wears a t-shirt featuring the Tooth Fang & Claw album cover. In 1995, \\"Tooth, Fang & Claw\\" was a song on the album Spirit of the Wild, which marked Ted Nugent's return to an outdoor lifestyle and his original sound of hard rock.

It is the largest harbor on the south side of the island and it is surrounded by steep hills which create an enclave that is cut off from its immediate hinterland. The United States assumed territorial control over the southern portion of Guantánamo Bay under the 1903 Lease agreement. The United States exercises jurisdiction and control over this territory, while recognizing that Cuba retains ultimate sovereignty. The government of Cuba regards the U.S. presence in Guantánamo Bay as an illegal occupation on the basis that the Cuban–American Treaty \\"was obtained by threat of force and is in violation of international law.\\" Some legal scholars judge that the lease may be voidable.De Zayas, Alfred. (2003.) The Status of Guantánamo Bay and the Status of the Detainees. It is the home of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and the Guantanamo Bay detention camp located within the base, which are both governed by the United States. Since the 1959 revolution, Cuba has only cashed a single lease payment from the United States government.  Climate  Guantánamo Bay has a hot semi-arid climate according to the Köppen climate classification, with high temperatures throughout the year. Rainfall is rather low, and it is one of the driest regions in Cuba.  U.S. control of Guantánamo Bay  Aerial view of Guantánamo Bay The United States first seized Guantánamo Bay and established a naval base there in 1898 during the Spanish–American War in the Battle of Guantánamo Bay.Nofi, A.A., 1995, The Spanish–American War, 1898, Pennsylvania: Combined Books, In 1903, the United States and Cuba signed a lease granting the United States permission to use the land as a coaling and naval station. The lease satisfied the Platt Amendment; this amendment stated a naval base at \\"certain specific points agreed upon by the President of the United States\\" was needed to \\"enable the United States to maintain independence of Cuba.\\" History Map of Cuba with location of Guantánamo Bay indicated. The original inhabitants of the bay, the Taínos, called it Guantánamo. Christopher Columbus landed in 1494, naming it Puerto Grande.Gott, Richard Cuba: A new history, Yale University Press: 2004 On landing, Columbus' crew found Taíno fishermen preparing a feast for the local chieftain. When Spanish settlers took control of Cuba, the bay became a vital harbor on the south side of the island. The bay was briefly known as Cumberland Bay when the British seized it in 1741 during the War of Jenkins' Ear. British Admiral Edward Vernon arrived with a force of eight warships and 4,000 soldiers with plans to march on Santiago de Cuba. However, local guerrilla forces (Creoles and Spaniards) defeated him and forced him to withdraw or face becoming a prisoner. In late 1760, boats from and HMS Boreas cut out the French privateers Vainquer and Mackau, which were hiding in the bay. The French were also forced to burn the Guespe, another privateer, to prevent her capture. During the Spanish–American War of 1898, the U.S. Navy fleet attacking Santiago needed shelter from the summer hurricane season. They chose Guantánamo because of its excellent harbor. U.S. Marines landed with naval support in the invasion of Guantánamo Bay in June 1898. As they moved inland, however, Spanish resistance increased and the marines required support from Cuban scouts. The Guantanamo Bay Naval Base surrounds the southern portion of the bay. The naval base, nicknamed \\"GTMO\\" or \\"Gitmo\\", covers on the western and eastern banks of the bay. It was established in 1898, when the United States took control of Cuba from Spain following the Spanish–American War. The newly-formed American protectorate incorporated the Platt Amendment in the 1901 Cuban Constitution. Tomás Estrada Palma, the first President of Cuba, offered a perpetual lease for the area around Guantánamo Bay on February 23, 1903. The 1903 Cuban–American Treaty of Relations held, among other things, that the United States, for the purposes of operating coaling and naval stations, has \\"complete jurisdiction and control\\" of the Guantánamo Bay, while recognizing that the Republic of Cuba retains ultimate sovereignty.Olga Miranda Bravo, Vecinos Indeseables: La Base Yanqui en Guantánamo (La Habana: Editorial Ciencias Sociales, 1998) In 1934 a new Cuban-American Treaty of Relations, reaffirming the lease, granted Cuba and its trading partners free access through the bay, modified the lease payment from $2,000 in U.S. gold coins per year to the 1934 equivalent value of $4,085 in U.S. dollars, and made the lease permanent unless both governments agreed to break it or until the U.S. abandoned the base property.Destination Guantanamo Bay Avalon Law Yale, Retrieved on July 16, 2015 After the Cuban Revolution of 1953–1959, United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower insisted that the status of the base remain unchanged, despite Fidel Castro's objections. Since then, the Cuban government has cashed only one of the rent checks from the U.S. government, and even then only because of \\"confusion\\" in the early days of the leftist revolution, according to Castro. The remaining un-cashed checks, made out to \\"Treasurer General of the Republic\\" (a title that ceased to exist after the revolution), were kept in Castro's office stuffed into a desk drawer. The United States used Guantanamo Bay as a processing center for asylum-seekers and as a camp for HIV-positive refugees in the 1990s. Over a period of six months, the USA interned over 30,000 Haitian refugees in Guantanamo, while another 30,000 fled to the Dominican Republic. Eventually, the USA admitted 10,747 of the Haitians to refugee status in the United States. Most of the refugees were housed in a tent city on the re-purposed airstrip that would later be used to house the complex used for the Guantanamo military commissions. The refugees who represented discipline or security problems were held on the site that later became Camp XRay, the initial site of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. In August 1994, rioting broke out in the detention camps and 20 U.S. military police and 45 Haitians were injured. Since 2002, the base has included the detainment camp for individuals deemed of risk to United States national security. In 2009 U.S. President Barack Obama gave orders for the detention camp to close by January 22, 2010. , the detention camp remains open due to a congressional refusal of funds for its closure. Alfred-Maurice de Zayas has argued that the 1903 lease agreement was imposed on Cuba under duress and was a treaty between unequals, no longer compatible with modern international law, and voidable ex nunc. He makes six suggestions for a peaceful settlement, including following the procedure outlined in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.

It was founded in 2003 as an imprint of Gotee Records. While Gotee signs mostly rap, hip-hop, and pop-rock artists, Mono vs Stereo leaned more towards indie music. History 2003–2006 Mono vs Stereo was established in 2003 and released its first project The compilation album featured the debut song from The Evan Anthem (also Mono vs Stereo's first signing) as well as an exclusive track from Matthew Thiessen and the Earthquakes (side project from Relient K's lead vocalist). Soon after followed a release by Relient K titled The Vinyl Countdown, and the debut album from The Evan Anthem titled Prologue. 2004 saw the release of an EP from singer/songwriter Andy Zipf, an EP from Chasing Victory; and, in the fall, the highly acclaimed debut album from The Showdown titled A Chorus of Obliteration. In 2005 another Revolution compilation was released with new material from The Evan Anthem and again Matthew Thiessen and the Earthquakes. This was followed by the release of MVS's next signing Last Tuesday, and shortly after that the second album from The Evan Anthem called Sens. Finally in the fall two strong debut albums were released, the first by Chasing Victory and the next by southern-hardcore act Maylene & The Sons of Disaster. 2006 began with the release of another new act House of Heroes. This was followed by a concept album called My Other Band which featured five different side projects from members of Relient K, Demon Hunter, Bleach, and Audio Adrenaline. In August the second album from road dogs Last Tuesday was released, and on the heels of that came Gasoline Heart's debut album. In the first half of 2007 released from The Showdown and Chasing Victory were released to critical acclaim. 2008–present In early 2009 Mono vs. Stereo was brought out of retirement by Relient K who now oversee the label, after completing their contract with Gotee Records.

SABR Biography Project Sutton Sothoron (April 27, 1893 – June 17, 1939) was an American professional baseball player, coach and manager. As a player, he was a spitball pitcher who spent 11 years in the major leagues playing for the St. Louis Browns, Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians and the St. Louis Cardinals. Born in Bradford, Ohio, Sothoron threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . He attended Albright College and Juniata College. Sportswriters frequently misspelled Sothoron's given name (as \\"Allan\\") and family name (as \\"Southern\\", among other variations) and some sources continue to refer to him as \\"Allan,\\" although his personal documents show his preference for Allen. Career Sothoron broke into the major leagues when the spitball was still legal. His best season came in 1919, when he posted a 20–13 record with a 2.20 earned run average for the Browns, finishing fifth in the American League in wins and ERA. After the spitball was outlawed following the 1919 campaign, Sothoron at first was not permitted to throw it, then in mid-1920 he was added to a list of 17 spitballers in the majors who were allowed to continue using the banned pitch. But he was never able to match his 1919 numbers. His pitching career ended in St. Louis with the National League Cardinals, where he played for his first MLB manager, Branch Rickey, and led the NL in shutouts with four in , despite a mediocre 10–16 (3.57) record. During his MLB career, he appeared in 264 games pitched, and allowed 1,583 hits and 596 bases on balls in 1,582⅓ innings pitched. He struck out 576 and hurled 102 complete games. In 1921, sportswriter Bugs Baer came up with this immortal quip: \\"Allen S. Sothoron pitched his initials off yesterday.\\" After his playing days, Sothoron managed in minor league baseball, coached for the Cardinals (1927), Boston Braves (1928), and Browns (1932–1933), and with the 1933 Browns he served a brief, eight-game managerial stint after the dismissal of Bill Killefer. After compiling a win-loss record of 2–6 between July 19 and July 27, he was replaced with hometown favorite Rogers Hornsby.Retrosheet, \\"Allen Sothoron\\" Sothoron died in St. Louis at age 46 in the middle of the 1939 season after a series of illnesses.

History The parcel of land that is now Pease Park was donated to the city of Austin by Texas Governor Elisha M. Pease and his wife in 1875. The land remained undeveloped until the city and civic organizations cooperated to beautify the park in 1926, building entrance gates, restrooms, and other amenities.

During its production, the car was sold as a Studebaker, per the marketing agreement between the two firms, but Studebaker collectors break the vehicles out under the Studebaker-Garford name because of the extent of Garford components. Garford was a manufacturer of automobile components and chassis for a number of early automotive works. Studebaker, which had been in the wagon-making business since the 1850s, produced their first automobile in 1897, but did not go into full production until 1902 with the introduction of the Studebaker Electric. Under the agreement, Garford would assemble each chassis, and then ship it to South Bend for completion. Studebaker-Garfords were powered by gasoline engines which initially produced 8bhp. The first Studebaker-Garfords were designated Models “A” and “B”, and were listed as five-passenger touring cars with a detachable tonneau, which, once removed, converted the car into a two-person runabout. The Model “C” was also introduced in 1904 and is considered the first formal touring car, but did not come with a collapsible (convertible) top. Headlights for the cars were available at extra cost. Until its final year, the car received a number of mechanical upgrades as technology advanced: * 1905, Series 15HP was powered by a two-cylinder horizontal engine producing 15 bhp. Series 020HP introduced a four-cylinder engine, but the engine delivered 15 bhp, not the promised 20 bhp. * 1906 Series E, F, and G were all four-cylinder cars with increased wheelbase, up two inches to 98” from the previous year. The Studebaker-Garford also introduced a town car body. Options for the open cars included a folding top and windshield. ::Note: Model G 30 was also built and sold as the Garford, beginning in 1908, after Studebaker took control of the E-M-F Company, with which it had also entered into a body-building, marketing, and distribution deal to sell E-M-F cars through Studebaker wagon dealerships. With the company no longer exclusively relying on Garford, Studebaker unofficially modified the agreement and allowed Garford to enter the automobile business on a limited basis. * 1907–1911 Studebaker-Garfords from this period emerged with more refinements, and more body styles with each model year. The last Studebaker exclusive model was the G-10. By 1910, however, chassis production was increasingly favoring Garford's own vehicle brand, and Studebaker was forced to take steps to reassert its contractual rights. Grudgingly, Garford accommodated Studebaker, but the relationship between the two companies became tense. However, by 1911, E-M-F's engine and chassis plant was bought out by Studebaker president Fred Fish and the two firms ended their tenuous relationship. Garford would continue producing its own cars, but without a distribution network firm, failed to produce a volume sufficient to make the organization profitable. In 1913, Garford was purchased by John North Willys and merged into Willys-Overland.

They share a connection through Edinburgh College of Art, where most studied and worked together during or soon after the First World War. As friends and colleagues, they discussed painting and were influenced by one another's work. They were bound together as members of Edinburgh-based exhibition bodies: the Royal Scottish Academy (RSA), Society of Scottish Artists (SSA) and the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour (RSW). They predominantly painted still life and Scottish landscapes, and shared an interest in working both in oil and watercolour.

Gameplay  Essentially a text-based management game. The player's task is to manage a software house, create new games, manage his publicity and make a profit of £10000. Meanwhile, he must achieve the status of \\"Software Star\\" for ten successive months. Having a large portfolio of games has its advantages by increasing the player's monthly sales. However, money must be spent on promoting aging titles. Each game has its own quality rating, where the quality increases with the amount of time spent on development. Managing the productivity of the player's staff is also key to the game, giving him a snapshot of the last six months. He could decide to either discipline offer incentives or take no action. There are four sales regions where the player's products are sold. These regions are ordered from one to four, depending on how much importance he gives to them by consulting the sales from the previous month. Public relations also needs tweaking by choosing Honesty or Hype. Each decision has an effect on his company image. Finally, the player will have to evaluate his potential market depending on the time of year and decide how many advertising pages to buy. Markets are larger around Christmas and New Year. It is then time to sit back and look at the sales figures as the player's game enters the Top 20. He is then given a sales break-even figure and each game climbs the chart if it sells well to the Number One spot. At the end of the month, the player views your monthly statement to check his progress and Stardom rating ranging from Nobody to Software Star. At the end of the year, the directors will check the player's progress. They will either fire him, raise the bar, or give him another chance.

For the New Zealand river with this name see: Aparima River. For the New Zealand town called Aparima, see Riverton, New Zealand. The aparima or Kaparima (Rarotongan) is a dance from Tahiti and the Cook Islands where the mimicks (apa) with the hands (rima) are central, and as such it is close to the hula or Tongan tauolunga. It is usually a dance for groups. There are two types of aparima: the aparima hīmene (sung handdance) and the aparima vāvā (silent handdance), the latter being performed with music only, and no singing. The music is often played on the guitar or the Tahitian ukulele. The stories depicted by the dance are taken from daily traditional occupations or ancient myths. Unlike the other Tahitian dances, this one is more often performed with the dancers dressed in pāreu and maro. It can also (especially the aparima vāvā) be performed seated, much like the Tongan māuluulu.

He is an important chronicler for the years between 1102 and 1139 in the Mezzogiorno. As an historian, he is not only reliable, as he was often an eyewitness to events he recounts, but also partisan, for he was a Lombard by birth and he fiercely opposed the Normans, whom he saw as barbarians. He was an opponent of King Roger II of Sicily, and a supporter of Innocent II against Roger's friend Anacletus II. He was, above all, a patriotic supporter of Benevento. As a supporter of Innocent II, Falco was exiled from Benevento in 1134.Dale, p. 38. T.S. Brown writes that Falco demonstrated \\"a blazing pride in his city and a vitriolic hate of the Normans.\\"T.

Breed Characteristics The Skyros breed generally stands between 9.1 and 11 hands (92 to 112 cm) high, and may be, bay, dun, brown or black. The small-bodied species of the Skyrian horse is one of the rarest horse breeds in the world. It is native to Greece, and in ancient times lived throughout the country, but now is only found in the wild in Skyros and in breeding and welfare farms on the island of Skyros. At the time of writing [2009] there are 220 Skyrian horses in Greece, of which 152 live in Skyros. The Skyrian horse is a protected species. The Skyrian horses are friendly, social, robust and intelligent animals. The head is very handsome. The mane is long and thick and usually a hue darker than the skin colour. Their legs are slim, strong and wiry, with strong joints. The tail is low set. The hooves are small, compact and strong, usually black, and do not need shoeing. The Silva Project is currently working to promote the foundation of Skyros herds elsewhere in Greece and abroad. The Skyros Island Horse Trust based in Skyros is running a highly successful breeding, conservation, education and welfare project with the Skyrian horses. Another key organisation working to protect the Skyrian horse is the Skyrian horse society, which has created a stud book and is setting up a pedigree for the Skyrian horse. Also another non profit organisation Hippolytus est.2010 (ελληνικά Ιππόλυτος) based in Falani Larissa is making efforts towards promoting the breed culturally and at the same time helping with its preservation. History Their legs are slim, strong and wiry, with strong joints. The tail is low set. The Skyros breed is believed to be descended from horses brought to the island of Skyros during the 5th to 8th centuries BCE by Athenian colonists. It is possible that they were used by Alexander the Great in his conquests, and also possible that they are the horses depicted in the friezes of the Parthenon. They developed mainly as semi-feral horses in the mountainous area on the southern part of the island, although individuals were caught and tamed by farmers for agricultural uses. The advances in agricultural mechanisation during the 1960s threatened the survival of the breed, as they were no longer needed for farm work and their numbers were already low. The prevalence of feral donkeys in the same area of Skyros is also a threat, as the two groups cross-breed and prevent pure breeding by the Skyros horses. During the 1970s there was a short-lived breeding program focused on the Skyros breed. This program brought publicity to the breed, and resulted in them being declared critically endangered in 1991. Uses The horses are often kept semi-wild, ranging the mountainous interior of the island until they are needed at the harvest for threshing grain. Skyroi are also used as pack horses, harness horses, and for riding.

He was born in February 1950 in the city of Valencia, Spain, into a family of eleven brothers and sisters. Since 1970, he has been living and working in Barcelona. Career Mariscal's language is synthetic, with few strokes and a great deal of expressiveness. He started studying at Colegio El Pilar in Valencia. After that he studied design at the Elisava School in Barcelona, but he soon left to learn directly in his environment and follow his own creative impulses. His first steps were in underground comics, a task that he soon combined with illustration, sculpture, graphic design and interior design. In 1979, he designed the Bar Cel Ona logo, a work that would make him popular. The following year, he opened the first bar in Valencia designed by Mariscal, together with Fernando Salas, the Duplex, for which he designed one of his most famous pieces, the Duplex stool, an authentic icon of the 1980s. In 1981, his work as a furniture designer led him to participate in the exhibition Memphis, an International Style, in Milan. In 1987, he gave an exhibition at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and participated in the Documenta de Kassel. Garriris, 1987, Musée national d'art moderne, Paris Throughout the 1980s, he designed several textile collections for Marieta and Tráfico de Modas and exhibited at the Vinçon salon in Barcelona. In 1989, Cobi was chosen as the mascot for the Barcelona 1992 Olympic Games. The mascot was the centre of great controversy because of its vanguard image, although time has shown its creator to have been right, and now Cobi is recognised as the most profitable mascot in the history of the modern games. He later created the cartoon series The Cobi Troupe. He opened the Estudio Mariscal in 1989 and has collaborated in several projects with designers and architects such as Arata Isozaki, Alfredo Arribas, Fernando Salas, Fernando Amat and Pepe Cortés. His most notable works include the visual identities for the Swedish social democratic party, Socialdemokraterna; the Spanish radio station Onda Cero; Barcelona Zoo; the University of Valencia; the Lighthouse Centre for Architecture and Design in Glasgow, the GranShip Cultural Centre in Japan and the London postproduction company, Framestore. In 1995, Twipsy was chosen as the mascot for the Expo 2000 in Hannover. The success of this mascot led to the Twipsy series, in which the star is a virtual space messenger and the action is set in Internet. Twipsy was sold to over one hundred countries. In 1995, he also designed the Amorosos Furniture collection for the Italian manufacturer Moroso, which includes one of his most successful pieces of furniture, the Alexandra armchair, in which the organic shapes and the use he makes of colour communicate the vital, extroverted style that characterises Mariscal's objects. In 1995, Mariscal collaborated with schoolchildren in the Land of Valencia to create a collective mural sculpture during protest days for the use of the Valencian language in the education. The mural is now located in the Teacher's Faculty of the University of Valencia and open to the public free of charge. Partial view of the mural created by Mariscal and students of schools in Valencian as part of \\"Meeting of Schools in Valencian (language)\\" in 1995. In 2001, he designed the much sought after diary room chair used in Channel 4's second instalment of Big Brother.\\"Big, posh Brother\\", The Daily Mirror, 9 June 2001 (now archived on Questia Online Library, accessdate 6 July 2009).\\"Digest\\", Design Week, 31 May 2001 (accessdate 6 July 2009). In 2002, his multidisciplinary career culminated with the integral design of the Gran Hotel Domine Bilbao, nestling between the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and the ria, the creative concept of which is based on reflecting the history of design of the 20th century. Mariscal designed things from the uniforms to the façade, including the graphic image and its website. He did the interior design of the GHDB with Fernando Salas, who also collaborated in Calle 54 Club, a project in which Fernando Trueba also forms part and which provides Madrid with a live space where the most prestigious Latin jazz musicians perform, such as Bebo Valdés and Paquito D'Rivera. Madrid is also the home of Hotel Puerta América, belonging to the Silken Group, a project in which the best architecture and design studios of the moment participated. Estudio Mariscal and Fernando Salas were responsible for the interior design of the eleventh floor. Another sample of his interdisciplinary vocation is the audiovisual show Colors, which premiered in Barcelona in 1999 and starred the robot Dimitri, another of Mariscal's creatures. The script of Colors has been adapted for the frequent conferences on design he gives all over the world which, rather than conferences are entertaining pocket shows marked with humour and tenderness. Sillón Alexandra, para Moroso In 2005, he made several objects for the children's collection, Me Too, by Magis, a fruitful collaboration that is still under way. Some of his most recent works, which he continues to combine with his artistic task, are the image of the Spanish financial institution, Bancaja; that of the 32nd America's Cup, of the new brand of bags for Camper, Camper For Hands, as well as the interior design of the Ikea Restaurant in Vitoria. In 2006, he participated in ARCO with the sculpture, Crash!, a homage to the optimist design of the 1950s and a way of telling us that that confidence in the future has exploded because now we need to think about how to make a future possible. In 2009, from 1 July until 1 November,\\"Exhibitions preview: Javier Mariscal/Jan Kaplický, London\\", The Guardian, 27 June 2009 (accessdate 6 July 2009). a major UK retrospective of Mariscal's work is being shown at the London Design Museum, in which visitors enter through a tunnel showing 640 examples of the designer's style from 1970 to the present day, including his typefaces. He will also be creating a mural for the outside of the Design Museum itself.\\"Bright, colourful, refreshing. This exhibition is perfect for a hot summer's day in London\\", London SE1, 2 July 2009 (accessdate 6 July 2009). Mariscal drew and co-directed, with Academy Award-winning director Fernando Trueba, the 2010 Spanish-British animated feature-length film Chico and Rita. The film celebrates the music and culture of Cuba and depicts a love story set against backdrops of Havana, New York, Las Vegas, Hollywood and Paris in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Awards In 1999, Mariscal received the National Design Prize of the Spanish Department of Industry and the BCD Foundation grants in recognition of achievements throughout a professional career. In 2011 he won the Award of the Hungarian National Student Jury for Chico and Rita at the 7th Festival of European Animated Feature Films and TV Specials.10\\\\. Kecskeméti Animációs Filmfesztivál 7.

He is a right-handed batsman primarily, and is an occasional right arm off spin bowler. His batting style is akin to Virender Sehwag, with minimal foot movement, and he has credited Sehwag to helping his batting improve. Early life Whilst being a talented cricketer, Ingram was also considered to represent his hometown in rugby. However, he gave up rugby when he broke his jaw during a trial. Domestic career Ingram has played for the Central Stags since 2001, becoming an integral part of an opening pair, with Jamie How. In late March 2009, Ingram scored 166, with partnerships of 159 with How and 115 with George Worker, to help Central Districts defeat Canterbury and qualify for the State Championship final, where Auckland took out the title. He would follow this up with an unbeaten 245, in a partnership of 428 (breaking the record for first-class opening record for New Zealand) with How, to lead Central Districts to an unlikely win against Wellington. In the 2009-10 HRV Cup Final, Ingram hit 54 off 36 balls, setting a strong position that led to Central Stags claiming the title. In what turned out to be his last game for Central Districts, Ingram made 97 off 54 in a 201 run opening partnership with How, who made 102, in an HRV Cup T20 match. The opening partnership between Ingram and How of 201 was the highest ever opening stand in T20 cricket at the time. International career Ingram was a regular player in the NZ A team, and in January 2010, he was selected for the Black Caps 20/20 and ODI squads to play Bangladesh. He scored 69 in his debut ODI match, which remained his highest international score. The next month, he was also selected for the Test squad, replacing the out-of-form Daniel Flynn. He was retained for the Series vs Australia but did not make an impact and was replaced by returning batsman and domestic teammate Mathew Sinclair. He was recalled into the side for a triangular series in July against Sri Lanka and India after Jesse Ryder suffered an elbow injury and Aaron Redmond was unavailable. This was his last international series, as he was dropped after the series. He retired from international cricket in 2011, after being left out of the World Cup squad and not getting a call to say he hadn't made it, despite having the 3rd highest One Day average for New Zealand. Retirement On the 9th of March, 2012 Ingram announced his retirement from first-class cricket. He stated that an Achilles tendon injury and wanting to spend more time with his family were reasons for his retirement. However, he still plays for Taranaki in the Hawke Cup, where he regularly bowls and bats in the middle order. Tractor Incident In 2014, whilst moving cattle, his tractor plunged off a cliff. He managed to jump off the tractor, but landed in the path of it. It ran him over, crushing a couple of vertebrae and dislocating his knee. He popped his knee back into place and walked a kilometre to his neighbours to get help. He was hospitalized for a week before being discharged. Personal life Ingram is married and has two sons. Ingram taught at New Plymouth's Francis Douglas Memorial College, teaching Technology and currently teaches at Waitara High School.

She is voiced by Rachael MacFarlane, the younger sister of one of the series' co-creators, Seth MacFarlane. She is Stan and Francine Smith's 18-year-old daughter and Steve's older sister. Hayley, along with her father Stan, was one of the first two characters who were conceived and created for the series. Across the series, Hayley's storylines typically involve her liberal opinions clashing with her father's staunch conservative beliefs, and her on-again-off-again relationship with boyfriend Jeff Fischer, whom she marries in the show's sixth season. Biography Hayley Smith is the daughter of Stan Smith, a CIA agent, and Francine Smith, a housewife (although, it is later revealed that Stan may not be her biological father but this is one of the three episodes that contradict several others). It is revealed in a brief flashback that she had a twin brother named Bailey. Unlike her father, her mother and her brother, Steve Smith, Hayley is ultra-liberal. She is \\"addicted\\" to marijuana and in \\"Jones for a Smith,\\" Hayley actually worried that her marijuana smoking is getting out of hand and begs Francine to let her go to rehab, with Francine callously telling her daughter to stop being such a melodramatic attention-seeker. Hayley once helped the homeless, and is in favor of gun control. This causes a great amount of distrust and hatred for her on Stan's part, as he consistently has views that are polar opposite to hers. In the third-season episode \\"Stanny Slickers II: The Legend of Ollie's Gold\\", it is revealed that her middle name is Dreamsmasher, as given by Stan. She wears a midriff dress with a ring on her belly. She lives with her parents and goes to Groff Community College, though she moved out temporarily after a bitter argument with Stan. As a college student, Hayley also majors in women's studies and promotes women's rights. Personality Hayley is Stan and Francine's new-age hippie daughter who, despite being a married adult for much of the series, still lives under her parents' roof along with her husband, Jeff. As revealed in the episode \\"The Kidney Stays in the Picture\\", she may or may not be Stan's biological daughter—Francine revealed to have cheated on Stan at a bachelorette party. Nonetheless, Stan still regards her as such. Hayley is passionate, insistent and vocal in her convictions. In mentality, she's portrayed as a passionate liberal, what was originally intended to be the antithesis to her father's far right neoconservative mentality. These character traits were particularly emphasized in the show's beginnings but heavily toned down afterwards. Intuitive and insightful, Hayley is able to instinctively grasp the hidden, inner, and obscure nature of situations. As examples, instantly upon entering the room in the episode \\"Finger Lenting Good\\", she realizes what Stan and Steve are up to in trying to get Jeff to hug them so as to lose his finger for engaging in his [Jeff] vice. As another example, in the episode \\"Da Flippity Flop\\" when the essence of Klaus has entered Stan's body and taken control over it, he attempts to deceive Hayley and Francine into thinking he's truly Stan; however, Hayley instantaneously and half-heartedly acknowledges that it's Klaus. At times, Hayley is casually rude and insulting in attitude especially towards her brother, Steve, which can be described as sibling rivalry. This is primarily because of Hayley's disgust for Steve's obnoxious tendencies and generally shallow taste and desire towards the opposite sex. Several story arcs have been about Hayley's romantic relationship with Jeff. Back when the two were dating, they had several break ups. Hayley is very often the most empathetic member of her family. For example, she helped to unionize the homeless men Stan paid to fight each other, helped free foster children that Roger had enslaved, and is the one most likely to stand up for people's rights when her family tries to exploit people. Nevertheless, she is also sometimes seen as hypocritical and has moments of weakness—for example, in \\"Camp Refoogee\\" she went to an African refugee camp and swore to help the starving people during the short time she expected to be there. However, after finding out they would be there for a few weeks, she went to the spa-like U.N. aid base and went so far as to eat steak, despite being a vegetarian (The episode, The Longest Distance Relationship, she eats part of a steak, and in N.S.A. (No Snoops Allowed), she went an entire day eating just meat after she ate some by mistake). She is often disrespected by other more shallow and self-involved members of the household who seem to find her annoying and are contemptuous of her kinder and more selfless character, especially Stan and Roger. The fourth season has started showing that Hayley is often prone to violent and uncontrollable mood swings. During puberty, she went through violent outbursts during every development, such as having to wear tampons (and ruining the family's white couch by sitting on it while wearing a skirt), being disappointed over how small her breasts were when they finished growing, and getting an enormous pimple. These mood swings terrified her parents and they were fearful of the same problems in her brother, although it is shown Steve has had his temper more under control. Another episode revealed that Hayley flies into a rage when men break up with her. It has gotten to the point where Hayley will have to go to jail if another relationship she has falls apart. While still the most empathetic and possibly most sensible member of the Smith family, Hayley's generally intelligent and independent character becomes more at doubt in later seasons. Even upon moving back under her parents' roof, she is no longer an official student at Groff and once even claims that she always drops back out before term papers can happen and once even hinted that she planned on freeloading off her parents into her adult years. At this point in later seasons, Hayley's morality, sensibility, and seriousness has become much further in comparison to the rest of her more shallow, reckless, and muddled family members, and even Roger. In \\"The Kidney Stays in the Picture\\", when Hayley needs a kidney transplant after drinking more liquor than she can handle, Stan immediately volunteers to have his kidney surgically removed to save Hayley. Francine greatly admires Stan's dedication to Hayley, but sheepishly admits Stan's transplant might result in organ rejection as she is unsure if Stan is Hayley's true father. Stan and Francine go back in time, and it is never revealed who Hayley's real father is as Stan requested that his kidney be taken out regardless and the doctors perform the transplant without revealing which kidney is used. The other potential father to Hayley is Joel Larson, a complete stranger who Francine slept with three days before she and Stan got married. When the doctor asked how they got the other kidney for Hayley, Stan said, \\" I called in a favor.\\" It was later revealed that Roger cut into Larson's stomach with a keyhole saw, getting the kidney. In season 5 episode 15 \\"Merlot Down Dirty Shame\\" it is revealed she and Klaus also share a telepathic ability to communicate. They can talk to each other with their thoughts. Voice actors According to a DVD special on the creation of American Dad, Laura Prepon was initially chosen to play Hayley, but Prepon was dropped and replaced by Rachael MacFarlane, the younger sister of Seth MacFarlane. In French version, the character is dubbed by Edwige Lemoine, the sister of Christophe Lemoine who dubbed Eric Cartman character from South Park. Romance Hayley has a husband named Jeff, who is a vegetarian as well. Hayley did once move out, to move in with Jeff who it turns out lives in his van. They sometimes go hiking and use marijuana together. She once dumped Jeff, because he agrees with everything that she says. During this time, she slept with Stan's boss, Deputy-Director Bullock, a conservative. This happened after they had an argument; he apologized and she ended up sleeping with him at his house. At first, Stan ignored their relationship and decided it was a great chance to be promoted to \\"Deputy-Deputy Director\\". Hayley later dumped Bullock before announcing Stan's promotion. Bullock learned that a more assertive Jeff came back into her life. Being very upset, Bullock promised Stan the promotion if he killed Jeff. Stan didn't kill Jeff, but ended up battling his boss upon him insulting Hayley. Bullock gave Stan the job before Stan finished him off. Jeff disappeared for a time after \\"Phantom of the Telethon,\\" where he was performing hacky-sack tricks on-stage at a telethon when a boat, pushed by Roger, fell on him. Reginald, a talking koala who works for the CIA, befriends Hayley in the episode \\"Family Affair\\". She starts to develop an attraction to Reginald, but is rejected by him as he reveals he has a girlfriend. She respects him, but she leaves an open-ended offer for Reginald by the end of the episode. Embarrassed, she apologizes to Reginald in \\"Cops and Roger\\" and suggests a double date with him and his girlfriend Rhonda and her (temporary) boyfriend, Ian. The date ends up annoying both Ian and Rhonda as Reginald and Hayley continue to openly flirt with each other, and by the end of the episode, both end up leaving their partners in favor of each other. Jeff returns to serenade Hayley in \\"100 A.D.\\" and is shooed away by Stan and Francine for not being good enough for their daughter. However, after Jeff goes to Hayley and confesses his love for her, they decide to elope. They then trick Stan and Francine into giving them $50,000, which they spent trying to escape from Roger who was trying to steal it from them. Hayley and Jeff reunite with the family in the episode \\"There Will Be Bad Blood\\" where they encounter the rest of the family freezing to death in the desert. Hayley reveals that shortly after losing Roger, the two tried to earn money with Jeff as a male prostitute, but finding little work with women, Jeff is forced into gay prostitution, putting him on \\"butt rest\\". They move back in with the Smith family in that same episode. In \\"Less Money, Mo' Problems\\" Hayley and Jeff are shown to be still living in the Smith household, with Jeff constantly annoying Stan with his habits. At the end of the episode, Stan has a change of heart after he sees how hard it would be for them to make it on the salary Jeff brings in. Jeff becomes tricked by Roger in \\"Naked to the Limit, One More Time\\" that Roger is his new imaginary friend. But when Roger accidentally reveals that he is real, Jeff cannot keep the secret and Stan is forced to kill either Roger or Jeff. Both are saved when Roger offers to return to his home planet instead. On the night that the spaceship comes to pick up Roger, he tosses Jeff in the transport beam instead of himself and Jeff is abducted, leaving Hayley alone. Hayley is shown pining and grieving over Jeff's disappearance and supposed death in \\"Spelling Bee My Baby\\", but in order for her to serve as a line judge, Stan and Roger try to fast track her through the grieving process, but in the end she blames them and steals their shuttlecock in retaliation, forcing Roger to go through the grieving process instead. Jeff appears to return from space in the episode \\"Holy Shit, Jeff's Back!,\\" but it is then revealed that the real Jeff Fischer was killed by a race of aliens called the Collectors, and this Jeff is a Collector named Zebleer. However, at the end of the episode, the Collectors are willing to put Jeff's brain in Zebleer to make Hayley happy. However, before they leave, Hayley and Stan had their memories wiped, so they don't know about Jeff's true nature. There have been numerous scenes that hint that Hayley might be bisexual. In the episode \\"Haylias\\", there's a scene where Hayley tells her parents that she's planning to leave the United States to go to France to live a more uninhibited life as well as engage in a string of wild love affairs, including one with a woman named Simone. In Season 12, Jeff and Hayley try to have a child and it is revealed that Jeff is not human. After a few twists and turns, Jeff gets reborn through Roger and is human once again. But, due to how difficult Roger was during the pregnancy, Hayley feels that she isn't ready for a baby and Jeff agrees, having just been born himself.

The name is thought to come from ‘long bank’ (the first part being 'lang' in Scots). It is 9.3 miles/15 km northwest from Paisley (Renfrewshire) and 3.4 miles/5.5 km east from Port Glasgow (Inverclyde) on the A8. History Langbank evolved as a dormitory settlement for Glasgow after the opening of the Glasgow and Greenock Railway in 1841, a function it still performs. Prior to that it was a scattered collection of farms with access to the river. An 1800 map makes reference to Longbank. It remains on the busy A8 trunk road, a few hundred yards from the start of the M8 motorway. Langbank railway station is on the Inverclyde Line. There are two crannogs on the shoreline of the village; Langbank East crannog is at Westferry, by the start of the M8 motorway, Langbank West crannog is immediately beside the A8 dual carriageway opposite Langbank Parish Church. Both crannogs are only visible at lower states of the tide. Visible along the shoreline west of Langbank and stretching all the way to Port Glasgow are the remains of the timber ponds where the shipyards of the lower Clyde stored timber for use in shipbuilding during the 18th Century. Landmarks * Langbank Parish Church (1866) has a spire which was rebuilt three times. * Formakin House (begun 1903) is a curious mansion which was never actually completed as the owner ran out of money. Features include tiny stone monkeys which clamber over the rooftops and a datestone carved with the date \\"1694\\" and the letters \\"DL\\" (standing for \\"Damned Lie\\"). * Finlaystone House (c. 1760) was built as the seat of the Cunningham Earls of Glencairn, but since the 1920s has been home to the MacMillan family and to the chief of Clan MacMillan. The estate is now a popular country park and garden centre. It is located between Langbank and Kilmacolm. * Gleddoch House was the home of Port Glasgow Shipbuilder, Col. Sir James Lithgow Bt. It is now a hotel and leisure complex. St Vincent's College From 1961 to 1978, St Vincent's College was situated in the village. It was a minor seminary of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland. It was opened on 3 October 1961.St. Vincent's College, Langbank: Solemn Opening of the College, Tuesday, 3 October 1961 (The College, 1961) The first rector was Charles McDonald Renfrew, who was a Titular Bishop of Abula and an Auxiliary Bishop of Glasgow.St Augustine's Coatbridge retrieved 17 September 2013 One of its students was the Archbishop of Glasgow, Philip Tartaglia.

Episcopal career Auxiliary Bishop of Trenton, New Jersey Kmiec served as Auxiliary Bishop in Trenton, New Jersey for 10 years. He was appointed Auxiliary Bishop in Trenton on August 26, 1982, and was named Titular Bishop of Simidicca on the same date. Bishop of Nashville, Tennessee Kmiec was Bishop of Nashville, Tennessee for 13 years. He was appointed Bishop on October 13, 1992, and installed on December 3, 1992. Bishop of Buffalo, New York On August 12, 2004, Kmiec was appointed the Bishop of Buffalo; he was installed on October 28, 2004. In 2007, Kmiec announced that the Diocese of Buffalo had a balanced budget, after spending cuts reduced a $2.1 million deficit from the previous year. In August 2009, the Buffalo News was the first to break the story of what became a major situation during Kmiec's tenure as Bishop of Buffalo. The removal of Monsignor Fred R. Voorhes, as Administrator of St. Teresa's in South Buffalo and the subsequent dismissal of Marc J. Pasquale, as Business Administrator and Director of Religious Education at St. Teresa's gained much popularity in the press. Parishioners expressed in interviews with The Buffalo News their discontent with these removals. Pasquale had gone to the Erie County District Attorney's Office prior to his dismissal to raise concerns about questionable financial practices. Kmiec was heavily criticized for downsizing the diocese from 274 parishes and missions in 2005 to 170 in 2011. He also oversaw the closures of 25 elementary schools.At 75, Kmiec reaches a crossroads, Buffalo News, June 4, 2011.Honoring a bishop who weathered the storms, Buffalo News, October 30, 2011. Increasing the number of vocations to the priesthood in the Buffalo Diocese remains a challenge. The Diocese under Kmiec ordained only 18 priests from 2004-11. Retirement On May 29, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI accepted Kmiec's resignation due to his having surpassed the mandatory retirement age of 75. Bishop Richard Malone from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland in Maine was appointed as Kmiec's successor. Malone was installed at St. Joseph Cathedral on August 10, 2012. Kmiec was Bishop of Buffalo for eight years. He served as Bishop Emeritus of Buffalo, having been a priest for more than 52 years. Death Kmiec died on July 11, 2020, aged 84.

It was first released on his 1975 album with Crazy Horse, Zuma. A live version was also released on the 1997 album Year of the Horse. Music and lyrics \\"Danger Bird\\" was recorded in two different sessions several weeks apart that were put together by co- producer David Briggs. It, along with the more famous \\"Cortez the Killer,\\" is one of two songs on Zuma in which Young and Crazy Horse return to the style of songs like \\"Down by the River\\" with long feedback-heavy guitar passages. It is styled as a slow folk song in a minor key. The music provides an intense, brooding atmosphere. In some of the verses a member of Crazy Horse takes the lead vocal while Young provides a backup vocal singing different words. The lyrics to \\"Danger Bird\\" reflect the disintegration of Young's relationship with Carrie Snodgress. Some of the lyrics. including the lines \\"'Cause you've been with another man/There you are and here I am,\\" were originally written for an unreleased song titled \\"L.A. Girls and Ocean Boys\\" that was inspired by a trip Young made to visit Snodgrass in which he found out she had been cheating on him. Music critic Johnny Rogan interprets the titular bird as a \\"metaphor for a doomed relationship.\\" Rogan finds some hopefulness in the final lines \\"And though these wings have turned to stone/I can fly, fly fly away.\\" Music journalist Nigel Williamson is reminded of imagery from Young's 1968 song \\"The Loner\\" by the line \\"Danger bird, he flies alone.\\" Music author Ken Bielen finds additional themes in the song as the comfort we find in complacency and our fear of being vulnerable, for example in line in which the titular bird sings that \\"freedom's just a prison.\\" Young said of \\"Danger Bird\\" that \\"that's a wild song. It's so slow and great. Isn't it slow? Briggs always wanted to remix it. I like the mix. A combination of two songs. 'L.A. Girls and Ocean Boys' I never recorded, but it's part of 'Danger Bird.' Hey, sometimes that's what happens—one song doesn't come out, I'll be writin' another and say 'Oh, that fits.' Bang! Drop it right in.\\" Reception Rock and Roll Hall of Fame guitarist Lou Reed considered the guitar playing on \\"Danger Bird\\" to be the best he had ever heard, stating \\"It makes me cry, it is the best I have heard in my life. The guy is a spectacular guitarist, those melodies are so marvelous, so calculated, constructed note to note… he must have killed to get those notes. It puts my hairs on end!”. David Downing suggests that this may be an overstatement but that the performance is nonetheless \\"remarkable.\\" Downing praises the intensity produced by the \\"straining and stretching notes\\" that Young plays \\"almost in slow motion.\\" Downing especially notes the accompaniment to the final line about flying with stone wings, where Downing feels that the guitar playing allows the listener to feel how heavy those stone wings are but still makes the listener believe that the bird will find a way to fly with them anyway. AllMusic critic Matthew Greenwald describes the guitar solos by Young and Crazy Horse rhythm guitarist Frank Sampedro as being \\"exquisite.\\" Williamson describes the song as representing Young and Crazy Horse \\"at their brooding best.\\" Young biographer Jimmy McDonough describes \\"Danger Bird\\" as \\"perhaps the most unsettling song Young has created, a soundtrack worthy of those ten-cent portraits of Hell found in a Coffin Joe flick,\\" and also \\"a masterpiece, a trip inside the darkest recesses of Shakey's mind.\\" Pitchfork contributor Rob Mitchum describes the song as a \\"triumphantly moody, electric epic\\" which provides \\"spacious opportunities for Young to revive his trademark lacerating guitar tone.\\" Neil Young FAQ author Glen Boyd, comparing it to \\"Cortez the Killer,\\" calls it an \\"equally stunning, if somewhat more underrated contender for a Neil Young and Old Black hall of fame. Rolling Stone Album Guide contributor Paul Evans describes \\"Danger Bird\\" as a \\"standout\\" track on Zuma. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau describes the song as \\"sprawling blockbuster cut\\" which he considers compromised to some extent by its \\"relative neatness and control.\\" A 2015 reader poll by Rolling Stone ranked \\"Danger Bird\\" as Young's 7th best \\"deep cut.\\" A year earlier the editors of Rolling Stone rated \\"Danger Bird\\" to be the 24th best Neil Young song of all time. Live performances Young almost never plays \\"Danger Bird\\" live unless he is performing with Crazy Horse. A live version appears on the 1997 live album Year of the Horse. Bielen describes the guitar playing at the beginning of the song to have an \\"industrial wah-wah sound\\" before proceeding to \\"distorted power chords.\\" This version lasts more than 13 minutes as a result of a lot of jamming.

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Chad. Chad is a landlocked country in central Africa bordered by Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the southwest, and Niger to the west. Chad is divided into three major geographical regions: a desert zone in the north, an arid Sahelian belt in the centre and a more fertile Sudanese savanna zone in the south. First mails Regular mail service in Chad began soon after the French occupation of the area, with a post office established at Fort-Lamy in 1905. Additional offices were opened at Abeche (1909), Amm et Timan (1910), Ati (1909), Bousso (1910), Fada (1920), Faya-Largeau (1920), Mandjafa (1910), and Tchekna (1910). Mail used stamps of French Congo until 1915, then stamps of Ubangi Shari, whose overprints read \\"OUBANGUI-CHARI-TCHAD\\". Overprints A French colonial stamp overprinted for use in Chad. Chad came under civil administration in 1920, and in 1922 received its own stamps, consisting of the issues of Middle Congo overprinted \\"TCHAD\\". The initial issue consisted of 18 values ranging from 1 centime to 5 francs. As with Oubangui-Chari, the administrative situation was clarified from 1924 on by the addition of an additional overprint \\"AFRIQUE EQUATORIALE FRANCAISE\\". 32 color and value combinations appeared between 1924 and 1933, along with another 9 surcharged with new values.https://web.archive.org/web/20180303051122/http://www.stampworldhistory.com/country- profiles-2/africa/chad/ Retrieved 12 August 2018. 1930s In 1930, a set of colorful postage due stamps were the first to be inscribed with the name of the colony, followed by the Colonial Exposition Issue in 1931. Separate stamps issues came to an end in 1936, after which Chad used the stamps issued for all of French Equatorial Africa. Independent Chad A 1972 stamp of Chad In 1959, approaching independence, the country issued its first stamps omitting the letters RF (standing for \\"République française\\", French Republic). These included a 15-franc issue depicting a cotton flower, fishers on Lake Chad and the head of an antelope. Independence in 1960 was not reflected in postage stamps until 1961, when three stamps were issued to celebrate admission to the UN.

Clough Castle Motte and bailey and tower are State Care Historic Monuments in the townland of Clough, in Down District Council area, at grid ref: J4092 4029. The castle was built following John de Courcy's 1177 seizure of eastern Ulster. Features It is an excellent example of an Anglo-Norman castle with an added stone tower. A small kidney- shaped bailey lies south of a large mound, originally separated from it by a 2.1m deep ditch. On top of the 25 ft high motte is a stone tower, enlarged to become a tower house in the 15th century. It is sited off-centre as much of the rest of the top of the motte was occupied by a large hall, which apparently burned down. Around the motte is a ditch, and on the south-east side a low crescent shaped bailey, which was probably once joined to the motte by a wooden bridge. Excavations Excavations on the summit of the mound in 1950 revealed that originally (in the late 12th or early 13th century) the top of the motte was surrounded by a timber palisade within which were pits for archers. Also found was the foundation of a long rectangular hall in the north-east half of the area, probably built in the mid 13th century. Later in the same century a small rectangular stone keep was built to the south-west, two storeys high and surviving to this day, having been conserved in 1981–82. In the late Middle Ages, after what appears to have been a period of disuse, it was restored and added to, resulting in an L-shaped tower house.

Allmusic critic Matthew Greenwald describes Ben Keith's playing on pedal steel to be a highlight of the song. Young biographer David Downing describes his pedal steel playing as having a \\"blue-sky purity.\\" According to Greenwald, the music has a \\"searching, yearning melody that has the element of infinity and journey\\" that perfectly reflects the theme of the lyrics. Sound on Sound editor Sam Inglis describes the mood of the song as being \\"one of resignation, perhaps even exhaustion.\\" The song starts by describing a man getting away from the big city. Although the singer is traveling, he is reflecting on his past with what Downing describes as being \\"full of joy he can't relate to, floating in a dreamy sort of sadness.\\" The lyrics then take on the theme of lovers who are lonely because they can't connect.

Early works of science fiction used Jupiter itself as a location for stories, but modern science has shown that the planet has no solid surface one could land on and that its atmosphere, temperature, high gravity and intense radiation is hostile to human life. As a result, the Jovian system as a whole, including both the space around Jupiter and its very extensive system of moons, is a more common setting for science fiction. On Jupiter Written works * Micromégas (1752) by Voltaire. The eponymous hero and his Saturnian companion stop on Jupiter for a year, where they \\"learned some very remarkable secrets\\". * A Journey in Other Worlds (1894) by John Jacob Astor IV. Explorers from Earth reach Jupiter, prior to traveling on to Saturn. On Jupiter the travelers encounter Earth-like dinosaurs. * The Conquest of Two Worlds (1932) by Edmond Hamilton. Humans explore the solar system and discover intelligent life on Mars and Jupiter, and proceed to ruthlessly conquer and subjugate it. Jupiter is a humid jungle world with high gravity. * Skeleton Men of Jupiter (1943) by Edgar Rice Burroughs. John Carter is transported to Sasoom (Jupiter). * City stories (1952) by Clifford D. Simak. Most humans are eventually voluntarily transformed into creatures able to survive on Jupiter without life support. In this new form, Jupiter appears as a paradise. Jupiter is portrayed as having a solid surface, which is cold, toxic, and barren from a human perspective. * Victory Unintentional (1942) by Isaac Asimov. Human colonists on Ganymede send three extremely powerful and durable robots to explore the surface of Jupiter and contact the Jovians. * Buy Jupiter (1958) by Isaac Asimov. Aliens purchase Jupiter to use as a giant billboard advertising their products to passing trade ships. * A Meeting with Medusa (1972), novella by Arthur C. Clarke. A journey into the depths of Jupiter's atmosphere, where vast, mile-sized floating life-forms have evolved. This is similar to a scene in 2010 in which Jupiter's atmosphere is inhabited by enormous cloud-like creatures which are in turn preyed upon by delta-shaped flying predators. * The Jupiter Theft (1977) by Donald Moffitt. A Chinese/American Jupiter mission is diverted to investigate five immense alien spacecraft headed towards Earth from the direction of Cygnus X-1. The survivors of the captured Jupiter Mission discover their true purpose in appearing in the Solar System is to raid our solar system of a Jupiter-mass planet to use as fuel. In taking Jupiter, the aliens leave behind the burnt-out hulk of their prior Jovian-type fuel planet, which remains as the central core of a new mini-solar system in the past location of Jupiter. * Bio of A Space Tyrant series (1983-2001) by Piers Anthony. Jupiter is rendered into an analogue of North America. The moons are the Caribbean (and possibly Central America as well), Jupiter itself is inhabited by floating cities in its atmosphere to represent the United States, and the Red Spot represents Mexico. * The Cassini Division (1998) by Ken MacLeod, part of the Fall Revolution series (1995–1999). Jupiter has been converted by transhumanists into a habitat for post-human uploads known as the Jovians, while the Solar Union (an inner system socialist collective) and New Mars (a capitalist extrasolar colony) consider whether to attack the civilization, which they perceive to be potentially threatening. * Jupiter (2001) by Ben Bova. A journey into Jupiter's clouds, storms, and the liquid stage of its atmosphere for the discovery of intelligent life there. See also: Grand Tour (novel series). * Manta's Gift (2002) by Timothy Zahn. Jupiter is the home of the Qanska, intelligent lifeforms who dwell amid the layered atmosphere of the planet's equator. The brain of a quadriplegic human is transplanted into an embryonic Qanska, resulting in a transfer of human consciousness to a different species. * Larklight (2006) by Philip Reeve. Jupiter's moons are home to many races that once warred with each other, and are the outskirts of Earth's empire. Old Thunderhead, a sentient storm thousands of years old who has been worshipped as a God, lives on Jupiter along with other sentinent storms. The Jovians breed spores, which can affect minds. They were once used for war and now are only used for advertising. * The Intrepid: Earth's moment of awareness (2008) by Michael James Wilson. Shockwaves from Loop I compress the Local Cloud and heliopause for an imminent contact with the planet Jupiter initiating the birth of the newest binary star in the Milky Way. * Galileo's Dream (2009) by Kim Stanley Robinson.

Ian and Callie are transported to the Jovian Realm where their missing father had been ruling as king and has been invaded by Mars.https://readersfavorite.com/book-review/the- jupiter-chronicles?tmpl=component&print;=1 Comics and manga * In the Battle Angel manga series by Yukito Kishiro, Jupiter has been colonized by humans and is now in the process of having a large artificial surface built over the clouds, having consumed all but a few of its moons for raw materials. The Jupiter Union, as they are known, are in conflict over control of the solar system with Venus, Mars and Earth. *Early issues of 2000 AD comic featured a version of the character Dan Dare. The first 11 issues contained a story in which Dare and his allies fought a malevolent alien race - the Biogs - who had set up a base of operations on Jupiter, apparently within the Great Red Spot itself. *In All-Star Comics #26 the JSA battle a group of creatures from Jupiter that absorb metal, and defeats them all. *In All-Star Comics #13 the Justice Society of America are gassed and sent to different planets by Nazi scientist Hans Goobsten. As Starman awakens from his gas-induced sleep, he sees the planet Jupiter looming before him. As his ship begins to crash, he is saved by several flying men of metal, who explain that, due to the cold and lack of oxygen, they wear metal clothes for protection. They show Starman what had happened to the JSA back on Earth and how Hitler had had the members rocketed to different planets. The metal men then tell him that they are doomed because some mysterious force is eating the planet. Starman flies out to investigate and is attacked as he flies over the mysterious red spot on the planet, which is the source of the problem. Starman then builds a giant \\"gravity rod\\" and uses it to fling the dangerous foreign matter into space. In gratitude, the men of Jupiter give Starman books that tell how to treat metal so it can be woven into cloth, or made transparent as glass or entirely invisible! Starman then uses the force of the giant gravity rod to propel his ship back to Earth. *In All-Star Comics #55 Jupiter was the first planet to be invaded by a race of green-headed aliens, who threatened to destroy the Jovians unless they assisted them in conquering the Solar System's other planets. Earth is the last planet left. The JSA travel to Jupiter, and are able to finally defeat the Invaders. The Jovians are 10 ft tall and telepathic. *As a boy, Clark Kent meets an eight-armed inhabitant of Jupiter publicly promoting an \\"Interplanetary Circus\\" (Adventure Comics #198, Mar 1954: \\"The Super-Carnival from Space\\"). *In Marvel Family #5 Jupiter is shown to be inhabited by a race of cavepeople, with dinosaur-like creatures also on the world. They go to rescue astronauts whose spaceship is stuck there. They civilise the inhabitants, giving them fire, the wheel, knowledge of the production of iron, and the alphabet. The ship is fixed and the Marvels leave the world, delighted at doing in one day what took thousands of years on Earth. *In Marvel Family #36 the Marvels go to Jupiter, which according to this story has gravity 300 times stronger than Earth (it actually has gravity nearly 2.3 times stronger). The Jovians resemble very short, stout humans. They are an advanced race, capable of interplanetary travel, and their scientific equipment helps the Marvels discover the nature of the Invaders from Infinity, which resemble giant fireballs, (see List of Marvel Family enemies). The Jovians are forced to evacuate after their fleet is defeated by the Invaders, but after the Invaders are contained and destroyed they get back to Jupiter, and tell the Marvels they will be their friends. They know of the Martians, calling them a treacherous race. *In the manga and anime series Sailor Moon, released in 1992, Jupiter was inhabited in the Silver Millennium, but towards the end of the Millennium when Queen Beryl attacked, the planet suffered a massive gravitational upheaval, destroying most of the planet's surface, reducing it to the size (if any) of the modern Jupiter's core. The planet's guardian is Makoto Kino, also known as Sailor Jupiter, whose powers are based on either electricity or plants. *In the Tommy Tomorrow series of stories, Jupiter and the outer planets are giant worlds with solid surfaces and native life. *In the manga/anime Martian Successor Nadesico, the antagonist faction is the \\"Jovian Lizards\\", prisoners sent from Earth to colonize a Jovian station and rebelled themselves against the Earth, sending robotic fleets against human-colonized planets.

Clarke's Space Odyssey series, Jupiter is a major location. For the first story in the series, 2001: A Space Odyssey, the novel and film differ. In the novel, the spaceship Discovery One is travelling to Saturn, and flies close to Jupiter to accelerate via the \\"gravitational slingshot\\" effect. The movie 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), simplifies the scenario, where Jupiter is the intended final destination, not a passing point. The sequel novel 2010: Odyssey Two takes place in the Jovian system: the core of the planet is discovered to be made of solid diamond (which is important to the plot of the two subsequent novels) and Jupiter is renamed Lucifer after being transformed into a star, by fictional technology employed by the alien Monolith (see also TV/Films). The Jupiter system is also the theater of much action in 2061: Odyssey Three and 3001: The Final Odyssey. * The Jovian system is an important location in The Night's Dawn Trilogy (1996-1999) by Peter F. Hamilton. This is where the first Bitek habitat was germinated and Edenism began. * The Golden Age trilogy (2002–3) by John C. Wright. Jupiter has been ignited to form a second miniature sun.

The comet darts through Jupiter, creating a large hole, and causing the planet to implode.\\"Sephiroths Super Nova\\" * In the video game Descent, many levels take place in the Jovian system. Other mentions of Jupiter Written works * In Jules Verne's Hector Servadac (Off On A Comet (1877)), the comet Gallia approaches Jupiter at its aphelion, and the protagonists worry \\"that the comet, being irresistibly attracted, might be drawn on to the very surface of the planet, and there annihilated\\".Off on a Comet, by Jules Verne; Book II Jupiter Somewhat Close Page 1 at www.pagebypagebooks.com *In C. S. Lewis's novel That Hideous Strength (1945), Glund, the Oyarsa of Jupiter, is the last of the five major Oyéresu to descend upon St. Anne's.

Comics and manga  * In the Dragon Ball manga, Bulma and Mr. Popo reach Jupiter in less than a minute using Kami's spaceship, which they needed to reach the Planet Namek, which was impossible to reach with the technology available at that moment in the series. One month later Bulma's father completes a spaceship model capable of making the journey. * In the Marvel Comics title Guardians of the Galaxy, Charlie-27 is the last survivor of an Earth colony on Jupiter in the 31st century. His people were engineered to have 11 times the mass of an average human to withstand the higher gravity of Jupiter. The Jovians lived on giant anti-gravity ships in Jupiter's atmosphere before it was devastated by the Treen during their invasion of the Solar System, although Charlie escaped using a teleportation tube after he returned from a space mission. The Solar System is finally freed from the Badoon. *In Planet Comics the stories of Auro, Lord of Jupiter, took place on Jupiter. A couple's ship crashed during the late 21st century and the child was raised by a sabre-tooth tiger.

He gains telepathic powers and a reptilian appearance.  Films and television  * In the series Red Dwarf, the titular ship belongs to the Jupiter Mining Corporation, and there are many references to Jupiter and its moons (for example Arnold Rimmer is originally from Io). * In the television series Babylon 5, in the third-season episode \\"Message from Earth\\", a Shadow vessel was excavated from Ganymede and was subsequently activated by merging the ship with a human. The ship - because its human core was \\"unprepared\\" - was \\"insane\\" and thus was unable to function at full capacity. The Whitestar took advantage of this and tricked the ship into pursuing the Whitestar deep into Jupiter's atmosphere. The Whitestar outmaneuvered the Shadow ship and was able to escape while the latter plunged deeper into the atmosphere and was subsequently crushed by the pressure and the terrible winds. Later on, to escape an Earthforce vessel, the Whitestar opened a jumppoint inside Jupiter's atmosphere. Lennier described the effect of doing so as \\"explosive\\". * In Men in Black, Agent J mentions he used to think one of his teachers was from Venus, to which Agent K informs him that that person is actually from one of Jupiter's moons. * In the series Stargate SG-1, in the episode titled, \\"2010\\", the Aschen intend to turn Jupiter into a second sun. Note that the titles of the two episodes in which the Aschen appear (2010 and 2001, in the order that the two episodes aired) make clear that this is indeed a reference to the seminal Space Odyssey series by Arthur C. Clarke. * The 2015 film Jupiter Ascending features a protagonist named for the planet, while the film's main antagonist operates from a massive fortress and youth serum production facility deep within the Great Red Spot. Animation * In the anime Gunbuster (1988), Jupiter is used to create the Black Hole Bomb, a massive weapon larger than a small planet, and capable of destroying part of a galaxy. (In fact, a Jupiter-mass black hole would be barely 6 m across, and no more of a threat to the Galaxy than it is right now) * In the TV show Futurama the planet is revealed to smell like strawberries, an out-of-order monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey is in orbit around it, and Amy mentions Jupiter State University. * On an episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Shake sells Meatwad to a circus run by Randy the Astonishing, the Prince of Jupiter sent to infiltrate the human gene pool and enslave the planet. * In the anime Heroic Age, Jupiter is destroyed when a high-powered energy gun is used to knock the moon Io out of orbit. Io plummets into the atmosphere and ignites it, and intervention by the Silver and Bronze fleets leads to a cataclysmic explosion. * In the Martian Successor Nadesico Anime Series created by Kia Asamiya, the evil race known as the 'Jovian Lizards' were claimed to be from Jupiter. Late in the series, it is discovered that the Jovians are humans exiled from Mars, returned to take revenge upon Earth, and the people that exiled them. * In the anime The King of Braves GaoGaiGar, Jupiter is the source of the mysterious energy called The Power, which is a mysterious, highly unstable energy with tremendous energizing and destructive potential. It is known to restore fossilized material, generate time-space wormholes, temporarily restore damaged computer programs, preserve human souls and provide nearly unlimited practical energy. *A component critical to the construction of genuine GN Drives, the semi-perpetual generators designed by Aeolia Schenberg for Celestial Being's Gundam mobile suits in Gundam 00, can only be manufactured in Jupiter's gaseous upper atmosphere.

It was released in November 1967 on Mainstream Records (stereo S/6104, mono 56104). The Amboy Dukes interested a record label that primarily produced jazz albums. Ted Nugent assembled a new band of local Detroit players to secure a recording contract with them. He immediately brought in the soulful baritone voice of John (J.B.) Drake as lead vocalist. He had a long history with Drake in a local band called The Lourds. Nugent and Drake then recruited the remaining players. Steve Farmer was known as a rhythm guitarist, lyricist, composer and vocalist and was a natural fit with Nugent. He came from a local group called The Gang. Dave Palmer was a drummer and percussionist with experience in two local bands, The Galaxy Five and The Citations. Bill White played bass guitar and Rick Lober was an eclectic keyboardist rounding out the new group. The album featured seven group composed originals with six of them composed by the emerging songwriting team of Nugent & Farmer. This album features a soulful, bluesy, psychedelic garage sound throughout. Included was their first single \\"Baby, Please Don't Go\\", a cover of a delta blues song by Big Joe Williams which charted. Also included were a cover from The Coasters along with covers of British groups Cream and The Who that were added for good measure. The intense debut album charted and was a great initial showing for a new rock group on a jazz label. A remastered CD reissue was released in 1992 by Mainstream Direct Ltd, with one bonus track (MDCD 910). Track listing Personnel The Amboy Dukes *John (J.B.)

The band emerged from the experimental post- punk scene of the early 1980s and, along with other groups such as Throbbing Gristle, Coil, Einstürzende Neubauten, and In the Nursery, greatly contributed to the development of industrial music in the UK. Still active 30 years later, Attrition have been a stanchion of darkwave and industrial music, influencing many younger bands in the genres while continuously fine tuning their own distinctive sound. History Beginnings In 1979, Martin started a xeroxed fanzine called Alternative Sounds to document the Coventry music scene (including such notables as The Specials and Furious Apples). The fanzine ran for 18 issues until 1981, and culminated in a vinyl compilation, \\"Sent from Coventry\\" (on Cherry Red) and a brief appearance on the BBC's Something Else programme. During this time, Martin met Julia at a local gig and, with the addition of Martin's brother Chris on guitar, Attrition was formed. In 1980 Chris was replaced by Julia's brother Ashley Niblock on synthesizer, and a short time later they replaced their live drummer with a drum machine; these changes facilitated Attrition's development beyond the post-punk of the early 80s into more experimental veins of sound. 1980s Influenced by punk's do-it-yourself aesthetic, Attrition took part in the emerging cassette culture, contributing multiple early tracks to underground cassette compilations and fanzines alongside contemporaries such as Portion Control, Konstruktivits, Chris & Cosey, The Legendary Pink Dots, Nurse with Wound, and Coil. Attrition's first album release came in the form of Death House, a cassette of two experimental electronic soundtracks inspired by zombie films. In 1983, Attrition received their first exposure in the national music press through a review by Dave Henderson in his \\"Wild Planet\\" column in Sounds, which led to their \\"Dreamsleep\\" track appearing on Henderson's compilation The Elephant Table Album, the band's first vinyl appearance. A postal collaboration with Seattle-based improvisational collective Audio Leter led to Attrition's second cassette album release, Action and Reaction. Attrition's first London concert followed, with a supporting slot from Coil, and the first European tour in April 1984 with the Legendary Pink Dots. The debut album The Attrition of Reason appeared on Third Mind Records in autumn of 1984. The next year, Julia left the band to join the Legendary Pink Dots, and Bowes returned with new band members Marianne, Alex Novak, and Pete Morris to release the second proper Attrition album, Smiling, at the Hypogonder Club, which was generally well received. The following year, however, this lineup dissolved and Bowes released In The Realm of the Hungry Ghosts, a collection of rarities, compilation tracks, and B-sides from the preceding few years. This was the last release on Third Mind. The band then switched to Belgium's Antler-Subway Records for the release of At the Fiftieth Gate in 1988, which saw the addition of guitarist Gary Cox. 1990s After a short hiatus, Bowes began work on music once more and Julia rejoined Attrition in 1990. A compilation of songs from previous releases was released by Projekt Records in the US, introducing Attrition to US audiences. \\"A Tricky Business\\" was released in 1991 on Italy's Contempo Records and marked a new era for the band. These US releases were complemented with European editions on German labels Hyperium and Trisol. The Hidden Agenda came out in 1993, followed by Ephemera in 1995, which mirrored the dark ambient nature of early album Death House. 1996 saw the release of 3 Arms And A Dead Cert, which showed an increased use of organic instruments, including orchestral elements. This album also was the first proper release on Projekt, a relationship that would continue for many years and would see the release of a succession of albums during the '90s that saw progressed development of Attrition's signature sound. Also in 1996 the band toured the US for the first time, at the culmination of which Julia left the band once more. The following year, Bowes revisited various works from the past decade of Attrition music and recorded new classical string variations of the songs, releasing them as Etude. After heavy touring in the late 1990s, including a stop at Wave-Gotik-Treffen, Attrition released The Jeopardy Maze in 1999. 2000s Five years passed between The Jeopardy Maze and the next Attrition album, Dante's Kitchen, released in 2004. During the interim a remix album and a rarities album were put out and the entire back catalog of Attrition was reissued on CD in Europe and the band focused on touring and playing live again. Attrition finally founded their own label, Two Gods, in 2006 and released Tearing Arms from Deities, a 25th anniversary collection of material spanning Attrition's career, and Something Stirs - The Beginning, a collection of many of their cassette compilation tracks from the early 1980s. Two Gods would serve as a vehicle for releasing remastered reissues of the entire Attrition back catalogue in the following years. It has also served as a label for releases from other bands, including Rossetti's Compass. In June 2008 Attrition once more became a multi-member act with the addition of female vocalist Sin D'rella. Bowes and Sin then released the twelfth album proper for the band, All Mine Enemys Whispers - The Story of Mary Ann Cotton, a concept album built around the true story of a mid-19th century serial killer in England, the arresting officer of whom Bowes is a descendant. The album bears a marked departure from what has come to be seen as the signature Attrition sound, ditching prominent synthesizer base lines, percussion, and vocals for atmospheric, ambient, and found sounds. Guests on the album include Emilie Autumn, Erica Mulkey, and Bowes' own two children. 2009 has seen the release of a live album, Kill the Buddha!, that celebrates 25 years of live touring, and Wrapped in the guise of my friend, an album of Attrition songs covered by other bands. 2012 and Martin has worked with his wife Kerri on their first full-length movie score, Invocation. Martin taught music technology at City College in Coventry for many years and left in 2011 to work full-time on mastering and production for Attrition and other artists in his studio The Cage. http://www.thecagestudios.co.uk 2013\\\\. The Unraveller of Angels... 2015\\\\. Millions of the Mouthless Dead... and album Martin made with Anni Hogan (of Marc and the Mambas fame)... exploring First World War poetry set to dark ambient scores... includes a guest appearance from Wolfgang Flur (ex- Kraftwerk) Musical influences and characteristics Martin Bowes has cited a wide variety of influences on his music, including experimental rock, punk, post-punk, and industrial groups such as The Velvet Underground, Crass, the Sex Pistols, Magazine, Joy Division, and Cabaret Voltaire, early experimental electronic groups like Kraftwerk, classic rock'n'roll (Elvis), and even Beethoven. In the early 1980s, Attrition was grouped into the post-punk movement, and as post-punk birthed subgenres and cross-pollinated with others, the band came to be seen as an early and influential part of the fledgling industrial and darkwave genres. Later on they would also gain a considerable following among the goth scene. By the early 90s Bowes had become the primary member and songwriter and Attrition had developed its own distinctive electro- acoustic sound. This was based on Martin's deep growl, Julia's fretless bass work and breathy sub-operatic vocals, and a backline of electronic instrumentation, comprising analogue synthesizers (including a Korg Mono/Poly and Korg MS-20), sequencer (Roland MC-202), drum machine (Roland TR-808), and various effects units. \\"At first, there wasn't the same sort of scene and we were in more of an 'industrial' thing. There was nothing like the clubs you get now, it was actually quite difficult to play anywhere that would appreciate you. It's a lot easier now, it's not just Goth, it's a mix - Darkwave or whatever. That's gotten stronger, so that has helped, but really, we were there before it was built.\\" Discography (selected; a full discography can be obtained from the official website -- see links below) Albums * (1982) Death House * (1983) Action and Reaction (a collaboration with Audio Leter) * (1984) The Attrition of Reason * (1985) Smiling, at The Hypogonder Club * (1988) At the Fiftieth Gate * (1991) A Tricky Business * (1993) The Hidden Agenda * (1995) Ephemera * (1996) 3 Arms and a Dead Cert * (1997) Etude (early works performed by a chamber orchestra) * (1999) The Jeopardy Maze * (2003) The Eternity LP (more classical works) * (2004) Dante's Kitchen * (2008) All Mine Enemys Whispers - The story of Mary Ann Cotton * (2012) Invocation - a film score * (2013) The Unraveller of Angels * (2015) Millions of The Mouthless Dead Compilation albums * (1986) In the Realm of the Hungry Ghosts (a compilation of remixed early material) * (1990) Recollection: 84-89 * (2000) The Hand that Feeds - the remixes * (2000) Esoteria (1982–1999, a collection of ambient works) * (2001) Keepsakes And Reflections (B-sides and rarities) * (2006) Something Stirs - the beginning (1981–83) * (2006) Tearing Arms from Deities (25 year anniversary collection of rare, remastered and remixed material) * (2010) Wrapped in the guise of my friend - the tribute album * (2010) Dreamtime Collectors: 1980–2010 (The Best of Collection) * (2011) Demonstro =: 1981–86 * (2014) In Dark Dreams: 1980-2015 Live albums * (1985) Terminal Kaleidoscope (split with Legendary Pink Dots) * (2000) Heretic Angels - Live in the USA. 1999 * (2008) Across the divide - Live in Holland. 1984 * (2009) Kill the Buddha! - Live on the 25 year anniversary tour * (2011) The Truth In Dark Corners - Live in the Netherlands. 1985 * (2016) Live at Club Neutral - Toronto 06/06/2010 * (2018) Live in Wellington.

Nansō Satomi Hakkenden (; ) is a Japanese epic novel in 106 volumes by Kyokutei Bakin. The volumes were written and published over a period of nearly thirty years (1814–42). Bakin had gone blind before finishing the tale, and he dictated the final parts to his daughter-in-law Michi. The title has been translated as The Eight Dog Chronicles, Tale of Eight Dogs, or Biographies of Eight Dogs. Plot and influences Yang Lin, a hero from the Chinese epic novel Water Margin or Suikoden in Japanese, from Utagawa Kuniyoshi's series of woodblock prints, 108 Heroes of the Suikoden. Set in the tumultuous Sengoku period (350 years before Bakin lived), Hakkenden is the story of eight samurai half-brothers — all of them descended from a dog and bearing the word \\"dog\\" in their surnames — and their adventures, with themes of loyalty and family honor, as well as Confucianism, bushido and Buddhist philosophy. One of the direct inspiration sources of the novel is the fourteenth to seventeenth-century Chinese epic novel Water Margin by Shi Nai'an. Japanese translations date back to at least 1757, when the first volume of an early Suikoden (Water Margin in Japanese) was printed.Shirane and Brandon, Early Modern Japanese Literature, p564. Bakin dramatically increased his popularity and fame with the novel Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki (Strange Tales of the Crescent Moon , 椿説弓張月) which he began publishing in 1807, helped by Hokusai's imaginative and powerful illustrations. However, due to the difference of opinion on the illustration, the collaboration ended with seven works. For Hakkenden, Hokusai's son-in-law, Yanagawa Shigenobu was employed as illustrator instead. A complete reprinting in ten volumes is available in the original Japanese, as well as various modern Japanese translations, most of them abridged. Previously, only a few chapters had been translated into English, Chapter 25 by Donald Keene and Chapters 12, 13, and 19 by Chris Drake. A full translation is currently in progress and is available on the Internet. History of reception Hugely popular at the time of publication and into the early twentieth century, Bakin's work lost favor after the Meiji Restoration, but came back into fashion later in the twentieth century. In live-action film and TV there have been numerous adaptions: the first in 1938, then a series in the 1950s, and since the influential TV series Shin Hakkenden (:ja:新八犬伝) from the early 1970s, every decade has had either a live-action adaptation or a show significantly influenced by the novel, right up through the 2010s. The novel has also been adapted into kabuki theatre several times. In August 2006, the Kabuki-za put on the play. In 1959, the TOEI motion picture company made Satomi hakken-den. In 1983, the novel was loosely adapted into the film Legend of the Eight Samurai. Hakkenden has had a strong influence on modern manga and anime works, particularly those based on adventure quests. For example, it influenced Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball (1984) and Rumiko Takahashi's Inuyasha (1996), which both have plots about the collection of magical crystals or crystal balls.

His parents were Charles and Nellie, immigrants from England and Ireland, respectively. Head had two brothers, Charles and Daniel. Education Both Head and his brothers solely attended Catholic parochial schools to receive their educations. Head earned a mathematics degree from Columbia University prior to entering St. Joseph's Seminary at Dunwoodie in 1939. Through his studies at St. Joseph's Seminary, he was later ordained a priest in 1945. During his time in ministry at the Archdiocese of New York, Head earned a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work in 1948. Ministry Head was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of New York on January 27, 1945 by Cardinal Francis Spellman in St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan, New York City. Head served in many capacities, including as an educator, prior to being appointed auxiliary bishop. Head taught sociology at Notre Dame College on Staten Island before serving as assistant pastor at both Sacred Heart Church in the Bronx and St. Roch's Church on Staten Island. In September 1947, Head became a staff member of the Archdiocese of New York Catholic Charities Family Service Department. He was an assistant pastor at St. Veronica's Church in Greenwich Village, New York City for 17 years while he worked at Catholic Charities. Head was named associate director of Family Services in March 1948, serving in that capacity until he became director of social research for Catholic Charities in 1956. In 1964, Head went to minister at St. Monica's Church in Manhattan; and became a parochial assistant at St. Patrick's Cathedral in 1967. On October 15, 1966, Head was appointed executive director and secretary of Catholic Charities by Cardinal Terence Cooke. In these capacities in the organization, Head oversaw nearly 1,000 employees, and administrated an annual budget of millions of dollars. Episcopal career Auxiliary Bishop of New York On March 19, 1970, Head was consecrated an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of New York. He was also the Titular Bishop of Ard Sratha. Head served, among other assignments, as executive director of Catholic Charities in the Archdiocese of New York. Bishop of Buffalo On January 23, 1973, Head was named as the 11th Bishop of Buffalo by Pope Paul VI; and he was installed on March 19, 1973. Fundraising for Catholic Charities increased by an extreme degree under Head's leadership in the Diocese, including the year of his retirement. Head was involved in many activities as Bishop of Buffalo. Under his leadership, many institutes and offices were created in the Diocese. Many of these endeavors include the Religious Education Coordinators Council; the Priests' Retirement Board; the Center for Church Vocations; the Western New York Catholic Hospital Health Care Council; the Peace and Justice Commission; the Office of Vicar for Religious; and the Permanent Diaconate Program. Additional efforts included the Office of Vicar for Campus Ministry; the Organist Enrichment Program; the Diocesan Marian Commission; the Office of Vicar for the Central City; Daybreak Productions; the Catholic Charities Parish Outreach Program; the Little Portion Friary; the Pope John Paul II Residence; the Agenda for the 80's; the Diocesan Radio Studio; and the Lay Ministry Advisory Board. Further endeavors created and/or supervised by Head included the consolidation of the Catholic Education Department; the Renew Program; the Office of Church Ministry; the relocation and consolidation of Diocesan Offices in the Catholic Center; the Office of Black Ministry; the Hispanic Apostolate; the Commission on Women in the Church and Society; the Department of Pro-Life Activities; the New Visions Commission for Pastoral Planning; the reorganization of 10 Central City parishes; and others. In 1995, upon celebrating the 50th anniversary of his ordination, Head reflected on his appointment as Bishop of Buffalo. Head ordained 124 men to the priesthood during his time as Bishop of Buffalo. It has been estimated that Head confirmed 50,000 young people to the Roman Catholic Church during his 22 years of service in Buffalo.Funeral mass held for Bishop Head, WBFO 88.7: Buffalo's NPR News Station, Buffalo, NY, 5 April 2005, Buckley, E., Retrieved 3 January 2014. Honors Pope John XXIII honored Head in July 1962 by naming him a papal chamberlain. In May 1966, Head was given the title of domestic prelate by Pope Paul VI. Prior to his death, Head was honored with a retirement home for priests that was named for him, the Bishop Edward D. Head Residence, in Lackawanna, New York. Retirement and later life Pope John Paul II accepted Head's petition to retire in April 1995. Church law required him to retire at age 75; and he was named Bishop Emeritus. Even though he was retired, he continued to play an active role in the Diocese of Buffalo throughout the 1990s and into early part of the next decade. He continued to be active in health care ministry, and other ministries throughout his retirement. Head died on March 29, 2005 in Kenmore, New York, at the age of 85. Head's body is buried in the crypt of St. Joseph Cathedral in Buffalo. He is the first Bishop of Buffalo to have retired in Buffalo.

Usually danced as a group of boys and girls, all dressed in more (the Tahitian grass skirt, however not made of grass but of the fibers from the bark of the pūrau (hibiscus)). The boys shake their knees (as scissors, from there the use of the word pāoti (scissors) for this movement), and the girls shake their hips (and their long, loose hairs, if they have them). In reality the movement of their knees is the engine which drives their hips. Their feet should stay flat on the ground and their shoulders should remain stationary. However traditionally in the Ote'a or Ura Pa'u, the hips in Tahiti are shaken round and round (in what is known as the fa'arapu) while in the Cook Islands the hips are in a side to side movement. But due to the tamure, this emphasis is less important. The movements of the hands is of secondary importance. The girls are largely standing still, the boys move around their partner, either facing her in front or hiding behind her back (as seen from the public). The tempo of the music is continuously increased up to the point where only the most experienced and fittest dancers can keep their shakings up. Depending on the performers, the sexual innuendo may be more or less obvious. The predecessor of the tāmūrē, the traditional upaupa was outlawed by the LMS missionaries for that reason. Tāmūrē is a foreign word, the name of a fish in the Tuamotu, the real name of the dance is ori Tahiti (Tahitian dance). Shortly after the Second World War a soldier of the Pacific battalion, Louis Martin, wrote a song on a classic rhythm in which he used the word tāmūrē quite often as a tra-la-la. He afterwards was known as Tāmūrē Martin, and a new genre was born.

They are used primarily in pest control as an alternative to chlorinated hydrocarbons that persist in the environment. Some organophosphorus compounds are highly effective insecticides, although some are extremely toxic to humans, including sarin and VX nerve agents. Organophosphorus chemistry is the corresponding science of the properties and reactivity of organophosphorus compounds. Phosphorus, like nitrogen, is in group 15 of the periodic table, and thus phosphorus compounds and nitrogen compounds have many similar properties.Dillon, K. B.; Mathey, F.; Nixon, J. F. (1997) Phosphorus. The Carbon Copy; John Wiley & Sons, Quin, L. D. (2000) A Guide to Organophosphorus Chemistry; John Wiley & Sons, Racke, K.D. (1992). \\"Degradation of organophosphorus insecticides in environmental matrices\\", pp. 47–73 in: Chambers, J.E., Levi, P.E. (eds.), Organophosphates: Chemistry, Fate, and Effects. Academic Press, San Diego, . The definition of organophosphorus compounds is variable, which can lead to confusion. In industrial and environmental chemistry, an organophosphorus compound need contain only an organic substituent, but need not have a direct phosphorus-carbon (P-C) bond. Thus a large proportion of pesticides (e.g., malathion), are often included in this class of compounds. Phosphorus can adopt a variety of oxidation states, and it is general to classify organophosphorus compounds based on their being derivatives of phosphorus(V) vs phosphorus(III), which are the predominant classes of compounds. In a descriptive but only intermittently used nomenclature, phosphorus compounds are identified by their coordination number σ and their valency λ. In this system, a phosphine is a σ3λ3 compound. Organophosphorus(V) compounds, main categories Phosphate esters and amides Phosphate esters have the general structure P(=O)(OR)3 feature P(V). Such species are of technological importance as flame retardant agents, and plasticizers. Lacking a P−C bond, these compounds are in the technical sense not organophosphorus compounds but esters of phosphoric acid. Many derivatives are found in nature, such as phosphatidylcholine. Phosphate ester are synthesized by alcoholysis of phosphorus oxychloride. A variety of mixed amido-alkoxo derivatives are known, one medically significant example being the anti-cancer drug cyclophosphamide. Also derivatives containing the thiophosphoryl group (P=S) include the pesticide malathion. The organophosphates prepared on the largest scale are the zinc dithiophosphates, as additives for motor oil. Several million kilograms of this coordination complex are produced annually by the reaction of phosphorus pentasulfide with alcohols. :Illustrative organophosphates and related compounds: phosphatidylcholine, triphenylphosphate, cyclophosphamide, parathion, and zinc dithiophosphate. In the environment, these compounds break down via hydrolysis to eventually afford phosphate and the organic alcohol or amine from which they are derived. Phosphonic and phosphinic acids and their esters Phosphonates are esters of phosphonic acid and have the general formula RP(=O)(OR')2. Phosphonates have many technical applications, a well-known member being glyphosate, better known as Roundup. With the formula (HO)2P(O)CH2NHCH2CO2H, this derivative of glycine is one of the most widely used herbicides. Bisphosphonates are a class of drugs to treat osteoporosis. The nerve gas agent sarin, containing both C–P and F–P bonds, is a phosphonate. Phosphinates feature two P–C bonds, with the general formula R2P(=O)(OR'). A commercially significant member is the herbicide Glufosinate. Similar to glyphosate mentioned above, it has the structure CH3P(O)(OH)CH2CH2CH(NH2)CO2H. :Illustrative examples of phosphonates and phosphinates in the order shown: Sarin (phosphonate), Glyphosate (phosphonate), fosfomycin (phosphonate), zoledronic acid (phosphonate), and Glufosinate (phosphinate). In aqueous solution, phosphonic acids ionize to give the corresponding organophosphonates. The Michaelis–Arbuzov reaction is the main method for the synthesis of these compounds. For example, dimethylmethylphosphonate (see figure above) arises from the rearrangement of trimethylphosphite, which is catalyzed by methyl iodide. In the Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction and the Seyferth–Gilbert homologation, phosphonates are used in reactions with carbonyl compounds. The Kabachnik–Fields reaction is a method for the preparation of aminophosphonates. These compounds contain a very inert bond between phosphorus and carbon. Consequently, they hydrolyze to give phosphonic and phosphinic acid derivatives, but not phosphate. Phosphine oxides, imides, and chalcogenides Phosphine oxides (designation σ4λ5) have the general structure R3P=O with formal oxidation state V. Phosphine oxides form hydrogen bonds and some are therefore soluble in water. The P=O bond is very polar with a dipole moment of 4.51 D for triphenylphosphine oxide. Compounds related to phosphine oxides include phosphine imides (R3PNR') and related chalcogenides (R3PE, where E = S, Se, Te). These compounds are some of the most thermally stable organophosphorus compounds. Phosphonium salts and phosphoranes Compounds with the formula [PR4+]X− comprise the phosphonium salts. These species are tetrahedral phosphorus(V) compounds. From the commercial perspective, the most important member is tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride, [P(CH2OH)4]Cl, which is used as a fire retardant in textiles. Approximately 2M kg are produced annually of the chloride and the related sulfate. They are generated by the reaction of phosphine with formaldehyde in the presence of the mineral acid: :PH3 \\\\+ HX + 4 CH2O → [P(CH2OH)4+]X− A variety of phosphonium salts can be prepared by alkylation and arylation of organophosphines: :PR3 \\\\+ R'X → [PR3R'+]X− The methylation of triphenylphosphine is the first step in the preparation of the Wittig reagent. :Illustrative phosphorus(V) compounds: the phosphonium ion P(CH2OH)4+, two resonance structures for the Wittig reagent Ph3PCH2, and pentaphenylphosphorane, a rare pentaorganophophorus compound. The parent phosphorane (σ5λ5) is PH5, which is unknown. Related compounds containing both halide and organic substituents on phosphorus are fairly common. Those with five organic substituents are rare, although P(C6H5)5 is known, being derived from P(C6H5)4+ by reaction with phenyllithium. Phosphorus ylides are unsaturated phosphoranes, known as Wittig reagents, e.g. CH2P(C6H5)3. These compounds feature tetrahedral phosphorus(V) and are considered relatives of phosphine oxides. They also are derived from phosphonium salts, but by deprotonation not alkylation. Organophosphorus(III) compounds, main categories  Phosphites, phosphonites, and phosphinites Phosphites, sometimes called phosphite esters, have the general structure P(OR)3 with oxidation state +3. Such species arise from the alcoholysis of phosphorus trichloride: :PCl3 \\\\+ 3 ROH → P(OR)3 \\\\+ 3 HCl The reaction is general, thus a vast number of such species are known. Phosphites are employed in the Perkow reaction and the Michaelis–Arbuzov reaction. They also serve as ligands in organometallic chemistry. Intermediate between phosphites and phosphines are phosphonites (P(OR)2R') and phosphinite (P(OR)R'2). Such species arise via alcoholysis reactions of the corresponding phosphinous and phosphonous chlorides ((PClR'2) and PCl2R', respectively). Phosphines The parent compound of the phosphines is PH3, called phosphine in the US and British Commonwealth, but phosphane elsewhere. Replacement of one or more hydrogen centers by an organic substituents (alkyl, aryl), gives PH3−xRx, an organophosphine, generally referred to as phosphines. :diphosphine used in homogeneous catalysis, the primary phosphine PhPH2, and the phosphorus(I) compound (PPh)5. =Comparison of phosphines and amines= The phosphorus atom in phosphines has a formal oxidation state −3 (σ3λ3) and are the phosphorus analogues of amines. Like amines, phosphines have a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry although often with smaller C-E-C angles (E = N, P), at least in the absence of steric effects. The C-P-C bond angle is 98.6° for trimethylphosphine increasing to 109.7° when the methyl groups are replaced by tert-butyl groups. When used as ligands, the steric bulk of tertiary phosphines is evaluated by their cone angle. The barrier to pyramidal inversion is also much higher than nitrogen inversion to occur, and therefore phosphines with three different substituents can be resolved into thermally stable optical isomers. Phosphines are often less basic than corresponding amines, for instance the phosphonium ion itself has a pKa of −14 compared to 9.21 for the ammonium ion; trimethylphosphonium has a pKa of 8.65 compared to 9.76 for trimethylammonium. However, triphenylphosphine (pKa 2.73) is more basic than triphenylamine (pKa −5), mainly because the lone pair of the nitrogen in NPh3 is partially delocalized into the three phenyl rings. Whereas the lone pair on nitrogen is delocalized in pyrrole, the lone pair on phosphorus atom in the phosphorus equivalent of pyrrole (phosphole) is not. The reactivity of phosphines matches that of amines with regard to nucleophilicity in the formation of phosphonium salts with the general structure PR4+X−. This property is used in the Appel reaction for converting alcohols to alkyl halides. Phosphines are easily oxidized to the corresponding phosphine oxides, whereas amine oxides are less readily generated. In part for this reason, phosphines are very rarely encountered in nature. =Synthetic routes= From the commercial perspective, the most important phosphine is triphenylphosphine, several million kilograms being produced annually. It is prepared from the reaction of chlorobenzene, PCl3, and sodium. Phosphines of a more specialized nature are usually prepared by other routes. Phosphorus halides undergo Nucleophilic displacement by organometallic reagents such as Grignard reagents. Conversely, some syntheses entail nucleophilic displacement of phosphide anion equivalents (\\"R2P−\\") by aryl- and alkyl halides. Primary (RPH2) and secondary phosphines (RRPH and R2PH) add to alkenes in presence of a strong base (e.g., KOH in DMSO). Markovnikov's rules apply. Similar reactions occur involving alkynes. Base is not required for electron-deficient alkenes (e.g., derivatives of acrylonitrile) and alkynes. :Scheme 1. Addition of phosphine and phosphines to alkenes and alkynes Under free-radical conditions the P-H bonds of primary and secondary phosphines add across alkenes. Such reactions proceed with anti-Markovnikov regiochemistry. AIBN or organic peroxides are used as initiators. Tertiary phosphine oxides and sulfides can be reduced with chlorosilanes and other reagents. =Reactions= Organophosphines are nucleophiles and ligands. Two major applications are as reagents in the Wittig reaction and as supporting phosphine ligands in homogeneous catalysis. Their nucleophilicity is evidenced by their reactions with alkyl halides to give phosphonium salts. Phosphines are nucleophilic catalysts in organic synthesis, e.g. the Rauhut–Currier reaction and Baylis-Hillman reaction. Phosphines are reducing agents, as illustrated in the Staudinger reduction for the conversion of organic azides to amines and in the Mitsunobu reaction for converting alcohols into esters. In these processes, the phosphine is oxidized to phosphorus(V). Phosphines have also been found to reduce activated carbonyl groups, for instance the reduction of an α-keto ester to an α-hydroxy ester in scheme 2. In the proposed reaction mechanism, the first proton is on loan from the methyl group in trimethylphosphine (triphenylphosphine does not react). :Reduction of activated carbonyl groups by alkyl phosphines =Primary and secondary phosphines= In addition to the other reactions associated with phosphines, those bearing P-H groups exhibit additional reactivity associated with the P-H bonds. They are readily deprotonated using strong bases to give phosphide anions. Primary and secondary phosphines are generally prepared by reduction of related phosphorus halides or esters. For example, phosphonates are reduced to primary phosphines: Example of reduction of phosphonate ester to a primary phosphine. The stability is attributed to conjugation between the aromatic ring and the phosphorus lone pair. Phosphaalkenes and phosphaalkynes Compounds with carbon phosphorus(III) multiple bonds are called phosphaalkenes (R2C=PR) and phosphaalkynes (RC≡P). They are similar in structure, but not in reactivity, to imines (R2C=NR) and nitriles (RC≡N), respectively. In the compound phosphorine, one carbon atom in benzene is replaced by phosphorus. Species of this type are relatively rare but for that reason are of interest to researchers. A general method for the synthesis of phosphaalkenes is by 1,2-elimination of suitable precursors, initiated thermally or by base such as DBU, DABCO, or triethylamine: :Phosphaalkene general method Thermolysis of Me2PH generates CH2=PMe, an unstable species in the condensed phase. Organophosphorus(0), (I), and (II) compounds Compounds where phosphorus exists in a formal oxidation state of less than III are uncommon, but examples are known for each class. Organophosphorus(0) species are debatably illustrated by the carbene adducts, [P(NHC)]2, where NHC is an N-heterocyclic carbene. With the formulae (RP)n and (R2P)2, respectively, compounds of phosphorus(I) and (II) are generated by reduction of the related organophosphorus(III) chlorides: :5 PhPCl2 \\\\+ 5 Mg → (PhP)5 \\\\+ 5 MgCl2 :2 Ph2PCl + Mg → Ph2P-PPh2 \\\\+ MgCl2 Diphosphenes, with the formula R2P2, formally contain phosphorus-phosphorus double bonds. These phosphorus(I) species are rare but are stable provided that the organic substituents are large enough to prevent catenation. Many mixed-valence compounds are known, e.g. the cage P7(CH3)3.

The son of a Latvian Jewish storekeeper, he was born at Kirkwood, South Africa and educated at Grey High School in Port Elizabeth before studying Art at Cape Town University, where he acted with Nigel Hawthorne. He became a commercial artist with J. Walter Thompson in Johannesburg, then transferred to London, where he also worked part-time as a waiter. His interest in royalty began when he was a schoolboy. He saw the King and Queen and the princesses Elizabeth and Margaret at a siding near Kirkwood in 1947, and was bowled over by Queen Elizabeth's charm and skill with the crowd. Some years later, after visiting the mausoleum of Napoleon III at St Michael's Abbey in Farnborough, Hampshire, he decided to write about royal subjects. Grandmama of Europe, his seventh book, is generally regarded as his best. After a change of publisher, he 'was persuaded that dynastic studies were no longer required,' so he began to write studies of the more recent history of the British royal family. (The Times, 20 May 2003) Charming, highly intelligent, well versed in his subjects, he became known as a devoted, if sometimes quizzical, admirer of British royalty. His research included interviewing several members of the royal family, including Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone (about whom he published a biography shortly after her death in 1981), the Queen Mother, and Princess Margaret, as well as numerous courtiers. All were charmed by the small, dapper man who listened respectfully, had a light touch with flattery, yet was not tediously deferential. The author of twenty-three books, he also appeared in several television documentaries. In his last book, a memoir, Royal Subjects, he acknowledged that during his career as a writer, 'various Kings, and their families, have proved to be devilish good subjects for me,' and that being 'something of an outsider, unrestricted by the British class system' (Royal Subjects, pp. ix-x), had proved something of an advantage for him in being granted almost unprecedented access to royal circles. He died from cancer at Frome in Somerset, aged 73.

He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher with the Brooklyn Robins, Boston Braves, New York Giants, Chicago Cubs, New York Yankees, and again with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Although Taylor was not a powerful hitter, he sustained a lengthy career in the major leagues due to his valuable defensive abilities as a catcher. After his playing career, he became better known as the manager for the St. Louis Browns owned by Bill Veeck. His baseball career spanned 58 years. Baseball playing career Taylor in 1941 as manager of the Toledo Mud Hens A native of Yulee, Florida, Taylor began his professional baseball career at the age of 16 with the Valdosta Millionaires during the season. After playing in the minor leagues for five seasons, he made his major league debut with the Brooklyn Robins on June 15, 1920 at the age of 21. He became the Robins' main catcher in 1923, succeeding Hank DeBerry. Although he led National League catchers in errors and in passed balls, he also led in range factor, assists and baserunners caught stealing while batting .288 in 93 games. In 1924, Taylor's batting average improved to .290 and he led the league's catchers in range factor and fielding percentage. Taylor had his best offensive season in 1925, posting career highs with a .310 batting average, 3 home runs and 44 runs batted in. He developed a reputation as one of the best catchers in the National League, finishing the season with 102 assists and leading the league's catchers with 64 baserunners caught stealing. He had a talent for catching the spitball, and became the personal catcher for future Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Burleigh Grimes, the last pitcher allowed to throw the spitball in the major leagues. On October 6, 1925, Taylor was traded by the Robins with Eddie Brown and Jimmy Johnston to the Boston Braves for Jesse Barnes, Gus Felix and Mickey O'Neil. After a season and a half with the Braves, he was traded to John McGraw's New York Giants along with Larry Benton and Herb Thomas for Doc Farrell, Kent Greenfield and Hugh McQuillan. The Giants had acquired Grimes in another trade and wanted Taylor to be his personal catcher. Despite catching Grimes' team-leading 19 wins and performing well defensively to help the Giants finish the season just two games behind the pennant-winning Pittsburgh Pirates, McGraw released Taylor back to the Braves for the waiver price of $4,000 on February 28, 1928, the same day Grimes was traded to Pittsburgh. McGraw said he regretted releasing the 29-year-old Taylor, but that he wanted to give younger catchers such as Shanty Hogan a chance to play. Taylor took over as the Braves' starting catcher for the 1928 season. Having been displaced by Al Spohrer as the Braves' starting catcher early in the 1929 season, Taylor's contract was sold to the Chicago Cubs for the waiver price of $7,500 in July after all the other teams in both the American and National Leagues had passed on him. When the Cubs' future Hall of Fame catcher Gabby Hartnett suffered an arm injury early in 1929, Taylor filled in capably, helping the Cubs win the National League pennant. He helped guide the Cubs' pitching staff to a league-leading 14 shutouts and finish second in team earned run average and strikeouts. In the only postseason appearance of his career in the 1929 World Series against the Philadelphia Athletics, Taylor made only three hits but was cited as an unsung hero in a losing cause for the Cubs because of his consistent, unwavering defensive skills behind the plate. When Hartnett returned from his injury in 1930, Taylor went back to being the Cubs' backup catcher. In 1932, Cub manager Rogers Hornsby credited Taylor with helping develop the skills of Lon Warneke, as the young pitcher led the league with 22 wins. After being released by the Cubs in November 1933, he appeared in four games for the Yankees in 1934 before ending his playing career as a player-coach with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1935. He played his final major league game on September 24, 1935 at the age of 36, and returned to the minor leagues as player-manager for the San Antonio Missions from to and the Toledo Mud Hens from to . Strange incident Taylor is one of the very few players who have illegally re-entered a major league game. It happened on August 31, 1932, against the Giants.http://retrosheet.org/outturn.htm In the bottom of the tenth inning, Billy Jurges pinch hit for Taylor. Three batters later, with two outs, Taylor pinch hit for pitcher Leroy Herrmann. The Giants failed to notice: had they appealed, Herrmann would have been called out for missing his turn and the game would have been over. But Taylor and the next three batters all scored, to win the game for the Cubs. Career statistics In a sixteen-year major league career, Taylor played in 918 games, accumulating 748 hits in 2,865 at bats for a .261 career batting average, along with 9 home runs, 311 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .304. He ended his career with a .977 fielding percentage. Taylor led National League catchers three times in range factor and in baserunners caught stealing, twice in assists and once in fielding percentage. His 49.63% career caught stealing percentage ranks 19th all-time among major league catchers. Managerial and coaching career Taylor joined the St. Louis Browns as a coach in the midseason of 1941, and was a member of the 1944 Browns team that won the American League pennant - the team's only championship in its 52 years in St. Louis, although they eventually lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1944 World Series. When Luke Sewell resigned as manager in 1946, Taylor took over as the interim manager, finished the season, then joined the coaching staff of the 1947 Pittsburgh Pirates. After Muddy Ruel managed the Browns to a last-place, 59–95 record in 1947 campaign, St. Louis general manager Bill DeWitt re-hired Taylor to be the manager. He lost 100 games in two of his five seasons as the manager of the under-funded Browns, and was fired after the 1951 season. Taylor was the St. Louis manager who, upon orders from then-owner Bill Veeck, called on Eddie Gaedel to pinch hit during a game on August 19, against Bob Cain and the Detroit Tigers. He also participated in another Veeck stunt, in which the Browns handed out placards – reading take, swing, bunt, etc. – to fans and allowed them to make managerial decisions for a day. Taylor dutifully surveyed the fans' advice and relayed the sign accordingly. The Browns won the game. Taylor remained active in baseball as a scout for the Chicago White Sox and the Milwaukee and Atlanta Braves until his death. Later life In , Taylor was inducted into the Florida Sports Hall of Fame. He died from a heart attack while at his home on September 19, 1974 at the age of 76.

Gameplay The gameplay moves away from the more tactical aspects present in its predecessors, more like that of Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. The battles have been scaled down as well as making the party size 4 rather than 5 and the battles get a new card-based summoning system. Plot This story starts years after the Great Disaster (the global disasters from Arc the Lad II), on the island of Eteru. Alec, a young man from a small farm town, Sasha Village, aspires to become a Hunter, just like the man who saved him during the Great Disaster. When his village is attacked by bandits, he and his quirky friend Lutz must run to the nearest town, Itio, and hire a Hunter to save the village. On the way to the town, they encounter monsters and realize they get a rush when fighting and also feeling a power within themselves. After the village is saved, Alec decides to leave and become a Hunter; Lutz naturally tags along. To become a Hunter, Alec must collect the Ghost Dream Crystal in a nearby cave. With Lutz's help, Alec finds the crystal and officially becomes a Hunter. After taking enough jobs, Alec and Lutz eventually take on a job that lets them leave Eteru Island. A boat takes them to the next continent, Forestamore. There they meet Theo, a young Cardist who can turn monsters into cards like his mother. He joins them and together they meet Lieza (from Arc the Lad II), who is now running a monster ranch with Paundit. They also encounter Sharon, a woman from the Academy, who can control monsters with a machine. With Lieza's help, the trio rides a Flying Fire to their next destination, North Sularto. Upon landing in North Sularto, they meet a spunky gunslinger named Cheryl. They also take note of how destroyed North Sularto became from the Great Disaster, having landed in a giant junk heap. Making their way to Society Village, a town dedicated to restoring the world, Alec completes his job by delivering a strange orb found back in Forestamore. The trio then heads to Gislem, a notoriously poor and equally dangerous city. It seems the Academy has been kidnapping people and it appears Shu (from Arc the Lad II) is helping. After a failed attempt of the kidnapping of Cheryl, Cheryl joins the party. A path to South Sularto opens up. After taking some jobs in Testa, the group meets Tosh, the protector of the city and its precious Water Orb (Tosh being from Arc the Lad). The Academy steals the Orb from the village and Tosh, shocked from seeing his friend Shu with the enemies, decides to join Alec and crew and get back the Orb. Because of the lack of water in the desert town of Testa, the villagers travel to Gislem, where they temporarily live. Learning that a secret Academy base is hidden in an old airship, the group makes their way inside, only to find it crawling with enemy robots. Halfway through, the group finds Shu, who reveals that he was really trying to infiltrate the Academy's plans. Having taken the Orb, Tosh returns to Testa and Shu joins Alec to get to the bottom of this. After defeating an Academy employee in a giant robot, Shu leaves the group. Afterwards, a new job opens up: Society Village needs to deliver information to the giant library in Jiharta. Taking the job, Alec and his friends take a boat to Jiharta. They quickly learn of an uproar in the Hunter's Guild and investigate: someone has stolen a water controlling scroll from the nearby Amaidar Temple. After speaking to Iga (Arc the Lad character), the party and Marsia, a young spellcaster from the Spell Institute who knows the thief personally, discover the thief, Tikva, is working for the Academy. Alec and his party find the Academy and Tikva at the Romastor, conducting a water controlling experiment with the scroll and some machinery. After the experiment, the Academy members dismiss Tikva, who becomes angry at not being recognized as helpful. Galdo, a spear wielding Academy member previously seen in the secret base, was watching the experiment and now intervenes. Alec and crew attack, surprising Galdo that they can even scratch him. He teleports away and Tikva is taken bake to Amaidar Temple. As punishment, Iga forcesg him to join the temple and become a monk, much to the surprise of everyone. Marsia then decides to join Alec on his adventure. After settling a few jobs in Jiharta, Iga then wish to deliver a letter to his friend named Leshalt in Parute, which makes Alec and crew had to cross the ocean again. In Parute, they came across the main city, Paltos, and learned that an annual tournament's opening ceremony was commencing. The first prize of the tournament being a goddess statue attached with an Aura stone. It appears that the Academy had set a base there too, with Sharon in charge. After the opening ceremony, Alec found Leshalt and consult him about the Academy. After making a promise that he'll help in any way he can, Leshalt send the team back, only to bump into his grumpy brother, Velhart, who was arguably the best swordsman in Parute and second the best warrior only to Gruga of Brakia (the same from Arc the Lad II). After some time pass, a job order came from the committee of the tournament. It is to safeguard the prize kept inside a nobleman's house in Parute city. As predicted, the Academy did come and wish to snatch the prize. A battle ensues and Alec emerges victorious. The chairman of the committee is none other than Gruga himself, after taking advice from Leshalkt to keep the statue in the Rochefort's manor and had Alec's party to guard it. Not long after the incident, a job came from Leshalt in order to ask Alec to safeguard the Aura stone on the statue and keep it in the safe beneath the item society building. Then Leshalt told Alec that he might know who's the mastermind behind the academy. It appears that it was his old colleague from the time of the disaster. After Alec and his party leave the house, the Professor (leader of the academy), whose name later revealed to be Ludwig, and Sharon enter Leshalt's retreat. The professor's trying to ask Leshalt to join his cause, which he decline. He then go as far as to detain Leshalt as he would be an obstacle for his goal. Back in the city, Alec is trying to convince Gruga to handing him the prize. But Gruga told Alec that he should win the tournament to get the prize and enlist him in the battle. Much to their surprise, Velhart suddenly ask for admittance of the tournament as a participant. Seeing how Velhart used to say that he won't participate without Gruga in the line makes Alec and his friend curious about the sudden change of heart. In the tournament, Alec battles a lot of worthy opponent, starting from Leegle, a hunter he asked to protect his village from bandits at the beginning of the story, to Velhart, as the best swordsman in Parute, and eventually won all the matches. When the prize was about to be given to Alec, Velhart suddenly snatches the statue and run away. Alec and crew pursue him only to see that Velhart has aligned himself with the academy. They followed Velhart to the academy's headquarter in Parute desert. Upon reaching there, they learn that Velhart is actually trying to steal the goddess statue to save his brother Leshalt from the academy's captive. They set to double the aura stone Velhart brought, and the process was halted by Leshalt, which causes him to be killed by Seville of the Academy. Enraged by his brother's murder, Velhart join forces with Alec to chase off the Professor only to find out he had escaped. After much depression and sorrow, Velhart buries his brother in the lot by his retreat and set off for the rest of the journey with Alec. The aura stone is then secured and brought to the item society's safe as Leshalt wished. Moments after, the Guildmaster send a word through his manager that he wishes to meet Alec. He order Alec and his crews to find the Academy's headquarters in a place called Ragnark, which is known as Romalia till the disaster. Using the hovercraft found in the Cariote cave sealed by the guild itself, they travel to Ragnark. As was told, Ragnark used to be the source of the Great Disaster when it was still called Romalia. Alec and his crews arrive at Ragnark and infiltrate the city of Felator in order to find clues about the headquarters. After stealing a lab coat from a resting scientist, Alec sneak into the branch building of Academy and found out that the chief was Sharon. He overheard Sharon and Seville talking about a mysterious energy reading from what they had been researching and she require an escort to headquarter. Alec and his crews followed her through the White Bone Forest and Midoro Swamp to the main building of the Academy located north of Felator. There, they saw a melting alloy gate and Marsia presumes that someone is using an unbelievably powerful ignition technology, since she herself is unable to melt an alloy that thick. They are then confronted by the guards and accidentally learned that they are not the only intruders in the facility. As they battle their way to the top of the building where the Professor, Sharon and Seville is, they are halted by the Fear Crimson, a fusion of a dragon and machine. Seville refers that it was their crown creation and was perfected due to the help by a cardist they captured in Forestamore, which is none other than Theo's mother herself. When asked where is she, Seville implied that on the day Fear Crimson was perfected, she just died. He then lock the team in for a battle with the abominable machine. Though Alec's team emerges victorious, the Fear Crimson then set itself to self-destruct and is about to catch the team in the explosion, when Elc's timely arrival and his Flame Shield prevented that. The Professor, Lugwig and Sharon argued over whatever or not to continue with harassing the power source locked away within the lake. Elc takes Alec up to the roof where they confront the Professor and Sharon. Ludwig used Sharon as a shield against Elc so he couldn't unleash his Fire Power at him. From the roof, they witness the revival of the Sky Castle as the lake's was being vaporized. Upon seeing the desecrated town beneath the vaporizing lake, Alec's memory recall the past where the moment he was saved by a hunter in the fire. It was in Romalia. When thinking a way to get to the Sky Castle, he spots saw the Hien by the bottom of the lake. Elc decided to stay by the Hien to start repairing the airship so it can be used to fly to the Sky Castle. Meanwhile, Elc ask Alec to report to the Guildmaster and suggest that Alec go find Gogen the magic master to find a way to re-seal the Dark One as he predicted that the Academy will at least managed to release the Dark One. At the guild, The Guildmaster promotes Alec to a hunter of a status like Elc and Shu, which act directly under the essentials of the guild. After being promoted, Alec directs the guild to find Gogen. He is then is discovered to be residing in an ancient ruin in a cape in Jiharta. After passing several riddles and tricks made by Gogen, they meet the old man himself and by their surprise, hearing him said that the Dark One can't be re-sealed, as the ark was destroyed by Andel and the lineage of Bravery and Goddess (respectively Arc and Kukuru) has expire. An idea cross by Lutz mind to create a new ark, and is heavily rejected by Gogen since it is an impossible task for men. But the team made their commitment to save the world therefore made Gogen tell them how to craft a new ark. It was told to be made of Eternal Steel, Eternal Tree, Eternal Ice and Eternal Flame. After that, one must be blessed by the guardians before the ark could be created. So the team set off to the guild master to learn the whereabouts of those four sacred relic. The first to be found was Eternal Steel, since it is somewhere in Parute. They search the Cariote cave but found nothing. The next place to go will be the Museum in Paltos, since there is a lot of ancient weapons and armors displayed there. The clerk in the Museum told them that none of the weapons or armors of display was made by a material that ancient, but he points them to a clue of someone who might wield a weapon that ancient. It is Matheus, a master swordsman of the old time. The clerk told the team a story in which the undefeated Matheus was cheated by a fellow fighter to take the Great Mystic Sword for himself. He then point them to the old battle arena, which reside in the Digarta Wilds, to meet the Ghost of the cheating warrior, since he was insatisfied for winning by cheating and haunts the arena with guilt and lust for power. Since Velhart is the best swordsman known in Parute, he challenged him over the Great Mystic Sword. But the Ghost Warrior is more than a match to Velhart and beat him almost single-handedly. After considering what lacks of Velhart, they pay Gruga a visit to consult the matter. Gruga tell Velhart that all he need to do is to change his point of view, which Velhart take as an insult. He then point Velhart to some \\"strong- willed\\" people that might help him. Starting from the arena host, that has been practicing for his ability, to Raia, the receptionist girl of the arena, which has a large passion to be a world-class singer. Alec's team then confronted by Shante, which came all the way from Eteru isle to fetch Raia for her bar. She then ask Velhart if he has corrected his point of view. Velhart then realized that the Ghost Warrior was the same as he was being, hungry for more power and glory. After correcting his point of view and his judgment, he once again challenged the Ghost Warrior and emerged victorious. Velhart then receive fragments of Eternal Steel after laying the Warrior's spirit to rest. The second to be found is the Eternal Tree, which is in the temple ruin where Theo receive his power as a cardist. After arriving at the temple, they are once again confronted by the spirit of Nol and confirmed that the temple did house the Eternal Tree, though only the roots remain. After they succeeded in calming the guardian of the temple with the help of Lieza, her monsters and Poco, they head into the depth of the earth to search for the relic. On their way, Theo heard a cry for help from a seedling monster and decided to help him. The monster then said that he's a part of the \\"Mother's Tree\\". With the guidance of the seedling, they reach the Eternal Tree's root only to find it was badly decomposed and was eaten by Rootybus, a centipede-like monster that has an extremely strong regenerative technique. Proving impossible to beat it in the current state, the team withdraw for the moment. While thinking of a way to stop its regenerative ability, the seedling monster asked Theo to cardish him as he say that he has the power to stop Rootybus' regenerative ability. When Theo replied that once he used his card he will die, the seedling said that he can't die, for he is eternal. Having faith to that, Theo cardished the little monster and used him at Rootybus, which caused him to change shape into a scorpion-like monster. That made his regenerative ability rendered useless and the team make a short work of it. As they wonder if the roots will be enough to use, Theo searched for the little monster and found a seed on the floor. Recalling the little monster's word, Theo hurried to the surface and planted the seed. The seed grows into a giant tree in a matter of seconds and bear fruits similar to the shape of the seedling monster. The tree shed a branch for Theo and they receive the Eternal Tree's branch at last. The third item was the Eternal Ice, which is said to be located in Jiharta. Alec's team reach Jiharta by hovercraft and head straight to the Amaidar Temple to consult Iga concerning the matter. Iga told the youngster that the Eternal Ice might be located in a place called the Ice Gallery, where the cavern is always frozen while the rest of Jiharta is warm. The team head into the Gallery and find a solid ice-made wall at the end of gallery. Each of them try their weapons on the wall and not even a scratch was found on it. When Marsia tried her Heat Shell spell, it won't even melt. So they decided to go to the magic institute in Rushart to ask Salubari of any magic strong enough to break it. As they turn their back, a pair of glowing red eyes was seen to watch them from behind the ice wall. At the institute, Salubari told them that their only chance was the Giga Plasma spell, the strongest spell known to the magic masters. In order to master the spell, one must have the essence of all the elements and beat the elemental wizards. Feeling unconfident of herself, Marsia decided to ask Sania (from Arc the Lad II) in Paysus city to replace her in learning Giga Plasma. When they set to find Master Harzan of Amaidar who knows about the location of Light and Dark wizard, they was told by Tikva that he is training on top of Mount Amaidar. But in fact, The Light and Dark wizard was actually one wizard with mastery of both elements and has died for sometimes without a successor. Tikva set to be the wizard with the help of Harzan and Iga, as he has the potential to be one. This makes Marsia realize how many people are willing to sacrifice for her and decided to face the wizards herself. At the institute, the elemental wizards have been assembled by Salubari takes Marsia's challenge by full force and eventually beaten by Marsia. As they leave the room, Tikva stormed in and ask Marsia for an immediate battle, which Marsia won over. After beating all the elemental wizards, Marsia receive the Giga Plasma as her new collection of spells, and use it to destroy the Ice Wall. But by destroying the Ice wall, they released an ancient creature guarding the Gallery known as the Cliff Giant. Capable of creating ice golems and summon massive tornadoes makes this beast a hard-to- beat opponent. After settling the business, they took a shard of Eternal Ice and depart to find the final piece of relic. The final piece of material, the Eternal Flame was located somewhere on North Sularto, but the guild doesn't know its exact location. The guild suggest that an amnesia merchant named Chongara (the same as Arc the Lad) knows its location. They set to find a cure of his amnesia and find it costs about 1 million gold. So they decided to find another way to cure his amnesia. Marsia thinks of a way and uses her Land Ax spell to cause a shock to his head, which restores his memory. According to Chongara, the smoking volcano cave on North Sularto is the house of the flame that never sleeps. When they reach the heart of the mountain, they found the Eternal flame on top of a mini volcano with unstable reaction that could cause it to erupt and spew hot magma any time. Cheryl had an idea of making a lava- hardening gun from the weapon society and something to house the flame to transport. When they arrive at the item society, it appears that the mysterious object they found on Forestamore has been fixed and given a propeller and a handle so it could carry at least one person. That solves the problem of how they would cross the lake of fire surrounding the flame. Meanwhile, as Elnan of the item society works on something to carry the flame, Alec's teams go on a search of a missing material needed to build the gun for hardening lava. They found out that Gudan of Gislem know the location of it and set to find him in danger dome. Alec agreed to give all his money and items as long as Gudan is willing to tell him where the material is. This makes Gudan wonders about the action and he presume that the second of the Great Disaster might happen if they didn't get the calm nut, so he give the information for free. They head to Kutao temple in search of the calm nut and found some monsters was holding it. After making short work of them, they return to the society village to collect their items of need and head to the lake of fire. Upon reaching the shore of the lake, as Lutz uncover the flying object he receive from Elnan, it turns out that the object was actually Diekbeck (what remained of him after the disaster). He agrees to help the young ones to save the world. After crossing the lake, Lutz climb the volcano as Cheryl use the Stone gun to temporary freeze the lava to protect Lutz. After getting the flame, a sudden eruption throw Lutz off the ledge and landed hard in front of his friends. Cheryl cry over him and pleaded him not to die, only to find that he was joking on them. When they were leaving, Lutz try to find Diekbeck and find him on the lava, unable to move. He told him that he was happy to help their cause and ask them to protect the world, but not before he gave them a monster card of himself and christen them \\"The Brave Ones\\". Back at the guildmaster's office, the team was thinking to go and find Gogen and ask him the whereabouts of the guardians when suddenly Gogen himself appears before them. He told them that the guardians now resides upon a massive structure called the Ghost Dream Crystal in Eteru Isle. So, the team move to Eteru and once again head into the Trial Cave. At the crystal, a voice was heard that the one was going to talk to the guardians must leave their earthly body behind, with no guarantee to be able to return safely. Alec's boldness and kindness makes him step forward and stun his friends to the ground so they won't be able to stop him from going. After leaving his body and enter the Crystal Chamber, he was greeted by Arc and Kukuru, telling him that they had been watching his journey since he got his hunter's crest. The guardians then shows themselves before Alec and give him their blessing to create the ark. After several calls from his friends, Alec then returned to the material world and told his friends to lay the material in a line. Together, they watch anxiously as the new ark was magically created before their eyes. Taking the new ark, they all return to the Guildmaster's office and prepare themselves for the final battle. The guild itself has received word from Elc that he has finished reassembling the Hien back and it is now ready to fly. Alec and Elc reach the sky castle. After fighting through the castle, they eventually defeat Seville and Galdo. As they reach the professor, he arrogantly shrugged off everyone's warnings and eventually releases the Dark One. The group used the new Ark against it but nothing happened. A joint effort by Sharon, a redeeming Lugwig and Elc pushes back the Dark One from escaping, leaving the remaining group to fight. After a fierce fight, the Dark One tries to tempt the group by offering its power to restore the world. None of them took its offer; they had resolved that they can rebuild their world by their own means and with that, the new Ark began to activate. Realizing what caused this and focusing on the good, the heroes managed to seal it in the new Ark once and for all. In the aftermath, Lugwig acknowledges his flawed direction with the Academy; Sharon offered to help Lugwig make amends for the harm he caused. Each member of the group goes off to resume their lives: Anriette (if you take on a series of jobs related to her) returns home and now enjoys being more independent. Velhart visits his brother's grave, stating that the threat is over. Marisa returns to the Spell Institute and become a teacher. Theo goes to Lieza's ranch to work with the monsters there. Cheryl visits the new Eternal Tree, thinking about the hope of a new life in a new world. Alec and Lutz return home to Sasha Village as heroes. Reception An RPGFans review criticises this game as being the \\"weakest Arc The Lad game yet\\". It says that the game lacks a good plot, the gameplay is too slow and drawn out, and the soundtrack of the game being lackluster.

The story continues from the first game, although the focus shifts from Arc to Elc. It expands from the gameplay of the first installment, with a larger world and a more diverse cast. An anime was made based on this game. Gameplay Unlike the original game, the countries of the world can be viewed in detail on a bird's eye scale. Most travel is initially restricted to the game's plot, but players eventually gain global access by airship, either by the Hein or the Silver Noah. Players are no longer under restricted turn- based movement while going through dungeon/field areas. The battles vary from random encounters to automatic entries to a section. Just as in the first game, the characters do battle against monsters and enemies in strategy-based combat. However, rather than fighting with every party member in each battle, the player now has to select between 1 and 6 characters per battle, depending on the battle's requirements. The player can recruit monsters into the party with the option of upgrading them and other characters at a later time. In most cities in Arc the Lad II, there are hunter guilds where the player can take on local jobs. These jobs include fetch quests, monster hunting and deliveries. Most jobs include a degree of battle. Also in the guilds are bulletins about rare marked monsters that can be found in certain dungeon/field areas. Some jobs only become available after completing related jobs or certain plot points. Reception Critics cited Arc the Lad II as the best of the original trilogy. David Smith of IGN praised the game's expansion over the first game, writing that \\"Arc II grafts a bigger world map, more detailed dungeons, more complex character development, a far larger cast, and most of all a longer quest onto a combat system that remains pretty familiar.\\" Alex Makar of Gaming Age noted that the addition of the Hunter's Guild to the gameplay added an element of nonlinearity, allowing the player to complete many side-quests (or \\"jobs\\") and giving \\"the player a lot of flexibility in how they want to progress through the storyline.\\" He also commented on the cast, saying that the characters were more likeable and had more personality, and that the \\"story is also a lot darker than it is in Arc 1, and has some pretty angst and melancholy ridden overtones.\\" Smith's major complaint with the game was its graphical representation, saying that the game looks almost identical to the first game. In contrast, Bethany Massimilla of Cnet.com called the character sprites \\"more vibrantly colored and better detailed\\", although she admitted that the \\"dungeons remain largely monotonous\\".

The picturesque planet Saturn is featured in numerous works of science fiction. Early works of science fiction used Saturn itself as a location for stories, but modern science has shown that the planet has no solid surface on which one could land, and that its atmosphere and temperature are hostile to human life. As a result, the Saturnian system as a whole, including its planetary rings and its extensive system of moons, is a more common setting for science fiction. On Saturn  Literature  * Micromégas (1752) by Voltaire. Micromégas, an extraterrestrial visitor, arrives at Saturn first (Uranus and Neptune had not yet been discovered in 1752Willy Ley: Die Himmelskunde. Econ, Düsseldorf / Vienna 1965, p. 188). Saturn's citizens are \\"only a thousand fathoms high\\", have 72 senses and live for about 15,000 years. Micromégas forms a close friendship with the secretary of the Academy of Saturn, who accompanies him to Earth. * Off on a Comet (1877) by Jules Verne. Adventurers pass within 415,000,000 miles of Saturn while riding on a comet. The book describes Saturn as having 8 satellites and 3 rings. It contains a black and white illustration showing what night might look like from the surface of the planet. The rings are brightly illuminated by the sun, and an elliptical shadow is cast on them by the planet. The drawing shows the surface of Saturn as a rocky, desolate, solid surface. * A Journey in Other Worlds (1894) by John Jacob Astor IV. Explorers from Earth reach Saturn from Jupiter (which is a tropical jungle world, much like ancient Earth) and find that the planet is a dark, dry, dying planet. The only inhabitants of Saturn are gigantic, ghostlike creatures that communicate telepathically and can predict the future. * Cthulhu Mythos by H. P. Lovecraft et al. Saturn was known as Cykranosh in the Hyperborean Era, both Tsathoggua and Atlach-Nacha came to Earth from there, and Tsathoggua's paternal uncle Hziulquoigmnzhah still resides there. *In Captain Marvel Adventures #1: \\"The Monsters of Saturn\\", Saturn has been invaded by a race of Dragon-men from another planet who have enslaved the humanoid inhabitants. The natives of Saturn have a legend of a Thunder God freeing them one day. One of them contacts Earth with a radio, causing Cap to travel to Saturn. Captain Marvel wipes the Dragon-men out before returning to Earth. * The Gaea trilogy by John Varley is set on a Stanford torus orbiting Saturn. *Jemm, Son of Saturn (1984). Saturn's atmosphere is home to immense, enclosed floating cities, the homes of the Red and White Saturnians, twin races that began as cloned offshoots of the nearly extinct Martian race. Red Saturnians were cloned from Green Martians; White Saturnians were cloned from White Martians. The two species have a rivalry. Like Martians they have mental powers, allowing them to control or read minds. *In Strange Tales #1 (1951) the first story \\"The Strange Men\\" involves beings from the planet Saturn, who, in a subterranean city on an island in the Atlantic Ocean, are creating an array of weaponry with which they plan to invade Earth and all the other planets in the Solar System. They are humanoid, but require gas masks to protect themselves from our \\"vile earthly atmosphere\\". They are so technologically advanced they can walk through walls. *In Journey into Mystery #83 (1962) \\"The Stone Men From Saturn\\", in which Thor (Marvel Comics) appears for the first time, a race of humanoids made of stone come to Earth with the intention of invading.

He served as Bishop of Buffalo from 1903 until his death in 1915. Early life and education Charles Colton was born in New York City to Patrick Smith and Teresa Augusta (née Mullin) Colton, who were Irish immigrants. He received his early education at Public School No. 5 and the Latin school of St. Stephen's Church. As a boy, he held a clerical position in a dry goods store. In 1869, he entered St. Francis Xavier College, from where he later graduated in 1873. He then made his theological studies at St. Joseph's Seminary in Troy. Priesthood Colton was ordained to the priesthood on June 10, 1876. His first assignment was as a curate at St. Stephen's Church under Father Edward McGlynn. He remained at St. Stephen's for ten years, and during that time also served as a chaplain at Bellevue Hospital. In 1886, he was named pastor of Our Lady of Mercy Church in Port Chester. Following the excommunication of the controversial Father Glynn, he returned to St. Stephen's Church in 1887 to assist Father Arthur Donnelly, who had been assigned as temporary administrator. Later that year, he assumed the role of St. Stephen's upon Donnelly's resignation. He enjoyed remarkable success in his new post, restoring harmony among the congregation, eliminating the parish debt of $152,000, and establishing a parochial school. In addition to his pastoral duties, he became chancellor of the Archdiocese of New York in 1896. Episcopacy On June 10, 1903, Colton was appointed the fourth Bishop of Buffalo by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following August 24 from Archbishop John Murphy Farley, with Bishops Bernard John McQuaid and Charles Edward McDonnell serving as co-consecrators, in St. Patrick's Cathedral. During his tenure, the diocese was composed of 72 churches, 18 combination school-churches, 30 schools, 12 academies, 13 hospitals, and charitable institutions, 6 convents, and 28 rectories. Colton died at age 66. He is buried in the crypt of St. Joseph's Cathedral.

(1994). Scientific Nihilism: On the Loss and Recovery of Physical Explanation (S U N Y Series in Philosophy). Albany, New York: State University Of New York Press.Edis, T. (2002). The Ghost in the Universe: God in Light of Modern Science. Buffalo, NY: Prometheus Books.Crease, R. P. (1993). The Play of Nature (Indiana Series in the Philosophy of Technology). Bloomington: Indiana University Press.Seager, W. (1999). Theories of Consciousness: An Introduction (Philosophical Issues in Science). New York: Routledge. Quantum mysticism is considered by most scientists and philosophers to be pseudoscience or quackery. Early controversy and resolution Olav Hammer stated that Werner Heisenberg was so interested in India, that he got the nickname \\"The Buddha\\". However, states Hammer, in Heisenberg’s Physics and Philosophy (1959) there is no substantial trace of quantum mysticism and adds \\"In fact, Heisenberg discusses at length and endorses the decidedly non- mystical Copenhagen interpretation.\\" Hammer also states \\"Schrödinger’s studies of Hindu mysticism never compelled him to pursue the same course as quantum metaphysicists such as David Bohm or Fritjof Capra.\\" Hammer quotes Schrödinger's biographer, Walter J. Moore, according to whom these two interests (quantum physics and Hindu mysticism) were \\"strangely dissociated\\". Wigner In 1961 Eugene Wigner wrote a paper, titled \\"Remarks on the mind–body question\\", suggesting that a conscious observer played a fundamental role in quantum mechanics, a part of the von Neumann–Wigner interpretation. While his paper would serve as inspiration for later mystical works by others, Wigner's ideas were primarily philosophical and are not considered \\"in the same ballpark\\" as the mysticism that would follow. Appropriation by New Age thought In the early 1970s New Age culture began to incorporate ideas from quantum physics, beginning with books by Arthur Koestler, Lawrence LeShan, and others which suggested that purported parapsychological phenomena could be explained by quantum mechanics. In this decade the Fundamental Fysiks Group emerged, a group of physicists who embraced quantum mysticism while engaging in parapsychology, Transcendental Meditation, and various New Age and Eastern mystical practices. Inspired in part by Wigner, Fritjof Capra, a member of the Fundamental Fysiks Group, wrote The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels Between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism (1975), a book espousing New Age quantum physics that gained popularity among the non- scientific public. In 1979 came the publication of The Dancing Wu Li Masters by Gary Zukav, a non-scientist and \\"the most successful of Capra's followers\\". The Fundamental Fysiks Group is said to be one of the agents responsible for the \\"huge amount of pseudoscientific nonsense\\" surrounding interpretations of quantum mechanics.  Modern usage and examples  In contrast to the mysticism of the early twentieth century, today quantum mysticism typically refers to its New Age incarnation that claims to combine ancient mysticism with quantum mechanics. Called a pseudoscience and a \\"hijacking\\" of quantum physics, it draws upon \\"coincidental similarities of language rather than genuine connections\\" to quantum mechanics. Physicist Murray Gell-Mann coined the phrase \\"quantum flapdoodle\\" to refer to the misuse and misapplication of quantum physics to other topics. An example of such misuse is New Age guru Deepak Chopra's \\"quantum theory\\" that aging is caused by the mind, expounded in his books Quantum Healing (1989) and Ageless Body, Timeless Mind (1993). In 1998 Chopra was awarded the parody Ig Nobel Prize in the physics category for \\"his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life, liberty, and the pursuit of economic happiness\\".The 1998 Ig Nobel Prize Winners The 2004 film What the Bleep Do We Know!? dealt with a range of New Age ideas in relation to physics. It was produced by the Ramtha School of Enlightenment which was founded by J.Z. Knight, a channeler who said that her teachings were based on a discourse with a 35,000-year-old disembodied entity named Ramtha. Featuring Fundamental Fysiks Group member Fred Alan Wolf, the film misused some aspects of quantum mechanics—including the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the observer effect—as well as biology and medicine. Numerous critics dismissed the film for its use of pseudoscience.

It is a royal castle built in the 13th century. While it dates mainly from the 13th century, it had substantial 15th- and 16th-century alterations. The large rectangular keep with three vaulted chambers at the ground floor is approached across a rock-cut ditch. It was originally surrounded by outer rectangular walls with four corner towers (ruins of some remain). It is likely to have been built by Hugh de Lacy, along with Carlingford Castle on the opposite side of Carlingford Lough, to guard the narrow entry channel to the Lough, and the ferry crossing between the two. The motte from the earlier Norman, wooden, Motte and Bailey Castle (possibly built by John de Courcey) is still on the seaward side nearer the point. According to one legend John de Courcy was married at Greencastle Castle, but this may have been at the original motte & bailey castle. According to the information boards at the site it was held for the English Crown by Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, from 1264–1333. It was attacked and taken by Edward Bruce, the brother of Robert, in 1316. This was in spite of one of Richard de Burgh's daughters having married Robert the Bruce himself. It was attacked at least twice by the Irish in the later 14th century but still maintained as an English garrison in the 1590s.

Internal view of the castle. The Castello Maniace is a citadel and castle in Syracuse, Sicily, southern Italy. It is situated at the far point of the Ortygia island promontory, where it was constructed between 1232 and 1240 by the Emperor Frederick II. It bears the name of George Maniakes, the Byzantine general who besieged and took the city in 1038. Originally, one could only enter the castle over a bridge spanning a moat (now filled). A feature of the castle is the decorated portal. Today the castle is open to public and is a local tourist attraction in Syracuse. History The first fort was built here in 1038 by George Maniakes, a Greek general and later the Catepan of Italy, after he captured Syracuse from the Arabs on behalf of the Emperor Michael IV. Frederick II, as King of Sicily, had his architect Riccardo da Lentini rebuild it in 1232–1240. King Peter III of Aragon resided here with his family in 1288. From 1305 to 1536 the castle was used as residence by numerous queens of Sicily. In the 15th century it was used as a prison. In the following century it was included in the fortification defending the harbour and the city. A huge explosion damaged it in 1704, after which it was renovated and adapted to the use of guns.

(January 1, 1825 - April 10, 1896) was a Canadian- born American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Bishop of Buffalo, New York from 1868 until his death in 1896. Biography Ryan was born in Almonte, Ontario on January 1, 1825, and later moved with his family to Pennsylvania, where he entered St. Charles Borromeo Seminary at Overbrook in 1841. On May 5, 1846, he joined the Congregation of the Mission (also known as the Lazarists or Vincentians) at Cape Girardeau, Missouri. He was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Francis Kenrick on June 24, 1849, and named Visitor General of the Congregation of the Mission in the United States in 1857. On March 3, 1868, Ryan was appointed the second Bishop of Buffalo, New York, by Pope Pius IX. He received his episcopal consecration on the following November 8 from Archbishop John McCloskey, with Bishops John Loughlin and John Joseph Lynch, C.M., serving as co-consecrators, at St. Joseph's Cathedral. Ryan unified the Catholic school system and established a commission to supervise the work of parochial schools. He founded the diocesan newspaper called The Catholic Union (later known as the Catholic Union and Echo, the Magnificat, and the Western New York Catholic). He also engaged in a public controversy with Arthur Cleveland Coxe, the Episcopal Bishop of Western New York, over the issue of apostolic succession. Ryan died at Buffalo, aged 71, and was interred next to Bishop John Timon at St. Joseph's Cathedral. His tenure as Bishop spanned 28 years, the longest in the history of the Buffalo Diocese.

A hunt test is an event at which the natural ability and training of gun dogs are evaluated against a written standard. Each dog that meets this standard earns a pass. This is unlike a field trial in which dog/handler teams compete against one another with only one dog being declared the winner. Hunt tests are for example organized by the American Kennel Club (AKC), the North American Hunting Retriever Association (NAHRA), the United Kennel Club (UKC) under the auspices of the Hunting Retriever Club (HRC), and the Société Centrale Canine (SCC).  Organizers in North America   American Kennel Club hunt tests  The American Kennel Club (AKC) awards the titles of Junior Hunter (JH), Senior Hunter (SH), Master Hunter (MH) and Master National Hunter (MNH) for performance in hunt tests. The standards for the various levels are designed to approximate the situations and conditions encountered when hunting. Dogs are required to prove the ability to retrieve and find birds. The AKC provides different hunt test formats for different types of gun dogs. There are tests for nonslip retrievers, flushing spaniels, and pointing breeds.  North American Hunting Retriever Association hunt tests  The North American Hunting Retriever Association (NAHRA) awards the titles Started Hunting Retriever (SR), Working Retriever (WR), Master Hunting Retriever (MHR), and Grand Master Hunting Retriever (GMHR). The standard of training for the higher levels of NAHRA hunt test require a more advanced degree of training than those of AKC hunt tests. These simulate actual hunting by testing for the following skill sets. Quartering, trailing a crippled duck, and sit to flush. NAHRA tests are primarily for nonslip retrievers, although many spaniel and versatile breeds may compete. Poodles, and Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers(NSDTR) are often found on the NAHRA scene. Conservation of game through the development of trained retrievers. The first organization dedicated to preserving hunting retriever skills. NAHRA, incorporated in 1984, is the originator of standards- based retriever field testing using realistic hunting scenarios. Dogs compete against a set of standards set forth in our rule book, not each other. Advanced titles require dogs to demonstrate proficiency in both upland and waterfowl work. Field tests are realistic, simulated hunting scenarios, with distances and conditions that hunters would encounter in the field. NAHRA supports clubs throughout the United States and Canada.  United Kennel Club retriever hunt tests  The United Kennel Club (UKC), in conjunction with hunt test events held under the organizational auspices of the Hunting Retriever Club Inc. (HRC) and its affiliated regional clubs, awards the titles of; Started Hunting Retriever (SHR), Hunting Retriever (HR), Hunting Retriever Champion (HRCH) and Grand Hunting Retriever Champion (GRHRC). There is also an Upland Hunter (UH) title awarded to dogs that pass a separate and distinct upland hunting test which can be run inconjuction with a regular test as a stand-alone test. To gain these titles there are four levels of testing where dogs earn points toward these specific titles. Each of these tests are of increasing difficulty and require increasing refinement in skill level that a hunting retriever must demonstrate while under judgment. These test levels are the; Started, Seasoned and Finished tests which are offered by regional HRC clubs. The final and most difficult level of test is called the “Grand” which is held twice a year by the HRC Inc. where all dogs that have previously earned the HRCH and UH title can be tested for the GRHRC title. As mentioned previously there is a separate upland hunter test that is also offered by local HRC clubs. These titles, once earned, are used as a prefix to the dogs registered name in the UKC. A typical HRC hunt test will be a one-day event with the tests divided into two series of evaluations; these consist of the land series and the water series. In each series of the test the dogs are evaluated on their marking, memory, control and in the upper stakes honoring another dog. Marking is the ability of the dog to go directly to the area of fall and retrieve the bird regardless of the factors that might influence the dogs ability of travel to the area of the fall. Memory is the dogs ability to remember multiple falls regardless of the factors. Control is the dogs ability to walk to and from the line obediently. As well as taking the handler's commands on a mark that the dog has failed to mark and on the blind retrieve. These HRC hunt tests try to simulate as closely as possible actual hunting situations where the dogs are tested at realistic hunting ranges with the handlers wearing appropriate hunting attire and demonstrating safe gun handling practices while handling and firing a shotgun loaded with blanks called poppers. Also the bird throwers, known as “Bird Boys”, are hidden from view of the dog under test.

P2P file sharing allows users to access media files such as books, music, movies, and games using a P2P software program that searches for other connected computers on a P2P network to locate the desired content. The nodes (peers) of such networks are end-user computers and distribution servers (not required). Peer-to-peer file sharing technology has evolved through several design stages from the early networks like Napster, which popularized the technology, to later models like the BitTorrent protocol. Microsoft uses it for Update distribution (Windows 10) and online playing games (e.g. the mmorpg Skyforge) use it as their content distribution network for downloading large amounts of data without incurring the dramatic costs for bandwidth inherent when providing just a single source. Several factors contributed to the widespread adoption and facilitation of peer-to-peer file sharing. These included increasing Internet bandwidth, the widespread digitization of physical media, and the increasing capabilities of residential personal computers. Users are able to transfer one or more files from one computer to another across the Internet through various file transfer systems and other file-sharing networks. History Peer-to-peer file sharing became popular with the introduction of Napster, a file sharing application and a set of central servers that linked people who had files with those who requested files. The central index server indexed the users and their shared content. When someone searched for a file, the server searched all available copies of that file and presented them to the user. The files would be transferred directly between the two private computers. A limitation was that only music files could be shared. Because this process occurred on a central server, however, Napster was held liable for copyright infringement and shut down in July 2001. It later reopened as a pay service. After Napster was shut down, the most popular peer-to-peer services were Gnutella and Kazaa. These services also allowed users to download files other than music, such as movies and games. Technology evolution  Napster and eDonkey2000 both used a central server-based model. These systems relied on the operation of the respective central servers, and thus were susceptible to centralized shutdown. Their demise led to the rise of networks like Limewire, Kazaa, Morpheus, Gnutella, and Gnutella2, which are able to operate without any central servers, eliminated the central vulnerability by connecting users remotely to each other. However, these networks still relied on specific, centrally distributed client programs, so they could be crippled by taking legal action against a sufficiently large number of publishers of the client programs. Sharman Networks, the publisher of Kazaa, has been inactive since 2006. StreamCast Networks, the publisher of Morpheus, shut down on April 22, 2008. Limewire LLC was shut down in late 2010 or early 2011. This cleared the way for the dominance of the Bittorrent protocol, which differs from its predecessors in two major ways. The first is that no individual, group, or company owns the protocol or the terms \\"Torrent\\" or \\"Bittorrent\\", meaning that anyone can write and distribute client software that works with the network. The second is that Bittorrent clients have no search functionality of their own. Instead, users must rely on third-party websites like Isohunt or The Pirate Bay to find \\"torrent\\" files, which function like maps that tell the client how to find and download the files that the user actually wants. These two characteristics combined offer a level of decentralization that makes Bittorrent practically impossible to shut down. File-sharing networks are sometimes organized into three \\"generations\\" based on these different levels of decentralization. So-called darknets, including networks like Freenet, are sometimes considered to be third-generation file-sharing networks.. Soulseek is a first-generation file-sharing network that has escaped legal trouble and continues to operate in the third-generation era. Peer-to-peer file sharing is also efficient in terms of cost. The system administration overhead is smaller because the user is the provider and usually the provider is the administrator as well. Hence each network can be monitored by the users themselves. At the same time, large servers sometimes require more storage and this increases the cost since the storage has to be rented or bought exclusively for a server. However, usually peer-to-peer file sharing does not require a dedicated server.  Economic impact  There is still ongoing discussion about the economic impact of P2P file sharing. Norbert Michel, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, said that because of \\"econometric and data issues, studies thus far have produced disparate estimates of file sharing's impact on album sales.\\"J. Michel, Norbert. Internet File Sharing and The Evidence So far, heritage.org, August 23, 2004. In the book The Wealth of Networks, Yochai Benkler states that peer-to-peer file sharing is economically efficient and that the users pay the full transaction cost and marginal cost of such sharing even if it \\"throws a monkey wrench into the particular way in which our society has chosen to pay musicians and re-cording executives. This trades off efficiency for longer-term incentive effects for the recording industry. However, it is efficient within the normal meaning of the term in economics in a way that it would not have been had Jack and Jane used subsidized computers or network connections\\". As peer-to-peer file sharing can be used to exchange files for which the distribution right was granted (e.g. public domain, Creative Commons, Copyleft licenses, online games, updates, ...). Especially startups can save massive amounts of money compared with other means of content delivery networks. A calculation example: with peer to peer file sharing: \\\\text{total cost} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{filesize}}{\\\\text{customers}} \\\\times \\\\text{cost-per-byte} with casual content delivery networks: \\\\text{total cost} = \\\\text{filesize} \\\\times \\\\text{customers} \\\\times \\\\text{cost-per-byte}  Music industry  The economic effect of copyright infringement through peer- to-peer file sharing on music revenue has been controversial and difficult to determine. Unofficial studies found that file sharing had a negative impact on record sales.Alejandro Zentner, \\"File Sharing and International Sales of Copyrighted Music: An Empirical Analysis with a Panel of Countries\\", The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy, Vol. 5, Issue 1 (2005)Stan J. Liebowitz in a series of papers (2005, 2006) It has proven difficult to untangle the cause and effect relationships among a number of different trends, including an increase in legal online purchases of music; illegal file-sharing; drops in the prices of CDs; and the extinction of many independent music stores with a concomitant shift to sales by big-box retailers.Smith, Ethan. March 21, 2007. \\"Sales of Music, Long in Decline, Plunge Sharply: Rise in Downloading Fails to Boost Industry; A Retailing Shakeout\\", Wallstreet Journal Website Also many independent artists choose a peer-to-peer file sharing method named BitTorrent Bundle for distribution. Film industry The MPAA reported that American studios lost $2.373 billion to Internet piracy in 2005, representing approximately one third of the total cost of film piracy in the United States. The MPAA's estimate was doubted by commentators since it was based on the assumption that one download was equivalent to one lost sale, and downloaders might not purchase the movie if illegal downloading was not an option. Due to the private nature of the study, the figures could not be publicly checked for methodology or validity, and on January 22, 2008, as the MPAA was lobbying for a bill which would compel universities to crack down on piracy, it was admitted by MPAA that its figures on piracy in colleges had been inflated by up to 300%. A 2010 study, commissioned by the International Chamber of Commerce and conducted by independent Paris-based economics firm TERA, estimated that unlawful downloading of music, film and software cost Europe's creative industries several billion dollars in revenue each year.Mundell, Ian. Piracy in Europe costs $13.7 billion, Variety. March 18, 2010. Furthermore, the TERA study entitled \\"Building a Digital Economy: The Importance of Saving Jobs in the EU's Creative Industries\\" predicted losses due to piracy reaching as much as 1.2 million jobs and €240 billion in retail revenue by 2015 if the trend continued. Researchers applied a substitution rate of ten percent to the volume of copyright infringements per year. This rate corresponded to the number of units potentially traded if unlawful file sharing were eliminated and did not occur.Geoffron, Patrice. Building a Digital Economy, iccwbo.org, March 17, 2010.

An academic study among American and European college students found that users of file-sharing technologies were relatively anti-copyright and that copyright enforcement created backlash, hardening pro-file sharing beliefs among users of these technologies.Ben Depoorter et al. \\" Copyright Backlash\\", Southern California Law Review, 2011.  Communities in P2P file sharing networks Communities have a prominent role in many peer to peer networks and applications, such as BitTorrent, Gnutella and DC++. There are different elements that contribute to the formation, development and the stability of these communities, which include interests, user attributes, cost reduction, user motivation and the dimension of the community.  Interest attributes  Peer communities are formed on the basis of common interests. For Khambatti, Ryu and Dasgupta common interests can be labelled as attributes \\"which are used to determine the peer communities in which a particular peer can participate\\". There are two ways in which these attributes can be classified: explicit and implicit attributes. Explicit values are information that peers provide about themselves to a specific community, such as their interest in a subject or their taste in music. With implicit values, users do not directly express information about themselves, albeit, it is still possible to find information about that specific user by uncovering his or her past queries and research carried out in a P2P network. Khambatti, Ryu and Dasgupta divide these interests further into three classes: personal, claimed and group attributes. A full set of attributes (common interests) of a specific peer is defined as personal attributes, and is a collection of information a peer has about him or herself. Peers may decide not to disclose information about themselves to maintain their privacy and online security. It is for this reason that the authors specify that \\"a subset of...attributes is explicitly claimed public by a peer\\", and they define such attributes as \\"claimed attributes\\". The third category of interests is group attributes, defined as \\"location or affiliation oriented\\" and are needed to form a...basis for communities\\", an example being the \\"domain name of an internet connection\\" which acts as an online location and group identifier for certain users.  Cost reduction  Cost reduction influences the sharing component of P2P communities. Users who share do so to attempt \\"to reduce...costs\\" as made clear by Cunningham, Alexander and Adilov. In their work Peer-to-peer File Sharing Communities, they explain that \\"the act of sharing is costly since any download from a sharer implies that the sharer is sacrificing bandwidth\\". As sharing represents the basis of P2P communities, such as Napster, and without it \\"the network collapses\\", users share despite its costs in order to attempt to lower their own costs, particularly those associated with searching, and with the congestion of internet servers.  User motivation and size of community  User motivation and the size of the P2P community contribute to its sustainability and activity. In her work Motivating Participation in Peer to Peer Communities, Vassileva studies these two aspects through an experiment carried out in the University of Saskatchewan (Canada), where a P2P application (COMUTELLA) was created and distributed among students. In her view, motivation is \\"a crucial factor\\" in encouraging users to participate in an online P2P community, particularly because the \\"lack of a critical mass of active users\\" in the form of a community will not allow for a P2P sharing to function properly. Usefulness is a valued aspect by users when joining a P2P community. The specific P2P system must be perceived as \\"useful\\" by the user and must be able to fulfil his or her needs and pursue his or her interests. Consequently, the \\"size of the community of users defines the level of usefulness\\" and \\"the value of the system determines the number of users\\". This two way process is defined by Vassileva as a feedback loop, and has allowed for the birth of file-sharing systems like Napster and KaZaA. However, in her research Vassileva has also found that \\"incentives are needed for the users in the beginning\\", particularly for motivating and getting users into the habit of staying online. This can be done, for example, by providing the system with a wide amount of resources or by having an experienced user provide assistance to a less experienced one.  User classification  Users participating in P2P systems can be classified in different ways. According to Vassileva, users can be classified depending on their participation in the P2P system. There are five types of users to be found: users who create services, users who allow services, users who facilitate search, users who allow communication, users who are uncooperative and free ride. In the first instance, the user creates new resources or services and offers them to the community. In the second, the user provides the community with disk space \\"to store files for downloads\\" or with \\"computing resources\\" to facilitate a service provided by another users. In the third, the user provides a list of relationships to help other users find specific files or services. In the fourth, the user participates actively in the \\"protocol of the network\\", contributing to keeping the network together. In the last situation, the user does not contribute to the network, downloads what he or she needs but goes immediately offline once the service is not needed anymore, thus free-riding on the network and community resources.  Tracking  Corporations continue to combat the use of the internet as a tool to illegally copy and share various files, especially that of copyrighted music. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has been active in leading campaigns against infringers. Lawsuits have been launched against individuals as well as programs such as Napster in order to \\"protect\\" copyright owners. One effort of the RIAA has been to implant decoy users to monitor the use of copyrighted material from a firsthand perspective.  Risks  In early June 2002, Researcher Nathaniel Good at HP Labs demonstrated that user interface design issues could contribute to users inadvertently sharing personal and confidential information over P2P networks. In 2003, Congressional hearings before the House Committee of Government Reform (Overexposed: The Threats to Privacy & Security on File Sharing Networks) and the Senate Judiciary Committee (The Dark Side of a Bright Idea: Could Personal and National Security Risks Compromise the Potential of P2P File-Sharing Networks?) were convened to address and discuss the issue of inadvertent sharing on peer-to- peer networks and its consequences to consumer and national security. Researchers have examined potential security risks including the release of personal information, bundled spyware, and viruses downloaded from the network.By M. Eric Johnson, Dan McGuire, Nicholas D. Willey The Evolution of the Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Industry and the Security Risks for Users Some proprietary file sharing clients have been known to bundle malware, though open source programs typically have not. Some open source file sharing packages have even provided integrated anti-virus scanning.Open source file sharing software with integrated anti-virus scanning Since approximately 2004 the threat of identity theft had become more prevalent, and in July 2008 there was another inadvertent revealing of vast amounts of personal information through P2P sites. The \\"names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers of about 2,000 of (an investment) firm's clients\\" were exposed, \\"including [those of] Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.\\" A drastic increase in inadvertent P2P file sharing of personal and sensitive information became evident in 2009 at the beginning of President Obama's administration when the blueprints to the helicopter Marine One were made available to the public through a breach in security via a P2P file sharing site. Access to this information has the potential of being detrimental to US security.Greg Sandoval. April 21, 2009 10:41 AM PDT. \\"Congress to probe P2P sites over 'inadvertent sharing'\\", CNET News Furthermore, shortly before this security breach, the Today show had reported that more than 150,000 tax returns, 25,800 student loan applications and 626,000 credit reports had been inadvertently made available through file sharing. The United States government then attempted to make users more aware of the potential risks involved with P2P file sharing programs through legislation such as H.R. 1319, the Informed P2P User Act, in 2009. According to this act, it would be mandatory for individuals to be aware of the risks associated with peer-to-peer file sharing before purchasing software with informed consent of the user required prior to use of such programs. In addition, the act would allow users to block and remove P2P file sharing software from their computers at any time,\\"Text of H.R. 1319: Informed P2P User Act\\", GovTrack.us with the Federal Trade Commission enforcing regulations.

The persuader attempts to convince the respondent to comply by making a large request that the respondent will most likely turn down, much like a metaphorical slamming of a door in the persuader's face. The respondent is then more likely to agree to a second, more reasonable request, than if that same request is made in isolation. The DITF technique can be contrasted with the foot-in-the-door (FITD) technique, in which a persuader begins with a small request and gradually increases the demands of each request. Both the FITD and DITF techniques increase the likelihood a respondent will agree to the second request. Classic experiment In a classic experiment investigating the effectiveness of the DITF technique, researchers separated participants into three groups. In group 1, experimenters asked participants to volunteer to counsel juvenile delinquents for two hours a week for two years (large request). After their refusal, the group was asked to chaperone juvenile delinquents on a one-day trip to the zoo (small request). Group 2 was given only the small request. In group 3, the experimenter described the large request but asked the participants to perform the small request. 50% of the participants in group 1 agreed to the small request, compared to 17% in group 2 and 25% in group 3. Because compliance for the small request was significantly larger for group 1 than group 2, the DITF technique was successful. Compliance for the small request was also significantly larger for group 1 than group 3, which demonstrates that mere exposure to the more extreme task does not affect compliance as significantly. Mechanisms An important topic in DITF research involves whether the DITF technique is effective because of reciprocal concessions or social responsibility. The reciprocal concessions explanation is more common and involves reciprocity, or the need for a respondent to comply to the smaller second request because the persuader is compromising from the initial request. The social responsibility explanation involves internal standards of the importance of helping others that make the respondent feel they must comply to the second smaller request. Other explanations of the DITF effect involve maintaining a positive self-presentation and reducing guilt. Reciprocal concessions and social responsibility =Support for social responsibility= Two studies comparing reciprocal concessions with social responsibility explanations found evidence for social responsibility related to helping. In the first study, participants read DITF scenarios and then rated whether certain terms were relevant to these situations or not. These terms either referred to helping or to bargaining. In the second study, participants rated the similarity of a DITF interaction to four other situations: helping a friend, negotiating with a friend, helping a stranger, and negotiating with a stranger. The DITF scenarios used in both studies were taken from previous research and shown to be very effective in influencing compliance. Overall, findings indicate that participants felt DITF interactions were more closely related to helping than bargaining. This supports the social responsibility explanation of the DITF technique because social responsibility is related to helping one's self, while reciprocal concessions is related to negotiating. =Support for both social responsibility and reciprocal concessions= Research investigating reciprocal concessions and in-group-out-group biases found both reciprocal concessions and in-group context to be important in the DITF technique. In- groups are groups that a person feels that they belong to, while out-groups are ones that a person does not belong to and might perceive negatively. This study employed two different types of confederates, in-group confederates who dressed and acted like college students and out-group confederates who dressed and acted more formally. The in-group confederates introduced themselves as university students, while the out-group confederates introduced themselves as private business school students. All of the participants in this study went to the same university as the in-group confederates. The confederates either made a large request then a smaller one, a smaller request alone, or offered the participant a choice of both requests. Results show greater compliance to the second smaller request for the in-group confederates compared to out-group confederates, but there was still a DITF effect in the out-group context. Participants were most likely to comply to requests from those within their social groups, yet they still had increased compliance to the smaller second request for people outside of their social groups. The researchers suggest that this is evidence for reciprocal concessions because the influence of social group and the DITF effect work independently of each other, therefore, there must be another explanation for DITF that does not involve in-group-out- group biases. The researchers fail to mention the social responsibility explanation, however. =Sufficiency of explanations= Another study comparing reciprocal concessions with social responsibility found neither explanation to be sufficient. This study employed confederates who asked for donations door-to-door. Participants were either given a large, moderate, or small request initially. The large request involved 10 hours of volunteering for several weeks, the moderate request involved a $30.00 donation, and the small request involved a donation of any amount. The confederate gave the smaller request after an initial large or moderate one. Participants then filled out a questionnaire that asked about the respondent's perceived obligation to comply, perceptions of negotiation and/or helping in the situation, and whether the respondent was friends with the confederate. Results show that participants were more likely to comply for friends than strangers, the DITF technique had greater compliance overall than a small request alone, and the DITF technique had larger increases in compliance for strangers. Findings regarding social responsibility and reciprocal concessions were inconclusive, with high correlations between perceptions of negotiation and guilt as well as guilt and obligation. The researchers suggest that both of the explanations work together in the DITF effect. Self-presentation In a similar study looking at differences between friends and strangers using the DITF technique, the DITF technique was more effective in increasing compliance for friends than strangers, which is contrary to other research findings. The researcher explains the results as evidence for the importance of self-presentation when friends use the DITF technique. They suggest that the respondents' need to present themselves well to their friends motivates compliance to the second request. Guilt reduction Research on the influence of guilt indicates that it plays an important role in the effectiveness of the DITF technique. Participants began the study by filling out a questionnaire related to demographics and health. The experimenter then told the participant he or she was finished with the experiment. As the participant was leaving, the experimenter asked the participant to record meals for the next three months as a part of a larger study on health. After refusal, the experimenter then made a second smaller request for the participant to record their meals for four days. There was a control condition that only received the second smaller request. Participants were assigned to one of four groups: high guilt induction and high guilt reduction, high guilt induction and low guilt reduction, low guilt induction and high guilt reduction, and low guilt induction and low guilt reduction. The high guilt induction statement indicated that the rejection of the first request would have negative effects on the study, while the low guilt induction statement indicated that the rejection of the first request would not really have negative effects on the study. The high guilt reduction statement indicated that the second request would be equally helpful as the first, while the low guilt reduction statement indicated that the second request would not be as helpful as the first. Researchers measured both verbal and behavioral compliance to the smaller second request. Findings indicate a significant increase in both types of compliance for the high guilt induction, high guilt reduction condition. There was no DITF effect for the other conditions because compliance to the second request was the same as compliance for the control condition. According to the researcher, this suggests that guilt is the sole explanation for the effectiveness of the DITF technique. Recent research Metacommunication In a study looking at the DITF technique, researchers found that DITF requests that required metacommunication in the responses had higher rates of compliance than requests that did not. The researchers define metacommunication as establishing social boundaries. This is important because the DITF technique often involves strangers making extreme requests, which might elicit a response that requires metacommunication. For example, a person may use metacommunication to indicate that it is inappropriate that a stranger make such an extreme request. This study included four different groups: one starting with a large request and including a metacommunicative statement, one starting with a large request and excluding a metacommunicative statement, one with only a smaller request and including a metacommunicative statement, and one with only a smaller request and excluding a metacommunicative statement. For all of the groups a confederate asked participants to fill out a questionnaire about campus activities. The large request required a few hours, while the smaller one required 20 minutes. In the groups that started with a large request, the confederate followed up with the smaller one after a refusal. The requests with metacommunication included a sentence stating, \\"This is kind of awkward. There is something else I'd like to ask of you, but tell me if even this seems inappropriate between strangers\\" prior to filling out the 20-minute questionnaire (p. 92). Results show significantly greater compliance to requests that included the metacommunicative statement. The researchers suggest that the explicit statement regarding social boundaries makes participants comply to avoid engaging in metacommunicative conflict. Reverse psychology Research investigating reverse psychology showed that participants used the DITF technique in their everyday lives. They also use other reverse psychology tactics, such as FITD. There were two studies that looked at participants' own experiences using reverse psychology, which these researchers refer to as strategic self-anticonformity. The first study consisted of an open-ended questionnaire that asked participants about instances in which they used strategic self-anticonformity. The second study asked about specific instances of different types of strategic self-anti- conformity, like DITF and FITD. Findings indicate that most of the participants could provide examples of their own use of reverse psychology tactics and that a likely explanation for this is a need for social reassurance. Monetary solicitation A study looking at behavioral, not just verbal, compliance to donate money found that the DITF technique was effective. The study involved male and female confederates who ordered lemonade at a restaurant and engaged in conversation before the male announced loudly that he was leaving to buy a part for his bicycle. After he left the female confederate expressed aloud that the male did not pay and asked the participant sitting near her to pay the total bill. In the DITF condition, the female confederate asked if the participant would pay part of the bill after a refusal to pay the total bill from every participant. In the control condition the female confederate only made the second smaller request. The DITF technique yielded significantly more behavioral compliance than the control, which shows that the DITF technique works for more than just verbal agreement. Retail A study looking at the DITF technique in retail found that it was very effective in increasing sales. In this study the experimenter sold cheese to people walking past a hut in the Austrian Alps. The experimenter rotated between five conditions: a DITF condition in which the experimenter first tried to sell two pounds of cheese at eight euros and then one pound of cheese at four euros, a DITF condition with an emphasis on concession in which the experimenter said that two pounds was probably too much anyway, a DITF condition with an emphasis on credibility of the experimenter, who wore traditional clothes and spoke in a mountain dialect, a DITF condition with both an emphasis on concession and credibility, and a control condition in which the experimenter only made the smaller second request. Results show increased compliance for the second request in all of the DITF conditions compared to the control. The DITF condition with an emphasis on concession and credibility had the largest increase in compliance. The researchers suggest that the DITF technique could be useful in other retail settings. Researchers investigated the DITF technique in a restaurant setting and found that it is effective if there is no delay between the first and second requests. Waitresses were instructed to ask randomly selected restaurant patrons whether they wanted dessert at the end of their meals. If the participant refused, the waitress then either immediately asked if the participant wanted tea or coffee or waited three minutes to ask. Findings indicate increased compliance to the second request for the immediate condition but not the delayed one. The researchers suggest that these results have significant implications for the restaurant industry, particularly the importance of servers' timing when the restaurant is busy. Academics In a study looking at compliance techniques for children to complete academic work, researchers found that the DITF technique was most effective. The study had three groups of 2nd grade participants: the FITD, DITF, and control groups. The FITD group was asked by one teacher to do an easy 15-question worksheet and then asked 15 minutes later by another teacher to complete a 20-question worksheet. The DITF group was initially asked to complete a 100-question worksheet. After refusal, the group was asked to do 20 of the questions. The control group was asked to complete a 20-question worksheet. The researchers looked at compliance as well as students' mathematical ability, quality of work, and amount of help needed. Results show that the DITF technique was effective in increasing compliance rates compared to the FITD and control conditions. The DITF group also needed less adult help to complete the worksheet. Overall, the researchers suggest that DITF can be a useful technique to get students to do their academic work. Technology Research on the DITF effect in internet fundraising indicates that the DITF technique works in an electronic context. This study looked at donations for children victims of mine injuries. The homepage of the website provided pictures of children with injuries. In the control condition, the homepage asked for donations and redirected participants to a page with a picture and several links to outside charitable organizations. In the DITF condition, the homepage asked participants to help the children in the photographs. The link redirected participants to a page that asked them to spend several hours a week finding people to donate to the site. There were links to respond to the question on the page. After a refusal, the participants were redirected to the same page as the control group, which had links to outside charities. The researcher measured numbers of clicks on these links, not actual donations. Results show that participants in the DITF condition were more willing to click on the outside links than those in the control condition. The researcher highlights that these results indicate DITF technique can be effective in electronic contexts. In a study investigating the effectiveness of the FITD and DITF techniques in a virtual world, researchers found that both techniques worked to increase compliance. The study occurred in a virtual world called \\"There.com\\", where users create avatars to interact with other users' avatars. In the DITF condition, the experimenter approached another user's avatar and asked for a moderate request, which involved taking a screenshot of 50 different locations. After refusal, the experimenter gave the smaller request, which was to take one screenshot. In the FITD condition, the experimenter started with the smaller request and then gave the moderate one. The control condition involved only the smaller request. For half of the participants, the experimenter's avatar was dark-skinned and for the other half the avatar was light-skinned. Findings indicate that both the FITD and DITF techniques increased compliance to the second request compared to the control condition, although the DITF technique was less effective for the dark-skinned avatar. There was no skin color effect for the FITD condition. The researchers suggest that these results illustrate social carryover from real-life to the virtual world. DITF vs. FITD A meta-analysis of findings from 22 studies comparing the DITF and FITD techniques indicated that there were no significant differences in effectiveness of the two techniques. Overall, they both produced similar rates of compliance across many studies that employed comparable target requests. Combining DITF and FITD In a set of studies about compliance methods, the researcher found evidence for the effectiveness of the \\"foot-in-the-face\\" (FITF) technique, which combines the DITF and FITD techniques. The FITF technique involves two moderately difficult requests that are equally demanding. Study 1: Confederates asked one group of participants to read temperature and another to read air pressure. Regardless of whether the participants complied with the first request, they were given a second one. One group read temperature first and the other air pressure. Results show that participants were more likely to agree to the second request following the first than the second request in isolation, regardless of whether it was to read the temperature or air pressure. There were participants who complied with both requests, but there were also participants who complied to the second, but not the first request. Study 2: This study was very similar to the first, except one group was given the second request immediately after the first, while another group was given the second request two to three days after the first. The requests were to complete a questionnaire or to tape record a section out of a book. Findings indicate that the delay between requests was more effective for participants who complied to the first request, while the immediate request was more effective for those who rejected the first request. Study 3: This study used the same requests from the study 2. Confederates made the second request immediately to participants who rejected the first but waited two to three days for those who complied with the first request. Results show that overall there was significantly greater compliance to the second request and that participants who agreed to the first were more likely to agree to the second than those who rejected the initial request. These three studies provide evidence to support the effectiveness of the FITD technique because it increased compliance in all three experiments. The researcher suggests that the FITD technique may be preferable to DITF because it does not place as much pressure on people to comply.

The term was borrowed from Friedrich Schiller by Max Weber to describe the character of modernized, bureaucratic, secularized Western society.Jenkins, Richard. 2000. \\"Disenchantment, Enchantment and Re-Enchantment.\\" Max Weber Studies 1(1):11–32. . In Western society, according to Weber, scientific understanding is more highly valued than belief, and processes are oriented toward rational goals, as opposed to traditional society, whereby \\"the world remains a great enchanted garden.\\"Weber, Max.

Philosophy in an Age of Terror. p. 69. Jürgen Habermas has subsequently striven to find a positive foundation for modernity in the face of disenchantment, even while appreciating Weber's recognition of how far secular society was created from, and is still \\"haunted by the ghosts of dead religious beliefs.\\"Smith, Murray E. G. 1998. Early Modern Social Theory. p. 274. Some have seen the disenchantment of the world as a call for existentialist commitment and individual responsibility before a collective normative void.Embree, L.. ed. 1999. Schutzian Social Science. pp. 110–11.  Sacralization and desacralization  Disenchantment is related to the notion of desacralization, whereby the structures and institutions that previously channeled spiritual belief into rituals that promoted collective identities came under attack and waned in popularity. According to Henri Hubert and Marcel Mauss, the ritual of sacrifice involved two processes: sacralization and desacralization. The process of sacralization endows a profane offering with sacred properties—consecration—which provides a bridge of communication between the worlds of the sacred and profane. Once the sacrifice has been made, the ritual must be desacralized in order to return the worlds of the sacred and profane to their proper places.Bell, Catherine. 1997. Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Disenchantment operates on a macro-level, rather than the micro-level of sacralization. It also destroys part of the process whereby the chaotic social elements that require sacralization in the first place continue with mere knowledge as their antidote. Therefore, disenchantment can be related to Émile Durkheim's concept of anomie: an unmooring of the individual from the ties that bind in society. Re-enchantment In recent years, Weber's paradigm has been challenged by thinkers who see a process of re-enchantment operating alongside that of disenchantment.Landy, Joshua, and Michael Saler, eds. 2009. The Re-Enchantment of the World: Secular Magic in a Rational Age. Stanford University Press. Thus, enchantment is used to fundamentally change how even low-paid service work is experienced.Endrissat, Nada, Gazi Islam, and Claus Noppeney. 2015. \\"Enchanting Work: New Spirits of Service Work in an Organic Supermarket.\\" Organization Studies 36(11):1555–76. . Carl Jung considered symbols to provide a means for the numinous to return from the unconscious to the desacralized worldC. G. Jung, Man and his Symbols (1978) p. 83-94—a means for the recovery of myth, and the sense of wholeness it once provided, to a disenchanted modernity.Casement, Ann. 2007. Who Owns Jung?. p. 20. Ernest Gellner argued that, although disenchantment was the inevitable product of modernity, many people just could not stand a disenchanted world, and therefore opted for various \\"re-enchantment creeds,\\" such as psychoanalysis, Marxism, Wittgensteinianism, phenomenology, and ethnomethodology. A noticeable feature of these re-enchantment creeds is that they all tried to make themselves compatible with naturalism: i.e., they did not refer to supernatural forces.Hall, John A. 2010. Ernest Gellner: An Intellectual Biography. Verso. Disenchantment as myth American historian of religion Jason Josephson- Storm has challenged mainstream sociological and historical interpretations of both the concept of disenchantment and of reenchantment, labeling the former as a \\"myth.\\" Josephson-Storm argues that there has not been a decline in belief in magic or mysticism in Western Europe or the United States, even after adjusting for religious belief, education, and class. He further argues that many influential theorists of disenchantment, including Weber and some members of the Frankfurt School, were not only aware of modern European magical and occult movements, but consciously engaged with them. Foundational theorists of disenchantment, such as Weber and James George Frazer, did not envision a rigid binary between rationality or rationalization and magical thinking, nor did they describe a process of \\"reenchantment\\" to reverse or compensate for disenchantment.Josephson-Storm, Jason. 2017. Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences. University of Chicago Press. . According to Josephson-Storm, this information necessitates a re-interpretation of Weber's idea of disenchantment as referring more to the sequestering and professionalization of magic.

Eva Rothschild was born in Dublin, Ireland. She received a BA in Fine Art from the University of Ulster, Belfast (1990–93), and an MA in Fine Art from Goldsmith's College, London (1997–99). Her work is predominantly sculptural and she works across a range of materials including aluminium, jesmonite, leather, fabric and perspex. She has a materials based studio practice but also works on major public and outdoor commissions. Her work references the art movements of the 1960s and 1970s, such as Minimalism and is also informed by the contemporary aesthetics of protest and spirituality. In 2014 she was elected Royal Academician. Rothschild's work has been the subject of institutional solo exhibitions including Australian Centre for Contemporary Art (2018), Dublin City Gallery, the Hugh Lane (2014), Nasher Sculpture Center (2012), The Hepworth Wakefield (2011), South London Gallery (2007), and Kunsthalle Zürich (2004). In 2009 she was awarded the Tate Britain annual Duveens' Commission, for which she produced Cold Corners, a vast rambling geometric sculpture that occupied the length of the neo-classical galleries. Rothschild's works are held by major public collections including MoMA, New York, Arts Council of England, Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, Tate, and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis.

The Globe and Mail. Toronto, Ont.: Sep 22, 2007. pg. D.17  Early life  McKay was born and raised in the town of Stellarton, Nova Scotia, where he graduated from Stellarton High School in 1982. He grew up in the small working class Stellarton neighborhood called the Red Row, a neighborhood of hundred-year-old mining company duplexes and a tight-knit community of working-class people. His parents grew up in the same neighborhood. His mother, Georgina Bellick, was the daughter of Eastern European immigrants. His father, Leo McKay Sr., who lived in the Red Row until his death in 2011, was a riveter at the railcar factory in nearby Trenton before becoming a career labour leader, social activist, New Democrat politician, and eventually a member of Stellarton Town Council. He studied English at St. Francis Xavier University, French at Laval, Creative Writing at the University of British Columbia and Education at Dalhousie. He lived in Asia for four years.  Career  McKay teaches English at Cobequid Educational Centre in Truro, Nova Scotia.Cobequid Educational Centre Faculty, cec.ccrsb.ca, Retrieved May 20, 2008. McKay became one of the first recognized literary writers to embrace social media. During the 2010 CBC Canada Reads competition, McKay used Facebook, Twitter and especially YouTube, to promote his 2003 novel Twenty-Six as one of the Best Canadian Novels of the previous decade. He used hand-shot, self-produced videos called \\"Twenty-six Reasons Why You Should Vote for Twenty-Six For Canada Reads 2010\\". The novel made the 40 book long list, and that success spurred McKay to further use of social media as a promotional tool. In the spring of 2012, McKay used an online funding site, Indiegogo.com, to fund the independent publication of a new novel, Roll Up the Rim. That campaign raised $10,000 in 30 days, and was chosen by Indiegogo.com as an example of how to run a successful online funding campaign.  Recognition  McKay's debut short story collection, Like This, was short-listed for the Giller Prize in 1995 and received the Dartmouth Book Award for fiction in 1996.Dartmouth Book Awards Winners , halifax.ca, Retrieved May 20, 2008.

Many items were listed on the agenda for the two-week-long session of the National People's Congress. 2,937 delegates from every province, municipality, and Special Administrative Region were in attendance. The 2006 Session was chaired by Standing Committee Chairman Wu Bangguo. The National People's Congress is the People's Republic of China's highest legislative body. The congress is composed of members from the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a coalition of nine parties. In practice the final vote on legislation is nearly always close to unanimous, and legislative practice has been to achieve consensus before the final vote including the approval of senior officials of the Communist Party of China and the State Council of the People's Republic of China. Because of this practice, controversial items can be removed from the NPC agenda if there is serious disagreement over the contents of the legislation. This occurred this session with the Property Law of the People's Republic of China which was originally scheduled for approval this year but was dropped after objections from the Leftist party members who argued that the draft did not sufficiently protect state assets. Formal issues listed for discussion include the \\"Three Rural Issues\\" from agricultural reform, cracking down on corruption, and studying the Three Represents as the guide for Chinese policy in the days ahead. Formally, Premier Wen Jiabao made the annual government report to the Congress outlining government policy and its progress from 2005. The Eleventh Five-Year Plan will undergo review. A Budget will be drafted for the following fiscal year. NPC Standing Committee Chairman Wu Bangguo will review the work of the NPC Standing Committee from last year. The Judiciary system will also make its respective reports. In official Chinese news, the phrase \\"core of leadership\\" has been omitted when describing Hu Jintao. This came in stark contrast to the repetitive \\"unify under the core of leadership under Jiang Zemin\\" slogan used frequently in China during his years in power. Vice-Premier Huang Ju was absent because of health problems.  Wen Jiabao's government report  Premier Wen Jiabao delivered the PRC government's 2006 Working Report on the morning of March 5 at the Great Hall of the People. It was nationally televised on four CCTV channels and other networks. The report was around two hours in length. The three sections of the report outlined the government's workings in 2005, the direction the government was planning for the new year, and a brief outline of China's 11th Five-Year Plan. Agriculture and the \\"Three Rural Issues\\" policy was emphasized throughout the speech, as was the concept of \\"Governing for the People\\" (执政为民). Wen heavily emphasized helping the poor and relieving the wealth gap. Wen announced that agricultural taxes levied regularly on peasants would be fully abolished in 2007. On the issue of health, Wen stressed the need to prevent an avian influenza-related epidemic, and warned people to be cautious of the outbreak and exercise common sense. Many Chinese political analysts concluded that the report was thorough, detailed, thoughtful, and reached out to the people. Western media outlets were mostly neutral on the issue. It was considered to have contained fewer political overtones than in previous years. Although Wen's speech was met with frequent applause, the longest applause came during Wen's mention of the firm stance against Taiwan independence. Wen favoured peaceful re-unification, but stated that the Chinese government will not back down should Taiwanese authorities go \\"too far\\", as has been his position for the previous two years.  Issues discussed  Science and technology was a main issue talking point, and there was consensus that China should continue to move forward with their development. Many deputies have shown concern about the urban-rural wealth gap. Critics say women's rights issues have been ignored, noting that the marital rape bill was shot down. New legislation was passed to prevent disabled persons from being discriminated against in education. Noticeably, the Anti-Secession Law was not mentioned any time during the Sessions, as China wishes to present a more friendly image to the Taiwanese people, in order to promote a peaceful reunification.

Birth and early life  George Guest was born in Bangor, Gwynedd. His father was an organist and Guest assisted him by acting as organ blower. He became a chorister at Bangor Cathedral and subsequently at Chester Cathedral, where he took organ lessons from the sub- organist, Dr. Roland Middleton. He passed the examinations for ARCO in 1940 and FRCO in 1942. By this time he had become the organist and choirmaster of Connah's Quay parish church, Flintshire. Being proud of his Welsh roots, from the 1970s onwards, Guest took a personal interest in the Cambridge University Welsh Society (Cymdeithas Y Mabinogi), sponsoring many of its events and providing a welcome face for Welsh students away from home. At the age of 18 he was called up for military service, and joined the Royal Air Force, being posted to India in 1945. On leaving the services in 1947 he took up the post of sub-organist at Chester Cathedral. The cathedral organist, Malcolm Boyle, encouraged him to apply for the organ scholarship at St John's College, Cambridge, for which he was successful. At Cambridge he studied under Robin Orr. In his final year as Organ Scholar, Robin Orr announced that he intended to retire, and the College Council offered the post to Guest.  Organist and Choirmaster at St John's College  Within five years of Guest becoming organist and choirmaster, the whole future of the choir at St. John's College came into question, with the proposed closure of the day school which provided the choristers. Guest, with the support of his predecessor, persuaded the College to fund a Choir School. Under George Guest's direction, the choir built up a formidable reputation, challenging the supremacy of the choir of King's College, Cambridge. Guest introduced a more \\"continental\\" tone into the choir, as George Malcolm was doing at Westminster Cathedral. The choir began broadcasting on the BBC in the early 1950s and started making recordings in 1958. By the time of Guest's retirement in 1991, the choir had recorded sixty LPs or CDs under his direction. The BBC has broadcast Evensong from St. John's College on every Ash Wednesday since 1972, and the Advent Carol Service each year since 1981. During George Guest's tenure, the choir undertook many overseas tours. In 1987 Guest was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the Queen's Birthday Honours. Herbert Howells and Michael Tippett are among the many composers who wrote liturgical settings for the St. John's College choir whilst George Guest was organist and choirmaster. They also include the French composer Jean Langlais, who wrote a setting of the psalm Beatus vir for the choir: a rare occurrence of a Continental composer writing for the English cathedral tradition. Organ Scholars who studied under George Guest include: * Sir David Lumsden (Southwell Minster, New College, Oxford, Principal of the Royal Academy of Music, London) * Brian Runnett (organist, Norwich Cathedral) * Jonathan Bielby (organist, Wakefield Cathedral) * Jonathan Rennert (St Michael's, Cornhill) * David Hill (choral director) (sub-organist, Durham Cathedral; organist, Westminster Cathedral; organist, Winchester Cathedral; organist and choirmaster, St John's College, Cambridge; now Chief Conductor, BBC Singers) * Robert Huw Morgan (University Organist, Stanford Memorial Church) * Adrian Lucas (organist, Worcester Cathedral) * Andrew Lumsden (Southwark Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, Lichfield Cathedral, Winchester Cathedral) * Sir Stephen Cleobury (King's College, Cambridge) * John Scott (St Paul's Cathedral, London, and subsequently St Thomas Fifth Avenue, New York City) * Andrew Nethsingha (Truro Cathedral; Gloucester Cathedral; Organist and Director of Music, St John's College, Cambridge)  Miscellaneous  George Guest was a guest on Desert Island Discs in 1976 (http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island- discs/castaway/a5168c08#p009n0jz). He was a lifelong supporter of Chester City FC. The famous British baritone Simon Keenlyside was a chorister and subsequently a choral scholar in the choir of St John's College, Cambridge while George Guest was the choirmaster there. Actor Clive Mantle was another chorister at St. John's. References *obituary The Guardian *Guest, George (1994) A Guest at Cambridge, Paraclete Press .

The Giants' catcher, Hank Gowdy, dropped his protective mask to field the ball but, failing to toss the mask aside, stumbled over it and dropped the ball, thus giving Ruel another chance to bat. On the next pitch, Ruel hit a double and, then proceeded to score the winning run when Earl McNeely hit a ground ball that took a bad hop over third baseman Freddie Lindstrom's head. Ruel had another good season in 1925, producing a .310 batting average along with 54 runs batted in and, for the third consecutive year, he led American League catchers in assists and putouts.1925 American League Fielding Leaders at Baseball Reference The Senators would win the American League pennant for the second year in a row, however they were defeated by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1925 World Series.1925 World Series at Baseball Reference Ruel hit for a .299 batting average in 1926 and led the American League catchers with a .989 fielding percentage, as the Senators slipped to a fourth-place finish.

He possessed strong defensive skills, leading American League catchers in fielding percentage three consecutive years (1926–28), finishing with a .982 career fielding percentage.Baseball Digest, July 2001, Vol. 60, No. 7, Ruel also led American League catchers three times in putouts and assists and twice in range factor and in baserunners caught stealing. He made 23 double plays in 1924, the seventh highest season total for catchers in major league history.Catchers fielding records at The Encyclopedia of Catchers His reputation as a defensive stand out is enhanced because of the era in which he played. In the Deadball Era, catchers played a huge defensive role, given the large number of bunts and stolen base attempts, as well as the difficulty of handling the spitball pitchers who dominated pitching staffs.For Catchers, The Name of the Game is Defense, by George Vass, Baseball Digest, May 2005, Vol. 64, No. 3, Richard Kendall of the Society for American Baseball Research devised an unscientific study that ranked Ruel as the fifth most dominating fielding catcher in major league history.Dominating Fielding Catchers at The Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers Post-playing career After retiring as a player, Ruel spent a decade as a coach with the Chicago White Sox from 1935 to 1945.Tigers Under New Farm Ruel, by Frank Lewis, Baseball Digest, January 1952, He then became an assistant to Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler in .

He was later named as the director of the Detroit Tigers' farm system before taking on the role as the Tigers' general manager from 1954 to 1956. Ruel was one of the few major leaguers to hold a law degree. He earned his degree from Washington University in St. Louis and was admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court. Ruel is credited for being the first to label the catcher's protective equipment as the \\"tools of ignorance\\". This was a self deprecating reference to the harsh, physical demands of the catcher's position due to the exposure to the errant balls, foul tips and collisions at home plate. He is buried at Alta Mesa Memorial Park in Palo Alto, California.

The dancers, standing in several rows, may be further choreographed to execute different figures (including tamau, varu, otamu, ami, and fa'arapu) while maintaining the hip-shaking. The hip motion itself may in some choreographies be synchronized amongst multiple dancers and may be further coordinated with the accompanying percussion arrangement. The dance is with music only (drums) at a fast rhythm, and no singing. The drum can be one of the different types of the tōere, a lying log of wood with a longitudinal slit, which is struck by one or two sticks. Additional drum types accompanying the dance may include the ng drum covered with a shark skin and struck by the hands or with sticks) played at a slower rhythm, or the smaller faatētē drum. The ōtea is one of the few dances which already existed in pre-European times as a male dance. (The hura (Tahitian vernacular for hula), a dance for women, on the other hand has disappeared, and likewise is gone the couple's dance upaupa but which may have reemerged as the tāmūrē). Nowadays, however the ōtea can be danced by men (ōtea tāne), by women (ōtea vahine), or by both genders (ōtea āmui = united ō.). Dancers of the ōtea make gestures reenacting daily occupations of life. For the men the gestural themes can be chosen from warfare or sailing, and then they may use spears or paddles. For women the gestural themes are typically closer to home or from nature: hand gestures suggesting combing their hair, or the flight of a butterfly. More elaborate themes have been adopted; for example one where the dancers end up in a map of Tahiti, highlighting important places. In a proper ōtea the story of the theme should pervade the whole dance. The costumes are extremely elaborate, typically incorporating long plant fiber (\\"grass\\") skirts, belting with tassels that accentuate the hip-motion, may further include decorated headpieces, and may be color-coordinated across the dancers of the company. The same more dress and the same shaking of the knees for the boys and those of the hips for the girls as in all Tahitian dances (see tāmūrē) is used here too. Modern and adoptive interpretation Interpretations of the ōtea are frequently included as part of larger Polynesian dance recitals presented at luaus and visitor- oriented live shows in the Hawaiian Islands and other Pacific-rim resorts outside Tahiti. Modern interpretations include costumes fashioned of contemporary man-made materials (polyester films such as mylar, or synthetic twines) substituting for plant-fiber or natural materials, and costume coloration such as fluorescent pinks and greens or mirror-reflective surfaces difficult to obtain or maintain from purely natural resources. Modern drum accompaniments may include drums of European- or non-Pacific construction, improvised percussion instruments of modern materials (e.g. high-density polyethylene or metallic commercial food packaging), and the use of prerecorded drum reinforcement soundtracks.

Specifically, a Boolean function is said to be correlation-immune of order m if every subset of m or fewer variables in x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n is statistically independent of the value of f(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n).  Definition  A function f:\\\\mathbb{F}_2^n\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{F}_2 is k-th order correlation immune if for any independent n binary random variables X_0\\\\ldots X_{n-1}, the random variable Z=f(X_0,\\\\ldots,X_{n-1}) is independent from any random vector (X_{i_1}\\\\ldots X_{i_k}) with 0\\\\leq i_1<\\\\ldots.  Results in cryptography  When used in a stream cipher as a combining function for linear feedback shift registers, a Boolean function with low-order correlation-immunity is more susceptible to a correlation attack than a function with correlation immunity of high order. Siegenthaler showed that the correlation immunity m of a Boolean function of algebraic degree d of n variables satisfies m + d ≤ n; for a given set of input variables, this means that a high algebraic degree will restrict the maximum possible correlation immunity. Furthermore, if the function is balanced then m + d ≤ n − 1. References Further reading # Cusick, Thomas W. & Stanica, Pantelimon (2009). \\"Cryptographic Boolean functions and applications\\".

It is composed of five different organisms: three bacterial ectosymbionts live on its surface for locomotion and at least one endosymbiont lives inside to help digest cellulose in wood to produce acetate for its host(s). Mixotricha lost their mitochondria but retained both organelles and nuclear genes derived from them. Discovery The name was given by the Australian biologist J.L. Sutherland, who first described Mixotricha in 1933.Jean L. Sutherland: Protozoa from Australian Termites. Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science, Band s2-76, S. 145-173. (Abstract)L. R. Cleveland, A. V. Grimstone: The Fine Structure of the Flagellate Mixotricha paradoxa and Its Associated Micro- Organisms. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences, Band 159, 1964, S. 668-686. The name means \\"the paradoxical being with mixed-up hairs\\" because this protist has both cilia and flagella, which was not supposed to be the case with protists where they were supposed to have one or the other.  Behavior  Mixotricha is a species of protozoan that lives inside the gut of the Australian termite species Mastotermes darwiniensis and has multiple bacterial symbionts. Mixotricha is a large protozoan long and contains hundreds of thousands of bacteria. Is an endosymbiont and digests cellulose for the termite. Trichomonads like Mixotricha reproduce by a special form of longitudinal fission, leading to large numbers of trophozoites in a relatively short time. Cysts never form, so transmission from one host to another is always based on direct contact between the sites they occupy.  Anatomy  Species of the order Trichomonadida typically have four to six flagella at the cell's apical pole, one of which is recurrent - that is, it runs along a surface wave, giving the aspect of an undulating membrane. Mixotricha paradoxa have four weak flagella that serve as rudders. It has four large flagella at the front end, three pointing forwards and one backward. The basal bodies are also bacteria, not spirochaetes but oval, pill-shaped bacteria. There is a one-to-one relationship between bracket, spirochaete, and basal bacterium. Each bracket has one spirochaete running through it, and one pill bacterium at its base as the basal body. It has not been shown definitely, but the basal bodies could also be making cellulases that digest wood.  Endosymbionts for biochemical processes At least one endosymbiont lives inside the protist to help digest cellulose and lignin, a major component of the wood the termites eat. The cellulose gets converted to glucose then to acetate, and the lignin is digested directly to acetate. The acetate probably crosses the termite gut membrane to be digested later. Mixotricha forms a mutualistic relationships with bacteria living inside the termite. There are a total of four species of bacterial symbionts. It has spherical bacteria inside the cell, which function as mitochondria, which Mixotricha lacks. Mixotricha lost their mitochondria but retained both organelles and nuclear genes derived from them. Mitochondrial relics include hydrogenosomes which produce hydrogen and small structures called mitosomes. Ectosymbionts for movement Three surface colonising bacteria are anchored on the surface. The flagella and cilia are actually two different single celled organisms. The ciliate belongs to an archaic group that used to be called archezoa but this term is no longer in fashion. It has four weak flagella, which serve as a rudder. While Mixotricha has four anterior flagella, it does not use them for locomotion, but more for steering. For locomotion, about 250,000 hairlike Treponema spirochaetes, a species of helical bacteria, are attached to the cell surface and provide the cell with cilia-like movements. The wavelength of the cilia is about and suggests that the spirochaetes are somehow in touch with each other. Mixotricha also has rod-shaped bacteria arranged in an ordered pattern on the surface of the cell. Each spirochaete has its own little emplacement, called a 'bracket'. Spirochetes move continuously forwards or backwards but when they are attached they move in one direction. Sperm tails might have their origin in spirochaetes. The evidence that cilia (undulipodia) are symbiotic bacteria is found unpersuasive.  Genome  Mixotricha have five genomes, as they form very close symbiotic relationships with four types of bacteria. It is a good example organism for symbiogenesis and nestedness. There are two spirochete and one rod bacteria on its surface, one endosymbiotic bacteria inside to digest cellulose and the host nucleus.

McCrary was a two-time Pro Bowler in 1998 and 1999. McCrary was inducted to the Ravens Ring of Honor in 2004. McCrary is now doing commentary for the Ravens on WBAL-AM. Early years When McCrary was a young boy his mother wanted to place him in a day care which was located across the street from his home. However, it wasn't racially integrated and she sued the day care to allow Michael's admittance. The case went to the United States Supreme Court Runyon v. McCrary in 1976. One of the justices who dissented was former football star Byron \\"Whizzer\\" White; a quarter-century later, in 2000, McCrary won the Byron \\"Whizzer\\" White NFL Man of the Year Award. He later attended George C. Marshall High School in Fairfax County, Virginia. College career McCrary played college football at Wake Forest University from 1989–92, setting school records for sacks in a season (16) and in a career (30), records he still holds. When being scouted by NFL scouts they found his vertical leap was measured at 36 inches; and at 250 pounds, he came in at 4.59 seconds in the 40-yard sprint. Professional career McCrary was drafted in the seventh round by the Seattle Seahawks in the 1993 NFL Draft. He spent four seasons as a defensive end as well as playing on special teams before leaving the team to head to Baltimore following the 1996 season. McCrary played the starting role with the Ravens at defensive end during the 1998 season playing alongside left defensive end, Rob Burnett, veteran defensive tackles, Tony Siragusa, Keith Washington, and backup Tackle, Mike Frederick. In 1998, McCrary lead the team in quarterback sacks, and he finished second on the team in tackles. That same year he was elected to the pro bowl along with five other Ravens' teammates, Bennie Thompson, Peter Boulware, Jermaine Lewis, Ray Lewis, and Johnathan Odgen. McCrary was placed 2nd on franchise sack list, now 3rd behind Terrell Suggs (125 QB sacks) and Peter Boulware (70 QB sacks). Due to various injuries, McCrary retired following the 2002 season, ending his stint with the Ravens. Retirement On August 21, 2003, McCrary announced his retirement.

He had only started racing in 1930, running a Lorraine-Dietrich in sporadic local events in Algeria. In 1932 he was noticed by Marcel Lehoux, the owner of a large trade company in Algeria and a successful Grand Prix driver in his own right; Lehoux was convinced of Moll's talents and offered Moll his Bugatti for the Oran and Casablanca Grands Prix. Moll took the lead from the start in Oran, only to fall back to second and then retire, then retired again in Casablanca. Lehoux, undeterred, brought Moll to France for his first taste of continental racing for the Marseilles Grand Prix at Miramas; Moll finished a sensational third, trailing the Alfa Romeos of Raymond Sommer and Tazio Nuvolari.Twite, Mike. \\"Moll: The Grand Prix race ace from Algeria\\", in Northey, Tom, editor.

Moll then used family money to obtain an Alfa Romeo 8C2300.Twite, p.1380. Despite it being less potent than the Alfa P3s run by the likes of Scuderia Ferrari, Moll came third at Nimes (behind Étancelin and Nuvolari), Miramas, Comminges, and Nice, and scored a near-win in the Marne Grand Prix at Reims.

Moll also won the Avusrennen at with his Alfa Romeo in streamlined configuration (powered by a 3.2 liter) when a dominant performance from rookie team Auto Union ended with Hans Stuck's clutch failure. Moll finished third in the French Grand Prix at Montlhéry, following Chiron home, while coming second at the Targa Florio and Coppa Ciano, trailing teammate Varzi both times. On a wet and windy Pescara Circuit for the Coppa Acerbo in August, running second and chasing Luigi Fagioli for the lead, Moll lost control at near top speed on a narrow straightaway while passing Ernst Henne's Mercedes. Moll's P3 went into a ditch and crashed into a bridge, and he succumbed to his injuries shortly thereafter. The cause of the wreck remains unknown. Even though he had such a short career, Enzo Ferrari ranked Moll one of the best drivers he had ever seen, and believed he could have become one of the best ever.

The event was a vigorous debate on feminism with Norman Mailer, author; Germaine Greer, author; Diana Trilling, literary critic; and Jacqueline Ceballos, National Organization for Women president. The event was also billed as an intellectual \\"Battle of the Sexes\\" – effectively promoting Mailer's then-just-published, feminism-critical book Prisoner of Sex (1971). In the middle of this jam- packed event, Johnston came onstage with two feminist friends. Johnston read a poem, after which the three women simulated (fully dressed) three-way lesbian sex (indulging in a bit of feminist Guerilla theatre, which she admitted she had learned from the Yippies) and quickly exited. Despite this colorful interruption, Greer and Mailer continued to exchange verbal blows with each other (and the audience) for the remainder of the 3½ hour event. This event was widely written about (since so many writers were in attendance, including Susan Sontag and Cynthia Ozick) and filmed by the now-legendary documentary filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker,\\"Town Bloody Hall  Pennebaker Hegedus Films\\". phfilms.com. Retrieved 2017-04-01. eventually becoming the cult-documentary titled Town Bloody Hall. As this incident illustrates, Johnston's self- described \\"east west flower child beat hip psychedelic paradise now love peace do your own thing approach to the revolution\\" (as she called it in Lesbian Nation) often confounded her feminist allies as much as it did the conservative foes of gay and lesbian liberation. In 1973, she predicted \\"an end to the catastrophic brotherhood and a return to the former glory and wise equanimity of the matriarchies.\\" As recorded in Lesbian Nation, Johnston often was at the center of controversies within the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s. She famously went on record stating that \\"all women are lesbians except those that don't know it yet.\\" Johnston was also one of the first countercultural and lesbian writers at Ms. magazine, eventually coming to the conclusion that the magazine was too mainstream, ultimately presenting feminism as palatable, family-friendly and safe. According to author Vivian Gornick: > For radical feminists like me, Ellen Willis, and Jill Johnston, we had a > different kind of magazine in mind. We came out against marriage and > motherhood. Gloria Steinem was uptown; we were downtown. She hung out with > Establishment figures; we had only ourselves. It very quickly became obvious > at that first meeting that they wanted a glossy that would appeal to the > women who read the Ladies' Home Journal. We didn't want that, so they walked > away with it. On another occasion, Johnston grew bored at a poolside press conference given by feminist Betty Friedan, and so decided to strip off her top and take a swim. In 1977, Johnson became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Johnston's career as a dance critic was hampered by the controversy that attended the publication of Lesbian Nation and the publicity engendered by her dramatic style of lesbian feminist activism. She remained with The Village Voice until 1981 and subsequently wrote freelance art and literary criticism. Along with the political memoirs, Lesbian Nation and Gullible's Travels, Johnston published an anthology of dance criticism entitled Marmalade Me as well as the autobiographies Mother Bound and Paper Daughter. Described by one critic as \\"part Gertrude Stein, part E. E. Cummings, with a dash of Jack Kerouac thrown for good measure,\\" Johnston's freeform, fluid writing style of the 1970s matched the colorful nature of the tales recounted in her books Lesbian Nation and Gullibles Travels. Her later work as a literary and art critic for Art in America and the New York Times Review of Books is more standard in tone and content. Early writing not collected in other volumes can be found in Admission Accomplished while the critical biography Jasper Johns represents an example of her later style. Johnston is the subject of one of Andy Warhol's portrait films, Jill, a 4½-minute silent movie shot in black and white (1963). Personal life In 1958 Johnston married Richard John Lanham, whom she divorced in 1964. They had two children, a son, Richard Renault Lanham, and a daughter, Winifred Brooke Lanham.Frances C. Locher and Ann Evory, Contemporary Authors, Volumes 53-56, The Gale Group, 1975, page 320 In 1993, in Denmark, she married Ingrid Nyeboe. The couple married again, in Connecticut, in 2009. Death On September 10, 2010, Johnston suffered a stroke in Hartford, Connecticut. She died eight days later, on September 18, 2010, at the age of 81.

Volume 1: Inferno. Penguin Classics: 1984, pp. 37-38. A similar process occurs in the Purgatorio.

Overview The work was written in 1848, published in part in 1851 (as On my Work as an Author), and published in full posthumously in 1859. This work explains his pseudonymous writings and his personal attachment to those writings. Walter Lowrie, a Kierkegaardian translator and scholar called this an autobiography \\"so unique that it has no parallel in the whole literature of the world.\\" However, Kierkegaard did make the following remarks in The Point of View that cast doubt on whether he regarded the pseudonymous writings as highly as he did his Christian writings. He published Either/Or under the pseudonym, Victor Eremita, February 20, 1843 and Two Edifying Discourses, May 16, 1843 under his own name. The Point of View is his own interpretation of his work up to 1848. He had just published Works of Love in 1847, where he attempted to explain how to love your neighbor as yourself. Criticism Benjamin Nelson wrote the Preface to Lowrie's 1962 translation of Kierkegaard's Point of View. He noted the dates the book was written and published. > Consider the principal dates associated with The Point of View — 1859, the > year when the work was first published, and 1848, the year when it was > written. Both dates recall publications which revolutionized the worlds of > thought and experience: the former, the Origin of Species, by a retiring > British botanist, Charles Darwin; the latter, The Communist Manifesto, by > Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, Kierkegaard’s fellow auditor — along with > Bakunin, Herzen, Feuerbach and other notable figures — of Schelling’s Berlin > lectures in 1841. > Is it not odd that we look to this melancholy and splenetic Dane, who seemed > to so many of his forward-looking contemporaries a ‘misanthropic traitor > against mankind’, to be a foremost champion in the defense against the > perversions of thought and existence which have been sired by the > humanitarian spokesmen for ‘scientific eugenics’ and ‘scientific socialism’? > Benjamin Nelson’s Preface to The Point of View by Soren Kierkegaard 1859 > Lowrie translation 1962 p. xviii Notes # Essential Kierkegaard, p. 449 References * Hong, Howard V. and Edna H.

In 2014, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Carolina Music Awards. Early life and career Custer graduated from Cary High School in 1981. He spent the early part of his career in New York as a studio session guitarist, providing guitar tracks for national television ads such as VH1, Ford, Jovan, Mazda, Revlon, and Coca-Cola. At age 25, he began producing and developing original artists. His work as a producer has run the gamut from comedian Rich Hall to punk-metal pioneers Corrosion of Conformity to his own funk-creation, DAG. Career Custer's first major project was Corrosion of Conformity's Blind, initially released on Relativity Records in 1991. Blind caught the attention of Columbia Records, and COC was signed.

Directed by Patrick Hoelk, it features Vincent Gallo and has the band performing in an alley in New York City. Their loud music awakens Gallo who then begins physically confronting strangers as he walks the streets of New York. He eventually finds the alley the band is performing in, walks up to them, and unplugs their equipment just before the song is finished. He then gives them a long, angry stare as the video fades to black. An alternate ending was shot for the video in which Gallo walks up to the band, produces a pistol, and shoots each member.

HIA seeks to maximise the positive health impacts and minimise the negative health impacts of proposed policies, programs or projects. The procedures of HIA are similar to those used in other forms of impact assessment, such as environmental impact assessment or social impact assessment. HIA is usually described as following the steps listed, though many practitioners break these into sub-steps or label them differently: # Screening - determining if an HIA is warranted/required # Scoping - determining which impacts will be considered and the plan for the HIA # Identification and assessment of impacts - determining the magnitude, nature, extent and likelihood of potential health impacts, using a variety of different methods and types of information # Decision-making and recommendations - making explicit the trade-offs to be made in decision-making and formulating evidence-informed recommendations # Evaluation, monitoring and follow-up - process and impact evaluation of the HIA and the monitoring and management of health impacts The main objective of HIA is to apply existing knowledge and evidence about health impacts, to specific social and community contexts, to develop evidence-based recommendations that inform decision-making in order to protect and improve community health and wellbeing. Because of financial and time constraints, HIAs do not generally involve new research or the generation of original scientific knowledge. However, the findings of HIAs, especially where these have been monitored and evaluated over time, can be used to inform other HIAs in contexts that are similar. An HIA's recommendations may focus on both design and operational aspects of a proposal. HIA has also been identified as a mechanism by which potential health inequalities can be identified and redressed prior to the implementation of proposed policy, program or project . A number of manuals and guidelines for HIA's use have been developed (see further reading). Determinants of health The proposition that policies, programs and projects have the potential to change the determinants of health underpins HIA's use. Changes to health determinants then leads to changes in health outcomes or the health status of individuals and communities. The determinants of health are largely environmental and social, so that there are many overlaps with environmental impact assessment and social impact assessment. Levels of HIA Three forms of HIA exist: * Desk-based HIA, which takes 2–6 weeks for one assessor to complete and provides a broad overview of potential health impacts; * Rapid HIA, which takes approximately 12 weeks for one assessor to complete and provides more detailed information on potential health impacts; and * Comprehensive HIA, which takes approximately 6 months for one assessor and provides a in-depth assessment of potential health impacts. It has been suggested that HIAs can be prospective (done before a proposal is implemented), concurrent (done while the proposal is being implemented) or retrospective (done after a proposal has been implemented) . This remains controversial, however, with a number of HIA practitioners suggesting that concurrent HIA is better regarded as a monitoring activity and that retrospective HIA is more akin to evaluation with a health focus, rather than being assessment per se . Prospective HIA is preferred as it allows the maximum practical opportunity to influence decision-making and subsequent health impacts. HIA practitioners HIA practitioners can be found in the private and public sectors, but are relatively few in number. There are no universally accepted competency frameworks or certification processes. It is suggested that a lead practitioner should have extensive education and training in a health related field, experience of participating in HIAs, and have attended an HIA training course. It has been suggested and widely accepted that merely having a medical or health degree should not be regarded as an indication of competency. The International Association for Impact Assessment has an active health section. A HIA People Directory can be found on the HIA GATEWAY. HIA worldwide HIA used around the world, most notably in Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, Africa and Thailand . The safeguard policies and standards of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World Bank, were established in 2006. These contain a requirement for health impact assessment in large projects. The standards have been accepted by most of the leading lending banks who are parties to the Equator Principles. Health impact assessments are becoming routine in many large development projects in both public and private sectors of developing countries. There is also a long history of health impact assessment in the water resource development sector - large dams and irrigation systems.

Siffredi was the first to descend Mount Everest on a snowboard in 2001 via the Norton Couloir. In 2002, he disappeared after making his second Everest summit, while attempting to snowboard the Hornbein Couloir.  First snowboard descent at Nant Blanc  In his early years, Marco Siffredi made several first descents in the Chamonix valley before extending his horizons to bigger peaks. In June 1999, he made the second-ever descent of Nant Blanc on the Aiguille Verte, after Jean-Marc Boivin’s ski descent in 1989.  First Everest descent  Siffredi reached the summit of Everest, a 8,848-meter mountain, on May 23, 2001 with the help of oxygen along with two Sherpas who brought the equipment. He was forced to choose an alternative route to the one he considered the \\"Holy Grail\\" of snowboarding, as the Hornbein Couloir did not have enough snow. Instead, he rode down the Norton Couloir back to Advanced Base Camp (ABC) at the foot of the North Col. Then he began the descent down the Norton Couloir of the north face, but after 200 meters a fastening strap on his snowboard broke due to the cold . After repairing it with help from a sherpa, Siffredi continued the descent to 6,400 meters in two hours. The day before, on May 22, Austrian climber Stefan Gatt reached the summit alone and without using oxygen. He went on a snowboard up to 8,600 meters along the north wall, but at that altitude he found very hard snow and decided to continue without snowboarding. There were disputes about who would be awarded the first snowboard descent of Everest, as Gatt got out first, but did not use a snowboard for about 1,000 m. The site everestnews.com, attributed primacy to Siffredi but the site snowboarding.transworld.net, recognized merits and demerits to both, so the record was shared. Second Everest descent Early in August 2002, Siffredi departed for Nepal, intending to make the first snowboard descent of Everest along the Hornbein Couloir. It was late in the season for summitting Everest, but Siffredi hoped that the passage would have more snow. On August 10, he left Kathmandu with three sherpa (Phurba, Pa Nuru and Da Tenzing), reaching base camp in Tibet on August 14. On September 7, the group reached the advanced field at 8,300 m. On Sept. 8, 2002, Siffredi and the sherpas reached the summit at 2:10 PM. According to Phurba Tashi, however, Siffredi showed little enthusiasm for the accomplishment, commenting that he was \\"Tired, tired...too much climbing...\\" After weather conditions began to change, the Sherpas urged Siffredi not to go. Siffredi ignored their warnings and after an hour's rest, began making his way towards the Hornbein just after 3pm. His sherpa companions lost sight of him periodically. At the North Col, about 1,300 meters below Camp Three, both Sherpas reported seeing the distant image of a man stand up, then slide silently down the mountain. As they reached the point of the sighting, Siffredi's snowboard tracks were not to be seen. His body has not been found. Other achievements In May 1996, Siffredi snowboarded down the north face of the Aiguille du Midi on Mont Blanc along the Mallory track, a descent of 1,000 meters with passages of more than 50-degree incline. In 1998, in preparation for climbing the Himalayas, he climbed Tocllaraju in Peru (6,032 m) with Philippe Forte and René Robert. In 1999 he climbed Dorje Lhakpa (6,988 m) in Nepal and made the first snowboard descent of the mountain. In autumn 2001, he climbed Shisha Pangma, Himalayas (8,027 m) with the intention of making the entire descent by snowboard, but strong winds prevented the attempt.

It was founded in 1893. History The Original Church The actual beginning of Glenwood United Methodist Church was on March 26, 1893. A small group of Hilltop Methodists met in a small home. Out of this meeting came the original organization, which would lead to the establishment of the church. The Little White Church. On November 19, 1893, preliminary meetings were held in a brick school house. The Church Board accepted land and the society assumed a three hundred dollar indebtedness. A frame church was then erected on Highland Avenue, September 1, 1895, and became known as \\"The Little White Church.\\" It served the congregation for a few years, but with the sudden and continued growth of the Hilltop in Columbus, it was soon apparent that a larger structure would be required. Under the pastorate of The Reverend Postle E. White, the plans were completed, pledges taken and the work of erecting a finer Glenwood was begun. The cornerstone was laid on June 28, 1910. Consecration was in 1911. That building, now Oakley Baptist Church, still stands. As a result of Glenwood's growth, under the leadership of Reverend Doctor E.L. Motter, a new wing was authorized to meet the church's needs in 1932. This wing was not completed until 1936, under the pastorate of Reverend Doctor O.L. Seward, as funds were hard to come by during the depression years. The new unit provided educational and recreational facilities, choir rooms, junior church chapel and church parlor. The following two decades brought vast sociological and economic changes. A revolutionary step had to be taken which involved building a new church in another area. New location Through a benefactor, Mrs. Helen Hadly Kitzmiller, a site was obtained at North Hague Avenue and Valleyview Drive. Under the leadership of our minister, Reverend Doctor Joseph B. Shellhaas, the \\"Program of Progress Crusade\\" was carried through and the funds were pledged to carry out the building project. Ground was broken for the new church on March 19, 1961, by members of the congregation. After the laying of the cornerstone, \\"Reverend Joe\\" Shellhaas retired because of ill health, having given twenty-two years of service to Glenwood. Within a year, the new building was brought to completion. The bell tower rises to fifty-seven feet and is topped by a steel cross thirty-three feet high. Glenwood's new minister, The Reverend Warren H. Bright, preached the farewell sermon in the old Glenwood Church, February 25, 1962. The keys were then transferred to the Oakley Avenue Baptist Church. First services were held in the new church March 4, 1962. On March 17, 1974, the building of an educational unit was begun. Led by The Reverend Herman Emmert, members of the official bodies and children of the church school department pulled the plow to break ground. The building was consecrated by Bishop F. Gerald Ensley, February 2, 1975. Organizations Many organizations have been formed throughout the life of the church. Among them were the Ladies Aid Society, Women's Home and Foreign Missionary Society, the Epworth League (which is the forerunner of Youth Fellowship), United Methodist Men, The Lamplighters (a singing group), many plays and cantatas, Tom Thumb Weddings, Christian education programs, Christian social groups, sport groups, and Boy Scout Troop 18, which is the oldest ongoing troop in the Columbus area, chartered April 24, 1924. Many more groups and special programs have helped Glenwood grow. Future Glenwood has had five men go into the ministry, a missionary go into foreign service, a deaconal minister, and presently a theological student. It has had twenty six senior ministers from The Reverend W.B. Chadwidk to its present minister, The Reverend Doctor Sharon Beattie. It has also had fifteen associate ministers. The goal of the church, as stated by its ministers, is to \\"devote the next 100 years to teaching God's will and reaching out to the community\\".

The play also deals with the irascibility of Nero and his inability to take heed of the philosopher Seneca's advice to rein in his passions. The play was attributed to Seneca, but modern scholarship generally discredits this, since it contains accurate prophecies of both his and Nero’s deaths.R Ferri ed., Octavia (2003) p. 5-9 While the play closely resembles Seneca's plays in style, it was probably written some time after Seneca's death in the Flavian period by someone influenced by Seneca and aware of the events of his lifetime.H J Rose, A Handbook of Latin Literature (London 1967) p. 375 Characters *Octavia. *Octavia's Nurse. *Chorus of Romans. *Seneca. *Prefect. *Poppaea. *Agrippina (ghost). *Nero. *Messenger. Plot Act I Octavia, weary of her existence, bewails her misery. Her nurse curses the drawbacks which beset life in a Palace. The Nurse consoles Octavia and dissuades her from executing any revenge which she might be contemplating. The Chorus being in favor of Octavia, looks with detestation upon the marriage of Poppaea, and condemns the degenerate patience of the Romans, as being unworthy, too indifferent and servile, and complains about the crimes of Nero. Act II Seneca deplores the vices of his times, praises the simplicity of his former life, and offers his opinion that all things are tending to the worse. The philosopher warns his patron Nero but to no purpose. Nero stubbornly insists on carrying out his tyrannical plans, and appoints the next day for his marriage with Poppaea. Act III Agrippina appears from the underworld as a cruel soothsayer. She brings torches from the underworld to grace the wedding, and predicts the death of Nero. Octavia urges the populace, who are espousing her cause, not to grieve about her divorce. The Chorus however, does grieve for her sad lot. Act IV Poppaea, being frightened in her sleep, narrates her dream to the Nurse. The Nurse treating the dream as nonsense, consoles Poppaea with a shallow interpretation. The Chorus praises the beauty of Poppaea. The Messenger describes the hostile mood of the populace concerning Octavia's divorce and Nero's marriage with Poppaea. Act V Nero, boiling over with rage on account of the tumultuous rising of the populace, orders the most severe measures to be taken against them, and that Octavia, as the cause of the rising, shall be transported to Pandataria and there slain. The Chorus sings regarding popular favor, which has been destructive to so many, and after that tells of the hard fates which have befallen the Julio-Claudian dynasty.

It is most commonly found in tidal rock pools along the south coast of Australia. As an adult, it can grow up to long (top of the mantle to the tip of the arms) and on average weighs . They are normally a docile species, but they are highly venomous, possessing venom capable of killing humans. Their blue rings appear with greater intensity when they become aggravated or threatened.  Description  The blue-ringed species are known for their small size, yet the southern variety is hailed as the largest of the genus. As a result, they have been classified as their own species. From arm to arm, most of these octopuses are no larger than 20 centimeters. This is larger by roughly 5 centimeters on average with other varieties of the blue-ringed octopus. When at peace, their coloring is often a drab, mucus like color. However, once it feels sufficiently threatened, the eponymous blue-rings suddenly appear. These octopuses have an average of about 60 rings that have multilayer reflectors that allow them to flash a blue green color. These rings typically appear about 6 weeks after hatching (Mäthger et al.). For the rings to illuminate and glow, the muscles around the rings must contract while the muscles above them must relax (Mäthger et al.). This method of muscle contraction and relaxation has not been seen in other illuminating animals (Mäthger et al.)  Nomenclature  Like other species of the blue-ringed octopus, this variety is named for the vibrant blue rings that it displays when agitated.  Range and habitat  Found along the southern coasts of Australia, H. maculosa inhabits crevasses and cracks in the rocky reefs signature to this section of the Australian coast. In addition, the octopus enjoys a proximity to the plentiful forests of seagrass.  Behavior  Despite their highly toxic venom, southern blue-ringed octopuses tend to be passive and relatively harmless unless provoked. They generally only use their toxins when hunting or when provoked. These creatures are nocturnal, primarily active at night. They can jet out water to move more efficiently as well. In addition, it was found that southern blue-ringed octopuses have at least slightly more acute olfaction (smell) sense which may affect choice in mate (see Breeding, below). Burrowing is also normal of this species.  Diet  The prey of H. maculosa consists mostly of lobsters, crabs, shrimp, and shellfish, as well as the occasional small fish. H. maculosa makes use of its venom for feeding purposes. It pins down and injects it through its beak. This totally paralyzes its prey, often killing it outright. This readies it for feeding. Another tactic it uses to hunt is releasing its venom as a mist into a location where its prey is commonly found. Their prey swim into the venom and become paralyzed, allowing for an attack.  Life span and reproduction  H. maculosa has a very short life span with a large importance placed on reproduction. The average life span of a southern blue ringed octopus is around seven months. The octopus reaches sexual maturity at around four months old, at which time it focuses its last few months of life towards copulation and breeding. Both genders of this species are promiscuous, as they only have a limited set of gametes. The mating ritual of H. maculosa usually begins with the female initiating reproduction by changing color and posture. The male then mounts the female, inserts the hectocotylus under the mantle of the female, and releases the sperm into the female’s oviduct. For this type of octopus, there is approximately a two-month window in which a female acquires and stores sperm from multiple males. She then carries the eggs with her, as opposed to depositing them somewhere stationary. During this time period, the mother rarely moves unless disturbed. When she is forced to move, she uses only two arms for locomotion. The female also does not eat during this time period. Because of this, the mother dies shortly after the eggs have hatched. It is highly unlikely that the male or female would live beyond one year. This unusual octopus maternal care system seems to be an advanced evolutionary development of the species. While this may seem strange, females only reproduce once in their lifetime, so it is vital to them that their egg clutch survives. Once hatched, the H. maculosa grow very rapidly. The southern blue- ringed octopus also differs from other marine invertebrates in that there is no planktonic stage. The young begin hunting around one month of age- they are said to be venomous from birth, while their blue rings don’t appear until six weeks after hatching. It was found in a study by Morse and Zenger that as size of the octopus increased, so too did willingness to mate. Same-sex attempts at mating were frequently noted, which implies distinguishing between male and female is difficult even for the octopus. It is also possible females use some form of refined sense of smell to single out attractive mates.  Mate and paternity choice  Many studies have been done on how southern blue-ringed octopuses choose their mates and if females can choose the sperm used to fertilize her eggs (Morse et al., 2018). Researchers have been interested in this topic specifically because the female can only reproduce once in her lifetime and because she can store the sperm of her many mates (Oceana). Researchers have hypothesized that there may be cryptic female choice or sperm competition (Morse et al., 2018). In the paper, Mating Behavior and Postcopulatory Fertilization Patterns in the Southern Blue-Ringed Octopus Hapalochlaena Maculosa, the authors study did not find that females choose the male sperm that will fertilize their eggs, though the \\"male that obtained less paternity than expected was in fact the female's full-sibling brother (Morse et al.).\\" Although this study did not find female selection of sperm, a separate study did find that females are picky about who they mate with. In the paper, Nocturnal Mating Behaviour and Dynamic Male Investment of Copulation Time in the Southern Blue-Ringed octopus, Hapalochlaena Maculosa (Cephalopoda: Octopodidae), Morse et al., found that females were more willing to mate with males that were larger and males that were larger attempted to mate more than smaller males. The same study also found that males would spend less time mating with females that they had already mated with.  Venom  What makes this octopus famous is its venom. Saliva glands of the southern blue-ringed octopus produce the deadly neurotoxin, maculotoxin. The Neurotoxin, TTX, is secreted in the posterior salivary gland, which is located in the intestinal blood system of the octopus. This may provide the toxin into its bloodstream. The toxin has also been found in the eggs of this octopus. The method of poisoning is still not fully understood, but it is assumed that H. maculosa either inject the toxin into the water surrounding their prey through their saliva mixed with the toxin, or they directly bite their prey or predator with the beak-like mouth. It is fatal to humans. Various references in popular culture depict the southern blue-ringed octopus as a nefarious seadevil lying in wait to attack humans with its deadly toxins. In actuality, the venom is primarily used in hunting or for defense. There are no reported cases of unprovoked aggression towards humans. No antivenom exists.  Conservation  There are currently no known conservation efforts for the southern blue-ringed octopus. This being said, it is likely that H. maculosa play an important role in their ecosystem, perhaps by controlling crustacean populations, so any efforts to conserve this species would be expected to benefit other species in the same habitat. It is also suggested that because the dispersal ability of H. maculosa is limited, connectivity between different populations of the species is especially vulnerable to habitat fragmentation or geographic barriers.

The film stars Alexander Brickel as Dougie, a nine-year-old boy video gamer. On Halloween, Dougie meets a serial killer and unknowingly assists him in his murders. The film, which combines black comedy with horror, is Lieberman's first film as director in 17 years, since 1988's Remote Control. Satan's Little Helper was praised by reviewers for its satire, elements of comedy and characterization. Plot Douglas 'Dougie' Whooly is a nine-year-old boy obsessed with a video game, in which he plays Satan's little helper. His sister Jenna comes home from college for Halloween, but things turn sour when Dougie finds out she brought her boyfriend, Alex, with her. After a fall out with Jenna, Dougie wanders off and finds a man dressed in a cheap costume arranging a dead body on his lawn as if it were a decoration. Dougie naively believes the man is Satan, and asks him for help in sending Alex to Hell, which \\"Satan\\" nods assent to. In the meantime, Alex comes up with the idea of bonding with Dougie by dressing as Satan for Halloween. When Dougie comes back home, he tries to lure Alex into the basement where Satan is waiting for him, but fails. Dougie ends up changing plans to instead have Alex ambushed by Satan while he and Alex go out shopping for a Satan costume, where Alex ends up being left for dead. Dougie brings Satan home, whom everyone believes to be Alex. Despite Satan becoming forcefully, physically intimate with Jenna and his unwillingness to speak, Jenna interprets these as Alex's devotion to his Satan costume. When Satan and Dougie leave to get Halloween candy, they end up shoplifting a market for candy and tools, where Satan subsequently kills a bagger who tries to stop them and the two engage in a brief physical assault spree with their shopping cart. On the way home, Satan engages in a combination of assaulting and killing several more people, including Alex's estranged dad, before he and Dougie are accosted by the police. Satan indicates to Dougie to run home while he confronts the police, who are later found to be dead. In the meantime, it is revealed that Alex has survived, who finds out from a babbling man that all the police on the island are dead and the police station is on fire.

Still, horror buffs will delight in ingenious twists, perverse satire and gleefully off-kilter Amanda Plummer/Katheryn Winnick mother-daughter team.\\" The website JoBlo.com gave the film an 8/10 rating, writing, \\"if you like your horror with a heaping dose of the blackest of black comedy, then Satan’s Little Helper will be quite the treat! The flick is a prime example of horror on a low budget done right. Characters are actually developed, jokes are skillfully executed, and the scares are delivered with flair.\\" Dread Central called the film \\"Irreverent, subversive and deliciously caustic [...] a unique and daring achievement\\", describing it as \\"a satiric commentary on the influence of videogames and fiction, the distinction between fantasy and reality for a child, and the danger and power of Halloween – all in a movie filled with blood, guts and black humour.\\" Satan's Little Helper was listed on Rolling Stone's 13 Terrifying Horror Movies You Can't Unsee.

Background It involves calculating a present value for the contractual liabilities of a contract, and deducting the value of future premiums. Both contractual liabilities, and future premiums in this calculation allow only for mortality and interest. The key with a net premium valuation is that the premiums being valued are theoretical measures - they make no reference to the actual premiums being charged by the insurer. This technique is a well-established actuarial valuation method, that became popular because of its simplicity, consistency, and ease of calculation. New methods With the advent of computers, the more complicated so-called gross premium valuation calculation (which is also more realistic than the net premium valuation) has become much more feasible, and is displacing the archaic net premium valuation further from its historical position of prominence.

Plot The opening sequence explains that two siblings, Todd and Riley, lived in what seemed to be an orphanage with no explanation of what happened to their birth parents. While cleaning the floors, they stumbled across a Fleemco comic book That contained an ad for the Fleemco phone. They mail-ordered the ad and $1.98 for the phone—which allows them to replace any person or animal they desire—and in the process they got new parents: a female British secret agent named Agent K and a professional daredevil named Dick Daring. Whenever Todd and Riley want to replace someone undesirable, they call Conrad Fleem on the Fleemco phone via a large button. Fleemco immediately replaces the person with someone to the liking of Todd and Riley. The series follows their misadventures as they attempt to better their lives by replacing people they do not like, with said attempt usually backfiring and both learning a lesson about appreciating what they already have. Episodes Characters Main * Todd Bartholomew Daring (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) – Riley's 11-year-old younger brother. He is the lazy, trouble- making, and selfish one of the siblings. He and Riley are the adopted children of K and Dick Daring. He usually uses the Fleemco phone to replace people for selfish purposes. He is best friends with Jacobo and Shelton. In an episode, it is revealed that Todd has a talent for singing. Riley, K, and Dick forced him to join the school choir, along with Shelton Klutzberry and the twins. Todd loves the Monkey Cop movie series as well as playing the Gamecone (parody of Nintendo GameCube) video game console. He hates school, learning, and reading which forces him to replace the librarian in another episode. His catchphrases include \\"Don't judge me\\" and \\"Sweet.\\" In \\"Ratted Out\\" for the first time, Todd sings the second verse to \\"My Rat Buddy\\" at the end of the episode. In season two, Todd still has feelings for Sierra after the one-time bond between the two after the parody of Star Trek fanclub. In the episode Tasumi Unmasked, Todd formed his own one-man band and battles against the mailman for his \\"Game Cone 4\\". * Riley Eugene Daring (voiced by Grey DeLisle) – Todd's 13-year-old older sister. She is the kinder, more caring and reliable sibling who enjoys school. She and Todd are the adopted children of K and Dick Daring. She generally uses the Fleemco phone to replace mean or unfair adults, but sometimes she use it for her own selfish purpose. She is a girly girl and enjoys playing baseball, playing the violin, horses, ponies, Hornet Hive Scouts, candy, and pretty much any form of sugar. At one point, she was part of the journalism staff at school. She has a crush on Johnny Hitswell and they became a couple in season 2. But in \\"Heartbreak in the City\\", Johnny broke up with her because of her controlling demeanor. She claims she is over him, despite many people who claim otherwise. She has an imaginary unicorn friend named Rainbow Jumper. She gets a B average in school. She prefers playing country fiddle/country rock on the violin. Riley is a fan of Susie May, Dustin Dreamlake, and J.J. Baker's. Riley can easily become jealous like when Todd made a fortune off of his \\"Gum Art\\" and she wasn't with her Unicorn \\"Art\\". Riley loves reading and the library. Riley had braces when she was younger. Riley also has a mission: Get Todd to do the right thing and be selfless. Sugar makes Riley hyper. In \\"The Spy Who Wasn't Riley\\" Riley tries one of her dream careers as a spy instead of a window washer that the Career Day test and the ex-guidance counselor Mr. Leslie told her to be, and almost blows up Antarctica when she stows away on K's mission to stop Dr. Scorpius, but in the end Riley saves the day even though K's mission is too dangerous. In \\"She Works Hard For The Movie\\" we learn that Riley has an Aunt Debbie and her middle name is Eugene. In \\"Ratted out\\", she started to sing the very first song of the whole series entitled \\"My Rat Buddy\\". * Karen Mildred \\"Agent K\\" Daring (voiced by Kath Soucie) – Agent K resembles Emma Peel. She is the siblings' adoptive British mother and is a superspy. Agent K's height is 6'1 tall. From an outside view it may seem she doesn't care for her kids or husband, but in fact she loves them devotedly, even though she may express it through a recording or videotape. If something is done unfairly, she fixes it very quickly. She is seen to be a terrible cook. Her career as a spy has also made her highly suspicious of anything that is the least bit out-of-place, to the point of paranoia. In the episode Abra K Dabra!, it is revealed that she has stage fright and that her middle name is Mildred. She also has a habit for thinking all her chores are secret missions. She plays classical violin, which Riley hates and it puts Dick to sleep. K once took karate lessons from the evil Master Pho (Master Foe) to bust his secret evil bank-robbing karate gang. Even though she's just as logical as C.A.R. (albeit less sarcastic and violent), she seems to favor Dick over him. Even though both Dick and Agent K are the replacement adoptive parents, they still seem to be very much in love and care for Riley and Todd as their own children. Her mother is also a secret agent. * Richard Marion \\"Dick\\" Daring (voiced by Daran Norris) – He is the siblings' world-greatest daredevil adoptive father. He is a semi-former stunt artist, and is constantly working on new tricks. His appearance resembles that of Evel Knievel. He is also rather immature, and is seen having a teddy bear known as \\"Evel Bearnievel\\". He thinks that C.A.R. is his best friend, though C.A.R. doesn't see it that way. Dick bought Riley a mule named Prince Cinnamon Boots instead of a horse like she wanted. Like Todd, Dick isn't smart at all. In \\"The Spy Who Wasn't Riley\\" we learn that Dick is afraid of clowns and tries to force Todd to be a stunt man instead of a circus clown for his career. In \\"She Works Hard For The Movie\\" we learn that Dick was in a movie back in the 1970s. We also hear Dick sing his first true song; \\"Space training Montage\\" in \\"Space family Daring\\". It is also revealed in one episode that he is a better cook than K. His catchphrase is \\"Look out below!\\". * C.A.R.T.E.R. (voiced by David McCallum) – C.A.R.T.E.R. a.k.a. C.A.R. is the high-tech family car with a British accent. He can do just about anything, but is not always willing to do something for the family, especially not for Dick. He often calls Dick a twit, but is often indifferent to him. He does not wish to let Dick drive him, presumably under the assumption that Dick's daredevil habits would cause him to wreck C.A.R.T.E.R. He prefers to use a maneuver called \\"The Oslo Option\\" to scare Dick, which consists of C.A.R.T.E.R. pulling out a large spinning buzzsaw blade from his hood. The family usually refers to him as simply C.A.R. which is most likely a parody of K.I.T.T from Knight Rider. C.A.R also resembles the Mach Five from Speed Racer. In the episode Tasumi Unmasked, C.A.R used to be a one-man band player back when he wanted to join other one- man band members, but was kicked out for not being perfect. They destroyed his instruments. Also in this episode, he had a goatee, possibly real or not. The goatee was ripped by the other one-man band members. He is sarcastic, witty, and violent. * Conrad Fleem (voiced by Jeff Bennett) – Conrad is the mysterious owner of the Fleemco company. He processes Todd and Riley's requests whenever they call him. He has a very long mustache. In the show his face is never shown until the episode \\"Irreplaceble\\" where it is also revealed his mustache is red and not black. In a flashback of his it appears he was bullied during his childhood. At the end of the series it is revealed that Conrad is Riley and Todd's long lost uncle; the tip off is when they find out he craves sugar just like Riley and says \\"Don't judge me!\\" just like Todd after they find out Conrad tells them that he will open up the replacement program to other kids so he asks Riley and Todd to help him. Major * Tasumi (voiced by Lauren Tom) – She is Riley's best friend, who is of Japanese descent and has a crush on Jacobo and kissed him revealed in one episode. There is hint of Tasumi's crush on Jacobo in \\"The Truth Hurts\\" when she passes on a note in the classroom that asks Jacobo if she liked him and was crushed when he signed maybe. She wears a pink metal suit which resembles RoboCop. But during season 2 she no longer wears her metal suit. She claims her family is part of a crime-fighting team. (parody of Power Rangers/Super Sentai). She also has a list of people she hates. Riley is either on or off it. In the episode \\"Best friends For-Never?\\" it appears Riley first meets Tasumi in a broom closet when she was new at school and tried to get to homeroom but got lost. Tasumi was in the broom closet because she split her armor and was embarrassed, but Riley fixed it with the duct tape her dad made her carry. In the episode \\"Tasumi Unmasked\\", it is revealed that Tasumi is in fact a Japanese pop star. She moved to Pleasant Hills in order to escape the constant adoration of her fans and live a peaceful life, as Pleasant Hills was voted as the least culturally aware town in the world and she believed that nobody there would recognize her. However, in order to make sure that nobody recognized her, she wore a costume from a popular anime and used details from that anime in order to get a new history. That is the reason she always referred to things such as fighting giant monsters and so forth, but in reality, she never did anything of that sort. When her fans found out about this, she moved back to Japan for 2 weeks to record a new album until Riley replaced her band members with orangutans and she got kicked out by her new orangutan members because she has thumbs (even though orangutans do have thumbs). She came back to Pleasant Hills with Riley and no longer wears her metal suit, dumping it in the garbage. Under her metal suit, Tasumi has long black hair and a pretty face complete with a beauty mark. She wears a blue wig with her metal suit. She also has a brother named Roku. *Abbey Willson (voiced by Erica Hubbard in season 1, Tempestt Bledsoe in season 2) – She is Riley's other best friend, who is of African-American descent. Even though she hates the popular girls such as Sierra, she is seen wanting to be a part of them so bad, and has a habit of telling Sierra she is cool, even though she doesn't mean to. It also seems that her parents are rich. She sometimes can be hypocritical. She has a little sister named Tiffany who dated Todd in the episode \\"A Little Tiff\\". * Jacobo Jacobo (HA-CO-BO) (voiced by Candi Milo) – Todd's best friend who is of Mexican descent (Though his shirt has the colors of the flag of Spain). He has a funny looking mouth. Jacobo loves mystery books and has a secret talent for singing. He has a crush on Agent K. He is always trying to win the affections of Agent K, even in the episode, \\"Irreplaceable,\\" when he started to date Tasumi. * Shelton Gunnar Klutzberry (voiced by Jeff Bennett) – Shelton is Todd's other best friend and the stereotypical nerd at school. He is afraid of girls, and once had a relationship with Celebrity Star. He also has an imaginary girlfriend named Zelda (since an imaginary girlfriend is all that he can handle). He often thinks of himself as cool and calls the others nerds. He becomes very muscular and handsome when he takes his glasses off, but this is not to his advantage because he can't use contacts, and has to have heavy glasses (which causes him to appear weak and scrawny). He always seems to be where ever Todd and Riley are. He sometimes just wants to be part of a popular group. In one episode he is seen to have a giant pet tortoise. In another he and his entire family are stated to be Jewish. His voice and mannerisms are greatly similar to the famous comedian Jerry Lewis's character from the movie \\"The Nutty Professor\\". When he speaks of characteristics or actions, he clarifies them by saying \\"with the\\" and adding a list of adjectives and effects (etc. \\"Victory is mine... with the winning, and the accomplishing, and the rubbing it in your face!\\"). When he gets hurt, he usually says \\"Hoigle!\\" * Buzz Winters (voiced by Grey DeLisle) – Buzz is a wannabe bully and is Todd's nemesis. He usually makes silly jokes then laughs at them saying \\"Good one Buzz!\\" and \\"I got to start writing these down!\\". Although he is normally a bully in some episodes they have put their differences aside and even become friends. Deep down Buzz is jealous of Todd and Riley because their dad is cooler than his dad. Buzz used to have the coolest dad in the neighborhood until Todd and Riley came along. On more than one account Buzz has been mistaken for a wild boar, although, both times, this was by Dingo McGee, on \\"Field Trippin'\\" and \\"Volcano Island\\". He also has a taste for crabgrass. Like Todd, Buzz hates school, and he has a habit of cheating. He has many secrets including his love of the theater, and what he calls his only two shames, small feet, and ice skating. * Donny Rottweiler (voiced by Jess Harnell) – Donny is a professional bully who is much taller than Todd, but still attends his school. He is Buzz's mentor and Todd's other nemesis, he is feared because of his giant size. * Johnny Hitswell (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) – He is the subject of Riley's affection and her middle school sweet heart. Even though every girl in the school is all over him, he tends to pay no attention to them all times, except for his annual Kumquat Day card readings. He enjoys basketball and baseball, and plays on the same baseball team as Todd and Riley. It is true that he likes Riley, because he asked her out on a date and then kissed her. But in season two he starts dating Riley as boyfriend and girlfriend. In the second season, Johnny breaks up with Riley for being to controlling after she followed him all the way to New York with Abby and Tasumi. He once said in a later episode that she could be smothering as she was in a conversation with her friends. By the end of the series, he actually admits that he wants to get back together with Riley, but he says this while talking to her robot duplicate, and it is never shown if he and Riley do get back together. * Sierra McCool (voiced by Tara Strong) – She is the popular girl at school, and is Riley's nemesis. She is constantly competing with Riley for the affections of Johnny Hitswell. In the second season, when Riley and Johnny become a couple, her crush on him persists, and her aim becomes to break them up so she can be Johnny's girlfriend. She has her own posse (Jennifer and Claudia) and a huge, conceited ego. She is seen to have another side in which, she is infatuated with a Star Trek parody mentioned, which Todd also likes. This forges a bond between the two, which doesn't last long when she becomes a cheerleader again. It is mentioned in the series finale that she gets her own Fleemco Phone. She has long black hair in pigtails. * Principal Cutler (voiced by Jeff Bennett) – He is the Inuit principal of George Stapler Middle School. Since he is from Alaska, he allows school on major snow days until Todd and Riley changed it one time. He is also very cheap and cares about money over the students, the school, and the faculty (he saves money for a vacation on Tahiti). * Prince Cinnamon Boots (voiced by Daran Norris) – The Daring Family's pet mule. He was originally given to Riley by her father when she asked for a show horse. PCB has many talents but is often forgotten by his family after Dick says \\"I keep thinking we're forgetting something.\\" * Shelly Klutzberry (voiced by Candi Milo) – Shelton's older sister who has fewer appearances than her brother. She resembles her brother but doesn't change appearance when her glasses are taken off. In \\"Late Night With Todd and Riley\\" she is first mentioned as Shelton's sister and also we learn she loves Dustin Dreamlake. Though never mentioned, she presumably already had her bat mitzvah. * Jennifer and Claudia (voiced by Lauren Tom, Erica Hubbard and Tempestt Bledsoe) – Two blonde-haired twin girls who are normally seen with Sierra McCool. In the episode, \\"The Insecurity Guard\\" from the first season, a common gag was for the two girls to be commenting on what they are wearing when Todd falls in a mud puddle next to them, ruining their clothes. Minor and recurring * Phil Mygrave (voiced by Rob Paulsen) – Dick's stunt coordinator and brother and uncle to Riley and Todd. He is not very good with measurements, as he doesn't use proper units of measurements, rather just \\"tweaking the thingy on the whatchimacallit a smidge\\". He has also been married multiple times, and has poor advice for maintaining a relationship. He was twice replaced by Riley. First when Riley felt that his setting up of Dick's stunts were unprofessional and dangerous, and nearly ruins Dick's career by making all his stunts too safe, and second when Riley tried to get Dick a better love coach, and almost ended up costing Dick his stunt secrets. His name is a play on the phrase \\"fill my grave\\", referring to his shoddy assembly of Dick's stunts, a fact only noticed by C.A.R.T.E.R. * Agent B (voiced by Carolyn Seymour) – Agent K's mother and Todd and Riley's grandmother. She is the headmistress of the Royal Academy of Spies. She seems to not get along with K before the episode \\"London Calling\\", but in the episode they reconcile and B became a loving grandmother with Riley and Todd. * Agent G (voiced by Michael York) – Agent K's father and Todd and Riley's grandfather. He is the chief inventor of the Royal Academy of Spies, and gave cool presents to Todd and Riley in the episode \\"London Calling\\". He scared Dick when he saw the five clones of Agent G, claiming that no one would like 5 fathers-in-law. * Gordo Glideright (voiced by Bruce Campbell) – Dick's stunt rival. He is always trying to steal Dick's stunt secrets. He once had Phil Mygrave as his stunt coordinator, and injured himself. He also tried to steal Dick's stunt secrets during his time as Dick's love coach. * Dustin Dreamlake (voiced by Jason Marsden) – A parody of Justin Timberlake. Riley's idol. He danced at Riley's 13th birthday party/Also on the holiday special. * Ace Palmero (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) – Local news reporter of Pleasant Hills, he always refers to himself as \\"I, Ace Palmero\\". A recurring gag involves only his profile being shown on TV with the camera changing whenever he turns to face it. * Dr. Hans Herkmer (voiced by Jeff Bennett) – A scientist who works for the space program. He worked with Dick Daring in becoming a Space pilot in \\"Space Family Daring\\". He also was his replacement stunt coordinator in \\"Jumping Mad\\", and almost ruined his career as a stuntman by making all of Dick's stunts too safe, and replacing him with a monkey. * Amanda McMurphy (voiced by Candi Milo) – A hard-hitting investigator reporter who helped Riley with the school newspaper. She also got the story on how Todd's rat was able to reverse the aging process. She eventually found out about Riley and Todd's Fleemco phones and asked them to replace her because she was tired of working for the George Stapler Middle School. * Fabian Le'Tool (voiced by Rob Paulsen) – A professional male hairstylist who gives Riley a full makeover for a dance. He also prepares Todd's hair for a press conference about Todd's reversing the aging process. There is usually a running gag that reveals the fact he wears a wig (even by himself). * Davey Hunkerhoff (voiced by Zac Efron) – A super hot lifeguard (and a younger spoofed version of David Hasselhoff) that Riley used to make Johnny Hitswell jealous in the episode \\"Davey Hunkerhoff\\" when he refused to notice her. However, he actually had feelings for Riley, which inevitably led to complications between the two. * Skye Blossoms (voiced by Tara Strong) – A common replacement. A hippie who refuses to judge people and believes the answers to all of your questions are \\"what you feel the answer is.\\" * Mr. Vanderbosh (voiced by Rob Paulsen) – Riley's stern teacher who sent Riley to double detention after she accidentally ripped his pants, and later gave her a quadruple detention. He also sent Riley and Tasumi to the guidance office in \\"Best friends For-Never\\". He's usually mean at times. * The Kelpmans (voiced by Chip Chinery and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn) – Next door neighbors to the Darings. They were once replaced on Halloween by the Zupecks. It turned out that they worked on developing ice creams which made them too busy to prepare any Halloween decorations. * Lady Lady (voiced by Grey DeLisle) – A professional wrestler who settled Tasumi and Riley's feud for Todd in \\"Best Friends For-Never?\\".

He announced Lady Lady's Marriage to Canadian Knucklehead in \\"Serf's Up.\\" * Celebrity Starr (voiced by Miley Cyrus in the first appearance, Jessica DiCicco in the second appearance) – This celebrity was first found replacing Shelton's imaginary girlfriend, Zelda because Shelton had defended Riley when Sierra put a love note in Riley's locker saying it was from Shelton. Riley felt bad and had Zelda replaced with Celebrity who liked nearsighted nerds. She became so annoying that Shelton broke up with her. Even with that she vowed to never let him go causing him to lose his glasses making him a \\"complete hottie\\", which wasn't her taste and she broke up with him. In contrary to all that there was gossip going around that Shelton broke up with her, which he did. She returned to get revenge on the young nerd by making a movie to dehumanize him. She ended up casting Todd in hopes to woo him. In the end, Todd turned her plan around and protected his friend. She instead made a movie to make fun of Todd. Also appeared as one of Scorpius' minions in \\"Irreplaceable\\". * Zephremiah and Silent Joe (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) – a pair of twins that are friends of Todd's. They were both in Todd's boy choir. Zephremiah apparently likes sports. His twin brother, Silent Joe, is apparently sensitive and rarely talks and communicates by grunting. Joe only talks in \\"Boyz Roq\\" when he and his brother are arguing about which one is the sensitive one. * Splatter Train – A fictitious character in a recurring horror movie throughout the show. One of these times is when Todd has a sleepover and shows a scary movie with this character in it, (I think I can, I think I can, splatter you!), and another is in Riley's flashback where she was on a date with Johnny Hitswell at the movies. * Tiny Evil (voiced by Jason Marsden) – An enemy of Agent K. He is first mentioned in \\"Riley's Birthday\\" when Agent K convinced Dustin Dreamlake to sing at her party by telling him that she needed his help capturing \\"the cleverly disguised spy known as Tiny Evil\\".

He has a scorpion tail-shaped beard and is usually seen trying to take over the world in some way. He's also known for speaking with a lisp. In \\"The Spy Who Wasn't Riley,\\", he tried to destroy Antarctica with a giant laser cannon. In another episode, he was seen relaxing on a beach that Todd and Riley happened to be on at the time. In \\"The Rizzle\\", Todd finds out that he needs glasses, but Agent K thinks he has been infected with \\"Dr. Scorpius' Genetically Crafted Island Eye-Fog\\". * Goober and T-Bone (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker and Jess Harnell) – Radio DJs who are idolized by Todd. Throughout the show, they will make random appearances where they host radio contests, etc. Usually these contests will involve the Party Peacock in some way. They were replaced by Buzz Winters in the episode \\"Phone-less In Pleasant Hills\\" when he found Riley's Fleemco phone. * Buck Spikes (voiced by John DiMaggio)- a tough baseball coach who replaced Todd and Riley's old coach, Pops. Spike keeps pushing kids to the limit, and when they strike out, he cruelly throws them into a cage. Spikes does not appear until the series finale, \\"Irreplaceable,\\" as one of Dr. Scorpius' minions. * 'Puter Dude 13 (voiced by Jeff Bennett) – A \\"cool and mysterious recluse\\" (he's really a nerd) who runs the online interactive game, Fleemster. He was only seen in one episode where he met Todd and Riley after Todd got too obsessed with Fleemster. * Heather Hartley – The \\"Her Girl\\" for Teen Swoon Magazine. She has an outrageous hairstyle and usually carries around her pet turtle on a leash. According to Tasumi, \\"she was on the cover because she was famous, but she was famous for being on the cover\\". Anyway, she was replaced by Riley after she finally got sick of everyone at her school emulating her, only to become the new Her Girl herself. * Petrov (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) – Another enemy of Agent K. Has appeared in a few episodes where he is usually opposed by Agent K and promptly apprehended by her. * Dr. Clonemaster – Yet another Agent K rival. He was seen only in the episode, \\"The Means Justify the Trend\\", in a flashback of Agent K. The cause of this flashback was Riley attempting to confide in her mother about everyone in her school dressing just like Heather Hartley, (see above). After Riley told her about this, she fears that the evil Dr. Clonemaster is up to his old tricks again, and promptly leaves to fight him. * Dingo McGee (voiced by Jeff Bennett and Carlos Alazraqui) – The replacement sent by Fleemco when Todd got sick of an archaeologist treating them like babies on a field trip in the episode \\"Field Trippin'\\". He's an adventurous, usually reckless, explorer who plays the didgeridoo. He also returned in a later episode where he hosted the popular TV show, Volcano Island, in which the families of Buzz Winters, Shelton Klutzberry, and Todd and Riley Daring all competed. He descends from Australia. * Robo Fleem SGX (voiced by Diedrich Bader) – A giant security robot that replaced the incompetent security guard at Todd's school in \\"The Insecurity Guard\\". However, the robot later went crazy and tried to destroy Riley when she tried to return it to Fleemco. This robot is the reason George Washington Middle School became George Stapler Middle School, because it threatened to destroy a teacher if she didn't say Todd was right the George Stapler was the first President of the United States. Its head also makes cameo appearances in the School in the episodes \\"Ratted Out\\" and \\"She Works Hard for the Movies\\". Another one was manufactured by Dr. Scorpius in \\"Irreplaceable\\" to destroy Todd's friends. * Mrs. Shusher (voiced by Candi Milo and Tara Strong) – The shush-happy librarian at George Stapler Middle School. Todd got sick of her forcing everyone to be quiet, and later replaced her with a librarian who was the complete opposite of her. She returned later in the episode when her replacement was returned by Todd and Riley. * Gammazor, Mecha-Gammazor, and Grammazor – All supposed enemies of Tasumi. There are pictures of them on her \\"list\\" whenever she brings it out and threatens to put Riley on it. They both possibly descend Godzilla, Mecha- Godzilla, and as a running gag, Grammazor which only appeared in the episode Tasumi Unmasked. * Garth the Janitor (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) – the school janitor that is constantly being replaced by Todd and (more often) Riley when they need a quick replacement. Garth is not very enthusiastic about his job and is extremely lazy. He is also not very bright but seems to know that whenever he inconveniences the Darings, he gets to go somewhere nice (usually). He is also the leader of the school Smite Club and was also one of Doctor Scorpius's minions in \\"Irreplaceable.\\" * Mrs. Fragile (voiced by J. P. Manoux) – a replacement who is very fragile. She becomes very upset when Buzz pronounces her name \\"fragile\\" instead of \\"Frah heel leh.\\" She also becomes upset when she thinks Riley and Tasumi are acting dumb to take advantage of the substitute teacher. Locations *Pleasant Hills – A typical American town where the show is set. * The Fun O' Sphere – An extremely cool and popular hangout for kids like Todd and Jacobo. It features an arcade and an foreign food court. Todd had his German teacher replaced in order to be allowed to go there in the episode \\"German Squirmin'\\". In another episode, Buzz bet Todd 100 Fun O' Sphere prize tickets if Todd's dad could beat his dad in the Pleasant Hills Septathalon. Todd then has a vision of him buying a giant T-Rex with his prize tickets. * Volcano Island – An extremely popular reality show where the biggest celebrities, (including Heather Hartley, Ace Palmero, Dustin Dreamlake, and Celebrity Starr) all battle for survival. In a later episode, the Winters, Klutzberry, and Daring families all competed on Volcano Island in a special family edition of the show. * Camp Notalottadoe – A camp with a pretty self-explanatory name that Todd and Riley go to in Season Two of the show. Riley is made a camp counselor and given power over Todd, Shelton, and Buzz, but exploits this power and goes out for a night with other camp counselors, an action that leads to the aforementioned kids getting lost in the woods. * Obrich Gardens – The local zoo in Pleasant Hills which is looked down upon by Riley as it is full of animals shoved into extremely narrowed cages. She later replaces Hiram Smeck, a worker at this zoo (who was very underpaid), which only leads to more trouble as a result. She releases all the animals, and the remainder of the episode was spent getting them back. At the end of the episode, they went to the man in charge of the zoo, Mr. Rottswillow, who, after some coaxing, agreed to let the animals roam free on his golf course instead. * The Royal Spy Academy – A school located in England where people learn how to be spies. This school was attended by Agent K, and is currently run by her mother, Agent B. Todd and Riley secretly enrolled in this school when Agent K's father took C.A.R. back to London with him in the episode \\"London Calling\\". They later took part in a high-speed chase to get the Spyclopedia back from Clive, C.A.R.'s evil replacement, when it was taken from the Royal Spy Academy. * Fleemco – A company founded in 1989 by Colonel Cadmus K. Fleem, which is currently run today by Conrad Fleem. Fleemco is known for its many consumer products, such as FleemSol, Fleemer steamer, OxiFleem detergent, Fleem Brite toothpaste, Fleem Dream mattresses, FleemPod MP3 player, FleemDows computers, Fleem Star Line, which operates the steamship Fleemtanic, and Fleemsoft fabric softener. It is also known for its many online ventures, including Fleemster, Fleemsody, FleemBay, and Fleembly But by far the most distinguishing characteristic of Fleemco is its ability to replace any given person at any given time, depending on the preference of its customers, of course. However, a customer must have a FleemTel cellphone in order to access this Fleemco service. * George Stapler Middle School – The school that both Todd and Riley attend. It used to be called George Washington Middle School, however the name was changed in the episode \\"The Insecurity Guard\\" when Todd's Robo Fleem SGX intimidated his teacher into stating that George Stapler was in fact the first president of the United States' real name instead of George Washington. * Le Petit Formage – A French restaurant where Riley went with Johnny Hitswell on a date. Todd's parents later forced him to replace the American waiters there with real waiters from France in an attempt to make Riley's date absolutely perfect. However, this didn't turn out so well, as the French waiters never showed up, and Todd and his parents therefore had to disguise themselves as the waiters instead. The restaurant's name means \\"small cheese\\" in French. * Carlos & Ed's Tacos – A fast food restaurant that is first seen in \\"The Rizzle\\" when Todd imagines himself as having glasses. In his imagination, the sun reflects off his glasses and melts different letters off this sign so that it reads \\"Closed\\". It is again seen in \\"A Buzzwork Orange\\" in the flashback where Jacobo and Buzz meet. * Uncle Scorpion's Taco Shack – A restaurant in Spain. Agent K travels here as she believes that this is a cleverly disguised hideout of Dr. Scorpius. * Pleasant Pop Popcorn – Another restaurant in Pleasant Hills that Todd destroyed with the heat vision coming from his gigantic glasses (only in his imagination, of course).

This particular species of blue-ringed octopus is known as one of the most toxic marine animals in the world.  Physical characteristics  The greater blue-ringed octopus is, despite its vernacular name, is a small octopus whose size does not exceed 10 centimeters, arms included, for an average weight of 80 grams. Its common name comes from the relatively large size of its blue rings (7 to 8 millimeters in diameter), which are larger than those of other members of the genus and help to distinguish this type of octopus. The head is slightly flattened dorsoventrally (front to back) and finished in a tip. Its eight arms are relatively short. There is variable ring patterns on the mantle of Hapalochlaena lunulata with varied coloration in correlation to their ambient environment, from yellow ocher to light brown or even white-ish (when inactive). The blue rings, which number around 60, are spread throughout the entirety of its skin. The rings are roughly circular in shape and are based on a darker blotch than the background color of the skin. A black line, with thickness varying to increase contrast and visibility, borders the electric blue circles. The blue rings are an aposematic adornment to clearly show to all potential predators that the octopus is highly venomous. The octopus also has characteristic blue lines running through its eyes. Variable ring patterns on mantles of Hapalochlaena lunulata  Flashing behavior  The octopus usually flashes its iridescent rings as a warning signal, each flash lasting around a third of a second. To test the theory if blue-ringed octopuses could produce their own blue iridescence, scientists bathed the octopus samples in a wide range of chemicals that were known to affect chromatophores and iridophores. It was found that none of the chemicals used affected the octopuses ability to produce its blue rings. It was also found that after examining the blue rings (specifically the iridophores) were seen to shift to the UV end of the spectrum which is a defining characteristic of multi-layer reflectors. It was also found that the iridophores are nicely tucked into the modified skin folds, kind of like pouches, which could be contracted by the muscles that connect the center of each ring to the rim. When the muscles then relax, the muscles around the perimeter of the ring contract which in turn causes the pouch to open to expose the iridescent flash. The octopus can then expand the brown chromatophores on either side of its ring to enhance the contrast of its iridescence. After all of the testing was complete, it was determined that the muscle contracting mechanisms was key to how the blue-ringed octopus portrayed its iridescent signaling success. Distribution and habitat The greater blue-ringed octopus is a benthic animal that has a solitary way of life and is widespread throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-West Pacific, from Sri Lanka to the Philippines and from Australia to Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. The animal prefers shallow waters with a mixed seabed (such as rubble, reefs and sandy areas). As is true for all octopuses, it lives in a burrow and only comes out to search for food or a mate. The entrance of the shelter is littered with remains from meals (empty shells and crab shell and legs) and is easily identifiable.  Diet  The blue-ringed octopus diet typically consists of small crabs and shrimp. They also tend to take advantage of small injured fish if they can catch them. Its known hunting behavior consists of pounces on its prey, seizing it with its arms, and then pulling it towards its mouth. It uses its horny beak to pierce through the tough crab or shrimp exoskeleton, releasing its venom. The venom paralyzes the muscles required for movement, which effectively kills the prey.  Sex identification and mating behavior  The initiation of physical contact is completely independent from sex, size, or residency status which left no notable changes of behavior based on sex alone. However, Spermatophores are only released during sexual interaction with females but not with males which indicates that upon copulation, the male can distinguish the difference on whether to inseminate or not. The copulation times between male-female are roughly 160.5 minutes, while the copulation times with the male-male interactions lasted about 30 seconds. Ultimately the studies that were conducted determined that until copulation occurs, prior to insertion of the hectocotylus, the male cannot determine the difference in sex. Interestingly enough, the male recognized the difference in sex after it inserted its hectocotylus because it would only inseminate the female.  Reproduction  The breeding season varies according to geographical area. The female lays between 60 and 100 eggs, which are kept under the female's arms during the incubation period, which lasts about a month. Newborns have a brief planktonic development passage before settling on the seabed. The mating ritual begins when a male approaches a female and begins to caress her with his modified arm, the hectocotylus. Males then climb on the female's back, at times completely engulfing the female’s mantle obstructing her vision. The hectocotylus is inserted under the mantle of the female and spermatophores are released into the female’s oviduct. Males die after mating. The female then lays between 50 and 100 eggs and guards them by carrying them under her tentacle until they hatch about 50 days later into planktonic paralarvae. The female then dies as she refuses to eat while she guards her eggs. The blue-ringed octopus is about the size of a pea when hatched then grows to reach the size of a golf ball as an adult. They mature quickly and begin mating the following autumn. Octopuses, squid, and cuttlefishes have a short lifespan of about 2 years.  Potential danger  The greater blue-ringed octopus is capable of inflicting a deadly bite to its predators that can potentially be fatal to humans. Octopuses from genus Hapalochlaena have two kinds of venom glands that impregnate their saliva. One is used to immobilize the hunted crustaceans before eating them. The second, tetrodotoxin, is used for defense and is found in several other sea creatures such as pufferfish. Tetrodotoxin, also known as TTX, is secreted from the posterior salivary glands which is connected to the beak. The greater blue-ringed octopus is known as one of the most venomous marine animals in the entire world. For humans, the minimal lethal dose of tetrodotoxin is estimated to be about 10,000 MU, which is about 2 mg in crystal form. TTX does not decompose during heating or boiling and there is no known antidote or antitoxin for this toxin. It is believed that the TTX serves as a hunting tool for paralyzing prey as well as a defense mechanism to other predators. This toxin is a powerful neurotoxin and a strong paralytic. The bite is painless to humans but effects appear any time between 15 and 30 minutes and up to four hours, though the rate of onset of symptoms varies by individual, and children are more sensitive to the toxins. The first phase of the poisoning is characterized by facial and extremity paresthesia, and the victim feels tingling and/or numbness on the face, tongue, lips, and other body extremities. The victim may also suffer excessive sweating, severe headaches coupled with dizziness, speech problems, hypersalivation, moderate emesis, movement disorders, a feeling of weakness, cyanosis to extremities and lips and petechial hemorrhages on the body. The second phase of poisoning usually occurs after eight hours and includes hypotension and generalized spastic muscle paralysis. Death may occur between 20 minutes and 24 hours after the onset of symptoms, usually resulting from respiratory paralysis. Throughout each of the phases of poisoning, the state of consciousness of the victim is unaffected.  Genetics  Greater Blue Ringed Octopuses express VGSC (HlNav1) gene mutations that greatly reduce the channels TTX binding affinity which in turn render the octopus TTX resistant. TTX selectively binds and blocks the ion-conducting pore of the voltage-gated sodium channel which are responsible for the ability of an organism to move. The greater blue- ringed octopus naturally produced TTX and bears a phenotype in the genus for the resistance to TTX. It was found that the resistance was caused by a combination of amino acid substitutions in the TTX binding sites for the primary voltage-gated sodium ion channel.

Stahl was an active major-league player when he died by suicide during spring training before the 1907 season. Career In his rookie 1897 season with the Boston Beaneaters, he batted .354, and over his first six seasons, he averaged over .300. In 1899, he had six hits in a game, and in the 1903 World Series, he hit three triples. By 1904, including his time with the Beaneaters and the Boston Americans, Stahl had been a key part of four pennant winning teams in seven seasons. In , he was named acting manager of the Americans after his friend Jimmy Collins was suspended\\"Chick Stahl, Talent and Tragedy\\" and decided to focus on his playing, and also due to the club's ownership opting for a change following a poor season by the club. He was officially named player-manager on December 4, 1906. In 1,304 games played, Stahl compiled a .305 batting average (1546-5069) with 858 runs scored, 219 doubles, 118 triples, 36 home runs, 622 RBI, 189 stolen bases, 470 walks, an on-base percentage of .369 and slugging percentage of .416 in 10 major-league seasons. In the 1903 World Series, he hit .303 (10-33), scoring 6 runs and recording 3 RBI, helping the Boston Americans win the first modern World Series. Death In March 1907, Stahl died by suicide during spring training in West Baden, Indiana, by drinking four ounces of carbolic acid. The reasoning behind Stahl's suicide has remained a mystery for over a century. He was known as a carefree, fun-loving man and had many love affairs going on throughout the country. He had mentioned suicide days before in Louisville, Kentucky, prompting some teammates to take the carbolic acid from him. His final words to some of teammates were \\"Boys, I just couldn't help it. It drove me to it.\\" What \\"it\\" exactly was remains a mystery. A 1908 newspaper article claims that he was despondent because he had been tasked with discharging his friend Collins from the team. Cy Young reluctantly took over as manager to start the season, but he was replaced six games into the season. Collins was traded to Philadelphia in June 1907. Stahl's widow mysteriously died a year and a half later.Bill Ferber (2007) A Game of Baseball: The Orioles, The Beaneaters and The Battle For The 1897 Pennant, University of Nebraska Press, , pg. 251 Just prior to her death, Julia Stahl was seen walking in a poor area of Boston while lavishly dressed. However, no bystanders seem to have seen the events of the last moments of her life. Chick Stahl was not related to Jake Stahl, despite contemporary baseball sources listing them as brothers. Stahl was mentioned along with teammates Bill Dinneen and Cy Young in the revival of the song \\"Tessie\\" (2004) by Dropkick Murphys.

Dresser Hill Road begins in Quinebaug, Connecticut, at Route 197 where it is a short (approximately ) local road erroneously signed as Connecticut Route 31 changing to Route 31 at the Massachusetts state line, then proceeding through Dudley and into Charlton, winding over Dresser Hill with several moderately steep grades and some tight corners. In Charlton, it intersects U.S. Route 20 a few miles east of the I-90 and I-84 interchange. This provides its only connection with an interstate highway. In Charlton, it is known as Masonic Home Road and Brookfield Road. It then passes Lambs Pond. Route 31 entering Paxton from Holden. Route 31 then enters Spencer, where it parallels the Podunk Pike (Route 49) for several miles. As Charlton Road, it passes the Spencer State Forest. In the center of Spencer, it crosses Route 9. It then turns north towards Paxton; this stretch is scenic and hilly. Several warning signs are seen here for sharp corners warning of a maximum safe speed of . After a couple long, sweeping corners through a forest of pine trees, Route 31 enters Paxton. Paxton Center School comes after a treed-in section. The intersections of Route 31, Route 122, and Route 56 comprise Paxton Center. Route 31 is variously known as West Street and Holden Street in Paxton; it runs east-west in this section. It passes over a hill past Richards Memorial Library, then uses Grove Street for approximately . In Holden, Route 31 passes Asnebumskit Pond and is bridged over Kendall Reservoir. After the intersection with Route 122A it passes Gale Free Public Library and heads north once again. The road heads into an increasingly rural area as the hills get steeper and longer. Route 31 then enters Princeton and begins climbing very steeply; it gains about in approximately . Entering the center of Princeton, it joins Route 62 and turns east to avoid going over Mount Wachusett. The mountain is instead connected by Mountain Road. After separating from Route 62, Route 31 joins Route 140 and becomes Fitchburg Road near Paradise Pond. It passes through a portion of Leominster State Forest in Westminster before an interchange with a freeway segment of Route 2. After this interchange, Route 31 becomes a city street, having shared roadway with Route 2A and a wrong-way concurrency with Route 12. It then passes through downtown Fitchburg. As it leaves Fitchburg it is called Ashby State Road. In Ashby, it connects with Route 119 before reaching the New Hampshire state border, where it becomes New Hampshire Route 31. The stretch of Route 31 from Paxton Center to Holden Center is named the Chief Robert J. Mortell Memorial Highway, after Paxton chief of police Robert Mortell, who was killed in the line of duty on February 1, 1994, in the deeply wooded area bordering Route 31.

It was originally released in 1968 by Polydor and blends traditional Brazilian music styles with American and British psychedelia. The album includes a cover of The Mamas & The Papas' \\"Once Was a Time I Thought\\", translated into \\"Tempo no Tempo\\", and a cover of \\"Le premier bonheur du jour\\", previously recorded by Françoise Hardy. It was reissued in 1999 on Omplatten Records and again in 2006 by Omplatten's (and Polydor's) parent company, Universal Records. The album has received critical acclaim around the world, and was put at #12 on Mojo magazine list of \\"50 Most Out-There Albums of All Time\\".http://rateyourmusic.com/list/fedderedder/mojo_magazines_50_most_out_there_albums It appears at number 9 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 greatest Brazilian albums of all time. It is also listed at 39 on the Rollingstones Top 40 Stoner albums. It also appears at number 9 on the Rolling Stones's 10 Greatest Latin Rock Albums of All Time. Background Os Mutantes debuted at a TV Record show, which went on air before the Jovem Guarda show, called O Pequeno Mundo de Ronnie Von. The band was in charge of the soundtrack, mostly playing rock versions of erudite compositions, and also covering hits of The Beatles and other bands. After their debut, the band was invited to be a part of many other shows, including Jovem Guarda itself, but they ended up being rejected because they wouldn't accept the many instruments the band would use on stage. In 1967 they met Gilberto Gil, through Rogério Duprat. They recorded two songs with Gil: \\"Bom Dia\\" and \\"Domingo No Parque\\"; with the last one, they participated of the tropicalist debut in the III Festival de Música Popular Brasileira (Third Festival of Popular Brazilian Music), where they were awarded with the second place. After that, they started to get more involved with the tropicalist movement, being a part of memorable moments such as the presentation of the song \\"É Proibido Proibir\\" (It's Forbidden to Forbid) at the III Festival Internacional da Canção, where they got booed; and at the show Divino, Maravilhoso, the last major tropicalist manifestation.

Kikomun Creek Provincial Park has a campground with five lakes, an abundance of the endangered painted turtles, many mountain bike trails throughout, two beautiful sandy beaches among its attractions. Geography Kikomun Creek is situated in the southern region of the Rocky Mountain Trench, on the eastern shores of a man-made reservoir along the Kootenay River. This 685-hectare park provides recreational access to Lake Koocanusa, whose name is supposedly a combination of Kootenay, Canada and United States. The park encompasses large open grasslands, ponderosa pine forests and many small lakes. The grasslands in the area were used historically as grazing areas for the horses of the Ktunaxa people and the cattle of early settlers. Throughout the park, evidence of glacial activity thousands of years ago is evident in the form of ridges, valleys and water-filled depressions. Kikomun Creek Provincial Park is located 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Fernie and 41 miles (65 km) southeast of Cranbrook in the Canadian Rockies region of British Columbia. Ecology Kikomun Creek Provincial Park is home to one of the British Columbia's largest populations of western painted turtles, which are named for their distinctive red and yellow markings on their undersides. These turtles are often seen sunbathing on logs on Hidden Lake and Surveyors’ Lake. The park's wetlands provide habitat for beaver, muskrat, long-toed salamanders, blue herons and mallards. Other wildlife in the area includes badgers, elk, black bears, coyotes, cougars and deer. For birdwatchers, the park is also home to osprey, owls, bald eagles, red-tailed hawks and American kestrels. For those interested in fishing, Hidden, Surveyors’, Engineers, Muskrat, Skunk and Fisher Lakes contain smallmouth bass, brook and rainbow trout. Koocanusa Lake contains bull, rainbow and westslope cutthroat trout, kokanee, and mountain whitefish. Watercraft are permitted on the lakes, however powerboats are restricted to Koocanusa Lake, which also has the only boat launch. During the summer months, educational interpretive programs are offered and include such events as guided walks, slide shows and children's programs. Amenities The park provides camping, swimming, hiking, mountain biking and fishing, making it one of the most popular outdoor destinations in the East Kootenays. Surveyors’ Lake has sandy beaches, picnic areas and change houses. There are also some easy hiking trails that circle Hidden and Surveyors’ Lakes. Throughout the park, there are many old roads and railway beds that are perfect for mountain biking that lead to some interesting geological features.

The heritage farm includes the 1906 General Store Museum and Manchester House Hotel & Post Office, as well as costumed interpreters, friendly farm animals and an orchard playground. The focal point is the General store, once a temperance hotel built on pilings and linked to the railway station by a ramp to its second storey. Thomas and Eliza Kilby converted it to a general store in 1906. Their son, Acton, took over the reins in 1922 and inherited the store when Thomas died in 1928. He and his wife Jessie would continue to operate and manage the store until 1977. In 1926, automobiles began to appear at Harrison Mills, and the Kilbys installed gravity-fed gas pumps that served travellers till 1977. In 1973, Acton received a plaque from Imperial Oil, rewarding him for fifty years of service. Situated on a flood plain, the General Store and other buildings were elevated and connected with boardwalks. Today, visitors can see a fascinating gallery of store products and enjoy firsthand involvement with the intriguing artefacts of the farm and its current livestock.

Construction began in 1586, when Hideyoshi had taken the post of Kampaku, and required nineteen months to complete. Its total area was almost equal to the Imperial Palace Enclosure. It was decorated exceptionally lavishly, but had thick walls and a moat more reminiscent of fortresses such as that at Osaka. It was located in present-day Kamigyō, on the site where the Imperial palace had stood in the Heian period. In late 1587, following the Jurakudai's completion, Hideyoshi moved there from his castle at Osaka, just after his victory over the Shimazu family in Kyūshū. He made it the base for his administration and invited Go-Yōzei, the reigning emperor, to stay there in the first month of 1588. Maeda Geni, one of his Five Commissioners, studied previous receptions of emperors and the requisite protocols. The emperor was escorted by many Court nobles, mounted samurai (including Hideyoshi's foremost generals), and innumerable men at arms. Hideyoshi rode immediately afterwards, the highest ranking Court official in his capacity as Kampaku. Within the Jurakudai itself, the great daimyōs awaited the emperor, most importantly Tokugawa Ieyasu and Oda Nobukatsu. The emperor stayed in the palace for five days, and the daimyos gathered there were asked to sign an oath to the following principles: # We who are assembled here weep tears of gratitude for the presence of His Majesty. # If any evil persons should attempt to confiscate Crown estates or the property of Court nobles, we will take action against them, and we bind ourselves and our descendants to carry out this undertaking. # We swear that we will obey the commands of the Regent down to the smallest particular. Kusunoki Masatora is our source for these events, having recorded them in his diary. In 1589, the most important Court nobles and daimyos were again invited to the Jurakudai. Here Hideyoshi displayed a vast amount - approximately 5.5 tonnes - of gold and silver heaped on plates; it was then distributed among those gathered. When Hideyoshi resigned from the post of Kanpaku in 1591, his nephew Toyotomi Hidetsugu assumed the position; he took up residence at Jurakudai with Hideyoshi's other nephew, Toyotomi Hidekatsu. Hidetsugu hosted a second visit for Go-Yōzei. However, Hideyoshi began to construct his new castle in 1594 and when Hidetsugu was forced to commit seppuku in 1595, the Jurakudai was dismantled, with many parts being moved to Fushimi and reassembled. Front gate of Myōkaku-ji Some buildings of the Jurakudai survive, among them the Hiun-kaku at Nishi Hongan-ji, the Karamon at Daitoku-ji, and the front gate at Myōkaku-ji (all in Kyoto).

The book is divided into three parts just as Either/Or was in 1843 and many of his other discourses were. Kierkegaard had been working toward creating a place for the concepts of guilt and sin in the conscience of the single individual. He discussed the ideas generated by both Johann von Goethe and Friedrich Hegel concerning reason and nature. This book is his response to the ideas that nature and reason are perfect. The first part of the book is a challenge to those who say they are not guilty of anything. Kierkegaard plays the questioner and asks tough questions throughout the text, such as, \\"What is patience? Is not patience the courage that freely takes upon itself the suffering that cannot be avoided?\\" \\"Are you now living in such a way that you are aware of being a single individual and thereby aware of your eternal responsibility before God.\\" \\"Is not evil, just like evil people, at odds with itself, divided in itself?\\" \\"What is it to be more ashamed before others than before oneself but to be more ashamed of seeming than being?\\" \\"Should not he who planted the ear hear? But is not the opposite conclusion just as beautiful and convincing: Should not he whose life is sacrificing love believe that God is love?\\" \\"What means do you use to perform your work; is the means just as important to you as the end, just exactly as important?\\"Soren Kierkegaard, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong p. 118, 135, 34, 53, 69–70, 140 The second part has to do with the idea that nature is perfect. He goes back to Job as he did in his Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843. He says, \\"The silent friends did not compare Job with themselves—this did not happen until their respect (in which they silently held him) ceased and they broke the silence in order to attack the sufferer with speeches, but their presence prompted Job to compare himself with himself. No individual can be present, even though in silence, in such a way that his presence means nothing at all by way of comparison. At best, this can be done by a child, who indeed has a certain likeness to the lilies of the field and the birds of the air.\\" \\"God isolated the human being, made every human being this separate and distinct individual, which is implied in the unconditional character of those first thoughts. The individual animal is not isolated, is not unconditionally separate entity; the individual animal is a number and belongs under what that most famous pagan thinker has called the animal category: the crowd. The human being who in despair turns away from those first thoughts in order to plunge into the crowd of comparisons makes himself a number, regards himself as a beast, no matter whether he by way of comparison is distinguished or lowly. But with the lilies the worried one is isolated, far away from all human or, perhaps more correctly, inhuman comparisons between individuals.\\"Soren Kierkegaard, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong pp. 161, 189–191 The third part deals with the concept of the abstract and the concrete examples. Kierkegaard wrote of individuals known only as A and B in his first book, Either/Or. He then made them less abstract by making A into the Young Man in Repetition (1843) and B into his guide, the psychiatrist Constantin Constantius. The same day that he published Repetition he published Fear and Trembling which showed Abraham as an individual who was alone with God as he considered whether to follow his commands. He continued writing until he came to the concrete human being named Christ and wrote about the joy there is in following Christ. He's not against the ethics of Hegel or the aesthetics of Goethe but thinks that following Christ is the one thing needful. And that double-mindedness is the beginning of the sickness of the spirit for the single individual. Structure The book begins with a dedication just as some of his Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses did, however, this book is not dedicated to his father, but to “That Single Individual”. He published these discourses and later wrote a longer dedication called The Crowd is UntruthThe Crowd is Untruth where he wrote: > This, which is now considerably revised and enlarged, was written and > intended to accompany the dedication to \\"that single individual,\\" which is > found in \\"Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits.\\" Copenhagen, Spring > 1847. Walter Lowrie translated The Point of View of My Work as an Author by Kierkegaard in 1939, 1962 and included My Activity as a Writer by Soren Kierkegaard (1851) in the book. Here Kierkegaard wrote, \\"I attached myself again religiously to \\"that individual\\", to whom the next essential work (after the Concluding Postscript) was dedicated. I refer to Edifying Discourses in Divers Spirits, or rather the first part of that book which is an exhortation to confession. Perhaps nobody noticed it the first time I employed the category \\"that individual\\", and nobody paid much attention to the fact that it was repeated in stereotyped form in the preface of every number of the Edifying Discourses. Religiously speaking, there is no such thing as a public, but only individuals; for religion is seriousness and seriousness is the individual.\\"The Point of View by Walter Lowrie 1939, 1962 This book has a preface and Kierkegaard has said to pay attention to the prefaces in his book of the same name. The book also has a dedication. Here is the first half of his preface. Kierkegaard thinks an individual must bring the occasion (the need) along with him or her to become the learner. On the Occasion of a Confession On the Occasion of a ConfessionSoren Kierkegaard, 1847, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong 1993 p. 325–326 was a postscript to the first section of Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions (On the Occasion of a Confessional Service). This section has also been titled Purity of Heart is to Will One ThingHere Kierkegaard wrote > Just as a person should not seek his peace through another human being and > should not build upon sand, so it also holds true that he should not rely on > any other person's work to convince him that he’s a sinner, but rather to > remind him of his own responsibility before God if he does not discover it > by himself—any other understanding is diversion. It is only a jest if I > would pass judgment on you, but it is a serious matter if you forget that > God will pass the judgment. So what is sought is given. God is near enough, > but no one without purity can see God, and sin is impurity, and therefore no > one can become aware of God without becoming a sinner. The first is a > beckoning word, and the gaze of the soul is toward the heights where the > goal is, but other words that provide the beginning are immediately heard, > and these are depressing words. And yet this is the way it is for the person > who wants to understand sin.... \\"The doctor and the pastor ask about your > health, but eternity makes you responsible for your condition.\\" Three > Discourses on Imagined Occasions p. 28 Hong translation, Purity of Heart, > Streere 1938 p. 209–210 Kierkegaard asks how an individual can find out if he or she is on the \\"right\\" path in life. Confession and repentance before God is his answer with a warning about double-mindedness. If a single individual were to ask him or herself all the questions asked in this section and try to discover all the evasions used to keep from acting single-mindedly, that person would discover that it is very difficult to say I am innocent. In Works of Love (1847) he asks his reader to \\"Imagine an enthusiast who enthusiastically wills only one thing and enthusiastically wants to sacrifice everything for the good.\\"Works of Love, Hong 1995 p. 184ff Here he is writing about the inwardness of prayer. He says, He asks, \\"What does the conscience want to emphasize by means of the awareness that you are a single individual?\\" (Hong p. 132) He answers this way: > To will, in the decision, to be and to remain with the good is truth's brief > expression for willing to do everything, and in this expression the equality > is maintained that recognizes no distinction with regard to that more > essential diversity of life or of the human condition: to be acting or to be > suffering, since the one who is suffering can, in the decision, also be with > the good. …. With respect to the highest, with respect to willing to do > everything, it makes no difference at all, God be praised, how big or how > little the task. Oh, how merciful the eternal is to us human beings! Soren > Kierkegaard, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong p. 79–80 Later, in Works of Love, Kierkegaard sums up the essence of what it means to have a pure heart using a metaphors from Archimedes and the New Testament. What we Learn from the Lilies in the Field and from the Birds in the Air  The first discourse (To Be Contented with Being a Human Being) deals with comparison and choice and how to trust God with the choice once made. He may have been echoing Goethe's Propylaen in which Goethe had written \\"The youth, when Nature and Art attract him, thinks that with a vigorous effort he can soon penetrate into the innermost sanctuary; the man, after long wanderings, finds himself still in the outer court. Such an observation has suggested our title. It is only on the step, in the gateway, the entrance, the vestibule, the space between the outside and the inner chamber, between the sacred and the common, that we may ordinarily tarry with our friends.\\"Johann Goethe Introduction to the Propyläen 1798 Kierkegaard writes about nature differently than Goethe but similarly because both see Nature as teachers of human kind and Kierkegaard wrote very much about \\"the inner being\\"; the soul.Either/Or II p. 167 Hong, Fear and Trembling Hong pp. 60–61, Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong p. 79, Repetition p. 200ff Hong, Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Hong p. 458, 499, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong p. 269ff, 328–329 Kierkegaard wrote a great story about a lily and a naughty bird. It begins like this: The second discourse deals with diverting oneself from worries by \\"learning from the bird how glorious it is to be a human being.\\"Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong p. 194 David F. Swenson translated several of Kierkegaard's discourses which were published in 1958 through the efforts of Paul L Holmer. Kierkegaard wrote of The Glory of Our Common Humanity.The Glory of Our Common Humanity Swenson translation This was the second of three discourses that were all based on the text from Matthew 6 verses 24 to the end. It was titled How Glorious It Is to Be a Human Being by Howard V Hong when he translated Kierkegaard's book in 1993. > The structure of the three discourses about the lilies and the birds is as > follows: the first is esthetic, the second ethical, the third religious. > Journal and Papers of Soren Kierkegaard VIII A 1 1847 Kierkegaard writes about the gift given to human beings that nature doesn't have, conscience. With the use of conscience we can know about time and the future. Something nature cannot know.Soren Kierkegaard, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong p. 193–198 He sums the human ability to love and the distinctiveness of nature up in Works of Love, which he published four months later. The third discourse was titled What Blessed Happiness is Promised in Being a Human Being by Howard V Hong. Kierkegaard is constantly stressing the importance there is in being a human being instead of a beast in the field because you have been given the gift of choice. \\"A choice. My listener, do you know how to express in a single word anything more glorious! If you talked year in and year out, could you mention anything more glorious than a choice, to have choice! It is certainly true that the sole blessing is to choose rightly, but certainly choice itself is the glorious condition.\\"Soren Kierkegaard, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong p. 206 Kierkegaard began writing about this choice in his first book Either/Or where he wrote first as the aesthetic and then as the ethicist. Hegel thinks that history and philosophy should come afterwards and explain events. Kierkegaard thinks its better to come beforehand. > Only one word more concerning the desire to teach the world what it ought to > be. For such a purpose philosophy at least always comes too late. > Philosophy, as the thought of the world, does not appear until reality has > completed its formative process, and made itself ready. History thus > corroborates the teaching of the conception that only in the maturity of > reality does the ideal appear as counterpart to the real, apprehends the > real world in its substance, and shapes it into an intellectual kingdom. > When philosophy paints its grey in grey, one form of life has become old, > and by means of grey it cannot be rejuvenated, but only known. The owl of > Minerva takes its flight only when the shades of night are gathering. * > Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) Philosophy of Right translated by > SW Dyde Queen's University Canada 1896 edition Preface xxx > Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will also > regret that; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both; > whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. > This, gentlemen, is the sum and substance of all philosophy. It is only at > certain moments that I view everything acterno modo, as Spinoza says, but I > live constantly aeterno modo. There are many who think that they live thus, > because after having done the one or the other, they combine or mediate the > opposites. But this is a misunderstanding: for the true eternity does not > lie behind either/or, but before it. Hence, their eternity will be a painful > succession of temporal moments, for they will be consumed by a two-fold > regret. *Soren Kierkegaard, Either/Or part I, Swenson p. 37–39 > It is a sign of a well brought up child to be inclined to say it is sorry > without too much pondering whether it is in the right or not, and it is > likewise a sign of a high-minded person and a deep soul if he is inclined to > repent, if he does not take God to court but repents and loves God in his > repentance. Without this, his life is nothing, only like foam. Indeed, I > assure you that if my life through no fault of my own were so interwoven > with sorrows and sufferings that I could call myself the greatest tragic > hero, could divert myself with my affliction and shock the world by naming > it, my choice is made: I strip myself of the hero's garb and the pathos of > tragedy; I am not the tormented one who can be proud of his sufferings; I am > the humbled one who feels my offense; I have only one word for what I am > suffering—guilt, only one word for my pain—repentance, only one hope before > my eyes—forgiveness.

He concludes, \\"But then in his sadness out there with the lily and the bird the worried one did indeed acquire something other than his worry to think about; he began to consider what blessed happiness is promised in being a human being. Then let the lily wither and let its loveliness become indiscernible; let the leaf fall to the ground and the bird fly away; let it become dark on the fields—God's kingdom does not change with the seasons! So let the rest be needed for a long time or a short time, let all these things have their moment when they are lacking or possessed, their moment is a subject of discussion until in death they are eternally forgotten—God's kingdom is still that which is to be sought first but which ultimately will also last through all eternities, and \\"if that which will be abolished was glorious, that which remains will be more glorious,:2 Corinthians 3:11 and if it was hard to live in want, then it must indeed be only an easier separation to die to want!Soren Kierkegaard, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong p. 212 The Gospel of Sufferings A.S Aldworth and W.S. Ferrie from Cambridge University translated The Gospel of Sufferings in 1955. The following is from his introduction. Now he begins to write of the meaning and joy there is in following Christ. It wasn't the first thing he wrote about but he did write about learning, over time, to follow Christ and while learning to also learn to confess, repent and accept as well as give forgiveness. His emphasis has been on seeking God's kingdom first (Matthew 6:33) and learning to be \\"silent before God\\".How can you tell when you are confessing Christ and when you are judging others? The Joy of It That Bold Confidence Is Able in Suffering to Take Power from the World and Has the Power to Change Scorn into Honor, Downfall into Victory p. 321-341 His first three texts are from Luke 14:27 Whoever does not carry his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple. Matthew 11:30 My yoke is beneficial, and my burden light. and It is said of him the Lord Jesus Christ: Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered Hebrews 5:8. Acts 5:41 Kierkegaard writes about why it might not be so great to have the \\"distinction\\" of being an apostle.Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong 1993 p. 327ff (333–334) they went away joyful because they had been deemed worthy to be scorned for the sake of Christ's name. He concluded this way: Kierkegaard compared a pound of gold and a pound of feathers. He views the pound of feathers as a lesser weight because of the value of gold compared to feathers. He then asks the reader to decide if a pound of temporality is equal to a pound of eternity.Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, 1847, Hong 1993 p. 318–319 Feathers and gold and temporality and eternity and numbers all have value in this world. He has seven different discourses in this third section. He seems to be using religious numbers generally while writing but always referring to Christianity specifically. Kierkegaard seems to have fulfilled his goal presented in Concluding Unscientific Postscript, where he said it had become clear to him that people had forgotten what it means to be religious (confession and repentance before God) and had also forgotten what it means to be a human being and had therefore also forgotten what it means to try to become a Christian. He put it this way. Criticism Edifiying Discourses in Diverse Spirits, also Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits was published on March 13, 1847, and is one of the first books in Søren Kierkegaard's second authorship. His first authorship included all of his books up to and including Two Ages: A Literary Review which was published March 30, 1846. He had just published his Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments on February 27, 1846. He wrote both pseudonymous books as well as books signed by his own name. His Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses were all signed by Soren Kierkegaard as author while other books, such as, Either/Or, Repetition, and The Concept of Anxiety were published under pseudonyms. Howard V. Hong says the book had no record of sales and was not reprinted in Kierkegaard's lifetime. Previously Kierkegaard had published his own books through two different bookstores, Bookdealer P. G. Philipsen Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 and C.A. Reitzel's, Printed by Biance Luno Press Repetition. This book was published \\"on an honorarium basis\\" through another Danish book publisher, Reitzel Forlag. The publishing cost was minimum. The first section was translated into English in 1938 by Douglas V. Steere and titled Purity of Heart Is To Will One Thing. Steere also wrote the introduction to David F Swenson's 1946 translation of Works of Love.Google Link to Swenson's translation of Works of Love Howard V. and Edna H. Hong translated all the discourses and Princeton University Press published them in 1993.Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong introduction xii–xiii Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong 1993, 2009 Scholars generally paid more attention to his pseudonymous writings than his discourses. Harold Victor Martin published Kierkegaard, the Melancholy Dane (1950) and had this to say about this book: Robert L Perkins of Stetson University edited The International Kierkegaard Commentary Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits in 2005. This book presents scholarly perspectives from people interested in the writings of Soren Kierkegaard. He states that A.S. Aldworth and W.S. Ferrie published Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits in three parts Purify your Hearts (1937), Consider the Lilies (1940) and Gospel of Suffering (1955), the 1955 edition was reprinted in an American edition in 1964. Gospel of Sufferings and The Lilies of the Field were translated by David F Swenson and Lillian Marvin Swenson in 1948. Perkin's book is in External Links below. Douglas V. Steere wrote a lengthy introduction to his 1938 publication of the first part of Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits. Purify your Heart of 1937 became Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing in the hands of Steere in 1938. He says Eduard Geismar (1871–1939), the Danish scholar, said of the book, \\"It seems to me that nothing that he has written has sprung so directly out of his relationship with God as this address. Anyone who wishes to understand Kierkegaard properly will do well to begin with it.\\"Steere, Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing, intro p. 13 Steere wrote Doors Into Life in 1948 and devoted his fourth chapter to Kierkegaard and Purity of Heart. He said, \\"In a strangely universal way, Kierkegaard is both ancient and modern, both a fierce desert prophet and a metropolitan sophisticate who is all too well schooled in the artifices of modern life to be deceived by them.\\"Doors Into Life Harper and Brothers p. 119ff Geismar lectured on Kierkegaard at Princeton University in 1936. He wrote the following about this book, Howard V Hong translated the wrote book in 1993 along with his wife Edna H Hong. It was translated again in 2005. Hong's 1993 introduction surmised that Kierkegaard perhaps published 500 copies of this book during his lifetime. Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions & Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits were reviewed together in 1994 by Karl Dusza for First Things MagazineFirst Things He wrote Kierkegaard wrote about the expectation of the Christian. The difference Christ made in the world is that he took away the burdens of the Christian. Kierkegaard wrote much about the consciousness of sin and wrote about the difference Christianity makes.Soren Kierkegaard, 1847 Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong pp. 240–242 James Collins, from Saint Louis University, wrote the following about Kierkegaard's Gospel of Suffering in 1953. \\"Find a point which is under fire by an atheist of the nineteenth century and which is also defended by a seventeenth century man of faith and you have found an incontrovertibly religious belief. Such is the case with suffering, which is a scandal to a Feuerbach and a matter of glory to a Pascal, but to both a distinguishing note of the Christian mode of existence. In the degree that it promotes a meditative inwardness, Christianity makes us aware of God's supreme goodness and our own distance from, and hostility towards, His holiness. A religious sense of one's own sinfulness leads neither to morbid despair nor to rationalization. It issues in a voluntary acceptance of suffering as a way of atoning for sin to God, the just judge, and a way of approaching closer to God the redeemer. In a series of discourses entitled The Gospel of Suffering, Kierkegaard establishes the relation between guilt, suffering, and the triumph of faith, much after the manner of Luther's dialectical treatment of the theme of the sinner as a believer.\\"James Collins, The Mind of Kierkegaard Princeton University Press 1953, 1983P. 221 References ;Sources * Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits translated by Howard V & Edna H Hong 1993 World Cat * Hong, Howard V. & Edna H.

Like other parabasalids, they typically have an axostyle, a pelta, a costa, and parabasal bodies. In Histomonas only one flagellum and a reduced axostyle are found, and in Dientamoeba, both are absent.  Behavior  Most species are either parasites or other endosymbionts of animals. Trichomonads reproduce by a special form of longitudinal fission, leading to large numbers of trophozoites in a relatively short time. Cysts never form, so transmission from one host to another is always based on direct contact between the sites they occupy.

Pearl/Thomas incident (1988–1989) During the 1988–89 basketball season, Pearl, then an assistant coach at Iowa, was at the center of a recruiting scandal involving Illinois. Both Illinois and Iowa were recruiting Deon Thomas, a top high school player from Chicago. Pearl lost this recruiting battle when Thomas committed to Illinois. Thereafter, Pearl called the high school student and recorded a phone conversation with Thomas, which may have been illegal depending on where Pearl originated the call. (Illinois requires prior consent of all participants to monitor or record a phone conversation according to Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 38, Sec. 14–2; however, Iowa, where Pearl was coaching at the time, only requires one party's consent to record a phone conversation.) During the conversation, Pearl asked Thomas if he had been offered an SUV and cash by Illinois assistant coach Jimmy Collins, and Thomas seemed to indicate that he had. Pearl then turned over copies of the tapes to the NCAA, accompanied by a memo describing the events. During the subsequent NCAA investigation, Thomas denied the allegations and said the story was false, that he was agreeing with Pearl only to try to get rid of him. Thomas later passed a polygraph test in which he denied Pearl's accusation of Illinois's offering cash and a car. The NCAA did not find Illinois guilty of any wrongdoing relating to Thomas's recruitment, finding that the purported evidence provided was not \\"credible, persuasive and of a kind on which reasonably prudent persons rely in the conduct of serious affairs.\\" However, since the investigation uncovered other violations, including Illinois's third major violation in six years, the NCAA cited Illinois with a \\"lack of institutional control\\" charge and implemented several recruiting restrictions and a one-year post-season ban. When Pearl and Collins were both head coaches for four years in the Horizon League, the two men never engaged in the traditional postgame handshake, reportedly due to lingering feelings over the incident. When Thomas was asked about forgiving Pearl in a 2005 interview, he was quoted as saying, \\"It's hard to forgive a snake.\\"Landman, Brian Cinderella fitted for a bull's-eye. St. Petersburg Times. March 24, 2005 Thomas went on to become the University of Illinois's all-time leading scorer. Southern Indiana (1992–2001)  In 1992, Pearl got his first head-coaching job, at Southern Indiana. He inherited a Screaming Eagles team that had won just 10 games in the previous season. Pearl posted a 22–7 record in his first season, and led the Eagles to nine straight NCAA D-II tournaments in addition to winning four Great Lakes Valley Conference titles. In 1994, USI finished with a 28–4 record en route to a loss in the D-II championship game; in 1995, the Eagles won 29 games and claimed the D–II championship behind national Player of the Year Stan Gouard. A team from the GLVC played for the National Championship every year after his first season at USI. Pearl was named the NABC Division II coach of the year after his national championship. He left USI with a 231–46 record over nine years. Milwaukee (2001–2005) Despite Pearl's success at turning Southern Indiana into a major power, it took him almost a decade to return to Division I; reportedly, he was blackballed by the Division I college coaching fraternity for his role in inadvertently revealing violations at Illinois by submitting a different, deceptive accusation.Forde, Pat. Pearl served his time in Div. II before thriving in Div. I again. ESPN, March 18, 2008. Pearl took over as head coach of Milwaukee in 2001. In just four seasons, he compiled 86 wins (including a school-record 26 in 2005, and a new Horizon League record for winning percentage) and led Milwaukee to their first NCAA tournament appearances in 2003 and 2005. Pearl led them to the Horizon League tournament title in both of those years. He also led the school to its first ever NIT bid, as well as its first-ever NCAA D–I postseason victory, in 2004. Milwaukee's 2005 NCAA Tournament run capped the best season in school history, as the Panthers won both the regular season and conference tournament titles, defeating the Detroit Titans in the championship game. Using an intense full-court press, the Panthers scored two upsets in three days over Alabama and Boston College en route to the Sweet Sixteen, where they fell to eventual national runner-up Illinois. The Panthers finished their season 26–6 and were ranked in the coaches poll at the end of the season for the first time ever (#23). Pearl left UWM after the 2005 season, his fourth, as the Horizon League's leader in all-time winning percentage (51–13, 79.7%). Tennessee (2005–2011) =2005–06= On March 28, 2005, Pearl was named as the new head coach at Tennessee, succeeding Buzz Peterson. Tyler Smith had signed with the Vols under Peterson, but decided not to attend Tennessee. Jamont Gordon went to conference rival Mississippi State. Smith opted for a season of prep school before heading to Iowa, though later transferred to Tennessee and became a starter. Pearl stirred up more controversy when he released Matthew Dotson from his scholarship. Expectations were low for the Vols in Pearl's first season. Having lost their two leading scorers from a team that had been just 14–17 the previous season, Tennessee was picked to finish fifth in the six-team Eastern Division of the Southeastern Conference. However, the season started off well, and Tennessee entered the national rankings in December, when it routed then No. 2-ranked Texas, 95–78. The Vols went on to lead the SEC East for virtually the entire season, with other highlights being a win over Kentucky at Rupp Arena and two wins over eventual national champion Florida. But after entering the AP Top 10 in February, the team lost six of its last nine games and dropped to a ranking of 18th. Although Tennessee won the SEC East, it was upset in the second round of both the SEC and NCAA Tournaments, the latter as a no. 2 seed. The team's 22–8 record was one of the best in school history. Following the season, Pearl drew accolades from national recruiting services for signing one of the nation's best recruiting classes, featuring three top-50 recruits in Duke Crews, Wayne Chism and Ramar Smith.Rivals.com Basketball Recruiting – Early enrollee, school switch change team rankings. Rivalshoops.rivals.com. Retrieved on November 17, 2011. =2006–07= On January 22, 2007, Pearl attended a Lady Vols game with his upper body painted orange. He and a few of his players spelled out \\"V-O-L-S\\" (Pearl was the \\"V\\"). Pearl stood in front of the student section and cheered for the Lady Vols as they came out. Pearl's actions brought national media attention to the Tennessee program, and highlighted efforts to support women's collegiate athletics. Lady Vols basketball coach Pat Summitt returned the favor on Senior Night for the men's team on February 27, 2007. Before the game, Summitt came out as a cheerleader, complete with uniform, and she led the crowd in a rendition of Rocky Top. The seventh- largest crowd in school history also witnessed Pearl's squad rout the then No. 4-ranked defending and eventual national champions Florida Gators. Pearl's team went on to finish tied for second in the SEC East with Vanderbilt, earning a No. 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament. The Vols crushed Long Beach State by 35 points in the first round, then rallied to upset Virginia to reach Pearl's second Sweet 16. The Vols were defeated in the next round by the nation's top-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes, losing by a point though the Volunteers led the majority of the game. Tennessee's 24 wins were then ranked third in the program's history. Pearl was rumored as a candidate for the head coaching position at Iowa, but indicated on March 27, 2007, that he was not interested in leaving Tennessee.Report: Bruce Pearl Turns Down Iowa Coaching Job – Sports News Story – KCCI Des Moines .

After a back and forth, emotionally heated contest, Tennessee defeated Memphis 66–62, handing Memphis its first loss of the season and its first home loss in 47 games. The win also cemented UT with a # 1 rank the following week—the first #1 ranking in the school's 100-year basketball history. However, one day after the rankings were posted, the # 1 Vols were upset by the Vanderbilt Commodores 72–69. On March 5, 2008, Pearl's team defeated the Florida Gators 89–86 to claim Tennessee's first outright SEC Regular Season Championship in 41 years. On March 16, 2008 Tennessee was chosen as a #2 seed in the East region of the 2008 NCAA basketball tournament. Pearl's Volunteers advanced to the semifinals (Sweet 16) of the East Regional, beating Pearl's former Horizon League rival and 7-seed Butler in the second round. They ended their season losing to the Louisville Cardinals by a score of 79–60. The 31 total victories that season are the most in school history. =2008–09= December 3, 2008, marked a significant date for Pearl as he was able to win his 400th game by defeating UNC-Asheville. In doing so, Pearl became the 6th-fastest basketball coach to ever reach the 400 mark and 2nd- fastest among active head coaches (behind Roy Williams). The night was also very important for the Tennessee basketball program. It marked the 35th consecutive victory at home for Pearl and the Vols, beating the previous streak of 33 wins which extended from January 2, 1966 to February 24, 1968. In addition, Tyler Smith recorded the school's first ever triple-double when he had 12 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds. In March Pearl would lead the Vols to their first SEC Tournament Final in 20 years, where they would lose in a controversial finish to Mississippi State. The Vols went on to earn a 9 seed in the NCAA tournament where they were eliminated by Oklahoma State 77–75 on March 20, 2009. UT announced that they and Pearl just agreed to a six-year extension for Pearl to stay with the university. =2010–11= On November 17, 2009, Pearl was able to record victory number 100 at Tennessee, the second fastest UT coach to reach the century mark, as his team defeated UNC-Asheville 124–49. The 124-point total was the most ever scored by Tennessee in a regular season game. Tennessee's 34 assists also set a school record and its 16 3-pointers tied another. On January 10, 2010, Tennessee defeated the #1 ranked Kansas Jayhawks in Knoxville, 74–68. This was the first time that Tennessee defeated a #1 ranked team at Thompson–Boling Arena. On February 27, 2010, Tennessee defeated the #2 ranked Kentucky Wildcats in Knoxville, 74–65, cementing the Vols (all 5 years that Pearl has coached) for its 5th straight NCAA tournament appearance. On Bruce Pearl's 50th birthday, March 18, 2010, Tennessee defeated San Diego State in the first round of the NCAA basketball tournament by a score of 62–59. The Vols followed this victory with a second round defeat of Ohio, 83–69, to advance to the Sweet 16 for the third time in four years and Pearl's fourth Sweet 16 in six years. On March 26, 2010, the Tennessee Volunteers advanced to their first Elite 8 in school history with a 76–73 defeat of the Ohio State Buckeyes. On March 28, the Volunteers narrowly missed a trip to the Final Four, losing 70–69 to the Michigan State Spartans in the Midwest Regional Final in St. Louis. Early in the 2010–11 season Tennessee beat nationally ranked Villanova and Pittsburgh, reaching a 7–0 record and #7 AP ranking. However, controversy from an NCAA investigation took its toll on the team. The Vols went only 4–8 in their last 12 games. After limping to an 8–8 conference record, Tennessee was blown out by 30 points in the second round of the 2011 NCAA tournament by Michigan. This was the largest margin of defeat in the history of the NCAA tournament between a #8 and #9 seed. As it turned out, this would be the last game Pearl would coach at Tennessee. =NCAA investigation= In the summer of 2008, Pearl invited high school junior Aaron Craft and members of his family to a cookout at his Knoxville home while Craft was on an unofficial visit to Tennessee. At the cookout, Pearl said that Craft wasn't allowed to be there under NCAA rules, but encouraged all those in attendance not to tell anyone about it. When the NCAA began an investigation of the affair, Pearl not only lied about the cookout, but also told Craft's father to lie as well. On September 10, 2010, Pearl acknowledged the violations in the Craft affair, and also admitted lying about it to the NCAA. As a result, Tennessee imposed sanctions on Pearl and his entire staff including $1.5 million in salary reduction over the coming five years and a delayed retention bonus. His off-campus recruiting was also restricted completely from September 4, 2010 to September 23, 2011.Transcript of Friday's press conference on the NCAA investigation of the men's basketball program. GoVolsXtra. Retrieved on November 17, 2011. On November 20, 2010, the SEC ordered Pearl to sit out Tennessee's first eight SEC games.

Bleacher Report. On August 23, 2011, Pearl was given a three-year show-cause penalty for lying to the NCAA, effective until August 23, 2014. This meant that the sanctions imposed on Pearl would remain in force if he was hired by an NCAA member school within that period. Specifically, he was prohibited from engaging in any \\"recruiting activities\\", which meant he could not contact recruits, although he could evaluate talent during that period. If a school chose to hire him and challenged the NCAA restrictions, it had to appear before the NCAA Committee on Infractions and \\"show cause\\" for why the sanctions imposed on Pearl should not follow him to that school. In imposing the penalty, the NCAA said that Pearl's lies turned what would have been a minor case into a major one.O'Neil, Dana. In the end, the right people were punished. ESPN, August 24, 2011.

Auburn (2014–present) Pearl was named Auburn's head basketball coach on March 18, 2014, replacing Tony Barbee. At the time he was hired, he still had five months remaining on his show-cause order for violations at Tennessee. As a result, he could not have contact with recruits during the summer recruiting period, but could evaluate them. Pearl was greeted by 100-plus fans when he arrived at the Auburn University Regional Airport that afternoon. Pearl was formally introduced as Auburn's 20th head basketball coach at a press conference in Auburn Arena that evening. On the opportunity, Pearl said, \\"I’m humbled and blessed to be back in the game that I love.

Pearl won his first game as Auburn's head coach on November 14, 2014 against his former school, Milwaukee, 83–73. Despite failing to finish with a winning record for the first time in his career as a head coach, Pearl's first two seasons at Auburn were not without some significant wins. He led Auburn to the SEC Tournament semifinals in 2015 as a 13 seed, and ended Auburn's 18-game losing streak to Kentucky in 2016. He earned his 500th career win as a head coach on January 18, 2017 after defeating LSU, 78–74. Before Pearl's fourth season at Auburn, his associate head coach Chuck Person was arrested on charges of corruption and bribery. Auburn elected to hold sophomores Austin Wiley and Danjel Purifoy out of games due to eligibility concerns raised over the FBI investigation. Pearl was cited as being uncooperative with Auburn's internal investigation of the program at first, though school president Steven Leath and Pearl have since come to an understanding of expectations for the investigation. Despite the scrutiny both internally and externally and losing two players due to the investigation, Pearl led the 2017–18 team to its best record since 1999 while winning the SEC regular season championship. A player, Bryce Brown, credits the recent team success to Pearl's taking them to Italy to build team 'chemistry', opponent preparation by Pearl, and the head coaches' strong belief in each player.Katz, Andy.

Almonester arrived to Louisiana in 1769, during its early days of Spanish rule, appointed escribano publico or notary public, which Grace King described as \\"an office rich in salary, perquisites, and business opportunities. He soon acquired wealth in it, or through it.\\" Among his investments was a large tract of land downtown, purchased from Governor O'Reilly on perpetual lease. Almonester became an alcalde or city councilman for Louisiana (New Spain)'s governing authority, the Cabildo, and afterwards bought the office of Alferez Real or royal standard bearer. He was made Knight of the Royal and Distinguished Spanish Order of Carlos III in 1796. His nearest allies appear to have been Governor Esteban Rodríguez Miró, Père Antoine (Antonio de Sedella), and the de La Ronde family, to which he later joined through marriage. Marriage Approaching his 60th birthday, Almonester wed Marie-Louise Denis de La Ronde (1758 - 1825), a renowned Creole beauty, fully half his age, in the parish church, Iglesia San Luis, in 1787 -- the year before it was destroyed by fire. In the author's introduction to their daughter's Pulitzer Prize-nominated biography, Intimate Enemies, Christina Vella describes Louise as \\"a poor French Creole, famed for marrying her father,\\" yet while noting the status quo in Chapter One: \\"The French and Spanish oligarchs of the colony... dividing the lucrative offices among themselves and circulating their wealth within careful limits by intermarriage.\\" Family fortunes declined with the death of her father, Hardly a pauper; Louise, in fact, was the eldest child of an ennobled family of no little import whose marriage had been arranged to formalize alliances between Don Almonester and an aristocratic family transitioning from France to Nouvelle-France to French Louisiana, and then to Spanish Louisiana. Louise was the well-connected eldest child of French-Canadian Naval Officer Pierre Denys de La Ronde (1726-1772), who had been re-assigned from Nouvelle-France to Nouvelle-Orleans by his godfather, future French Louisiana Governor, Pierre de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial, and was distinguished in the French and Indian Wars. Through her father, Louise was the great-granddaughter of Judge and celebrated French poet René-Louis Chartier de Lotbinière of Maison Lotbinière; great-great niece of Simon-Pierre Denys de Bonaventure; and a great-niece, through his wife, Charlotte Denys de La Ronde, of Claude de Ramezay, Governor of Trois-Rivières, then of Montreal. Louise's only brother, Pierre Denis de La Ronde (1762 - 1824), was, like his predecessor, enabled to wealth when he succeeded Almonester on the Cabildo, becoming the wealthiest of Louisiana plantation owners. He would later distinguish himself in the Battle of New Orleans, and is now remembered for his since misnamed Versailles, Louisiana plantation's legacy: a magnificent allée of Southern live oaks, still leading from the Mississippi River to the ruins of his former mansion.The Regional Review, Volume II - No. 5: \\"Historic Sites in the South\\", by Roy Edgar Appleman, Regional Supervisor of Historic Sites; Richmond, Virginia; USA; May, 1939. Through her mother, Louise was also the granddaughter of a powerful military officer best remembered for his years as Louisiana's esteemed royal architect and engineer, Ignace François Broutin. Louise's mother's sister, the similarly named Marie-Marguerite Madeleine Broutin, had, most unfortunately, married, in 1754, the Baron Jean-Joseph François Delfau de Pontalba; their son, Joseph-Xavier Delfau de Pontalba would later solicit the Denys family to join his only son, Célestin, in marriage to Louise and Almonester's only daughter, the future Micaela Almonester, Baroness de Pontalba. The unstable Baron would exert himself tormenting young Micaela for her fortune. Decades of misery later- despite many efforts made to separate her from his control -in the wake of her protective mother's demise, he finally attempted to murder Micaela, but succeeded only in taking his own misspent life and thus, with the tragic twist of irony, transferring the title Baroness to the indomitable daughter-in-law whose riches he had so diligently sought for his own. The murderous Baron Pontalba was wed to Louise Marie-Anne Françoise Le Breton des Chapelles, first cousin of the notorious Marie- Delphine de Macarty, better known today as Delphine LaLaurie. Following the death of Don Almonester, his widow, Louise, became well known as \\"a superbly competent businesswoman who had greatly increased the inheritance since Almonester's death.\\" New York Times: \\"A Spectacular Mess of a Marriage\\", by ANGELINE GOREAU; August 31, 1997.

Legacy After the Great New Orleans Fire (1788), Don Almonester funded a public school for the city, as well as a house for the use of the clergy and the charity hospital at the then-considerable cost of $114,000. He rebuilt the buildings on either side of the cathedral, the hospital, the boys' school, a chapel for the Ursulines; and he founded the leper hospital. Almonester funded the building of New Orleans' parish church, in which he is buried. The Church of Saint Louis was dedicated in 1794, becoming a cathedral the following year, and was never pulled down as some sources may say. In 1849 the cathedral was badly damaged due to the removal of supports which led to the collapse of the center tower. This led to the 1850s remodeled structure as we know it today. Don Andres' remains still lie in the cathedral, entombed in the floor with one of his two daughters, four-year-old Andrea.Biographical sketch on a website in Mairena del Alcor, Spain, in Spanish New Orleans' Almonaster Avenue is named in his honor, posthumously editing the spelling of his surname from Almonester to Almonaster.

As of 2015, there were only 7 of these huskies left on their native Sakhalin island. In 2011, there were only two surviving purebred members of the breed in Japan. The sole remaining breeder on Sakhalin, Sergey Lyubykh, located in the Nivkh village of Nekrasovka, died in 2012, but before his death stated that there were no longer enough living specimens of the breed to allow for the genetic diversity necessary for continued breeding. History Karafuto Ken breaks down as Karafuto, the Japanese name for Sakhalin and Ken, a Japanese word for dog; hence, this provides the breed's geographical origin. This breed is rarely used now; therefore, few breeders remain in Japan. Explorers who went to Franz Josef Land, conquerors of northern Alaska, and South Pole explorers (including Robert Falcon Scott) used these dogs. They were utilized by the Red Army during World War II as pack animals; but that affair was short-lived after research proved that they were prodigious eaters of salmon, and not worth keeping. Offshoots of the Sakhalin Husky are theorized to be the progenitors of longer-coated Akitas. Antarctic expedition This breed's claim to fame came from the ill-fated 1958 Japanese research expedition to Antarctica, which made an emergency evacuation, leaving behind 15 sled dogs. The researchers believed that a relief team would arrive within a few days, so they left the dogs chained up outside with a small supply of food; however, the weather turned bad and the team never made it to the outpost. Incredibly, nearly one year later, a new expedition arrived and discovered that two of the dogs, Taro and Jiro, had survived and they became instant heroes. Taro returned to Sapporo, Japan and lived at Hokkaido University until his death in 1970, after which he was stuffed and put on display at the university's museum. Jiro died in Antarctica in 1960 of natural causes and his remains are located at the National Science Museum of Japan in Ueno Park. The breed spiked in popularity upon the release of the 1983 film Nankyoku Monogatari, about Taro and Jiro. A second film from 2006, Eight Below, provided a fictional version of the occurrence, but did not reference the breed. Instead, the film features only eight dogs: two Alaskan Malamutes named Buck and Shadow and six Siberian Huskies named Max, Old Jack, Maya, Dewey, Truman, and Shorty. In 2011, TBS presented the much-awaited drama, Nankyoku Tairiku, featuring Kimura Takuya. It tells the story of the 1957 Antarctica Expedition led by Japan and their Sakhalin Huskies. The breed and the expedition are memorialized by three monuments: near Wakkanai, Hokkaido; under Tokyo Tower; and near Nagoya Port. Sculptor Takeshi Ando designed the Tokyo statues (he also designed the replacement Hachikō statute in front of JR Shibuya Station), which were removed, likely to be placed at Tokyo's National Institute of Polar Research. The Sakhalin Huskies of the 1957-1958 Japanese expedition Few sources provide the names of the 15 Japanese sled dogs that were stranded, as well as the photos and descriptions of the Huskies.

A lifelong communist, Gold was a novelist and literary critic. His semi-autobiographical novel Jews Without Money (1930) was a bestseller. During the 1930s and 1940s Gold was considered the preeminent author and editor of U.S. proletarian literature.  Background  Gold was born Itzok Isaac Granich on April 12, 1894,The book Jews Without Money indicates that Gold was born in 1894. on the Lower East Side of New York City to Romanian Jewish immigrant parents, Chaim Granich and Gittel Schwartz Granich.Sanford Sternlicht, The Tenement Saga: The Lower East Side and Early Jewish American Writers, Terrace Books, 2004, p. 111. He had two brothers, Max and George. Career Mike Gold published his first writings under the name Irwin Granich. He reportedly took the pseudonym Michael Gold at the time of the Palmer Raids on radicals in 1919-20 from a Jewish Civil War veteran whom he admired for having fought to \\"free the slaves.\\"Barry Gross, \\"Michael Gold (1893-1967)\\", The Heath Anthology of American Literature, ed.

The Masses, a socialist journal edited by Floyd Dell and Max Eastman, published his first pieces in August, 1914. \\"Three Whose Hatred Killed Them\\" is a poem about anarchists killed in a Lexington Avenue tenement by their own bomb. Gold praised their \\"pure intentions\\". Until his death he was an ardent supporter of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and of the Soviet Union in all its phases. In 1921-22 Gold and Claude McKay became Executive Editors of Max Eastman's magazine The Liberator. In 1922, Gold wrote: \\"The Russian Bolsheviks will leave the world a better place than Jesus left it. They will leave it on the threshold of the final victory—the poor will have bread and peace and culture in another generation, not churches and a swarm of lying parasite minister dogs, the legacy of Jesus.\\"Mike Gold, \\"The Jesus-Thinkers\\", The Liberator, vol. 5, no. 9, September 1922, p. 12. pdf copy In 1925 Gold visited Moscow. In 1926 he was a founding editor of The New Masses, which published leftist works and also set up radical theater groups. Gold served as editor-in-chief from June 1928A.B. Magil, \\"Rebirth of New Masses,\\" Daily Worker, June 2, 1928, pg. ?? until 1934. At both The Liberator and The New Masses, he favored publishing letters, poems and fiction by ordinary workers over works by literary leftists of bourgeois backgrounds. One of the widely noted articles he wrote for The New Masses was \\"Gertrude Stein: A Literary Idiot\\". Here he charged that her works \\"resemble the monotonous gibberings of paranoiacs in the private wards of asylums ... The literary idiocy of Gertrude Stein only reflects the madness of the whole system of capitalist values. It is part of the signs of doom that are written largely everywhere on the walls of bourgeois society.\\" In \\"Proletarian Realism\\" (1930), Gold said of Marcel Proust: \\"The worst example and the best of what we do not want to do is the spectacle of Proust, master- masturbator of the bourgeois literature.\\"Mike Gold: A Literary Anthology, ed. Michael Folsom, New York: International Publishers, 1972, p. 206. He also assailed the Pulitzer Prize winner Thornton Wilder in equally vitriolic terms. Throughout the 1920s Gold worked on his only novel, Jews Without Money, a fictionalized autobiography about growing up in the impoverished world of the Lower East Side. Published in 1930, shortly after the onset of the Great Depression, it was an immediate success and went through many print-runs in its first years and was translated into over 14 languages. It became a prototype for the American proletarian novel. In his Author's Note to the novel, Gold wrote, \\"I have told in my book a tale of Jewish poverty in one ghetto, that of New York. The same story can be of a hundred other ghettoes scattered over all the world. For centuries the Jew has lived in this universal ghetto.\\"Michael Gold. Jews Without Money. Carrol and Greph Publishers, Inc., N.Y., 1996. , p. 10. The popularity of Jews Without Money made Gold a national figure and cultural commissar of the Communist Party. He was a daily columnist for its paper, the Daily Worker, until his death. Gold himself was fond of repeating a quote from the novel: \\"O workers' Revolution!... You are the true Messiah!\\"Quoted by Barbara Foley, Radical Representations: Politics and Form in U.S. Proletarian Fiction, 1929-1941, Duke University Press, 1993, p. 312. As a critic, Gold fiercely denounced left-wing authors who he believed had deviated from the Communist Party line.Kenneth Lloyd Billingsly (1998). Hollywood Party: How Communism Seduced the American Film Industry in the 1930s and 1940s. Rocklin, CA: Prima Publishing/Forum Among those Gold denounced were screenwriter Albert Maltz and \\"renegade\\" Ernest Hemingway, who while never a Communist had been sympathetic to leftist causes but came under fire by some for his writing on the Spanish Civil War in For Whom the Bell Tolls. Hemingway responded with \\"Go tell Mike Gold, Ernest Hemingway says he should go fuck himself.\\" Carlos Baker, Ernest Hemingway: A Life, New York, Scribners, 1969, p. 459. Personal life and death Gold was once romantically involved with Dorothy Day. Gold died in Terra Linda, California, on May 14, 1967, from complications following a stroke.

The name Graffias is another name for the star Beta Scorpii in the constellation Scorpius. The Graffias was originally laid down in 1943 as Topa Topa, a Maritime Commission type (C2-S-E1) hull under Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1610) at the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation, Chickasaw, Alabama. The ship was acquired by the United States Navy on 19 February 1944 and subsequently converted by the Bethlehem Steel Company, Baltimore, Maryland. The Graffias was commissioned at Baltimore on 28 October 1944, with Lieutenant Commander B. P. Caraher in command. Initial operations After a brief shakedown along the East Coast, Graffias sailed for the Pacific on 25 November as a unit of ServRon Ten. Reaching Ulithi on 31 December, she discharged her valuable cargo of provisions and returned to San Francisco, California, a month later. Laden with foodstuffs and provisions for the staging areas and the front, Graffias made two more San Francisco-Ulithi voyages through May 1945. The refrigerator-cargo ship returned to Pearl Harbor on 31 May and from there sailed again to Ulithi with provisions, returning to Hawaii on 14 July. After repairs at Pearl Harbor, Graffias sailed to Adak, Alaska, reaching port on 18 August. With the Japanese capitulation, she began a new task: bringing desperately needed provisions to the starving island and to American occupation forces. Graffias reached Ominato, Honshū, on 9 September, and after replenishing American bases at Wakayama, Nagasaki, and Sasebo, sailed for the United States with home and discharge-bound passengers. Putting in at Seattle on 26 October, she disembarked her passengers and checked into Bremerton Navy Yard for overhaul. By January 1946, Graffias was well embarked on the routine which she was to follow until the Korean War, replenishing scattered American bases across the Pacific. Taking on cargo at Seattle or San Francisco, she would discharge provisions at such far-flung points as Wake Island, Eniwetok, Kwajalein, Bikini, Okinawa, the Philippines, Guam, Saipan, Formosa, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Yokosuka. These Pacific replenishment cruises, whose duration was 2½ months on the average, were supplemented by periodic overhauls and participation in various fleet exercises. Korean War When war broke out in Korea in June 1950, Graffias sailed to Sasebo, Japan, her new home port, to begin the vital task of provisioning United States and United Nations ships and troops. For three years she shuttled between Sasebo and various at sea replenishment areas to effect cargo transfer, as well as making frequent stops along the Korean coast. As the conflict ended with an armistice in August 1953, Graffias remained on duty with the 7th Fleet to continue her task of replenishing ships and troops. Replenishment cruises took her across the ocean to Hong Kong and Formosa as well as Okinawa and the Philippines. During the intensification of the Quemoy-Matsu situation in the summer of 1955, and thereafter, Graffias made frequent stops at Formosa to provision American and Chinese Nationalist forces as well as an enlarged 7th Fleet. In the decade that followed, Graffias operated almost continuously out of Sasebo supplying American naval ships in Far Eastern ports especially, in the Philippines, Formosa, Hong Kong and Vietnam. She departed Sasebo on 26 February 1964 for her new home port of San Francisco. Vietnam War Following a thorough overhaul, she headed westward again on 27 June and reached Yokosuka on 13 July. On the last day of July, she sailed for Subic Bay after the Gulf of Tonkin incident. Following the Gulf of Tonkin on 4 August, Graffias was ordered to the area to provide logistic support. A week later, she replenished the two destroyers and subsequently supplied many other ships of the 7th Fleet. After setting a replenishment record during the deployment by transferring supplies at an average rate of 168.9 short tons per hour, Graffias steamed home via Hong Kong, Yokosuka, and Pearl Harbor, arriving in San Francisco on 12 October. Following two deployments to the Far East in 1965, supporting the Allied forces in Vietnam, Graffias operated along the Pacific Coast in 1966 until sailing for the western Pacific on 10 December. On the last day of 1966 she departed Yokosuka to resume underway replenishment operations supplying ships of the 7th Fleet fighting off Vietnam in 1967. Graffias returned to her homeport in April 1967 after a port call in Hawaii where one of her boilers was repaired. She sailed again in August 1967 to the western Pacific and the waters off the coast of Vietnam, under the command of Captain Thomas B. Hayward. Captain Hayward departed Graffias in June 1968 for duty in Washington, D.C.. The ship returned to its home port for Christmas on 23 December 1967, the ship's first Christmas in the United States since 1949. Graffias again set sail in late July 1968 to support the war effort off the coast of Vietnam, returning to San Francisco in November 1968. Graffias was decommissioned in 1969. Graffias earned eight battle stars for Korean War service and seven campaign stars for Vietnam War service.

Synopsis Maerth asserted that the eating of brain produces an aphrodisiac effect (presumably due to the vast amount of hormones in it), and that this initially caused apes to become addicted to them, organizing brain hunts wherein the males of another tribe were eaten and the females raped in a frenzy of brain-induced sex and violence.Maerth (1974), page 37 However, this diet also inadvertently increased brain size and intelligenceMaerth (1974), page 39 while triggering the loss both of body hairMaerth (1974), page 90 and of our innate psychic abilities.Maerth (1974), page 99 Thus the human gradually came into being, remaining cannibalistic until 50,000 years ago.Maerth (1974), page 54 Modern humans, alienated from their surroundings now that they've no telepathic contact with nature and each other as animals do,Maerth (1974), page 106–107 suffering from a distorted sexuality resulting from hormonal imbalances,Maerth (1974), page 63–64 and driven insane from the constant pressure of their unnaturally large brains pressing on the inside of their skulls,Maerth (1974), page 53: are inevitably destroying themselves with pollution, overpopulation,Maerth (1974), page 230–231 racial integrationMaerth (1974), page 192–200 and ultimately, nuclear war. He foresees a return to cannibalism in the near future,Maerth (1974), page 199: and suggests that the readers should drop out of society,Maerth (1974), pages 235–236 embrace a vegetarian diet, steep themselves in the wisdom of the EastMaerth (1974), page 84, also 234 and perhaps employ various wooden frames and wire devices to alter the shape of their skulls as some ancient cultures did, thus relieving the pressure on the brain and partially restoring psychic powers.Maerth (1974), page 128, also see the comments on page 148: Criticism The book contains no references whatsoever, based alternately on alleged conversations with present-day cannibals,Maerth (1974), page 47 the eating of ape brain by the authorMaerth (1974), pages 52–53: and direct insight from deep meditation. Many parts have been deemed by some as being outright racist, particularly the photographic plates comparing various ethnic faces (primarily Arab and African) to apes.Maerth (1974), 8-page photo supplement between pages 168–169 He says that blacks have smaller brains than whitesMaerth (1974), page 180 and that contemporary cannibal tribes are seeking to remedy this discrepancy by consuming brains in a frantic attempt to catch up, though he estimates that it would take them roughly 100,000 years to do so.Maerth (1974), page 68: Influences The book's legacy comes largely from the new wave band Devo, who incorporated several elements of the book into their concept of \\"de- evolution\\" and even adopted the book's title for their short film, In the Beginning was the End: The Truth About De-evolution. Bassist/synth player/vocalist Gerald V. Casale said of the book, \\"It's a better story than the Bible as far as DEVO's concerned.\\"Acid Logic Interview with Gerald V. Casale The cover of the 1989 album Now It Can Be Told is based on the cover of the US paperback edition. In the early 2000s, Devo attempted to have the book reprinted with an introduction by them. This met with no success, due to copyright issues. The book is now quite collectable.

It is about 120 km northeast of Adelaide, South Australia, about 23 km north of Kapunda. Once a stop for the mining carts going from Adelaide to Burra, but now just a small agricultural district. Hamilton was the birthplace of Albert Percy Blesing in 1879, MP for Northern from 1924–1944. He served as Minister for Agriculture, Local Government and Afforestation in the government of Thomas Playford IV. This now shrinking town used to be a very vibrant one with its own football, netball and cricket teams all of which now are non-existent. The Hamilton tennis club is still running and plays in the Julia & Light Tennis Association. The park at Hamilton is called Gill Park and is named after the Gill family which was prominent in the district. The Hamilton school opened in 1860 by the local residents. The school contributed to the development of the township, as it provided local access to primary education. The nearest town, Kapunda, was too far to travel daily to school with 19th century transport. The Hamilton school closed in 1948 and the remaining students and teacher transferred to Kapunda Primary. The Dutton Memorial Church of St Matthew was built in 1896 (replacing a more modest building of 1857) and financed by one man, Henry Dutton (1844–1914) of nearby Anlaby Station as a memorial to his brother Frederick, and to Henry's wife Helen and their daughter Ethel, who died accidentally on Granite Island. Henry Dutton was occasional lay reader and, an accomplished musician, played the organ, a magnificent instrument for such a small town. The church is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. The historic Anlaby Station complex is located within the modern boundaries of Hamilton.

Produced by Remington Arms in Huntsville, Alabama formerly in Mayfield, Kentucky, formerly by Marlin Firearms Company of North Haven, Connecticut, it has been in continuous production since 1960 and the company says it is the most popular rifle of its kind in the world.Marlin Model 60 Sales Page Major features include a micro- groove barrel, a cross-bolt safety, hardwood stock with Monte Carlo comb, and brass or blued steel inner magazine tube. The Marlin Model 795 is a very similar rifle and based on the Marlin Model 60, changed only to accept a detachable box magazine. History The Marlin Model 99 was developed in 1959 by Ewald Nichol. Internally, it was essentially what would become the Model 60 in 1960. However, major differences were visible from the exterior. The Model 99 featured a walnut stock, and the receiver, instead of being grooved for tip-off scope mounts like the Model 60 would be, was factory-tapped to accept screw-on scope mounts. The Model 99 was offered from 1959 through 1961, and a lower priced version, Model 99G, was offered under Marlin's Glenfield line. The Marlin Model 60 was developed in 1960 from the Model 99 design. The primary difference was that the stock was made of birch instead of walnut to reduce the recurring production costs for the more expensive wood. Marlin also moved away from their practice of using steel inner tubes with their tubular magazine. They moved back to brass inner tubes as other companies had done. This, instead of the steel tubes often seen on earlier Marlin .22 rifles, completely eliminated the rust problems that the all-steel tubular magazines had experienced which helped make the inexpensive Marlin rifle as durable as more expensive .22 caliber rifles. The Model 60 additionally featured a 16-groove rifled barrel, utilizing Marlin's trademarked Micro-Groove rifling technology, which had been developed in 1953. This rifling, with its precision-crowned muzzle, gave the Model 60 an inherent, enhanced accuracy over competing rifles, which used traditional deep grooved rifling, because the bullet was not as severely deformed while traveling down the barrel, and downrange. The Model 60 has a manual \\"fully open\\" bolt hold position, activated by pushing the charging handle inwards towards the gun when it is in the fully retracted, open breech position. To close the bolt with the manual bolt hold-open engaged, the charging handle must be pulled out, away from the gun, before the bolt will go forward. Since 1985, the Model 60 has also included a patented automatic \\"last-shot\\" bolt hold-open. This latter feature is a safety feature that locks the bolt half-way open after the last cartridge is fired, thereby allowing the safe inspection of the now-open action. This also notifies the user when the gun is empty.Marlin Model 60 with after-market stock. During the late-1980s, the capacity of the rifle was reduced to a 15-round maximum limit, to meet New Jersey's firearms law for semi-automatic assault weapons. For a few years in the mid-1980s the Model 60 rifles had both the \\"last shot hold open\\" feature and also held 18 rounds in the tube magazine. Those rifles with those two features are among the most sought after Model 60s. The redesigned magazine tube was visibly shorter than the barrel, which is how rifles from this period can be easily identified. Then, in the early 2000s the length of the barrel was reduced from 22 to 19 inches (559 to 483 mm), to match the length of the reduced length magazine. This had the effect of reducing the length of the rifle from 40.5 to 37.5 inches (1029 to 953 mm). (The photo above is of the 40.5 inch (1029 mm) version, the rifle having been manufactured in 1982.) Non-removable tubular magazine-fed rifles were never subject to the 10 round limit of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. Marlin also manufactured models for export, which had various capacities to comply with foreign firearms regulations. Despite slight design changes since 1960, there is general backwards compatibility of nearly all internal parts. Some notable parts that are year-specific are the feed throat mechanisms, magazine tubes, firing pins, and hammers. Features Two Marlin Model 60s. Top: older 18-round model. Bottom: 15-round model with aftermarket scope (and magazine tube that is visibly shorter than the barrel). Note: the bolt stays open on the 15-round model after the last round is fired, but does not on the 18-round model. The 15 round model has a third screw slightly behind the trigger guard to reinforce the stock, which the old model lacks. There are a few 1985 models that were a mixture of both, 22\\" barrel, 18 round capacity, last round bolt hold open feature and the third reinforcing screw. Different wood is used for the stock itself.The action design is a self-loading, straight blowback operation, with right-side ejection. The receiver top has a serrated, non-glare finish. The receiver is held in the stock by front and rear machine screws through forearm and the trigger guard respectively (later models add a wood screw behind the trigger guard to reinforce the wrist of the stock). The receiver is grooved for a scope mount. For use without a scope, the barrel features an adjustable open rear light and a ramp front sight. The charging handle is used to load the first round from the magazine and can be retracted and pushed in as a manual bolt hold-open feature. Current model has an automatic \\"last-shot\\" bolt hold-open device with an external lever in the front of the trigger guard to release the bolt. Earliest Model 60s did not have a bolt hold-open; first the manual, then in the mid-1980s the automatic \\"last shot\\" hold-open were added. The rifle has an easily accessible cross- bolt safety located above the trigger. When disassembled, the trigger guard with trigger and safety remains in the stock. Marlin uses their proprietary Micro-Groove rifling in the Model 60. The twist rate is 1:16 inches, right- hand. Micro-Groove rifling uses 16 small lands and grooves rather than 4, 6 or 8 deeper grooves used in most rifles. This increases the accuracy of the rifle by lessening deformation of fired bullets traveling down the barrel. Although the Model 60 is one of the least expensive .22 semi-automatic rifles sold, it has the reputation of being one of the most accurate rifles out of the box, with no modifications necessary. Unlike some competing .22 semi-automatic rifles, such as the Ruger 10/22, there are relatively few aftermarket accessories sold for the utilitarian Model 60. The Model 60 has been sold in over thirty-five variants, and is one of the fastest-selling sporting rifles ever, as of 1983.Wallack, LR. \\"Sixty Million Guns\\". 1983. In Gun Digest Treasury, Harold A. Murtz, editor, DBI Books. 1994 p.195 While earlier .22 semi-automatic rifles were often designed to function with .22 Short, .22 Long and .22 Long Rifle interchangeably, the Model 60 is optimized for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge only. Uses The Model 60 is well-suited for small-game hunting and vermin control, as well as for serious but low-cost target practice while preparing for hunting with larger rifles. The relatively large ammunition capacity is adequate for casual recreational target shooting (\\"plinking\\"), plus the low price and ease of handling makes it well-suited as a first rifle by young hunters just learning to use a semi-automatic rifle. Versions and year of manufacture The Model 60 is currently available in nine distinct versions: The production of Marlin Model 60's was moved to Huntsville, Alabama. This move took place in 2016 and 2017.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 17, 2005. The episode, directed by Chuck Martin, was written by producer Jim Vallely and series creator and executive producer Mitchell Hurwitz. An extended version of the episode was released as a special feature on the DVD home release. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. At the 57th Primetime Emmy Awards, Mitchell Hurwitz and Jim Vallely received the Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series award for this episode. Plot Having been told that the house is sinking and that an inspector is on the way, Michael tells George Sr. that he needs to move out of the attic. Having made a music CD with his puppet Franklin, Gob asks Michael if he heard it. Michael assures Gob that he did. Realizing that George Sr. doesn't want to leave the attic, Gob knocks him out with ether, and drives him in the stair car to the police station to turn him in. Seeing that the Franklin CD he made for Michael hasn't been opened, Gob makes it seem as if Michael drove George Sr. to the station. After signing an affidavit stating that he doesn't know where his father is, Michael is arrested after a security camera photo shows Gob holding a picture a Michael on his face, making it seem as if Michael had met with his father earlier in the day. Meanwhile, George Michael and Ann protest the American remake of the film Les Cousins Dangereux, in which two cousins fall in love. Maeby, who created the remake, is told by producers to cut down the movie into a mere 52 minutes. At home, George Michael and Maeby share a kiss on the living room couch, and after jokily saying that they \\"didn't get swallowed up into hell,\\" the house fully sinks. Gob arrives, wanting to retrieve his father who he put underground the house, only to realize George Sr. had escaped earlier in the day. Earlier, George Sr., having escaped, knocked out his brother Oscar, shaved his head, and placed him in the police station's bathroom. He then witnessed Gob arriving outside the police station and starting a fight with Michael. George Sr., stopping the fight, stated that he was turning himself in, only to lead the cops into the bathroom where Oscar was located, which resulted in Oscar being arrested. On the next Arrested Development... Having burnt his hands on the family Cornballer, which erased his fingerprints, Oscar has trouble explaining to the cops who he really is. Having broken up with Lindsay, Tobias decides to quit his job at the Bluth Company and move to Las Vegas with his new girlfriend Kitty. Having arrived at Las Vegas, Tobias is told that his dream job has been filled in by a mysterious man, who happens to be George Sr. Reception Critical reception The A.V. Club writer Noel Murray wrote that the season finale didn't feel much like a finale, saying that \\"there’s a fumbling-for-an-ending aspect to “Righteous Brothers” that keeps it from being one of the classic Arrested Developments. Chalk it up to the reduced episode order, which makes this finale feel like a big finish and just an ordinary episode, all at once.\\" In 2019, Brian Tallerico, writing for Vulture, ranked the episode 42nd out of the 84 total episodes of Arrested Development.

Terms The conditions of the treaty were as follows: # Jayadhwaj Singha was to send a daughter to the Imperial harem.The princess was six-year-old Romoni (Nangsen) Gabhoru, daughter of Jayadhwaj Singha and Pakhori Gabhoru.

They take place beginning several months after the Jedi Academy trilogy, or eight years after Return of the Jedi. The first book, Children of the Jedi (1995), was written by American writer Barbara Hambly. The second book is Darksaber (1995) by Kevin J. Anderson. Hambly also wrote the final novel in the cycle, Planet of Twilight (1997). After the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by Disney, the books were rebranded as Star Wars Legends. Summary Children of the Jedi Han Solo and Princess Leia learn of the now-abandoned Jedi stronghold on the planet of Belsavis from Drub McKumb and travel there, only to discover a political conspiracy involving a Force-adept, members of the Ancient Houses and the Emperor's Hand who is able to change the programming of droids and mechanicals. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker, C-3PO, two Jedi students (Nichos and Cray), and a myriad selection of alien life-forms along with a former stormtrooper are abducted aboard the sinister Eye of Palpatine, impossibly reactivated after thirty years. Fighting the effects of massive indoctrination, injury, and the cold manipulation by the ship's artificial intelligence and its horrific security measures, Luke discovers the Eye is bound for the destruction of Belsavis. Racing against time and exhaustion he struggles to rescue his companions; who are being held hostage as the Will has decided they are Rebel Saboteurs, find a way to transport all the ship's prisoners back to their home worlds, and find a way to destroy the super-weapon. He makes an unexpected ally in the form of Callista Ming, the brave Jedi who sacrificed her life to stop the ship thirty years before, and now exists as a fading spirit in the gunnery computers. Tenderness grows between them, but time is running out, and the destruction of the Eye will mean the final loss of Callista forever. Beyond all hope, Callista is revived as a human when Cray chooses to die and be reunited with her dead lover Nichos and offers her body to the former Jedi. But everything has to be paid for, Callista loses her Jedi powers. Their love and trials continue in Darksaber and The Planet of Twilight. Darksaber While searching Jabba the Hutt's palace on Tatooine, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo learn that the Hutts are planning to build another superweapon. Meanwhile, in the Hoth Asteroid Belt, Durga the Hutt is planning a diplomatic mission to Coruscant, where he will secretly obtain the plans for the Death Star superlaser for Bevel Lemelisk, the Death Star's designer. Skywalker and Solo reveal their discoveries, but not before Durga's subordinates steal the plans from the Imperial Palace. In order to find out the location of the superweapon, the New Republic launches a covert operation to Nal Hutta, disguised as a diplomatic summit. Back at the Hoth asteroid belt, Lemelisk starts construction on the cylindrical superlaser, which he calls the \\"Darksaber\\" for its shape is similar to the hilt of a lightsaber. Luke and Callista embark on a vacation that eventually leaves them stranded near the Hoth asteroid belt. They are rescued by Han and Leia, who just returned from the successful mission on Nal Hutta. However, Luke and Callista's rescue is mainly thanks to the Republic fleet, who arrived to launch Crix Madine and his squad to locate the Darksaber reported to be under construction in the region. While Madine succeeds in relaying the location to the fleet, he is captured and killed by Durga. However, Durga's triumph is short-lived when the Republic fleet spots the Darksaber and begins pursuit. The Darksaber attempts to fire its superlaser and make an escape, but the weapon fails and the ship is destroyed by two large asteroids. Meanwhile, Admiral Daala succeeds in uniting the remains of the Empire in the core systems. With the help of Pellaeon, she plans a strike force against a series of New Republic targets, including the Jedi academy on Yavin 4. They also attack Khomm, where Jedi trainees Kyp Durron and Dorsk 81 are visiting. Furious, the pair of Jedi spy on Daala's fleet and succeed in warning the academy of the attack. Using the powers of the Force, the Jedi trainees back at Yavin 4 manage to hold off Daala's forces until New Republic reinforcements arrive. Daala is forced to retreat when her Super Star Destroyer, the Knight Hammer, is destroyed. After the failed attack, Daala transfers control over the Imperial forces to Pellaeon. Meanwhile, Callista decides to temporarily leave Luke and venture on a journey to regain her powers. Luke is heartbroken, but decides to move on and continue to build the Jedi academy. Planet of Twilight The story takes place about a year after the previous book on Nam Chorios, a backwater world in the Outer Rim which infamously was the center of the Death Seed Plague centuries ago. It is now home to a fanatic religious cult which is plotting to use a new weapon system of quasi-intelligent crystals as unstoppable, unmanned starfighters to attack the New Republic. Leia unofficially goes on a trip to meet with Seti Ashgad, the leader of the Rationalist Party. Luke Skywalker is there after receiving a message from Callista. Luke's ship is shot down and Leia is kidnapped by the ancient and corrupt Beldorion the Hutt. After a series of adventures the two escape and end the political conspiracy between the Rationalists and the New Republic.

He played running back, safety, and place kicker (on kickoffs) as a three-year letterman for Belton High School in Belton, Texas and broke five records. Football career Sanders was a three-sport star at Belton High School. He made all-region in basketball, placed in three events in the state track meet, and won accolades as a running back. Although recruited by numerous major colleges—including Michigan, UCLA, and Texas Tech, among many others—his junior year, he did not attend any of them. A string of injuries his senior football season may have been a contributing factor. Sanders played college football at Southwest Texas State University and played two seasons in the United States Football League for the Houston Gamblers and teamed with Jim Kelly making 101 receptions for 1,370 yards and 11 touchdowns.1984 Houston Gamblers retrieved March 5, 2006 Sanders had been drafted by the New England Patriots in the 1984 NFL Supplemental Draft of USFL and CFL Players. New England traded his rights to the Washington Redskins. The Redskins had two talented receivers in the sure handed Art Monk and tough Gary Clark but felt they needed a legitimate deep threat, leading them to acquire the speedy Sanders. The three were the first trio of wide receivers to each surpass 1,000 receiving yards in a single season, and became known as \\"The Posse.\\" Sanders made only 14 catches in 1986, his first NFL season, but proved he was a deep threat averaging 20.4 yards per catch. His next season was better, as he snatched 34 passes from new starting quarterback Jay Schroeder. After Schroeder's eventual ouster at quarterback, his replacement, Doug Williams, loved Sanders's speed and ability to run after the catch and went to him often. This duo was effective and the Redskins fought their way through the playoffs and into the Super Bowl. Sanders was a standout performer in Super Bowl XXII, catching nine passes for 193 yards and two touchdowns, while also returning three kickoffs for 46 yards. He set Super Bowl records for most receiving yards (193), most total yards (235), most touchdowns in one quarter (2), most receiving yards in one quarter (168), and longest touchdown reception (80 yards, tie) in Washington's 42-10 win over the Denver Broncos.Super Bowl receiving records retrieved March 5, 2006 Shortly after the Super Bowl win, when the Redskins visited the White House, President Ronald Reagan completed a ceremonial pass to Sanders. Sanders had arguably his best season in 1988, as he finished fifth in the NFL on receiving yards with 1,148 and second in receiving touchdowns with 12, a Redskins record. The following season was also a good one for Sanders as he made 80 grabs for 1,138 yards, making him one of three 1,000-yard receivers on the team along with Monk and Clark. Sanders' numbers fell off slightly in 1990, to 56 catches for 727 yards. In the 1991 season, Sanders made 45 catches for 580 yards. The Redskins defeated the Atlanta Falcons and Detroit Lions before beating the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVI. This was Sanders' second Super Bowl victory, his first having come four years prior, in Super Bowl XXII. In June 1990, Sanders was accused of hitting a parking attendant with his car outside a Houston nightclub. He was ultimately acquitted in February 1991, but admitted that the whole ordeal weighed heavily on his mind throughout the 1990 season. Washington drafted top Heisman trophy winning receiver Desmond Howard but he could not unseat Sanders. When Gibbs retired there were coaching and quarterback changes in Washington and Sanders became a free agent after the 1993 season. He signed with the Atlanta Falcons prior to the 1994 season, and played two seasons with them in 1994 and 1995. Sanders signed with the Miami Dolphins after the 1995 seasonRicky Sanders is a done deal retrieved March 5, 2006 but never played a game with them. Sanders finished his 10 NFL seasons with 483 receptions for 6,477 yards and 37 touchdowns. He also rushed for 94 yards and one touchdown, returned two punts for 12 yards, and gained 636 yards on 33 kickoff returns.

Hunor and Magor were, according to a famous Hungarian legend, the ancestors of the Huns and the Magyars. The legend was first promoted in Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum. The legend's aim in providing a common ancestry for the Huns and the Magyars was to suggest historical continuum of the Kingdom of Hungary with the Hun Empire. Magyars led by prince Árpád had conquered the area in the 890s. The territory had previously been held by Attila the Hun in the 5th century. The legend thus tried to prove that the Magyars were simply reclaiming their ancient homeland as descendants of Attila.Engel p.121 According to Simon of Kéza, Hunor and Magor were the sons of Ménrót, a mythical giant, who he partly identified with Nimrod of the Bible (the great-grandson of Noah).  The myth  The brothers Hunor and Magor were the legendary forefathers of the Huns and the Hungarians, or Magyars, according to most Hungarian chronicles. Simon of Kéza's Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum, written in the 1280s, contains the first version of their legend. Other Hungarian chronicles wrote, the brothers were the sons either of Ménrót or of Magog, king of the Scythians. Their mother was Ménrót's wife, Eneth, whose name was derived from the Hungarian word for hind (old eneγ, now ünő), according to Simon of Kéza. Historians Zoltán Kordé and Gyula Kristó say that her name shows, the Hungarians once regarded a hind as their totemistic ancestor, but this pagan concept was reinterpreted after their conversion to Christianity in the 11th century. The Chronicon Pictum makes Hunor and Magor sons of Iaphet (Japhet was the son of Noah in the Book of Genesis).Chonici Hungari cap. 3:4 Hunor and Magor, hunters like their father, were on a hunting trip when they saw their descendants multiplied and populated the nearby lands, founding the 108 clans of the Scythian nation. From them descended Attila the Hun and High Prince Álmos, the father of Árpád.Molnar pp.10–11Ladó János, Bíró Ágnes. Magyar utónévkönyv. Budapest: Vince Kiadó. (2005) p 91 Influence Political The myth was also employed by later writers, most notably chief Justice and jurisconsult István Werbőczy, who used it to extol the Hungarian nobility in his highly influential collection of Hungarian customary law, the Tripartitum (completed 1514, first published 1517). According to Werbőczy, the Hungarians, as descendants of Hunor and Magor, were of 'Scythian' origin and subject to 'Scythian' law. \\"The Hungarians inherited their moral values and customs from the 'Scythians', who had once defeated even Darius and Alexander the Great. Their true vocation was war, which was the only activity that was noble enough to suit them.\\" The nobles were free and equal; the peasants were the descendants of those who had been condemned for cowardice in battle and whose punishment had been commuted from execution to losing their social rank.Engel p.350 Werbőczy thus used the Hunor and Magor myth to justify Hungarian serfdom.See also Paul H. Freedman Images of the Medieval Peasant (Stanford University Press, 1999) p.120 ff. Werbőczy's ideas were eagerly adopted by the Hungarian nobility and became the charter of common law for three centuries.Molnár p.83 The poorer smaller nobles (the gentry) particularly cherished their 'Scythian' identity. According to Engel: > It made the nobility inclined to think in terms of historical fictions and > to cherish illusions. They thought that they had the right to rule their > subjects without having to meet any obligations. It also involved an extreme > respect for traditions, and gave birth to what was an early form of > 'nationalism'. The nobility's ideology overvalued everything that was, or > was thought to be, ancient, and regarded everything that seemed strange or > unusual with aversion or even hostility [...] The nobility also took delight > in hearing about 'Scythian' values, for they imagined they recognised their > own virtues in them. Among the petty nobility the ideal of martial > simplicity must have become especially popular, for it made a virtue out of > their misery and illiteracy.\\"Engel pp.351–2 Literary János Arany retold the myth in his poem Rege a csodaszarvasról (Legend of the Miraculous Stag).

Beavers programs as they exist around the world today had their origins in the Northern Ireland organization The Little Brothers, founded in 1963 to provide a program for boys who were too young to be Cub Scouts. The name \\"Beavers\\" was selected in 1966, as a name that Robert Baden-Powell had considered when creating Wolf Cubs in Cub Scouting. A Beavers program for Canada was designed and tested in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1971 by Harry McCartney, Alan Jones, and Gordon Hanna. The 1971 test was very successful, and Beaver Scouts was expanded across the Scouts Canada organization for 1972, its membership growing quickly each year. Beaver Scouts was made an official part of Scouts Canada in 1974. In years following, other scouting organizations in countries across the world would develop their own Beavers programs. Many share common ideas between them, such as: * A Beaver Scout pledge and/or motto, embracing the ideals of scouting * Earning merit badges * A Beaver Scout uniform, distinct from that of older Cub Scouts * Formed scouting groups, each called a Beaver \\"Colony\\", with optional smaller groups called \\"Lodges\\" * Special ceremonies to commemorate new members, and the graduation of the oldest Beaver Scout members into Cub Scouting * Symbols unique to Beaver Scouts and distinct from Cub Scouts, such as sitting and standing formations, salutes, and handshakes * Use of lore and nicknames sourced from McCartney's 1971 short story Friends of the Forest Variations exist from place to place. Some scouting organizations do not call their groups or members \\"Beavers\\"; often in these cases, they use an animal local to their region instead. The Boy Scouts of America in the United States never created a distinct identity for children of this age. Instead, over time, their Cub Scouts program has expanded to fill this age group. Finally, some Traditional Scouting organizations have never adopted programs for younger children at all, typically on the grounds this was not one of Robert Baden-Powell's original programs. Beavers programs around the world evolved through the 1970s and 1980s, and this continues today. Many Beaver Scouts groups that began as boys only now allow girls into their programs as well, and many Beaver Scouts programs which were not initially considered official parts of their parent scouting organizations are now fully embraced by them. History The first pre-Cub scheme was set up in Northern Ireland by the 1st Dromore Group in 1963 and was called The Little Brothers spreading to Belfast with seven groups two years later. The creation of an under eight provision was sparked by the launch of other younger sections in other youth organizations at the time including the Anchors section of the Boys' Brigade which some feared was partly causing a drop in numbers of Cubs experienced at the time. As the scheme expanded throughout the rest of the province, it was given the official name of Beavers in 1966, having been a name considered by Robert Baden-Powell when creating Wolf Cubs. The Canadian program began in 1971 in Winnipeg and in 1972 it went countrywide. It was made an official section of Scouts Canada in 1974. This was closely followed by the Republic of Ireland in the same year. Beaver Scouts became an official section in the UK in 1986. Beavers and programs for similar ages spread to a few other Scouting organizations around the world. Beavers were not formally recognized by many Scouting organizations until well into the 1980s. Beaver programs around the world Australia =Baden-Powell Scouts' Association in Australia= The Baden-Powell Scouts' Association in Australia has a programme called Koalas, although some Groups do not operate Koalas as they were not part of Baden-Powell's concept. The programme serves 5 to eight year olds, and is followed by Wolf Cubs. The Koalas program uses a catch phrase and themes around \\"Koalas climb high\\" with participants reciting the phrase and mimicking the motions of a climbing Koala. =Scouts Australia= In Scouts Australia, this age section is called Joeys. A joey is an infant kangaroo. The Joeys programme uses a catch phrase and themes around \\"Hop, Hop, Hop\\" such as Help Other People with participants reciting the phrase and mimicking the motions of a hopping joey kangaroo. Canada =Scouts Canada= In Scouts Canada Beavers are aged five to seven. Members normally wear a brown vest as a uniform with a brown Beaver coby hat. The Scouts Canada Beavers programme is based on the specially written short story Friends of the Forest written by Harry McCartney. McCartney was the Manitoba Executive Scout Director in 1971. With the help of two others, Alan Jones, and Gordon Hanna, the Beavers programme was tested and successfully brought to Scouts Canada officially and country-wide, by 1974. A five-year-old Beaver is a brown tail, a six-year-old is a blue tail and a seven-year-old is a white tail. The tail is attached to the back brim of the Beaver Hat on a Beaver's uniform. Beavers, at the end of their third (white tail) year, participate in a \\"swim-up\\" ceremony to become Cub Scouts. =Association des Scouts du Canada= In the Association des Scouts du Canada Castors (Beavers in French) are aged from seven to nine. Members normally wear a yellow T-shirt and tan or brown pants. The programme is based on a specially written story called Les aventures de Cartouche et Namor (The Adventures of Cartouche and Namor). Castor Promise: Je m'engage à faire des efforts pour jouer avec et comme les autres. (I promise to do my best to play with and like others) Castor Motto: Effort (Effort) The new Beaver receives his neckerchief and uniform at a promise ceremony where the Beaver, generally, must demonstrate that he has joined the unit. From that moment, the new Beavers have entered the Beaver programme. Beavers collect individual badges following a four-step programme: *Source (spring) which is for objective integration *Ruisseau (stream) which is for objective participation *Cascades (waterfall) which is for objective initiative *Étang (pond) which is for objective sharing They can also collect two technique badges which are called buchettes (splint): Security and Environnement. When they climb to Cubs, they receive a badge called \\"Castor découvreur\\" (discovering beaver). =Baden- Powell Service Association= In the Baden-Powell Service Association in Canada, the corresponding section for this age group is called Otters. Ireland Japan Beaver Scouts (Japanese: ビーバースカウト) started in Japan in 1986. Like all of the Scout Association of Japan units, Beavers have been coed since 1995. Beaver Scouts are the youngest age group in Scouting Japan, a two year program that covers 1st and 2nd grades. Mexico In Asociación de Scouts de México, A.C. there was a Beaver Section, but it has been closed down.The Canadian Leader Magazine, August/September 2006, page 37. However, there are many beaver groups or \\"castores\\" in Spanish working unofficially in parallel. New Zealand In Scouts New Zealand, this section is called Keas. A kea is a New Zealand parrot. South Africa In 2019, Scouts South Africa launched a Meerkats branch for children age 5 and 6. The motto \\"Stand Tall\\" is based on the upright posture of a meerkat standing guard near its burrow. Switzerland Various troops in Switzerland also have Beavers (in some Cantons also called Fünkli, Füchse or Murmeli), but they are not officially recognised by the Swiss Guide and Scout Movement. They usually only wear the troop's neckerchief but have no uniform. United Kingdom =The Scout Association= The Scout Association officially recognised Beaver Scouts in 1986, but there had been a fully fledged Beaver section in Northern Ireland since 1966, plus informal colonies in other parts of the UK country for many years prior to 1986. The programme is run for 5¾ to 8 year olds, and precedes Cubs. The Beavers section currently makes up the largest proportion of participants within The Scout Association in the United Kingdom, with many colonies having waiting lists, some of which may have several times as many waiting as there are actual members. The uniform is a turquoise sweatshirt or T-shirt, with the group colours for the neckerchief. The motto, shared with the rest of the UK Scout Association sections, is \\"Be Prepared\\". =Baden- Powell Scouts' Association= The Baden-Powell Scouts' Association recognised Beavers in 1982, although some Groups do not operate Beaver colonies as they were not part of Baden-Powell's concept. The programme serves five to eight year olds, and is followed by Wolf Cubs.Baden-Powell Beavers The uniform is a vest that can be many colours, with the group colours for the neckerchief. Some groups also issue Beavers with caps. United States =Boy Scouts of America= The Boy Scouts of America never organized a multi-year Beavers program separate from Cub Scouting. While the modern incarnation of Cub Scouting in the United States contains programs for grades K through 5, the path to this structure was evolutionary. As of 1981, the earliest program available in Cub Scouting was the Wolf Scout program, intended for boys eight years of age. In the fall of 1982, BSA introduced the Tiger Cubs program for 7-year-olds, as a branch distinct from the Cub Scouts. When scout membership was changed to grade-based instead of age-based in 1986, Tiger Cubs became the 1st grade program, effectively changing the eligible age of most Tiger Cubs boys to 6. Tiger Cubs were opened to Cub Scout Packs in 1993, and Tiger Dens introduced in 1995. By 2001, Tigers (as they are now called) were fully integrated into Cub Scouting and have their own merit badge. In 2016 a pilot program began for Kindergarten (age 5-6) boys with a new rank, Lion. Lion Scouts became a permanent rank inside Cub Scouts in 2018. Also in 2018, as part of the larger structural change of allowing girls into all Cub Scouts programs, girl dens at all ranks, including Lion and Tiger, were allowed. =Baden-Powell Service Association= In the Baden-Powell Service Association, the corresponding section for this age group is called Otters.

He was named \\"Hrothgar\\" after Hroðgar in Beowulf, which his father was reading at the time of his birth. However, he came to be known as John when he started to travel to the United States, and when he was knighted he found it easier to call himself \\"Sir John\\" than \\"Sir Hrothgar\\".F. M. L. Thompson Obituary, The Independent (11 November 2002)Obituary, The Telegraph (18 November 2002) His surname was assumed by a seventeenth-century forebear after the prophet Habakkuk, it being a Welsh custom at that time to take patronymics from the Bible. He was educated at Barry County School and St John's College, Cambridge (scholar and Strathcona Student, starred first class degree in History 1936). (He was not, as sometimes erroneously stated, connected with Jesus College, Cambridge).David Landes, Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society vol. 149, no. 1 (March 2005), pp. 99–101. He began to study for a PhD under John Clapham, but his progress was interrupted by the Second World War. In 1938, he was elected a Fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge, a position he held until 1950. He worked in the Foreign Office 1939–42 and the Board of Trade 1942–46, during which period he still found time to carry out research at the Public Record Office and in the archives of country houses. After World War II, he was from 1946 until 1950 Director of Studies and Librarian of the college and Lecturer in the Faculty of Economics. In 1973, Pembroke College elected him to an Honorary Fellowship. From 1950 until 1960, he was editor, with Michael Postan, of The Economic History Review. In 1950, he moved to Oxford, where he would remain for the rest of his life. At the age of just thirty-five he had been appointed Chichele Professor of Economic History in the University of Oxford and Professorial Fellow of All Souls College.

Swoboda believed that his exercise system combined with drinking four pints of water a day would cure almost any illness.Axson, Stockton. (1993). \\"Brother Woodrow\\": A Memoir of Woodrow Wilson. Princeton University Press. p. 254. Biography Swoboda was born in Vienna on March 8, 1873, and immigrated to the U.S. in 1881 with his father, Adolf Swoboda. They settled in Omaha, Nebraska where he quickly found work in the local bathhouses. Swoboda subsequently worked in Omaha meatpacking factories but did not receive medical training, etc., despite insinuations of a formal education. Conscious Evolution Swoboda throughout his career advertised his pseudoscientific ideas under the names \\"System of Physiological Exercise\\", \\"Swoboda's System\\" and \\"Conscious Evolution\\". He described conscious evolution as \\"based upon a discovery in the cells of the body which I made, and which has revolutionized the effect of exercise.\\" His mail order advertisements promised to cure practically all diseases. He argued that his system was the only natural method for obtaining health as it rejuvenates cells, organs and tissue in the body. He also advertised his system as restoring youth, no matter the age. His exercise course did not use apparatus or exercise equipment. He charged 20$ for his complete course which consisted of six tension exercise lessons, such as flexing the forearm. He also promised his readers that they have the guarantee of United States government that his system works. This false statement was later dropped. Swoboda managed to dupe Woodrow Wilson into using his exercise system during 1901-1902. Swoboda's system was advertised in Harper's Weekly, Pearson's Magazine and Popular Mechanics.The Youthful Life: How Conscious Energy Makes it Possible for All of Us.

Commonly one or both gonads is an ovotestis containing both types of tissue. Ovotesticular disorders are a family of disorders which includes true hermaphroditism. Although similar in some ways to mixed gonadal dysgenesis, the conditions can be distinguished histologically. * Presentation External genitalia are often ambiguous, the degree depending mainly on the amount of testosterone produced by the testicular tissue between 8 and 16 weeks of gestation. Causes There are several ways in which this may occur. * It can be caused by the division of one ovum, followed by fertilization of each haploid ovum and fusion of the two zygotes early in development. * Alternately, an ovum can be fertilized by two sperm followed by trisomic rescue in one or more daughter cells. * Two ova fertilized by two sperm cells will occasionally fuse to form a tetragametic chimera. If one male zygote and one female zygote fuse. * It can be associated with a mutation in the SRY gene. Karyotypes Encountered karyotypes include 46XX/46XY, or 46XX/47XXY or XX & XY with SRY mutations, mixed chromosomal anomalies or hormone deficiency/excess disorders, 47XXY, and various degrees of mosaicism of these and a variety of others. The 3 primary karyotypes for true hermaphroditism are XX with genetic anomalies (55-70% of cases), XX/XY (20-30% of cases) & XY (5-15% of cases) with the remainder being a variety of other chromosomal anomalies and mosaicisms.  Prevalence  Estimated frequency of ovotestes is one in 83,000 births (0.0012%). Numbers on confirmed cases is difficult but by 1991 approximately 500 cases have been confirmed.  Fertility  There are extremely rare cases of fertility in \\"truly hermaphroditic\\" humans. These individuals typically have functional ovarian tissue, but underdeveloped testes that are unable to engage in spermatogenesis. As a result, these individuals are fertile, but not auto-fertile. There is evidence that 50% of individuals with ovotestes can go through ovulation but spermatogenesis is rare. Spermatogenesis has been documented in 12% of cases. There is a hypothetical scenario, though, in which it could be possible for a human to self fertilize. If a human chimera is formed from a male and female zygote fusing into a single embryo, giving an individual functional gonadal tissue of both types, such a self-fertilization is feasible. Indeed, it is known to occur in non-human species where hermaphroditic animals are common, including some mammals. However, no such case of functional self-fertilization has ever been documented in humans. As of 2010, there have been at least 11 reported cases of fertility in true hermaphrodite humans in the scientific literature, with one case of a person with XY-predominant (96%) mosaic giving birth. Etymology The term derives from the , from , which derives from Hermaphroditos ( Ἑρμαϕρόδιτος), the son of Hermes and Aphrodite in Greek mythology. According to Ovid, he fused with the nymph Salmacis resulting in one individual possessing physical traits of both sexes;Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book IV: The story of Hermaphroditus and Salmacis. according to the earlier Diodorus Siculus, he was born with a physical body combining both sexes.Diodorus Siculus — Book IV Chapters 1–7 The word hermaphrodite entered the English lexicon in the late fourteenth century.Oxford English Dictionary, 1st edn, s.v. hermaphrodite, n. and adj.; Society and culture Having ovotesticular disorder of sex development can make one inadmissible for service in the United States Armed Forces. M.C. v. Aaronson The U.S. legal case of M.C. v. Aaronson, advanced by intersex civil society organization interACT with the Southern Poverty Law Center was brought before the courts in 2013. The child in the case was born in December 2004 with ovotestes, initially determined as male, but subsequently assigned female and placed in the care of South Carolina Department of Social Services in February 2005. Physicians responsible for M.C. initially concluded that surgery was not urgent or necessary and M.C. had potential to identify as male or female, but, in April 2006, M.C. was subjected to feminizing medical interventions. He was adopted in December 2006. Aged 8 at the time the case was taken, he now identifies as male. The Southern Poverty Law Center state: \\"In M.C.’s condition, there is no way to tell whether the child will ultimately identify as a boy or a girl. Instead, the doctors decided to assign M.C. female and change his body to fit their stereotype of how a girl should look.\\" The defendant in the case, Dr Ian Aaronson, had written in 2001 that \\"feminizing genitoplasty on an infant who might eventually identify herself as a boy would be catastrophic\\". The defendants sought to dismiss the case and seek a defense of qualified immunity, but these were denied by the District Court for the District of South Carolina. In January 2015, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed this decision and dismissed the complaint, stating that, \\"it did not “mean to diminish the severe harm that M.C. claims to have suffered” but that a reasonable official in 2006 did not have fair warning from then-existing precedent that performing sex assignment surgery on sixteen-month-old M.C. violated a clearly established constitutional right.\\" The Court did not rule on whether or not the surgery violated M.C.'s constitutional rights. State suits were subsequently filed. In July 2017, it was reported that the case had been settled out of court by the Medical University of South Carolina for $440,000. The University denied negligence, but agreed to a \\"compromise\\" settlement to avoid \\"costs of litigation.\\" See also * 46,XX/46,XY * Intersex people and military service in the United States References  External links  * Category:Congenital disorders of genital organs Category:Rare diseases Category:Intersex variations ","title":"True hermaphroditism"},{"id":"4280058","text":"This article is a list of Arizona Diamondbacks broadcasters.

The accord established the procedures for setting up the Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT), which was sworn into office in November, 1979. By mutual agreement, Goukouni Oueddei was named president, Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué was appointed vice-president, and Hissène Habré was named minister of national defense, veterans, and war victims. The distribution of cabinet positions was balanced between south (eleven portfolios), north, center, and east (thirteen), and among protégés of neighboring states. A peacekeeping mission of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), to be drawn from troops from Republic of the Congo, Guinea, and Benin, was to replace the French. This force never materialized in any effective sense. The participants of GUNT deeply mistrusted each other, and they never achieved a sense of coherence. As a result, the various factional militias remained armed. By January 1980, a unit of Habré's army was attacking the forces of one of the constituent groups of GUNT in Ouaddaï Prefecture, and the Chadian conflict soon reached new heights of intensity with widespread destruction of life and property.

The ultimate goal of the highway is to provide a high speed north–south connection between Morgantown and the eastern side of Pittsburgh while revitalizing economically distressed Monongahela River Valley towns in Fayette and Washington counties, serving as an alternative to Interstate 79 to the west, as well as relieving the PA 51 alignment from Pittsburgh to Uniontown. Although it is being built to Interstate Highway standards, there is debate as to whether or not the freeway will become part of the Interstate Highway System. At least one proposal was to give it the Interstate 97 designation (unrelated to the existing I-97 in Maryland), while others have been to make it a spur route of I-68. In the interim, the highway uses state highway designations instead, as it does not parallel an existing U.S. Route for its entire length, though it does parallel and at times run concurrent with U.S. Route 40 and U.S. Route 119 for portions of its length. The route, in its three jurisdictions, uses the number 43 for familiarity- based reasons, and is thus known as West Virginia Route 43 (WV 43), Pennsylvania Route 43 (PA 43), and PA Turnpike 43\\\\. Most of the route is maintained by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, while the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation maintains small portions of the highway near Uniontown, and the West Virginia Division of Highways maintains the short section in West Virginia. Despite the numerous agencies overseeing the highway, it is one continuous highway. South of Jefferson Hills, the Mon–Fayette Expressway is complete. Construction to complete the highway to Duquesne is scheduled to begin in 2024, with plans existing to extend the road further to Monroeville. Route description West Virginia Sunset view of Rubles Run Bridge, the northernmost bridge on WV 43\\\\. The Mason–Dixon Line runs across the northern point of the bridge. The Mon–Fayette Expressway begins at a diamond interchange with I-68 in Cheat Lake in Monongalia County, West Virginia, heading north as a four-lane freeway signed as WV 43\\\\. The highway passes near some residential development and comes to an interchange with Bowers Lane that provides access to County Route 857. Following this, WV 43 curves northeast and runs through forested areas, turning to the north. Pennsylvania The Mon–Fayette Expressway crosses the state line into Pennsylvania, where it becomes PA Turnpike 43, which is maintained by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC). The freeway heads through Springhill Township in Fayette County, passing through forested areas with some fields. The first interchange in the state is at Gans Road, which provides access to US 119 to the west and PA 857 to the east. Here, PA Turnpike 43 becomes a toll road and continues northeast through more rural areas, where it crosses into Georges Township and comes to a diamond interchange with Rubles Mill Road that accesses PA 857 a short distance to the east. Past this interchange, the highway comes to the Fairchance mainline toll plaza before it curves north and then northwest. The route passes to the west of an industrial park before reaching an interchange with Big Six Road which provides access to US 119 and PA 857. At this point, the Mon–Fayette Expressway becomes toll-free and maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT), signed as PA 43\\\\. The roadway continues through farmland and woodland as it bypasses Fairchance to the west. Farther north, PA 43 comes to an interchange with US 119 and the northern terminus of PA 857, at which point the road becomes US 119\\\\. PA 43 continues as an unsigned concurrency with US 119 for around Uniontown, with a sign saying that PA 43 traffic should follow signs for US 119 through Uniontown. A short distance later, US 119 and the unsigned PA 43 cross together into South Union Township and reach an interchange with the US 40 freeway, at which point US 40 merges with US 119 and the unsigned PA 43, joining the concurrency. The three routes bypass Uniontown to the west on the freeway, running between farmland and woods to the west and residential neighborhoods to the east. The highway comes to a diamond interchange with Walnut Hill Road, where it curves northwest and passes near more homes. US 40/US 119/unsigned PA 43 curves northeast and reaches a trumpet interchange providing access to PA 21 in a commercial area. A short distance later, the freeway comes to an interchange with the western terminus of US 40 Business, at which point US 40 splits to the northwest. US 119 and the unsigned PA 43 continue northeast on the freeway into North Union Township, where they run between rural areas to the northwest and residential areas to the southeast. The unsigned concurrency ends as PA Turnpike 43, again a toll road maintained by the PTC, splits from US 119 at an interchange that also serves PA 51. The Mon–Fayette Expressway heads northwest through rural areas with some nearby development. The highway reaches a diamond interchange with Old Pittsburgh Road which provides connections to US 40 and PA 51\\\\. Past this interchange, the tollway crosses into Menallen Township and runs through a mix of farmland and woodland. Farther northwest, PA Turnpike 43 comes to an interchange at Keisterville-Upper Middletown Road, which provides access to US 40 to the southwest. The Mon–Fayette Expressway enters Redstone Township, where it reaches the Redstone mainline toll plaza. The highway continues northwest through rural land and comes to a diamond interchange with US 40\\\\. Following this, the toll road heads northwest through rural areas to the south of Brownsville, crossing the Dunlap Creek into Luzerne Township. Here, PA Turnpike 43 reaches the Telegraph Road exit and curves to the northwest. The Mon–Fayette Expressway crosses the Monongahela River on the Mon–Fayette Expressway Bridge into Centerville in Washington County, where it curves north and comes to an interchange with PA 88\\\\. At this point, the road becomes toll- free again, though still owned by the PTC and signed PA Turnpike 43\\\\. PA 88 also joins the freeway for a short concurrency, with the road heading northeast through forested areas. The highway comes to a cloverleaf interchange with US 40, at which point PA 88 splits to the east to follow US 40 and PA Turnpike 43 continues northeast on the Mon–Fayette Expressway, entering California. The road continues through fields and woods, reaching an interchange with Malden Road that provides access to PA 88 Truck. The tollway continues north through dense woodland, bypassing the center of California to the west. The median widens as the highway comes to the exit for Elco Hill Road, after which it once again becomes a toll road. The median narrows again as PA Turnpike 43 curves northwest and comes to the California mainline toll plaza. A short distance later, the Mon–Fayette Expressway enters Fallowfield Township and comes to a cloverleaf interchange serving I-70. PA 136 exit sign along PA Turnpike 43 in Carroll TownshipPast this interchange, the toll road winds north through more woodland and reaches a diamond interchange at Coyle Curtain Road, which provides access to the communities of Charleroi and Donora to the east. PA Turnpike 43 heads into Carroll Township and makes a sharp curve to the west, continuing through more rural areas. The tollway curves north again near a mine and comes to the PA 136 exit. The Mon–Fayette Expressway crosses the Mingo Creek Viaduct into Union Township and continues north through wooded areas with some fields and mines. Farther north, the highway comes to a diamond interchange serving Finleyville-Elrama Road. Past this interchange, PA Turnpike 43 curves to the northeast. The tollway enters Jefferson Hills in Allegheny County, where it continues through more rural areas. The toll road reaches the Jefferson Hills mainline toll plaza and continues northeast, with the median widening and the road narrowing to one lane in each direction as it comes to a bridge over PA 51\\\\. The Mon–Fayette Expressway continues a short distance to its current northern terminus, where the traffic lanes turn west as Jefferson Boulevard and head to PA 51. Tolls The Mon–Fayette Expressway is a toll road for most of its length. Unlike the Pennsylvania Turnpike mainline and the Northeast Extension, which uses long-distance tickets, the Mon–Fayette Expressway collects fixed tolls at regular intervals. In addition, auxiliary toll plazas exist on certain on- and off-ramps. In 2008, the PTC retrofitted all toll plazas to accept E-ZPass, and Express E-ZPass lanes are available at the newer toll plazas. The Mon–Fayette Expressway has four mainline toll barriers located in Fairchance, Redstone, California, and Jefferson Hills. , the Fairchance and California barriers charge $2.50 using cash and $1.50 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles while the Redstone and Jefferson Hills barriers charge $3.00 using cash and $2.10 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles. There are also ramp toll plazas at the northbound exit and southbound entrances at exit 4, 15, and 18, the southbound exit and northbound entrance at exits 22 and 26, and the northbound exit and southbound entrance at exits 39, 44, and 48. The ramp tolls cost $1.80 using cash and $1.10 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles. All-electronic tolling using toll-by-plate (which uses automatic license plate recognition to take a photo of the vehicle's license plate and mail a bill to the vehicle owner) or E-ZPass was planned be implemented on the Mon–Fayette Expressway, along with the remainder of the Pennsylvania Turnpike system, in the later part of 2021. However, in March 2020 all-electronic tolling was implemented along the Mon–Fayette Expressway as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The all- electronic tolling was intended to be temporary, but in June 2020 the move to all-electronic tolling became permanent, with toll collectors laid off. In West Virginia, legislators have flip-flopped a few times regarding whether their section will be a toll road. When tolls were first proposed, West Virginia had planned to work with the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission to collect tolls at the existing Pennsylvania mainline plaza, but this plan was not accepted by the West Virginia Legislature. Instead, West Virginia planned to construct a toll plaza north of Goodwin Hill Road. West Virginia officials also contemplated whether to use all-electronic tolling or a more traditional tolling scheme. In the end, tolling plans were scrapped by West Virginia's legislature. Rejection resulted from concerns related to camera enforcement, billing, and operational costs. However, West Virginia reserves the right to levy tolls in the future if these issues are settled. History Early history The Mon–Fayette Expressway was originally proposed in the 1950s as a way to link the coke- and steel-producing towns situated in the Monongahela River Valley, thus providing a supplement to existing rail and river passages. Running along the existing PA Route 48, the highway was initially referred to as “New 48” and right-of-way clearance began in the early 1970s. PennDOT initiated construction in 1973, and the first segment opened in 1977. This segment consisted of a partial cloverleaf interchange at U.S. Route 40 and a stretch of four-lane highway that spurred south of the new interchange toward Fredericktown. Despite severe financial constraints, PennDOT built the remainder of the ramps at the U.S. 40 cloverleaf along with a separate stretch of highway near California in the early 1980s. Limited funding caused the project to be placed on hiatus in the early 1980s. During this time, the coke and steel industry that originally inspired the route experienced an economic downturn and near collapse. Rather than cancel the project, local leaders touted it as a means of stimulating the distressed economy; providing a link from the City of Pittsburgh to West Virginia along which manufacturing facilities and other industry could be located. The project was redesignated as the Mon–Fayette Expressway, a portmanteau of Monongahela River Valley and Fayette County, two of the areas the new road would connect. The project was designed to be completed in phases with the most controversial segment, PA 51 to Pittsburgh, scheduled to be completed last. Chadville Demonstration Project In 1985, the Mon–Fayette Expressway project was transferred to the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC) under Act 61 legislation. While PennDOT assessed preliminary engineering and right-of-way options in the 1970s and early 1980s, the PTC accelerated design work and began unveiling detailed plans in earnest by the late 1980s. Funding appropriated through the PTC allowed construction to resume in 1988, and on October 12, 1990, the entire stretch from U.S. Route 40 to Interstate 70 opened to traffic. Initially, the PTC did not have adequate funding to construct new sections, but Representative Austin Murphy secured congressional funds that directed PennDOT to build a stretch of the expressway south of Uniontown. Aside from being part of a larger project, the new segment was designed to provide high speed access between the Uniontown bypass, Fairchance, and a new business park. This section, dubbed the Chadville Demonstration Project, opened in November 1992. The section of the highway from US 40 to I-70 was signed PA 43 Toll until 2000.Pennsylvania Highways: PA Turnpike 43 Mason-Dixon Link Ground level view under Morgan Run Bridge looking northbound In the early 1990s, the Pennsylvania General Assembly dedicated a portion of state fuel excise tax revenue to the PTC. This new revenue stream initially provided the funding to complete an section from the southern terminus of the Chadville Demonstration Project to the West Virginia state line as well as a section from the Interstate 70 interchange to Pennsylvania Route 51 in Jefferson Hills. On March 1, 2000, most of the section between the Chadville Demonstration Project and the West Virginia state line opened to traffic. J. Barry Stout Expressway Named formally for the PA State Senator who pushed to expand the state's highway system, the J. Barry Stout Expressway segment connects Interstate 70 with Route 51. Construction began in 1995 and the entire segment from Interstate 70 to Route 51 was open by April 12, 2002. The Joe Montana Bridge, named after the Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback who grew up in the immediate area in nearby Monongahela, Pennsylvania, is located along the route. Uniontown-to-Brownsville In 2006, construction began on a stretch connecting the oldest section of the expressway near Fredericktown to the northern terminus of the Chadville Demonstration Project. Known locally as the \\"Uniontown-to-Brownsville Project,\\" limited funding necessitated a two-phased approach to completion. The first phase involved construction of an section of expressway running parallel to a hazardous stretch of U.S. Route 40 between Brownsville and Uniontown. Phase 1 opened on October 23, 2008. The second phase consisted of a section that connects first phase of this project to the oldest portion of the expressway near Fredericktown, as well as the Mon–Fayette Expressway Bridge crossing the Monongahela River. Additionally, the second phase includes a directional T interchange at U.S. Route 119 in Uniontown. On December 13, 2010, the U.S. 119 interchange opened to traffic, and the remainder of Phase 2 opened with a soft launch on July 16, 2012. A formal ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on August 2, 2012. Completion of Phase 2 brought an uninterrupted stretch of highway between I-68 and the current northern terminus at Pennsylvania Route 51 in Jefferson Hills, Pennsylvania. West Virginia Route 43 View north at the south end of WV 43 at I-68 in Cheat Lake In West Virginia, construction commenced in 2000 but progressed slowly due to limited funding. By the end of 2003, only the Rubles Run Bridge and two pieces of highway totaling little more than were completed. Over the next few years, construction inched ahead. By 2009, the Morgan Run Bridge was finished, and local roads near Cheat Lake were re-built to accommodate the expressway. The final contracts to build the Cheat Lake and Interstate 68 interchanges were respectively awarded in December 2008 and July 2009, partly as a result of an ARRA fund infusion. On July 11, 2011, officials in West Virginia opened their section of the Mon–Fayette Expressway. Likewise, the PTC opened the southernmost in Pennsylvania, which sat unused for over a decade. Noteworthy features on the West Virginia section include two high-level bridges, along with the I-68 interchange, which is a hybrid design that utilizes both high-speed ramps and at-grade intersections. A second phase for this interchange is planned, but that project will not be undertaken until traffic volumes merit. If the second phase is built, the I-68 interchange will be upgraded to a directional T. 2013 plane landing During the morning of August 6, 2013, a 1946 Universal Stinson, in which two people were flying, landed on the expressway near Centerville, Pennsylvania after encountering propeller problems. The plane had taken off from the Rostraver Airport and was heading toward Waynesburg, Pennsylvania and had reached an altitude of 3,000 ft. After landing, the plane passed several cars on the highway before pulling off to the side of an on-ramp. The pilot, a local teacher from Brownsville Area School District, was later fined nearly $3,000 by the PTC in addition to paying $1,000 in towing costs. Future The remaining of highway in Allegheny County between PA 51 and I-376 has yet to be constructed. After a review of several alternative alignments designated by colors (green, yellow, orange, and blue), a series of public meetings hosted by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission sought feedback from residents likely affected by the expressway's construction. The preferred route was identified as running parallel to PA 837 through the communities of Clairton and Duquesne, crossing over the Monongahela River near Kennywood Park, and then continuing along the northern side of the river through Braddock, Rankin, and Glen Hazel, finally connecting to I-376 at Oakland. A western spur would be located near the crossing and continue north through Turtle Creek and Monroeville to I-376 in Wilkins. The addition of the spur allows for an alternative to I-376 that would bypass the often congested Squirrel Hill Tunnel. The western spur would have continued the PA Turnpike 43 routing while the eastern spur would have continued the PA Turnpike 576 routing from the routes' planned junction approximately south of Finleyville Elrama Road. Kennywood acquired nearly of property for a potential expansion of the park on the condition that the leg to Monroeville is built. After environmental clearances were obtained and right-of-way acquisition had begun, the project was placed on hold due to lack of funding. Current estimates for this section are in the neighborhood of $3.6 billion and funding has not been identified. A public-private partnership was explored but nothing feasible resulted. It is unlikely that any new construction will commence in the near future unless a new tax is imposed or private funding identified, although funding was secured for the section of PA Turnpike 576 in between Interstate 79 and its current eastern terminus at US 22, bringing hope for an eventual completion of the Mon–Fayette Expressway. In July 2013, the Allegheny County portion of the expressway was again the subject of news articles indicating that a change in approach may be taken. This revised approach would allow for completion of the expressway to Monroeville. The spur to Pittsburgh would not be constructed but rather the East Busway would be extended to Monroeville to allow for park and ride into downtown Pittsburgh. Another option currently being considered is to open the Busway to high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) traffic. In May 2013, a raise in the oil tax cap in Pennsylvania was proposed in the Pennsylvania General Assembly to fund additional transportation projects, including completing the Mon–Fayette Expressway and the Southern Beltway, as part of a larger transportation bill to help fund projects in the state. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett signed a modified version of the bill into law, known as Act 89, on November 25, 2013, after much debate in the General Assembly that nearly killed the bill before it was passed. Act 89, which local politicians acknowledged that without passage would have killed the remaining segments of the Mon–Fayette Expressway, is expected to provide funding to complete the Southern Beltway all the way to the Mon–Fayette Expressway and provide a little less than half of the $2.2 billion (as of December 2013) needed to complete the Mon–Fayette Expressway, as well as the option for P3 funding. It was also acknowledged that like the Uniontown-to-Brownsville Project, the final leg may be built in multiple phases in order to preserve funding for other projects in the state. The second leg of the Southern Beltway, which will proceed in construction as had already been announced, will be the first portion of the two highways that will be built with the new funding available, with a planned opening to I-79 in 2019. In December 2014, it was reported that the Mon–Fayette Expressway and the Southern Beltway might get additional funding through foreign investors who obtain an EB-5 visa in exchange for investing at least $500,000 for public projects. The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission will use EB-5 funding for the Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project first before determining if it will use such funding for other projects. On June 18, 2015, the PTC announced that the segment for the Mon–Fayette Expressway from Jefferson Hills to Monroeville will receive some Act 89 funding and will return to the design phase. The other leg of the Mon–Fayette Expressway into Pittsburgh was officially canceled outright, citing cost and local opposition. It is currently unclear whether this road will be designated PA Turnpike 43 or PA Turnpike 576\\\\. In March 2018, the PTC released its plans for the expressway from PA 51 in Jefferson Hills to PA 837 in Duquesne. This section is currently in the final design phase, with construction expected to begin in 2024. Construction on the section of the expressway between PA 837 in Duquesne and I-376 in Monroeville is expected to follow, but may be delayed due to funding shortfalls resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2019 a proposal was made for an expressway to run from the Mon–Fayette Expressway to Route 885 near the Glenwood Bridge. Exit list Related roads In the 1990s, the Mon–Fayette Expressway project was expanded to include another highway, the Southern Beltway. The Southern Beltway is planned to be a high-speed east–west link between the Mon–Fayette Expressway, Interstate 79, U.S. Route 22, Interstate 376, and Pittsburgh International Airport. A section of the beltway between Pittsburgh International Airport/Interstate 376 and U.S. Route 22 opened to traffic in 2006. The new road has been designated as Pennsylvania Route 576. A section between U.S. 22 and I-79 is expected to be open by 2021, with the third section being between I-79 and a section of the Mon–Fayette Expressway near Finleyville, Pennsylvania just south of the current northern terminus. In order to provide access to certain interchanges within the Uniontown-to- Brownsville project, the PTC had to build several toll-free connectors, the most notable of which extended a four-lane section of U.S. Route 40 near Brownsville, eliminating a forty-year-old freeway stub in the process. Near Uniontown, the PTC constructed a four-lane road, named Northgate Highway, between U.S. Route 40 and Pennsylvania Route 51. In addition, a new connector was added to join Telegraph Road and Bull Run Road in Luzerne Township, potentially opening many acres of land to future development. The aforementioned access roads were necessary to provide access to exits 22, 15, and 26 respectively, but these routes were also designed to improve local connections and accommodate any future economic development in the interchanges' immediate vicinity.

After the English Civil War, he was appointed Major-General for Bedfordshire, Huntingdonshire, Northamptonshire and Rutland during the Rule of the Major-Generals. Early life He was born in Barnwell, Northamptonshire, the son of Noel or Neville Boteler; Ivan Roots considers that the clergyman Edward Boteler (died 1670) was his brother. Political career In April 1640, Boteler was elected MP for Bedford in the Short Parliament in a double return and was taken off. He became a Colonel of Horse (cavalry) in the New Model Army. He was zealous and uncompromising in his hostility to his religious and political enemies, and was a severe persecutor of Quakers in Northamptonshire. In 1656 he advocated that James Nayler should be stoned to death for blasphemy. Boteler was also aggressive in his persecution of Royalists in his area, unlawfully imprisoning the Earl of Northampton for failing to pay his taxes. Boteler represented Bedford in the First Protectorate Parliament, and he represented Northamptonshire in the Second Protectorate Parliament from 1656 to 1658. Early in 1658, Boteler replaced William Packer as commander of Cromwell’s regiment of horse. Legal problems Boteler was not returned to Third Protectorate Parliament in 1659, and his record as a Major-General in Northamptonshire, et. al., was severely attacked, he was nearly impeached, by MPs in that Parliament.

Hemet-Ryan is a main Cal Fire Air Attack Base, also used for civil purposes, Civil Air Patrol meetings, and more. It is home to a Riverside County Sheriff's Department aviation unit and a Mercy Air Air ambulance. The airport is named after the late Claude T. Ryan. History The airfield opened in September 1940 for the United States Army Air Corps. It was assigned to the West Coast Training Center (later Western Flying Training Command) as a primary (level 1) pilot training airfield. Later it was activated as an Air Corps Training Detachment with Ryan School of Aeronautics conducting primary flight training under control of 5th Flying Training Detachment. Known sub-bases and auxiliaries were:Highland Auxiliary Field * Banning Auxiliary Field (Unknown location) * Highland Auxiliary Field (Unknown location) * Ryan Auxiliary Field #1 * Ryan Auxiliary Field #2 * Ryan Auxiliary Field #3 militarymuseum.org, Ryan Auxiliary Field #3 * Valle Vista Auxiliary Field militarymuseum.org, Valle Vista Auxiliary Field * Gibbs Auxiliary Field Flight training was performed with PT-17 Stearmans as the primary trainer, along with Ryan PT-21 Recruits. Over 14,000 army cadets were trained to fly. New Ryan PT-25s were delivered to the field by WAFS in July 1943.Associated Press, “Wafs Fly Planes To Hemet for Use At Army School”, The San Bernardino Daily Suni, San Bernardino, California, Monday 12 July 1943, Volume 49, page 4. The airport was inactivated in December 1944 with the drawdown of AAFTC's pilot training program, the airfield was declared surplus and turned over to the Army Corps of Engineers. Later, the airfield was discharged to the War Assets Administration. The facility eventually became a public airport owned and operated by Riverside County. For over 50 years (about 1959–2009), Hemet-Ryan was a popular site for operating sailplanes (gliders). Sailplane Enterprises, a commercial glider flight school, operated there from 1969-2009. The Cypress Soaring club was based there from 1969-2009. Orange County Soaring Association (OCSA) also used Hemet-Ryan as its home base from 1991–2009. On September 30, 2009, the Riverside County Economic Development Agency closed Hemet-Ryan to glider operations. OCSA filed a complaint with the FAA pursuant to Title 14 CFR Part 16 against the County of Riverside. On February 11, 2011, the FAA ruled that the closure was in violation of Federal law and Federal grant obligations. The County declined to appeal the ruling. On November 18, 2016, the Cypress Soaring Club returned to Hemet-Ryan and resumed sailplane operations on runway 4-22. As of November 2019, Cypress Soaring has seven sailplanes and a Cessna 182, used for aerotowing, based at Hemet-Ryan Airport. Ryan Air Attack S-2 Tankers reloading at Hemet-Ryan during the Esperanza Fire Ryan Air Attack is a joint Air Attack / Helitack base operated by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Riverside Unit). It is one of 19 tanker bases strategically located throughout California. The base provides initial attack aircraft service to over of private, state, and federally owned lands. Up until 1998, Ryan was statistically the busiest air tanker base in the United States, delivering an average of 1.5 million gallons of retardant annually. Currently two S-2 Trackers, an OV-10 and a UH-1H are stationed at the base. The base has served as the primary air attack base for many wildfires, including the Old Fire and Cedar Fire in 2003 and the Esperanza Fire in 2006. History of Ryan Air Attack  The United States Forest Service commenced air tanker loading operations in 1957, and in 1959 California Division of Forestry (now Cal Fire) began their operation at Ryan field. Both agencies maintained separate parking, loading and mixing areas but the initial stages of a joint base operation had begun. In 1969, the United States Forest Service (USFS) and the California Division of Forestry (CDF) truly merged into a joint agency air attack base sharing the base operation, responsibilities and facilities. The joint base concept successfully continued operation until 1998 when the USFS moved their air tanker base operations to the larger and recently vacated Norton Air Force Base. From the beginning of Ryan Air Attack Base, Cal Fire and the USFS used privately owned contracted World War II vintage aircraft. The type and sizes of aircraft varied based on vendor, availability of flyable airframes and spare parts. As the years counted off and the flight hours increased these airplanes became static museum displays or were robbed for parts to keep the dwindling fleet flying. Because of the dwindling air tanker fleet, Cal Fire acquired excess U.S. Navy Grumman S-2A submarine hunting aircraft. These planes were converted from military use to firefighting aircraft using a design developed by Hemet Valley Flying Service. The first two aircraft build-ups were completed by Hemet Valley Flying Service and tested at Ryan Air Attack Base. The basic aircraft design has been in continuous state service since 1975. In 1977 Cal Fire began a two-week pilot helitack program using a contracted helicopter. Headed up by Captain Emil Derdowski and two firefighters, the program was eventually extended to a total of four weeks. The success of this pilot program brought on line the Hemet- Ryan Helitack Base using a full-time contract helicopter staffed with three captains and nine firefighters operating out of Ryan Air Attack Base. In 1992 Cal Fire acquired several larger Bell UH-1H helicopters with Hemet-Ryan Helitack receiving one of the first buildups. A year later, the OV-10 replaced the Cessna 337 as Air Attack 310 based at Ryan. In June 2001, Cal Fire replaced the older S-2As at Ryan with Tanker 72 and 73. The new tankers are S-2F3AT Turbine Tanker conversions with upgrades including constant flow 1200 gallon tanks and turbine engines allowing for better capabilities and performance.  Future of Ryan Air Attack  In June 2007 The Hemet-Ryan Airport was approved $2.5 million from the Riverside County Board of Supervisors and over $25 million from the state for the redevelopment of the air-attack facilities. The upgrades would include extending the runway from to to accommodate heavier firefighting aircraft such as the MAFFS C-130. The runway expansion would take place on the southwest portion of the complex and require re-alignment of bordering Stetson Avenue and Warren Road. The new base would also include a , 22-bed barracks building, a three-bay vehicle storage facility and shop; a , two-story operations building containing pilot facilities, administration and dispatch center; a , two-bay open-shade canopy and an helicopter/ OV-10 enclosed hangar. Also planned are new public and secured staff parking areas, six fire-retardant loading pits to handle inter- agency aircraft, along with equipment tanks, pumps and piping used to mix and deliver fire retardant. Because of critical need, the strategic location of the base and proven performance and handling of large wildfires, Cal Fire and the state consider the project top priority in the list of firefighting capital improvements. Construction was to begin in 2008, but as of 2010, Cal Fire is still waiting for the promised state funds. Meanwhile, Cal Fire has been drawing plans and preparing to open the project to contractor bidding, and the Riverside County Economic Development Agency has agreed to manage the project. Facilities Apart from hosting Cal Fire air attack operations, the Hemet-Ryan is also home to a Riverside County Sheriff's Department aviation unit. In August 2010 the airport became home to an emergency medical helicopter operated by Mercy Air. The airport also hosts a biennial air show with the next one being in 2011. In 2008 the airport had 75,444 general aviation aircraft operations, average 206 per day. 236 aircraft were then based at the airport: 48% single-engine, 9% multi-engine, <1% jet, 4% helicopter, 36% glider and 2% ultralight.

Ever since 1888 when he was identified as its anonymous author, he is best known for his satirical homosexual text, L'Alcibiade, fanciullo a scola, written in 1630 and published in 1652. The work was immediately suppressed, and only ten copies survived the attempts to destroy the whole print run. The survival of the work led to, in 1862, to its translation and publishing in Italian. Again the work elicited immediate condemnation. It was denounced by the police as a liber spurcissimus (a most filthy book) and largely destroyed.

The college comprises 69 departments and occupies an area of . It has two local centres in Ashby and Barton. College funding decisions are made by the Yorkshire and the Humber Learning and Skills Council in Bradford. History The college was established in 1953 as North Lindsey Technical College. Its main building opened in 1964. In 1971 the college became the North Lindsey College of Technology - at that time it was run by Lindsey Education Committee (based in Lincoln). Humberside Education Committee in Beverley took over the administration of the college in 1974. At that stage it had five departments: * Business and Management Studies * Construction * Engineering * General Studies * Science and Metallurgy * Mathematics and Computing A college library was built in 1978, and a refectory in 1980. An art and design department opened in 1987. In 1989 it became North Lindsey College. The college logo was designed by local graphic designer and tutor in the art and design department Carole Van Hoffelen and featured a framed 'S' made from 5 parallel lines, symbolic of the local steelworks. In 2003 the college began producing a newsletter called Clippings, which publishes around 2-3 times year. In May 2010, an atrium was constructed at the front of the main entrance of the main building, and was opened in September 2010. During August 2010, the oldest building on the college campus was demolished. In September 2016, student lanyards were introduced to improve safety to all persons on campus. Courses Courses range from basic GCSE to Higher National Diploma to Animal Management, and include National Vocational Qualification courses on the Train to Gain scheme. They also offer BA (Hons) degrees.

This superfamily is a very large group of marine mollusks, estimated at about 340 recent valid genera and subgenera, and considered by one authority to contain 4,000 named living species. This superfamily includes the turrids, the terebras (also known as auger snails or auger shells) and the cones or cone snails. The phylogenetic relationships within this superfamily are poorly established. Several families (especially the Turridae), subfamilies and genera are thought to be polyphyletic. In contrast to Puillandre's estimate, Bandyopadhyay et al. (2008) estimated that the superfamily Conoidea contains about 10,000 species. Tucker (2004) even speaks of 11,350 species in the group of taxa commonly referred to as turrids.Tucker, J.K. 2004 Catalog of recent and fossil turrids (Mollusca: Gastropoda). Zootaxa 682:1–1295. 3000 recent taxa are potentially valid species. Little more than half of the known taxa are fossil species. Many species are little known and need more investigation to find their exact systematic place. Most species in this superfamily are small to medium, with shell lengths between 3 mm and 50 mm. They occur in diverse marine habitats from tropical waters to the poles, in shallow or deep waters, and on hard to soft substrates. The superfamily is known for its toxoglossan radula, which is used to inject powerful neurotoxins into its prey. This makes these species powerful carnivorous predators on annelid, other mollusc and even fish. Within the superfamily there are four somewhat different varieties of radula. The radula types are as follows: * Type 1 Drilliidae type: five teeth in each row with comb-like lateral teeth and flat-pointed marginal teeth * Type 2 Turridae s.l. type: two or three teeth in a row with the marginal teeth being of the duplex or wishbone form. * Type 3 Pseudomelatomidae type: two or three teeth in a row with curved and solid marginal teeth. * Type 4 hypodermic type: two hollow, enrolled, marginal teeth in each row with an absent or reduced radular membrane. In 2009, a proposed new classification of this superfamily was published by John K. Tucker and Manuel J. Tenorio. In 2011, a new classification of this superfamily was published by Bouchet et al. Both classifications were based upon cladistical analyses and included modern taxonomic molecular phylogeny studies.

Tucker and Manuel J. Tenorio proposed a classification system for the cone shells and their allies (which resorb their inner walls during growth) based upon a cladistical analysis of anatomical characters including the radular tooth, the morphology (i.e. shell characters), as well as an analysis of prior molecular phylogeny studies, all of which were used to construct phylogenetic trees.Tucker J.K. & Tenorio M.J. (2009) Systematic classification of Recent and fossil conoidean gastropods. Hackenheim: Conchbooks. 296 pp., at p. 133 In their phylogeny, Tucker and Tenorio noted the close relationship of the cone species within the various clades, corresponding to their proposed families and genera; this also corresponded to the results of prior molecular studies by Puillandre et al. and others.P.K.

This 2009 proposed classification system also outlined the taxonomy for the other clades of Conoidean gastropods (that do not resorb their inner walls), also based upon morphological, anatomical, and molecular studies, and removes the turrid snails (which are a distinct large and diverse group) from the cone snails and creates a number of new families. For Tucker and Tenorio’s classification system for the cone shells and their allies (and the other clades of Conoidean gastropods) see Tucker & Tenorio cone snail taxonomy 2009. 2011 taxonomy The original classification, Taylor et al. 1993 (and Bouchet & Rocroi in 2005) was thoroughly changed by the publication in 2011 of the article. The authors presented a new classification of the Conoidea on the genus level, based on anatomical characters but also on the molecular phylogeny as presented by Puillandre N., et al., 2008. They recognize fifteen families: Conidae, Terebridae, and the polyphyletic family Turridae resolved into 13 monophyletic families (containing 358 currently recognized genera and subgenera). The authors follow tentatively the classification for the family Conidae as presented by Tucker & Tenorio, 2009 who divided the monogeneric family Conidae into 82 genera. However, there is no final opinion on this issue yet, as a new molecular phylogeny of the Conidae is in preparation. There are a number of genera within the Conoidea that could not be assigned to any family. In 2012, a new lineage in the Conoidea was revealed, leading to the creation of a new family Bouchetispiridae Kantor, Strong & Puillandre, 2012 that includes one genus Bouchetispira Kantor, Strong & Puillandre, 2012 and one species Bouchetispira vitrea Kantor, Strong & Puillandre, 2012, which was found on an isolated sea mount off New Caledonia.

It was founded by Carl Friden in San Leandro, California, in 1934. History Friden Calculator Friden Flexowriter In 1957, Friden purchased the Commercial Controls Corporation of Rochester, New York. This gave them the Flexowriter teleprinter, an electric typewriter capable of being used as part of unit record equipment developed in World War II for the Department of the Navy to automatically type \\"regret to inform you\\" letters to the survivors of fallen servicemen, the predecessor to modern computers. The Flexowriter could be attached to Friden calculators and driven by paper tape to produce bills and other form letters which had names of customers and amounts of bills filled in automatically. Friden eventually expanded into production of a few models of early transistorized computers. Friden introduced the first fully transistorized desktop electronic calculator, the model EC-130 in June 1963, designed by Robert \\"Bob\\" Appleby Ragen. This machine had a 13-digit capacity and a 5-inch CRT display. It used a magnetostrictive delay line memory, to save money on expensive transistors. The EC-130 sold for $2,200 (), or about three times the price of comparable electromechanical calculators of the time. It was the first calculator to use reverse Polish notation (RPN), which eliminated the need for parentheses to specify the order of operations in complex calculations. The successor model EC-132, introduced in April 1965, added a square root function.

The pupillary membrane in mammals exists in the fetus as a source of blood supply for the lens. It normally atrophies from the time of birth to the age of four to eight weeks. PPM occurs when this atrophy is incomplete. It generally does not cause any symptoms. The strands can connect to the cornea or lens, but most commonly to other parts of the iris. Attachment to the cornea can cause small corneal opacities, while attachment to the lens can cause small cataracts. Using topical atropine to dilate the pupil may help break down PPMs. In dogs, PPM is inherited in the Basenji but can occur in other breeds such as the Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Chow Chow, Mastiff, and English Cocker Spaniel. It is also rarely seen in cats, horses, and cattle.

Lasell offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in the liberal arts, sciences, and professional fields of study. History Lasell University Logo Lasell was founded in 1851 as the Auburndale Female Seminary by Williams College Professor of Chemistry, Edward Lasell, after he took a sabbatical from his job in Williamstown to teach at the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in South Hadley, where the experience inspired him to invest more personally in women's education. He died of typhoid fever during the first semester, but his school proved highly successful as a first-rate educational institution and was soon renamed Lasell Female Seminary in his memory. Its name later changed to Lasell Seminary for Young Women and, in 1874, governance was given to a board of trustees and Principal Charles C. Bragdon. Bragdon further expanded the faculty to make Lasell renowned as a more academically rigorous institution, a prestigious school with a highly scientific approach to domestic work, art, and music. As an innovative institution, known for a radical approach to women's education at the time, Lasell also administered the Harvard exams and offered law courses for women. Lasell also offered two years of standard collegiate instruction as early as 1852 and is cited as having been the \\"first successful and persistent\\" junior college in the United States. In 1932, the college changed its name to Lasell Junior College, and the school officially began offering associate degrees in 1943. In 1989, Lasell adopted a charter to become a four-year institution (it no longer offers any two-year undergraduate degrees), and began admitting male students in 1997. Lasell also began offering master's degrees in 2002. Lasell faced controversy in 2000 when seven former students sued and claimed that the nursing program, which had been discontinued in 1999, had been a sham. The following year, the college built Lasell Village, an elderly education facility in which residents paid to live and attend classes. Although the college argued that the property was in line with its non-profit mission and exempt from property taxes, the city successfully sued the college for not paying property taxes for the property. In September 2010, a settlement was also filed in Suffolk Superior Court stipulating that Lasell would have to pay $191,314 to over 1,000 students over a conflict of interest in their Financial Aid Department. The investigation was done by the office of Attorney General Martha Coakley. The college explored merging with Mount Ida College, another liberal arts institution located in Newton, in February 2018. The reasons given for the proposed merger were to help keep tuition cost as low as possible and maintaining academic quality. In 2019, the institution's application to become a university was approved by the State Board of Education and it changed its name to Lasell University. Academics Lasell has been accredited by the Commission on Institution of Higher Education (CIHE) of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) since 1932NEASC: Lasell College and offers bachelor's degrees in the liberal arts and professional disciplines. Through its \\"Connected Learning\\" program, students work on off-site projects and assignments. Lasell also offers graduate degrees in education, communication, sport management, athletic training, criminal justice, human resources, marketing, management (MS and MBA), and rehabilitation science. In 2018, U.S. News and World Report listed Lasell College among only 5 other colleges with having 100 percent of its graduating seniors participate in an internship experience. According to U.S. News and World Report, Lasell College has been ranked 9th for the category, \\"Great Schools at Great Prices\\" and ranked 25th for the \\"Best Regional College\\" in the North. Lasell ranked at 123 out of baccalaureate colleges in the United States for the Washington Monthly College Guide, ranking at number 3 specifically on \\"a combined measure of the number of staff supporting community service, relative to the total number of staff; the number of academic courses that incorporate service, relative to school size; and whether the institution provides scholarships for community service.\\" thumb Fashion program Lasell University is known for its emphasis and strength in their fashion program. Prospective students can major in Fashion Communication and Promotion, Fashion Retail & Merchandising, and Fashion Design & Production. The university is one of the few colleges that allow Freshmen, Sophomores, and Juniors to showcase their garments in the annual undergraduate fashion show in the Spring. Seniors show their final collections on a separate day and showcase eight looks that walk down the runway. The fashion shows are orchestrated by the other fashion students through weekly workshops and back to stage communication.  Lasell Works  Lasell Works is a professionally focused, cost savings undergraduate program created by Lasell University to help lower the burden of higher education tuition. Students enrolled in the program spend their sophomore year living off-campus, taking all of their classes online and working in a part-time job with ongoing mentor support. The program's declining tuition rate offers $22,000 in cost-savings before financial aid is applied (as of 2019 rates). thumb Campus The Lasell campus covers roughly 54 acres in the Newton, Massachusetts, village of Auburndale, adjacent to the Lasell Neighborhood Historic District. There are approximately 58 buildings, 27 of which are student dormitories. Dormitories include 33 Victorian-era homes (built between 1837 and 1901), suite-style residence halls, and contemporary quad-style halls. The college opened its Science and Technology Center (STC) in the fall of 2017. It covers 47,000 square feet of space and includes seven labs designed for anatomy and physiology, chemistry, physics, exercise science, and math. Lasell's campus includes a day-care facility (the Barn), Rockwell Preschool, and Lasell Village - a senior living community focused on lifelong learning designated as an Age-Friendly University (AFU). The campus is located about half a mile from the Auburndale Commuter Rail station on the Framingham/Worcester Line, and about one mile away from the Riverside MBTA Station on the Green Line's D train, which takes commuters into the downtown Boston area. A shuttle runs regularly between the campus and Riverside Station. Student life Of the 1,600 students who attend Lasell, 73% live on campus, 40% come from out-of-state (undergraduate students), and 22% are students of color. Roughly 36% of students at Lasell are male. Athletics Lasell University is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division III athletics. The Lasell Lasers compete as members of Eastern College Athletic Conference, the North Atlantic Conference, and the Great Northeast Athletic Conferences in baseball, basketball, volleyball, soccer, cross-country, field hockey, softball, lacrosse, and track and field as inter varsity sports. In 2009, a mascot was introduced: Boomer the Torchbearer, named for the industrialists who sponsored Lasell's founding. Additionally, the school has a popular women's and men's rugby club, and has intramural sports such as flag football in the fall, as well as basketball in the winter. Organizations The student newspaper is called the 1851 Chronicle in reference to Lasell's founding year, and the student yearbook is called the Lamp. Polished Magazine is made by Lasell students/ A student-run online college radio station began operation in the fall of 2004; in 2016, the radio station began broadcasting on FM as WLAS-LP (102.9). There are social justice, service-oriented, religious, and multicultural organizations: Umoja Step Team, Fashion and Service Society, Hope for Humanity, Hillel Club, Multicultural Student Union, Niños de Veracruz, Students Against Drunk Driving, and Students Advocating For Equality.

Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, a single agency, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, had responsibility for the development and production of nuclear weapons and for both the development and the safety regulation of the civilian uses of nuclear materials. The Act of 1974 split these functions, assigning to the Energy Research and Development Administration (now the United States Department of Energy) the responsibility for the development and production of nuclear weapons, promotion of nuclear power, and other energy-related work, and assigning to the NRC the regulatory work, which does not include regulation of defense nuclear facilities. The Act of 1974 gave the Commission its collegial structure and established its major offices. A later amendment to the Act also provided protections for employees, whistleblowers, who raise nuclear safety concerns. Whistleblowers who believe they suffered retaliation for their protected activities have to file a written complaint with the United States Department of Labor (DOL) within 180 days of the first notice of the adverse action. The whistleblowers would later have a choice to have their claim heard by a DOL administrative law judge or to file a lawsuit in court and seek a trial to a judge or jury.

A company biography of Carl Friden from the 1960s or before stated that he was born Carl Bengtsson, but later took Fridén as his surname. In 1912, he graduated as a mechanical engineer from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Friden became a mechanical engineer representing the Swedish Match Trust. In 1913, Friden traveled to in London, England, to assemble match machines for his company. In 1914, he traveled to Australia with the same purpose in mind, but was stranded there when World War I broke out. In the interim he worked on his ideas for designing a more reliable calculator. Two years later he headed to San Francisco on an American steamer to get part way home, but that is where he stayed. He found his place in the Marchant Calculating Machine Co. of Oakland within a year. When the U.S. Government made Marchant discontinue its current model because it violated some German patents, Carl Friden filled the void with his own model.Calculator's Calculations (Time Magazine. Oct. 25, 1943) Friden became the chief designer of the Marchant Calculating Machine Company. While there he introduced his new design which reduced the number of calculator parts by one- third, thus increasing their reliability. Friden continued to develop the modified-pinwheel machines at Marchant during the 1920s. His machines were robust and quickly became popular. Friden Calculating Machine Company  Carl Friden left the Marchant Calculating Machine Company during the Great Depression in 1934 to establish his own calculator company at San Leandro, California. Four investors came to the firm's aid with funds to add to Carl Friden's limited finances. These investors were Walter S. Johnson and his brother-in-law Charles T. Gruenhagen (1885–1968), both executives with the American Forest Products Corporation, together with their associates, J. B. Lewis of the American Box Company and C. A. Webster of the Stockton Box Company. Both companies were affiliated with American Forest Products Corporation.Walter S. Johnson (The Walter S. Johnson Foundation) Carl Friden already had a number of patents to his credit, including an early calculating machine. Friden's company introduced a calculator that included a square root function in 1952, then went on in 1963 to introduce the model EC-130, the fully transistorized electronic calculator. In 1963 the company was purchased by the Singer Corporation.A Tribute to Carl Friden (The Friden web site) Personal Friden married Hildur Victoria Svenson in 1914 in Stockholm, Sweden. They had two children, Stanley Mauritz Victor Friden (1917) and Barbro Friden. Carl married his second wife Emita Alatorre in 1940 and had two children: Eric Donald Friden (1941) and Linda Marlice Friden (1943). They lived together in Pleasanton, California at their ranch Calmita Acres where they entertained celebrities including Jack London, Ernest Lawrence, Robert Oppenheimer as well as various Scandinavian dignitaries. Carl Friden was the first President of the Swedish Club of San Francisco and was instrumental in founding the Department of Scandinavian at the University of California, Berkeley. The Order of Vasa was conferred upon Carl Friden by King Gustaf V of Sweden in recognition of his distinguished achievements in April 1945. He has been described as one of the Bay Area's most prominent Swedish-Americans and is discussed in Muriel Beroza's book Golden Gate Swedes. He was a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, a Lutheran, and a Republican. Carl Friden died of cancer in 1945 and was entombed at the Chapel of the Chimes in Oakland, CA.

The paper was first published in 2004 and closed in April 2009. Circulation The newspaper claimed to have one of the largest distributions of the 'five county' newspapers, \\"eventually reaching more than 24,000 copies every week.\\" (from page 2 of the last online edition - edition 221, 15 April 2009). The paper was delivered door-to-door in Ballina, Castlebar, Westport and Claremorris and was also published online every week in PDF format. Style The newspaper formed a reputation for tackling controversial subjects using blunt language, and publishing articles criticising what it considered to be examples of corruption or malpractice in local government and other local organisations - in fact, the last online issue had an apology on the front cover relating to an earlier story (dated 30 April 2008) alleging that a local councillor acted improperly when handling planning matters relating to business premises. As might have been expected, the relationship between the Mayo Echo and the local council (Mayo County Council) was not amicable, and, in the last online edition, editor Tony Geraghty stated that there had been a three-year boycott of the paper by the Council. It is understood that the Mayo Echo was not available in the Mayo County Library and the Council operated an advertising boycott. A Mayo Echo piece which claimed that hundreds of people would be relocated from troubled housing estates in Limerick to Mayo was described as \\"off the wall\\". Lough Lannagh article, May 2008 In May 2008, the Mayo Echo published an article about alleged gay activity at a local beauty spot in the town of Castlebar. The article sparked hot debate in the local and national press, on national radio and online forums - mainly over its association of the word \\"pervert\\" with homosexuality, and the fact that photographs were printed of one person allegedly involved, with their vehicle number plate clearly visible. Tony Geraghty, editor of the Mayo Echo, objected to some comments about the original article published on the regional bulletin board at http://www.castlebar.ie/. He contacted the website requesting that the comments be removed and that an apology be published. An apology was published and the comments were removed, but new comments appeared, including one allegedly threatening to burn the Mayo Echos offices into the ground. Geraghty then issued a threat of legal action against the website and, as a result, the entire site was removed by the site managers and replaced with a commentary on the events. Geraghty then demanded a list of the names of all the site moderators and contributors, but the site managers refused this request. In quick succession, a campaign website was set up (savecastlebarie.org - no longer online), and groups were formed on Facebook and Myspace. Eventually, Geraghty dropped his threat of legal action and the full website at http://www.castlebar.ie/ returned shortly afterwards.

It is tricolor, vaguely resembling a coral snake with black and red saddling that almost looks like banding, on a yellow or cream-colored background, which can look somewhat like yellow banding. Cream-colored spots within the black saddles are a distinct characteristic of the long-nosed snake. It differs from all other harmless snakes in the United States by having undivided subcaudal scales.Schmidt KP, Davis DD (1941). Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. 365 pp. (Rhinocheilus lecontei, pp. 194-196, Figure 61 + Plate 21). They average around 30 inches (76 cm) in total length. Behavior R. lecontei is a shy, nocturnal burrowing snake. It spends most of its time buried underground. Diet The long-nosed snake feeds on lizards, amphibians, and sometimes smaller snakes and infrequently rodents. Reproduction R. lecontei is oviparous, laying clutches of 4-9 eggs in the early summer, which hatch in the late summer or early fall. Defense The long-nosed snake is not apt to bite, but will release a foul smelling musk and bloodMcCoy CJ Jr, Bianculli AV (1966). \\"Defensive behavior of Rhinocheilus lecontei \\".

Its known historical influence stretches from the peninsula of Zamboanga to the bay of Sarangani. During the era of European colonization, the Sultanate maintained friendly relations with British and Dutch traders. History During the indigenous era, there were two brothers named Mamalu and Tabunaway, who lived peacefully in Mindanao, specifically the Cotabato valley. When Shariff Kabungsuwan preached Islam in the area in the 16th century, Tabunaway converted, while Mamalu decided to hold fast to the beliefs of their elders. The brothers parted ways afterwards; Tabunaway to the lowlands and Mamalu to the mountains, but they vowed to honor their kinship, and thus an unwritten pact of peace between Muslims and indigenous peoples was forged through the two brothers.http://opinion.inquirer.net/113070/cotabato-tells-stories Shariff Mohammed Kabungsuwan of Johor introduced Islam in the area, which was earlier Hindu influenced from Srivijaya times, at the end of the 16th century and established himself as Sultan seated in Malabang-Lanao. He exiled some of his people who deviated from the Islamic faith to Cotabato. He subsequently married many local princesses of the Maguinadanao family ruling class in Dulawan and established the Sultanate of Maguindanao seated in Dulawan and virtually as Sultan of the whole island of the so-called Mindanao.\\"The Maguindanao Sultanate\\" , Moro National Liberation Front web site. \\"The Political and Religious History of the Bangsamoro People, condensed from the book Muslims in the Philippines by Dr. C. A. Majuli.\\" Retrieved January 9, 2008. The sultanate was usually centered in the valley of Cotabato. Asraf Mohamad Samalan Dipatuan Qudratullah Fahar'uddin Nasiruddin, popularly known as Qudarat and whose name as a youth was Ullah Untong, was one of the greatest known sultans who controlled Mindanao. In his island sanctuary in Sulu, he was known as Sultan Nasiruddin and was the Sultan of that island recognized by the Sulu Sultan and his grave still stands there. Abd al-Rahman, his grandson, continued increasing the Sultanate's power and influence. During the Spanish colonial period, the Sultanate of Maguindanao was able to defend its territory, preventing the Spaniards from colonising the entire Mindanao and ceding the island of Palawan to the Spanish government in 1705. The island priory ceded to him by Sulu Sultan Sahabuddin. This was to have help dissuaded Spanish encroachments into the island of Maguindanao and Sulu itself. Chinese gongs, yellow as a color of royalty and idioms originated from Chinese entered into Mindanao. Royalty was connected to yellow.http://www.royalpanji.net/flags_and_symbols_of_the_royal_sultanates_of_magui.html The color yellow was used by the Sultan in Mindanao. Chinese tableware and gongs were exported to the Moros. Merchant Chinese were tranquilly residing alongside the Moros in Maguindanao. List of Sultans of Maguindanao As to the historical records, there were 12 Sultans of Maguindanao.http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Philippines.htm 1\\\\. Sharif Muhammad Kabungsuwan According to some tradition of the Tarsilan as by decoded Dr. Sleeby and Dr. Majul, Sharif Ali Kabungsuwan was the son of Sharif Abu'Bkr- Zein Ul-Abidin, uncle of Sulu Sultan Sharif Ul-Hashim. Their ancestor Sultan Betatar of Taif Arabia was the 9th generation progeny of Hassan (son of Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad). Sharif Kabungsuwan Settled in Malabang Lanao. He met the brothers Tabunaway and Mamalu in Inawan. He converted the natives at Bpayguan but Mamalu and the native tribes he led opted not to join the mass conversion and returned to their homeland uphills in Mindanao (Saleeby). Kabungsuwan's mother was a member of the Johore royalty of Singapore. It may be speculated that he arrived on the shores of Mindanao around 1515. He was the second Makdum (Karim Ul-Makdum) who had come and reinforced Islam. He married the daughter of Tomoai Aliwya of the Maguindanao Family Dynasty. After his father in-law's death, the latter's political authority fell on Kabungsuwan who had established the Sultanate of Maguindanao as its first Sultan reigning as Sultan Aliwya. shariff Kabunsuan was given the authority and power to lead by Rajah Tabunaway and apo Mamalu the son of Shariff Maradja from Johore. Rajah Tabunaway was the one who accept Kabunsuan at the river PUlangi river. 2\\\\. Sharief Maka-alang He was a son of Muhammad Kabungsuwan and surnamed “Saripada”. His mother Angintabu was a daughter of an Iranun chief from the area now known as Malabang. In 1543, during the Villalobos expedition, some Spaniards were able to go to the mouth of a big river (Pulangi) where they were informed by the inhabitants that the chief was called “Sarriparra”. This being a variation of “salipada” or “saripada”, it can be surmised that the chief was the Sharif Maka-alang; especially if it is considered that not only does a tarsila explicitly state that the Sharif had such a title but that such a title was not found among his immediate successors. 3\\\\. Datu Bangkaya He was a son of Sharif Maka-alang. In 1574, Guido de Lavezaris wrote to the Spanish King that the chief of Mindanao River wanted to become a friend of the Spaniards. In another Spanish report dated 1579, this chief is referred to as “Asulutan” (Arabic, As-sulutan) with the information that he was a father of Diman Sankay and that he had already died. This refers probably to Datu Bangkaya who by 1574 must have been reigning for some time, since in 1579, his son Dimansankay, was considered by the Spaniards to have been “an old man”. Datu Bangkaya could also have been the ruler in the Pulangi who was reported to have died in 1578. 4\\\\. Datu Dimasankay He was a son of Bangkaya. Spanish reports say that he was ruling in 1579 and that he was an old man. The leading datus of the Iranuns and Maranaos all claim descent from him. 5\\\\. Datu Salikula He was the half-brother of Dimansankay and also known as Gugu Salikula. Up to early 1597, he appeared to be a lading chief of Maguindanao, Dimansankay being dead at that time. According to tarsilas, he married a Sulu princess, and therefore he might have been the Maguindanao chief seen in Jolo in 1597 where he was supposed to have been banished for being “restless and rebellious” and who was further described as a brother-in-law of the Sulu ruler and an uncle of the Maguindanao Rajah Muda (erroneously called “King”) by the Spaniards. He was chief around 1585 to 1597. 6\\\\. Kapitan Laut Buisan He was a younger half- brother of both Dimansankay and Salikula; he was sometimes called by the title “Katchil”. His rule began around 1597 when he displaced Salikula; he controlled his nephew, the Rajah Muda, a son of Dimansankay. He must have been chief at least up to 1619, since Dutch sources mention relations with the immediate predecessor of Qudarat at this date. 7\\\\. Sultan Kudarat A son of Buisan, he was known to the Spaniards as Corralat and to some Dutch writers as Guserat. In 1619-1621, there was war between Buayan and Maguindanao, probably dynastic or a contest for primacy in the Pulangi. Qudarat must have been involved in this war for not long after a temporary reversal he appears as exercising some political power over Buayan. Furthermore, he must have consolidated his power well enough after this to enable him to attack Sarangani in 1625. He died about the end of 1671 after having ruled about half a century. His rule, with varying fortunes and at different capitals can, therefore, be fairly estimated to have taken place from 1619 to 1671. By 1645, he was already using the title of “sultan”. As a young man he was entitled “Katchil”. His great grandchildren referred to him as Nasir ud-Din. 8\\\\. Sultan Dundang Tidulay He was a son of Qudarat and there is a report that he died before his father. If he ruled at all, it must have been for a very short time. He was referred to as Saif ud-Din by his grandchildren. 9\\\\. Sultan Barahaman (Arabic, ‘Abd ur-Rahman) He was a son of Sultan Tidulay. He was also known as Minulu sa rahmatullah. His sons referred to him as Muhammad Shah. He was Almo Sobat (Arabic, Al Mu- Thabbat) to William Dampier or the Almo al Lasab Brahaman to the Spaniards. The name of his grandfather Qudarat was also used by him. He was heard of as sultan early as 1678. Information given to Dutch officials at Ternate was that he died on July 6, 1699. 10\\\\. Sultan Kahar Ud-din Kuda He was a younger brother of Barahaman and was sometimes known as Jamal ul-‘Azam. He also assumed the title of Amir ul-‘Umara as well as that of Maulana. His reign was contested by two of his nephews, the sons of Barahaman. To make more secure his authority, he asked the aid of the Sulu Sultan Shahab ud-Din who came over to Simuay where Kuda held court. A misunderstanding as well as bitterness due to a long standing feud brought about a pitched battle between the Sulus and Maguindanaos. In the struggle, the Sulu Sultan personally slew Kuda. This event took place on August 10, 1702. 11\\\\. Sultan Bayan Ul-Anwar His other regal name was Jalal ud-Din. Entitled “Dipatuan” during his lifetime, he was known after his death as Mupat Batua. He was a son of Sultan Barahaman. In 1701, he was already intriguing against his uncle the Sultan. He succeeded to the throne in 1702 and held court in Slangan but was often in Sibugay. His younger brother Ja’far Sadiq, the Rajah Muda, revolted against him but managed to keep the throne. In 1736, Anwar “abdicated” in favor of his son Tahir ud- Din Malinug (no. 13). He died around 1745. 12\\\\. Sultan Muhammad Ja’far Sadiq Manamir He was a younger brother of Sultan Bayan ul-Anwar. He was sometimes referred to as Amir ud-Din. Referred to as Maulana while alive, he was known after his death as Shahid Mupat. He contested the reign of his older brother, but he was forced to flee to Tamontaka in 1710. Dutch officials referred to him as “the young king” to distinguish him from Sultan Bayan ul Anwar. By 1725 he had assumed the title of Paduka Sri Sultan. In March 1733, his brother and nephew Malinug attacked his forces in Tamontaka. The latter caused his death in the ensuing struggle. While his brother had power along the coast, Manamir held sway over the interior. His power was recognized in Tamontaka from about 1710 to his death in March 1733. 13\\\\. Sultan Muhammad Tahir Ud-din A son of Sultan Bayan ul-Anwar, he was commonly known to the Spaniards as Dipatuan Malinug. He was also known as Muhammad Shah Amir ud-Din. In a battle in 1733, he killed his uncle Ja’far Sadiq Manamir. In 1736, his father started sharing with him the responsibilities of government. His authority was however contested by two of his cousins, sons of Manamir, forcing him to retire to the interior where he died in Buayan around 1748. 14\\\\. Sultan Muhammad Khair Ud- din He was a son of Sultan Ja’far Sadiq and was better known to Europeans as Pakir Maulana Kamsa (Arabic, Faqir Maulana Hamzah) or Amir ud-Din Hamza. He also used the name ‘Azim ud-Din and assumed the title Amir ul-Mu’minin. In 1733, after his father was slain, he began to consider himself heir to the throne and thereupon called himself “rajah muda”. The next year, he was formally invested with the duties of a sultan in the presence of the Spanish officials from Zamboanga. With some Spanish aid, he was able to consolidate his position in Tamontaka and contest the rule of his uncle Bayan ul-Anwar and later that of his cousin Malinug. But upon the latter's death around 1748, the struggle for the sultanate ceased. Pakir Maulana Kamsa emerged as paramount chief of Maguindanao. Around 1755, he started to relinquish some of his powers to his younger brother with the condition that his son, Kibad Sahriyal, would be the “Rajah Muda”. 15\\\\. Sultan Pahar Ud-din He was a younger brother of Pakir Maulan Kamsa and was known as Datu Pongloc or Panglu. He began to exercise the powers of sultan around 1755 and was in the sultan's seat in that same year when Captain Thomas Forrest paid a visit to Maguindanao. After his death he was known as Mupat Hidayat. 16\\\\. Sultan Kibad Sahriyal His more regal title was Muhammad ‘Azim ud-Din Amir ul-Umara. He was a son of Pakir Maulana Kamsa. Even before the death of his uncle the Sultan, he was already being addressed as “sultan”. He was friendly towards the Spaniards and at least twice entered into peaceful negotiations with them, namely, in 1780 and 1794. He probably governed from 1780 to 1805. 17\\\\. Sultan Kawasa Anwar Ud- din He was a son of Kibad Sahriyal and like his father was also entitled Amir ul-‘Umara. He entered into a peace treaty with the Spaniards in 1805. One of his seals carried the title of Iskandar Julkarnain. He possibly reigned from 1805 to 1830. 18\\\\. Sultan Iskandar Qudraullah Muhammad Zamal Ul-Azam He was more popularly known as Sultan Untong. He was a grandson of Kibad Sahriyal and a nephew of Sultan Kawasa. Some Spanish documents carry his name as Iskandar Qudarat Pahar-ud-Din. In 1837 and 1845, he entered into friendly treaties with the Spaniards. He died either in 1853 and 1854. 19\\\\. Sultan Muhammad Makakwa He was a grandson of Sultan Kawasa Anwar ud-Din. His rule can be estimated to have lasted from about 1854 to 1884. He died in Nuling (in the site of the old settlement of Maguindanao). 20\\\\. Sultan Mohammad Jalal Ud-din Pablu Also known as Sultan Wata, he was a son of Sultan Makakwa. His capital was at Banubu, just opposite the town of Cotabato across the Pulangi. His death took place in 1888. 21\\\\. Sultan Mangigin He was a grandson of the famous Datu Dakula of Sibugay, who in turn, was a grandson of Kibad Sahriyal (No. 16). He began his rule in 1896. From 1888 to 1896, the sultanate was vacant. This was probably due to the fact that Datu Utto (Sultan Anwar ud-Din of Buayan) wanted his brother-in-law Datu Mamaku (a son of Sultan Qudratullah Untong) to become the Sultan. The Spaniards, however, wanted the sultanate to go to one of the Sibugay datus. Around the end of 1900, Sultan Mangigin transferred his residence from Cotabato to Sibugay. In 1906, he married Rajah Putri, the widow of Datu Utto and sister of Datu Mamaku. 22\\\\. Sultan Muhammad Hijaban Iskandar Mastura Kudarat He assumed the throne upon Mangigin's death in 1926. By this time, the Sultanate assumed a very ceremonial traditional character. It continued to be the central institution for traditional and religious affairs of the Maguindanao and Iranun peoples. Pretenders As of May 2018, there are three major royal families in Maguindanao. Each having an enthroned sultan under the Sultanate of Maguindanao, Kingdom of Rajah Buayan, and Domain of Alah Valley.http://opinion.inquirer.net/113070/cotabato-tells- storieshttps://news.mb.com.ph/2017/04/03/maguindanao-royalties-to-enthrone- new-sultan-of-rajah-buayan/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/665822/moro-queens- crown-fits-3-heirs-after-more-than-century See also * List of Sunni Muslim dynasties * Sultanate of Sulu References External links *Laarhoven, Ruurdje. \\"WE ARE MANY NATIONS: THE EMERGENCE OF A MULTI-ETHNIC MAGUINDANAO SULTANATE.\\" Philippine Quarterly of Culture and Society 14, no. 1 (1986): 32-53. https://www.jstor.org/stable/29791876. *http://www.royalpanji.net/flags_and_symbols_of_the_royal_sultanates_of_magui.html *http://www.academia.edu/8670417/THE_MAGUINDANAO_SULTANATE *http://nlpdl.nlp.gov.ph:81/CC01/NLP00VM052mcd/v1/v31.pdf Category:History of Mindanao Category:Former countries in Philippine history Maguindanao Category:Muslim dynasties Category:History of Maguindanao Category:Moro people Category:Filipino royalty Category:History of the Philippines (900–1565) Category:History of the Philippines (1565–1898) Category:States and territories established in 1508 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1888 Category:1508 establishments in the Philippines Category:1888 disestablishments in the Philippines Category:1508 establishments in Asia Category:1888 disestablishments in Asia Category:Maritime Southeast Asia Category:Former countries in Indonesian history ","title":"Sultanate of Maguindanao"},{"id":"4280354","text":"UEF may refer to: * Underwater Explorers' Federation, a Hungarian diver certification organization * Unified Emulator Format * Union of European Federalists * United Earth Federation, one of the fictional factions of the video game Supreme Commander * University of Eastern Finland * Ho Chi Minh City University of Economics and Finance ","title":"UEF"},{"id":"4280380","text":"The cover of Perfect Sound Forever.

It is a spectral type B1Iab star with an apparent magnitude of 12.2. Its initial main sequence mass is calculated at 60 times the mass of our Sun, but a star of this type will have already lost a substantial fraction of that mass. It is unclear whether Sher 25 has been through a red supergiant phase or has just evolved from the main sequence, so the current mass is very uncertain. The name derives from the original cataloguing of stars in NGC 3603 by David Sher. This catalogue entry is more properly referred to as NGC 3603 Sher 25 to distinguish it from stars numbered 25 by Sher in other clusters. The same star was numbered 13 by Melnick, Tapia, and Terlevich (NGC 3603 MTT 13) and 5 in a Hubble Space Telescope survey by Moffat, Drissen, and Shara (NGC 3603 MDS 5). It is speculated that Sher 25 is near the point of going supernova, as it has recently thrown off matter in a pattern similar to that of supernova 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud, with a circumstellar ring and bipolar outflow filaments. Regular variations in the doppler shift of the star's spectral lines with a period of a few days have suggested orbital motion about a companion star, but pulsations are a more likely explanation.

After leading both UTEP and Texas A&M; to postseason appearances one year after poor seasons, Gillispie became the only college basketball coach to be in charge of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) program with the biggest turnaround in two consecutive seasons. Gillispie was known as an excellent recruiter who has managed to put together four straight top-25 recruiting classes. In his three seasons at Texas A&M;, the Aggies achieved three consecutive 20-win seasons for the first time in the program's history. Early years Gillispie was born November 7, 1959, in Abilene, Texas, the middle child and only boy among five children of Clyde, a cattle truck driver, and Winifred Gillispie. He grew up in Graford, Texas, a town of 494 people located about 65 miles west of Fort Worth. As a child, Gillispie worked as a paperboy, delivering copies of The Fort Worth Press. At Graford High School, Gillispie played point guard for the basketball team and was a standout athlete in his graduating class of 20 students. He attended Ranger College, playing basketball and baseball for them from 1978 to 1980, before transferring to Sam Houston State University to work as a student assistant for their basketball team under coach Bob Derryberry, a former classmate of Gillispie's father. Derryberry moved to Southwest Texas State University (now Texas State University–San Marcos) the following year, and Gillispie accompanied him, spending three years as a graduate assistant. Gillispie received his degree in education from Southwest Texas State in 1983. Coaching career Early positions Gillispie spent the next few years building a coaching resume, spending two years as an assistant high school basketball coach before becoming a head coach at Copperas Cove High School in 1987. From 1987 to 1993, Gillispie held three high school head coaching positions. He was nominated for Texas Association of Basketball Coaches (TABC) high school coach of the year for his 1992–1993 season with Ellison High School in Killeen, Texas, which set school records for winning percentage and points scored and ended the season ranked 4th in the state. After a year as an assistant coach at South Plains College, in 1994, Gillispie moved to Division I college basketball as an assistant coach and recruiting coordinator at Baylor University under head coach Harry Miller. Miller and Gillispie had coached against each other in the same high school district as late as two years earlier, with Miller at Temple High School. The Baylor Bears' 1996 recruiting class was ranked as high as number six in the nation. After three years at Baylor, Gillispie moved to the University of Tulsa to be an assistant coach under Bill Self. When Self moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Gillispie followed, working as an assistant there for the next two years. During those two seasons, Fighting Illini won back-to-back Big Ten Conference titles for the first time in 50 years, advancing to the Elite Eight in the 2001 NCAA Tournament and to the Sweet 16 in the 2002 NCAA Tournament. With Gillispie's assistance, Illinois landed a top 10 recruiting class in 2002. Through Gillispie's eight years as an assistant, he was a member of coaching staffs that won five conference championships in six years. As part of Bill Self's staff, he was a member of the only coaching staff in NCAA history to lead two different schools to the Elite Eight in successive seasons. UTEP Gillispie was hired as the head coach of the men's basketball team at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) in 2002. =2002–2003= In his first season as a head coach, the UTEP Miners finished a dismal 6–24. Despite the poor showing, Gillispie put his recruiting expertise to work so that his first recruiting class ranked in the top 25 in the country and included Filiberto Rivera, the 2003 National Junior College Player of the Year, and Omar Thomas, the all-time leading scorer in junior college basketball. =2003–2004= In the exhibition games preceding the 2003–04 season, Gillispie's UTEP Miners defeated the Harlem Globetrotters 89–88, after the Globetrotters had already defeated many college teams including the then-defending national champion, Syracuse Orange. It was the first defeat the Harlem Globetrotters had suffered in 289 games. Although the Miners were predicted to finish ninth in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) for the 2003–04 season, UTEP instead captured their first conference title in 12 years. The team finished 24–8 and received a bid to the 2004 NCAA Tournament. The 18-win improvement was the best in Division I basketball that season, and one of the best in Division I history. As a result of their success, the Miners built a huge home following, ranking first in the NCAA in increased attendance. After his second season with the Miners, Gillispie was named Texas coach of the Year by the TABC and was a finalist for National Coach of the Year honors. Texas A&M; After two years at UTEP, Gillispie was approached to interview for the head coach position at Texas A&M; University, vacant after the forced resignation of Melvin Watkins, whose team had gone 7–21 and failed to win a Big 12 Conference game in the 2003–04 season. Athletic Director Bill Byrne needed to revitalize the program, which had only one winning season in the previous eleven years, and desired a new head coach with the ability to \\"recruit the heck out of Texas\\". Gillispie agreed to take the job only after he was sure that the predominantly football- focused school was actually committed to winning, becoming the first native Texan to be the head basketball coach at Texas A&M; since J. B. Reid was hired in 1930. =2004–2005= Gillispie asked for a budget large enough to allow them to play confidence-building non-conference schedules, rarely venturing out of Reed Arena in the first two seasons. Using the padded non-conference schedule to their advantage, the Aggies won the first eleven games of Gillispie's debut season before finishing the season 21–10, a fourteen-game improvement over the previous season. Although the Aggies were picked to finish last in the Big 12 Conference, they finished 8–8 in conference play, winning games against the number 9 Texas Longhorns and number 25 Texas Tech Red Raiders on their way to becoming only the third college team to ever finish .500 in league play after being winless the previous season. For the first time in eleven years, the team received a postseason bid. The Aggies' two wins in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) were their first postseason wins in 23 seasons. With the best first-season record of any head basketball coach in Texas A&M; history, the Aggies had the most season wins since the 1979–80 team had won 26 games. The Aggies were named the country's most improved team, making Gillispie the only coach in history to lead the most improved team in consecutive seasons. As a result of his success, he was the consensus selection for Big 12 Conference Coach of the Year. and was selected to serve as a court coach at the 2005 USA Men's World University Games Team Trials. =2005–2006= Although the Aggies lost Antoine Wright to the NBA Draft following the 2004–05 season, the team did not suffer the predicted drop-off, and actually broke a streak of twenty-five years without being ranked in the poll. The Aggies finished the regular season with a 21–8 record, including a 10–6 conference record and a fourth-place finish in the Big 12, the best finish and most wins for Texas A&M; since the formation of the conference in 1996. For the first time since 1987, Texas A&M; received a bid to the NCAA Tournament. As a twelfth-seeded team, the Aggies upset the Big East Conference champion Syracuse Orange in the first round of the tournament but then lost in the second round to eventual Final Four participant, the LSU Tigers, by the score of 58–57 on a three-pointer that LSU made in the final seconds of the game. Following the season, Gillispie was named the Big 12 Conference Coach of the Year by several major newspapers and was named the Texas College Coach of the Year by the TABC. =2006–2007= The Aggies began the 2006–07 season deemed capable of contending with the Kansas Jayhawks for the Big 12 Conference regular-season crown and were picked to finish second in the Big 12 media and coaches' polls. In their twelfth attempt, on February 3, 2007, Texas A&M; became the first Big 12 Conference team in the South Division to beat the Jayhawks at Allen Fieldhouse, moving them into sole possession of first place in the conference standing. Less than forty-eight hours later the Aggies defeated their archrivals, then the number-25th ranked Texas Longhorns, marking their 21st straight win at home. The 2006–07 Aggies ended the regular season ranked #7 by the Associated Press and #6 in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches' poll. The Aggies have set a school record for most consecutive weeks in the top 25, reaching a school high number 6 ranking. On March 4, 2007, Gillispie was awarded his second Big 12 Conference Coach of the Year award for leading the Aggies to a 13–3 conference record and a second- place finish behind the Kansas Jayhawks. The 2006–07 post-season, the Aggies advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA tourney. Their post-season hopes ended with a one-point loss (65–64) to the Memphis Tigers at the Alamodome in San Antonio on March 22, 2007. Kentucky =Hiring= On April 5, 2007, University of Kentucky athletic director Mitch Barnhart was given permission by Texas A&M; to speak with Gillispie about the program's basketball coach opening, vacated by Tubby Smith. On April 6, 2007, the announcement was made that Gillispie had accepted the position.Brett Dawson. Gillispie wants to 'cut down some more nets' at UK\\". (April 6, 2007). The Courier-Journal (Louisville). Retrieved on April 6, 2007. He drew criticism for the way he left Texas A&M; by having alerted the Aggie players of his decision to take the Kentucky job via text message while en route to the introductory press conference in Lexington. At 12:45 p.m on April 6, 2007, Billy Gillispie was officially and formally announced as the new head coach of the University of Kentucky by UK athletic director Mitch Barnhart. He fielded questions from the media during the press conference held at UK's new practice facility, the Joe Craft Center. He expressed his excitement and joy to be not only considered for the position but to have been given the honor and the opportunity to coach what former Kentucky Wildcats head coach Rick Pitino referred to as the \\"Roman Empire\\" of college basketball. \\"I'm very, very grateful and honored to be here, but we have a lot of work to do.\\" Gillispie became only the sixth head coach in the last 76 years at the school. Gillispie signed a \\"Memorandum of Understanding\\" with Kentucky on April 6, 2007 which outlined his salary and benefits. The memo also stated that contract negotiations would be concluded with \\"every reasonable effort\\" within 60 days. Gillispie and the university never signed a formal contract.http://www.courier- journal.com/article/20090310/SPORTS03/90310045/1002/SPORTS =Recruiting= Between April 29 and May 7, 2008, Billy Gillispie made recruiting waves by snagging commitments from five players spread over five different classes, most notably the commitment on May 1 of Thousand Oaks, California 8th-grader Michael Avery. Avery, a member of the class of 2012, gave the University of Kentucky its earliest basketball commitment in the history of the program. The commitment also earned national scrutiny for Coach Gillispie and the university, but there were no violations of the NCAA recruiting rules. During his tenure at Kentucky, Gillispie snagged numerous high-profile recruits. These included three 5-star recruits according to Scout.com (Patrick Patterson, Daniel Orton & Dominique Ferguson) and five 4-star recruits (Alex Legion, DeAndre Liggins, Darius Miller, Kevin Galloway and Jon Hood).Scout.com: Men's Basketball Recruiting Legion later transferred to Illinois early in the 2007–08 season. =2007–2008= Wildcat fans packed Rupp Arena for Big Blue Madness (the first practice of the season and the program's major publicity event) to catch a glimpse of their new coach in action. In his first few months he signed two high-profile recruits, Patrick Patterson and Alex Legion. Patterson had previously been recruited by the Duke Blue Devils, Florida Gators, and Kentucky Wildcats (by former coach Tubby Smith) before signing with Gillispie. Alex Legion would transfer 6 games into his first season at Kentucky. Gillispie's first season got off to a rocky start, being routed 84–68 by unranked Gardner Webb in Rupp Arena in the second game of the season. This loss dropped the Wildcats from the AP Top 25 poll, where they did not return for the remainder of the season. The Wildcats improved their record during conference play, achieving a 12–4 record and on March 11, Gillispie was named Co-Southeastern Conference coach of the year along with Bruce Pearl of the Tennessee Volunteers. =2008–2009= On November 14, 2008 Gillispie's Kentucky team opened the 2008–09 season with another loss at home, this time to the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) Keydets, by a score of 111–103. However, on November 30, 2008, Gillispie led Kentucky to a 54–43 come from behind victory over the West Virginia Mountaineers to win the Findlay Toyota Las Vegas Invitational championship. Although his Wildcats had trailed for the entire game, Billy made halftime adjustments that stymied coach Bobby Huggins' Mountaineers, eventually allowing Kentucky to overcome a 14-point deficit well into the second half – holding the Mountaineers to only 17-second-half points. Although neither team was ranked, the win was considered an upset victory for Coach Gillispie and his Wildcats after the VMI loss and was the first in-season tournament championship win for the University of Kentucky since winning the Great Alaska Shootout in late 1996. After a 5–0 start in the SEC conference schedule, however, Gillispie's team dropped three straight games to the Ole Miss Rebels, South Carolina Gamecocks and Mississippi State Bulldogs, with the latter two losses coming at home. Some Kentucky fans vociferously booed Gillispie during the Mississippi State game. Kentucky rebounded against the Florida Gators with a 68–65 victory at home. Jodie Meeks hit a contested fade-away three-pointer with less than 5 seconds left to give Kentucky the lead. Nick Calathes had an opportunity to tie the game after being fouled with 0.6 seconds left by Kevin Galloway, but missed all three free throws (the last intentional) to seal the Wildcats' win. Kentucky also had two lopsided victories over SEC East regular season champion Tennessee. Although Gillispie continued to take the blame for the Wildcats' woes, he was also a victim of some of his youthful and inexperienced recruits' underperformance and the lack of consistent play at the point guard position. Gillispie continued to publicly encourage his players and praise their work ethic despite the team's inconsistent play during the 2008–09 season. Such encouragement manifested itself in Gillispie's public statements about his players after close losses.Patterson: One player not to blame for loss  University of Kentucky Sports News  Lexington Herald- LeaderThe Advocate-Messenger in Danville, KY – centralkynews.comhttp://www.tennessean.com/article/20090303/COLUMNIST0201/903030351/1002/SPORTS Kentucky missed the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1991, and received a 4th seed in the NIT, defeating UNLV and Creighton in the opening and second rounds before losing to the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in the quarterfinals. Kentucky finished the year with an 8–8 record in conference and 22–14 overall. The record tied for the second-most losses ever in the program's history. =Firing= Gillispie was fired as the Wildcats' head coach on March 27, 2009. Athletic director Mitch Barnhart told Gillispie that his firing was not related to on-court performance, but was due to a general feeling that Gillispie was \\"not a good fit\\" for UK. According to Barnhart, the \\"incompatibility\\" between Gillispie and UK specifically manifested itself in Gillispie's failure to sign a formal contract two years after his hiring. As mentioned above, Gillispie had coached for two years on a \\"Memorandum of Understanding,\\" not a contract; UK initially considered it the equivalent of a series of one-year contracts. UK had offered Gillispie a seven-year contract, but Gillispie had never signed it. =Lawsuit and settlement= On May 27, 2009, Gillispie filed a lawsuit against the University of Kentucky Athletic Association for breach of contract and fraud stemming from the firing. The suit was filed in Gillispie's home state of Texas, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Gillispie was seeking $6 million, the amount he claimed the university owed him on the remaining years on the deal, punitive damages, attorney fees, and a jury trial. The next day, the university filed a countersuit against Gillispie in Franklin Circuit Court in Frankfort, Kentucky's state capital. In the countersuit, UK sought a judge's order that Gillispie's memorandum of understanding was not a formal contract. On October 13, 2009, UK and Gillispie agreed to settle the dispute. Under the agreement, Gillispie got $2.98 million while UK paid over $265,000 in mediation costs. Texas Tech On March 20, 2011, Gillispie was named the 14th head coach of the Texas Tech Red Raiders. Gillispie replaced Pat Knight after Knight failed to make the NCAA tournament and compiled a 16–42 Big 12 Conference record over his three and a half seasons as head coach. Gillispie was introduced at a press conference on March 23, 2011 at the United Spirit Arena. On February 11, 2012, Gillispie won his first Big 12 game as the coach of the Red Raiders, who beat the Oklahoma Sooners, 65–47. He finished the 2011 season 8–23. In October 2011, Gillispie exceeded the 20-hour practice limit set by the NCAA. Both Gillispie and assistant coach Bubba Jennings were reprimanded by Texas Tech in January 2012. The secondary violation was reported to the NCAA, and the organization approved the self-imposed penalty of a 12-hour, 20-minute reduction in practice time. The violation was not reported to the public until September 2012, when allegations of misconduct surfaced in the media. =Allegations of player mistreatment= Before the start of the 2012–13 basketball season, allegations surfaced from former and current players accusing Gillispie of mistreatment. Fifteen players departed prematurely in the year after Gillispie arrived, a very high number for a college basketball program in a major conference. Also leaving were two strength coaches and two directors of basketball operations; some 30 persons overall. The allegations include forcing injured players to practice, keeping players Ty Nurse and Dejan Kravic in doubt about their scholarship status, and reneging on promises to potential new coaching staff hires. Shortly after the allegations were initially reported and he was due to meet with athletic director Kirby Hocutt about the allegations, Gillispie was hospitalized for six days with heart-attack like symptoms and high blood pressure after calling EMS. He left the hospital on September 6. Another call to EMS was made September 10, but did not require hospitalization. On September 11, Gillispie took an indefinite medical leave, and checked himself into the Mayo Clinic. He was treated there for 'kidney problems' and 'abnormal headaches', and told to live in a stress-free environment for 30 days. Assistant head coach Chris Walker took over the day-to-day operations of the basketball team. =Departure= On September 20, 2012, Gillispie resigned as head coach at Texas Tech, citing health concerns. His contract was honored through the end of the 2012 calendar year. Walker was named interim coach for the 2012–13 season. Ranger College In April 2015, it was announced that Gillispie would become the new basketball coach and athletic director at Ranger College, a junior college and his alma mater. After using ineligible players and other violations, his 2015–16 Ranger College men's basketball team forfeited all games from that season and were placed on probation by the NJCAA for the 2016 – 2017 season.See http://www.njcaa.org/eligibility/probation_list On December 7, 2016, Gillispie announced his immediate retirement from coaching, citing severe health issues related to his blood pressure. In May 2017, however, Gillispie returned to the sidelines at Ranger.http://www.kentucky.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/sidelines-with-john- clay/article151707537.html Tarleton State On March 30, 2020, Gillispie was named the head coach at Tarleton State, and will guide the team during its transition from Division II to Division I in the Western Athletic Conference. Personal life A February 11, 2007, The Dallas Morning News article described Gillispie as a self-professed workaholic during his time at Texas A&M.; Despite the fact that he had three assistants who watched opponents' game film and summarized it for him, he sometimes watched as many as fifteen of an opponent's games, often working as late as 2 or 3 a.m. to ensure he had adequate time to devote to the task. He stated that his eight-year marriage ended because he could not find a balance between work and home. With the sheer number of hours he spent working, Gillispie often did not have time to even shop for groceries, once going as long as six months without any food in his refrigerator. On August 27, 2009, Gillispie was arrested at 2:45 am in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky for driving under the influence. A passenger in the 2009 Mercedes Benz C300, Charles O'Connor, was arrested and charged with alcohol intoxication. According to the police report, an officer saw the vehicle swerving and stopped the driver. The officers who were at the scene smelled a strong odor of alcohol, describing Gillispie's eyes as being red and glassy, with his speech slurred. When asked about his proof of insurance, Gillispie stated that it was in a golf bag in his trunk. He then refused a blood test and a breathalyzer on the scene and was subsequently arrested and taken to the Franklin County jail. Gillispie pleaded not guilty. A judge had scheduled a trial for February 10, 2010 in the case. However, on November 2, 2009, Gillispie changed his plea to guilty under a plea agreement. He was fined $1,028 and must complete an alcohol and drug education course before his Kentucky driver's license can be renewed. He has had two prior DUI arrests, the first in 1999 when he was arrested for driving while intoxicated and improper use of a lane in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He eventually pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of reckless driving. He was arrested again in 2003 in his first year at the University of Texas at El Paso on suspicion of drunken driving, although it was later dismissed based on a lack of evidence. In September 2009, it was reported that Gillispie had entered an alcohol rehabilitation program and had checked himself into the John Lucas After Care Program in Houston.

It is known as the first appearance of the title character \\"The Mad Doctor\\", or \\"Dr. XXX\\". It was the 52nd Mickey Mouse short film, and the second of that year.  Plot  The plot centers on the title character, a mad scientist who has kidnapped Mickey's dog, Pluto. Mickey tries to rescue him before the doctor can perform his experiment: putting Pluto's head to the body of a chicken in order to see if a puppy will hatch from an egg (that is if the end result will \\"bark or crow or cackle\\"). Mickey battles his way through booby traps and animated skeletons before eventually getting caught and strapped onto a table to get cut open by a buzzsaw, forcing Mickey to suck in his belly, trembling. The scene then fades to Mickey asleep in bed and suddenly woken up by a mosquito, whose buzzing resembles the whirring of the spinning blade. Not yet realizing the events were only a nightmare, Mickey shouts for Pluto, who eagerly jumps onto Mickey's bed with his doghouse and chain still attached to collar. Allusions The short uses the same gag that appears in \\"Haunted House\\" (1929), which has the door lock itself after Mickey enters the house. Reception The short's horror overtones made it unusual for a Mickey Mouse cartoon. Some theaters refused to show it, believing it to be too scary for kids. At one time, for this reason, it was banned entirely in the United Kingdom, as well as Nazi Germany. On February 10, 1933, The Film Daily said: \\"One of the liveliest animated cartoons to come along, and plenty comical.\\" Legacy The short's title character had a cameo in the Roger Rabbit short, \\"Tummy Trouble\\", in which he was seen on a picture. The Mad Doctor was also the basis for, and title of, the second level in the video game, Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse released for the Super NES, Genesis, Sega CD and PlayStation (as Mickey's Wild Adventure); a depiction of the Mad Doctor level is used as the cover art for the game. He also appears as a major antagonist in Epic Mickey and the main antagonist in its sequel. The video game Kingdom Hearts III includes a mini game based on the short, with the Mad Doctor appearing as an enemy. Releases This cartoon is one of a few Disney shorts that lapsed into the public domain, and can be found on many low budget VHS tapes and DVDs, usually paired with \\"Minnie's Yoo Hoo\\" and \\"The Spirit of '43\\". It was also released on DVD in 2002 as part of Walt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse In Black and White.

It is located in Mendota Heights near Saint Paul. Visitation is a coeducational school for grades Montessori PreK-grade 5, and all-girls for grades 6-12. Visitation is the only all-girls secondary school in Minnesota. A brother school, Saint Thomas Academy, is located across the street and many classes and after school activities involve both schools. Depending on the sport or activity, some of its rival schools are Cretin-Derham Hall, Breck School, St. Paul Academy and Summit School, and The Blake School.  History  Visitation was founded by Sisters of the Visitation in 1873, who traveled up the Mississippi River from St. Louis, Missouri at the request of some prominent businessmen in St. Paul who wished for a strong, Catholic education for their daughters. This may have been P. F. McQuillan, whose three daughters attended the school. It was founded in St. Paul, and later moved to its current location. The current location of the school in Mendota Heights, MN, is the school's fourth location. Several peacocks have historically resided at the Mendota Heights campus. The Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary was founded in France in 1610. The founders of the order are St. Francis de Sales and St. Jane de Chantal from whom the order gained its Salesian spirituality. There are sister school locations in St. Louis, MO and Washington, D.C., as well as monasteries in other areas throughout the U.S. The school is coeducational from preschool through grade 5, but becomes single-gender in sixth grade. Prior to the 2017-18 school year, it was co-ed from preschool to sixth grade, and all-girls from seventh grade onwards. To coincide with this change, Saint Thomas Academy added its inaugural (all-boys) sixth grade. Visitation is the only all-girls Catholic secondary school in Minnesota. The first graduating class at Visitation had only four members; the class of 2019 is made up of 77 young women.  Athletics  Visitation offers 13 varsity sports: *Softball *Track & Field *Lacrosse *Golf *Swimming and Diving *Basketball *Ice Hockey *Nordic Skiing *Alpine Skiing *Volleyball *Soccer *Tennis *Cross Country  VISTA Productions  VISTA Productions is the combined theater troupe of The Convent of the Visitation School and Saint Thomas Academy. They put on three main productions a year, including a fall drama, a winter dance piece/improv show and a spring musical. VISTA Productions also is a participant in the Spotlight Program, a High School Theater Recognition Program sponsored by the Hennepin Theater Trust. In the spring of 2014, VISTA Productions received ten awards from this program including the award for Outstanding Overall Production of a Musical for their production of Shrek the Musical. The next year, their production of \\"The Drowsy Chaperone\\" also received numerous awards from Spotlight, once again including \\"Outstanding Overall Production of a Musical\\" and \\"Outstanding Overall Performance of a Musical.\\"  References  External links *Visitation's Official Website *The Robette's Official Web Page Notes and references Category:Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis Category:Visitation schools Category:Educational institutions established in 1873 Category:Private middle schools in Minnesota Category:Private elementary schools in Minnesota Category:Catholic secondary schools in Minnesota Category:Girls' schools in Minnesota Category:Schools in Dakota County, Minnesota Category:1873 establishments in Minnesota ","title":"Convent of the Visitation School"},{"id":"4280514","text":"The Big Brute was one of NCR's oldest model rockets. North Coast Rocketry was a model rocket company founded in Ohio by Chris Pearson and Matt Steele, with Dan Kafun added as a partner in 1989. History North Coast Rocketry (NCR) had their own line of unique High Power rockets and introduced some technologies and designs that were \\"cutting edge\\" for their time. To augment their product line, NCR was also a dealer for Class \\"C\\" Aerotech motors and Class \\"B\\" Vulcan motors in the mid to late 1980s. NCR sold a limited selection of disposable motors in 1984 that were called \\"North Coasters\\". The North Coaster motors were manufactured by Aerotech under a special agreement with NCR, who had sole distribution rights. The motors were shipped to North Coast Rocketry near Cleveland, Ohio, with no end caps or labels, and final processing was conducted by North Coast Rocketry. The North Coasters motor line consisted of the E28 (24mm), F41 (24mm) and G60 (29mm) motors. They were phased out late in 1987 due to supply issues. North Coast planned to make reloadable motors, and a few prototype cases were made, but the propellant shipping issues of the early 1990s stopped their development. NCR reloadable motor design was said to be so simple, using color-coded parts, that assembly could be done by someone who knew nothing about rockets and who hadn't read one word of the instructions. The reloadable motor technology was never actually put into production. North Coast Rocketry was moved to Colorado and Utah in the early 1990s. During this time, NCR branched out into making composite motors based on potassium perchlorate that would produce a pink flame during the burn. North Coast Rocketry was subsequently purchased by Estes Industries' around 1995-1996 and served as Estes' mid/high power model rocketry division. The NCR motor technology was changed by Estes to the more industry-standard ammonium-perchlorate-based composite propellant. All Estes versions of the NCR models used DarkStar motors, which emitted a dark black smoke trail. These motors were made specifically for NCR rockets and were slightly smaller in diameter than their competitor's motors. The motor was unique in that it had a molded aft thrust ring on the motor. Estes discontinued the NCR line of rockets and other products in 2000. Since the brand has been discontinued, most people modify the motor mounts to use industry-standard 29 mm size motors. NCR also sold a heavy duty launch pad and controller for their rockets. At NARAM-53 (the National Association of Rocketry's Annual Meet) in Cincinnati in July 2011, Matt Steele (one of the principals of the former North Coast Rocketry) announced that he had sufficient rights to the name and products and that he and his daughter would be bringing the company back to life with a website going live on October 1, 2011. He said the initial kits would be based on 2.6\\" tubing, and would not be \\"three fins and a nose cone\\".

Although the term \\"circumventricular organs\\" was originally proposed in 1958 by Austrian anatomist Helmut O. Hofer concerning structures around the brain ventricular system, the penetration of blood-borne dyes into small specific CVO regions was discovered in the early 20th century. The permeable CVOs enabling rapid neurohumoral exchange include the subfornical organ (SFO), the area postrema (AP), the vascular organ of lamina terminalis (VOLT), the median eminence, the pituitary neural lobe, and the pineal gland. The circumventricular organs are midline structures around the third and fourth ventricles that are in contact with blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and they facilitate special types of communication between the central nervous system and peripheral blood. Additionally, they are an integral part of neuroendocrine function. Highly permeable capillaries allow the CVOs to act as an alternative route for peptides and hormones in the neural tissue to sample from and secrete to circulating blood. CVOs also have roles in body fluid regulation, cardiovascular functions, immune responses, thirst, feeding behavior and reproductive behavior. CVOs can be classified as either sensory or secretory organs serving homeostatic functions and body water balance. The sensory organs include the area postrema, the subfornical organ, and the vascular organ of lamina terminalis, all having the ability to sense signals in blood, then pass that information neurally to other brain regions. Through their neural circuitry, they provide direct information to the autonomic nervous system from the systemic circulation. The secretory organs include the subcommissural organ (SCO), the pituitary gland, the median eminence, and the pineal gland. These organs are responsible for secreting hormones and glycoproteins into the peripheral blood using feedback from both the brain environment and external stimuli. Circumventricular organs contain capillary networks that vary between one another and within individual organs both in density and permeability, with most CVO capillaries having a permeable endothelial cell layer, except for those in the subcommissural organ. Furthermore, all CVOs contain neural tissue, enabling a neuroendocrine role. Although the choroid plexus also has permeable capillaries, it does not contain neural tissue; rather, its primary role is to produce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and therefore is typically not classified as a CVO. Sensory organs Area postrema =Anatomy= The area postrema is located in the caudal medulla oblongata near the junction of the brainstem and the spinal cord. In humans and in most other mammals that have been studied, it consists of swellings on either wall of the fourth ventricle. In rodents and lagomorphs, however, the area postrema forms a midline structure dorsal to the obex. When viewed histologically for its capillary distribution and morphology, the area postrema has numerous subregions separated according to capillary permeability, rates of blood flow, and duration of blood transit through respective capillary beds. =Function= Relatively little is known about the function of the area postrema in humans. However, there is strong evidence that the area postrema acts as the chemoreceptor trigger zone for vomiting, which is triggered by the presence of noxious stimulation from the blood. There is also evidence that the area postrema is the site at which angiotensin stimulates glucose metabolism, presumed efferent neural activity, blood pressure control, and thirst. The area postrema also has integrative capacities that enable it to send major and minor efferents to sections of the brain involved in the autonomic control of cardiovascular and respiratory activities. Vascular organ of the lamina terminalis =Anatomy= Classified as a sensory circumventricular organ (along with the SFO and AP), the vascular organ of lamina terminalis (VOLT) is situated in the anterior wall of the third ventricle. Characteristically of the CVOs, it lacks the tight endothelial blood brain barrier. The vascular organ is further characterized by the afferent inputs from the subfornical organ (SFO), the median pre-optic nucleus (MnPO) region, the brainstem, and even the hypothalamus. Conversely, the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis maintains efferent projections to the stria medullaris and basal ganglia. As a major player in the maintenance of the mammalian body fluid homeostasis, the VOLT features the primary neurons responsible for osmosensory balance. These neurons, in turn, feature angiotensin type I receptors, which are used by circulating angiotensin II to initiate water intake and sodium consumption. In addition to the angiotensin receptors, the neurons of the VOLT are also characterized by the presence of a nonselective cation channel deemed the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, or TRPV1. Though there are other receptors within the TRPV family, a study by Ciura, Liedtke, and Bourque demonstrated that hypertonicity sensing operated via a mechanical mechanism of TRPV1 but not TRPV4. Despite a significant amount of data, the anatomy of the VOLT is not yet fully comprehended. =Function= As previously mentioned, the vascular organ of lamina terminalis features neurons responsible for the homeostatic conservation of osmolarity. In addition, the fenestrated vasculature of the VOLT allows the astrocytes and neurons of the VOLT to perceive a wide variety of plasma molecules whose signals may be transduced into other regions of the brain, thereby eliciting autonomic and inflammatory reactions. In experiments, mammalian VOLT neurons were shown to transduce hypertonicity by the activation of the TRPV1 nonselective cation channels. These channels are highly permeable to calcium and are responsible for membrane depolarization and increased action potential discharge. Stated simply, an increase in osmolarity results in a reversible depolarization of the VOLT neurons. This can be seen through the predominantly excitatory effects of ANG on the VOLT through the TRPV1 receptor. In this context, it is worthy to note the VOLT neurons typically feature a resting membrane potential in the range of -50 to -67 mV with input resistances ranging from 65 to 360 MΩ. Despite a solid understanding of the VOLT’s role in the maintenance of body fluid homeostasis, other functions are less understood. For example, it is thought that the VOLT may also play a role in the regulation of LH secretion via a negative feedback mechanism. It is also hypothesized that the VOLT may be the mechanism through which pyrogens function to initiate a febrile response in the CNS. Finally, VOLT neurons have been observed to respond to temperature changes indicating that the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis is subject to different climates. Subfornical organ (SFO) =Anatomy= The subfornical organ is a sensory CVO situated on the underside of the fornix and lacking a BBB, the absence of which characterizes the circumventricular organs. Protruding into the third ventricle of the brain, the highly vascularized SFO can be divided into 3-4 anatomical zones, especially by its capillary density and structure. The central zone is composed exclusively of the glial cells and neuronal cell bodies. Conversely, the rostral and caudal areas are mostly made of nerve fibers while very few neurons and glial cells can be seen in this area. Functionally, however, the SFO may be viewed in two portions, the dorsolateral peripheral (pSFO) division and the ventromedial core segment. As an important mechanism of both energy and osmotic homeostasis, the SFO has many efferent projections. In fact, SFO neurons have been experimentally shown to broadcast efferent projections to regions involved in cardiovascular regulation including the lateral hypothalamus with fibers terminating in the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei, and the anteroventral 3rd ventricle (AV3V) with fibers terminating in the VOLT and the median preoptic area. It seems that the most essential of all these connections is the SFO’s projections to the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus. Based on their functional relevance, the SFO neurons can be branded as either GE, featuring nonselective cation channels, or GI, featuring potassium channels. While the afferent projections of the SFO are considered less important than the various efferent connections, it is still notable that the subfornical organ receives synaptic input from the zona incerta and arcuate nucleus. Study of subfornical organ anatomy is still ongoing but evidence has demonstrated slow blood transit time which may facilitate the sensory capability of SFO, enabling increased contact time for blood-borne signals to penetrate its permeable capillaries and influence regulation of blood pressure and body fluids. This observation coincides with the fact that SFO neurons have been shown to be intrinsically osmosensitive. Finally, it has been established that SFO neurons maintain resting membrane potential in the range of -57 to -65 mV. =Function= The subfornical organ is active in many bodily processes including, but not limited to, osmoregulation, cardiovascular regulation, and energy homeostasis. In a study by Ferguson, both hyper- and hypotonic stimuli facilitated an osmotic response. This observation demonstrated the fact that the SFO is involved in the maintenance of blood pressure. Featuring an AT1 receptor for ANG, the SFO neurons demonstrate an excitatory response when activated by ANG, therefore increasing blood pressure. The induction of the drinking response via the SFO can be antagonized, however, by the peptide, ANP. Additional research has demonstrated that the subfornical organ may be an important intermediary though which leptin acts to maintain blood pressure within normal physiological limits via descending autonomic pathways associated with cardiovascular control. Recent research has focused on the subfornical organ as an area particularly important in the regulation of energy. The observation that subfornical neurons respond to a wide range of circulating energy balance signals, and that electrical stimulation of the SFO in rats resulted in food intake supports the SFO’s importance in energy homeostasis. Additionally, it is assumed that the SFO is the lone forebrain structure capable of constant monitoring of circulating concentrations of glucose. This responsiveness to glucose again serves to solidify the SFO’s integral role as a regulator of energy homeostasis. Secretory organs Subcommissural organ =Anatomy= The subcommissural organ (SCO) is a small secretory organ located on the ventral surface of the posterior commissure near the anterior entrance of the cerebral aqueduct. It differs from other CVOs in that it lacks a high concentration of fenestrated capillaries, making its BBB less permeable. On the other hand, its role as a neuroendocrine structure associated with the ventricular system qualifies it for classification as a CVO. Related to its secretory function, the SCO is partially composed of ependymal cells. These ependymocytes are characterized by elongated cell bodies that contain secretory materials and are covered in cilia. The most prominent of these is the glycoprotein SCO-spondin. =Function= The main function of the SCO is the secretion of the glycoprotein SCO-spondin, which is released into the third ventricle where it aggregates to create Reissner's fiber (RF). Reissner's fiber is a long fibrous projection that travels caudally through the Sylvian aqueduct and terminates in the spinal cord. This fiber is thought to contribute to the maintenance of the patency of the sylvian aqueduct. While the function of the subcommissural organ is still under investigation, it has been hypothesized that it is also part of the mechanism of aldosterone secretion and CSF detoxification, along with osmoregulation. The SCO is innervated by many systems, the most common of which is associated with the serotonergic system. The serotonergic system influences water and sodium intake. During water deprivation it will also reduce its innervation to the SCO. The reduction of input to the SCO causes a marked decrease in RF production. This finding implies that the subcommissural organ and its associated Reissner's fiber are an integral part of fluid electrolyte balance and water homeostasis. Pituitary gland =Anatomy= The pituitary gland is subdivided into two lobes, the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary (also known as the adenohypophysis and neurohypophysis respectively).Marieb, Elaine N. Human Anatomy and Physiology. 6th ed. N.p.: Benjamin Cummings, 2003. Print. Each one functions as a separate endocrine organ, and both are circumventricular organs. The anterior pituitary contains non-neural secretory cells derived from oral ectoderm which are indirectly controlled by \\"releasing hormones\\" from the median eminence of the hypothalamus, through the hypophyseal portal circulation. The posterior pituitary consists of axonal projections that directly extend from cell bodies in the hypothalamus, through the infundibulum. It is located in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone at the base of the skull. =Function= The pituitary is sometimes referred to as the “master gland” because it has a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and guiding the activity of other glands. The anterior lobe secretes growth hormone, prolactin and tropic hormones for the thyroid, gonads and adrenal glands. The posterior lobe stores and releases oxytocin and vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which are produced in the hypothalamus. Median eminence The median eminence (ME) is located in the inferior portion of the hypothalamus and is ventral to the third ventricle. While some publications do not list the ME as a CVO, when it is considered to be a circumventricular organ, it is classified as a secretory organ. The median eminence is rich in fenestrated capillaries, allowing for the passage of proteins and neurohormones. More specifically, the median eminence allows for the transport of neurohormones between the CSF and the peripheral blood supply. The major cell type that makes up the median eminence are specialized ependymal cells known as tanycytes. These contribute to the organ's ability to selectively allow macromolecules to pass from the central to the peripheral neuroendocrine systems. Ventromedial subregions of the bilateral hypothalamic arcuate nucleus display relatively high capillary permeability, indicating this nucleus may have moment-to-moment regulatory roles for sensing and neurally conveying hormonal signals. Tanycytes line the floor of the third ventricle and can be characterized by a singular long projection that delves deep inside the hypothalamus. Tanycytes have been evolutionarily linked to radial glial cells of the central nervous system. The tanycytes of the median eminence are often found along the fenestrated peripheral capillaries. They are tightly packed on the capillaries, forming a seal between the third ventricle and the median eminence. This seal can be attributed to the tight junctions observed between tanycytes and functions to restrict the travel of molecules between the median eminence and the third ventricle. The median eminence is also closely linked to the transport of GnRH between the median eminence and the anterior pituitary. Neuronal projections of GnRH neurons actually end at the median eminence, allowing for its release into the portal blood system. Pineal gland =Anatomy= Gross anatomy The morphology of the pineal gland varies greatly among mammals. The most commonly used classification for this gland takes into account its location relative to the diencephalon and the third ventricle of the brain, as well as its size and shape. Under these conditions, the human pineal gland is classified as type A. A type A pineal gland rests proximally to the posterior section of the diencephalon. It is located within 1-2mm of the midline of the brain. The pineal gland starts to develop during the second month of gestation. In the average adult, the dimensions are as follow: 5-9mm in length, 1-5mm in width and 3-5mm in thickness. Its average weight is 100–180 mg. The pineal gland consists of a central core made up of small lobes and a cortex that possesses a diffuse distribution of neurons. The principal cell type of the pineal is the pinealocyte sensu stricto. This type of cell has a prominent nucleus and a granular appearance. Vascularization and innervation The level of vascularization in the pineal gland is high. It receives a large supply of blood from branches of the posterior choroidal arteries that derive from cerebral arteries in the posterior mesencephalon. The pineal gland is innervated by fibers from the peripheral parasympathetic and sympathetic systems, in addition to fibers from the central nervous system. The most important set of fibers involved are the unmyelinated postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical ganglia, which also form the bilateral nervi conarii. The second set of fibers enters the pineal gland anteriorly via the commissural peduncles. The third set of fibers is myelinated and forms the ventro-lateral pineal tract. =Function= The pineal gland is considered a secretory organ and its activity shows circadian oscillations. Its main function - secretion of the hormone melatonin - rests when there is no input from the primary circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nuclei. Melatonin production is controlled by the previously mentioned circadian timing and is suppressed by light. Pineal tumors can affect sexual development, but the mechanism has yet to be established. Other pineal substances Other peptides aside from melatonin have been detected in the pineal. They are most likely associated with a type of innervation deemed \\"pineal peptidergic innervation.\\" These include vasopressin, oxytocin, VIP, NPY, peptide histidine isoleucine, calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P and somatostatin.

The team occasionally ran under the name of EMKA Productions, the name of O'Rourke's management company. The team's name comes from O'Rourke's two daughters, Emma and Katheryne. O'Rourke and EMKA concentrated on sports car racing with brief interludes into British Formula One until 1985 when the team was broken up before returning again in 1991. The team was finally dissolved in early 2004 following O'Rourke's death. The team had won the drivers championship for O'Rourke and Tim Sugden in the British GT Championship in 1997 and 1998. History 1980–1985 Following Steve O'Rourke's years of amateur auto racing, he had succeeded in entering the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans where he took a respectable 12th-place finish in a Ferrari 512BB. With Pink Floyd's scheduling becoming less of a conflict, O'Rourke was able to fully concentrate on racing and formed EMKA Racing, a division of his EMKA Productions record label, for the 1980 season. Debuting at the Six Hours of Silverstone, he took a seventh-place finish before taking 23rd at Le Mans. Now established, O'Rourke purchased a BMW M1 and signed driver Derek Bell as his co-driver. Collaborating with Michael Cane Racing the team took a second- place finish at Silverstone before suffering problems at Le Mans with drivers David Hobbs and Eddie Jordan, future owner of Jordan Grand Prix. For Brands Hatch, the team took a third-place finish although O'Rourke himself did not drive the car. For 1982, Derek Bell was replaced on the team by Nick Mason, drummer for Pink Floyd, who had been participating the past few years with the Dorset Racing team. The team did not see much success. In the same year, O'Rourke and EMKA also entered the British Formula One series for two races with a Williams FW07, scoring a third place at Thruxton Circuit. For 1983, EMKA's success was recognised by Aston Martin, with the two reaching an agreement to run sportscars built by Michael Cane Racing and powered by Aston Martin engines. The first chassis, known as an EMKA C83/1, was designed by Len Bailey and used a production-based Aston Martin V8 engine as its powerplant. O'Rourke was joined in the cockpit by Tiff Needell and took 17th place at Le Mans in their debut year. For 1985 the EMKA ASTON-MARTIN was modified by Michael Cane Racing with design work being done by Richard Owen and continued support from Aston Martin. O'Rourke and Needell took an eleventh-place finish at Le Mans which saw the entry briefly leading the race in the opening hours. The EMKA Aston Martin failed to finish any of the other races it appeared at that season. Steve O'Rourke decided to take a break from international motorsport. 1991–2003 O'Rourke would briefly return to racing in 1993, entering an old Porsche 935 in the new British GT Championship. However come 1995 he would bring EMKA Racing back full-time. Initially using his 935, he later purchased a new Porsche 911 GT2, which saw an eleventh-place finish at Silverstone in the BPR Global GT Series event. Joined by Guy Holmes, he would participate in the bulk of the 1996 BPR Global GT Series season, with best finishes of 18th at both Monza and Paul Ricard. He also made his first return to Le Mans since 1985, although his car would last a mere 32 laps before retiring. For 1997, EMKA Racing would return to the British GT Championship. O'Rourke and co-driver Tim Sugden would take a best finish of second at Donington Park en route to taking the GT2 class drivers championships by the end of the season. With this success, O'Rourke made the decision to move to the more powerful GT1 class for 1998, purchasing a used McLaren F1 GTR. The team managed two wins in British GT at Oulton Park and Spa-Francorchamps, again earning them the championship in their class. The duo would also be joined by Bill Auberlen for Le Mans, earning a fourth-place finish, O'Rourke's personal best. The team continued to campaign the McLaren F1 GTR in British GT in 1999, winning the round at Silverstone. Unfortunately the team would not be able to manage to win the drivers championship, finishing fifth instead. The top GT class would be abandoned in 2000 making the team's McLaren illegal, so O'Rourke joined EMKA Racing with fellow British team GTC Competition and moved the duo to the international FIA GT Championship's lower N-GT class, running a new Porsche 911 GT3-R. The team would have a best finish of second in class at the A1-Ring and would finish fourth in the teams championship. The co- operation with GTC Competition and EMKA continued to campaign their Porsche in the N-GT class in 2001, again scoring their best result at the A1-Ring with a fourth-place finish in class. Unfortunately in the teams championship they managed to tie for eighth place, down from the previous year. The team would return again to British GT for 2002, with two third-place finishes at Brands Hatch and Castle Combe Circuit. Citing health concerns, O'Rourke would retire towards the end of the 2002 season, with Martin Short taking over O'Rourke driving position alongside Tim Sugden as the team went into 2003. The team once again switched back to the FIA GT Championship's N-GT class, but with greater success. At the third round at Pergusa, the team won the N-GT class. This led to Porsche taking interest in the team and offering factory driver Emmanuel Collard. This led to a second class win at Anderstorp, and eventually fourth place in the N-GT team championship. Demise Mere days after the end of the FIA GT season, Steven O'Rourke would pass away in the United States due to a stroke. The team, which had received strong support from Porsche for preparation for the 2004 season, was unable to survive without O'Rourke's leadership. The team would fold prior to the start of the 2004 season, with its assets being sold off, including O'Rourke's racing cars such as his McLaren F1 GTR and the EMKA-badged Group C cars. Tim Sugden would also move on to the GruppeM team.

Those who are heterozygous for the sickle cell allele produce both normal and abnormal hemoglobin (the two alleles are codominant with respect to the actual concentration of hemoglobin in the circulating cells). Sickle cell disease is a blood disorder wherein there is a single amino acid substitution in the hemoglobin protein of the red blood cells, which causes these cells to assume a sickle shape, especially when under low oxygen tension. Sickling and sickle cell disease also confer some resistance to malaria parasitization of red blood cells, so that individuals with sickle-cell trait (heterozygotes) have a selective advantage in environments where malaria is present. Symptoms Sickle cell trait is a hemoglobin genotype AS and is generally regarded as a benign condition. However, individuals with sickle cell trait may have rare complications. For example, in November 2010, Dr. Jeffery K. Taubenberger of the National Institutes of Health discovered the earliest proof of sickle-cell disease while looking for the virus of the 1918 flu during the autopsy of an African- American soldier. Taubenberger's autopsy results showed that the soldier suffered a sickle-cell crisis that contributed to his death even though he had only one copy of the gene.\\"From 1918 Autopsy, A First Glimpse of Sickle Cell — and a Warning\\" www.wired.com There have been calls to reclassify sickle cell trait as a disease state, based on its malignant clinical presentations. Significance may be greater during exercise.  Association with other medical conditions  = Malaria = The sickle cell trait provides a survival advantage against malaria fatality over people with normal hemoglobin in regions where malaria is endemic. The trait is known to cause significantly fewer deaths due to malaria, especially when Plasmodium falciparum is the causative organism. This is a prime example of natural selection, evidenced by the fact that the geographical distribution of the gene for hemoglobin S and the distribution of malaria in Africa virtually overlap. Because of the unique survival advantage, people with the trait become increasingly numerous as the number of malaria-infected people increases. Conversely, people who have normal hemoglobin tend to succumb to the complications of malaria. The way in which sickle cell protects against Malaria is attributed to several different things. One of the more common explanation is that the sickle hemoglobin inhibits the plasmodium parasite from infecting the red blood cells which reduces the number of malaria parasites to infect the host. Another factor is the production of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) enzyme, which is highly present in the sickle hemoglobin. This enzyme produces carbon monoxide which has been proven to protect against cerebral malaria.Ana Ferreira, Ivo Marguti, Ingo Bechmann, Viktória Jeney, Ângelo Chora, Nuno R. Palha, Sofia Rebelo, Annie Henri, Yves Beuzard, Miguel P. Soares. Sickle Hemoglobin Confers Tolerance to Plasmodium Infection.

An association with complicated migraines has been suggested. There have been reports of pulmonary venous thromboembolism in pregnant women with sickle cell trait, or men during prolonged airflight, and mild strokes and abnormalities on PET scans in children with the trait. Sickle cell trait appears to worsen the complications seen in diabetes mellitus type 2 (retinopathy, nephropathy and proteinuria) and provoke hyperosmolar diabetic coma nephropathy, especially in male patients. Genetics Normally, a person inherits two copies of the gene that produces beta-globin, a protein needed to produce normal hemoglobin (hemoglobin A, genotype AA). A person with sickle cell trait inherits one normal allele and one abnormal allele encoding hemoglobin S (hemoglobin genotype AS). The sickle cell trait can be used to demonstrate the concepts of co-dominance and incomplete dominance. An individual with the sickle cell trait shows incomplete dominance when the shape of the red blood cell is considered. This is because the sickling happens only at low oxygen concentrations. With regards to the actual concentration of hemoglobin in the circulating cells, the alleles demonstrate co-dominance as both 'normal' and mutant forms co-exist in the bloodstream. Unlike the sickle-cell trait, sickle-cell disease is passed on in a recessive manner. Sickle cell anemia affects about 72,000 people in the United States. Most Americans who have sickle cell anemia are of African descent. The disease also affects Americans from the Caribbean, Central America, and parts of South America, Turkey, Greece, Italy, the Middle East and East India. Sickle-cell disease and the associated trait are most prevalent in Africa and Central America, which is attributed to natural selection: the sickle-cell trait confers a survival advantage in areas with a high occurrence of malaria, which has a high death rate among individuals without the trait. There also have been studies that show changes in the globin genes. There have been noted changes in the beta- globin sequence, to what is known as the sickle hemoglobin. The significance of the sickle-cell trait is that it does not show any symptoms, nor does it cause any major difference in blood cell count. The trait confers about 30% protection against malaria {clarify} and its occurrence appears to have risen tremendously in Africa, India and the Middle East. {over what period of time?} Some findings also show the reduction of the sickle-cell trait in those who retain much more fetal hemoglobin than usual in adulthood. Fetal hemoglobin likely plays a role in the prevention of sickling. Elevated fetal hemoglobin levels have been observed in populations where sickle-cell disease is prevalent. Pasricha,S.,Hall, W., Hall, E. (2018).How our red blood cells keep evolving to fight malaria. Quartzafrica, Retrieved from https://qz.com/africa/1450731/to-beat-malaria-red-blood-cells-keep-evolving- like-sickle-cell/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21226 Whole genome sequence analysis has identified a single origin of the sickle trait, with one haplotype ancestral to all sickle-cell variants. This haplotype is thought to have originated in the Sahara during the Holocene Wet Phase around 7,300 years ago. Sickle cell variants descended from this ancestral haplotype comprise five haplotypes named after toponyms or ethnolinguistic groups (the Arabian/Indian, Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic/Bantu, and Senegal variants), and another designation earmarked for atypical sickle-cell haplotypes. Their clinical importance is because some are associated with higher HbF levels (e.g., Senegal and Saudi-Asian variants tend to have milder disease). In athletes In some cases, athletes with sickle cell trait do not achieve the same level of performance as elite athletes with normal hemoglobin AA. Athletes with sickle cell trait and their instructors must be aware of the dangers of the condition during anaerobic exertion especially in hot and dehydrated conditions. In rare cases, exercise-induced dehydration or exhaustion may cause healthy red blood cells to turn sickle-shaped, which can cause death during sporting activities. While more research is necessary on the topic, the correlation found between individuals with sickle cell trait and an increased risk of sudden death appears to be related to microcirculatory disorders, during exercise. In recent years the NCAA has partnered with the ACSM and issued a joint statement, warning athletes about both the prevalence and the potential risk factors of sickle cell trait.\\"ACSM and NCAA Joint Statement on Sickle Cell Trait and Exercise\\", NCAA. The NCAA has also recently encouraged athletes to become aware of their sickle cell trait status, as the trait itself does not typically result in symptoms under normal conditions but can become dangerous during extreme physical activity similar to the daily training that athletes undergo. Normal hemoglobin (and hemoglobin S in the presence of oxygen) contains a deformability characteristic that allows erythrocytes to essentially squeeze their way into smaller vessels, including those involved in microcirculation to the capillaries within muscle tissue as well as blood supply embedded within organ tissues. When hemoglobin S is deprived of oxygen, it can polymerize, which is what is proposed to cause the \\"sickled\\" cells. The sickled erythrocytes present a decreased deformability when compared to normal erythrocytes, leading to distress in circulation into the smaller vessels involved in microcirculation, particularly, in this case, the capillaries embedded in muscle tissue. The resulting microvasculatory distress in capillaries specific to muscle tissue can cause acute rhabdomyolysis and necrosis within the muscle cells.\\"Consensus Statement: Sickle Cell Trait and the Athlete\\", National Athletic Trainers’ Association. The inflammation and leakage of intracellular material resulting from muscle cell necrosis releases a particular protein, myoglobin, into the blood stream. While necessary in muscle tissue to bind iron and oxygen, myoglobin circulating through the bloodstream can break down into smaller compounds that damage kidney cells, leading to various complications, such as those seen in sickle cell trait athletes during high levels of physical exertion. Because of the link between deformability and sickled cells, deformability can be used to evaluate the amount of sickled cells in the blood. Deformability of the erythrocytes that cause the microcirculatory distress can be demonstrated through various other hemorheological characteristics. In order to determine the deformability of erythrocytes multiple factors including blood and plasma viscosity and hematocrit (a calculation of the percent of red blood cells present in the blood) are measured. Alpha-thalassemia Alpha-thalassemia, like sickle cell trait, is typically inherited in areas with increased exposure to malaria. It manifests itself as a decreased expression of alpha-globin chains, causing an imbalance and excess of beta-globin chains, and can occasionally result in anemic symptoms. The abnormal hemoglobin can cause the body to destroy red blood cells, essentially causing anemia.\\"\\"Sickle Cell Disease and Thalassemia\\", American Society of Hematology. In endurance-trained individuals with sickle cell trait the presence of alpha-thalassemia has been shown to act protectively against microvasculatory distress before, during, and after exercise. Signs, symptoms, and prevention Because of the microcirculatory distress, a telltale sign or symptom of a potential sickling collapse is cramping. Specifically to sickle cell trait, cramping occurs in the lower extremities and back in athletes undergoing intense physical activity or exertion. In comparison to heat cramps, sickling cramps are less intense in terms of pain and have a weakness and fatigue associated with them, as opposed to tightly contracted muscles that lock up during heat cramps. A sickling collapse comes on slowly, following cramps, weakness, general body aches and fatigue. Individuals with known positive sickle cell trait status experiencing significant muscle weakness or fatigue during exercise should take extra time to recover and hydrate before returning to activity in order to prevent further symptoms.http://www.sicklecelldisease.org/index.cfm?page=sickle-cell-trait- athletics A collapse can be prevented by taking steps to ensure sufficient oxygen levels in the blood. Among these preventative measures are proper hydration and gradual acclimation to conditions such as heat, humidity, and decreased air pressure due to higher altitude. Gradual progression of exertion levels also helps athletes' bodies adjust and compensate, gaining fitness slowly over the course of several weeks.

It was published by Da Capo Press on October 30, 2004, just past the one-year anniversary of Smith's death. The book contains interviews with two of the musician's producers, Rob Schnapf and David McConnell, and friends such as Pete Krebs, and Bill Santen, but does not contain any original interviews with Smith, his family or his close friends.  Critical reception  The book received mixed reviews, with Publishers Weekly remarking that while \\"Nugent manages to patch together the major beats of Smith's life, he can offer little meaningful insight\\" and that Smith's fans \\"will be disappointed by this short and shallow biography.\\" PopMatters cited that Nugent \\"fails on a very basic level to discriminate between his privilege as a fan of Smith's unforgettable music and his responsibilities as a journalist writing an objective study of Smith's life\\" and the book \\"is murky, indistinct and woefully incomplete.\\" CNN said in their mixed review that \\"Nugent sometimes gets a little too insider-y—too many details about too many '90s indie bands—and his insistences on Smith's sense of humor, though no doubt true, ring hollow.\\" Many of the book's detractors complained about the absence of original testimony from Smith's family and close friends such as Joanna Bolme, Neil Gust, Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss. Ironically, many of his close friends granted interviews for the December 2004 issue of SPIN just as Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing was sent to print. Perhaps the most damning review of the book came from LA Weekly's Alec Hanley Bemis, who himself is ironically thanked in the acknowledgement section of Nugent's book. He graded Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing as \\"shallow\\", \\"sloppy\\", \\"a quickie\\", reliant on \\"second-degree friends and third-party accounts\\" and includes \\"fact checking that doesn't extend far beyond Google.\\" He cited one particular passage wherein he argued Nugent incorrectly wrote that Smith spent an evening partying in New York City with hip hop mogul and Def Jam Records founder Russell Simmons, when he was actually hanging out with the drummer from the indie rock band The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Russell Simins. Bemis goes on to say that Nugent \\"failed to realize the Blues Explosion's drummer happens to be named Russell Simins, a profoundly inconvenient homonym for a writer hurriedly transcribing interviews and rushing a book into print. The biography is filled with many such errors and approximations.\\" The Simmons/Simins mistake was not corrected in subsequent editions of the biography. However, Jim DeRogatis wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times that Nugent \\"did his research and left few stones unturned in telling Smith's relatively short and very sad story\\", and the Austin Chronicle stated that Nugent \\"opens a window of insight into our reluctant hero.\\"  Author response  In a paperback edition released a year later, Nugent used a new afterword to respond to his critics, revealing that his publisher had given him an option of two deadlines: either on the first anniversary of Smith's death, or on the release date of Smith's posthumous album From a Basement on the Hill. Nugent aimed for the release of the album, but when it was revealed the album was to coincide with the anniversary of Smith's death, he had no choice but to rush the book to completion.

Initially a folk duo, the two later married and recorded four albums, the latter two credited to Bill & Taffy.http://billdanoff.com/fatcitybilltaffy.htm In 1970, while traveling along Clopper Road to Taffy's family reunion in Gaithersburg, Maryland, Bill began writing what would become \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\\". The couple planned to complete the song and sell it to Johnny Cash. However, when Fat City opened for John Denver at The Cellar Door in December 1970, they decided to show it to him. Denver, who had injured his thumb in a car crash hours before, arrived at Bill and Taffy's apartment in the early hours of the morning, where Bill, Taffy, and Denver finished the song. The next night, they performed the completed song, with Taffy holding the lyric sheet, and it went on to become a hit song for Denver on RCA Victor in early 1971, and included on his album Poems, Prayers, and Promises, along with \\"I Guess He'd Rather Be in Colorado,\\" which Bill and Taffy also wrote. Additionally, Bill and Taffy sang backup on four of the album's tracks. Bill and Taffy Danoff married in 1972. In 1976, the Danoffs paired with Jon Carroll and Margot Chapman to form the Starland Vocal Band. Signed to John Denver's record label Windsong Records, they were most famous for the hit song \\"Afternoon Delight\\".http://billdanoff.com/biography.htm The group released several albums before breaking up in 1981. Bill and Taffy later divorced. Until 2011, Nivert lived in Washington, D.C., where she occasionally performed with Bill Danoff and the rest of the Starland Vocal Band. She then moved to Safety Harbor, Florida.

Some believe the act originated in South America; others claim the act hails from China. Performers hang suspended by their hair, which is tied into a hairhang rig; the techniques used to tie the performer's hair, and the acrobatic techniques involved in the act are key. Many people underestimate the tensile strength of hair. A single strand can potentially carry a weight of up to 100 grams; in theory, with proper technique, a full head of human hair could eventually hold between 5,600 kg and 8,400 kg (12,345 to 18,518 lbs) without breaking individual hairs or pulling out any follicles.

History In the early 1960s, Stephen Joseph was searching for a permanent base for his Studio Theatre company which specialised in theatrical productions \\"in the round\\", that is with audience on all sides. He found it in a disused cinema in Hartshill, Stoke, which was converted to theatrical use and opened as a playhouse on 9 October 1962.New Vic Theatre: History The first resident director was Peter Cheeseman, and he remained in control for 36 years, bar a period in 1967-68 when he was temporarily replaced by the management. The company soon established a reputation for innovative productions of both new and classic works. A particular focus was on plays with a local subject, such as The Knotty, about the North Staffordshire Railway, The Fight for Shelton Bar, about the closure of a local steelworks, and Jolly Potters. The first production of a play by Peter Terson took place there in 1964; he was writer in residence for 18 months and wrote 22 plays for the Victoria. As well as drama, the venue was also used for classical and other music. The square layout of the performance area and audience created an excellent acoustic for chamber music. The Lindsay String Quartet performed there regularly in the 1970s. By 1985, over 280 productions had been staged. The need had been felt for a larger, purpose-built building from the very start, and this was created in nearby Newcastle-under-Lyme and opened its doors in 1986 after many years of fundraising, negotiation with local councils and construction. The new venue took the name The New Victoria Theatre, often abbreviated to \\"New Vic\\", and this shortened name was formally adopted later. Whereas the old theatre had a seating capacity of 389, the main auditorium in the new theatre has a capacity of just over 600, with the audience surrounding a central stage as before. The acoustics for music are good and the Lindsay String Quartet performed there regularly, as they had done at the old theatre. The theatre continues to keep close to its Potteries roots. One of the plays in its re- opening season was by local playwright Arthur Berry. In 1998, Peter Cheeseman retired as Artistic Director, and was succeeded by Gwenda Hughes. In 2007 she in turn was succeeded by Theresa Heskins.

The game is based on Boxer, an unreleased 1978 arcade game from Whitehead's previous employer, Atari, Inc. Boxer was written by Mike Albaugh who also wrote Drag Race for Atari, a game cloned by Activision as Dragster. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot Boxing shows a top-down view of two boxers, one white and one black. When close enough, a boxer can hit his opponent with a punch (executed by pressing the fire button on the Atari joystick). This causes his opponent to reel back slightly. Long punches score one point, while closer punches (power punches, from the manual) score two. There are no knockdowns or rounds. A match is completed either when one player lands 100 punches (a \\"knockout\\") or two minutes have elapsed (a \\"decision\\"). In the case of a decision, the player with the most landed punches is the winner. Ties are possible. While the gameplay is simple, there are subtleties, such as getting an opponent on the \\"ropes\\" and \\"juggling\\" him back and forth between alternate punches. Reception Boxing was reviewed by Video magazine in its \\"Arcade Alley\\" column where it was described as \\"demonstrat[ing] Activision's willingness to strike out boldly in new directions\\" and praised for keeping things from \\"becoming needlessly complex\\" by making automatic punch-type selection for the player. Legacy Boxing was made available on Microsoft's Game Room service for its Xbox 360 console and for Windows-based PCs on September 1, 2010. In 2011, an extended academic version of the game, called Clever Boxer, was developed as a benchmark for Game AI. The game made an appearance in an Season 8 episode of The Walking Dead, where Eugene was shown playing it just before the power went out.

A Ghons complex retains viable bacteria, making them sources of long-term infection, which may reactivate and trigger secondary tuberculosis later in life. In countries where cow milk infected with Mycobacterium bovis has been eliminated (due to culling of infected cows and pasteurization), primary tuberculosis is usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and almost always begins in the lungs. Typically, the inhaled bacilli implant in the distal airspaces of the lower part of the upper lobe or the upper part of the lower lobe, usually close to the pleura. As sensitization develops, a 1- to 1.5-cm area of gray-white inflammation with consolidation emerges, known as the Ghon focus. In most cases, the center of this focus undergoes caseous necrosis. Tubercle bacilli, either free or within phagocytes, drain to the regional nodes, which also often caseate. This combination of parenchymal lung lesion and nodal involvement is referred to as the Ghon complex. During the first few weeks, there is also lymphatic and hematogenous dissemination to other parts of the body. In approximately 95% of cases, development of cell-mediated immunity controls the infection.  Differentiation  The Ghon complex undergoes progressive fibrosis, often followed by radiologically detectable calcification (Ranke complex), and despite seeding of other organs, no lesions develop. Although they are often confused, Ranke complex and Ghon complex are not synonymous.

History  Built by Alfred Grenander, the station opened on 19 January 1924 as the terminus of the extension of the north-south U-Bahn (today's lines U6 and U7) from Hallesches Tor, before the eventual extension to Neukolln. The station is named after August von Gneisenau, a 19th-century Prussian Generalfeldmarschall. Until February 28, 1966, the line formerly designated as C1 operated from Gneisenaustrasse to Britz-Süd via Neukölln in one direction and to Tegel via Friedrichstrasse in the other. With the commissioning of the route from Mehringdamm to Möckernbrücke the next day, this changed the U6 and U7 so that the line now called Line 7 ran between Möckernbrücke and Britz-Süd. The extension from Britz-Süd to Rudow opened in 1972, and Möckernbrücke to Rathaus Spandau in 1984. In 1968 the 80-meter platforms were extended to 110 meters to allow the use of longer six-car trains. At the same time, the plaster walls were abandoned in favor of a green tile paneling. Due to these changes the station lost much of its original appearance.J.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  Christ Evangelical Lutheran Church was founded in 1884 by thirteen families who were peacefully released from St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church. Services were initially conducted in a private residence. Later in 1884, Christ Evangelical Lutheran Church erected a wooden building east of the present church. This structure housed both church and school until 1901 and the school until the early 1970s. The church was designed by architect Frederick Velguth in the German Gothic Revival style and built in 1901. With Akin to Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church across the Menomonee River, it features a landmark spire and sandstone details on the façade. Construction of the church started early in 1901 and was almost complete for the December 1, 1901 dedication, although the heating system was not finished and the trumpets froze in the cold church. In 1884, the church called the Rev. Heinrich Bergmann, then 25, as pastor. He served until his death in 1923. Bergmann's son, the Rev. Paul Bergmann, then served until his death in 1941. The interior of the large, red-brick church is a century of art. Pews from the 1884 church are in the balcony. The 1901 pews are on the main floor, next to the large stained-glass windows from the same era. The altar, pulpit, lectern and a false door, as well as the roof and the cross atop the steeple are from the late 1940s. The ceiling of the church, which contains gold leafing, is from 1984, as are the crosses painted on the walls behind the altar and many of the light fixtures. One unique feature of the church is the basement windows, cut in the west wall at an angle to maximize the afternoon sun.

Highway 39 also connects with the communities of Breton, Warburg, Thorsby, and Calmar; while most of the small communities are now bypassed, Highway 39 still travels along Main Street in Calmar. History Highway 39 was originally constructed as a link between Leduc and Breton, where it ended at Highway 12 (now Highway 20).

The company built mechanical, and then electromechanical calculators which had a reputation for reliability. First models were similar to the Odhner arithmometer. In 1918, employee Carl Friden designed a new model in response to patent challenges. It was a great success, and Friden became the chief designer until he left in 1934 to found his own company. In 1958 the company was acquired by the Smith Corona typewriter company in a diversification move that proved unsound; the company, which was now known as SCM, tried to stay competitive by introducing the SCM Cogito 240SR electronic calculator (designed by Manhattan Project veteran Stan Frankel) in 1965. Within a few years a tidal wave of cheaper electronic calculators had devastated their business, and by the mid-1980s, SCM's typewriter business, too, had been ruined by the advent of inexpensive personal computers used as word processors.  Calculator design  1920s EB-9 Marchant calculator The first Marchant calculators differed greatly from their later Silent Speed Proportional Gears machines, which were by far the fastest of their type, running at 1,300 cycles per minute. These machines are of considerable technical interest, and are far better known than the earliest ones. Their mechanical design was very unusual in that their result dials (sums, differences, and products) moved at speeds proportional to the digit in the corresponding column of the keyboard. A '1' in the keyboard caused its dial to move the slowest, while a '9', the fastest. Probably the only other such machine was the European Mercedes Euklid, which had a very different (and apparently much simpler) design. Silent Speed 8D Carrying to the next higher order was done (effectively) by a 10:1 gear ratio, rather like traditional watthour-meter dials. This was probably unique in a calculator. While running consecutive 'add' cycles to develop a product in multiplication, much of the mechanism was running at constant speeds. All other mechanical calculators had result dials that moved only at one speed, but for different amounts of time, naturally for longer times when larger digits were to be entered. They started quickly, ran at one speed, and stopped quickly. (They also had mechanisms to prevent overshoot (known as coasting) when they stopped.) Figurematic (1950-52) In the Marchant, each column had its own mechanism that might be described as a nine-speed pre-selector transmission. Once engaged, that was what made the dials move at speeds proportional to the digit in that column. This meant that the machine contained, in all, several hundred individual gears. Carries from lower-order digits came in via one planetary differential per dial. If one held down the + bar, in neighboring columns to the left (with zeros for them in the keyboard), one could see two or maybe three higher-order dials moving at the speeds one would expect. Watthour meter dials, like the hour hand of a clock, make no attempt to point to the correct digit, if the dial to the right is between, for example, 3 and 7, or so. Such misalignment would be intolerable in a calculator's dials, so each of the Marchant's dials had a constant-lead (\\"snail\\") cam attached. Omitting important details, this cam determined the amount of movement needed to realign the result dials. That correction was applied by a second spur-gear differential, again, one per dial. Some calculators that had been serviced had dials that were mispositioned by (probably) 3.6 degrees; the gears weren't quite meshed correctly when reassembled. 1960s SCM Marchant calculator The calculator was very complicated compared to, for example the Friden STW, a machine notable for its relative internal simplicity. Much of the Marchant's control mechanism was beneath the keys, and had about 25 \\"layers\\" of levers, linkages, latches, and such. It had three driveshafts, extending across the mechanism. Most other calculators had only one. Most mechanical calculators capable of fully automatic division (and there were many), subtracted until the accumulator went into overdraft (\\"subtracted one time too many\\"), then added once to restore the value in the accumulator. The Marchant, however, contained a chain of analog comparators to anticipate the overdraft, and prepare for the next quotient digit. The Marchant mechanism, internally, differed profoundly in many respects from other makes of calculators of the same general variety. By virtue of sophistication (and complexity), it gained a considerable speed advantage, compared to other designs.

Most Italians moved to Germany for reasons of work, others for personal relations, study, or political reasons. Today, Italians in Germany form one of the largest Italian diasporas in the world and account for one of the largest immigrant groups in Germany. History Italian emigrants in Germany (called \\"Gastarbeiter\\"), receiving instruction in 1962 Large numbers of Italians have resided in Germany since the early Middle Ages, particularly architects, craftsmen and traders. During the late Middle Ages and early modern times many Italians came to Germany for business, and relations between the two countries prospered. The political borders were also somewhat intertwined under the German princes' attempts to extend control over all the Holy Roman Empire, which extended from northern Germany down to Northern Italy. During the Renaissance many Italian bankers, architects and artists moved to Germany and successfully integrated in the German society. Italian worker in Duisburg in 1962 Italian workers in Cologne in 1962 When the huge Italian emigration of the 19th century began, only a few Italians moved to the German Empire under Prussian rule. With Germany's post- World War II economic boom (Wirtschaftswunder), a large wave of immigrants from Italy relocated to Germany. Italy and Germany have been joint members of the European Coal and Steel Community (later the European Economic Community). Since the establishment of freedom of movement for workers between the two countries in 1961, more than 580,000 Italians migrated to Germany for work, mainly from southern and north-eastern Italy. Among the German cities Wolfsburg and Ludwigshafen had the highest share of Italian migrants in 2011 according to German Census data. The workers in the Contemporary Art Museum of Casoria in Naples, Italy, proposed a plea of asylum to Germany.'A Warning Scream from Italian Art': Naples Museum Requests Asylum in Germany Der Spiegel 2011-02-07 Organised crime In 2017 there were 14 organized crime trials of Italian mafia groups. The following groups were involved: * Ndrangheta, seven trials * Cosa Nostra, three trials * Camorra two trials. The major activity of these groups was cocaine drug trafficking. In these trials 169 suspects were reported, of which 139 were Italian citizens. Social integration Italians in Germany are actively involved both in regional and federal German politics; areas of concern are European integration and assimilation.

After the two cathedrals, it is the largest church in Norwich and was built between 1430 and 1455. It stands on a slightly elevated position, next to the market place. St Peter Mancroft is a member of the Greater Churches Group. Description The present building was begun in 1430, on the site of an existing church, and consecrated in 1455. It is an ambitious building, 180 feet long and ashlar faced with a tower at the west end. It is a Grade I listed building. It has a Norman foundation dating from 1075, a 1463 font, a 1573 Flemish tapestry and medieval glass. The North transept displays a remarkable collection of church silver (one of the finest of any parish church in the country) including the Gleane and Thistle cups, as well as memorabilia associated with its most famous parishioner, the physician-philosopher Thomas Browne, author of Religio Medici (1642). The small lead-covered spire with flying buttresses was added by A.E. Street in 1896. In 1850 two L-shaped trenches accommodating a number of acoustic jars were discovered beneath the wooden floor on which the choir stalls had previously stood. The earthenware jars were built into its walls at intervals of about three feet, with the mouths facing into the trenches. Bells St Peter Mancroft has a ring of fourteen Whitechapel bells in the western tower, eleven of which date from 1775 and the latest of which dates from 1997. St Peter Mancroft is important in the history of change ringing because in 1715, 5040 changes of Plain Bob Triples were rung for the first time, in 3 hours and 17 minutes, as recorded in an inscription in the tower. Subsequently, the first complete peals to the change ringing systems known as Grandsire and Stedman were also rung in St Peter Mancroft. Supernatural folklore is linked to the bells in St Peter Mancroft. In the story \\"Our Bells\\" authored by Mark Knights, which featured in the undated booklet (circa 1894) \\"Norfolk Stories\\", Knight writes: The story tells of how a nobleman, fallen upon hard times, unwittingly tries to rob his own brother, but stays his hand after hearing the moving and beautiful Christmas Eve peal of bells. He subsequently assists in the ringing of the New Year's Eve peal, and bequeaths a sum of money to ensure that a jug of spiced ale is made available to future bell-ringers on that date. The story is recounted by a ghostly descendant of the sexton who was in residence when these events occurred. In 2018 the Mancroft Ringing Discovery Centre was opened, to promote the history of the bell-tower and to train a new generation of bell-ringers.

He is an alternative version of Wolverine that appears in the Ultimate Marvel imprint, in stories separate from the original character. Created by writer Mark Millar and artist Adam Kubert (based on the original character created by Roy Thomas, Len Wein and John Romita Sr.), Ultimate Wolverine first appeared in Ultimate X-Men #1 (February 2001). Fictional character biography Early years Wolverine suffered from amnesia. As a result, what little was known about his early life was both suspect and unverifiable. It is believed that, on one point, Wolverine had a wife or girlfriend, but she was supposedly murdered by Sabretooth. As both Wolverine's and Sabretooth's memories had been tampered with in the past (most commonly by the Weapon X), this claim was highly suspect; however, Wolverine did own a wedding ring that served as his only link to his past. He also owned dogtags. One side read 'Logan' and the other side 'Wolverine'.Ultimate X-Men #2Ultimate X-Men #6 Captain America recognized Wolverine as James Howlett, a paratrooper he had made several jumps with during World War II. He was called \\"Lucky Jim\\" because he always survived, no matter how gravely he was injured. Dum-Dum Dugan also recognized him as Jim although how he knew him has not yet been specified.Ultimate X-Men #39 Ultimate Origins depicts Nick Fury and Fisk (Kingpin's grandfather) as looting a house for its goods only to be caught and taken hostage. Tests were conducted on Fury to see if he was a candidate to become a super soldier, and a little over a year later Howlett was also tested but escaped. Howlett's newly activated mutant abilities kicked in. This was considered the dawn of the mutant race, and Howlett was named \\"Mutant Zero.\\" At some point in later years he was captured by Erik Lensherr's parents in a plan to 'cure' the mutant gene. When Lensherr discovered the plot he helped to free Wolverine, but not before killing his mother and father. Years later he was experimented on by Weapon X who gave him his adamantium claws by Malcolm Colcord.Ultimate Origins #3 Weapon X Wolverine was kidnapped by John Wraith, a mutant-hating commando, and head of the Weapon X Project. His memory was erased and was given the fake name \\"Logan\\". He was often tortured and tormented by Wraith and his guards. It was during this time his skeletal structure was bonded with Adamantium. While being deployed in the desert during the Gulf War, the vehicle he was in was ambushed, and Wolverine was set loose from his cage. He slaughtered the enemies and came across Nick Fury, the only other survivor, who was injured. Logan carried him back to base, though he was then shot and caged once again. Wraith was surprised that his \\"living weapon\\" still retained his humanity.Ultimate X-Men #35-37 A couple years later, Logan broke out of Weapon X with the help of Fury, who never forgot about the man who saved his lifeUltimate X-Men #33 Logan later traveled to the Balkan Mountains. After being overwhelmed by a snow storm, he was taken in by a woman named Magda aka \\"The Witch of Wundagore\\". While recovering, Logan had intercourse with Magda, but was interrupted by her current boyfriend Eric Lensherr. Using his powers, Lensherr quickly dispatched Logan- hurling him from the mountain forcing him to wander in the wild alone.Ultimates 3 #3 Years later, Wolverine joined Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy, and eventually became Magneto's elite assassin.Ultimate X-Men #3 Joining the X-Men Eighteen months later, Logan was assigned to infiltrate the X-Men and assassinate Professor X. He was accepted into their ranks, and quickly seduced Jean Grey in order to further entrench himself within the team. However, Wolverine accidentally fell in love with Jean, and was devastated when she left him upon discovering his connection to the Brotherhood. Wolverine eventually betrayed Magneto, abandoning his initial mission and truly joined the X-Men after coming to understand and believe in Xavier's cause.Ultimate X-Men #6 Seeking answers to Wolverine's past (and to liberate imprisoned mutant test subjects), the team traveled to the site of the Weapon X Project. There they encountered Wraith - and Sabretooth. Sabretooth burned the files on Wolverine - and thus destroyed the only record of his past - in front of his eyes, leading up to the first match-up between the two. At first, Sabretooth appeared to be winning, until Wolverine scored a dirty hit (slashing Sabretooth in the groin). The battle culminated with Sabretooth's plunge off of a cliff, and the complete dismantlement of the Weapon X Project.Ultimate X-Men #39 Unfortunately, by this time, Jean had begun a relationship with Cyclops, leading to a deep rift growing between the two men. Their rivalry came to a head when Xavier sent the two of them on a mission to the Savage Land, hoping to end their enmity. However, the reverse occurred: Wolverine allowed Cyclops to fall to his death, believing he would then be able to continue his relationship with Jean.Ultimate X-Men #20-25 Miraculously, Cyclops survived, and returned, revealing Wolverine's hand in his disappearance. Cyclops blasted Wolverine to the ground, and then shocked everyone by offering to let him remain on the team (his only chance of redemption).Ultimate X-Men #2 This experience had a profound effect upon Logan. He realized how badly he had betrayed his friends, and ceased his antisocial, ruthless ways, and even developed a deep and abiding sense of responsibility. He also displayed a protective side for the younger X-Men, namely Rogue, and even eventually formed a bond of friendship - or at least mutual respect - with Cyclops.Ultimate X-Men #28 Wolverine's nemesis was far from destroyed, as Sabretooth returned as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy, replacing Wolverine at Magneto's side. After a fierce battle, Sabretooth began to taunt Wolverine, saying that he could never be killed, could recover from any injury, and would always return to haunt Wolverine - to which Wolverine responded by decapitating him on the spot.Ultimate X-Men #9-12 Wolverine later began a half-hearted relationship with Storm, which he quickly ended. However, they both still harbored feelings for one another, and on a future \\"date\\", the couple were attacked by a revived Sabretooth (sporting a scar around his neck).Ultimate X-Men #44 Sabretooth began to explain how he managed to survive thanks to a few little threads Wolverine neglected to cut, but was rendered comatose for several months. He engaged Wolverine in a brief encounter, until Storm separated the two, inadvertently allowing Sabretooth to take her hostage.Ultimate X-Men #40 Sabretooth said he hadn't come to fight, and revealed that, since his resurrection, his original memories had begun to return. He had become able to determine which memories were fake, as well. He also claimed that Wolverine was his biological father. This claim is unverified. Ultimate Wolverine Vs. Hulk Wolverine was contacted by Nick Fury, who was concerned that the Hulk may have survived S.H.I.E.L.D.'s attempt to execute him. Fury assigned Wolverine to find the Hulk, who S.H.I.E.L.D. believed to be in Tibet, and eliminate him. Wolverine tracked down the Hulk in Tibet, where he greeted him. To Wolverine's surprise Banner is in complete control of himself as the Hulk. Hulk and Wolverine exchange words, with Hulk belittling Wolverine's intelligence, and also revealed that Fury ordered the Ultimates to kill Logan if he ever abandons the X-Men. Logan then informed Hulk that Betty Ross wants him dead, angering Hulk. Wolverine is about to leave but then asked if he could ask Betty out which infuriated Hulk to attack Wolverine.Ultimate Wolverine vs Hulk #1 After a vicious exchange, the Hulk gained the upper hand and proceeded to rip Wolverine in half. Wolverine survived, and began the long climb up a mountainside to retrieve his legs. Unfortunately for Logan the Hulk is already there when Wolverine arrives. Hulk says that he will eat one of his legs in order to force Wolverine to leave Hulk alone, but Wolverine says that he will never stop chasing Bruce until he kills him. Then She-Hulk arrives and confronts an angry Hulk, Wolverine reattaches his legs as Hulk attacks an atomic bomb sent by Fury.Ultimate Wolverine vs Hulk #2 Fury then decapitated Wolverine, demanding information, which Logan did not completely give. Locked in the Triskelion, Wolverine met Forge (a former Brotherhood member), and the two escaped.Ultimate Wolverine vs Hulk #2 Wolverine reunited with Betty Ross in a hotel room. Ross transformed into She-Hulk and attacked Wolverine, but Wolverine quickly stabbed She-Hulk, which left her in critical condition. Ross begged Wolverine to spare Bruce, but he refusedUltimate Wolverine vs Hulk #2 Later, Logan went to the airport where Bruce was, got on the same plane, and sat next to him. Logan put a collar made by Forge on Bruce, telling him that if he turns into Hulk while the collar is on him, he will choke to death. Bruce asks why Logan simply won't just kill him and get it over with, and Logan says that he didn't want to kill Bruce, he wanted to kill the Hulk. Bruce said that he did not deserve the treatment and that he was a good person, but Logan replied that he is a bad person and that it is irrelevant what either person deserves.Ultimate Wolverine vs Hulk #3 Bruce said that he does not believe that Logan is a bad person and will prove it. Bruce then said that he wouldn't change, and then jumped out of the airplane emergency exit in mid-flight. Logan jumped out after him screaming at him to turn into the Hulk or the fall would kill him. Bruce said that he would only change if Logan would cut off the collar, or else Logan would have to deal with the fact that he simply let \\"Bruce,\\" and not the \\"Hulk\\" fall to his death. Logan, not wanting to be responsible for Bruce's death, shows his moral side and breaks the collar. Bruce transforms into the Hulk, holds Logan, and lands on his feet with no harm done to either of them.Ultimate Wolverine vs Hulk #4 Nick Fury showed up and told them that they were free to go. Fury angrily warns Wolverine that he is now on his %^&* list, but Wolverine states that he is on humanity's %^&* list. Hulk let Fury go, who then left. In the middle of the desert, Hulk and Logan calmly discuss getting back to civilization, and Hulk agrees to pick up Logan and jump to the nearest town to drop him off.Ultimate Wolverine vs Hulk #4 Pre-Ultimatum / Banshee Wolverine found out that he was dosed with Banshee and goes to Peter Parker for help. He discovered that he wasn't actually dosed, but that properties of the drug were derived from him.Ultimate X-Men #94 Because certain members of the X-Men became Banshee addicts, the non-addicted members were forced to fight them and prevent them from using it. When Jean fell unconscious, he violently attacked Colossus, but soon cooled off. He then discovered that Xavier and Magneto were responsible for the creation of the power-enhancing drug and that Moira MacTaggert was distributing it. Moira fought him, though he destroyed the facility in which Banshee was produced Ultimate X-Men #94 Ultimatum Wolverine is forced to travel to the Savage Land to find the brainwashed Jamie Madrox and kill him, to stop the waves of Madrox suicide bombers worldwide. He vows to do the same thing to Magneto. When the X-Men and the Ultimates finally confront Magneto, Wolverine charges towards his foe, slashing him multiple times before Magneto overrides Iron Man's armor and Cyclops' visor to unleash full strength blasts from both to incinerate Wolverine. Believing him to be dead, Magneto gets too close to gloat before Wolverine. The nearly fleshless Wolverine jumps up and stabs his claws into Magneto's chest, mortally wounding him (however, Cyclops would later kill him before he could succumb to his wounds). Magneto rips the Adamantium from Wolverine's bones, killing Wolverine, leaving just a severely charred skeleton and an arm of flesh.Ultimatum #4 Shadowcat returns to Triskelion to find Wolverine's fleshless arm (the one that was left in Magneto after Wolverine was killed). Shadowcat returns to the site of the mansion with Wolverine's arm and adds it to the grave of fallen X-Men.Ultimatum #5 Jimmy Hudson After Wolverine's death, it was revealed he had a biological son with Magda named Jimmy Hudson. Hudson inherited the claws, healing factor, and facial hair of his father and in addition to these he inherited a unique ability of his own an ability to coat his bone claws with a liquid metal similar to adamantium and after the Ultimate Universe is destroyed Hudson moves into the main Marvel Universe.An Old Foe and a Familiar Face Join the Young Mutants of X-Men Blue Powers and abilities Wolverine has a healing factor that allows him to recover from wounds fairly quickly. Wolverine's healing factor makes him capable of surviving without his legs or even his head attached to his body. Wolverine's healing factor was not strong enough in the end to defend Wolverine from having himself be obliterated by Magneto who tears the adamantium from his body. Wolverine's mutant power in the Ultimate Universe has been described as the ability to \\"survive\\" as opposed to just a \\"heal\\". It is commonly thought that Wolverine's death in Ultimatum was counter to continuity, as previously Wolverine had survived being ripped in half, detached without his head, and a nuclear explosion. Wolverine also has a keen sense of smell and is able to detect lies. Personality Wolverine at first favors the mutant supremacy doctrine of Magneto and acts as a double agent for the X-Men, intending to kill Professor Xavier. However, he falls in love with Jean Grey and decides to rebel against Magneto, truthfully joining the X-Men and their cause. Wolverine is also shown to harbor a jealousy of Cyclops, who begins to date Jean Grey, causing him to intentionally not aid Cyclops when he is in danger. However, the hostility between the two men ended soon after and they developed a mutual friendship and trust of each other in the later issues. This version of Wolverine also appears to initially possess a darker, cynical, violent and more morally ambiguous personality compared to his mainline counterpart, even placing a bar of soap shaped like a grenade into a man's luggage at an airport in order to pass through metal detectors. Wolverine also takes the task of killing the Hulk merely out of the thrill of the challenge. In Ultimates 3, he also responds to Hawkeye's comments that he used to be in the Brotherhood with the comment \\"Yeah, and you used to be married with two kids\\"; this is a callous reference to his family's murder in the previous story. However, similar to his standard counterpart, Wolverine does show a more compassionate and humane side of his personality and adheres to a strict moral code, which is evidenced in a number of instances, such as when he risked his chance at freedom to help save Nick Fury, his sparing of She-Hulk when he is given the chance to kill her, and saving Bruce Banner after previously expressing his desire to kill the Hulk. Eventually, as the series progressed, Wolverine developed to be a loyal and reliable member of the X-Men, while also becoming a better person and regained most of his humanity, which resulted in him developing an uncharacteristic concern for other mutants and mutantkind in general, while also lessening his cynical outlook on life and gruff nature in the process and forms a family-like relationship with the team and Xavier's other students.

Publications for its COMPUTE! and COMPUTE!'s Gazette magazines, and various books. These programs are designed to allow home computer users to easily detect errors on BASIC type-in programs, and work by displaying a hash value for each line entered that can be compared against the reference value printed in the magazine. Initially published for use with the Commodore 64 and VIC-20 in 1983, the Proofreader was later made available for the Atari 8-bit family, Apple II family, and IBM PC/PCjr as well. The line-by-line \\"real-time\\" feedback feature was something of a novelty at the time and represented a significant improvement over earlier checksum utilities, which were typically run only after a user program had been entered and, due to quite simplistic checksum algorithms, had trouble catching errors like transposed characters. Commodore versions The Automatic Proofreader was first introduced in October 1983 for the Commodore 64 and VIC-20. This first version had separate versions for the VIC and 64; the following month, they were combined into a single listing designed to work on both systems. This version of the Proofreader would display a byte-sized numeric value at the top left corner of the screen whenever a program line was entered. The initial version of the Proofreader, however, had several drawbacks. It was loaded into the cassette buffer (memory area), which was overwritten whenever a program was loaded or saved using the Datassette. This caused difficulties if a cassette user had to resume work on a partially completed listing. A complicated method had to be used to get both the Proofreader and the program listing in memory at the same time. Also, the checksum method used was relatively rudimentary, and did not catch transposition errors, nor did it take whitespace into account. Because of this, the New Automatic Proofreader was introduced in February 1986. This version used a more sophisticated checksum algorithm that could catch transposition errors. It also took spaces into account if they were within quotes (where they were generally significant to the program's operation), while ignoring them outside of quotes (where they were not relevant). Also, the decimal display of the checksum was replaced by two letters. The New Automatic Proofreader was designed to run on any Commodore 8-bit home computer (including the C16/Plus/4 and C128), automatically relocating itself to the bottom of BASIC RAM and moving pointers to hide its presence.

Fry was the first person born in the United States to write for a large symphony orchestra, and the first to compose a publicly performed opera. He was also the first music critic for a major American newspaper, and he was the first person to insist that his fellow countrymen support American-made music. Biography William Henry Fry was born on August 10, 1813 in Philadelphia. His father, William Fry, was a prominent printer and, along with Roberts Vaux and Robert Walsh, ran the National Gazette and Literary Register, a major American newspaper at the time—edited by Robert Walsh from 1821 to 1836. William Henry had four brothers—Joseph Reese, Edward Plunket, Charles, and Horace Fry. He was educated at what is now Mount Saint Mary's University in Emmitsburg, Maryland. After returning to Philadelphia to work for his father, he studied composition with Leopold Meignen, a former band leader in Napoleon Bonaparte's army and the music director of the Musical Fund Society orchestra. He eventually became secretary of the Musical Fund Society. Fry's operatic compositions include Aurelia the Vestal, Leonora (based on the 1838 play The Lady of Lyons), and Notre-Dame of Paris (based on the 1831 novel by Victor Hugo). Leonora was a very successful production at its premiere in 1845 and second run the following year. Leonora is also significant as it was the first grand opera written by an American composer. The opera was written for Ann Childe Seguin who took the title role when it opened.More Tresures from Tams, Geri Laudati, University of Wisconsin Madison, retrieved 15 May 2015 After a six-year sojourn in Europe (1846–52), where he served as foreign correspondent to the Philadelphia Public Ledger, Horace Greeley's New York Tribune, and The Message Bird (later known as the New York Musical World and Times), Fry gave a series of eleven widely publicized lectures in New York's Metropolitan Hall. These dealt with subjects such as the history and theory of music as well as the state of American classical music. In addition to his operas, Fry wrote seven symphonies that have extra-musical themes. His Santa Claus: Christmas Symphony of 1853, which was very well received by audiences but derided by many of Fry's rival critics, may be the first orchestral use of the saxophone, invented barely a decade before. His 1854 Niagara Symphony, written for Louis Jullien's orchestra, uses eleven timpani to create the roar of the waters, snare drums to reproduce the hiss of the spray, and a remarkable series of discordant, chromatic descending scales to reproduce the chaos of the falling waters as they crash onto the rocks. Fry's other works, including Leonora (New York debut in 1858) and Notre-Dame of Paris (1864, Philadelphia), received mixed reviews along partisan lines: conservatives tended to dislike Fry's music, whereas political progressives highly enjoyed it. His other musical works included the Overture to Macbeth, the Breaking Heart, string quartets and sacred choral music. From 1852 until his death in 1864, Fry served as music critic and political editor for the New York Tribune. Death William Henry Fry died at age 51 on December 21, 1864, in Santa Cruz (Saint Croix) in the Virgin Islands. His death was apparently from tuberculosis \\"accelerated by exhaustion.\\" He is buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

According to Variety, in 2017, Shore Fire Media had the largest number of Grammy Award nominations, with 21 nominations for 2018, of any public relations firm.  History  Shore Fire Media was founded in 1990 by Marilyn Laverty in a small office in Brooklyn, New York with one employee and two desks, and future company senior VP Mark Satlof as a consultant. Laverty previously had worked for 13 years at Columbia Records, rising to become VP of publicity. In 2016, Billboard named Laverty one of the music industry's most powerful female executives in its annual \\"Women in Music\\" issue. She has had a long-standing relationship with musician Bruce Springsteen as his publicist. While the company originally focused on the music industry, it later branched into a wider client base including venues, businesses, websites, books, and non-music events. Other clients include entertainers, content creators, authors, comedians, apps and services, non-profit organizations, and trade associations, as well as health and lifestyle brands. The New York Observer named Shore Fire one of \\"the most powerful entertainment and media PR firms of 2018\\". Shore Fire also appeared on the Observer’s \\"Power List 50\\" of New York's top public relations firms in 2013, 2014, and 2015 and was listed as the city's top arts/culture/media firm by the publication in 2016. In 2013, Shore Fire opened an office in Nashville, Tennessee. In January 2018, Shore Fire opened an office in Los Angeles, California, led by Ally Norton.  Notable campaigns  Shore Fire Media has run public relations campaigns for musicians such as Bruce Springsteen, Zac Brown Band, Bon Iver, Lana Del Rey, and Elvis Costello. Other current and past music clients have included Carole King, Bonnie Raitt, and St. Vincent, as well as Summerfest, Brooklyn Bowl, and Fare The Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead. In July 2002, the company gained recognition with the launch of the Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's The Rising. Shore Fire Media initially released less than ten copies to selected listeners before the release, as compared to the industry standard of releasing hundreds of promos, in an effort to thwart online sharing of the album.

Biography Iradier was born in Lanciego, in the province of Álava. His publisher in Paris urged him to \\"universalize\\" his name, from Iradier to Yradier. He is known primarily for his habaneras, especially the one titled \\"La Paloma\\", written around 1860 after a visit to Cuba. \\"La Paloma\\" was extremely popular in both Spain and the Americas (especially Mexico), where it was responsible for the great popularity achieved by the habanera. Radio Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) has estimated that there are more than one thousand versions of \\"La Paloma\\", and said that, together with \\"Yesterday\\" by The Beatles, it is one of the most recorded songs in the history of music. Another of Iradier's compositions is \\"El Arreglito\\", a habanera used by Georges Bizet in his opera Carmen. Bizet, thinking it was a folk song, was inspired by the melody, and recomposed it as the aria \\"L'amour est un oiseau rebelle\\", also known as the \\"Habanera\\". When he discovered his mistake, Bizet added a note to the vocal score of the opera, acknowledging its source.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954 Iradier died in obscurity in Vitoria in 1865.

There are several different types of video signal generators in widespread use. Regardless of the specific type, the output of a video generator will generally contain synchronization signals appropriate for television, including horizontal and vertical sync pulses (in analog) or sync words (in digital). Generators of composite video signals (such as NTSC and PAL) will also include a colorburst signal as part of the output.  Types of video signal generators  Video signal generators are primarily classed according to their function. In addition, they may be classified according to the video formats and interface standard they support—one generator may generate composite analog signals (typically NTSC, PAL, or both), another may generate CCIR 601, and a third may generate MPEG streams over an ASI. Many manufacturers sell signal generation platforms, which can be populated with multiple modules providing the above capabilities (and supporting different formats). Many such platforms also include audio generation capability (as television includes audio as well as video), supporting either embedded audio or standalone audio formats.  Test signal generators  A test signal generator generates test patterns, and other useful test signals, for troubleshooting and analyzing television systems. These devices are generally intended for off-line use (test patterns are seldom broadcast, unless a station is not operating properly or is off the air at the time), as they output complete television signals. Examples of signals output by such a device include: * Color bars, one of several test signals used to verify the proper reproduction of a TV system's color gamut, and/or that a television signal or plant is compliant with the appropriate analog transmission standards * Flat fields, a signal consisting of nothing but a specific color (typically white, black, a shade of gray, or one of the primary colors (red, green, and blue) at maximum saturation). A red field is especially important in PAL applications, as it is the \\"red difference\\" portion of the chroma signal whose phase alternates every line; the red field should appear as a solid block of color, with no visible \\"bands\\" going across the screen. * Multibursts, sweeps, and pulse signals, used to test the frequency response of a television system * Ramp signals and staircase signals, used to check the voltage linearity of a television system * Crosshatch patterns, used to check and calibrate alignment, aspect ratio, convergence, and both vertical and horizontal linearity * The bowtie signal, used to check the relative (inter- channel) timing of a component video signal. A few specialized signals are used in digital environments: * The PLL test signal is a pathological test signal used to stress the phase-locked loop of a serial digital receiver; this is done by outputting a bit pattern which, after passing through the linear feedback shift register used to scramble serial digital signals, resulting (with a high degree of probability) in a long strings of zeroes or ones, followed by a long string of the opposite polarity, on the digital (NRZI) signal; an issue which can cause poorly designed PLLs to unlock. * The equalizer test signal is another pathological signal, consisting of a long string of zeroes or ones, followed by a single bit of the opposite polarity. It can cause poorly designed cable equalizers to malfunction. * The SDI Checkfield signal, standardized by SMPTE RP178 (for SD) and RP198 (for HD), is a test signal which contains one of the above signals in the upper portion of the video, and the other in the lower portion of the video. In addition, sophisticated signal generators may allow modification of the video timing, adjustment of the gains of the various components (including out of range), the introduction of jitter or bit errors (into digital signals), the introduction of motion, or other effects.  VITS inserters  A vertical interval test signal inserter, or VITS inserter inserts test patterns into the vertical interval of a television signal. Unlike test signal generators; a VITS inserter is used to insert the test signal into live programming, so that inline measurements of a transmission chain can be made while the chain is operational. (As the vertical interval is typically not visible on end-user televisions, this can be done without producing any artifacts noticeable to viewers). Since VITS signals can often be transmitted, it is also possible for a television station to receive its own on-air feed, and use the VITS to detect and troubleshoot problems in on-air transmission.  Sync pulse generator  A sync pulse generator (SPG) is a special type of generator which produces synchronization signals, with a high level of stability and accuracy. These devices are used to provide a master timing source for a video facility. The output of an SPG will typically be in one of several forms, depending on the needs of the facility: * A continuous wave signal * In standard-definition applications, a bi-level sync signal, often with a colorburst signal in facilities that have analog equipment. Typically, this is either in NTSC or PAL format. As the resulting signal is usually indistinguishable from an all-black television signal of the same format, this sort of reference is commonly known as black or black burst. * In some high- definition applications, a tri-level sync signal is used instead. This signal is virtually identical to the synchronization signal used in component analogue video (CAV); and is similar to the synchronization signals used in VGA (the main difference being, in VGA the horizontal and vertical syncs are carried on different wires; whereas TLS signals include both H and V syncs).  Logo inserters  Logo inserters are devices used to insert a television station's logo, or other fixed graphics, into a live television signal.

In the most basic form, once puck possession changes, the left wing moves back in line with the defencemen. Each defender (including the left winger) plays a zone defence and is responsible for a third of the ice each. Since there are normally only two defencemen, this tactic helps to avoid odd man rushes. With the reinforced defensive line, the centre and right wing forecheck aggressively. Often the forecheckers will try to drive the puck over to the opponent's right wing. Under coach Scotty Bowman, the Detroit Red Wings began using \\"the lock\\" heavily during the 1994-95 NHL season, earning the President's Trophy for the league's best record during the regular season. The following season Detroit was even more dominant, finishing one point short of the NHL record for most points in a season by a team. However, the system broke down during the playoffs each year, especially as they were frustrated by the neutral zone trap strategy employed by Jacques Lemaire's New Jersey Devils in the 1995 Stanley Cup Finals. It was not until 1997 that Detroit broke through and finally matched their regular-season success with a Stanley Cup championship. Although \\"the lock\\" was made famous by the Red Wings and has been used to great success in their Stanley Cup runs in the past decade, they are not credited with inventing it. The \\"lock\\" was invented in Czechoslovakia to work against the dominant Soviet teams of the 1970s. A former assistant coach under Scotty Bowman, Barry Smith, was credited with seeing the left wing lock in Europe and bringing it back to the Red Wings.Barry Smith - Slap Shot Blog, New York Times The simplicity of \\"the lock\\" has made it popular at all levels of hockey and it is not uncommon to see it implemented in youth hockey.

Plot  Max Fleming is a graduate student who has developed a powerful cloning machine for the egotistical Dr. Jonas. Jonas steals all the credit and leaves Max to toil in obscurity. One day, Max meets Kate Carson, a young and attractive magazine reporter preparing a story on the cloning research at the university. During the interview, Kate accidentally cuts herself, and a few drops of her blood mingle with one of the cloning samples. Later that night, Max runs a test of the machine, and to his surprise he ends up with a replicant of Kate, which he names Repli-Kate. Repli-Kate is fully adult (being exactly the same age the original Kate is), but she has no knowledge. Max and his roommate Henry thus set out to educate her, but with a male perspective. They want to turn her into the perfect woman: the beer-drinking, sport-loving, sexually aggressive girl of their dreams. She also becomes Max's girlfriend as result. However, when Max contemplates the resulting woman, he realizes that the girl of his dreams was Kate all along, not Repli-Kate. Meanwhile, Dr. Jonas learns of the existence of Repli-Kate. He captures both her and the original Kate. He then decides to present the results of the human cloning in front of scientists from all over the world, with the aim of advertising \\"his\\" cloning machine. Max and Henry learn of Jonas's plan, and they formulate a rescue mission. Using a newly created Repli-Jonas, the pair are able to create enough confusion to save Kate and Repli-Kate. Jonas and Repli-Jonas are sent to a cloning research lab as test subjects. Max inherits the university's cloning lab, and his cloning chamber brings him great fame and money. Max and Kate fall in love, as do Henry and Repli-Kate. Repli-Jonas manages to escape, and when Felix asks Max about what to do, he replies that Repli-Jonas is too dumb to go anywhere. The last image is Repli-Jonas, who is the new president. His discourse is just the word 'penis'.

The clade Patellogastropoda is deemed monophyletic based on phylogenetic analysis. Taxonomy Patellogastropoda was proposed by David R. Lindberg, 1986, as an order, and was later included in the subclass Eogastropoda Ponder & Lindberg, 1996.Pina -Gastropoda  2005 taxonomy  Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005 designated Patellogastropoda, true limpets, as a clade, rather than as a taxon, but within included superfamilies and families as listed below. Families that are exclusively fossil are indicated with a dagger †: *Superfamily Patelloidea **Family Patellidae *Superfamily Nacelloidea **Family Nacellidae *Superfamily Lottioidea **Family Lottiidae **Family Acmaeidae Forbes, 1850 ***subfamily Acmaeinae Forbes, 1850 ***subfamily Pectinodontinae Pilsbry, 1891 ***subfamily Rhodopetalinae Lindberg, 1981 **Family Lepetidae *Superfamily Neolepetopsoidea **Family Neolepetopsidae ** † Family Daminilidae ** † Family Lepetopsidae With the exception of calling Patellogastropoda a clade rather than an order, as was previously the case in Ponder and Lindberg, 1997 the taxon has not changed much, differing more in the arrangement of its content rather than in the overall composition. Bouchet and Rocroi omitted Ponder and Lindberg's suborders, and added in the superfamily Neolepetopsoidea.  2007 taxonomy  Nakano & Ozawa (2007) made many changes in the taxonomy of the Patellogastropoda, based on molecular phylogeny research: Acmaeidae is a synonym of Lottiidae; Pectinodontinae is elevated to Pectinodontidae; new family Eoacmaeidae with the new type genus Eoacmaea is established. A cladogram based on sequences of mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA, 16S ribosomal RNA and cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) genes showing phylogenic relations of Patellogastropoda by Nakano & Ozawa (2007) and superfamilies based on World Register of Marine Species:Gofas, S.

However, two Neolepetosidae species Eulepetopsis vitrea and Paralepetopsis floridensis were previously analyzed by Harasewych & McArthur (2000), who confirmed their placement within Acmaeoidea/Lottioidea based on analysis of partial 18S rDNA. The Daminilidae and Lepetopsidae are also not included in the cladogram, because they are exclusively fossil families. All of these three families belong to superfamily Lottioidea. Actual taxonomy based on data by Nakano & Ozawa (2007) with placement of the three remaining families (Neolepetopsidae, Daminilidae, Lepetopsidae) into Lottioidea is like this: * superfamily Eoacmaeoidea ** family Eoacmaeidae * superfamily Patelloidea ** family Patellidae * superfamily Lottioidea ** family Nacellidae ** family Lepetidae ** family Pectinodontidae ** family Lottiidae ** family Neolepetopsidae ** † family Daminilidae ** † family Lepetopsidae In 2007, two years following Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005, Tomoyuki Nakano and Tomowo Ozawa referred to the order Patellogastropoda. Description Ventral view of Patella rustica showing its foot and head with tentacles. Patellogastropoda have flattened, cone-shaped shells, and the majority of species are commonly found adhering strongly to rocks or other hard substrates. Many limpet shells are covered in microscopic growths of green marine algae, which can make them even harder to see, as they can closely resemble the rock surface itself. The substance making up the teeth in the radula of limpets is among the strongest biological materials known, with a tensile strength about five times stronger than that of spider silk. The teeth are composed of goethite, an iron-based mineral, woven in a particular way into grouped 1μ thick bundles. Science recorder, Unassuming aquatic snail possesses the strongest teeth on Earth]N. W. Runham, P. R. Thornton, D. A. Shaw, R. C. Wayte The mineralization and hardness of the radular teeth of the limpet Patella vulgata L.; Zeitschrift für Zellforschung und Mikroskopische Anatomie 15. August 1969, Volume 99, Issue 4, pp 608-626 Many limpets create a home \\"scar\\" on the rock to which they always return between tides, the scar becoming a perfect fit even for the always growing cone-shaped shell and providing excellent protection from predators as well as helping to prevent dehydration, though dehydration remains one of the greatest risks to which these molluscs are exposed and may be why they only survive in temperate waters, not tropical ones where they simply become too hot during low tides. They adhere to the substratum via the adhesion/ suction of the stiffened foot against the rock surface to which it bonds each time with a layer of pedal mucus. The majority of limpet species have shells that are less than 3 in (8 cm) in maximum length and many are much smaller. Anatomy Internal anatomy without most musculature or circulatory information The true limpets have an internal structure much like that of other members of Mollusca. Their diffuse nervous system is oriented around three principal pairs of ganglia—the cerebral, pleural (which are hypoathroid), and pedal—located in the animal's snout and surrounding its esophagus in a ring. The pleural and pedal ganglia each send a nerve cord back through the rest of the body, the pleural nerve cords and the pedal or ventral nerve cords (the latter are embedded in the foot musculature in Patellagastropoda). Just outside the pedal ganglia are each of the two statocysts (though see Bathyacmaea secunda as an exception to this rule). Like the keyhole limpets, the true limpets have retained both kidneys though in Patellagastropoda the kidneys both lie on the animal's right side and the further right of the two— the \\"right\\" kidney— is much larger than the other. The right kidney also has a sponge-like texture whereas the left kidney is essentially a small sac into which hang folds from the sac's walls. They do not have ctenidia, instead obtaining oxygen through a ring of gill lamellae that encircle the mantle just inside the shell edge and from the surface of the roof of the nuchal cavity which is exposed to air when the animal is no longer under water and which is covered in a network of blood vessels all of which eventually carry oxygenated blood and connect to the auricle through a series of veinlets on the animal's left side. Vestigial ctenidia have been adapted into osphradial patches (one on each side of the mantle cavity) with which the animal can \\"smell\\". Their low dome-shaped shell is able to withstand the forces of turbulent intertidal water. Inside, the head bears two tentacles, each with a tiny black \\"eye spot\\" at its base (limpets can sense light but cannot see images with these eyes). The heart lies within a pericardium and is composed of a single (morphologically left) auricle, a single ventricle, and bulbous aorta which sends blood to both the anterior and posterior aortae. It lies near the surface of shell on the left, and opposite it on the right are three tubules or \\"papillae\\" in a row: that of the left kidney, the anus, and that of the right kidney: all three exit near the same place on the right posterior side inside the mantle cavity. Between these papillae and the heart lies the neural \\"visceral twist\\", a nervous condition called streptoneury or chiastoneury, which characterizes many molluscs and all gastropods whose ancient ancestor had an anus located posterior to its head but which now have it positioned much closer because of a change in the arrangement of the shell. In the evolutionary course of the relocation of the anus, the various ganglia posterior to the pleural and pedal ganglia had to conduct a twist— this means, for example, that the osphradium on the animal's left side is innervated through the right side of its body and vice versa. The condition is called streptoneury, but the phenomenon is known as torsion. In the Patellogastropoda, the twist is located directly behind (i.e., posterior to) the pleural ganglia; in other closely related groups (e.g., Zeugobranchia, Neritopsina, and Ampullariidae) the twist stretches backwards well into the visceral mass (digestive glands, intestines, gonad, etc.). The digestive gland and interweaving intestine occupy most of the visceral mass behind the head. At the posterior ventral end is the large gonad organ which, when ripe, bursts and empties its gametes into the right kidney from which they are then expelled directly into the surrounding water. One theory of the function of the osphradia is to sense the release of such gametes by other nearby patellogastropods, triggering a corresponding release in any proximate opposite-sex animals of the same species (see diagram for additional anatomic information). Distribution Representatives of the Patellogastropoda, true limpets, live on the rocky coasts of all oceans. Habitat Some true limpets live throughout the intertidal zone, from the high zone (upper littoral zone) to the shallow subtidal, but other species live in deep sea and their habitat include hydrothermal vents, whalebone (baleen), whale-fall and sulphide seeps.McLean J. H. (7 November 1990). \\"Neolepetopsidae, a new docoglossate limpet family from hydrothermal vents and its relevance to patellogastropod evolution\\". Journal of Zoology, London 222(3): 485-528, plates 1-12. . Neolepetopsidae is on the page 490. They attach themselves to the substrate using pedal mucus and a foot. They locomote using wave-like muscular contractions of the foot when conditions are suitable for them to graze. They can also \\"clamp down\\" against the rock surface with very considerable force when necessary, and this ability enables them to remain safely attached, despite the dangerous wave action on exposed rocky shores. The ability to clamp down also seals the shell edge against the rock surface, protecting them from desiccation during low tide, despite their being in full sunlight. When true limpets are fully clamped down, it is impossible to remove them from the rock using brute force alone, and the limpet will allow itself to be destroyed rather than stop clinging to its rock. This survival strategy has led to the limpet being used as a metaphor for obstinacy or stubbornness. Life habits Feeding Most limpets feed by grazing on algae which grows on the rock (or other surfaces) where they live. They scrape up films of algae with a radula, a ribbon-like tongue with rows of teeth. Limpets move by rippling the muscles of their foot in a wave-like motion. In some parts of the world, certain smaller species of true limpet are specialized to live on seagrasses and graze on the microscopic algae which grow there. Other species live on, and graze directly on, the stipes (stalks) of brown algae (kelp). Homing behaviour Patella vulgata in Pembrokeshire, Wales. Some species of limpets return to the same spot on the rock known as a \\"home scar\\" just before the tide recedes. In such species, the shape of their shell often grows to precisely match the contours of the rock surrounding the scar. This behaviour presumably allows them to form a better seal to the rock and may help protect them from both predation and desiccation. It is still unclear how limpets find their way back to the same spot each time, but it is thought that they follow pheromones in the mucus left as they move. Other species, notably Lottia gigantea seem to \\"garden\\" a patch of algae around their home scar. They are one of the few invertebrates to exhibit territoriality and will aggressively push other organisms out of this patch by ramming with their shell, thereby allowing their patch of algae to grow for their own grazing. Predators and other risks  Limpets are preyed upon by a variety of organisms including starfish, shore-birds, fish, seals, and humans. Limpets exhibit a variety of defenses, such as fleeing or clamping their shells against the substratum. The defense response can be determined by the type of predator, which can often be detected chemically by the limpet. Limpets can be long lived, with tagged specimens surviving for more than 10 years. If the limpet lives on bare rock, it grows at a slower rate but can live for up to 20 years. Limpets found on exposed shores, which have fewer rock pools than sheltered shores and are thus in less frequent contact with water, have a greater risk of desiccation due to the effects of increased sunlight, water evaporation and the increased wind speed. To avoid drying out they will clamp to the rock they inhabit, minimizing water-loss from the rim around their base. As this occurs chemicals are released that promote the vertical growth of the limpet's shell. Reproduction Spawning occurs once a year, usually during winter, and is triggered by rough seas which disperse the eggs and sperm. Larvae float around for a couple of weeks before settling onto a hard substrate. Human use bap (limpet rice) Ttagaebi-kal-guksu (limpet noodle soup) Larger limpet species are, or were historically, cooked and eaten in many different parts of the world. For example, in Hawaii, limpets (Cellana species) are commonly known as ‘opihi, and are considered a delicacy; the meat sells for $25 - $42 a pound (454g). In Portugal, limpets are known as lapas and are also considered to be a delicacy. In Chile they are also called \\"lapas\\" but are so abundant that it's just considered a regular dish. Within Gaelic Scotland and Ireland, a limpet is known as a báirnach, and Martin Martin recorded (on Jura) limpets being boiled to use in a substitute for breast milk. In Ulleungdo, a Korean island, limpets are called ttagaebi () and are used to make ttagaebi-bap (limpet rice) and ttagaebi-kal-guksu (limpet noodle soup) References  External links  Category:Gastropod taxonomy ","title":"Patellogastropoda"},{"id":"4280936","text":"Cayuga Creek is a small stream in western New York, United States, with stretches in both Erie County and Wyoming County.

The mall, originally developed by the Joseph Meyerhoff Company of Baltimore, opened October 1, 1962 as a , open-air complex of 60 stores and services.New Kendall wing brings trendy twist to Dadeland Mall, Iva Paiva Cordle, July 14, 2013, http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/07/14/3497931/new-kendall-wing-brings- trendy.html Dadeland Mall is located between South Dixie Highway (US-1) and the Palmetto Expressway (SR 826) at its southern terminus where it meets US-1. It is also served by the Dadeland North Metrorail station, which has a pedestrian walkway connecting to the mall. The Dadeland South station is located just south of the mall. History Originally an open-air center, the mall was anchored by Burdine's (spelled with an apostrophe at the time), and also boasted a Food Fair grocery, full-service Gray Drug and the Summit Restaurant, Lounge and Cafeteria (later known as The Forum). A Jordan Marsh anchor store was added to the west end, which opened in November 1966. A massive construction project, initiated in late 1969, doubled the size of the mall by twinning it (leaving the huge Burdine's in the middle), and adding a wing of fully enclosed retail onto the east end. Moreover, the existing courts and concourses were fully enclosed and air-conditioned. Another feature of this expansion was the King of the Mall, an enormous Burger King (whose corporate headquarters were then located across from Dadeland on North Kendall Drive). This renovation project was completed with the opening of JCPenney, the mall's new east anchor store, in early 1971. The mall attained notoriety as the site of a 1979 drug-related shooting spree during Miami's \\"Cocaine Cowboys\\" era. In broad daylight, two gunmen exited a paneled truck, entered a liquor store and gunned down two men, wounding the store clerk. The dead men were eventually identified as a Colombia-based cocaine trafficker and his bodyguard. On December 3, 1981 a 13 month old boy was found behind the mall, after having gone missing four days earlier, around three miles away. His parents, Alfonso Jesus Arrubla, a former M-19 guerrilla turned drug dealer and his wife María Eugenia Delgado were killed along with four others at their Southwest Dade townhouse. A third expansion, undertaken in early 1983, added Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor to the south-facing front of the complex. A food court had also opened, in the shuttered Pantry Pride (former Food Fair) supermarket, in 1982. A subsequent renovation, completed in September 1987, saw the interior of the mall updated, with its early 1960s animal statues being removed. The modern smooth colored concrete animals and geometric slides were donated to Miami-Dade County and can be seen in Dante Fascell Park in South Miami and at the Miami-Dade County children's day care center play yard to the east of Jackson Memorial Hospital. Lord & Taylor closed their location in 2004 citing market conditions. It became Nordstrom the same year. One of the unique trademarks of the shopping complex is the concrete tower with a giant \\"D\\" (for Dadeland) at the top. This local landmark was there from the beginning. The photo at the right shows it in its original aqua color. Through the 1980s and some of the '90s the tower was painted white but is now aqua again. Another expansion was added in 1991, an 80,000 square foot building occupied by six Limited Brands concepts including three-level flagship The Limited and Express stores. Dadeland Mall today Today, Dadeland is managed by the Indianapolis-based Simon Property Group, who purchased 50% of the center in 1997. Morgan Stanley owns the other 50%. The anchors include Florida's largest Macy's (Macy's Florida's flagship store), as well as Macy's Home Gallery & Kids (the west end anchor), JCPenney, and Saks Fifth Avenue. Former tenants of the west end anchor space, currently occupied by the Macy's Home Gallery & Kids, were Jordan Marsh (1966-1991) and Burdines Home Store (1993-2005), which was eventually to be taken over by Mervyns with Dillard's as another bidder, but these stores didn't take over the space. Former tenants of the southeast end anchor space were Lord & Taylor (1983-2004) and Nordstrom (2004-2020) and is now vacant. Dadeland Mall's largest restaurants are Villagio and The Cheesecake Factory. The outer part of the mall, particularly the original main entrance, was featured in the 1985 Chuck Norris film Invasion U.S.A. The inside and outside of the mall was featured in the 1990 Alec Baldwin film Miami Blues. The mall has been remodeled since both of those films however. In the late 1990s, talks were underway about adding a second floor to the entire mall. This project will once again double the malls space plus add second floor access to the anchor stores all of which already have second floors. In 2011, The Limited/Express wing closed down. The following year, the wing was demolished to accommodate a new two-story mall expansion that opened April 2013 with various restaurants on the second level and multiple new shops on the first level, including a dining terrace on the second level's exterior facing Southwest 88th Street. On the first floor, there is a corridor dubbed the \\"Fashion Runway.\\" On May 11, 2020 Nordstrom announced that they would be permanently closing its store by August 2020.

For example, the tendency for one cell to glide only when in direct contact with another results in the colony forming swarms called \\"wolf-packs\\" that may measure up to several inches wide. This behavior is advantageous to the members of the swarm, as it increases the concentration of extracellular digestive enzymes secreted by the bacteria, thus facilitating predatory feeding. Likewise, during stressful conditions, the bacteria undergo a process in which about 100,000 individual cells aggregate to form a structure called the fruiting body over the course of several hours. On the interior of the fruiting body, the rod-shaped cells differentiate into spherical, thick-walled spores. They undergo changes in the synthesis of new proteins, as well as alterations in the cell wall, which parallel the morphological changes. During these aggregations, dense ridges of cells move in ripples, which wax and wane over 5 hours.  Motility  Social motility leads to a spatial distribution of cells with many clusters and few isolated single cells. An important part of M. xanthus behavior is its ability to move on a solid surface by a mechanism called \\"gliding\\". Gliding Motility is a method of locomotion that allows for movement, without the help of flagella, on a solid surface. Gliding Motility is separated into two groups for the M. xanthus: A-motility (adventurous) and S-motility (social). In A motility, single cells move, resulting in a distribution with many single cells. In S motility, single cells do not move, but cells that are close to one another move. This leads to a spatial distribution of cells with many clusters and few isolated single cells. More than 37 genes are involved in the A-motility system, which comprises multiple motor elements that are arrayed along the entire cell body. Each motor element appears to be localized to the periplasmic space and is bound to the peptidoglycan layer. The motors are hypothesized to move on helical cytoskeletal filaments. Gliding force generated by these motors is coupled to adhesion sites that move freely in the outer membrane, and which provide a specific contact with the substratum, possibly aided by extracellular polysaccharide slime. S-motility may represent a variation of twitching motility, since it is mediated by the extension and retraction of type IV pili that extend through the leading cell pole. The genes of the S-motility system appear to be homologs of genes involved in the biosynthesis, assembly, and function of twitching motility in other bacteria.  Cell differentiation, fruiting and sporulation  In the presence of prey (here E. coli), M. xanthus cells self-organize into periodic bands of traveling waves, termed ripples (left-hand side). In the areas without prey, M. xanthus cells are under nutrient stress and as a result self-organize into haystack-shaped, spore-filled structures termed fruiting bodies (right-hand side, yellow mounds). In response to starvation, myxobacteria develop species-specific multicellular fruiting bodies. Starting from a uniform swarm of cells, some aggregate into fruiting bodies, while other cells remain in a vegetative state. Those cells that participate in formation of the fruiting body transform from rods into spherical, heat-resistant myxospores, while the peripheral cells remain rod-shaped. Although not as tolerant to environmental extremes as, say, Bacillus endospores, the relative resistance of myxospores to desiccation and freezing enables myxobacteria to survive seasonally harsh environments. When a nutrient source becomes once again available, the myxospores germinate, shedding their spore coats to emerge into rod-shaped vegetative cells. The synchronized germination of thousands of myxospores from a single fruiting body enables the members of the new colony of myxobacteria to immediately engage in cooperative feeding.  Intercellular communication  It is very likely that cells communicate during the process of fruiting and sporulation, because a group of cells that starved together form myxospores inside fruiting bodies. Intercellular signal appears to be necessary to ensure that sporulation happens in the proper place and at the proper time. Research supports the existence of an extracellular signal, A-factor, which is necessary for developmental gene expression and for the development of a complete fruiting body.  Ability to eavesdrop  It has been shown that an M. xanthus swarm is capable of eavesdropping on the extracellular signals that are produced by the bacteria it preys upon, leading to changes in swarm behaviour increasing its efficiency as a predator. This allows for a highly adaptive physiology that will have likely contributed to the near ubiquitous distribution of the myxobacteria  Importance in research  The complex life cycles of the myxobacteria make them very attractive models for the study of gene regulation as well as cell to cell interactions. The traits of M. xanthus make it very easy to study, and therefore important to research. Laboratory strains of M. xanthus are available that are capable of planktonic growth in shaker culture, so that they are easy to grow in large numbers. The tools of classical and molecular genetics are relatively well-developed in M. xanthus. Although the fruiting bodies of M. xanthus are relatively primitive compared with, say, the elaborate structures produced by Stigmatella aurantiaca and other myxobacteria, the great majority of genes known to be involved in development are conserved across species. In order to make agar cultures of M. xanthus grow into fruiting bodies, one simply can plate the bacteria on starvation media. Furthermore, it is possible to artificially induce the production of myxospores without the intervening formation of fruiting bodies, by adding compounds such as glycerol or various metabolites to the medium. In this way, different stages in the developmental cycle can be experimentally isolated. The genome of M. xanthus has been completely sequenced. The size of its genome may reflect the complexity of its life cycle. At 9.14 megabase, it had the largest known prokaryotic genome until the sequencing of Sorangium cellulosum (12.3 Mb), which is also a myxobacterium.  Developmental cheating  Social cheating exists among M. xanthus commonly. As long as mutants are not too common, if they are unable to perform the group beneficial function of producing spores, they will still reap the benefit of the population as a whole. Research has shown that 4 different types of M. xanthus mutants showed forms of cheating during development, by being over-represented among spores relative to their initial frequency in the mixture.  Evolution  In 2003, two scientists, Velicer and Yu, deleted certain parts of the M. xanthus genome, making it unable to swarm effectively on soft agar. Individuals were cloned, and allowed to evolve. After a period of 64 weeks, two of the evolving populations had started to swarm outward almost as effectively as normal wild- type colonies. However, the patterns of the swarm were very different from those of the wild-type bacteria. This suggested that they had developed a new way of moving, and Velicer and Yu confirmed this by showing that the new populations had not regained the ability to make pili, which allows wild-type bacteria to swarm. This study addressed questions about the evolution of cooperation between individuals that had plagued scientists for years. Very little is known about the evolutionary mechanisms present in M.xanthus. However, it has been discovered that it can establish a generalist predator relationship with different prey, among which is Escherichia coli. In this predator-prey relationship, a parallel evolution of both species is observed through genomic and phenotypic modifications, producing in subsequent generations a better adaptation of one of the species that is counteracted by the evolution of the other, following a co-evolutionary model known Red Queen hypothesis. However, the evolutionary mechanisms present in M.xanthus that produce this parallel evolution are still unknown.Nair, Ramith R.; Vasse, Marie; Wielgoss, Sébastien; Sun, Lei; Yu, Yuen-Tsu N.; Velicer, Gregory J. \\"Bacterial predator-prey coevolution accelerates genome evolution and selects on virulence-associated prey defences\\", Nature Communications, 2019, 10:4301.

Though, initially, employment of Logistics Officers in the Royal Navy remained broadly the same, it has begun to reflect exposure to the 'tri-service' environment, including a significantly greater number of operational logistics posts, as well as the more traditional Cash, Pay and Records, and 'outer-office' or Aide de Camp duties. The Logistics Branch in the Royal Navy is one of the three main branches of the Senior Service, though due to its unique nature has interaction with all branches of the Naval Service, including the Fleet Air Arm and the Royal Marines, as well as the Defence Equipment and Support Organisation, the Ministry of Defence and many other agencies and organisations. In centuries past, the supply officer had been known as the clerk, bursar, purser and, later, the paymaster. Logistics officers are still generally referred to by the historic sobriquet 'pusser', a derivation of 'purser'. History Purser and secretary At first, the business-man and shop-keeper – later to become responsible for pay as well – this officer was first mentioned as a regular member of a ship's company in one of the King's Ships in the fourteenth century. Later known as the clerk and then bursar in the Royal Navy, the name of this warrant officer soon changed to Purser. In the early days, the purser was a privileged shop-keeper on board ship and, as such, the profession was guilty of many malpractices. Samuel Pepys said of the Purser \\"A purser without professed cheating is a professed loser.\\" By the end of the seventeenth century, a new post of captain's clerk was ordained and all Pursers had to pass through this office; this resulted in promotion to the post of Purser largely resting with ship's captains. Gradually, the status of the Purser rose and he received the uniform of a Warrant Officer in 1787 and a distinctive uniform in 1805. The oldest man in the British fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805, was the Purser of Nelson's flagship, HMS Victory, Limerick-born Purser Walter Burke, then 69; he survived a further ten years, dying in September 1815 and his gravestone is in Wouldham churchyard, Kent. Admiral Nelson's secretary, John Scott, was killed at Trafalgar; his body was sliced in two by a cannonball, while he was talking with Captain Hardy on the quarterdeck, and his body parts were thrown over the side. In 1808 the senior warrant officers – the Purser, the Master (later Navigating Lieutenant) and Surgeon – were officially recognized as \\"Warrant Officer of wardroom rank\\". It had long been the custom for Royal Navy Flag Officers to select as their secretaries \\"pursers of talent and approved character\\" and the Purser's other role as a Secretary was generally formalised by 1816. The Purser became formally responsible in 1825 for the payment of the ship's company. Paymaster The title of purser transformed into the \\"purser and paymaster\\" in 1842, and the warrant officer rank was elevated to commissioned officer in 1843. The title of Purser finally disappeared in 1852 and he became the Paymaster. In 1855 the status of these officers was clarified by Order in Council. They were to be \\"Accountant officers for cash to the Accountant-General of the Navy ...\\" and the ranks of assistant paymaster, clerk, and assistant clerk emerged. In 1864, these officers were authorised to wear a white strip of distinction cloth between the gold rings on their arms. By 1867, it was laid down that a Paymaster of 15 years' seniority should rank with a commander and in 1886 followed the distinction between fleet paymaster (ranking with commander) and staff paymaster (ranking with Lieutenants of 8 years' seniority). A paymaster-in- chief ranked with a four-stripe captain. In March 1918 a paymaster-in-chief was appointed paymaster director-general and, on 8 November 1918, the then paymaster director-general, William Whyte, was given the rank and style of paymaster rear-admiral. At the same time, the branch's other ranks were standardized: a paymaster-in-chief became paymaster captain; fleet paymaster became paymaster commander; staff paymaster became paymaster lieutenant- commander; paymaster became paymaster lieutenant; assistant paymaster became paymaster sub-lieutenant; clerk became paymaster midshipman and assistant clerk became paymaster cadet. Paymaster rear-admiral was established as a rank in its own right by Order in Council of 20 December 1918 applied retroactively to 6 March 1918. Supply officer On 26 October 1944 the whole accountant branch name was changed from paymaster to supply and secretariat, and the word paymaster was dropped from its place in front of the rank, e.g. a paymaster commander became a commander (S). Thus, in late 1944, the supply officer came into being (see – page 302>). As with their paymaster predecessors, supply officers were employed, ashore and afloat, as a ship's supply officer, with responsibility for ratings from the writer branch (see ), the stores and victualling branches, cooks and officers' stewards and, if borne, the NAAFI canteen manager. They were also employed, ashore and afloat, as admiral's secretary, commodore's secretary and captain's secretary. It was not uncommon for a secretary to follow the same senior officer from one post to the next and, sometimes, a secretary in the substantive rank of lieutenant-commander would be promoted acting commander and then temporary captain – thus, such a lieutenant-commander would be listed as temporary acting captain. Lists, promotion and entry With the formation of the Royal Navy's General List (GL) in 1956, supply officers no longer wore the white distinction cloth between the gold lace on their uniform and became indistinguishable from officers of the executive branch or the engineering branches. However, pursers in the British Merchant Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary continue to wear a white distinction cloth. The General List (GL) of 1956 standardized the promotion opportunities of its officers, regardless of branch, although there remained some minor differences. Thus, a Lieutenant of eight-year's seniority was automatically promoted to lieutenant-commander, with retirement generally at age 50 unless promoted to a higher rank; and for supply officers, commanders were selected from lieutenant-commanders of at least three-and-a-half-year's seniority, and retired at age 53; captains were promoted from among commanders with at least six years in the rank. captains retired on reaching nine-year's seniority in the rank, or at age 55, whichever was the earlier, unless selected for promotion to rear-admiral. Commodore was, until 1996, reserved for a few senior appointments but is now a formal rank achieved by selection from captain. GL supply officers were thus able to serve in a much wider range of appointments, such as shore command, naval attaché, intelligence; indeed none of the posts held by the six serving supply officer admirals in 1991 would have been open to a pusser before 1956. The substantive rank of Lieutenant-Commander had been formally introduced in March 1914. However, in 1875, Senior Lieutenants of eight years' standing began to be distinguishable to the naked eye from his more junior brother; he was, in that year, allowed to add to his full dress uniform the now well-known \\"half-stripe\\" of quarter- inch gold lace between the two distinctive rings of half-inch braid which the ordinary Lieutenant wore, and by 1877 he could wear it in undress uniform too. \\"Senior Lieutenant\\" had thus become a rank in all but name. From 1914, promotion to Lieutenant-Commander was automatic on reaching eight years' seniority as a Lieutenant though, in around the year 2000, this has changed and the \\"half-stripe\\" is now achieved only by selection. Supply branch ratings had, in common with ratings from other branches of the Royal Navy, long been offered the opportunity of promotion from the lower deck. There were two avenues of receiving a commission. The Upper Yardman scheme (entering Britannia Royal Naval College (BRNC), Dartmouth, Devon, as a Cadet or Midshipman, under terms similar to those direct from civilian life) was open to those supply branch ratings under the age of about 25. Such ratings were called CW candidates, and they were specially reported on for selection to attend the Admiralty Interview Board before final selection for promotion and entry to BRNC. The second avenue of promotion from rating to commissioned officer was to the Special Duties (SD) List. Petty officers and chief petty officers could, with the approval of their commanding officer, become a CW candidate (an 'SD candidate') and such supply branch senior ratings were similarly specially reported on with a view to promotion to officer, generally between the ages of 28 and 35, though most were in their early 30s when promoted to acting sub-lieutenant on the Special Duties List. Unlike GL and SL (see below) officers, SD officers retained their former rating branch specialisation; for example the supply officer (cash) of a large warship or shore establishment would typically be a lieutenant (SD)(S)(W), the (W) indicating that he is a commissioned officer from the Writer branch of ratings. SD officers were, of course, promoted from all supply branches – writer (W), stores assistant/accountant (S) or (V), cook (CK), officer's steward/steward or caterer (CA). Once confirmed as a Sub-lieutenant, an SD officer was promoted lieutenant after three years; promotion to lieutenant- commander (SD) was by selection and, from these, a very small number were promoted to commander from 1966 onwards. Retirement was generally compulsory at age 50. A few SD officers were further selected for transfer to the General List, seniority being adjusted on transfer, so as to level the promotion opportunities (generally these officers were earmarked as likely to reach the rank of commander). In the 1970s, to make up for certain branch shortages, some chief petty officers, age over 35, from the supply branch were selected and promoted temporary acting sub-lieutenant (SD), a few of whom were later promoted to temporary lieutenant (SD). By the 1980s, supply officers were no longer necessarily being appointed according to the List they were on (GL, SD or SL); it was not uncommon to find, in different ships in the same squadron or flotilla, a pusser in supply charge from each List. Prior to the introduction of the Special Duties List in 1956, some senior ratings were selected for promotion to Warrant Officer on the Branch List, with subsequent possible promotion (from 1864) to Commissioned Warrant Officer; from 1946, officer rank was achieved by commission rather than by warrant. Of the old \\"standing officers\\" (the master, boatswain, gunner and carpenter) from the days of sail, the cook was the first to lose his status as a full-blown warrant officer and head of his own department; indeed, an order of 1704 helped him in his downward career as, in future, in the appointment of cooks, the Navy Board was \\"to give the preference to such cripples and maimed persons as are pensioners of the chest at Chatham\\". Warrant officers lived in a separate mess – the gunroom – from Wardroom officers and, by the 1800s, wore one thin stripe of gold sleeve lace with, from 1864, for supply branch officers, the white distinction cloth below. The warrant officer's dress uniform was instituted in 1787. In all other respects they were treated as for commissioned officers. A commissioned warrant officer wore the same sleeve lace as a sub-lieutenant – one gold stripe proper; these officers lived in the Wardroom mess. Between the 1950s and 1990s, recruitment targets for supply officers were generally met, no doubt owing in part to the slightly lower standards for eyesight – executive officers were not recruited if they needed any corrective lenses but supply officers were. Thus there was no real need for a Supplementary List (SL) of supply officers and it was not until 1966 that the Admiralty Board introduced a scheme for SL supply officers. Even then, SL(S) was exclusively for a maximum of three supply branch ratings each year on the Upper Yardman scheme; there was no direct recruitment from civilians as a Supplementary List pusser, though this appears to have been introduced in the 1990s. Supplementary List officers were offered 10-year short-service commissions, with the opportunity to extend to 16 years and beyond, should the exigencies of the Service require; promotion to lieutenant- commander (SL)(S) was by selection and only one officer from this scheme was promoted to commander (SL)(S) – commander J R (Russ) Cameron on 1 October 1993. SL supply officers, like other branch SL officers, were afforded the opportunity to transfer to the General List by selection. As at 31 March 1996, there were 575 supply officers, male and female, of all lists and ranks, from midshipman to rear-admiral, serving in the Royal Navy (source: The Navy List 1996 (HMSO)). Three were rear-admirals, 26 captain (S) and 85 commander (S) and some 28 (lieutenants (S) and above) were qualified as barristers. In 1998, the General, Special Duties and Supplementary Lists were abolished, all officers being on one, common, List. The Navy List of 2006 lists 581 Logistics Officers, of whom 131 are women: there is one rear-admiral, 3 commodores, 20 captains, 97 commanders, 154 lieutenant-commanders, 249 lieutenants, 56 sub- lieutenants and one midshipman; 78 of the male officers had qualified as a submariner and 26 of the branch as barristers. There were 500 Logistics Officers serving (all ranks, both genders) on 1 April 2013, some 12.4% of the 6,180 officers of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines. Supply officer renamed logistics officer In early 2004 the supply officer became the logistics officer, though the function is largely unchanged. The careers page on the Royal Navy's website in 2006 described the duties: > \\"As a Logistics Officer you will play an essential role in the overall > logistics support for the Royal Navy, whether at war, reacting to an > international crisis, protecting offshore resources or taking part in search > and rescue missions.

Supply officers in other navies The Royal Australian Navy and the Royal New Zealand Navy both have supply officers who are broadly similar in employment to those of the Royal Navy and the Royal Canadian Logistics Service is also a sister branch. For some history of the United States Navy equivalents, visit and see Navy Supply Corps. Naval slang for the supply officer Naval slang has produced a variety of names for the Supply Officer. When in \\"supply charge\\" he/she is called the \\"Pusser\\" (a contraction of \\"Purser\\") and the term \\"Pusser\\" is used as an adjective, in a variety of contexts, to refer to something that is strictly disciplined, or Service, such as \\"Pusser's issue\\" and \\"Pusser's rum\\". Also, a Supply Officer may be referred to as the \\"SO\\" and he/she is sometimes described as belonging to the \\"white mafia\\" (referring to the historic white distinction cloth worn until 1956). Rather less common now is the nickname \\"Pay\\" (being short for Paymaster) and its lower-deck equivalent of \\"Paybob\\". Those supply officers appointed as a Secretary to an admiral or captain may be referred to as \\"Sec\\", \\"Inky Fingers\\" or \\"Scratch\\" (from the scratching of his/her pen). In the classic film In Which We Serve (1942), Captain D's secretary, a Lieutenant-Commander, appears in the opening frames; in the credits actor John Varley is listed as \\"Secco\\". Life as a paymaster and supply officer One paymaster cadet's account of life on board in 1938–1939, and some of his subsequent career, can be found at . The career of Captain (S) Hugh Rump (1901–1992) gives an idea of a pusser's career in the Royal Navy from 1919–1955 and can be found at . During the First Battle of Narvik, in the Norway campaign, the destroyer leader HMS Hardy (captain Bernard Warburton-Lee RN) was attacked by German destroyers in Ofotfjord on 10 April 1940, and captain (D) was seriously wounded and most other officers were killed. Captain (D)'s secretary, paymaster lieutenant Geoffrey H. Stanning survived and he awoke from the fearful blast to find his spine and legs badly injured by shrapnel, the ship out of control and heading for the shore at thirty knots. Since the wheel house was below him and nobody was answering his increasingly desperate orders to put the wheel over, he managed to drag himself down a ladder to the wheel house and alter course, enough to stop hitting the shore. When he regained the bridge helped by some seamen, he saw that they were now heading for two German destroyers. Since he could not slow down he decided to ram one of them. Luckily for all those left alive on board, whilst he was deciding which one to have a go at, one of the boilers was hit and the engines ground to a halt. All the forward guns on the Hardy were by now inoperable, but one of the stern guns was still banging away at the Germans who naturally returned fire into the burning wreck. Luckily the Hardy still had some 'way' on her which allowed Stanning to manoeuvre her into Vidrek where she ran aground. As she glided ashore still blazing furiously Stanning gave the order to abandon ship. One hundred and forty men plunged into the icy water, and in between the shell bursts from the German destroyers, managed to clamber to safety on the shore. Captain Warburton-Lee was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross and paymaster lieutenant Stanning the DSO. (Source: and the Supplement to the London Gazette of 1 July 1947 – see ). Training and employment since 1950 Owing to a shortage of Fleet Air Arm pilots in the 1950s, four supply officers qualified as fixed-wing pilots; both Brian Brown and Andrew Richmond rose to flag rank in the 1980s. There was a similar, but short-lived, scheme in the late 1960s when at least three supply officers were trained as helicopter aircrew; at least one \\"pusser pilot\\" served in a number of flying appointments. The three-month junior supply officers' course (JSOC) was undertaken, certainly from 1973, by all junior supply officers before their first appointment; this became the initial logistics officers' course (maritime) – ILOC (M) – in January 2004. From May 1963, the three-month supply charge course (SCC) prepared senior lieutenants for their first appointment as supply officer (head of department) in a destroyer, frigate or ocean-going survey ship (the supply officer was often the junior head of department); SCC became the advanced logistics officers course (maritime) – ALOC(M)) – in January 2004 and the professional logistics command course (maritime) – PLCC(M) – in September 2010. All training takes place at what was the Royal Naval Supply School (RNSS), since 2004 the Defence Maritime Logistics School (DMLS). The first WRNS officer was appointed to SCC in April 1980 and civilian officers of the RNSTS or Director General Supply and Transport (Navy) civil servants were occasional students, sometimes going to sea for a short familiarization afterwards. Typically, in the 1970s and 1980s, a commando carrier such as would have nine Supply Officers on board led by a commander (S), including two borne for the duties of captain's secretary – a lieutenant-commander and captain's assistant secretary – a lieutenant or sub-lieutenant. A guided missile destroyer had three supply officers on board, one as captain's secretary, and a Leander-class frigate, survey ship and nuclear submarine just the one Supply Officer in \\"supply charge\\", usually a senior Lieutenant (S), with a junior seaman officer given the additional role of \\"correspondence officer\\". A frigate squadron leader had a lieutenant- commander as squadron supply officer and a junior lieutenant or sub-lieutenant as captain's secretary. Supply officers rarely served in ships with a ship's company of fewer than 100. some supply branch captains and commodores have been appointed in command of large naval shore establishments such as , , and . In the 1980s, one former submariner supply officer served successfully as first lieutenant (executive officer) of a frigate. From 2004–2007, lieutenant- commander (commander from 2006) Heber Ackland served as equerry to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Barristers Unlike the other armed forces, the Royal Navy has no separate uniformed legal branch. The Director Naval Legal Services (DNLS) is the Navy's senior lawyer. A few Supply Officers are trained as barristers and one Captain (S) serves as Chief Naval Judge Advocate (CNJA). In the Navy List 2006, 26 male and female logistics officers were listed as Barristers. Although much of their time can be spent in criminal cases at courts martial, military lawyers are also required in all major operational theatres as legal advisers to the commanding admiral or general. The Navy legal service also covers employment law, liability of public authorities and the drafting of Acts of Parliament. As of 2010, service lawyers could expect to rejoin their original branch of service every few years (e.g. Naval ships, Royal Marine Commandos), to maintain a sense of balance. In 1979 the then CNJA (captain David Williamson) was invited to sit in the Crown Court as a deputy circuit judge (later the title became deputy recorder). Others followed in his trail and some continued judicial activity after their retirement from the Active List of the Royal Navy. By the mid-1990s, two captains (S) and a commander (S) who retired from the Royal Navy were appointed as civilian circuit judges: His Honour Judge [Shaun] Lyons, His Honour Judge [John L] Sessions and His Honour Judge [A G Y (Tony)] Thorpe; His Honour Judge Robert Fraser was appointed a Circuit Judge on his retirement as Commodore in 2007. Officers from other Naval branches have also trained as barristers. Commander Maxwell Hendry Maxwell-Anderson, formerly a navigating lieutenant, was counsel for the Admiralty in the Prize court during World War I, dealing with prize money cases arising from the sinking of enemy ships. He was Chief Justice of Fiji from 1929 to 1936, while still serving on the retired list. Additional duties at sea With the advent of flight decks in destroyers, frigates and ocean survey ships built in the 1960s and subsequently, it became common for supply officers in these ships to be trained as ship's flight deck officers, responsible for helicopter landing and take-off, though this is no longer the case; logistics officers' 'war-role' is now solely as damage control officer (DCO), with control of the ship's fire-main and manpower deployed to fight fires or control floods. Other additional duties performed by supply officers include those of watchkeeping officers in nuclear submarines and damage control section-base officers. Admirals and head of branch – and a purser pusser Only two Supply Officers have ever been promoted to the rank of 'full' admiral. Retiring as chief of fleet support in 1977, Admiral Sir Peter White GBE (born 1919) was promoted on 28 June 1976, becoming the first of the branch to be appointed to the Admiralty Board. He had a most appropriate surname for the first four-star pusser, given the colour of the distinction cloth worn historically by his branch. Admiral Sir Brian Brown KCB, CBE was promoted to that rank on 26 August 1989. Happily, there has been at least one serving Supply Officer with the surname Purser – Benjamin Purser was promoted lieutenant-commander in July 1973. While there have also certainly been supply officers with the surname of Cook, perhaps the surnames Beauclerk, Bezant, Cater, Clark(e)/Clerk(e), Pay, Purves/Purvis, Scriven(er), Steward and Storer have been those of supply officers, too, over the centuries. Twelve supply officers and one logistics officer rose to the rank of substantive vice- admiral (see list of admirals below), of whom two were further promoted to admiral; two others were promoted to acting/vice-admiral in the late 1940s. In recent decades, among the officers of flag rank in the Royal Navy, at any one time one, two or three supply officers have been rear-admirals. One of these two-star officers is appointed chief naval supply and secretariat officer (CNSSO) – now CNLO – as head of branch; however, there was no admiral in the Logistics Branch from 2008–2010 and the senior officer branch was a commodore. Rear-admiral David Steel, a barrister, was promoted to two-star rank on 20 April 2010 and became naval secretary and chief naval logistics officer (CNLO); he was promoted to vice-admiral in October 2012 on becoming Second Sea Lord, only the second officer from the branch to hold that post. A commander of the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) is head of the RNR Logistics Branch. Women Women officers in the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS) would often serve ashore as a captain's secretary but rarely as a Supply Officer. After the disbanding of the WRNS in 1993, women were fully integrated into the Royal Navy's supply branch, with the wearing of gold stripes instead of blue stripes; for female naval Supply Officers, service at sea, as well as ashore, started to become the norm. Indeed, Commodore Carolyn Stait OBE FCIPD was the naval base commander, Clyde in from 2004 to 2007. Defence Maritime Logistics School, RN Logistics School and RN Supply School – history The present Defence Maritime Logistics School (DMLS) (see ), (until September 2006 the Royal Naval Logistics School (RNLS)) – the alma mater of Logistics Officers and ratings – is a lodger unit within HMS Raleigh in Torpoint, Cornwall PL11 2PD. Functionally however, the school exists as a 'franchise' of the Defence College of Logistics and Personnel Administration, whose headquarters reside in Deepcut, Surrey. The Commandant of the DMLS is Commander Suzi Nielsen RN. From 1 April 1958 to 1983 the RN Supply School (RNSS) was in HMS Pembroke, Chatham, Kent ME4 4UH. Previously the RNSS was in Thorp Arch, Wetherby, Yorkshire, the training establishment being known as HMS Ceres from 1 October 1946 to 31 March 1958 (see and ) and before that as HMS Demetrius, which had commissioned on 15 July 1944 as the Accountant Branch school. The school had transferred from its former wartime home in Highgate School, London N6, where it had been established as HMS President V since being requisitioned and commissioned on 1 November 1941 as the training school for Accountant Branch ratings. The boys of Highgate School had been evacuated from London owing to The Blitz. (Thorp Arch became a borstal when the Navy left in 1958 and it is now known as HM Young Offenders' Institution, Wetherby, LS22 5ED). Prizes and awards There are some naval examination prizes available to supply officers. The Gedge Medal and Prize was instituted in about 1928 and is awarded annually to the student who has obtained the highest aggregate of marks in their academic examinations in the current year.

C. Greenburg and published by Random House from 2002 to 2008. It features a boy inventor named Andrew Dubble whose inventions rarely work the way he expects them to. There are 18 books in the series and they constitute five complete stories, each released consecutively. The chapter books were illustrated by Debbie Palen (volumes 1–4), Mike Reed (5–6), and Jan Gerardi (7–18). Characters * Andrew Dubble — Andrew is the main character of the series. He is ten years old; he apparently comes from a wealthy family, because they can afford their own helicopter and Andrew travels to various places in the world periodically. Andrew loves to invent things. He invented The Atom Sucker in books 1–4 and the Goa Constrictor in books 13–16. Usually his inventions go awry, resulting in a series of books where Andrew is constantly trying to set things right again. * Judy Dubble — Judy is Andrew's 13-year-old cousin. Although she does not like Andrew very much, she is usually stuck with him and is with him for most of the story. * THUDD — Thudd is a robot that was given to Andrew by his Uncle Al for his seventh birthday. His name stands for The Handy Ultra-Digital Detective. THUDD is small enough to fit inside Andrew's pocket. THUDD talks in a squeaky voice and his sentences are always preceded by a \\"meep\\" noise. THUDD knows everything and constantly points out scientific facts to Andrew and Judy. Judy is not always tolerant of THUDD's superior knowledge, and once threatened to take out his batteries if he wouldn't stop talking. THUDD's most important rule is that he must never get wet. * Uncle Al — Andrew's uncle is a scientist who probably has invented more than Andrew has. He sometimes treats his nephew Andrew to various gadgets (including Thudd). Uncle Al usually has a role in the plot of the story, but is not usually present while Andrew, Judy, and THUDD are off having an adventure. Plots  Books 1–4 Illustrated by Debbie Palen (2002–2003). The first book, Andrew Lost on the Dog begins just after Andrew has finished building the Atom Sucker. He is testing it when he accidentally shrinks himself, Judy, Thudd, and a helicopter to the size of a dust mite. He and Judy are inhaled by a neighborhood dog named Harley and spend the next few hours trying to climb up its head. However, Harley's owner, Mrs. Scuttle, sends Harley inside for a bath and Andrew, Judy, and Thudd fall off Harley's body. The second book, Andrew Lost in the Bathroom begins. Andrew blows his Umbubble, a kind of bubble gum that can be blown big enough to accommodate a person (another of Andrew's inventions). Andrew, Judy, and Thudd float around the bathroom in the Umbubble, trying to escape and get back to the Atom Sucker. But before they can get out, they are accidentally flushed down the toilet by Mrs. Scuttle. The third book, Andrew Lost in the Kitchen begins. Andrew, Judy, and Thudd float through the sewer pipes but manage to go out of the kitchen drain. The Umbubble is soon punctured by the green part of a tomato, and Andrew, Judy, and Thudd have to try to get back to the Atom Sucker without it. They manage to catch a ride on a housefly and they fly outside into the garden. The fourth book, Andrew Lost in the Garden, begins. Andrew and Judy try to walk through the garden and get back to the Atom Sucker, while Mrs. Scuttle is having a garden party. They run into many garden insects and microorganisms in the garden. They eventually find their helicopter, and they fly to the Atom Sucker and unshrink themselves. =Characters= * Harley; the name of a friendly basset hound that belongs to Mrs. Scuttle. * Mrs. Scuttle; Andrew's grumpy neighbor and Harley's owner. Books 5–8 Illustrated by Mike Reed (2003) and Jan Gerardi (2004). The fifth book, Andrew Lost Under Water, begins when Andrew and Judy are at Hawaii with Uncle Al. They accidentally lock themselves inside the Water Bug, a car that Uncle Al turned into a submarine. As they explore underwater, they soon discover that a giant squid is being pursued by a villain called Soggy Bob Sloggins and his robot parrot BURPP (Bob's Ultra Robot Parrot Partner) who wants to capture it. In the sixth book, Andrew Lost in the Whale, they are swallowed by a whale and escape by crawling through its digestive tract, including the stomach, intestines, and anus. In the seventh book, Andrew Lost on the Reef, Andrew and Judy explore a coral reef, and in the eighth book, Andrew Lost in the Deep, they travel to the deepest part of the ocean. At the end of the book, they discover that Soggy Bob Sloggins is not really the villain, but was hypnotized and forced to do evil. They discover that the real enemy is the man who hypnotized him, Doctor Kron-Tox. =Characters= * Soggy Bob Sloggins; a villain trying to capture the giant squid. * BURPP; A robot parrot that belongs to Soggy Bob. Books 9–12 Illustrated by Jan Gerardi (2004–2005). The ninth book, Andrew Lost in Time, begins when Andrew, Judy, Thudd, and Uncle Al are in a cabin in Montana, when Doctor Kron-Tox kidnaps Uncle Al and sends him back in time to the ice age. Andrew, Judy, and Thudd run into the Time-a-tron, the time machine that Uncle Al invented, and go back in time to rescue him. They accidentally go back too far and end up three minutes after the Big Bang. They quickly go forwards in time. In the tenth book, Andrew Lost on Earth, they watch the Earth being formed. They stop in the Carboniferous period and rescue a boy named Beeper, the nephew of Doctor Kron-Tox, who had been stranded there by his uncle. In the eleventh book, Andrew Lost with the Dinosaurs, they stop in the Late Cretaceous period and rescue Doctor Winka Wilde, a woman who was stranded just before the extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period. In the twelfth book, Andrew Lost in the Ice Age, they make it to the ice age. There they rescue Uncle Al, and stop Doctor Kron-Tox from building a theme park with animals he captured. Then they finally return to the present time. =Characters= * Doctor Kron-Tox; an evil scientist who is trying to capture exotic animals for his amusement park. Doctor Kron-Tox travels through time in the Tick-Tock Box, and in book #12 we realize that he also uses the Tick-Tock Box to store his captured animals. * Beeper is Doctor Kron Tox's nephew. He is very friendly, but is often annoying, especially to Judy. Books 13–16 Illustrated by Jan Gerardi (2006–2007). The thirteenth book, Andrew Lost in the Garbage, begins when Andrew, Judy, and Thudd are shrunk to about an inch tall (not as small as in the Atom Sucker incident) and thrown out with the garbage due to an accident with Andrew's newest invention, the Goa Constrictor, and his classmate, Jeremy Bogart. They end up at the city dump, and when they try to escape, they are thrown onto a flying bat. The fourteenth book, Andrew Lost with the Bats, starts here. The bat flies them to a cave, where they travel deep inside and find an opening to the ground. They then climb onto an Arctic tern to escape the bug-eating snakes and other things, and the tern flies them to an Australian jungle, where the fifteenth book, Andrew Lost in the Jungle, starts. Andrew and Judy then make contact with Uncle Al, who flies to Australia and asks them to get in a river and float downstream to where he can catch them. Andrew and Judy then use the Umbubble (which first appeared in book 2) to float to where Uncle Al is waiting. He picks them up, but a mysterious force causes them to shrink down to a microscopic size (possibly even smaller than in the Atom Sucker incident). Then a mosquito bites Uncle Al right where they are sitting on his hand, and the mosquito's snout pushes them inside Uncle Al's body, which is where Andrew Lost in Uncle Al begins. Books 17-18 Illustrated by Jan Gerardi (2008). Andrew, Judy, and Thudd, reduced to the size of ants, face dangers when caught up by a dust devil in the Australian desert (Andrew Lost in the Desert) and a pond full of frogs (Andrew Lost with the Frogs).

The group claims that its festival is the only in the area that is \\"truly a traditional festival\\" and it is \\"one of the oldest continuous (if not the oldest) traditional Irish music and dance\\" festivals in the United States. The Ceili Group began in 1958 when a group of young Irish immigrants and Irish- American step and figure/ceili dancers gathered at The Irish Center (also founded in 1958) to formally promote Irish arts traditions. The PCG started with Friday night ceilis, for all who wanted to learn Irish figure dances and musical instruments, and went from there to Irish theatre productions, Irish- Gaelic language lessons and much more, to its present-day yearly festival of all things Irish, for all ages. The annual festival began in 1975, when folklorist Mick Moloney expressed a need for a venue where Irish music and dance talent could be showcased without a competitive atmosphere, as was the case with all fleaghs. So thirteen people met throughout the summer to make the festival a reality. Those people involved in organizing the first festival were Mickey and Jimmie McGill, Helen and Gus Haun, Sally and Dan Doughtery, Tina and Margaret Quigley, Tim Britton, Brian and Tim Quinn, Carl Zuckerman, and Dan Verbo. Helen was instrumental in finding and negotiating a deal with the Fischers of Fischer's Pool, in Lansdale, Pa. as the first location for the festival. Fischer's Pool was a privately owned summer retreat with an Olympic sized pool that nearby residents joined to use throughout the summer and cabins that were also rented for the season. Fischer's Pool also hosted summer picnics for groups. There was a separate area for these group picnics with its own large field, several pavilions filled with picnic tables and a kitchen with window service. This was the area where the first Philadelphia Ceili Group Irish Music, Song and Dance Festival took place. Workshops were staged under the picnic pavilions. One of the pavilions had a concrete floor, as compared to dirt floors, so it was cleared of tables and the dancing took place there near the food and beer sales. It was the first non-competitive presentation of Irish Music, Song and Dance in the US. It has expanded to a three-day festival in recent years. The 2005 festival initiated a feature called an “Irish Circle of Song”: singers in both the accompanied and the un- accompanied -“sean nos” - singing styles. In 2007, “The Spoken Word” program was added to the festival to highlight the Irish contribution to poetry, drama, and prose. The Ceili Group encourages artists of every generation, and brings to the stage the Philadelphia area’s youngest Irish step, ceili, and set dancers, singers, and instrumentalists.

Upon learning that Jaisal was of Yaduvanshi descent, Eesul told him that according to ancient mythology Krishna and Bhima had come to this location for a ceremony, where Krishna had prophesied that a descendant of his Yaduvanshi clan would one day establish a kingdom here. Eesul showed him a spring which Krishna had created and his prophecy carved into a rock.Crump and Toh. Page 208. This rock still remains in a well in the Jaisalmer fort.

These terms are also used to refer to German-born individuals who are of full or partial Turkish ancestry. Whilst the majority of Turks arrived or originate from Turkey, there are also significant ethnic Turkish communities living in Germany who come from (or descend from) Southeastern Europe (such as Greece, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romania), Cyprus, and more recently as refugees from Syria and Iraq. Turkish people form the largest ethnic minority in Germany.. They also form the second largest Turkish population in the world, after Turkey. Turks who immigrated to Germany brought cultural elements with them, including the Turkish language and Islam. These cultural values are often passed down to their children and descendants, but Turkish Germans are also increasingly secular. Moreover, greater German society has also been exposed to Turkish culture, particularly in regards to Turkish food and the arts. These changes in Germany, as well as the recently introduced Germany nationality laws in 1990 and 1999, show that Turkish immigrants and second-, third-, and fourth-generation Turks are no longer merely seen as \\"foreigners\\" (\\"Ausländer\\") in Germany but rather permanent residents who are increasingly making their voices heard, whether it be in local and national politics, civic actions, religious organisations, or in cinema, literature, music, and sports. History  Ottoman Turkish migration  Once the Ottoman army retreated from their unsuccessful campaign at the Battle of Vienna in 1683, many soldiers and camp followers were left behind. At least 500 Turkish prisoners were forcibly settled in Germany. Fatima Kariman was a Turkish captive during the Battle of Buda. She was captured by General Schöning and later sent to Saxony where she became the mistress of Augustus II the Strong. Her son, Frederick Augustus Rutowsky, became the commander of the Saxon army during the Siege of Pirna. Turkish people have been in contact with the German states since the sixteenth century when the Ottoman Empire attempted to expand their territories beyond the north Balkan territories. The Ottoman Turks held two sieges in Vienna: the first Siege of Vienna in 1529 and the Second Siege of Vienna in 1683. In particular, it was the aftermath of the second siege which provided the circumstances for a Turkish community to permanently settle in Germany. Many Ottoman soldiers and camp followers who were left behind after the second siege of Vienna became stragglers or prisoners. It is estimated that at least 500 Turkish prisoners were forcibly settled in Germany. Historical records show that some Turks became traders or took up other professions, particularly in southern Germany. Some Turks fared very well in Germany; for example, one Ottoman Turk is recorded to have been raised to the Hanoverian nobility. Historical records also show that many Ottoman Turks converted to Christianity and became priests or pastors. The aftermath of the second siege of Vienna led to a series of wars between the Ottoman Empire and the Holy League, known as the \\"Great Turkish War\\", or the \\"War of the Holy League\\", which led to a series of Ottoman defeats. Consequently, more Turks were taken by the Europeans as prisoners. The Turkish captives taken to Germany were not solely made up of men. For example, General Schöning took \\"two of the most beautiful women in the world\\" in Buda who later converted to Christianity. Another Turkish captive named Fatima became the mistress of Augustus II the Strong, Elector of Saxony of the Albertine line of the House of Wettin. Fatima and Augustus had two children: their son, Frederick Augustus Rutowsky, became the commander of the Saxon army in 1754-63 whilst their daughter, Maria Anna Katharina Rutowska, married into Polish nobility. Records show that at this point it was not uncommon for Turks in Germany to convert to Christianity. For example, records show that 28 Turks converted to Christianity and were settled in Württemberg. The Mosque-style Yenidze tobacco factory in Dresden is a symbolic reminder of the trading relations between the Ottomans and the Prussians. It was named after the importing tobacco region of Ottoman Yenidze. With the establishment of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701, Turkish people continued to enter the German lands as soldiers employed by the Prussian kings. Historical records show that this was particularly evident with the expansion of Prussia in the mid-18th century. For example, in 1731, the Duke of Kurland presented twenty Turkish guardsmen to King Frederick William I, and at one time, about 1,000 Muslim soldiers are said to have served in the Prussian cavalry. The Prussian king's fascination with the Enlightenment was reflected in their consideration for the religious concerns of their Muslim troops. By 1740 Frederick the Great stated that: Berlin's Turkish cemetery alongside an Ottoman style mosque, which was built in 1863. By 1763, an Ottoman legation existed at the Prussian court in Berlin. Its third envoy, Ali Aziz Efendi, died in 1798 which led to the establishment of the first Muslim cemetery in Germany. However, several decades later, there was a need for another cemetery, as well as a mosque, and the Ottoman sultan Abdülaziz I was given permission to patronize a mosque in Berlin in 1866. Once trading treaties were established between the Ottomans and the Prussians in the nineteenth century, Turks and Germans were encouraged to cross over to each other's lands for trade.. Consequently, the Turkish community in Germany, and particularly in Berlin, grew significantly (as did a German community in Istanbul) in the years before the First World War. These contacts influenced the building of various Turkish-style structures in Germany, such as the Yenidze cigarette factory in Dresden and the Dampfmaschinenhaus für Sanssouci pumping-station in Potsdam. Mainland Turkish migration A Turkish woman working in a market in Berlin, 1990, shortly after the fall of the Wall. In the mid-twentieth century, West Germany experienced the Wirtschaftswunder (\\"economic miracle\\"); however, the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 exacerbated West Germany’s labour crisis by restricting the flow of immigrants from East Germany. Consequently, in the same year, the West German government signed a labour recruitment agreement with the Republic of Turkey on 30 October 1961, and officially invited the Turkish people to emigrate to the country. By 1961–62, German employers played a crucial role in pressuring the State to end the two-year limitation clause of the \\"Gastarbeiter\\" (\\"guest worker\\") agreement so that Turkish workers could stay in West Germany for longer.. Most Turkish people who immigrated to West Germany intended to live there temporarily and then return to Turkey so that they could build a new life with the money they had earned. Indeed, return-migration had increased during the recession of 1966-1967, the 1973 oil crisis, followed by the policy of giving remigration bonuses in the early 1980s.. However, the number of Turkish migrants who returned to Turkey ultimately remained relatively small compared to the number of Turkish immigrants arriving in Germany.. This was partly due to the family reunification rights that were introduced in 1974 which allowed Turkish workers to bring their families to Germany.. Consequently, between 1974–88 the number of Turks in Germany nearly doubled, acquiring a normalised sex ratio and a much younger age profile than the German population.. Moreover, once the recruitment of foreigner workers was reintroduced after the recession of 1967, the BfA (Bundesversicherungsanstalt für Angestellte) granted most work visas to women. This was in part because labour shortages continued in low paying, low-status service jobs such as electronics, textiles, and garment work; and in part to further the goal of family reunification.. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and the reunification of East and West Germany, was followed by intense public debate around the articulations of national identity and citizenship, including the place of Germany’s Turkish minority in the future of a united Germany. These debates about citizenship were accompanied by expressions of xenophobia and ethnic violence that targeted the Turkish population.. Anti-immigrant sentiment was especially strong in the former eastern states of Germany, which underwent profound social and economic transformations during the reunification process. Turkish communities experienced considerable fear for their safety throughout Germany, with some 1,500 reported cases of right wing violence, and 2,200 cases the year after.. The political rhetoric calling for foreigner-free zones (Ausländer-freie Zonen) and the rise of neo-Nazi groups sharpened public awareness of integration issues and generated intensified support among liberal Germans for the competing idea of Germany as a \\"multicultural\\" society. Citizenship laws that established eligibility according to place of birth rather than according to descent have been slow in coming and restrictions on dual citizenship are still onerous. However, increasing numbers of second-generation Turkish-Germans have opted for German citizenship and are becoming more involved in the political process.. Turkish migration from Southeastern Europe =Bulgaria= Initially, some Bulgarian Turks arrived in Germany during the introduction of the family reunification laws of 1974. The Bulgarian Turks were able to take advantage of this law despite the very small number of Bulgarian citizens in Germany. This is because some Turkish workers in Germany who arrived from Turkey were actually part of the Bulgarian-Turkish minority who had left Bulgaria during the communist regime during the 1980s and still held Bulgarian citizenship, alongside their Turkish citizenship. The migration of Bulgarian Turks to Germany increased further once communism in Bulgaria came to an end in 1989. Bulgarian Turks who were unable to join the massive migration wave to Turkey in 1989, during \\"big excursion\\", were faced with severe economic disadvantages and faced discrimination through State policies of Bulgarisation. Hence, from the early 1990s onwards many Bulgarian Turks sought asylum in Germany.. Their numbers in Germany have significantly increased since Bulgaria was admitted into the European Union, which has allowed many Bulgarian Turks to use the freedom of movement to enter Germany. The Bulgarian Turks have generally been attracted to Germany because they rely on the well-established Turkish-German community for gaining employment. According to the National Statistical Institute of Bulgaria, in general, Bulgarian citizens of Turkish origin living abroad make up 12% of short term migration, 13% of long term migration, and 12% of the labour migration. However, Bulgarian citizens of Turkish origin often make up entire majorities in some countries in Europe.. For example, in the Netherlands Bulgarian Turks make up about 80% of Bulgarian citizens. Moreover, academics have pointed out that most Bulgarian Turks who migrate to Western Europe choose to live in Germany and that they outnumber those living in the Netherlands. =Greece= From the 1950s onwards, the muslim minority of Greece, particularly the muslims of Western Thrace, began to immigrate to Germany alongside other Greek citizens.. Whilst many muslims had intended to return to Greece after working for a number of years, a new Greek law was introduced which effectively forced the minority to remain in Germany. Article 19 of the 1955 Greek Constitution essentially stripped off the Western Thrace Turks living abroad (particularly those in Germany and Turkey) of their Greek citizenship. According to Article 19 of the Greek Constitution \\"A person of non-Greek ethnic origin leaving Greece without the intention of returning may be declared as having lost Greek nationality\\". Many Western Thrace muslims who did intend on returning to Greece were discriminated against and were refused the right to a hearing. Estimates of the number of Western Thrace muslims who lost their citizenship range between several hundred to several thousand. The migration of Western Thrace muslims to Germany continued to increase in the 1960s and 1970s. This was because the Thracian tobacco industry was affected by a severe crisis and many tobacco growers lost their income. Consequently, between 25,000-40,000 Western Thrace muslims immigrated to Western Europe, of which 80% arrived in Germany - accounting to 20,000 to 32,000 immigrants. In 2013 Cemile Giousouf became the first Western Thrace muslim to become a member of the German parliament. Moreover, she was the first Muslim to be elected for the Christian Democratic Union of Germany. =North Macedonia= Turkish migration from Cyprus Turkish Cypriots began to emigrate from Cyprus to Western Europe, mostly to the United Kingdom but also a few to Germany, during the Cyprus conflict (1950s-1974) and its immediate aftermath. Today there is approximately 2,000 Turkish Cypriots living in Germany. Turkish migration from the Arab world =Lebanon= Due to the numerous wars in Lebanon since the 1970s onwards, many Lebanese Turks have sought refuge in Turkey and Europe, particularly in Germany. Indeed, many Lebanese Turks were aware of the large Turkish-German population and saw this as an opportunity to find work once settling in Europe. In particular, the largest wave of Lebanese-Turkish migration occurred once the Israel-Lebanon war of 2006 began. During this period more than 20,000 Turks fled Lebanon, particularly from Beirut, and settled in Germany. = Syria and Iraq = Crime Attacks against the Turkish community in Germany A memorial stone in remembrance of Mete Ekşi (de). A demonstration condemning the neo-Nazi attacks outside the house of the Turkish victims of the Solingen arson attack of 1993. Former Miss Germany (2005) Aslı Bayram is an Ambassador for Crime Prevention. In 1994, her father was shot dead by a neo-Nazi and she was shot in her left arm. The fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, and the reunification of Germany, saw a sharp rise in violent attacks against Turkish-Germans. A series of arson attacks, bombings, and shootings have targeted the Turkish community in both public and private spaces, such as in their homes, cultural centres, and businesses. Consequently, many victims have been killed or severely injured by these attacks. On 27 October 1991, Mete Ekşi (de), a 19-year-old student from Kreuzberg, was attacked by three neo-Nazi German brothers. Ekşi's funeral in November 1991 was attended by 5,000 people. Despite the mass outrage of Ekşi's death, the rise of xenophobia was still evident by the numerous right-wing riots that occurred in the country, particularly the Rostock-Lichtenhagen riots. A year after Ekşi's murder, on 22 November 1992, two Turkish girls, Ayşe Yılmaz and Yeliz Arslan, and their grandmother, Bahide Arslan, were killed in an arson attack by two neo-Nazis in their home in Mölln. On 9 March 1993, Mustafa Demiral (de), aged 56, was attacked by two neo-Nazis whilst waiting at a bus stop in Mülheim. One of the attackers pointed a gun at the victim and pulled the trigger several times but no shot went off; nonetheless, Demiral suffered a heart-attack and died at the scene of the crime. Two months later, on 28 May 1993, four neo-Nazi German men set fire to the house of a Turkish family in Solingen. Three girls and two women died and 14 other members of the extended family were severely injured in the attack. The German Chancellor Helmut Kohl did not attend the memorial services. Neo-Nazi attacks continued throughout the 1990s. For example, on 18 February 1994, the Bayram family were attacked on their doorstep by a neo-Nazi neighbour in Darmstadt. The attack was not well publicised until one of the victims, Aslı Bayram, was crowned Miss Germany in 2005. The armed neo-Nazi neighbour shot Aslı on her left arm and then the attacker shot Aslı's father, Ali Bayram, who died from the gunshot. A memorial plaque, in Nuremberg, in remembrance of the victims of the \\"Bosphorus serial murders\\". Racist violence persisted through to the twenty-first century. Between 2000 and 2006 several Turkish shopkeepers were attacked in numerous cities in Germany. The attacks were popularly called the \\"Bosphorus serial murders\\" (Bosporus-Morde) or the \\"Döner murders\\" (Dönermorde) - which saw eight Turkish and one Greek person killed. Initially, the German media suspected that Turkish gangs were behind these murders. However, by 2011 it came to light that the perpetrators were in fact the neo- Nazi group the National Socialist Underground. Moreover, this neo-Nazi group were also responsible for the June 2004 Cologne bombing which resulted in 22 Turkish people being injured. By 3 February 2008, nine Turkish people, including five children, died in a blaze in Ludwigshafen. The cause of the fire was said to have been an electrical fault; however, the German police found neo-Nazi graffiti at the scene of a fire at the Turkish Cultural Centre which was home to the two families living there. The Chancellor Angela Merkel was criticised for not attending a demonstration held in memory of the victims by 16,000 people. Not all attacks on Turks have been perpetrated by neo-Nazi right-wing Germans. For example, the perpetrator of a mass shooting in Munich on 22 July 2016 who deliberately targeted people of Turkish and Arab origin. On that day, he killed nine victims, of which four victims were of Turkish origin: Can Leyla, aged 14, Selçuk Kılıç, aged 17, and Sevda Dağ, aged 45; as well as Hüseyin Dayıcık, aged 19, who was a Greek national of Turkish origin. On 19 February 2020, a German neo-nazi who expressed hate for non-German people, carried out two mass shootings in the city of Hanau, killing nine foreigners. He then returned to his home, killed his mother and committed suicide. Five of the nine victims were Turkish citizens. Turkish gangs In 2014, the annual report into organized crime, presented in Berlin by interior minister Thomas de Maizière, showed that there were 57 Turkish gangs in Germany. In 2016, the Die Welt and Bild reported that new Turkish motorbike gang, the Osmanien Germania is growing rapidly. The Hannoversche Allgemeine newspaper claimed that the Osmanien Germania is advancing more and more into red-light districts, which increases the likelihood of a bloody territorial battle with established gangs like the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club.  Demographics  A group of Turkish Germans. Characteristics Although 1.55 million people in Germany hold Turkish citizenship, this figure is not a true representation of the total Turkish population. This is because the German state does not categorise immigrants, or their descendants, in terms of ethnicity. Consequently, ethnic Turks who have German citizenship are categorised as \\"German\\" rather than \\"Turkish\\". Similarly, those with Turkish citizenship are categorised as \\"Turkish\\" irrespective of their ethnicity. Hence, ethnic minorities from Turkey who have also immigrated to Germany are not distinguished as a separate group, according to their ethnicities. Furthermore, the significant number of ethnic Turkish communities who have arrived in Germany from the Balkans, Cyprus, and the Arab World are recorded according to their citizenship, such as \\"Bulgarian\\", \\"Cypriot\\", \\"Greek\\", \\"Iraqi\\", \\"Lebanese\\" \\"Macedonian\\", \\"Romanian\\", \\"Syrian\\" etc. rather than by their Turkish ethnicity. Whilst these ethnic Turkish communities have different nationalities, they share the same ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious origins as mainland ethnic Turks.. Population Estimates of the total Turkish population in Germany, including those of partial descent, have ranged considerably because the German census does not collect data on ethnicity. Academic estimates have often ranged between 2.5 and 4 million. However, since the first decade of the twenty-first century, numerous academics have suggested that there are 4 million people, or \\"at least\\" or \\"more than\\" 4 million people, of full or partial Turkish origin in the country, or forming 5% of Germany's total population of 82 million inhabitants (which accounts to 4.1 million). In addition, several academics have also distinguished the \\"Turkey-related population\\", which includes ethnic minorities from Turkey but does not include the significant populations of ethnic Turkish communities from the Balkans, Cyprus and the Arab world. Estimates suggest that the total number of people living in Germany who originate from Turkey only (including ethnic minorities from Turkey, particularly the Kurds) reaches, or is more than, five million people to 5.6 million people. Austrian scholar Tessa Szyszkowitz has quoted a European official who has claimed that: \\"It is a little late to start the debate about being an immigrant country now, when already seven million Turks live in Germany\\". Settlements The Turkish community in Germany is concentrated predominantly in urban centers. The vast majority are found in the former West Germany, particularly in industrial regions such as the states of North Rhine- Westphalia (where a third of Turkish Germans live), and Baden-Württemberg and the working-class neighbourhoods of cities like Berlin (especially in Neukölln), Hamburg, Bremen, Cologne, Duisburg, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Mannheim, Mainz, Nuremberg, Munich, and Stuttgart... Among the German districts in 2011 Duisburg, Gelsenkirchen, Heilbronn, Herne, North Rhine- Westphalia and Ludwigshafen had the highest shares of migrants from Turkey according to census data. Return migration In regards to return- migration, many Turkish nationals and Turkish Germans have also migrated from Germany to Turkey, for retirement or professional reasons. Official German records show that there are 2.8 million \\"returnees\\"; however, the German Embassy in Ankara estimates the true number to be four million, acknowledging the differences in German official data and the realities of the under- reporting by migrants. Integration Turkish and German flags. Turkish immigrants make up Germany's second biggest immigrant group with almost 3 million people and are very poorly integrated, ranked last in Berlin Institute's integration ranking. During a speech in Düsseldorf in 2011, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan urged Turks in Germany to integrate, but not assimilate, a statement that caused a political outcry in Germany. Citizenship For decades Turkish citizens in Germany were unable to become German citizens because of the traditional German construct of \\"nationhood\\". The legal notion of citizenship was based on \\"blood ties\\" of a German parent (jus sanguinis) – as opposed to citizenship based on country of birth and residence (jus soli). This adhered to the political notion that Germany was not a country of immigration. For this reason, only those who were of partial Turkish origin (and had one parent who was ethnically German) could obtain German citizenship. In 1990 Germany's citizenship law was somewhat relaxed with the introduction of the Foreigner's Law; this gave Turkish workers the right to apply for a permanent residency permit after eight years of living in the country.. In regards to people of Turkish origin born in Germany, who were also legally \\"foreign\\", they were given the right to acquire German citizenship at the age of eighteen, provided that they gave up their Turkish citizenship. Hence, they were deprived of the right to hold dual citizenship because it would increase the Turkish population in the country. Chancellor Helmut Kohl officially stated this as the main reason for denying dual citizenship in 1997 when he said the following: Nonetheless, another citizenship reform law was soon introduced after Helmut Kohl finished his last term as Chancellor. The Citizenship Law of 1999, which was officially taken into effect on 1 January 2000, has facilitated the acquisition of German citizenship for people born outside of Germany, making it available to Turkish immigrants after eight years of legal residence in the country. The law’s most innovative provision granted dual citizenship to Turkish-origin children born in Germany; however, this right to dual citizenship ends at age 23 and the bearers must decide whether to keep their German citizenship or the citizenship of their parent’s country of birth.. Former Turkish citizens who have given up their citizenship can apply for the \\"Blue Card\\" (Mavi Kart), which gives them some rights in Turkey, such as the right to live and work in Turkey, the right to possess and inherit land or the right to inherit; however, they do not have the right to vote. Discrimination It has been criticized that there is a media and political bias against Turkish Germans compared to Kurds in Germany, for example, when pro-Erdogan Turkish-Germans demonstrate the media and many politicians warn against these demonstrations, but the same media and politicians remain silent about the many regular pro- PKK Kurdish demonstrations. In 1985 the German journalist Günter Wallraff shocked the German public with his internationally successful book Ganz unten (\\"In the Pits\\" or \\"Way Down\\") in which he reported the discrimination faced by Turkish people in German society. He disguised himself as a Turkish worker called \\"Ali Levent\\" for over two years and took on minimal-wage jobs and confronted German institutions. He found that many employers did not register or insure their Turkish workers. Moreover, major employers like Thyssen did not give their Turkish workers adequate breaks and did not pay them their full wage.Stowasser, 2002 p.60 Nevertheless, there is the 1993 Solingen arson attack. On the night which tied 28–29 May 1993 in Solingen in North Rhine- Westphalia, Germany, four Germans knowingly set a house on fire in order to burn the Turkish family inside. Four people were burnt alive in their homes and fourteen more critically injured. After the events, although solidarity from some German groups were seen, the violence and discrimination continued. It has been, and still is, also reported that Turkish-Germans were being discriminated against at school from early age and in workplaces. It has also been found that teachers discriminate on non German sounding names and tend to give worse grades just based on names. The studies showed that even though a student might have had the exact number of right and wrong answers, or the exact paper, the teachers favour German names. This creates a vicious cycle where teachers favour German descent students over non Germans, including Turkish students, which result in worse education, which later results in Turkish people not being able to take what is deemed to be \\"higher skill jobs\\", which nonetheless deepens the cracks in the cycle. There are also the reports of discrimination against Turkish-Germans in other areas such as sports, one example being the discrimination against the football player Mesut Özil.  Culture  The Turkish people who immigrated to Germany brought their culture with them, including their language, religion, food, and arts. These cultural traditions have also been passed down to their descendants who maintain these values. Consequently, Turkish Germans have also exposed their culture to the greater German society. This is particularly noticeable in the developing landscape of the country, with numerous Turkish restaurants, grocery stores, teahouses, and mosques scattered across Germany. Moreover, the Turks in Germany have also been exposed to the German culture - as is evident on the influence it has played in the Turkish dialect spoken by the Turkish community in Germany. Food The döner kebap is one of the most popular fast-foods in Germany. Turkish cuisine first arrived in Germany during the sixteenth century and was consumed among aristocratic circles. However, Turkish food became available to the greater German society from the mid- twentieth century onwards with the arrival of Turkish immigrants. By the early 1970s Turks began to open fast-food restaurants serving popular kebap dishes. Today there are Turkish restaurants scattered throughout the country selling popular dishes like döner kebap in take-away stalls to more authentic domestic foods in family-run restaurants. Moreover, since the 1970s, Turks have opened grocery stores and open-air markets where they sell ingredients suitable for Turkish home-cooking, such as spices, fruits, and vegetables. Language A symbolic sign at the entrance of Kreuzberg written in the Turkish language: \\"Kreuzberg Merkezi\\" (Kreuzberg Centre). Turkish is the second most spoken language in Germany, after German. It was brought to the country by Turkish immigrants who spoke it as their first language. These immigrants mainly learned German through employment, mass media, and social settings, and it has now become a second language for many of them. Nonetheless, most Turkish immigrants have passed down their mother tongue to their children and descendants. In general, Turkish Germans become bilingual at an early age, learning Turkish at home and German in state schools; thereafter, a dialectal variety often remains in their repertoire of both languages.. An advertisement by the IKEA branch in Berlin written in the German and Turkish languages. Turkish Germans mainly speak the German language more fluently than their \\"domestic\\"-style Turkish language. Consequently, they often speak the Turkish language with a German accent or a modelled German dialect. It is also common within the community to modify the Turkish language by adding German grammatical and syntactical structures. Parents generally encourage their children to improve their Turkish language skills further by attending private Turkish classes or choosing Turkish as a subject at school. In some states of Germany the Turkish language has even been approved as a subject to be studied for the Abitur. Turkish has also been influential in greater German society. For example, advertisements and banners in public spaces can be found written in Turkish. Hence, it is also familiar to other ethnic groups - it can even serve as a vernacular for some non-Turkish children and adolescents in urban neighborhoods with dominant Turkish communities.. It is also common within the Turkish community to code-switch between the German and Turkish languages. By the early 1990s a new sociolect called \\"Kanak Sprak\\" or \\"Türkendeutsch\\" was coined by the Turkish-German author Feridun Zaimoğlu to refer to the German \\"ghetto\\" dialect spoken by the Turkish youth. However, with the developing formation of a Turkish middle class in Germany, there is an increasing number of people of Turkish-origin who are proficient in using the standard German language, particularly in academia and the arts. Religion The Turkish people in Germany are predominantly Muslim and form the largest ethnic group which practices Islam in Germany. Since the 1960s, \\"Turkish\\" was seen as synonymous with \\"Muslim\\", this is because Islam is considered to have a \\"Turkish character\\" in Germany... This Turkish character is particularly evident in the Ottoman/Turkish-style architecture of many mosques scattered across Germany. Approximately 2,000 of Germany's 3,000 mosques are Turkish, of which 900 are financed by the Diyanet İşleri Türk-İslam Birliği, an arm of the Turkish government, and the remainder by other political Turkish groups. According to the 2011 Census, a majority (53.5%) of people of Turkish descent in Lower Saxony were religiously unaffiliated, 1.3% were Christian and 44.9% belonged to another religion (mainly Islam). The Turkish community in Lower Saxony numbered 90,014 in 2014.  Popular culture  Media =Films= The first phase in Turkish-German Cinema began in the 1970s and lasted through to the 1980s; it involved writers placing much of their attention on story-lines that represented the living and working conditions of the Turkish immigrant workers in Germany. By the 1990s a second phase shifted towards focusing more on mass entertainment and involved the work of Turkish and German-born Turkish German filmmakers. Critical engagements in story- telling increased further by the turn of the twenty-first century. Numerous films of the 1990s onwards launched the careers of many film directors, writers, and actors and actresses. Fatih Akin is one of the most influential film directors in Turkish-German cinema. Sibel Kekilli has played a leading role in several Turkish-German films. Fatih Akin's films, which often examine the place of the Turkish diaspora in Germany, have won numerous awards and have launched the careers of many of its cast including Short Sharp Shock (1998) starring Mehmet Kurtuluş and İdil Üner; Head-On (2004) starring Birol Ünel and Sibel Kekilli; Kebab Connection (2004) starring Denis Moschitto; The Edge of Heaven (2007) starring Baki Davrak; and Soul Kitchen (2009) starring Birol Ünel. Other notable films which have a transnational context include Feridun Zaimoğlu's book-turned-film ' (2000); Kerim Pamuk's (de) Süperseks (2004); and Özgür Yıldırım's (de) Chiko (2008). Several Turkish-German comedy films have also intentionally used comical stereotypes to encourage its viewers to question their preconceived ideas of \\"the Other\\", such as Züli Aladağ's (de) film 300 Worte Deutsch (\\"300 words of German\\", 2013), starring Almila Bagriacik, Arzu Bazman (de), Aykut Kayacık, and Vedat Erincin. Similarly, other recent Turkish-German comedies like Meine verrückte türkische Hochzeit (\\"My Crazy Turkish Wedding\\", 2006), starring Hilmi Sözer, Ercan Özçelik, Aykut Kayacık, and Özay Fecht, and the film Evet, ich will! (\\"Evet, I do!\\", 2009), starring numerous Turkish-German actors such as Demir Gökgöl, Emine Sevgi Özdamar, Erden Alkan, Gandi Mukli, Hülya Duyar, Jale Arıkan, Lilay Huser, Meral Perin, Mürtüz Yolcu, Sema Meray, and Sinan Akkuş, have emphasised how the Turkish and German cultures come together in contemporary German society. By focusing on similarities and differences of the two cultures using comedy, these films have shifted from the earlier Turkish-German drama films of the 1980s which focused on culture clashes; in its place, these films have celebrated integration and interethnic romance. By 2011 Yasemin Şamdereli and Nesrin Şamdereli's comedy film Almanya: Welcome to Germany, starring Aylin Tezel and Fahri Yardım, premiered at the Berlin Film Festival and was attended by the German President and the Turkish Ambassador to celebrate fifty years since the mass migration of Turkish workers to Germany. Indeed, stories confronting Turkish labour migration, and debates about integration, multiculturalism, and identity, are reoccurring themes in Turkish-German cinema.. Nonetheless, not all films directed, produced or written by Turkish Germans are necessarily about the \\"Turkish-experience\\" in Germany. Several Turkish Germans have been involved in other genres, such as Bülent Akinci who directed the German drama Running on Empty (2006), Mennan Yapo who has directed the American supernatural thriller Premonition (2007), and Thomas Arslan (de) who directed the German Western film Gold (2013). Several Turkish- origin actors from Germany have also starred in Turkish films, such as Haluk Piyes who starred in O da beni seviyor (2001). =Television= Erol Sander has starred as a leading role in several Turkish-German TV series'. Nazan Eckes is a popular TV presenter. In the first decade of the twenty-first century several German television series in which the experience of Turkish- Germans as a major theme gained popularity in Germany and in some cases gained popularity abroad too. For example, Sinan Toprak ist der Unbestechliche (\\"Sinan Toprak is the Incorruptible\\", 2001-2002) and Mordkommission Istanbul (\\"Murder Squad Istanbul\\", 2008–present) which both star Erol Sander. In 2005 Tevfik Başer's book Zwischen Gott und Erde (\\"Time of Wishes\\") was turned into a primetime TV German movie starring Erhan Emre, Lale Yavaş, Tim Seyfi, and Hilmi Sözer, and won the prestigious Adolf Grimme Prize. Another popular Turkish-German TV series was Alle lieben Jimmy (\\"Everybody Loves Jimmy\\", 2006-2007) starring Eralp Uzun (de) and Gülcan Kamps. Due to the success of Alle lieben Jimmy, it was made into a Turkish series called Cemil oldu Jimmy - making it the first German series to be exported to Turkey.. By 2006 the award-winning German television comedy-drama series Türkisch für Anfänger (\\"Turkish for Beginners\\", 2006-2009) became one of the most popular shows in Germany. The critically acclaimed series was also shown in more than 70 other countries.Türkisch für Anfänger: Im Ausland ein Hit (German language), Filmstarts.de, 1 April 2009 (30 January 2013) Created by Bora Dağtekin, the plot is based on interethnic-relations between German and Turkish people. Adnan Maral plays the role of a widower of two children who marries an ethnic German mother of two children - forming the Öztürk-Schneider family. The comedy consisted of fifty-two episodes and three seasons. By 2012 Türkisch für Anfänger was made into a feature film (de); it was the most successful German film of the year with an audience of 2.5 million. Other notable Turkish-origin actors on German television include Erdoğan Atalay, Erkan Gündüz (de), İsmail Deniz (de), Olgu Caglar, Özgür Özata, Taner Sahintürk (de), and Timur Ülker (de). Whilst Turkish-origin journalists are still underrepresented, several have made successful careers as reporters and TV presenters including Erkan Arikan (de) and Nazan Eckes. Many Turkish Germans have also starred in numerous critically acclaimed Turkish drama series. For example, numerous actors and actresses in Muhteşem Yüzyıl were born in Germany, including Meryem Uzerli, Nur Fettahoğlu, Selma Ergeç, and Ozan Güven. Other popular Turkish- German performers in Turkey include Fahriye Evcen who has starred in Yaprak Dökümü and Kurt Seyit ve Şura. Comedy One of the first comedians of Turkish-origin to begin a career as a mainstream comedian is Django Asül who began his career in satire in the 1990s. Another very successful comedian is Bülent Ceylan who performed his first solo show \\"Doner for one\\" in 2002. By 2011 the broadcasting agency RTL aired Ceylan's own comedy show The Bulent Ceylan Show. Other notable comedians include Fatih Çevikkollu (de), Murat Topal (de), Serdar Somuncu (de), Kaya Yanar, and female comedian Idil Baydar (de). Literature Since the 1960s Turkish people in Germany have produced a range of literature. Their work became widely available from the late 1970s onwards, when Turkish-origin writers began to gain sponsorships by German institutions and major publishing houses. Some of the most notable writers of Turkish origin in Germany include Akif Pirinçci, Alev Tekinay (de), Emine Sevgi Özdamar, Feridun Zaimoğlu, Necla Kelek, Renan Demirkan, Zafer Senocak (de). These writers approach a broad range of historical, social and political issues, such as identity, gender, racism, and language. In particular, German audiences have often been captivated by Oriental depictions of the Turkish community. Music In the mid-twentieth century the Turkish immigrant community in Germany mostly followed the music industry in Turkey, particularly pop music and Turkish folk music. Hence, the Turkish music industry became very profitable in Germany. By the 1970s, the \\"arabesque\\" genre erupted in Turkey and became particularly popular among Turks in Germany. These songs were often played and sang by the Turkish community in Germany in coffee houses and taverns that replicated those in Turkey. These spaces also provided the first stage for semi-professional and professional musicians. Consequently, by the end of the 1960s, some Turks in Germany began to produce their own music, such as Metin Türköz (de) who took up themes of the Turkish immigration journey and their working conditions. Bahar Kızıl is a founding member of the German pop group Monrose. By the 1990s the Turkish Germans became more influential in the music industry in both Germany and Turkey. In general, many Turkish Germans were brought up listening to Turkish pop music, which greatly influenced the music they began to produce. They were also influenced by hip-hop music and rap music. Moreover, since the 1990s, the Turkish-German music scene has developed creative and successful new styles, such as \\"Oriental pop and rap\\" and \\"R'n'Besk\\" - a fusion of Turkish arabesque songs and R&B; music. Examples of Oriental-pop and rap emerged in the early 2000s with Bassturk’s first single \\"Yana Yana\\" (\\"Side by Side\\"). The \\"R'n'Besk\\"-style gained popularity in Germany with Muhabbet's 2005 single \\"Sie liegt in meinen Armen\\" (\\"She lies in my Arms\\"). By 2007 Muhabbet released the song \\"Deutschland\\" (\\"Germany\\"); the lyrics appeal to Germans to finally accept the Turkish immigrants living in the country. In 2015 several Turkish-German musicians released the song \\"Sen de bizdensin\\" (\\"You are one of us\\"). The vocalists included Eko Fresh, Elif Batman, Mehtab Guitar, Özlem Özdil (de), and Volkan Baydar (de); moreover, Dergin Tokmak (de), Ercandize, Serdar Bogatekin, and Zafer Kurus were also involved in the production. The song was used in a campaign to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Ay Yildiz telephone network and was extensively broadcast on TV and radio. Thereafter, a competition and group was formed called \\"Die Stimme einer neuen Ära/Yeni neslin sesi\\" (\\"The voice of the new generation\\") to find new Turkish-German talent and \\"Sen de bizdensin\\" was re-released with different lyrics. Other Turkish-origin musicians in the German music industry include Bahar Kızıl (from the former girl-group Monrose), and winner of Germany's \\"Star Search\\" Martin Kesici. Several Turkish-origin singers born in Germany have also launched their careers in Turkey, such as Akın Eldes, Aylin Aslım, Doğuş (tr), İsmail YK, Ozan Musluoğlu, Pamela Spence, and Tarkan. The German-born Turkish Cypriot pianist Rüya Taner has also launched her career in Turkey. There are also some musicians who perform and produce songs in the English language, such as Alev Lenz, DJ Quicksilver, DJ Sakin, and Mousse T. = Turkish-German Rappers = alt= UFO 361  Overview  Especially in the 1990s, Turkish-German rap groups have sold hundreds of thousands of albums and singles in Turkey, telling their stories of integration and assimilation struggles they experienced due to discrimination they faced during their upbringing in Germany.. Since the 2000s, many German rappers of Turkish descent achieved great success in Germany. Between May 2018 and October 2019 seven various German rap artist with roots in Turkey reached Nr. 1 of the German single charts: Mero (5x), Ufo361 (2x), Eno (2x), Summer Cem, KC Rebell, Gringo & Apache 207. There are also several female German rappers of Turkish origin, such as Hava (de), Xiara, MEL, Melisa Carolina, Ebow (de) and Lady Bitch Ray. Sports Football Nuri Şahin played for Turkey. Mesut Özil played for Germany national football team. Many football players of Turkish origin in Germany have been successful in first-division German and Turkish football clubs, as well as other European clubs. However, in regards to playing for national teams, many players of Turkish origin who were born in Germany have chosen to play for the Turkish national football team. This is partly due to Germany's strict rules on dual citizenship which forces German- Turks to choose whether to have German or Turkish citizenship by the age of 23 (in accordance with the German Citizenship Law of 1999). Nonetheless, in recent years there has been an increase in the number of players choosing to represent Germany. Those who have chosen to retain their Turkish citizenship and who have competed for Turkey include Cenk Tosun, Ceyhun Gülselam, Gökhan Töre, Hakan Balta, Hakan Çalhanoğlu, Halil Altıntop, Hamit Altıntop, İlhan Mansız, Nuri Şahin, Ogün Temizkanoğlu, Olcay Şahan, Mehmet Ekici, Serhat Akin, Tayfun Korkut, Tayfur Havutçu, Tunay Torun, Ümit Davala, Umit Karan, Volkan Arslan, Yıldıray Baştürk, Yunus Mallı, Kaan Ayhan, Kenan Karaman, Nazim Sangaré, Güven Yalçın, Berkay Özcan and Hasan Ali Kaldırım. The person of Turkish descent to play for the Germany national football team was Mehmet Scholl in 1993, followed by Mustafa Doğan in 1999 and Malik Fathi in 2006. Since the twenty-first century there has been an increase in German-born individuals of Turkish origin opting to play for Germany, including Emre Can, Kerem Demirbay, İlkay Gündoğan, Mesut Özil, Serdar Tasci and Suat Serdar. In regards to women's football, several players have chosen to play for the Turkish women's national football team, including Aylin Yaren, Aycan Yanaç, Melike Pekel, Dilan Ağgül, Selin Dişli, Arzu Karabulut, Ecem Cumert, Fatma Kara, Fatma Işık, Ebru Uzungüney and Feride Bakır. There are also players who plays for the German women's football national football team, including Sara Doorsoun and Hasret Kayıkçı. Several Turkish-German professional football players have also continued their careers as football managers such as Cem Efe and Taşkın Aksoy. =Turkish-German Football clubs= The Turkish community in Germany has also been active in establishing their own football clubs such as Berlin Türkspor 1965 (established in 1965) and Türkiyemspor Berlin (established in 1978). Türkiyemspor Berlin were the Champions in the Berlin- Liga in the year 2000. Moreover, they were the winners of the Berliner Landespokal in 1988, 1990, and 1991. Politics Cem Özdemir is co-chairman of the Green Party and one of those who proposed to recognize the Armenian Genocide. German politics The Turks in Germany began to be active in politics by establishing associations and federations in the 1960s and 1970s – though these were mainly based on Turkish politics rather than German politics. The first significant step towards active German politics occurred in 1987 when Sevim Çelebi became the first person of Turkish origin to be elected as an MP in the West Berlin Parliament. With the reunification of East Germany and West Germany, unemployment in the country had increased and some political parties, particularly the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), used anti-immigration discourses as a political tool in their campaigns. To counter this, many people of Turkish origin became more politically active and began to work in local elections and in the young branches of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Green Party. Several associations were founded by almost all German parties to organise meetings for Turkish voters. This played an important gateway for those who aspired to become politicians. =Federal Parliament= Aydan Özoğuz is the deputy chairperson of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. In 1994 Leyla Onur (de) from the SPD and Cem Özdemir from the Green Party became MPs in the Federal Parliament. They were both re- elected in the 1998 elections and were joined by Ekin Deligöz from the Green party. Deligöz and Özdemir were both re-elected as MPs for the Greens and Lale Akgün was elected as an MP for the SPD in the 2002 elections. Thereafter, Deligöz and Akgün were successful in being re-elected in the 2005 elections; the two female politicians were joined by Hakkı Keskin who was elected as an MP for the Left Party. By the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century, the number of German MPs of Turkish origin remained similar to the previous elections. In the 2009 elections Ekin Deligöz and Mehmet Kılıç were elected for the Greens, Aydan Özoğuz for the SPD, and Serkan Tören (de) for the FDP. Nonetheless, several Turkish-origin politicians were successful in becoming Ministers and co-Charis of political parties. For example, in 2008 Cem Özdemir became the co-chair of the Green Party. In 2010 Aygül Özkan was appointed as the Women, Family, Health and Integration Minister, making her the first ever minister of Turkish origin or the Muslim faith. In the same year, Aydan Özoğuz was elected as deputy chairperson of the SPD party. Moreover, by 2011, Bilkay Öney (de) from the SPD was appointed as Integration Minister in the Baden-Württemberg State.. Since the 2013 German elections, Turkish-origin MPs have been elected into Federal Parliament from four different parties. Cemile Giousouf, whose parents immigrated from Greece, became the first person of Western Thracian Turkish-origin to become an MP. Moreover, Giousouf became notable for being the first ever Turkish-origin and first ever Muslim to be elected as an MP from the CDU party.. Five MPs of Turkish-origin were elected from the SPD party including Aydan Özoğuz, Cansel Kızıltepe (de), Gülistan Yüksel (de), Metin Hakverdi (de) and Mahmut Özdemir. Özdemir is particularly notable for being the youngest MP in the German Parliament. For the Green Party, Cem Özdemir, Ekin Deligöz and Özcan Mutlu were elected as MPs, and Azize Tank (de) for the Left Party. =European Parliament= In 1989 Leyla Onur (de) from the SPD party was the first person of Turkish-origin to be a member of the European Parliament for Germany. By 2004 Cem Özdemir and Vural Öger also became members of the European Parliament. Since then, Ismail Ertug was elected as a Member of the European Parliament in 2009 and was re-elected in 2014. =Turkish-German political parties= On 26 June 2016, the \\"Allianz Deutscher Demokraten\\" (\\"Alliance of German Democrats\\") was founded as the first Turkish-German political party by Remzi Aru. The name of the party was officially announced at 14:53pm. Turkish politics Some Turks born or raised in Germany have entered Turkish politics. For example, Siegen-born, Justice and Development Party (AKP) affiliated Akif Çağatay Kılıç has been the Minister of Youth and Sports of Turkey since 2013. Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) affiliated Feleknas Uca is a Yazidi politician active in Germany and Turkey, where she is a member of parliament. Leyla İmret was raised in Bremen and in 2014 was elected mayor of Cizre. Germany is effectively Turkey's 4th largest electoral district. Around a third of this constituency vote in Turkish elections (570,000 in the 2015 parliamentary elections), and the share of Islamist votes for the Justice and Development Party (AKP) and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is even higher than in Turkey itself. Following the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt, huge pro-Erdogan demonstrations were held by Turkish citizens in German cities. The Economist suggested that this would make it difficult for Germany politicians to criticize Erdogan's policies and tactics. However, equally huge demonstrations by Turkish Kurds were also held in Germany some weeks later against Erdogan's 2016 Turkish purges and against the detention the HDP party co-chairpersons Selahattin Demirtaş and Figen Yüksekdağ in Turkey.

During the 1970s, the pork store was taken over by Johnny Soprano, a capo in the DiMeo crime family, when Francis Satriale failed to make payments on a gambling debt. It became a regular hangout for current members of the DiMeo crime family. The film location was located in Kearny, New Jersey. Satriale's Pork Store was recreated at 42 Market Street in Paterson () in 2019 for the filming of The Many Saints of Newark, a prequel to The Sopranos.  Location  Satriale's Pork Store is a meat market in Kearny, New Jersey. The interior walls of the storeroom where Emil \\"E-Mail\\" Kolar is murdered by Christopher Moltisanti has black and white framed photographs of classic actors and entertainers, like Humphrey Bogart, Frank Sinatra, Edward G. Robinson and Dean Martin, hanging on the walls. These actors were also known to portray anti-hero mob characters and in some cases associated with real mobsters during their careers. Although a mob-owned establishment, Satriale's runs a legitimate business, selling a variety of meats, pork and sausage, along with deli-style sandwiches. In the episode \\"Pilot,\\" Silvio Dante tells Tony, Paulie and the gang that his wife Gabriella Dante sends him to the store regularly because she thinks it sells the best capicola. FBI Agent Dwight Harris, who investigates Tony Soprano and the members of his family throughout the show, loves their veal parmesan sandwiches. In the episode \\"Toodle- Fucking-Oo,\\" Silvio tells Richie Aprile that Tony no longer discusses mob business directly with his capos, using Silvio Dante as an intermediary, and never discusses mob business at Satriale's anymore because of FBI surveillance. This angers Richie. The store also has a coffee bar which sells pastries and espresso, as seen in several episodes. In the large storefront windows hang cured hams and trussed pig carcasses, coils of pink-and-beige sausages, including a denuded chicken with its beak still in place. It is also prominently featured in the video game The Sopranos: Road to Respect. Anthony Infante, John Sacrimoni's brother-in-law, refers to Satriale's as a \\"chickery,\\" or a \\"poultry hatchery\\" when talking to imprisoned John in code, despite its not actually raising and hatching its own poultry. Satriale's is possibly based on Sacco's Meat Market located at 806 3rd Avenue in Elizabeth, New Jersey which served as the unofficial criminal headquarters of \\"Uncle Joe\\" Giacobbe, a veteran made man in the DeCavalcante crime family. Important events that occurred in Satriale's * Tony Soprano witnessed a violent encounter involving Mr. Satriale and his father, leading to his first panic attack later that day. * Christopher Moltisanti shot his first victim, Emil Kolar, in the rear of the store. * Silvio Dante and Paulie Gualtieri beat Ariel, the son-in-law of Shlomo Teittleman in a room in the upper floor of the store and debate with Tony whether or not to murder him. * After an explosive argument where Tony yells at Christopher and Brendan Filone about their successful hijacking of a Comley Trucking transport truck, a trucking company that operates under the \\"protection\\" of Tony's uncle Corrado Soprano, Brendan is picked up and thrown out of the back room and into the kitchen where he rolls over a table of fresh meat chops. He made the statement that Tony is really boss of the family since Jackie Aprile Sr. became the \\"Chemo\\"sabe, a reference to Jackie's cancer. This greatly angers Tony. * Christopher and Furio Giunta disposed of Richie Aprile's remains by using the meat saw and butchers knives to dismember his body. * Tony and Ralph Cifaretto are forced to make a decision regarding Jackie Aprile, Jr.'s future. * Finn revealed to Tony and other capos and associates his encounter with Vito two years prior where Vito was giving oral sex to a security guard in a car.

After the series was picked up by HBO, the producers leased a building with a store front in Kearny, New Jersey which served as the shooting location for exterior and interior scenes for the remainder of production; renamed Satriale's Pork Store. After the series ended, the building was demolished. The owner intended to sell bricks as souvenirs. The location inspired a deli of the same name in Sydney, Australia. See also *Bada Bing!

Tamilakam comprised that part of India south of the Maurya Empire in c. 250 BCE. Tamilakam refers to the geographical region inhabited by the ancient Tamil people. Tamilakam covered today's Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Puducherry, Lakshadweep and southern parts of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Traditional accounts and Tolkāppiyam referred these territories as a single cultural area, where Tamil was the natural language and culture of all people. The ancient Tamil country was divided into kingdoms. The best known among them were the Cheras, Cholas, Pandyans and Pallavas. During the Sangam period, Tamil culture began to spread outside Tamilakam. Ancient Tamil settlements were also found in Sri Lanka (Sri Lankan Tamils) and the Maldives (Giravarus). Etymology Part of Tamilakam from 244x244px \\"Tamiḻakam\\" is a portmanteau of a word and suffix from the Tamil language, namely Tamiḻ and -akam. It can be roughly translated as the \\"homeland of the Tamils\\". According to Kamil Zvelebil, the term seems to be the most ancient term used to designate Tamil territory in the Indian subcontinent. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, as well as Ptolemy's writings, mention the term \\"Limyrike\\" which corresponds to the Malabar Coast of south-western India. Based on a misinterpretation of the Roman map Tabula Peutingeriana and the possible phonetic connection between the words \\"Damir-\\" and \\"Tamil\\", some modern scholars have wrongly mentioned Limyrike as \\"Damirica\\" (or \\"Damirice\\"), considering it as a synonym of \\"Tamilakam\\". The \\"Damirice\\" mentioned in the Tabula Peutingeriana actually refers to an area between the Himalayas and the Ganges.  Extent  The term \\"Tamilakam\\" appears to be the most ancient term used for designating the Tamil territory. The earliest sources to mention it include Purananuru 168.18 and Patiṟṟuppattu Patikam 2.5. The Specific Preface (cirappuppayiram) of the more ancient text Tolkāppiyam mentions the terms tamil-kuru nal-lulakam (\\"the beautiful world [where] Tamil is spoken\\") and centamil ... nilam (\\"the territory ... of refined Tamil\\"). However, this preface, which is of uncertain date, is definitely a later addition to the original Tolkāppiyam. According to the Tolkāppiyam preface, \\"the virtuous land in which Tamil is spoken as the mother tongue lies between the northern Venkata hill and the southern Kumari.\\" The Silappadikaram (c. 2nd century CE) defines the Tamilakam as follows: While these ancient texts do not clearly define the eastern and western boundaries of the Tamilakam, scholars assume that these boundaries were the seas, which may explain their omission from the ancient definition. The ancient Tamilakam thus included the present-day Kerala. However, it excluded the present-day Tamil-inhabited territory in the North-East of Sri Lanka.  Subdivisions  Kingdoms Approximately during the period between 600 BCE to 300 CE, Tamiḻakam was ruled by the three Tamil dynasties: the Chola dynasty, the Pandyan dynasty and the Chera dynasty. There were also a few independent chieftains, the Velirs (Satyaputra). The earliest datable references to the Tamil kingdoms are in inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE during the time of the Maurya Empire. The Pandyan dynasty ruled parts of South India until the late 17th century. The heartland of the Pandyas was the fertile valley of the Vaigai River. They initially ruled their country from Korkai, a seaport on the southernmost tip of the Indian Peninsula, and in later times moved to Madurai. The Chola dynasty ruled from before the Sangam period (~3rd century BCE) until the 13th century in central Tamil Nadu. The heartland of the Cholas was the fertile valley of the Kaveri. The Chera dynasty ruled from before the Sangam period (~3rd century) until the 12th century over an area corresponding to modern-day western Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The Vealirs (Vēḷir) were minor dynastic kings and aristocratic chieftains in Tamiḻakam in the early historic period of South India. Nadus of Tamilakam Tamiḻakam was divided into political regions called Perunadu or \\"Great country\\", \\"nadu\\" means country. There were three important political regions which were Chera Nadu, Chola Nadu and Pandya Nadu. Along these three there were two more political regions of Athiyaman Nadu (Sathyaputha) and Thamirabharani Nadu (Then Paandi) which were later on absorbed into Chera resp. Pandya Nadu by 3rd century BCE. Tondai Nadu which was under Chola Nadu, later emerged as independent Pallava Nadu by 6th century CE. Again Tamilakam were divided into 12 socio-geographical regions called Nadu or \\"country\\". Each of this Nadu had their own dialect of Tamil. *Thenpandi Nadu *Panri Nadu *Kuda Nadu *Punal Nadu *Puzhi Nadu *Venadu *Aruva Nadu *KakkanaduHistory of the Tamils from the Earliest Times to 600 A.D., P.

The ancient Tamil inscriptions, ranging from 5th century BCE to 3rd century CE, are also considered as linguistic evidence for distinguishing Tamilakam from the rest of South India. The ancient non-Tamil inscriptions, such as those of the northern kings Ashoka and Kharavela, also allude to the distinct identity of the region. For example, Ashoka's inscriptions refer to the independent states lying beyond the southern boundary of his kingdom, and Kharavdela's Hathigumpha inscription refers to the destruction of a \\"confederacy of Tamil powers\\". However, the archaeological evidence does not support the existence of \\"Tamilakam\\" as a distinct cultural region: the material culture and habitations discovered in present-day Tamil Nadu and Kerala are also found elsewhere in peninsular India and Sri Lanka. Cultural influence With the advent of the early historical period in South India and the ascent of the three Tamil kingdoms in South India in the 6th century BCE, Tamil culture began to spread outside Tamiḻakam. Prior to 3rd century BCE, more Tamil settlers arrived in Sri Lanka. The Annaicoddai seal, dated to the 3rd century BCE, contains a bilingual inscription in Tamil-Brahmi.Though Tamils have been living in Sri Lanka since the Ancient era at least with universally accepted dates of at least the 10th century BCE showing signs of Tamil civilization in Sri Lanka Excavations in the area of Tissamaharama in southern Sri Lanka have unearthed locally issued coins produced between the second century BCE and the second century CE, some of which carry local Tamil personal names written in early Tamil letters,Mahadevan, I. \\"Ancient Tamil coins from Sri Lanka\\", pp. 152–154 which suggest that local Tamil merchants were present and actively involved in trade along the southern coast of Sri Lanka by the late classical period.Bopearachchi, O. \\"Ancient Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu\\", pp. 546–549 Around 237 BCE, \\"two adventurers from southern India\\" established the first Tamil rule at Sri Lanka. In 145 BCE Elara, a Chola general or prince known as Ellāḷaṉ took over the throne at Anuradhapura and ruled for forty-four years. Dutugamunu, a Sinhalese, started a war against him, defeated him, and took over the throne. Tamil Kings have been dated in Sri Lanka to at least the 3rd century BCE. Religion Hindus, Jains and Buddhists have coexisted in Tamil country for at least as early as the second century BCE.

Recorded in three recording studios, the album contains four compositions, each split into separate parts, that mostly originated as twelve-inch singles the band released in 1988. The record's inventive musical style features elements of industrial music, electro, dub, noise rock and hip hop music, and incorporates breakbeats, noise and sporadic rap vocals. The group also incorporated heavy usage of sampling in a fashion they compared to pop art. Television was a further influence on the record, and numerous items of television dialogue appear throughout Storm the Studio as samples. Named for a William S. Burroughs quote sampled on the album, Storm the Studio was greeted with critical acclaim upon release, and its dark tone helped distance Meat Beat Manifesto from the hedonistic dance music of the time. It has gone on to be considered a groundbreaking and innovative album, and has influenced numerous artists in the industrial, breakbeat, drum and bass and trip hop genres. It was re-released by TVT Records in 1993, Mute Records in 1994 and Run Recordings in 2003. A remix album, containing new remixes of the Storm the Studio by artists such as DJ Spooky and Jonah Sharp, was released by Tino Corp as Storm the Studio RMXS in 2003. Background and recording Swindon-based Meat Beat Manifesto began in 1987 when Jack Dangers and Jonny Stephens of the pop group Perennial Divide – who they had formed in 1986 and recorded the album Purge (1986) with – began releasing electronic side-project twelve-inch singles under the Meat Beat Manifesto name on Perennial Divide's label Sweatbox Records, the first of which was \\"Suck Hard\\" (1987). These were followed by the singles which later formed the basis of Storm the Studio, namely \\"I Got the Fear\\", \\"Strap Down\\" and \\"God O.D.\\" After Perennial Divide's dissolution, the newly prioritised Meat Beat Manifesto began recording their debut album soon after, naming the projected album Armed Audio Warfare and scheduling its release for May 1988, but the tapes were destroyed in a studio fire before the album could be released. Though the story was something of a rumour for many years, Jack Dangers confirmed the story of the fire in a 2010 interview. The band recorded Storm the Studio, their replacement debut album, at The Slaughterhouse in South Yorkshire, F2 Studios in London and at Drive Studios. It was mixed and mastered at London's Townhouse Studios. The Sound Defence Policy, presumably a pseudonym for Dangers, is credited for the album's production. Nix Lowrey The Quietus later noted how the material on Storm the Studio was rumoured to be the subsequent resurrection and \\"reshaping\\" of the material destroyed in the fire, although the band recreated what their debut album was supposed to have been like on their second album Armed Audio Warfare (1990), which takes its name from the proposed debut album and among its tracks includes alternate versions of several of the songs on Storm the Studio, some in the form of remixes and others in the form of unreleased original versions. Composition Production An Akai S1000 was used in the production of the album's samples. Storm the Studio makes heavy usage of sampling, with samples being collected onto a Casio DA1 DAT machine and then moved to a fully expanded Akai S1000. Band member Marcus Adams explained that unlike contemporaneous artists who use sampling, who Adams felt were doing it \\"because it's hip [...] because Public Enemy do it,\\" Meat Beat Manifesto used sampling \\"because it's a magpie thing [...] it's like pop art. The pop artists used to take other peoples' work and make it into their own, and we see sampling as doing that, we don't see it as 'we'll use that because it's a hip sound at the moment'.\\" Rather than primarily use music as a source for samples and influence, Storm the Studio was influenced by television and uses numerous samples of television shows and news items. According to Adams, the band would occasionally \\"get a track ready on the sampler so that we can sync that with the timecode, then the sampler is cued in so that when you play a record or tune in the television and as the track is running on, we can make samples which immediately go in time with the track.\\" This allowed the band to capture certain television dialogue samples and edit them unit they were in sync with the track. One journalist noted that \\"[t]he way in which Dangers and Adams generate samples incorporates a random element - this makes it stranger still that the samples seem so carefully chosen.\\" Jack Dangers enjoyed sampling sources that much of their audience would recognise, hence the appearance of a sample of a Michael Jackson song. The album was also the band's first release to use vocoders. The group enjoyed experimenting with different sounds to see which would be worth incorporating into the final product. Adams recorded the squeak of his sneaker on the ground, then sampled it and slowed it down, but he felt it \\"sounded really stupid\\" so did not use it on the album. The usage of a sample from children's series Rainbow, in which Zippy says \\"You're supposed to listen to the rhythm George, the rhythm of the music,\\" was explained by Adams: \\"There's not much else you can do when you're on the dole except watch Rainbow.\\" The band taped every episode of the show for three years looking for the particular scene so they could sample it. Another of the album's television-sourced samples, a news broadcaster saying \\"a spokesman at the Health Ministry said that to talk repeatedly about AIDS would cause the public to panic, tourism will certainly be affected,\\" was the result of what the group called a 'random edit,' although they kept it on the album because they felt it showed how the news \\"sounded like they were more concerned with tourism than peoples' lives. It was something that would make you think, rather than the 'DJ get on down' stuff.\\" Musical style Three of the band's early singles, namely \\"God O.D.\\", \\"Strap Down\\" and \\"I Got the Fear\\", as well as the new composition \\"Re- Animator\\", feature on Storm the Studio disassembled and remixed into four separate parts each, with the exception of \\"Strap Down\\", which only has three parts. Each of the four pieces are intended to fill one side of the double vinyl. Trouser Press wrote that the album stretches \\"the concept of the remix further than most,\\" finding few of the tracks on the album to sound similar to any of the record's other tracks, with Matthew Jeanes of Brainwashed echoing that \\"most of the record works through free association to connect the dots.\\" Describing its musical style, Trouser Press felt the album took \\"the groundbreaking electronic grooves\\" of Cabaret Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle as its base and significantly toughened them up, sporadically adding raps in a stream-of-consciousness style. Band founder Jack Dangers explained: \\"If you listen to Storm The Studio, there's vocals for all of the songs, but there are 4 different versions of each and not so many vocals on the other versions.\\" The album is named for a sample of William S. Burroughs saying \\"Storm the studio\\" which appears at the start of the album. Andy Hermann of PopMatters wrote that people were unable to pigeonhole the album into a single genre successfully, writing that it was referred to by different people upon release as an industrial, acid house, techno or hip hop album. Similarly, Ron Nachmann of SF Weekly said the album disregarded \\"the genre rules of the time\\" in its combination of hip hop breakbeats, scratch edits, bulky samples, electro tone, dub techniques and \\"industrial attitude.\\" John Bush of AllMusic felt the album combined the styles of noise rock, hip hop and \\"high-energy dub,\\" while Robert Christgau made note of the \\"industrial-strength samples\\", \\"annihilating rhythm\\" and occasional detours into electro dance. Matthew Jeanes of Brainwashed said the album \\"runs the gamut from funky breaks to outright noise.\\" Although a thread runs through all four parts of the record's opening track \\"God O.D.\\", the piece changes drastically throughout, with the ending of Part 4 bearing no resemblance to Part 1. The composition is noisy and funky, with the lyrics \\"It's genocide, can't you see?/Genocide in the first degree\\" being shouted by the band's then-vocalist Johnny Stephens. The first part of \\"Re-Animator\\" is a funky club track containing vocals, whereas by the fourth part, the piece has transformed into a psychedelic dub style incorporating \\"half-time rhythm layers of tape noise, reverberating voices, and feedback,\\" with Jeanes noting that \\"[s]ometimes a bass line or a sample repeats, other times, it doesn't.\\" \\"Strap Down\\" begins with drums that have been compared to machine guns and numerous loops that one reviewer felt \\"[sound] like a marching band fighting with a circus over a breakbeat.\\" Several minutes of bass bursts, changes in rhythm the repetition of the title phrase follow, followed thereafter by the drastically different, seven-minute second part of the piece, which keeps to a fast tempo. At the six-minute mark, this part is starkly altered by the introduction of a self-described \\"annihilating rhythm.\\" \\"I Got the Fear\\" repeats phrases from previous tracks, such as \\"reanimate\\" and \\"re-animator\\", turning the album \\"into a kind of mobius strip of samples and themes\\" in the words of Jeanes, who commented that \\"If Jack Dangers isn't literally sampling himself here, he is quite figuratively doing it by recycling his own ideas from one track to the next without any regard for which sounds or ideas belong to which songs.\\" Release In the United Kingdom, Storm the Studio was released on 20 February 1989 by Sweatbox Records, a label who signed the group after they presented them with some demo recordings. In the United States, it was released by Wax Trax!, which led to the group being regarded as an industrial band, despite Dangers' and Jonny Stephens' dislike for being pigeonholed. Dangers later told one interviewer he was not concerned by the labelling, as he felt \\"industrial\\" meant different things in different countries. He later said that when he moved to the United States, \\"industrial was like Ministry, Frontline Assembly, Nine Inch Nails. I just didn't get it, there were too many guitars. Industrial to me is Einstürzende Neubauten, Test Dept, SPK. I love those bands; if we're only connected to that light, great. It was mainly the Wax Trax thing, because we were licensed to Wax Trax. We weren't on Wax Trax anywhere else in the world. It was only here.\\" Storm the Studio features artwork designed by the agency Accident, and was named after one of the album's samples, a clip of postmodernist writer William S. Burroughs declaring \\"Storm the studio,\\" which is used as the start of \\"God O.D. (Part 1)\\". \\"Strap Down (Part 3)\\" was only made available on the vinyl editions and later the digital edition, with the song being removed from CD and cassette releases. Regardless, American CD releases have incorrectly listed Part 3 on the sleeve. The album had become out of print after several years, leading to the album's CD re-release in the United States by TVT Records in 1993 and by Mute Records in 1994, the latter time with different artwork, designed by Rich Borge. Storm the Studio and Armed Audio Warfare were re-released again by Run Recordings on 22 July 2003, newly remastered by Jack Dangers and again with redesigned album sleeves by Rich Borge.\\" Critical reception Upon release, Storm the Studio received acclaim from music critics and was praised for its distinctive style. Writing for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau rated the album B+, indicating \\"a good record, at least one of whose sides can be played with lasting interest and the other of which includes at least one enjoyable cut.\\" He wrote that, \\"Bill Burroughs having given the word, these Brit art-schoolers shape two years of 12-inches into four sides of industrial-strength samples and 'annihilating rhythm.' And though they do sometimes settle for electrodance, the laughs and abrasions keep on coming. Among retrospective reviews, Matthew Jeanes of Brainwashed noted that although Storm the Studio was \\"released on the cusp of the DJ record/remix fetish of the 1990s,\\" when maxi-singles containing numerous remixes of the A-side were commonplace, Storm the Studio was \\"about as far from a remix 12\\" as possible\\" despite only listing four songs, citing this as one of several enigmatic qualities to the album. He wrote that \\"somehow getting lost\\" in the album makes a degree of sense, given that the record \\"is constantly folding in on itself from different direction,\\" and also found that the album's eclectic style and \\"memorable lead ins\\" transformed the album into \\"the perfect DJ tool except for the fact that it's almost impossible to know what the record is going to sound like wherever you drop the needle. I love that this record takes so many strange turns, even if I've never known quite how to navigate through them.\\" John Bush of AllMusic rated the album four and a half stars out of five, calling it a \\"four-track mini- album\\" and noted the influence of dub and hip hop on the remixes, while also stating that the album is \\"just as dense and sample-heavy\\" as the original singles created by the band. Jason Josephes of Pitchfork later called the album a \\"sheer work of genius.\\" Dutch magazine OOR ranked the album at number 25 in their list of the 50 best albums of 1989, while in 1994, Nieuwe Revu ranked the album at number 62 in its list of the \\"Top 100 Albums of All Time.\\" In 2006, VPRO named the album as one of the 299 greatest albums of all time, and in 2014, Rockdelux named the album as one of the 500 greatest albums released between 1984–2004. The album is also celebrated in a brief blurb included in the liner notes of the compilation box set Black Box – Wax Trax! Records: The First 13 Years (1994). Legacy Storm the Studio has been hailed as groundbreaking and innovative by music critics. The album was released when \\"house and techno ruled the dancefloor\\" in the words of Ron Nachmann of SF Weekly, who wrote that Storm the Studio marked a change in that it \\"put said dance floor on notice\\" with a message that \\"simplistic hedonism was dead.\\" He wrote that the album's titular William S. Burroughs sample upended the \\"get down\\" paradigm of dance music and \\"urged listeners to seize the means of production, to create chaos, to do something.\\" He also described the album as having \\"blasted the genre rules of the time, boosting hip hop breakbeats, substantive samples, scratch edits, and electro flavor with dub technique and industrial attitude.\\" Andy Hermann of PopMatters, who called the album genuinely \\"seminal\\", wrote that the album's musical style was so unprecedented that critics found it hard to write about: Storm the Studio influenced The Chemical Brothers' musical approach. The album has proven influential, with Alex Veronac of Release Magazine writing that the album affected many musicians and producers in the techno, noise, industrial and dance scenes, while William Tilland of AllMusic wrote that the album's \\"heavy, pounding mix of dub, hip-hop, and incipient techno impulses\\" were influential on many drum and bass and trip hop artists which emerged throughout the 1990s. Quinn Morrison Vice wrote that the \\"seminal\\" album remains \\"a truly major milestone of breaks-based electronica.\\" He stated that: \\"The influence of this record cannot be overestimated. Without it, the music of everyone from Nine Inch Nails to the Chemical Brothers to Fatboy Slim just wouldn't be the same.\\" Nix Lowrey of The Quietus noted the album's influence on the Chemical Brothers' debut album Exit Planet Dust (1995). A remix album of newly commissioned remixes of the Storm the Studio material, Storm the Studio RMXS, was released by Tino Corp on 23 September 2003. Those remixing the material on the album include Eight Frozen Modules, Merzbow and Frank Bretschneider, English producers Scanner and Jonah Sharp, and American producers DJ Spooky, DJ Swamp and The Opus. Meat Beat Manifesto have continued playing material live from the album; for their 2008 tour, which included accompanying visuals, Dangers tracked down the television clips that were used on the Storm the Studio material on the set list. During the band's sets, the accompanying visuals to the samples were displayed on-screen. The band would continue to use the visuals in later performances of the material. In 2008, Dangers described Storm the Studio as \\"a part of me,\\" despite admitting he rarely plays the album. Track listing All songs written by Jack Dangers #\\"God O.D.

The China rockfish has a distinctive appearance, with a dark blue or black body crossed by a patchy but obvious yellow stripe that extends from around the third dorsal spine down and then along the lateral line. Although the black-and-yellow rockfish is similar in appearance, the China rockfish has a continuous yellow band while the black-and-yellow has scattered patches of yellow. The body of the China rockfish may be covered with small whitish or yellowish spots. Maximum reported size is 45 cm (18 inches). Early life history is little-known; juveniles have been observed in shallow coastal water. Adults are solitary and territorial, preferring rocky outcrops with boulder fields and crevices. When confronted with an intruder, the fish erect its spines and try to look larger. The territories are apparently small, with a study off Vancouver Island finding Chinas moving only within 10 m (33 ft). They feed on benthic organisms, including brittle stars, chitons, and crustaceans such as crabs and shrimp. They have been popular for commercial fishing since the 19th century. During the 1930s, Chinas sold for twice as much as any other rockfish except the black-and-yellow rockfish, and for more than any other kind of finfish. They are today popular in Asia, often being sold alive. Commercial fishing methods include hook and line, longline, and trapping. The species epithet nebulosus is Latin for \\"clouded\\". Although Jordan and Evermann promoted the common name \\"yellowspotted rockfish\\", the \\"China\\" name has persisted, due to a perceived preference by persons of Chinese ancestry living in central California. The species was actually described by both W. O. Ayres and Charles Frédéric Girard in the same year, with Girard naming the species S. fasciatus, but the name had already been used for the Acadian redfish and thus Ayres' choice prevailed. Stock status A stock assessment of China rockfish conducted in 2015 estimated the stock to be at 28% of unfished level in California, but less depleted in Oregon and Washington, at 62% and 73%, respectively. However, the stock in California waters (which only included the area up to Cape Mendocino) was estimated as showing an increasing trend in abundance, as this area had seen larger reductions in catch than the other areas.

The facility consisted of all of the buildings that comprised Edgewood State Hospital and three buildings from Pilgrim State Hospital, in addition to numerous temporary buildings, and was named in honor of Brigadier General Charles Field Mason, who had served in the Army Medical Corps.  History  The hospital operated between 1944 and 1946, and was used for treating the psychological casualties of the battlefield as well as for other related uses. During the hospital's brief operation, the controversial documentary film Let There Be Light was shot there by famed filmmaker John Huston. The film showed the steps that shell- shocked soldiers took in their rehabilitation towards a normal life after discharge. However, the film was deemed so potentially controversial that the government kept it hidden from the public until 1981. After 1946, the War Department handed control of Mason General back to New York State, where Edgewood Hospital was managed by Pilgrim, and the three buildings at Pilgrim that partially comprised Mason, 81, 82, and 83, reverted to their parent complex. Edgewood ceased operation in 1971 and was demolished in 1989 following years of extensive vandalism and neglect. Buildings 81–83 at Pilgrim, the last surviving remnants of Mason General Hospital, are still in use by Pilgrim today.

The novel is set thirteen years after the Battle of Endor in the Star Wars expanded universe. Plot \\"Somewhere in the galaxy, millions suddenly perish—a disruption of the Force so shocking it is felt by Luke at his Jedi academy and by Leia on Coruscant. While Leia must deal with an assassination attempt, a rumored plot against the New Republic, and allegations that Han Solo is involved, Luke seeks out a former Jedi student who may hold the key to the mass destruction. But Brakiss is only the bait in a deadly trap set by a master of the dark side who is determined to rule as emperor. He's targeted Luke, Leia, and Leia's children to die. Then billions will follow, in a holocaust unequaled in galactic history.\\" Background Mass murder has always rattled the Force. In Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Obi-Wan Kenobi experiences the suffering of the deaths of millions from the destruction of Alderaan. In The New Rebellion, Luke Skywalker will experience the same emotion. Thirteen years after the Battle of Endor, the New Republic has defeated most of the Galactic Empire and many ex-Imperial star systems have joined the ranks. Moreover, corruption has spread throughout the ranks, which a series of antagonists are waiting to capitalize on. Summary Kueller, a Dark Jedi, destroys millions with his powers. Luke Skywalker feels this genocide, and is afraid that the destruction will continue. Meanwhile, an assassination attempt is made on Princess Leia Organa, which is blamed on Han Solo. However, this is quickly discovered to be Kueller's doing. Luke decides to seek the aid of Brakiss, a former student. However, Brakiss is in on Kueller's plan, and Luke joins the spiral of death that is to follow. Eventually, Luke Skywalker is led to Kueller, though a wake of destruction is left behind.

First, he kills over a million innocent natives of the planet Pydyr and then sets off a bomb in the New Republic Senate Hall. As Jedi Master Luke Skywalker searches for the one behind all of this, Leia Organa Solo has her own problems arising from conflicts with newly elected former imperials in the senate, and the framing of her husband Han Solo by the smuggler Jarril, who is suspected to be responsible for the senate bombing. As Han Solo travels with Chewbacca to the Smuggler's Run to investigate the actions of Jarril in hopes of getting to the bottom of the Senate bombing, Luke Skywalker visits Brakiss on Telti looking for information, and Lando Calrissian heads to The Run after Han Solo who he fears is in danger. Meanwhile, Cole Fardreamer, with the aid of R2-D2 and C-3PO, discovers a plot to install all New Republic X-wing's with remote detonators. Leia becomes aware of this and concedes her position as Chief of State to Mon Mothma in order to rescue Luke from Kueller who has taken him prisoner on Almania. After Han rescues Lando, rather than Lando rescuing Han, from the clutches of the crime lord Nandreeson, and the two of them aide hundreds of smugglers after an accidental bombing of the run, Han also heads to Almania to rescue Luke. Han arrives at Almaniain the midst of a vicious battle between New Republic forces led by Wedge Antilles and Kueller's fleet. Han is also met by Talon Karrde and Mara Jade who have brought Ysalamiri to assist in the battle against Kueller. After a long gruelling battle against Kueller, in which Kueller has gained a tremendous amount of power fueled by Luke's own anger at himself for allowing Kueller to fall to the dark side, Luke is preparing himself for death at Kuellers hands as Han arrives on the scene with the Ysalamir, sapping both Luke and Kueller of their power, and in doing so allows Leia to finish Kueller with two lethal blaster shots. R2-D2 and C-3PO simultaneously thwart Kueller's plan to detonate millions of droids across the galaxy, enabling Leia to return to Coruscant and regain her post as Chief of State from Mon Mothma\\" Reception The New Rebellion was a New York Times' and a Wall Street Journal bestseller, like a majority of the Star Wars Bantam Spectra releases.

He was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1947, and grew up in Wausau, Wisconsin where his father taught chemistry at the Wausau campus of the University of Wisconsin. Steve Weiner later studied writing at the University of California. In 1970 he married Deborah Blacker. Blacker. He continued to live and work in California for most of the 1970s, including a period working for Frank deFelitta, the film director and screenwriter. He is a citizen of the United States and Canada and a Permanent Resident of the UK.Author's questionnaire provided to New Star Books; supplemental biographical information provided by Steve Weiner to New Star Books, December 29, 2011. Weiner's exposure to the film industry, and his interest particularly in contemporary animated film from Eastern Europe --- particularly the work of Jan Lenica, Daniel Szczechura and Walerian Borowczyck --- as well as the Brothers Quay has been a marked influence on his work. He has published three novels. Published works Weiner's 1993 debut novel The Museum of Love was published by Bloomsbury UK and subsequently by Kodansha in Japan, The Overlook Press in the United States and Canada, and Belfond in France. It earned comparisons to William S. Burroughs, Céline, Jean Genet, David Lynch and Todd Haynes for its blend of surrealism and dark eroticism, and was a nominee for the inaugural Giller Prize. His second novel, The Yellow Sailor, was published in 2001 by the Overlook Press of Woodstock & New York. The novel consists almost entirely of curt, sardonic dialogue interrupted by terse descriptions of a grotesque world of anti-semitism and nationalism that surrounds its merchant-sailor protagonists in the Europe of World War I. The novel's title is also the name of their ship, which sails from Hamburg in 1914. The cover of the North American hardcover and paperback editions is illustrated with a painting by Otto Dix, \\"Abschied von Hamburg,\\" dated 1921. Weiner's third novel, Sweet England, was published in 2010 by New Star Books, a Vancouver-based literary press. It tells the story of a man of no known origin and unstable personality and his efforts to re–enter society after a long and unexplained absence. The man, who is given the name Jack by another character he encounters, falls into a relationship with a woman named Brenda Lee, and much of the novel concerns the relationship between Jack and Brenda, whose death is the occasion for a Coroner's Inquest that provides the action for the last third of the novel. The novel's action takes place against a backdrop of post-Thatcher London, rendered by Weiner into a dark and phantasmagorical dreamscape. The cover illustration is also by the Brothers Quay, the London-based animated filmmakers Stephen and Timothy Quay. Weiner's writing is characterised by its exceptionally bold telegraphic style, one that has a truly cinematic feel in the sheer convulsive power of the images that are evoked and their deeply unsettling visionary tone. He would even seem to defy the cinema (unless one were to think of the more theatrical and stylized approach of certain animators and graphic artists). He is, however, also able to achieve in his phantasmagorical and often violent universe an exceedingly delicate and fragile realm of characters despite their being inhabited by a world all too overwhelmingly hostile and mad.

Aged 20, he was convicted of murder and executed in connection with the Altona Bloody Sunday (Altonaer Blutsonntag) riot, a Sturmabteilung (SA) march on 17 July 1932 that turned violent and led to 18 people being shot and killed.asfpg ~ Altonaer Stiftung für philosophische Grundlagenforschung His conviction was overturned in November 1992.  Life  Born in Kiel to an Italian mother, Tesch spent his childhood in Italy before moving to live with his stepfather in Hamburg in 1925, where he was an apprentice plumber. Finding himself unemployed after his apprenticeship was over, he entered the Freiwilliger Arbeitsdienst (FAD), or Volunteer Work Service. Politically radical, he joined the Socialist Worker Youth (Sozialistische Arbeiterjugend) in 1930, but soon switched to the Young Communist League of Germany (Kommunistischer Jugendverband Deutschlands). Altona Bloody Sunday On 17 July 1932, later known in German history as the Altonaer Blutsonntag, some Communists, with Tesch among them, tried to disrupt a march by the Nazis through a working-class area in Altona. Arguments and shoving escalated, culminating in gunfire that killed four SA members and 16 others, the latter group likely by uncontrolled police gunfire. Tesch, who was involved in the violence, was later alleged to have fired shots in the incident. After the National Socialist German Workers Party seized power, the case was brought before the National Socialist Special Court (Sondergerichte) in Altona. Although the investigation turned up no solid proof of Tesch's guilt, and it could not be proved that Tesch had brought a weapon to the demonstration, he was nonetheless sentenced to death along with Walter Möller, Karl Wolff and August Lütgens. When Hermann Göring refused to commute the sentences of the four, on 1 August 1933, in the courthouse courtyard – now home to Altona's Local Court – they were beheaded. These were the first officially declared executions in the Third Reich. Memorials and acquittal Arnold Zweig's 1947 book The Axe of Wandsbek was written about Altona Bloody Sunday and was subsequently filmed in East Germany in 1951 (and, again, in West Germany in 1981). Goethe Institute, Washington DC: website notes for showing of both films on 13 and 15 December 2010. In East Germany, a school in Klausdorf as well as a street in Wismar were named after Bruno Tesch. Despite political resistance, a former comprehensive school in Hamburg-Altona was named after Bruno Tesch. All those sentenced to death had their convictions overturned on 13 November 1992 by the Hamburg State Court. Further sentences meted out by the Sondergericht in connection with the Altonaer Blutsonntag were reversed on 21 June 1996 and 29 June 1998.

The Decree of War to the Death, in Spanish Decreto de Guerra a Muerte, was a decree issued by the South American leader Simón Bolívar which permitted murder and any atrocities whatsoever to be committed against civilians born in Spain, other than those actively assisting South American independence, and furthermore exonerated Latin Americans who had already committed such murders and atrocities. The phrase \\"war to the death\\" was used as a euphemism for these atrocities. The decree was an explicit \\"war of extermination\\" in Bolívar's attempt to maintain Venezuelan independence in the war with Spain, since he felt that the Spanish Army's use of atrocities against those who supported the First Republic of Venezuela had contributed decisively to its defeat.Arana, M. (2013). Bolivar. New York: Simon & Schuster, Bolívar promulgated the decree on June 15, 1813, in the Venezuelan city of Trujillo. Background The decree states that it was created as a response to severe crimes and massacres by Spanish soldiers after the fall of the First Republic, in which Spanish leaders allegedly stole property and executed thousands of Republicans: \\"we could not indifferently watch the afflictions inflicted to you by the barbaric Spaniards, who have annihilated you with robbery and destroyed you with death, infringed the most solemn treaties and capitulations [a reference to the San Mateo Capitulation, 1812]; in one word, committed every crime, reducing the Republic of Venezuela to the most horrific desolation.\\" It proclaimed that all Peninsular people in Spanish America who didn't actively participate in favor of its independence would be killed, and all South Americans would be spared, even if they had cooperated with the Spanish authorities.Stoan, Pablo Morillo, 47-50. (See below for full declaration). The document's ultimate goal was to assure the Venezuelan elites that they would not be unfavorably treated for having collaborated with Domingo de Monteverde and the royalist authorities. The Decree was the first step in transforming the common and legal view of the Venezuelan war of liberation from a mere rebellion (or at best a civil war) taking place in one of Spain's colonies, to a full-fledged international war between two distinct countries, Venezuela and Spain. Practice of the \\"Guerra a Muerte\\" This so- called Guerra a Muerte was widely practised on both sides, resulting in some extreme brutalities on both sides, such as the execution of Spanish prisoners in Caracas and La Guaira in February 1814, on orders from Bolívar himself, just before the collapse of the Second Republic of Venezuela, and the killing of several renowned citizens in New Granada by the royalist army under Pablo Morillo in 1815, 1816 and 1817. The declaration remained in effect until November 26, 1820, when General Pablo Morillo met with Bolívar at Santa Ana de Trujillo to declare the war of independence a conventional war.  Text of the Decree  Note: The term \\"Americans\\" here means natives of the American continent. \\"Venezuelans: an army of brothers, sent by the sovereign Congress of New Granada, has come to free you, and it is already amongst you, after evicting the oppressors from the provinces of Mérida and Trujillo. We are the ones sent to destroy the Spaniards, to protect the Americans, and to reestablish the republican governments that formed the Confederation of Venezuela. The states covering our arms (weapons) are once again ruled by their old constitutions and magistrates, fully enjoying their liberty and independence; for our mission is only to break the chains of servitude, which still oppress some of our peoples, not claiming to create laws, or enforce acts of domination, which the right of war could authorize us to do. Touched by your misfortunes, we could not indifferently watch the afflictions inflicted to you by the barbaric Spaniards, who have annihilated you with robbery and destroyed you with death, infringed the most solemn treaties and capitulations; in one word, committed every crime, reducing the Republic of Venezuela to the most horrific desolation. It is so that justice demands vindication, and necessity forces us to take it. May the monsters that infest Colombian soil, and have covered it with blood disappear for good; may their punishment be equal to the magnitude of their treason, so that the stain of our ignominy is washed off, and to show the nations of the universe that the sons of America cannot be offended without punishment. In spite of our just resentments against the iniquitous Spaniards, our magnanimity still deigns itself to open, for the last time, a route to conciliation and friendship; we still invite them to live peacefully among us, if, hating their crimes and turning to good faith, they cooperate with us in the destruction of the intruding government of Spain, and the reestablishment of the Republic of Venezuela. All Spaniards who do not conspire against tyranny in favor of our just cause, using the most effective and active resources, will be considered enemies, and will be punished as traitors to the homeland, and therefore, will be promptly executed. On the other hand, a general and absolute pardon is issued to all Spaniards who pass into our army, with or without their weapons; to those who offer aid to the good citizens working hard to shake off the shackles of tyranny. War officers and magistrates that proclaim the government of Venezuela and join our cause will keep their destinies and work positions; in one word, all Spaniards who perform service for the State will be reputed and treated as Americans. And you, Americans, who have been separated from the road of justice by error and perfidy, know that your brothers forgive you and seriously regret your misdeeds, intimately persuaded that you cannot be guilty, and that only the ignorance and blindness imposed on you by the authors of your crimes could cause you to perpetrate them. Do not fear the sword that comes to avenge you and cut the ignominious bindings which tie you to your executioners' fate. Rely on absolute immunity for your honor, life and properties; the mere title of Americans will be your warranty and safeguard. Our weapons have come to protect you, and will never be used against a single one of our brothers. This amnesty extends to the very traitors who have most recently committed their acts of felony; and will be so religiously carried out that no reason, cause or pretext will be enough to make us break our offer, no matter how extraordinary the reasons you give us to excite our adversity. Spaniards and Canarians, count on death, even if indifferent, if you do not actively work in favor of the independence of America. Americans, count on life, even if guilty.\\" (Please note, this English translation is subject to scrutiny.) References Bibliography *Stoan, Stephen K. Pablo Morillo and Venezuela, 1815-1820.

The building was constructed in 1892, and housed one of the best known Chinese charity medical centres in Singapore. Traditional Chinese doctors or sinsehs used to dispense free treatment and medicine to patients of all races in Singapore. Today, it is used as a commercial building for the Singapore office for Forever Living Products. The current Thong Chai Medical Institution was located in Thong Chai Building, 50 Chin Swee Road.https://www.stcmi.sg/Public/en/STCMI_P_Contactus.aspx History Today, the Old Thong Chai Medical Institution building is used as a retail shop for a healthcare company which is Forever Living Products. In 1867, two Chinese merchants got together to set up Singapore's first traditional Chinese medical institution for the poor. These compassionate men saw an urgent need for a charitable organisation that provided medical advice and assistance to those who could not afford to pay for it. Thong Chai dispensed free medical consultation, treatment and herbal medicines to the poor, regardless of race or religion. Its sincere efforts were appreciated and recognised and more benefactors joined its ranks. They came from all Chinese communities: Cantonese, Hoklo (Hokkien), Teochew, Hainanese and Hakka. Initially, Thong Chai operated out of a small rented shophouse on Upper Pickering Street, then known as Upper Macao Street. It was then called Tong Chay Ee Say. In 1892, it bought the building at 50 Eu Tong Sen Street, with which it has become most strongly associated, and changed its name to Thong Chai Medical Institution. From this building, Thong Chai continued to serve the poor and sick but it also became a centre for business and political activities. Several clan associations set up their headquarters there; the Chinese Chamber of Commerce was conceived in this building, and its first office operated there until 1906 when it moved to its own premises. In the early years of the twentieth century, when political tensions between China and Japan rose high, Chinese loyalists held public meetings at Thong Chai to garner support for their motherland. Thong Chai Medical Institution is now located in a ten-storey building in Chin Swee Road, carrying on the Thong Chai tradition much in the way of its predecessors. They celebrated 150 years of operations in 2017. The Old Thong Chai Medical Institution was gazetted as a national monument on 6 July 1973. Commercial history The late 1990s saw the building first becoming a nightclub and later a number of restaurants. In 2000, the building was acquired by Tung Lok Group and the building became a restaurant known as Jing. Not long after its opening, the group revamped its concept and named it Asian. Both restaurants proved to be unpopular, and it closed down in 2003 due to SARS outbreak. The building was unused for around two years and it was converted into its current use in 2005. The building is currently owned by Forever Living Products Intl, a multi-level marketing company selling aloe vera products. The company bought the building from the government in 2005 for S$7 million. The furnishing and such cost the company an additional $3 million as they imported the antique furnitures from Malaysia and China. Architecture The typically southern Chinese building on Eu Tong Sen Street comprises three main halls aligned on a central axis and separated by courtyards and an air well. In keeping with the social principles of southern Chinese architecture, the importance of the halls in the hierarchy of the building is reflected in the height of their ceilings. Another atypical feature is the roof. Although the decorative elements on the roof ridge are in the southern Chinese style, the ridge itself is not. Unlike the characteristic curve of a southern Chinese roof ridge, this one is completely straight. Decorating the roof are friezes of Chinese scenery executed in plaster relief work and wave-like gable end walls.

The CEO for the company (Georges-Pierre Reich) represented Reich Technologies on the committee, and was involved in the development of the proposal. The proposal was submitted to the Object Management Group (OMG), which approved the proposal, circa late 1997. Profile Reich Technologies is an international group of companies, providing a coordinated suite of products and services to support object-oriented (OO) software development in large corporations. With a presence throughout Europe and North America, Reich Technologies occupies leading positions in the world markets for integrated OO CASE tools, fine-grained object repositories and OO team programming environments. The Intelligent Software Factory (ISF) offers an integrated object-oriented CASE tool suite. It is built on the concept of model-driven development in which the work done at the beginning of a project creates an environment for configuration management and cost containment for software maintenance. ISF has been originally built by Franck Barbier, a French researcher on OO modeling. The Intelligent Artifact Repository (IAR) provides an enterprise-wide resource for the management and reuse of Information System assets. This concept is so powerful that the development team uses ISF and IAR for production, making ISF the first CASE tool to be self-generated. Recognizing the impact of introducing tools, Reich Technologies offers success oriented services including training, consulting and tool customizations. Corporations combine tools, services and processes with their own organizations to implement a Corporate Software Ecology. Reich Technologies worked with Alistair Cockburn (special advisor to the Central Bank of Norway) and Ralph Hodgson (founder of TopQuadrant) to flesh out the concept of Use Case and integrate it in the context of Responsibility-Driven Design. Several large companies have built systems upon these constructs since 1992. Structured Use Cases and detailed Responsibility models proved to be a relevant answer to the challenge of gathering and organizing thousands of requirements, defining the scope of the system, and designing an architecture for objects. A methodology with processes and identified deliverables has been created in a joint effort. As tool builders, Reich Technologies adds the knowledge of implementing lifecycle management for the meta-model objects. Reich Technologies has also extensive experience designing the meta-models that implement in ISF the modeling notations of diverse methodologists.

It was headquartered in the Francis E. Coe Administration Building. On March 8, 2011, residents voted to disband the city school district, effectively merging it with the Shelby County School District. The merger took effect July 1, 2013. After much legal maneuvering, all six incorporated municipalities (other than Memphis) planned to create separate school districts in 2014. Total enrollment, as of the 2010-2011 school year, was about 103,000 students, which made the district the largest in Tennessee. In August 2014 there were six new municipal school districts. Collierville Schools, Bartlett City Schools, Millington Municipal Schools, Germantown Municipal Schools, Arlington Community Schools and Lakeland School System since MCS and SCS merged in one county school district. Shelby County Schools serves the city of Memphis and unincorporated areas of Shelby County, Tennessee. History Memphis City Schools was the school district operating public schools in Memphis, Tennessee. Memphis formed this school district in 1830. This procedure was done since the first Memphis schools were charted without an public school district. The first recorded school was \\"Clay Street School\\" that was built in 1873. Some of the schools were segregated in Memphis City Schools, while others were not. Segregation started in Memphis City Schools in 1864 to 1890 and started back years later until things had changed. Spanish sign of Berclair Elementary School In the mid-1960s the district had about 130,000 students. The numbers of white students and black students were almost equal. The federal government ordered desegregation in Memphis schools in the 1950s. As a result, Memphis City Schools began desegregation in May 1954. This procedure was done effectively since some of the Memphis schools were all white, but progress was slow. In the mid-1960s the district still segregated its schools. Daniel Kiel, a law professor at the University of Memphis who had authored publications about school integration in Memphis, said the efforts to desegregate were, as paraphrased by Sam Dillon of The New York Times, \\"subterfuge and delay\\". Desegregation first began with the Memphis 13, a group of first graders. The federal government ordered desegregation busing in Memphis in the early 1970s. As a result, massive white flight occurred in Memphis City Schools beginning in 1973. The school district had 71,000 white students. In 1977, the last recorded white students were in Memphis City Schools. Forty thousand white students left while the other 30,000 stayed in the school district. In July 2011, the Memphis City Schools Board of Commissioners voted to postpone opening Memphis City Schools indefinitely until the Memphis City Council provides money set aside for the school system. The incident was reported in national news. In 2011 Marcus Pohlmann, a Rhodes College political science professor, wanted to study the Memphis schools to compare performances of schools with low income student bodies and schools with higher income student bodies. He concluded that he was unable to do so because \\"There are no middle-class black schools in Memphis. They’re all poor.\\" School uniforms All MCS students were needed to wear school uniforms from the fall of 2002 until the district was dissolved in 2013. Students could wear oxford shirts, polo shirts, turtlenecks, and blouses with \\"Peter Pan\\" collars. Colors varied, depending upon the school. In general, all white shirts were acceptable. Sweatshirts had to be white, black, navy blue, tan or any other colors approved by the individual campus. Trousers, shorts, skirts, and jumpers had to be black, tan, or navy blue. Denim clothing was not allowed. When MCS and SCS merged in 2013, the former MCS schools kept this uniform policy while the existing SCS schools did not, since the suburbs plan to form their own districts and leave SCS within a year.

It tells both Lucy's and Tony's sides of the story. # Mate, Dates and You Main characters * Lucy Lovering — A very sweet and petite girl who lives in Muswell Hill in northern London. Lucy has blonde hair, has small breasts, and is four feet eight inches tall (later five feet). Her father owns a health store, so there are always strange, healthy New Age meals and products at her house (although Lucy's secret dream is to come home and find out dinner is chicken burgers). Lucy aspires to be a fashion designer, and along the books already makes some clothes for her and her friends. She also likes to make jokes, and has two older brothers, Steve and Lal. Lucy dates Nesta's brother, Tony, on and off throughout the series, but is also seeing others throughout the course of the books. For a while, she dates a seemingly perfect boy, Daniel, but finds he is controlling and suffocating. On a school trip to Italy, Lucy goes out with an Italian-American boy called Teddy Ambosini Junior. Her birthday is May 24, which makes her a Gemini. * Isobel \\"Izzie\\" Foster — A tall, dark-haired girl who is into all sorts of New Age and spiritual stuff, Izzie loves horoscopes, tarot readings, and meditation techniques, and is always showing them to her mates as well. Izzie becomes a vegetarian and she loves the way of life at Lucy's house. Izzie aspires to be a singer/songwriter, and sings with the band King Noz. Izzie's parents are divorced and remarried; she lives with her \\"straighter-than-straight\\" mum and step-dad Angus, who has two adult daughters. Her dad is married to Anna and they have a son, Izzie's younger half-brother Tom, who she adores. Izzie firstly goes out with Mark for a little time, but he doesn't return her calls, She then meets Ben (from King Noz) and they start dating. Later they break up and Izzie goes through a bad phase of drinking, smoking and going out with Josh Harper - a stereotypical \\"wild\\" boy, although later she realizes her mistakes, and they split up. She also becomes briefly interested in Gabriel from Teen Talk before he tells her he is gay. Her birthday is January 6, making her a Capricorn. * Nesta Williams — A very beautiful girl, with silky brown hair and dark skin and green eyes. Nesta lives with her parents and her older half-brother, Tony Costello, near Highgate in London. Her father is Italian and a director, and her mother is Jamaican and works as a T.V news presenter, a mix which resulted in her good looks. She first aspires to be a model, and then later to be an actress. Sometimes Nesta is thought to be shallow by her friends, which bothers her a lot. Her friends sometimes tell her she has a big mouth. In difficult situations, she likes to pretend she is a movie heroine. Nesta has to have a brace fitted, and she considers becoming a recluse, until she decides against it. She is considered very beautiful by her friends, and has great success with boys. Although she has dated and snogged a lot of boys, she has dated only a few seriously: Simon, Luke De Biasi and later Luke's best friend William. Her birthday is August 18, making her a Leo. * Theresa Joanne \\"TJ\\" Watts — TJ joins the group when her best friend Hannah moves to South Africa. She slowly becomes friends with Lucy, and soon becomes one of the mates. Her parents are older than most of the parents of girls her age, since she was a \\"surprise baby\\" or \\"a mistake\\". Because of this, TJ nicknamed them The Wrinklies. TJ's dad is very stern, and everyone calls him Scary Dad. He doesn't like TJ bringing in friends and complains about the noise. She is incredibly smart, but also shy, particularly around boys. TJ says that, around boys, she turns into Noola, the alien girl, and is only able to speak in gibberish. TJ is into reading, and devours books, and also into writing: she becomes the co-editor of the school newspaper and aspires to be a journalist/novelist. She first dates Lucy's brother Steve, and has dates with Ollie Axford and then Nesta's ex-boyfriend, Luke de Biasi. Her birthday is November 24, making her a Sagittarius. Minor characters * Tony Costello - Nesta's older half-brother, Italian like his father. His mother died when he was only 6 months but Nesta's mother has always been a mother to him. He is said to be a player, dating a different girl every week. As soon as Lucy sees him she falls for him, and her first snog is with him. They date on and off. Tony develops strong feelings for her and wants to take it to the next level while Lucy wants to cool down. In the end, they do not get back together, but still harbor feelings for one another. It is hinted that they will get back together at a later age due to what Tony says. (Source: Mates, Dates: The Secret Diary) * Steve Lovering - Lucy's 17-year-old brother and the eldest Lovering sibling, Steve is interested in graphics and books. In Sleepover Secrets he is introduced to TJ but initially pays no notice of her. Lucy and her friends make a plan to help TJ's neighbour fall for TJ with Steve's help, but soon he develops feelings for her. He doesn't reveal his feelings until the end of the book when TJ realizes so herself, and they start dating. In Tempting Trouble TJ develops feelings for Nesta's boyfriend Luke de Biasi, which puts her and Steve's relationship in jeopardy. She dumps him in an email when Luke tells her he too will dump his girlfriend so they can be together. * Laurence \\"Lal\\" Lovering - Lucy's 15-year-old brother, and the middle sibling of the three. Only few years' difference between him and Steve go a long way.

He has a sister named Tanya, whose best friend is Cressida Dudley-Smith. Simon and Nesta really fall for each other, but eventually break up when he has to go to university. * Tanya Peddington Lee - Simon's younger sister, also the friend of Cressida. The first time, Nesta thinks she is just like Cressida, despite instantly being nice to her, but she soon finds out that Tanya is much friendlier than Cressida. Tanya later dumps Cressida as a friend. She also accidentally gets Nesta into trouble by giving her champagne. * Cressida Dudley-Smith - Simon's ex-girlfriend and also a friend of Tanya. She is arrogant and snobbish, and is given the nickname \\"WC\\" (short for Watercress) by Nesta. She goes after Tony, Nesta's brother, just to spite her. She is said to be tall, blonde, and very pretty. *Mr and Mrs Lovering - They are really strict about healthy food, whilst their kids dream about chips and normal teenage food. Mr Lovering owns a health food store and Mrs Lovering is a counsellor. *Dr Richard Watts and Dr Maureen Watts - TJ's parents who are both doctors. They are older than the other girls' parents and when Nesta first sees them she thinks they are TJ's grandparents. They considered moving to Devon for a while, to TJ's horror, but later decided that they'd miss London too much. In book 12, the subject is brought up again when TJ's father has a stroke and they spend some time on the Rame Peninsula in Cornwall, but end up buying a summer home there, instead of moving away. *Paul Watts - TJ's older brother. He goes travelling for a while during book 4 and he is then said to be a painter/decorator living in Bristol.

Career Club Forrest was born in Glasgow, raised in the Townhead district of the city and signed for Rangers (the club he supported) as a schoolboy; he was sent for a short period to Drumchapel Amateurs for development. In coming into the first-team, he displaced Jimmy Millar as the successful early 1960s Rangers side was breaking up. He was known as a prolific goalscorer – in total scoring 145 goals in his 163 games for Rangers, his 50th goal for the club coming in his 45th appearance. He scored 57 goals in the 1964–65 season, just two short of Jimmy McGrory of Celtic who holds the record of most goals scored in a season in British football. Forrest holds the record for number of goals scored for Rangers in a League Cup match, scoring five in an 8–0 victory over Stirling Albion in August 1966. Other highlights included two goals in his first Old Firm appearance in 1963 (when he was aged just 18), four in the 1963 Scottish League Cup Final win over Morton, both goals in the 1964 Scottish League Cup Final victory over Celtic, and another five-goal haul against Hamilton in a 1965 league game. His Rangers career came to an end shortly after the infamous Scottish Cup defeat to Berwick Rangers in January 1967. He and George McLean were deemed entirely to blame, and both were dropped by manager Scot Symon and transferred within weeks. After spending a year at Preston, he had a five-year stint at Aberdeen, where he received a Scottish Cup winner's medal in 1970, before transferring to Hong Kong Rangers in 1973. International Forrest played five times for Scotland between 1965 and 1971, but did not score. He had also featured for the Under-23 side. Family Forrest's cousin, Alex Willoughby, was also a professional footballer. The two were team-mates at Drumchapel, Rangers, Aberdeen and Hong Kong Rangers.

The coverage has most recently been presented by Indeed, along with AutoZone for the postseason; previous presenting sponsors included Wendy's, Barbasol, Nesquik, DraftKings, Xerox, AutoZone, Excedrin, United States Postal Service and Mercedes-Benz. History In 1997, ESPN Radio outbid CBS Radio to become the exclusive national radio broadcaster of Major League Baseball beginning the following year. CBS Radio had been the national radio broadcaster since 1976. The agreement lasted seven years through 2004 and gave ESPN Radio the rights to broadcast numerous games including Sunday Night Baseball, Saturday Game of the Week, Opening Day and holiday games, September weekday pennant race games, the All-Star Game and Home Run Derby, and all of the playoffs, including the World Series. In 2004, ESPN Radio extended the deal with a five- year, $55 million dollar contract extension through the 2010 season. The agreement also added a weekly program devoted to baseball, which became The Baseball Show from 3 p.m. ET to 7 pm. ET on Sundays during the regular season. The program was hosted by John Seibel and Steve Phillips. Coverage overview As previously mentioned, in beginning in the 1998 season, ESPN Radio took over from CBS Radio as the official, national radio broadcaster for Major League Baseball. The network's contract with MLB currently runs through 2021, and as of 2006, Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio is heard on over 321 stations across the United States. The games include Opening Day, Sunday Night Baseball, Saturday Game of the Week (usually the same matchup as the Sunday Night game), holiday games and September pennant race games. ESPN Radio holds exclusive radio rights to the All-Star Game and Home Run Derby. The postseason (including the Wild Card Games, Division Series, League Championship Series and World Series) is a semi-exclusive arrangement. The participating teams' flagship stations are allowed to air play-by-play using their own announcers and production. The national ESPN Radio feed may, however, be carried live on another station in those markets as well (for instance, WHB in Kansas City aired the ESPN feed of Kansas City Royals postseason games in 2014 and 2015, competing directly with the Royals Radio Network broadcast on KCSP). If affiliate stations on the teams' radio networks wish to carry coverage of postseason games they must use the national feed. Since the inaugural World Baseball Classic in March 2006, the semi-finals and the championship have also been broadcast as part of Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio. In addition to affiliate stations on AM/FM radio, ESPN Radio's game broadcasts are carried as part of Sirius XM Radio's MLB coverage (with Sunday night games also being simulcast on MLB Network Radio). However, they are not included in the subscription \\"Gameday Audio\\" package on MLB.com with the exception of the All- Star Game, for which no other radio play-by-play feed is available. Since June 2011, the games can also be heard online at ESPN Radio.com and on mobile devices via the ESPN app and other applications such as TuneIn. They can also be heard on televisions using connected devices (such as video game consoles) via their respective iHeartRadio and Tunein apps. Previously, rights restrictions prevented ESPN Radio.com from live-streaming the games. Broadcasters As of 2011, the primary ESPN Radio crew for Sunday Night Baseball consists of play-by-play announcer Jon Sciambi and color analyst Chris Singleton. In 2010, Sciambi succeeded Gary Thorne, who had called play- by-play in 2008–09; Thorne had succeeded Dan Shulman, did so from 2002 to 2007; Shulman, in turn, had been preceded by Charley Steiner from 1998 to 2002. Singleton succeeded Dave Campbell, who was an analyst from 1999 to 2010. Campbell replaced Kevin Kennedy as analyst in 1999, after the latter had worked with Steiner in the network's inaugural season of coverage. Marc Kestecher currently serves as the network's primary Baseball Tonight studio host; he was preceded by Joe D'Ambrosio from 1998 to 2007. As of 2018, Dan Shulman calls the World Series and one of the two League Championship Series with Singleton each year, while Sciambi calls the other LCS with Sunday Night Baseball TV analyst Jessica Mendoza. Various other announcers work the network's secondary regular-season, Wild Card Game and Division Series broadcasts as needed. Sciambi and Singleton also call the All-Star Game and Home Run Derby each year.

She served on Lemnos Island during the Gallipoli Campaign. The ANZAC \\"A\\" badge is a brass insignia authorised in November 1917 for members of the First Australian Imperial Force who had served as a member of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZACs) during the Gallipoli campaign in 1915. In 1918, eligibility was extended to those who had served at Lemnos, Imbros and Tenedos and the transports and hospitals off Gallipoli as well as the communications line to Egypt. History The origins of the award are uncertain with John Monash, William Birdwood and John Gellibrand all being credited with the idea in various accounts. The most likely version is that the award was a result of several ideas proposed in early 1916 to commemorate the Anzacs. When Monash led his brigade in commemorating the first Anzac Day, men who had served at Gallipoli wore a blue ribbon on their right breast and those who had gone ashore as part of the first landing wore a red ribbon as well. Birdwood advised in August 1916 that he supported Australian veterans of the ANZAC campaign wearing an \\"A\\" badge on their colour patches. The 1st and 2nd Divisions supported the idea enthuastically. The 3rd and 4th, both of which had fewer ANZAC veterans in their ranks, were less enthusiastic in their adoption of the badge. However, Monash, as commander of the 3rd Division, was able to claim by November 1916 that \\"'All who have a right to be called \\"Anzacs\\" among us are now wearing a metal \\"A\\" on the colour patches on the sleeves\\".F.M. Cutlack (ed.), War letters of General Monash, Sydney, 1934, p. 148 cited on In early 1917, convalescent soldiers returned to Australia wearing the badge and its status was initially questioned. This led to its formal approval through AIF Order 937 issued in November 1917. Subsequent orders clarified the entitlement to the badge and made it compulsory. In January 1918, the order extended eligibility to people who had served behind the lines on the Greek islands of Lemnos, Imbros and Tenedos, on the communication lines and hospital ships offshore or on the islands or in the communications to Egypt. This included nurses who served in the hospital ships meaning that women as well as men received acknowledgement as ANZACS. There was initial resentment of the badges by soldiers who had fought in France at the Battle of Pozières and the Battle of Mouquet Farm in 1916 who thought that their contribution had been equal to the Anzacs. ANZAC rosettes were also worn by men who had joined in 1914 and came home on ANZAC leave to show that they had not been shirking their duty.

Formerly considered a Sri Lankan Tamil caste, were classified as a separate ethnic group in the 2001 census. They were a class of Tamil speaking Hindu Vaishyas, who migrated from the South India under Portuguese rule.  Etymology  The word Chetty is a generic term denoting all merchant and trading groups of South India. The word is thought to have been derived from the Tamil word Etti, an honorific title bestowed on the leading merchants by Tamil monarchs. History 293x293pxMost of them trace their origin from Madurai, Tirunelveli and the Coromandel Coast of Southern India. They settled mostly in westernSri Lanka, especially in the ports of Colombo and Galle from the 16th century to mid 17th century, during the rule of the Portuguese and Dutch. Some of the Chetties in Northern Sri Lanka were absorbed in other communities, mainly in the Sri Lankan Vellalar community, considered a subcaste known as Chetty Vellalar. The Chetties of Western Sri Lanka converted to Roman Catholicism under Portuguese rule. Other converted to Anglicanism or Protestantism under Dutch rule and British rule. Intermarriage and alliances between Sinhalese and Chetties were not uncommon thus many also got Sinhalised. Representatives of the Colombo Chetty Association stressed out their distinctiveness, appealing for forming a separate ethnic group. The Chetties were notably also from 1814 to 1817 listed as a separate ethnic group. The Chetties used dress distinctive from rest of the population in the colonial era. As an elite and prosperous group they no longer strictly marry amongst themselves. In addition, migration to Australia, England, United States of America and Canada has tended to dilute their numbers. See also *Tyron D. S. Silvapulle PWV, RWP.

Earlier considered a caste of the Sri Lankan Tamils, they got classified as separate ethnic group in the 2001 census. They are descendant of Tamil speaking Paravar of Southern India who migrated to Sri Lanka under Portuguese rule. They live mainly on the western coast of Sri Lanka and mainly found in the cities of Mannar, Negombo and Colombo.  Etymology  Scholars derive Bharatha, also pronounced as Parathar, from the Tamil root word para meaning \\"expanse\\" or \\"sea\\". The word has been documented in ancient Sangam literature, describing them as maritime people of the Neithal Sangam landscape. Colonial archives refer them as Paruwa, a corrupted form of \\"Paravar\\". According to other scholars is Bharatha a name the community took from the Hindu epic Mahabharata, the clan of Bhāratas, who were the ancestor of the heroes in the epic, following their origin myth from Ayodhya. History Paravars diving for 316x316px They were traditionally occupied in seatrade, pearl diving and fishing. They included the chiefs of the coastal regions, who ruled there as subordinates of the Pandyan kings. The Muslims of Kayalpatnam obtained a lease on pearl fishery by Marthanda Varma. The Bharatas aligned with the Portuguese and overthrew the overlordship by the Muslims and for return were over 20,000 Bharathas converted to Roman Catholicism by the saint Francis Xavier. Several hundreds of Christian converted Bharathas were brought from Indian mainland to the western shores of Sri Lanka by the Portuguese to wrest control on the pearl trade. Cankili I, king of Jaffna Kingdom, ordered the death of 600 Christian Bharathas who were settled in the Mannar District. Paravar are to be found all over Sri Lanka. Amongst Sri Lankan Tamils Paravar are still a fishing and trading caste although commonly confused with the Karaiyar. The Bharatas or Bharatakula identity is maintained by a relatively prosperous merchant group from India that settled amongst the Sinhalese in the Negombo area.imitri Mascarenhas and the Negombo connection The Nation - August 19, 2007 Assimilation Along with Colombo Chetty and other relatively recent merchant groups from South India, there is rapid Sinhalisation or assimilation with the Sinhalese majority. But unlike the Colombo Chettys many still speak Tamil at home and even have marital relationships in India. According to recent Sri Lankan census categories in July 2001, Bharatakula has been moved out of Sri Lankan Tamil category to simply as a separate ethnic group Bharatha. Areas of inhabitation They are primarily found in capital Colombo and in towns north of it, namely Negombo in the Western Province. Names Common last names adopted by Bharatkulas include Perez, Corera's,Coonghe, Cruz, de Cruz, Fernando, Ferdinandes, Paiva, Miranda, Motha, Corera, Costa, Rayan, Rayen, Rodrigo, Leon, Vaz, Gomez, Victoria, Kagoo, Carvalho, Almeida and Rubeiro. Fernando is one of the most common last names. The related Paldanos are descended from the Portuguese military officers (Paladinos) who married into the community.

Maynard rifle, tape-primer Invention Muskets in the early 19th century were flintlocks, which had a high rate of misfire and performed poorly in damp and humid weather. In 1807 the first percussion ignition system was patented by Alexander Forsyth based on research on fulminates conducted by Edward Charles Howard, but practical percussion lock systems did not become available until the 1820s, after Alexander John Forsyth's patent had expired. Percussion cap systems relied on small copper caps that were filled with mercury fulminate. While they greatly improved the reliability of muskets and their performance in damp weather, the slow rate of fire of muskets was still an issue. Dr. Edward Maynard, a dentist with an interest in firearms, embedded tiny pellets of priming material in thin strips of paper, then glued a second strip of paper on top of the first, creating a \\"tape\\" of primer. The tape could be manufactured quickly and cheaply, since paper was much less expensive than copper. Maynard also developed an automatic feeding system that would advance the tape when the musket's hammer was cocked. The hammer not only detonated the primer, but would also automatically cut the paper, thus removing the spent portion of the primer tape. Initial reception \\"Diagram of a Model 1855 Musket's lock mechanism. The small plate with the eagle on it is the cover for the Maynard tape system.\\" Maynard's new system still required the musket's powder and Minié ball to be loaded conventionally into the barrel, but the tape system meant that the percussion cap no longer needed to be manually loaded onto the percussion lock's nipple. This saved the soldier a step during the reloading process, which increased the soldier's overall rate of fire. The Ordnance Board was initially hesitant about the design, but the secretary of war, future Confederate President Jefferson Davis, was so enthusiastic about the design that it was installed on the Springfield Model 1855 rifle-musket. Performance in the field The Maynard tape worked well under controlled conditions, but proved to be unreliable in the field. The mechanism proved to be delicate and fouled easily with mud and debris. The tape had been advertised as waterproof, but moisture tended to be its worst problem. The paper strips were susceptible to adverse weather and even humidity. For later muskets like the Springfield Model 1861, the Ordnance Department abandoned the Maynard system and went back to the earlier percussion lock. The M1855 was designed to use either the Maynard system or standard percussion caps, and so remained functional even with the problems of the Maynard system. Variations of the Maynard tape system are still used today in modern toy guns. References * Pauly, Roger (2004). Firearms: The Life Story of a Technology.

The elements of the Chow group are formed out of subvarieties (so-called algebraic cycles) in a similar way to how simplicial or cellular homology groups are formed out of subcomplexes. When the variety is smooth, the Chow groups can be interpreted as cohomology groups (compare Poincaré duality) and have a multiplication called the intersection product. The Chow groups carry rich information about an algebraic variety, and they are correspondingly hard to compute in general. Rational equivalence and Chow groups For what follows, define a variety over a field k to be an integral scheme of finite type over k. For any scheme X of finite type over k, an algebraic cycle on X means a finite linear combination of subvarieties of X with integer coefficients. (Here and below, subvarieties are understood to be closed in X, unless stated otherwise.) For a natural number i, the group Z_i(X) of i-dimensional cycles (or i-cycles, for short) on X is the free abelian group on the set of i-dimensional subvarieties of X. For a variety W of dimension i+1 and any rational function f on W which is not identically zero, the divisor of f is the i-cycle :(f) = \\\\sum_Z \\\\operatorname{ord}_Z (f) Z, where the sum runs over all i-dimensional subvarieties Z of W and the integer \\\\operatorname{ord}_Z(f) denotes the order of vanishing of f along Z. (Thus \\\\operatorname{ord}_Z(f) is negative if f has a pole along Z.) The definition of the order of vanishing requires some care for W singular.Fulton. Intersection Theory, section 1.2 and Appendix A.3. For a scheme X of finite type over k, the group of i-cycles rationally equivalent to zero is the subgroup of Z_i(X) generated by the cycles (f) for all (i+1)-dimensional subvarieties W of X and all nonzero rational functions f on W. The Chow group CH_i(X) of i-dimensional cycles on X is the quotient group of Z_i(X) by the subgroup of cycles rationally equivalent to zero. Sometimes one writes [Z] for the class of a subvariety Z in the Chow group, and if two subvarieties Z and W have [Z] = [W], then Z and W are said to be rationally equivalent. For example, when X is a variety of dimension n, the Chow group CH_{n-1}(X) is the divisor class group of X. When X is smooth over k, this is isomorphic to the Picard group of line bundles on X. Examples of Rational Equivalence =Rational Equivalence on Projective Space= Rationally equivalent cycles defined by hypersurfaces are easy to construct on projective space because they can all be constructed as the vanishing loci of the same vector bundle. For example, given two homogeneous polynomials of degree d, so f,g \\\\in H^0(\\\\mathbb{P}^n, \\\\mathcal O(d)), we can construct a family of hypersurfaces defined as the vanishing locus of sf + tg. Schematically, this can be constructed as : X = \\\\text{Proj}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{C}[s,t][x_0,\\\\ldots,x_n]}{(sf + tg)}\\\\right) \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\mathbb{P}^1 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{P}^n using the projection \\\\pi_1: X \\\\to \\\\mathbb{P}^1 we can see the fiber over a point [s_0:t_0] is the projective hypersurface defined by s_0 f + t_0 g. This can be used to show that the cycle class of every hypersurface of degree d is rationally equivalent to d[\\\\mathbb{P}^{n-1}], since sf + tx_0^d can be used to establish a rational equivalence. Notice that the locus of x_0^d=0 is \\\\mathbb{P}^{n-1} and it has multiplicity d, which is the coefficient of its cycle class. =Rational Equivalence of Cycles on a Curve= If we take line bundles L, L' \\\\in\\\\operatorname{Pic}(C) of a smooth projective curve C, then the vanishing loci of a generic section of both line bundles defines non-equivalent cycle classes in CH(C). This is because \\\\operatorname{Div}(C) \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Pic}(C) for smooth varieties, so the divisor classes of s \\\\in H^0(C, L) and s' \\\\in H^0(C, L') define inequivalent classes. The Chow ring When the scheme X is smooth over a field k, the Chow groups form a ring, not just a graded abelian group. Namely, when X is smooth over k, define CH^i(X) to be the Chow group of codimension-i cycles on X. (When X is a variety of dimension n, this just means that CH^i(X) = CH_{n-i}(X).) Then the groups CH^*(X) form a commutative graded ring with the product: :CH^i(X) \\\\times CH^j(X) \\\\rightarrow CH^{i+j}(X). The product arises from intersecting algebraic cycles. For example, if Y and Z are smooth subvarieties of X of codimension i and j respectively, and if Y and Z intersect transversely, then the product [Y][Z] in CH^{i+j}(X) is the sum of the irreducible components of the intersection Y\\\\cap Z, which all have codimension i+j. More generally, in various cases, intersection theory constructs an explicit cycle that represents the product [Y][Z] in the Chow ring. For example, if Y and Z are subvarieties of complementary dimension (meaning that their dimensions sum to the dimension of X) whose intersection has dimension zero, then [Y][Z] is equal to the sum of the points of the intersection with coefficients called intersection numbers. For any subvarieties Y and Z of a smooth scheme X over k, with no assumption on the dimension of the intersection, William Fulton and Robert MacPherson's intersection theory constructs a canonical element of the Chow groups of Y\\\\cap Z whose image in the Chow groups of X is the product [Y][Z].Fulton, Intersection Theory, section 8.1. Examples Projective space The Chow ring of projective space \\\\mathbb P^n over any field k is the ring : CH^*(\\\\mathbb P^n) \\\\cong \\\\mathbf Z[H]/(H^{n + 1}), where H is the class of a hyperplane (the zero locus of a single linear function). Furthermore, any subvariety Y of degree d and codimension a in projective space is rationally equivalent to dH^a. It follows that for any two subvarieties Y and Z of complementary dimension in \\\\mathbb P^n and degrees a, b, respectively, their product in the Chow ring is simply : [Y] \\\\cdot [Z] = a\\\\, b\\\\, H^n where H^n is the class of a k-rational point in \\\\mathbb P^n. For example, if Y and Z intersect transversely, it follows that Y\\\\cap Z is a zero-cycle of degree ab. If the base field k is algebraically closed, this means that there are exactly ab points of intersection; this is a version of Bézout's theorem, a classic result of enumerative geometry.  Projective bundle formula  Given a vector bundle E \\\\to X of rank r over a smooth proper scheme X over a field, the Chow ring of the associated projective bundle \\\\mathbb{P}(E) can be computed using the Chow ring of X and the Chern classes of E. If we let \\\\zeta = c_1(\\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb{P}(E)}(1)) and c_1,\\\\ldots, c_r the Chern classes of E, then there is an isomorphism of rings : CH^\\\\bullet(\\\\mathbb{P}(E)) \\\\cong \\\\frac{CH^\\\\bullet(X)[\\\\zeta]}{\\\\zeta^r + c_1\\\\zeta^{r-1} + c_2\\\\zeta^{r-2} + \\\\cdots + c_r} = Hirzebruch surfaces = For example, the Chow ring of a Hirzebruch surface can be readily computed using the projective bundle formula. Recall that it is constructed as F_a = \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\mathcal{O}\\\\oplus\\\\mathcal{O}(a)) over \\\\mathbb{P}^1. Then, the only non-trivial Chern class of this vector bundle is c_1 = aH. This implies that the Chow ring is isomorphic to : CH^\\\\bullet(F_a) \\\\cong \\\\frac{CH^\\\\bullet(\\\\mathbb{P}^1)[\\\\zeta]}{(\\\\zeta^2 + aH\\\\zeta)} \\\\cong \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf Z[H,\\\\zeta]}{(H^2, \\\\zeta^2+aH\\\\zeta)}  Remarks  For other algebraic varieties, Chow groups can have richer behavior. For example, let X be an elliptic curve over a field k. Then the Chow group of zero-cycles on X fits into an exact sequence : 0 \\\\rightarrow X(k) \\\\rightarrow CH_0(X) \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\rightarrow 0. Thus the Chow group of an elliptic curve X is closely related to the group X(k) of k-rational points of X. When k is a number field, X(k) is called the Mordell–Weil group of X, and some of the deepest problems in number theory are attempts to understand this group. When k is the complex numbers, the example of an elliptic curve shows that Chow groups can be uncountable abelian groups. Functoriality For a proper morphism f: X\\\\to Y of schemes over k, there is a pushforward homomorphism f_*: CH_i(X)\\\\to CH_i(Y) for each integer i. For example, for a proper scheme X over k, this gives a homomorphism CH_0(X)\\\\to \\\\mathbf Z, which takes a closed point in X to its degree over k. (A closed point in X has the form \\\\operatorname{Spec}(E) for a finite extension field E of k, and its degree means the degree of the field E over k.) For a flat morphism f: X\\\\to Y of schemes over k with fibers of dimension r (possibly empty), there is a homomorphism f^*: CH_i(Y)\\\\to CH_{i+r}(X). A key computational tool for Chow groups is the localization sequence, as follows. For a scheme X over a field k and a closed subscheme Z of X, there is an exact sequence :CH_i(Z) \\\\rightarrow CH_i(X) \\\\rightarrow CH_i(X-Z) \\\\rightarrow 0, where the first homomorphism is the pushforward associated to the proper morphism Z\\\\to X, and the second homomorphism is pullback with respect to the flat morphism X - Z \\\\to X.Fulton, Intersection Theory, Proposition 1.8. The localization sequence can be extended to the left using a generalization of Chow groups, (Borel–Moore) motivic homology groups, also known as higher Chow groups.Bloch, Algebraic cycles and higher K-groups; Voevodsky, Triangulated categories of motives over a field, section 2.2 and Proposition 4.2.9. For any morphism f: X\\\\to Y of smooth schemes over k, there is a pullback homomorphism f^*: CH^i(Y)\\\\to CH^i(X), which is in fact a ring homomorphism CH^*(Y)\\\\to CH^*(X). Examples of flat pullbacks Note that non-examples can be constructed using blowups; for example, if we take the blowup of the origin in \\\\mathbb{A}^2 then the fiber over the origin is isomorphic to \\\\mathbb{P}^1. = Branched coverings of curves = Consider the branched covering of curves :f: \\\\operatorname{Spec}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{C}[x,y]}{(f(x) - g(x,y))} \\\\right) \\\\to \\\\mathbb{A}^1_x Since the morphism ramifies whenever f(\\\\alpha) = 0 we get a factorization :g(\\\\alpha,y) = (y - a_1)^{e_1}\\\\cdots(y-a_k)^{e_k} where one of the e_i>1. This implies that the points \\\\\\\\{\\\\alpha_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_k \\\\\\\\} = f^{-1}(\\\\alpha) have multiplicities e_1,\\\\ldots,e_k respectively. The flat pullback of the point \\\\alpha is then :f^*[\\\\alpha] = e_1[\\\\alpha] + \\\\cdots + e_k[\\\\alpha_k] = Flat family of varieties = Consider a flat family of varieties :X \\\\to S and a subvariety S' \\\\subset S. Then, using the cartesian square : \\\\begin{matrix} S'\\\\times_{S} X & \\\\to & X \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\downarrow & & \\\\downarrow \\\\\\\\\\\\ S' & \\\\to & S \\\\end{matrix} we see that the image of S'\\\\times_{S} X is a subvariety of X. Therefore we have :f^*[S'] = [S'\\\\times_S X] Cycle maps There are several homomorphisms (known as cycle maps) from Chow groups to more computable theories. First, for a scheme X over the complex numbers, there is a homomorphism from Chow groups to Borel–Moore homology:Fulton, Intersection Theory, section 19.1 :\\\\mathit{CH}_i(X) \\\\rightarrow H_{2i}^{BM}(X,\\\\mathbf{Z}). The factor of 2 appears because an i-dimensional subvariety of X has real dimension 2i. When X is smooth over the complex numbers, this cycle map can be rewritten using Poincaré duality as a homomorphism :\\\\mathit{CH}^j(X) \\\\rightarrow H^{2j}(X,\\\\mathbf{Z}). In this case (X smooth over C), these homomorphisms form a ring homomorphism from the Chow ring to the cohomology ring. Intuitively, this is because the products in both the Chow ring and the cohomology ring describe the intersection of cycles. For a smooth complex projective variety, the cycle map from the Chow ring to ordinary cohomology factors through a richer theory, Deligne cohomology.Voisin, Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry, v. 1, section 12.3.3; v. 2, Theorem 9.24. This incorporates the Abel–Jacobi map from cycles homologically equivalent to zero to the intermediate Jacobian. The exponential sequence shows that CH1(X) maps isomorphically to Deligne cohomology, but that fails for CHj(X) with j > 1. For a scheme X over an arbitrary field k, there is an analogous cycle map from Chow groups to (Borel–Moore) etale homology. When X is smooth over k, this homomorphism can be identified with a ring homomorphism from the Chow ring to etale cohomology.Deligne, Cohomologie Etale (SGA 4 1/2), Expose 4. Relation to K-theory An (algebraic) vector bundle E on a smooth scheme X over a field has Chern classes ci(E) in CHi(X), with the same formal properties as in topology.Fulton, Intersection Theory, section 3.2 and Example 8.3.3. The Chern classes give a close connection between vector bundles and Chow groups. Namely, let K0(X) be the Grothendieck group of vector bundles on X. As part of the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem, Grothendieck showed that the Chern character gives an isomorphism :K_0(X)\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbf{Z}}\\\\mathbf{Q} \\\\cong \\\\prod_i \\\\mathit{CH}^i(X)\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbf{Z}}\\\\mathbf{Q}. This isomorphism shows the importance of rational equivalence, compared to any other adequate equivalence relation on algebraic cycles. Conjectures Some of the deepest conjectures in algebraic geometry and number theory are attempts to understand Chow groups. For example: *The Mordell–Weil theorem implies that the divisor class group CHn-1(X) is finitely generated for any variety X of dimension n over a number field. It is an open problem whether all Chow groups are finitely generated for every variety over a number field. The Bloch–Kato conjecture on values of L-functions predicts that these groups are finitely generated. Moreover, the rank of the group of cycles modulo homological equivalence, and also of the group of cycles homologically equivalent to zero, should be equal to the order of vanishing of an L-function of the given variety at certain integer points. Finiteness of these ranks would also follow from the Bass conjecture in algebraic K-theory. *For a smooth complex projective variety X, the Hodge conjecture predicts the image (tensored with the rationals Q) of the cycle map from the Chow groups to singular cohomology. For a smooth projective variety over a finitely generated field (such as a finite field or number field), the Tate conjecture predicts the image (tensored with Ql) of the cycle map from Chow groups to l-adic cohomology. *For a smooth projective variety X over any field, the Bloch–Beilinson conjecture predicts a filtration on the Chow groups of X (tensored with the rationals) with strong properties.Voisin, Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry, v. 2, Conjecture 11.21. The conjecture would imply a tight connection between the singular or etale cohomology of X and the Chow groups of X. :For example, let X be a smooth complex projective surface. The Chow group of zero-cycles on X maps onto the integers by the degree homomorphism; let K be the kernel. If the geometric genus h0(X, Ω2) is not zero, Mumford showed that K is \\"infinite-dimensional\\" (not the image of any finite- dimensional family of zero-cycles on X).Voisin, Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry, v. 2, Theorem 10.1. The Bloch–Beilinson conjecture would imply a satisfying converse, Bloch's conjecture on zero-cycles: for a smooth complex projective surface X with geometric genus zero, K should be finite- dimensional; more precisely, it should map isomorphically to the group of complex points of the Albanese variety of X.Voisin, Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry, v. 2, Ch. 11. Variants  Bivariant theory  Fulton and MacPherson extended the Chow ring to singular varieties by defining the \\"operational Chow ring\\" and more generally a bivariant theory associated to any morphism of schemes.Fulton, Intersection Theory, Chapter 17. A bivariant theory is a pair of covariant and contravariant functors that assign to a map a group and a ring respectively. It generalizes a cohomology theory, which is a contravariant functor that assigns to a space a ring, namely a cohomology ring. The name \\"bivariant\\" refers to the fact that the theory contains both covariant and contravariant functors. This is in a sense the most elementary extension of the Chow ring to singular varieties; other theories such as motivic cohomology map to the operational Chow ring.B. Totaro, Chow groups, Chow cohomology and linear varieties  Other variants  Arithmetic Chow groups are an amalgamation of Chow groups of varieties over Q together with a component encoding Arakelov-theoretical information, that is, differential forms on the associated complex manifold. The theory of Chow groups of schemes of finite type over a field extends easily to that of algebraic spaces. The key advantage of this extension is that it is easier to form quotients in the latter category and thus it is more natural to consider equivariant Chow groups of algebraic spaces. A much more formidable extension is that of Chow group of a stack, which has been constructed only in some special case and which is needed in particular to make sense of a virtual fundamental class. History Rational equivalence of divisors (known as linear equivalence) was studied in various forms during the 19th century, leading to the ideal class group in number theory and the Jacobian variety in the theory of algebraic curves. For higher-codimension cycles, rational equivalence was introduced by Francesco Severi in the 1930s. In 1956, Wei-Liang Chow gave an influential proof that the intersection product is well-defined on cycles modulo rational equivalence for a smooth quasi-projective variety, using Chow's moving lemma. Starting in the 1970s, Fulton and MacPherson gave the current standard foundation for Chow groups, working with singular varieties wherever possible. In their theory, the intersection product for smooth varieties is constructed by deformation to the normal cone.Fulton, Intersection Theory, Chapters 5, 6, 8.

Species description As the name suggests, this rockfish is notable for a general orange-yellow appearance, consisting of a blotchy orange pattern over a whitish or light gray background. The head has three stripes angling downwards and back, the middle one generally running across the eye, and the other two on each side of the eye. The lateral line is in a clear area. The fins are orange, with the pectoral, pelvic, and anal fins somewhat pointed and larger (thus the species epithet pinniger, meaning \\"I bear a large fin\\"). Some individuals have dark blotches on the body or dorsal fin. Maximum recorded length if 76 cm (29.6 in). Genetics A potential PCR-RFLP genetic sex marker developed for gopher rockfish does not successfully distinguish male and female canary rockfish. Ecology and conservation status Young canaries live in relatively shallow water, moving to deeper water as they mature. Adults are mostly found at depths of 80–200 meters (with two recorded at 838 meters), tending to collect in groups around pinnacles and similar high-relief rock formations, especially where the current is strong. Some off Oregon have been reported living over flat rock and mud-boulder bottoms. They may move considerable distances; one individual covered 700 km in four years after being tagged and released. Juveniles feed on small crustacea such as krill larvae (and eggs), copepods and amphipods, while adults eat krill and small fishes. They have been an important commercial species since at least the early 1880s, with fisheries off San Francisco, California and Washington state. They are caught in trawling and hook and line operations, along with a variety of other fish such as yellowtail, lingcod, and other rockfishes. The population on the U.S. West Coast were declared overfished in 2000 and a recovery plan was implemented in 2001. This stock was declared rebuilt in 2015. In 2007, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) received a petition to list a distinct population segment (DPS) of canary rockfish, and four other rockfishes, in Puget Sound, as an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act). (ESA). NMFS found that this petition presented enough information to warrant conducting a status review of the species. Based on the status review NMFS proposed listing this species as threatened in 2009. After a later review that included new genetic analyses, a final listing decision was made in January 2017: References * * Milton S. Love, Mary Yoklavich, Lyman K.

The castle is built around a 15th-century tower house, with substantial additions in later centuries. Originally a property of the Calder family, it passed to the Campbells in the 16th century. It remains in Campbell ownership, and is now home to the Dowager Countess Cawdor, stepmother of Colin Campbell, 7th Earl Cawdor. The castle is perhaps best known for its literary connection to William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth, in which the title character is made \\"Thane of Cawdor\\". However, the story is highly fictionalised, and the castle itself, which is never directly referred to in Macbeth, was built many years after the life of the 11th-century King Macbeth. The castle is a category A listed building, and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens. History The earliest documented date for the castle is 1454, the date a licence to fortify was granted to William Calder, 6th Thane of Cawdor (or Calder, as the name was originally spelled). However, some portions of the 15th-century tower house or keep may precede that date. Architectural historians have dated the style of stonework in the oldest portion of the castle to approximately 1380. One curious feature of the castle is that it was built around a small, living holly tree. Tradition states that a donkey, laden with gold, lay down to rest under this tree, which was then selected as the site of the castle. The remains of the tree may still be seen in the lowest level of the tower. Modern scientific testing has shown that the tree died in approximately 1372, lending credence to the earlier date of the castle's first construction. The iron yett (gate) here was brought from nearby Lochindorb Castle, which was dismantled by William around 1455, on the orders of King James II, after it had been forfeited by the Earl of Moray. Arms Sir Hugh Campbell and his wife Lady Henrietta Stewart, on a panel dated 1672 The castle was expanded numerous times in the succeeding centuries. In 1510 the heiress of the Calders, Muriel, married Sir John Campbell of Muckairn, who set about extending the castle. Further improvements were made by John Campbell, 3rd of Cawdor (c.1576 - c.1642), who purchased rich lands on Islay. By 1635 a garden had been added, and after the Restoration Sir Hugh Campbell of Cawdor added or improved the north and west ranges, employing the masons James and Robert Nicolson of Nairn. Billings' Baronial and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of Scotland (1901) In the 1680s Sir Alexander Campbell, son of Sir Hugh, became stranded in Milford Haven during a storm, where he met a local heiress, Elizabeth Lort of Stackpole Court. The two were married and afterwards the Campbells of Cawdor lived mainly on their estates in Pembrokeshire. Cawdor was home to younger brothers of the family who continued to manage the estates, building a walled flower garden in 1720, and establishing extensive woodlands in the later 18th century. John Campbell of Cawdor, a Member of Parliament, married a daughter of the Earl of Carlisle in 1789, and was ennobled as Lord Cawdor in 1796. In 1827, his son was created Earl Cawdor. During the 19th century, Cawdor was used as a summer residence by the Earls. The architects Thomas Mackenzie and Alexander Ross were commissioned to add the southern and eastern ranges to enclose a courtyard, accessed by a drawbridge. In the 20th century John Campbell, 5th Earl Cawdor, moved permanently to Cawdor. His second son James Campbell (potter)(1942-2019) was born here. John was succeeded by the 6th Earl, whose second wife, the Dowager Countess Angelika, born countess Lažanský from Bohemia, Czech TV reportage lives there still. In 2001 it was reported that the Countess had prevented her stepson from sowing genetically modified rapeseed on the Cawdor estate, and in 2002 the Countess took the Earl to court after he moved into the castle while she was away. Gardens Cawdor Castle Gardens The castle is known for its gardens, which include the Walled Garden (originally planted in the 17th century), the Flower Garden (18th century), and the Wild Garden (added in the 1960s). In addition, the castle grounds include a wood featuring numerous species of trees (as well as over 100 species of lichen). Shakespeare connection The name of Cawdor still connects the castle to Shakespeare's play Macbeth. However, the story portrayed by Shakespeare takes extensive liberties with history. In the play, Shakespeare has three witches foretell that Macbeth, then Thane of Glamis, would become Thane of Cawdor and King thereafter. Duncan almost immediately makes Macbeth Thane of Cawdor, after which Macbeth and his Lady plot the murder of Duncan in order to fulfil the prophecy. Duncan is killed in his sleep, at Macbeth's castle in Inverness, an act that leads to Macbeth's ultimate downfall. The historical King Macbeth ruled Scotland from 1040 to 1057, after his forces killed King Duncan I in battle near Elgin. Macbeth was never Thane of Cawdor, this being an invention of the 15th-century writer Hector Boece. Moreover, Cawdor Castle did not exist during the lifetimes of Macbeth or Duncan, and it is never explicitly mentioned in the play. The 5th Earl Cawdor is quoted as saying, \\"I wish the Bard had never written his damned play!\\" References External links * Cawdor Castle (official website of Cawdor Castle) * Category:Castles in Highland (council area) Category:Category A listed buildings in Highland (council area) Category:Listed castles in Scotland Category:Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes Category:Gardens in Highland (council area) Category:Historic house museums in Highland (council area) Category:Country houses in Highland (council area) Category:County of Nairn Category:Tower houses in Scotland ","title":"Cawdor Castle"},{"id":"4282128","text":"is a Japanese actor and voice actor from the Tokyo Metropolitan area.

It is located in Shah Alam. It is the country's largest mosque and also the second largest mosque in Southeast Asia after Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta, Indonesia. Its most distinguishing feature is its large blue and silver dome. The mosque has four minarets, one erected at each of the corners.  History  The mosque was commissioned by the late Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz, when he declared Shah Alam as the new capital of Selangor on 14 February 1974. Construction began in 1982 and finished on 11 March 1988. The mosque is also known as the Blue Mosque owing to its blue dome.  Records  The mosque has the distinction of having the largest religious dome in the world, measuring in diameter and reaching above ground level. The four minarets, each reaching above ground level, are the third tallest in the world, after those at the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca, Morocco,Kingfisher Geography encyclopedia. . Page 137 and the Djamaa el Djazaïr in Algiers, Algeria. In its early years, the mosque was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as having the tallest minaret in the world before being supplanted by the minaret at the Hassan II Mosque in August 1993. However, the mosque still maintains the distinction of having the world's tallest group of minarets.  Architecture and features  At the hallway (first floor) of the mosque. The blue mosque at night The design of the Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah Mosque is a combination of Malay and Modernist styles, and elements of Malay and Islamic architecture are incorporated into the finishes of the building. Fine decorative khat (Arabic calligraphy) can be seen on the inner curve of the dome and parts of the walls. The calligraphy work was executed by the Egyptian calligrapher Shiekh Abdel Moneim Mohamed Ali El Sharkawi. Intricate aluminium grills are found on the doorways, windows, and walls of the mosque. The windows are fitted with blue stained glass to reduce the amount of light entering the hall. The resulting filtered illumination lends a bluish ambiance to the interior spaces, evoking a sense of peace and serenity. The high ceiling has triangular panels of red balau and ramin timber wood that are set in a crisscrossing pattern. The dome is constructed of aluminium and the outer surface is clad with vitreous enamel- baked triangular steel panels decorated with a rosette of verses from the Qur'an. The main prayer hall spans two levels, is fully carpeted and air conditioned, and is one of the largest such spaces in the world. The upper gallery of the prayer hall is reserved for female worshippers, and the ground floor contains the reception area, administrative offices, conference rooms, a library, and lecture rooms. The mosque has the capacity to accommodate 12,600 worshippers and is large enough that on a clear day it can be seen from some vantage points in Kuala Lumpur. The mosque overlooks the Garden of Islamic Arts, a landscaped park inspired by the Quranic Garden of Paradise (Jannah, ). These 14 hectares of spiritual sanctuary house nine galleries exhibiting a rich array of Islamic arts such as calligraphy, sculptures, paintings, and architecture. The site is occasionally used for traditional Islamic performances.

Episcopal Academy has been consistently ranked as a top private school in the nation by various media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal. The Academy is affiliated with the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. History Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia, Circa 1790 Early years The Episcopal Academy was founded in 1785 by the Rt. Rev. William White at Old Christ Church in Philadelphia as an all-boys school, focusing on classical education in Greek, Latin, religion, mathematics, and business. It was also a pre-missionary school. Trustees included two signers of the Declaration of Independence, as well as bankers, merchants, and ministers. It was founded soon after the American Revolutionary War, and the disestablishment of the Anglican Church in the United States. The Episcopal Church of America was organized. The faculty was composed of notable figures such as Noah Webster Jr., who developed the Webster Dictionaries. Its first campus was located on the east side of Fourth Street and was directed by Rev. John Andrews, D.D., the Academy's first headmaster.EMINENT PHILADELPHIANS, NOW DECEASED. COLLECTED FROM ORIGINAL AND AUTHENTIC SOURCES, BY HENRY SIMPSON, MEMBER OF THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY OF PENNSYLVANIA. Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1859, p.15. When Dr. Andrews and several of faculty members left in 1798 to teach at the University of Pennsylvania, The Episcopal Academy was reconstituted as a free school. In 1816 it became a Second Classical Academy, and a free school again in 1828. During some years, the Academy did not operate as an educational entity. In 1846 the school was reconstituted, this time as a Third Classical Academy; it has operated continuously since. In 1850, the school moved to a building at Juniper and Locust streets. It operated there until 1921, when it moved to a new campus in suburban Merion, Pennsylvania, on the Main Line of the commuter railroad. Female students Female students attended the Academy between 1789 and 1818. It was not until 1974 that the academy implemented a gradual plan for permanent co-education at the school. In 1974, girls were admitted to kindergarten, and then to one higher grade each year thereafter. The class of 1984 was the first co-educational class to graduate from the Academy. New campuses Chapel at the Episcopal Academy Episcopal Academy was located in Merion, Pennsylvania, from 1921 until 2008, when it moved to Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. In June 1998, the Episcopal Academy Board of Trustees directed the \\"active pursuit of a large tract of land in the western suburbs to serve as a long-term asset and a means of preserving future options.\\" After receiving a $20 million donation, the Board purchased a tract of land in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania on Darby-Paoli Road (Pennsylvania Route 252). The $212.5 million project was completed in 2008 and opened for the 2008-2009 school year. The new campus has academic, arts, athletic, and spiritual facilities. It features keepsakes from the Merion and Devon campuses: the original stained glass windows from the Class of 1944 Chapel, a clock (which was installed on the Clark Campus Green), and several artifacts in the Crawford Campus Center. Brailsford & Dunlavey served as the Academy's on-site program manager throughout each phase of the campus development project. The architecture firms, including Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates, Gund Partnership, Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, and RMJM Hillier, \\"coordinated the materials used as well as the landscape layout of the campus, with its pastoral central quadrangle and collegiate-village scale\\".http://info.aia.org/aiarchitect/thisweek07/0803/0803p_episcopal.cfm The Episcopal Academy sold its Merion campus to Saint Joseph's University, which renamed it as the SJU Maguire Campus. Current programs The Episcopal Academy's mission is \\"Challenging and nurturing mind, body, and spirit, we inspire boys and girls to lead lives of purpose, faith, and integrity.\\" The school has a 100% four-year college matriculation rate, several athletics teams, and a chapel program that meets every other day during the school year. Academics The Academy is accredited by the Pennsylvania Association of Independent Schools. The Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools' \\"Accreditation for Growth\\" protocol governed accreditation until the current accreditation cycle.https://inside.episcopalacademy.org/htm/Admin/directors/AFG2.htm The upper school is a college preparatory program. It operates on an 8-day, rotating block schedule designed by a committee of faculty and administrators. The basic structure of this schedule, which is designed to allow students to take six or seven academic courses, has been in place since 1998. There are two semesters, with each semester representing one-half of a credit (a one- credit long course will meet during both semesters). For the past 5 years, the Upper School did a J-Term immediately following winter break, when the students would participate in one course for two weeks straight. In 2019, the students studied instead in a similar two-week, May-Term. Graduation requirements are as follows: 4 Credits (4 years) of English; 3 Credits of Math (including Algebra 2 and Geometry); 3 Credits of Laboratory Science; 3 Credits of History (including U.S. History); 2 Credits of the same modern or classical Language (French, Spanish, Mandarin, Ancient Greek, and Latin); 1 Credit of Religion, 1 Credit of Arts (music, theater, and visual arts). New for the 2019-2020 school year is a 1/2 credit (1 semester) of Computer Science. Athletics The Episcopal Academy is a member of the Inter-Ac league. For boys the Inter-Ac league includes the Haverford School, Malvern Preparatory School, Chestnut Hill Academy, Penn Charter, and Germantown Academy. For girls this league includes Penn Charter, Germantown Academy, Notre Dame Academy, the Baldwin School, the Agnes Irwin School, and Springside School. The sports requirement requires all students to participate in athletics during each of the three seasons. Freshman and sophomores are required to participate in at least two inter-scholastic sports with the option of participating in the \\"Fitness\\" option for one season. Juniors may elect to participate in the \\"Fitness\\" option for two seasons. \\"Fitness\\" consists of organized athletic activities three days a week and community service two days a week. There is also a theatre offering (both on the stage and in technical theatre) in the spring (a musical) and the fall. This counts as a \\"Fitness\\" option as well. Seniors are permitted to take a \\"Senior Cut\\", that is they do not have to participate in any athletics for one season so long as they never received an \\"unsatisfactory\\" effort grade in any sport during their four years in the upper school. As a co-founder of the oldest High School sport's league in America, the \\"Inter-Academic League,\\" and in the second oldest school rivalry in the nation, (against the Haverford School, later adding Agnes Irwin School) Episcopal Academy athletic teams have gained a national reputation. The boys basketball team, coached by Daniel Dougherty, gained national attention in 2005 and 2006, with full team effort including players Gerald Henderson '06 and Wayne Ellington '06. Both were nationally ranked high school basketball players. Henderson signed to play for Duke University while Ellington signed to play for the University of North Carolina. Sports offered in the fall include cross country, soccer, water polo, and crew for both boys and girls. Football is offered just for boys, and tennis and field hockey are offered just for girls. Sports offered in the winter include basketball, squash, swimming and diving, and winter track for both boys and girls. Ice hockey and wrestling are offered just for boys. Spring sports include crew, golf, lacrosse, and track for both boys and girls. Baseball and tennis are offered just for boys. Softball is offered just for girls. Intramural sports such as paddle tennis and bike polo are also offered. =Events= A Centennial athletic tradition The Episcopal Academy carries a tradition of inter- league competition, notably through Haverford-Irwin's Weekend. Formerly known as Haverford Day, this tradition of competition with the Haverford School of Haverford, Pennsylvania, was established when EA was still an all-boys school, but in 2006 the rivalry and day of events was extended to include girls' athletic competition against the Agnes Irwin School of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Every November, the three Inter-Academic rivals meet to compete against each other in cross country, football, soccer, field hockey, girls' tennis, and water polo. The venue alternates each year between the schools. The weekend is preceded by \\"Spirit Week,\\" marked by various activities intended to energize the students for the weekend of competition and spectatorship. Spirit Week concludes with an Upper School Pep Rally on Friday. On Friday, Episcopal and Agnes Irwin (female competitors) compete in cross country, soccer, field hockey, and tennis. On Saturday, Episcopal and Haverford compete in soccer, cross country, waterpolo and one of the oldest football rivalries in the nation. The girls compete for the \\"banner\\" and the boys compete for the \\"sweater\\" which is presented to the school which wins 3 of the 4 competitive events. In the event of a tie the schools split ownership of the banner or the sweater for the year. Religion and service Episcopal Academy Chapel, designed by alumnus Robert Venturi =The chapel program= Upper School students meet once every other day for a morning chapel service in the Class of 1944 Chapel. Middle School Chapel also meets once every other day for a morning chapel service in Christ Chapel. Lower School Chapel meets once a week. The Chapel service typically gives students a thirty-minute break during the school day and consists of student musical offering (violin, piano or an organ-prelude), hymns, prayers, and an address by the chaplain, a member of the faculty, a student, or a guest. An elected student vestry plans most aspects of the chapel program. The students casually exit the chapel in single-file as a postlude carries through the campus. =Community service= The Academy also runs an extensive community service program, and organizes weekly visits to a soup kitchen in Philadelphia as well as monthly visits to a nursing home and to a facility for adults with AIDS. The Academy also participates in a tutoring program where students help younger children with their homework after school. In addition, the Community Service office sponsors other special events throughout the year, including a clothing drive, a toy drive, and a blood drive.

Born in October 1863 at Vršac, then part of Austria-Hungary, now Serbia, he died in Belgrade shortly before the end of World War II, on 17 March 1944. He first began studying photography in his father's studio in Vršac, and later in Vienna, Munich, Paris and Trieste. In 1887 he opened his own photography studio in downtown Belgrade. At the outbreak of World War I he joined the Serbian Army and fought on the Eastern Front until he was wounded in one of the battles. After convalescing in Florence, he returned to Belgrade where he resumed his studio work. Technically brilliant and endlessly imaginative Milan Jovanović proved that portraitures and photographs that capture people and historical events could be as complicated and challenging as any other kind of art form. His camera work in the field, particularly during World War I, had captured his subjects in movement, like crossing a river at dusk, and in situations that mocked the artifice of studio poses.

It runs northwest to southeast, roughly bounded by Highland Avenue, Somerville Avenue, Elm Street, and Willow Avenue. Summer Street runs along the hill's crest. Spring Hill is a drumlin, one of many such hills in the Boston area composed of material deposited as glaciers of the Pleistocene epoch receded. Historically agricultural in character, Spring Hill was sparsely developed until the mid-19th century. Present-day Central, Lowell, and Cedar Streets trace their origins to the mid-17th century, but few other roads broke the open space. Most development took place in the neighborhood between the 1840s and early 1900s. Spring Hill has a fine selection of Greek Revival houses and Victorians including Second Empires, Italianates, Gothic Revivals and Queen Annes. Large houses were built in the neighborhood as well as smaller workers' houses and attached houses. In the early 1900s triple-deckers filled in the remaining land. Part of the Spring Hill neighborhood was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. The Spring Hill Historic District stretches from Summer, Central, Atherton and Spring Streets. History Topographical map showing contour of Spring Hill Spring Hill was first developed in 1843 by George O. Brastow, an influential businessman who later became the first mayor of Somerville. He lotted one of Somerville's first residential subdivisions on the hill's south side between Central and Belmont Streets. Several original houses from this development remain on Atherton Street and off Harvard Street. The well-known Boston surveyor Alexander Wadsworth helped Brastow successfully lay out this subdivision to attract substantial homes on country estates for privileged suburbanites that held proprietary and managerial jobs. Its desirability was reinforced by expansive views of Cambridge and Boston, as well as easy access to Boston via the Fitchburg Railroad. Brastow's subdivision is the centerpiece of the Spring Hill Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. In 1889, a water standpipe (tower) was erected on the hill between Belmont and Lowell Streets (present-day Bailey Park), making municipal drinking water available to Somerville residents at higher elevations, and so facilitated additional housing development in the city's more elevated areas. By the end of the 19th century, the street grid had reached its present form, and the neighborhood filled with predominantly multi-family homes. Growth was fueled by the extension of streetcar lines from Lechmere Square and industrialization along Somerville Avenue and the Fitchburg Railroad. Spring Hill is home to Somerville Hospital, opened in 1891 on Highland Avenue, the Round House, located on Atherton Street, and the Somerville Museum, located on Central Street. At one time this neighborhood was home to both journalist Howie Carr and Winter Hill Gang leader Howie Winter. They lived one street apart, on Madison Street and Montrose Street, respectively. This was revealed in Carr's book about Irish mobster James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger, \\"The Brothers Bulger.\\" Architecture and landmarks There are several structures in Spring Hill that have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Spring Hill developed as a primarily residential neighborhood and most of its structures reflect that: * The Enoch Robinson Round House is a cylindrical, wood-frame residential building on Atherton Street. It was built in 1856 by hardware manufacturer Enoch Robinson, and is considered an offshoot of the octagon house-style popularized by phrenologist Orson Fowler.

The first lion fossil was excavated in southern Germany and described by Georg August Goldfuss using the scientific name Felis spelaea, which probably dates to the Würm glaciation and is 191,000 to 57,000 years old. Older lion skull fragments were excavated in Germany and described by Wilhelm von Reichenau under Felis fossilis in 1906. These are estimated at between 621,000 and 533,000 years old. The modern lion inhabited parts of Southern Europe since the early Holocene. Its diet probably included aurochs (Bos primigenius), red deer (Cervus elaphus), tarpan (Equus ferus), wild boar (Sus scrofa) and other herbivores. Historical literature, such as the Iliad of ancient Greece, features lion similes. Characteristics Bone fragments of fossil spelaea lions indicate that they were bigger than the modern lion and had less specialized lower teeth, reduced lower premolars and smaller incisors. As indicated by numerous artistic depictions, modern lions in the Balkans had less developed manes, and lacked abdominal and lateral manes as well as limb hair. Οn the other hand, lions from Transcaucasia exhibited all these features. Distribution Fossil records The oldest fossils excavated near Pakefield in the United Kingdom are estimated at 680,000 years old and represent Panthera fossilis. Lion fossils were excavated in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, France, United Kingdom, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Russia. Late Pleistocene Panthera spelaea bone fragments were radiocarbon dated to between the Weichselian glaciation and the Holocene, and are between 109,000 and 14,000 years old. This lion was widely distributed from the Iberian peninsula, Southeast Europe, across most of northern Eurasia into Alaska. In Eurasia, it became extinct between 14,900 and 14,100 years ago, and survived in Beringia until 13,800 to 13,300 years ago. Subfossil records The earliest subfossil lion remains to date were excavated in Basque Country and are about 9,600–7,000 years old, dating to the Boreal period. There are doubts if this was a modern lion or a late surviving spelaea cave lion. A neolithic lion tooth fragment representing the Atlantic Period was found in Karanovo, Bulgaria, and is estimated 6,000 years old. In Greece lions first appeared around 6,500–6,000 years ago as indicated by a front leg bone found in Philippi. Bone fragments of the modern lion were excavated in Hungary and in Ukraine's Black Sea region, which are estimated at around 5,500 to 3,000 years old. Remains were also found in Albania, Romania and European Turkey. Historic range of Panthera leo In Southeast Europe, the lion inhabited part of the Balkan peninsula up to Hungary and Ukraine during the Neolithic period. It survived in Bulgaria until the 4th or 3rd century BC. It became extinct in the Peloponnese around 1,000 BC. It disappeared from Macedonia around the first century AD, from Western Thrace not before the 2nd century AD and from Thessaly possibly in the 4th century AD, as Themistius regrets that in his time it disappeared from the latter and no more lions could be furnished for beast-shows.Παυσανίας 2nd cent A.D.: Ελλάδος περιήγησης.. In Transcaucasia, the lion was present until the 10th century. The peak of its historic range covered all of the plains and foothills of eastern Transcaucasia westward almost to Tbilisi. Northwards, its range extended through the eastern Caucasus, from the Apsheron Peninsula to the mouth of the Samur River near the current Azerbaijan-Russia border, extending to the Araks river. From there, the boundary of its range narrowly turned east to Yerevan, with its northern boundary then extending westward to Turkey. A Bronze Age statue of a lion from either southern Italy or southern Spain from c. 1000–1200 years CE, the \\"Mari-Cha Lion\\", was put on display at the Louvre Abu Dhabi. In culture The Löwenmensch figurine found in Germany has been dated to the Upper Paleolithic during the Pleistocene, about 35,000 to 40,000 years ago Lions feature in ancient Greek mythology and writings, including the myth of the Nemean lion, which was believed to be a supernatural lion that occupied the sacred town of Nemea in the Peloponnese. Homer mentioned lions 45 times in his poems, but this could have been due to his experience in Asia Minor.Schnitzler, A. E. (2011). Past and present distribution of the North African-Asian lion subgroup: a review. Mammal Review 41: 220−243. Phalaecus, a tyrant of Amvrakia (modern-day Arta), was allegedly killed by a female lion due to his holding a newborn lion cub, after finding it on a hunting expedition.Stephens, S. Callimachus (2015). Aetia. Dickinson College Commentaries. https://ds-drupal.haverford.edu/dcc/pl/callimachus- aetia/book-3/phalaecus-ambracia Conon refers to the myth of how Olynthus city got its name, when during around the period of the Trojan War, son of Strymon, Olynthos during a lion hunt was killed by a lion.Gedoyn, A. 1738: 186 Récits de Conon. According to Herodotus lions occurred between Achelous river and Nestus, being plentiful between Akanthos and Thermi. When Xerxes advanced near Echedorus in 480 BC, the troops' camels were attacked by lions. Xenophon stated around 400 BC that lions were hunted around Mount Kissos, Pangaio, the Pindus mountains and elsewhere.Ξενοφών, 5th-4th century BC: Κυνηγετικός Aristotle in the 4th century BC provided some data on lion distribution, behaviour, breeding and also anatomy. According to him, lions were more numerous in North Africa than in Europe; they had approached towns, and attacked people only if they were old, or had poor dental health.Αριστοτέλης, 4th century BCE: Των περί τα ζώα ιστοριών. Pliny the Elder mentions that European lions were stronger compared to those from Syria and Africa.Боев, З. 2016. Левът наш балкански. – Списание Осем, 6: 98-105. In the 2nd century AD, Pausanias referred to lion presence east of Nestus in Thrace, in the area of Abdera. He also referred to a story about Polydamas of Skotoussa, an Olympic winner in the 5th century BC, who allegedly used his bare hands to kill a lion on Thessalian part of Mount Olympus; and to one about Caranus of Macedon who according to the Macedonians, raised a trophy that was thrown down and destroyed by a lion that was rushing down from Mount Olympus. The Romans used Barbary lions from North Africa for lion-baiting, and lions from Greece for gladiatorial games.

They are distinguished from other Tamils from the island nation by their unique dialects, one of which is known as Negombo Tamil dialect. Other sub categories of native Tamils of Sri Lanka are Jaffna Tamils or Northern Tamils and Batticalao Tamils or Eastern Tamils from the traditional Tamil dominant North and East of the Island nation. Negombo is a principal coastal city in the Gampaha District and Puttalam is also the principal city within the neighbouring Puttalam District.Contact-Induced Morphosyntactic Realignment in Negombo Fishermen’s Tamil By Bonta Stevens, South Asian Language Analysis Roundtable XXIII (October 12, 2003) The University of Texas at Austin Negombo fishermen's Tamil: A case of contact-induced language change from Sri Lanka by Bonta Stevens , Cornell UniversityRoman-Dutch law versus Tesavalamai FERNANDO v. PROCTOR el al.Sri Lanka:History and Roots of Conflict by Jonathan Spencer Assimilation The main feature of the Negombo Tamils is the continuing process of assimilation into the majority Sinhalese ethnic group, a process known as Sinhalisation. This process is enabled via a number of caste myths and legends.Distribution of ethnic native Sri Lankan Tamils throughout the Island including the western Gamapaha (3.2%) and Puttalam districts (6.8%) In the Gampaha district ethnic Tamils have historically inhabited the coastal belt, as in the neighboring Puttalam district, which until the first two decades of the twentieth century had a substantial ethnic Tamil population, of whom the majority were Catholics and a minority were Hindus.

Lanka Guardian Vol. 3, No. I, May I, 1980, pp. 22-29, and May 15 1980, pp. 18-19. According to L.J.B. Turner, although the distinction between Sinhalese and Tamils of the present-day Sri Lanka is so marked, in the past there was considerable fusion between these ethnic groups. According to him the results of this fusion are most obvious on the western coast between Negombo and Puttalam, where a large proportion of the villagers, though they call themselves Sinhalese, speak Tamil and are undoubtedly of Tamil descent. According to local legends, their ancestors were captives from India or imported weavers and other artisans.1921 Ceylon census by L.B. Turner (p202 of Vol I)Spencer, J, Sri Lankan history and roots of conflict, p. 23 This historic process was embraced by the educational policies of a local bishop, Edmund Peiris, who was instrumental in changing the medium of education from Tamil to Sinhala.How Sri Lanka undermined infallibility of Pope John Paul II Survival of Tamil heritage Traditional fishing oru or outrigger canoe at Negombo beach is the traditional craft of the island, particularly the Sinhalese people, the vallam, thepam (crafts without an outrigger) and cattamaran (tied logs) are the traditional crafts of South IndiaRecords of Traditional Watercraft from South and West Sri Lanka, Gerhard Kapitan (G. Grainge & S. Devendra), pp. 22-46 Due to the bilingualism of some residents of both these districts, especially those who are traditional fishermen, the Tamil language survives as a lingua franca amongst migrating fishermen across the island. It is estimated that the Negombo dialect of Tamil language is spoken by perhaps 50,000 people who otherwise identify themselves as Sinhalese. This number does not include others who may speak various varieties of the Tamil language north of Negombo city towards Puttalam. Today most of those who retain their Tamil identity are Hindus and are mostly concentrated in a single coastal village called Udappu. This village has approximately 15,000 inhabitants and has become refuge for other Tamils displaced due to the Sri Lankan civil war from the rest of the country.The Maravar Suitor By Henry Corea (The Sunday Observer) There are also some Tamil Christians belonging to various Christian sects (mostly Catholics) who maintain their Tamil heritage throughout both these districts in major cities such as Negombo, Chilaw, Puttalam and in villages such as Mampuri. Tamil heritage is also maintained in place names in both these districts. Outside of the Tamil-dominated North East, Puttalam district has the highest percentage of place names of Tamil origin in Sri Lanka. There are also composite or hybrid place names in both these districts. The juxtaposition of Sinhala and Tamil place names indicated the peaceful coexistence of people of both language groups as well as the gradual assimilation process. There are also numerous Hindu temples across the districts mostly dedicated to Hindu village deities such as Ayyanar, who is also worshiped as Ayyanayake by the Sinhalese people. Other deities include Kali, Kannaki and Lord Shiva, whose famous temple at Munneswaram was built by Raja Raja Cholan a Tamil king.

History Biranha is a warrior of the Arctic Blue, a Blue splinter group represented on the Elite Council by Biranha's mother, Vana. He now leads them, taking a more violent approach to the problems faced by his people. Resurrection of Taras After the near death of his brother Taras in the Blue Sun incident, Biranha was sent by his mother to gather Cannon Hawke and Aspen Matthews, Taras' would be murderers. Biranha first captured Cannon on his yacht, bringing him to an Arctic base in the Atlantic. Vana performed experiments attempting to place the remains of Taras into Cannon so that Taras might live on in Cannon's body, while Biranha went after Aspen. At the same time, Sara Pezzini and Lara Croft were working together to find Lara's missing friend, Cannon. Clues lead them to the same place Aspen happened to be, as Biranha tries to capture Aspen. Biranha and his men kidnap Aspen and Sara, bringing the two back to their Arctic hideout. They were unaware Lara was following close behind. Lara helped the two girls escape, however they quickly return to the base to free Cannon. As the trio of women came to free cannon, Biranha took up a fight with Sara, unaware she wielded an ancient and powerful weapon known as the Witchblade. Sara defeated him, leaving him for dead under piles of ice. Meanwhile, Sara fought Biranha's mother, Vana, in the chamber where Taras and Cannon were being worked on. A reflected blast from Vana destroyed the water chamber that Taras was in, also killing taras. In her grief Vana used all her power in one suicidal final move, wiping out the whole base with hundreds of large, sharp icicles. Aspen's group managed to free Cannon and exit the base just in time however. Cannon Hawke mini-series Biranha somehow managed to survive the battle with Sara and his mothers destructive end only to begin another plan. As war was going on with the humans and the blue down south, Biranha and his men went to Japan to collect a valuable power source being examined in Japanese labs. In Biranha's attempt to steal the power source known as 'grey matter' (an unknown material in some way linked to the Blue Sun) he once more ran into Cannon who was there for a similar reason. Cannon serves no problem to Biranha and his men, and was later blamed by the Japanese government for stealing the grey matter. In a new Arctic base, Biranha and his men looked upon their great steal, being the only ones aware of what they thought of as its true potential. Their new base notably had carvings in the ice detailing the death of Biranha's mother, Vana, as well as an ice sculpture of Vana. However, Biranha's victory was short lived when Cannon and a small strike team made up of, Brande, Thassalar, and Kreeg attacked the base. Biranha's men easily outnumbered the group though. Just as Biranha was about to execute Cannon, Cannon plead with Biranha. This was not Cannon pleading for his life however, but Taras, whose conscience had taken over. Biranha had realized his mothers experiments had not utterly failed and Taras was still alive in Cannon. Kreeg took this moment of hesitation and confusion for his own advantage, striking Kreeg. Taras, still in control of cannon, surprised his own strike team though with an attack on Kreeg. Biranha, unsure what to do, had his men retreat with the grey matter well Cannon's team fought one another.

The book The book documents the public relations information put out by Timberlands West Coast Limited in order to win public support for logging of native forests on the West Coast of New Zealand. The material is based on a large amount of documentation leaked by a staff member from the local branch of Shandwick (now Weber Shandwick Worldwide), a global public relations company, which had been hired by Timberlands to run a secret campaign against environmental groups such as Native Forest Action between 1997 and 1999. The book describes its tactics of surveillance of meetings, monitoring the press and responding to every letter to the editor, greenwashing, the use of SLAPPs, cleaning anti- logging graffiti and blotting out campaign posters in public places, and managing to install its pro-logging educational materials into schools. The book alleges that almost every pro-logging letter or article was organized by this campaign. Reception and responses In 2000, a press council complaint was made against a letter to the editor in The Press, which argued that Hager had lied in the book. The complaint was not upheld, because the Press Council ruled that it was responsible for vetting robust debate in the letter pages. During a general Parliamentary debate in November 2006, when the book The Hollow Men had an injunction against its publication, the MP Gerry Brownlee said of the author and the book: The Hollow Men documents behind the scenes activities of the National Party, of which Brownlee was deputy leader at the time.

The crowd excitedly waves rifles and banners, while burning an American effigy. The movie then cuts to Kokomo, Indiana, showing a regular day at the old Kokomo High School (now Central Middle School). Several students are stuck in detention after school. Four terrorists cross the Canada–US border, and they attempt to attack the Blackriver Nuclear Power Plant (a mythical power plant in Howard County, Indiana) with a car bomb. After this fails, the remaining three escape, pursued by several police cruisers. Chief Rawlings (Chuck Connors), the Kokomo Police Department chief, is radioed, and he and the other officers join the chase. Two terrorists manage to survive and escape to Kokomo High School, where they hold the detention's students and teacher hostage. The Kokomo SWAT team surrounds the school, and Chief Rawlings attempts to negotiate the release of the hostages. Meanwhile, the terrorists kill several hostages that attempt to resist them. Chief Rawlings agrees to the terrorists' demand for a bus so they can get to an airport. The two terrorists drag a girl out with them, and they board the school bus. In the process, a boy running along the roof manages to jump on top of the school bus and tries to get in the bus as the terrorists lead the police on a high-speed car chase.

Rappaport (1926–1997) was an American anthropologist known for his contributions to the anthropological study of ritual and to ecological anthropology. Biography Rappaport received his Ph.D. at Columbia University and held a tenured position at the University of Michigan. One of his publications, Pigs for the Ancestors: Ritual in the Ecology of a New Guinea People (1968), is an ecological account of ritual among the Tsembaga Maring of New Guinea. This book is often considered the most influential and most cited work in ecological anthropology (see McGee and Warms 2004). In that book, and elaborated elsewhere, Rappaport coined the distinction between a people's cognized environment and their operational environment, that is, between how a people understand the effects of their actions in the world and how an anthropologist interprets the environment through measurement and observation. Work Rappaport's work demonstrates the correlation between a culture and its economy, with ritual invariably occupying a central role. His Pigs for the Ancestors: Ritual in the Ecology of a New Guinea People was published in 1968 and again in 1984. It is a classic case study of human ecology in a tribal society and the roles of culture and ritual. The research comes from his fieldwork and time spent with the Maring tribe of Papua New Guinea, who lacked hereditary chiefs or officials. Instead of treating whole cultures as separate units, Rappaport focused \\"on populations in the ecological sense, that is, as one of the components of a system of trophic exchanges taking place within a bounded area.\\" (Biersack, 1999, 5). Rappaport explained his reasoning behind using populations as opposed to cultures, \\"Cultures and ecosystems are not directly commensurable. An ecosystem is a system of matter and energy transactions among unlike populations or organisms and between them and the non-living substances by which they are surrounded. 'Culture' is the label for the category of phenomena distinguished from others by its contingency upon symbols.\\" (Biersack, 1999, 6). Throughout his work, he studied how an ecosystem maintains itself through a regulatory force. He aimed to show the adaptive value of different cultural forms in maintaining the pre- existing relationship of a population with their environment. In this case, it was ritual acting as the regulator, when pigs were sacrificed during times of warfare. This was done by the tribal members to acquit themselves of debts to the supernatural. Herds of pigs were maintained and fattened until the required work load pushed the limits of the tribe's carrying capacity, in which case the slaughter began. Rappaport showed that this ritual served several important purposes, such as restoring the ratio of pigs to humans, supplying the local communities with pork, and preventing land degradation. Rappaport found that a shrub called rumbim, was used to mark the beginning and ends of periods of warfare. The victorious Maring tribe would plant it on a designated area to mark the end of fighting, and the beginning of the slaughter. The shrub remained until the next slaughter was initiated, once the pig to human ratio became overwhelming due to competition for resources. His studies in Papua New Guinea allowed him to calculate the energy exchanges within the community, neighboring tribes, and their environment. In contrast to studying how culture and ritual could be adaptive, Rappaport also studied how the use of culture and ritual could be maladaptive or potentially harmful to ecological systems (Hoey, 590). He argued that cultures sometimes serves their own components, such as economic or political institutions, at the expense of men and ecosystems [such that].... Cultural adaptations, like all adaptations, can perhaps and usually do become maladaptive\\" (Hoey, 590). Throughout his work, Rappaport tends to stress unity and try to avoid potential problems in the social system. He often said, \\"I've tried for unification with everything from weighing sweet potatoes to God Almighty.... That's what I'm interested in.\\" (Hoey, 581). Years of study on ritual and religion, along with the addition of interests in environmental issues, led to later works, such as Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity. In this ambitious book, Rappaport addresses the history of humanity as part of the evolution of life as a whole. Ritual, which he defines as \\"the performance of more or less invariant sequences of formal acts and utterances not encoded by the performers\\", lays the framework for the creation and formulation of religion (Wolf, 1999, 21). A key theme is that language could not arise until some means had been established to guarantee the reliability of words. Words are cheap, intrinsically unreliable and might always deceive. Costly and repetitive ritual action - the invariance of liturgy - emerged during human evolution as the means by which communities coped with such threats, guaranteeing the reliability of words uttered by ritual performers (cf. Knight 1998, 1999). When persons take part in a ritual, they are able to signal that they are the authority of the ritual, thus reinforcing the social contract in place. He explains the hierarchical demission of liturgical orders, in which he breaks down four elements of ritual. \\"Ultimate sacred postulates\\" form the top of the hierarchy, which are the most fundamental elements of religion. They tend to acquire sanctity over time, since they are often vague and unable to be disproven. Next, he describes cosmological axioms which describe the basic nature of the universe. Following these axioms come the rules that govern interactions and conduct. The fourth point he makes is about the understandings of the external world, where changes occur as a response to the conditions. These points he provides show these adaptive changes help to preserve the system as a whole. Rappaport developed as a well-respected contributor to the field and its subsequent discourse by the coinage and adaptation of new anthropological concepts. He is known for his distinction between \\"cognized models\\" and \\"operational models,\\" in which the former looked at reality and adaptations in how a people's culture understands nature. The cognized model, according to Rappaport, is the \\"model of the environment conceived by the people who act in it,\\" (Wolf, 1999, 19). The operational model on the other hand, is one \\"which the anthropologist constructs through observation and measurement of empirical entities, events and material relationships. He takes this model to represent for analytic purposes, the physical world of the group he is studying.... as far as actors are concerned, it has no function,\\" Rappaport explains (Wolf, 1999, 19). In his article \\"Risk and the Human Environment\\", he examines the studies of risk to the \\"human environment,\\" which have been legally mandated by the government for environmental and resource planning. He emphasizes variables such as economic, social and physical properties, which all must be taken into account. He provides an example of a hypothetical oil spill which severely damaged marine life. White fishermen may consider the spill an economic loss; however, for a Native American tribe, the damage would be far more devastating to their subsistence lifestyle. This article in particular stresses the need to further explore the natures of the human environment, and not make a generalization when considering possible risks (Rappaport, 1996, 65). Rappaport served as Chair of the Department of Anthropology, University of Michigan. He also was a past president of the American Anthropological Association. Rappaport died of cancer in 1997.

Aggressive, xenophobic, yet industrious small humanoid creatures, kobolds are noted for their skill at building traps and preparing ambushes. In the original Dungeons & Dragons game, kobolds were goblinoids, but they have been depicted as reptilian humanoids in later editions of the game. Publication history The kobolds of Dungeons & Dragons were inspired by the Kobold sprites of German folklore, but, aside from their shared association with mining and their small stature, the creatures have little in common. Dungeons & Dragons (1974–1976) The kobold was one of the first monsters introduced in the earliest edition of the game, in the Dungeons & Dragons \\"white box\\" set (1974),Gygax, Gary, and Dave Arneson. Dungeons & Dragons (3-Volume Set) (TSR, 1974) where they were described simply as similar to goblins, but weaker. Kobolds were further detailed in Supplement II: Blackmoor (1975). Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st edition (1977–1988) The kobold appears in the first edition Monster Manual (1977), where it is described as a tribal creature with war bands, found in dank, dark places. The mythology and attitudes of the kobolds are described in detail in Dragon #63 (July 1982), in Roger E. Moore's article, \\"The Humanoids\\". A few years later, in Roger Moore's editorial \\"Tucker's kobolds\\" in Dragon #127 (November 1987), a scenario is described where a band of well-prepared kobolds uses guerrilla tactics to significantly challenge a far more powerful party of adventurers. In the article \\"Hey, Wanna Be a Kobold?\\" by Joseph Clay in Dragon #141 (January 1989), kobolds, xvarts, goblins, and orcs were presented as player character races along with two new character classes the \\"Shaman\\" and the \\"Witch Doctor\\". Dungeons & Dragons (1977–1999) This edition of the D&D; game included its own version of the kobold, in the Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set (1977, 1981, 1983).Gygax, Gary, and Dave Arneson [1974], edited by J. Eric Holmes. Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set (TSR, 1977)Gygax, Gary, and Dave Arneson [1974], edited by Tom Moldvay. Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set (TSR, 1981)Gygax, Gary, and Dave Arneson [1974], edited by Frank Mentzer. Dungeons & Dragons Set 1: Basic Rules (TSR, 1983) The kobold was featured as a player character race in the Orcs of Thar gazetteer (1989). Kobolds were also later featured in the Dungeons & Dragons Game set (1991), the Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia (1991),Allston, Aaron, Steven E. Schend, Jon Pickens, and Dori Watry. Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia (TSR, 1991) the Classic Dungeons & Dragons Game set (1994), and the Dungeons & Dragons Adventure Game set (1999).Slavicsek, Bill. Dungeons & Dragons Adventure Game (TSR, 1999) Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition (1989–1999) The kobold appears first in the Monstrous Compendium Volume One (1989), which also introduced the urd, a winged version of the kobold. The kobold and urd are reprinted in the Monstrous Manual (1993). The Dragon Mountain kobold appeared in the Dragon Mountain adventure set (1993). The kobold is detailed as a playable character race in The Complete Book of Humanoids (1993). The kobold is later presented as a playable character race again in Player's Option: Skills & Powers (1995).Niles, Douglas and Dale Donovan. Player's Option: Skills & Powers (TSR, 1995) Dungeons & Dragons 3.0 edition (2000–2002) The kobold appears in the Monster Manual for this edition (2000). Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 edition (2003–2007) The kobold appears in the revised Monster Manual for this edition (2003). The aquatic kobold, the arctic kobold, the desert kobold, the earth kobold, and the jungle kobold were all introduced in Unearthed Arcana (2004).Collins, Andy, Jesse Decker, David Noonan, and Rich Redman. Unearthed Arcana (Wizards of the Coast, 2004) The kobold was detailed in Dragon #332 (June 2005), in the \\"Ecology of the Kobold\\". The kobold is detailed as a player character race in Races of the Dragon (2006). Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition (2008–2014) The kobold appears in the Monster Manual for this edition (2008), including the kobold minion, the kobold skirmisher, the kobold slinger armed with a variety deadly thrown pots, the armored kobold dragonshield, and the roguish kobold slyblade. The rules for this edition allow kobolds to shift easily around enemies and grant them bonuses when they mob together against a single target. The backgrounds states they tend to form cults that worship local dragons, and sometimes serve them if the dragon deigns to take notice.Mearls, Mike, Stephen Schubert, and James Wyatt. Monster Manual (Wizards of the Coast, 2008) In addition, the article \\"Creature Incarnations: Kobolds\\" in Dragon issue 364 contains a variety of additional kobolds, including the kobold chieftain (level 5 soldier [leader]), kobold wild mage (controller), kobold piker (level 2 brute), kobold spiker (level 3 controller), kobold vermin handler (level 3 artillery), kobold rat master (level 4 elite soldier), kobold horde (level 6 skirmisher), and kobold war priest (level 5 controller). This article also describes kobold lairs, and the kobold reaction if they (unexpectedly) fell one of their player-character opponents. Finally, Kobolds reappear in Monster Vault (2010), including the kobold tunneler (minion), the kobold skirmisher, the kobold dragonshield and the kobold quickblade. The lore in this book emphasizes the kobold predilection for traps and stealthy theft, as well as their often suicidal reverences for dragons. Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition (2014–) The kobold appears in the Monster Manual for this edition (2014), as well as the winged kobold (or 'urd'). Kobolds in this edition suffer a penalty when exposed to sunlight, but are granted bonuses when they mob up against a single opponent.Mearls, Mike, and James Wyatt. p.195, Monster Manual (Wizards of the Coast, 2014) In addition, Volo's Guide to Monsters (2016) adds the returning kobold dragonshield, the magical kobold scale sorcerer, and the crafty kobold inventor, Mearls, Mike, and James Wyatt. p.165-167, Volo's Guide to Monsters (Wizards of the Coast, 2016) as well as adding the kobold as a playable race.Mearls, Mike, and James Wyatt. p.119, Volo's Guide to Monsters (Wizards of the Coast Ecology In the 3rd edition of the game, kobolds are distantly related to dragons,Kestrel, Gwendolyn F.M., Wilkes, Jennifer Clarke, Liquette, Kolja Raven. Races of the Dragon (Wizards of the Coast, 2006). and are often found serving them as minions. Kobolds speak a version of the Draconic tongue, with a yipping accent. In their original appearance in the canon, kobolds were described as dog-like humanoids with ratlike tails, horns and hairless scaly skin, and were not associated with dragons. They were called goblinoids, although the word had a broader sense than it was later to acquire; in the Monstrous Compendium series and Monster Mythology the goblinoid category included not only goblins, hobgoblins and bugbears but also orcs, xvarts and gremlins. From the third edition, the term \\"goblinoid\\" has been reserved for goblins, hobgoblins, norkers, and similar creatures. Kobolds are much more explicitly reptilian in current editions, though they were egg-layers as far back as first edition AD&D.; The Greyhawk Player's Guide said they have \\"certain features that are both reptilian and doglike.\\" Kobolds are omnivores with no scruples about what or whom they eat. They can digest bark, dirt, leather, eggshells, or their own younger siblings if they are desperate enough. Kobolds are extremely fecund egg-layers, having the highest birth rate (and death rate) of all humanoid species. A female kobold will lay a clutch of hard-shelled eggs two weeks after fertilization; the eggs must be incubated for an additional 60 days before hatching. Kobolds reach maturity by the age of eight or nine and are considered \\"great wyrms\\" by the age of 121. They live up to 135 years. While they do bond with one another, they have no concept of monogamy. Kobolds have an extreme hatred for gnomes, with whom they compete for the same areas and mining rights, as well as pixies, brownies, and sprites. They are often at war with goblins, and the numerous kobold-goblin wars help keep the populations of both races down to a manageable level. Xvarts often act as intermediaries between kobolds and goblins, usually dominating and taking out their aggression on the kobolds. Environment Kobolds are found in all climates. They seem to prefer dark, damp underground lairs and overgrown forests. They are industrious miners and if left to their own devices can carve out massive tunnel complexes, which they quickly fill to capacity thanks to their rapid rate of reproduction – which would explain their use as cannon fodder enemies. Many kobold lairs are guarded by boars or giant weasels. Their lairs are fluid, with new tunnels continually being excavated and old ones collapsed. Most lairs include a temple or shrine, a kiln, an egg hatchery, and a place for storing food. Larger ones also contain places for cultivating food and livestock. Typical physical characteristics Kobolds vary in height between 2'-2'8\\" in 3.5 edition, and 3'6\\"-4'0\\" in 4th edition, with scaly, hairless hides, reptilian heads, and tails, and weigh over in 3.5 edition and about in 4th edition. Males are about three inches taller and ten pounds heavier than most females. Their hides are typically a rust-brown or reddish black color, with ivory-colored horns. Their heads are described as dog-like, but in recent editions they are illustrated as looking more like crocodiles. Their eyes glow red, and they can see accurately even in lightless conditions up to 60 feet away. Kobolds are described as smelling like a cross between damp dogs and stagnant water. Unlike dragons, kobolds are cold-blooded. The scales covering their bodies are like that of an iguana or other large lizard. The scales that cover their tails are very fine, so that they resemble the naked tails of rats. Kobolds lose and gain new teeth throughout their lives, often saving and making necklaces from them. Kobolds favor raggedy-looking red or orange clothing made from leather or the silk of giant spiders. They never wear shoes, but they are fond of jewelry and other ornamentation. Kobolds shed their skin about once a season, in patches, over the course of a week. They keep themselves well-groomed, regularly polishing their horns, claws, and teeth. Alignment Kobolds are usually lawful evil. Exceptions are more likely to be non-evil than non-lawful. In the 4th edition of the game, their alignment is given simply as evil, though this implies orderliness in the 4th edition alignment system. Neutral (unaligned) kobolds also exist, usually the servants of good or unaligned metallic dragons.Draconomicon: Metallic Dragons Society Kobold society is influenced by their lawful evil alignment. They will plan and dig mines industriously, while laying cruel traps for interlopers. If they must confront an enemy, they will mass their troops for an ambush. Among the monstrous humanoids, they are known for cunning plans; unlike many, they also share those plans among the tribe. General plans and goals are common knowledge, and detailed plans are shared with all who ask, to allow them to work fruitfully for the good of the tribe. Kobolds have a natural hatred of other non-draconic creatures because of mistreatment of their race. Kobolds have specialized laborers, yet the majority of kobolds are miners. The most coveted careers are trapmaker, sorcerer, caretaker, and warrior. Kobolds typically apprentice in their chosen profession at the age of three. A kobold's job may change over the years based on the needs of the tribe. Kobold tribes are gerontocracies, ruled by their eldest member, who is known as the All-Watcher. Often this leader is a powerful sorcerer. Kobold laws may change along with their leaders. Kobolds prefer exile to execution, and in some disputes, kobolds tribes will split in order to spread their kind over a larger region. Kobolds often lay eggs in a common nest, with specialized foster parents to watch over the eggs and wyrmlings (young under one year). Kobold society is tribal with war bands based on clans. As many as ten families can be part of a clan. Each clan is responsible for patrolling a ten-mile radius. The most numerous kobold tribes include the Torturers, the Impalers, the Gougers, the Cripplers, and the Mutilators. Religion The main deity of the kobolds is Kurtulmak, the god of war and mining. The other main god worshipped by kobolds is Gaknulak, the god of protection, stealth, trickery, and traps. A lesser-known kobold demigod is Dakarnok. Individual kobolds and kobold tribes may worship other deities of the draconic pantheon; Tiamat and Io often play a significant role in their creation myths. Kobolds and gnomes have an instinctual hate of each other because of a \\"prank\\" played upon Kurtulmak by the gnomish deity Garl Glittergold. According to some kobold myths, Garl collapsed Kurtulmak's cave because the gnome god saw that they were likely to become the dominant race in the world. The draconic god Io offered Kurtulmak the chance to become the god of his race or to give him the strength to clear the mine. Kurtulmak chose to lead his race in the form of a god. The gnomes, naturally, have their own version of the myth which casts their god in a considerably better light. Clerics of Kurtulmak are known as the Eyes of Kurtulmak. They rarely live long enough to become chieftains, but they have a great deal of power and influence, serving as mine supervisors and directing the tribe toward \\"divinely inspired\\" goals. Organized worship services are almost nonexistent, but most kobolds recite small prayers throughout the day. Many kobolds believe in reincarnation, which Kurtulmak may use as either reward or punishment depending on one's service to one's tribe. One of the duties of a cleric is to watch over eggs and hatchlings thought to be the reincarnation of a distinguished kobold. Language Kobolds speak a version of the Draconic tongue, with a yipping accent (their voices are said to resemble the sound of small dogs barking). Some also learn to speak Common, Goblin, Orcish, and Undercommon. The written form of Draconic was originally developed by kobolds in the service of dragons, as dragons themselves see little reason to write. Notable kobolds *Deekin Scalesinger is a Kobold bard who is an NPC minion found in several of the expansions to Neverwinter Nights. Deekin is a shopkeeper in Neverwinter Nights 2 as well. Kimberley Wallace of Game Informer considered Deekin to be one of BioWare's best characters. *Rhix is a Kobold Merchant NPC in the MMORPG Game Neverwinter. He can be found next to the Seven Suns Coster Market. *Kol XIV was the high doge of Kol in the Broken Lands region of the Mystara campaign setting. Born Constantin Diocletius, he inherited his rulership from his parents. As a skilled politician he prevented the domination of Kol by King Thar making Kol an ally of Thar's. After the Wrath of the Immortals he became the prince of New Kolland in Glantri, the first humanoid to become a prince in that country. Kol XIV is middle aged and stands at four and a half. He has a thin white mustache. Usually he wears a red Toga and a crown made of fungi. *Klobt-A-Lozn appeared in the AD&D; first edition module In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords as the leader of a forgotten kobold tribe in the caverns below Drachen Keep, in the Pomarj region of the World of Greyhawk campaign setting. *Meepo is a Kobold who shows up in the 3rd Edition adventure module, The Sunless Citadel, and as a miniature in the War of the Dragon Queen set for Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures. *Tucker's kobolds were a tribe of kobolds featured in Roger E. Moore's editorial in Dragon issue 127. They were used by a Dungeon Master, Tucker, who ran an adventure for high level characters featuring an ordinary tribe of kobolds who utilised traps, ambushes and local knowledge to significantly challenge the party, going against the stereotype of kobolds posing no significant threat. Tucker's kobolds became a famous part of Dungeons & Dragons lore, often referred to as an example of how cunning and local knowledge can be used by physically weak opponents to overcome much more powerful adversaries. *In Eye of the Beholder, the kobolds are led by an undead kobold named Albrik. Kobold subraces Urds Urds are a subrace of winged kobolds, who otherwise maintained separate societies from standard kobolds. Urds worship the deity Kuraulyek.Sargent, Carl. Monster Mythology (TSR, 1992) In third edition, urds seem to have been replaced with a subset of kobolds known as the dragonwrought kobolds, who occasionally have wings or other draconic qualities, and hold an elevated status in kobold society. Other subraces The aquatic kobold, the arctic kobold, the desert kobold, the earth kobold, and the jungle kobold were all introduced in Unearthed Arcana (2004). History Kobolds have a scattered history, turning up in isolated regions with no apparent connection to one another. Even given the often nomadic nature of kobolds, divine agency is often evoked to explain how kobolds spread so far. Kobolds are thought to have begun their existence as the servants of dragons. Unlike goblins, hobgoblins, and orcs, no Suel name for kobolds is given in The Scarlet Brotherhood, suggesting they were not known in the ancient Suel Imperium. Other publishers The kobold is fully detailed in Paizo Publishing's book Classic Monsters Revisited (2008), on pages 28–33.Baur, Wolfgang, Jason Bulmahn, Joshua J. Frost, James Jacobs, Nicolas Logue, Mike McArtor, James L. Sutter, Greg A. Vaughan, Jeremy Walker. Classic Monsters Revisited (Paizo, 2008) Paizo also published Kobolds of Golarion a 32-page booklet detailing Kobold sociology, physiology and psychology, along with several variant traits, feats and class archetypes, while also introducing several new spells, traps and items. Reception Screen Rant compiled a list of the game's \\"10 Most Powerful (And 10 Weakest) Monsters, Ranked\\" in 2018, calling this one of the weakest, saying \\"When a dungeon master has run several low-level Dungeons & Dragons adventures, they will inevitably grow weary of using the same creatures from before and will want to shake things up. That's the moment when they prepare to paint over the serial numbers and replace the goblins with kobolds.\\" References Further reading * * *Holian, Gary, Erik Mona, Sean K Reynolds, and Frederick Weining.

The series was created by the duo Phil Lord and Chris Miller. It still occasionally airs reruns on Teletoon and was briefly aired by MTV and MTV2 in 2003.  Development  According to co-creator Miller the reason for putting historical figures in a school setting was that \\"We chose these characters because they're sort of mythic figures, even people with a very limited knowledge of history have some preconceived ideas about them, which is part of the fun.\\" Lord adds, \\"The point of the whole show is that these people are not living up to their genetic forebears.\\" Lord and Miller also explained that the development of the character of Gandhi as a \\" party animal\\" was because they researched that the young Gandhi was \\"immature\\" and \\"into partying\\" before witnessing the suffering in South Africa. Another was the reason why they introduced Ponce De León so late in the show, as a parody of how Beverly Hills, 90210 would bring in characters that were never seen before and then kill them off in a melodramatic fashion.  Main characters   Abe Lincoln  Abe Lincoln is the clone of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States. He is the main protagonist of the series, and most of the episodes are seen through his point of view. Abe is an average, awkward, naive, shy, clumsy yet kind teenager who feels he is struggling to live up to the legacy of Abraham Lincoln. He has been friends with Gandhi since they were babies and also good friends with Joan. Throughout season one Abe desperately pursued Cleopatra, his love interest; at first she used him but he had eventually won her love and becomes her boyfriend starting at the end of the episode Sleep of Faith in which she agreed to go out with him after he won a drag race (despite the fact Cleo ditched him to be with JFK), they did not start a real relationship until the episode Plane Crazy. Abe is very skinny and physically weak to complement his weak-willed and indecisive nature and he is claimed to weigh only 104 pounds despite being one of the tallest students in the school. He is often seen to fall into peer pressure despite his moral values. Though intelligent, he is very unaware when it comes to other people's feelings, as he regularly insulted his friend Joan without even realizing it. He has a bitter rivalry with JFK, mostly involving his attempts to win over Cleopatra and a possible joke to one president being Republican and the other Democrat. Another reason for their rivalry is because JFK is secretly angry over how Abe treats Joan on a daily basis in his attempt to win Cleopatra over. He is unaware that his best friend Joan of Arc is in love with him, and even when she makes advances upon him or professes her love, he seems obstinately stuck in viewing her as his \\"girl friend, not his girlfriend\\", even to the point of improbably re-interpreting some of her statements and actions as gestures of friendship or humor(something of which JFK is angry about). In the series finale, Abe realizes his feelings for Joan are more than platonic. However, this was only after Cleopatra had given her an involuntary make-over for the prom and the anger he feels when he finds Joan with JFK. Before, Abe was oblivious to the fact that Cleo is attempting to drive a wedge between him and Joan and Gandhi, who she views as being detrimental to her image. When alone with Cleo, he found himself thinking about Joan more. Eventually, Abe realizes her true nature in driving away his friends and sees Cleo for the shallow person she is inside. After ending his relationship with Cleo, he rushes to Joan's house to tell her the truth of his feelings for her. By the time he got there to tell her, Abe discovers to his dismay that Joan has moved on and is in a relationship with JFK. He is 16 years old. He drives a white 1960s-esque Lincoln Continental. He is captain of the basketball team because he is the tallest guy at school and on the cross country team though it is clear he lacks athleticism, and he is the president of the anti-drug club. His famous catchphrase is \\"Dinger!\\" often said out of great excitement or frustration. Abe is usually seen wearing a white T-shirt with a blue collar and blue sleeves, long, baggy cargo jeans and sneakers. He is very tall, skinny and gangly. He has messy brown hair and a scruffy black chin-strap beard (without a mustache) and a mole on his left cheek Voiced by Will Forte. The Lego Movie references Clone High by casting Forte as the voice of Lego Abe Lincoln.  Joan of Arc  Joan of Arc is the clone of Jeanne d'Arc, the devout 15th century French militant. She is Abe's closest friend and is obviously in love with him (everyone knows it except Abe himself), though his constant ignorance of this causes her a lot of frustration. In the episode ADD: The Last D Stands for Disorder Joan admits to being a \\"goth\\" and has a very moody, cynical, aloof, sarcastic and angst-ridden personality. She has a tendency to erupt melodramatically into tears, usually when Abe ignores her advances or scores with Cleopatra. She hates Cleopatra considering her to be a bimbo and a snob but develops a special hatred when Cleo starts dating Abe and when she is forced to live with Cleo because her house burnt down. Joan prefers to confide in various characters such as Mr. Butlertron, Gandhi, and Jesus Cristo when she needs emotional support, though she also frequently allows Abe to obliviously confide in her regarding his infatuation with Cleo and their amorous affairs together, much to her emotional detriment. Joan is also very intelligent, well-read, witty and highly ethical and will speak up for what she believes in, though she is always ignored by the others as they see her as being too \\"outspoken\\". She serves as an environmentalist, a vegetarian and activist. mated to be attractive, though she does not recognize or emphasize this and dutifully wears an orthodontic retainer. Joan has proven to appeal to the other male characters, notably JFK whom frequently harasses her. Despite this, he is secretly attracted to Joan not only because she is immune to his charms, but also he is the only one who sees more to her as a person than Abe. In the Series Finale after realizing that Abe will never see her more than a friend, JFK comforts Joan and takes her to the prom with him. It's there that she realizes her feelings for JFK and sees more to him than the arrogant jock he usually displays in front of others. When Abe came over to her house to finally tell her the truth that he is in love with her, Joan has moved on and begins a relationship with JFK. She is 16 years old. She is an agnostic (she rejects religion but is not disinclined to accepting the existence of God), which puts her at odds with the real Jeanne d'Arc who was a devout Christian (this was once explained by feeling unable to live up to the real Jeanne d'Arc). Joan makes home-movies to express herself artistically. In the episode Makeover, Makeover, Makeover, Abe prints flyers of her in order to get her a date for the prom and the flyer describes her as Janeane Garofaloesque. Joan's appearance consists of a tight black long-sleeved shirt and tight green cargo pants with black boots. She has pale skin, dark red hair, wears black eye liner, purple lipstick and a black choker around her neck. When Cleo gave her a makeover, she wore a different hairstyle, purple eyeshadow and eyeliner, red lipstick a tight black sleeveless leather minidress with a black and red, lacey pushup bra being revealed, fishnet stockings and higheels to highlight her shapely physique. In her original design, she had black hair. Voiced by Nicole Sullivan.  Mahatma Gandhi  Gandhi is the clone of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, the Indian activist of the Indian Revolution. Gandhi is a hyperactive, funny, talkative, immature and rather mischievous teenager who wants to be accepted by those around him. The reason for his often-ridiculous behavior and underachieving in academics is because he thinks he cannot live up to the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi. Though he has a somewhat likable and friendly personality, his outrageous behavior tends to offend and annoy others. He is a close friend of Abe and at times a confidant to Joan when he is not annoying her. Gandhi knows Joan likes Abe but does not say anything for Joan's privacy. Gandhi believes he is a friend of the popular students and he especially wants to be best friends with JFK in order to be popular by association. He and JFK had three episodes in which they interacted, JFK admitted that he liked Gandhi as a friend in the episode Makeover, Makeover, Makeover. Gandhi also erroneously believes himself to be a ladies man though no females are attracted to him except for Marie Curie but he did gain the attraction of several ladies when he briefly got a makeover as \\"GFK\\". In the series finale, Gandhi realizes his feelings for Marie and they begin a platonic relationship. It is revealed that he used to be Cleo's foster brother for 10 years until she told her parents that he was hurting her image so he was disowned and later placed in the care of new foster parents, a stereotypical Jewish couple (despite the fact that Gandhi donated his kidney to Cleo when she was in terrible pain, something she seems to ignore). He is 16 years old. He is also very short for his age much to his own dismay (even having to use a booster seat when riding in a car). His favorite movie is American Pie and according to the 2003 MTV website, he is the associate editor of the school newspaper The Tatler in which he reviews movies. Gandhi is called by various nicknames notably \\"G-spot\\" and \\"G-force\\". He also is school's mascot DNA Dan and the treasurer for the Solid Gandhi Dancers. Gandhi appearance consist of a gray short-sleeved shirt with a red stripe, blue jeans and white and red sneakers. He stands very short, is very skinny (almost to the point of looking emaciated) and has dark, swarthy skin. He is bald, wears glasses and has a black mustache and beard. He also wears a gold earring on his right ear. His portrayal as a party animal enraged many in India, including prominent members of India's parliament. Voiced by actor Michael McDonald.  Cleopatra Smith  Cleopatra Smith is the clone of Cleopatra VII, the last Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt. Cleopatra or \\"Cleo\\" is a beautiful, intelligent and popular student who is more commonly known as Abe's initial love interest. She is a very selfish, snobby, cynical, vain, manipulative, pretentious and materialistic stereotypical school diva who cares only about her social image, beauty and popularity. She shows very little consideration for other people's feelings and believes she deserves to be treated like a queen among her peers. She is also an overachiever who frequently covets success in order to fit into her \\"queen bee\\" status. It is shown that she acts the way she does out of intense insecurity, and because she has an abusive foster mother who openly harbors contempt towards Cleo. She used to date JFK, but only because she thought he was good for her image. She became Abe's girlfriend since the episode Plane Crazy. Cleo is portrayed as seductive, hedonistic and libidinous, as result she is sexually promiscuous and hates it when people make of fun of it, especially when Joan does it to spite her. Cleo has always been aware that Joan harbors strong feelings for Abe, and will often warn Joan to stay away from him after she and Abe began dating. When she discovered JFK's feelings for Joan, Cleo encouraged him to pursue her. In the Series Finale, when Abe was about to have sex with Cleo after prom, he begins to realize his feelings for Joan. After seeing how Cleo had been mistreating both her and Gandhi, Abe ends his relationship to her and leaves. Despite her arrogance and mean-spirited nature she shows a limited ability of compassion as she willingly gave Joan a makeover to help boost her confidence, she gave up some of her vanity to date the obviously unpopular student Abe Lincoln and consoled JFK when he was sad about Poncey's death. She is 16 years old. She is captain of the cheerleading team and is the Campus Life editor for The Tatler in which she interviews students and guest stars. Her physical appearance is derived from the wall paintings of Ancient Egyptian women. She is portrayed as being a tan Egyptian girl which contradicts with the fact the real Cleopatra was of Ancient Greek descent. Cleo wears a blue (sometimes red or orange depending on her outfit) headband, a white tank top which shows her large cleavage and a tight black miniskirt to show her volumptuous figure and wears pumps. At night she sleeps in sexy purple lingerie and is sometimes seen in her cheerleading uniform at school. At the prom she wore a tight, revealing and seductive red dress and a black minidress at Poncey's funeral. Voiced by actress Christa Miller, the wife of Clone High producer Bill Lawrence.  John F. Kennedy (JFK)  JFK is the clone of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States. JFK is the stereotypical popular high school jock. He is arrogant, competitive, lecherous, vain and at times dimwitted. He initially antagonized Abe and Gandhi but he later befriends them by the end of the series. However, JFK and Abe maintained a bitter rivalry, mainly due to them wanting to win over Cleopatra over in the early episodes. This later changed when JFK realized that he was in love with Joan and despised the way Abe callously treated her by ignoring her feelings for him. It is shown in episodes Episode Two: Election Blue-galoo and in Raisin the Stakes, that JFK is a very good speaker. He speaks with a thick, stereotypical, non-rhotic New England dialect and a Boston accent (a parody of the Kennedy accent) that is exaggerated and monotone for a comical effect (he usually switches \\"-er\\" suffix with \\"-ah\\" and also uses \\"er\\" and \\"uh\\" as filler which occur during mid-sentence). Despite his apparent macho exterior he is very sensitive, emotional and easily offended. JFK is known for his narcissism and his libido. He also has a penchant for using dirty jokes and innuendo. Despite this, JFK has been known to be very compassionate towards others. Despite being accident-prone, a target of physical harm and losing his best friend Poncey to a freak accident: he does not believe in the Kennedy curse - \\"Nothing bad ever happens to the Kennedys\\" and \\"I'm a Kennedy, I'm not accustomed to tragedy\\". His plan of living up to John F. Kennedy is simply by being a womanizer and he is shown to be attractive to women, he seems not to know much about his clonefather besides that he conquered the moon. It is shown that he likes Joan, which is possibly because she is one of the few girls that is immune to his charm. Another reason why JFK likes her is because she is more compassionate and has always seen more to her than Abe did. In the Series Finale, he comforts Joan and takes her to the prom with his other prom dates. However, they leave him when they realize JFK and Joan are in love with each other. It is at prom and later at Joan's home that they begin a relationship, much to Abe's detest. He is 16 years old. He mainly drives a yellow van but in the episode Sleep of Faith drove a 1950s-esque corvette which was destroyed. He also seems to have a fear of sudden movements and friendly \\"hand gun\\" gestures as he constantly ducks, probably as a cruel joke about the John F. Kennedy assassination. He questioned his sexuality when he became attracted to \\"John Dark\\" (Joan in drag). He is the captain of the football team and soccer team. When he gets hit by Joan, he yells out \\"Bobby!\\", a reference to Robert F. Kennedy. JFK is seen wearing a red sweater with a white stripe in the center and on his sleeves, over a white shirt and tight khaki pants with brown loafers. He has tall, full brown hair and has a fit and muscular physique. His eyes are usually half-open but will get bigger whenever he is shocked, angered or upset. He appears as very healthy even though the real John F. Kennedy suffered a variety of sicknesses from birth (including Addison's disease). In 2020 the show had a resurgence in popularity after multiple voice clips of JFK became popular on TikTok, such as “Nothing bad ever happens to the Kennedys” said before he wreaks a red corvette whilst in a drag race against Abe to win a date with Cleo in “Sleep of Faith,” and “watch me, hold me, sign my cast for me, WHEEL ME,” a line sung during “Raisin the Stakes.” Voiced by Christopher Miller. Miller had to study the speeches of John F. Kennedy in order to perfect the voice and the accent.  Principal Scudworth  Principal Cinnamon J. Scudworth, Ph.D. is a deluded, self- aggrandizing megalomaniac of a scientist who always wears rubber dish-gloves and is absolutely horrible at being a principal, he is always trying to betray the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures and use the clones for his own convoluted schemes, his favorite being a clone themed amusement park. He is shown to have very little control over his emotions and is prone to violent outbursts. It's possible he is an atheist because he once said \\"so, religion is for fools?...fools and liberals\\". As seen in the opening theme, there is a photo of him and Mr. Butlertron salvaging the remains of Abraham Lincoln, which implies that he was the one along with Mr. B who had dug the corpses of the people in the mid-1980s who would later be used in the cloning experiment. Scudworth apparently had a son named \\"Brian Parker Scudworth\\" who he bet in a basketball game against the principal of GESH and lost, as a result Brian ended up getting eaten. He is seen wearing glasses, a long white lab coat, yellow rubber gloves (which he never takes off), underneath his coat are black pants and shoes. He has brown hair with a bald spot and a small soul patch under his lower lip. Voiced by Phil Lord.  Mr. Lynn Butlertron  Mr. Lynn Butlertron is the loyal robot servant and best friend/roommate to Scudworth who is programmed with a highly sensitive compassion protocol (a parody of Mr. Belvedere). Also known as Mr. B. He calls everyone \\"Wesley\\", a reference to the youngest son on Mr. Belvedere, Wesley Owens. Strangely, even though he is a robot, Mr. Butlertron is shown without his mustache in a photograph taken in the 80s in the opening to the show and he also has chest hair and armpit hair as shown when he took off his red cardigan sweater vest. Though he is usually polite and laid-back, he does have a temper which came out when had a fight with Scangrade and when he showed jealousy towards Ecybo Pooch. Mr. Butlertron is very human-like being programmed to be highly sentient (though its unknown on how he can feel physical sensations) and possesses artificial intelligence that which enables him to show human emotions, have free will and have facial expressions. He genuinely cares for Scudworth and the students. He might have a relationship with Scudworth, however, it is usually played as a joke. An example of this is the occasion of Mr B crying when Scudworth sent him to the kitchen. Voiced by Christopher Miller.  The Shadowy Figure  The Secret Board of Shadowy Figures is a ruthless and secretive government organization who employs Principal Scudworth and is sponsored by Puma. They appear as a parody of the CIA, Secret Service, NSA and Area 51. They were responsible for the creation of the clones in the mid-80's. Their ultimate aim is to use the clones for a super army. The organization consists primarily of aged white male agents. Its chief director is referred to as The Shadowy Figure (voiced by Bill Lawrence). He is aware of Scudworth's craziness and incompetence in running Clone High. Though for the most part, he has shown amnesty as he gave Scudworth numerous times to redeem himself. He finally decides to kill Scudworth and takes the clones away for experimentation after discovering his video tape of his plot to betray the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures and create \\"Cloney Island\\". He also secretly hired many celebrities to spy on the clones and Scudworth. He may be lactose intolerant. They all wear blue paramilitary uniforms complete with ribbon bars and in the Episode Two they are seen wearing Pumas sneakers.  Supporting characters   Clone High students  * Julius Caesar: Caesar is a good friend of JFK. He is shown to be one of the popular students at Clone High and is very friendly. He speaks in a very old aristocratic and theatrical manner. From one of the quotes on the 2003 MTV website he implies that he is in a relationship with Catherine: \\"By my troth, Catherine the Great, thou hast playéd with mine heart of stone, and yay, I hath returned but not my pyre\\" and the two are often seen together. He is also a fan of Laurence Olivier. He always wears a laurel wreath on his head. He appears to have an indifferent personality as shown in Litter Kills Literally as he nonchalantly ate popcorn at Poncey's funeral and did not appear to mourn about his death like the other characters nor did he get shocked after JFK had a mental breakdown at the funeral, instead he appeared to be entertained. His catchphraise was originally to be \\"Veni, vidi, booyah!\\". He is voiced by Neil Flynn. * Catherine the Great: a blonde classmate who speaks with a Valley girl dialect. She is best friends with Cleopatra and is one of the popular students. She is implied to be in a relationship with Julius Caesar as they are often together.

He is a skateboarder with very long curly hair and wears a baseball cap that covers his eyes. * Buddy Holly: He plays in a band called Black Box along with Stevie Ray Vaughan and Ritchie Valens (who along with the real Holly, also died in plane crashes). He was originally supposed to a recurring character but only appeared in Plane Crazy in which he offers to let Abe ride in a poorly constructed biplane held together by duct tape along with Vaughan, Valens and half of Lynyrd Skynyrd. He is voiced by Neil Flynn. * Sigmund Freud: He seems able to read people's subconsciences. He appears in Film Fest in which he is the only one who is able to see Joan's love for Abe in her film entry albeit he mocks her for it. According to an article JFK wrote for the school newspaper The Tatler, he tells JFK that he was repressed because he had two father figures and no mother to subconsciously lust after. * Napoleon Bonaparte: Member of Clone High Basketball Team and an assistant manager at T.G.I. Chili's restaurant chain when Abe and Gandhi get after-school jobs. Abe notes that he has somekind of complex. * Ponce de León: referred to as \\"Poncey\\" is a combined parody of Fonzie, Dylan McKay and James Dean. He only appears in the episode Litter Kills Literally alive but makes a cameo in the series finale as a ghost. He was JFK's best friend until they got into an argument. He was violently killed by a freak accident involving litter, where a juice box stabs him in the throat and a plastic bag gets caught on his head, causing him to drown in his own blood. (The juice box may be an allusion to the real Ponce de León's death, who died of a poison dart.) He was very popular and well liked by the other students and he also appeared as optimistic and philosophical which JFK mocked about him. He makes another appearance in that episode as ghost but was likely that was only a hallucination conceived by the grief-stricken JFK. He was voiced by Luke Perry.

Wally is the African-American effeminate partner and Carl is the Caucasian butch partner. They are voiced by Donald Faison and Neil Flynn respectively. * Cleo's drunk foster mom: Cleo's (and formerly Gandhi's) unnamed adoptive mother. She is a lazy, slurring alcoholic being unemployed and lives off disability checks. She tends to be abusive towards her daughter both physically and verbally. She once threw make-up at Cleo when she ran out of liquor. Her hostility towards Cleo is stemmed from her own jealously as Cleo is everything she is not, being young, popular and attractive. She is in a relationship with Toots and the two are into S&M; as it is seen in A Room For One's Clone. It is likely her last name is Smith as that is Cleo's surname and it is said by Gandhi that she was married at one point because he said Cleo convinced her parents to disown him. She will proposition Abe at one point whenever he tries to visit or contact Cleo. She is voiced by Nicole Sullivan. * Gandhi's parents: Gandhi's adopted mother and father are a stereotypical Jewish couple. They want Gandhi to excel in school.

He is a giant dated computer grading machine but with arms and legs and a face. Unlike Mr. Butlertron, Scangrade is very primitive as he was manufactured in the 1950s (he has to be plugged into the wall just to operate). He appears in Sleep of Faith and though Mr. Butlertron destroyed him at the end of that episode, Scangrade appears in Changes in which he is covered with tape as a repair. He is powered by the PXJTs. He refers to everyone as \\"infidels\\". He is voiced by Judah Miller. * President Dog: A cute, little stray puppy who is the student body president of Clone High. He randomly appears at the end of the Episode Two in the heat of the class election between Abe Lincoln and JFK, all the students immediately but unintentionally voted him as their class president because of his cuteness and Cleopatra even tried to seduce him. Cleo somewhat takes ownership of him and she constantly dotes on him. He was one of the reasons why JFK and Cleo broke up as JFK was annoyed by Cleo putting herself and the dog before him. * Cop: a police officer who makes random appearances in the series notably in episodes Escape from Beer Mountain, Sleep of Faith, Film Fest and Litter Kills Literally. He is voiced by Andy Dick. * Peanie: an anthropomorphic peanut with a monocle, eyes, arms and legs. He was created by George Washington Carver.

He makes a cameo appearance in Litter Kills Literally hidden among a group of animals that JFK calls to clean up litter. * Glenn the Janitor: Is the janitor who works at Clone High. He is also the adopted father of Ponce de León. His appearance is based on the Janitor from the TV series Scrubs (which is also produced by Bill Lawrence). In connection to Clone High, in a season 8 episode of Scrubs it was revealed that the Janitor's real name was Glenn Matthews. He is voiced by Neil Flynn, who was famous for playing the Janitor on Scrubs.  Reception  Clone High is praised for its high character development and strong voice acting. Charles Soloman of the LA Times wrote that, \\"Will Forte's ingenuous Abraham Lincoln and Nicole Sullivan's resigned Joan of Arc steal the show.\\"  References  Clone High Clone High Category:Depictions of people on television ","title":"List of Clone High characters"},{"id":"4282353","text":"KYCK (97.1 FM, \\"97 KYCK\\") is a radio station broadcasting a country format.

The encoding technology grew out of earlier work on the PHP Accelerator project, and at first launch included an online encoding service where PHP scripts can be uploaded and an encoded version downloaded in return, and a command line tool for Linux soon after. The tools use the technique of compiling to bytecode prior to encoding so that source code is eliminated, and runtime overheads are reduced. A PHP extension called the ionCube Loader handles the reading and execution of encoded files at run time. Unlike CPU's such as 8086, where compiled code from many years ago continues to run on its derivatives today, the virtual machine instruction set of PHP has changed over time. The ionCube Loader uses the technique of on the fly patching of compiled code in memory to achieve back compatibility of running older files on newer versions of PHP. The encoding products were subsequently ported to FreeBSD, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X, and the range of products expanded to offer additional features such as product licensing and encryption of non-PHP files. In July 2004 a Windows GUI was introduced, no longer requiring use of the command line for Windows users. In 2004, ionCube introduced their Package Foundry product, IPF, for Linux and Windows. IPF allows web applications to be packaged as a Windows executable installer that can automatically deploy a web application to a remote server, as well as performing various installation and configuration tasks, and launching the browser on the main page of the installed application. ionCube also produce a product called the Bundler. Unrelated to PHP, the Bundler is a Windows and Linux tool to produce self-extracting archives for Windows. In December 2010 ionCube released version 7.0 of their Encoder, including support for the PHP 5.3 language. In May 2013 ionCube released version 8.0 with support for encoding the PHP 5.4 language. This was followed by an 8.1 release in October 2013 with changes including an updated GUI, enhanced security and a feature to assist selecting optimal security settings. February 2014 saw the release of Encoder 8.2 with some new features, and most notably a GUI for OS X users. As of April 18, 2014, Encoder 8.3 was released with support for encoding PHP 5.5 language features. In May 2015 ionCube released version 9 with support for PHP 5.6 language syntax and new security features such as decrypting compiled code using algorithmically runtime generated rather than static keys, followed by version 10 with support for PHP 7.1 in August 2017.  ionCube24  In Q1 2015, ionCube introduced a service called ionCube24 offering realtime malware protection for PHP websites. ionCube24 uses the ionCube Loader to monitor and block any unexpected PHP code, as might be introduced by a software vulnerability exploit, before it executes. Alongside the security aspect of ionCube24, it also provides realtime PHP and Javascript error reporting, along with server monitoring from various regions including Asia, North America and Europe.  Conferences  ionCube was invited to talk about their EPIK community project and Minecraft with NetBeans JavaOne in San Francisco October 2014. In December 2014, ionCube presented a talk at the 2014 Google Developers Group DevFest conference in Istanbul, Turkey, about how websites can be hacked and how this can be prevented, featuring a live proof of concept demonstration with an emergency light and car alarm triggered when a website intrusion was detected.  EPIK  In February 2012, ionCube launched an initiative called EPIK, aimed at Encouraging Programming In Kids for people aged 16 to 24 through a programming competition, with winners sharing part of a £1000 prize fund and having the opportunity of an IT apprenticeship. In February 2013 the ionCube EPIK initiative was expanded, and ran a three-day coding event for young developers with age ranges from under 10 to their early 20s. Most participants had no prior experience of coding or web technologies, and with support of industry mentors from ionCube and elsewhere, teams at three regional sites in Kent conceived and developed a range of website projects over two days. Teams came together for a third day of coding at the Turner Contemporary gallery before making final presentations of their projects, mostly with live websites. Judges from ionCube and Sony awarded various prizes, including Raspberry Pi and related hardware, a future presentation to the British Computer Society, and further one-to-one industry mentoring. Subsequent events have included a Minecraft 3D printing day in May 2013, a B9Creator 3D printer build day, and events in conjunction with Mozilla.  Involvement with Young Rewired State  On August 6 to 10 2012, ionCube hosted a week-long hackathon in Kent, South East England, as part of the Young Rewired State 2012 Festival of Code event for encouraging self-motivated young programmers. Attendees were aged from 9 to 18, and with the guidance of mentors and the remit to use some Open data, devised and produced a website called radiosight.com.

Leptomycin B was found to cause cell elongation of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Since then this elongation effect has been used for the bioassay of leptomycin. However, recent data shows that leptomycin causes G1 cell cycle arrest in mammalian cells and is a potent anti-tumor agent against murine experimental tumors in combination therapy. Leptomycin B has been shown to be a potent and specific nuclear export inhibitor in human and the fission yeast S. pombe. Leptomycin B alkylates and inhibits CRM1 (chromosomal region maintenance)/exportin 1 (), a protein required for nuclear export of proteins containing a nuclear export sequence (NES), by glycosylating a cysteine residue (cysteine 529 in S. pombe). In addition to antifungal and antibacterial activities, leptomycin B blocks the cell cycle and is a potent anti-tumor agent. At low nM concentrations, leptomycin B blocks the nuclear export of many proteins including HIV-1 Rev, MAPK/ERK, and NF-κB/IκB, and it inhibits the inactivation of p53. Leptomycin B also inhibits the export and translation of many RNAs, including COX-2 and c-Fos mRNAs, by inhibiting export of ribonucleoproteins. Leptomycin A (LPA) was discovered together with LMB.

It is somewhat based on the fairy tale The King of the Golden River, by John Ruskin. Plot right Scrooge McDuck is on the verge of a nervous breakdown due to the dry climate causing the banknotes in his Money Bin to shrink, resulting in the overall money level inside the bin decreasing. This makes him feel poorer and begins to act more and more like a miser. At this point, Donald Duck and his nephews arrive and ask him for a donation to help fund a club for children. Scrooge throws them away to the streets (through a concealed scaffold), and rebuts further attempts from Donald to get the donation by exposing Scrooge as a tightwad. However, when his three nephews learn from Scrooge's staff the real reason of his bad mood, they try to solve his problem by suggesting to him to blow hot air into the money pile. Scrooge gladly accepts the suggestion and states that he will give them the donation if their plan works out. Unfortunately, too much air is blown, causing the Money Bin to crack open. Scrooge collapses after hearing about the repair expenses (and an untimely comment about the promised donation) and is forced by his doctor to go on vacations. Next, the ducks find themselves in a remote cabin in a valley, close to a small waterfall, where Scrooge is supposed to relax under the watch of his nephews. One of the ducklings starts reading to him The King of the Golden River, which Scrooge scorns as an alienating fairy tale, stating that only hard work brings fortune (one of his main beliefs), not fantastic beings. As an example, he tells them that when he was young, he used to collect firewood so he could sell it to rich people at exorbitant prices. Suddenly, the nearby waterfall seems to have turned into a gold flow (like in the fairy tale). However, when the ducks reach it, they realize it's just plain water. Scrooge again turns grumpy and returns to the cabin, whilst the ducks decide to investigate further. Donald and his nephews climb to the top of the waterfall where they find a hot spring by the shore, which issues not only hot water but also gold powder into the stream, which caused the \\"golden waterfall\\" effect. As they cannot claim the gold for themselves (as the whole area is owned by Scrooge), they instead learn how to control it and decide to use this artifice to obtain a donation from Scrooge. Using a hollow log as a megaphone to amplify their voices, they convince Scrooge that a magic gnome controls the golden flow, and that Scrooge must be generous to the needy in order to deserve the gold. Scrooge, completely convinced, starts looking for strangers to be generous with, only finding a disguised Donald asking for the sum equivalent to the promised donation. Several funny situations follow, including a flow of frogs down the waterfall into a hopeful Scrooge holding a pan, when the ducks are unable to open the gold flow into the stream. While the ducks realize they might have rendered the hot spring useless by their attempts to control it and lose their hope to swindle Scrooge, he quietly reflects that his attempts on generosity were not sincere but a \\"bribe\\" to the gnome in order to obtain profit from the golden river. He then sees one of the ducklings catching firewood (just like he used to do as a child), and touched by this scene he runs to him and states to the stunned duck family that he will build the club himself, instead of just donating a small sum. At this moment, to the surprise of all (but Scrooge) the waterfall starts to pour gold again. As the nephews race into it with pans, trying to explain Scrooge about the physics of the phenomenon, he calmly states that he believes (opposite to his former cynic and logic behavior) the gold stream to be controlled by the Gnome King, who will keep it flowing as long as he is generous to children. Analysis Barks borrows elements from a fairy tale or folklore tradition and \\"explains\\" them in semi-scientific terms. However, the way he tells his story, mixing together elements as slapstick humour (situations like the scaffold flush into the floor of Scrooge's office, used by him to throw people back to the street); the fairy tale morale from The King of the Golden River, first scorned by the \\"rationalization\\" of the golden river phenomenon, but at the end ratified by nature; and the change in mind observed in Scrooge at the end, results in a masterpiece of comic book art. When Scrooge tells his nephews to stop gathering firewood, because he (and his family) has had enough of child labour (his own, of course, once a poor young boy) it is really moving, and it can be seen that Bark's characters are in fact people drawn as ducks, just like Art Spiegelman's mice, a modern version of fables.

It is a non-extant text, traditionally believed to have been compiled and taught in the First Sangam, by Agatiar (Agastya) to twelve students. Sage Agattiyar (Agastya), in medieval commentaries of Tamil Hindu scholars, is variously credited with either creating the Tamil language or learning it from the god Siva. In contrast, according to medieval era Tamil Buddhist scholars, the sage learned Tamil from Avalokita. These legends are mentioned in Akitti Jataka and in Tamil Buddhist epics. There is no direct mention of the sage, or Agattiyam text, in Tolkappiyam or the bardic poetry of the Sangam literature. Tolkappiyar (epithet), the author of Tolkappiyam, which is the oldest extant Tamil grammar, is believed by various traditions to be one of the twelve disciples of Agattiyar. Tolkappiyar is believed to have lived during the Second Sangam and to be the author of the Tolkappiyam that has survived. The context of the Agattiyam is in the sangam legend. Sangam literally means \\"gathering, meeting, fraternity, academy\\". According to David Shulman – a scholar of Tamil language and literature, the Tamil tradition believes that the Sangam literature arose in distant antiquity over three periods, each stretching over many millennia. The first has roots in the Hindu deity Shiva, his son Murugan, Kubera as well as 545 sages including the famed Rigvedic poet Agastya. The first academy, states the legend, extended over 4 millennia and was located far to the south of modern city of Madurai, a location later \\"swallowed up by the sea\\", states Shulman. The second academy, also chaired by a very long-lived Agastya, was near the eastern seaside Kapāṭapuram and lasted three millennia. This was swallowed by floods. From the second Sangam, states the legend, the Akattiyam and the Tolkāppiyam survived and guided the third Sangam scholars. Agastya convened this session and wrote Agattiyam. Agastya is one of the seven revered rishi of the Vedic literature, mentioned in the Rigveda.  Surviving verses  A few verses from Agattiyam have been quoted in medieval commentaries. However, the authenticity of these verses is uncertain.

The paintings, Childhood, Youth, Manhood, and Old Age, depict a voyager who travels in a boat on a river through the mid-19th-century American wilderness. In each painting the voyager rides the boat on the River of Life accompanied by a guardian angel. The landscape, each reflecting one of the four seasons of the year, plays a major role in conveying the story. With each installment the boat's direction of travel is reversed from the previous picture. In childhood, the infant glides from a dark cave into a rich, green landscape. As a youth, the boy takes control of the boat and aims for a shining castle in the sky. In manhood, the adult relies on prayer and religious faith to sustain him through rough waters and a threatening landscape. Finally, the man becomes old and the angel guides him to heaven across the waters of eternity.  Background  Thomas Cole is regarded as the founder of the Hudson River School, an American art movement that flourished in the mid-19th century and was concerned with the realistic and detailed portrayal of nature but with a strong influence from Romanticism.Encyclopædia Britannica Retrieved December 15, 2010 This group of American landscape painters worked between about 1825 and 1870 and shared a sense of national pride as well as an interest in celebrating the unique natural beauty found in the United States. The wild, untamed nature found in America was viewed as its special character; Europe had ancient ruins, but America had the uncharted wilderness. As Cole's friend William Cullen Bryant sermonized in verse, so Cole sermonized in paint. Both men saw nature as God's work and as a refuge from the ugly materialism of cities. Cole clearly intended The Voyage of Life to be a didactic, moralizing series of paintings using the landscape as an allegory for religious faith. Unlike Cole's first major series, The Course of Empire, which focused on the stages of civilization as a whole, The Voyage of Life series is a more personal, Christian allegory that interprets visually the journey of man through four stages of life: infancy, youth, manhood and old age. Done on commission, the finished works generated a disagreement with the owner about a public exhibition. In 1842, when Cole was in Rome, he did a second set of the series which on his return to America was shown to acclaim. The first set is at the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute in Utica, New York, and the second set is at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.  Works  Cole's renowned four-part series traces the journey of an archetypal hero along the \\"River of Life.\\" Confidently assuming control of his destiny and oblivious to the dangers that await him, the voyager boldly strives to reach an aerial castle, emblematic of the daydreams of \\"Youth\\" and its aspirations for glory and fame. As the traveler approaches his goal, the ever more turbulent stream deviates from its course and relentlessly carries him toward the next picture in the series, where nature's fury, evil demons, and self-doubt will threaten his very existence. Only prayer, Cole suggests, can save the voyager from a dark and tragic fate. From the innocence of childhood, to the flush of youthful overconfidence, through the trials and tribulations of middle age, to the hero's triumphant salvation, The Voyage of Life seems intrinsically linked to the Christian doctrine of death and resurrection. Cole's intrepid voyager also may be read as a personification of America, itself at an adolescent stage of development. The artist may have been issuing a dire warning to those caught up in the feverish quest for Manifest Destiny: that unbridled westward expansion and industrialization would have tragic consequences for both man and the land itself.  Childhood  In the first painting, Childhood, all the important story elements of the series are introduced: the voyager, the angel, the river, and the expressive landscape. An infant is safely ensconced in a boat guided by an angel. The landscape is lush; everything is calm and basking in warm sunshine, reflecting the innocence and joy of childhood. The boat glides out of a dark, craggy cave which Cole himself described as \\"emblematic of our earthly origin, and the mysterious Past.\\" The river is smooth and narrow, symbolizing the sheltered experience of childhood. The figurehead on the prow holds an hourglass representing time. Detail of Thomas Cole's The Voyage of Life: Childhood: The boat, child, and angel on the water.  Youth  The second painting, Youth, shows the same rich, green landscape, but here the view widens as does the voyager's experience. Now the youth grabs the tiller firmly as the angel watches and waves from the shore, allowing him to take control. The boy's enthusiasm and energy is evident in his forward-thrusting pose and billowing clothes. In the distance, a ghostly castle hovers in the sky, a white and shimmering beacon that represents the ambitions and dreams of man. Detail of Thomas Cole's The Voyage of Life: Youth: shows the boy departing in the boat; the angel bids him farewell from the shore. To the youth, the calm river seems to lead straight to the castle, but at the far right of the painting one can just glimpse the river as it becomes rough, choppy, and full of rocks. Cole comments on the landscape and the youth's ambitions: \\"The scenery of the picture—its clear stream, its lofty trees, its towering mountains, its unbounded distance, and transparent atmosphere—figure forth the romantic beauty of youthful imaginings, when the mind elevates the Mean and Common into the Magnificent, before experience teaches what is the Real.\\"  Manhood  The third in the series, Manhood, shows the now-grown boy amid the tribulations of adult life. Storm clouds darken the sky. The wind whips at the man's clothing, and rain falls in the background. The river has become rocky and rapid, running through a treacherous defile marked by a gnarled, leafless tree. Gentler country lies at the bottom of the defile and the sky lightens in that direction, hinting of better times ahead. Amid the dangers, the man has not lost his faith: he has let go of his boat's tiller (which may have broken) to lift both arms in prayer. Behind him, unseen, the guardian angel continues to watch over him through a break in the clouds.  Old Age  The final painting, Old Age, is an image of death. The man has grown old; he has survived the trials of life. The waters have calmed; the river flows into the waters of eternity. The figurehead and hourglass are missing from the battered boat; the withered old voyager has reached the end of earthly time. In the distance, an angel is descending from heaven, while the guardian angel hovers close, gesturing toward the other. The man is once again joyous with the knowledge that faith has sustained him through life. The landscape is practically gone, just a few rough rocks represent the edge of the earthly world, and dark water stretches onward. Cole describes the scene: \\"The chains of corporeal existence are falling away; and already the mind has glimpses of Immortal Life.\\" Detail of Thomas Cole's The Voyage of Life: Old Age: The man in the boat with the angel.  Cultural significance  The Voyage of Life was well received by critics and the public; the United States was experiencing the religious revival sometimes known as the Second Great Awakening. The four paintings were converted to engravings by James Smillie (1807–1885) after Cole's death and the engravings widely distributed in time for the Third Great Awakening, giving the series the prestige and popular acclaim it retains today.

Patin was doyen (or dean) of the Faculty of Medicine in Paris (1650–1652) and professor in the Collège de France starting in 1655. His scientific and medical works are not considered particularly enlightened by modern medical scholars (he has sometimes been compared to the doctors in the works of Molière). He is most well known today for his extensive correspondence: his style was light and playful (he has been compared to early 17th century philosophical libertines), and his letters are an important document for historians of medicine.

Dinkins Municipal Building (originally the Municipal Building and later known as the Manhattan Municipal Building) is a 40-story, building at 1 Centre Street in Manhattan, near Centre Street's intersection with Chambers Street in New York City. The structure was built to accommodate increased governmental space demands after the 1898 consolidation of the city's five boroughs. Construction began in 1909 and continued through 1914 at a total cost of $12 million (). Designed by McKim, Mead & White, the Manhattan Municipal Building was among the last buildings erected as part of the City Beautiful movement in New York. Its architectural style has been characterized as Roman Imperial, Italian Renaissance, French Renaissance, or Beaux-Arts. The Municipal Building is one of the largest governmental buildings in the world, with about of office space. The base incorporates a subway station, while the top includes the gilded Civic Fame statue. The Municipal Building was erected after three previous competitions to build a single municipal building for New York City's government had failed. In 1907, the city's Commissioner of Bridges held a competition to design the building in conjunction with a subway and trolley terminal at the Brooklyn Bridge, of which McKim, Mead & White's plan was selected. The first offices in the Municipal Building were occupied by 1913. In later years, it received several renovations, including elevator replacements in the 1930s and restorations in the mid-1970s and the late 1980s. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building a landmark in 1966, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Site The Manhattan Municipal Building occupies the site bounded on this map by Chambers Street, Duane Street, and Park Row. The Manhattan Municipal Building is located on the eastern side of Centre Street, in the Civic Center of Manhattan. It occupies the length of two city blocks, between Duane Street to the north and the Brooklyn Bridge ramps to the south; the west–east Chambers Street has its eastern terminus at Centre Street, at the center of the building's base. Near the Municipal Building are the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse and St. Andrew Church to the northeast; 1 Police Plaza and the Metropolitan Correctional Center to the east; Surrogate's Courthouse and Tweed Courthouse to the west; and New York City Hall to the southwest. Prior to the Municipal Building's construction, several streets passed through the building site, which had been located at the south end of the Five Points neighborhood. New Chambers Street continued east through the center of the building, while the west-east Reade Street continued eastward through what is now the building's northern edge. City Hall Place (now Cardinal Hayes Place) originated at the intersection of Chambers and Centre Streets, crossing southwest–northeast through the building site. The area to the south of the Municipal Building was once known as Tryon Row, a one-block east–west street between Centre Street and Park Row. The Municipal Building's site was occupied by buildings including the old headquarters of the New Yorker Staats-Zeitung. Immediately to the south were two elevated railway stations: the Park Row Terminal of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (closed 1944) and the City Hall station of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (closed 1953). After the Municipal Building was finished, New Chambers Street ran through the building's central archway. Park Row bounded the building to the southeast and Duane Street abutted it to the northeast. Park Row was rerouted in the mid-20th century, and New Chambers and Duane Streets were closed in 1971 as part of 1 Police Plaza's construction. The Streets subsequently became part of a pedestrian plaza surrounding the Municipal Building and 1 Police Plaza. Design The Municipal Building is tall. It is one of the largest governmental buildings in the world, with about of interior space and 2,000 employees. Of this, about is used for offices. William M. Kendall of the architectural firm McKim, Mead & White designed the Municipal Building. Two of the firm's other partners, Burt L. Fenner and Teunis J. van der Bent, were tasked with leading construction, while the city's Department of Bridges supervised the project. Alexander Johnson was chief engineer, Purdy and Henderson were consulting engineers, and the Thompson–Starrett Company was the general contractor. The Mount Waldo Construction Company provided the granite, while Robert Wetherill & Co. installed the original elevators. The foundations were dug by the Foundation Company. Enormously influential in the civic construction of other American cities, the building's architectural style has been \\"variously described as Roman Imperial, Italian Renaissance, French Renaissance, or Beaux-Arts.\\" Its construction marked the end of the City Beautiful movement in New York. The Municipal Building was the first of several ornately-designed civic office buildings, influencing other structures such as the Terminal Tower in Cleveland, the Fisher Building in Detroit, the Wrigley Building in Chicago, and the Helmsley Building in Midtown Manhattan.  Form  Seen from below The building is shaped like a ten-sided \\"C\\", although the lot that it occupies is an irregular hexagon. The main facade, along Centre Street to the west, is long while the eastern facade is long. The building has a width of , measured from west to east. The northeastern and southeastern sides accommodated the diagonal paths of Duane Street and Park Row, respectively. The floors' north–south axes are longer than their west–east axes; the wings of the \\"C\\" face west. This floor plan ensured that all of the building's windows would be able to receive direct sunlight and eliminated the need for an interior courtyard, which could not be lit by sunlight. The Manhattan Municipal Building is 34 stories tall; the main structure consists of 26 stories, and a tower rises eight additional stories above the center of the structure. The main cornice is above ground level while the tower rises to above ground level. Including the Civic Fame statue, the building stands at either or . Atop the northern and southern wings of the \\"C\\" are pavilion roofs, which are connected to the central tower with roof decks and a stone cornice. The central tower is composed of a two-story square section; atop this is a circular section flanked by four circular turrets above each corner of the square. The circular section of the central tower is composed of two layers: an enclosed space surrounded by columns, atop which is a smaller peristyle. The Municipal Building was the first in New York City to incorporate a subway station, the Chambers Street station, below its base. The approved building plans in 1909 also called for three basement levels within the volume not occupied by the subway station.  Facade  The building consists of 25 bays on its western and eastern facades (counting the eastern facade as being composed of the northeastern, southeastern and eastern elevations) and three bays on its northern and southern facades. Each bay contains either one or two windows on each story. The facade is made of ashlar granite, except for the details above the 23rd floor, which are made of terracotta. A three-story-tall colonnade of Corinthian columns runs across the base along Centre Street, with the rest of the building set back behind the colonnade. At the top of the colonnade is a carved entablature. There is also a false colonnade on the facade above the 22nd floor. The 1939 WPA Guide to New York City stated that the facade \\"gains dignity through the bold treatment of the intermediate stories, despite the poorly related tower and the disturbing character of the Corinthian colonnade at the base\\".  Features  = Base = A large arched vault is located at the center of the building's base, at the eastern end of Chambers Street, and is flanked by two smaller arched vaults. It is designed in the neoclassical style like the Arch of Constantine. The vault was large enough to accommodate New Chambers Street, which was closed in 1971 to make way for a pedestrian plaza in front of One Police Plaza and the Manhattan Municipal Building. The terracotta vault was modeled on the entrance of the Palazzo Farnese in Rome, and was also called the \\"Gate of the City\\" after William Jean Beauley painted an image of the scene. The vault separates the lobby into two sections, each with its own set of elevator banks. The second through fifth stories are also divided into two portions by the vault. As constructed, the first floor was devoted entirely to public space, with two open loggias and the two portions of the lobby. The loggia under the southern wing still exists, with staircases leading to the subway from both the north and south. It is supported by a set of columns and has a ceiling of white Guastavino tiles. The loggia under the northern wing is no longer extant, having been enclosed. The Chambers Street subway station, served by the , consists of two levels below the building: the mezzanine (shared with the Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall station, served by the ) and the platform level. The station opened in 1913, and was intended as the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company's main subway terminal in Manhattan, but fell into disrepair after businesses moved uptown in the 1930s. When the Municipal Building was completed, there were also supposed to be new station buildings for the adjacent elevated IRT and BRT stations, designed in the same architectural style. The tracks from the Chambers Street station would have also connected directly to the elevated tracks on the Brooklyn Bridge, but the connection was never opened. = Structural features = While the layer of bedrock under the Municipal Building was quite close to the surface underneath the southern part of the building, the bedrock dropped to a depth of about under the northern portion of the site, where it would be extremely difficult to dig caissons. A layer of sand was present to a depth of , while the average depth of the bedrock under the building was about . The contract for the foundations was the largest to be awarded for a single building in the United States, with being excavated at a cost of $1.5 million. The foundations incorporated of concrete for the piers, as well as 70,000 barrels of cement. The foundations also included 125 caissons extending to an average depth of . The maximum depth of the caissons was below grade, and for the northern part of the site, the Foundation Company built larger caissons resting on sand at a depth of . While the caissons under the southern two-thirds of the building carry , the larger caissons under the northern third of the building carry only . The Municipal Building's frame had of steel, which required 20 derricks to erect. The superstructure weighed a total of . The above-ground walls, and half of the beams in the superstructure, were carried by steel-plate girders at the first floor. The girders were connected to other steel beams, which distributed the building's entire weight to the caissons. Each of the first- floor girders were about deep and grouped in sets of two or three. The Municipal Building's largest girders, supporting the Chambers Street arch, were long and up to deep. = Interior = The floors were arranged so that the elevator banks and stairs were on the eastern side of the building, while the offices were concentrated along the western side and on the north and south wings. There were four staircase shafts that extended the height of the building. In addition, 33 elevators were provided in the initial construction, though this number was later expanded to 37. Of the original elevators, 32 were accessible from the lobby. Most of the elevators from the lobby traveled only to the 25th story, where a separate elevator connected the 25th through 37th floors. During the 1934 elevator replacements, eight of the elevator shafts were shortened to make way for office space. Because the basement is mostly taken up by the subway station, the mechanical equipment is located on the fourth floor. The elevators were controlled by a dispatching room on the 26th floor. A typical story had of net office space. The materials in the Municipal Building included of hollow-tile partitions, of cement flooring, of asphalt flooring in the vaults, of plastering, and of Yule marble. Other types of marble, such as Tennessee marble, were used for decorative elements such as the baseboards of the rooms. Steel was painted to resemble wood, while wooden elements were only used for door and window frames. Most of the floors are made of cement, but the fifth floor, originally used for public hearings and the municipal reference library, had of cork flooring to reduce noise. History  Previous plans  By the late 19th century, New York City governmental functions had outgrown New York City Hall. At the time, the city government's agencies rented space in various buildings from Downtown Manhattan up to Midtown Manhattan, with the number of such arrangements increasing by the year. In the 1884 annual report of the City of New York, mayor Franklin Edson declared that more space was urgently needed for governmental functions. He also noted that City Hall's \\"style of architecture was such that without marring its present symmetry, it couldn't be enlarged to the required extent.\\" Edson suggested buying 280 Broadway, at the corner with Chambers Street, for use by the city government. The government, desiring to cut down the amount of rent paid to private landlords, ultimately held four design competitions for a new, massive building that would be suitable to house many agencies under one roof. As early as 1885, a commission was empowered to look for plots of land where such a structure could be built, and by 1887, authorities were considering erecting a structure adjacent to City Hall itself, in City Hall Park. Mayor Abram Hewitt appointed a commission to study suitable plans and plots of land in 1888, although Hewitt opposed putting such a building anywhere except City Hall Park. The commissioners of the Sinking Fund initially approved a municipal building east of the Tweed Courthouse, at the park's northeastern corner. An architectural design competition was commenced for this new building, and seven architects submitted plans. The public generally opposed the idea of development in the park, and the plan was voted down by the New York State Senate in February 1890. The law authorizing the new building was modified in 1890 so that the new structure would be able to house other city agencies as well. Mayor Hugh J. Grant proposed a large municipal office building in early 1890, and that July, a committee of the city government was created to look for alternate sites. The committee published a report in October 1890, outlining three possible sites on Chambers Street. The first option was southwest of Chambers Street and Broadway; the second, northwest of Chambers and Centre Streets; and the third, northeast of Chambers and Centre Streets (at the current building's location). The committee recommended the third option, which would be the cheapest and offer the most floor area, as well as provide an opportunity for redevelopment at that location. However, the city government decided in March 1893 that the municipal building would instead replace City Hall, with two wings extending north to flank the Tweed Courthouse, despite the committee's recommendation and public objections to a City Hall site. By September 1893, the committee had received 134 plans for such a new building, a number that was eventually reduced to six. In response to opposition to City Hall's demolition, the New York governor signed a law in 1894 that once again prohibited the municipal building's construction, although the six finalist submissions received monetary prizes. In 1899, architect George B. Post proposed a municipal office tower to be built at the northeast corner of Chambers and Centre Streets, while preserving City Hall. The next March, state senator Patrick H. McCarren proposed a bill that would construct the municipal building on the blocks bounded by Broadway and Reade, Centre, and Chambers Streets, north of the Tweed Courthouse and west of the current building's site. The structure would replace 280 Broadway and the old Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank Building, incorporate the then-under-construction Hall of Records, and would also entail destroying the Tweed Courthouse. Several architects submitted proposals, the most elaborate of which was by McKim, Mead & White. Additionally, in July 1903, George Post and Henry Hornbostel proposed a 45-story office tower with a campanile at Chambers and Centre Streets, as part of a wider-ranging proposal for the Civic Center. All plans for a municipal building, along with a planned trolley hub at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge just east of City Hall, was deferred by the administration of mayor Seth Low when he left office at the end of 1903.  Planning and construction  = Planning = By early 1907, the Hall of Records had been completed, but there was still not enough space for the city's important files; further, the city was paying large amounts for rent in private buildings. Officials pointed out that the cramped quarters of the city government's departments posed a fire hazard, and legislation had been proposed for a new municipal building. In July 1907, the Commissioner of Bridges—which had already secured a new plot of land to be used for a new trolley hub on the Manhattan side of the Brooklyn Bridge—was authorized by the state legislature to host a fourth and final design competition for the municipal building. The Brooklyn loop line, a four-track subway line, was planned to be built under the site as well, passing through a large five- platform station at Chambers Street. Thirteen architects were invited to compete, and they would in turn elect a jury of three architects, whose names would not be published in advance. The Commissioner of Bridges would make a final decision based on the jury's recommendation. The plans had to meet several criteria: the building had to be at least 20 stories; the superstructure could not block train tracks, stairways, or platforms; the route of Chambers Street under the building had to be preserved; and the first floor, to be used for transit and building entrances, had to be completely covered, with a ceiling of at least . The commissioner also recommended that the first story of each level be at ground level, and that an above-ground level be provided for mechanical equipment and building systems. The contestants were otherwise given \\"considerable freedom\\" for the building's design. By December 1907, several architects had submitted plans. Twelve architectural firms ultimately entered the competition, while Cass Gilbert withdrew. The jury selected McKim, Mead & White's proposal as the winning entry in April 1908. The firm's design had been chosen because it provided the most space for the city government, even though it was less elaborate than some of the other submissions, such as the runner-up proposal by Howells & Stokes, inspired by 90 West Street. McKim, Mead & White had entered the contest under the encouragement of mayor George B. McClellan Jr., and William Mitchell Kendall was the principal architect named in the submission.Willis, Carol. \\"Municipal Building\\" in The firm submitted plans for a building to the New York City Department of Buildings in October 1908. The city had initially intended to erect the Manhattan Municipal Building on a plot immediately to the south of the current site, bounded by Park Row, the Brooklyn Bridge, and North William Street. The accepted plan, however, called for the building to be located between Park Row, Centre Street, and Duane Street, with Chambers Street running under the Municipal Building's center. = Construction = By late 1908, the site was being cleared. Bids for foundation work were opened in December 1908, with the contract being awarded to the J. H. Gray Company. However, the original building plans were rejected by the city's buildings superintendent the same month because he felt that the underlying layer of soil and sand was not strong enough to carry the building. This resulted in delays in the construction of the proposed Brooklyn loop line under the building. Ultimately, the Foundation Company was contracted to dig the foundation with caissons under a very high air pressure of . Work was done in 20 shifts of five men working for forty minutes each day; only two workers developed decompression sickness and neither of them died. In a January 1909 speech, McClellan praised the project as \\"one of the most important projects the City has ever undertaken\\". At the time, he predicted that the building would cost $8 million. Work on the Municipal Building officially started on July 17, 1909. One observer predicted that the building's construction would result in an increase in real-estate values, similar to what the Flatiron Building had done for the Flatiron District. Foundation work was completed in October 1909, and revised building plans were approved by the Board of Estimate that November. Bids for the construction of the superstructure were opened on December 21, but an injunction against the awarding of the contract was placed less than an hour after the bidding process started, after a lawsuit was filed over the fireproofing material that was supposed to be used in the building. Furthermore, the presence of the sand posed issues for the superstructure, though McClellan said that he believed it was safe to build on sand. The building's cornerstone was laid a week later, and the injunction was reversed. Unlike at other projects, the groundbreaking ceremony was private, and the cornerstone only had the year \\"1907\\" inscribed in Roman numerals. During construction in 1911, a fire broke out on the 25th floor; at the time, it was the highest fire to date that the New York City Fire Department had fought. In another construction incident, three workers were buried when temporary bracing in the foundation collapsed, though all survived. Steel frame construction took place between June 1910 and July 1911, followed by the installation of exterior walls between March 1911 and November 1912. There were delays in installing the granite facade because the original materials were found to be inferior. By 1913, the superstructure was topped out with the unveiling of Civic Pride at the top of the Municipal Building's tower.  Use  = 1910s and 1920s = The first sections of the Municipal Building were occupied in mid-1913. The building had not been ready at the beginning of the year, forcing some city departments to renew the leases at their existing quarters. Mayor John Purroy Mitchel, after taking office in 1914, criticized the usage of space in the Municipal Building as \\"wasteful\\". Some of the city departments that were scheduled to move into the building had found space elsewhere, and other city departments had been allotted less space in the building than in their previous quarters. Two years later, the New York City Board of Estimate commenced an investigation into office vacancies at the Municipal Building, after the New York Public Service Commission leased floors in other buildings. The building had cost $12 million (), which was not repaid with interest until 1964; the interest was more than twice the original cost. The land alone had cost $6 million. Nevertheless, the structure was expected to save the city from paying $800,000 a year in rent. Upon opening, the Municipal Building housed 4,200 city employees. It was patrolled by a private police force, which monitored the building 24 hours a day, as well as a cleaning crew of 135 people. There were also telephone switchboards for inter- departmental communication, which at the time of completion were described as state-of-the-art. A nonprofit organization established a cafeteria on the 26th floor in 1918; although the city provided no subsidies to the cafeteria, the cafeteria also did not have to pay rent. Radio station WNYC (AM) started broadcasting from the 24th floor in 1924, remaining there for 85 years, and a small hospital was established on the third floor in 1929. The Municipal Building's size notwithstanding, various entities had proposed to build an even larger municipal skyscraper to the west by the 1930s, but with no success. = 1930s to 1950s = Cupola detail By 1934, Manhattan borough president Samuel Levy called the elevators \\"unsafe\\", given that all of the elevators needed twice-daily inspections, and their manufacturer had gone out of business soon after installing them. The city had to make its own replacement parts for the elevators, which had been described as \\"old and wheezy\\", and acting like \\"Coney Island roller coasters\\", and fourteen of the elevators had to be taken out of service in late 1934. All of the elevators were replaced between 1935 and 1937, under a project funded partially with a $1.8 million grant from the Works Progress Administration. While the elevators were being replaced, city employees in the building worked in three staggered shifts. The elevator project also shortened several elevator shafts: within the north and south wings, some of the shafts above the 14th floor were removed to make way for office space. Civic Fame at the top of the Municipal Building was also refurbished during the 1930s, and green mercury vapor bulbs were also installed in the north lobby. By 1939, the building could not accommodate all of the city government's agencies, several of which were located in alternate quarters surrounding Foley Square to the north. The offices in the Municipal Building included radio station WNYC on the 25th floor, the Municipal Reference Library on the 22nd floor, and the Marriage Chapel on the 2nd floor. In 1949, the city's commissioner of public works announced that four floors would be renovated and modernized in the first phase of a planned multi-stage overhaul. The next year, the city began installing a dial-telephone system at the Municipal Building, replacing the fourteen old telephone switchboards. At the time, the 20 city agencies in the building had a collective 1,264 telephones. The new switchboards were activated in 1951, and every line in the Municipal Building was given the same 10-digit phone number with 1,426 four-digit extensions. = 1960s to present = The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building a landmark in 1966, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. In 1974, Wank Adams Slavin was hired to undertake a $24 million renovation of the building's interior. As part of the renovation, corridors were narrowed and partitions between offices were removed to create more office space; vinyl floor tiles and recessed lighting were installed; and the outdated plumbing system was replaced. The project increased interior capacity to 6,500 employees. During this time, Civic Fame was also renovated. The building had been cleaned by 1975 at a cost of $300,000, though more funds for the renovation had also been appropriated. A piece of granite fell from the Municipal Building in 1987, landing on a ramp on the Brooklyn Bridge, although no one was injured. However, a subsequent investigation found other loose rocks on the facade, and as a result, netting was placed on the facade. In 1988, workers began placing scaffolding along the building's entire facade in preparation for the first large-scale restoration of the facade, which was to begin the next year. The renovation was expected to cost $58 million and required of steel tubes to support the massive scaffolds. The facade restoration was undertaken by the architects Wank Adams Slavin. Another restoration of Civic Fame took place during this time. On October 14, 2015, the building was renamed after David N. Dinkins, New York City's first African-American mayor. Art The building features various types of sculpture and relief. These include the large gilded Civic Fame statue at the top of the building; smaller sculptural groups; and plaques and coats-of-arms representing the various governments that have ruled Manhattan. Civic Fame The gilded statue of Civic Fame at the top At the top of the Municipal Building is Civic Fame, a statue installed in March 1913. The statue is a gilded copper figure, made from about 500 pieces of hammered copper executed by the Manhattan firm of Broschart & Braun. The statue is variously reported to be supported on an iron skeleton and made over a steel frame. Civic Fame has been variously described as the largest or second-largest statue in Manhattan, depending on whether the larger Statue of Liberty is considered as being in Manhattan. It is similar in style to the Statue of Liberty. The statue was designed by Adolph Alexander Weinman (1870–1952). It was commissioned by New York City at a cost of $9,000 () to celebrate the consolidation of the five boroughs into the City of New York. The figure—described as \\"graceful and unusually charming\\"—is barefoot and balances upon a globe. She carries various symbolic items: a shield bearing the New York City coat of arms, a branch of leaves, and a mural crown, which she holds aloft. The mural crown has five crenellations or turrets, which evoke city walls and represent the five boroughs. The crown also includes dolphins as a symbol of \\"New York's maritime setting\\". Audrey Munson posed for the figure; she had also posed for a very large number of other important allegorical Beaux-Arts sculptures in New York, including those at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, New York Public Library Main Branch, Manhattan Bridge Colonnade, and USS Maine National Monument at Columbus Circle. The left arm was repaired in 1928 after cracks were detected on that side. After Civic Fame's left arm broke off, fell through a skylight, and landed on the 26th- floor cafeteria in February 1935, the statue was renovated, with metal rods being used to hold up the left arm. The sculpture was refurbished and re- gilded starting in July 1974 at a cost of $294,500, as part of the interior renovations of the Municipal Building; the restoration was completed by the end of the year. In early 1991, while the facade was undergoing renovations, Civic Fame was removed for six months and re-gilded in a New Jersey metalwork shop at a cost of $900,000. Civic Fame was placed back on the roof in October 1991 using a helicopter. Other ornamentation In addition to Civic Fame, Weinman sculpted the rectangular allegorical bas-relief panels at the base of the building, which are located above the side arches. Civic Duty, above the smaller arch to the right (south) of the center arch, shows a female representation of the city alongside a child holding the city seal. Civic Pride, above the smaller arch to the left (north), depicted the city as a woman \\"receiving tribute from her citizens\\". There are heroic-scaled winged figures above the spandrels of the side arches: Guidance, a depiction of a female on the left arch, and Executive Power, a depiction of a male on the right arch. These are respectively topped by medallions representing Progress, a nude kneeling man with a torch in one hand and a winged sphere in the other, and Prudence, a half-nude kneeling woman holding a mirror while a serpent is curled around her right arm. Shields relating to Manhattan's historical and current governance were also designed for the facade above the ground-story colonnade, 22nd-floor false colonnade, and elevators. The shields represent the historical New Amsterdam and the Province of New York, as well as the present-day county, city, and state of New York (the county of New York being coextensive with the borough of Manhattan).

The Office of the City Clerk was formerly housed in the Municipal Building; about 16,000 weddings were performed annually at the former Manhattan Marriage Bureau in the Municipal Building, in civil ceremonies lasting about four minutes. The City Clerk's Office relocated to nearby 141 Worth Street in 2009.  Incidents  Numerous accidents have occurred at the Municipal Building. In 1921, an elevator overturned, killing its two occupants. A pile of coal stored in bunkers underneath the building caught fire in 1942, and a 2005 fire slightly injured six firefighters. Additionally, a flood on the fourth floor in 1959 destroyed brand-new machinery that processed the pay checks for the building's workers. In popular culture The Manhattan Municipal Building appears in several films, such as a key scene of the 1996 film One Fine Day, in which Jack Taylor (George Clooney) spots Manny Feldstein (Joe Grifasi) and chases him to the roof. In \\"Crocodile\\" Dundee (1986), muggers inside the Municipal Building entrance to the subway station pull a knife on the title character (Paul Hogan) and his girlfriend Sue (Linda Kozlowski). In The Professional (1994), antagonist Stansfield, played by actor Gary Oldman, works for the DEA at the building, in office 1402. Additionally, the music video for the song Not Afraid, rapper Eminem is depicted standing on the edge of the building's roof in multiple shots.

The river drains a large section of southeast Illinois, with a drainage basin of . The major tributaries include the South Fork, Middle Fork and North Fork, all lying within the Saline Valley. The once meandering swampy river was important among Native Americans and early settlers as a source of salt from numerous salt springs where it was commercially extracted in the early 19th century. History From 1807 to 1818, Illinois paid the United States Treasury $28,160.25 in revenue. During the same time, Ohio paid $240 and Indiana, Kentucky and Missouri paid nothing. One third of the State of Illinois revenue came from the salt industry coming from African American slaves working on the Saline River in 1818. The last concessionaire of the Saline Springs was John Crenshaw, then owner of what became known as the Old Slave House.http://www.shawneetourism.com/history.html During the late 18th century, the river had heavy barge traffic. It was navigable for keel boats and batteaux for inland from the mouth at the Ohio River. The farthest point west that could still accommodate flat boats and barges is the largest city on the river Harrisburg, Illinois, but the river has not been used for navigation in almost a century. It is today used mainly as an oversized drainage ditch of little interest except for flood control. Bidding for straightening and dredging began in 1930.https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17049365/saline_river_work/ On June 18, 1888, an act of January 25, 1849, declaring the Saline River to be navigable, was repealed by the Illinois General Assembly. The river was deemed \\"impractical\\" for navigation due to the \\"anxiousness\\" of County residents to build bridges across it. Watershed The main stem of the Saline River is long and drains . The river is formed by the confluence of the South Fork and the Middle Fork east of Harrisburg. The South Fork is long and rises in northern Johnson County within the Lake of Egypt reservoir.

History The station began life at 99.3 FM as KOSN in Thief River Falls, Minnesota in 1976. KOSN broadcast only 3,000 watts. The station changed call letters to KSNR in 1983 as it flipped to an oldies format, concentrating on 50s and 60s \\"Golden Oldies\\" format. After upgrading to 100,000 watts at 100.3 FM in 1987, the station attracted listeners in Grand Forks, North Dakota, since the signal could be heard on most radios and KSNR was the only oldies station in the area. former Kool 100.3 logo KSNR later became \\"Kool 100.3\\", and began playing 1970s era music, and moved its studios to Grand Forks after being sold. KSNR also played Christmas music from Thanksgiving Day to Christmas Day annually until the format change in 2005. In 2000, Clear Channel Communications bought out KSNR and several other stations, and the format was changed to play 1960s and 1970s era music. It also became the flagship station for University of North Dakota basketball play-by-play broadcasts. former Cat Country logo from 2005-2016 Kool 100.3 switched to country music as \\"Cat Country\\" in October, 2005, competing with Leighton Broadcasting's heritage country station, 97 KYCK and classic country station KNOX-FM \\"Rooster 94.7\\". In 2006, co-owned classic hits (a mixture of oldies and classic rock formats) station KQHT \\"96.1 The Fox\\" began shifting towards to an oldies format. In 2005, KSNR changed its city of license from Thief River Falls to Fisher, which would allow it to move its transmitter tower closer to Grand Forks in the future. In the fall of 2012, all local personalities were removed from Cat Country in favor of Bobby Bones Show in the morning and Premium Choice radio personalities in all other dayparts. The previous local morning show was moved to sister station KQHT (96.1 The Fox), which carries an updated classic hits version of the former \\"Kool 100.3\\" oldies format. In 2016, Cat Country brought back some local personalities previously heard on the station. On October 29, 2018, it was announced that, as iHeartMedia will lose its grandfathered ownership limits in the Brunswick and Grand Forks markets as part of its bankruptcy restructuring, the company would place KSNR and WHFX into the newly formed Sun & Snow Station Trust, under the oversight of former Backyard Broadcasting CEO Barry Drake, as preparation for an eventual sale of the signals.iHeartMedia Moves Divestiture Trusts To New Trustee; Adds Two Stations References External links *100.3 Cat Country website * *UND Fighting Sioux game broadcast info SNR Category:Country radio stations in the United States Category:1976 establishments in Minnesota Category:Radio stations established in 1976 ","title":"KSNR"},{"id":"4282535","text":"Here is a list of important Persian figures in the Sassanid Empire (226-651) : Queen Purandokht, the last woman on the throne of the Sassanid dynasty, 630. *Mani the prophet : Founder of Manichaeism. *Mazdak : Proto-socialist philosopher and founder of Mazdakism. *Bozorgmehr : Physician and minister of Khosrau I. *Purandokht (Boran) : Sassanid queen. *Barbod the Great : Court musician of the king Khosrau II who created the first musical system in the Middle East, known as the Royal Khosravani and dedicated to the king himself. *Nagisa (Nakisa) : The court musician who collaborated with Barbod on his famous septet piece the Royal Khosravani. *Sarkash : Though not as renowned as Barbod or Nakisa, he was a remarkable musician. *Rostam Farrokhzād : The last great general of Sassanids.

It was gifted by Sir Henry Wigram for the Canterbury (NZ) Aviation Company on 20 September 1916 and originally named Sockburn Airport. In 1923 that was then gifted to the Crown as a Royal New Zealand Air Force base. Charles Kingsford-Smith made the first Trans-Tasman flight from Sydney to Wigram on 10 September 1928. Sir Henry Wigram continued to support the base, gifting a further 81 acres of land in 1932. But aircraft got bigger and needed longer and eventually tarsealed runways. The Crown added to the original size of the airfield and that addition was land belonging to Ngāi Tahu. That just includes where the Control Tower currently still stands. RNZAF Wigram was home to the Central Flying School, Pilot Training Squadron, Navigation Training and recruit training. In 1953 RNZAF Wigram was the scene of the worst RNZAF crash in New Zealand when two RNZAF De Havilland Devon collided coming in to land and seven men were killed. In the 1990s, the government wanted to rationalise their military property and a decision was made to either close Wigram or RNZAF Woodbourne near Blenheim. Despite having just been renovated at great expense, it was decide to close Wigram. The aircraft and squadrons moved to RNZAF Ohakea and recruit training went to Woodbourne. The closing parade was held on 14 September 1995. Wigram Aerodrome maintained its aviation character, with several aviation businesses using its facilities. These included Pionair Private Aircharter, Christchurch Parachute School and Christchurch Flying School. Three Air Training Corps units, and a Cadet Corps unit also presently occupy buildings within the aerodrome. Christchurch's Air Force Museum of New Zealand is located at the northern side of the aerodrome. It houses a large collection of aircraft and interactive displays, and is the only museum of the RNZAF in New Zealand. Wigram Airfield Circuit was a temporary motor racing circuit at the Wigram Airfield. The temporary motor racing circuit was long Wigram Airfield Circuit at Tasman-Series.com and considered as the oldest motor race circuit in New Zealand since it had been racing in 1949.MotorRacing-MinorCircuits at Encyclopedia of New Zealand The RNZAF still own the original gifted part of the airfield and it is now the home of the Air Force Museum and Historic Flight. But the majority of the airfield, control tower, hangars and new fire station was returned to Ngāi Tahu Property as part of a treaty settlement claim. The fire station became the home of the civilian fire service until 2018. Since 2008 the Ngāi Tahu land has become the suburb of Wigram Skies. Closure On 9 July 2008 Television 3 News broadcast a news item (video) stating that Ngāi Tahu, the owners of the aerodrome (acquired as part of a treaty settlement claim) are to close Wigram Aerodrome by February 2009. Wigram airfield officially ceased operation as an airfield at 00:00 Sunday 1 March 2009 NZ Local time. After the Christchurch earthquakes of February 2011 which resulted in much of the Central Business District being off limits due to earthquake damage with office buildings largely damaged, destroyed, or inaccessible, Ngāi Tahu moved its offices to the Wigram site using a mix of prefabricated relocatable buildings, and a refurbished Control Tower building to house most of its staff until a permanent long term solution could be found. Housing development In late 2009, Ngāi Tahu Property began redeveloping the Wigram aerodrome site as a new housing development. Named Wigram Skies, the development proposes 1600 residential sections, a shopping centre, and an industrial area in the east adjoining the existing industrial area. The aerodrome's old sealed runway forms the development's main street, aptly named The Runway, with other street names having an aviation, flight or sky theme. The historic control tower and hangars remain as they are heritage protected buildings.

It features an object in the shape of a turtle that can be given commands to move around the screen drawing shapes, creating animations, and playing games. The program's use of Logo is part of a large set of dialects and implementations created by Seymour Papert aimed at triggering the development of abstract ideas by children through experimentation. MicroWorlds is developed by Logo Computer Systems Inc. (LCSI) and released for Windows and Mac computers. Release History The precursors to MicroWorlds were the programs Apple Logo, Atari Logo, and LogoWriter released by LCSI for the Macintosh, Atari 8-bit family, and IBM Personal Computer in the 1980s. The first version to bear the MicroWorlds name was released in 1993 for DOS and Mac called MicroWorlds Project Builder. Two modules were released to accompany the software called \\"Math Links\\" and \\"Language Arts.\\" MicroWorlds 2.0 was released in 1996 for Windows 95 and in 1998 for Mac. Modules for weather and plants were released in 1997, as well as an internet browser plugin to view projects in Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator without the full software installed. Spanish and Portuguese editions were released under the name MicroMundos. MicroWorlds Pro, an advanced version intended for high school students, was released in 1999 for Windows 95/98/NT and in 2000 for Mac. MicroWorlds EX, the current iteration of the software, was released in 2003 for Windows 98 and up (currently supported for Windows 7 and up), and in 2004 for Mac OS X. A “Robotics edition” was released for both platforms that worked with Lego RCX programmable bricks and the Handy Cricket microcontroller system. An \\"Exploring Math\\" module intended for Grades 4-7 was released in 2005 and a \\"Computer Science\\" module released in 2013. The program has been made available in French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Portuguese, Italian, Armenian, and Greek. MicroWorlds EX will not work with macOS 10.15 or higher due to requiring 32-bit support. MicroWorlds JR, a derivative product teaching coding to young children who cannot read, was released in 2004 for Windows XP and 2005 for Mac OS X. Features MicroWorlds relies on Logo, a computer programing language based on words and syntax that are intended to be easy to learn and remember. The software is able to execute multiple tasks independently, can import pictures, and create multimedia projects like games and simulations. Users write code in a dialect of the Logo programing language to move a customizable cursor (initially in the shape of a turtle), draw shapes, or to make dialog boxes appear. The user may write code in one of two areas of the program, using the program's \\"command module\\" to execute short commands immediately or the \\"procedure page\\" for more complex sets of instructions that can be stored and referenced at any time. Reception MicroWorlds is used as the main component of the curriculum used by OpenWorld Learning, an educational non-profit based in Denver, Colorado, that as of 2016 operated 11 elementary sites and three middle school sites in the Denver area. The organization provides a free after-school program to students interested in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education.

He was associated with the literary side of the Young America movement in New York.Duberman, Martin. James Russell Lowell. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1966: 50. Biography He was born on November 23, 1816, in New York City to Evert Duyckinck, a publisher.Nelson, Randy F. The Almanac of American Letters. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 48. Evert the younger graduated from Columbia College, where he was a member of the Philolexian Society, in 1835. He then studied law with John Anthon, and was admitted to the bar in 1837. He spent the next year in Europe. Before he went abroad he wrote articles on the poet George Crabbe, the works of George Herbert, and Oliver Goldsmith, for the New York Review.Delbanco, Andrew: Melville, His World and Work. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005: 93. In 1840 he started a monthly magazine with Cornelius Mathews called Arcturus, which ran until 1842. The New York Tribune commented on the important partnership by referring to Duyckinck and Mathews as \\"the Castor and Pollux of Literature—the Gemini of the literary Zodiac\\".Widmer, Edward L. Young America: Flowering of Democracy in New York City. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999: 110. Duyckinck wrote articles on other authors while at home and in Europe. Between 1844 and 1846, Evert became the literary editor of John L. O'Sullivan's The United States Magazine and Democratic Review, which moved from Washington D.C. to New York in 1840. On April 22, 1840 in Connecticut he married Margaret Wolfe Panton, and they had as their children: Evert Augustus Duyckinck II, George Duyckinck, and Henry Duyckinck (1843-1870). All of his children died when they were young. In the years 1845-46 he edited the book series \\"The Library of Choice Reading\\" and \\"The Library of American Books\\" for the Wiley & Putnam publishing house.Peter Booth Wiley and Frances Chaves, eds., John Wiley & Sons: Two Hundred Years of Publishing: An Exhibition at the Grolier Club of New York, New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., pp. 19-22. Retrieved 26 May 2018. In 1845, he assisted Edgar Allan Poe in printing his Tales collection and selected which stories to include. The collection was a critical success, though Poe was somewhat disappointed by Duyckinck's choices.Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001: 75. In 1847 he became the editor of The Literary World, a weekly review of books written with his brother George Long Duyckinck until 1853. The two brothers became the unofficial leaders of the New York literary scene in the 1840s into the 1850s. In 1854 the brothers were again united in the preparation of The Cyclopaedia of American Literature (2 vols., New York, 1855; enlarged eds., 1865 and 1875). He published Wit and Wisdom of Sydney Smith, with a memoir (New York, 1856); an American edition of Willroot's Poets of the Nineteenth Century (1858). Immediately after the death of Washington Irving, Duyckinck gathered together and published in one volume a collection of anecdotes and traits of the author, under the title of Irvingiana (1859); History of the War for the Union (3 vols., 1861'5); Memorials of John Allan (1864); Poems relating to the American Revolution, with Memoirs of the Authors (1865); Poems of Philip Freneau, with notes and a memoir (1865); National Gallery of Eminent Americans (2 vols., 1866); History of the World from the Earliest Period to the Present Time (4 vols., 1870); and an extensive series of Biographies of Eminent Men and Women of Europe and America (2 vols., 1873'4). His last literary work was the preparation, with William Cullen Bryant, of an edition of William Shakespeare. He died on August 13, 1878 in New York City, New York. Letter to Lincoln On 18 February 1865, author Duyckinck sent President Abraham Lincoln a letter. Duyckinck signed the letter “Asmodeus”, with his initials below his pseudonym. His letter enclosed a newspaper clipping about an inappropriate joke allegedly told by Lincoln at the Hampton Roads Peace Conference. The purpose of Duyckinck’s letter was to advise Lincoln of “an important omission” about the history of the conference. He advised that the newspaper clipping be added to the “Archives of the Nation”.Duyckinck, Evert A. \\"Evert A.

Legacy and criticism Letter from Nathaniel Hawthorne to Duyckinck regarding Melville In January 1879, a meeting in his memory was held by the New York historical society, and a biographical sketch of Duyckinck was read by William Allen Butler. Herman Melville, a close friend of Duyckinck's with whom he corresponded often, refers in his book Mardi (1849) to Duyckinck's highbrow magazine Arcturus by naming a ship in the book Arcturion. Referring to it as \\"exceedingly dull\\", the author notes the low literary level of its crew. Duyckinck also garnered a mention in James Russell Lowell's A Fable for Critics (1848) with the lines, \\"Good-day, Mr. Duyckinck, I am happy to meet / With a scholar so ripe and a critic so neat\\".Widmer, Edward L. Young America: Flowering of Democracy in New York City. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999: 109. Charles Frederick Briggs noted Duyckinck's ability in the \\"art of puffing\\", heavy praise for works that did not necessarily merit it.Delbanco, Andrew: Melville, His World and Work. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005: 94. Edwin Percy Whipple chidingly called Duyckinck \\"the most Bostonian of New- Yorkers\\". William Allen Butler noted that his taste in literature was too high for most readers: \\"While Duyckinck was the most genial of companions, and the most impartial of critics, he was too much of a recluse, buried in his books, almost solitary in life, and entirely removed from the circle of worldly and fashionable life\\".

Containing original music composed and conducted by Jeff Beal, the 36-track album contains tracks from various first-season episodes, a special extended arrangement of the original theme, and one composition written and recorded, but ultimately not contained in an episode. The disc plays for 53:25.  Track listing  Jeff Beal's official website contains a self-proclaimed \\"obsessively compulsively detailed list\\" identifying each track's episode and context. This list is reproduced below, albeit with some spelling and typo corrections. # \\"Monk Theme\\" (extended version — this is special to the CD) This version features some solo takes Grant played on the theme when we were recording the original (pilot) version, and extra elements from the \\"Monk\\" musical palette — vibes, pizzicato strings and some drums. 02:34 # \\"Miming Mr. Monk\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk Takes a Vacation\\"). This was for the end of the episode, where Tony does the whole \\"wrap up\\" in pantomime; a little \\"Monk\\" silent movie. The gag was a theme in the episode between Tony and his guest star Polly Draper. 01:34 # \\"They're Killing Dr. Gould\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk Goes to the Asylum\\") Monk and his fellow mental patients recreate the murder of Dr. Gould in the lounge of the asylum. 01:03 # \\"A Clean Apartment\\" (from Mr. Monk and the Earthquake) This was the last scene of the show, when Monk finally has a clean apartment again. This little jazz tune was first heard in the pilot episode, and was one of the tunes written for a main title theme (before the other one was chosen). 01:16 # \\"Finding The Pebble\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Psychic\\") Monk bolts outside from a reading meeting with Sharona and Dolly, patting himself down. He notices the pebbles in the driveway, which later become a very important clue. 00:58 # \\"Rejection\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk Goes to the Carnival\\"). Monk, hoping for reinstatement, is rejected by the review panel. 00:40 # \\"Trudy's Theme\\" (from various episodes). The sound of Trudy, first heard in the pilot episode, when Adrian goes over the crime photos in his apartment. 02:18 # \\"I Think I Smell Gas\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Candidate\\") This is the very first piece of music ever wrote for \\"Monk.\\" As Monk walks around a crime scene, brilliantly noticing details others miss, he also worries he forgot to turn the gas off back at his apartment. 01:49 # \\"Keys In The Casket\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Candidate\\") Monk drops his key ring into the casket at a funeral for the slain bodyguard. He fishes them out from the balcony with dental floss and a paperclip. 02:15 # \\"Lucky Guy\\" (from Mr. Monk and the Other Woman). This theme actually played twice in the show. Once for the opening scene of the murder in the office of the attorney, and also for the murder of Grayson in the garage of Monk's new flame and possible felon, Monica Waters. 01:30 # \\"Fat Suit Folly\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk Meets Dale the Whale\\"). This was the wrap-up music of the episode. Monk does the recap, while Disher rolls around in the fat suit, unable to get up! 01:43 # \\"Monk Visits The Garage\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Candidate\\") Monk goes back to the garage, looking for clues, which triggers a poignant recollection of Trudy's fate. 02:46 # \\"Counting Meters\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Candidate\\") Monk walks down a San Francisco street, counting parking meters, and is chased by mysterious car. Even in danger of his life, he still keeps count as best he can. 01:12 # \\"Monk Interrogates Gavin\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Candidate\\") Monk questions Gavin about his whereabouts the past few weeks. 01:13 # \\"Remember Me?\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Airplane\\"). Adrian gets up to visit with some of the passengers he suspects, and ends up getting locked inside the aircraft restroom! Claustrophobia and hilarity ensue. 03:05 # \\"There Was A Struggle\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Other Woman\\") Monk \\"reads\\" the murder scene at the Attorney's office. 01:43 # \\"Monk Theme\\"' (series version) This is the version most people will recognize from season one. The Emmy won for this was Monks first! 00:51 # \\"Have Fun\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk Goes to the Carnival\\") Monk and Sharona, trying to \\"blend in,\\" engage in various carnival activities. 01:05 # \\"Pebbles And Clues\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Other Woman\\") 01:05 # \\"Sharpening Pencils\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Red-Headed Stranger\\") While trying to interrogate Willie Nelson, Adrian becomes obsessed with properly sharpening his pencils. 00:48 # \\"Zen Monk\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Candidate\\") Monk \\"reads\\" the room from where the assassin shot the Mayor's bodyguard. This theme was used in many subsequent episodes. The musically inclined might notice the use of a whole tone scale, a deliberate musical homage to another Monk — Thelonius! 00:47 # \\"Monk's A Hero\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Candidate\\") Adrian emerges triumphantly and exhausted from the sewer. 00:56 # \\"Love These Sneaks\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Marathon Man\\") Monk proudly displays his new running shoes, a gift from the legendary marathon runner (and his idol) Tonday. 02:03 # \\"My Hero\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Other Woman\\") Adrian is smitten by the beautiful (and somewhat \\"Trudy-like\\") Monica Waters. 00:56 # \\"On The Beach\\" (a Monk mystery track) This little variation of the Monk Theme was written for the opening of the \\"Vacation\\" episode, but never used. 00:53 # \\"The Final Chase\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Candidate\\") Adrian and Sharona venture down into the sewers of San Francisco to catch the killer. 03:49 # \\"Start The Watch\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Marathon Man\\") Monk and Sharona try to recreate the steps (and timetable) of Trevor McDowell. 01:00 # \\"Losing It?\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk Goes to the Asylum\\") Monk becomes unglued. 00:33 # \\"Monk Escapes\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk Goes to the Asylum\\") Adrian escapes the \\"quiet room\\", eventually ending with a rooftop. 02:32 # \\"Worried Monk\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Billionaire Mugger\\") 01:09 # \\"Restaging The Murder\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Candidate\\") Adrian recreates the assassination of the bodyguard. This music was also used as the end title of the pilot. 01:48 # \\"Running Away\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Billionaire Mugger\\") Monk, Sharona and \\"Fraidy Cop\\" run away from Monk's former client (who has finally paid Monk for his services). 00:54 # \\"Finding, Looking\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk Takes A Vacation\\"). Adrian is sure the Maids are guilty, but he's running out of time. He and Sharona look for a clue. 01:07 # \\"Back Safe At Home\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk Goes to the Asylum\\"). Adrian says goodnight to Sharona on the phone — this time he's in the right apartment. 01:03 # \\"The Kiss\\" (from \\"Mr. Monk and the Other Woman\\") Monica kissed Adrian goodbye, and he doesn't even wipe it off for germs! 01:08 # \\"Monk Theme\\" (pilot version) 01:19  Credits  * Composer: Jeff Beal * Producer: Jeff Beal * Executive Producer: Robert Townson * Music Editors: Helena Lea (pilot) and Jeff Wolpert (series, season one) * Master: Erick Labson * \\"Monk Theme\\" performed by Grant Geissman (guitar) and Jeff Beal. * Recorded and Mixed by Jeff Beal at Many Rooms Music, California. * Special Thanks: Dean Parisot, Rob Thompson, Jackie de Crinis, Todd Sharp, Judith Marlan, Fern Field, Nancy Mullins, Helena Lea, Robert Messinger, Andy Breckman, David Hoberman and Tony Shalhoub. * Score published by USA Network, LLC/BMI.

Officially, NY 324 begins at NY 384 in Niagara Falls and overlaps Interstate 190 (I-190, the Niagara Section of the New York State Thruway) south to Grand Island, where it separates from I-190 and continues southward as Grand Island Boulevard. As signed, however, NY 324 begins at the southern end of the official overlap and is contained entirely within Erie County. At the southern edge of Grand Island, NY 324 joins I-190 to cross over to the mainland, where it runs due east across three towns before reaching its eastern end at a junction with NY 5 in the town of Clarence. NY 324 is known by two names along its routing: Grand Island Boulevard on Grand Island and Sheridan Drive in the northern suburbs of Buffalo. As the latter, the route serves as a major commercial strip for Tonawanda, Amherst, and Clarence. NY 324, assigned , is one of two routes to occupy part of Sheridan Drive; the other is New York State Route 325, which follows the westernmost of the street. NY 324 once extended northwest to downtown Niagara Falls; however, it was truncated to its current western terminus on January 1, 1962. Route description NY 324 eastbound approaching the junction with NY 325 in Tonawanda According to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), NY 324 begins at NY 384 in eastern Niagara Falls. NY 324 heads south, overlapping with I-190 (the Niagara Section of the New York State Thruway) across the North Grand Island Bridge to Grand Island, where it leaves the expressway at exit 20. However, as signed, NY 324 begins at the north end of Grand Island, where it splits off from the Interstate Highway as Grand Island Boulevard. South of exit 20, the official and signed routings are identical. Maintenance of the route is split between NYSDOT, the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA), and Erie County. All but the northernmost of the portion of the route that overlaps with I-190 is maintained by NYSTA. The two county-maintained sections extend from exit 20B to Grand Island Boulevard on Grand Island and from exit 15 to Grand Island Boulevard in Tonawanda, where NY 324 utilizes small portions of the county- owned Long Road and Kenmore Avenue, respectively. The remainder of NY 324 is maintained by NYSDOT. From I-190 exit 20, NY 324 runs in a more southeasterly direction, serving as the main commercial strip on Grand Island, before it overlaps I-190 in order to cross the Niagara River. It parts company with the Interstate Highway on the other side of the river at exit 15, where it turns north to parallel I-190 on Kenmore Avenue. After , it veers east onto Tonawanda's portion of Grand Island Boulevard for to a junction with Sheridan Drive. The latter carries NY 325, a route that begins at NY 266 on the banks of the Niagara and passes through a commercial and industrial area of the town of Tonawanda. NY 324 takes on the Sheridan Drive name here and assumes a more due easterly course across northern Erie County. Though the street is signed as a state highway on both NY 324 and NY 325, most residents simply refer to this road by its local name. NY 324 approaching NY 277 in Amherst Through much of this portion, the road is divided, with a tree-lined median strip. Businesses, both local and national, line both sides of the road and traffic is heavy. It crosses some other major strips such as Niagara Falls Boulevard (U.S. Route 62 or US 62), a major contributor to traffic on Sheridan due to the proximity of the Boulevard Mall, and Millersport Highway (NY 263), which feeds the Amherst campus of the University at Buffalo. In Amherst it meets the Youngmann Expressway (I-290) where NY 240 (Harlem Road), reaches its northern end. Past the Youngmann development abates, green returns to the roadside and the median ends, although the road remains four-lane and high-volume. There is another pocket of development around the Wegmans supermarket north of Williamsville, which has seen some rapid growth in the last few years. NY 324 crosses its last major route, Transit Road (NY 78), on an overpass just north of the once-thriving Eastern Hills Mall, which had been the premier mall in the Buffalo area until it began losing tenants and customers to the larger Walden Galleria in Cheektowaga. Beyond Transit, the road is still four-lane but primarily residential as it enters the Town of Clarence. After Harris Hill Road, the highway bends to the southeast once again for a final mile into its eastern end at Main Street (NY 5). This last section was widened from two lanes to four in the mid-1990s, and has seen some development but still remains lightly trafficked most of the day. History town of Tonawanda Sheridan Drive was constructed during the early 1920s as a town of Tonawanda project to help alleviate the anticipated growth of the village of Kenmore. Despite its construction, the new road was not without controversy. During construction, new traffic lights were put in with concrete supports were opposed heavily by the town of Tonawanda and its residents, resulting in the traffic lights not having been built for many years. The town also felt that the construction of a superhighway in the middle of the country in Tonawanda was unjustified with the average traffic in that area. After construction of Sheridan Drive was completed in 1925, a monument with a statue of General Phillip Sheridan was constructed to commemorate the new road. However, the taxpayers feeling enough money had already been spent on the road, the statue of Sheridan was never constructed and only the monument to the road's construction was completed. In order to give the road a new look, the road had large trees planted throughout what was considered a desolate area at the time. Due to an archaic law in Erie County, the town of Tonawanda and the town of Amherst, who completed the road in 1925, were requested in 1935 to take over $2 million (1935 USD) in debts bonded for its construction. The county noted that the towns' inability to pay for the road made the new road a financial burden for the county. To make things worse, the new road did not bring the immediate influx of business that was advertised and was looking early on as a giant mistake on the part of the county and towns. NY 324 eastbound in Amherst When NY 324 was assigned , it began at NY 384 (River Road; now NY 266) in the town of Tonawanda and followed Sheridan Drive eastward to NY 5 in the town of Clarence. By 1935, what is now NY 324 between Niagara Falls and Tonawanda via Grand Island was designated as NY 325. NY 324 was extended northward to NY 384 in Niagara Falls , supplanting the entirety of NY 325\\\\. The NY 325 designation was reassigned to the short piece of Sheridan Drive not designated as NY 324. The route was extended one final time by 1948 to follow NY 384 westward from the North Grand Island Bridge into downtown Niagara Falls. NY 324 remained unchanged until January 1, 1962, when the overlap with NY 384 was removed. Although the overlap with the new I-190 on the North Grand Island Bridge was also removed from maps during the same period, and is no longer signed, this overlap was never officially removed from either NYSDOT's description of the route or the annual NYSDOT Traffic Data Report.

Born in Adelaide, Russell made his senior football debut as a sixteen-year-old in 1981 for Port Adelaide Football Club in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), eventually becoming Port Adelaide's vice-captain, before crossing over to Victorian Football League (VFL) club Geelong in 1987. Russell played 50 games, kicking 51 goals for Geelong until he left the club at the end of the 1991 AFL season. Russell initially considered returning to Port Adelaide to finish his career but instead coached in country Victoria for a few years before retiring from football. Sports journalism Russell unsuccessfully applied for a journalism cadetship in Adelaide in 1984 before starting a journalism career in Geelong in 1989. Russell became a full-time sports journalist with The Age in 1997. Covering the major sporting events of Melbourne, Russell built up a serviceable record as the number four sports writer at The Age. Following this success he was moved full-time to the paper's coverage of the AFL in 1999, including a stint as the writer for The Sunday Age Sport section in the mid-2000s. He also joined 95.5 K-Rock in Geelong as Sports Presenter in their news updates in the \\"Big Mattress\\" breakfast show. Soon, he also co-hosted a sport/comedy segment called \\"On The Bench\\" with ex-Geelong player Billy Brownless and the Essendon fanatic \\"Ferret\\" (Russell Taylor), twice a week. A long list of Geelong players were included in \\"On The Bench\\" as special guests including Barry Stoneham, Tim McGrath and Paul Couch. Football commentary In 2002 Channel Nine gave Russell the main caller's role for Sunday afternoon AFL matches before being promoted to the network's calling team for Friday night matches in 2006. His other main occupation this time was as co-host of radio station 3AW's top- rating drive-time sports show, Sports Today with Gerard Healy, a role he departed in late 2019. After leaving the Nine Network, Russell received a contract with Fox Footy to call two weekly AFL matches for the Pay-TV provider for the 2007 AFL season and beyond, under the new AFL TV Rights Deal, of which Fox Footy has six matches weekly during the Home and Away season to cover. In 2012, Russell joined the Friday night 3AW football team while continuing to host Sports Today for the station. In 2019 Russell left 3AW to join SEN as host of its afternoon program and a football caller. Commentary in other sports Russell expanded his work with Fox Sports by becoming a basketball commentator in Fox's coverage of the 2009/10 National Basketball League (NBL) season. Additionally, he also provided commentary on Fox's coverage of the 2011 Australian Open tennis tournament.

It is what Deleuze calls an \\"image of thought\\", based on the botanical rhizome, that apprehends multiplicities. As a mode of knowledge and model for society Deleuze and Guattari use the terms \\"rhizome\\" and \\"rhizomatic\\" to describe theory and research that allows for multiple, non-hierarchical entry and exit points in data representation and interpretation. In A Thousand Plateaus, they oppose it to an arborescent (hierarchic, tree-like) conception of knowledge, which works with dualist categories and binary choices. A rhizome works with planar and trans-species connections, while an arborescent model works with vertical and linear connections. Their use of the \\"orchid and the wasp\\" is taken from the biological concept of mutualism, in which two different species interact together to form a multiplicity (i.e. a unity that is multiple in itself). Hybridization or horizontal gene transfer would also be good illustrations. \\"As a model for culture, the rhizome resists the organizational structure of the root-tree system which charts causality along chronological lines and looks for the original source of 'things' and looks towards the pinnacle or conclusion of those 'things.' A rhizome, on the other hand, is characterized by 'ceaselessly established connections between semiotic chains, organizations of power, and circumstances relative to the arts, sciences, and social struggles.' Rather than narrativize history and culture, the rhizome presents history and culture as a map or wide array of attractions and influences with no specific origin or genesis, for a 'rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo.' The planar movement of the rhizome resists chronology and organization, instead favoring a nomadic system of growth and propagation. \\"In this model, culture spreads like the surface of a body of water, spreading towards available spaces or trickling downwards towards new spaces through fissures and gaps, eroding what is in its way. The surface can be interrupted and moved, but these disturbances leave no trace, as the water is charged with pressure and potential to always seek its equilibrium, and thereby establish smooth space.\\"Rhizomes.net Principles Deleuze and Guattari introduce A Thousand Plateaus by outlining the concept of the rhizome (quoted from A Thousand Plateaus): *1 and 2. Principles of connection and heterogeneity: \\"...any point of a rhizome can be connected to any other, and must be\\"; *3. Principle of multiplicity: it is only when the multiple is effectively treated as a substantive, \\"multiplicity\\", that it ceases to have any relation to the One; *4. Principle of asignifying rupture: a rhizome may be broken, but it will start up again on one of its old lines, or on new lines; *5 and 6. Principle of cartography and decalcomania: a rhizome is not amenable to any structural or generative model; it is a \\"map and not a tracing\\".

It is licensed to Crookston, Minnesota, and it serves the Grand Forks, North Dakota metropolitan area. It began broadcasting in 1985. The station is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc.. KQHT also broadcasts University of North Dakota men's ice hockey and football games as the flagship station, while sister station KSNR broadcasts University of North Dakota men's and women's basketball home games, and sister station KKXL-AM broadcasts University of North Dakota women's ice hockey. Programming In addition to its music programming, the station broadcasts play-by-play coverage of University of North Dakota football and men's hockey games. History The station began life in 1985 as KLZC, and become KQHT in 1986. KQHT began as a Top 40 station in 1986 as \\"Magic 96\\" competing with XL93. In 1998 it changed to an adult contemporary format. It renamed itself \\"KQ96\\" in 1996, and \\"Mix 96.1\\" in 1998. In the late 1980s, the on-air talent included Ross Holland (Fast Eddie Fingers) Program Manager, Steve Gunner (future Program Manager), Rick Acker, Tim Burns, and Ron Phillips (The Iceman). During that early 1990s battle with KKXL, there were personalities like Magic Mark & Paul Braun, Josh Jones, Shelley Carr, \\"Smilin'\\" Wade Williams, \\"Jammin\\" Jay Murphy, Denny \\"Crash\\" Shields, Michael Knight (Mike Cruise), Pat Ebertz, Bobby Brady, Minimum Wage Mike, Harry Callahan, Kim Cooley, Jack Hammer, and Nick Logan. 96.1 The Fox logo from 2004-2015 In 2000, Clear Channel bought KQHT and several other radio stations in Grand Forks. KQHT changed its format to classic hits (a mixture of classic rock and oldies music formats) calling itself as \\"96.1 The Fox\\". Clear Channel also got a contract with the University of North Dakota to broadcast Fighting Sioux basketball, hockey, and football games. Hockey and football games are broadcast on KQHT while basketball games are aired on sister station KSNR 100.3. The slogan was changed from \\"Classic Hits\\" to \\"World Class Rock\\" in 2004, and programming evolved towards a broad-based classic rock format. The station began leaning towards an oldies format after KSNR changed from oldies to country in 2005.
