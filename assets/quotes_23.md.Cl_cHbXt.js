This exchange differs from the Global Exchange of Military Information in that it is limited to forces in Europe, while the Global Exchange of Military Information applies to all forces of the participating states, wherever located. The annual exchange of information was conducted concurrently with the annual exchange of information under the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, in Vienna, Austria in December of each year. The Vienna Document has been revised periodically, and the current version is the 2011 version. From 2014 onwards there have been fears that the Vienna Document is on the verge of becoming de facto defunct, as other arms control and security agreements continue to collapse due to the ongoing tensions in Eastern Europe.

Although there had been previous revolts during Sverre's reign following his usurpation of the throne in 1184, the revolt in support of Sigurd Magnusson (son of former king Magnus Erlingsson) became far more threatening than the attempts of previous pretenders. In a larger context, the battle was part of the century-long civil war era in Norway. As Sigurd was a minor, the actual leaders behind the revolt were Hallkjell Jonsson and Olav Jarlsmåg. The Eyjarskeggjars recruited their initial army in Orkney and Shetland (hence their name, meaning \\"island-men\\"), returned to Norway in 1193, and quickly took control over a large part of the country. Based in Bergen for the winter, the Eyjarskeggjar fleet relocated to the nearby bay of off Askøy in anticipation of the arrival of Sverre's Birkebeiner fleet from Niðaros (Trondheim). The battle began with a surprise attack by the Birkebeiners during night. Although the Eyjarskeggjars gained the upper hand for most of the battle and victory eventually seemed within reach, their ships were caught in a current during the final stages of the battle. This caused them to become easy prey for the Birkebeiner, who in the end won the battle decisively and extinguished the majority of the Eyjarskeggjar army, including their leaders.  Background  The main source for the battle, and the events leading up to it, is King Sverre's own Sverris saga. Sverre had usurped the throne from the previous king Magnus Erlingsson following the Birkebeiner victory at the Battle of Fimreite in 1184.Fossen (1999) pp. 65–66 In the years after this there were a succession of revolts started against Sverre, in support of various pretenders.Koht (1952) p. 98 Almost ten years after Sverre's usurpation, a revolt that would prove far more precarious for Sverre was started, based around Sigurd Magnusson, the only widely recognised son of Magnus Erlingsson. Since Sigurd was a minor, the group supporting his claim to the throne was led by Sigurd's guardian, lendmann Hallkjell Jonsson, along with Olav Jarlsmåg and Sigurd Jarlsson.Fossen (1999) p. 67 The saga also claims that Bishop Nicholas Arnesson was involved with the revolt, but this is disputed by modern historians.Lunden (1976) p. 43 Sigurd Magnusson was sent westwards to Norðreyjar in 1192, and gained the military support of the Jarl Harald Maddadsson who provided the rebels with a longship. Sigurd was proclaimed king of Norway in Orkney, and was permitted to recruit an army in Harald's realm. The army sailed to Viken (the south-eastern part of Norway) in 1193 with 23 ships and 2,000 men, and had Sigurd proclaimed king at the Haugating. This force was commonly called the Eyjarskeggjars, meaning the \\"island-men\\", although they themselves preferred to be called the Gullbeiner (\\"gold-legs\\"), as opposed to their opponents, the Birkebeiner (\\"birch-legs\\"). The Eyjarskeggjars sailed for a brief raid for booty in Denmark,Fossen (1999) p. 68 and after returning to Norway, they took control over the entire country south of Stad—thus most of Western, Southern and Eastern Norway. Sigurd and the Eyjarskeggjars took up their base in Bergen for the winter, although they failed to take the city castle Sverresborg which was defended by 300 loyal Birkebeiners. Not expecting a Birkebeiner attack until spring, the Eyjarskeggjar army was distributed across the country. The fleet was also divided up, with six ships stationed under Sigurd Jarlsson's command in Stavanger, and three in Sogn.  Battle  Eastwards-facing photo showing the isles around Florvåg, with the northern parts of Bergen in the background to the right. Florvåg and Askøy is separated from Bergen by Byfjorden. After hearing news of the Eyjarskeggjar offence, Sverre gathered his troops and sailed south from his base in Nidaros (Trondheim) with 20 ships. When Sverre was closing in on Bergen on 2 April, the Eyjas rskeggjarwent to their ships and sailed across Byfjorden to the bay of Florvåg, off the southeastern side of the island Askøy. Sverre arrived in the evening and left his fleet in Gravdal. After gaining intelligence of Eyjarskeggjar plans of a counter- attack, Sverre set out to surprise the Eyjarskeggjars with an attack before dawn.Fossen (1999) pp. 68–69 The Birkebeiner fleet approached Florvåg in early 3 April, Palm Sunday, while it was still dark. The Eyjarskeggjars did not know of the attack until they heard the noise from the Birkebeiner ships crushing into their own ships.Fossen (1999) pp. 69–70 As the Birkebeiner warriors guarded themselves with their shields, the Eyjarskeggjar found no targets to shoot at until the Birkebeiner finally charged at the Eyjarskeggjars. The Eyjarskeggjars had an advantage since their ships were taller than those of the Birkebeiner, and they managed to pull Sverre's own royal ship towards them, killing all the archers and capturing the royal banner Sigerflua.Fossen (1999) p. 70 After heavy losses on both sides, the Birkebeiner managed to shake off the Eyjarskeggjar fleet and started a retreat. The Eyjarskeggjars began chasing the Birkebeiner, but since their oars had been broken, the Eyjarskeggjar ships were suddenly dragged into a strong current, and the Birkebeiner fleet returned to attack the ships of the Eyjarskeggjars.Fossen (1999) p. 71 The Birkebeiner also gained reinforcements of a fresh ship with 100 men from Sverresborg, and easily defeated the Eyjarskeggjars, one ship at a time.Fossen (1999) p. 72 Only two Eyjarskeggjar ships managed to get away, and except for some men who requested pardoning, the majority of the Eyjarskeggjar forces were killed, including Sigurd Magnusson, Hallkjell Jonsson, and Olav Jarlsmåg.  Numbers  According to the saga, the Birkebeiner fleet consisted of 20 ships, plus a ship from Sverresborg that joined later on during the final stages of the battle. The Eyjarskeggjars had a numerically smaller fleet of 14 ships available during the battle, but compensated this by having ships that were larger in size. Historian Halvdan Koht estimated both fleets to carry total forces of approximately 2,000 men: this was later supported by historian Anders Bjarne Fossen.Fossen (1999) p. 73 Koht estimated the Eyjarskeggjar casualties at 1,000 men, but Fossen raised that number to 1,500. While harder to pinpoint, Fossen estimated the numbers of Birkebeiners killed in the battle at around 900–1,000 men.Fossen (1999) p. 74 These numbers makes the Battle of Florvåg possibly the deadliest naval battle fought in Norwegian history.  Aftermath  Sverre became the undisputed ruler of Norway after the victory at Florvåg, and was at the height of his power during the following years. On 29 June, Sverre had himself crowned in Bergen by the bishops in Norway, all except one installed by Sverre and thus loyal to his rule.Fossen (1999) p. 76 As the king was an excommunicated priest, his coronation was prohibited by the Catholic Church and served as the catalyst to a new struggle of his, this time with the Pope. The only bishop who opposed the coronation, in line with the Church's policy, was Nicholas Arnesson, whom Sverris saga accuses of being behind the Eyjarskeggjar revolt, a claim that is considered unsubstantiated by modern historians.Koht (1952) pp. 104–106 In 1195, after learning that Sverre planned to subdue Norðreyjar, Jarl Harald Maddadsson who had supported the Eyjarskeggjar revolt went as quickly as he could to meet Sverre in Bergen. He then pleaded his innocence and apologised to Sverre, claiming that he had not allowed the Eyjarskeggjars to raise an army in his realm. Sverre settled with Harald by asserting his overlordship and taxation rights over Norðreyjar, and permanently detaching Shetland from it; the Jarl, and the Jarl's successors, were to rule over Orkney (including Caithness) only.Koht (1952) pp. 102–103  Vinje runic inscriptions  Most of the Eyjarskeggjars who managed to escape fled to Denmark.Koht (1952) p. 101 Sigurd Jarlsson, a surviving Eyjarskeggjar leader, was in Bergen during the battle although he did not take part himself, and fled to Telemark when he received news of the defeat. The detour to Telemark before he later arrived in Denmark is known from two runic inscriptions that were discovered in the Vinje stave church when it was demolished in 1796, one of them having been written by Sigurd himself.Fossen (1999) p. 75 Sigurd Jarlsson's runic inscription in Vinje. Latin transliteration: : sigurþr ialssun ræist runar þesar lougar dagen eftir botolfs mæso er an flyþi higat ok uildi æigi gaga til sætar uiþ suærri foþur bana sin ok brøþraOlsen (1951) p. 266 Old Norse transcription: : Sigurðr Jarlssun reist runar þessar laugardaginn eptir Bótolfsmessu, er hann flýdi hingat ok vildi eigi ganga til sættar við Sverri, föðurbana sinn ok braðra. English translation: : Sigurd Jarlsson carved these runes the Saturday after Botulfs' Mass [17 June], as he had fled here and did not want to settle with Sverre, the bane of his father and brothers.

It is also used to grasp fascia and soft tissues such as breast or bowel tissue. Allis clamps can cause damage, so they are often used in tissue about to be removed. *When used to grasp the cervix to stabilize the uterus, such as when an intrauterine device is being inserted, an allis clamp has the advantage of causing less bleeding than the more commonly used tenaculum. Brief Biography of Oscar H. Allis Oscar Huntingdon Allis was born on 9 September 1838 in Holley, New York. He obtained his AB in 1864 and his MA in 1865 from Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. In 1866, he graduated from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia and took internship at Philadelphia General Hospital. In 1871, Allis became the original staff surgeon at Presbyterian Hospital of Philadelphia, now Penn Presbyterian Medical Center. While there, he made two major contributions to medicine: the “Allis inhaler,” at the time a safer and more convenient way to administer general anesthesia with ether or chloroform to surgical patients, and the Allis forceps, which is well-known and still used by surgeons today (see above). In 1885, Allis was elected to Jefferson College Board of Trustees. During this same period, he became teacher of orthopedics at Jefferson, a fellow of the Academy of Surgery, and a member of the American Surgical Association. Pediatricians still use the Allis sign (also called Galeazzi test) to assess for hip dysplasia. It is performed by flexing an infant's knees when they are lying down so that the feet touch the surface and the ankles touch the buttocks. If the knees are not level then the test is positive, indicating a potential congenital hip malformation. Allis received the Samuel D. Gross Prize and $1000 from the Philadelphia Academy of Surgery in 1895 for his groundbreaking work on reduction of hip dislocations. In 1902, he was one of the first surgeons to describe successful bowel anastomosis. To this day, bowel surgeons use Allis clamps while performing this procedure. In the same year, a Philadelphia newspaper called him the “Father of Orthopedic Surgery at Jefferson College.” He was so well respected throughout the medical community that he received an honorary LL.D. from Lafayette University in 1909. On 24 October 1877, Allis married Julia Thompson (1843-1912). One of their children Oswald Thompson Allis (1880-1973), a famed scholar and teacher of the Old Testament and co-founder of Westminster Theological Seminary in Glenside, Pennsylvania. On 15 April 1912, the same day as the sinking of the RMS Titanic, Julia died. Nine years later on 16 May 1921, Oscar Allis, MD, LL.D., died at his home at 1604 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, of cerebral hemorrhage; he was 85 years old. Three days later he was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Section T, Plot 224, next to Julia.

It was accompanied by a four-part BBC television series of the same name. History Thatcher's close friend Woodrow Wyatt recounted in his diary on 3 February 1989 a conversation he had with Rupert Murdoch who wanted Thatcher to write her equivalent of Mikhail Gorbachev's Perestroika, explaining her philosophy and that John O'Sullivan could do all the \\"donkey work\\" for her. Wyatt countered this by stating that the chairman of the publishing house Collins had tried to get him to persuade Thatcher to publish her memoirs with Collins and Thatcher herself seemed favourable to this option. The next day Wyatt put Murdoch's idea to Thatcher but she claimed she did not have the time. On 29 November 1990, the day after Thatcher's resignation as Prime Minister, Wyatt told her of Murdoch's suggestion of O'Sullivan as a helper, to which Thatcher responded: \\"What a wonderful idea. That would be marvellous\\". On 6 November Thatcher told Wyatt that George Weidenfeld of publishers Weidenfeld and Nicolson had approached her about her memoirs but Wyatt warned her off him and advocated doing a deal with Murdoch. Thatcher replied: \\"I would prefer to do it with Rupert because he has been so wonderful and supportive of me, even if I do it for a little less\\". On 11 December Wyatt recorded that Murdoch had visited Thatcher but that she had not made up her mind about what sort of book she would write and that she would not accept an advance on a book she had not started writing. Murdoch said she was the first author who he had heard would not do that. On 28 January 1991 Thatcher told Wyatt that she wanted to deal with Murdoch directly and did not really want an agent. However, by 23 March Wyatt was writing that Thatcher \\"seemed to be all over the shop now with her book\\" and he said to Murdoch that he thought she was going to do a deal with him but \\"Now she is apparently putting out tenders to publishers and agents\\". Murdoch replied: \\"Yes, it's Mark Thatcher, the son, who has taken charge of her affairs and she is doing everything he tells her. He has even got a Maxwell publisher (Macmillan of New York) on the list. When people talked about getting three to four million for her memoirs, Mark replied that he could get more than double that, eight to ten million. Good luck to him if he can but I don't think he will\\". On 26 April Wyatt was writing that Mark Thatcher \\"has fouled everything up with people who might help her write it and publishers and all the rest of it\\". On 9 May Wyatt was still despondent: \\"I am desperately worried about her. I feel that Mark has mucked up her chances of a quick, high-priced sale for her memoirs\\". Mark Thatcher openly talked of getting eight, ten or even twenty million for his mother's memoirs, which was more than Murdoch was willing to pay. In his dealing's with Murdoch's rival Robert Maxwell, Mark Thatcher apparently had a one million fee for himself. On 21 April 1991 Murdoch used the front page of The Sunday Times to denounce his interference. Thatcher was indignant and said to Wyatt: \\"How can Rupert do this to me?\\" Murdoch told Wyatt later that day: \\"None of her friends dare tell her what a dreadful mess Mark is making of her affairs\\". However, in June the Maxwell deal fell through and a week after this Mrs Thatcher signed to Marvin Josephson, an American agent, who quickly accepted a £3.5 million deal with HarperCollins for two books to be published in 1993 and 1995. The publishing world believed that Mark Thatcher had got the worst of both worlds by demanding too much at first and then losing the prime moment by dithering in the negotiations while the value of the memoirs declined. Thatcher had eighteen months to write the book covering her premiership. She hired a previous director of the Conservative Research Department, Robin Harris, to do most of the writing, the Oxford academic Christopher Collins to do the research and O'Sullivan to help polish the drafts. Just like with her speeches, Thatcher would \\"edit, criticise and exhaustively rewrite the drafts\\" until she was happy. She spent time writing it at the Manor House Hotel Castle Combe. Reception The Downing Street Years were published on 18 October 1993, timed to coincide with the Conservative Party conference. It was serialised in The Sunday Times on the Sunday after the conference closed. There were rumours the book would not be helpful to her successor, John Major, and these were confirmed when the Daily Mirror leaked her views that Major had \\"swallowed ... the slogans of the European lobby ... intellectually ... [he] was drifting with the tide\\". The editor of The Times, Simon Jenkins, denounced her criticisms of Major. However at the conference Thatcher tried hard to be loyal to Major and she was even seen greeting Michael Heseltine. After Major made a speech saying he was going \\"back to basics\\", Thatcher praised him for returning to \\"the true path of Conservatism\\". Thatcher was interviewed with David Frost on Breakfast with Frost about her memoirs, and she promoted her book with radio and television interviews, book signings, a question and answer session at the Barbican chaired by Jeffrey Archer and a four-part BBC television series. Geoffrey Howe reviewed the book in the Financial Times, Nigel Lawson in the Evening Standard, Douglas Hurd in The Spectator, Norman Tebbit in the Daily Mail and Bernard Ingham in the Daily Express. One of her biographers, John Campbell, wrote of the book: > The book has its longueurs, but it is still by far the most comprehensive > and readable of modern prime ministerial memoirs: partisan of course, but > generally a clear and vivid account of her side of the arguments. Of course > it aggrandises her role, exaggerates the degree to which she knew where she > was going from the beginning, slides over her moments of doubt and > hesitation and diminishes the role of most of her colleagues, aides and > advisers. It is a shockingly ungenerous book, shot through with gratuitously > withering comments not only about people like Michael Heseltine and Geoffrey > Howe whom she had some cause to feel bitter about, but also about other > inoffensive colleagues who had served her well. Only Willie Whitelaw, Keith > Joseph and Denis are beyond criticism, plus of course Bernard Ingham and > Charles Powell. Other officials are barely mentioned. Nevertheless The > Downing Street Years is a good record.

After a nearly year-long development through Han Tani and Kittaka's last years in college the game was released on February 4, 2013, for Windows PC, Mac OS X and Linux. An Android version was released as part of a Humble Bundle on October 15, 2013. The Nintendo Switch version was released on February 28, 2019. The Anodyne soundtrack was also made available for purchase at the time of release, including all of the music in the game as well as a few bonus tracks. The game features action and adventure elements, and puts the player in the shoes of Young, exploring a dream world. Reviews of the game were mostly positive, generally praising the game's mix of adventure and action gameplay with an immersive, dream-like atmosphere created by the game's soundtrack and use of pixel art. Critiques tended to center on the story's lack of clarity, as well as some of the jumping mechanics. The game placed as an honorable mention in the 2013 Student Independent Games Festival. A sequel to the game, Anodyne 2: Return to Dust, was released August 12, 2019. Gameplay Anodyne is played by exploring a dream world of the game's protagonist, Young. The gameplay involves the use of two primary items, a broom and shoes for jumping. The game takes place in adjacent screen-sized rooms that make up the game's play areas. The player explores dungeons, which are sets of rooms with puzzles and enemies, as well as other areas that focus less on combat and puzzles, such as a red, swamp-like area, and a dimly-lit forest. The player is required to find a certain number of cards in order to progress to the end sections of the game. Development Anodyne began as a solo project by Sean Han Tani in March 2012. Through a mutual friend, in June 2012, Han Tani met Marina Kittaka, who worked remotely on the game until its release in February 2013. Through development, the two worked together on story themes and level design. Kittaka wrote most of the dialogue and created all of the game's artwork, while Han Tani programmed the game and wrote its soundtrack. Shortly after release, Anodyne was featured on the front page of The Pirate Bay which garnered the game enough votes to be accepted onto Steam through its Greenlight system. On April 4, 2020, Melos Han-Tani from Analgesic Productions released the source code of Anodyne under a custom permissive license. Music Anodynes soundtrack was composed by Sean Han Tani. At the time of Anodynes release, the soundtrack was made available as a download-only on Han Tani's online Bandcamp store, with the 40 tracks used in the game, as well as 14 bonus tracks, consisting of outtakes, and songs from Anodynes trailers The total runtime is 85 minutes and 32 seconds. Anodyne track list On August 27, 2013, a remix compilation album was released on Han Tani's Bandcamp page, featuring arrangements of Anodynes music from a variety of composers. ANODYNE REMIX ALBUM track list Reception Anodyne was met with mixed – though overall positive – reviews, in general comparing Anodynes gameplay to that of Zelda games such as Link's Awakening and A Link to the Past, and praising the game's pixel art and music style. Critics often praised the game's unsettling and surreal nature. Polygon's Danielle Riendeau stated that, regarding Anodynes world: \\"Fantasy and reality exist adjacent to one another, highlighting the central theme of disconnection nicely.\\" Criticism of the game often centered around frustrating platforming sections, and the reception to Anodynes narrative was very mixed. Regarding the story, Tom Sykes of PC Gamer stated \\"I doubt I’ll ever get to the root of its narrative mysteries.\\" Josh Mattingly of Indie Statik stated \\"it concerns musings on the state of humanity and other existential considerations\\" whereas Vito of Destructoid stated \\"it becomes clear the developers have no interest in defining their world properly; whatever theories you might devise about the game’s hidden meaning given no real justification.\\"  References   External links  * Category:2013 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Art games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Indie video games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Commercial video games with freely available source code Category:Windows games ","title":"Anodyne (video game)"},{"id":"39330237","text":"Hans Petter Fjeld Skinstad (born 13 June 1946 in Nord-Odal) is a Canadian former cross-country skier who competed in the 1976 Winter Olympics.

Times, September 7, 2005, as accessed February 21, 2013. New York City politics Moskovitz served on New York City Council as the member for the Upper East Side of Manhattan from 1999 until 2006. Between 2002 and 2004, Moskowitz wrote six laws, including laws on health care and campaign finance reform. Moskowitz's tenure in City County was set against the backdrop of a call for \\"national education-reform\\", where she became known as \\"the reliable scourge of the public-education establishment in New York City.\\" When Moskowitz first returned to New York after a year in Vanderbilt, she volunteered in Gifford Miller's City Council campaign and served as his field director. When he became speaker in 2002, Miller made Moskowitz the chair of the City's Council Education Committee, where she served until 2005. In the three years in the position of chair, Moskowitz held over oversight hearings focused on New York City's public school system. While Moskowitz had the support of the Joel Klein, who was Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education from 2002 to 2010, she developed a reputation for being \\"abrasive\\" even with those who admired and supported her. During the hearings, Moskowitz found that New York City's public schools lacked teachers, supplies and facilities to support art and music, that many schools lacked appropriate facilities for physical education, schools were being overcharged for supplies because they were required to use a city-mandated online purchasing system, science education was being \\"treated with second-class status for decades\\", there were too few qualified science teachers and insufficient science facilities. that social studies and civics instruction was below par, that only 10 percent of black and Hispanic students were eligible for Regents diplomas, and that parents were being asked to donate basic supplies for basic hygiene, such as toilet paper and paper towels, In 2005, approximately 30 students appeared at a hearing to testify about school conditions including complaints about filthy bathrooms and broken toilets. United Federation of Teachers (UFT) members were \\"enraged\\" by the 2003 City Council hearings on teachers' contracts, seniority rights, work rules and on other education issues.

Success Academy Charter Schools  The first Success Academy Charter School opened in 2006, with Moskowitz serving as Principal. There were 165 students. The school was co-located in a building in Harlem with two other zoned district public schools. According to the podcastStartUp, Moskowitz had succeeded in closing the achievement gap with \\"disadvantaged kids performing on par with the very top tier public-school students\\" in New York in standardized tests as required by the New York State Education Department for students in grades three and eight. With these unprecedented test scores, Moskowitz earned the support of the media, wealthy donors, including Wall Street hedge fund executives, and those with political power, such New York's Governor, David Paterson, and Mayor Bloomberg, who said that the Harlem Success Academy was \\"the poster child for this country.\\" President Barack Obama considered charter schools to be a \\"crucial component of education reform\\". In March 2010, The Economist said that Harlem was the \\"ground zero of the charter-school movement\\". The day after her electoral defeat on September 15, 2005, Moskowitz met with Petry and Greenblatt who convinced her to lead their proposed charter school network. They became the Success Academy network's \\"founding funders\\" starting with Harlem Success Academy. In 2008, three more schools opened. By 2012, Success Academy Charter School Inc. had over \\"eight and a half million dollars in savings and temporary cash investments in 2012, and it spent at least 1.3 million dollars on outreach and consulting services.\\" In the 2010 fiscal year, Success Charter Network has raised $4.8 million from private funding along public funds from three levels of government. By 2010, charter schools had become a \\"favorite cause of many of the founders of New York hedge funds, such as Anchorage Capital Partners, Greenlight Capital, and Pershing Square Capital Management with over $15 billion assets under management, who could \\"wield\\" their fortunes as members of Democrats for Education Reform, (DFER) to \\"influence educational policy in Albany.\\" and push for education reform. These wealthy hedge fund executives provided a significant \\"political counterweight to the powerful teachers unions\\" who opposed charter schools. Joe Williams, author of Cheating Our Kids: How Politics and Greed Ruin Education, was DFER's CEO. In 2015, hedge fund manager John Paulson, a major Trump ally, donated $8.5 million to Success. By December 2017, Success Academy included 45 schools, with schools in every borough of New York except Staten Island, with 17,000 students. According to a 2017 article in New Yorker, \\"Moskowitz said that, she hoped to be running 100 schools, \\"within a decade\\". Controversy In an October 2015, PBS News Hour feature, PBS special correspondent for education, John Merrow, on New York City's \\"high-profile charter schools network\\". A representative of a Success Academy charter school that shares the same building with a zoned public school in Brooklyn, New York, said that they did use out-of-school suspension for \\"their scholars\\" who are kindergartners and first graders. In 2014, in one school alone, 44 out-of- school suspensions were issued to 203 kindergartners and first graders. Success Academy is a \\"very structured environment\\" with \\"very high academic and behavioral expectations for our scholars\\". A mother and her son, who was a student at the school, described the negative impact of theses suspensions and how this led her to transfer her son to another school. In response to the criticism, Moskowitz wrote a detailed letter which included the young boy's school records—and his offenses. Moskowitz sent the letter to PBS, to education reporters, posted it on the Success website, and included it in her 2017 book. In 2019, the US Department of Education found that these disclosures violated the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Success Academy again violated a former student’s privacy rights when school officials disclosed the details of her educational records to a reporter. In 2020, the NY State Education Department found the school had violated the New York State student privacy law. In 2017, hedge fund manager and Success Academy network board chair Daniel Loeb compared Democratic State Senate leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a black woman, to a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Moskowitz retained Loeb as chairman after he deleted the post and apologized, stating that “charter school opponents are now trying to seize upon this incident.” In Midtown Manhattan June 2018, students from Success Academy's new flagship high school, took to the streets to protest Moskovitz's policies, including the \\"no excuses\\" disciplinary policies. They chanted, \\"Say our names, not our test scores.\\" In January 2018, Moskowitz—who was concerned the high school's principal and teachers were not being strict enough—\\"installed her desk in the high school hallway and implemented tougher sanctions on students.\\" As the number of new rules and severity of the consequences, increased, the students organized their first protest in the high school itself. These students and their parents had been attending protests against the Mayor of New York, organized by Moskowitz, for years. Moskowitz removed some rules and decreased the punishments. Gimlet described the final year of the first Success Academy's graduation class, as \\"very tumultuous\\" and \\"chaotic.\\" At the end of the school year, Moskowitz faced the ire of some parents during a school meeting. Some of them were expressed feelings of guilt, worry and alarm at what was happening to their teenagers. One raised concerns about the school's \\"mean culture\\", that is in the \\"fabric of our school system\\", in another about \\"the harsh way\\" that \\"teachers talk to kids\\". They worry about the \\"emotional impact it may have.\\" However, not all parents agreed. By 2019, according to The Washington Post, the Success Academy network of 47 schools serving 17,000 students, is the \\"highest-performing and most criticized educational institution in New York\\", and perhaps in the United States. Charter school advocacy In December 2014, Moskowitz said that public education in the U.S. is lacking in rigor. She said that children must be challenged, as well as engaged, in order for them to want to be at school. In her May 15, 2015 acceptance speech of the Manhattan Institute's Alexander Hamilton Award, Moskowitz promoted \\"school choice\\" or the \\"right to choose\\", which was first proposed in 1955.The right to choose or school choice which was first proposed in 1955, by economist and Nobel laureate Milton Friedman in an article entitled \\"The Role of Government in Education\\". He promoted the use of free market principles to improve the United States public school system. Instead of assigning children a public school based on where their parents live—zoned public schools—, Friedman proposed that parents should be able to choose their children's publicly-funded schools—public or private, religious or non-religious. Moskowitz praised the use of tax credits as a powerful tool that allows parents' to \\"vote with their feet.\\" Moskowitz believes that many underestimate the aptitude of inner city low-income students, She said, \\"We simply do not believe that because children are low income or come from certain neighborhoods that they cannot achieve at the highest levels.\\" Another approach that Moskowitz uses in Success Academy schools, is the implementation of the broken windows theory, popularized in the 1990s as a policing method by Rudy Giuliani and Bill Bratton. The theory has been criticized for the resulting over-criminalization of communities of color. In every Success school there is a special business operations manager (BOM) team of several full-time staff, who are responsible for \\"everything non-instructional\\", such as maintenance of the school and courtyard. The BOS team undertake multiple \\"walkthroughs\\" to ensure that the schools' \\"coherent culture\\" with \\"bright, cheerful, well lit, inviting\\", and \\"warm\\" physical surroundings. Moskowitz said that there is a need for more charter schools with socio-economic and racial diversity, which includes opening more charter schools in affluent districts. She described New York City schools as \\"shockingly segregated\\". In an interview with MarketWatch, Moscowitz said that education was \\"mostly a state and local matter\\" and she would continue to focus on \\"reimagining public education\\", which she calls, \\"one of the most important civil rights issues of our time.\\" By 2019, the charter school movement the statewide cap on new charters was near capacity. =Conflict with New York City= Moskowitz has been in a battle with Mayor of New York City Bill de Blasio since they both served on the New York City Council. In 2018, the New York Daily News called it a \\"long-running war between Moskowitz and New York's charter-skeptic mayor. Under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the number of charter schools in New York increased from 17 charter schools in 2002, to 183 in 2013. In a November 28, 2011 interview with the New York Daily News Editorial Board, Moskowitz \\"spoke passionately of the need to create more great schools with the help of a reform-minded administration\\" in the Mayor's office. By November 2011, Moskowitz was concerned about Bloomberg's potential replacement in the 2013 mayoral election. At that time de Blasio was already dubbed a \\"dedicated obstructionist\\" of the charter schools, by the Daily News. Bloomberg had proven to be a \\"zealous education reformer\\" and a strong effective advocate for charter schools in the City. By 2011, Moskowitz already had \\"opened nine high-performing charter schools\\" and had five more schools that she was preparing for opening. She told the Daily News that she was considering running for the office of mayor. Moskowitz's opposition to de Blasio intensified as she advocated for an end to caps on charter schools in general, and for Success Academy in particular. During his mayoral campaign de Blasio, in June 2013, said that he would end the policy of providing free rent for charter schools that shared buildings with district zoned public schools run by the Department of Education. Charter schools, such as Success Academy are co-housed with public schools and have access to utilities, janitorial services, and school-safety officials for free. De Blasio, said that he would end free rent for some co-located charter schools. Charter schools are \\"publicly funded but autonomously owned and operated, accountable for results but largely free of government oversight\\". Charter schools can \\"add revenue from private sources, lengthen their academic day and year,\\" and \\"create their own curricula\\". De Blasio, who had served on City of New York's Council Education Committee with Moskowitz for four years, singled out Success Academy in his comments. De Blasio is a strong supporter of teachers unions, whereas charter schools can \\"hire—and fire—nonunionized teachers at will.\\" By 2014, only about 12 percent of the charter schools were unionized. De Blasio's stance against charter schools was just one aspect of what was described as a \\"popular rebellion against corporate-friendly policies that had dominated New York for decades.\\" As New York Mayor, de Blasio announced in March 2014, that he was disapproving three of Success Academy's co-locations that had been approved under his predecessor, Bloomberg, due to concerns of placing young children in high schools or displacing special needs public school students. Some in the media called this de Blasio's war on charter schools and minority students. Moskowitz, who was called one of de Blasio's \\"fiercest critics\\", closed all of 22 Success Academy schools on March 4, 2013 and encouraged the staff, students to participate in \\"the largest civic field trip in history\\" with \\"thousands of students, parents and teachers\\" rallying in Albany, the state capital. Moskowitz was criticized for seeking the support of hedge fund managers and other influential financial leaders on Wall Street in her fight against de Blasio. Moskowitz, along with the allied charter school PAC StudentsFirst, contributed over $4 million to New York State Senate Republican campaigns, helping them maintain control of the chamber, to foster legislation for further privatization. Moskowitz founded and directs the Great Public Schools Political Action Committee (PAC) that supports charter schools, following an election in which a pro-Success Academy candidate lost. Rank 115. In the 2011–2012, the Great Public Schools (PAC) gave $50,000 to Andrew Cuomo 2014, Inc.N.Y.

Selected publications and films  In 1993, Moskowitz wrote, produced and directed the VHS-only Some Spirit in Me, which examined the feminist movement from non-prominent activists.Some Spirit in Me, OCLC 38915965, in WorldCat, as accessed September 5, 2012. In 1996 she published a Journal of Women's History article on the work of Betty Friedan. In 2001, Moskowitz released the book In Therapy We Trust. The book argued that the American emphasis on self-fulfillment damages civic engagement. In 2012, she co-authored Mission Possible: How the Secrets of the Success Academies Can Work in Any School with Arin Lavinia. In 2017, HarperCollins published her memoir, The Education of Eva Moskowitz. In 2010, Moskowitz was featured in the documentaries The Lottery and Waiting for \\"Superman\\", which followed students applying to Success Academy as well as protests and legal disputes associated with charter schools.  Personal life  She married Eric Grannis. They have three children, two of whom attend Success Academy Harlem East.

The N-localizer comprises a diagonal rod that spans two vertical rods to form an N-shape (Figure 1) and permits calculation of the point where a tomographic image plane intersects the diagonal rod. Attaching three N-localizers to a stereotactic instrument allows calculation of three points where a tomographic image plane intersects three diagonal rods (Figure 2). These points determine the spatial orientation of the tomographic image plane relative to the stereotactic frame. The N-localizer is integrated with the Brown-Roberts-Wells (BRW), Kelly-Goerss, Leksell, Cosman-Roberts-Wells (CRW), Micromar-ETM03B, FiMe-BlueFrame, Macom, and Adeor-Zeppelin stereotactic frames and with the Gamma Knife radiosurgery system. An alternative to the N-localizer is the Sturm-Pastyr localizer or V-bar that comprises three rods wherein two diagonal rods form a V-shape and a third, vertical rod is positioned midway between the two diagonal rods (Figure 3). The Sturm-Pastyr localizer is integrated with the Riechert-Mundinger and Zamorano-Dujovny stereotactic frames. Compared to the N-localizer, the Sturm-Pastyr localizer is less accurate and necessitates more elaborate calculations to determine the spatial orientation of the tomographic image plane relative to the stereotactic frame. In contrast to the N-localizer that does not require specification of the pixel size in a tomographic image, the Sturm-Pastyr localizer requires precise specification of the pixel size.

Over five rooms full of files containing names, address, identity documents, were brought to light. The store of documents measures nearly five miles in linear length, and contains records dating back as far as the late nineteenth century (1882) and as recent as 1997.. Since the discovery, forensic teams have been carefully archiving the files they have found, with the help of specialized organizations like Benetech and Human Rights Data Analysis Group, and software such as Martus. In December 2009, the AHPN achieved legal certainty through the Inter-Institutional Cooperation Agreement between the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Culture and Sport. By the end of 2013, more than 15 million documents (about 20% of the roughly 80 million total sheets) had been digitized.. In July 2015, the AHPN celebrated the tenth anniversary of its discovery.  Discovery  In July 2005, an explosion near the police compound prompted officials to inspect surrounding buildings looking for bombs left from the war. While investigating an abandoned munitions depot, they found it stuffed with police records. Investigators described the room as “brim with head-high heaps of papers, some bundled with plastic string, and others mixed with books, photographs, videotapes and computer disks—all told, nearly five linear miles of documents.” This archive contains approximately 80 million pages of information from the Guatemalan National Police, the largest collection of state secrets ever found in Latin America. The archive most notably sheds light on kidnappings, tortures and murders of tens of thousands of people during the country's 36-year Guatemalan Civil War, which ended in 1996, while the collections date back to the nineteenth century.  Guatemalan Civil War  In 1954 the democratic interlude in Guatemalan history was ended by the CIA, who overthrew the government and installed the right-wing Guatemalan Army Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas as Head of State and therefore started decads marked by violence. From the mid-1950s through the 1970s, the UN characterized Guatemala as a state increasing repression against its citizens in response to militia unrest and leftist inclinations. In 1982, after a military coup led by Efraín Ríos Montt, the Guatemalan military conducted mass killings at especially alarming rates in response to higher public mobilization in favor of the Revolutionary National Unity of Guatemala (URNG). The CIIDH database documented 18,000 killings by government forces in the year 1982. The United Nations established the Historical Clarification Commission to investigate the human rights violations during the Guatemalan Civil War. The Commission presented its report, Guatemala: Memory of Silence on February 25, 1999. They found that over 200,000 people were killed, in which \\"State forces and related paramilitary groups were responsible for 93% of the violations documented.” Public mobilization against the government was highest between 1978 and 1982 and so was the rate of murder and human rights abuses. The 1996 Peace Accords ended the 36-year Guatemalan Civil War, which was one of the longest and bloodiest in Latin American history. The process began in 1991, leading a gradual process towards democratization. Part of this negotiation was the creation of the Human Rights Accord, signed in March 1994, which created mechanisms for ensuring fair and equal treatment of government dissenters. As became clear from the archive, the army had for years kidnapped, tortured, and killed many citizens associated with anti-government groups.  Human Rights Prosecutions  The archives have been used to try ex- government officials who committed human rights violations during past authoritarian governments. Former head of the national police, Hector Bol de la Cruz was charged and convicted in the case of Fernando Garcia, a 27-year old student activist who disappeared on February 18, 1984. Bol de la Cruz was sentenced to 40 years in prison for his role in the kidnapping. Families of roughly 45,000 missing leftists have contacted local rights groups to help them find information about their relatives in the archives, hoping that trials will end decades of impunity for crimes against suspected leftists. As Reuters reports, “Human rights lawyers say success in the cases would bring Guatemala into the ranks of countries like Rwanda and Germany, which held former government officials and military officers responsible for atrocities.” Efraín Ríos Montt, head of the Guatemalan army, stood trial in 2013 regarding his war crimes with substantial evidence from the Guatemala National Police Archive. After a lengthy appeals process, on 10 May 2013, he was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity, was sentenced to 80 years imprisonment. 10 days later, an appeals court overturned the decision, forcing a retrial in 2015. A Guatemalan court has stated that he can stand trial for genocide and crimes against humanity, but he cannot be sentenced due to dementia, which prevents him from reasonably defending himself.  Archiving Techniques  Over the past 10 years, extensive efforts have revolved around the preservation, identification and description of the archival materials. In order for the documents to be utilized for human rights cases, officials first must make sense of what was found. This task, however, proved to be extensively difficult, especially considering that there are miles of documents to look through. Investigators soon employed the help of database software and statistical analysis, with the assistance of Benetech, a non- proift founded in Palo Alto, California in 2000 with the slogan \\"Technology Serving Humanity.\\" Benetech does significant work with human rights, revolving around a database called Martus, which helps sort and analyze information that is inputted. The data can also be backed up and secured, a crucial element for human rights projects considering that the information is largely legally and political sensitive. According to Patrick Ball, the organization's chief scientist and director of its human rights program, the Guatemalan archives presented a unique challenge that was \\"longer-term, more scientifically complex and more politically sensitive\\" than anything the organization had done before. He continues, “The point of all human rights work is to understand the past, so we can build a future that doesn’t repeat it… we give [organizations] the technical tools to preserve their information…and provide them with technical support to assure that the process is systematic, thorough and scientific.”  Legacy  From July 2009 the ownership of Guatemala National Police Archive moved from the Ministry of Interior to the Ministry of Culture and Sports, under the guidance of the General Archive of Central America (AGCA). The Guatemalan Justice Department is pursuing further prosecutions related to war crimes, hoping that these will help Guatemalan families find closure in times of tragic defeat. \\"Prosecutions are a great way of creating moral closure—I've participated in many,\\" says Patrick Ball,, chief Benetech scientist. \\"But they aren't what will change a country.\\" In his view, understanding how the National Police went bad and preventing it from happening again—\\"that's real improvement...Now it's the world's job to dig through the material and make sense of it.\\" The archive, however, will not only be used for prosecutions. Guatemalan scholars, historians, and journalists also want to look the government's record and role in a conflict that destroyed so many lives. The national healing process is not limited to judicial procedure, but instead, as human rights advocates have argued, a collective reckoning across disciplines of thought.

Avolites manufactures high end professional lighting control consoles, stage dimming equipment, and media servers for use in the professional stage lighting and media control systems industries. In 2011 the company expanded into the media server sector of the entertainments technology market by acquiring software developed by Immersive Ltd, supplying control systems used in the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony, and the 2014 Winter Sochi Olympics ceremonies. The company has received awards for many of its products, including the ART-series dimmers, the Sapphire Media, and the Ai media server software.  History  Avolites started as a lighting production company in 1976 when a group of touring road crew formed a company to manufacture their designs for a touring dimmer rack, the Avolites FD dimmer. The company then expanded into manufacturing lighting control consoles, initially releasing the 8100 series, before creating the QM500 series in 1983. During the 1980s the reputation of the brand grew and by the late 1980s the company was purchased by Carlton Television. The company was returned to private ownership as part of a management buy out in 1991. Eventually the lighting production work was discontinued and the company focused on equipment manufacturing only. During the 1990s the company introduced several new products designed to control the range of intelligent lighting products that were emerging onto the market at the time, releasing the Rolacue Sapphire, Pearl 2000 (released 1995), Sapphire 2000 (released 1998) and Diamond II/III consoles. Most of these consoles were based on Motorola 68000 family processors. In 1996 the company also updated the FD dimmer, replacing it with the Art 4000. During the 2000s the dimmer product range was redesigned again, resulting in the Art 2000 series of racks; the Art 2000i installation racks and - in the later part of the decade - the PowerCube dimmer/distribution units. In 2001 Avolites launched the Diamond 4 range of control consoles, which was based on a conventional PC motherboard instead of custom made hardware reliant on Motorola processors. Although the custom hardware consoles were still sold and updated in stages during the 2000s, the company gradually moved software development towards the Windows OS running on conventional PC motherboards. This move allowed the company to re- write its lighting control software, resulting in the release of the Titan software series in the late 2000s. Since the introduction of Titan the company has designed a range of consoles specifically to run the software, including the Titan One USB DMX dongle, Titan Mobile, Tiger Touch and Sapphire Touch consoles, which were all introduced between 2009 and 2012. Avolites Media David Green, Mark Calvert and Ralph Lambert formed a VJ collective known as Inside-Us-All initially working on visual effects for the rave and party scene. The trio decided to expand into more corporate work and took on a new staff member, John Munro, forming the Pixel Addicts company at the time. Pixel Addicts was later renamed to Immersive and it was within Immersive that the \\"Addict\\" media server software was developed. In June 2011, Avolites acquired the rights to the Addict media server software developed by Immersive, rebranded it as \\"Ai\\" and formed a spin-off company called Avolites Media. The media server products were used in the Olympic opening and closing ceremonies of 2012 to perform video mapping across the audience seats.  Management changes  In October 2012, the company appointed JB Toby and Koy Neminathan as Technical Director and Sales Director respectively. Steve Warren moved into the position of Business Development Director. In February 2018, Paul Wong was appointed as Managing Director, replacing Richard Salzedo who is now the group chairman.  Products  Avolites has manufactured a wide range of lighting control products, accessories and software, but is best known for its range of control consoles and dimmer racks. 1977 B100 Console, 1978 FC Dimmers, 1983 QM500 Console, 1992 Rolacue Sapphire, 1994 Rolacue Pearl, 1999 Pearl 2000, 2001 Diamond 4, 2006 Pearl Expert, 2008 Titan v1, 2011 Tiger Touch, 2013 Expert Pro, 2018 Ai Q3 Media Server  References   External links  * *Fixture Personality Library Category:Electronics companies of the United Kingdom Category:Stage lighting Category:Stagecraft software Category:Companies based in the London Borough of Ealing ","title":"Avolites"},{"id":"39330485","text":"Moja TV is a Bosnian IPTV provider, subsidiary of the BH Telecom, which provides various thematic channels, HD and Timeshift channels, Video on demand, video recording, the use of an Electronic Program Guide (EPG) and other similar services.

Plot Donovan Matheson (Danny Glover) is a man trapped in the past. Once an esteemed physicist, Donovan worked on the Manhattan Project. In the years that followed, his regret spilled into his personal life, when he became obsessed with finding a theory for cold fusion to help benefit the world. Donovan's obsession led to the loss of his wife and child in an accident he believes he could have prevented. After a thirty-year absence, Donovan returns to his small town, where he finds himself caught up in events that echo the same tragedy. He witnessed a fatal car accident and somehow foreknew it would happen. He then walks out of a store and saves a girl who is standing under a scaffold from being struck by a falling power tool. Plagued by déjà vu, Donovan is convinced his young neighbor, Maggie, (Natasha Calis) and her mother, Sarah (Sonja Bennett) are doomed to die on the anniversary of his family's deaths. Struggling to unlock the pattern, Donovan attempts to decipher a puzzle that he believes ties the past to the present, and offers a path to redemption. Donovan tries to convince his brother-in-law, police Sergeant Finnley (Bruce Greenwood), but when his facts don't add up, Donovan's sanity is questioned. Is he losing his mind, or running out of time? Cast Production Development Following the success of his Comic- Con award-winning short film, Tomorrow's Memoir, co-writer/director Jim Cliffe began conceiving an idea for a feature-length screenplay, inspired by a moment of déjà vu. Taking a cue from co-writing teams such as husband and wife duo Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh, Jim enlisted the help of his writer girlfriend (now wife), Melodie Krieger, to flesh out what would become Donovan's Echo. From the beginning, the two imagined an older protagonist with a tragic past and a lifetime of regret, who was now experiencing a phenomenon he couldn't comprehend. Donovan's tragic background included the idea that he worked on the Manhattan Project as a theorist. \\"I thought it might be interesting to have a character with a set of tools to try and dissect what is happening around him.\\" explains Cliffe. \\"That was a pretty momentous moment in our history that hasn’t really been covered a lot in contemporary film.\\" In late 2007, the first draft of Donovan's Echo placed quarter-finalist in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting. Out of 3000 international screenplays, the script also won the Bronze prize for Drama in the PAGE International Screenwriting Awards. While the script gained Hollywood interest, finding producers willing to take a chance on a first-time director proved challenging. Jim approached producer Trent Carlson, who he'd worked with before as an artist. Trent agreed to produce and brought on producers Andria Spring and Mary Anne Waterhouse to begin a phase of development and rewrites; refining the story and bringing it more to a production ready point. Another boon to development was from a former co- worker and friend of Jim's, Lance Priebe, whom Cliffe had met in the late-’90s when they were both artists. Priebe had gone on to develop Club Penguin, a virtual game for children, that in 2007 was sold to Disney. \\"We both were let go from the same company at the same time. He wanted to create games, and I wanted to create films,\\" explained Cliffe. Lance and his wife Kim came on board as executive producers and helped finance the film alongside Telefilm and other Canadian production sources, bringing in a modest budget of around $3M. \\"It magically came together. We were able to get all our financing and production done in Canada, as well as distribution with a company out of Toronto,\\" said Cliffe. Casting A casting agent put a list of names together for potential \\"Donovan's\\". One name in particular stood out to the filmmakers. That actor was Danny Glover, best known for his roles in The Colour Purple and the Lethal Weapon film franchise . \\"We could so easily see him play into this world,\\" said Cliffe, who after hearing that Glover was attached, was soon able to cast Canadian born Bruce Greenwood. Along the way they also found the rest of their cast in Natasha Calis, Sonja Bennett, David Lewis, and Ian Tracey. Filming With casting in place, Donovan’s Echo went into production in late 2010. The tight 20-day shoot included multiple locations around Vancouver, Maple Ridge, Fort Langley and Pitt Meadows, British Columbia, Canada, with the bridge scene being shot near Harrison River. The shoot also included various time periods and stunts. With a background in illustration and animation, Cliffe storyboarded the movie as well as some pre-viz animatics. But as a first-time feature director, Cliffe soon realized that his shots and sequences were a little too ambitious for such a tight schedule. As a result, he condensed his vision to suit a smaller film. Release Distributed by Union Pictures, Donovan's Echo premiered in Sudbury, Ontario's Cinéfest in September 2011, and was the opening film at the Calgary International Film Festival that same month where Bruce Greenwood also attended. The film also screened at the Edmonton, Victoria, Pan-African, and Vancouver Film Festivals, where VIFF referred to it as \\"a film that wrings hope out of mystery, love out of grief and miracles out of science\\". In February 2012, after premiering at the TIFF Bell Light box theatre, Donovan's Echo had a limited theatrical release across Canada. The movie was released on DVD, Blu-ray and digital download in Canada in September 2012 by Anchor Bay Entertainment, and will be coming to the U.S. in May 2013. Reception Donovan's Echo received several positive reviews. The Toronto Film Scene Magazine wrote, \\"With such an interesting mystery, great performances and themes of hope and acceptance, Donovan's Echo is a great debut for Jim Cliffe.\\" In The Toronto Examiner review, David Voigt said the movie was, \\"A thoughtful well told drama with a little bit of science fiction edge.\\" Similarly, Press+1 noted that the movie was, \\"A good mind puzzle with a moralistic center, one that would have made Rod Serling nod with approval.\\" Danny Glover's performance was also noted in several reviews. The online Criticize This wrote, \\"Glover is at the top of his game in this performance, as is Bruce Greenwood... These two actors help shape Donovan's Echo into a solid film worth watching.\\" However, not all critics were as enthusiastic.

Miller is the Founder and CEO of CoinCircle, and founding Managing Director of Hyperspeed Ventures and the former CEO and Founder of Vergence Labs, a company known for designing and developing wearable computer enabled video streaming glasses under the brand name Epiphany Eyewear as well as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) eyewear. Leaked acquisition  On November 24, 2014, a hacker group identified itself by the name \\"Guardians of Peace\\" (GOP) leaked and released confidential information from the film studio Sony Pictures Entertainment. Aside from major exposure of Sony Pictures business and employee data, information about the confidential acquisition of Miller's Company Vergence Labs' Epiphany Eyewear by Snapchat was revealed. The acquisition of Vergence Labs became public solely as the result of 2014’s hack of Sony, including the inbox of Sony Pictures chairman Michael Lynton, a Snapchat board member. Vergence Labs' main product was Epiphany Eyewear. Following the acquisition, Miller created the venture-capital and investment firm Hyperspeed Ventures in 2014. Miller announced the new venture at Wearable World Congress where he spoke about the future of wearables with augmented reality, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. During the Wearable World Congress fireside chat, Miller spoke about his vision for the future of the wearable technology industry; although he refused to discuss reports of Vergence Labs being acquired by Snapchat. Background At Hyperspeed Ventures, Miller has invested in early-stage technology startups including investments in genetic editing and quantum computing technology companies. Before starting Hyperspeed, in 2010 Miller began working on prototypes and patents for what would become Vergence Labs and by 2011 the company was officially cofounded, recruiting a founding team largely from Stanford University. Although Vergence Labs' first major release was the Epiphany Eyewear smart glasses, early in the company's history prototypes for both Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality products were developed as the vision and mission of the company. The Epiphany Eyewear POV social video smart glasses were designed with an embedded camera and computer system within frames similar in style to the wayfarer design. The design and development of Epiphany Eyewear pre-dated the start of Google Glass by about two years. In late 2013 Epiphany Eyewear began shipping to customers. Miller is also a published author, speaker and artist who has worked on feature films and spoken at SIGGRAPH and SXSW. His former employers include Digital Domain of Venice, California, Sony Pictures Imageworks of Culver City, California and Walt Disney Animation Studios of Burbank, California. While at these firms Miller developed technologies for motion picture visuals and digital film making. When Miller began his career he transitioned from the dot-com startup world after the first company he helped build was acquired in 2001; transitioning into the 3D computer animation industry as he completed an undergraduate degree in the field. Miller later received an MBA from UCLA Anderson School of Management and another Master's in Business from the National University of Singapore in 2011, at which point he chose to pursue technology entrepreneurship once again.

History Most of the book covers her life up until her election victory in 1979 but she added on about 150 pages at the end giving her opinions on current affairs on the years since she resigned as Prime Minister in 1990. Although Thatcher avoided personal attacks on her successor John Major, she clearly believed that he had squandered her legacy and was pursuing un-Thatcherite policies. The book was serialised in the Sunday Times where the apparent attacks on the Major government were sensationalised. Reception In interviews to promote the book, Thatcher claimed that the Conservatives had lost their way because they were \\"not being Conservative enough\\". In the book Thatcher wrote that: \\"I offer some thoughts about putting these things right. It is now, however, for others to take the action required\\". These words--similar to those used by Geoffrey Howe in 1990 which had precipitated her downfall--led to Major on 22 June resigning as Conservative leader and calling a leadership election. John Redwood stood against Major. Thatcher was in America at the time of the first ballot and she remained neutral, claiming that both Major and Redwood were \\"good Conservatives\\". Talking to her close friend Woodrow Wyatt on 22 May 1995, Thatcher said to him that the Sunday Times \\"distorted what I wrote\\" and that her line about policies being carried out by others meant not replacing Major but the whole Western world, the Council of Europe, etc. Later that day, Major said to Wyatt: \\"I'm bloody angry and I'm going to give her a hell of an attack and go for her\\". In his memoirs, Major wrote: \\"Her descriptions of a Grantham childhood were harmless enough, but the book contained an epilogue, unrelated to the title or scope of the book itself, which could only be interpreted as an attack on my own policies. Such blows from my predecessor were impossible to disregard, since every interviewer raised them with me at every opportunity, as she must have known they would\\".

The organization was founded in 1933, making it the first housing authority in the United States. History 1930s poster promoting Lakeview Terrace During the 1930s, Cleveland Councilman Ernest J. Bohn, led an effort to create public housing for low-income families. At that time, low income families lived in very poor conditions. Bohn sought out unsafe tumbledown shanties, known as \\"fire-traps\\", to replace with improved, affordable housing that struggling families could use to improve their livelihood and progress to home ownership. The first development to break ground was Olde Cedar in the Central neighborhood, becoming the first public housing development in the country and receiving its first occupants in 1937. This development would soon be followed by Lakeview, Outhwaite Homes and Woodhill Homes, all of which are now eligible for designation on the National Register of Historic Places. The first high-rise constructed for public housing was the Cedar Extension High-Rise, built to accommodate seniors. It was first occupied in 1955. During the 1960s and 70s, in addition to the developments CMHA was building, the organization began acquire existing properties from many different local sources. Following the establishment of the Section 8 Program with a law enacted by Congress in 1974, subsidies were offered for low income families seeking residency in privately owned housing. CMHA began administering the program at this time. During the 1990s, CMHA improved safety for the residents of its properties by pioneering the use of defensible space design concepts such as private entryways, exterior lighting, and perimeter fencing. CMHA also opened the first residential substance abuse treatment center in the country—Miracle Village, at Outhwaite Homes. Other notable milestones for CMHA in the 1990s include a primary healthcare clinic and the Carl B. Stokes Social Services Mall, a one-stop shopping facility offering social, health-related, career counseling, and training services. This facility was the first of its kind in the nation. Judge Sara J. Harper founded the Sara J. Harper Children's Library in 1992 at CMHA's Outhwaite Homes on East 43rd Street. Judge Harper grew up in the estates along with Carl and Louis Stokes. She is the first black woman graduate of the Case Western Reserve University Law School; the first woman to serve on the judiciary of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve; one of the first two women to win a seat on the Ohio Court of Appeals; and the first black woman to sit by assignment on the Ohio Supreme Court. The mission of the library is to provide a safe environment that encourages and promotes reading, learning, and positive avenues for self-realization. It is located at 2453 East 43rd Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44104. On September 13, 2007, CMHA opened the Louis Stokes Museum in honor of Cleveland-native Louis Stokes, a former congressman and civil rights attorney. The Louis Stokes Museum, located at CMHA's Outhwaite Homes, displays Stokes memorabilia, video interviews and footage, awards, and a written history about Congressman Louis Stokes and his rise to prominence. Louis and his brother Carl Stokes, Cleveland's first black mayor, grew up in the estates. The museum is located at 2453 East 43rd Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44104.  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)–Funded Projects  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), commonly referred to as the Stimulus or The Recovery Act, was an economic stimulus package enacted by the 111th United States Congress in February 2009 and signed into law on February 17, 2009, by President Barack Obama. In 2009, CMHA received more than $35 million in ARRA Formula Grant funds and more than $34 million in ARRA Competitive Grant funds. Using ARRA funding, CMHA was able to complete many projects that had been waiting adequate funding. CMHA used more than $5 million in ARRA formula funds to restore and build a 10,000 sq. ft. addition on to the historic community center at Woodhill Homes Estates, abandoned in the 1980s. In 2009 and 2010, using about $7 million, CMHA renovated 163 units, common areas, and exteriors at 13 estates to be fully accessible to persons with disabilities. This was part of an existing, large-scale, seven-year project to complete similar renovations across the agency. CMHA used more than $5 million to build an apartment building designated for senior citizens at Outhwaite Homes; Legacy Park contains 36 units, 10 of which are accessible to persons with disabilities. Using more than $2 million, CMHA restored 131 abandoned, vacant units at ten estates. CMHA also upgraded an electrical system at Outhwaite Homes to occupy vacant units. Using more than $2 million, CMHA was able to replace high-rise roofs at Wade Tower, Scranton Castle, Springbrook, and West Boulevard. CMHA also replaced 10 roofs at Olde Cedar and 17 roofs at Outhwaite Homes. CMHA used formula grant funds totaling $12 million at Phases I and II of Heritage View Homes. Containing a total of 18 single-family-homes, 81 semi-attached townhouses, and a 40 unit apartment building, work on Phase I was completed in early 2011, and Phase II was completed fall 2011. Additionally, CMHA was able to use more than $17 million to complete Phase III of Heritage View, which consisted of 69 units, 46 semi- attached townhomes and 23 single-family homes. This competitive grant funding focused on green building. Single-family homes in Heritage View Phase III have solar panels on the roofs; permeable pavement is throughout the development to reduce surface water runoff; recycled materials are in the construction; and building envelopes are Energy Star-rated. The National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials (NAHRO) recognized the project and it won the Tax Credit Excellence Award in the public housing category for the Charles L. Edson Tax Credit Excellence Awards competition. CMHA used more than $16 million in ARRA competitive grant funding to perform energy efficiency upgrades at nine sites. Upgrades include lighting and plumbing fixture replacement, window replacement, boiler and hot water heater replacement, and the installation of consumption metering to track and monitor energy use. CMHA continues to see return on investment for these projects in the form of reduced utility bills at these sites. ARRA funds in these grants were subject to strict deadlines and reporting requirements. CMHA met or exceeded all deadlines, completed all funded projects, and created nearly 1,000 employment opportunities in Northeast Ohio.  CMHA Campus Headquarters  The CMHA Administrative Headquarters brings together close to 400 CMHA employees from different departments and offices at one centralized site. The 25-acre industrial park is located in Cleveland's Kinsman neighborhood near many of the CMHA public housing developments. The facility encompasses both an administrative building and service building and assists CMHA in providing comprehensive, efficient, services and resources to the residents, clients, and other persons doing business with CMHA. In addition, the location provides convenient access to a variety of modes of transportation. The three-story office building (74,453 sq. ft.) houses eleven departments. The building's exterior materials consist of fiber cement panels, metal ribbed panels, galvanized metal shingles and aluminum composite panels. A six-acre solar field of 4,200 solar panels, generating 1.1 megawatts of electricity, sits on the site. The Property Maintenance department is housed at the Service Building (approximately 100 employees). The Service Building (25,318 sq. ft.) is a pre-engineered high bay structure and houses an office area and locker rooms on the first floor with a large meeting room stacked above those areas. The Service Building has automobile repair, workshops for skilled- tradespeople, and a fueling station. CMHA designed both buildings to meet Silver Certification requirements under Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). LEED is a voluntary third-party rating system certification developed by the United States Green Building Coalition (USGBC). Certification consists of a rating system where developers earn credits for implementing sustainable/green criteria.  Solar Panel Field  CMHA collaborated with Carbon Vision and Cleveland Public Power to conceive of and install a six-acre solar panel field on an unused post-industrial brownfield adjacent to the CMHA administrative Campus, which is LEED Silver Certified. The 1.1 megawatt solar panel field is the largest of its kind in the area. CMHA hosts the solar panel field and is able to buy power produced at a discounted rate. Excess energy goes back into the grid as pure renewable energy.

The CMHA Police Department employs OPOTC certified sworn peace officers, OPOTC certified non-sworn security officers, LEADS certified communications officers and a host of other civilian support staff for clerical and technological functions. History In 1969, CMHA stood up an Estate Patrol Unit in charge of housing security. John Carman was hired by CMHA as its first Chief of Security. In 1973, Darlice Olgetree was appointed Chief of Police. In the 1970s the department increased its size to 60 members and the \\"Notice To Violator\\" initiative was created, enabling lease enforcement for CMHA. The 1980s saw the appointment of Bernard Buckner as Chief of the Safety and Security Division. The Police Department would also see an increase in authority for its officers with new legislation. In 1985, Ohio House Bill #129 was passed, allowing CMHA to begin hiring Ohio Peace Officer Training Commission \\"OPOTC\\" certified sworn peace officers with the same training level and legal capability as city police officers such as the city of Cleveland, formally certifying the CMHA division of safety and security as an official law enforcement agency within the state of Ohio making it a legitimate police department. During the 1990s Anthony H. Jackson was appointed as Chief of Police and the Department achieved accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies or commonly known as CALEA, becoming the first housing authority police force in the United States to do so. Since the 1990s CMHA-PD has achieved multiple re- accreditations from CALEA showing a high degree of voluntary compliance with professional standards. In 2002, CMHA-PD moved into its current location at 5715 Woodland Avenue formerly known as the Carr Multi-Purpose Center built in 1974 by the city of Cleveland. The facility is secure, climate controlled, houses all agency functions and is in a better suited location to meet the higher service demands of the central neighborhood estates. Agency Units ●Patrol ●K-9 ●Detective ●Crime Suppression ●S.W.A.T. ●Community Policing ●Special Investigations ●Logistics Agency Equipment The CMHA police dept issues police officers, Glock 17 9mm pistols, Benelli 12ga shotguns and, Heckler & Koch UMP45 sub-machine guns for swat use.

Its owner won't answer it and Jean soon realizes it is because he's dead. In her panic, she begins answering the persistent phone calls, including one from the dead man's mother, and finds out the man's name is Gordon. She sits with him until the ambulance arrives. Jean attends Gordon's funeral and listens to a eulogy delivered by his rather blunt mother, Mrs. Gottlieb. During the funeral, Jean receives a call from a mysterious woman who asks to meet her. When Jean meets the woman, the woman confesses she was Gordon's mistress and wants to know his last words. In an effort to appease the woman, Jean lies and says Gordon's last words were declarations of love for his mistress. Gordon's cellphone rings and Jean answers. It is Gordon's mother inviting her over to talk. Mrs. Gottlieb welcomes Jean into her home and begins asking several intrusive and bizarre questions. Jean tries to deflect and ends up pretending she's one of Gordon's co-workers. This alarms Mrs. Gottlieb for a moment. When Mrs. Gottlieb begins to get emotional, Jean tries to placate her with another lie about how Gordon called her the day he died because he wanted to talk to her. This wins Jean an invitation back to Mrs. Gottlieb's home that evening for dinner. Jean leaves to grab a few items from the cafe. When Dwight, Gordon's brother, and Hermia, Gordon's widow arrive for dinner, Jean presents them with the cafe items, claiming they are gifts from Gordon. The gift to Mrs. Gottlieb doesn't go over so well and she storms away. When Dwight attempts to serve Jean some roast, she confesses she's a vegetarian and Dwight finds them some caramel popcorn to eat instead. They begin to bond over stories of Gordon and their shared love of stationery. Dwight works at a stationery store and offers to take Jean there. Jean and Dwight sit in the closet of the stationery store, feeling the paper. Dwight asks to braid Jean's hair and she agrees. While he braids, Jean talks about how she never owned a cellphone before and marvels at its ability to both bring people together and push them apart. Dwight demonstrates obvious disdain for his late brother but tears up when talking about him. Jean asks to see the braid and she and Dwight begin to kiss. Gordon enters the stage and opens his mouth to speak, but the lights go out before he can. Act 2 Gordon speaks directly to the audience - outlining what happened the day he died. He expresses his disgust with the current state of the world and confesses he sells organs on the black market for a living. The day he died, he decided he wanted to go to the cafe for a lobster bisque only to find out Jean had ordered the last one, so he gets lentil instead. As he sits watching Jean eat her soup, he begins to suffer a heart attack and tries to think of whom to call. Not satisfied with calling anyone he knows, he dies while watching Jean eat the soup that was supposed to be his. He says she looked like an angel and he was glad she got the last bite. Then he dies. Jean and Dwight hold each other after making love in the closet of the stationery store. Dwight tells her he's been thinking about the letter \\"Z\\" and that it should be their code word if they are ever separated and want to find each other. He confesses that he loves her just as Gordon's cellphone rings. Jean answers it and tells the person on the other end that Gordon is dead. Dwight becomes increasingly frustrated as Jean ignores his pleas for her to hang up. When Jean finally hangs up Dwight tries to forbid her from using the phone anymore. Jean becomes angry and refuses. When the phone rings again she answers to hear Hermia who is calling because she's drunk at a bar and needs a ride home. At the bar, Jean asks Hermia if she'd like to talk about Gordon. Hermia says yes but then begins to divulge extremely intimate details about her and Gordon's sex life to a visibly uncomfortable Jean. Hermia confesses she would often pretend to be someone else when she and Gordon made love, specifically Gordon's mistresses. She accuses Jean of having an affair with Gordon which Jean denies. Hermia begins to break down. Overwhelmed with pity, Jean tells Hermia that Gordon wrote drafts of a letter to her on the day he died. She begins to improvise a love letter which she recites to Hermia. Hermia, now feeling much better, thanks Jean and then lets slip that Gordon sold organs for a living. Jean is appalled. The cellphone rings and Jean answers. A woman on the other end tells her there's a kidney for sale in South Africa and that she'll meet her in the airport of Johannesburg before hanging up. Jean tells Hermia she's going to South Africa to make up for Gordon's mistakes before rushing out. Hermia calls after her, \\"Do you own a gun?\\". Jean arrives at the Johannesburg airport, only to be confronted by Gordon's mistress, now called The Stranger. The Stranger demands Jean give her the cellphone since it has all of Gordon's business contacts on it. When Jean refuses, they struggle and Jean ends up being smacked on the head by the Stranger. When Jean awakens, she's back in the cafe with Gordon sitting next to her - only now he can speak. He tells her she's in his \\"pipeline\\" because, after you die, you go straight to the person you love most. Jean tells Gordon she loved him because she didn't know him and, now that she does, she is horrified to be stuck with him for eternity. Jean says she's suddenly very lonely and Gordon points out that she can listen to cellphone conversations from heaven. Jean hears a bit of her first cellphone conversation with Mrs. Gottlieb and tells Gordon his mother truly loved him most. Gordon suddenly disappears into his mother's pipeline. Jean, left by herself, tries to call Dwight on the cellphone only for it to fail to turn on. In her frustration she yells \\"Z!\\" and wakes up back in the airport in Johannesburg with Dwight waiting for her. Dwight brings Jean back to Mrs. Gottlieb's house and Mrs. Gottlieb tells Jean that Gordon's mistress made off with the cellphone and has taken over Gordon's organ business. Also, Hermia has left to join the Ice Capades. When Mrs. Gottlieb begins to tear up at the thought of everyone moving on but her, Jean tells Mrs. Gottlieb that she's seen Gordon in heaven and that he's waiting for her in her pipeline. Overjoyed, Mrs. Gottlieb runs into the bonfire in the backyard so that she can be with Gordon. Jean is horrified but Dwight is happy his mother and his brother are together again. Jean and Dwight promise to love each other so they can be in each other's pipeline and Dwight offers to show Jean his new printing press saying, \\"Now, we kiss.

Let \\\\mathfrak{g} be a semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero. The theorem states that every finite-dimensional module over \\\\mathfrak{g} is semisimple as a module (i.e., a direct sum of simple modules.) Theorem 10.9  The enveloping algebra is semisimple  Weyl's theorem implies (in fact is equivalent to) that the enveloping algebra of a finite-dimensional representation is a semisimple ring in the following way. Given a finite-dimensional Lie algebra representation \\\\pi: \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{gl}(V), let A \\\\subset \\\\operatorname{End}(V) be the associative subalgebra of the endomorphism algebra of V generated by \\\\pi(\\\\mathfrak g). The ring A is called the enveloping algebra of \\\\pi. If \\\\pi is semisimple, then A is semisimple. (Proof: Since A is a finite-dimensional algebra, it is an Artinian ring; in particular, the Jacobson radical J is nilpotent. If V is simple, then JV \\\\subset V implies that JV = 0. In general, J kills each simple submodule of V; in particular, J kills V and so J is zero.) Conversely, if A is semisimple, then V is a semisimple A-module; i.e., semisimple as a \\\\mathfrak g-module. (Note that a module over a semisimple ring is semisimple since a module is a quotient of a free module and \\"semisimple\\" is preserved under the free and quotient constructions.)  Application: preservation of Jordan decomposition  Here is a typical application. Proof: First we prove the special case of (i) and (ii) when \\\\pi is the inclusion; i.e., \\\\mathfrak g is a subalgebra of \\\\mathfrak{gl}_n = \\\\mathfrak{gl}(V). Let x = S + N be the Jordan decomposition of the endomorphism x, where S, N are semisimple and nilpotent endomorphisms in \\\\mathfrak{gl}_n. Now, \\\\operatorname{ad}_{\\\\mathfrak{gl}_n}(x) also has the Jordan decomposition, which can be shown (see Jordan–Chevalley decomposition#Lie algebras) to respect the above Jordan decomposition; i.e., \\\\operatorname{ad}_{\\\\mathfrak{gl}_n}(S), \\\\operatorname{ad}_{\\\\mathfrak{gl}_n}(N) are the semisimple and nilpotent parts of \\\\operatorname{ad}_{\\\\mathfrak{gl}_n}(x). Since \\\\operatorname{ad}_{\\\\mathfrak{gl}_n}(S), \\\\operatorname{ad}_{\\\\mathfrak{gl}_n}(N) are polynomials in \\\\operatorname{ad}_{\\\\mathfrak{gl}_n}(x) then, we see \\\\operatorname{ad}_{\\\\mathfrak{gl}_n}(S), \\\\operatorname{ad}_{\\\\mathfrak{gl}_n}(N) : \\\\mathfrak g \\\\to \\\\mathfrak g. Thus, they are derivations of \\\\mathfrak{g}. Since \\\\mathfrak{g} is semisimple, we can find elements s, n in \\\\mathfrak{g} such that [y, S] = [y, s], y \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g} and similarly for n. Now, let A be the enveloping algebra of \\\\mathfrak{g}; i.e., the subalgebra of the endomorphism algebra of V generated by \\\\mathfrak g. As noted above, A has zero Jacobson radical. Since [y, N - n] = 0, we see that N - n is a nilpotent element in the center of A. But, in general, a central nilpotent belongs to the Jacobson radical; hence, N = n and thus also S = s. This proves the special case. In general, \\\\pi(x) is semisimple (resp. nilpotent) when \\\\operatorname{ad}(x) is semisimple (resp. nilpotent). This immediately gives (i) and (ii). \\\\square  Proofs   Analytic proof  Weyl's original proof (for complex semisimple Lie algebras) was analytic in nature: it famously used the unitarian trick. Specifically, one can show that every complex semisimple Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} is the complexification of the Lie algebra of a simply connected compact Lie group K. Theorem 6.11 (If, for example, \\\\mathfrak{g}=\\\\mathrm{sl}(n;\\\\mathbb{C}), then K=\\\\mathrm{SU}(n).) Given a representation \\\\pi of \\\\mathfrak{g} on a vector space V, one can first restrict \\\\pi to the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{k} of K. Then, since K is simply connected, Theorem 5.10 there is an associated representation \\\\Pi of K. Integration over K produces an inner product on V for which \\\\Pi is unitary. Theorem 4.28 Complete reducibility of \\\\Pi is then immediate and elementary arguments show that the original representation \\\\pi of \\\\mathfrak{g} is also completely reducible. Algebraic proof 1 Let (\\\\pi, V) be a finite- dimensional representation of a Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g over a field of characteristic zero. The theorem is an easy consequence of Whitehead's lemma, which says V \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Der}(\\\\mathfrak g, V), v \\\\mapsto \\\\cdot v is surjective, where a linear map f: \\\\mathfrak g \\\\to V is a derivation if f([x, y]) = x \\\\cdot f(y) - y \\\\cdot f(x). The proof is essentially due to Whitehead. Let W \\\\subset V be a subrepresentation. Consider the vector subspace L_W \\\\subset \\\\operatorname{End}(V) that consists of all linear maps t: V \\\\to V such that t(V) \\\\subset W and t(W) = 0. It has a structure of a \\\\mathfrak{g}-module given by: for x \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g}, t \\\\in L_W, :x \\\\cdot t = [\\\\pi(x), t]. Now, pick some projection p : V \\\\to V onto W and consider f : \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\to L_W given by f(x) = [p, \\\\pi(x)]. Since f is a derivation, by Whitehead's lemma, we can write f(x) = x \\\\cdot t for some t \\\\in L_W. We then have [\\\\pi(x), p + t] = 0, x \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g}; that is to say p + t is \\\\mathfrak{g}-linear. Also, as t kills W, p + t is an idempotent such that (p + t)(V) = W. The kernel of p + t is then a complementary representation to W. \\\\square See also Weibel's homological algebra book.  Algebraic proof 2  Whitehead's lemma is typically proved by means of the quadratic Casimir element of the universal enveloping algebra, Section 10.3 and there is also a proof of the theorem that uses the Casimir element directly instead of Whitehead's lemma. Since the quadratic Casimir element C is in the center of the universal enveloping algebra, Schur's lemma tells us that C acts as multiple c_\\\\lambda of the identity in the irreducible representation of \\\\mathfrak{g} with highest weight \\\\lambda. A key point is to establish that c_\\\\lambda is nonzero whenever the representation is nontrivial. This can be done by a general argument Section 6.2 or by the explicit formula for c_\\\\lambda. Consider a very special case of the theorem on complete reducibility: the case where a representation V contains a nontrivial, irreducible, invariant subspace W of codimension one. Let C_V denote the action of C on V. Since V is not irreducible, C_V is not necessarily a multiple of the identity, but it is a self-intertwining operator for V. Then the restriction of C_V to W is a nonzero multiple of the identity. But since the quotient V/W is a one dimensional—and therefore trivial—representation of \\\\mathfrak{g}, the action of C on the quotient is trivial. It then easily follows that C_V must have a nonzero kernel—and the kernel is an invariant subspace, since C_V is a self-intertwiner. The kernel is then a one-dimensional invariant subspace, whose intersection with W is zero. Thus, \\\\mathrm{ker}(V_C) is an invariant complement to W, so that V decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible subspaces: :V=W\\\\oplus\\\\mathrm{ker}(C_V). Although this establishes only a very special case of the desired result, this step is actually the critical one in the general argument.  Algebraic proof 3  The theorem can be deduced from the theory of Verma modules, which characterizes a simple module as a quotient of a Verma module by a maximal submodule. This approach has an advantage that it can be used to weaken the finite-dimensionality assumptions (on algebra and representation). Let V be a finite-dimensional representation of a finite- dimensional semisimple Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Let \\\\mathfrak b = \\\\mathfrak{h} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{n}_+ \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{g} be the Borel subalgebra determined by a choice of a Cartan subalgebra and positive roots. Let V^0 = \\\\\\\\{ v \\\\in V  \\\\mathfrak{n}_+(v) = 0 \\\\\\\\}. Then V^0 is an \\\\mathfrak h-module and thus has the \\\\mathfrak h-weight space decomposition: :V^0 = \\\\bigoplus_{\\\\lambda \\\\in L} V^0_{\\\\lambda} where L \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{h}^*. For each \\\\lambda \\\\in L, pick 0 e v_{\\\\lambda} \\\\in V_{\\\\lambda} and V^{\\\\lambda} \\\\subset V the \\\\mathfrak g-submodule generated by v_{\\\\lambda} and V' \\\\subset V the \\\\mathfrak g-submodule generated by V^0. We claim: V = V'. Suppose V e V'. By Lie's theorem, there exists a \\\\mathfrak{b}-weight vector in V/V'; thus, we can find an \\\\mathfrak{h}-weight vector v such that 0 e e_i(v) \\\\in V' for some e_i among the Chevalley generators. Now, e_i(v) has weight \\\\mu + \\\\alpha_i. Since L is partially ordered, there is a \\\\lambda \\\\in L such that \\\\lambda \\\\ge \\\\mu + \\\\alpha_i; i.e., \\\\lambda > \\\\mu. But this is a contradiction since \\\\lambda, \\\\mu are both primitive weights (it is known that the primitive weights are incomparable.). Similarly, each V^{\\\\lambda} is simple as a \\\\mathfrak g-module. Indeed, if it is not simple, then, for some \\\\mu < \\\\lambda, V^0_{\\\\mu} contains some nonzero vector that is not a highest-weight vector; again a contradiction. \\\\square  External links  * A blog post by Akhil Mathew  References  * * * Jacobson, Nathan, Lie algebras, Republication of the 1962 original.

J. Palacio, published on 14 February 2012. R. J. Palacio wrote Wonder after an incident where her son noticed a girl with a severe facial difference and started to cry. Fearing he would react badly, Palacio attempted to remove her son from the situation so as not to upset the girl and her family but ended up worsening the situation. Natalie Merchant's song \\"Wonder\\" made her realize that the incident could illustrate a valuable lesson. Palacio was inspired by Merchant's lyrics and she began writing. She named the book directly after the song, and used the song's chorus as the prologue of the first chapter. Several spin-offs, including the calendar book 365 Days of Wonder: Mr. Browne's Book of Precepts and Auggie and Me have been published. A film adaptation was released in 2017. Plot The book begins with the words: \\"You could say I'm just like any normal kid. I have a family, I have a computer, I have an Xbox\\". August \\"Auggie\\" Pullman then talks about his family, and then it skips to: \\"My name is August. I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse\\". Auggie Pullman is a home-schooled fifth-grader living in North River Heights in Upper Manhattan with his parents. He has a medical condition, often equated with Treacher Collins syndrome, which has left his face disfigured. Due to his condition, August has been home-schooled by his mother; however, wanting him to experience a larger world, his parents enroll him into Beecher Prep, a private school, for the start of fifth grade. Auggie has a sister, Olivia \\"Via\\" Pullman, who is older than he is and often puts her brother's needs before her own. Before his first day of school, Auggie's mother takes Auggie to the school to meet the principal, Mr. Tushman, who also invites three other students — Jack Will, Charlotte and Julian — to take him around, and help him start getting the feeling of what it's like to be with other people. Auggie is immediately bullied by Julian, who acts \\"like an angel\\" in front of teachers. Jack and Charlotte instantly start defending him, but Auggie still doesn't feel comfortable around Julian. On his first day of school, Auggie tries not to draw attention to himself. His efforts are in vain, and Julian and his friends immediately start bullying him about his appearance. August's hopes for the school year are later raised slightly when he forms friendships with classmates Jack and Summer, both of whom defend him from Julian's taunts. The situation comes to a head on Halloween when Auggie, disguised as Ghostface when he had told Jack he would be Boba Fett, overhears Jack joining in with the bullying. As August isolates himself from his classmates and family, his sister Olivia's frustration grows, fueled by years of feeling ignored by her family. Returning to school, Auggie ignores Jack but admits to Summer that he had overheard the incident. Jack feels ashamed for his actions, and punches Julian in the mouth, causing him to get suspended from school. Over the winter break, Jack reconciles with Auggie, telling him the truth of how he didn't mean any of the words he had said. As the school year progresses, the bullying Auggie faces becomes more serious and extends to Jack as well. Julian manipulates several friends into turning against August and Jack. In addition, Julian's mother voices her concerns over Auggie attending the school, citing that his appearance may be too much of a burden for the other students to handle. Via confides in her mother that she does not want Auggie to attend her school play, as she had found comfort in the fact that nobody at her new school knew about her brother's condition. August overhears and storms out of the room angrily, upset that his sister too is ashamed to let her new friends see him. Meanwhile, Via's best friend Miranda has started avoiding her, for reasons unknown to Via. Both Miranda and Via audition for the lead in their school play and Miranda gets the part. However, on opening night, Miranda sees Via's family in the audience and feigns illness so Via, her understudy, can play the lead. It is revealed that Miranda (an only child upset by her parents' divorce) felt isolated at summer camp and pretended Auggie was her brother, gaining sympathy and friendship from other campers. Miranda's guilt over this deception had led her to avoid Via, but allowing Via to take the lead role provided a way for the two friends to reconcile. Via's family celebrates by taking both girls out for dinner. At the end of Auggie's school year, the students are invited on a three-day trip to a nature reserve. Auggie is initially concerned about going. However, upon hearing that Julian will not be attending (because of being suspended for two weeks for his behavior), August decides to join his friends on the trip. He has fun until the last night, when he and Jack go exploring in the woods. They are attacked by seventh graders who mock Auggie and start to beat him and Jack, but Julian's friends find them and fight off the bullies. Auggie starts to feel closer to the other students after this ordeal. With summer vacation approaching, Auggie is relieved to hear that Julian will not be returning to Beecher Prep. At graduation, August is awarded the 'Henry Ward Beecher Medal' for being 'notable or exemplary in certain areas throughout the school year'. Extremely proud of her son, August's mother comments that he is a 'wonder'. Reception Critical reception The book received positive reviews from critics. The parent resource Common Sense Media gave Wonder four out of five stars, calling it a \\"Moving, uplifting tale about a disfigured boy with inner beauty\\". Entertainment Weekly said: \\"In a wonder of a debut, Palacio has written a crackling page-turner filled with characters you can't help but root for\\". The New York Times called it, \\"Rich and memorable [...] It's Auggie and the rest of the children who are the real heart of Wonder, and Palacio captures the voices of girls and boys, fifth graders, and teenagers, with equal skill\\". Awards Wonder was on The New York Times Best Seller list and was also on the Texas Bluebonnet Award master list. The book was the winner of the 2014 Maine Student Book Award, Vermont's Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award, the 2015 Mark Twain Award, Hawaii's 2015 Nene Award, and the Junior Young Reader's Choice Award for 2015. In Illinois, it won both the Bluestem and Caudill Awards in 2014. Sales The novel, written in English, has been translated into 29 other languages for worldwide sales: Spanish, Catalan, Japanese, German, French, Portuguese, Danish, Czech, Serbian, Arabic, Hebrew, Norwegian, Icelandic, Swedish, Faroese, Turkish, Dutch, Persian, Italian, Finnish, Russian, Korean, Chinese, Ukrainian, Polish, Croatian, Greek, Romanian, Vietnamese and Slovenian.

He was also a creative writer in the Symbolist tradition and the author of books on a variety of topics, most notably the Shakespeare authorship question. Early life From a working- class background, Demblon studied at the École normale of Liège. He was soon working as a teacher in the town but came into conflict with the educational authorities because of his uninhibited discussion of political issues with students. He was accused of promoting socialism to school children, and of attacking the king. He was dismissed from his post. Demblon obtained work as a lecturer at the Université nouvelle in Brussels, which had been created in 1894 by left-wingers, including anarchists and socialists originally from the Université libre de Bruxelles (Free University of Brussels). It was an independent and self-managed educational institution. Politics Demblon embarked on a political career in 1894, standing in the legislative elections of that year against the former Liberal prime minister Walthère Frère-Orban as a Socialist candidate. The young teacher defeated the former prime minister, taking his seat in the House of Representatives. Demblon was noted for forthright views, in particular a strong anti-clericism. His distaste for the Catholic church was expressed in pamphlets with titles such as \\"La pornographie cléricale\\", which provoked a debate in the legislature about Demblon's claim that the Bible was full of pornographic passages.Carl Strikwerda, A House Divided: Catholics, Socialists, and Flemish Nationalists in Nineteenth-Century Belgium, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2000, p.202-8. Demblon also promoted Walloon ethnic identity within Belgium, at one point insisting that a Walloon should be appointed to a job teaching design because \\"teaching given by a Walloon will be more profitable for the students ... the picturesque vision characteristic of the Walloon race is very different from that of the Flemish painters.\\"Wolfgang Cortjaens, \\"Dismantlement or Reformation? The Dialectic of Identity in Nineteenth Century Liege\\", in Duchesne, J. P. & Graulich, Isabelle et al, Historism and Cultural Identity in the Rhine-Meuse Region, Leuven University Press, 2008, p.331. His opposition to the \\"flamangistes\\" was linked to a belief in the importance of French cultural identity. He also opposed proponents of the Walloon dialect for the same reason. In 1887 he objected to official support for \\"patois\\", writing that \\"the powerful and lucid young people who have just appeared as if by magic in Wallonia will most certainly take their place enthusiastically before the great organ of the French language\\"Hess, E., \\"The Symbolist Movement in Belgium\\" in A. A. Balakian, The Symbolist movement in the literature of European languages, John Benjamins Publishing, 1984, p. 570. In 1896, during a major strike, Demblon created the Fédération liégeoise du Parti ouvrier belge (Liege Federation of the Belgian Workers Party), becoming its first member. The POB (Parti ouvrier belge), as it was known, was designed as an alliance of radical groups promoting a consensus socialist political vision. The syndicalist César De Paepe inspired the party vision, but Demblon became its principal spokesman. During World War I, Demblon distanced himself from the nationalist wing of the Belgian left. Declaring his solidarity with international socialist values, he wrote, \\"Whoever is hungry has no country anywhere; the poor have no homeland, they have nothing to lose in this war because they have nothing.\\"French: «Celui qui a faim, n'a nulle part une patrie, les pauvres n'ont pas de patrie, ils n'ont rien à perdre dans cette guerre parce qu'ils n'ont rien.», \\"Le dernier appel de Célestin Demblon\\", La Vague de Jupille. While Belgium was under German occupation, Demblon devoted himself to writing. He escaped to France in 1915, where he gave lectures, often with Ève Francis. After the war he revived his role as a leader of the Fédération liégeoise, but soon fell out with other members of the leadership, as he showed increasing sympathy for Communism, in particular expressing support for the Russian Revolution. He wrote, \\"I am for the Russian revolution, which is a stronghold for the working class of the world. Without this fortress, without this revolution, the bourgeoisie would not make concessions on social security to the POB. 'Social security' has been thrown by the bourgeoisie at the head of the workers in panicked fear of Bolshevism in our country, as one throws a bone to a dangerous dog.\\"French: «Je suis pour la révolution russe, qui constitue une forteresse pour la classe ouvrière du monde entier. Sans cette forteresse, sans cette révolution, la bourgeoisie n'aurait pas fait de concessions concernant la sécurité sociale au POB. Une sécurité sociale que la bourgeoisie jette à la tête des travailleurs par peur panique du bolchevisme dans notre pays, comme on jette un os à un chien dangereux.» He was expelled from the POB on a technicality (failure to promptly pay membership fees), as the leadership were unable to secure enough support for his removal from ordinary members. Demblon then became associated with the Communists, but died suddenly before coming to an agreement to stand in an election. After his death from influenza in 1924, the Communists and the Liège Federation POB vied to identify themselves with his memory. The two factions constructed competing monuments to him in the Cimetière de Robermont. Writings In addition to political polemics, Demblon wrote works on a variety of scholarly and topical subjects. He became known internationally for his writings on the Shakespeare authorship question, in which he promoted the claims of Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland. These views were expounded in Lord Rutland est Shakespeare (1912) and L'Auteur d'Hamlet et son monde (1914).Shapiro, James, Contested Will: Who Wrote Shakespeare?, Faber & Faber, 2011, p.345; Paul Edmondson, Stanley Wells (ed), Shakespeare Beyond Doubt: Evidence, Argument, Controversy, Cambridge University Press, 2013, p.53. He also published French translations of several of Shakespeare's tragedies. Demblon wrote creative literature influenced by the Symbolist movement. His collection of short stories Contes mélancoliques was published in 1883. He also published occasional poetry. He wrote regularly for Albert Mockel's journal La Wallonie. His book La Guerre à Liège (1915) is an account of the effect of the early stages of World War I on the area. La Belgique à la France was about the relationship between French and Belgian identity.

When the Adelantado began the conquest and colonization of Florida in 1565, Miranda joined his staff. While the peninsula of Florida and neighboring regions were explored and conquered, Miranda was directed to stay in the capital of the colony, St. Augustine. Then, in 1566, the Adelantado selected Miranda to accompany him in pursuit of pirates in the Caribbean.  Governorship  When Miranda arrived in Florida, he began working to eliminate corruption. He found that former Governor Diego de Velasco had appropriated large sums of money from Menéndez de Avilés, claiming that Menéndez de Avilés had owed him money at the time of his death. Miranda imprisoned Velasco and replaced him in the government of Santa Elena with one of his lieutenants, Alonso Solís. Velasco's treasurer, Bertolomeo Martinez, supported the allegations against him. However, Martinez was himself briefly imprisoned, as Miranda suspected that he had been complicit in Velasco's crimes.

He participated in the defense of the town of Melilla when it was besieged by the Moors. Governor of Florida King Carlos II of Spain named Zúñiga Governor and Captain General of Spanish Florida on January 30, 1699. The oath of office with instructions concerning the responsibilities of his appointment was administered by the court of the Casa de Contratación (in English: House of Trade) in Seville, on May 20, 1699. He was given a license to carry four slaves, and he sailed to New Spain in the fleet commanded by General Manuel de Velasco y Tejada on May 23, 1699. Zúñiga was governor of Florida from 1699 until 1706.

Life He was born in Glasgow on 9 June 1836, was second of three sons of Alexander Dunlop Anderson, M.D. medical practitioner in Glasgow, who in 1852 was president of the faculty of physicians and surgeons of Glasgow, by his wife Sara, daughter of Thomas McCall of Craighead, Lanarkshire. His father's family was descended on the maternal side from William Dunlop, principal of Glasgow University, 1690-1700; and in the male line from John Anderson (1668-1721), the stout defender of presbyterianism, and collaterally from John Anderson (1726-1796), founder of the Andersonian Institute, Glasgow. After early education in Edinburgh, Anderson entered Glasgow University to study medicine. There in April 1858 he graduated M.D. with honours, and became a licentiate and fellow of the faculty of physicians and surgeons of Glasgow. Two years were spent as resident physician in the Glasgow Royal Infirmary ; two more in travel and medical study at Paris, Würzburg, Berlin, Vienna, and Dublin. On returning home he was speedily appointed lecturer on practice of medicine in the Andersonian Institute and, not long after, physician to the royal infirmary. There the lucidity and skill of his clinical teaching attracted large numbers of students. In 1861, a hospital and dispensary were founded at Glasgow for diseases of the skin. Anderson and Dr. Andrew Buchanan were appointed the first two physicians. Buchanan died prematurely in 1865. For forty-seven years Anderson bore the main share of the duty. In 1909, the institute was absorbed by the western infirmary, and the dermatological teaching was provided for by the foundation of a lectureship at the university, on which Anderson's name was conferred in recognition of his services. Meanwhile, in 1874, Anderson was appointed to a newly founded chair of clinical medicine in Glasgow University. He held this post till 1900 in conjunction with that of physician to the western infirmary. His clear and systematic method of exposition and demonstration, his strict concentration on the subject in hand, and his organising power enabled him to fulfil his functions with admirable efficiency. From 1897 to 1901, he was examiner in medicine and pathology for the British and Indian medical services. In 1900, he succeeded Sir William Tennant Gairdner, in the chair of practice of medicine, and removed from his house in Woodside Terrace to the official residence in the college square. The practical aspects of his subject chiefly appealed to him. The physician's business, he insisted, was to cure the sick. But he took a high view of the moral responsibilities of a medical adviser, and never suffered his pupils to forget that medicine is a liberal profession as well as a useful art. For many years Anderson engaged in extensive consulting practice. His opinion was especially valued, not only in skin diseases, in which he long specialized and his eminence in which was recognised in England and on the Continent, but also in consumption, in the curability as well as in the prevention of which he was a believer, and in certain forms of paralysis. In 1903 he was appointed university representative on the general medical council ; he was knighted in 1905 ; in 1906 was entertained at a public dinner by representatives of the medical profession in the west of Scotland, including many former pupils and assistants ; in 1908 he was made honorary physician to the king in Scotland. A conservative in politics, and in religion a member of the Church of Scotland, Anderson was genial in society and obliging in disposition. He died suddenly on 25 January 1908, after speaking at the dinner of the Glasgow Ayrshire Society. He was honoured with a public funeral in the Glasgow Necropolis. A memorial to his memory also exists on the inner north wall of Glasgow Cathedral at the foot of the Necroplis. Family Anderson married on 20 July 1864 Margaret Richardson, daughter of Alexander Ronaldson, merchant, Glasgow, and left one son, Thomas, who practised medical at New York. There is a good portrait of Anderson in possession of his widow. Works Anderson's chief publications were: # The Parasitic Affections of the Skin, 1861; 2nd edit. 1868. # On Psoriasis and Lepra, 1865. # On Eczema, 1867, 3rd edit. 1874. # Treatment of the Diseases of the Skin, with an Analysis of 11,000 Consecutive Cases, 1872. # Lectures on Clinical Medicine, 1877. # Curability of Attacks of Tubercular Peritonitis and Acute Phthisis (Galloping Consumption), 1877. # A Treatise on Diseases of the Skin, 1887; 2nd edit. 1894. # On Syphilite Affections of the Nervous System, their Diagnosis and Treatment, 1889.

H. C. Whitehead) represent a series of statements regarding representation theory of finite- dimensional, semisimple Lie algebras in characteristic zero. Historically, they are regarded as leading to the discovery of Lie algebra cohomology. One usually makes the distinction between Whitehead's first and second lemma for the corresponding statements about first and second order cohomology, respectively, but there are similar statements pertaining to Lie algebra cohomology in arbitrary orders which are also attributed to Whitehead. The first Whitehead lemma is an important step toward the proof of Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility. Statements Without mentioning cohomology groups, one can state Whitehead's first lemma as follows: Let \\\\mathfrak{g} be a finite-dimensional, semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero, V a finite-dimensional module over it, and f\\\\colon \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\to V a linear map such that :f([x, y]) = xf(y) - yf(x). Then there exists a vector v \\\\in V such that f(x) = xv for all x \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g}. In terms of Lie algebra cohomology, this is, by definition, equivalent to the fact that H^1(\\\\mathfrak{g},V) = 0 for every such representation. The proof uses a Casimir element (see the proof below). Similarly, Whitehead's second lemma states that under the conditions of the first lemma, also H^2(\\\\mathfrak{g},V) = 0. Another related statement, which is also attributed to Whitehead, describes Lie algebra cohomology in arbitrary order: Given the same conditions as in the previous two statements, but further let V be irreducible under the \\\\mathfrak{g}-action and let \\\\mathfrak{g} act nontrivially, so \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\cdot V eq 0. Then H^q(\\\\mathfrak{g},V) = 0 for all q \\\\geq 0.  Proof  As above, let \\\\mathfrak{g} be a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero and \\\\pi: \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{gl}(V) a finite-dimensional representation (which is semisimple but the proof does not use that fact). Let \\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\operatorname{ker}(\\\\pi) \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{g}_1 where \\\\mathfrak{g}_1 is an ideal of \\\\mathfrak{g}. Then, since \\\\mathfrak{g}_1 is semisimple, the trace form (x, y) \\\\mapsto \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\pi(x)\\\\pi(y)), relative to \\\\pi, is nondegenerate on \\\\mathfrak{g}_1. Let e_i be a basis of \\\\mathfrak{g}_1 and e^i the dual basis with respect to this trace form. Then define the Casimir element c by :c = \\\\sum_i e_i e^i, which is an element of the universal enveloping algebra of \\\\mathfrak g_1. Via \\\\pi, it acts on V as a linear endomorphism (namely, \\\\pi(c) = \\\\sum_i \\\\pi(e_i) \\\\circ \\\\pi(e^i) : V \\\\to V.) The key property is that it commutes with \\\\pi(\\\\mathfrak{g}) in the sense \\\\pi(x)\\\\pi(c) = \\\\pi(c)\\\\pi(x) for each element x \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g}. Also, \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\pi(c)) = \\\\sum \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\pi(e_i)\\\\pi(e^i)) = \\\\dim \\\\mathfrak{g}_1. Now, by Fitting's lemma, we have the vector space decomposition V = V_0 \\\\oplus V_1 such that \\\\pi(c) : V_i \\\\to V_i is a (well-defined) nilpotent endomorphism for i = 0 and is an automorphism for i = 1. Since \\\\pi(c) commutes with \\\\pi(\\\\mathfrak{g}), each V_i is a \\\\mathfrak{g}-submodule. Hence, it is enough to prove the lemma separately for V = V_0 and V = V_1. First, suppose \\\\pi(c) is a nilpotent endomorphism. Then, by the early observation, \\\\dim(\\\\mathfrak{g}/\\\\operatorname{ker}(\\\\pi)) = \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\pi(c)) = 0; that is, \\\\pi is a trivial representation. Since \\\\mathfrak{g} = [\\\\mathfrak{g}, \\\\mathfrak{g}], the condition on f implies that f(x) = 0 for each x \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g}; i.e., the zero vector v = 0 satisfies the requirement. Second, suppose \\\\pi(c) is an automorphism. For notational simplicity, we will drop \\\\pi and write x v = \\\\pi(x)v. Also let (\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot) denote the trace form used earlier. Let w = \\\\sum e_i f(e^i), which is a vector in V. Then :x w = \\\\sum_i e_i x f(e^i) + \\\\sum_i [x, e_i] f(e^i). Now, :[x, e_i] = \\\\sum_j ([x, e_i], e^j) e_j = -\\\\sum_j ([x, e^j], e_i) e_j and, since [x, e^j] = \\\\sum_i ([x, e^j], e_i) e^i, the second term of the expansion of xw is :-\\\\sum_j e_j f([x, e^j]) = -\\\\sum_i e_i (x f(e^i) - e^i f(x)). Thus, :x w = \\\\sum_i e_i e^i f(x) = c f(x). Since c is invertible and c^{-1} commutes with x, the vector v = c^{-1}w has the required property. \\\\square  Notes   References  * Jacobson, Nathan, Lie algebras, Republication of the 1962 original.

Male Aggression and Sexual Coercion of Females in Nonhuman Primates and Other Mammals: Evidence and Theoretical Implications. Advances in the Study of Behavior 22 (1993) Such behavior has been compared to sexual assault, including rape, among humans.Stamos, David N., Evolution and the Big Questions: Sex, Race, Religion, and Other Matters, John Wiley & Sons, 2011; Alcock, John, The Triumph of Sociobiology, Oxford University Press, 2003, p.207-9. In nature, males and females usually differ in reproductive fitness optima.Han, C. S. & Jablonski, P. G. Female genitalia concealment promotes intimate male courtship in a water strider. PLoS ONE 4, e5793 (2009). Males generally prefer to maximize their number of offspring, and therefore their number of mates; females, on the other hand, tend to care more for their offspring and have fewer mates.Gage, M. J. G., Parker, G. a, Nylin, S. & Wiklund, C. Sexual selection and speciation in mammals, butterflies and spiders. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 269, 2309–16 (2002). Because of this, there are generally more males available to mate at a given time, making females a limited resource. This leads males to evolve aggressive mating behaviors which can help them acquire mates.Grayson, K. L., De Lisle, S. P., Jackson, J. E., Black, S. J. & Crespi, E. J. Behavioral and physiological female responses to male sex ratio bias in a pond-breeding amphibian. Frontiers in zoology 9, 24 (2012). Sexual coercion has been observed in many species, including mammals, birds, insects, and fish.Garner, S. R., Bortoluzzi, R. N., Heath, D. D. & Neff, B. D. Sexual conflict inhibits female mate choice for major histocompatibility complex dissimilarity in Chinook salmon. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 277, 885–94 (2010). While sexual coercion does help increase male fitness, it is very often costly to females. Sexual coercion has been observed to have consequences, such as intersexual coevolution, speciation, and sexual dimorphism.Rönn, J., Katvala, M. & Arnqvist, G. Coevolution between harmful male genitalia and female resistance in seed beetles. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 104, 10921–5 (2007). Male adaptations Harassment/aggression Harassment is a technique used by males of many species to force females to submit to mating.Muller, M. N., Kahlenberg, S. M., Emery Thompson, M. & Wrangham, R. W. Male coercion and the costs of promiscuous mating for female chimpanzees. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 274, 1009–14 (2007). It has been observed in numerous species, including mammals, birds, insects and fish. Aggression and harassment have been documented in the males of guppies (Poecilia reticulata), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), botos (Inia geoffrensis), dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), Hector's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori), grizzly bears, polar bears, and ungulates.Fury, C. A., Ruckstuhl, K. E. & Harrison, P. L. Spatial and social sexual segregation patterns in indo-pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus). PLoS ONE 8, e52987 (2013). It is also seen in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), red-spotted newts (Notophthalmus viridescens), and seed-eating true bugs (Neacoryphus spp.).Valero, A., Macías Garcia, C. & Magurran, A. E. Heterospecific harassment of native endangered fishes by invasive guppies in Mexico. Biology letters 4, 149–52 (2008). Furthermore, it is prevalent in spider monkeys, wild Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) and many other primates.McFarland, R. & Majolo, B. Grooming coercion and the post-conflict trading of social services in wild Barbary macaque s. PLoS ONE 6, e26893 (2011). In basically all major primate taxa, aggression is used by the dominant males when herding females and keeping them away from other males. In hamadryas baboons, the males often bite the females’ necks and threaten them.Nitsch, F., Stueckle, S., Stahl, D. & Zinner, D. Copulation patterns in captive hamadryas baboons: a quantitative analysis. Primates; journal of primatology 52, 373–83 (2011). Wild chimpanzees can charge at females, shake branches, hit, slap, kick, pound, drag, and bite them. Orangutans are among the most forceful of mammals. Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) exhibited aggression in almost 90 percent of their copulations, including when the females were not resisting.Knott, C. D., Emery Thompson, M., Stumpf, R. M. & McIntyre, M. H. Female reproductive strategies in orangutans, evidence for female choice and counterstrategies to infanticide in a species with frequent sexual coercion. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 277, 105–13 (2010). A possible explanation for aggressive behaviors in primates is that it is a way for males to train females to be afraid of them and be more likely to surrender to future sexual advances. Intimidation Males may also use more indirect techniques to mate with females, such as intimidation. While most female water striders (Gerridae) have their genitalia exposed, females of the water strider species Gerris gracilicornis have evolved a shield over their genitals. As a result, males cannot physically coerce females because mating is difficult unless the female exposes her genitalia. Therefore, males intimidate females into mating by attracting predators; they tap on the water's surface and create ripples that catch the attention of predatory fish. From there, it is in the best interest of the female to mate, and as quickly as possible, to avoid being eaten by predators. Typical mating positions of water striders have the females on the bottom, closer to predators, so the risk of predation is much higher for them. Females succumb to copulation to get males to cease signaling to predators.Han, C. S. & Jablonski, P. G. Male water striders attract predators to intimidate females into copulation. Nature Communications 1, 52 (2010). Another indirect form of sexual coercion occurs in red-sided garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis. When males \\"court\\" females, they line their bodies up to the females' and produce caudocephalic waves, which are a series of muscle contractions that travel through their bodies from tail to head. The exact reason for this behavior is unknown, but some studies show that it relates to stress. Females have nonrespiratory air sacs containing anoxic air, and the waving pushes this air into her lungs. The resulting stress causes her cloaca to open, and aids the male in inserting his hemipenis. The stronger and more frequent the caudocephalic waves and the closer the male's cloaca to the female's, the more likely the male is to mate successfully.Shine, R., Langkilde, T. & Mason, R. T. Courtship tactics in garter snakes: how do a male’s morphology and behaviour influence his mating success? Animal Behaviour 67, 477–483 (2004) Grasping and grappling Males of certain species have evolved mating behaviors in which they forcefully attempt to mate with and inseminate females, often employing grasping techniques. These male grasping devices exist to increase the duration of copulation and restrict females from mating with other males. They are in some ways a form of mate guarding. While some males have evolved different types of modifications to aid in grasping, others just grab females and attempt to force copulation. One type of grasping modification is spiky male genitalia. In seed beetles (Coleoptera: Bruchidae), males possess sclerotized spines on their genitalia. These spines are used during copulation to help overcome female resistance and penetrate into their copulatory duct. In addition to aiding penetration, these spines promote the passage of seminal fluids, and act as an anchor to keep the female from fleeing. Furthermore, spiny genitals can injure the females and make them less likely to remate. Sepsidae fly males have modifications on their forelegs to help them grasp onto female wing bases. These modifications include cuticular outgrowths, indentations, and bristles, and males use them to secure themselves onto females after jumping on them. Once the males grab on, a struggle ensues akin to a rodeo, where males try to hold on while females violently shake them off.Puniamoorthy, N., Su, K. F.-Y. & Meier, R. Bending for love: losses and gains of sexual dimorphisms are strictly correlated with changes in the mounting position of sepsid flies (Sepsidae: Diptera). BMC Evolutionary Biology 8, 155 (2008). Another type of modification is found in male diving beetles (of the family Dytiscidae), who are equipped with suction cup structures on their front legs. They use these to grab passing females and attach to their dorsal surfaces. To get the females to submit, males shake the females violently and keep them submerged underwater (diving beetles cannot go long without atmospheric oxygen). Unable to get air, female diving beetles submit to the male's advances in order to avoid drowning (and they lose the energy to resist). Once the males attach, copulation can occur.Bergsten, J. & Miller, K. B. Phylogeny of diving beetles reveals a coevolutionary arms race between the sexes. PLoS ONE 2, e522 (2007). Male waterfowl have developed another modification; while most male birds have no external genitalia, male waterfowl (Aves: Anatidae) have a phallus (length ). Most birds mate with the males balancing on top of the females and touching cloacas in a “cloacal kiss”; this makes forceful insemination very difficult. The phallus that male waterfowl have evolved everts out of their bodies (in a clockwise coil) and aids in inseminating females without their cooperation.Brennan, P. L. R. et al. Coevolution of male and female genital morphology in waterfowl. PLoS ONE 2, e418 (2007). Another such technique is having a \\"lock-like\\" mechanism, found in Drosophila montana, dogs, wolves, and pigs. Towards the end of copulation, females struggle to try to dislodge the males, whose genital organs take much longer to deflate than females do; the locking (most commonly known in canids as a \\"tie\\") allows the males to copulate for as long as they need to until they are finished. In dogs, the male has a knot in his penis that gets engorged with blood and ties the female, locking them together during copulation, until the act is complete. Male dogs have evolved this mechanism during mating in order to prevent other males from penetration whilst they are and the use of the tie enables them to be more likely to inseminate the female and produce a healthy litter of pups. Breaking this \\"tie\\" can be physically harmful to both females and males.Mazzi, D., Kesäniemi, J., Hoikkala, A. & Klappert, K. Sexual conflict over the duration of copulation in Drosophila montana: why is longer better? BMC Evolutionary Biology 9, 132 (2009). Males of many species simply grab the females and force a mating. Coercive mating is very common in water striders (Gerridae) because in most of the species, the female genitalia are often exposed and easily accessible to males. Without any courtship behavior, males initiate by forcefully trying to mount the females. Carrying the males on their backs is energetically costly to females, so they try to resist and throw off the males. The males fight back even harder and use their forelegs to tightly grasp the female's thorax and keep them from escaping.Han, C. S., Jablonski, P. G., Kim, B. & Park, F. C. Size-assortative mating and sexual size dimorphism are predictable from simple mechanics of mate-grasping behavior. BMC Evolutionary Biology 10, 359 (2010). The males then forcefully insert their genitalia into the female vulvar opening. In the newt species Notophthalmus viridescens, males carry out a courtship behavior called amplexus. It consists of males capturing females that do not want to mate with them and using their hind limbs to grasp the females by their pectoral regions. Male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) have been observed to forcefully copulate with females by trying to insert their gonopodium (male sex organ) into female's genital pores, whether or not they are accepting. Sometimes, male guppies also try to forcefully mate with Skiffia bilineata (goodeid) females, which resemble guppy females and tend to share the same habitat, even when guppy females are available. A possible explanation for this is the deeper genital cavity of S. bilineata, which stimulates the males more than when mating with guppy females. Males of some species are able to immobilize females and force copulation. In pigs and boars, males grab females and maneuver the pelvis to lift the vaginal opening and facilitate copulation. The stimulation following intromission causes the female to be immobilized. The male can then freely continue copulation without worrying about the female escaping.Zehr, J. L. NIH Public Access. 41, 101–112 (2005). Immobilization of the female also occurs in muscovy ducks. Grasping and/or grappling mating situations have also been documented in Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis haemorrhoidalis (Odonata),Rivera, a C. & Andrés, J. a Male coercion and convenience polyandry in a calopterygid damselfly.

Evolution of Multilevel Social Systems in Nonhuman Primates and Humans. International journal of primatology 33, 1002–1037 (2012). and many other primates, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and others. Infanticide In some mammal species, mostly nonhuman primates, it is common for males to commit infanticide to mate with females. This happens often in species that live in groups, such as Old and New World monkeys, apes, prosimians, and hamadryas baboons. There is usually a single breeding male in a group, and when an outside male aggressively takes over, he kills off all of the young offspring. The males kill infants that are not their own to assert their strength and position, and mate with the females. Sometimes, multiple males will invade a troop and gang up on females, killing their offspring and subsequently mating with them. This occurs in spider monkeys, red-backed squirrel monkeys, chimpanzees, and red howlers. Secretions In the newt species Notophthalmus viridescens, the males rub off hormonal secretions onto the skin of the females they are courting. These hormones have been shown to make the female more receptive to mating with the male. When the male deposits the secretions, he detaches from the female and releases a spermatophore (containing spermatozoa). It is then the female's decision to either accept it and pick it up or reject it by running away; these hormones make her more likely to accept it. Coercive faithfulness =Post-copulatory guarding= Another form of coercion is male mate guarding, used to keep females from mating with other males, and often involves aggression. Guarding allows the males to assure their paternity. A classic example occurs in diving beetles, family Dytiscidae. After copulation, males continue to guard females for up to six hours. They hold them underwater, occasionally tilting them up for air. Guarding also occurs in water striders where, once males complete their sperm transfer, they often remain on top of the females. This guarding duration varies, lasting from several minutes to several weeks. The purpose of such long guarding periods is for the males to see the females lay their eggs and be assured that the offspring are theirs. This behavior also occurs in hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas), where the leader males practice intensive mate guarding. In Drosophila Montana, studies have shown that following mate guarding, the chances of a female mating with or being inseminated by another male were greatly diminished. This shows that the mate guarding tactic can be very effective. =Secretions/ejaculations= Males of some species use bodily fluids, such as seminal fluid from their ejaculate, to aid in the coercion of females. Seminal fluid in males of Drosophila melanogaster may contain chemicals that increase the amount of time it takes for females to remate, decrease the length of successive matings, or keep her from remating at all. The less a female mates with other males after copulation with a male, the more likely it is for him to ensure his paternity. These chemicals may also serve to increase the female's reproductive success, but at the cost of decreased longevity and immune response. In many species, seminal fluid can be used as a sort of mating plug. Males of these species transfer their sperm at the beginning of copulation and use the rest of copulation to transfer substances that help build up the mating plugs. These plugs are effective in ensuring that the female does not mate with any other males and that the male's paternity is secured. Costs to females Direct A major direct cost of sexual coercion is physical injury. Male seed beetles (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) have sclerotized spine on their genitalia, which penetrate the female and leave melanized scars. Females can be physically injured from just one mating, and the more a female mates, the more scarring forms in the copulatory duct. In guppies, the male's gonopodium can cause damage when forcefully inserted, causing cloacal damage to the females. In fowl, females can be physically injured during forceful copulations. Also, semen transferred from the males can contain pathogens and fecal matter, which can lead to disease and decrease female fitness. In elephant seals, physical injury happens very often. In fact, mating leads to 1 in every 1,000 female elephant seals getting killed. Other species in which the females (and/or their offspring) are injured or even killed include lions, rodents, farm cats, crabeater seals, elephant seals, sea lions, bottle-nosed dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), red-sided garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis), and newts (N. viridescens). Another cost is the excess energy and time expenditure that comes with mating. For example, female water striders, Gerridae, and marine snails of the genus Littorina 24 have to carry the males on their backs while they mate. First of all, this is a great loss of energy. Second, both the male and the female are at a much greater risk of predation in this position. Furthermore, the time spent mating interferes with the time that could have been spent foraging and feeding.Darden, S. K., James, R., Ramnarine, I. W. & Croft, D. P. Social implications of the battle of the sexes: sexual harassment disrupts female sociality and social recognition. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 276, 2651–6 (2009). In addition, sexual coercion can lower body condition and immunity in ways other than physical damage. Harassment can lead to stress, which can result in weight loss, decreased immune function and energy stores, and less feeding, which has been seen in red-spotted newts. Furthermore, when females are constantly moving around to avoid violent males, they are not able to form female social ties (for example, Grévy's zebra/Equus grevyi). This also happens in species where herding males sometimes do not permit females to join their family in different groups, like in hamadryas baboons. Indirect Indirect costs are those that affect females in the future. One such cost happens because sexual coercion does not allow females to choose the males they want to mate with, which are usually males that are higher quality, compatible, and/or have good genes that will increase their offspring's survival and fitness. Coercion decreases this choice and can lead to their offspring having lower genetic quality. Studies of the rose bitterling (Rhodeus ocellatus), have shown that offspring of females with mate choice had higher survival rates than offspring of females that did not. Another ultimate cost comes from when males commit infanticide to obtain mating access. This loss of offspring leads to a decrease in fitness of females. Female counter-adaptations Anatomical protection As a response to sexual coercion and the costs that females face, one of their counter-adaptations is the evolution of anatomical protection. Females of some species, such as the water striders, developed morphological shields to protect their genitalia from males that want to forcefully copulate. Some Gerridae females have also evolved abdominal spines and altered the shapes of their abdomens to make them less accessible to males. Waterfowl males of the family Aves: Anatidae have evolved a phallus to aid in coercion. This phallus everts out of the male body (when it's time to mate) in a counter-clockwise coil. As a response, females have developed vaginal structures called dead end sacs and clockwise coils to protect themselves from forceful intromission. Waterfowl females have evolved these “convoluted vaginal morphologies” to make it harder for males to insert themselves without the female's consent.Brennan, P. L. R., Clark, C. J. & Prum, R. O. Explosive eversion and functional morphology of the duck penis supports sexual conflict in waterfowl genitalia. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 277, 1309–14 (2010). Male avoidance/habitat change Another female tactic to counter coercion is to try to avoid males that may cause them harm. To do this, females often change their habitats to get away from aggressive males, as is seen in wild Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Female bottlenose dolphins behave in similar ways by moving into shallow waters where there are not too many males. Other species that practice mate avoidance are Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis, a species of damselfly, who often try to hide from large groups of males to avoid harassment. Females of the marine intertidal periwinkle species (genus Littorina) have another way to avoid males. Males usually recognize female snails by cues in their mucous trails. However, females try to mask their gender by altering these cues.Johannesson, K., Saltin, S. H., Duranovic, I., Havenhand, J. N. & Jonsson, P. R. Indiscriminate males: mating behaviour of a marine snail compromised by a sexual conflict? PLoS ONE 5, e12005 (2010). In damselflies, females also try to mask their gender by mimicking male colors, which make them less attractive to males. Protection/alliances An effective female strategy is the employment of protection and alliances. Some females, such as wild Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulate) associate themselves with protective males who come to their rescue.Darden, S. K. & Croft, D. P. Male harassment drives females to alter habitat use and leads to segregation of the sexes. Biology letters 4, 449–51 (2008). This also occurs in hamadryas, savanna, and olive baboons, where males and females form friendships where the female gets male protection. In northern elephant seals, the females give loud cries when mounted by undesirable or subordinate males, which attract dominant males to help. A similar phenomenon occurs in elephants, bighorn sheep, and fallow deer, where the females stay close to dominant males for protection. Females can also form alliances with other females for protection against aggressive males. In African vervet monkeys, related females often form groups and “gang up” on males. Females of high rank create networks of female alliances; together, they fight away persistent suitors. Resistance/fighting back Resisting males and fighting back are important tactics some species use to counter male coercion. Many females try to vigorously shake off males to dislodge them and flee; this is seen in females sepsid flies and diving beetles. Sepsids also try to bend their abdomen in such a way that males cannot copulate forcefully. Females are especially likely to fight back when they are protecting their offspring. This is seen in mountain gorillas, red howlers, and grey langur females, where males are often infanticidal. Female resistance has rarely been found to be effective. Male mammals and birds are usually larger than females, and the sheer size and strength difference makes this very difficult. However, it has been observed in some species, such as squirrel monkeys, patas monkeys, vervets, and captive chimpanzees, that females can “gang up” on males when they are being aggressive. They will even try to protect a female in distress. Females have even been observed to kill immigrant males in wild red colobus monkeys. Acceptance/submission Sometimes, females choose not to struggle and simply acquiesce to forceful matings. This can happen when they decide that the cost of resisting would be greater than the cost of mating. They use submission to avoid further harassment or aggression, which could end in death or injury. This is often seen in primate species, such as chimpanzees and hamadryas baboons. Contribution to the continuation of the species Some possible benefits of sexual coercion for the species have been hypothesized. Proximate A possible proximate benefit for females is that sometimes after a male mates with a female, he becomes her mate. Then, he would defend and protect her. This is seen in many primate species. Ultimate A possible benefit of sexual coercion that would come out in the long run is the “good genes” hypothesis. If males can overcome a female's resistance, then they must possess good genes that would increase the survival, mating success, and ultimately the fitness of the species. The hypothesis is that females can use the sexual coercion process to assess the quality of a male. Consequences Coevolutionary arms race Sexual coercion often leads to an intersexual coevolutionary arms race. This consists of females evolving adaptations to male advances and males evolving counter-adaptations as a response. Males persist in violent behavior, which favors the evolution of female resistance to defend themselves. In organisms where males have genitalia harmful to females, such as in certain insects, females tend to evolve thicker, less sensitive copulatory tracts. Also, they may evolve shield over their genital openings to prevent intromission. Females of some species of water striders have evolved protection from forceful insemination, such as abdominal spines and downward-bent abdomens to make it harder for males to mate. In response, however, males have counter evolved, also changing the shape of their abdomens to those that would facilitate forceful mating. The male waterfowl (Aves: Anatidae) evolution of a phallus to forcefully copulate with females has led to counteradaptations in females in the form of vaginal structures called dead end sacs and clockwise coils. These structures make it harder for males to achieve intromission. The clockwise coils are significant because the male phallus everts out of their body in a counter-clockwise spiral; therefore, a clockwise vaginal structure would impede forceful copulation. Studies have shown that the longer a male's phallus is, the more elaborate the vaginal structures were. Speciation Speciation has been observed to be a possible consequence of sexual coercion. In diving beetle species family Dytiscidae, an intersexual arms race occurs between males and females. Males have evolved suction cup structures on their forelegs to help grasp females; females have counter-evolved setose dorsal furrows to impede forceful copulation. This continuous evolution (in both the forward and reverse directions) has led to the recent speciation of A. japonicus and A. kishii, where females of A. kishii have lost their dorsal furrows while those of A. japonicus have not. Sexual dimorphism Sexual coercion can lead to sexual dimorphisms, in which males and females have significant morphological differences. For example, in some species, larger males are more successful in forcefully mating/insemination, leading to a higher fitness. In red-sided garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis, it has been shown that heavier- bodied males were better courters and their size gave them an advantage over smaller bodied snakes. This helps lead to an evolution of sexual dimorphism, with males larger than females. In other species, males that are smaller than females have higher fitness. Basically, many sex-specific morphological adaptations (for example, in Dytiscidae diving beetles, females have setose dorsal furrows that males do not and males have suction cups on their forelegs that females do not) are sexual dimorphisms caused by sexual coercion.

The historical origin of the devotion to our Lady of Miracles Jaffnapatão  In 1614, Friar Francisco de S. Antonio who was the Rector of Our Lady of Victory, Jaffnapatao (Nossa Senhora da Vitória, Jafanapatão) wanted a statue for the church altar. The friar asked a local sculptor named Annacutti to carve a statue from a piece of wood he had brought with him from Cochin. The statue of the Virgin Mary, holding her infant son in her arms while being carved already become a miraculous statue. People went to Annacutti's house to pray before the statue and many reported to have been cured. Even those prayed holding the wood shavings got cured through the intercession of Virgin Mary. Some who showed disrespect to the statue experienced the wrath of God. Annacutti witnessed these miracles was both amazed and frightened and dared not to proceed with the work and requested the friar to take the unfinished statue to the church. On 24 July 1614, the statue was taken in a public procession from the sculptor’s house to the Church and as the procession passed through the streets where the royal palaces were located, the King and the royal family appeared to view the procession. The statue was placed on an altar in the middle of the church. Due to numerous miracles attributed to the statue; she was called Our Lady of Miracles (புதுமை மாதா / Puthumai Matha), Jaffnapatao. People from other parts of Ceylon, as well from neighbouring regions such as Santhome, Nagapattinam went on pilgrimage to Our Lady of Miracles. Our Lady of Miracles Jaffnapatao is said to have cured the sick and the disabled, win battles and protected the people from natural disasters that struck them on land and at sea. Miracles convinced many to be baptized and Annacutti, the sculptor of the statue later wanted to be baptized and received his baptism. The first stone for the new church, Our Lady of Miracles Jaffnapatao was laid on 8 May 1614, on the feast of the Glorious Ascension of Jesus and it became the main church in Jaffna Kingdom. During the 1620 revolt led by Migapulle Arachchi with the help of Thanjavur Nayak and Badagas mercenaries to capture Jaffna, the wives of the Portuguese who heard gun shots sought shelter inside the sanctuary that had the statue of Our Lady of Miracles and prayed for her help. There was an intense brightness and they couldn’t bear to see and bowed their heads down. The statue that is imperfect and unpainted was seen by all as if the face and hands were coloured with vermillion. It remained in that status for two weeks during which period the Portuguese defeated their enemy. Victory was gained on 1 February 1621, and on the following day a Solemn High Mass was sung. Chief Captain Filipe de Oliveira who never went to battle without first dipping the flag to her, ordered the flag should always be placed in her chapel. A fortress named Our Lady of Miracles was built and Jaffna was established the capital of the new kingdom . Our Lady of Miracles Jaffna was solemnly proclaimed the Protectress of the kingdom. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OUR_LADY_OF_MIRACLES_JAFFNA_Portugese_Ceylon.jpg On 20 February 1627, the Saturday before the first Sunday in Lent, a great natural disaster struck Jaffna. Rain and wind continued through Sunday and Monday and people took refugee inside the church of Our Lady of Miracles to protect them. The sea had raised very high and waves battered against the walls and a ten-foot storm surge penetrated interior rushing with great noise tearing down houses of the town. When the wave reached the church it divided in two and church remained surrounded by high walls of water rushing with great fury. The tiles of the church were scattered like dried leaves and the building itself received severe shaking three times. As the water level rose and reached the front of the church it caused great panic. The friars began to recite the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary and one friar and few devotees supposed to have noticed Our Lady place her hand under the feet of infant Jesus she carried in her arms, as if she was about to embrace him. From that moment the waters ceased to advance and wind began to lose its strength. The wind and raising waters swept vessels inland and many houses, building as well all the churches were destroyed in Jaffna except the church of Our Lady of Miracles. For the next ten days the soldiers and the Religious went about burying the dead, helping the homeless, the sick and the dying. On 22 March, de Oliveria died and was buried in the Main Chapel of the church of Our Lady of Miracles.  The moon adored the King and Queen of the Universe in Jaffna patão  Early Easter morning in 1622, the Procession set out with the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar, and before it the feretory of Our Lady of Miracles and another of St Anthony, with all possible pomp. When the Canopy of the Most Holy Sacrament began to move out of the church, the moon which was full, left her customary course in the lunar orbit and came down in the sight of all and, in the same proportion, at a proportionate altitude marched about six paces in front of the Most Holy Sacrament, turning into all the streets in Jaffna to accompany the King and Queen of Heaven. At the end of the Procession, when the Lord God in the Eucharist returned to the Church, the moon also returned to its place in the universe. The moon, on seeing God on earth, in order to adore its Creator in the sight of non- Christians and to confirm the Faith of the Neophytes, it came down miraculously to reverence the Risen Christ. The moon participated in the procession without changing her face in her movements in the streets of Jaffnapatao. When the procession returned to the church, she stopped like the Star of the Magi above the church in the house of his Virgin Mother, and God was not in the manger but in the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar. On that Easter morning, by the glorious intercession of the Mother of our Creator, Jafanapatão saw the Majesty of Christ glory. ( Fernão de Queiroz, Manuscript, Book 4, Chapter 10, Page 558 )  Documented reports of miracles  Friar Antonio learned Tamil and was fluent in the Tamil language. Friar Antonio sent a petition to the Captain and Judge of Jaffnapatao Amator Trauasos de Zouza in which he asked for a judicial inquiry into the credibility of the reported miracles. The Captain documented testimonies related to these miracles and was preserved in the Archives. Friar Paulo da Trindade obtained a copy of the testimonies of the witnesses. Friar Paulo da Trinidade, O.F.M. was Commissary General over Franciscans in India and Deputy of the Holy Office of Goa. Friar Trinidade’s chronicle \\"Conquista Espiritual do Oriente\\" describes in detail the work of Franciscans in India and in the neighbouring regions. A copy of the manuscript \\"Conquista Espiritual do Oriente\\" is preserved in the Vatican Library and bears the number: Cod. Lat. No. 7746. The Chapters 46, 52, 53 and 54 of Volume III of Conquista Espiritual do Oriente provide detail information on this famous statue of Our Lady of Miracles Jaffnapatao. Similar to Mahavamsa, the chronicles of Sri Lanka history maintained by the Buddhist monks, the Portuguese missionaries also maintained chronicles of Ceylon history. Jesuit priest Fernão de Queiroz, provided detail records of Ceylon history. In his book Vol II, Book 4, he wrote three full chapters (chapters 8, 9 and 10) about Our Lady of Miracles, Jaffnapatão.  Persecution of Catholics and obstacles for missionary apostolate, 1500–1800 AD  The history of Our Lady of Miracles Jafanapato reflect on life of Catholics in Ceylon during the above period. The remarkable resemblance between the Anuradhapura Cross and the Bleeding Cross of St. Thomas in Chennai and the baptismal pond near Vavuniya prove the presence of Roman Catholicism in Sri Lanka in the 5th century. Kings of Anuradhapura Kingdom granted edict of tolerance and allowed Christians to organize and worship freely. It was an era towards a Dharmista Society. Unfortunately later when Portuguese established trading links and Catholic missionaries began evangelizing people, it resulted in persecution of Catholics and obstacles for evangelization until Portuguese established their rule in Ceylon. When Portuguese began losing territories in Ceylon to Dutch, Dutch began to persecute Catholics and tried to eliminate Catholicism in Ceylon. In 1658, Portuguese lost their last stronghold in Ceylon, Fort of Our Lady of Miracles (Fortaleza de Nossa Senhora dos Milagres de Jafanapatão) to the Dutch East India Company. With the fall of Jaffna Fort, the Dutch took Portuguese as prisoners of war. Dutch rulers expelled all Portuguese from Ceylon which other rulers previously attempted but failed. The Portuguese prisoners of Jaffna were subjected to many ill –treatment, hardship and scrutiny by the Dutch and many prisoners died on their voyage when they were shipped to Batavia and Malacca. Despite keen scrutiny to which the Dutch subjected the Portuguese prisoners, they managed to smuggled with them the statue of Our Lady of Miracles to Batavia. Even after reaching Batavia and Malacca, prisoners continued to be subjected to ill treatment that violated the contemporary norms such as jailing Portuguese together with the native Javanese, chaining and forcing them to perform heavy labor, forbidding Catholic icons, forcing orphans and widows to attend Dutch churches and by not providing adequate food, clothes, shelter and medical care. In 1661, the statue of Our Lady of Miracles Jaffnapatao was brought to Goa, India and was carried in a public procession to the Convent & Church of St Francis of Assisi and was kept in one of its chapels. The statue is now preserved in the church of Sao Pedro situated along the Mandovi river in Bainguinim, Goa, India. The Dutch ruled Ceylon for 140 years, but only extended some tolerance towards Catholics at the end of their rule. During the Dutch period in Ceylon Catholic faith was proscribed, church properties confiscated and priests were banished. Dutch issued a proclamation punishable with death any person harbouring or giving protection to a Roman Catholic priest. Schools and Catholic churches were converted to Dutch Reformed Church. The confiscated bells of Our Lady of Miracles Jaffnapatao (N. S. Dos Milagres De Jaffnapatao 1648, and the Nossa Senhor Dos Milagres) became part of Dutch church (Kruys Kerk) inside the fort. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ChurchBell.jpg#filelinks Catholicism seemed to have disappeared visibly with the Portuguese. During the Dutch oppression of Catholics in Ceylon, Catholics strengthened their faith despite been subject to oppression, humiliation and impoverishment. Many Catholic families migrated from Jaffna and from other Dutch governed areas. Catholics from Manthai fled into Wanni wilderness with the statue of Our Lady of Good Health, Manthai. A daughter of a Portuguese Captain named Helena built a small church to house the statue of Our Lady of Manthai, and the place was called Silena Maruntha Madhu which then evolved to be the Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu. Some Catholics in the south, fled with the statue which is now in the Shrine of Our Lady of Matara. The statue of Our Lady of Matara came over the waves inside a wooden crate, untouched by sea waters to care for the people of Ruhunu Rata. Yet Catholicism considered dead for a long time experienced remarkable revival. The underground missionaries from Goa like Saint Joseph Vaz worked in Jaffna, Kandy, St. Anne Talawila- Puttalam and laid the foundation towards a national Catholic church in Ceylon. Saint Joseph Vaz was imprisoned by false accusation of Huguenots (Calvinist) of being a Portuguese spy and he used that time in prison to learn Sinhala language. In 1693, Saint Joseph Vaz as a prisoner in Kandy performed a miracle of rain during a severe drought and the King of Kandy in exchange released him and offered him protection and the freedom to preach the Gospel in the Kingdom of Kandy. In a similar incident, fishermen protecting and refusing to hand over Fr. Antonio to Dutch pursuers were expecting Fr. Antonio to prevent sea erosion. Fr Antonio planted a cross at the location most threatened by sea waves and on the third day waves receded and protective sand bank surfaced. The Dutch witnessing the miracle, allowed Fr Antonia to live there and built a church that is now St Anthony’s Shrine, Kochchikade. In 1544, Saint Francis Xavier baptized over 10,000 people in 13 villages along the Travancore coast and gave each a Portuguese name written in Tamil. He learned to teach prayers like Nicene Creed, Lord’s Prayer, Hail Mary, Hail Holy Queen (Salve Regina) in Tamil. In the same year when St. Francis Xavier was in Punnaikayal, south India a deputation from villages like Careapatao in Patim, Mannar came to express their interest to become Catholics and invite him to Mannar. The saint couldn’t go and he send a cleric whose name was also Francis Xavier who with great zeal preached the faith and successfully baptized the people in the villages of Patim. Island of Mannar was under Jaffna and the king’s brother, the rightful heir to the Jaffna kingdom lived in exile fearing his brother’s cruelty. He and his leading men wished to become Christians and wanted Portuguese help to regain his throne. The adversaries of the new faith fear mongered and warned King of Jaffna, Cankili I (Sekarasasekaran/Sankili I) unless he takes prompt action against these converts in Mannar, he will soon lose his kingdom to Portuguese. Losing Manna’s strategic location create economic and security risk for Jaffna. Sangili I swore not to leave any Catholic converts alive and recruited about 5000 men and personally lead a military contingent to Mannar. Sangili issued an edict ‘renounce Christianity or die’ and the order of horrible slaughter was executed with much cruelty without distinction of age, gender or status. Children cried out when their mothers tried to hide them from seeing their companions beheaded. There was no resistance and the new converts inspired by the power of faith offered their throat to the executors to be beheaded. Cleric Francis Xavier, IIam Singha (Uracinga) a sort of Governor/ tributary prince of Mannar and those serving Jaffna King in Mannar bravely confessed their catholic faith and were put to the sword. Between 600 to 700 were martyred and the Massacre of the Manarese seemed to have happened between October and December 1544. In 1548, St Francis Xavier landed in Mannar and kissed the ground where Catholics were martyred. He then went to Jaffna and asked king Sankili I to stop harming and harassing Catholics. St. Francis Xavier couldn't trust Sankili I and as he was leaving Jaffna on his way to Galle, he said \\" Unhappy island how many dead bodies will cover your shores and with how much blood will you be inundated\\". Those who fled in 1544 to the mainland began returning to Patim in 1561 and the Catholic community flourished until Dutch began persecuting them. Dutch conquered Mannar Fort in 1658 and the missionaries and Catholic families then fled as refugees to Jaffna. Historical documents mention Patim (Patti/Paddi) as the place of martyrdom. Henrique Henriques(Anrique Anriquez) missionary who arranged Printing in Tamil language Christian doctrine was parish priest Mannar (1561–1564). Writing from Mannar in 1561, he mentioned Patim village was half a league from Mannar Fort. In July 1945, Rev. Dr. P.A.J.B. Antoninus and his team used ancient maps for excavation and succeeded in locating Patim site. It is known to local residents as Paddi Taravai, located at the second mile post, half mile west of Fort – Talaimannar road. On further excavation Fr. Antoninus’s team found the church altar and several skeletons, including those of children, lying in all direction. Others heads got separated. Part of the bones on the edges showed reddish colour. Earlier in 1924, Frs. Delandes and Stanislaus excavation at Thoddaverly led to believe Thoddaverly as the burial place of Catholic martyrs and build a church in honour of Queen of Martyrs, Mannar. In 1543–1544 when Governor Martim Afonso de Sousa was near the island with a powerful fleet, Sankili I agreed to Portuguese conditions for peace, yet he indirectly continued to harm Catholics and Portuguese interest. In the south, Veediya Bandara (Weedeya Raja), the son–in-law of King Bhuvanekabahu VII tortured and executed Catholics and missionaries, burned their houses and churches. Missionaries had to hide in the jungles for protection. He then fled north and joined King Sankili I to get rid of Catholicism and Portuguese from the island. Friar Belchoir de Lisboa and four of his companions were the first friars to preach the faith in Jaffnapatao and were martyred. While the friar was being tortured, the king asked why he wept, and the friar replied considering the misery who being a king choose to remain a slave to the devil. The 1560 expedition by Viceroy Dom Constantino de Braganza to subdue Sankili I failed, yet, fearing a more powerful expedition, he agreed to all the Portuguese conditions. One of the articles of the treaty stated that no impediment should be placed on those who wish to embrace Christianity. St. Francis Xavier met King of Kotte Bhuvanekabahu VII of Sri Lanka in Kotte and in Kandy met King Jayaweera, King of Kandy asking them to allow missionary work. Kings were more interested in getting a Portuguese garrison to protect themselves than spreading the Gospel or protecting Catholics. There were Catholic communities in the west coast from Jaffna to Welligama and on the east coast in places like Trincomalee. King Bhuvanekabahu VII told St Francis Xavier if he get baptized people will rebel against him and for the same reason he can’t allow much freedom to the Franciscans to preach the gospel to his subjects. Yet he told the saint he would cease obstacles to Franciscans if Viceroy protect his kingdom and him. The Moors, whose support Mayadunne depended on, were interested in taking over the whole island while Portuguese were only interested in trade and breaking up Moors trade monopoly. King Bhuvanekabahu's strategy was to use Portuguese against Mayadunne of Sitawaka and his Moorish allies for his own protection and not let neither take control of his kingdom. Once a sorcerer advised King Bhuvanekabahu to get rid of all the Franciscans. Fr John de Villa Conde who was residing in the palace and teaching king’s grandson told the king he would show the truth of Catholic faith and asked a large pile of wood to be set on fire in the courtyard of the palace. He then walked into the pyre and standing midst of the flame he asked the sorcerer to follow him. The sorcerer hesitated but the king had him seized and thrown into the fire from which he emerged burnt while flame did not even touch the friar’s cloth. Though the king venerated the friar he still refused Franciscans a greater freedom in exercising their apostleship. King Bhuvanekabahu's grandson King Dharmapala of Kotte had the courage to be baptized and rule as a Catholic King. History of Sri Lanka cover over two thousand years of monarchy rule. During the Portuguese Ceylon, some members of the Royal family of Kandy, Kotte and Jaffna kingdoms baptized and embraced the new faith. Some of those baptized escaped to avoid persecution and some were martyred. Prince Jugo, the eldest son of King Bhuvanekabahu VII was killed by the king because the prince wanted to become a Christian. People saw a \\" cross of fire \\" in the sky and in the place where he was killed the earth opened in the form of a cross. These signs moved many people to the new faith. King Cankili II (Sankili Kumaran/ Sankili II) tried to get the help of Dutch, Moors and Thanjavur to defeat the Portuguese but failed. In 1619, after being defeated, Sankili II was captured and taken to Goa for trial. While in prison Sankili II sent for the Superior of the Franciscan Fathers. Sankili told the priest he learned Christian faith and had great veneration for Fr. Peter of Betancourt but didn't want to be baptized because of his ambition to rule and was afraid of the people. King Sankili II told the priest, he will lose his life but want to save his soul and that it is better to be a Catholic coolie than a pagan king. He was baptized as Don Philip. He passed his last days in sincere repentance for his atrocities he had committed and his eyes fixed on the Crucifix. His wife, like King Sankili Sekarasasekaran’s brother and sister devoted their life to the work of charity in Goa. The last prince to the Jaffna throne was young Dom Constantino and Portuguese had the intention to restore him the throne when he attained the age of majority. But prince Don Constantine choose a monastic life as a Franciscan friar, Constantine of Christ.  400-year devotion to Our Lady of Miracles Jaffnapatao  Once during the feast of Our Lady, the Capitan Major Phillippe de Oliveira suggested the statue of Our Lady of Miracles be carried in procession. A priest respecting his wishes and by prostrating before Our Lady said in a loud voice \\" My Lady, punish not my boldness but cast thy eyes on the devotion with which thy devout Captain and these people wish to put thee in possession of this kingdom of which thou art the Patroness and Refuge\\". He then kissed the feet of the statue and when he placed his hand on the statue and took it away from the niche, he felt no weight of the statue. The priest in much astonishment turned to people who were on their knees and said \\" Praise God, Gentleman, in the most scared Virgin, for she carries herself\\" and he placed the statue on the feretory. This priest later affirmed to all that he felt no weight and that he felt like carrying a feather in his hand. This miracle was confirmed again for all to see at the time of restoring the statue to its niche. The priest in the presence of the people said\\" Let us go, my Queen and my Lady, to thy niche place.\\" and as he was going to place his hand on the statue to raise it from the stand on which it stood, Our Lady rose by herself and placed herself in his hands and all were amazed to witness this miracle. People thanked and praised God and Our Lady of Miracles because so much of joy was observed in her face at the time of the procession. That way she showed her acceptance as Patroness of Jaffna Kingdom. From 1614 to 1658 when the statue was in Jaffna, the devotees daily praised Our Lady of Miracles, singing the hymns with versicle and oration the \\"O Gloriosa Domina\\" in the morning, \\"Ave Maris Stella\\" in the afternoon and at night chanting Litanies beginning with the verse \\"Tota Pulchra es Maria\\". One Christmas night when they were singing the hymn Te Deum, and when they were singing the verse \\"Tu ad liberandum suscepturus hominem, non horruisti Virginis uterum\\", all those present supposed to have seen the statue of Our Lady of Miracles Jaffnapatao beautiful and resplendent, and her whole face lit up with joy. Every year on her feast day, the statue adorned with precious jewels was taken in a procession through the streets of the town. Devotion to Our Lady of Miracles Jaffnapatao resumed in 1661 at St. Francis of Assisi Church in Goa, and now annually at the chapel of Nossa Senhora de Piedade in Goa, India. By the Rivers of Mandovi, devotees continue to pray to Our Lady of Jaffnapatao that the words of their mouth and the meditation of their heart be pleasing to Prince of Peace Some scholars based on written records and authentic traditions believe the devotional relationship between the people of Indo- Ceylon and Virgin Mary – Apostles began with the rising of the Star of Bethlehem. Historian Joao de Barros had mentioned that a king of the island of Ceilam was one of the three kings, the Biblical Magi who went to Bethlehem to worship the King of the Jews and that he came back with a portrait of Virgin Mary ( de Barros. Decade III, Book VII Chapter XI). Nestorian Cross discovered in Anuradhapura in 1912 prove the presence of Nestorian Christians in Sri Lanka from early times coupled with the traditional legend had Apostle Thomas preached from the hillock where the present St Thomas Church Gintupitiya stands. The 6th century traveller Comos Indicopleustes mentioned “ Even in Taprobane where the Indian Sea is, there is a Church of Christians with clergy and body of believers” ( Christian Topography, Book iii page 118-119).The devotees at San Thome Basilica in Chennai and the Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health in Velankanni Town both in Tamil Nadu, India were miraculously saved from the 2004 tsunami waves. According to the legend, St Thomas the Apostle planted a wood (St. Thomas Miraculous Post) at the top of the steps leading to San Thome Basilica and said sea would not pass that point. Presently, the Novena to Our Lady of Miracles Jaffnapatao begins nine days before her feast. The statue is moved daily from São Pedro Church to the chapel of Nossa Senhora de Piedade (Our Lady of Pity) for the Novena. The feast of Our Lady of Miracles Jaffnapatao is celebrated on the first Sunday of May.  References   Other references  * Trinidade, Paulo da, chapters 1 to 56 of vol.

First published by Food and Chemical Toxicology in September 2012, the article presented a two- year feeding study in rats, and reported an increase in tumors among rats fed genetically modified corn and the herbicide RoundUp. Scientists and regulatory agencies subsequently concluded that the study's design was flawed and its findings unsubstantiated. A chief criticism was that each part of the study had too few rats to obtain statistically useful data, particularly because the strain of rat used, Sprague Dawley, develops tumors at a high rate over its lifetime. The publicity surrounding publication of the article also attracted criticism, with science writer Declan Butler calling it \\"a tightly orchestrated media offensive\\". As part of a news embargo, Séralini required journalists to sign an unusual confidentiality agreement in exchange for advance access to the article, prohibiting them from conferring with other scientists before the press conference announcing publication. At the press conference, Séralini emphasized the study's potential cancer implications, and photographs from the article of treated rats with large tumors were widely circulated by the media. The French Society of Toxicologic Pathology pointed out that, because such tumors are commonly found in older rats, the inclusion in the article of those images from treated rats, without also showing control rats, was misleading. Séralini also released a book and documentary film about the study in conjunction with the press conference. Following widespread criticism by scientists, Food and Chemical Toxicology retracted the paper in November 2013 after the authors refused to withdraw it. The editor-in-chief said that the article was retracted because its data were inconclusive and its conclusions unreliable. In June 2014 an amended version of the article was republished in Environmental Sciences Europe, and the raw data were made public. According to writer Nathanael Johnson, not all of the raw data were, in fact, released. The journal did not conduct any further peer review; reviewers checked only that the scientific content of the paper had not changed. Background Séralini, a professor of molecular biology at the University of Caen, is president of the scientific advisory board of the Committee of Research and Independent Information on Genetic Engineering (CRIIGEN), which opposes genetically modified food (GM food). Séralini co- founded CRIIGEN in 1999 because he judged that studies on GM food safety were inadequate.\\"Gilles Eric Séralini\\" and \\"Committee for Independent Research and Information on Genetic Engineering\\", CRIIGEN. Before 2012 Séralini had published other peer-reviewed papers that concluded there were health risks to GM foods. In 2007 he and two others published a Greenpeace-funded study (Séralini 2007). It concluded that MON 863, a corn rootworm-resistant Bt corn developed by Monsanto, caused health problems in rats, including weight changes, triglyceride level increases in females, changes in urine composition in males, and reduced function or organ damage in the liver, kidney, adrenal glands, heart and haematopoietic system. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that all blood chemistry and organ weight values fell within the normal range for control animals, and that the paper had used incorrect statistical methods.\\"Statement of the Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms on the analysis of data from a 90-day rat feeding study with MON 863 maize\\", EFSA, adopted 25 June 2007.Les experts européens innocentent un OGM, Le Figaro, 13 July 2007. The French Commission du Génie Biomoléculaire (AFBV) also criticized the study's conclusions., report prepared for the French Prime Minister by the Centre d'Analyse Strategique, 20 July 2007. Retrieved 31 May 2013 In 2009 the Séralini lab published another study (Séralini 2009), which re-analyzed toxicity data for NK 603 (glyphosate resistant), MON 810 and MON 863 strains. The data included three rat-feeding studies published by Monsanto scientists on MON 810. This study concluded that the three crops caused liver, kidney and heart damage in the rats. The EFSA concluded that the authors' claims were not supported by their data, that many of the statistical criticisms of Séralini 2007 applied to Séralini 2009, and that the study included no new information that would change the EFSA's conclusions. The French Haut Conseil des biotechnologies (High Council of Biotechnologies Scientific Committee or HCB) reviewed Séralini 2009 and concluded that it \\"presents no admissible scientific element likely to ascribe any haematological, hepatic or renal toxicity to the three re-analysed GMOs.\\" The HCB questioned the authors' independence, noting that, in 2010, the \\"body to which the authors belong\\" displayed material from a 2008 Austrian anti-GM study, the results of which had been acknowledged as mistaken by the study's authors. Food Standards Australia New Zealand concluded that the results of Séralini 2009 were due to chance alone. In 2010 Séralini sued Marc Fellous, president of the French Association of Plant Biotechnology, for libel, after Fellous criticized Séralini's research, in part because it was funded by Greenpeace. The judge ruled that the charge about the funding was defamatory. Fellous was fined €1000; Séralini was awarded a symbolic €1 in damages.Olivier, Vincent. \\"OGM: deux chercheurs au tribunal\\" (\\"GM: two researchers in court\\"), L'Express, 19 January 2011 (English translation). A 2011 article by the Séralini lab that reviewed 19 published animal-feeding studies, as well as data from animal-feeding studies submitted for regulatory approval, concluded that GM food had liver and kidney effects that were sex and dose dependent, and advocated for longer and more elaborate toxicology tests for regulatory approval.  2012 study   Study background  On 19 September 2012, the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology published a peer- reviewed paper entitled \\"Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize.\\" The two-year toxicity study, which cost €3.2 million, was conducted at the University of Caen by Séralini and seven colleagues. It had been funded by and run with the collaboration of CRIIGEN. The study used 100 male and 100 female Sprague Dawley rats, divided into twenty groups with 10 rats each. Ten diets were tested separately on the males and females. The diets comprised 11 percent, 22 percent and 33 percent genetically modified corn (NK603) and the rest standard laboratory rat food; NK603 corn that had been treated with Roundup, also at 11, 22 and 33 percent; and corn that had not been genetically modified, accompanied by differing concentrations of Roundup in the water. A control group was fed 33 percent non-GMO corn; the rest of their diet was standard laboratory rat food.\\"A scientific analysis of the rat study conducted by Gilles Eric Séralini et al.\\", Vlaams Interuniversitair Instituut voor Biotechnologie, 19 January 2013. The paper's abstract stated: \\"In females, all treated groups died 2–3 times more than controls, and more rapidly. This difference was visible in 3 male groups fed GMOs. All results were hormone and sex dependent, and the pathological profiles were comparable.\\"  Publication strategy  Séralini held a press conference on the day the study was released in which he \\"promoted the cancer results as the study’s major finding.\\" At the press conference he also announced the release of a book and film about the study. Selected journalists were given early access to the paper on condition they sign a confidentiality agreement, which meant they were unable to confer with other scientists before the embargo expired. In contrast, embargo guidelines by journals such as Nature allow reporters to check their stories with independent experts. Seralini's approach was widely criticized. A Nature editorial called it \\"a public-relations offensive.\\" The result of the confidentiality agreement, the journal said, was that critical commentary was absent from the first round of stories, the ones most likely to be remembered. The press conference and publication occurred weeks before the vote on California Proposition 37, which called for labeling genetically modified food. The study was cited by supporters of the proposition. The ethics committee of the French National Centre for Scientific Research wrote that Seralini's public-relations approach was \\"inappropriate for a high-quality and objective scientific debate.\\" Science journalist Carl Zimmer criticized the science journalists who participated.On the Media Radio Show, 2012 Sep 28 Manipulating Science Reporting Cosmos Magazine's Elizabeth Finkel said that the confidentiality clause had allowed Seralini's story to \\"prance unfettered\\" before second opinions arrived.GM Corn and Cancer: the Seralini Affair  Reception   Scientific evaluation  The study was criticized by various regulatory authorities and scientists. With few exceptions, the scientific community dismissed the study and called for a more rigorous peer-review system in scientific journals. Many said that Séralini's conclusions were impossible to justify given the statistical power of the study. Sprague-Dawley rats have a lifespan of about two years and have a high risk of cancer over their lifespan (one study concluded that over eighty percent of males and over seventy percent of females developed cancer under normal conditions). The Séralini experiment covered the normal lifespan of these rats. The longer an experiment continues, the more rats get cancer naturally, that makes it harder to separate statistical \\"noise\\" from the hypothetical signal. For the study to achieve such separation (statistical power), each control and test group would have to include sufficiently many subjects. Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) guidelines recommend 20 rats for chemical- toxicity studies, and 50 rats for carcinogenicity studies. In addition, if the survival of the rats is less than 50% at 104 weeks (which is likely for Sprague-Dawley rats) the recommended number of rats is 65. The Séralini study had only ten per group. Tom Sanders from King's College London noted a lack of data on amount of food given, and on growth rates. Further noting that rats are susceptible to mammary tumors when food intake is not restricted. Sanders said, \\"The statistical methods are unconventional ... and it would appear the authors have gone on a statistical fishing trip.\\"Ben Hirschler and Kate Kelland. Reuters. 20 September 2012 Study on Monsanto GM corn concerns draws skepticism The Washington Post quoted Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard professor in the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health at New York University and food safety advocate: \\"'[I] can’t figure it out yet....It’s weirdly complicated and unclear on key issues: what the controls were fed, relative rates of tumors, why no dose relationship, what the mechanism might be. I can’t think of a biological reason why GMO corn should do this.....So even though I strongly support labeling, I’m skeptical of this study.'\\" Likewise, Dan Charles, writing for NPR, noted that in the study, rats that ate 33% GM food developed fewer tumors than did those who ate 11% GM food, suggesting the absence of a dose response. University of Calgary Professor Maurice Moloney publicly wondered why the paper contained so many pictures of treated rats with horrific tumors, but no pictures of control group rats. Many national food safety and regulatory agencies condemned the paper. The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment VP Reiner Wittkowski said in a statement, \\"The study shows both shortcomings in study design and in the presentation of the collected data. This means that the conclusions drawn by the authors are not supported by the available data.\\"Staff (1 October 2012) A study of the University of Caen neither constitutes a reason for a re- evaluation of genetically modified NK603 maize nor does it affect the renewal of the glyphosate approval German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR).

The European Federation of Biotechnology industry association, which counts Monsanto and other biotech firms among its members,EFB (2013) Members called for the paper to be retracted, calling its publication a \\"dangerous failure of the peer-review system.\\" Six French national academies (of Agriculture, Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, Technology and Veterinarians) issued a joint statement – \\"an extremely rare event in French science\\"\\"Six French academies dismiss study linking GM corn to cancer (Update 2)\\", Agence France-Presse, 19 October 2012. – condemning the study and the journal that published it.Avis des Académies nationales d’Agriculture, de Médecine, de Pharmacie, des Sciences, des Technologies, et Vétérinaire sur la publication récente de G.E. Séralini et al. sur la toxicité d’un OGM Communiqué de presse 19 octobre 2012 The joint statement dismissed the study as 'a scientific non-event'. FCT, an Elsevier imprint, has a peer review process, and at least three scientists reviewed the paper prior to publication. The journal published a statement in their November 2012 issue, that \\"the Editors have encouraged those people with concerns to write formally to the Editor-in-Chief, so that their views can be publicly aired.\\" In March 2013 FCT published a letter from Erio Barale- Thomas,Erio Barale-Thomas linked in page Principal Scientist of Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development and the President of the Conseil d’Administration of The Société Française de Pathologie Toxicologique (SFPT, French Society of Toxicologic Pathologywebpage of the Société Française de Pathologie Toxicologique). SFPT is \\"a non governmental/non profit organization formed by veterinarians, physicians, pharmacists and biologists specialized in veterinary and toxicologic pathology. Its aim is to promote knowledge in pathology, toxicology and laboratory animal sciences for safety studies of drugs, chemicals and food products, and the role of the pathologist in the study design and data interpretation.\\" The letter criticized the Seralini study on several fronts, and concluded: \\"However, given this study presents serious deficiencies in the protocol, the procedures and the interpretation of the results, the SFPT cannot support any of the scientific claims drawn by the authors, and any relevance for human risk assessment. This letter presents the consensus scientific opinion of the Conseil d’Administration of the SFPT.\\" The Belgian Federal Minister of Public Health asked the Belgian Biosafety Advisory Council (BBAC) to evaluate the paper. The BBAC was asked to \\"inform the Minister whether this paper (i) contains new scientific information with regard to risks for human health of GM maize NK603 and (ii) whether this information triggers a revision of the current authorisation for commercialisation for food and feed use of this GM maize in the European Union (EU).\\"Bioveiligheidsraad Conseil de Biosécurité (Belgian Biosafety Advisory Council) (2012). Advice of the Belgian Biosafety Advisory Council on the article by Séralini et al., 2012 on toxicity of GM maize NK603 The BBAC committee, whose members are drawn from the Belgian biotech Professoriat, pointed out that \\"the long duration of this study is a positive aspect since most of the toxicity studies on GMOs are performed on shorter periods,\\" and concluded that: > \\"Given the shortcomings identified by the experts regarding the experimental > design, the statistical analysis, the interpretation of the results, the > redaction of the article and the presentation of the results, the Biosafety > Advisory Council concludes that this study does not contain new > scientifically relevant elements that may lead to reconsider immediately the > current authorisation for food and feed use of GM maize NK603.

A 2015 reanalysis of multiple animal studies found that Seralini chose to forgo statistical tests in the main conclusions of the study. Using Seralini's published numerical data, the review found no significant effects on animal health after analysis with statistical tests. The finding that \\"in females, all the treated groups died 2–3 times more than controls\\" was not statistically significant. The highest mortality was observed for the group of female rats fed 22% genetically modified maize. This difference was not statistically significant. Seralini also originally claimed males in groups fed 22% and 33% genetically modified maize had three times lower mortality than controls, but this was also not statistically significant. The findings of liver necrosis and mammary tumors were also not significant. A 2017 study found that since it was retracted, Seralini et al. (2012) had been cited 60 times after it was retracted, and that more of these citations were negative (39%) than were positive (26%). Responses to criticism Séralini and supporters defended the study design, the interpretation of the results, and manner and content of the publication. Support for the study came from the European Network of Scientists for Social and Environmental Responsibility (ENSSER), of which CRIIGEN is a member.Staff, ENSSER. Page last modified: 10-18-2012.

Questionable biosafety of GMOs, double standards and, once again, a \\"shooting- the-messenger\\" style debate A subsequent study published in 2013 by ENSSER concluded that EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) applied double standards in evaluation of feeding studies, criticized EFSA's applied criteria. An open letter in support of Seralini's article, signed by about 130 scientists, scholars, and activists, was published in Independent Science News, a project of the Bioscience Resource Project.Independent Science News (2012) Seralini and Science: an Open Letter, 2 October 2012 Séralini responded to criticisms of his methodology (and specifically a lack of difference between rodent groups at higher doses) with a July 2015 paper in PLOS ONE claiming that all laboratory rodent diets are contaminated with \\"dangerous\\" levels of GMOs. This has been strongly criticised by numerous experts, for example, Tamara Galloway said that the study \\"speculates beyond the evidence presented in this paper\\". Other Séralini supporters criticized the retraction of the study, concluding the response was a product of industry-driven campaign and regard this as a concerning example of industry interference in the scientific process.  Officials  At the time of the initial release, French Prime Minister Jean- Marc Ayrault said that, if the results are confirmed, the government would press for a Europe-wide ban on the maize and The European Commission instructed the EFSA in Parma, Italy, to assess the study. In late September 2012, Russia temporarily suspended importing GM corn as a result of the studyStaff, Phys.org. 26 September 2012 Russia suspends Monsanto corn imports and in November 2012, Kenya banned all GM crops.Emily Willingham for Forbes. 9 December 2012. Seralini Paper Influences Kenya Ban of GMO Imports  Media  The press conference led to widespread negative media coverage for GM food, especially in Europe. Le Nouvel Observateur covered the press conference in a story called, \\"Yes, GMOs are poisons!\\". Jon Entine in Forbes stated, \\"Seralini's research is anomalous. Previous peer-reviewed rat feeding studies using the same products (NK603 and Roundup) have not found any negative food safety impacts. The Japanese Department of Environmental Health and Toxicology released a 52-week feeding study of GM soybeans in 2007, finding \\"no apparent adverse effect in rats.\\" In 2012, a team of scientists at the University of Nottingham School of Biosciences released a review of 12 long-term studies (up to two years) and 12 multi-generational studies (up to 5 generations) of GM foods, concluding there is no evidence of health hazards.\\" Andrew Revkin wrote in a blog the study was another instance of \\"single-study syndrome\\", and that the study was in support of an \\"agenda\\".Andrew C. Revkin Single-Study Syndrome and the G.M.O. Food Fight 20 September 2012, dotearth.blogs.nytimes Henry I. Miller, in an opinion piece for Forbes, said \\"[Seralini] has crossed the line from merely performing and reporting flawed experiments to committing gross scientific misconduct and attempting fraud.\\" Séralini responded by saying, \\"...that he won't make any data available to the EFSA and the BfR until the EFSA makes public all the data under-pinning its 2003 approval of NK603 maize for human consumption and animal feed.\\" The Guardian's Environmental Blog stated that the study linking GM maize to cancer \\"must be taken seriously by regulators\\" and that although it \\"attracted a torrent of abuse\\", \\"it cannot be swept under the carpet\\". They also noted CRIIGEN's funding of the research and reported Séralini's response: namely, that studies in support of GM food are usually funded by \\"corporates or by pro-biotech institutions\\". Proponents of California's GM labeling referendum, Proposition 37, hailed the study.Staff, Right to Know.Posts tagged Seralini A statement about the controversy, and especially the attacks on Seralini, was published in Le Monde, signed by 140 French scientists; the letter said: \\"...the protocol followed in this study presents defects that are subject to debate within the scientific community.... We are deeply shocked by the image of our community that this controversy gives citizens. The risk expertise to human health or the environment is a difficult activity which is facing many uncertainties. Many of the threats to our planet have been revealed by scientists isolated and confirmed by many studies coming from the scientific community. In this case, it would be more efficient to implement research on the health and environmental risks of GMOs and pesticides, improve toxicological protocols used for placing on the market and finance a variety of researchers in this domain....\\"Andalo C, Chercheuse AHS, Atlan A, Auclair D, Austerlitz F, Barot S.

Lawsuit  In 2012 Séralini sued the editor of Marianne and journalist Jean-Claude Jaillet for defamation after they accused him of fraud. The High Court of Paris ruled in Seralini's favor in 2015. The court said that the fraud allegation had first been made by Henry I. Miller in Forbes. The journalist was fined a total of 3,500 euros, while the editor was fined twice that amount because of past convictions.infogm.org: \\"OGM - La condamnation d’un journaliste de Marianne pour diffamation confirmée en appel\\", 7 Sep 2016  Retraction  In November 2013, Elsevier announced that FCT was retracting the paper, after the authors refused to withdraw it.Barbara Casassus for Nature News. 28 November 2013 Study linking GM maize to rat tumours is retracted: Publisher withdraws paper over authors' objections, citing weak evidence The journal's editors concluded that while there was \\"no evidence of fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the data\\", the results were inconclusive and \\"[did] not reach the threshold of publication for Food and Chemical Toxicology\\". After an in-depth look at the study's raw data, no definitive conclusions could be reached regarding the role of either NK603 or glyphosate in overall mortality or tumor rates, given the high incidence of tumors in Sprague-Dawley rats and the small sample size. Normal variance could not be excluded as the cause of the results. Following many enquiries about the retraction, FCT's editor-in-chief said that: Séralini and his supporters strongly objected to the retraction,Michael Hiltzik for the Los Angeles Times. 29 November 2013 Notorious anti-GMO study is retracted – creating more controversy and Séralini himself threatened to sue FCT. A bioethicist with the NIH examined the case and wrote in the Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics that articles should not be retracted for inconclusiveness, but that retraction due to flaws in study design or due to ethical violations may be appropriate, and that republication of retracted papers should occur only after additional peer review. On 1 August 2017, as part of a lawsuit against Monsanto, documents were released showing, among other things, that the Editor-in-Chief, Wallace Hayes, had once had a contractual relationship with Monsanto. Hayes said in an interview that he did not have a contract with Monsanto when he retracted Seralini's paper, and that his decision to retract it was not influenced by Monsanto at all.  Republication  In June 2014, the original study was republished with the addition of the entire data set, in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe.

The film is based on the 1985 novel Heat by William Goldman, and is a remake of the 1986 adaptation that starred Burt Reynolds. The film was released in the United States on January 30, 2015 in a limited release and through video on demand. Wild Card received negative reviews and was a box-office bomb, making only $6.7 million worldwide against a $30 million budget. Plot Nick Wild (Jason Statham) is a recovering gambling addict who takes odd jobs in Las Vegas as a \\"chaperone\\" (his version of a bodyguard) to support his addiction. After helping a client impress a woman (Sofía Vergara), he accepts a proposition from a young man Cyrus Kinnick (Michael Angarano) to show him around Vegas and provide him with protection while he gambles. While eating at a diner, Nick's waitress friend Roxy (Anne Heche) hands him a message from a woman he knows, Holly (Dominik Garcia-Lorido), who wants him to stop by her house. Holly, a professional escort, explains she had a date the previous night at the Golden Nugget. Afterward, she was brutally raped and beaten by three unknown men in their hotel room. Holly asks Nick to find out who they are so that she can sue them. Nick discovers that the man responsible for raping Holly is Danny DeMarco (Milo Ventimiglia), a gangster. DeMarco had his two thugs dump her in a hospital car park. Nick goes to the hotel to confront DeMarco, disguised as someone sent by another criminal. A confrontation develops but Nick defends himself, overpowering DeMarco and his men, who are tied up as Nick calls Holly. In the room, Holly contemplates castrating DeMarco, who breaks down and begs her forgiveness, Holly decides to take the $50,000 from DeMarco's desk and leaves. Holly splits the money with Nick and leaves Las Vegas. Nick takes Cyrus to a casino. Playing blackjack with dealer friend Cassandra (Hope Davis), Nick then goes on a huge winning streak with the next dealer, amassing over a half a million. But when he goes to the cashier, he has a sudden anxiety attack, then decides to keep on gambling and unfortunately loses his winnings – as well as his original $25,000 – on a single blackjack bet with Cassandra. The next morning, Cyrus, revealed to be a self-made millionaire, wants Nick to mentor him on being brave, but Nick declines. At the bar, DeMarco's men arrive to deliver Nick to DeMarco, but Nick fends them off. Nick meets with Baby (Stanley Tucci), the mafia boss of Las Vegas. Baby has received a complaint from DeMarco, who claims that Nick broke into his hotel room, pistol-whipped him, and killed two of his men – all to fund his gambling addiction. Baby takes Nick to a room with DeMarco, where Nick tells his side of the story: that DeMarco killed his own men later and that DeMarco bears a cut on his penis. Baby tells DeMarco to drop his pants to prove Nick wrong, but he refuses and leaves. At the local diner, Cyrus offers Nick a check for $500,000 and a plane ticket to Corsica for what he has learned from Nick. DeMarco and his men appear in the diner. Cyrus shows his newfound manliness by singing loudly as a distraction so Nick can escape. Nick thinks about his sailboat and then kills the thugs and DeMarco with his utensils behind the diner. Afterwards, Cyrus insists Nick take the check and the ticket, and Nick accepts. Nick then drives out of Las Vegas. Cast * Jason Statham as Nick Wild * Michael Angarano as Cyrus Kinnick * Milo Ventimiglia as Danny DeMarco * Dominik Garcia-Lorido as Holly * Anne Heche as Roxy * Sofía Vergara as DD * Max Casella as Osgood * Jason Alexander as Pinky * Francois Vincentelli as Benny * Daviena McFadden as Millicent * Chris Browning as Tiel * Matthew Willig as Kinlaw * Grieice Santo as Cocktail Waitress * Hope Davis as Cassandra * Stanley Tucci as Baby Production Simon West said that Jason Statham developed the project himself \\"maybe over five years\\". At one point, Brian De Palma was slated to direct until West replaced him. West stated: West said the script filmed was the one Goldman wrote over thirty years ago. He later elaborated: > I rang him up and said, \\"I'm about to put the record straight and fix this > film for you.\\" I did ask him, what's your one piece of advice for me when > shooting this? He said, \\"Just make sure that Nick is the toughest guy you've > ever seen in your life.\\" That, I think is his approach – no matter how > complicated the character is intellectually, no matter how much dialogue > there is, or twists and turns Goldman puts in the script, at the end of the > day, he has this one thing that he has above his desk that reminds him what > the character should be. It was the same for me – once he told me that, > \\"Nick's the toughest guy in Vegas\\", every scene informs that. Even when he's > not doing anything, everybody in the room knows that, and everybody knows > his history, what he's capable of. And so he ultimately doesn't have to do > that much, because he is the toughest guy in Vegas. \\"\\"It was nice firstly to have a script that was so set, because on any big movie scripts are constantly in flux,\\" said West. \\"It also made it easy to sell to actors like Stanley Tucci and Sofia Vergara because their parts were very set out. There's nothing in the script that's really aged, there's no pyrotechnics or technology really.\\" Filming Filming began in early 2013 in New Orleans, Louisiana. The principal photography began in February 2013. Simon West said the three fights were \\"character driven\\". > each one of the action moments is character-driven, so you're right, it > builds up. So when it does explode, it's exploding for the right reason. The > first one, he's getting back into his old skills – precision fighting. The > only way he's going to get out alive is by relying on his old skills. And > he's a master of that. The second fight explodes out of anger, and it's > really anger at himself for going back to being a gambling addict. They're > character-driven fights. Whereas traditionally in action films, they're > light relief – they're almost commercial breaks in the story. These ones > come out of the situation his character's in, not just that he's in jeopardy > and has to fight his way out of it – they're emotional fights. Marketing The trailer for Wild Card debuted on December 12, 2014. West later recalled: Release Lionsgate released the film in a limited release and through on demand on January 30, 2015. Reception Box office Wild Card was a box office bomb, making only $6.7 million against a $30 million budget. Critical response Wild Card has generally received negative reviews from film critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 32% based on reviews from 56 critics, with an average rating of 4.85 out of 10. The site's consensus states: \\"Hardcore Jason Statham fans may enjoy parts of Wild Card, but all other action aficionados need not apply.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 40 out of 100 based on reviews from 19 critics. Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a negative review, calling Wild Card \\"predictable\\". She summed up her review by saying that Wild Card \\"is no royal flush, no full house, no three of a kind. A bust is I think the term I'm searching for\\".

Qualia is a philosophical term used to refer to an individual's subjective experience, that is to say, the way something feels to that individual at that particular moment. The central tenet of Functionalism is that mental states (emotions, sensations, beliefs, etc.) are only a causal relationship between physical sensations, mental states (neurological states), and behavior. For example: John touches a hot stove, feels pain, and pulls back his hand. This is an example of a Functionalist system. A functionalist would argue that attempting to insert the concept of qualia into this relationship creates an empty quality that has no actual physical relationship to anything. The \\"quale\\" in this example would be John's subjective sensation of his burned hand, how it feels to him at that moment to have a burned hand. The absent qualia hypothesis attempts to demonstrate why qualia such as this cannot exist. Michael Tye characterizes the absent qualia hypothesis as, \\"the hypothesis that it could be the case that a system that functionally duplicates the mental states of a normal human being has no phenomenal consciousness (no qualia).\\" Tye, Michael, 2006. \\"Absent Qualia and the Mind- Body Problem\\" Philosophical Review, Vol. 115, No. 2, 2006, 140 For example, if a machine were created which could exactly duplicate the above scenario, and this machine contained a computer system as complicated as John's neurological system, then it is logically possible that this system would have exactly the same reaction as John but lack consciousness, a prerequisite for subjective experience (qualia). A functionalist would argue that it must be the case that qualia would not be created in such a scenario, thus demonstrating that qualia cannot exist without conflicting with the fundamental tenets of Functionalism.

Written by guitarist Dickey Betts and Nashville songwriter Johnny Cobb, the song was a conscious effort to produce a hit single. The Allman Brothers Band had signed to Arista Records in 1980, and founder Clive Davis pushed them to modernize their sound. \\"Straight from the Heart\\" was later regarded as an \\"embarrassing\\" experiment by members of the band. Nevertheless, the song became the group's first top 40 hit since their heyday, and subsequently their last: it peaked at number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also hit number 11 on Billboard Rock Top Tracks chart. Background The Allman Brothers Band had signed to Arista Records in 1980 following the collapse of Capricorn Records the previous year. Arista founder Clive Davis pushed the band to modernize their sound, as southern rock was becoming increasingly unpopular. \\"He wanted us to be a Southern American version of Led Zeppelin and brought in outside producers and it just kept getting worse,\\" said drummer Butch Trucks. \\"Straight from the Heart\\" epitomized the single-oriented sound the band strived for while on Arista. For their second effort on Arista, Brothers of the Road (1981), the group collaborated with \\"name producer\\" John Ryan, of Styx and Doobie Brothers fame. \\"He took them even further away from their roots,\\" said Mike Lawler, a Nashville songwriter who also worked on their Arista debut. He noted that Dickey Betts co-wrote \\"Straight from the Heart\\" with fellow songwriter Johnny Cobb, and that \\"He allowed it to happen; it's not like the two of us came in and dictated to the Allman Brothers Band what they should do and how they should sound.\\" David Goldflies, bassist of the band in this incarnation, attributed the change in direction to the label, management, and the band's own desire to have another hit single. Both Gregg Allman and Trucks later regarded their two Arista albums as a \\"huge embarrassment,\\" leading to their second breakup in 1982.

Physical The physical dimension focuses on three sub-categories: healthy eating,MyPyramid exercise, and the human body (digestive system, skeletal system and circulatory systems). Intellectual For K-5 the focus can be on the brain controlling the body, all the way up to studying the parts of the brain. Students are expected to understand that different parts control different body functions. Spiritual Students learn techniques to harmonize their actions with the world around them. Emotional Students learn to identify negative and positive emotions and coping strategies. Occupational Students learn to connect the job they want with the necessary preparation.

Haavard Nord and Eirik Chambe-Eng (the original developers of Qt and the CEO and President, respectively, of Trolltech) began development of \\"Qt\\" in 1991, three years before the company was incorporated as Quasar Technologies, then changed the name to Troll Tech and then to Trolltech. Until version 1.45 the source code of Qt was released under the Qt Free Edition License. This was viewed as not compliant with the open source principle by the Open Source Initiative and the free software definition by Free Software Foundation because, while the source was available, it did not allow the redistribution of modified versions. Controversy arose around 1998 when it became clear that KDE's K Desktop Environment was going to become one of the leading desktop environments for Linux. As it was based on Qt, many people in the free software movement worried that an essential piece of one of their major operating systems would be proprietary. With the release of Qt 2.0, the license was changed to the Q Public License (QPL), a free software license but one regarded by the Free Software Foundation as incompatible with the GPL. A compromise was found between KDE and Trolltech whereby Qt would not be able to fall under a more restrictive license than the QPL, even if Trolltech was bought out or went bankrupt. This led to the creation of the KDE Free Qt Foundation which guarantees that Qt would fall under a BSD-style license should no free/open source version of Qt be released during a period of 12 months. In 2000, Qt 2.2 was released under the GPL v2, ending all controversy regarding GPL compatibility. On Nokia announced to acquire Trolltech. On Qt version 4.5 was relicensed, adding LGPL as licensing option. The Qt Project was founded on . In August 2012 Digia announced to acquire all rights to Qt and take Nokia's role within the Qt Project.  Governance  The Qt Project is not a separate legal entity or organization; Digia retains all trademarks around Qt. Qt's Open Governance is modelled after WebKit's. Decision-making takes place in a process the project describes as \\"lazy consensus\\". The project facilitates online communication among its developers and community members through public forums, mailing lists, and wiki pages.  Participating organizations  Distribution of non-Digia Qt contributors (2013, Week 18) Aside from the project leader Digia and various individuals, a number of other organizations participate in the Qt Project. Second-largest Qt contributor is KDAB, a Swedish Qt consulting company. KDAB is involved in many areas, including maintenance of several components. KDAB together with RIM/BlackBerry are maintaining the QNX and BlackBerry 10 ports of Qt. Another big participator is Intel, contributing for example Wayland support. AudioCodes maintains IBM ClearCase support in Qt Creator. Many contributions also come from the KDE community, which is oftentimes adding features from their KDE Frameworks upstream into Qt.

Goodwin's artwork is held in major collections including the Art Gallery of NSW, Sydney and regional galleries across Australia.Richard Goodwin Pty Ltd \\\\- He regularly consults on major infrastructure projects such as bridges and freeway walls. Goodwin's core agenda is creating what he calls \\"porosity\\". He argues, \\"Security seeks to close a city down. Porosity seeks to open it up. Somewhere between the two a solution must be found within our capitalist system. If we can't find the balance, they'll close the cities and cities will die\\". In practicing this agenda, he tests the functional and aesthetic boundaries of public space through both art and architecture. He has opened up new dimensions in the planning of urban spaces and the way architecture interacts with its physical and cultural context. In 1996, Goodwin established the Porosity Studio at COFA . The studio enquires into the way patterns of inhabiting and moving through the cities weaves a level of political richness into the fabric of architecture. Since 2004 the studios have been supported by a number of cooperations such as the British Council. They have been run as intensive workshops internationally in cities such as Glasgow, Cardiff, Milan, Beijing and Rotterdam. The Australian Research Council (ARC)'s prestigious Discovery Grant was awarded to Goodwin in 2002. The research project argued for 'Porosity' as a way of describing an urban experience which turns the building inside out and de-emphasises the obsession with facades. The outcome of the research opened up an entire new chapter in the way the fabric of the city is viewed by civic authorities. The ARC awarded Richard Goodwin again in 2009 with a Linkage Grant to develop the research further through sensors and gaming engine technologies in collaboration with Russell Lowe and the Emergency Information Coordination Unit (EICU) run under the NSW Department of Lands.

The goals of the operation were to restore living conditions, provide humanitarian aid, and prevent the outbreak of civil war.Lombardi, Fiona. The Swiss Air Power: Wherefrom? Whereto?. vdf Hochschulverlag AG, 2007. p117 It was the first longterm humanitarian mission for the Air Force abroad and the first use of Swiss Air Force helicopters in the edge region of a war zone. Super Puma T-315 at Kukës Context Already in 1998 the number of refugees requesting asylum in Switzerland from the area increased due to the simmering conflict in Kosovo to such an extent that the civilian response capacity in Switzerland beat against their limits. The Federal Council decided that at the end of 1998 to use the army to care for and to engage directly in the crisis area to prevent further swelling. After the outbreak of war in Kosovo in 1999, the Governments of Albania and Macedonia asked for an international humanitarian intervention after major refugee flows Kosovo Albanian civilians came to this country. The Federal Council decided on 1 April 1999, just before Easter, military assistance to support the primary helping Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit (SHA) and the UNHCR. Implementation of the operation «Swiss Camp» Super Puma and Franz Brozincevic Wetzikon Aircraft refulling Truck on Tirana Airport The operations were carried out in the framework of the Task Force of the surveillance squadron pilots (UeG) of the Air Force with three transport helicopters of the type Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma (\\"Super Puma\\", serial number T-315, T-322 and T-312). The Chief in Command was the later Swiss Air Force General Walter Knutti. First, several operational plans were drawn up on Good Friday in the helicopter base of the Swiss Air Force at the military airfield Alpnach. On Easter Sunday a recconteam first flew to Albania. On Easter Monday, the helicopters were readied and loaded with the necessary equipment. On Tuesday after Easter (April 6), the first helicopter with the routing Florence and Brindisi flew to Tirana. The next two Super Puma had to fly over southern Italy and Greece, as NATO had in the meantime established over the Adriatic a no-fly zone. The camp was built on the Rinas (Tirana) Airport, which had then taken the US Army. Additional staff of the Federal Office for the Air Force operations (BABLW) and the Fortress Guard (FWK) was flown down with the Dassault Falcon 50 and Learjet. The material arrived by truck on Friday evening in Albania. From the next day, the daily replenishment and personnel exchange of a hired transport aircraft of the Spanish Air Force was acquired (CASA/IPTN CN-235). The construction of the infrastructure of the camp met at the airport at the beginning to several problems such as swampy areas and non-existent sanitation facilities. The camp was fully operational on 9 April. Refugee Camp Kukës photographed out of a Super Puma The primary purpose of the operation was to supply the Refugee camp around the northern Albanian town of Kukës, near the border with Kosovo. The mountainous region in the northeast and Albania was deposited on the road is very difficult to achieve. About 50 volunteer army personnel were involved on site, a total of nearly 150 people. In 725 missions and nearly 800 flight hours (around 25% of the normal annual budget) were 878 tons of material (especially food) and 5,200 passengers transported and carried out 350 medical evacuations with serious injuries. At the request of the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre the Swiss government launched the mission on April 6, 1999 and it was complete on July 24, 1999.Reiter, Erich. Small states and alliances. Edited by Heinz Gärtner. Physica-Verlag, 2001. pp176–180Borchert, Heiko. The Kosovo Conflict and the Swiss Contribution. European Security 8.4 (1999): 165–190. Conclusion The Swiss Air Force had to deal with new problems during Task Force ALBA that brought new experience to the organization. The main problem arose from the use of a neutral country in the context of NATO operations as well the one-sided position of the company, risking the possibility of it being dragged-in to the conflict, as well as issues regarding interoperability. Other problem areas were legal issues (legal status, carrying of weapons), the lack of doctrine (e.g. for application, logistics, and support), insufficient transportation capacity over long distances, insufficient human resources on the part of the Air Force, domestic political resistance against the possible use by Militia personnel, and crisis management in rapidly changing conditions. The experience of the Task Force ALBA were evaluated for the following Swisscoy use within the multinational KFOR operation in Kosovo.

She is homeported at Auke Bay in Juneau, Alaska where she patrols territorial waters, including the Inside Passage. In 2016 she won the Hopley Yeaton Cutter Excellence Award for outstanding operational and humanitarian achievements. Design and characteristics USCGC Liberty mooring at Auke Bay, Alaska The Island-class patrol boats, including Liberty, were constructed in Bollinger Shipyards, Lockport, Louisiana. Their design is based on the British Vosper Thornycroft patrol boats and have similar dimensions. Liberty has an overall length of , a beam of , and a draft of at full load. The patrol boat has a displacement of 155 tons at full load and 138 tons at half load. The Coast Guard purchased 49 Island-class cutters, and over the course of their construction made several modifications. The ships are grouped into A, B, and C classes depending on their design. Liberty is a B-class ship and thus has heavier bow plating to prevent hull cracking in heavy seas, among other enhancements. Liberty is powered two Paxman Valenta 16 CM Diesel engines which drive two 5-blade propellers. She has two Caterpillar 3304T diesel generators for electrical power. Her hull is constructed from high-strength steel, and her superstructure and main deck are constructed from aluminium. Stern flaps were retrofitted to reduce hull friction and increase speed and full efficiency. Liberty has active fin stabilizers to improve her seakeeping characteristics. The Island-class patrol boats have maximum sustained speeds of . They are fitted with one 25mm machine gun and two Browning .50 Caliber Machine Gun. They are equipped with satellite navigation systems, collision avoidance systems, and surface radar. They have a range of at 8 knots, and an at-sea endurance of five days. Liberty carries one 18-foot rigid hull inflatable boat with seating for 8 crew. Liberty's complement is 2 officers and 16 enlisted crew. Liberty's namesake is Liberty Island in New York Harbor, site of the Statue of Liberty. Operational history Liberty was commissioned on December 18, 1989. She was the 34th of the Island-class cutters. Her original cost was reported as $6.5 million. After commissioning, she was assigned to Juneau, where she moored at Auke Bay. She replaced USCGC Cape Carter at this station. Her primary missions are law enforcement, fisheries management, search and rescue, and oil spill response. She is credited, along with Alaska State Troopers, with the largest hash oil seizure in Alaska history. On October 30, 2007 crew from Liberty boarded the fishing vessel 819 in the Ketchikan area. They found five half-pint jars of the drug with a street value between $40,000 and $50,000. The United States and Canada disagree on the location of the maritime border in Dixon Entrance. This led to a series of seizures of Canadian fishing boats by Liberty in the disputed waters. Diane S. was fishing 400 yards into U.S. waters when she was seized on July 20, 1991. Eliza Joye was seized on July 29, 1991.. Serene was seized 875 yards north of the border claimed by the U.S. on July 20, 1992. A 1990 agreement between the two countries reduced fishing conflicts and Liberty's seizures of Canadian boats when it became effective in 1992. While the conflict with Canada has faded, Liberty continues to board U.S.-flagged fishing boats to enforce fishing and safety regulations. In the summer of 2018, for instance, Liberty's boardings found five vessels in violation of various regulations.USCGC Liberty evacuating passengers from grounded Empress of the North, May 15, 2007Liberty has been involved in many search and rescue missions. Often they consist of assisting fishing vessels with mechanical problems. For example, in September 2001 Liberty rescued five crewmen from the fishing vessel Baranof Queen which had been disabled off Cape Spencer. In other instances, the distressed vessel was wrecked. After the salmon-fishing vessel Belle-Tech was wrecked on the Gilanta Rocks () in Dixon Entrance on July 19, 1999, Liberty rescued her crew of two, which had abandoned ship in a small boat.alaskashipwreck.com Alaska Shipwrecks (B) Liberty took eight people off the beached charter yacht Alaskan Song in 2001. Sometimes her searches were for a single person in a canoe. On a few occasions, however, Liberty was dispatched on rescue missions involving dozens or hundreds of people. At approximately 12:35 am on May 15, 2007 the sternwheel cruise ship Empress of the North went aground on Hanus Reef at the eastern entrance of Icy Strait. She had 281 passengers and crew aboard. While her outer hull was pierced by a rock, the inner hull was intact and pumps were able to keep up with the flooding. Liberty, the ferry Columbia, and a number of nearby fishing boats responded. Liberty took off about 130 passengers and transferred them to Columbia. Private vessels evacuated the remaining passengers and most were transferred to the ferry. All the passengers were off the stricken vessel by about 5:30 am. Columbia arrived in Juneau at 11 am with the passengers while Liberty remained with Empress of the North. The grounded ship was able to refloat and make its way to Auke Bay under its own power, escorted by Liberty. In July 2008 Liberty responded to another grounded cruise ship, Spirit of Glacier Bay. She ran onto a sand bar at the head of Tarr Inlet in Glacier Bay National Park. Her passengers were evacuated by park vessels before Liberty arrived. When the high tide refloated the cruise liner, Liberty escorted her to port in case further assistance was required. Liberty had assisted another disabled cruise liner, Spirit of Columbia, owned by the same company, Cruise West, as Spirit of Glacier Bay, just two months before. Liberty has been awarded the meritorious unit commendation.  Replacement plans  As early as the mid-2000s the mechanical reliability of the aging Island-class ships became an issue. The Coast Guard began retiring Island-class cutters in 2012, replacing them with Sentinel-class fast-response cutters. In 2018 Juneau city officials believed that Liberty would be decommissioned in 2023 and advocated with the Coast Guard that Liberty should be replaced by a fast response cutter home-ported at Auke Bay. In reply to an inquiry from a U.S. Senator in April 2018, the commandant of the Coast Guard indicated that the service planned to replace Liberty with a coastal patrol boat rather than a fast response cutter.

In 2011, the Grannies on Safari were selected as the first celebrity duo to participate in the Flat Stanley educational project. They are recognized as the Flat Grannies on Safari and have appeared in schools in Chicago as well as Ulan Bator, Mongolia to encourage exchange and student communication between the U.S. and schools abroad. In 2011, the Grannies, with a group of American tourists, arrived in Egypt one day after the beginning of the Arab Spring Revolution. Together, the Grannies experienced this moment in Egyptian history and spoke about it to international audiences. They were eventually evacuated from Luxor, Egypt to Athens, Greece where they were met by the U.S. Ambassador to Greece and his delegation. The Grannies frequently speak about their show, their travels and life as women and grandmothers at national and international events. They have participated as speakers for AARP's annual \\"Life@50\\" in 2011 and 2012, the national Black Women's Expo, Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo and for many other organizations.  Media  DVD  Beginning in 2008, the Art Explorers Inc. began releasing seasons of the Grannies on Safari in chronological order. To date, three volumes including 19 episodes have been released.

The museum's mission is \\"to transform research in early learning experience that inspire creative problem solving\\" so that children will gain skills to become the innovative problem solvers of tomorrow. The museum is geared to children from 6 months to 10 years of age with different areas of the museum tailored to a specific age group. Children have the options of exploring the 6 different sections of the museum: Art Studios, Bay Hall, Discovery Hall, Lookout Cove, Tot Spot, and Fab Lab. Each area is designed in a way to support and further the mission of the museum and provides hands-on, child-directed exploration that ignites creative thinking, flexible problem-solving, and exciting discoveries. All Museum exhibitions, both indoor and outdoor areas, are hands- on and play focused. In fact, Bay Area Discovery Museum is the only children's museum in the country to be located inside a National Park. Public programming and Discovery School preschool The museum also hosts many events and programs, allowing families to engage more deeply with the museum's missions. The Museum has its own accredited preschool, Discovery School on its premises that is grounded in child-directed learning such as the Reggio teaching method among others. Other programming at the Museum includes family classes, member programming, and camps. \\"drop-in\\" programming during the day are approximately one-hour chunks of curriculum developed around themes such as nature exploration, art exploration, or movement and singing exploration. Guests are invited to visit these programs around the museum, such as Toddler Circle Time, Storytime, The Box, Art Lab, and Nature Lab to experience varied programming centered around the mission of creative thinking and engagement. Celebrating diversity and special events Special holiday celebrations at the museum focus on celebrating the diversity of the Bay Area. Favorites include Chinese New Year, World on Stage music performances, Earth Day, Dia de Los Muertos, and Martin Luther King Jr. celebration. The museum hosts three fundraising events that are open to the public including, Goblin Jamboree, Forum (a luncheon lecture on creativity), and Annual Family Gala that allow attendees to contribute to furthering the museum's mission. Community engagement: Connections Besides programming centered at the site, the museum is actively engaged in the surrounding community in a variety of capacities. Connections, a comprehensive outreach program, aims to create sustainable relationships between the Museum and the diverse communities of the Bay Area. The Museum invites preschools to visit five times annually to experience child-directed play in our immersive exhibits. Additionally, Museum educators provide hands-on programming that deepens children's relationship to the natural world. Through exploration, collaboration and guidance from adults, big discoveries happen. Staff members visit the partnering preschools to broaden the scope of the program. Ongoing support throughout the school year helps teachers connect the Museum experience into their classroom curriculum. Center for Childhood Creativity The Bay Area Discovery Museum is also home to the Center for Childhood Creativity. The Bay Area Discovery Museum launched the Center for Childhood Creativity in 2011 to pioneer new research, thought- leadership, and teacher training programs that advance creative thinking in all children—extending its impact beyond the Museum. By partnering with academic institutions such as UC Berkeley and Stanford, the Center is able to present research in the latest childhood development research for a wide audience, including local parents who are interested in instilling creative practices in their young children. Throughout the year, the center hosts Creativity Talks and Creativity Forum, both venues to hear and engage with creativity and childhood development pioneers, with the latter being a fundraiser for the Center. The Center has recently rolled out new programs such as Parent PhD, workshops that engage parents with the latest childhood research surrounding topics such as \\"building creativity\\" and celebrating \\"failures\\" as learning experiences. The Center graciously hosts area teacher and childhood education professional for various classes and training throughout the year, in hopes of helping educators to integrate creative and fun learning methods into area classrooms. Idea Lab and STEM intensives The Museum is also reaching out to area classrooms with new STEM programming (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) for young learners. The goal of these programs is to build a strong relationship between the wide variety of STEM topics and fun experiential learning. These STEM-based Idea Labs are workshops aligned to Common Core Math and Next Generation Science Standards for Pre-K through 3rd grade. Idea Labs can be combined with a field trip to the Museum or hosted in your classroom. Facilitated by our dynamic team of Museum educators, Idea Labs provide a playful, hands-on exploration of science and math content. Students, teacher and parents all have a role to play in these active, exploratory workshops. Multi-sensory activities will encourage risk-taking, collaborative problem-solving and creative thinking. Discover it Yourself (D.I.Y.) field trips The Museum also offers D.I.Y. (Discover it Yourself) field trips to the museum for area preschools and day cares. This is self-guided Museum exploration for groups of 3-8-year-old students and their important adults. D.I.Y. Field Trips provide timed entry and departure at a discounted rate for groups of 15-80 children plus chaperones. This option provides up to 2.5 hours at the Museum and the flexibility to explore the exhibits at your own pace. Every student will go home with a coupon for discounted admission for on a future Museum visit. D.I.Y. Field Trips are a great option for preschools, early elementary classrooms, and community organizations who are looking for a shared educational experience for their group.

Japan occupied Korea at this time and had been in control since 1910. In 1945, the decision was made to have American Marines forces oversee Japanese surrender and disarmament south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would facilitate the change of power to the north. At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action. The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era. Instead each side of the 38th parallel established its own government under the influence of the occupational country; the United States in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea. Both new Korean governments discredited the other and claimed to be the only legitimate political system. Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support. South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union. The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea's request for weapons and troops. North Korea convinced the Soviet Union to supply them with the weapons and support they requested. This decision coincided with the United States withdrawing the last remaining combat troops from South Korea. North Korea saw its opportunity and attacked South Korean forces at the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950 and thus initiating the Korean War.Korea: The Forgotten War 1950-1953. Timeless Media Group, 2010. DVD.  Initial response  In response to North Korea's invasion into South Korea the United Nations convened to formulate a response. The U.N. demanded North Korea's immediate withdrawal and, when this was not met, United States Army General Douglas MacArthur was appointed supreme commander of U.N. forces. To halt the rapid progress of North Korean forces into the south Task Force Smith was deployed to the Korean front from Japan. Task Force Smith consisted of U.S. Army officers and regiments of the Army's 24th Infantry Division that were stationed in Japan as occupational forces. The 24th were under trained, poorly supplied, and outnumbered. The 24th offered very little resistance against the North Korean advance. American and South Korean troops were pushed south and in late July 1950 Task Force Smith was overrun in the city of Taejon. Troops from the Army's 25th Infantry Division were deployed to Taejon to establish a new line and pullout the decimated 24th I.D. This addition of combat troops did not stop the North Korean advance and both American and South Korean troops were pushed further south.  Battle of Osan  Map of the Battle of Osan The first battle the Americans entered in the Korean War was the Battle of Osan, where about four hundred U.S. soldiers landed in Pusan airport on the first of July. The American troops were sent off to Taejon the next morning where Major General John H. Church the head of U.S. field headquarters was confident in the US troop's strengths to push back the North Koreans. On July fifth the troops were finally put to the test when North Korean tanks crept towards Osan. The four hundred infantryman of the U.S. also called Task Force Smith opened fire on the North Koreans at 8:16 am. Only four of the North Korean tanks were destroyed and twenty-nine kept moving forward breaking the US line. At the end of the battle only two more North Korean Tanks and two regiments of North Korean infantry were destroyed. The US had lost the battle, revealing that the mere sight of US troops would not reverse the military balance in Korea. By early August, the North Korean troops had pushed back the US and South Korean troops all the way to Naktong River, which is located about thirty miles from Pusan. The two weeks of fighting following this resulted in the most casualties of US troops than any other equivalent period of this war. However, during this time the US pushed supplies and personnel to Korea and by the end of July South Koreans and US troops outnumbered the North Koreans, although the North had pushed back the US and South by an amazing amount the North had suffered over fifty thousand casualties. Also because North Koreas supply lines were so lengthy and with the US in control of the water and air replenishing their losses were slow.Stueck, W. W. (2002). Rethinking the Korean war: A new diplomatic and strategic history. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.  Incheon  Although MacArthur clearly stated that the Battle of Inchon was a 5000 to 1 gamble, it was an important military move to make. Incheon is 25 miles from Seoul on the coast and only once during September is the water even deep enough to allow the 29 foot draft of American LSTs. It was a defenders' best place to allow troops into Korea, and to push the invaders back. On September 15 the 1st Marine Division landed at the port city, taking the defending North Koreans completely by surprise, and by the end of the night over a third of Incheon was taken back.Stueck, W. W. (1995). The Korean War: An international history. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. Japan During the mid-1940s, Germany and Japan were both at a desperate state caused by World War II. Germany received a sort of benefit from the U.S. as a compensation of war and reconstruction. The Japanese on the other end were devastated by the aftermath. People were suffering, eating out of garbage, and many people starved. Meanwhile, the U.S. troops in the Korean War were in great demand of uniforms and other equipment. The American government turned to Japan for the favor, which eventually stimulated the manufacturing factories that were in jeopardy due to damage caused by World War II. Japan accepted the offer and mainly supplied U.S. troops in Korea with uniforms and other sorts of clothing. Bases were also erected in Japan for U.S. Air Force planes, such as B-29 Superfortress bombers.

The book was first published on August 12, 2008 through Delacorte Books for Young Readers, and focused upon a young girl discovering her true identity. The Order of Odd-Fish was named a Smithsonian Notable Books for Children for 2008, and in 2013 the character of Ken Kiang was named by Daniel Kraus as one of the \\"most evil characters in literature\\".  Synopsis  Thirteen-year-old Jo Larouche has spent her entire life with her Aunt Lily in the deserts of California. Left with Lily as a baby, the only real clues she has about her origins are a note with the name \\"Jo\\" and a warning that she was a dangerous baby. After the events of a Christmas party prompt Lily and Jo to leave California for the surreal and outlandish Eldritch City, Jo finally begins to learn some of the truth behind her mysterious past. The two join a group known as the Order of Odd-Fish that researches information others would see as useless. But, even as they spend their days going on unconventional quests and dealing with the eccentric Odd-Fish knights, threats from a dangerous and enigmatic source will prompt Jo to claim her true destiny.  Marketing  While The Order of Odd-Fish was released in 2008, Kennedy began promoting the book more heavily in 2009 after reading that a fan had created a hat based upon his book. Kennedy then released a series of satirical blogs and videos, most notably one where he \\"whimsically insulted Neil Gaiman\\". The post was well received by Gaiman, who in turn promoted the blog. In 2010 Kennedy held an art show at a Chicago gallery, where he showcased fanart based on the book.  Reception  Critical reception for The Order of Odd-Fish was mixed while reader reaction was generally more positive. Reviewers for Kirkus Reviews and the School Library Journal both gave predominantly negative reviews for the book, with the School Library Journal stating that they doubted that many \\"teen fantasy fans will be willing to wade through the text, no matter how likable the heroine and how fascinating the world of Eldritch City\\". Booklist gave a more mixed review, saying that the book was good in \\"small doses\\" although \\"some might find it difficult to sustain interest in such determined high jinks\\".

Background  Emilio Aguinaldo had returned from exile in Hong Kong and was amassing a large force to drive out the Spanish from Cavite. General Leopoldo Garcia Peña, the Spanish military commander at Cavite, was hard-pressed with 2,800 Spanish troops scattered in various detachments in Cavite Province. The combined forces of Generals Luciano San Miguel, Mariano Noriel, Artemio Ricarte and Juan Cailles, having with them about 6,000–8,000 troops, who began attacking and decimating Peña's units one by one. A column of 500 infantrymen was rushed from Manila to reinforce Peña.  Battle  Initially, the Spanish garrison in Calamba, holed up in the town church, realizing that a resistance could still be held for the larger force of 500 to arrive and help them, before ultimately going to Cavite. The Spaniards chose to wait as the Filipino revolutionaries besieged the church. Lacking guns, and lacking even more ammunition, Paciano Rizal devised a ploy to get the Spaniards to surrender, he ordered that every time the Filipino column opened fire on the church, other troops, those without guns, would light up firecrackers to create the illusion that the Filipinos had plenty of guns, sure enough the Spaniards fell for it, and surrendered a few days later. As the Spanish column approached, the revolutionaries under Jose Rizal's brother, General Paciano Rizal who was also the main commander of all revolutionary forces in the province, counterattacked the Spanish column in his hometown Calamba. The revolutionaries then staged an ambush in the vicinity, and many Spaniards became casualties and several of them were captured during the battle.  Aftermath  As a result of their defeat the relief column never came to Peña, who surrendered after the battle of Alapan. The revolutionaries were finished liberating all of Cavite by nightfall of May 31 the same year. Thus, western parts of Laguna were cleared of Spanish rule, leading the way to the full victory of Filipinos within the whole province.

History The Devil's Bellows fortification near Lathbury Barracks During World War II the extensive tunnels within the Rock of Gibraltar were further extended. This included a tunnel that joined these barracks to the Gun Operations Room. This operations room was well connected to other tunnels meaning that it was possible to travel to the north face of Gibraltar whilst remaining within the rock. Some of this journey would be down the Great North Road where you could take a ride on a passing truck. The tunnel between the operations room and the barracks was closed following a number of falls including one that killed a civilian visitor. Lieutenant Colonel Mohamed Amekrane who had ordered an unsuccessful coup against King Hassan II of Morocco, was once imprisoned at Lathbury Barracks. The British Government extradited him to Morocco where he was executed. The British Government later made an out of court settlement in 1972 with his widow Malika Amekrane to avoid a case at the European Commission of Human Rights regarding his extradition.Out-of-court settlement paid by UK to Frau Malika Amekrane (widow of Lieutenant Colonel Amekrane)..., UK National Archives, 16 August 1972, accessed 8 May 2013 In 1995 the government furnished the barracks with 1,000 bunkbeds to accommodate the athletes competing at the Island Games hosted by Gibraltar that year.

According to historical sources, Cao Cao killed Lü Boshe's family in 189 or 190 when he passed by Lü's house on his way home to Chenliu (陳留; around present-day Kaifeng, Henan) after escaping from the imperial capital, Luoyang. Cao Cao's motive behind the murders remains ambiguous. One source claimed that he killed Lü Boshe's family in self-defence while two other texts stated that he suspected that Lü's family were plotting to harm him so he killed them preemptively. This event was dramatised in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, in which Lü Boshe himself also died at the hands of Cao Cao. In historical records There are three accounts of the murders of Lü Boshe's family. The Wei Shu (魏書) recorded: The Shiyu (世語) recorded: The Zaji (雜記) recorded: In Romance of the Three Kingdoms The incident was dramatised in Chapter 4 of the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. In the novel, Lü Boshe is a sworn brother of Cao Cao's father, Cao Song, so Cao Cao regards him as an uncle. Cao Cao and Chen Gong pass by Lü Boshe's house while they are on their way to Cao Cao's home after Cao Cao escaped from Luoyang following his failed attempt on Dong Zhuo's life. Lü Boshe gives them a warm reception and instructs his family and servants to treat the guests well while he travels to town to purchase more items for a feast. During their stay in Lü Boshe's house, Cao Cao overhears the sharpening of knives and a conversation among Lü Boshe's servants about whether to \\"kill or to tie up first\\". He suspects that Lü Boshe is pretending to be hospitable towards him while actually plotting to harm him. He and Chen Gong dash out and indiscriminately kill everyone in Lü Boshe's household. Later, they discover that the servants were actually talking about slaughtering a pig for the feast and that they had killed innocent people. As it is too late for regrets, Cao Cao and Chen Gong immediately pack their belongings and leave the house. Along the way, they meet Lü Boshe, who is returning from his errand. When Lü Boshe asks them to stay, Cao Cao asks him: \\"Who is that behind you?\\" When Lü Boshe turns around, Cao Cao stabs him from behind and kills him. A shocked Chen Gong asks Cao Cao: \\"Just now, you made a genuine mistake when you killed those people. But what about now?\\". Cao Cao replies: \\"If Lü Boshe goes home and sees his family members all dead, do you think he will let us off? If he brings soldiers to pursue us, we will be in deep trouble.\\" Chen Gong says: \\"It is a grave sin to kill someone with the intention of doing so.\\" Cao Cao remarks: \\"I'd rather do wrong to the world than allow the world to do wrong to me.\\" (寧教我負天下人，休教天下人負我) Chen Gong does not respond and he leaves Cao Cao that night.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 4. Analysis Luo Guanzhong, who wrote the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, distorted the exact words Cao Cao said after he killed Lü Boshe's family. The most significant change is the replacing of \\"others\\" (人; literally \\"people\\") with \\"world\\" (天下人; literally \\"people under Heaven\\"). Yi Zhongtian, a Xiamen University history professor, speculated that Cao Cao was probably trying to console himself after mistakenly killing Lü Boshe's family by speaking in a regretful tone (\\"heartrendingly remarked\\"). Yi believed that Luo Guanzhong had deliberately changed the words in the quote to reflect that Cao Cao had no sense of remorse because \\"world\\" carries greater weight than \\"others\\", so as to enhance Cao's image as a villain in his novel.

The school was a technical school in the 1930s and in 1950 became the Gibraltar Grammar School until comprehensive education was introduced in the 1970s. The building was then home to Sacred Heart Middle School but was no longer run by the Congregation of Christian Brothers. In July 2015, Sacred Heart Middle School became St Bernards Middle School and moved to a different location. The building was renovated and now houses Prior Park School, Gibraltar's first co- educational, Christian-Catholic Independent Secondary School. Prior Park School is the fourth school in the Prior Park family, the other three being located in Bath and Wiltshire, UK. History The verandah today showing the view of Gibraltar Harbour It had its origins when Christian Brothers arrived in Gibraltar on 28 October 1835 and set up a school there. When the Brothers arrived on the Rock, some 260 pupils were dependent upon a mock school set up at Gunners' Parade, and reported that the children were \\"extremely ignorant, without any knowledge of the English language, thus making it next to impossible for the Brothers to use their English textbooks for their instruction.\\" Others reported that the real reason was that the brothers could not speak Spanish and the children had not learnt English. This new school was to be a Catholic School unlike the public one in Flat Bastion Road and the Methodist School run by William Harris Rule and his wife. The Christian Brothers were always associated with the building at Sacred Heart Terrace which was originally constructed in 1884 with funds from the Bishop and the Government. By 1891 the school building and the grounds had been extended. The \\"Line Wall College\\" (The old Hassans Building) was noted in 1930 for the education that it supplied to \\"well to do\\" children.Gibraltar Directory for 1930, accessed 8 May 2013 In 1950 the Gibraltar Grammar School moved to the Sacred Heart Terrace with the brothers still in charge and the building was extended in the 1960s. Comprehensive education was introduced in Gibraltar in the 1970s and the school eventually closed and the building was closed too in 1977 and abandoned. The brothers received the Freedom of the City on 25 June 1977, and left Gibraltar shortly after. They numbered only five at the time of their departure, but the Christian Brothers had educated generations of boys, and the people of Gibraltar showed their appreciation of the brothers through many ceremonies and celebrations.

Dickless is notable for their unique growling shrieking vocal style. Kelly Canary (aka Lisa Fiorella), the original vocalist, had a distinct growling scream that lead the quartet through short (approximately 20 minutes) and loud live performances. During their first few years, their loud and abrasive sound was new and unusual for an all-female music group. Simultaneously, their short discography included song titles and a song cover, \\"I'm a Man\\" by Bo Diddley, that were blatantly ironic given their abrasive sound and female members. The band name itself is meant to be satire. The group's period of activity coincided with the emerging \\"Riot grrrl\\" music culture.  History  The original lineup consisted of Lisa Buckner (drums), Kelly Canary (vocals), Jana McCall (bass), Kerry Green (guitar). Lisa Buckner was soon replaced by Lisa Smith from Atomic 61 on drums. After a few years, Kelly Canary quit to form the Teen Angels. Lisa Smith would also join Teen Angels later. Sub Pop employee Megan Jasper became the new vocalist after Kelly Canary's last show. Jennie Trower eventually replaced Jana McCall on bass.  Discography  The group had a relatively short discography during their sporadic nine-year existence. Their entire discography was seven short songs (most songs were between 1:00 to 2:00 minutes) spread across seven different releases (not counting the planned, but never released Anthology album).

On the one hand, the development of our modern human behaviour in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic is studied at the research centre and on the other hand, the findings of these studies are conveyed to the public in the museum. Monrepos is one of the leading institutions for the research of early human history. Structure Monrepos is part of the Romano-Germanic Central Museum (Mainz) a member of the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community. Another provider for Monrepos is the Prinz Maximilian zu Wied-Stiftung, supported by the Förderkreis Altsteinzeit e.V., which assists with research, teaching and the conveying of research results. Monrepos collaborates closely with the Institute for Prehistoric Archaeology of the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz. Location Monrepos (French: \\"my rest\\") is a historical recreation area located on the hills above the town of Neuwied in a transition zone between the Middle Rhine valley and the Westerwald. In the extensive forests of Monrepos several long-distance hiking trails cross such as the Rheinsteig, the Rheinhöhenweg Trail, and a trail along the remains of the limes. The previous summer residence of the princes of Wied is today the centre of an ensemble of historic buildings from the 18th and 19th century. History Monrepos after finished reconstruction works in 2013 Until 2012, Monrepos had been named \\"research unit Palaeolithic“ (Forschungsbereich Altsteinzeit) of the RGZM and \\"museum for Ice Age archaeology“ (Museum für die Archäologie des Eiszeitalters). The discovery and study of famous Palaeolithic sites in the Neuwied Basin such as Niederbieber, Gönnersdorf, and Bad Breisig led to the foundation of the research unit Palaeolithic of the RGZM in 1984. Along with the museum for Ice Age archaeology the research unit has been located on Schloss Monrepos since 1988. The house was built in 1909. It was originally named \\"Waldheim\\" (forest home) and served as home for the princely widows. In 1986, Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Wied brought the Schloss into the foundation Prince Maximilian of Wied Sabine Gaudzinski-Windheuser, Olaf Jöris (Hrsg.): 600.000 Jahre Menschheitsgeschichte in der Mitte Europas.

Besides functioning as the head of the Forschungsbereich Altsteinzeit, Gerhard Bosinski, the founder of the institute, was also professor at the institute of prehistoric archaeology of the University of Cologne. Since 2003 Sabine Gaudzinski-Windheuser has been the head of Monrepos and she is also the professor at the institute of prehistory and early history of the University of Mainz. 2005 the exhibition of the museum for Ice Age archaeology was modernised but in 2011 the museum had to be closed temporary due to extensive renovation and reconstruction works of Schloss Monrepos. The museum is re- organised currently and will be re-opened with a new concept, probably in late 2013. Temporal and geographic frame of research The research at Monrepos encompasses the early human history of the Old World from its beginnings to the invention and spread of agriculture and stock farming. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the studies focused particularly on the rich archaeological sites from the Neuwied basin and its vicinity.:M. Baales 2005, Archäologie des Eiszeitalters. Archäologie an Mittelrhein und Mosel 16, Koblenz 2005 The Lower Palaeolithic site at Miesenheim is approximately 600,000 years old and among the oldest settlement sites in Central Europe.E.

Verlag des Römisch- Germanischen Zentralmuseums Mainz, Mainz 2006, 18-26 Important sites of the Magdalenian were excavated and studied at Andernach-Martinsberg and Gönnersdorf. Many sites studied at Monrepos such as Niederbieber, Bad Breisig, Kettig, Urbar, and the upper horizons of Andernach-Martinsberg were attributed to the so-called Federmesser groups which are a similar behavioural development as the French Azilian in the late Ice Age. Their remarkably good preservation due to the cover by tephras of the Laacher See volcanic eruption made exceptional insights into the land-use of this period possible S. Gaudzinski-Windheuser, O.

Guiding principle of research The research and the conveying of its results aim at understanding the essential behavioural characteristics of modern humans and the development of these characteristics during the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods from 2.5 Million years to approximately 7,500 years ago. Monrepos is among the few archaeological research institutions which are guided by an own principle of research. This principle defines the objectives of research and the strategy necessary to achieve these objectives. The principle of research is based on an integrative, holistic understanding of science. Thereby, it merges the traditional dichotomy of Social and Natural Sciences. Different sources of evidence and variable contexts are connected diachronically in the principle of research. They are pooled in three research units: \\"time slices“, \\"strategies”and “social organisation”. \\"Time slices“ relates to the group of questions of where, when, and in which frame of references human behaviour evolved. The research units \\"strategies“ and \\"social organisation“ try to identify survival strategies and behavioural patterns as well as their social embedding. The research principle is oriented diachronically and perspectively. That means that the research is systematically looking at different time periods and levels of resolution. Large frames allow for an orientation, whereas more detailed frames allow for a punctually high resolution. By the use of a synthetic comparison of the three research units and the comparative transfer between the different time periods and levels of resolution, it is possible to reconstruct the development of human behaviour in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic. Research foci Sculpture of a Gönnersdorf venus figurine Particularly relevant research foci in the study of the behavioural development of early humans and hominids are the processes relating to subsistence patterns, mobility, settlement behaviour, and land-use patterns of Palaeolithic and Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. Calibration and Dating programmes Since the mid-1980s, Monrepos has been involved in the construction and improvement of an absolute chronology of the European Palaeolithic. In this process, comprehensive dating programs of the Upper Palaeolithic were initiated Innovative methods of radiocarbon calibration were developed by Olaf Jöris (Monrepos) and Bernhard Weninger (University of Cologne). These methods became constantly better and made precise calibration of increasingly older radiocarbon dates possible by the connection with high- resolution climate data sets. The calibration program CalPal is based on this approach and was first created by Olaf Jöris and Bernhard Weninger in the mid-1990s. Subsistence Hunting of big game is an important ability in the development of early hominid subsistence. Monrepos has set an international standard in the study of hominid hunting by the use of an elaborated set of archaeozoological methods and a diachronic perspective. For instance, big game hunting by early hominids and its evolutionary relevance was demonstrated for the first time in the archaeological record by a member of Monrepos The Role of Early Humans in the Accumulation of European Lower and Middle Palaeolithic Bone Assemblages. Ergebnisse eines Kolloquiums (1999) Currently, the research mainly focuses on Neanderthals' hunting behaviour in the context of land use. This behaviour is examined particularly in cave sites such as the Balve cave or the Moravian Kůlna Cave and at the largest Middle Palaeolithic open air site in Neumark-Nord. Further research projects relating to subsistence concentrate on the late Ice age and the early Holocene. Studies from concentrations at the Mesolithic site of Duvensee were the first to show the significance of vegetation resources (hazelnuts) in the early Holocene subsistence. Settlement behaviour The investigation and analysis of the evolution of settlement and land use behaviour represent another research focus at MONREPOS. Since its inception the systematic analysis of extensively- excavated open-air sites and settlement structures has always been a focus at MONREPOS. Current research involves the application of GIS supported geo- statistical approaches that allow for quantitative and verifiable analyses of settlement dynamics. .S. Gaudzinski-Windheuser, O.

It was thus possible to conclusively demonstrate that art was a major component in the Palaeolithic of Central Europe and “type Gönnersdorf” figurines represent a major category in art studies.Die Kunst der Eiszeit in Deutschland und in der Schweiz. Habelt, Bonn 1982, . The particular manner in which art is studied at MONREPOS is characterised by a contextualised approach that aims to understand the principles and rules behind patterns in design and production. The plaquettes are currently part of a detailed 3-D analysis.A. Güth: New scientific findings confirming \\"The Oldest Representation of Childbirth\\".

Education and promotion of young scientists Members of Monrepos regularly give lectures and seminars about the evolution of human behaviour in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic at the Institute of Prehistory and Early History at the university of Mainz. The archaeological education is supplemented by internships, excursions, und field schools allowing for direct participation in science and conveying. Junior scientists are promoted individually by a mentoring programme and also financially by scholarships such as the Prince Maximilian of Wied- scholarship.Ausbildung des wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchses.

Due to the renovations the museum was closed in 2010. It is expected to re-open with a new concept and exhibit at the end of 2013. Conveying In addition to the Museum and its teaching involvement at the Institute for Pre- and Early History at Mainz University, Monrepos has also developed other formats of public outreach. The Rudolf Virchow lecture is one of the most longstanding public archaeological lectures in Germany. This annual event honours the accomplishments of an eminent researcher in the field of Palaeolithic archaeology, who presents the results of his or her research in a popular lecture held at Neuwied castle. The “SteinZeitReise” (“Trip to the Stone Age”) is an annual „hands on „event held on Pentecost Sunday at Monrepos. Members of staff demonstrate various aspects of Palaeolithic life and the public is invited to try out flint- knapping, atlatl-throwing and archaeological excavation.“Steinzeitreise: Pfingstsonntag in Schloss Monrepos“.

The faunal inventory consists primarily of European ice age faunas and/or their extant representatives. In addition to large mammals (mammoth, rhino, bison horse), the collection also includes remains of extant smaller mammals and birds. The taphonomic collection includes modern and archaeological materials that exhibit various pathologies and show signatures of specific taphonomic processes and agents, as well as experimentally modified bone. Lithic raw material collection The raw material collection includes samples of flint, which served as raw material for the production of artefacts during the Middle- and Upper Palaeolithic. The collection currently houses approximately 230 samples from various locales, with the majority of samples coming from locales in the Rhineland. Collection of archaeological artefacts The artefact collection is made up of approximately 4500 artefacts from the Middle- and Upper Palaeolithic. Specimens include both authentic pieces as well as copies made by restoration department at the RGZM. An important component of the artefact collection is the Venus statue archive. With over 50 specimens the venus collection is the biggest of its kind world-wide. It includes originals and copies of all female figurines known from the Mid-Upper Palaeolithic.S. Wolf 2009.

He is a Jubo League leader of Bangladesh Awami League. Rana Plaza collapse Rana and his father built Rana Plaza in 2006, after they reportedly had bullied off co- owners and falsified deeds to acquire full possession. He obtained permits from political allies to expand the building to five floors. On April 23, 2013, explosion-like sounds led people to bring in an engineer to inspect the building. After observing large cracks in supporting columns, the engineer fled the building and urged everyone to evacuate. Rana, who fielded local journalists on the bottom floor, told these reporters that the plaster on the wall was broken. The next day, Rana and the factory owners urged workers to return to their jobs. When a generator on an upper floor switched on and shook the building, the building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and wounding an estimated 2,500 others. Rana's building was not built to facilitate factories. It was built to store shops and other small stores. Rana Plaza was not strong enough to handle the vibrations and power from the heavy machinery used by factories. Arrest and trial Rapid Action Battalion members arrested Sohel Rana from Benapole in Jessore District on April 28, four days after the Savar tragedy. In March 2014, Rana was granted six months' bail in the High Court. This prompted angry reactions from labour leaders. However, Rana was not released from jail as other charges filed by police were pending. On 29 August 2017, Rana was sentenced to a maximum three year imprisonment by a court for failing to declare his personal wealth to Bangladesh's anti-graft commission. The trials for murder and other charges have been delayed due to appeals to the higher court.

Following the successful Blaxland, Lawson, and Wentworth expedition to find a route through the \\"impenetrable\\" Blue Mountains in 1813, this allowed the colony to expand onto the vast fertile plains of the west. Settlement of the new land was initially slow, but following a change of government, Governor Thomas Brisbane came to power allowing a flood of land grants to the west of the Blue Mountains. The enormous influx of British colonists put massive strain on the traditional food sources and sacred landmarks of the Wiradjuri. By early 1824, war had broken out in which the Wiradjuri adopted a guerrilla-style approach. After Governor Thomas Brisbane declared martial law the resistance soon collapsed in late 1824. Background Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson Attempts to cross the Blue Mountains had been made from 1790 onwards with convicts seeking a way to escape and adventurers eager to explore the region. However, all of these attempts failed and it was to be over 20 years before a way across was found. In May 1813, Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Charles Wentworth set out with a plan to find a passage through the impenetrable Blue Mountains. After 21 days of traveling through of rugged terrain, the party reached Mount Blaxland. From here they saw a vast expanse of forest and grass in which Blaxland wrote was rich enough \\"to support the stock of the colony for the next thirty years\\". This was in fact the land of the Wiradjuri people, one of the largest language groups in Australia. The Wiradjuri inhabited an area bounded by the Blue Mountains in the east, the western slopes in the south, and the change of open forest to grassy plains in the north and west. The tribes led by Windradyne lived in the eastern parts of this territory, connected to the other groups by a common language as well as cultural and trade links.P. Read, A Hundred Years War, Canberra: ANU, 1988, p.2 Governor Lachlan Macquarie Governor Lachlan Macquarie After passage through the Blue Mountains had been secured, assistant surveyor George Evans and his party had been instructed to further explore the country. Evans' reports confirmed of excellent pastures beyond the mountains to which Governor Macquarie ordered a road be built from the Nepean River. In less than six months the road had been completed. Soon after Governor Lachlan Macquarie and a large accompanying party set out to view the country. The journey took nine days by coach from Parramatta and on arrival Macquarie's welcoming ceremony was observed by seven Wiradjuri.Assistant Surveyor George Evans, Journal, 21/12/1813 Macquarie wrote: Three days later Macquarie inaugurated the town of Bathurst, then continued to tour the surrounding country. In his journal, Macquarie writes of being visited by three male natives and that \\"to the best looking and stoutest of them I gave a piece of yellow cloth in exchange for his mantle, which he presented me with\\".Macquarie, Journal of Tours in NSW and Van Diemen's Land, 1810–, entry of 10/5/1815 It has been theorised that this unknown Wiradjuri man may have been Windradyne, but this cannot be proven. Nevertheless, it would be another eight years before he would become famous to the colony. In 1820, the population of Bathurst was only 114 due to Macquarie's slow and cautious approach to new settlement. His experience of the Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars of 1795–1816 may also have made him hesitant to start a new conflict. It seems that the Wiradjuri were willing to tolerate this slow level of growth and peaceful relations were maintained during this period. Governor Thomas Brisbane Governor Thomas Brisbane In December 1821, Macquarie resigned partly due to undermining forces within his own government. His replacement was Governor Thomas Brisbane who had different views through which he began asserting his authority. Under Brisbane's hand settlement laws were changed leading to a flood of land grants across the Blue Mountains. An enormous influx of the British onto the Wiradjuri lands great strain on traditional food sources, and destroyed some of the Wiradjuri social and sacred sites. In response, the Wiradjuri resistance was born, well aware that they had no chance against guns, they adopted a guerrilla-warfare approach in which attacks were made against outlying and undefended stations. Pre-war violence Following Governor Brisbane's decision to open the flood gates to the west of the Blue Mountains, various attacks were soon made against the growing settlement. In 1822, Wiradjuri warriors attacked a station on the Cudgegong River in which they drove away the stockman, let the cattle out of the yard and killed several of the sheep.J.P.M. Long, Bathurst, 1813–40 quoted in Salisbury and Gresser, op cit, p.19 More attacks followed with the murder of convict hut-keepers, scattered herds and speared cattle. Stockmen were intimidated and would not leave their huts to round up the cattle and bring them in without protection. The government centre at Swallow Creek was soon abandoned in fear of attack. In late 1823, Windradyne (known as Saturday by the British) was captured for the first time. The Sydney Gazette described the situation in the following: Course of the war Potato Field Incident In early 1824, on the river flats opposite of the town of Bathurst, a farmer in a friendly gesture offered a group of passing Wiradjuri people some potatoes. The next day the families returned to the field, however, with no concept of private ownership of food supplies they began helping themselves. The farmer then fired upon the group and in the mayhem several Wurudjuri people were killed and some wounded. One of the survivors of this misunderstanding was Windradyne, enraged at the attack he and his warriors immediately began a series of violent attacks against nearby stations.Salisbury and Gresser, op cit, p.22 One settler account describes an encounter that took place soon after the Potato Field Incident: Revenge attacks Similar attacks occurred nearby, at \\"The Mill\\" and \\"Warren Gunyah\\". These attacks included men being speared, weapons stolen, buildings burned and stock killed. While Windradyne and his warriors engaged the area north-east of Bathurst, to the south relative tribes also attacked, terrorising settlers and driving off cattle. Revenge parties were formed in which a group of armed servants attacked and killed three Wiradjuri women. For several months the attacks by the Wiradjuri continued, they struck at unexpected locations then retreated back to the bush. By August 1824, the Sydney Gazette described it as \\"to have exposed the strength and wealth of the Colony... to destruction\\".Sydney Gazette, 5/8/1824 Proclamation of martial law Windradyne On 14 August Governor Brisbane issued a proclamation of martial law. Governor Brisbane's declaration read: A detachment of the 40th Regiment was rushed to Bathurst, bringing the total number of soldiers to 75. Together with an armed militia of settlers they began murdering the native population. Despite martial law being declared it seemed to have had little impact on the activities of the Wiradjuri. According to W.H. Suttor, \\"The proclamation of martial law was as undecipherable to the natives as an Egyptian hieroglyph\\".W.H. Suttor, Australian Stories Retold and Sketches of Country Life, Bathurst The natives continued with their attacks against the British, and skirmishes followed by massacres of warriors attempting to bury their dead. However, the majority of victims were native women and children gunned down from horseback, poisoned or driven into gorges. In October, the Sydney Gazette summed up the situation stating that \\"Bathurst and its surrounding vicinity is engaged in an exterminating war\\".Sydney Gazette 11/8/1824 Battle of Bathurst The Battle of Bathurst began on 10 September when a Wiradjuri war party attacked a station on the Cudgegong River, they drove off the cattle before being pursued by the station hands.Six Australian Battlefields, by Al Grassby and Marji Hill In an ambush, the stationhands were chased back and in the retreat three Wiradjuri warriors were shot. The following day the station hands returned to find the war parties' camp deserted as they were burying their dead, however most of the weapons were left in the camp and were subsequently destroyed. As the Wiradjuri returned to the war camp, the station hands fired on them killing at least sixteen and wounding many more. Peace At the outset of martial law, Windradyne's people had been informed that military operations against them would continue until their leaders were given up. Windradyne himself had a reward of 500 acres of land upon his head. By late 1824, large numbers of Wiradjuri were surrendering themselves to the government. However, Windradyne continued to elude the soldiers and as such martial law remained in place for a further seven weeks. On 11 December 1824, martial law was finally repealed, and on 28 December Windradyne appeared at the head of his people in Parramatta to attend the Governor's annual feast. He wore the word \\"peace\\" on his hat and knew the soldiers could not arrest him because of the possibility of a riot with so many Aborigines there. The Sydney Gazette described Windradyne as: Aftermath On 13 December 1824 Governor Brisbane wrote a letter to Major J.T.Morisset, Commandant at Bathurst, thanking him for effecting 'the purpose of the proclamation...by the judicious measures taken by you and the other magistrates at Bathurst, the aboriginal natives have learned to respect our power.' He goes on to say that 'it is impossible perhaps at all times to prevent the infliction of injury upon them by individuals and...if justice cannot always be done, it deserves consideration upon such occasion whether the wrong may not be repaired by compensation. For this service and for rewards to the natives who assisted in the police, I have directed £50 subject to detailed accounts of its expenditure to be at your disposal.' This letter implies tacit acknowledgement that the punishment of the local Wiradjuri was excessive and unlawful. It also indicates that there was use of aboriginal police aides in the tracking of the Wiradjuri people. Colonel William Stewart, appointed Head of NSW Police and Lt Governor of the Colony helped oversee some of the government response to the Bathurst Uprising. His reward was to stand on a high point (Mount Pleasant) at the edge of Bathurst township and declare his right to all the land he could see. Governor Darling formalised the grant of 3200 acres in 1826. It included unlimited and unrestricted water rights to the Macquarie River. The historical records, original deeds and agreements are held by the family at \\"Strath\\" Bathurst. Today the great wealth that came to Stewart and his descendants continues to be seen in the form of Abercrombie House that was later built on the land grant. At the conclusion of the war, the NSW colonial government also recognised the need to have a mounted infantry to effectively place the frontier under British control. Foot soldiers were proven to be an inadequate force on the wide plains of the interior. As a result, in 1825, Colonel Stewart formed the NSW Mounted Police. This force, which was manned with soldiers not civilians, initially consisted of two detachments, one stationed in Bathurst and the other at Maitland. The NSW Mounted Police became the principal instrument of enforcement of colonial rule on the frontier for the next 15 years.

She is best known for her work with \\"twin towns,\\" where she draws parallels between settlements and suburbs surrounding South African cities to other places around the world. Josephy's work has been displayed in numerous exhibitions both nationally and internationally.  Background  Born in 1969, Svea Josephy was raised in Cape Town, South Africa and currently resides in Rondebosh, a primarily residential southern suburb of Cape Town. Josephy first became interested in photography when she was a child. She had a darkroom in her home when her stepfather went through an amateur photography phase, which prompted her interest in photography. Her first camera was an old Olympus Trip 35. Today however, she mostly uses a Hasselbald camera.  Studies  Josephy completed her Bachelor of Arts (in Fine Art) at the Michaelis School of Fine Art at the University of Cape Town, in the late 1980s to early 1990s. Josephy then in 2001, completed her Master of Fine Arts cum laude at the University of Stellenbosch.  Work  Josephy's primary focus in her photographic work has been the study of how identity and landscape are constructed. Specifically, she is most well known for drawing parallels between \\"twin towns\\" in South Africa and in other parts of the world. Her project of \\"twin towns\\" examines the peculiar names of South Africa's settlements and suburbs. Examples include: Sun City, Lost City, Lapland, Beverley Hills, Egoli, Cuba, Kosovo, Lusaka, Malibu, Hyde Park, Green Park, Lavender Hill, Athlone, Harare, Waterfront, Potsdam, Bosnia, Beirut, Iraq and Hanover Park. These names evoke certain images that can be connected and related to various parks, streets, cities and countries located all over the globe. Josephy mostly concentrates on the various settlements that surround cities in South Africa. She focuses on tracing the complex set of relationships, identifying both differences and parallels, with places or events after which South African settlements are named. Her images are for the most part presented in diptychs, which exhibit the ‘original’ and the ‘copy’ in contrast to one another.  Inspirations and influences  Bernd and Hilla Becher, Andreas Gursky, Thomas Struth, Candida Hoffer and Wolfgang Tillmans, Stephen Shore, Robert Adams, Paul Graham, Martin Parr and Ed Burtynsky. Among South African photographers, Josephy is particularly interested in the work of David Goldblatt, Dave Southwood, Guy Tillim, Mikhael Subotsky, Santu Mofekeng, Pieter Hugo and Jo Ractliffe.  Awards and scholarships  Josephy has received the following awards and scholarships: Prix du Ministre de la Culture DAKART 2010 9th biennial of Contemporary African Art, IFAM, Dakar, Senegal, the Gordon Institute for Performing and Creative Arts (GIPCA) Project Award (2009), National Arts Council Award (2008), the A.W.

History Boom Cumberland was born when gold was discovered there in 1872 and the first prospecting claim was registered in that same year. By 1878, it was one of the major producers of gold in the Etheridge goldfield. The Cumberland Company dammed nearby Cumberland Creek to create a permanent water supply for the township. High levels of gold production continued through the 1880s peaking in 1886, and the town grew to a population of about 400 people. In 1885 a police station and telegraph station were established. Cumberland Post Office opened on 3 April 1885 and closed in 1929. Both the Queensland Government Savings Bank and the Bank of New South Wales opened branch offices in 1887. The township was officially declared in 1889. The school opened in 1891. In 1894 there were four hotels. In 1891 a tramway 800 metres long was built to transport the ore from the mine to the battery. To ensure a steady gradient for the heavy ore trucks, the tramway required cutting, embanking and bridges, which made it very expensive to build. Bust By the 1890s, the easily obtained gold had been removed and a cyanide treatment plant was built to extract gold from the tailings. The mine and tramway closed in 1897 and the population decreased from that time. In 1899 the telegraph station closed and only one hotel remained. In 1901 only 106 people remained in the town. In 1901, Cumberland made the headline for the \\"Cumberland Poisoning Case\\". On 20 November 1901, two men, John \\"Scotty\\" Wilson and Edward Hollywood, were drinking at the hotel and then entered one of the bedrooms where they found a beer bottle and drank from it. Unfortunately it contained muriatic acid. Both men were taken to Georgetown Hospital, where Hollywood died on 22 November and Wilson on 24 November. The police found there were no suspicious circumstances.Queensland Registrar-General, Register of Births, Deaths and Marriages The school closed in 1915, while the post office and the last remaining hotel closed in 1930.

It is a public industrial and commercial establishment (EPIC) founded in 1984, with its Head Office in Paris. In France, CIRAD has two research centres, one in Montpellier (Lavalette campus) and the other in nearby Montferrier-sur-Lez (Baillarguet campus, which has an ecotron, amongst other facilities) and research stations in the French overseas regions. Through its twelve regional offices spread over every continent, CIRAD works with more than 100 countries.  History  CIRAD was founded in 1984 from nine tropical research institutes, most dating back to the 1940s. The institutes were primarily non- profit-making organizations, each working to promote a specific production chain. They joined forces in 1958 to form a liaison committee specializing in the French overseas regions, before merging in 1970 to form the Groupement d'étude et de recherche pour le développement de l'agronomie tropicale (GERDAT), the direct predecessor to CIRAD. Original institutes: * Institut de recherches pour les huiles et oléagineux (IRHO); * Institut de recherches sur les fruits et agrumes (IRFA); * Institut de recherches sur le caoutchouc (IRCA); * Institut d'élevage et de médecine vétérinaire des pays tropicaux (IEMVT); * Centre technique forestier tropical (CTFT); * Institut de Recherches du Coton et des Textiles Exotiques (IRCT); * Institut français du café, du cacao et autres plantes stimulantes (IFCC); * Institut de recherches agronomiques tropicales et des cultures vivrières (IRAT); * Centre d'études et d'expérimentation du machinisme agricole tropical (CEEMAT).  Mandate  CIRAD's main task is to contribute to rural development in tropical and subtropical countries through research activities, experimentation, training (in France and overseas) and the dissemination of scientific and technical information. It works with more than 100 countries in Africa, Asia, the Pacific, Latin America and Europe. Its operations are conducted at its own centres and those belonging to national agricultural research systems in its partner countries. CIRAD makes its scientific and institutional expertise available to fuel public policy in those countries and the global debate on the main issues surrounding agriculture. It also supports French scientific diplomacy.  Human, material and financial resources  CIRAD has a staff of 1650 (including 856 researchers). Its annual operating budget totals 200 million euros, two thirds of which is covered by the State research and technological development budget (BCRD) and the remainder by contractual resources.  Main CIRAD activities in Montpellier  * Research in interaction with field projects. The Montpellier centre provides scientific methods (genome analysis, crop improvement), techniques (in vitro culture, molecular biology, mineral analyses) and tools (databases, statistics). * Services to researchers and farmers in warm regions (tropical disease identification, choice of control methods, varietal breeding, wood analyses, foodstuffs). * Expertise: project design and assessment, and national and international agricultural research policy support. * Training: the centre receives more than 800 researchers and technicians each year. * Scientific and technical information: publishing journals, books and CD-ROMs.  Organization   Scientific departements  CIRAD has three scientific departments: * Biological Systems (BIOS) * Performance of Tropical Production and Processing Systems (PERSYST) * Environment and Societies (ES). It is split into 33 research units: nine internal research units (UPRs), 23 joint research units (UMRs) and a service unit (US). Since 2006, its publishing operations have been under the banner of Editions Quae, which is based at INRA.

Released 47 years after his debut album, Sophisticated Beggar, it is his first studio release in 13 years. Background When questioned during a Reuters interview about the time span between his album releases, Harper explained: \\"I thought I had retired...I was in one world, but the next world had found me, so I had to respond to it. That meant gathering my wits and going forward with a new record.\\" \\"I've written poetry, prose, essays and articles and gone through the motions of being Roy, but I didn’t have the will to make another album until recently...\\" said Harper. \\"...I was inspired to write again around 2009, by many of the younger generation finding me and asking, who are you?\\". Recording Of the seven tracks, four were recorded with Jonathan Wilson at his Fivestar Studios in Echo Park. \\"Heaven Is Here\\", \\"The Exile\\", and \\"January Man\\" were recorded in County Cork. Pete Townshend plays lead guitar on \\"Cloud Cuckooland\\". Album promotion On 18 July 2013 Mojo magazine's website featured the track \\"Time is Temporary\\" as their Track of the Day. \\"\\"Time is Temporary\\" is the sound of a man who is capable of contemplating his mortality as well as musing on coincidence, convergence and circumstance\\" said Harper. The track is \\"based on a thought... that maybe I will pass you in the street, or in a train, or a restaurant, and we'll look at each other and have the same sort of feelings, but never take it any further, never take the next step that both of us seemed to want to, so we'll never know what might have been\\". In the run up to the album's release, Harper was interviewed by Laura Rawlings on her BBC Radio Bristol show on 15 August 2013. The interview closed with the track \\"Desert Island\\", from Harper's 1988 release Descendants of Smith, being played. On the album's release date, 23 September 2013, Harper played an in- store performance at Rough Trade East, London. A limited number of tickets were available to those who purchased the album in store that day, and the event was also streamed live to 1000 viewers who had pre-ordered the album and been given a pass. Critical reception The album received favourable reviews from many critics and journalists alike. Molloy Woodcraft, writing for The Observer, called the album \\"an absolute corker\\" and \\"a great record\\". Reviewing for the Music website, Drowned in Sound, Matthew Slaughter stated \\"...it’s a record of reflection, of experimentation, sometimes of egotism, often of near-mystical sadness\\".Slaughter, Matthew (19 September 2013). Man and Myth. Drowned in Sound. Retrieved on 22 November 2013. \\"Restless, melodic and endlessly absorbing, Man & Myth is the sound of an artist at the peak of his power\\" was the conclusion by Martin Townsend in his review for the Daily Express. Steve Creedy reviewing for The Australian stated the album \\"compares well with illustrious predecessors such as Stormcock and HQ\\" and that it was \\"a welcome addition to a remarkable career\\". The Financial Times reviewer, Ludovic Hunter-Tilney awarded the album four out of five stars and said \\"acoustic guitar melodies meander along gracefully, building into moments of great agitation; raw emotional honesty coexists with mythmaking lyrics romanticising Harper as the eternal outsider\\". Writing for Goldmine, Dave Thompson proclaimed Man and Myth to be \\"a genuine triumph, a magnificent achievement...this isn’t a 'return to form'.

The Catholic Church considers prostitution and homosexual acts to be gravely sinful offenses and the Vatican severed its connections with both men, one of whom had been arrested. Incident Italian engineering executive Angelo Balducci, a Papal Gentleman since 1995, who had served as senior adviser to the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, responsible for the management of the Roman Catholic church's missionary activities around the globe, was reportedly involved with pimping a Nigerian Cappella Giulia member, Ghinedu Ehiem, for the services of male prostitutes, as part of a local prostitution ring. Ehiem had met Balducci more than 10 years prior to the scandal and had become acquainted with him through an Italian friend. A wiretap by police allegedly caught Balducci negotiating with Ehiem, a then 29-year-old Vatican chorister, giving physical descriptions of men he wanted brought to him. One of the men was described as \\"two metres tall … 97 kilos … aged 33, completely active.\\" In various taped conservations, Ehiem had also been recorded saying \\"I have a situation from Naples\\", \\"I have a situation from Cuba\\", \\"a German who just arrived from Germany\\", \\"two black guys\\", \\"the soccer player\\" and \\"the dancer for the RAI\\". Investigation and response In March 2010, this escalated into a national scandal in Italy when wiretaps and police documents were published in the Italian newspaper La Repubblica which indicated that Ehiem had been in regular contact with Balducci, and that the main subject of their conversation was \\"gay sex\\". Ehiem reportedly said about Balducci, \\"He asked me if I could procure other men for him. He told me he was married and that I had to do it in great secrecy.\\" A report by the Italian Police investigating the affair for prosecutors in Florence concluded about Balducci's life: \\"In order to organise casual encounters of a sexual nature, he availed himself of the intercession of two individuals who, it is maintained, may form part of an organised network, especially active in [Rome], of exploiters or at least facilitators of male prostitution.\\" Balducci was one of four men arrested for alleged involvement in the prostitution racket and hired lawyer Franco Coppi. Balducci had been earlier arrested on 10 February 2010, suspected of \\"involvement in widespread corruption\\", \\"an organised network ... to abet male prostitution\\". Balducci's lawyer Coppi stated that it was a \\"shameful\\" act for newspapers to publish conversations which were unrelated to the investigation and stated that he and Balducci had \\"laughed\\" when they heard of the allegations. Ehiem was dismissed from the choir after having been a member for 19 years. He accused the magistrates of \\"ruining his life\\". CBS News consultant Father Thomas Williams stated that the Vatican had severed its ties with both men and described the situation as \\"really a sordid affair\\". He said > You do the best you can to screen these people. But there are 150 of these > men that serve as ushers as Gentlemen to His Holiness. And it's hard to know > exactly what they're doing in their private lives. They don't live in > Vatican City, they have their jobs, their families and they have other > things going on, as well.

In this portrait fantasy, Tretchikoff has identified the prima ballerina Alicia Markova in her most famous role - The Dying Swan - from which, as did Anna Pavlova, she has become inseparable in the minds of all lovers of the ballet; it is for this reason that the artist painted the swan and Markova as one and the same being.Timmins, Howard B, Tretchikoff, American Edition 1953, plate.26 Historical background Extract from Tretchikoff's Autobiography Pigeon's Luck:Tretchikoff, V & Hocking, A Pigeon's Luck, 1973, p.188-191 The Schlesinger organisation was sponsoring a tour of South Africa by the Royal Ballet from London, with its principals Alicia Markova and her partner, Anton Dolin. When I returned to Cape Town NatalieNatalie Tretchikoff, the artist's wife and I went to see them dance, and I was so intrigued that I went to see them rehearse. I was sitting in the stalls with a friend nicknamed Silver Fox from his pure white shock of hair. Markova was dancing the Dying Swan in 'Swan Lake' and I found the experience moved me deeply. 'I want to paint her,' I told Silver Fox. 'Why don't you ask her manager? He's sitting next to us.' When the rehearsal was over Silver Fox introduced me to Markova's manager, and told him of my idea. He did not look enthusiastic. 'Not a chance,' he said. 'There's no time.' 'If anyone can paint Alicia this is your man,' he said earnestly. 'He'll make it something special.' The manager hardly stirred. 'Got anything to show me?' he asked, obviously bored stiff by the whole idea. 'Not here,' I said. 'But my studio's just around the corner from your hotel. If you have a few minutes to spare I'll come and fetch you.' 'Okay. I'll give you five minutes tomorrow morning. Pick me up at nine sharp.' At the studio the next morning he looked through my paintings, and it amused me to find that this hard-headed American so long immersed in the cut-and- thrust of show business was not indifferent to them. In fact, he stayed all morning. 'All right,' he said at last. 'You've convinced me. Now let's see what Alicia has to say.' She liked the paintings too. But when I told her I wanted to paint her as she appeared in 'Swan Lake', she sadly shook her head. 'No time at all,' she said. 'When could we do it? In the mornings I rehearse and in the evenings we perform.' 'I'd be prepared to fall in with your arrangements,' I said. 'Fit in an hour here, an hour there. I'll follow you round the country if need be.' She laughed. 'All right,' she said. 'You're on. I'll give you all my free time - but there's not all that much of it, I'd better warn you now.' I began work as soon as possible. First I had to paint the background, and with it the outline of the Dying Swan itself to balance the ballerina. By the time it was ready the ballet had moved on to Johannesburg and I had to pack my bags and follow them. I checked in at the Carlton.Carlton Hotel, Johannesburg, South Africa There was a problem in that in Johannesburg I had no studio. But that was soon overcome. When the hotel manager heard of the difficulty he gave me the best suite in the hotel at no extra charge, the lightest and airiest in the building and an ideal working space. My idea in the Dying Swan was to paint Alicia intertwined with the bird she portrayed, the two inseparable in the moment of death, the end of the dance. Alicia was infinitely patient in the long hours of posing and as generous with her free time as she had promised. Strange as it may seem, Alicia's co-operation had a great influence on the painting. With the ballerina so unselfish I was doing my damnedest to produce my best. When it was time for the company to move on to Pretoria, I went with them. One evening in Pretoria I went down to see Alicia dance yet again, watching from the wings with no less enthusiasm than I had the first time, when I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was Anton Dolin, Alicia's partner. 'Hello there,' he whispered. 'Back to see the Dance of the Dying Duck?' He startled me. 'What do you mean?' 'Don't you know? In the business that's the nickname we have for the Dying Swan. 'I've got news for you,' I said. 'You know the swan in the painting? I couldn't get the real thing, so I painted it from a dead duck.'

Hogan. Plot At a warehouse in Los Angeles, trucks are loaded with stacks of tires to be delivered to a San Francisco warehouse. On a country road under cover of darkness, the tires are transferred to Joe Wembley (Frank M. Thomas), an underworld figure and operator of a nightclub at the beach. With the $50,000 earned from the transaction, Evelyn Harris (Doris Lloyd), who inherited the tire business from her late husband, plans to marry Eddie Moore (Jerome Cowan), a singer at Wembley's café. The two lovebirds head for New York City, but Moore insists on stopping at an unoccupied cottage he notices from the road. In San Francisco private detective Jess Arno (William Gargan) succeeds in clearing actress Dolly Adair (Phyllis Brooks) of a murder charge and becomes a media sensation. After the trial is over, Jess rushes to phone his sweetheart, June Terry (Margaret Lindsay), a real estate agent at the shore. June, jealous of Dolly, is upset when Jess informs her that he plans to shield Dolly from the reporters by hiding her at his beach cottage. Randy Brooke (Dick Purcell), a reporter and a rival for June's affections, convinces her to play a practical joke. They take a wax model to Jess's cottage and stick a knife in the figure's throat. Jess and Dolly arrive at the cottage and are horrified to find blood stains and a body of a woman in the cellar. Hurrying to Wembley's café nearby, they telephone Capt. Baker (Thomas E. Jackson) at police headquarters. When the officers arrive, accompanied by Randy and June, the body is missing and the dummy lies in its place. Believing that it is all a publicity hoax, the police ridicule Jess as a \\"front page detective.\\" After the police leave, June admits her involvement in placing the dummy and offers to help Jess discover the identity of the murdered woman. A dress label found on the body leads them to an exclusive shop in Los Angeles, where they discover that the dress was sold to Evelyn. After an argument, Jess and June go their separate ways to solve the mystery. Upon learning that Evelyn left town to marry Moore, their investigation leads to Wembley's café. June begins to question Moore about Evelyn, whereupon he flees the café with the $50,000. His escape is aided by the sound of air raid sirens and a blackout at the beach. By pretending to be an air raid warden, Jess corners Moore at his apartment. After Moore denies killing Evelyn and accuses Wembley of engineering the murder and hijacking the tires, Jess phones Capt. Baker, but before he can relay the information, Moore knocks him unconscious and locks him in a closet. Moore is then confronted by Wembley and his henchman, Mario (Edward Norris), who have followed him. When the police arrive, they find Moore's body, beaten to death, and accuse Jess of the crime. After recovering from a blow to his head, Jess eludes the police and goes to the café, where he confronts Wembley and Mario with evidence of murder. In the ensuing fight, Mario and Wembley chase Jess into a banquet room where the hijacked tires are stored. The police then arrive and, seizing the tires as evidence, arrest Wembley and Mario. With the murder solved, Jess and June leave for their wedding and honeymoon. Cast *William Gargan ... Jess Arno *Margaret Lindsay ... June Terry *Phyllis Brooks ... Dolly Adair *Dick Purcell ...

This protease is a major contributor to the bacterium's virulence, or ability to cause disease, by cleaving host factors of the innate immune system as well as regulating S. aureus secreted toxins and cell wall proteins. To catalyze its enzymatic activities, aureolysin requires zinc and calcium which it obtains from the extracellular environment within the host.  Genetics  Aureolysin is expressed from the gene aur, which is located on a monocistronic operon. The gene exists in two allelic forms but the sequence is highly conserved with 89% homology between the two. The gene contains a coding sequence of 1,527 nucleotides that translates into a pre-pro-form of the enzyme that is 509 amino acids long. Of the 509 amino acids, only 301 denote the mature form of aureolysin. After translation, the pre-portion of the enzyme is a 27 amino acid N-terminal signal peptide that acts as a guide to the secretion system located within the cell wall. Here, the signal peptide is cleaved upon secretion of aureolysin. Aureolysin is largely co-expressed with other major proteases of S. aureus including the two cystine proteases, Staphopain A (ScpA) and B (SspB), and a serine protease V8 (SspA). The transcriptional regulation of aur is controlled by \\"housekeeping\\" sigma factor σA, and is up-regulated by accessory gene regulator agr. Expression levels of aureolysin are at their highest during the post-exponential phase however, up- regulation of aureolysin during phagocytosis has also been observed. Transcription is repressed by staphylococcal accessory regulator sarA and by alternative sigma factor σB (a stress response modulator of Gram-positive bacteria). The aur gene has a high prevalence in the genome of both commensal- and pathogenic-type S. aureus strains.  Activation  The staphylococcal proteolytic cascade. Once aureolysin, V8, and SspB are secreted into the extracellular environment, the pro-peptides, as indicated by the stripped smaller circles, need to be cleaved to generate enzyme activity. Aureolysin undergoes autocatalysis to remove the pro-peptide then cleaves V8, generating mature protease. V8 then activates SspB and the cascade is complete. Aureolysin, along with V8, SspB, and ScpA, are all secreted a zymogens. This means that they are secreted in an inactive conformation until the propeptide is removed in some manner. Aureolysin, V8, and SspB constitute what is known as the staphylococcal proteolytic cascade. All three of these proteases are secreted into the environment with the propeptide inhibiting their activation. Aureolysin undergoes autocatalysis and the propeptide is degraded generating the mature form of the enzyme. Mature aureolysin will then cleave the propeptide from V8, causing this protease to become active. Finally V8 will cleave SspB propeptide and the cascade is now complete. ScpA becomes mature by autocatalytic degradation of the propeptide, similar to that of aureolysin. The active residues of aureolysin are of critical importance to its enzymatic function. The active residue is a glutamate amino acid located at the 145th position of the protein.  Immune Evasion  Aureolysin cleaves various immune components and host proteins. It is important for hiding the bacterium from the immune system and is responsible for mediating the transition of a biofilm forming phenotype to a mobile and invasive one. There are many different targets of aureolysin and the effect on each is critical for the bacterium's virulence. One major way aureolysin contributes to infection, is by inactivating certain targets within the complement system. Of all the proteases, aureolysin is the most effective against the complement cascade. In all three pathways of complement activation, there is a target for the protease to manipulate. In the classical pathway, aureolysin not only decreases deposition of C1q on the S. aureus bacterial surface, it induces C1q to bind surfaces and deposit on commensal bacteria surfaces that typically do not activate the innate immune system. Aureolysin has also been noted to produce high levels of C5a in human plasma, which leads to overstimulation of neutrophils that ultimately results in neutrophil death. C3 is another major target of aureolysin. The active site has a high affinity for C3 and will cleave it into C3a and C3b however, the protein is cleaved two amino acid residues away from the native site that is recognized by the host C3 convertase. The aureolysin derived C3a and C3b are further degraded by host complement inhibitor factor H and I. In the lectin pathway, aureolysin inhibits MBL and ficolin binding which, in turn, reduce C3b deposition. Further immune evasion outside of the complement system occurs in various ways. Aureolysin cleaves and inactivates protease inhibitor α1-antichymotrypsin and partially inactivates α1-antitrypsin. The cleavage of α1-antitrypsin generates a fragment chemotactic to neutrophils, and the cleavage of both protease inhibitors causes deregulation of neutrophil-derived proteolytic activity. Aureolysin has also been shown to cleave the antimicrobial peptide LL-37, rendering it inactive and unable to puncture the bacterial cell wall. Production of immunoglobulin by lymphocytes is inhibited by aureolysin as well. It contributes to both coagulation triggered by coagulase, and to fibrinolysis mediated by staphylokinase. Proteolytic conversion of pro-thrombin into thrombin by aureolysin works synergistically with coagulase and contributes to the staphylocoagulation of human plasma. By inducing staphylocoagulation, the bacterium is hidden within the clot from phagocytic cells. Contradictory to staphylocoagulation, aureolysin is responsible for the activation of urokinase, and inactivation of α2-antiplasmin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. This promotes the dissemination of the bacterium to allow for further invasion of the host.  Biological significance  When S. aureus is establishing an infection within a host, it needs to continuously switch from a static, or biofilm forming phenotype, to an invasive, or mobile phenotype. The proteases help mediate this process. Aureolysin appears to down-regulate the formation of biofilms and allow for the mobility of the bacterium. One way it contributes to this change is by mediating coagulation as well as the activation of urokinase. However, it also mediates S. aureus cell wall and secreted proteins to promote this change. For example, clumping factor B is a surface protein that is responsible for the binding of fibrinogen around the bacterium to hide it within a clot. Aureolysin is responsible for the cleavage of clumping factor B, which causes the loss of S. aureus binding to fibrinogen. By this mechanism, it may act as a self-regulatory mechanism for dissemination and spreading in combination with activation of fibrinolysis, while the protease simultaneously provides protection against complement activation. It has been demonstrated that aureolysin has impact for bacterial survival in human whole blood. Aureolysin is also up-regulated upon phagocytosis and promotes intracellular survival. S. aureus prefers to establish a chronic, or long lasting infection within a host. While promoting dissemination and counteracting immune mechanisms, aureolysin also regulates secreted virulence factors to control the pathogenicity of the bacterium. By inactivation of PSMs and α-toxins, aureolysin may suppress the pathogenic impact of the bacteria allowing for a chronic infection to be established.

Gravitation theory is formulated as classical field theory on natural bundles over a world manifold.  Topology  A world manifold is a four-dimensional orientable real smooth manifold. It is assumed to be a Hausdorff and second countable topological space. Consequently, it is a locally compact space which is a union of a countable number of compact subsets, a separable space, a paracompact and completely regular space. Being paracompact, a world manifold admits a partition of unity by smooth functions. Paracompactness is an essential characteristic of a world manifold. It is necessary and sufficient in order that a world manifold admits a Riemannian metric and necessary for the existence of a pseudo-Riemannian metric. A world manifold is assumed to be connected and, consequently, it is arcwise connected.  Riemannian structure  The tangent bundle TX of a world manifold X and the associated principal frame bundle FX of linear tangent frames in TX possess a general linear group structure group GL^+(4,\\\\mathbb R) . A world manifold X is said to be parallelizable if the tangent bundle TX and, accordingly, the frame bundle FX are trivial, i.e., there exists a global section (a frame field) of FX. It is essential that the tangent and associated bundles over a world manifold admit a bundle atlas of finite number of trivialization charts. Tangent and frame bundles over a world manifold are natural bundles characterized by general covariant transformations. These transformations are gauge symmetries of gravitation theory on a world manifold. By virtue of the well-known theorem on structure group reduction, a structure group GL^+(4,\\\\mathbb R) of a frame bundle FX over a world manifold X is always reducible to its maximal compact subgroup SO(4) . The corresponding global section of the quotient bundle FX/SO(4) is a Riemannian metric g^R on X. Thus, a world manifold always admits a Riemannian metric which makes X a metric topological space.  Lorentzian structure  In accordance with the geometric Equivalence Principle, a world manifold possesses a Lorentzian structure, i.e., a structure group of a frame bundle FX must be reduced to a Lorentz group SO(1,3) . The corresponding global section of the quotient bundle FX/SO(1,3) is a pseudo-Riemannian metric g of signature (+,---) on X. It is treated as a gravitational field in General Relativity and as a classical Higgs field in gauge gravitation theory. A Lorentzian structure need not exist. Therefore, a world manifold is assumed to satisfy a certain topological condition. It is either a noncompact topological space or a compact space with a zero Euler characteristic. Usually, one also requires that a world manifold admits a spinor structure in order to describe Dirac fermion fields in gravitation theory. There is the additional topological obstruction to the existence of this structure. In particular, a noncompact world manifold must be parallelizable.  Space-time structure  If a structure group of a frame bundle FX is reducible to a Lorentz group, the latter is always reducible to its maximal compact subgroup SO(3) . Thus, there is the commutative diagram : GL(4,\\\\mathbb R) \\\\to SO(4) : \\\\downarrow \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\quad \\\\downarrow : SO(1,3) \\\\to SO(3) of the reduction of structure groups of a frame bundle FX in gravitation theory. This reduction diagram results in the following. (i) In gravitation theory on a world manifold X, one can always choose an atlas of a frame bundle FX (characterized by local frame fields \\\\\\\\{h^\\\\lambda\\\\\\\\}) with SO(3) -valued transition functions. These transition functions preserve a time-like component h_0=h^\\\\mu_0 \\\\partial_\\\\mu of local frame fields which, therefore, is globally defined. It is a nowhere vanishing vector field on X. Accordingly, the dual time-like covector field h^0=h^0_\\\\lambda dx^\\\\lambda also is globally defined, and it yields a spatial distribution \\\\mathfrak F\\\\subset TX on X such that h^0\\\\rfloor \\\\mathfrak F=0. Then the tangent bundle TX of a world manifold X admits a space-time decomposition TX=\\\\mathfrak F\\\\oplus T^0X, where T^0X is a one-dimensional fibre bundle spanned by a time-like vector field h_0. This decomposition, is called the g-compatible space-time structure. It makes a world manifold the space-time. (ii) Given the above- mentioned diagram of reduction of structure groups, let g and g^R be the corresponding pseudo-Riemannian and Riemannian metrics on X. They form a triple (g,g^R,h^0) obeying the relation : g=2h^0\\\\otimes h^0 -g^R. Conversely, let a world manifold X admit a nowhere vanishing one-form \\\\sigma (or, equivalently, a nowhere vanishing vector field). Then any Riemannian metric g^R on X yields the pseudo-Riemannian metric : g=\\\\frac{2}{g^R(\\\\sigma,\\\\sigma)}\\\\sigma\\\\otimes \\\\sigma -g^R. It follows that a world manifold X admits a pseudo-Riemannian metric if and only if there exists a nowhere vanishing vector (or covector) field on X. Let us note that a g-compatible Riemannian metric g^R in a triple (g,g^R,h^0) defines a g-compatible distance function on a world manifold X. Such a function brings X into a metric space whose locally Euclidean topology is equivalent to a manifold topology on X. Given a gravitational field g, the g-compatible Riemannian metrics and the corresponding distance functions are different for different spatial distributions \\\\mathfrak F and \\\\mathfrak F'. It follows that physical observers associated with these different spatial distributions perceive a world manifold X as different Riemannian spaces. The well-known relativistic changes of sizes of moving bodies exemplify this phenomenon. However, one attempts to derive a world topology directly from a space-time structure (a path topology, an Alexandrov topology). If a space-time satisfies the strong causality condition, such topologies coincide with a familiar manifold topology of a world manifold. In a general case, they however are rather extraordinary.  Causality conditions  A space-time structure is called integrable if a spatial distribution \\\\mathfrak F is involutive. In this case, its integral manifolds constitute a spatial foliation of a world manifold whose leaves are spatial three-dimensional subspaces. A spatial foliation is called causal if no curve transversal to its leaves intersects each leave more than once. This condition is equivalent to the stable causality of Stephen Hawking. A space-time foliation is causal if and only if it is a foliation of level surfaces of some smooth real function on X whose differential nowhere vanishes. Such a foliation is a fibred manifold X\\\\to \\\\mathbb R. However, this is not the case of a compact world manifold which can not be a fibred manifold over \\\\mathbb R. The stable causality does not provide the simplest causal structure. If a fibred manifold X\\\\to\\\\mathbb R is a fibre bundle, it is trivial, i.e., a world manifold X is a globally hyperbolic manifold X=\\\\mathbb R \\\\times M. Since any oriented three-dimensional manifold is parallelizable, a globally hyperbolic world manifold is parallelizable.

Ättestupa () is a name given to a number of precipices in Sweden, Norway and Iceland. The name supposedly denotes sites where ritual senicide took place during Nordic prehistoric times, whereby elderly people threw themselves, or were thrown, to their deaths. According to legend, this was done when old people were unable to support themselves or assist in a household. History of the term Senicide and suicide precipices are mentioned in several sources from antiquity, e.g. the Ligurians in Paradoxographus Vaticanus and Procopius in his description of the Heruli from the 6th century CE.Procopius, History of the Wars, Book VI, chapter XIV. Wikisource Solinus wrote about the happy hyperboreans at the North Pole where it is daylight for half a year between the vernal equinox to the autumnal equinox, and described the climate as being so healthy that the people there didn't die but threw themselves from a precipice into the sea. The term ättestupa came into use in Sweden in the seventeenth century, inspired by the Old Icelandic saga Gautreks saga, which is partly set in the Swedish region of Götaland. The saga contains a comical episode known as Dalafíflaþáttr ('the story of the fools from the valleys') in which one particular family is so miserly that they prefer to kill themselves than see their wealth spent on hospitality. In this tale, the family members kill themselves by jumping off a cliff which the saga calls the Ættarstapi or Ætternisstapi (\\"dynasty precipice\\"), a word which occurs in no Old Norse texts other than this saga. Gautreks saga became known in Sweden in 1664, when an edition and Swedish translation was published by Olaus Verelius.Gothrici & Rolfi Westrogothiae Regum Historia, Lingua Antiqua Gothica Conscripta, ed. and trans. by Olaus Verelius (Uppsala, 1664). This seems to have inspired Swedish antiquarians from the seventeenth century through into the nineteenth to label various cliffs with the name ättestupa. The Swedish linguist Adolf Noreen started questioning the myth at the end of the nineteenth century, and it is now generally accepted among researchers that the practice of suicide precipices never existed.Jonathan York Heng Hui, 'The Matter of Gautland' (unpublished doctoral thesis, University of Cambridge, 2018), pp. 119-29; https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.3036. Place-names which Gautreks saga inspired, however, continue to exist in the Swedish landscape. The term ättestupa has been used often in modern times, in political contexts, to underline how bad an insufficiently funded social security program can be, especially for retirees. In the 1960s, the Swedish comedy radio program Mosebacke Monarki satirically introduced ättestupa, abbreviated ÄTP, as an alternative to ATP, a state-provided pension. The 2016 comedy series Norsemen depicts a group of elderly men reluctant to perform the ritual. The 2019 horror film Midsommar by Ari Aster uses the term to describe a fictional tradition in which elderly cult members throw themselves off a high cliff in ritual suicide at the age of 72.

Two years later in 1937 he achieve simultaneously a master's degree in history and an advanced certificate in education, both cum laude.  Academic career  After receiving a bursary from the University for postgraduate studies, he decided to travel to Amsterdam in 1938 and enrol at the University of Amsterdam. He was to receive his PhD degree on 10 May 1940, but two weeks before took the last boat out of The Netherlands back to South Africa as WWII swept over Europe and the German invasion of the Netherlands seemed imminent. Back in South Africa he took up teaching in a school in the town of Vereeniging from 1940 to 1941. Fortunately also in this time his completed PhD dissertation (from the time in Amsterdam) was accepted at the University of Pretoria and awarded the degree in April 1941. From here he was appointed as a lecturer in the department of History at the University of Pretoria in January 1942, and in 1946 as Senior Lector and in 1947 as Professor and head of the department.

In 1931 he settled down in Norway in Lapland, where nowadays Børgefjell National Park is located. During World War II he participated in the Norwegian resistance movement. In 1948 he returned to Czechoslovakia. He worked at a biological research department, where he wrote several articles about hunting and forestry. From 1951 he worked at Research Institute of Forestry in Zbraslav, focusing on soil zoology. From 1955 he worked for the Czechoslovak Academy of Agricultural Sciences as an extert abstractor.

By road it is located south of Faxe, and southwest of Copenhagen. Of note is Roholte Church, the parish church, which was built in 1441, and the Morten Roholte sports club. History The area around Roholte has been inhabited since the Stone Age. There is also evidence of a Viking community there. The origin of the village can be ascribed to the establishment of a large trading post just south of Roholte's present location. As the height of the land in the area increased, the sea retreated while trade gave way to agriculture and forestry.Flemming Petersen, \\"Roholte og Vindbyholt\\", Kalklandet.dk. Retrieved 9 May 2013. \\"The Society for Improvement of Cattle Breeding in Roholte Parish\\" was founded in 1884; the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural College noted it to be the first \\"Bull Club\\" or breeding society in Denmark. The society was formed by 36 farmers who purchased a superior quality bull to breed with the members' cows.  Notable people  * Louise Bjørnsen (1824 in Roholte - 1899) an early Danish female novelist and short story writer. * Karl Gjellerup (1857–1919) a Danish poet, awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1917, was born at Roholte's rectory \\"The Nobel Prize in Literature 1917: Karl Gjellerup, Henrik Pontoppidan\\", Nobelprize.org. Retrieved 9 May 2013. * Godtfred Olsen (1883 in Roholte – 1954) a Danish road racing cyclist who competed in the 1912 Summer Olympics * Hans Olsen (1885 in Roholte – 1969) a Danish cyclist, competed in two events at the 1912 Summer Olympics Cityscape The sites of the houses in the village have varied over the years. Initially they were situated close together but after many were destroyed by fire, the trend was to separate them out over the nearby countryside. However, after a number of burglaries, they again became more closely grouped around the centre of the village as they stand today. Roholte has therefore become a village of high historical interest with its carefully placed houses and farmsteads. Notable buildings ;Roholte Church The church was built in 1441 in a decorative Late Gothic style with ribbed gables and horizontal belts of limestone and brick along the walls of the nave and around the tower. Its major attraction is the font which was originally intended for Roskilde Cathedral. Its 15 panels depict angels and the apostles in shallow reliefs.Chr. Axel Jensen and Victor Hermansen, \\"Præsto Amt, Danmarks Kirker\\", Nationalmuseet, Copenhagen, 1933, pages 549–558. ;Old school In 1908, a school building large enough to accommodate the increasing number of children in the village and its surroundings was completed. It was built in a style similar to that of the adjacent church. It was taken out of commission in the early 1980s as there were not enough pupils to warrant its existence. Recently, however, the cultural authorities have been discussing a proposal to give the school the status of a heritage-listed building in view of its local history and its architecture, probably the work of Jens Ingwersen, especially as it is built in brick and limestone reflecting the features of the church which stands opposite.\\"Referat 12/12-2012: Det Sæarlige Bygningssyn\\", Kultur Styrelsen.

Early history American Women's Hospitals personnel, including Esther Pohl Lovejoy, in 1918 In 1917 the Medical Women's National Association (which was later renamed AMWA) established a war service committee in order to create a census of the medical women in the country and to plan how to apply their resources to the war effort. World War I had already entered into its third year, women at that time were not accepted by military branches of the government, and the government had no plan to organize them for war service. The war service committee, adopting the name American Women's Hospitals, decided that they wanted to provide individual medical service abroad and also establish military hospitals overseas. In its first year, AWH partnered with the Red Cross and civilian medical organizations to send abroad 62 AWH volunteer doctors as well as 30 technicians and lay workers to France, Serbia, Palestine and Greece. AWH also established its first hospital in Neufmoutiers-en-Brie, France, in July 1918. This hospital, financed entirely by AWH, had 25 beds and a staff of 15 women. In the US, AWH arranged for hospitals for convalescent soldiers, for care for soldiers' dependents, and for laboratory training courses in order to address the critical shortage at that time of skilled lab workers. Although the armistice was signed a year later, the ensuing local wars, revolutions, earthquakes, famine and millions of destitute refugees meant that medical assistance remained urgently needed around the world. AWH expanded its service at home and multiple countries abroad in order to address the thousands who looked for help. See also *Rosalie Slaughter Morton *Mary M.

It is approximately in length. Salt Creek begins in southern Lancaster county and flows north to connect to the Platte River at Mahoney State Park in Ashland.  Ecology  An 1861 account of Salt Creek in the vicinity of Lincoln by W.W. Cox noted its salinity, the smell of which he described as akin to \\"the morning breezes at the ocean beach.\\" Cox also reported that \\"elk and antelope were plentiful,\\" and that the river was \\"wonderfully supplied with fish.\\" Salt Creek, as with all other saline wetlands in southeast Nebraska, is imparted with its salinity due to the porous nature of the Dakota sandstone through which it flows. The salt in the region is ultimately sourced from Cretaceous-era shale which was deposited when Nebraska was part of a vast inland ocean known as the Western Interior Seaway. The water quality and biodiversity of Salt Creek are greatly impacted by its proximity to the city of Lincoln. Salt Creek was channelized in an effort to reduce flooding in the city, which causes the stream to discharge water at a much faster rate. The change of flow combined with the dumping of treated sewage and urban runoff create a stream that is essentially devoid of life after it leaves the city of Lincoln. Among species found along Salt Creek are the critically endangered Salt Creek tiger beetle, of which fewer than 200 individuals existed in 2009. Salt Creek Tiger Beetle  Tributaries of Salt Creek  Salt Creek has fifteen tributaries of its own: Oak Creek, Stevens Creek, Middle Creek, Antelope Creek, Elk Creek, Beal Slough, Haines Branch, Cardwell Branch, Lynn Creek, Deadman's Run, Little Salt Creek, Rock Creek, Camp Creek, Wahoo Creek, and Dee Creek.

The plant is Taiwan's third nuclear power plant and second-largest in generation capacity. The expected lifespan of this plant is 60 years. Generation Each unit at Maanshan is a three-loop Westinghouse PWR with three Westinghouse type F steam generators. Each steam generator has 5626 U-bend tubes made of thermally treated Inconel 600 alloy. The power plant can generate 15 TWh of electricity per year. Events 1985 On ' a turbine blade failure at Maanshan Unit 1 led to a fire and reactor trip. When the blades failed, the resulting turbine imbalance allowed hydrogen and seal oil to escape from the generator. It took approximately 2 hours for the fire to be extinguished, but no systems critical to safe operation and shutdown were affected. The subsequent repairs were so extensive that Unit 1 did not come back on-line for 11 months. The natural frequency of torsional vibration was 120 Hz, approximately twice that of the electrical frequency, so the resulting resonant vibration led to blade failure. 1988 On ', one control rod assembly was found to be not fully inserted following a reactor trip at Unit 1. Subsequent rod drop tests showed the rod assembly stuck at or above the same not-fully-inserted position, leading to removal and examination of the rod assembly. The examination showed several rods were cracked, which were later determined to result from volumetric growth of the hafnium neutron absorber and differential thermal expansion (hafnium compared to the stainless steel rod cladding). Taipower later replaced all hafnium-containing rods with a different alloy to resolve the issue. 2001 Unit 1 suffered a station blackout on ' when grid instability caused a loss of offsite power and both of the emergency diesel generator trains failed to start. Both units had tripped off-line the prior day due to instability in the 345 kV offsite power transmission line, caused by salt-bearing seasonal sea smog. The 4.16 kV essential bus was transferred to the 161 kV offsite power line, but the 161 kV line was lost soon afterwards. The \\"A\\" train emergency diesel generator started but was unable to supply power due to a bus grounding fault, and the \\"B\\" train diesel generator lost power to its exciter, resulting in a loss of power to both 4.16 kV essential busses lost power. Service to these busses was not restored for over two hours, when a swing diesel generator (shared between Units 1 and 2) was brought to service. At the time, this was considered the most notable event in the history of nuclear generation in Taiwan. Neither unit was allowed to restart until the root causes were identified and corrective actions applied, as the same conditions could have occurred at Unit 2. 2005 During the normal full operation of the power plant on ', Unit 2 reactor scram was initiated followed by a main turbine trip. A universal logic card in the plant's solid-state protection system malfunctioned, erroneously reporting a low-low water level condition in the steam generators. This then caused the actuation of the auxiliary feed water system and reactor protection system. Unit 1 was operating at full power on ' when the reactor tripped on low-low water level in steam generator C. Prior to the trip, the high water level alarm in steam generator C was triggered when the water level kept rising and the main feedwater control valve did not respond to manual intervention. When control of the valve was switched to a backup system, the valve closed immediately, leading to a low-low water level condition in the steam generator before the valve could be re-opened. It was later determined the primary valve positioner had a loose mechanical connection, resulting in erroneous feedback of valve position. While operating at reduced power in anticipation of typhoon Talim, on ', the Unit 2 main transformer differential protective relay tripped because a damaged support insulator caused one phase to flash to ground. The main transformer trip was followed by main turbine trip and then reactor scram. Following the subsequent repair work, on ', as the unit was in a hot standby condition, a water hammer occurred in one of the main steam lines. It was determined that condensed water accumulated while the unit was in warm standby with the drain valve closed. When that steam line started to supply steam to the turbine, the slug of water was pushed downstream, causing a water hammer and subsequent low steam pressure, resulting in another reactor trip. 2006 Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant was affected by the Hengchun earthquake on '. Because of the vigorous vibration, the alarm at Reactor #2 was activated, forcing the operators to carry out SCRAM immediately. However, Reactor #1 was not affected and remained operational. After the emergency shutdown of Reactor #2, engineers checked the facilities at the plant and no problems had been found.台湾核电厂紧急停机 , Phoenix Television website, 2006-12-27 2009 On ' one of the 345 kV startup transformers (which supply station power during refueling outages and reactor startup, and supply backup power to safety-related systems during plant operation) caught fire. Water intrusion into the \\"B\\" phase bushing caused an internal arc after high internal oil pressure caused an access handhole to blow out. Since there was a separate and redundant transformer in place, plant operation was not threatened during the 35 minutes it took to extinguish the fire. 2010 The Unit 3 of the power plant was shut down on to undergo the EOC-19 outage after running in full cycle continuously, safely and stably for 539 days. 2015 One reactor of the plant was shutdown on 27 April 2015 after its auxiliary step-down transformer was caught on fire.http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201504270010.aspx One reactor of the plant was shut down to undergo an overhaul from 9 November 2015 to 7 December 2015 to replace fuel rods and maintain electrical equipment.

The building took its name from the original owner of the building, Norman Anstey, founder of one of the best known department stores in the city (and mayor from 1913 to 1915).Anstey's article in Life Style and Fashion, Jozi Yesterday and Today, Volume 3, 2010 The Norman Anstey and Company department store was housed in the four-storey podium of the building, which features a curved facade to address the street corner. History This is the third Anstey's building. The first was demolished, and the second is still standing, directly across the road on the corner of Kerk and Joubert Streets. Anstey's Building was designed by architectural firm Emley & Williamson and was built in 1935, completed in 1937. It is situated in stand 118/9/20 on the corner of Joubert and Jeppe Streets in Johannesburg. Standing 20 storeys high, the building is one of Johannesburg's landmark high-rise buildings from the Art Deco era. Design The building is designed in a dramatic ziggurat style, recessing the top from the street. The building consists of two stepped wings, set at right angles to each other, with corner flats featuring bay window balconies. The stepped, right angle design necessitated by the 59 degrees bylaw had resulted in the beautiful large terraces for which Anstey's was well known, while the cylindrical glazed windows at the re-entrant level had provided interesting, unusual detail.The Refurbishment of Anstey’s, Johannesburg. The Saving of an important architectural landmark – article in Planning Magazine 144, March 1996.47 Constructed in reinforced concrete, Anstey's Building features Crittal-Hope steel windows and doors. Decorative bronze and chrome grilles were fabricated by Frederick Sage & Co (SA) Ltd. The building was painted with ‘Snowcem’ paint in the early 1950s.Advertisement in S A Architectural Record June 1952 xxxv The Anstey's department store featured large plate glass windows to the ground floor street frontage, and their window displays were renowned. Internally, the building was designed to have a minimal number of structural pillars so as to provide good views through the store. The interior featured high quality parquet flooring, traditional timber doors and timber detailing such as picture rails. Recent history The building faced demolition in 1989 but was saved by the developer's architect who refused to apply for demolition. A Preservation Trust was established, owning the ground floor podium, and the flats above were sold on sectional title. The refurbishment of Anstey's commenced in January 1994 under the direction of the architect Denzil Hersch. The building has a diverse demographic and it has become a popular place for young middle-class people to live in town. The building is also home to a medical centre, a creche and also the Urban Arts Platform, an initiative to encourage city residents to engage in arts of all forms. The building is currently undergoing refurbishment and restoration under the guidance of architect Brian Kent McKechnie. The project includes the renovation of public areas and the ground floor Art Deco lobby. The exterior renovation and restoration will see Anstey's painted grey by 2017. Heritage Status The Anstey's Building is a provincial heritage site and is historically and culturally significant for the following reasons: * Anstey's Building is a good example of Art Deco architecture in Johannesburg * Anstey's Building is one of the older high rise buildings in the city * Anstey's Building is associated with the architectural firm of Emley & Williamson * Anstey's Building is associated with The Norman Anstey and Company department store * It is a landmark building in Johannesburg * It is related to Manners Mansions directly across the road and was designed by the same architect References Category:Buildings and structures in Johannesburg Category:Heritage Buildings in Johannesburg ","title":"Ansteys Building"},{"id":"39334446","text":"Astor Mansions is an Art Deco style building that was designed by architects Obel & Obel in 1931 and completed in 1932.Heritage Assessment – Astor Mansions 10 October 2011.

The phenomenon spread from the United States to other countries, including South Africa, where it is still evident periodically. South Africa was particularly associated with the Satanic panic because of the creation of the Occult Related Crimes Unit in 1992, described as the \\"world's only 'ritual murder' task force\\". According to anthropologist Annika Teppo, this was linked with powerful conservative Christian forces within the then-dominant white community in the last years of apartheid. Christian belief is a prerequisite to serve in the unit. The concern with the alleged presence of Satanism and occult practices has continued into the post-apartheid era. The local context The long-term focus in a South African context has not been on claims of child abuse by Satanic cults and the psychiatric community has not played a significant role, as was the case in other countries. The local phenomenon is characterised by Christian evangelism and the scapegoating of Satanism for crime and societal problems. In his 1997 PhD thesis, psychologist Gavin Ivey attributes the local phenomenon to an increase in Christian fundamentalism coupled with a perceived Satanic threat in the social context of the contemporary occult revival: Ivey states \\"All monotheistic religions are forced to account for the presence of evil in a world where everything is created by God, who in theory should be able to vanquish all forms of evil but seems incapable to do so.\\" He compares the importance of Satan in the only two contemporary major religions with a personified principle of evil in opposition to a single omnipotent deity who is unambiguously good, namely Satan in Christianity, whose identity evolved in the New Testament, and Satan in Islam. He notes the greater significance of Satan in Christianity, as Satan emerged as a less threatening figure in Islam and \\"Because it embraces a fundamental dualism, the Christian spiritual world is seen as a battleground between God and the personification of evil, the Devil.\\" However, members of the relatively small Muslim community in South Africa have also been outspoken about the alleged dangers of Satanism. In her 2012 MA thesis, Danielle Dunbar argues that while influenced by the international Satanism scare, past periods of Satanic panic in South Africa reflected localised periods of political upheaval and social anxiety. While in the past Dunbar and other academics have associated the South African phenomenon with the white population group in particular, some more specifically with Calvinist Afrikaners, the racial divide is disappearing. According to American sociologist Jeffrey Victor, With reference to this quote, academic Nicky Falkof states in a South African context \\"alongside this, the figure of the Satanist provides an object for the displacement of anxiety and the concurrent cohesion of nationalistic sentiment.\\" Apart from religious groups, the media and the government have aggravated the local phenomenon. In 2007 Afrikaans-language newspaper Rapport dismissed journalist Deon Maas, who had advocated religious tolerance in his new column, to protect its commercial interests. According to Nicky Falkof, the English and Afrikaans media have not differed materially in their treatment of the subject: \\"The paranoia, sensationalism or occasional scepticism with which stories were reported generally had more to do with the class or locality of the audience than with their language group.\\" The mainstream media in general persists in sensationalistic reporting regarding Satanism and the occult, especially regarding criminal cases with any suggestion of Satanic involvement. The phenomenon is also evident in South Africa's neighbouring countries. In March 2013, Zimbabwe's national police spokesperson Charity Charamba said media reports about Satanic incidents were unfounded and were causing unnecessary panic. The role of the government The Satanic Bible authored by Anton LaVey and published in the United States in 1969, which contains the main principles of atheistic LaVeyan Satanism, was banned during apartheid in South Africa from 1973 to 1993 for moral reasons. In 1974 South Africa's then Minister of Justice, Jimmy Kruger, reported widespread media coverage of a vast secret network of Satanists in the country was based on books published on the subject and not actual Satanic events. The government also disputed claims of widespread Satanism in a 1978 Dutch Reformed Church report. However, elements within the South African government continue to play a role in propagating the panic despite the constitutional right to religious freedom in post-apartheid South Africa. SAPS Occult Related Crimes Unit The SAPS Occult Related Crimes Unit was established in 1992 during the final years of apartheid by born-again Christian Kobus Jonker, prompted by former Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok. Jonker joined the SAP in 1969 and was previously head of the Port Elizabeth Murder and Robbery Unit. During his policing career he earned the nicknames \\"Donker Jonker\\", \\"The Hound of God\\" and \\"God's Detective\\".The South African Police (SAP) was renamed the South African Police Service (SAPS) in post-apartheid South Africa.The Afrikaans word donker means \\"dark\\". As late as 2006 SAPS defined occult-related crime on the Occult Related page of their website as follows: According to Ivey, the special crime unit was formed \\"to investigate and prosecute Satanic crime\\". Theodore Petrus, Senior Lecturer in Anthropology at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, states the main focus of the unit is Satanism in his 2009 doctoral thesis on crime related to \\"witchcraft\\" in a traditional African context. SAPS has been criticised for neglecting the more serious criminal problems of witch-hunts and medicine murders.The colonial term witchcraft used by Petrus in a traditional African context has strong negative connotations and relates to a belief in harmful magic. Danielle Dunbar refers to the SAPS definition of occult-related crime in her 2012 MA thesis: Ivey notes that everything occult is considered evil from a fundamentalist Christian perspective, and \\"the term Satanism is commonly understood in Christian societies to include a wide range of unconventional or occult beliefs and activities\\". The SAPS website also listed 41 \\"warning signs of possible destructive occult-related discourse\\", including \\"gender confusion\\", playing fantasy games which lack boundaries, an interest in computers, an excessive interest in horror movies and heavy metal music, depression and various stereotypical elements of Gothic fashion. Dale Wallace, Honorary Senior Lecturer in Religion Studies at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, comments on this thinking in her 2006 doctoral thesis: Anthropologist Annika Teppo writes about the unit and a research informant's experience with the unit in an academic publication published in 2009: While SAPS removed the Occult Related page from their website in 2006 after the South African Pagan Rights Alliance requested the removal of discriminatory material, its content is still available via the official SAPS community magazine SERVAMUS. An article titled Breaking the Circle in a SERVAMUS Special Community Edition Drugs and Occult-Related Crime: The Facts, The Answers published in 2000 lists \\"Animosity towards Christianity, the church and Jesus Christ\\" as one of many warning signs of Satanic involvement. This SERVAMUS Special Community Edition was still being sold in May 2013. In an article written by Jonker and published in SERVAMUS, he says there are three Satanic movements (Brotherhood of Ram, Order of Darkness and Sons of Satan) and four types of Satanist (generational Satanists, organised Satanists i.e. LaVeyan Satanists, self-styled Satanists and dabblers) in South Africa. He also authored and co-authored several books on Satanism during his policing career which Dunbar describes as alarmist anti-Satanist literature, including Youth and Satanism Exposed (1990), Satanism Exposed (1992) and Satanism in South Africa (2000). Wallace notes the conflation of Paganism and Satanism in this literature, despite disclaimers to the contrary, and Jonker's failure \\"to distinguish between actual Satanic activity and purely criminal acts\\" in the media: Christianity is a prerequisite to serve in the unit. An article titled Warriors against Evil, first published in the November 1998 issue of SERVAMUS and later published in the 2000 SERVAMUS Special Community Edition, states: The article also lists \\"Deliverance through pastoral guidance\\" within the scope of the unit. Jonker elaborated on this in an interview with Sarah Duguid: \\"The ordinary guy cannot investigate occult crimes. There are things you see and experiences you have as a result of the supernatural. You must be strong in faith to be in the occult unit.\\" He believes Satan is a literal being. In the April 1997 issue of SERVAMUS, he writes \\"I believe the devil exists because I have seen things happen. I have seen a woman being attacked right in my presence by a demonic being\\". Some senior SAPS officers have attempted to have the unit disbanded. An internal SAPS document dated October 1998 expressed concern about the policing of religious activities due to \\"constitutional restraints\\", and Jonker's public addresses on the dangers of Satanism to schoolchildren, community policing forums and church seminars at the state's expense were curtailed. Jonker left the police force after suffering a heart attack in 2000 and subsequently practised as a pastoral counsellor. He has been a director of the Act-Up Support Christian prayer ministry since 2002 and has worked as a consultant for the SAPS Detective Academy in Hammanskraal since his retirement. Other former members of the unit became involved in Christian deliverance ministry and therapy, including former Eastern Cape coordinator of the unit James Lottering (Warfare Ministries in Port Elizabeth) and former Free State coordinator of the unit Johan de Beer (Auksano Trauma Therapy Centre in Bloemfontein). Lottering left SAPS at the end of 1997. De Beer founded Auksano in 1998 while working for SAPS and resigned from SAPS in 2002. FH Havinga, a specialist reservist for the unit, is also a Christian pastoral counsellor and founder of the ASERAC centre for trauma victims of drug, occult, alcohol and sexual abuse in Kempton Park. Attie Lamprecht was appointed head of the unit in 2000. He is also a registered counsellor and as late as 2010 was listed as a member of Act-Up Support's advisory board. Lamprecht has stated that, unlike Satanism in other countries which is predominantly about self-worship, \\"Satanism in South Africa is characteristically against Jesus Christ. Therefore, it is against all that is good.\\" He believes Satanism is \\"a belief system that leads to crime\\", stating \\"It starts with white magic. It goes to gateway religious systems and then to destructive religions.\\" Official statements that the unit had been disbanded were dismissed by Lamprecht, who in 2006 said the unit had been absorbed into other units, and later said it had been removed from the public eye and renamed the SAPS Harmful Religious Practices Unit. Psychologist Gavin Ivey said the unit is \\"a waste of taxpayers' money\\", and psychoanalyst Véronique Faure states: In November 2010 a team of 30 specialists was trained for the unit, and in 2012 two detectives per province received specialised training. Jonker was involved in part of this training. In 2012 three Eastern Cape detectives were trained by Jonker for a new provincial occult task team. As a result of this new investment being publicised in the media, DA MP and Shadow Minister of Police Dianne Kohler Barnard asked the Minister of Police Nathi Mthethwa for the number of occult-related crimes in the last financial year and was told such information is not readily available. Based on an internal SAPS memorandum dated August 2012, it appears the SAPS definition of occult-related crime has been simplified to \\"crime that relates to or emanates primarily from an ostensible belief in the supernatural that formed a driving force in the forming, planning and execution of a crime\\". However, the scope of occult-related \\"crime\\" that may be investigated has been expanded to include: The South African Pagan Rights Alliance objected to the apparent revival of the unit on the grounds of religiously motivated prejudice demonstrated towards minority religions by Christian evangelists involved in the initiative, and the inappropriate allocation of police resources to the investigation of alleged paranormal phenomena which cannot be proven in court. Theodore Petrus expressed some reservations about the establishment of a new SAPS occult task team, cautioning that a clear distinction should be made between Satanism and \\"African witchcraft\\" beliefs and occult-related crimes should be clearly defined in legislation to avoid infringing on religious freedoms. Department of Basic education An example school code of conduct published by the national Department of Education in 2008 explicitly associates Satanism with criminal activity,The Department of Education was divided into the Department of Basic Education and the Department of Higher Education and Training in 2009. and many public schools openly discriminate against practitioners of Satanism and the occult, which are generally undefined. Example of a public school code of conduct. Education about what Satanism actually entails has met with resistance from parents, and schoolchildren have been stigmatized and isolated as a result of accusations of Satanism. On 1 March 2013, Gauteng schoolgirl Keamogetswe Sefularo was allegedly fatally stabbed by another girl from the same school. Although before dying Sefularo allegedly told her mother her attacker said they were attacking her because \\"she hung out with Satanists\\", the incident was labelled \\"Satanic\\" in the media. On 5 March 2013, Gauteng MEC for Education Barbara Creecy announced a \\"gang\\" of ten other learners at the school, including two present at the incident, had been suspended from school pending investigations into the incident. Gauteng Department of Education (GDE) spokesperson Charles Phahlane said their suspension related to alleged involvement in \\"harmful religious practices\\", which Creecy said department officials were told might have led to the incident. South African Council of Churches chairperson Mautji Pataki commented \\"We are gravely concerned that evil spirits are driving innocent children to commit horrendous crimes.\\" According to a GDE media release dated 7 March 2013, a partnership with faith-based organizations (FBOs) comprising representatives of mainstream Abrahamic religions is \\"assisting the department to support schools in addressing issues of learning and teaching, learner discipline, and spiritual disturbances at schools\\". On 18 March 2013, Creecy publicly signed a memorandum of understanding with the FBOs. On the same day, the department published an official statement online about an \\"anti-Satanism strategy\\" for schools developed by the FBOs to address \\"harmful religious practices\\" related to the occult and Satanism. However, the department has no statistics on such incidents, Creecy said the situation is not at crisis level, and the department denied there was an increase in Satanic incidents among schoolchildren in the province. Creecy said a handbook had been compiled to help teachers and parents deal with Satanism which included signs to look out for and guidance in the event that a child is suspected of being involved in the occult. Atheists and Pagans objected on constitutional grounds. Following the receipt of several complaints by the South African Human Rights Commission, the GDE advised there would no longer be a handbook for teachers and parents, only guidelines for department officials. Ironically, in March 2011 Creecy herself was labelled a \\"Satanist\\" in a public slur by Moss Senye, a school principal and SADTU's Gauteng chairperson. Although the mainstream media in general sensationalised the Satanism aspect of these developments, one article by Elaine Swanepoel in The Citizen newspaper presented sceptical views of experts and religious leaders including Anglican bishops Peter Lee and Martin Breytenbach that dysfunctional behaviour and school violence could also be attributed to emotional and psychological problems, instability at home and superstition. Also in March 2013, KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Education Senzo Mchunu said an increase in Satanism and incidents of \\"possession\\" in KwaZulu-Natal schools were a cause for concern for the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education. He invited churches and others to help the department address the issue. In contrast to the GDE partnership with FBOs, following reports of learners being involved in Satanism in Western Cape schools in 2012, Western Cape Education Department spokesperson Paddy Attwell said school psychologists and social workers would be provided to support schools on request. Spokesperson for the national Department of Basic Education Hope Mokgatlhe said the department did not have a firm policy to deal with the issue, and said the GDE strategy could be implemented in other provinces at the discretion of the individual provinces. In October 2013, the Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga told residents of Mpumalanga to pray for their children to be \\"delivered from evil spirits\\" in response to a parent's statement about Satanism in the community. Human Sciences Research Council The Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) statutory body released its report on what it describes as \\"the first comprehensive assessment of human trafficking in South Africa\\" in March 2010. While the HSRC report acknowledges an urgent need for further research on ritual sacrifice, it states as fact \\"the trafficking of people, sometimes children, for ritual sacrifice by satanic cults\\" based solely on interviews with informants described as \\"former members of satanic cults in South Africa\\" which revealed \\"a belief that satanic cults operate within all areas of South Africa\\". A critical review of the HSRC report published by the Institute for Security Studies says it suffers from \\"lack of evidence and methodological integrity\\" and \\"fuels sensationalism\\". Parliament of South Africa In April 2013, the Minister for Women, Children and People with Disabilities Lulu Xingwana publicly cited Satanism as a contributing factor to gender-based violence in South Africa in a submission to Parliament, despite more obvious critical factors and a lack of supporting evidence. Pseudo-Satanism The pattern of suppressing objective information about Satanism while spreading anti-Satanist propaganda has contributed to the social phenomenon of pseudo- Satanism in South Africa. Propagation of the Christian mythical version of Satanism serves to provide a role for rebellious teenagers and mentally confused individuals to act out in a self-fulfilling prophecy. In his 1997 PhD thesis, Gavin Ivey addresses the phenomenon of pseudo-Satanism informed by cultural paranoia: Nicky Falkof notes that paranoid lists of warning signs of Satanism, such as those published by SAPS and contained in the Gauteng Education Department handbook, operate as a self-fulfilling prophecy: American folklorist Bill Ellis associates this phenomenon with legend tripping youths: Alleged Satanic cases According to the US State Department's International Religious Freedom Report 2006 for South Africa, there were no reports of Satanic killings as such cases are investigated and prosecuted as homicide. However, a few high-profile cases have been publicly linked to Satanism. In some of these cases, Satanism, demonic possession and/or occult aspects have been raised as a legal defence or a mitigating factor in sentencing. In 2008 head of the SAPS investigative psychology unit Gerard Labuschagne cautioned against emphasising so-called forces of evil in criminal cases: In 2012 Dale Wallace said many incidents were labelled \\"Satanic\\" to cover up bullying, family problems and psychological problems. Kobus Jonker is often quoted in the media and called as an expert witness regarding such cases. Véronique Faure states: Following sensationalistic media reports about a number of fatal incidents involving children which were linked to Satanism based on hearsay, a member of the Church of Satan condemned so-called Satanic killings in an interview aired on SABC News in May 2013. He said children younger than 18 are not welcome in the church and Satanic rituals are misinterpreted by many people claiming to be Satanists. An article by Khuthala Nandipha in the Mail & Guardian newspaper highlighted community ignorance about Satanism and likely contributory factors including social decay and inequality and the abuse of alcohol and drugs such as nyaope. Gert van Rooyen Gert van Rooyen and his lover Joey Haarhoff were suspected by the South African Police of abducting and murdering several young girls who disappeared between 1988 and 1990. In January 1990, Van Rooyen killed Haarhoff and committed suicide during a police chase. In November 1991, Van Rooyen's son Flippie van Rooyen was convicted of murdering a 15-year-old Zimbabwean girl during his military service. His death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1993. In 1997 he said the missing girls were killed during Satanic rituals and were the victims of international child pornography rings, but no evidence of this was ever found. In 2001 he was sentenced to an additional six years' imprisonment for perjury for false statements he made about the missing girls. He was paroled in 2008. The whereabouts of the missing girls are still unknown. Death of Dawn Orso In September 1992 Dawn Orso was murdered in her home in the Rugby suburb of Cape Town. In March 1994 her daughter Angelique Orso and Angelique's boyfriend Lawrence van Blerk were convicted of the murder. The judge rejected their defence that they were acting involuntarily under the influence of demons. Angelique Orso received an 11-year prison sentence and van Blerk received an 8-year prison sentence. Abduction of Alison Botha In December 1994 Alison Botha was abducted, raped, stabbed and disembowelled by Frans du Toit and Theuns Kruger in Port Elizabeth. She miraculously survived the attack. Her attackers were described as \\"Satanists\\" in the media. Du Toit said he was possessed by a demon and underwent an \\"exorcism\\" in June 1995 which was publicised. Kobus Jonker testified he did not believe he was possessed by a demon. Du Toit and Kruger both received life sentences in August 1995. Satanism was not considered a mitigating factor in their sentencing. Maurice Smith In September 1997 Maurice Smith and two schoolboy accomplices murdered and decapitated a homeless man in East London. The schoolboys testified as state witnesses. Smith said he was a Satanic high priest and said he killed the man to obtain a human skull to give him power. He received a 30-year prison sentence in January 1998. Satanism was not considered a mitigating factor in his sentencing. Kobus Jonker said this murder gave SAPS their first concrete evidence of human sacrifice. Death of Charles Jacobs On 31 October 2005, Charles Jacobs was killed in a Paarl LDS church where he worked as custodian. The scene was staged as a crucifixion and the word \\"Satun\\" [sic] was written on the floor in blood. Although police spokespersons said it was probably a \\"botched burglary\\" not an occult murder, the killing was described as \\"Satanic\\" and \\"occult-style\\" in the media. Four suspects were arrested and charged with murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances but the state failed to make their case. One of the four suspects was convicted of theft while another was convicted of receiving stolen property. Both men received suspended sentences. Lotter case In July 2008 Johannes Petrus Lotter and his wife Maria Magdalena Lotter were murdered in their home in the Westville suburb of Durban. Their daughter Nicolette, their son Hardus and Nicolette's boyfriend Mathew Naidoo were arrested shortly afterwards. In 2009 Christelle Lotter, sister to Hardus and Nicolette, dismissed claims that her siblings were influenced by Satanism. The murder trial, which commenced in October 2011, involved references to God, the Bible, Satanism, a tokoloshe, demons and witchcraft. In March 2012 Nicolette, Hardus and Naidoo were convicted of the murder. The uncle of the Lotter siblings, Reverend Willem Lotter of the Dutch Reformed Church, gave evidence in mitigation of sentence during which he urged them to take responsibility for their actions. Nicolette received two 12-year concurrent prison sentences and Hardus received two 10-year concurrent prison sentences. The judge said people should not be allowed to escape liability as a result of a belief in witchcraft and the occult. Naidoo, whom the siblings said they believed to be the \\"third son of God\\" and was found to be the mastermind by the judge, received two life sentences. Morne Harmse In August 2008 18-year-old Morne Harmse went on a violent rampage at his Krugersdorp school, killing fellow pupil Jacques Pretorius and injuring several others with a katana. During the attack he wore a mask resembling one worn by the lead singer of heavy metal band Slipknot. It was reported he told bystanders Satan told him to do it. His parents told the press he was a victim of school bullying and said it seemed he had experimented with Satanism. Community speculation about a Satanic motive was dismissed as simplistic by SAPS psychologist Gerard Labuschagne. During early court proceedings it transpired that Harmse had told a doctor a ghost had told him to become a Satanist. In his subsequent admission of guilt of murder and attempted murder he said he did it to make an impression. Kobus Jonker later testified as expert witness the evidence did not suggest he was a Satanist. Harmse received a 20-year prison sentence in September 2009. Death of Michael van Eck In April 2011 Michael van Eck was murdered in a Welkom graveyard by Chane van Heerden and Maartens van der Merwe. The murder was labelled \\"Satanic\\" by Danie Krügel, a former police officer and founding member of Auksano. Soon after the murder Welkom police spokesperson Stephen Thakeng, who is also an ordained Christian minister, said gruesome discoveries on the couple's property confirmed the police's suspicion about their involvement in Satanism. People close to the couple said they were Christian and denied any link to Satanism. The Satanism link was dismissed by expert witnesses and van Heerden herself during her trial. SAPS psychologist Gerard Labuschagne testified aspects of the murder indicated it was a \\"psychologically motivated crime\\". In November 2011 van Heerden was declared a dangerous criminal and received a minimum prison sentence of 20 years, to be re-evaluated after 20 years. Van der Merwe received a life sentence in November 2012. Death of Kirsty Theologo In October 2011 18-year-old Kirsty Theologo died and a 14-year-old girl was seriously injured after being doused with petrol and set on fire in the Linmeyer southern suburb of Johannesburg. The incident was described as a \\"Satanic ritual\\" in the media. Six people aged 16 to 23 were charged with murder and attempted murder. In March 2012 18-year-old Lester Moody, the son of a Christian pastor, and 18-year-old Jeremy King entered into a plea bargain with the state. Each received a 17-year prison sentence, five years of which was suspended. In April 2013 Moody testified in the trial of the four others accused that the ritual, which he described as a \\"sacrifice\\" after reading it described that way in magazines, was based on a Bible verse with \\"Satanic elements\\" added later. The court also heard from a defence attorney that Theologo's friends were curious about Satanism but did not really understand what it entailed. In November 2013 Lindon Wagner and Robin Harwood were convicted of assault, murder and attempted murder. In February 2014 Wagner was sentenced to life imprisonment for Theologo's murder plus 18 years' imprisonment for attempted murder, while Harwood was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment for Theologo's murder. Deaths linked to Overcomers Through Christ ministry Between July 2012 and October 2012, two women and a male pastor with links to the Overcomers Through Christ (OTC) teaching ministry, as well as a neighbour of one of the women, were found stabbed to death in Gauteng. Friends of the victims and the media speculated the deaths were linked to Satanism. It was reported one of the women killed, Natacha Burger, was an OTC trainer who converted Satanists to Christianity and worked with former Satanists. In December 2017 six members of Overcomers Through Christ were arrested for the four murders which were among a total of 11 murders believed to have been committed by the group. The killings are believed to have stemmed from a factional split in the OTC membership. Death of Kyle Mudaly In September 2012 16-year-old Kyle Mudaly from the Reservoir Hills suburb of Durban committed suicide in his bedroom. A black hexagram was found on his bedroom wall. Speculation that the suicide was linked to a \\"Satanic cult\\" was dismissed by his family and friends, who said he was a practising Christian. Death of Keamogetswe Sefularo In March 2013 14-year-old Keamogetswe Sefularo from Lukhanyo Secondary School in the Mohlakeng township in Randfontein was allegedly fatally stabbed on her way home from school by a 15-year-old girl from the same school who was arrested immediately and charged with murder. Before dying Sefularo allegedly told her mother her attacker and two others present \\"interrogated her about an incident where she apparently called them goths\\" and said they were attacking her because \\"she hung out with Satanists\\". Other family members alleged the attackers had declared they were Satanists and the stabbing incident and attackers were labelled \\"Satanic\\" in the media. Police said there is no evidence of a Satanic group or occult- related crime in the area. Journalists were informed the case would be heard in camera. In October 2013 the teenage defendant confessed to the murder in court and received a prison sentence of 10 years, including a two-year suspended sentence. She said she committed the murder to be promoted within a cult after Sefularo had decided to leave the cult, and that she was attracted to the cult by the prospect of financial gain. Fatal exorcisms There have also been several reported cases of fatal \\"exorcisms\\" of children where the killers believed the victims were possessed by demons. *In November 2011 a priest and five adult congregation members of the African Gospel Church in Humansdorp in the Eastern Cape were arrested for killing Mihlali Mazantsi, a seven-year-old girl with epilepsy, during an exorcism ritual. *In March 2012 five relatives were arrested for the killing of Sinethemba Dlamini, a teenage girl from Umlazi in KwaZulu-Natal, during another exorcism. According to a police source, the girl was accused of being possessed by a demon after she had become withdrawn. Academic views Véronique Faure states \\"Satanism, a recent and marginal phenomenon in South Africa, is more often treated by the tabloids than by the academics.\\" In her 2012 MA thesis, Danielle Dunbar comments on the lack of academic interest in the subject: (not taking into account academic theses on Satanism written from a Christian perspective).

It was one of the highest selling beers in the United Kingdom in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. History Samuel Allsopp & Sons of Burton upon Trent first brewed Double Diamond in 1876 as an India Pale Ale. Allsopp merged with Ind Coope in 1935. Bottled Double Diamond began to be advertised heavily from 1946, becoming one of four nationally distributed beers by the 1950s. Under reciprocal trading agreements Ind Coope would agree to stock a rival brewer's beer if they replaced their supply of Bass or Worthington with Double Diamond.Strategic And Organizational Change: From Production to Retailing in Uk ...

The plant is currently the largest nuclear power plant in Taiwan. Generation The power plant can generate 16 billion kWh of electricity per year. Events 2010 On 7 October 2010, Unit 1 of the plant was shut down for refueling starting at 12:49 a.m. and was synchronized back to the system on 31 October at 12:14 p.m. establishing a new record in Taiwan for the shortest nuclear power plant overhaul duration of 24.48 days. 2011 On 17 May 2011, Taipower and New Taipei City Fire Department organized the very first compound disaster drill in Taiwan. This event was held at the Kuosheng Nuclear Power Plant and observed by President Ma Ying- jeou. The training scenario was based on the events of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster that occurred on 11 March 2011. A statement issued by Taipower indicated that in the worst-case scenario, where the plant experiences total power failure, saving lives would be top priority. In this scenario, the plant would be abandoned and seawater injected to prevent the meltdown of the nuclear core. 2012 During routine maintenance of the power plant on 16 March 2012, the plant maintenance workers discovered problems with seven anchor bolts used to secure the bottom of the nuclear reactor to the steel-reinforced concrete substrate that holds the weight of the reactor. One bolt was broken, two were fractured and four were cracked. Taipower said that they would consult relevant agencies to analyze and fix the problem and add vibration-monitoring sensors near the reactor base for continuous monitoring. 2013 The plant's number one nuclear reactor automatically shut down on Friday, 21 June 2013. The automatic shutdown occurred because protective device was activated when the generator's grounding signal showed abnormal activity. This was a result of a loose blade in the air damper that fell onto the busbar insulator between the generator and main transformer. The incident did not damage the reactor and there was no release of radioactivity. Taipower mitigated the event by re-securing the blade and replacing the related components. The power plant was back online by Sunday, 23 June 2013. 2015 On 26 December 2015, reactor number one shut down unexpectedly due to a problem with its control systems.http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201605160023.aspx 2016 On 16 May 2016, reactor number two was suspended following a fire caused by a short circuit. The incident occurred shortly after operations resumed following annual maintenance. In 2018, technical approval for a restart was given, but actual restart is subject to parliamentary approval.http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201605160023.aspx On 30 May 2016, one of the reactors suddenly shut down. 2017 Between 21-23 September 2017, an annual safety drill took place in which 10,000 personnel were mobilized. The drill was headed by the Atomic Energy Council Deputy Minister Chiu Tzu- tsung as commander-in-chief, Health and Welfare Deputy Minister Hsueh Jui- yuan, and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Yang Wei-fuu as deputy commanders. Awards On 3 November 2010, the 6th 2010 Asia Power Awards in Singapore awarded the plant a gold medal for the Best Operation and Maintenance Project for installing a 360-degree work platform over the nuclear reactor.

History The Jewish Digital Archive Project (JDAP) began in 2011. The project is based at The Isaac and Jessie Kaplan Centre at Cape Town University. The Jewish Digital Archive is collecting photography, film and oral history interviews for their archives for educational purposes such as academic research as well as for public genealogical interest. The JDAP can be compared to other broader archival initiatives at UCT for example: The Center for Popular Memory, The Michaelis Photographic Archives, and The University of Cape Town’s Library Manuscripts and Archives . However, The Jewish Digital Archive Project’s fundamental purpose is to connect members of the Jewish Community in Southern Africa. Aims JDAP aims to ensure that future generations benefit from stories of the past and keep up with the present. Taking place in South Africa in a Post- Apartheid era with new digital technology like Adobe Photoshop Lightroom websites and scanners, the project aims to create innovative ways of understanding and preserving legacies from the past. One of the ways JDAP plans to do this is through a website. This project is taken place during a period where new ways of preserving and archiving are being explored. Once the JDAP website has been constructed, people will be able to view and share their histories and memories with others. The website will be interactive and constantly updated and co-created by the user. There will be a space for comments, insights and identifications which are essential when it comes to helping find people, form links and identify areas and themes of interest. By uploading material on to website film and photographs have less of a risk of being lost or damaged.  Themes The photograph and film collections trace the history of Jewish people in Southern Africa. Many of these people came from places such as: Zimbabwe, Potchefstroom, Cuba and Lithuania.

His work has evolved beyond freelance photography and has begun exploring video and multimedia work.  Early life  Esiebo was born in Lagos, Nigeria. Given a camera in 2000 as a gift by his friend Jose Maria, Esiebo began teaching himself photography and began photographing the rapid development of Urban Nigeria. Thereafter, Esiebo began internet correspondences with a U.S. based photographer, Paul Udstrand, who gave him his first sets of photography books in which he began to develop his knowledge of photography further.

He is a founding member of Nigeria's photojournalism collective, Black Box, Nigeria. The collective is made up photographers of varied age and education throughout Africa in which members have engaged in many artistic activities, either individually or in collaboration with groups.http://www.shoottheearth.com/?myportfoliotype=andrew-esiebo-nigeria Esiebo is a part of the Progress of Love, a collaborative project between the Menil Collection, Houston; Centre for Contemporary Art, Lagos ; and the Pulitzer Arts Foundation, St. Louis. Esiebo has also had his photos published in books, magazine and websites such as guardian.co.uk, Marie Claire Italia, Time Out Nigeria, Mail & Guardian online, Laia Books, Geo-Lino, KIT and African style magazine Arise.  Residencies  Esiebo has completed a number of artistic residencies including a five-month stay in Paris under Cultures France's Visa Pour Creation, a three-month residency at the Gasworks in London as part of the Africa Beyond programme and a three-month residency at the Gyeonggi Creation Center in [South Korea] December 2011. In 2008, Esiebo, released the ongoing exhibition Eyes from South to West that was part of a residency in London initiated by Africa Beyond in partnership with Gasworks International Residency Programme, in association with The Photographers' Gallery. The exhibition explores the experiences of individuals and families who migrated from Nigeria to Europe through photography and audio interviews. The exhibition sough to expose the tensions between the dreams of starting a new life abroad and the realities that occur alongside. The project builds on Esiebo's approach to documentary photography which focuses on building relationships and trust to produce a genuine involvement with his surroundings.  Awards  In 2007, Esiebo won a Cultures France (now Institut Français) Visa pour la Creation Award and began exploring other avenues of photojournalism with his first video and multimedia work titled “Living Queer African” which highlights the life of a young gay Cameroonian living in Paris. In 2011 Eseibo also won the 2011 Artistic Creation prize by the Musee du Quai Branly, Paris. He used the award to embark on a photographic exploration titled Pride which documented the phenomenon of men's hairdressers in the countries of west Africa: Nigeria, Benin, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Senegal and Mauritania. Esiebo explores the profession of hairdresser as hair styles and techniques provide a significant contribution to the construction of individual and collective identities in West Africa. Esiebo explores the role played by hairdressing salons in social mobility, and the manner in which the sector functions as a point of convergence between people from all backgrounds.  International exhibitions  In November 2006, Esiebo's works on Nigeria Culture and Natural Heritage were published in by Laia Libros, Barcelona, Spain in collaboration with UNESCO titled Lagos: Life goes on and was also featured in an exhibition in Syria titled Meetings in the Middle East. He also was highlighted in the Noorderlicht Photography Festival. His photos were displayed as part of the Acts of Faith in the 2007 festival. In 2009 Esiebo was featured as a guest speaker in the Chobi Mela V Photo Festival in Bangladesh. In 2010 Esiebo was selected for the World Press Photography Dream project of 16 journalists who were to provide alternative narratives to the World Cup in South Africa. His collection \\"Alter Gogo\\" took a different approach to the global phenomenon of the Soccer World Cup in South Africa 2010. In visiting a shanty town near Johannesburg, Orange Fam, he met a soccer team made up of grandmothers: the Gogo Getters. His series juxtaposed images of the elderly women in their home with their grandchildren contrasting with images of them in their soccer outfits on their home pitch. This series contradicts the images of elderly South Africans as it directly challenges the ideas of sports and leisure as belonging only to the youthful generation and places a sense of agency within women who too often are disregarded within the sports community as well. Esiebo's work was with Alter Gogo was therefore exhibited for the first time in France in Photoquai 2011. This exhibition was also on display at the 11th Havana Biennial in [Cuba]. In 2011, his work was on display titled \\"Sharon Stone of Abuja\\", at Location One Gallery in New York City. This exhibition sought to explore and re-imagine \\"Nollywood\\" – i.e. the Nigerian video film industry. Nollywood first emerged nearly 20 years ago and has rapidly grown to become the third largest film industry in the world after Hollywood and Bollywood. Sharon Stone in Abuja – named after a famous Nollywood film – was an attempt to reveal the psychodrama of Nigerian life and a visual homage to the emotional and psychological landscape of Africa. In 2012 Esiebo produced a series on the 2012 Olympics in London titled The Games: Inspiring Images, Lens on Twelve, London. Lens on Twelve was an exhibition that sought to shift the focus of the Olympic Games to the other side of the event, onto artists of other nationalities. The artists were asked to reflect on how they felt about the global event in a single photographic work. For this Esiebo produce the Soccer World Series. Esiebo discussed how soccer is more than just a game in Nigeria: it is a venue that unites people regardless of their socio-economic status. This series demonstrate that the game is not confined to stadiums and formal matches in Nigeria, but is unfolding on beaches, public spaces, etc. In August 2015, Esiebo was featured on Instagram's official accounthttp://www.pulse.ng/tech/andrew-eseibo-nigerian- photographer-featured-on-instagrams-official-account-id4065614.html for his outstanding work. The post which quoted Esiebo, while speaking on his early days as a struggling photographer in Lagos, Nigeria, as saying, “Back then, I would take pictures with my film camera, scan them and email to Paul for his feedback. And at some point, he sent me books with titles on light, camera equipment, the business of photography and darkroom processing. I studied those books religiously and acquired the confidence to be more creative and skillful with my camera.”  Nigerian photo series  Esiebo has developed his career by documenting the landscape and communities of Nigeria of which he has chosen the following to be highlighted as part of his online portfolio. Message to Mister President – this series captures Nigeria's Federal government removal of subsidies on petrol prices on 1 January 2012. This resulted to a sudden 160% hike on fuel prices that led to a nationwide protest. As a result, Nigerians took to the streets to demonstrate against the petrol price incensement and displaying their grievance with state of governance in the country. Esiebo highlighted the individual protesters and their messages to the president of Nigeria. God is Alive – as religious spaces are spread throughout the country, this body of work demonstrates how Nigerians have exuberated their own brand of praise on to the Pentecostal and evangelical churches. Esiebo covers the large gatherings known as the \\"crusades\\" that are held across the country in which Nigerians crowd together to ignite their faith. This exhibition was part of the Lagos Photography Festival in October 2010, the first international art and photography festival to be held in Nigeria. Femi Kuti and the Afrika Shrine – this body of work outlines the bustling night life of Lagos: the commercial hub of Nigeria and the most populated city in West Africa. Although it is a city of crime, congestion and poverty to an outside viewer, Esiebo develops the city as a vibrant metropolis particularly highlights a local night club, Afrika Shrine. Nigeria on my mind – 'Nigeria on my Mind' is a photographic journey of Esibo's travels throughout Nigeria. Over several years, working on both personal projects and commissioned work for travel guides and NGOs, Esiebo has photographed the rich cultural heritage, ethnic diversity and geographic beauty of Nigeria extensively. Soccer Worlds – an ongoing series looking at the appropriation of football in unconventional environments in Nigeria. Nneka – this was a photo shoot done by Esiebo for Soundcity Magazine with Nigerian musician Nneka, whose socially conscious music flies in the face of the R&B;/hip-hop music so popular in contemporary Africa today. Pool Betting – this photo group documents the trend of football pool betting which was a cultural import from the 1920s British influence, yet it has emerged as a popular activity among old men in Nigeria. Living Positive – centred on the life of Thoko Ngubeni, a black, female lesbian with HIV. Rejected by her family and friends, at one point she was on the verge of death, but today she has managed to turn her life around, using all of her talent and resources to make a better life for herself and others. Ngubeni is the founder of a women's support group called Mafithobelae. Esiebo follows Ngubeni on a photo journey to her black township in Mpumalanga, where she organises public meetings to educate local people on issues relating to HIV and Aids. Through the photo series, Ngubeni's experience living with HIV is brought into a positive light as we see her attempts to provide access to testing and medication in her community and attempts to combat the stigma associated with the virus. Survival Games – tells the story of Sunny Omini, an ex-football star in Nigeria whose promising career was cut short by injuries. Documenting his post-career, Esiebo walks us through this man's journey from a football coach to a Christian missionary. Years later he returned to the game, setting up the Signal Meteor Football Academy, a grassroots training academy for young men in danger of social exclusion. Today, he works with around 30 footballers on what he calls a 'church on a field', helping them to build a brighter future through soccer. Members Only – Lagos has one of the most vibrant nightlife scenes in Africa and 'Members Only' offers a rare access to the life of the Lagos nightclub bouncer. Following one bouncer from his daily three-hour workouts to his overnight shifts, Esiebo offers a fresh and unflinching insight into life outside of Nigerian night clubs. Vuvuzela Journeys – Esiebo exposes in this photo series the links between the image of the vuvuzela in the 2010 South Africa World and its connection to 20th century church traditions where it was thought to have healing powers. Esiebo juxtaposes photographs from the 2010 World Cup with those used traditionally in KwaZulu- Natal-based Shembe Church.

In 2011, Esiebo released another multimedia film titled Barbara Encounter. The film is of a sex worker from Lusaka, Zambia. The film narrates the live of one of many women in Zambia who work the streets to provide a better life for their families. Esiebo narrates her life story through a synopsis of intimate portraits that depict the woman's life both on and off the streets to give a more holistic approach to the lives of Zambian sex workers. In 2013, Esiebo furthered his multimedia career in his work on Enlarging the Kingdomhttp://www.pentecostalaesthetics.net/documentary/ which is a documentary film in partnership with Annalisa Bulttucci. The documentary delves into the influence of Africa Pentecostals in Italy which was screened on 23 April 2013 alongside a panel discussion event. Enlarging the Kingdom explores the encounter, interactions, and conflicts between Catholicism and African Pentecostalism by putting in conversation Nigerian and Ghanaian Pastors and Catholic Priests. The documentary looks at their diverse understanding of evil forces, authorised and unauthorised forms of relating to the Divine, the making of idols and icons, and religious leadership and authority to offer an insight into the challenges of African Pentecostals in Italy and the role of Pentecostal Churches for African immigrant communities.

History Frederiksborg was a small triangular fort from which Cape Coast Castle could easily be bombarded. It functioned for a short time as the headquarters of the Danes on the Gold Coast, before it was moved to Christiansborg Castle in Osu. After the English in 1665 took over Cape Coast Castle, reinforced it, and used it as their new headquarters, the Danes had little use of their fort. The fort was first pawned to the English in 1679 before it was finally sold to them in 1685. The English reconstructed the fort in 1699 and renamed it Fort Royal. They soon abandoned it again, however.

It was part of Tanjore District during British rule. ‘Chaithanyapuram’ also known as ‘Sethanipuram' is a small village on the banks of river Cauvery, situated near Sri Vanchiyam, Nachiyar Koil and Kudavasal / Nannilam. The village is located at a distance of about 21 km from Kumbakonam. As per Krishna Premi Anna’s citation in his book \\"South India and Brahmin's History\\", Sethanipuram is one among the four villages to which the Shukla Yajur Vedis migrated from the North during the Chola period. he temples in and around the Agraharam themselves are a proof to the sanctity of the village. Located on the west is the Lakshmi Narayana Swamy temple which houses the renowned Kothanda Ramaswamy Sannadhi. On the eastern side stands Lord Meenakshi Sundareshwarar showering his divine blessings on the village. On the banks of river Mudikondan is the Sri Sakthi Ganapathy temple. The patron deities Sri Sastha, Sri Kaliamman, Sri Peetapahari Amman and Sri Maha Mariamman (a.k.a. Velural) compassionately guard the village on all the four corners. Temples are the first thing that the Kings used to construct to spread Vedas and Sastras. It is believed that Meenakshi Sundareswar Swami temple, a very ancient and sanctified temple, was constructed during that time. The temple was constructed with utmost devotion and the activities were personally overseen by the Kings and it turned out to be a great monument of worship for ardent devotees of Lord Shiva. While Lord Sri Sundareswar and Goddess Meenakshi are worshipped as principal deities, the temple includes other sannadhis where other patron deities (Parivara Devata) deities are adored. Starting with Vinayagar Sannadhi, the temple has the divine presence of Sri Subramanian Sannadhi, Gajalakshmi Sannadhi, Maha Mariamman Sannadhi, Sri Guru Bahawan Sannadhi, Sri Durga Sannadhi, Chandikeshwarar Sannadhi, Sri Meenakshi Amman Sannadhi, Sri Sivan Sannadhi, Navagraha Sannadhi, Bhairavar, Soorya & Chandran Sannadhi. The Maha Mandapam and the outer Mandapam depict the true tradition, architecture and values of Chola culture. It is believed, from the village elders, that the temple was renovated 250–300 years back by a Deekshidar whose Samadhi is located between the Kulam (Pond) and the temple. During our trip to Thiruvannamalai in early 1990s, we met Sri Yogi Ram Suratkumar and he informed us that there is a Samadhi of a Sadhu located at our village. Sri Ramalingam of SBI tried locating this Samadhi after spending couple of years, he was stopped by Yogi saying that this task has been assigned by the almighty for somebody else. There are also printed reports from Kalyana Kalpatharu (edition 1945), published from Varanasi, stating that Sri Venkatrama Iyer, belonging to this village, was the first to spread Panduranga Nama in South India. (TP Kodandarama) . From hearsay, Goddess Meenakshi is known for miracles and we have even witnessed some of them. Papanasam Sivan, the great Tamil composer is said to have got special powers after seeing Meenakshi. The fact that Maha Periyava has visited this temple twice during his Vijay Yathras and has stayed here is a testimony to the piousness of the temple. What's special about Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple? Goddess ‘Meenakshi’ is widely revered as a benevolent deity who bestows boons upon her devotees. The temple is very special as far as the Sthala, Moorthi and Theertham are concerned. It is a prominent Manokarakha Sthalam. (Manokaraka also means ‘Ruler of the Mind’) Worshipping this deity will wipe away all agony, problems and diseases of the mind. The deity would also vanquish fears, hatred, sorrow and anxiety; and bestow the devotee with a tranquil mind. Many Yogis, Gnanis and Siddha Purushas have benefitted from worshipping Perumal and Ammai. Amongst them, is the well-known Sri Rama Nama Yatheendral, who recited the Rama Nama with utmost devoutness, attained Siddhi in the Sannadhi and has performed exceptional miracles. Sri Rama Nama Yatheendral’s Athistanam is situated at this very place. (Adhishtanam is the sub-stratum. In Advaita Vedanta, the real entity located in which the unreal thing is perceived).

Cann (born 1951) is a geneticist who made a scientific breakthrough on mitochondrial DNA variation and evolution in humans, popularly called Mitochondrial Eve. Her discovery that all living humans are genetically descended from a single African mother who lived <200,000 years ago became the foundation of the Out of Africa theory, the most widely accepted explanation of the origin of all modern humans. She is currently Professor in the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. Early life and education Rebecca Cann was born in 1951 and spent her childhood at Des Moines, Iowa, where she completed her elementary schooling. In a summer, just before she started high school, her family moved to San Francisco, California. In 1967 she entered an all-girl Catholic High School in California. She earned a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree with a major in genetics at University of California, Berkeley in 1972. She then worked at Cutter Laboratories at Berkeley for five years (1972-1977) after finishing college, where she worked on macaque serum proteins and learned the techniques for constructing phylogenetic tree, which would be pivotal for her later achievements. She continued at UC Berkeley for her doctorate in genetics under the supervision of Allan Wilson of the Department of Biochemistry, and graduated in 1982. She got a Postdoctoral Fellowship at Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). She joined the faculty of the Department of Genetics, University of Hawaii at Honolulu in 1986. Mitochondrial Eve Cann laid the experimental groundwork for the concept of Mitochondrial Eve, and the consequent Out of Africa theory. From late 1970s she had collected mtDNA samples from women of different ethnic backgrounds, such as from Asia, South Pacific, Europe and Americans of African descent. The data were used in her PhD thesis in 1982. Following her research, a junior graduate student Mark Stoneking added samples from aboriginal Australians and New Guineans. In 1987, after a year of delay, their collective paper was published in Nature in which their findings indicated that all living humans were descended through a single mother, who lived ~200,000 years ago in Africa. The theoretical mother of all humans popularly became the Mitochondrial Eve, and the underlying concept directly implies recent African origin of modern humans, hence, the tenet of the so-called Out of Africa theory. Personal life She retains the surname Cann from her former husband whom she married in 1972, right after her graduation from Berkeley. In fact she helped her then husband through his graduate school and only when he finished, she started attending graduate school. Cann was featured on MidWeek‘s cover on 19 March 1997 for her Mitochondrial Eve. Bibliography *Wilson AC, Stoneking M, Cann RL, Prager EM, Ferris SD, Wrischnik LA, Higuchi RG. 1987.

The tower was built between 1578 and 1580 to a design by the Bolognese architect Ottaviano Mascherino (who was credited with building the Apostolic Palace) mainly to promote the study of astronomy for the Gregorian Calendar Reform which was commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII and promulgated in 1582. It was then also known as the Tower of Winds. The tower was also called \\"Specola Astronomica Vaticana\\", a reference to the Vatican Observatory. Four stages of progressive development have occurred since it was first established. The tower was an edifice of great value for astronomical observations made using a sundial as they provided essential confirmation of the need to reform the Julian calendar. Early history Pope Gregory XIII (Pope from 1572 to 1585) who established the Gregorian Calendar and the Gregorian Tower. The first stage of building of the tower, as recorded by Leo XIII in his motu proprio Ut mysticam of 1891, is credited to Pope Gregory XIII, Pope from 1572 to 1585. The directive was to build a tower at a suitable location in the Vatican and equip it with the \\"greatest and best instruments of the time\\". The design was effected after a series of meetings of the experts who had been appointed to reform the Julian calendar, in use since 45 BC, to verify their proposed reforms. Fr. Christoph Clavius, a Jesuit mathematician from the Roman College, was the expert on the committee who suggested the new system for the observations. The tower was then built above the museum and library, flanked by the Belvedere and della Pigna courtyards. The instrumentation for the observation of the sun rays falling over it consisted of a meridian line designed by Ignazio Danti of Perugia. It was in the form of a circular marble plate in the centre, embellished with scientific designs. The tower still remains today, but has undergone improvements over the centuries. Second stage The second stage of construction in the 17th and 18th centuries, when the tower was under the charge of the Vatican librarian, involved Mgr. Filippo Luigi Gilii, a clergyman of St. Peter's Basilica. Earlier in 1797, Pius VI gave approval to placing a Latin inscription Specula Vaticana at the entrance to the upper part of the tower, which was implemented by Cardinal Zelada with plans to enhance the instrumentation system in the tower's observatory. The original observatory was then set up above the second level of the tower with the agreement of Pope Pius VI. Its instrumentation, apart from many normal devices (such as meteorological and magnetic equipment, with a seismograph and a small transit and pendulum clock,) was noted for the Dolland Telescope. The instrumentation facilitated recording of occurrences of eclipse, appearance of comets, Satellites of Jupiter and Mercury’s transit. As an addition, under the patronage of Pope Pius X, four rotary observatory domes were also added at strategic locations on the long fortification walls, more than a thousand years old. Mgr. Gilii, highly respected as a polyglot with a knowledge of physics, biology, archeology and the Hebrew language, was in charge of the observatory from 1800 to 1821. He carried out continuous meteorological observations (twice a day at 6 AM and 2 PM) conforming to the programme of the Mannheim Meteorological Society. While the observation records for seven years were published, the balance data in a manuscript form was preserved in the Vatican Library. Subsequent to Gilii's death in 1821, the observatory on the tower was discontinued and the instruments were moved to the observatory at the Roman College. Established in 1787, it was considered more suitable for making observations than the Vatican. Third stage The revival of the observatory on the Gregorian Tower was initiated by the Barnabite Francesco Denza with the approval of Pope Leo XIII. High quality instruments were procured, partly with generous donations from Hicks of London, and the automatic recording instruments were procured from Richard in Paris. A four- inch equatorial, a three-inch transit instrument, and four pendulum clocks with two chronometers, were also procured from the observatory at Modena. In 1888, the gift of a 16 inch long telescope to Pope Leo XIII, became a part of the observatory. Father Denza joined the observatory in 1889 after it was upgraded with more modern instruments. The same year, a second tower was built some away from the main Gregorian Tower, overlooking the Vatican Gardens behind St. Peter's Basilica on the south-west border. It was built to a diameter of with a lower wall thickness of , which could bear the load of a 13-inch photographic refractor, newly procured from Paris. Augustinian Father Rodriguez was the expert meteorologist who held the post of director from 1898 to 1905. In 1891, Pope Leo XIII, promulgating the motu proprio Ut mysticam, designated the second tower as the seat of the newly established Vatican Observatory, a decision which required altering the roof to provide a flat terrace for astronomical observations. Fourth stage The fourth stage involved remedying the problem of communicating between the two towers during the time of Pope Pius X. His plans were to make the Gregorian Tower into a historical tower and to record and carry out observations at the second tower by linking the two towers along the fortified wall with a iron bridge spanning the gap. At the west end of this bridge, a four-inch equatorial was installed on semicircular bastion. The east end of the bridge, above the barracks of the gendarmes, had a heliograph, with a camera attached, used to photograph the Sun (photoheliograph). A new 16-inch visual telescope, called Torre Pio X, was erected in the second tower. As a result of these modifications, the original library was moved to the Pontifical Academy Lincei, and the old meteorological and seismic instruments were shifted to the Valle di Pompei observatory. The new Astronomical Library was housed in two rooms of the building. The two new Repsold machines were used for recording on the astrographic plates. The recorded observations were published along with explanatory notes together with the last two series of the atlas of stars. Charts were printed on silver bromide paper. Features The tower had two floors and a mezzanine. On the first floor was the famous Sundial Room or Meridian Room, which was initially an open loggia. Pope Urban VIII had it enclosed and it was subsequently decorated with long sequences of frescoes painted between 1580 and 1582 by Simon Lagi and the two Flemish artists Paul and Matthijs Bril. Today the tower has paintings by Niccolò Circignani and Matteino da Siena. The Sundial Room, also called the Meridian Hall, was once the residence of Queen Christina of Sweden, then newly converted to Catholicism. The room was further modified by two additions which gave it its current name: a sundial, and a delicate but sophisticated anemoscope to measure the wind, which was fixed to the ceiling of the Meridian Hall. These were created by Ignazio Danti, the papal cosmographer, in association with the Gregorian Calendar Reform. The sundial consisted of a straight line in white marble running across the floor in a north-south direction, intended to measure the height of the Sun at noon according to the seasons of the year. The observations made with the sundial provided essential confirmation of the need to reform the Julian calendar. The anemoscope, in contrast, was a complex mechanism attached to the ceiling which was used to measure the strength and direction of the wind but soon stopped functioning. The instrument may have led to the other name of the tower, Tower of the Winds; however, an ancient observatory at Athens was also called the Tower of the Winds and might have been the source for inspiration. The interior walls and ceiling of the hall were richly decorated, in some cases with gaudy frescoes of the hills and Roman countryside, the Pantheons, religious themes, the buildings surrounding the area, and naval shipwrecks with Jesus calming the storm and so forth.

Examples include gamma-ray bursts,Gamma signature, Astronomer's Telegram cast light on dazzling blazar,Symmetry, 30 April 2009 microlenses, supernovae, novae, or X-ray transients, but there are no restrictions on content matter. Telegrams as available instantly on the service's website and distributed to subscribers via email digest within 24 hours. The Astronomer's Telegram was launched on 17 December 1997 by Robert E. Rutledge with the goal of rapidly (<1 s) sharing information of interest to astronomers. Telegrams are sent out daily by email, but especially time sensitive events can be transmitted instantly. Since 2013, information is also broadcast over Twitter and Facebook. To publish, astronomers request credentials. Credentials are issued to professional astronomers and graduate students, after verification by personal contact. Once credentials have been supplied and telegrams authorized, astronomers can publish telegrams directly, with no further editing. As of August 2019, over 13000 telegrams have been published.  History  While working at Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrische Physik in Garching, Bob Rutledge began the site after his experience in using the web in 1995-6 as an aid in the discovery and characterization (by multiple scientists working informally and collaboratively) of the Bursting Pulsar, GRO J1744-28. Operations began in earnest at the department of astronomy of UC Berkeley where Rutledge was a visiting post-doctoral scholar with Prof. Lars Bildsten. The service received international attention following a March 20, 2018 when Peter Dunsby submitted a report of a \\"very bright optical transient near the Trifid and Lagoon Nebulae\\". Forty minutes later he posted again apologizing, saying that the object in question was \\"identified as Mars\\". The Astronomer's Telegram editors presented Dunsby with a tongue-in-cheek award as discoverer of Mars. Dunsby later described the incident to Newsweek as \\"an honest mistake arising from simply not checking what else was in my camera frame, during an automated astrophotography session and of very little consequence in the scheme of things. The world needs to smile more, so that’s something good that has come out of this episode,”  Current operations  The Astronomer's Telegram currently has an editor in chief, an editor and a co-editor. The ATel service is free, both for publishers and readers of the telegrams. The Astronomer's Telegrams editors remind users to report discoveries of supernovae or comets to the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams as well.

Foundation  Hillside School was founded in 1870 by Rev Edward Ford as a boys school, in West Malvern Road near a water spring of the same name. In the 1950s, the school relocated and the original building was divided up into private residences. Recent history By 1955, Hillside had expanded to include girls. It relocated first to one, and then to two large houses in Worcester Road, facing the Malvern Link Common. The lower building was acquired later than 1955, at 179 Worcester Road and opposite the junction of Cockshot Road. It housed the senior boys' department and nursery/kindergarten, while the upper building, three houses along westwards, contained the girls' and junior boys' departments. The latter was known variously as the \\"girls school\\" or \\"top school\\", the former the \\"boys school\\". The school excelled in preparing its pupils for the 11+ and Common Entrance examinations which qualified them for entry to local grammar and private secondary schools. At that time, Hillside was run by headmaster F W Quibell-Smith, former choirmaster and organist. St. Edmund's, Dudley; music master, Lichfield. Grammar School, and organist at Malvern Priory. His wife Dorothy was headmistress of the kindergarten and girls school, and his sons John and Peter later helped out in various capacities. Hillside had about 200 pupils and employed around a dozen other teachers, some of whom were part-time. The school did not possess playing fields of its own, and some sports lessons were held on Malvern Link Common. John Quibell-Smith wrote plays for the annual Speech Day, which involved as many members of the school as possible. A school badge was devised in 1956 or 1957 showing three primroses for learning with a background of a stylised triangular hill and the initials H and S on either side of the apex of the hill. Uniforms included a navy blue blazer for the boys with yellow piping, a tie with horizontal navy blue and yellow stripes, and a navy blue cap with yellow piping on the quadrants. Girls wore a navy blue traditional gym slip with a knitted yellow girdle round the waist. In April 1957, Queen Elizabeth II visited Malvern and as her route passed the school, pupils lined Worcester Road to wave. When F W Quibell-Smith retired, his son John took over as headmaster. The falling demand for private school education in the 1980s, however, led to the school's closure at the end of 1991. The top school has since been converted to flats and the boys school building on Worcester Road is currently a private residence. In 2012 a 40-year reunion was held by former pupils of the school from the 1960s and 1970s.

By the time he was able to get Indian Citizenships to about 13000 Refugees. He made representations to make a Permanent Cell for Refugees which was duly appointed in 2004 under the Chairmanship of Principal Secretary Home, Government of Rajasthan. Sodha is continuously advocating for rail link between Sindh & Rajasthan since 2005. In 2005 he formed another organisation Seemant lok Sangathan to work on cross border peace initiative as the border of Rajasthan has an important issue of divided families. He organised a refugee conference in December 2005. this was a unique event of its kind as all refugees from south Asia participated in that. Representatives from Burma, Tibet, Chitgaon hill track, Tamils & also Kashmir pandits participated. again in December 2010 he convened a conference of conflict & displacement in Delhi. Seemant Lok Sanghathan(सीमान्त लोक संगठन) (2005): In 2005 Sodha formed the Seemant Lok Sangathan to take up the issue of Refugees on a larger canvass. Later, he was appointed a member of High Power Committee under the Chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary Development in 2007. He is still a representative in the state committee under the chairmanship of ACS development & also member in both the committees under the chairmanship of divisional commissioners of Jodhpur & Bikaner respectively in the capacity of President, Seemant Lok Sangathan. Due to his efforts for the first time refugees coming on pilgrim visa were permitted to live in India by government of India. This time situation is worst in Pakistan he met almost every political party to make the common consensus on the issue & due to his efforts in September & December 2012 serious debate in both the houses of parliament effected in which all Political parties favoured the cause of Pakistani refugees. He himself led a demonstration in front of State Assembly again in October 2012. Universal Just Action Society – UJAS(2008): In 2008, Seemant Lok Sangathan was registered as a non-governmental organisation under the name Universal Just Action Society (UJAS). SLS and UJAS are synonymous. UJAS serves as an NGO with international recognition, while refugee communities most commonly refer to the organisation as Seemant Lok Sangathan. UJAS/SLS continues to promote and accomplish the original objectives of SLS and PVS at their founding. At the heart of the organisation lie the direct efforts of Mr. Hindu Singh Sodha, who has dedicated his life to this issue and to aiding Pakistani refugees in whatever way he can. Though India is not signatory of UN convention of refugees of 1951 neither had signed its protocol of 1967 but under his leadership the issue of Pakistani Hindu refugees is being taken seriously. Sodha is working with refugees of Pakistan living in Rajasthan itself wherein 10,000 people migrated in 1965 and 90,000 people migrated in 1971, about 20,000 have migrated since then till now. Apart from Rajasthan Sodha is also active for the cause of Refugees in the States of Haryana, Delhi, and Gujarat as well as for Pakistani migrants taking refuge in states of Madhya Pradesh & Chhattisgarh. Sodha participated in the People's SAARC Conference organised by civil society in Delhi, Kathmandu and Nepal on various occasions. Due to the efforts of Sodha, it was for the first time that the issue of refugees was included in the agenda of Peoples SAARC conference held in Kathmandu in the year 2008. Sodha also participated in South Asia social forum meeting in Dhaka in 2011 References Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:People from Jodhpur Category:Social workers from Rajasthan Category:Indian male social workers Category:Indian people of Pakistani descent Category:Pakistani emigrants to India Category:Pakistani people of Indian descent Category:Pakistani people of Rajasthani descent Category:Pakistani Hindus ","title":"Hindu Singh Sodha"},{"id":"39335132","text":"Pasiphilodes diaboeta is a moth in the family Geometridae.

Its purpose is to assemble a bend on a workpiece. A bend is manufactured by using a bending tool during a linear or rotating move. The detailed classification can be done with the help of the kinematics.M. Weck, p. 112 Universal bending machine for flat material CNC bending CNC bending machines are developed for high flexibility and low setup times. Those machines are able to bend single pieces as well as small batches with the same precision and efficiency as series- produced parts in an economical way. Universal bending machines – modular construction Universal bending machines consists of a basic machine that can be adjusted with little effort and used for a variety of bends. A simple plug- in system supports quick and easy exchange of tools. The basic machine consists of a CNC-operated side stop, a work bench, and software for programming and operating. Its modular construction offers an affordable entry into the bending technology, because after an initial investment the machine can be customized and extended later without any conversion. That means the basic machine delivers a bending stroke, and the tool determines the kind of bending. Bending tools 90' bending tool In the case of bending tools they are classified by the kind of generated bends. They can be constructed to adjust the bending angle by reference, stroke measurement or angle measurement. CNC machines usually abstain from a reference part. They grant a high bending accuracy starting with the first work piece. Standard bends Standard bending with a universal bending machine All bends without an extraordinary geometry belong to standard bends. The distance between a bend and the material end is quite high providing an adequate bearing area. The same with one bend to the next. Typical tools are a so-called bending former combined with a prisms with electronic angular measurement or an ordinary prism. U-bending For U-bends where tight and narrow bends are necessary, the bending former is replaced by a bending mandrel. A bending mandrel has a narrow geometry. Offset bending Offset bending tools are used to assemble two bends with a small distance between in one step. Edgewise bending  Edge bending tools are used if the bending axis is placed parallel to the tight side of the work piece. Tools for bending on edge may include electronic angular measurement allowing a high bending accuracy. Torsion bending Torsion tools are able to rotate the workpiece on the longitudinal axis. Alternatives are complex assembly groups with standard bends. Angular measurement and spring back compensation For producing single pieces as well as small batches with the same precision and efficiency as series- produced parts, a spring back compensation is helpful. A bending accuracy of +/- 0.2° starting from the first work piece is achieved due to calculated spring back compensation and the use of electronic tools. Operating mode angular measurement  Bending prisms with electronic angular measurement technology are equipped with two flattened bending bolds. That bold rotate while bending giving a signal to the angle measurement. The measuring accuracy is about 0.1º. The computer then calculates the required final stroke and spring back of every bend is compensated regardless of material type. A high angle accuracy of +/- 0.2º is achieved instantly with the first workpiece without adjustments. Compared to adjustment by reference, material waste amounts are decreased, because even inconsistencies within a single piece of material are automatically adjusted . Operating mode stroke measurement Wherever bending prisms with electronic angular measurement are not suitable, a small distance between the bends might be a reason, bending prisms without electronic angle measurement are applied. In that case the control unit can be switched from angular measurement to stroke measurement. This method allows the pre-selection of the stroke of the bending ram in mm and therefore the immersion depth of the punch into the prism. Setting accuracy is +/- 0.1 mm. A final stroke is usually not required. Further development of the stroke system enables the user to specify an angle from which the stroke is calculated by using stored stroke functions. Bending accuracy in that case is dependent on material properties such as thickness, hardness, etc. which may differ from one work piece to another. Programming and principle of operation Graphical user interface of a bending machine Programming is done on a PC equipped with dedicated software, which is part of the machine or connected to an external workstation. For generating a new program engineering data can be imported or pasted per mouse and keyboard. Through a graphic and menu-driven user interface previous CNC programming skills are not required. The software asks for all necessary values and checks all figures. Inputs can be corrected at any time and minimum distances are checked instantly to guard against improper inputs. The software automatically calculates the flat length of each part being bent and determines the exact position of the side stop. The part is shown on a screen. Ideally each program is stored in one database, so it is easy to recover them by search and sort functions. Networking with the whole production line Networking of CNC machines A lot of organizational effort and interface management is saved, if the CNC bending machine is connected to the previous and subsequent process. For a connection to other machines and external workstations corporate interfaces have to be established. * One software for programming subsequent production steps at once * Using a standard industrial PC a variety of machines can be easily networked with among each other * shared data base for easy integration into existing workflow system and backup at an external server * import production data from other systems or from construction programs (e.g. DXF files) Networking with a punching machine If a part is bended, in most cases a prior process was inserting holes to mount it in an assembly group. Therefore, a punching machine is an option. Some programs enable the operator to program both step by one software tool. See also * Bending * Numerical control References * M.

It solves the problem of executing a dynamically multithreaded computation, one that can \\"spawn\\" new threads of execution, on a statically multithreaded computer, with a fixed number of processors (or cores). It does so efficiently in terms of execution time, memory usage, and inter-processor communication. In a work stealing scheduler, each processor in a computer system has a queue of work items (computational tasks, threads) to perform. Each work item consists of a series of instructions, to be executed sequentially, but in the course of its execution, a work item may also spawn new work items that can feasibly be executed in parallel with its other work. These new items are initially put on the queue of the processor executing the work item. When a processor runs out of work, it looks at the queues of other processors and \\"steals\\" their work items. In effect, work stealing distributes the scheduling work over idle processors, and as long as all processors have work to do, no scheduling overhead occurs. Work stealing contrasts with work sharing, another popular scheduling approach for dynamic multithreading, where each work item is scheduled onto a processor when it is spawned. Compared to this approach, work stealing reduces the amount of process migration between processors, because no such migration occurs when all processors have work to do. The idea of work stealing goes back to the implementation of the Multilisp programming language and work on parallel functional programming languages in the 1980s. It is employed in the scheduler for the Cilk programming language, the Java fork/join framework, the .NET Task Parallel Library, and the Rust Tokio runtime. Execution model Work stealing is designed for a \\"strict\\" fork–join model of parallel computation, which means that a computation can be viewed as a directed acyclic graph with a single source (start of computation) and a single sink (end of computation). Each node in this graph represents either a fork or a join. Forks produce multiple logically parallel computations, variously called \\"threads\\" or \\"strands\\". Edges represent serial computation.In the original presentation, serial computations were represented as nodes as well, and a directed edge represented the relation \\"is followed by\\". As an example, consider the following trivial fork–join program in Cilk-like syntax: function f(a, b): c ← fork g(a) d ← h(b) join return c + d function g(a): return a × 2 function h(a): b ← fork g(a) c ← a + 1 join return b + c The function call gives rise to the following computation graph: fork–join computation. In the graph, when two edges leave a node, the computations represented by the edge labels are logically parallel: they may be performed either in parallel, or sequentially. The computation may only proceed past a join node when the computations represented by its incoming edges are complete. The work of a scheduler, now, is to assign the computations (edges) to processors in a way that makes the entire computation run to completion in the correct order (as constrained by the join nodes), preferably as fast as possible. Algorithm The randomized version of the work stealing algorithm presented by Blumofe and Leiserson maintains several threads of execution and schedules these onto P processors. Each of the processors has a double-ended queue (deque) of threads. Call the ends of the deque \\"top\\" and \\"bottom\\". Each processor that has a current thread to execute, executes the instructions in the thread one by one, until it encounters an instruction that causes one of four \\"special\\" behaviors: * A spawn instruction causes a new thread to be created. The current thread is placed at the bottom of the deque, and the processor starts executing the new thread. * A stalling instruction is one that temporarily halts execution of its thread. The processor pops a thread off the bottom of its deque and starts executing that thread. If its deque is empty, it starts work stealing, explained below. * An instruction may cause a thread to die. The behavior in this case is the same as for an instruction that stalls. * An instruction may enable another thread. The other thread is pushed onto the bottom of the deque, but the processor continues execution of its current thread. Initially, a computation consists of a single thread and is assigned to some processor, while the other processors start off idle. Any processor that becomes idle starts the actual process of work stealing, which means the following: * it picks another processor uniformly at random; * if the other processor's deque is non-empty, it pops the top-most thread off the deque and starts executing that; * else, repeat. Child stealing vs. continuation stealing Note that, in the rule for spawn, Blumofe and Leiserson suggest that the \\"parent\\" thread execute its new thread, as if performing a function call (in the C-like program , the function call to completes before the call to is performed). This is called \\"continuation stealing\\", because the continuation of the function can be stolen while the spawned thread is executed, and is the scheduling algorithm used in Cilk Plus. It is not the only way to implement work stealing; the alternative strategy is called \\"child stealing\\" and is easier to implement as a library, without compiler support. Child stealing is used by Threading Building Blocks, Microsoft's Task Parallel Library and OpenMP, although the latter gives the programmer control over which strategy is used. Efficiency Several variants of work stealing have been proposed. The randomized variant due to Blumofe and Leiserson executes a parallel computation in expected time T_1/P + O(T_\\\\infty) on P processors; here, T_1 is the work, or the amount of time required to run the computation on a serial computer, and T_\\\\infty is the span, the amount of time required on an infinitely parallel machine.See analysis of parallel algorithms for definitions. This means that, in expectation, the time required is at most a constant factor times the theoretical minimum. However, the running time (in particular, the number of steals executed) can be exponential in T_\\\\infty in the worst case. A localized variant, in which a processor attempts to steal back its own work whenever it is free, has also been analyzed theoretically and practically. Space usage A computation scheduled by the Blumofe–Leiserson version of work stealing uses O(S_1 P) stack space, if S_1 were the stack usage of the same computation on a single processor, fitting the authors' own earlier definition of space efficiency. This bound requires continuation stealing; in a child stealing scheduler, it does not hold, as can be seen from the following example: for i = 0 to n: fork f(i) join In a child- stealing implementation, all \\"forked\\" calls to are put in a work queue that thus grows to size , which can be made arbitrarily large. Multiprogramming variant The work stealing algorithm as outlined earlier, and its analysis, assume a computing environment where a computation is scheduled onto a set of dedicated processors. In a multiprogramming (multi-tasking) environment, the algorithm must be modified to instead schedule computation tasks onto a pool of worker threads, which in turn are scheduled onto the actual processors by an operating system scheduler. At any given time, the OS scheduler will assign to the work stealing process some number of the processors in the computer, because other processes may be using the remaining processors. In this setting, work stealing with a pool of worker threads has the problem that workers acting as thieves may cause livelock: they may block the execution of workers that would actually spawn useful tasks. A variant of work stealing has been devised for this situation, which executes a computation in expected time :O\\\\left(\\\\frac{T_1}{P_\\\\mathrm{avg}} + \\\\frac{T_\\\\infty P}{P_\\\\mathrm{avg}}\\\\right), where is the average number of processors allocated to the computation by the OS scheduler over the computation's running time. The multiprogramming work- scheduler differs from the traditional version in two respects: * Its queues are non-blocking. While on dedicated processors, access to the queues can be synchronized using locks, this is not advisable in a multiprogramming environment since the operating system might preempt the worker thread holding the lock, blocking the progress of any other workers that try to access the same queue. * Before each attempt to steal work, a worker thread calls a \\"\\" system call that yields the processor on which it is scheduled to the OS, in order to prevent starvation. Attempts to improve on the multiprogramming work stealer have focused on cache locality issues and improved queue data structures. Alternatives Several scheduling algorithms for dynamically multithreaded computations compete with work stealing. Besides the traditional work sharing approach, there is a scheduler called parallel depth-first (PDF) that improves on the space bounds of work stealing, as well giving better performance in some situations where the cores of a chip multiprocessor share a cache.

Marty Ross is an American singer, songwriter and guitarist who is best known for his role in the TV series the New Monkees, as a member of the power pop band The Wigs and as a singer in 2018 and 2019 and 2020 with the legendary west coast session players The Wrecking Crew. Biography Ross was born in Eugene, Oregon. His mother Margaret, born in England, was a folk singer, his father Gordon was a professor of history at Rockford College, now known as Rockford University. Ross became proficient at the tenor banjo by his 5th birthday and learned to play the guitar at 6 years old. He was influenced by his mother's folk harmonies and his Uncle Bob Fisher's (his mom's brother) sense of rock and roll. Fisher quit the band he was in to move from England to live with the Ross family in the late 1960s in Rockford, Illinois. The band he quit would go on to become the popular rock band Mott The Hoople. Ross was schooled in Rockford and during his father's sabbatical Ross went to high school in London, United Kingdom, Barcelona, Spain then returned to finish schooling in Rockford. It was in Spain that Ross learned flamenco guitar which eventually became part of his style of play. Following high school graduation, he enrolled at Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois majoring in music but before the end of his freshman year moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin to begin his music career. In Milwaukee he joined the power pop band The Wigs. The band’s album File Under Pop Vocal was a regional hit. He later auditioned for and was offered a part in the pop rock music group New Monkees and in the television series of the same name. Movies As a member of The Wigs, Ross appeared in the motion picture My Chauffeur and sang on camera the song \\"Fire!\\" which he wrote. Jim Cushinery of The Wigs wrote seven songs for the film making the band's contribution to the film a total of eight songs. The soundtrack to My Chauffeur was released in June 2013. Ross also performed a song for the film Murphy's Law, produced 3 songs and performed a cover of the Deep Purple classic \\"Hush\\" for the movie \\"Stateside\\" and the opening theme for Kounterfeit. Ross wrote and produced songs for the feature films \\"Mod Squad\\",\\"The Runner\\" and many others. He can also be heard singing in the Showtime movie \\"Noriega: Gods Favorite \\". Ross teamed with Randy Gerston to produce for the movie Blair Witch Project the single mix of \\" The Order Of Death\\" by Public Image Limited. Television Ross appeared in the 1987 syndicated musical situation comedy television series, New Monkees produced by Columbia Pictures Television. The producers selected him for one of the four leading roles after auditioning over 5,000 people.

The Palestine poster genre is more than a century old and growing. The Palestine Poster Project Archives continues to expand as the largest online collection of such posters. A majority of the works included in this archives are created by Palestinian artists, although the collection also features many works created by international, Zionist, and Israeli artists. More than 8,600 posters created by at least 1,750 artists are currently available on the Palestine Poster Project Archives’ website for public viewing. Background As a Peace Corps volunteer in Morocco during the 1970s, Dan Walsh began a lifelong hobby of collecting Palestinian posters, the majority of which dealt with the theme of nationalism. Walsh initially received support from Dr. Edward Said through the American Palestine Education Foundation to transform his hobby into a public archive. In the early 2000s, Walsh founded the Palestine Poster Project Archives, an online public database that is frequently updated. He continues to avidly collect, document, and archive Palestinian posters from across the world today. The Palestine Poster Project Archives was a key component of Walsh's thesis as a student in Georgetown University’s Master of Arts in Arab Studies program at the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies. This database was originally created for historians, educators, and advocates of public diplomacy. Definition The Palestine poster genre dates back to the late nineteenth century. The Palestine Poster Project Archives entails that a poster with any of the following elements can be classified as a \\"Palestine poster\\": * Any poster with the word \\"Palestine\\" in it, in any language, from any source or time period. * Any poster created or published by any artist or agency claiming Palestinian nationality or Palestinian participation. * Any poster published in the geographical territory of historic Palestine, at any point in history, including contemporary Israel. * Any poster published by any source that relates directly to the social, cultural, political, military or economic history of Palestine. * Any poster related to Zionism or anti-Zionism in any language, from any source, published after August 31, 1897. Historical context Some of the earliest posters produced about Palestine were made by tourist companies in the late nineteenth century. In the 1890s, Zionist groups started making posters encouraging Jewish groups to immigrate to historic Palestine and urging international support for a Jewish state. In 1897, at the First Zionist Congress in Switzerland, attendants decided to adopt poster production as a significant resource to communicate and disseminate information. Intense production of Zionist posters continued for about fifty years, after which it waned. When Palestinians experienced mass dislocation and exile in 1948, a series of events referred to as the 1948 Palestinian exodus, known in Arabic as al-Nakba (\\"the Catastrophe\\"), some prominent artists in Egypt, Syria, and other Arab countries began producing posters to convey support for a Palestinian state. According to Dan Walsh, founder of the Palestinian Poster Project Archives, as a result of the Battle of Karameh (Jordan) in 1968, the Palestine Liberation Organization began to more seriously consider the importance of international solidarity and information production and dissemination. The PLO supported a particular style of Palestinian visual arts, leading to the rise of pamphleteer art and nationalist paintings that employed iconic imagery, symbols, and slogans for the Palestinian struggle. The Palestinian poster was seen as an especially useful medium for generating solidarity, representing narratives, and even mediating internal disagreements in Palestinian society. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the production of Palestinian nationalist posters was prolific. Until the 1990s, there were few major professional institutions or gallery spaces available to display work in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Therefore, artists often hung their posters in schools, town halls, union offices, public libraries, and other shared public spaces. Artist Marc Rudin explained, \\"The posters had to be designed to be posted in the refugee camps, in its narrow alleys, in Palestinian homes. But they were also to be used for information campaigns abroad\\". Artists designed their posters to be aesthetically pleasing, meaningful, and in many cases, communicative for both the Palestinian public and an international audience. Many Palestinian nationalist posters were displayed not only in public spaces in Palestinian towns and cities, but also in major urban spaces and capital cities throughout the Arab world and Europe. Documentation of the Palestinian nationalist posters genre's evolution was fragmented, and at times violently interrupted, in the mid and late twentieth century. Ezzedin Kalak, the PLO's representative in France, was collecting hundreds of posters and postcards for a book about the significance of Palestinian posters when he was assassinated by the Israeli national intelligence agency (Mossad) in 1978. Kalak's project was never completed or published. Palestine poster artists continue to contribute works to the ever-growing genre today. The majority of posters displayed in the Palestine Poster Project Archives are originally printed on paper. From the 1960s to the mid-1990s, most Palestine posters were printed in a single location and then distributed worldwide. Increased internet access in the Arab world and globally, in tandem with rising costs for print production en masse, has led many Palestine poster artists to localize printing operations rather than utilize large and centralized printing companies. An increasing number of new Palestine posters are being created digitally and then printed and distributed locally. Organization of posters The PPPA works are organized under various subcategories to ease a user's search. The \\"Special Categories\\" include a section entitled \\"Artists and Collectives\\" where some of the most prolific artists' works are gathered. Other sections under \\"Special Categories\\" include \\"Exhibits and Catalogs;\\" \\"Historical Figures and Themes;\\" \\"Political, Cultural, and Social Publishers;\\" and \\"Museums, Libraries, Private Collections, Universities, and Archives.\\" The PPPA also has a section entitled \\"Iconography\\" under which 40 types of reoccurring imagery, symbols, and representation are categorized. Some of these categories include \\"woman/female,\\" \\"stone,\\" \\"Palestinian flag,\\" and \\"olives/trees/branches.\\" Artists According to Walsh, works featured in the Palestine Poster Project Archives can be divided into four major “wellsprings” or origins: Israeli and Zionist artists and agencies, Palestinian nationalist artists and agencies, Muslim and Arab artists and agencies, and international artists and agencies. Some artists featured in the Palestine Poster Project Archives are not Palestinian, Jewish, or Israeli by origin. The Palestine Poster Project Archives currently holds posters made by artists from more than 55 countries. For example, Marc Rudin, a Swiss-born artist with no Arab or Palestinian ancestry, worked as a graphic artist for the PLO between 1980 and 1991. During that time, he went by the pseudonym Jihad Mansour. Rudin produced nearly 200 posters about Palestine and worked most closely with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in Syria, Lebanon, and the West Bank. Some Palestinian poster artists are Arab by descent, but not Palestinian. For instance, artist Burhan Karkoutly was Syrian by birth and created numerous posters for the PLO during the 1970s. Due to his commitment to and understanding of the Palestinian cause, Karkoutly was considered as one of the leading “Palestinian artists” of his era. Uses Dan Walsh, the founder of the Palestine Poster Project Archives, originally envisioned that the archive would be useful for American high school educators teaching the history of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The archives could be incorporated into curricula for visual anthropology, art history, media studies, graphic design, and a variety of other subjects. Dan Walsh said in an interview with Al-Akhbar English: \\"There are two narratives presented at my website, the Palestinian nationalist and the political Zionist, and they've never been put together like this before.\\" The Palestine Poster Project Archives provides some context about the production of each poster, which typically includes the date that it was printed, the organization for which it was commissioned, and the artist's name. Sometimes information about the poster's dimensions (size) and medium are also included. Many of the posters with Arabic and Hebrew text have been translated into English. Presentations In June 2012, the Palestinian American Research Center (PARC) sponsored Dan Walsh to present the Palestine Poster Project Archives in cities across the West Bank. This was the first time that the Palestine Poster Project Archives was formally presented in Palestine, although Walsh has made several media appearances and delivered lectures to promote the PPPA at various locations in the United States.

While the MOOC concept is already quite popular in academia, SAP is one of the first companies to build a platform dedicated to MOOCs and adopt it for business-related training purposes. Compared to traditional e-learning formats, openSAP courses return to tried and trusted classroom concepts and transfer them to an online medium in the following way: * Courses have a defined duration (typically six weeks) to which students need to adhere * Courses are based on lectures (delivery through video), supporting material (slide decks, handouts), and self-tests. * Students need to submit homework on a weekly basis and adhere to deadlines. The homework is graded and contributes to the points required to receive a record of achievement. * Students can discuss the course content in an online forum. * Courses end with a final exam. * Some courses include peer assessments where learners can submit their work for review by their peers and content experts. This helps the learner to develop their ideas with feedback - just like in a classroom setting. The average duration of the video lectures is 90 minutes per week. Combined with additional self-study and homework, the average effort required to complete an openSAP course successfully is four to six hours per week. This makes it easy for students to combine courses with their other responsibilities. The first openSAP course The first openSAP course was held from May 27 through July 15, 2013. * 18,033 learners were enrolled on day 1 of the course. * When the final exam ended, this number had increased to 40,386. * 15,748 learners actively participated in the course. * 10,795 learners took the final exam. * 9,383 graded records of achievement were distributed.

Plot Ringo, a bounty hunter, has killed the father of Glenn Garvin (Glenn Saxson) to collect a bounty. Glenn kills Ringo and then takes his father's body to town to collect the bounty himself. There he befriends Gordon (Fernando Sancho in city clothes and a bowler hat instead of his usual Mexican bandit outfit), who tells Glenn that he stands to inherit half of everything in town, which his father had owned in partnership with Ken Cluster. Cluster's henchman Ward and his men try and fail to kill Glenn, so Cluster robs his own bank and frames Glenn for murder. Glenn escapes and is taken in by Cluster's wife, Jessica, who wants Glenn to kill her husband. However, it turns out that Jessica is also married to a stranger, Doc (Alberto Lupo), who had helped Glenn earlier. Jessica escapes to Ward, whom she convinces that Cluster wants him to stash the bank robbery loot in Mexico, in her name. Glenn, Doc, and Gordon ambush the convoy and kill Ward, while Jessica is arrested for the robbery, on the testimony of Cluster. Cluster and Glenn sign an agreement and there is a celebration. Doc leaves and liberates Jessica. She takes his gun and leaves with the money, despite Doc's warning that Cluster will kill her outside. The gun turns out to be unloaded, and Cluster fatally stabs her. Gordon and Glenn start a saloon brawl and sneak out unnoticed. At the cemetery, Glenn and Doc find Cluster. Glenn – who earlier, even before the partnership, learned that his father was framed and that Ringo was tracking him at Cluster's request – is offered part of the loot but chooses to avenge his father instead. He shoots Cluster's gun out of his hand and kills him when he draws a knife. He buries the corpse in the grave of Glenn's father. Glenn makes apologies to his father and posts a reward for Cluster, just as the latter had done for his father. Doc, Gordon, and Glenn leave, but the latter two decide to return when they discover that the gold in the saddlebag has been replaced with a note from the saloon girl Lucy, who Glenn had been reluctant to leave behind anyway. In the final scene we see Glenn, Gordon, and Lucy running the bank when Cluster's son appears to claim his half of the gold.

Reception From a contemporary reviews, John Raisbeck reviewed a 95 minute dubbed language version of the film in the Monthly Film Bulletin. Raisbeck found the film to be a \\"lifeless Italian Western\\" which \\"plods wearily through the required rituals, drawing ineffectually on the work of Leone: the black-caped stranger, Doc, is clearly a first cousin to the van Cleef character in the Dollar films, and the final shoot-out takes place, conveniently and derivatively, in a cemetery.\\" In his investigation of narrative structures in Spaghetti Western films, Bert Fridlund argues that Django Shoots First presents a complicated rendition of the partnership plot that was used in many Spaghetti Westerns following the success of For a Few Dollars More, where one of the bounty killer partners turns out to have a secret vengeance motive. Glenn is the protagonist who has a double motive. During the major part of the narrative, his inheritance is his primary concern, but eventually he manages to get his vengeance as well. Doc is the partner with a hidden motive – not concerning the malefactor Cluster, but getting back or punishing his bigamist wife. Their opposition, the Clusters, betray each other for money. Finally, Lucy betrays Glenn, stealing his money to secure his love.

First analysis of multiple paternity in an oviparous shark, the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula L.). The Journal of heredity 103, 166–73 (2012). Examples Poeciliids are freshwater live-bearing fish and internal fertilizers that are able to store sperm for months, setting the stage for sperm competition and allowing female cryptic sperm choice. These Poeciliid species include green swordtails, Xiphophorus helleri and Trinidadian guppies, Poecilia reticulata. When females mate promiscuously and copulate with multiple males, the interests of the sexes may differ, leading to sexual conflict. These conflicts include mating and fertilization frequency, parental efforts, and power struggles between male and female dominance.Zeh, J. A. & Zeh, D. W. Current Issues – Perspectives and Reviews. Toward a new sexual selection paradigm: polyandry, conflict, and incompatibility. Conflict 950, 929–950 (2003). The Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata has a resource-free mating system, meaning males do not provide during mating or defend their territories against other males.Evans, J. P. & Magurran, a E. Multiple benefits of multiple mating in guppies. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 97, 10074–6 (2000). Guppies demonstrate one of the highest levels of female multiple mating in the fish species. Females tend to copulate with multiple males to ensure that males with strongly competitive sperm have increased paternity rates.Evans, J. P. & Gasparini, C. The genetic basis of female multiple mating in a polyandrous livebearing fish. Ecology and evolution 3, 61–6 (2012). Females who engage in polyandry obtain certain advantages such as shorter gestation times, larger broods, and the production of offspring with better phenotypes and abilities. Females prefer phenotypically bright colored males that are usually orange, red, yellow, or blue. Male offspring from polyandrous mating tend to be more colorful than offspring from monogamous mating, which contain more black spots rather than multiple colors. Brightly colored males tend to display stronger sigmoidal displays, correlating sperm production rate with courtship intensity and body size. Offspring were more phenotypically diverse than their parents, suggesting a diversified selection that allows offspring to cope better with the environment and have variability in mating. However, there are also costs associated with polyandry. Placental fish Heterandria formosa offspring from females who mate with multiple males, have a longer maturation time, leading to potentially higher levels of fatality in slower developing offspring.Ala-Honkola, O., Friman, E. & Lindström, K. Costs and benefits of polyandry in a placental poeciliid fish Heterandria formosa are in accordance with the parent-offspring conflict theory of placentation. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 24, 2600–10 (2011). Classical polyandry Classical polyandry occurs when the evolution of sex role reversal has occurred and a female copulates with multiple males.Andersson, M. Current Issues – Perspectives and Reviews. Evolution of classical polyandry: three steps to female emancipation. Ethology 23, 1–24 (2005). These males raise their own progeny without any help from females. This mating system is hypothesized to occur in three steps. The first step, which is an important prerequisite step in classical polyandry, involves the evolution of male care for eggs. In the second step, females have the ability to produce more clutches than a male can handle, leading to an increase in female fecundity because these females need to find other males to mate with for the remaining eggs they produced. The third step occurs as females compete to lay a clutch into a nest for the next male while the original male is caring for the initial clutch. More successful females tend to produce greater amounts of offspring. Male pregnancy is a common feature in the family Syngnathidae, which includes pipefish, seahorses, and sea dragons.Jones, a G., Walker, D. & Avise, J. C. Genetic evidence for extreme polyandry and extraordinary sex-role reversal in a pipefish. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 268, 2531–5 (2001). This type of polyandry has been demonstrated by analyzing the genetic composition of Gulf pipefish, Sygnathus scovelli and straightnose pipefish, Nerophis ophidion, which shows that males only mate once during their pregnancy, whereas females mate multiple times. This extreme form of polyandry indicates that this species has a much stronger intensity of sexual selection on females than on males, in which females tend to be larger and more adorned than males. Evidence for stronger sexual selection in females in Gulf pipefish, Syngnathus scovelli, include having secondary sexual characteristics, such as longer abdomens and stripes that are not found in males. Males are usually capable of combining uniparental care with defending their territories or nest, attracting females for copulation. Some species of male pipefish have a fully or partially enclosed pouch where females deposit eggs. Males then fertilize and carry the offspring in or on his body until the offspring hatch. The pipefish species, Syngnathus typhle males can only carry approximately half of the brood produced by a larger female. This male limitation allows females to increase their fitness by developing eggs for multiple males. These females can then mate with multiple males, which leads to increased female fecundity and supports the second step of the evolution of classical polyandry. Cooperative polyandry Cooperative polyandry occurs when inferior males potentially share paternity and offspring care with a dominant male.Kohda, M. et al. Living on the wedge: female control of paternity in a cooperatively polyandrous cichlid. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 276, 4207–14 (2009). This type of polyandry occurs in eight fish species, including cichlids. Females can potentially direct the paternity of dominant, or alpha males and subordinate, or beta males by techniques such as cryptic female choice and sneaky copulation with subordinate males. Although dominant males potentially provide alleles which code for superior phenotypic traits, females also choose to mate with subordinate males because they provide more brood care than the larger dominant males. Subordinate males, or nest-helpers, can gain benefits from protecting the clutch such as food, protection, and successful paternity. Multiple explanations have been hypothesized to explain the evolution of cooperative polyandry.Wong, M. & Balshine, S. The evolution of cooperative breeding in the African cichlid fish, Neolamprologus pulcher. Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society 86, 511–30 (2011). These hypotheses include kin selection, pay-to-stay, signals of prestige, and group augmentation. Kin selection occurs when individuals help their offspring to increase their inclusive fitness, which includes aid in defending their territory and being related to females. Evidence suggests that helpers in the cichlid species, Neolamprologus pulcher, tend to have preferential treatment for their kin over other males’ kin. Pay-to-stay occurs when beta males help alpha males and females in order to be allowed to stay in the nesting site.Balshine-Earn, S., Neat, F. C., Reid, H. & Taborsky, M. Paying to stay or paying to breed? Field evidence for direct benefits of helping behavior in a cooperatively breeding fish. Behavioral Ecology 9, 432–438 (1998). Also, beta males will continue to help the nest even when a new alpha male takes over the site to avoid being evicted. However, this hypothesis has not yet been supported due to a lack of observation regarding alpha males punishing beta males for not caring for the offspring. Signals of prestige include higher quality males being able to demonstrate stronger advertising techniques than lower quality males to increase their paternity rate. However, there is currently very little evidence supporting this hypothesis, especially in cichlids, where size has been found to determine the hierarchies. The group augmentation hypothesis states that cooperative mating systems are favored when it enhances group size and reproductive fitness. More research still needs to be conducted to determine whether or not group augmentation is beneficial in cooperative mating systems. Cooperative polyandry occurs in the cichlid species, Chalinochromis brichardi and Julidochromis transcriptus from Lake Tanganyika and the Neolamprologus pulcher. The cooperatively breeding cichlids tend to exhibit a size order of the alpha male being the largest, followed by the female, and the beta males being the smallest of the group. However, in some cases, females can be the largest, followed by the alpha male, and then beta males. Females can use their body size and wedge-shaped crests as copulation sites to direct male paternity when both alpha and beta males are present. Larger females have the ability to dominate all males and can choose which males to mate with externally. Smaller females are usually dominated by the alpha male, which can sometimes lead to a monogamous mating system between the alpha male and female. Sexual conflict occurs when females choose to mate with beta males over the alpha male because the alpha male's paternity is lowered. The subordinate males can conceal themselves from the dominant male inside the crevices to avoid conflict with the alpha male. Females can spawn eggs in deeper crests, allowing beta males to fertilize some of the clutch without being harassed by the alpha male. However, when only one type of male was present, females did not choose to mate in wedge-shaped crevices. This demonstrates that females might use the crevices as a strategy to attract both alpha and beta males to the nest. Females can induce the paternity allotment of her potential mates by choosing where she deposits her eggs within her nesting site. Female brood location choice can intercede the effects of sexual conflict over group membership because it allows multiple males to protect each clutch, rather than having these males compete for their own clutch to mate with females. Even though some cichlid species display cooperative polyandry in crevices, other cichlid species are mouth brooders, where females carry eggs in their mouths that have been fertilized by multiple males. Typically, a maximum of six males can fertilize a single clutch of cichlid offspring. Convenience polyandry Convenience polyandry occurs when females mate with multiple males to avoid to coercive breeding harassment from these males. This type of polyandry was found throughout a variety of elasmobranch fish, or cartilaginous fish, such as sharks.Veríssimo, A., Grubbs, D., McDowell, J., Musick, J. & Portnoy, D. Frequency of multiple paternity in the spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias in the western north Atlantic. The Journal of heredity 102, 88–93 (2011). These sharks included lemon sharks,DiBattista, J.

Isolation and characterization of five dinucleotide microsatellite loci in the sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus. Molecular Ecology Notes 6, 431–433 (2006). nurse sharksPratt, H. L. & Carrier, J. C. A review of elasmobranch reproductive behavior with a case study on the nurse shark , Ginglymostoma cirratum. 157–188 (2001). and catsharks. For convenience polyandry to occur, the costs of females resisting males must outweigh the costs of mating. Females tend to get injured by males during copulation because males bite onto their pectoral fins and bodies while mating.Feldheim, K. A., Gruber, S. H., Ashley, M. V & Url, S. Reconstruction of Parental Microsatellite Genotypes Reveals Female Polyandry and Philopatry in the Lemon Shark , Negaprion brevirostris . 58, 2332–2342 (2013). Females can also receive cloacal injuries caused by the male's sexual organ. Strong evidence for female indirect benefits has not yet been determined, suggesting one reason for convenience polyandry. Since there do not seem to be any direct benefits for females, polyandry could be driven for male benefits. Males can force females into multiple mating to maximize their reproductive success. In addition to being a form of coercive breeding, males usually work together in cooperative breeding to force females to mate with them. Sexual dimorphism in mouth and dental morphology has been shown in males. These males develop long, narrow mouths and longer teeth that aid in biting female pectoral fins during mating. Some shark species, such as catsharks, Scyliorbinus carnicula, exhibit a different form of convenience polyandry. These sharks fertilize internally, but then lay their fertilized eggs onto algae or rocky surfaces. Catsharks tend to have a prolonged mating season, allowing females to store sperm and lay eggs hundreds of days after copulation from multiple males, displaying a high frequency of multiple paternity within a single clutch. Several viviparous shark species, where females give birth to live offspring that develop internally within the mother, also engage in polyandry. In viviparous mating, a direct transfer of nutrients from mother to embryo through a yolk sac placenta occurs.Feldheim, K. a, Gruber, S. H. & Ashley, M. V The breeding biology of lemon sharks at a tropical nursery lagoon. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 269, 1655–61 (2002). Litters sired by multiple fathers have been determined in lemon sharks, Negaprion brevirostris, nurse sharks, Ginlymostoma cirratum, sandbar sharks, Carcharhinus plumbeus, and squaloid sharks, such as spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias. Some male sharks can also mate multiple times with these females, which is referred to as a polygynandry mating system. Overall, polyandry is the dominant mating system in lemon sharks and sandbar sharks. However, geography can play a role in mating systems. For example, western north Atlantic sandbar sharks exhibit polyandry as the dominant mating system whereas in the Central Pacific, sandbar sharks do not have a dominant polyandry mating system. In addition to polyandry, lemon sharks are one of the shark species that engage in philopatry, or the practice of females returning to sites where they have given birth to previous offspring.DiBattista, J. D., Feldheim, K. a, Thibert-Plante, X., Gruber, S. H. & Hendry, A. P. A genetic assessment of polyandry and breeding-site fidelity in lemon sharks. Molecular ecology 17, 3337–51 (2008). Females were found to have stronger loyalties to philopatry than males. These sharks gather together at specific mating sites, allowing females to mate with multiple males in one area. Selecting specific nursery sites influence adult fitness, recruitment, and provide a protected area for live offspring to develop. However, one consequence that may arise is increased levels of inbreeding within the nursing sites. Another consequence includes coercive mating by males, which can force females into polyandrous mating even if they do not receive any benefits from this mating system. Copulation requires a substantial amount of energy and females that mate with multiple males causes a negative effect on their overall fitness. Female lemon sharks give birth to four to eighteen pups every two years. This two-year reproductive cycle usually occurs in lemon sharks, sandbar sharks, and nurse sharks. One hypothesis states that females can engage in polyandry to find genetically dissimilar and therefore compatible males to produce high quality offspring. However, no concrete evidence has been found to strongly support this hypothesis. Further research needs to be conducted to determine whether any direct or indirect benefits exist for elasmobranch sharks.

Frederick VI. By Wilhelm Bendz (1830) The Throne Chair of Denmark (Danish and ; also: salvingsstol, kroningsstol) is the physical representation of the Throne of the Kingdom of Denmark (since 1671) and of the Throne of the Kingdom of Norway (between 1671 and 1814). According to legend, the Throne Chair is made of the horn of unicorns. In reality, it is made from Norwegian narwhal tusks. It is guarded by three life-size silver lions, based on Biblical references, and was a symbol of the absolute monarchy of the Twin Kingdoms. The Throne Chair is located in the Castle of Rosenborg in Copenhagen.  History  King Christian VIII, by Joseph-Désiré Court (1841)  Throne Chair  Following the 1660 introduction of absolute monarchy in Denmark and Norway, King Frederick III (r. 1648-1670) ordered a throne chair to be created. The Throne Chair was made between 1662 and 1671 by Bendix Grodtschilling.The Danish Royal Collections: Coronation chair, King During the reign of King Christian V (r. 1670-1699), gilt figures were added to the chair. Both the Throne Chair and the silver lions were inspired by the Biblical Throne of King Solomon, which was guarded by twelve lions, as described in I Kings 10: The Throne Chair was used at coronations between 1671 and 1840. When absolute monarchy was replaced by constitutional monarchy in 1849, kings were no longer crowned or anointed, whereupon the Throne Chair lost its practical function. Even though Norway was formally an independent realm with its own throne, Denmark's Throne Chair was de facto also Norway's until 1814.  Lions  The Throne Chair is guarded by three lions of silver. They are the same size as natural lions, and each weighs 130 kilos. Their eyes, manes, and rumps are covered with pure gold. They were made between 1665 and 1670 by Ferdinand Kübich.The Danish Royal Collections: Silver lions On 20 November 1905, when delegates of the Norwegian parliament entered the Christian VII Palace in Copenhagen in order to offer the throne of Norway to Prince Carl, they were met--and stopped--by the lions. This moment was immortalized by photographer Peter Elfelt. Based on Elfelt's photograph, painter Paul Fischer made a famous painting. Several versions of this painting have existed, and one is included in the art collections in the Castle of Oslo.The delegates of the Norwegian parliament in 1905, The Museum of National History at Frederiksborg Palace The silver lions are still used outside Rosenborg, mainly when protecting the castrum doloris of kings.

Contents The Gothic Earth Gazetteer provides background and adventure ideas for Masque of the Red Death players by providing a timeline, along with information on important events, people, and qabals, for the period of 1890–1899. Following the timeline is a closer examination of the events of the Spanish–American War. Some events are dealt with in detail, including the Dreyfus Affair and the murder of the Sioux at Wounded Knee, and the history is accompanied by proposed supernatural explanations. The biographical section employs a similar approach, with some of the notable people of the period given fictional enhancements (artist Paul Cézanne is blessed with a \\"spiritual parasite\\", for example), and the section includes a few fictional characters such as Sherlock Holmes. The accessory finishes with accounts of the more significant qabals. The accessory is bound in a color poster calendar. Publication history The Gothic Earth Gazetteer was designed by William W. Connors, and published by TSR in 1995. The cover artist was Robh Ruppel, with interior art courtesy of and used with permission of Dover Publications, Inc. Reception Cliff Ramshaw reviewed The Gothic Earth Gazetteer for Arcane magazine, rating it a 5 out of 10 overall. Ramshaw called the accessory \\"something very much like a history book, but with make-believe bits thrown in for good measure\\". He commented that the timeline \\"makes for interesting reading and is, dare I say it, educational, despite its peculiar emphasis on American baseball achievements\\". He felt that the Spanish–American War description would give referees plenty of ideas for espionage adventures, despite no overt hints given. He considered the accounts of the significant qabals \\"lacklustre\\". Ramshaw concluded by saying: \\"The Gazetteer is nicely presented and quite intriguing, but you're likely to unearth much more in the way of atmosphere and ideas by reading a few history books and period novels.\\" References Category:1995 books Category:Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks Category:Ravenloft ","title":"The Gothic Earth Gazetteer"},{"id":"39335765","text":"The following is a timeline of the history of the city of Mombasa, Coast Province, Kenya. 14th-18th centuries Mombaza, 16th century * 1331 - Ibn Battuta, a Moroccan traveler, visits Mombasa.Ibn Battuta, \\"The Journeys of Ibn Battuta * 1498 - 8 April: Vasco da Gama anchors in port. * 1505 - Town sacked by Portuguese forces of Francisco de Almeida. * 1507 - Mandhry Mosque built. * 1528 - Town sacked by Portuguese forces of Nuno da Cunha. * 1529 - Portuguese in power. * 1588 - Town captured by Amir Ali Bey. * 1593 - Town under rule of Malindi. * 1594 - Fort Jesus built by Portuguese. * 1597 - Augustinian mission initiated. * 1631 - Portuguese \\"expelled.\\" The sultan of Mombasa, christened Dom Jerónimo Chingulia, assassinated the Portuguese governor, reclaimed his Muslim name of Yusuf ibn al-Hasan, and ordered all Christians in the city to convert to Islam. * 1632 - Town besieged by Portuguese forces. * 1661 - Town sacked by Omani forces. * 1696 - Siege of Fort Jesus by Omani forces. * 1698 - Sultanate of Oman in power. * 1734 - Mazrui in power. 19th century * 1837 - Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman in power. * 1885 - Hinduism in Africa Formation of the Hindu Union, and creation of Lord Shiva Temple (Shivaalay) in Central Mombasa. * 1887 - Mombasa \\"leased to the British East Africa Company;\\" town becomes capital of British East Africa Protectorate. * 1895 - Government Press established. * 1896 **Kilindini Harbour inaugurated. ** National Bank of India branch and Mombasa Club established. * 1897 - Population on island: 15,000-20,000 (estimate). * 1899 - Post office built. 20th century * 1901 ** Uganda Railway (Kisumu-Mombasa) begins operating. ** African Standard newspaper begins publication. ** Jevanjee mosque built. * 1902 - Court of Kenya established. * 1903 - Seif Bin Salim public library founded. * 1904 - Africa Hotel in business. * 1905 ** Mombasa Cathedral opens. ** Court of Kenya relocated from Mombasa to Nairobi. * 1907 - Slavery abolished. * 1920 - Town becomes part of British Protectorate of Kenya. * 1927 - Kenya Daily Mail newspaper begins publication. * 1931 - Nyali Bridge built. * 1944 - Aga Khan Hospital, Mombasa established. * 1949 - Anant Bhatt LLP Accounting, Audit, and Taxation firm established. * 1951 - Mombasa Institute of Muslim Education opens. * 1955 - Roman Catholic Diocese of Mombasa and Zanzibar established. * 1958 - Oceanic Hotel built. * 1962 - Population: 179,575 urban agglomeration. *1962 - 1963 David Kayanda becomes the first African Mayor of Mombasa. ** Msanifu Kombo becomes mayor. ** Town becomes part of Republic of Kenya. * 1973 ** 27 April: MV Globe Star ship runs aground near Mombasa. ** Population: 301,000 urban agglomeration. * 1979 - Moi International Airport expanded. * 1980 - New Nyali Bridge built. * 1981 ** Mombasa Records Centre of the Kenya National Archives established. ** Sister city relationship established with Seattle, US. * 1984 - New Burhani Mosque built. * 1985 - Mombasa Marathon begins. * 1986 - Marine Park established. * 1990 - Population: 476,000 (urban agglomeration). * 1998 - Najib Balala becomes mayor. * 1999 ** Mombasa Republican Council formed. ** Coast Gymkhana Club Ground in use. * 2000 - Population: 687,000 (urban agglomeration). 21st century * 2002 - 28 November: 2002 Mombasa attacks. * 2003 - Aga Khan Academy, Mombasa established in Kilindini. * 2005 - Population: 830,000 (urban agglomeration). * 2007 - Mombasa Polytechnic University College established. * 2009 ** Ahmed Mohdhar elected mayor. ** Population: 523,183. * 2010 - Population: 905,627 (estimate). * 2012 ** 15 May: Grenade attack in Bella Vista nightclub. ** 27 August: Cleric Aboud Rogo killed; unrest ensues. * 2013 ** October: Cleric Sheikh Ibrahim killed; unrest ensues. ** Mombasa polytechnic university college was promoted to a fully developed university now known as Technical University Of Mombasa. * 2017 - Mombasa–Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway begins operating.

Between 2013 and 2015, he served as the Communist Party Secretary and the top official of Hebei Province. Prior to his post in Hebei, Zhou Benshun was the Secretary- General of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, serving under disgraced domestic security chief Zhou Yongkang. On July 24, 2015, he was detained for investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, then expelled from the party several months later. Zhou was the first incumbent provincial party secretary to be targeted by the Chinese government's anti-graft campaign since 2012. Career Zhou Benshun was born in 1953 in Xupu County, Hunan province. He joined the Communist Party of China in September 1971. From 1972 to 1975 Zhou attended Changchun Institute of Geology (now part of Jilin University) in Jilin province. After finishing university in December 1975, he taught at the Hunan School of Geology until 1985. In January 1985, Zhou Benshun began working at the Policy Research Office of Hunan province, becoming its director in 1994. At the end of 1994 he was appointed Deputy Communist Party Chief of the prefecture-level city of Shaoyang, Hunan, rising to Party Chief the following year. From 2000 to 2003 he was the Director of Public Security of Hunan province, i.e., the provincial police chief. A year later, Zhou entered the Hunan provincial Party Standing Committee as the head of the provincial Political and Legal Affairs Commission (Zhengfawei). In November 2003 Zhou was transferred to the central government in Beijing to become the Deputy Secretary General of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, working under Secretary General Wang Shengjun. In March 2008, Wang was promoted to President of the Supreme Court, and Zhou succeeded Wang as Secretary General. For the next five years Zhou Benshun worked essentially as chief of staff to Zhou Yongkang (no relation), one of China's top leader (a member of the Politburo Standing Committee) who was then the head of the Commission. During his Zhengfawei stint, Zhou served in a series of other roles, including leading the office of Xinjiang affairs, and deputy director of the Central Public Security Comprehensive Management Commission; he was seen as one of the leading figures of the Zhengfawei world and a trusted lieutenant of Zhou Yongkang. In 2012, the son of Ling Jihua crashed in a Ferrari on one of Beijing's ring roads, unleashing highly unanticipated political consequences. Some overseas Chinese media reported that Zhou Benshun was dispatched to handle the fallout from the crash. In March 2013, Zhou Benshun was appointed the party chief of Hebei province, replacing Zhang Qingli, who became Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He was a member of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Investigation As Zhou Benshun has been associated with Zhou Yongkang for much of his career, rumours swirled about Zhou Benshun's fate since the senior Zhou was investigated for corruption in 2014. Zhou reportedly became meek and low-profile, and deferred many decisions to Zhang Qingwei, governor of Hebei and his deputy, even for routine matters such as making closing statements at meetings. Xi Jinping visited the Hebei party leadership in September 2013 to personally oversee a democratic life meeting where senior officials criticized each other and engaged in self-criticism. Footage of the event was shown on national television. That Xi would himself preside over a provincial-level meeting, put immense pressure on Zhou. At the September 2013 \\"life meeting\\", Zhou was criticized by his colleagues as lacking in competence, and as \\"too tolerant, too soft.\\" Over a year later, in December 2014, the Hebei party committee again held a democratic life meeting, in which Zhou lamented his own inability to realize the goals of the anti-corruption campaign in Hebei province, because he was afraid of upsetting the balance of organizations he oversaw. Fellow provincial standing committee member Jing Chunhua commented, \\"comrade Benshun needs to practice more democracy when making policy decisions.\\" Liang Bin said that \\"comrade Benshun needs to pay more attention to issues concerning officials.\\" Jing Chunhua and Liang Bin both eventually fell under the axe of the anti-corruption campaign. On July 24, 2015, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Communist Party's top anti- corruption body, placed Zhou under investigation. Zhou was the first sitting provincial party leader to be placed under investigation since the anti- corruption campaign began after the 18th Party Congress. Earlier that day, Zhou attended a Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integration conference hosted by Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli; he was detained shortly after the meeting ended. Zhou's downfall was extremely abrupt. Several days earlier Zhou had visited Beidaihe District, ostensibly to make preparations for the annual Beidaihe Conference of top Communist leaders. Zhou's downfall was a significant political event; prior to Zhou, the removal of provincial-level party chiefs had only happened three times in post-Cultural Revolution history: Beijing party chief Chen Xitong in 1995, Shanghai party chief Chen Liangyu in 2006, and Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai in 2012. Former Hebei party chief Cheng Weigao (term 1993-1998) had also been disgraced, but not during his term as party chief. On October 16, 2015, Zhou was expelled from the Communist Party. The investigation concluded that Zhou had voiced opinions contrary to the spirit of the policies of the party center, frequented private clubs, accepted bribes and leaked state secrets. On February 15, 2017, Zhou was sentenced on 15 years in prison for taking bribes worth 40.01 million yuan (~$5.83 million) by the Intermediate People's Court in Xiamen. Political views Zhou is known for his hard-line political views, generally expressing views that the law must seen primarily as a means to keep society in order rather than as a means for citizens to seek fairness and justice. In a 2011 article published in Qiushi, Zhou described the concept of civil society as a \\"trap\\" being sold by Western countries. Zhou also said that China would never adopt \\"separation of powers\\". He said that the law must achieve a mix of \\"legal, social, and political results.\\" References Category:Living people Category:1953 births Category:Communist Party of China politicians from Hunan Category:People's Republic of China politicians from Hunan Category:Political office-holders in Hebei Category:Political office-holders in Hunan Category:Politicians from Huaihua Category:Jilin University alumni Category:Wuhan University alumni Category:Hunan University alumni Category:Expelled members of the Chinese Communist Party Category:Chinese police officers Category:Chinese politicians convicted of corruption ","title":"Zhou Benshun"},{"id":"39335933","text":"Abrosimovo () is the name of several rural localities in Russia: *Abrosimovo, Kostroma Oblast, a settlement in Mikhalevskoye Settlement of Neysky District in Kostroma Oblast; *Abrosimovo, Mari El Republic, a village in Vasilyevsky Rural Okrug of Yurinsky District in the Mari El Republic; *Abrosimovo, Oryol Oblast, a village in Abolmasovsky Selsoviet of Khotynetsky District in Oryol Oblast *Abrosimovo, Pskov Oblast, a village in Opochetsky District of Pskov Oblast *Abrosimovo, Andreapolsky District, Tver Oblast, a village in Aksenovskoye Rural Settlement of Andreapolsky District in Tver Oblast *Abrosimovo, Kimrsky District, Tver Oblast, a village in Ustinovskoye Rural Settlement of Kimrsky District in Tver Oblast *Abrosimovo, Vesyegonsky District, Tver Oblast, a village in Kesemskoye Rural Settlement of Vesyegonsky District in Tver Oblast *Abrosimovo, Kameshkovsky District, Vladimir Oblast, a village in Kameshkovsky District of Vladimir Oblast *Abrosimovo, Vyaznikovsky District, Vladimir Oblast, a village in Vyaznikovsky District of Vladimir Oblast *Abrosimovo, Voronezh Oblast, a selo in Dyachenkovskoye Rural Settlement of Bogucharsky District in Voronezh Oblast See also *Abrosimov, Russian last name ","title":"Abrosimovo"},{"id":"39335968","text":"The 1994 Italy rugby union tour of Australia was a series of matches played in June 1994 in Australia by Italy national rugby union team.

It was developed by Techland and published by Ubisoft. Mad Riders was released in 2012. The game received mixed reviews upon its release, with critics praising the game's visuals but taking issue with its physics and controls. Gameplay Mad Riders is off-road racing video game. Players control an all terrain vehicle (ATV) and race other ATVs around a series of tracks. Players can collect coins placed along the tracks in order to activate a short boost in speed and blue tokens that allow players to temporarily access shortcuts. After launching off of ramps, players can perform tricks, which also give players the ability to activate a short boost in speed. Obstacles are placed both on the ground and in the air, and players have the ability to steer their ATV while airborne. The game features 45 tracks that can be played over five different race modes, including a time trial mode and a mode where players try to score as many points as possible by performing stunts. Races can be done either individually or as part of longer tournaments. Players are given experience points for both completing races and for performing stunts, which is used to unlock new vehicles and color schemes. The game also has a multiplayer option with races containing up to twelve players. Players can join multiplayer races that are about to begin directly from single player races that they are currently in. Reception Mad Riders received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Critics drew comparisons between Mad Riders and Techland's previous off-road racing game, Nail'd, with some reviews praising Mad Riders as an improvement over Nail'd. PlayStation Official Magazine – UK commented that \\"On the surface, it’s reminiscent of 2010 game Nail’d, but far superior\\", while Official Xbox Magazine UK called the game \\"structured far more intelligently than its full-priced predecessor\\". Mad Riderss visuals were largely praised. Sean Evans, writing for GameSpot, praised the game's cel shading as working well with the game's terrain and bringing an \\"appealing look that adds some much-needed personality\\". McKinley Noble of EGMNow, however, pointed out that while the courses are \\"beautiful- looking\\", boosting \\"obscures your vision and makes it harder to point out landmarks\\". Critics were much less positive about the game's gameplay itself, taking issue with the physics engine and controls. Official Xbox Magazine commented that the handling \\"feels more like socks on a waxed floor than wheels on dirt\\", while OXM UK and EGMNow both called it \\"floaty\\". Critics also took issue with the game's propensity to respawn players (move players back to an earlier point on the map) if they veered even slightly off of the course. The critics also criticized the game for a lack of originality.

He was also the owner of Salford Red Devils rugby league club until 2018. A 2018 Channel 4 documentary programme, My Millionaire Migrant Boss, stated his wealth at £50 million. Koukash is often referred to as a multi-millionaire by the media. Early life and business career Koukash was born on the west bank of the River Jordan in December 1958 in Palestine. When he was eight years old, the family farm was bombed, due to rising escalations with the Israeli military in Palestine and the family crossed into Jordan before settling in Kuwait. Eventually, he moved to Britain to progress his education, and settled in St. Helens to study at the local technical college. He graduated from Liverpool John Moores University and progressed to get a PhD in electrical engineering. He taught at the university for five years, and was appointed Director of International Business. He is also the owner of hotels operated by Hilton such as The Doubletree Hotel in Liverpool. Horse racing He was introduced to horse racing by his bank manager, Dave Matthews, and had his first winner in 2007. In 2012, he had 101 winners, who accumulated over £1m in prize money. His racing silks are grey with a gold star and many of his horses are named after his son, Gabrial and daughters, Lexi and Layla. He owns a pre-training facility in Knowsley and uses various trainers including Richard Fahey and Kevin Ryan. It is claimed that he is the biggest owner of race horses in Britain. Rugby League Salford Red Devils In 2013, Koukash took over the loss-making Super League club, Salford City Reds. His interest in rugby league began when he went to watch St. Helens matches with his family. He was encouraged to take ownership of Salford by the Rugby Football League chief executive Nigel Wood, who had met Koukash on a flight to Dubai. Koukash aims to make the club the biggest in Super League, rebranding them as Salford Red Devils in 2013 and signing 14 new players. National Rugby League In 2014, Koukash made public his ambitions of purchasing a team in the Australian National Rugby League (NRL) before the 2015 season. The NRL is considered world's most competitive rugby league competition, in a country where rugby league is more popular than rugby union. In 2016, he also announced his plans to take an English team (the \\"British Bulldogs\\") and have then play in the NRL in Australia, with the help of airline and hotel sponsorship.

His campaign against his predecessor, Kim Wolfe, in the 2012 mayoral election marked the first time a sitting city official challenged an incumbent mayor since Huntington switched to a strong mayor form of government in 1985. Williams previously served as Huntington's city manager, a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, and a member of the Huntington City Council. Education Williams attended Huntington High School, graduating in 1974. He received a Bachelor of Arts in political science from Marshall University in 1978 and a Master of Public Administration degree from West Virginia University in 1980.\\"Meet Mayor Steve Williams,\\" City of Huntington (archived at WebCite on 8 May 2013). Career Williams served as director of economic development for Huntington in 1984 and worked as city manager from 1984 to 1985. From 1987 to 1994, he was a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates for Cabell County and Wayne County. He previously ran for mayor in 1993, defeating incumbent mayor Bobby Nelson in the Democratic primary, but lost to Republican opponent, Councilwoman Jean Dean. Williams returned to politics in 2008 when he won election as an at-large member of Huntington City Council, where he served until his election as mayor in 2012. On June 19, 2017, Williams announced that he would stand in the 2018 race for West Virginia's 3rd congressional district, which was an open seat after current Congressman Evan Jenkins declared to run against Joe Manchin for the Senate.. On January 19, 2018, Williams dropped out of the race. Mayor of Huntington In March 2013, Williams signed an ordinance passed by the Huntington City Council which rescinded a 1% occupation tax which had been the subject of a lawsuit filed in 2011 against the city. The tax had been imposed under a West Virginia initiative which granted several cities, including Huntington, increased home rule, including increased powers to change their tax structures. During the spring and summer of 2013, Williams's administration organized a citywide cleanup effort and planned increased enforcement of local ordinances like those that prohibited tall grass and the storage of furniture and construction materials in yards or on porches. The city planned to hire additional code enforcement officers, reinstate the Fire Department's Fire Prevention Bureau and seek the ability to issue citations on-the-spot, rather than after a ten-day warning period, from the West Virginia State Legislature. The mayor directed the city government to design and implement a system to ensure all new graffiti in the city is removed within 24 hours. Williams has supported the continued redevelopment of the Central City Market in Huntington's West End, drawing inspiration from the management of the Capitol Market in Charleston. In 2017 under Williams' direction, the City of Huntington sued eight pharmaceutical companies, claiming their products harmed Huntington's welfare, leading to a drug crisis in the city and surrounding county. Included in the lawsuits are companies like McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corp, among others. Personal life Williams is married to Mary Poindexter Williams and has two step-daughters. He serves as an officer of various organizations affiliated with Marshall University and attends Trinity Episcopal Church.

It was brought to Mexico by those in Spanish ships, then spread to the center of Mexico, where it became a significant factor in the fall of Tenochtitlan. During the colonial period, there were major epidemic outbreaks which led to the implementation of sanitary and preventive policy. The introduction of smallpox vaccination in New Spain by Francisco Javier de Balmis and the work of Ignacio Bartolache reduced the mortality and morbidity of the disease. Introduction of smallpox into Mexican History Smallpox was an unknown disease not only in Mexico, but in all the Americas, before the arrival of Europeans. It was introduced to Mexican lands by the Spanish and played a significant role in the downfall of the Aztec Empire. Hernán Cortés departed from Cuba and arrived in Mexico in 1519, sent to start trade relations only on the Veracruz Coast. However, he disobeyed the Cuban governor and began to invade the mainland. The governor sent Pánfilo de Narváez after Cortés. Narvaez's forces had at least one active case of smallpox, and when the Narvaez expedition stopped at Cozumel and Veracruz in 1520, the disease gained a foothold in the region. The introduction of smallpox among the Aztecs has been attributed to an African slave (by the name of Francisco Eguía, according to one account) but this has been disputed. From May to September, smallpox spread slowly to Tepeaca and Tlaxcala, and to Tenochtitlán by the fall of 1520. At this time, Cortes was returning to conquer the city after being thrown out on the Noche Triste. Cortes names only one indigenous leader who died of smallpox, Maxixcatzin. However, Cuitláhuac and other native rulers also died of smallpox. Chimalpahin reports the death of some lords in Chalco from the disease as well. These deaths were part of a widespread epidemic which decimated the common population. Estimates of mortality range from one- quarter to one-half of the population of central Mexico. Toribio Motolinia, a Spanish monk that witnessed this epidemic, said: “It became such a great pestilence among them throughout the land that in most provinces more than half the population died; in others the proportion was less. They died in heaps, like bedbugs.” Major outbreak in the colonial period During the colonial period, smallpox remained a scourge, especially on the indigenous population. There was a major epidemic between 1790 and 1791 that started in Valley of Mexico, principally affecting children. More people recovered than died. In Mexico City, of 5400 cases admitted to the hospital, 4431 recovered and 1,331 died. This epidemic coincided with the rise of prices of corn and a typhus epidemic, which caused a slight demographic decrease in central Mexico. Another smallpox epidemic came into Mexico from Guatemala in 1794. Oaxaca and Chiapas were the first places affected by smallpox because of proximity. The epidemic traveled from Oaxaca to Puebla, and then spread to Mexico City and Veracruz by 1797. By 1798, the epidemic had reached Saltillo and Zacatecas. This outbreak is notable because that was the first time that sanitary and preventive campaigns were implemented in New Spain, such as quarantines, inoculation, isolation and the closing of roads. Different institutions provided health and public services to fight against the smallpox epidemic: the most important were The “Ayuntamiento” or city council. The Catholic Church and \\"Real Tribunal del Protomedicato\\", which was an institution founded in 1630, managed all sanitary aspects of New Spain including the establishment of quarantines. Charity boards were created, where rich people of the city donated money to build hospitals and to help and cure the sick. This charity board was led by the Spanish archbishop Alonso Núñez de Haro y Peralta. The interest of rich people to help the poor was not purely philanthropic, as the death of those sectors caused economic problems because indigenous population was not able to pay tribute or work. The Church-managed hospitals and cemeteries forced people to bury dead people with lime at the outside of cities. The isolation of sick people in hospitals or charities at the outsides of the cities was another important measure to stop the smallpox infection. These institutions took care of patients and provided them food and medicine. During the 1797 and 1798 outbreak, they also provided inoculation and were called inoculation houses. Although inoculation was practiced, the miasma theory of disease was still believed. In 1796, Gaceta de México published an article in which the use of inoculation was promoted, giving examples of kings and important persons who underwent the procedure. In January 1798, the eradication of the 1790s epidemic was declared. The government proposed that the measures taken in that epidemic be implemented as the official policy in the case of a new epidemic, and it was approved by city council in April 1799. Viceroy Miguel José de Azanza, ordered an article written on 14 November 1799 about the benefits resulting from the inoculation in the 1790s epidemic and distributed to the population. In 1803, Spanish doctor Francisco Javier Balmis started a vaccination program against smallpox in New Spain, better known as Balmis Expedition, which reduced the severity and mortality in the epidemics that followed. Before Balmis, Dr José María Arboleyda started a vaccination campaign in 1801 but this was not successful. There was another important outbreak in 1814 which started in Veracruz and extended to Mexico City, Tlaxcala and Hidalgo. This epidemic caused Viceroy Félix Calleja to take preventive measures like fumigations and vaccination, which were successful. There were sporadic outbreaks until 1826 when smallpox appeared in Yucatán, Tabasco and Veracruz brought by North American ships. In 1828, there were reported cases in Hidalgo, Oaxaca, State of Mexico, Guerrero, Chiapas, Chihuahua and Mexico City. Eradication Efforts to eradicate smallpox in Mexico started when José Ignacio Bartolache wrote a book in 1779 about smallpox treatment called Instrucción que puede servir para que se cure a los enfermos de las viruelas epidemicas que ahora se padecen en México (Instructions that may help to cure smallpox in Mexico) in which he included an introduction describing the disease and instructions to treat it, such as drinking warm water with salt and honey, gargling with water and vinegar, keep tidy and clean and finish treatment by taking a purgative. He thought that smallpox was a remedy of nature to clear bad mood and doctors should not accelerate the process of healing because it was against nature. He wrote a letter to propose his measures as a strategy to combat smallpox in which he also included recommendations like purify air with gunpowder and scent, ventilate churches where bodies were buried and to build cemeteries outside the city. This strategy was approved by City Council in September 1779. The next phase of eradication started in 1803 when Francisco Javier de Balmis started a vaccination campaign in New Spain. This vaccine was used until 1951 when smallpox was declared officially eradicated in Mexico. Military surgeon, Cristóval María Larrañaga, used this vaccine in the New Mexico province to inoculate thousands of people starting in 1804.

He was a respected judge of horses and an astute and highly successful gambler. During a career that lasted almost forty years he managed and trained eleven English classic winners and was himself the owner of a record three Grand National winners. Early life James Machell was born at Etton Rectory near Beverley on 5 December 1837, the youngest child of the Reverend Robert and Eliza Machell. He attended Rossall School near Fleetwood Lancashire from 1846 to 1854. In 1857 he joined the army and was posted to India, becoming involved with the suppression of the Indian mutiny. His regiment returned home to be quartered on The Curragh in Ireland where Machell spent the next seven years. During this period he participated in horse racing and in 1862 became the leading owner in Ireland. The same year he was promoted from Lieutenant to Captain by purchase on 29 July. When his army life and racing started to conflict, he resigned his commission and took stables in Kennet near Newmarket, Suffolk with a small string of horses. He would bring off a betting coup at the 1864 Newmarket spring meeting with Bacchus, a horse he had owned and run in Ireland. The funds from this and further wins enabled Machell to purchase Bedford Cottage stables in Newmarket. Here he employed George Bloss to act as trainer, whilst he retained strategic control and management of the horses and stables. Later trainers were Joe Cannon and James Jewitt. In 1884 he purchased the adjacent Bedford Lodge stables and leased these to George Alexander Baird. Machell was aware of the potential for Irish-bred horses and many of his future successes would come from Irish yearlings sent to him by Charles Blake of Heath House Stables, Maryborough (Port Laoise). Machell was a good athlete when young and during his army days would make wagers on his ability to perform feats of strength and agility. When he moved to Newmarket in 1864 he beat the local running champion in a 100 yards sprint. Career achievements \\"Newmarket 1885\\" During his career Machell won 11 English Classic races for his clients plus other major races including 4 Ascot Gold Cups and 5 Stewards' Cups at Goodwood as well as the 4 Grand Nationals at Aintree and the Scottish Grand National. His Patrons included Lord Henry Chaplin, Sir George Chetwynd, the Duke of Devonshire, Lord Calthorpe, Sir Charles Legard, the third and fourth Earls of Lonsdale, Colonel Owen Williams, Captain Prime, Lord Hastings, Lord Gerard, the Duke of Beaufort, Lord Strathnairn, Lord Aylesford, Mr C. J. Blake, Lord Rodney and Colonel Harry McCalmont. Some of the great horses he managed were Hermit, Petronel, Belphcebe, Pilgrimage, Seabreeze, Harvester, Kilwarlin and triple crown winner Isinglass. Epsom Derby In 1865 Machell became the racing manager for Henry Chaplin. Machell had three of Chaplin's horses - Breadalbane, Broomielaw and Hermit - transferred to Bedford Cottage from William Goater’s yard in Findon, West Sussex. Hermit was entered for the 1867 Epsom Derby but suffered severe bleeding from the nose during training and it appeared unlikely he would be fit enough to run. However, he responded well to treatment and recovered in time to race, going on to take the Derby and make considerable money for the connections. This was to be the first of three Derby wins for the Machell stables, the others being Harvester (1884) and Isinglass (1893). Harvester's win was a dead heat with St. Gatien. Grand National Machell had a good eye for steeplechasers and he became the most successful owner in the history of The Grand National with three winners: Disturbance (1873), Reugny (1874) and Regal (1876). The first two were ridden and trained by John Maunsell Richardson at Limba Magna who rode as an amateur (gentleman rider). Richardson, who had previously won the 1871 Scottish Grand National for Machell, became unhappy with Machell’s attempts to influence the betting market and parted company with him. Machell moved his jumpers to Joe Cannon at Kentford. Cannon would ride Regal to victory in the 1876 National. A further National win was secured for owner John Manners-Sutton, 3rd Baron Manners who had wagered that he could buy and ride the winner of the 1882 Grand National with just a few months preparation. The horse he chose was Seaman, purchased in Ireland and trained on by Machell and Jimmy Jewitt. The race - run in a snow storm - was won by Seaman even though he sustained an injury at the final fence. Gambling Machell was renowned for making large and often successful wagers and for manipulating the betting market in his favour. John Maunsell Richardson had been so \\"disgusted with the sordid nature\\" of Machell's manipulation that he withdrew from public riding after his 1874 Grand National win on Reugny. His experience was not unique, in Turf Memories of Sixty Years, Alexander Scott provides other examples of how Machell would use questionable tactics, and Lillie Langtry in her memoirs relates stories told to her by Machell about money making schemes connected with selling plate races. Final years The grave of James Octavus Machell (1837 – 1902) Newmarket, Suffolk, England In 1887 Machell lost his friend jockey Fred Archer who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Machell had been angry with Archer when they last met and he suffered guilt and remorse for months after the death. In the 1890s Machell's health began to fail him and in 1893 he suffered a breakdown. In 1896 he relinquished his interest in the Gatwick Racecourse (he had joined the syndicate in 1890). When his friend and trainer, James Jewitt, died in 1899, he sold the Bedford Cottage stables to Harry McCalmont, wealthy owner of Isinglass. He retained some horses at his Chetwynd House stables, trained by George Chaloner, and continued to run horses in Ireland. Lillie Langtry related visits from Captain Machell to her Regal Lodge residence in Kentford, where they were neighbours. This was after 1895 when Langtry first owned the house. She says Machell taught her much about the sport, but horses and racing filled his mind to obsession, his literature consisted of sporting papers and he passed a good part of his time making imaginary handicaps. He carried a little book in his waistcoat pocket that contained details and values of all his assets, including his horses. Captain James Octavius Machell died on 11 May 1902 in Hastings and was buried in Newmarket. * Chetwynd House, constructed for jockey Charles Wood and later purchased by Machell is now called Machell Place. Crackenthorpe Hall Crackenthorpe Hall in Cumbria had been the ancestral home of the Machell family for five centuries but was sold to Lord Lonsdale in 1786. In 1877 Captain Machell bought back the Hall, restoring and adding to it. Machell, who never married, left the hall to his nephew Percy Machell who was killed at the Battle of the Somme in July 1916. His wife, Lady Valda Machell, daughter of Prince Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, continued to live at the Hall until about 1928.

Designed and constructed by Omen Design Group Inc., the approximately sculpture was installed in 1988 in a corner of Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Oregon, United States. Two thousand people attended its dedication, which was broadcast live nationally from the square by Today weatherman Willard Scott. The machine cost $60,000. During its daily two-minute sequence, which includes a trumpet fanfare, mist, and flashing lights, the machine displays one of three metal symbols as a prediction of the weather for the following 24-hour period: a sun for clear and sunny weather, a blue heron for drizzle and transitional weather, or a dragon and mist for rainy or stormy weather. The sculpture includes two bronze wind scoops and displays the temperature via colored lights along its stem. The air quality index is also displayed by a light system below the stainless steel globe. Weather predictions are made based on information obtained by employees of Pioneer Courthouse Square from the National Weather Service and the Department of Environmental Quality. Considered a tourist attraction, Weather Machine has been called \\"bizarre\\", \\"playful\\", \\"unique\\", and \\"wacky\\", and has been compared to a giant scepter. Description and history Weather Machine is a lumino kinetic bronze sculpture that serves as a weather beacon, designed and constructed by Omen Design Group Inc. Contributors included Jere and Ray Grimm, Dick Ponzi, who won a 40-entry international competition to design the machine for Pioneer Courthouse Square (1984), and Roger Patrick Sheppard. The group described their efforts as \\"collaborative\\", but Sheppard considered Ponzi the \\"maestro\\" of the project. Ponzi did the engineering and hydraulics, and the machine was assembled at his vineyard near Beaverton. The sculpture was inspired by Portland-born-and-based writer Terence O'Donnell, who suffered from osteomyelitis during his childhood, and his \\"funny Irish jig\\". Weather Machine, which took five years to plan and build and cost $60,000, was installed in the square in August 1988. Today weatherman Willard Scott broadcast live from the square to dedicate the sculpture on its August 24 opening. Two thousand people were present as early as 4 a.m. for the dedication. Financial contributors included Pete and Mary Mark, the AT&T; Foundation, Alyce R. Cheatham, Alexandra MacColl, E. Kimbark MacColl, Meier & Frank, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, David Pugh and Standard Insurance Company. Information about the donors was included on a plaque added to the sculpture's stem in the weeks following the dedication. The sculpture includes two bronze wind scoops. Pictured is the blue heron symbol, which indicates transitional weather. Each day at noon, the columnar machine performs a two-minute sequence that begins with a trumpet fanfare of the opening bars of Aaron Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man, and produces mist and flashing lights. It eventually reveals one of three metal symbols: a stylized golden sun (\\"helia\\") for clear and sunny weather, a blue heron (Portland's official bird) for drizzle and transitional weather, or mist and a \\"fierce, open-mouthed\\" dragon for heavy rain or stormy weather. The fanciful symbols change at the same time every day, representing weather predictions for the following 24-hour period. \\"Helia\\", described as \\"gleaming\\", was designed by Jere Grimm; her design would later be applied to one of her husband's pots, exhibited in 1989. The trumpets are allowed to play at noon due to a waiver of Portland's noise ordinance for that time period. Ray Grimm constructed the blue heron symbol, and the group collaborated on the dragon symbol based on his drawings. In order for the machine to display an accurate weather prediction, as reported by The Oregonian in 1988, employees of Pioneer Courthouse Square contact the National Weather Service each morning at 10:30 a.m. for the forecast, and then enter information into the machine's computer, located behind a nearby door. The machine, whose height is reported to be between , includes two bronze wind scoops that turn in opposite directions. It also indicates the temperature (when or above) via vertical colored lights along the sculpture's stem. Measured by an internal gauge, the machine displays blue lights for temperatures below freezing, white lights for above freezing and red lights to mark every ten degrees (°F). Referring to an additional light system (below the stainless steel globe) that indicates air quality, The Oregonian reported in 1988 that a green light indicates good air quality, amber reflects \\"semismoggy\\" air and a red light indicates poor air quality. However, in 1998, one writer for The Oregonian warned: \\"you don't want to breathe so much when the white light is on\\". Pioneer Courthouse Square employees enter air quality information into the machine's computer following routine checks with the Department of Environmental Quality. In addition to its pre-dawn dedication on national television, Weather Machine had a public dedication at noon on August 24, attended by Mayor Bud Clark and other city officials. On that day, the machine displayed the sun symbol and a green light for good air quality, and indicated a temperature of . Following the fanfare, known officially as \\"Fanfare for Weather Machine with Four Trumpets\\", jazz singer Shirley Nanette led the crowd in a rendition of \\"You Are My Sunshine\\". Portland had good weather in the days following its dedication, preventing visitors from seeing all three symbols for an extended length of time (though all three symbols are displayed briefly during the daily two-minute sequence). This prompted the executive director of Pioneer Courthouse Square to consider altering the machine's schedule so that the public would have a chance to see all three symbols. The sculpture maintained good operation until winter 1995, when its mechanical performance temporarily began deviating away from noon and the temperature gauge had difficulties working properly. In 2012, the machine malfunctioned and stopped operating for about a week. Reception The sculpture, from the north, during an Occupy Portland protest in 2011 In the weeks following Weather Machine dedication, an estimated 300 to 400 people gathered at the square daily to witness the noon sequence. Following the dedication, The Oregonian wrote: \\"It takes nothing from its fascination to know that a human on the staff of the square will be making the daily phone calls to the Weather Service and the Department of Environmental Quality, and pushing the necessary buttons to cue the pillar's performance ... They have given Portland an attraction no other city has. We're going to like it.\\" Ponzi described the machine as \\"light-hearted ... active, distinctive—and fun\\". O'Donnell, who inspired the sculpture, called it a \\"gentle spectacle\\" and described the work as \\"a cartoon contraption, an odd little thingamajig. It has bells and whistles and other mechanized wonders that confirm rain sometime after the downpour and proudly announce sunshine in the bright light of day.\\" In 1994, The Oregonian reported that O'Donnell regarded Weather Machine with a \\"mixture of wonder and embarrassment\\" and stated that he \\"[didn't] think it [was] all that attractive\\". The publication's Vivian McInerny said of O'Donnell and the machine: \\"Practical people may wonder why the square needs such a silly weather machine when a glance out the window works as well .... And these practical people may be the very ones who make the world go 'round. But it is the less practical people, the dreamers like O'Donnell, who make it worth going 'round.\\" In 1995, The Oregonian Jonathan Nicholas wrote, \\"To this day, nobody is exactly sure what happens when the thing sounds off each day at noon. It's like having a governor in blue jeans. We can't really explain it: It just happens.\\" Grant Butler of The Oregonian gave the machine's trumpet fanfare as one of three examples of ways in which people could be certain it was noon in Portland. The machine is considered a tourist attraction, recommended in visitor guides for PortlandVisitor guides: * * * and included in walking tours.Walking tours: * * One travel contributor recommended a visit to the sculpture for people with children seeking a \\"perfect family day\\".

Released in 2011, It consists of two CDs. The first disc is a never-released studio album that Gallagher recorded in San Francisco in December 1977. The album was to be a major shift for Gallagher. Rather than producing it himself, he worked with Elliot Mazer a successful producer who had a long track record with artists such as Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin and The Band. At the last minute -- causing great distress to his manager and brother Dónal and to his record company -- Gallagher decided to just pull the record. In an interview, Gallagher stated \\"it wasn't because of the material or the musicians or anything like that. It was a song thing that I didn't think on the technical side everything worked. So I scrapped the thing\\" After scrapping the album Gallagher reworked his band firing all the musicians except the bass player and hiring a new drummer. This new Gallagher power trio re-recorded some the San Francisco songs, and some others, with Gallagher producing and released them as Photo-Finish. Shortly before his death, Rory reportedly gave Dónal permission to eventually release the original San Francisco versions of the songs if they were remixed.

He was the first Serb to translate Goethe. Biography Jovan Pačić, born in 1771 in a small village of Baja where numerous Serbian authors and artists called home (Joakim Vujić, Bogoboj Atanacković, Mita Popović, painter Pavle Đurković and sculptor Dimitrije Popović). He went to a German and Hungarian school in Kalocsa. In 1792 or 1793, he joined the hussar regiment of the Austrian army and fought against the French. He took part in several battles of the War of the Fifth Coalition. Pačić was wounded at the great Battle of Wagram in 1812 when a sword cut through his mouth. He retired after a year of recuperation. As a retired cavalry captain, he moved to Novi Sad, and soon after settled in Győr in 1838. He published many verses in the Serbian Journal (Serbski letopis), Budapest couriers, the Serbian National News (Serbski narodni list) and magazines until 1842. Jovan Pačić turned to painting and poetry in his leisure. He primarily painted landscapes and genre art. He was praised by his contemporaries. Pačić died in 1849 in a hotel owned by Jakov Ignjatović's uncle (Sima Ignjatović) in the ethnic quarter of Budapest known as Tabán. His neighbours at the time were poet Sima Milutinović Sarajlija and novelist Milovan Vidaković. Literary works He was a writer and poet whose activity was linked with the latter part of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. He wrote Imenoslovo ili rečnik lićny imena razny naroda Slavenski ( A lexicon of names of various Slavic people) in collaboration with Ján Kollár, and published by Josif Milovuk (1793-1850) in Budapest in 1826; Sočinenija pesnosloska (1827); and Stojšićev Elikon ili Sredstvoukrašenja duše (1827). He translated the Hungarian songs and proverbs of Péter Beniczky, who lived in the early part of the 17th century. Pačić's songs are about love, wine, combat, leaves, then there are elegies and epigrams. His verses are contemporary, modeled by the epoch in which he lived. His contemporaries were German poet Ernst Schulze, Hungarian poet Mihály Csokonai Vitéz and Serbian and Hungarian poet Mihailo Vitković. Some of his poetry closely resembles the enjamblement of the mannerist poetry of the second half of the sixteenth century, and Jovan Pačić, who best represents it, actually happens to be a late admirer of Giovanni della Casa, a poet of very licentious fancy. (Della Casa once presented a copy of erotic verse to the Pope, in mistake for a petition, and caused his own rise to greater preferment to be stunted). Paintings Most of Pačić's books and others were illustrated by the author himself, like the cover of Serb clothes in Bačka, a watercolor painting, part of his art book entitled Nošnje iz Bačke (National Costumes of Bačka).

Her father Salomon (Simeon) Kliatchkin (1858-1916) was the owner of the first credit bureau (credit reference agency) in the Russian Empire. Her mother was Helena Kliatchkin (née Bajenov; 1886-1953). She had nine siblings; one died in childhood, three in Joseph Stalin's purges, one survived in Russia and four survived in exile in France. The family's suffering under Stalin are recorded in a film shown on Russian television in 2008, История семьи как эпоха (The history of a family which was a witness to its epoch). She studied medicine in Paris before 1914. At this time she was married to her first husband, Leon Berenson, a lawyer. Berenson was the defender in the Tsarist courts of Felix Dzerzhinsky, who was to be the founder of the Cheka, the first Soviet secret police agency. At the outbreak of the First World War she volunteered to work as a nurse at the Hotel Continental in Paris, now the Westin Paris - Vendôme. She nursed Pierre Laurent (1892-1935), a young French officer, the son of Charles Laurent, a French senior civil servant. Pierre was sent to join the military mission of General Lavergne in Saint Petersburg, then called Petrograd. Lavergne had succeeded General Henri Niessel as head of the French military mission. There Pierre was responsible for obtaining information about the Russian army. Bronisława, back in Petrograd, helped him. After Vladimir Lenin arrived in his sealed train their priority was to prevent him leading Russia into an armistice with Germany. They were able to obtain telegrams to Lenin appearing to show that he was supported by German funds. They presented this information to the Provisional government headed by Prince Georgy Lvov on the 24th of June, but no action was taken at that meeting. However, Justice Minister Pereverzev investigated further and was able to obtain a fuller set of 66 telegrams (Lyandres). These proved the existence of an import business from Sweden run by the Bolsheviks, but it was the evidence of contact with known German agents which was damming. The July Days (3 – 7 July) were the Bolshevik’s second attempt at a coup. On the 4th of July Pereverzev shared the information gained from the telegrams with General Peter Polovtsov, commander of the Petrograd garrison, some newspaper editors and other ministers. According to Sean McMeekin, revulsion among the soldiers at the knowledge that Lenin was in contact with the enemy brought them on the side of the provisional government and ended the coup attempt. The next day Pereverzev’s men raided the Kschessinskaya mansion where the Bolsheviks were based. Many Bolsheviks were arrested and Lenin fled to Finland. According to McMeekin, recently opened Russian archives contain evidence, from the investigation triggered by the telegrams, that the import business was a front for laundering money being sent by the German government to the Bolsheviks. We can suppose, then, that Pierre and Bronia’s activities, helped to postpone the Bolshevik revolution from July to the “October Revolution” some four months later. A year after the October Revolution, in October 1918, Bronisława escaped on a false French passport under the name of \\"Jeanne-Liliane Lalande\\". While in Petrograd she had met Bolesław Wieniawa- Długoszowski, a Polish officer. At considerable personal risk to herself she was able to persuade the Cheka to release him from Taganka Prison in Moscow to house arrest at her house. They both escaped to Poland, and he became her second husband. They had one daughter, Zuzanna, later Susanna Vernon (11 August 1920 - 3 August 2011). Susanna was the goddaughter of Józef Piłsudski, the main leader of Poland between the wars, who was a friend of her father. In the summer the family lived in the manor house of Bobowa. They famously had good, if distant, relations with the Hasidic Jews of Bobowa (Bobov) and the Bobov Rebbe Ben Zion Halberstam. The rest of the year they lived in their official residence; a hunting lodge in Łazienki Park in the center of Warsaw. When in 1938 General Bolesław Wieniawa-Długoszowski was sent to Rome as Polish ambassador to the government of Benito Mussolini, Bronisława accompanied him. When Italy joined the war with the other Axis powers in 1940 they fled together to New York. In 1942 he committed suicide. She and her daughter were looked after for some weeks by Arthur Szyk, the famous cartoonist and anti- Nazi activist. Tatiana Yacovleff du Plessix Liberman was another friend who, with her husband, Alexander Liberman, helped Zuzanna find work at Vogue magazine and, later, at the United Nations, where she became one of the first simultaneous interpreters. Bronisława returned to Europe after the war and died in Paris in August 1953 of the complications of a gall bladder operation. She is buried in the Montparnasse Cemetery under her assumed name; \\"Jeanne- Liliane Lalande\\" in the Laurent family tomb. As explained in the Russian film mentioned above, after half a century without contact, twenty years after Bronisława's death, the Russian and French descendants of Salomon Kliatchkin were re-united.

He later became paramount chief of an expansive region of Kenya at the beginning of british imposition of colonial rule in East Africa. He is regarded as the greatest ruler of the Wanga Kingdom for his management of the British colonial transition leading to British occupation in Kenya in the 20th century. He led a kingdom that was famous for trade with Arabs in slaves at a time when the Wanga Kingdom was under extreme military pressure from the Luo- ugenya. This slave trade between the Arab and the Wanga led to capturing of non-Wanga tribes into slavery such as Luo-ugenya and Bukusu who were also enemies of the Wanga kingdom because of their repeated insurgents against the kingdom. This constant insurgents and military attacks led Nabongo Mumia to collaborate with the British who made him a paramount chief of an expansive region of East Africa with various chiefs reporting to him such as Chief Chabasinga who managed Jinja Busonga, Lenan Tenai who managed the Maasai and chief Odera Akang'o who managed Luo Nyanza. At the time the Wanga Kingdom extended from present day Jinja, Uganda to present day Naivasha, Kenya with the main ruling town present day Mumias. Nabongo Mumia's gazetement as a paramount chief in 1913 legitimized his rule as a king of the Wanga and paramount chief. In 1926, the British colonial government regazetted his region of management to North kavirondo equivalent to western region of Kenya today. This regazetement led to the eventual loss of political relevance of the Wanga Kingdom, although Nabongo Mumia remained a powerful and influential figure until his death in 1949. His prominence, power and influence was evident in during his burial in 1949 when high ranking members of the colonial government were in attendance. Biography Early life Nabongo Mumia was born a prince between 1849 and 1852. His parents were Nabongo Shiundu Wamukoya and Wamanya. =Abashitsetse clan= Nabongo Mumia was born into the abashitstes, one of the 22 clans that comprises the Wanga tribe. The abashitse is the clan that formed the royal lineage that produced the Nabongos (Wanga Kings). He grew up as an ordinary Wanga child participating in domestic animal herding, farming, hunting and gathering and his most notable achievement was killing a lion and leopard by the time he was 18 years old. His physique of being thin, having a deep voice and his shyness towards strangers made his father Nabongo Wamukoya repeatedly loath him for being an unlikely candidate for the Nabongoship (kingship). Nevertheless, his father eventually appointed him heir reluctantly. Nabongo Mumia's mother Queen Wamanya supported Nabongo Mumia's quest of inheritance of the kingdom and even manouvered against other members of the family who were in line to the throne in lieu for Nabongo Mumia. This made Nabongo Mumia King by circumstance as opposed to the tradition of kingdom inheritance based on clan members who are in line of succession. The king then had a total of 13 wives and 18 sons who all had equal chances of becoming king. Personal life Nabongo Mumia married multiple wives. Polygamy was largely practiced by the Wanga Kingdom to ensure stability with other communities through inter-marriage. Reign =Arab-Wanga trade & military insurgents= The Arabs began dealing and had traded with the Wanga Kingdom since early 19th century. It was not until the change of leadership at the Wanga Kingdom, at the beginning of the reign of Nabongo Mumia, that the Wanga Kingdom began to employ the Arabs and Swahili traders in fighting enemies of the kingdom directly. The Arabs were in search for land to hunt for game and slaves. Nabongo Mumia changed strategy from that employed by previous Wanga kings by employing Arabs directly in the military wars against neighboring communities of Luo-ugenya and Bukusu. This change of tact gave the Wanga Kingdom an upper hand in the military's invasion against insurgents but never solved the repeated threat of insurgents of the kingdom until the gazettement of administrative region of leadership which he was appointed paramount chief during the inquest of the British. The Anglo-Arab collaboration still did not alleviate military pressure of the Wanga Kingdom especially because of repeated conflicts on matters of territorial boundaries against the Luo-ugenya, failed conquests of additional lands and territories within the Luo-ugenya lands. The Arabs were able to capture slaves from the Luo and Bukusu by directly participating in fighting enemies of the Wanga Kingdom. These repeated interactions with the Arab later made the Wanga predominantly Islam. Around 1890, when Fredick Lugard met Nabongo Mumia, he observed that he spoke pretty good Swahili and the larger Wanga community had Islamic regalia and demeanour. Nabongo Mumia became a Muslim and died a Muslim. =Collaboration with the British= He was appointed heir on the eve of his father’s death. Mumia occupied a prominent place in British colonial administration from 1908 to 1926 and was recognised as the Paramount Chief. He ruled the Kingdom for 67 years from 1882 to 1949 in one of the longest reigns in African history. The Wanga Kingdom was the most highly developed and centralised kingdom in Kenyan history before the advent of British colonialism. When the British arrived in Western Kenya in 1883, they found the Wanga Kingdom as the only organised state with a centralised hereditary monarch in the whole of what later came to be known as Kenya. Mumia had heard stories that the British colonial administration appointed colonial paramount chiefs in their quest to seek assistance in imposition of colonial rule. Nabongo Mumia used foresight and intelligence in initiating relations with the British and accepting to collaborate with the British many years before other communities in Kenya had an interaction with foreigners or participated in international trade. This foresight eventually paid off when he was appointed paramount chief in a gazetted appointment that legitimately made chiefs of different regions that previously repeatedly resisted Wanga kingdom leadership eventually submit to him. Previous failed military conquests of the Wanga Kingdom of lands and communities that previously aggressively threatened the stability and supremacy of the kingdom now were forced to report to him. Some of the chiefs that were appointed and reported to him included: Chief Chabasinga who managed Uganda region of Jinja Busonga, Lenan Tenai of Maasai and chief Odera Akang'o who managed Luo Nyanza among others who managed Maragoli, Bukusu, Kisa, Butsoso, Kabras, Busia among others. Nabongo Mumia had completely annihilated military and territorial threats against the Wanga Kingdom. This victory made Nabongo Mumia a legend among the Abaluya, communities that were conquered and larger Kenya to this day. Because of his intelligence he had managed to win century-old military wars without any bloodshed despite the fact that he was illiterate. Between 1913 and 1926, the Wanga Kingdom experienced exponential growth of its economy. It was during this time that Nabongo Mumia became the first ever Luhya to own a vehicle and a motor cycle. During this time when the American Singer Corporation was expanding its products around the world, its first products were sold in the Wanga Kingdom in East Africa. By 1926, when the British were beginning to get concerned about Nabongo Mumia's influence on their conflicting interests with their leadership direction about the colonial administration management, they retired him and regazetted his administrative region of management. The colonial administration continued to pay his salary until his death. Because Nabongo Mumia was illiterate, he failed to lead the kingdom in making changes and adapting to new political developments in regard to technicalities of the administration. For instance when the British regazetted the geographical region previously under Nabongo Mumia as paramount chief, he still thought that he excercised authority in regions regazetted out of his region. Although he still had personal influence before and after the regazettement, he did not utilize it for political relevance. This inability to distinguish technicalities of his personal influence and that of the kingdom eventually led to the loss of political relevance of the Wanga Kingdom. Another instance when Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's first president initiated contact in the talk of decolonization, Nabongo Mumia described the talks as premature and did not support Jommo Kenyatta. Because Mumia was illiterate, he failed to realize the progress experienced in the kingdom was short lived and there was need to evolve. In later years, this cost the Wanga Kingdom political relevance and economic development, because the Wanga Kingdom and regions that were peopled by the Wanga Kingdom remained underdeveloped and were not involved in major political developments such as independence, and subsequent political formations after independence. Another chance at political relevance was wasted during the coronation of King Edward. Nabongo Mumia was invited to England, but he refused to travel to England under the advice of the Arabs who cautioned that he was likely to be captured. An action that was repeated by Jomo Kenyatta years later when he moved to England with similar concerns and fears, but eventually persuasively achieved diplomatic agreements that contributed in him being later the first president of Kenya at independence. Despite cognisance of his floundering influence and that of the Wanga Kingdom, Nabongo Mumia remained fiercely loyal to the colonial administration until his death. Death When Mumia died in 1949, major high ranking members of the colonial administration such as Philip Mitchell were in attendance. Descendants Mumia's royal background caused a dilemma to the colonial officers. He was “retired” by the colonial authorities in 1926, but maintained influence until his death on April 24, 1949. He left behind multiple descendants including 109 sons, 60 daughters and 400 grandchildren.

He then moved to the state of Florida in 1978, where he started a swimming pool remodeling business. Florida House of Representatives In 2010, Ahern ran for the Florida House of Representatives from the 51st District, which included parts of Pinellas County, against incumbent Democratic State Representative Janet Long. A contentious election ensued, in which Ahern campaigned on \\"conservatism and a business-friendly attitude,\\" and in which Long aired a controversial television advertisement \\"in which her son, a war hero, characterized Ahern as a coward.\\" Ultimately, Ahern defeated Long and Tea Party candidate Victoria Torres, receiving 50% of the vote to Long's 44% and Torres's 6%. When Florida House districts were redrawn in 2012, Ahern was redistricted into the 66th District, which included most of the territory that he had previously represented in the 51st District. He was opposed by Mary Louise Ambrose, the Democratic nominee and the owner of an insurance agency. Ambrose was endorsed by the Tampa Bay Times, which criticized Ahern for voting \\"in lockstep with leadership and special interests to the detriment of his constituents.\\" However, Ahern was re-elected over Ambrose with 53% of the vote. While serving in the legislature, Ahern sponsored legislation that would \\"make the death of an 'unborn child' a separate crime from an offense committed against the mother,\\" which Democrats opposed because \\"[a] person would not have to know a woman is pregnant to be charged with a crime.\\" Additionally, he authored legislation that would make prosecuting identity theft easier by eliminating a legal requirement that the stolen personal information be \\"used to commit fraud.\\" In April 2017, Ahern filed paperwork to run for the Pinellas County Commission District 6.

Rogers began her lifetime obsession in her twenties while building a dollhouse for her young daughter. Her husband, an English army Colonel stationed in India, soon joined her in her craft, and the two spent decades engaged in intensive collaborative research and innovation. Rogers modeled many carpets on existing examples in prominent British collections (exploring Turkish, Shirvan, Caucasian, Daghestan, Hamadan, Khamseh, and Baluchi designs) while providing subtle alterations to existing styles. A number of Rogers' carpets contain personalized and possibly coded inscriptions. Rogers' carpets were purchased by major collectors of the time including Queen Mary, who exhibited them in her celebrated Dolls' house. An April 1947 feature article in The Illustrated London News describes Rogers' \\"enchanting rugs\\" as \\"miracles of fine beauty and craftsmanship\\" which \\"may well be said to exceed in precise craftsmanship even the exquisite French tapestries\\" then on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Rogers' carpets typically average between 250 and 400 stitches per square centimeter (1600 to 2500 stitches per square inch) and are worked in wool upon a fine canvas backing. Although Dorothy Rogers' own dollhouse has long since ceased to exist, many of its carpets and furnishings were exhibited and auctioned in March 1985 by Spink & Son Ltd. in London.

Twelve tanks were produced and later converted to Panzer 61s. History and development After World War II, Switzerland was only equipped with outdated fighting vehicles of foreign production such as the Hetzer. Switzerland sought to purchase new armored fighting vehicles but was unable to do so due to other nations' involvement in the Korean War. Thus, in 1953 funding was allocated for the development of a domestic medium tank. The first prototype was completed by Eidgenoessische Konstruktionswerkstaette in 1957 and was designated as Panzer 58. The main armament of the first prototype was a domestic 90 mm cannon. A second prototype was equipped with a British Ordnance QF 20 pounder. Another ten tanks armed with the 105 mm cannon were manufactured from 1960-1961. Vehicle systems The drive unit was compact and modular and thus could be installed as a unit easily. It consisted of the motor, auxiliary motor, drive and steering gear, power transmission and radiator. The auxiliary engine was a four-cylinder diesel engine and was used to drive the main generator and the power supply. In case of a problem with the main motor, the tank could be driven with the auxiliary engine via the auxiliary transmission, over short distances. The transmission was an SLM with 6 forward and 2 reverse gears. The foot brake and parking brake consisted of two brake bands on the left and right sides of the gearbox. The turret was located in the center of the tank. Crew The crew of the Panzer 58 consisted of a Commander, Driver, Loader, and Gunner. Use Between 1958 and 1964 the Panzer 58 was in service with the Swiss Army. Eventually, the vehicles were converted to and used as the Panzer 61. Legacy The lessons learned with the Panzer 58 project were the basis of the Panzer 61. This project served in the development of Switzerland's armored doctrine throughout the cold war and into the modern day; even modern Swiss Leopard 2 tanks are modified to conform to the unique demands of Switzerland that were born to a large extent from the Panzer 58 project.

Early life Varela was born and grew up in Södermalm on the south side of Stockholm. Both of his parents are from Galicia and he did not learn Swedish until he started school. During middle school, he became friends with Gustaf Skarsgård, son of internationally noted Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgård. Varela did not then know of the famous Skarsgård family because he mostly watched Spanish satellite television. When his friend Skarsgård applied to a selective upper secondary school, Södra Latin’s drama program near where both boys lived, Varela wanted to do the same. The elder Skarsgård gave the young Varela a few hours of acting instructions and he was accepted by the school. Varela said he was surprised, because he had shown up in a track suit and looked more like a chav than an aspiring actor. Career After a brief appearance in the soap opera Nya tider, he left Sweden for a while and on returning worked as a construction worker with small acting jobs for a sideline. After reading the bestselling Swedish crime novel Snabba Cash and hearing that a film production company Tre Vänner was adapting the book for the big screen he set his sights on starring as the Swedish-Chilean drug dealer Jorge Salinas. Varela convinced the director Daniel Espinosa to give him a screen test. Espinosa, who himself is of Chilean descent, had stated he wanted someone with roots in Chile, and Varela would eventually land the role. Easy Money was a success and Varela went on to star in both sequels: Easy Money II: Hard to Kill (2012) and Easy Money III: Life Deluxe (2013). He also got the part of Police Detective Jorge Chavez in the big budget TV-series Arne Dahl.http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/bilder-fran-inspelningen-av-arne- dahls-deckare In series 2 Alexander Salzberger replaced him.Euro TV Place: \\"Swedish Crime Drama Arne Dahl Returning with New Series\\".

The patterns are knitted into socks, hats, vests, scarves, mittens, afghans, pillow covers, and, most commonly, sweaters.  History  The first known example of Aran knitting appeared in the 1930s. The stitches that create the Aran knitting patterns are complex and the knitted goods are time-consuming to create. For example, a typical Aran sweater will have over 100,000 stitches, and may take several months to finish. The three dimensional effect of the twisted stitches also increased the warmth of the clothing by creating air pockets. Contrary to popular mythology, Aran knitting patterns were never used to assist in identifying dead fishermen who washed up onshore after accident at sea. This story appears to have been derived from John Millington Synge's play, Riders to the Sea, in which a character is identified by means of stitches dropped in error in a pair of plain socks knitted by his sister.  Meanings of the stitches  The idea that there are meanings associated with the stitches used in Aran knitting derives from Sacred History of Knitting, an entirely fabricated book written by Heinz Edgar Kiewe. Kiewe, a self-styled 'textile journalist' who ran a yarn shop in Oxford, purchased one of the first Aran-style sweaters and, noting a chance similarity between the patterns and ancient Irish illuminated manuscripts, began describing the stitchwork in these terms. Before long, his fanciful descriptions were being used to market the sweater abroad, particularly within the Irish Diaspora in the United States, and it became an accepted part of the sweater's lore that the knitting patterns were developed in ancient times, that each stitch pattern had an associated, usually Christian meaning, and that each family on the Aran Islands had its own clan Aran. However, actual historical documentation, including some of the oldest photography shot in Ireland, are at odds with this mythology. Nevertheless, knitters may find the following meanings entertaining and inspiring.\\"Aran Isle Sweaters - how a dropped stitch gave rise to a popular myth.\\". Irish Culture and Custome. by Bridget Haggerty The meanings of some of these stitches have been embellished in recent times since the knitting became a commercial enterprise.\\"Aran Stitches and their Meanings\\". Ireland from the Inside.  Cable stitch  The cable stitch, which is the most common type of stitch seen on Aran sweaters, is said to represent a fisherman’s ropes. There are many different type of cable stitches. The technique for cabling, which involves crossing one stitch over another is one of the easier stitches. The row on which the stitches crossed over each other is known as the turning row. After the turning row, several plain rows are worked, followed by another turning row. Standard cables have the same number of plain rows between turning rows as there are stitches in the cable.  Diamond stitch  The diamond stitch supposedly symbolises the small fields on the islands. These fields were worked intensively by local farmers, and this stitch may be said to represent hopes of good luck, success and wealth in farming on the Aran Islands. Diamond patterns might also represent the fishing nets.  Zig Zag stitch  Zig zag stitches, sometimes known as Marriage Lines, can be used to represent the typical highs and low of matrimony and marriage life. They are may also be used to represent the twisting cliff paths that are on the islands.  Honeycomb stitch  In Aran knitting patterns the honeycomb stitch, signifying the bee, is often used to represent both hard work and its rewards. The honeycomb stitch may be included as a symbol of good luck, signifying plenty. When only one repetition of the pattern is used, the honeycomb stitch is also known as the Chain Cable.  Trellis stitch  Trellis stitch recalls the stone-walled fields of the Northwestern farming communities, in the upland areas in Ireland where rock outcrops naturally or large stones exist in quantity in the soil such as in the Aran Islands. The stitch is useful for adding dimension, and might be used as a symbol of protection.  Tree of Life stitch  The Tree of Life stitch is frequently used as a motif of rites of passage, and of the importance of family. It is sometimes given a religious significance, symbolising a pilgrims path to salvation. This stitch is also known as the Trinity stitch.  Aran knitting patterns in modern times  Aran knitting patterns are very adaptable, and are widely used in many types of knitted items, including hats, scarves, skirts, and even decorative pillows.http://www.canadianliving.com/crafts/knitting/aran_pillow.php The recent revival of interest in handcrafts have led to many modern variations of both stitches and designs. The original sweaters were typically boxy, with saddle sleeves, knit flat and sewn together; however, many modern designs are knit in the round with little or no sewing, and are frequently fitted by clever manipulation of the stitch patterns. Today, the patterns are being used by knitters around the world, and the sweaters have become an Irish export commodity. Due to the success of cheap imports from the Far East from the 1970s onward, both the Irish woollen industry and the associated cottage knitting industry in Ireland which supplied hand-knit Aran-style items to the market were all but destroyed, and today only a few mills and handknitters continue the tradition. As a result, a hand-knit Aran sweater can be quite expensive, and may well be worked in wool and yarn blends imported from overseas.

Squires (born 1931) was the first African-American to play basketball at the University of Kansas during the 1951-1954 seasons, which made him a part of the 1952 National Championship team. LaVannes is the son of Arthur and Charlotte Squires and is the eighth of twelve children, born in Hartsdale, Missouri in 1931.  Early life  LaVannes father, Arthur, died when LaVannes was only 3 years old and he also lost three of his siblings due to poor health issues; his mother had only received an education as far as the fifth grade. Squires said his mother had immense pride which showed in her stern opposition toward handouts of any nature; she continued to work harder and harder, eventually their lives got better. His mother remarried but later divorced and moved to Plainview, Kansas from Oklahoma to work in manufacturing plants during World War II to produce war supplies; after the war they moved to Wichita, Kansas. Attributing to his mother and her hard work ethic, LaVannes developed hard working skills through filling coal bins for people, working in a wheat field, doing construction, and digging graves in a cemetery.Young, Andrew Sturgeon. \\"Sport was His Passport.\\" Los Angeles Sentinel: 1. Oct 24 1974. ProQuest. Web. 6 May 2013.  Academics and athletics  During the 1940s, Squires looked youthful, stood barely over six feet tall, and weighed about 180 pounds; however as a teenager he was very meager. At the time of his senior year at Wichita East High School, LaVannes was still very small but a good athlete; he earned the nickname “Felix the Cat” from his peers due to his quickness and slender appearance. His high school was well integrated, the black students held positions on the student council and were a part of the cheer team; however, this sparked riots among the students. In the classroom and on the basketball court, Squires was making a reputation for himself. Squires was the captain of the basketball team at Wichita East where he played guard and forward. He earned All-City and All- State honors and graduated in the top ten percent of his graduating class. Squires received university scholarship offers for his athletic and academic abilities; in 1950 he accepted a basketball scholarship from the University of Kansas. He became the university's first African-American athletic star and basketball player. LaVannes was the first in his family to go to college and, except for his brother who was in the armed services, to graduate from high school. During the years that Squires was an undergrad at the University of Kansas, he was a part of the Black fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha and the Owl Society, which was an honorary organization for junior men. Alpha Phi Alpha was the first Black fraternity on the University of Kansas campus which was named the Upsilon Chapter and founded on December 2, 1917. The fraternity chapter has many traditions and legacies that follow through the generations such as their slogan, “Higher Scholastic Attainment”. As a basketball player, Squires was awarded a Freshman Basketball Award for the 1950-1951 season. He was on the varsity team and held the on court basketball position of guard; he became a valuable talent for the team during the 1952 National Championship. Coach Phog Allen said that Squires in his first game “shows fine early coaching and has a lot of fire, enthusiasm and ability. If he continues to improve as he has in the past few weeks he’ll play a lot for us.” According to Coach Allen, he was well-liked by the team and the crowd also.Mayer, Bill. \\"Sport Talk.\\" Lawrence Journal-World. 4 Dec. 1951, 93rd ed., Sports sec.: 11. Print. As Coach Allen had stated in the LJWorld, the media guide for the 1951-1952 Basketball season backed him up, it said that Squires was a better than average prospect who played for Ralph Miller at Wichita East, a former KU great. Squires was living up to his high school nickname, being called “clever” and a “quick ball-handler” but needed to work on his aggressiveness. In 1952, Squires was 6 foot 6 inches tall and a nifty shooter which helped the Jayhawks to their first NCAA title in a substitute role during that year. However, a lung ailment fell upon him, which took him out of the hunt to be put on the starting roster for the 1953 season. This was seen as a loss that would detrimentally hurt the team in factors such as speed, aggressiveness, and defense which Squires was known for helping out immensely in these areas. Squires received his letter “K” during the 1953-1954 season. Coach Allen came under fire in 1953 from sports editor Jim Hall when he left Squires at home in Lawrence when the Jayhawks were set to play Tulane and LSU.Jackson, Marion E. \\"Sports of the World.\\" Atlanta Daily World: 7.

He again, just like in high school, graduated in the top ten percent of his graduating class. Squires ended up working for the “Look” Magazine Subscription Office in Des Moines as a junior accountant. A friend of the Kansas men's basketball team, who managed the office, hired Squires. He later moved on after a year and a half in which he moved up the ladder in the accounting department of the magazine office to an assistant and then later on to the manager.Young, Andrew Sturgeon. \\"Anniversary Celebration.\\" Los Angeles Sentinel: 2.

Career  Squires was the President of the Bank of Finance which celebrated its tenth anniversary on November 16, 1974; he fixed the bank to make it more fiscally sound and able to abide to business policies. The bank had 1,300 stockholders which for the first time on August 29, 1974 received their first check that represented the first share paid by the Bank to its holders. He started as the Chief Executive at Bank of Finance in 1964; employed 68 employees when the bank was ranked at number seven in “Black Enterprise: Top 100” in 1975. The “Black Enterprise” list in June 1975 was the third time that the magazine had compiled a list of the 100 largest “black-owned and/or black managed businesses in the United States.”\\"The Nations Leading Black Businesses: Top 100.\\" Black Enterprise June 1975: 46. Print. Despite the original growing pains the Bank had to endure in order to become a good business, it still prides itself on the ideal to fill in the economic gaps that existed in the black community. The Bank of Finance had provided financial assistance for the “creation of medical centers, day care centers, homes for the aged, and a greater number of multiple-unit housing complexes.” They return the money to the local community that they earn from the businesses in the form of payroll purchases. Before the success of the Bank of Finance, Squires was with the Douglass State Bank in Kansas City, Kansas as a teller for ten years after his accounting job with the magazine. He moved up to Executive Vice-President and then later formed a bank with four other men called the Swope Parkway National Bank in Kansas City, Missouri. The bank opened in July, 1968 amounted up to $14.5 million while he was there and he later moved on to San Diego where another bank was being planned. Edward Tillmon, the past president of the Bank of Finance, brought Squires to the bank as Executive Vice-President. At a point around the 70s, Squires opened up a real estate company called, L.C. SQUIRES REAL ESTATE COMPANY, INC. in Los Angeles but it was suspended in 1982.

The typical case showing the principle of alternative liability in action is Summers v. Tice, where the two defendants negligently shot in the direction of the plaintiff and only one of the bullets caused the plaintiff's injury. In the interest of justice, the innocent plaintiff's case is not defeated because she cannot prove which party was the actual cause (but-for cause) of her injury. Requirements The doctrine requires that the plaintiff bring all possible defendants into court and that the plaintiff show the defendants all breached a duty of reasonable care. The burden then shifts to the defendants to provide evidence of who caused the injury. Rationale The underpinning of this doctrine is that a plaintiff should not be barred from seeking recovery simply because she does not know who caused her injury. The defendants are usually the parties in the best position to have the relevant information. Distinguish alternative liability from the smoke-out function of res ipsa loquitur seen in the leading case of Ybarra v. Spangard. In Ybarra, the plaintiff brought all defendants who could have possibly been negligent (breached a duty of reasonable care) so that they could show which party actually was negligent. Thus, in the smoke- out function of res ipsa, the burden is shifted on the defendants to show negligence, whereas in alternative liability all defendants are all shown to have breached a duty of reasonable care and the plaintiff shifts the burden to show causation.

Hering is professor of surgery and medicine and executive director of the Schulze Diabetes Institute at the University of Minnesota, where he serves as Vice Chair of Translational Medicine in the Medical School's Department of Surgery and where he holds the McKnight Presidential Chair in Transplantation Science and the Jeffrey Dobbs and David Sutherland, MD, PhD Chair in Diabetes Research.U Minnesota Faculty page  Biography  He received his medical degree in 1983 at Justus Liebig University Medical School, in Giessen, Germany, where he also did his residency in internal medicine, followed by training in endocrinology. He joined the faculty at the University of Minnesota Medical School in 1996.  Academic work  Hering is an internationally renowned leader in the field of islet cell transplantation, with his research focusing on innovating and implementing cell-based therapeutics into specialty care biologics for diabetes. The human islet transplant protocol that Dr. Hering and his team have refined has markedly improved short-term and long-term clinical outcomes in patients with type 1 diabetes;[Journal of the American Medical Association 2005; 293 (7): 830-5] key elements of this protocol have been adopted for the Phase 3 licensure trial of human islets by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored multi-center Clinical Islet Transplant Consortium.[Diabetes Care 2016; 39: 1230-40] For islet transplantation to become a premier treatment option for type 1 diabetes, a widely available cell source and a safe rejection prophylaxis are required. Hering's research group has addressed both requirements. Widely recognized as a pioneer in islet xenotransplantation, Hering and his team demonstrated that xenogeneic, porcine donor-derived islets can be utilized as a cell source for transplant in diabetes. His research group was the first to demonstrate long-term diabetes reversal after adult porcine islet xenotransplants in nonhuman primates, an accomplishment that has reinvigorated the field of xenotransplantation.[Nature Medicine 2006; 12 (3): 301-3] Hering co-founded Spring Point Project, an organization established to generate designated pathogen-free, ‘medical-grade’ source pigs for planned clinical translation of islet xenotransplantation. To eliminate the need for recipient immunosuppression, Hering has collaborated with Drs. Singh, Ramachandran, and Graham at the University of Minnesota and Drs. Luo and Miller at Northwestern University and others to develop the first strategy to induce reliably and safely stable immune tolerance of transplants in any stringent preclinical model that does not require same donor bone marrow transplantation with its intense conditioning regimen.[Nature Communications 2019; 10:3495] This strategy involves the peritransplant administration of apoptotic donor leukocytes under short-term immunosuppression and, unlike strategies that involve same donor bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, is consistently effective in nonhuman primates even without requiring irradiation, indiscriminate T cell depletion, myelosyppression, and calcineurin inhibition in transplant recipients, thereby pointing to a clinically applicable path toward immune tolerance of islet allografts and possibly also solid organ allografts. To extend these findings to induction of immune tolerance to porcine islet cell and organ xenografts, Hering is partnering with investigators with expertise in gene editing of porcine donors to integrate preemptive treatments with apoptotic donor leukocytes and genetic engineering of porcine donors into a safe and successful rejection prophylaxis for wide application in porcine to human xenotransplantation. He has been invited to advise the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institute of Health (NIH) on issues related to xenotransplantation and cellular therapies for diabetes. He has sat on the editorial boards of several professional journals and is the author or co-author of 25 book chapters and of over 300 articles, including articles in Nature, Nature Medicine, Nature Communications, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, New England Journal of Medicine, and the Journal of the American Medical Association. Hering has been a long-term member of the steering committees of the NIH Immune Tolerance Network, NIH Clinical Islet Transplant Consortium, NIH Nonhuman Primate Transplantation Tolerance Collaborative Study Group, and NIH Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet; he currently serves on the steering committee of the NIH Immunobiology of Xenotransplantation Consortium. Hering is also the medical director of the NIH Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry (CITR). He served as president of the Cell Transplant Society, president of the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA), and as president of the International Pancreas and Islet Transplant Association (IPITA). In recognition for his outstanding contributions to islet transplantation, Hering was named by U.S. News & World Report and Castle Connolly Medical Ltd. one of America's Top Doctors, a distinction reserved for the top 1% of physicians across the U.S. for their specialty.

Celia has been portrayed by Jordan Lane Price since the revival's debut episode on April 29, 2013. Casting Following the announcement that Prospect Park would reboot All My Children as a web series, it was reported that actress Jordan Lane Price was cast in the role of an aged Miranda Montgomery. It was later confirmed that Price was cast as the new character of Celia Fitzgerald, and that the role of Miranda would be played by Denyse Tontz. Price first appeared in the contract role when the series premiered on April 29, 2013. Development Introduction Celia Fitzgerald first appears bumping into Pete Cortlandt (Robert Scott Wilson) on the street on April 29, 2013. Celia was a former student at Bramwell Hall before she remained there to teach art history after her high school graduation. In addition to teaching at Bramwell, Celia also volunteered at the Miranda Center. Her volunteer work including passing out condoms until her guardian, a man whose identity she did not know, forbade it. The message was passed from her guardian to her via Evelyn Johnson, the woman that oversaw the girls at Bramwell and had raised Celia since her parents' deaths years ago. Under the orders of Celia's guardian, Evelyn closely managed Celia's activities. Celia was allowed to continue her work with the Miranda Center but from an administrative support position instead. However when she develops a crush on Pete Cortlandt (Robert Scott Wilson), Evelyn does not approve of Celia's involvement with Pete and planned to take Celia out of the country. Instead, Pete and Celia escaped to New York City. Relationship with Pete Cortlandt Upon her debut and pending relationship, Omar White-Nobles of TVSource Magazine referred to Pete and Celia's relationship as a high point for the series, noting \\"Jordan Lane Price and Rob Wilson have good, natural chemistry. I could see them turning into something big.\\" When Pete and Celia escaped to New York City the two shared a hotel room but Celia was not comfortable sharing a bed and admitted that she was a virgin. Pete insisted that he respected Celia. They return to Pine Valley because of Pete's work causing her believe that dating a successful entrepreneur like himself was too much for her. Celia decided to end her relationship with Pete even after he professed his love for her. Jillian Bowe confirmed that Brooke Newton's Colby would cause problems for Celia due to Pete's past crush on Colby. When Pete slept with his friend Colby Chandler after Celia ended the relationship, Celia was convinced that she had made the correct decision. Colby flaunted her sexual relationship with Pete to Celia while the women worked together on a charity gala benefiting the Miranda Center hosted by Chandler Media. Each time Pete ran into Celia, he insisted that he only cared for her and denied any involvement with Colby. Meanwhile, Colby added a bachelor auction component to the charity gala and Pete reluctantly agreed to participate. At the auction, an unknown caller placed a bid on Celia's behalf and she won the date with Pete. Pete took her sailing and reenacted a romantic scene from her favorite movie. Their date was cut short when Pete's mother and Colby set a skunk loose and Celia was sprayed. Pete took Celia back to his place for her to clean up and they became closer. Mental health issue Upon running away with Pete, Celia becomes unsettled after experiencing a frightening vision in which a man threatened a young girl. It was similar to the chants that Celia often experienced in her head in which a voice whispered that \\"he's always right behind you.\\" After Pete's work forced him to return to Pine Valley, Celia researched her hallucinations. When she questioned Evelyn about the sanity of her parents, Evelyn suggested that the pressure of dating a successful and handsome entrepreneur like Pete was too much for her. That revelation convinced Celia to break up with him. The hallucinations stopped until she won a date with Pete at a auction. As the date with Pete approached, Celia's visions continued and she met with therapist Dixie Cooney. Dixie suggested that Celia's subconscious must have something to let out and she promised to help her. Celia was optimistic about her relationship with Pete after speaking with Dixie and she looked forward to her date. Storylines Celia first appears bumping into Pete Cortlandt (Robert Scott Wilson) on the street on April 29, 2013. The two immediately form a connection, as it is revealed Celia lives at the private school, Bramwell Hall, while she tutors her fellow students. She has been raised by her mysterious guardian, although he has never revealed his identity to her. Celia and Pete begin to date, despite the disapproval of her guardian. Reception In his review of the reboot's first episode, Errol Lewis of Soap Opera Network praised the character of Celia, and the potential romance between Celia and Pete. Lewis said, \\"Celia screams the modern day Erica Kane (Susan Lucci) in the sense that there’s something in her past that you can’t wait to see revealed while wanting her to get whatever she wants and if she may want her some Pete, let the girl have at it.\\".

Overview Seen by proponents as the networking model of the future,iAreaNetwork Vision Statement. an IAN securely connects endpoints through the public Internet, so that they can communicate and exchange information and data without being tied to a physical location. Unlike a LAN, which interconnects computers in a limited area such as a home, school, computer laboratory or office building, or a WAN, which is a network that covers a broad area, such as any telecommunications network that links across metropolitan, regional, or national boundaries, using private or public network transports, the IAN eliminates a geographic profile for the network entirely because the applications and communications services have become virtualized. Endpoints need only be connected over a broadband connection across the Internet. Hosted in the cloud by a managed services provider, an IAN platform offers users secure access to information from anywhere, at any time, via an Internet connection. Users also have access to telephony, voicemail, e-mail, and fax services from any connected endpoint. For businesses, the hosted model reduces IT and communications expenses, protects against loss of data and disaster downtime, while realizing a greater return on their invested resources through increased employee productivity and reduction in telecom costs.  History  The IAN is rooted in the rise of cloud computing, the underlying concept of which dates back to the 1950s; when large-scale mainframe became available in academia and corporations, accessible via thin clients and terminal computers.Martínez-Mateo, J., Munoz- Hernandez, S. and Pérez-Rey, D. “A Discussion of Thin Client Technology for Computer Labs.” University of Madrid. May 2010. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45917654_A_Discussion_of_Thin_Client_Technology_for_Computer_Labs Because it was costly to buy a mainframe, it became important to find ways to get the greatest return on the investment in them, allowing multiple users to share both the physical access to the computer from multiple terminals as well as to share the CPU time, eliminating periods of inactivity, which became known in the industry as time-sharing.McCarthy, John. “Reminiscences on the History of Time Sharing.” Stanford University. 1983 Winter or Spring. The increasing demand and use of computers in universities and research labs in the late 1960s generated the need to provide high-speed interconnections between computer systems. A 1970 report from the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory detailing the growth of their \\"Octopus\\" network gave a good indication of the situation.Mendicino, Samuel. Computer Networks. 1972. pp 95-100. http://rogerdmoore.ca/PS/OCTOA/OCTO.html As computers became more prevalent, scientists and technologists explored ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users through time sharing, experimenting with algorithms to provide the optimal use of the infrastructure, platform and applications with prioritized access to the CPU and efficiency for the end users. John McCarthy opined in the 1960s that \\"computation may someday be organized as a public utility.\\".Garfinkle, Simson. “The Cloud Imperative.” MIT Technology Review.

In the 1990s, telecommunications companies who previously offered primarily dedicated point-to-point data circuits, began offering virtual private network (VPN) services with comparable quality of service but at a much lower cost. By switching traffic to balance utilization as they saw fit, they were able to optimize their overall network usage.“Virtual Private Networks: Managing Telecom’s Golden Horde.” Billing World.

Cloud computing extends this boundary to cover servers as well as the network infrastructure. After the dot-com bubble, Amazon played a key role in the development of cloud computing by modernizing their data centers, which, like most computer networks, were using as little as 10% of their capacity at any one time, just to leave room for occasional spikes. Having found that the new cloud architecture resulted in significant internal efficiency improvements whereby small, fast-moving \\"two-pizza teams\\" (teams small enough to be fed with two pizzasAnders, George. “Inside Amazon's Idea Machine: How Bezos Decodes The Customer.” Forbes. April 2012) could add new features faster and more easily, Amazon initiated a new product development effort to provide cloud computing to external customers, and launched Amazon Web Services (AWS) on a utility computing basis in 2006. In early 2008, Eucalyptus became the first open- source, AWS API-compatible platform for deploying private clouds. In early 2008, OpenNebula, enhanced in the RESERVOIR European Commission-funded project, became the first open-source software for deploying private and hybrid clouds, and for the federation of clouds.OpenNebula Website http://www.opennebula.org/start In the same year, efforts were focused on providing quality of service guarantees (as required by real-time interactive applications) to cloud-based infrastructures, in the framework of the IRMOS European Commission-funded project, resulting to a real-time cloud environment.IRMOS Website http://www.irmosproject.eu/ By mid-2008, Gartner saw an opportunity for cloud computing \\"to shape the relationship among consumers of IT services, those who use IT services and those who sell them\\" and observed that \\"organizations are switching from company-owned hardware and software assets to per-use service-based models\\" so that the \\"projected shift to computing... will result in dramatic growth in IT products in some areas and significant reductions in other areas.\\"Plummer, Daryl. “Cloud Computing Confusion Leads to Opportunity.” Gartner Inc.

It pioneered the idea of an IAN. Since then, it has strengthened operations and has made significant investments in developing a powerful infrastructure to provide businesses with an array of technology solutions, including the patent-pending iAreaOffice, which commercializes the concept of an IAN by eliminating the need for traditional LAN, WAN or telephone system for business communications.

Previously, he served three terms in the Florida House of Representatives, representing parts of Broward and Miami- Dade Counties from 2012 until his election to Senate. He serves as the Chairman of the Senate Education committee and Vice- Chair of the Senate Education appropriations committee. Diaz sits in the Education Commission of the states. History Díaz was born in Hialeah, graduated from Miami Springs High School, and attended St. Thomas University, where he graduated with a degree in human resources in 1994. He then attended Nova Southeastern University, graduating with a Master's degree in educational leadership in 1998. Díaz then began working as a teacher and a coach at Miami Springs High School and Hialeah-Miami Lakes High School, and then became an assistant principal at Hialeah-Miami Lakes. In 2010, Díaz ran for the Miami-Dade County School Board, but lost to Perla Tabares Hantman in the primary, receiving only 39% of the vote to her 61%. Florida House of Representatives In 2012, following the reconfiguration of Florida House of Representatives districts, Díaz ran in the newly created 103rd District in the Republican primary against former State Representative Renier Díaz de la Portilla and Alfredo Naredo- Acosta. Despite the nastiness and perceived closeness of the race, Díaz ended up defeating his opponents by a wide margin, winning 55% of the vote to Díaz de la Portilla's 39% and Naredo-Acosta's 6%. He faced only write-in opposition in the general election and won by a wide margin. While serving in the legislature, Díaz sponsored legislation that would \\"allow more private online education providers , some from outside Florida,\\" to offer classes to public school students; allow students to take classes in public virtual schools in other counties, and require the Florida Department of Education \\"to create a catalogue of online offerings.\\" Also while in the legislature, Diaz took the steps to increase privately operated, tax-payer funded charter schools in Florida, providing more access to students across Florida.

Created by the Institute for Economics and Peace, the creators of the Global Peace Index and the United States Peace Index, the United Kingdom ranked 29/158 on the Global Peace index for 2012. The UK index was released in April 2013 and provides a comprehensive measure of the levels of peacefulness within the United Kingdom from 2003 to 2012. Peace is defined as the absence of violence or the absence of the fear of violence. The UK Peace Index also provides an analysis of the socio-economic factors associated with peacefulness, as well as an estimate of the economic benefits that would flow from increases in peace.  Findings of the report  The index found that UK homicides per 100,000 people had fallen from 1.99 in 2003, to one in 2012. Further, it found that the violent crime rate was down by about one quarter (from 1,255 per 100,000 people in 2003, to 933 in 2012), with the southeast of the country as the most peaceful place to live (Broadland in Norfolk received the highest rank). In Scotland, Glasgow was rated least peaceful and the Orkney Islands as most peaceful. In Northern Ireland, Belfast was worst and Castlereagh was best. The report finds Wales as \\"easily\\" the most peaceful of the UK nations. In terms of other categories of crimes, public disorder offenses fell by 29%, while weapons crimes fell by 34%. The index found that 25 per cent of UK citizens expect to become a victim of crime, while only 4 per cent actually experience it. Despite the high rate of perceptions of crime, the country experienced the largest drop in violence rates of any European country over the last decade. The report notes that \\"there is no commonly accepted explanation by criminologists for the fall in violence in many of the world's regions including the US, Western Europe, Eastern and Central Europe, as well as the UK,\\" and that \\"many of the more common theories\\" are not backed by statistical evidence. For example, while the global financial crisis has seen many countries suffer severely in economic terms and while levels of peacefulness increased, the idea that violent crime goes up when the economy goes down is not backed by the evidence. The UKPI reinforces findings from the United States Peace Index: access to employment, health, and education provides protection from the poverty and has significant impact on reducing violence and improving economic activity. The study found that violence costs the U.K. 124 billion pounds ($189 billion) a year, more than 7 percent of gross domestic product. The authors of the index have stated that a 9% reduction in violence in the UK would be equivalent to the total cost of the London Olympics.

The film was originally released on VHS in America through Uav Corporation in 2001, with a DVD following in 2006 by Allumination, which used the same artwork as the VHS version.

Plot A 33-year-old lawyer, Derek Bradshaw courts and wins Amy Miller, an 18-year-old, sexy, virginal high school cheerleader. The slick lawyer is the epitome of creepiness: a straight-faced liar, a sneaky philanderer, and magnetically charismatic. He seduces Amy with romantic evenings and extravagant gifts much too adult for an 18-year-old. Amy's support system falters as she withdraws from her friends and her hard-working single mother, while a mystery stalker repeatedly threatens Amy's life. Is it Derek's suspicious wife Elizabeth, Amy's best friend Dana, a jealous ex-boyfriend, or some other anonymous competitor? When Amy finally acknowledges Derek's duplicity and attempts to end the affair, he won't let her off that easily, and the threats escalate as she becomes the victim of vicious pranks and ultimately, life-threatening attacks.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115643/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl Cast * Cassidy Rae as Amy Miller * Vincent Irizarry as Derek Bradshaw * Allison Smith as Jennifer * Jamie Rose as Elizabeth Bradshaw * Ashlee Levitch as Dana * Sherry Hursey as Ruth Miller * Nancy Carlin as History teacher * Richard Conti as Husband in Mansion * James Coulter as Yuppie in Bar * Katie Davis as Christie * Kandeyce Jorden as Erin * Lisa Rodríguez as Lauren * Howard Swain as Detective Meyers * Amber Van Lent as Derek's secretary * Steve Zad as Andy Reception Allmovie gave the film two out of five stars, where the reviewer Lisa Kropiewnicki described the film as a \\"romantic thriller\\", and stated \\"Director Marina Sargenti, who has a penchant for horror thrillers such as \\"Child of Darkness\\", \\"Child of Light\\" (1991) and \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" (1990), succeeds in building tension and creating some titillation in this \\"woman in jeopardy\\" thriller. However, while leads Cassidy Rae and Vincent Irizarry are blessed in the genes department, their story line is cliche- ridden trash. Trite dialogue, frustratingly stupid character decisions, an outdated soundtrack, and camera direction that's intended to be voyeuristic but comes off more like a spastic puppy-cam are just a few of the film's sins. Satisfaction is denied as the villain (skillfully played by Irizarry) never truly gets what he deserves, a hallowed hallmark of this benighted genre.

'Okhai Ojeikere, was a Nigerian photographer known for his work with unique hairstyles found in Nigeria.  Biography  Ojeikere was born 10 June in 1930 in Ovbiomu-Emai, a rural village in south-western Nigeria. He worked and lived in Ketu, Nigeria. At the age of 20 he pursued photography, which was out of the ordinary for people in Nigeria, especially those in his village. Cameras were not in high demand and were of low priority as they were considered a luxury. However, in 1950 Ojeikere bought a modest Brownie D camera without flash, and had a friend teach him the fundamentals of photography. Ojeikere started out as a darkroom assistant in 1954 at the Ministry of Information in Ibadan. After Nigeria gained its independence in 1960, Ojeikere pursued his first job as a photographer. In 1961 he became a studio photographer, under Steve Rhodes, for Television House Ibadan. From 1963 to 1975 Ojeikere worked in publicity at West Africa Publicity in Lagos. In 1967 he joined the Nigerian Arts Council. In 1968 he began one of his largest projects as he documented Nigerian hairstyles. This was a hallmark of Ojeikere's work and he printed approximately a thousand pictures of different African women's hair. A large selection of Ojeikere's work was included in the arsenale section of the 55th Venice Biennale d'arte, \\"Il Palazzo Enciclopedia\\" curated by Massimiliano Gioni in 2013.Evelyne Politanoff, \\"Lavish Hairstyles by J.D. ‘Okhai Ojeikere\\", The Huffington Post Arts & Culture, 18 June 2013.

It originally aired on May 9, 2013. In this episode, Jeff Winger (Joel McHale) is set to graduate and expects things to go quietly. But when the darkest timeline breaks through, the evil counterparts make things messy. The episode received mixed reviews; and the episode was watched by 3.08 million viewers, attaining an 18-49 rating of 1.3, rising in ratings from the previous episode. Plot Mark (Joe Lo Truglio) offers Jeff (Joel McHale), his old partner, a position at his law firm, arguing Jeff is still a great lawyer. Jeff agrees to consider it. At Greendale, Jeff applies for graduation in Dean Pelton's (Jim Rash) office with little fanfare, but he eventually agrees to have a proper ceremony. Later, Jeff confesses to Britta (Gillian Jacobs) he is worried about how leaving Greendale will affect the group, particularly Abed (Danny Pudi). He decides to roll a die and watch Abed's reaction, given Abed's fear of other timelines. However, the die lands on its edge and no number comes up. Evil Jeff appears at Greendale, seeking to alienate Jeff from the study group and push him toward Mark's offer. Evil Jeff insults Annie (Alison Brie); Annie later encounters Jeff and runs away upset, to Jeff's confusion. Abed meets Evil Jeff and recognizes him as a doppelganger. Abed is shot with a specialized paintball gun and is sent to the \\"Darkest Timeline\\". There, Abed finds Evil Abed, who has become good again and provides his counterpart with supplies to defeat the doppelgangers. Jeff goes to apologize to Annie but unknowingly meets Evil Annie, who takes the opportunity to steal his phone. Evil Jeff insults the rest of the group. Jeff arrives at his ceremony to find no one there. Evil Annie arrives with Jeff's phone and urges him to call Mark. When Jeff tries to leave, Evil Jeff arrives to stop him, but Chang (Ken Jeong) protects Jeff. Jeff escapes and explains what has happened to the group. Abed proves Jeff's story by returning with the special paintball guns. The rest of the Evil Study Group arrives in the prime timeline to take on their counterparts but are slowly eliminated. With only Evil Jeff remaining, Abed reveals these events are occurring in Jeff's mind due to his anxieties about graduation. Abed reassures Jeff he has become a better person at Greendale. Jeff shoots Evil Jeff and reverts to the moment before he threw the die. He decides against tossing it. Jeff's graduation ceremony takes place, and he gives a heartfelt speech to the group. Pierce (Chevy Chase) interrupts the ceremony so he can graduate first. Afterwards, Jeff announces he will decline Mark's offer and search for work at a small firm, allowing him to \\"help the little guy\\" and stay close to the group. Production The season finale aired as the thirteenth episode, but was the eleventh episode produced. In a Reddit AMA, Megan Ganz explained that, because it was written in “a pinch”, she wishes that she could have gone back and redone the season finale. She wrote, \\"I wrote it too long (like... 6 minutes too long) and we had to cut a ton out of it in the edit bay. […] Finales are generally terrible, and I am expecting that people will say this one is trying to [sic] hard, because it is.\\" This is the second \\"Introduction to Finality\\" episode of the series, following season three's finale, \\"Introduction to Finality.\\" During Jeff's graduation ceremony, \\"SIX SEASONS AND A MOVIE\\" is seen written on the chalkboard as the first words of several sentences. The show's production code of #411 is seen in the upper-right corner. In \\"Remedial Chaos Theory,\\" Evil Abed made a pact with Evil Troy to go to the real timeline and destroy it.  Cultural references  The clothing worn by the Evil Study Group resembles costumes from the Matrix series, and the final shootout in which Jeff stops the bullet shot by evil Jeff references a similar scene in The Matrix. The scene in which Evil Jeff first appears in the Dean's office references the scene in the film The Terminator when the titular character is introduced. Reception Ratings In its original broadcast, the episode was viewed by 3.08 million American viewers, and received an 18-49 rating/share of 1.3/5. It displays a significant rise in viewers and ratings from the previous episode \\"Heroic Origins.\\" The finale also tied in 18-49 ratings with the third season finale \\"Introduction to Finality,\\" but beat it in viewers. The show placed third in its timeslot and ninth for the night. Critical reception The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode \\"good\\" at 7.6, saying, \\"as far as being a fun, nostalgia-packed episode, that may be the very last one, it mostly worked.\\" Gabrielle Moss of TV Fanatic was positive, saying, \\"this episode was an excellent tribute to the slow-burn character development of Jeff Winger.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix was less favourable, stating, \\"The actual non-dream graduation ceremony was sweet, but nearly everything leading up to it was a mess.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was negative and rated the episode a D, saying it was, \\"no longer a show that's capable of much beyond repeating elements it thinks the audience will like over and over again.\\" In a retrospective ranking of all 110 episodes of the series, Cory Barker of TV.com ranked this episode last, describing it (along with season 4's \\"Conventions of Space and Time\\") as \\"everything you loved about Community, only broken apart into a million pieces, and reconstructed without a soul\\".

Mahima Siddhi One morning when he proceeded to his farm, Lord Guru Dattatreya gave him darshana, revealing himself to Revan Natha. Guru Dattatreya recognised the boy as an Avatara being incarnated on earth, and gave him special siddhi, divine powers, called \\"Mahima\\". After receiving this siddhi, the farmer’s house was flourished with plenty of food grain and prosperity, and Anna Chatra was also started. Machchindra Natha, the first Nath of the Navnath Sampradaya, visited the village when he came to know about Mahima Siddhi. Machchindra Natha recognised Revan Natha that as a Narayana Avatar, but warned that if he kept stuck in a cage of popularity due to this Mahima Siddhi, it would create an obstacle in his Avatar Karya. Machchindra Natha prayed to Lord Dattatreya to give the status of Brahma Sanatana to this boy. Revan Natha realised his Satya Swaroopa, and proceeded to work for the welfare of the world, and the upliftment of poor and needy people. The seven dead children While on pilgrimage, he arrived at one village by name VITA (Near sangli , in Maharashtra). In that village there was a name ceremony function at one Brahmin family. They said Brahmin saw Revan Natha and cordially invited Revan Natha on the holy occasion of name ceremony of his son. Revan Natha decided to stay at Brahmin’s residence for a while when Revan Natha saw his love and respect. A strange thing happened on the night that the kid whose name ceremony solemnised, was suddenly expired over the midnight itself. The mother of the dead kid started weeping. Revan Natha heard voice of her weeping and asked the Brahmin, who is crying, what happened? That Brahmin elucidated all his story to Revan Natha and explained about past history of his son that all the kids who took birth at his home were dead and this recently expired kid was his 7th son. After listening the story Revan Natha interact with himself in his mind that how it could be happened when I was present in the Brahmin’s house! After doing condolence there, Revan Natha assured the Brahmin and straight way approached to Lord Shiva and brought Chaitanya of the seven dead kids there from. Revan Natha made seven pieces of the dead kid and reinstated the Sanjivan Chaitanya therein, made alive the seven dead kids and gave them rebirth by using spiritual power. The weeping Brahmin family got showered with the intense happiness and joy. Shri Revan Natha stayed for some more days in that village and thereafter proceeded for pilgrimage for divine duties i.e. welfare of needy people. Temples Several temples are dedicated to Revan Nath. Siddhagiri Math Revananath is considered to have established the Kaadsiddheshwar temple and math in the 7th century CE. Other accounts mention a history of \\"more than 1300 years\\", and the 14th century CE, when a Lingayat Priest established a Shivling at the hill, which became Kaneri Math.Siddhagiri Gramjivan Museum Kaneri Math It is located on Siddhagiri hill in Kanheri village, Karveer tehsil, Kolhapur district, Maharashtra state, India. It is also called \\"Siddhagiri Math\\"Kaneri Math Kolhapur The Siddhagiri Math was established around the Moola- Kaadsiddheswar Shiva temple in the Shaiva-Lingayat tradition. It is a vast campus with the central Shiva temple. In the 12th century the Math came under the influence of Basaveshwar, who established the Lingayat tradition of south India. Nowadays the influence of the math exceeds to most of the districts of Maharashtra and Karnataka, and also to some places in Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. Part of Siddhagiri Math is the \\"Siddhagiri Gramjivan Museum\\", a wax museum dedicated to Gandhi's ideal of rural life. It was established by the 27th Mathadhipati, H.H. Adrushya Kadsiddheshwar Swami Ji. Waarshik Maha Utsava (Annual Ceremony) is being celebrated continuously for 3 days over here and the said practice is observed in Revan Natha Darbar Kolhapur since 33 years regularly with all joy. All spiritual rituals of Natha Sampradaya are being arranged. The Annual ceremony comes in Margashirsha, Vadya Ashthami Navami and Dashami as per Hindu calendar which normally comes in the month of December every year as per English calendar. Besides Annual Maha Utsava, the other important Utsavas like Guru Pornima, Shri Krishnashtami are also celebrated in Revan Natha Darbara enthusiastically. Spiritual guidance is being rendered to the devotees in Revan Natha Darbar Kolhapur.

Excessive stress in medical training predisposes students for difficulties in solving interpersonal conflicts as a result of previous stress. A significant percentage of medical students suffer from anxiety disorders because of the long term effects of stress on emotional and behavioral symptomatology. This condition has become a focus of concern nationally and globally, therefore the first line of detection and defense from stress are the students themselves. Students need to be given the tools to recognize and cope with stress, as well as being assured that they will not suffer judgment from others for recognizing their need for help in dealing with stress. The instructors, advisers and other faculty members who notice the signs of stress in a student need to approach the student in a non- threatening, non-judgmental way, in an effort to help medical students recognize and handle their stress. Causes Stress is defined as an imbalance between environmental conditions necessary for survival and the ability of individuals to adapt to those conditions. Stress in medical students has been recognized for a long time. Many studies have explored the causes, consequences and solutions. There are three issues considered to be the most relevant, in terms of stress development in medical students. They are required to learn a great deal of new information in a short period of time before taking exams and evaluations. Therefore, they have little to no time to review what they have learned. Medical students are overloaded with a tremendous amount of information. They have a limited amount of time to memorize all the information studied. The overload of information creates a feeling of disappointment because of the inability to handle all the information at once and succeed during the examination period. Many medical students struggle with their own capacity to meet the demands of medical curriculum. Stress responses to different situations vary at different levels of consciousness, psychological stress, and physiological stress. These points of stress may be interrelated, and each may be at a different level. Many people believe that the most stressful period of a medical student's academic career is the gap between graduation from medical school and being board eligible in a medical specialty. The Resident Service Committee of the Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine (APDIM) divided the common stressors of residency into three categories: situational, personal, and professional. Situational stressors include inordinate hours, sleep deprivation, excessive workload, overbearing clerical and administrative responsibilities, inadequate support from allied health professionals, a large number of difficult patients, and conditions for learning that are less than optimal. Second year students experience other stress situations because they start to interact with the patients. These interactions include stressful situations, like the delivery of bad news. Personal stressors include family, friend and relationship issues. Financial issues are common, as many residents carry heavy educational debts, and they feel compelled to hold a secondary job in order to repay their debts. Isolation is frequently exacerbated by relocation away from family and friends. Other stressors include limited free time to relax or develop new support systems, psycho-social concerns brought by the stress of residency, and inadequate coping skills. Professional stressors include responsibility for patient care, supervision of more junior residents and students, difficult patients, information overload and career planning. Effects Excessive amounts of stress in medical training predisposes students for difficulties in solving interpersonal conflicts, sleeping disorders, decreased attention, reduced concentration, temptation to cheat on exams, depression, loss of objectivity, increased incidence of errors, and improper behavior such as negligence. Furthermore, stress in medical students can break the stability of the student's health and result in illness. This can cause headaches, gastrointestinal disorders, coronary heart disease, impaired judgments, absenteeism, self-medication, and the consumption of drugs and alcohol. It is notable that these risks continue throughout training, also affecting resident and attending physicians in addition to medical students, particularly with regard to depressive symptoms. A recent study among German medical students at international universities displayed the significantly higher risk of depression symptoms being 2.4 times higher than the average population. 23.5% of these German medical students showed clinically relevant depressive symptoms. A meta-analysis in the American journal JAMA suggested depressive symptoms in 21% to 43% of all medical students. The students make an effort to counteract the impact of stressful situations with various coping skills. The coping includes both cognitive and behavioral efforts against the problem of stress encountered during examinations. Medical students who fail to manage their stress levels have a tendency to be less competent in their work. Students who do not manage the time limits of examinations well lack time for exercise and social interactions because those two points are more stressful than the perceived discrimination on the course or the death of patients. Physical effects Stress levels have a strong relationship with physical condition. Medical students during an examination period can experience insomnia, fatigue, and nausea. Moreover, metabolism is disturbed by diarrhea or constipation. Skin diseases, including acne, dermatitis, and psoriasis, are common during the examination period. These symptoms are provoked by long working hours and the tension of completing the courses with good grades. Medical students have been known to consume caffeinated beverages to be active and alert during time of studying. These students drink large quantities of coffee, tea, cola, and energy drinks. Though an increased intake of caffeine can increase the levels of adenosine, adrenaline, cortisol and dopamine in the blood, caffeine also inhibits the absorption of some nutrients, increasing the acidity of the gastrointestinal tract and depleting the levels of calcium, magnesium, iron and other trace minerals of the body through urinary excretion. Furthermore, caffeine decreases blood flow to the brain by as much as 30 percent, and it decreases the stimulation of insulin, a hormone that helps regulate the body's blood sugar level. Stress can cause high levels of the following hormones: norepinephrine, leptin, NPY, nitrite, ACTH and adrenomedullin. Elevated levels of adenosine, adrenaline, cortisol and dopamine in the blood can produce fatigue, depression, behavior changes, heart disease, weight problems, diabetes, and skin diseases. It also decreases the immune response, which can lead to heartburn and stomach ulcers. The hormones of the menstrual cycle (follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)) during the examination periods are also affected. Female students may be disturbed during menstrual cycles because the FSH and LH normal levels changes radically. Medical students may also have disturbed sleep cycles in these periods. Psychological effects An optimal level of stress is considered good because medical students develop coping abilities. However, too much stress causes problems. Previous studies have reported that a significant percentage of medical students suffer anxiety disorders because stress has a strong relationship to emotional and behavioral problems. Feelings of disappointment academically are most prevalent in those students who have poor academic performance. The major emotional disorders that have been observed include the inability to feel reasonably happy, loss of sleep, over-worry, constantly feeling under strain, feeling unhappy and depressed, inability to concentrate, inability to enjoy normal activities, losing confidence in one’s self, inability to overcome difficulties, inability to face up to problems, inability to make decisions, inability to play a useful part in things, and believing oneself to be worthless. Given these emotional disorders, studies have also proved that medical students are more likely to have suicidal thoughts than students from other schools. Female medical students may respond to the stress with stronger manifestations of anxiety. Physiological, psychological and behavioral stressors are found to be related to the metabolic changes of the body. Stress may also harm professional effectiveness. It decreases attention, reduces concentration, impinges on decision-making skills, and reduces the ability to establish strong physician–patient relationships. Medical students have also noticed changes in their behavior when they are stressed. Irritability and depression are common in students in later semesters, and these mental disturbances increase when examinations start. Treatment As too much stress causes problems, it is important to evaluate the degree of stress a student may have. Today, there are methods to assess the level of emotional stress that medical students can handle. It is advisable to manage study time and include healthy nutrition during the whole day. In addition, daily exercises can help to reduce the stress. Interventions against academic dishonesty such as plagiarism also helps to prevent the risk of stress and depression in medical students. Studying in a small group also allows students to learn from each other and reduce the stress of learning by sharing ideas. Furthermore, some medical schools provide psychologists to help students manage stress. Communication among third and fourth year medical students prepares them for the stressors of real-life clinical practice. This mental preparation stimulates the students to reduce the percentages of error in a medical consultation. Medical students are prepared to diagnose and treat patients, but may not be adequately prepared to interact with the problems of their patient, or to deal with bad news as well as the patient's emotional stress during consultations. Emotional intelligence (EI) can be a protection against the effects of psychological stress, and it may enhance well-being. However, EI is molded through personality and has not been observed to be affected by stressful situations. However, those students who participate in extracurricular activities have lower states of anxiety than those who are concentrated only on their studies. To address these problems, some medical schools have made changes such as reducing the workweek, instituting curricular reforms such as having shorter classes, less rote memorization, and providing psychological services. Stress in medical students has become a focus of concern globally, with the first line of detection and defense of the stress being the students themselves. Some interventions include compulsory attendance in support groups, so the level of stigma is much lower than that associated with attending individual therapy. This provides long-term continuous support and help for students to monitor the progress and preparation for a better practice. Other stress-management programs provide trainees with coping techniques such as hypnosis, imagery, and muscle relaxation; affiliation with peers, opportunities for emotional expression and intensified relationships with the faculty. The interventions of the majority of the programs use a group structure where the trainees meet with their peers, or with leaders. No \\"gold standard\\" exists for the content of stress-reduction programs for medical trainees. Some propose a scheme of directed and non-directed support groups, relaxation training (including meditation and hypnosis), time- management and coping skills, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and mentoring programs. Good intervention includes relaxation basics like abdominal breathing, learning to identify and counter negative thoughts, use of the imagery in relaxation, practical ways to increase healthy eating, building positive coping, applying relaxing or activating words appropriately, and redirecting time and energy to different tasks based on the level of importance.

His parents, Murray Dodd MacDonald and Caroline Pinkerton MacDonald, migrated to the United States in 1944: first to Boston, then in 1946 to Hawthorne, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. He was educated in local public schools, graduating from Leuzinger High School (in neighboring Lawndale, California) in 1959. He received a BA in history in 1963 and a MA in 1964, both from the University of California at Berkeley. He joined the Peace Corps in 1964 and was trained at Columbia Teachers College for educational service in Nigeria. Returning to California, he entered the University of California at Los Angeles as a graduate student in European history. In 1967 he was granted a Fulbright Fellowship, and was the first American scholar to have access to the personal papers of Théophile Delcassé, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs 1898-1905. This resulted in his doctoral thesis, \\"Camille Barrère and the Conduct of Delcassian Diplomacy in Italy 1898-1902.\\" http://www.jfredmacdonald.com He received his Ph.D. from UCLA in 1969. Academic work MacDonald was appointed Assistant Professor of History at Northeastern Illinois University in 1969, and remained there until early retirement in 1996. He began as a scholar of European history, but in the early 1970s, shifted interest to the history of U.S. popular culture, a then- new field for scholarly inquiry. He became a pioneer academic authority on the history of U.S. broadcasting, writing: *Don't Touch That Dial!: Radio programming in American life, 1920-1960. Chicago: Nelson-Hall, 1979.

Archival work  He and his wife began in 1972 at their own expense a private archive of vintage pop music, long-forgotten radio programs, and a wide-range of historical 16mm motion pictures that ranged from travel shorts, old silent educational films, and home movies, to corporate sales shorts, filmed and kinescoped TV programs, commercials, and long-forgotten entertainment shorts. By the end of the 20th century, the Library of Congress termed the MacDonald repository \\"the most important archive in private hands in the United States.\\" As a result of this interest, he founded J. Fred MacDonald & Associates in 1986 as a private commercial enterprise. The enterprise continued until the end of 2010, when the Library of Congress took physical possession the resources and shipped it to its Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation in Culpeper, Virginia. Blending his interest in historic film and a dedication to education, in 2010 MacDonald created the American Indian Film Gallery,American Indian Film Gallery: http://aifg.arizona.edu/ a free website promoting the study of Native American peoples living from the Arctic to the tip of South America. This on- line resource contains 450 vintage films about Indian life between the 1920s and 1970s. After a national search for an appropriate new home, in 2012 he donated the entire website to the University of Arizona which now owns and operates the AIFG.

Wenham started her career in karting, competing in various championships between 2004 and 2008, before she switched to car racing in 2008, entering the SAXMAX series. She competed in that series for two years, before moving into the Volkswagen Racing Cup, where she competed for another two years. She made her move into the British GT Championship in 2012, taking second in the GT4 category in her debut season, driving for Century Motorsport. Her performances in the series saw her win the BWRDC Elite GoldStar Award at the start of 2013. Racing career Early career Born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, Wenham first appeared in karting in 2004, competing in the 2CKC Cadet Championship, which she won at her first attempt. In 2005, she entered the BWRDC Kartsport Trophy, the Clay Pigeon Kart Club Championship Comer Cadet and the Hoddesdon Kart Club Championship Comer Cadet championships, finishing fourth, first and sixth respectively. For 2006 and 2007, she competed in the Clay Pigeon Kart Club Championship Minimax and the Hoddesdon Kart Club Championship Minimax championships once more, with her best result coming in the latter series in 2007, with a third place overall finish. For 2008, she entered the Ace & King of Clubs Meeting Rotax Junior, finishing 20th, and also made her car racing debut in the SAXMAX series, finishing 16th overall, having entered nine races. She returned to the series for 2009, this time driving for Ferguson Motorsports and finishing ninth, having competed in the whole season. For 2010, although she had two outings in the SAXMAX series, she moved to the Volkswagen Racing Cup, driving a Volkswagen Golf GTI entered by KPM Racing, where she finished 21st overall, becoming the series' youngest ever driver. She remained in the series in 2011, now driving for Slidesports in a similar car, and was able to finish eighth overall, with a single podium being her best result. British GT For 2012, Wenham signed for the Century Motorsport team to compete in the British GT Championship, partnering Dominic Evans in a GT4-class Ginetta G50. She finished in fourth in her first race, and on the podium in her second race, being partnered by Ginetta's Mark Simpson, as Evans had encountered licensing issues. The season would prove to be a successful one; although a victory eluded the pairing of Evans and Wenham, she was still competing for the title with two races to go (with Evans competing for the runner-up spot, having entered two less races). Following that event, however, Wenham had to settle for second place, the title being won by Team WFR (and their driver pairing of Jody Fannin and Warren Hughes), with Wenham stating that her debut season had \\"been absolutely amazing\\". In 2013, following Wenham's reception of the BWRDC Elite GoldStar award, it was announced that she would remain in the series for Century Motorsport, but that she would now be partnered by Declan Jones, as the team looked to take the GT4 title. The first round of the season saw both drivers take their first ever victories, with Jones becoming one of the youngest ever winners in the series. Soon after the event, and following some controversial comments by former- Formula 1 driver Stirling Moss, The Guardian interviewed Wenham about Moss' comments, which she strongly refuted. The following round at Rockingham saw the duo of Jones and Wenham finishing second. This was followed by an unsuccessful round at Silverstone, suffering from mechanical maladies all weekend, and eventually finishing 34th overall. Snetterton saw her and Jones finish third in race one, and fifth in race two. At Brands Hatch, she finished the race, but finished 22nd and last overall. She was unable to compete in the Zandvoort round due to \\"extenuating circumstances\\", and switched to Blendini/Triple-R for the season finale, partnered Rory Bryant. She finished the season classified fifth in the GT4 driver's standings, with 130.5 points. In November, she was selected as the UK's only representative for the Volkswagen Scirocco R-Cup selection shootout. However, she was unsuccessful, and the scholarship was awarded to Lucile Cypriano. Personal life Wenham is a former pupil of Prince Henry's High School in Evesham, Worcestershire, with her interests outside of motorsport including netball and swimming. Her brother, Guy, also competes for Century Motorsports, in the SAXMAX championship. She has stated that her idols are Sebastian Vettel and Jessica Ennis.

A right- handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler, he was Sussex captain in a few matches in 1932 and regularly in 1933, at first unofficially because of the ill-health of K. S. Duleepsinhji, and then as the official captain later in the 1933 season. Family and education Robert Scott was the elder son of the stockbroker Thomas Gilbert Scott who set up a country house cricket ground at Pelsham, near Peasmarsh, East Sussex, that hosted an annual cricket festival which attracted some Test players and also staged warm-up matches for touring teams in the 1920s and early 1930s. Robert Scott was educated at Winchester College where he was captain of the cricket eleven. He then went to Magdalen College, Oxford, in autumn 1928, and the following April in the Easter vacation he went on an amateurs' cricket tour of Egypt organised by Hubert Martineau. On his return, he played in the freshmen's trial match for the Oxford University side, but was not then picked for any of the first-class matches in the 1929 season. First-class cricket Scott's experience in 1930 was, up to a point, similar to that of 1929. He went on a second Martineau tour of Egypt at Easter, and returned to an Oxford trial match where he again did not distinguish himself. But this time at the end of May 1930 he was handed his first-class debut for Oxford University in a match against Glamorgan; however, he scored only 4 and 6 and he failed to take a wicket. He was dropped from the team after this, but returned to first-class cricket a week later when he played for the Free Foresters amateur team against the University: used as an opening batsman, he scored 26 and 15 and took his first wicket, that of Alan Melville. It was not enough to earn a recall to the Oxford side, however. Scott finally broke through to regular first-class cricket in 1931. In the seniors' trial match he top-scored with 65 and took two wickets, and he then played in all of the University's 12 first- class matches as a lower middle-order batsman and bowler. In an Oxford side with a strong batting line-up led by Melville and the Nawab of Pataudi, Scott made occasional useful scores, with a best of 61 against H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI. But his Blue was based on usefulness as a bowler and he proved it in the University Match against Cambridge University. The match was dominated by two record-breaking batting performances as first Alan Ratcliffe, the Cambridge opening batsman, scored the first-ever double-century in the University Match with 201, and then the Nawab of Pataudi bettered that with 238 not out; Scott was the only Oxford bowler in Cambridge's first innings to restrain the batsmen and he recorded figures of six wickets for 64 runs from 33.2 overs, which remained the best of his first-class cricket career. He then took two further wickets as Cambridge collapsed in the second innings to leave Oxford just 55 runs for an easy victory. After graduation, Scott played in a single County Championship match for Sussex at the start of August 1931 and then in an end-of-season festival match for a team called \\"The Rest\\" against players who had been on the South African tour in 1930–31, though in neither match did he make much impact. County cricketer and captain Scott played a full season of county cricket for Sussex in 1932, usually opening the bowling alongside Maurice Tate and batting at No 7 or 8 in a side full of runs. He contributed both runs and wickets: in all games he scored 838 runs at an average of 24.64 and took 67 wickets at 21.98. In the match against Northamptonshire at Northampton, he made 116 out of 169 in exactly 100 minutes, hitting seven sixes, all of them off Vallance Jupp, and 11 fours; it was his first century and it remained his highest first-class score. Late in the season, the Sussex captain Duleepsinhji, whose health had long been fragile, was forced to stand down and Scott, as the only regular amateur cricketer in the team – Melville was playing for Sussex at this point, but was still a student at Oxford – took over as captain. Sussex had been in with a chance of their first victory in the County Championship until late in the season; in the event, they subsided a little with the departure of Duleepsinhji, but still finished second. Duleepsinhji was expected to return in 1933 and went to a Swiss clinic for treatment in the 1932–33 off-season. But his condition worsened and it became apparent first that he would not return to Sussex in the 1933 season and then that he would be unable to come back to cricket at all. Scott, though one of the younger regular members of the team – only John Langridge, James Cornford and George Cox, Jr. were younger – was the only amateur and was at first stand-in captain and, later in the season, appointed to succeed Duleepsinhji. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack wrote that \\"gaining experience day after day (he) became, long before the end of the summer, a most capable leader\\". Sussex finished second in the Championship again and won both the home and away games against Yorkshire, the Champions. Cornford's emergence as a fast-medium bowler meant that Scott bowled much less in 1933 than he had done in 1932, and his tally of wickets fell to just 22; his batting total fell too, to 599 runs at an average of just over 16. He scored a second first-class century with an innings of 113 against Hampshire in which he contributed all 44 runs in the last-wicket partnership. The end of regular cricket and thereafter The death of his father in August 1933 brought an abrupt end to Scott's cricket career. As the elder son and with a sister who had been incapacitated in a riding accident, Scott took over the running of the Pelsham estate and had little time for cricket. He played just four matches for Sussex in 1934 and appeared for Free Foresters in matches against Oxford University in 1934, 1938 and 1939. Outside cricket, he was chairman of the Siamese Tin Syndicate, a Justice of the Peace and High Sheriff of Sussex. After the Second World War he revived the Pelsham cricket week at his house in East Sussex that had been run by his father 30 years earlier. He died in hospital in London aged 48 after what an obituarist called \\"a severe operation\\".

Background Ian Penny and Gary Hooper were both orthopaedic surgeons in Christchurch, who had both restructured their respective business structures from a sole trader status to that of an employee working for an incorporated company, which had the effect of reducing their tax bill by tens of thousands of dollars per year due to the fact that in year 2000 the taxation rate for an individual became 39%, whereas for a company it was only 33%. Ian Penny's structure was in fact so altered in 1997, well before the government created a personal vs trust/company tax rate differential. The salaries of the surgeons under the new structure were substantially less than their previous incomes when they were sole traders. This resulted in 2002, in Hooper’s case, out of total company income of $567,000 he was only paid a salary of $120,000, and Penny out of $832,000 a salary of $100,000. The tax department recognized that there may be legitimate reasons for a taxpayer to structure its affairs in such a way, but as they deemed the salaries as \\"artificially\\" low (i.e. below market price), they deemed it as a tax avoidance arrangement, making the surgeons liable for the extra amount in tax. A tax avoidance arrangement is as follows: While it was clear that the surgeon’s salaries were way below market value (a concept somewhat new to tax legislation), and so arguably a tax avoidance arrangement, Penny and Hooper did initially successfully defend this matter in the High Court. The IRD overturned this at the New Zealand Court of Appeal by a 2:1 majority. Penny and Hooper appealed to the Supreme Court of New Zealand. Decision The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals decision that it was a tax avoidance arrangement.

He died in the Congo Free State at the age of 30 from tick fever, or African relapsing fever, while investigating the disease, which is caused by a spirillum that was later named Borrelia duttoni. Early years Joseph Everett Dutton was born on 9 September 1874 in Upper Bebington, Cheshire. His father was John Dutton, a chemist, and his mother was Sarah Ellen Moore. He was their fifth son. He attended The King's School, Chester (January 1888 – May 1892). He was admitted to the University of Liverpool in 1892, and earned the gold medal in anatomy and physiology, and the medal in materia medica in 1895. He won the medal in pathology at Victoria University in 1896. He graduated in 1897, and was appointed George Holt fellow in Pathology. He was appointed a resident at the Liverpool Royal Infirmary. He served as house surgeon under Professor Rushton Parker for six months, and then as house physician under Professor Richard Caton. West Africa Dutton joined an expedition to Nigeria in 1900, the third expedition arranged by the Liverpool Medical School, with H.E. Annett and J.H. Elliott. This trip led to two reports, one on sanitation to avoid malaria and the other on filariasis. In 1901 he was elected Walter Myers Fellow in Parasitology. Joseph Dutton in Gambia in 1902–1903 Dutton undertook an expedition to the Gambia on his own at the start of 1901. He prepared a thorough report on methods of fighting malaria. On 10 May 1901 the colonial surgeon at the hospital in Bathurst showed him a blood sample from a government employee with \\"very many actively moving worm-like bodies whose nature he was unable to ascertain\\". The patient returned to England, and Dutton examined him again there, but could not detect any parasites. However, when both the patient and Dutton were back in Gambia on 15 December 1901, Dutton again examined blood samples and \\"found a flagellate protozoon evidently belonging to the genus Trypanosoma\\". Trypanosoma brucei belongs to a family of parasites that so far had been found only in animal blood. The discovery was an important stage in understanding the widespread and often deadly disease of sleeping sickness. Dutton did not immediately draw the connection, since the patient was also suffering from malaria. Dutton also described various other trypanosomes. In September 1902 he returned to the Gambia with John Lancelot Todd, on an expedition which was supported by Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies, which facilitated a prolonged visit to French Senegal. Congo The twelfth expedition of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine left for the Congo Free State on 13 September 1903. Dutton was accompanied by John Lancelot Todd and Cuthbert Christy. Christy went back to England in June 1904, while Todd and Dutton went upstream to Stanley Falls, which they reached late in 1904. There they demonstrated what caused tick fever, and how it was transferred between humans and monkeys. Dutton found that the monkeys could be infected by bites from soft ticks (Ornithodoros moubata) carrying Borrelia duttoni, a spirochaete. He also found that the parasite could pass into the eggs and larvae of the ticks, so the next generation would also be vehicles for infection. Both Todd and Dutton caught the disease, but were well enough to continue traveling, and reached Kasongo on 9 February 1905. Dutton's health then declined quickly. He recorded his symptoms until too weak, after which Todd continued the record. Dutton died at Kasongo on 27 February 1905. More than a thousand people attended his burial, mostly local people whom he had treated and whose respect he had earned. It took two months for the news of his death to be carried to the nearest telegraph station.

A sequel to the mobile-exclusive Worms Golf, the game uses the basic framework of the Worms series as the foundation for a 2D golf title. Gameplay The game utilizes a side-on two-dimensional playfield, as in the core Worms series. The goal is to putt a ball from the starting point on the map to the hole in as few turns (or strokes) as possible. There are also coins to be collected on each map which can be used to purchase unlockables including costumes, golf clubs and balls. Additionally there are Sheep on the field that can be caused to explode by the ball, and weapon crates containing perks and utilities. The game does not feature online play of any kind. Aesthetically, the game draws from the third 2D generation of the Worms series, specifically Worms 2: Armageddon/Worms Reloaded. To celebrate the release of Worms Crazy Golf a golf-themed terrain style was added to Worms Reloaded on the PC as free DLC. Reception Worms Crazy Golf was met with mixed to positive reviews. It holds Metacritic scores of 85/100 and 61/100 for iOS and the PlayStation 3, and 81% and 64% for iOS and the PlayStation 3 respectively on GameRankings. Keza MacDonald of IGN gave the iPad version of a game a 9 out of 10 score praising its unique game layouts and humor.

It is concerned with treating the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas of children from infancy until age eighteen. The principal diseases it is concerned with are acute diarrhea, persistent vomiting, gastritis, and problems with the development of the gastric tract. History Pediatric gastroenterology has grown greatly in North America and Europe. It began with the speciality of pediatrics, which was developed along with children’s hospitals in the 19th century. The concept of specialists concentrating on organ specific specialties started around the same time. A person who contributed to the development of the specialty was Dr. Samuel Gee in London with his focus on serious clinical conditions in children such as celiac disease and cyclic vomiting syndrome. The first national gastrointestinal society was created in Germany in 1920 by Ismar Isidor Boas. He was also the first physician devoted completely to only gastroenterology. Later the American Gastroenterological Association was founded in 1897 by Dr. D. Stewart. The combination to make a pediatric gastroenterological a specialty emerged in the 1960s, almost a century after the specialties of pediatrics and gastroenterology started out individually. All pediatric specialties started out with the concept that children with special needs were not receiving the adequate medical attention that they needed. Margot Shiner, who in 1956 invented a biopsy tube that could be used to diagnose intestinal disease in children, particularly celiac disease, has been credited with initiating the emergence of pediatric gastroenterology as a distinct clinical specialty. Centers of pediatric gastroenterology Centers for gastrointestinal disorders in children began being established in the 1960s in Great Britain, Australia, and continental Europe. The first centers for pediatric gastroenterology were established by Dolf Weijers and the biochemist Van de Kamer. Pediatricians and biochemists were crucial to the development of such specialty since they created the ability to calculate the fat in the feces of celiac patients with or without gluten. A clinical and research program in pediatric gastroenterology and a gastroenterological research were established in the 1960s at the Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne by Charlotte Anderson. Later on an important center focused on nutrition and gut pathophysiology was established by Bertil Linquist in Lund, Sweden. This was the first place in which glucose-galactose malabsorption was reported. Pediatric gastroenterology centers in London contributed greatly to this field and hepatology by helping and recognizing multiple doctors with their investigations. An example is Tom Macdonald, who concentrated his immunological research on gastroenterological diseases in children and the use of a fetal intestinal organ culture model. Important pediatric gastroenterology centers were also established in Helsinki and Tampere, Finland. These centers, led by Jamro Visakorpi, primarily focused on celiac disease, gastroenteritis¸ and food allergies. Other important centers were established in Switzerland, under the leadership of Andrea Prader making Zurich one of the first main centers for pediatric gastroenterology. In that same center, David Shmerling started studying gluten elimination and celiac disease. Salvatore Auricchio along with Giorgio Semenza began comprehending and identifying sugar absorption disorders in children. Ettore Rossi in Berne founded centers in which Beat Hadorn and Michael Kentze, who later went on to establish German centers in Munich and Bonn, which made great contributions in the research of absorption pathophysiology. After working in Zurich, Salvatore Auricchio went on to establish an important center in Naples which focused research on celiac disease, the physiology of absorption, and oral re hydration therapy. In a center located in Brussels, led by E. Eggermont and Helmuth Loeb, Samy Cadranel started developing the concept of endoscopy in children. Centers of pediatric gastroenterology in North America North America has also been a center for the development of pediatric gastroenterology. A pediatric gastroenterology program focusing on researching inflammatory bowel disease, infectious diarrhea, and motility disorders associated with gastrointestinal complications such as constipation and gastro esophageal reflux was established by Murray Davidson at the Albert Einstein Medical School and the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center in New York. Harry Shwachman created the center of excellence for pediatric gastroenterology in Boston in the early 1960s. This center, under the leadership of Richard Grand and Allan Walker, went on to become a major training program for pediatric gastroenterologists. In order to commemorate Dr. Shwaschman and his impact to the field, a Scwaschman Award is given annually since 1984 by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition to a person with important contributions to the field. In Canada, gastroenterology and hepatology surged independently from nutrition at the Hospital for Sick Children (HSC) in Toronto. Peter Durie combined the nutrition and gastroenterology research at the HSC in 1985. Many more centers have been developed in multiple places including Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Jerusalem, São Paulo, Santiago, Taipei, and Tokyo. Education The specialty of pediatric gastroenterology requires four years of undergraduate courses at a college or university in order to obtain a BS, BA, or other bachelor's degree. During these four years a student studying pediatric gastroenterology can also take a pre-med course. Afterwards, the student needs four years of medical school in order to obtain an MD or DO degree and become a general doctor. Afterwards the student needs to take a specialty in pediatrics consisting in three more years of education called residency. Afterwards pediatrics sub- specialize in a more specific area such as pediatric gastroenterology. The time to sub-specialize is called post-residency training also known as a fellowship. It can take from one to three or more years consisting in a total of fourteen years or more. In the United States, the committees to certify pediatric gastroenterologist were created in the 1980s. This gave rise to sub- specialty boards in pediatric gastroenterology in 1990 under the leadership of American board of Pediatrics and its Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition subspecialty sub-board, led by Bill Kish. A formal training program was created later in 1997 by the sub-specialty advisory committee for pediatric gastroenterology of the royal college of pediatrics and child health in Great Britain.  Nutrition  The correct function of the gastric tract and the internal health is related to the nutrition that the child or its mother receives. From the prenatal period, correct nutrition can affect the developing of the system, short bowel syndrome (the most common one), necrotizing enterocolitis, gastroschisis or omphalocele to the postnatal period with diseases such as diarrhea. One of the principal problems of a newborn is an iron deficiency, which will generate anemia. This is caused when the only food that the baby receives is maternal milk which does not fulfill the baby’s nutrition. There is no treatment for this in this period because iron will reach normal levels with the weaning process. The weaning process consists in transitioning from feeding the baby low density food such as maternal milk to start feeding it more complex foods such as meat, fish, or chicken. (uniped) If the weaning process is not carried out correctly or if the child rejects the transition of food the iron deficiency will generate an anemia or even create allergies to certain food. In such cases gastric pediatricians, and not regular pediatricians, should be consulted to treat the anemia because they will now how to recover the correct iron levels without causing any secondary effects in the digestive system. The most common nutrition problems during the childhood are being overweight or underweight, both caused by an imbalance in the number of calories consumed versus the number burned. Both in children should be treated by a gastric pediatrician and a pediatric nutritionist at the same time to help the child recover his normal weight without secondary effects (hypertension, gastritis, etc.). The nutritionist will regulate the eating habits of the child, however, the pediatric gastroenterologist will be the one checking how the change in food habits affects the correct functionality of the digestive system. Diseases A pediatrician can provide treatment to many gastric diseases, but chronic diseases, related with the nutrition of the children, the pancreas or the liver needs to be treated by a specialist. The following are two of the most common ones. Acute diarrhea is one of the most common. Globally, each of the 140 million children born annually experience an average of 7-30 episodes of diarrhea in the first 5 years of life. Some of the causes are infections, lower levels of zinc or problems with some gastric cells. Infant regurgitation is caused by a central nervous system reflex involving both autonomic and skeletal muscles in which gastric contents are forcefully expelled through the mouth because of coordinated movements of the small bowel, stomach, esophagus, and diaphragm. Diagnosis requires that the child be between 1 and 12, the regurgitation must be two or more times per day for three or more weeks, and there is a strong involuntary effort to vomit, hematemesis, aspiration, apnea, failure to thrive, or abnormal posturing. This is transient problem, possibly cause to the immaturity of gastrointestinal motility.

The company had premises at 5, 7 and 9 Regent Street and was noted for the variety and quality of its stock. In 1838 James left the business and the partnership then became known as Howell James & Co. By 1865 the firm employed over 140 women, most of whom lived above the shop. The firm exhibited in London, at the Great Exhibition in 1851 and at the 1862 International Exhibition, and in Paris and the International Exposition of 1867. It sold items by students and designers of the South Kensington School. At the London exhibitions of 1871 and 1872 the company exhibited jewellery by Charles Eastlake, M. D. Wyatt, Lord Leighton and Lewis Foreman Day. The company's 1878 Paris Exhibition stand was designed by Day. In 1889, company employee J. Llewellyn moved to Liberty & Co taking with him exclusive selling rights. In 1881 the premises were reconstructed and these incorporated art pottery galleries. An exhibition was staged, of architectural faience, produced to the designs of M. B. Adams by Burmantofts. In 1884 the company became a limited company and their name changed to Howell & James Ltd.

James, the 1st Baronet, was co-inventor (with his brother William) of Horlicks Malted Milk drink. A recipient of the MC from both the UK and Greece for his actions during World War I, he briefly served as MP for Gloucester, was chairman of Horlicks Ltd and in later life become a renowned breeder of rhododendrons at his island home at Gigha in the west of Scotland. Biography Born in Brooklyn, New York on 22 March 1886, James was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. While at Oxford Horlick played one first-class cricket match for Oxford University Cricket Club against Yorkshire in 1906, before playing two first-class matches for Gloucestershire, making an appearance each in the 1907 County Championship and the 1910 County Championship. He joined the Coldstream Guards at the outbreak of war in 1914, serving in Salonika. It was here that he met King Alexander of Greece and his wife Aspasia Manos, to whom he was later to donate the Garden of Eden in Venice and with whom he remained good friends. Mentioned in dispatches four times, James was also a recipient of the Military Cross, Greek Military Cross, Order of the White Eagle with Swords (4th class), and the Chevalier Legion d'Honneur and was returned as Conservative member of parliament for Gloucester in the 1923 General Election, which he served until 1929. In 1944 he purchased Achamore House and the island of Gigha where he set about planting a rhododendron garden that still exists today. His work as a rhododendron breeder earned him, in 1963, the Victoria Medal of Honour. He also set about using his experience of the family business to support the island's dairy industry. Inheriting the Horlick baronetcy from his nephew in 1958, Sir James died at his home in Gigha on 31.December 1972 and was succeeded by his son, Sir John James McDonald Horlick.

Diane Wild of DVD Verdict reviewed the film in 2005. She felt the film lost its \\"emotional effect because we don't get to know these characters as real people\\". She added: \\"The filmmakers may have thought the story was compelling enough on its own, but without the help of well-developed characters, it feels oddly jarring. Criticizing this well- meaning film feels like kicking a puppy - a sick puppy - but it's not a particularly entertaining hour and a half, when what should be a heart wrenching story is undermined by a script that treats its protagonists as saints instead of people. Unfortunately And Then There was One is too dated and simplistic to bring anything meaningful to the AIDS on film canon, and it doesn't manage to be a compelling drama outside of the real-life tragedy of the disease itself.\\" References External links * Category:1994 television films Category:1994 drama films Category:1994 films Category:American drama films Category:American films Category:English- language films Category:Films based on actual events Category:Films directed by David Jones Category:HIV/AIDS in film Category:Lifetime (TV network) films Category:HIV/AIDS in television ","title":"And Then There Was One (1994 film)"},{"id":"39337731","text":"Bartolomeo Contarini may refer to: *Bartolomeo Contarini (nobleman), 15th- century Venetian businessman and nobleman *Bartolomeo Contarini (naval commander), 17th-century commander of the Venetian and Papal fleets at the Battle of Andros in the Great Turkish War ","title":"Bartolomeo Contarini"},{"id":"39337743","text":"Farisita is an unincorporated community in Huerfano County, Colorado, United States.

It is classified as an endangered breed by both the Ministerio de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentación, the agriculture ministry of Spain, and by the Conservatoire des Races d'Aquitaine in France. It is one of a small number of semi-feral cattle populations in Europe, with the Albera of the Pyrenees, the Monchina of Cantabria, and the Raço di Biòu of the Camargue.  History  The origins of the Betizu are unknown. The name derives from the , \\"elusive cow\\", and distinguishes it from the or \\"house cow\\". It appears in Basque mythology as Zezengorri (\\"red bull\\"), guardian of the treasure of the goddess Mari. The Betizu is sometimes believed to be the remnant of an ancient Pyrenean cattle population adapted to survive in marginal mountain terrain; or it may derive from animals lost or escaped during the annual transhumance. The betizu has also been known by different authors and in different locations as the \\"vaca del país\\", \\"casta navarra\\" and \\"raza vasca\\". José Miguel de Barandiarán has referred to it as the \\"vaca huraña\\". In 2013 the breed population in Navarra was estimated at 254, while the number in Aquitaine was put at less than 150. Navarre reserve The Government of Navarre has launched a project to conserve this autochthonous breed. They own a herd that inhabits the abandoned village of Sastoya, in the Urraúl Alto valley.

These mechanisms include, competitive inhibition or negative feedback. It includes primary hemostasis, which is the process of how blood platelets adhere to the endothelium of an injured blood vessel. Platelet aggregation is fundamental to repair vascular damage and the initiation of the blood thrombus formation. The elimination of clots is also part of thromboregulation. Failure in platelet clot regulation may cause hemorrhage or thrombosis. Substances called thromboregulators control every part of these events. Primary hemostasis inducers One primary function of thromboregulation is the control of primary hemostasis, which is the platelet aggregation process. Some thromboregulators enhance platelet aggregation and some others inhibit the process. Platelet aggregation plays a critical role in the genesis of a resulting thrombus. Adhesion should remain local, but platelet aggregation must grow exponentially to form a platelet thrombus and prevent blood loss. Platelet aggregation factors are the regulators that enhance the adhesion and stimulate the platelets to secrete its granules. It has been shown that collagen, exposed after the injury to the endothelial cover of the vessel, plays as an agonist in platelet adhesion and its activation. The binding of platelets to the sub-endothelial collagen stimulates the secretion of ADP, TXA2, and serotonin present in the platelet granules. ADP-dependent aggregation is mediated by two receptors: the purinergic P2Y1, coupled to Gαq, mediates the shape in the structure of platelets and triggers the aggregation process. Thromboxane A2 (TX2) has a positive feedback in platelet activation. It is produced by the oxygenation of arachidonic acid by two enzymes: cycloxygenase and thromboxane A2 synthase. TX2 effects are mediated by G protein-coupled receptors, subtypes TPα and TPβ. Both receptors mediate phospholipase C stimulation causing an increase of intracellular levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol. Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate causes an increase in Ca concentration and the release of diacylglycerol activates PKC. TPα stimulates cAMP levels whereas TPβ inhibits the level of intracellular cAMP. Serotonin, 5-HT, is an amine synthesized in the gut and it is released into the bloodstream after the activation of presynaptic neurons or enterochromaffin cells stimulation. Later, it is sequestered by the platelets using antidepressant-sensitive 5-HT transporters (SERTs) and into platelet’s granules by the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT). After the secretion, 5-HT increases the effects of prothrombotic agents by its binding with 5-HT2 receptors Primary hemostasis inhibitors Thromboregulation is also in charge of regulating the process of clot elimination, called primary hemostasis inhibition. These inhibitors are substances that prevent the clot formation by preventing platelet adhesion. Platelet inhibition is important to prevent thrombotic episodes or the formation of blood clot and consequently preventing heart attacks and strokes. Some primary hemostasis inhibitors are cAMP, prostacyclin, PGE1, and kistrin. cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, phosphorylate messengers via protein kinase A (PKA). These signaling elements include thromboxane A2, receptor type α, phospholipase Cβ3, and IP3 receptors. Signalization in platelets is very sensitive in cAMP levels. Nitric oxide (NO) stimulates cGMP production and therefore the activation cGMP-dependent protein kinase (G kinase). This kinase inhibits Gαq-phospholipase C-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate signaling and the mobilization of calcium inside the cell for thromboxane A2. PGI2, prostacyclin, binds to IP receptors that catalyze cAMP formation. This process is mediated via GTP-binding protein Gs and adenylyl cyclase. PGE1 binds to IP receptors. IP receptors bind with ionophores that induce ADP and serotonin secretion. PGE1 inhibits the secretion of factors that stimulate platelet aggregation by competitive inhibition. Kistrin is a protein inhibitor of platelet aggregation. It belongs to the homologous family of glycoprotein IIb- IIa antagonists. Kistrin has an adhesion site that binds to GP IIb-IIIa.

Early life Larkin was born in Buffalo to parents who emigrated from England to the United States in 1832. He attended public schools in Buffalo during his childhood and began working at the age of 12 at Western Union as a telegraph messenger. In 1862, he began work in the soap manufactory of Justice Weller, his sister Mary's husband. For the next eight years he worked for Weller in Buffalo, learning the business. From courses at Bryant and Stratton he took in 1865, he learned business bookkeeping and when Weller moved to Chicago in 1870, Larkin went with him. He was admitted to the partnership of J. Weller & Co. the next year. While in Chicago, Weller introduced Larkin to Frances Hubbard whom Larkin married in 1874 at her parents' home in Hudson, Illinois. Larkin Soap Company In 1875, Larkin sold out his interest in J. Weller & Co. to Mr. Weller, and he and his wife moved to Buffalo. Larkin then set up his factory \\"J. D. Larkin, Manufacturer of Plain and Fancy Soaps.\\" His only product was a yellow laundry bar named Sweet Home Soap. The business grew and by 1878, the company produced nine different soap products, ranging from \\"Boraxine\\" soap powder through a variety of laundry soaps to \\"Jet\\" harness soap, \\"Oatmeal\\" toilet soap and Glycerine. Larkin's first salesman was his wife's brother, Elbert Hubbard, who had also been working as a salesman for J. Weller & Co. in Chicago. Hubbard decided to follow his sister and Larkin to Buffalo and work as a salesman. In 1878, Darwin D. Martin was hired as a salesman in Boston. By 1880, as sales to general stores and other merchants who would buy products in large quantities increased, Martin was hired in Buffalo and became the first, and at that time the only, hired office-worker of the Larkin Company as all office work was done by Larkin himself. While at the Larkin Company, Hubbard pioneered the idea of mail-order merchandising. By offering premiums and bonuses in return for sales, the company was able to dispense with a sales force. By 1902, Larkin needed a building to consolidate offices scattered throughout all of his factories. Martin, who had risen to Treasurer and Corporate Secretary, and William Heath, Larkin's brother-in-law and the head of the Legal Department, suggested Frank Lloyd Wright. Larkin consented and Frank Lloyd Wright received his first commercial commission, the Larkin Administration Building which was completed in 1904 and accommodated 1800 corresponding secretaries, clerks, and executives. In 1914, the Larkin Company grew so rapidly that the floor space of its offices covered 64 acres. By 1925, the Larkin Company manufactured most of the 900 catalog items in factories covering sixteen-and-a-half acres on Seneca Street in Buffalo. In addition to their own soaps, cleansers, cosmetics, perfume, pharmaceuticals and food, Larkin offered everything from furniture and clothing to utensils and radios. Buffalo Pottery In 1901, Larkin founded Buffalo Pottery to supply the Larkin Company with premiums of china dinnerware for its customers. Completed in 1903, the company's plant was the largest fireproof pottery in the world; and it was also the only pottery in the world completely operated by electricity. In addition to the china produced for distribution as premiums, Buffalo Pottery manufactured many lines of china sold via both retail and wholesale channels and exported its ware to more than 25 countries. The pottery ultimately turned to the production of commercial chinaware. Changing its name to Buffalo China, Inc. in 1956, the company was one of the largest manufacturers of commercial chinaware in the United States. Buffalo China was sold to Oneida Limited in 1983, and went out of operation in 2004. Legacy Larkin died in 1926, one of Buffalo's most respected citizens, and is buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo. He was a benefactor of the University of Buffalo, where by 1926, he donated $250,000 (). While the Larkin Administration Building was demolished in 1950, a large portion of the original Larkin manufacturing complex survives today including the Larkin Terminal Warehouse which has been converted to corporate offices and houses the headquarters of First Niagara Bank, now home of Key Banks Buffalo division.
